CC:  vbraun ncohen

There are a number of really small issues when trying to build with python 3:

1. sagenb is a marked as dependency of jmol, even though this is no longer the case
2. sagenb is marked as a runtime dependency of sage, again this is no longer the case
3. scons and sagenb don't work with python 3, so they should only be a standard package for python 2
4. atlas needs a small change to make its build script work with python 3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18508

The `notebook()` command uses sagenb, so its a runtime dependency. See also #18512

I don't like this from #17607:

```
    if [ "$1" = all ]; then
        PKG_VAR=PYTHON
        if [ "$SAGE_PYTHON3" = yes ]; then
            PKG_NAME=python3

        PKG_VERSION=$(newest_version $PKG_NAME)

Just define `PYTHON` as alias of `PYTHON2` or `PYTHON3`, analogous how `build/install` deals with `GMP/MPIR` and the toolchain. See the `SAGE_MP_LIBRARY` and `TOOLCHAIN` variables.

This isn't just about beauty. It's about writing code which is easy to understand by doing things in a consistent way.

+1

Plus we might also want to work on the build/ files to make them more readable, and that task is not made simpler if we have to clean "workarounds" on the way.

I've been basically assuming that #17854 will be done in the not too distant future, which will remove half of the scons dependency.
