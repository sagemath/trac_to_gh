Keywords: days93, polytope

The one-point suspension of a vertex `v` of a polyhedron `P` of dimension `d` is obtained by placing `P` in a dimension `d+1` vector space where the last coordinate is 0, then placing a vertex "over" `v` and a vertex "below" `v` in the last coordinate and taking the convex hull.

One can do a similar construction for faces of polyhedron by placing the two vertices relative to the center of the face. This way we get the face split of `P`.

You should check that you obtain the same answer using a proper vertex or a face of dimension 0

```
sage: C = polytopes.cube()
sage: C.faces(0)    # dimension 0 faces
(<0>, <1>, <2>, <3>, <4>, <5>, <6>, <7>)
sage: C.vertices()  # proper vertices
(A vertex at (-1, -1, -1),
 A vertex at (-1, -1, 1),
...
 A vertex at (1, 1, 1))
```

Hi,

Thanks Vincent for your review. I made the suggested changes (along with merging the tutorial).

I realized while making a test that the method `center` was changing the base ring when it was taken over a vertex, I fixed that small thing on the way too.
