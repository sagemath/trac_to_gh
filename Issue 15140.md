# Issue 15140: improve documentation for projective normalize_coordinates

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2013-11-07 22:41:16

Keywords: sage-days55

For some base rings (such as polynomial rings over a field), the output of the function may seem counter intuitive even though the gcd is correct. The documentation is inadequate to describe this situation.

added doumentation and examples. Cleaned up formatting of examples.

One thing for line 394; instead of "Beware" (or "Be aware"), I think this would be best formatted as

```
.. WARNING::

    The gcd depends on the base ring.
```

After this it will be a positive review.

Edit - one other thing, could you remove the comma `,` from line 449.

Best,

Travis

It fixed the typo and clarified the functionality.

Examples do what they should.

doctest looks good.

I missed this the first go-around but you need to have a proper commit message.

Also why did you choose not to use the `.. WARNING::` for the gcd dependency on the base ring?

opps. I forgot the commit message. The warning field is a good suggestion and has now been implemented for this patch.

Last thing; I noticed (I edited my first comment) is that the comma here

```
A polynomial ring over a ring, gives the more intuitive result.
```

should be removed. Thanks!
