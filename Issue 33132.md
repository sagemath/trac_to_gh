The dominant part of the runtime in the creation of general extensions is sometimes finding a root of the defining polynomial in the backend extension.  There are various well-known methods for doing this that Sage does not have implementations for: Hensel lifting in the p-adic case (it's available for rational polynomials), Panayi's root finding algorithm, single factor lifting.  We should implement some of these and profile to improve the runtime for root finding.
