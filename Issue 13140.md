Keywords: polyhedra, polar

The .polar() method of the Polyhedron class is incorrect, currently it returns the inversion of the correct answer.  This should be an easy thing to fix.

What do you and/or your colleagues actually want to do? I doubt that anybody *wants* tuples of tuples of tuples of nondescript integers thrown at them. This is both non-discoverable (no way to figure out what the integers mean) while at the same time very error-prone (accidentally use the index in the wrong list and you'll get hard-to-find bugs that yield the wrong result).

Right now the `PolyhedronFace` class isn't really complete, so presumably we need to flesh it more out so that you can get everything you need from the face.

Patch applies to sage-5.3.beta1, I'm building sage-5.3.rc0 now to see if there is any issue.

I thought about how to handle things and I'd like to
* Not make PolyhedronFace derive from polyhedron - can be confusing as not every `Polyhedron` method makes sense.
* The PolyhedronFace should have a `polyhedron()` method to get it as a polyhedron without reference to ambient
* Other methods `outward_normal()` or `offset_polyhedron()` (exploded?), `plot(color)` to implement what you want.
Thoughts?

Yooooooooooooo !!

I agree with this patch, though I don't understand one bit : why this change in `.polar` ?


```python
-  verts = [list(v.vector() - self.center()) for v in self.vertex_generator()]
+  verts = [list(self.center() - v.vector()) for v in self.vertex_generator()]
```


If it is just to have your example of code work, shouldn't you change the constructor instead ?

By the way, running `polytopes.n_cube(3).show()` just gives me a black Jmol window. I mean, empty. It's like the world is missing a cube.
