As the title says. The last of the SRG advertised in the database as coming "from a two-weight code".

OK, the last, I hope. How about (729  336  153  156 ), though? Sage says 
`...Penttila & Royle: projective 9-ary [42,3] code with weights 36, 39`

I'm about to start complaining that all these 2-weight codes should go to where they belong to, and we just get them from `sage.codes.whatever`.

Isn't that #19311?

And you would be right to. It takes a lifetime to compile this cython module, and most of it has no reason to be cython code. Would you feel like writing this two-code module in sage.coding? It is clear that it belongs there, but given that I still do not totally understand all the meaning of all parameters in a "projective 9-ary [42,3] code with weights 36, 39", I do not feel much at ease implementing and documenting all that...

isn't #19311 about something different -- two-intersection code(s)?

I recall having a long tread, either in email, or in some google groups, or on trac, where I explained (to myself mostly) the stuff on projective codes. I can't seem to locate it. Did I just dream about it? Or  perhaps you know where to find this?

It's up to you. I read somewhere that two-intersection codes were equivalent to two-weight codes.

I do not mind much myself, as long as the graph is generated.

HMmmmmmm... It does not ring a bell.. Can't tell, sorry.

OK, so if we knew this transformation, then no need for a new way to build graphs would be needed, right?

ah, it's on #18960. Good. (I checked my mailboxes, google groups, but not trac ;-))

And the library would be poorer as a result. Anyway: I think that they are equivalent, but I worry that building one from the other may take a *long* time (which of course does not matter in the theory).

This and #19350 need reviewer's name.

And this trac system needs automatic rejection for positive reviews without reviewer names.

I don't necessarily agree. In my experience, the easiest would be for Dima to finally learn that he has to fill his name where it belongs. And we are talking of powerful magic here.

It was quite daring of you to pick a researcher's career `:-P`
