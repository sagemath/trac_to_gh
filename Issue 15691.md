# Issue 15691: Typesetting errors in docstring of FiniteStateMachine._latex_transition_label_

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15928

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2014-03-12 17:00:17

CC:  skropf

Keywords: finite_state_machine

`''` was used instead of ```` in `FiniteStateMachine._latex_transition_label_`,
`Automaton._latex_transition_label_`, `Transducer._latex_transition_label_`.
    
In the latter, an `EXAMPLES::` was also missing.
