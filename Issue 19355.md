# Issue 19355: PPL Variables cannot be saved as .sobj

It seems impossible to save an object of the Parma Polyhedra Library's `Variable` class.

```
sage: from sage.libs.ppl import Variable
sage: x = Variable(0)
sage: x.save(os.path.join(SAGE_TMP, 'pplvariable'))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError: 'sage.libs.ppl.Variable' object has no attribute 'save'
```

After the switch to `pplpy`, already `save` fails:

```
sage: from ppl import Variable                                                                                                                                
sage: x = Variable(0)                                                                                                                                         
sage: save(x, os.path.join(SAGE_TMP, 'pplvariable'))                                                                                                          
TypeError: no default __reduce__ due to non-trivial __cinit__
```
