Do we want to just ignore all invalid keywords in `Parent` or will we want to make it a hard error after the deprecation period? I'm in favor of the latter, which means the deprecation message should not have the "and ignored" part.

An error of course.

> which means the deprecation message should not have the "and ignored" part.
