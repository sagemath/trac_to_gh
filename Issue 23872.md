Do we want to just ignore all invalid keywords in `Parent` or will we want to make it a hard error after the deprecation period? I'm in favor of the latter, which means the deprecation message should not have the "and ignored" part.

An error of course.

I meant to say that the option is _currently_ ignored. This is to contrast with the typical case for deprecation, where an option is still supported but deprecated. I can improve the wording if you wish.

Thank you. Before it just felt like the message was saying after the deprecation it would have been silently ignored.
