# Issue 17165: SR.power_series cannot handle symbolic series

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-11-26 13:50:22


```
sage: x=var('x')
sage: s=(1/(1-x)).series(x,6)
sage: ps=s.power_series(SR)
sage: ps
x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + Order(x^6) + 1 + O(x)
sage: ps=s.power_series(QQ)
...
TypeError: unable to convert 1 + 1*x + 1*x^2 + 1*x^3 + 1*x^4 + 1*x^5 + Order(x^6) to a rational
```

This is analogous to #16203 and can be worked around using `truncate()` but really should work out of the box.

The diff shown by the branch link of this ticket is different than what I get with `git trac pull` into develop. I hope this is just a trac problem.
