`sage.coding.linear_code` has a number of global functions and class methods which are badly named, badly documented, badly placed or badly conceived. This ticket takes some steps towards cleaning up. I'll update the ticket description once the full extend is clear.

Hello,

Thanks for cleaning up all this!

I only have a couple of remarks:

- There's a lone import statement at the bottom of `databases.py`. Is there any reason why it's here and not at the top of this file with the others?

- Same file, the first two methods do not have an `INPUT` block, while they do have some input arguments.

Otherwise, tests pass and documentation builds, everything seems to be properly deprecated, I agree with your changes.

BTW, it was not merging with the latest beta, fixed this and pushed my change.

Best,

David

It's not there to make the functional available to code in the module, but rather to make the function available on the command line as `codes.databases.<tab>`.

However, your comment made me realise that all the global imports at the top of `databases.py` are also present in that tab-completion. So now I've localised all of those.

> - Same file, the first two methods do not have an `INPUT` block, while they do have some input arguments.

I've added it.


> Otherwise, tests pass and documentation builds, everything seems to be properly deprecated, I agree with your changes.

Be aware that many of the tests in `databases.py` require the spkg
`gap_packages` or `internet`, and are not run by default with `./sage -t`. I
had forgotten this myself, but now made them run and fixed some import bugs.

> BTW, it was not merging with the latest beta, fixed this and pushed my change.

Thanks, and thanks for reviewing.

Best,
Johan

Hello,

Just found a broken doctest in one of the thematic tutorials (forgot to test that yesterday).
It was a trivial deprecation, fixed it myself and pushed the related change.
I'm fine with this ticket, so if you're fine with my change, you can set this ticket to positive
review.

Hello,

Fixed.
Or, to be more specific, I already fixed it. Commit [189d8e5](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=189d8e59744914fb14ff052436f53e59f3cb2927).
I pushed my branch once again, hopefully it will work this time.

BTW, I don't know what happened.
`git trac pull 21165` returned `already up-to-date with u/jsrn/21165_linear_code_cleanup`.
Which explains why I did not catch that failing doctest: it's fixed on my side...
