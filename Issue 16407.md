`LinearCode.cardinality()` comes up in tab completion, but it is not actually there. Where does it come from? We do not need to worry any more since it will now come from the `LinearCode` class itself.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16644

I believe it's because it's not a new style parent and it doesn't properly initialize its category:

```python
class LinearCode(module.Module_old):
    def __init__(self, gen_mat, d=None):
        ParentWithGens.__init__(self, base_ring)
```

and in `Module_old`:

```python
def category(self):
    """
    Return the category to which this module belongs.
    """
    # Defining a category method is deprecated for parents.
    # Instead, the category should be specified in the constructor.
    # See: http://sagetrac.org/sage_trac/wiki/CategoriesRoadMap
    if self._is_category_initialized():
        return Parent.category(self)
    from sage.categories.modules import Modules
    return Modules(self.base_ring())

AttributeError: 'LinearCode_with_category' object has no attribute 'element_class'
```



**Edit**: Also implemented `C.zero()` so that `C.sum()` works.

```
sage: C.zero_element()
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
sage: C.sum(()) # indirect doctest
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

So, we just need to figure out where this `element_class` is coming from and fix that.

Other than that, we can not depend on `cardinality` of the `FiniteEnumeratedSets`, even if it comes "for free".
