Keywords: comparison

According to its documentation, `mpz_cmp` yields arbitrary positive/negative numbers, but `rich_to_bool` assumes the input is in `[-1, 0, 1]`. Thus it yields wrong results:

```
sage: B.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(6)
sage: B(1) == B(-1)
False
sage: B(1) != B(-1)
False
```

ok, you can set to positive as soon as the lights are green

by the way, the related #28945 seems not to work with the latest beta. Maybe the same kind of issue ?
