CC:  @defeo @videlec

I have always found it hard to understand what the attributes `b` and `refers_to` mean. I propose:

1. Rename `b` to `chunck`.

2. Split `refers_to` in two because it is used in two independent ways: instead add `parent` and `index_cache` attributes.

3. Document this a lot better.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22471

Since this is moving `new_ref`, I'll take the occasion to ask whether `_new_ref` wouldn't be a better name. Isn't it the case that this is exclusively for internal purposes?

I would argue that it's part of the public Cython API (for example, it's used in the new `power_series_pari.pyx`), so it doesn't need to be private. Note that it's a `cdef` method, so it will not bother TAB-completion.

No, no. The argument on `new_ref` being used by power series is a good one. I hadn't read the diff that far.

The Py3 failure must be dealt with, however.

About the py3 failure:

This is OK since Cython understands `xrange`:

```
            inds = xrange(*n.indices(l))
```


This comes from the dependency which is merged now (there is no `cmp` in the current diff):

```
            sage: cmp(pari('2/3'), pari('2/5'))
```


So there is nothing to be done here...

Mmm... right. But is it going to support it in the long run? I cannot find much info on what Cython plans are. What's the most future proof way of using iterators in Cython?
