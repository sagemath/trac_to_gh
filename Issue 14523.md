# Issue 14523: manual dependency tracking in src/sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14727

Original creator: felixs

Original creation time: 2013-06-12 08:24:13

Assignee: felixs

CC:  jondo

Keywords: dependencies, cython, module_list.py, gsoc

module_list.py contains manual dependencies. for example

"""depends = [SAGE_INC + '/ecl/ecl.h']"""

this will not work reliably if ecl is somewhere else.

it looks like dependencies are not tracked automatically. if that is the case, the build system is severely incomplete.

I think you'll find this throughout all of the Sage build system (in spkgs, etc.) is that certain dependencies' locations are hard-coded.

this is covered by #14834. didn't find a way to fix it independently.
