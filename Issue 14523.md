Assignee: felixs

CC:  jondo

Keywords: dependencies, cython, module_list.py, gsoc

module_list.py contains manual dependencies. for example

"""depends = [SAGE_INC + '/ecl/ecl.h']"""

this will not work reliably if ecl is somewhere else.

it looks like dependencies are not tracked automatically. if that is the case, the build system is severely incomplete.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14727

I think you'll find this throughout all of the Sage build system (in spkgs, etc.) is that certain dependencies' locations are hard-coded.
