Shouldn't the doc


```
Return the vector of the first `n` primes, the primes in the
interval `[n, end]` or the list of primes up to `end`.
```


read


```
Return the pari vector of the first `n` primes, the primes in the
interval `[n, end]` or the pari vector of primes up to `end`.
```


instead?
