# Issue 26890: py3: avoid .vertices() in method ear_decomposition

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27127

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-01-25 14:50:59

Keywords: py3, graph

We avoid using `.vertices()` in this method and fix a failing doctest for py3.

Why this change:

```diff
-            sage: g = graphs.CubeGraph(2)
+            sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
             sage: g.ear_decomposition()
-            [['00', '01', '11', '10', '00']]
+            [[0, 3, 2, 1, 0]]
```

This change is independent of using `.vertices()` or not.
This doctest was failing with py3. My understanding is that neighbors of a vertex are visited in different orders in py2 and py3 as the order in which elements of a set are listed might differ (see `G._backend.iterator_nbrs??`). Here, if the first visited neighbor of `'00'` is `'01'` or `'10'`, we get different answers. With py3 we get `[This is the Trac macro *'00', '10', '11', '01', '00'* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#'00', '10', '11', '01', '00'-macro)` and so the doctest was  failing.

Using `CycleGraph(4)`, the doctest is more stable and we get the same answer with py2 and py3. `CubeGraph(2)` is a cycle of order 4, so it's essentially the same test.

I don't think it is any more stable of a test, just something that happens to work on both. Anyways, this is okay with me since there is not such an easy way out of this.
