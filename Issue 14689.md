# Issue 14689: P.root_field() for p-adic polynomials should return a p-adic field

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Assignee: roed

Keywords: root_field

At the moment, the following code

```
    R.<x>=PolynomialRing(Qp(2));
    P=2*x^2+1;
    K.<a>=P.root_field();
```

returns a univariate polynomial quotient ring object. It should return a p-adic field object, consistently with the case of `root_field` for polynomials.

Changing keywords from "root_field" to "root_field, sd87".

When trying to run this example, we get the following:


```
ValueError: negative valuation
```


This error occurs in the calling of `extension` by `root_field`. At the moment, there is no implementation of extensions for polynomials with coefficients of negative valuation. (See #20073: the polynomial gets divided by its leading coefficient if it's not monic.)
