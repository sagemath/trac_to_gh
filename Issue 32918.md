Installation of pplpy fails:

```
ERROR: pplpy-0.8.6-cp39-cp39-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform." 
```

(`wheel` uses this tag based on the inspection of the deployment targets of the built dynamic libraries - this is done in https://github.com/pypa/wheel/blob/main/src/wheel/macosx_libfile.py)

The wheel tagged such then does not pass the compatibility test because of:
