When creating a graph from a list of edges, if the edges are not labelled they get doubled when multiedges are allowed.  It works fine if they are labelled.


```
sage: g=Graph([[1,2],[1,2,],[2,3]])
sage: g.num_edges()
6
sage: g=Graph([[1,2,'a'],[1,2,'b'],[2,3,'c']])
sage: g.num_edges()
3
```

This ticket definitely isn't needing a review as there is no patch attached. Should it be removed as a duplicated as was done before ?

I think I read somewhere that I should set milestone as duplicate and then make it needs_review so that someone else can actually close it.  It should be closed with extreme prejudice.

Oh right, right, closing tickets is the release manager's exclusive right, but if this one is to be closed the best may be to send him an email `:-)`
