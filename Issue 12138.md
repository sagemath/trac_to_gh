Reported to the notebook people, therefore see #11080.

Erm, I'm probably missing something obvious, but I don't see this on github, google code, or the sage-notebook mailing list. Where did you report it?

Also it looks like the port is set in `$SAGE_LOCAL/sage-notebook`, which is part of Sage, and not sagenb.

It shouldn't.  This is a separate bug.

I sent an email to Jason, mainly because I don't know the correct place to report these things.  I'm hoping for #12229 to get fixed and to clarify this.

I see. I think this bug should not be closed until its equivalent under the sagenb project is somewhere publicly visible, but I defer to your judgment. I think the correct place right now is on the github issue tracker, https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/ .
