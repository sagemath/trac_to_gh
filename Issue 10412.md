This is a meta-ticket for tracking some changes related to the adjoint and adjugate of a matrix.

See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/623226316555c28e for the discussion.

Plan:

  1. Deprecate `adjoint` in favor of `adjugate`
  1. Implement `conjugate_transpose`
  1. Implement T, H, I properties
  1. Wait for adjoint to become available
  1. Implement a more general `adjoint` based on relationships with inner products

Be sure to add some notes to the documentation to resolve any confusion about what the word "adjoint" means.

Feel free to comment here, or on the sage-devel thread, as appropriate.
