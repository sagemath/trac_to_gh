Keywords: reflection groups,days 93.51

For every irreducible character \chi of a complex reflection group W, we define the Coxeter number c_{\chi} as the trace of \sum(1-t) where t runs over all reflections of W.

This was first considered by Malle, where it appeared as part of a palindromicity property of fake degrees of characters.
