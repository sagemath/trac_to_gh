# Issue 34170: Refactor lazy series code so that it works over any graded ring

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34407

Keywords: lazy power series

With very simple modifications, the code for `LazySymmetricFunctions` can be extended to work over any lazy graded ring.

There is a bit left over specific to symmetric functions as tensor products of `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis` do not yet know they are graded:

```
sage: Cat = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().Graded()
sage: Cat.TensorProducts()
Category of tensor products of algebras with basis over Rational Field
```

I want to keep the code ready for when that is fixed.

I also implement a hook `formal_series_ring()` for parents in `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis()` as an easy way to access this without adding anything to the global namespace. I thought about calling it `completion()`, but that is vague as there could be more than one reasonable completion.

All of this is rather exciting for me!

This might make it easier to implement the Burnside ring, too!
