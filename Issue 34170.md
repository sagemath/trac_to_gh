Keywords: lazy power series

With very simple modifications, the code for `LazySymmetricFunctions` can be extended to work over any graded ring to do computations in their completion of formal linear combinations with finite sums in each graded piece.

There is a bit left over specific to symmetric functions as tensor products of `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis` do not yet know they are graded:

```
sage: Cat = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().Graded()
sage: Cat.TensorProducts()
Category of tensor products of algebras with basis over Rational Field
```
I want to keep the code ready for when that is fixed.

I also implement a hook `formal_series_ring()` for parents in `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis()` as an easy way to access this without adding anything to the global namespace. I thought about calling it `completion()`, but that is vague as there could be more than one reasonable completion.
