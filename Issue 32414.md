This is a pretty large module, consisting of 11 kLOC.

We could split it into several modules, each defining an intermediate class (like it is done in `sage.matrix.matrix0, matrix1, matrix2`).

For example,
- a module `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base_convex` could contain the implementation of the methods defined by the `ConvexSet_base` API
- a module `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base_lattice` could contain all methods that have to do with lattice points in polyhedra
- a module `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base_graphs` could contain all methods whose implementation needs `sage.graphs.graphs` -- this would help with modularization because then we could conditionalize the doctests via a file-level directive (#30778)

Is this done with #33583? What did you have in mind with "This could also lead to an improvement of the documentation."?

That's a great ticket! ... I'm not dead. I expect to be "back on trac" soon!

I would be up for improving the doc and complement it further... I'll slowly go through all this new stuff in polyhedron this Summer.

Thanks for all the work!

It's done except we didn't get around to do "an improvement of the documentation" (comment:13) -- in the course of which we would surely have noticed that the documentation for all of this is no longer being built (#25675).
