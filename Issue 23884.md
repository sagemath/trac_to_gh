CC:  embray

psutil compilation fails with

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 253, in <module>
    macros.append(("_WIN32_WINNT", get_winver()))
  File "setup.py", line 249, in get_winver
    maj = int(m.group('major'))
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
```


because the regexp to detect windows version in `setup.py` is not adapted to my windows version, which is as follows:


```
PS C:\Users\Sebastien> cmd /c ver

Microsoft Windows [version 10.0.16299.19]
```

which is why I haven't seen this.  For some reason your Windows version has an additional component not accounted for in that regexp.

I already [fixed](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/pull/998/commits/a33c43ca59fd1b5327402a637a5c02b32976ed86) this issue some time ago in my psutil Cygwin port, but never updated the patch to psutil included with Sage.  I guess it would be good to do that then.

FWIW, I just got bitten by this. From a cygwin prompt :

```
charpent@DESKTOP-P0B7HOE ~/sage
$ cmd /c ver

Microsoft Windows [version 10.0.16299.19]
```


Since this seems to block Sage from successfully compiling on windows, I'd be tempted to raise the priority of this bug to "blocker".

I get two errors :
