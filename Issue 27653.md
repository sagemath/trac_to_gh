# Issue 27653: Fix a pickling error for codes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27890

Original creator: klee

Original creation time: 2019-05-29 06:34:36

Pickling does not work correctly for codes:


```
sage: C = codes.HammingCode(GF(2), 3)
sage: C.decoders_available()
['InformationSet', 'NearestNeighbor', 'Syndrome']
sage: save(C, 'obj')
```


but in a fresh sage run,


```
sage: D = load('obj')
sage: D.decoders_available()
[]
```
