CC:  embray fbissey isuruf arojas mkoeppe

the external install should have `glpsol` and `libglpk`

On debian they are in `glpk-utils` and `libglpk-dev` packages.

`4ti2` needs to know its prefix (or probably just `--with-glpk` should be there;

`cvxopt` needs to know the (non-standard) include directory and
library directory of `glpk`, so they should be made blank 
for the stanard locations.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28459

Same for Arch. Given that 4.65 is 1.5 years old and most distros are shipping it already, IMO it would be best to update sage's glpk first before dealing with this.
