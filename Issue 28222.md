the external install should have `glpsol` and `libglpk`

On debian they are in `glpk-utils` and `libglpk-dev` packages.

`4ti2` needs to know its prefix (or probably just `--with-glpk` should be there;

`cvxopt` needs to know the (non-standard) include directory and
library directory of `glpk`, so they should be made blank 
for the stanard locations.

Does anyone know a system that does not carry Sage's GLPK patch?
(I guess Debian does, right?)

Changing keywords from "" to "spkg-configure".

Debian 10 carries GLPK 4.65, and 4 tests in `src/sage/numerical/backends/glpk_backend.pyx` fail due to minor formating differences, e.g. extra blank line...

Same for Arch. Given that 4.65 is 1.5 years old and most distros are shipping it already, IMO it would be best to update sage's glpk first before dealing with this.

I've put the update to glpk 4.65 on #24824

On #24824 I've also adjusted tests so ithat only one test fails with Debian's glpk 4.65, which does not apply one of Sage's patches, `glpk/patches/error_recovery.patch`. 

(And in fact the still failing test can be switched off or changed into something that does not need the patch in question).

here I keep minimal requirement version of glpk to be 4.63. This results in few failing tests, all just from glpk 4.63 being too chatty in logging, nothing serious.

Looks good to me in principle though I haven't tested yet.  I'll try to test later this week.  Thanks!
