Transitive graph. Edge-transitive graph. I honestly did not think I would end up with such a nice drawing `:-)`

Great, a new graph! :) But this time I cannot review it immediately, as I am going to the airport soon to catch a flight across the Pacific to go to Bug Days 19... so I will be offline for two days or so. Sorry to make you wait!

OK!! Time to review! :) I've made a reviewer patch, which I will attach after I make this comment. Besides the usual reformatting, I also removed a comma from the exception message, and changed the name of the function from `BiggsSmith()` to `BiggsSmithGraph()`. I guess I don't have a strong opinion about which name is better, but if you use `BiggsSmith()` then we should change all the other graph names for consistency, and that is infeasible, so for now, let's just keep it as `BiggsSmithGraph()`.

If you agree with my review patch, then we can change it to positive review. :)
