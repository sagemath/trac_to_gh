I guess I don't have a strong opinion about which name is better, but if you use `BiggsSmith()` then we should change all the other graph names for consistency, and that is infeasible, so for now, let's just keep it as `BiggsSmithGraph()`.\n\nIf you agree with my review patch, then we can change it to positive review. :)",
