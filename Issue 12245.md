Keywords: partial fraction decomposition multivariate polynomial ring

Code to the compute a partial fraction decomposition of any elements of a fraction field of a multivariate polynomial rings over a field. Extends the existing sage.categories.quotient_fields function partial_fraction_decomposition().

Imports fail in decompose_via_algebraic_dependence().

gets you further. There was indeed an import missing, I wonder why we didn't catch this before?

Also posted notes at http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4740 about the mathematical background of the multivariate partial fraction decompositions involved. These are referenced in the patch.

I'd like to discard this ticket, because the patch's functionality has been subsumed by the patch for http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10519.
