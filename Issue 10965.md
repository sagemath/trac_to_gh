# Issue 10965: digraphs.RandomDirectedGNM

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11099

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2011-03-31 11:05:47

Assignee: jason, ncohen, rlm

We have graphs.RandomGNP and graphs.RandomGNM but the GNM version is missing for directed graphs.

This is an implementation which will be faster once the .complement() method of SparseGraph will have been reimplemented...

The current function works fine. However, it would be suitable to allow the generation of random digraphs with loops (I use such digraphs).

Thanks.

Hello !

Here is an updated patch, that supports loops. This being said, the custom on Sage's trac server is more to provide a patch yourself if you think a feature you need should be added (and to join the reviewer's patch to the ticket when fitting) `:-p`

Ok, by email David told me that he had a more efficient version of this method, using dictionaries to cache the edges and improve the ``has_edge`` test. 

to David : I hope you will like this new version. While I was at it, I also looked a bit into random number generation, and ... well.. There was some speedup hidden there too :-)

The code comes with its comments.

After a few comments from David by email  :
    * There was a weird "80" somewhere in the comments
    * binary only means boolean in linear programs, not in the documentation `:-D`

Updaaaaaaaaaaated !

Can you make the updated version available. So far I still see the "binary" instead of "boolean" line 474 and the "80" line 571.

David.

The last version of the patch is working fine and definitively faster than the previous versions. The doc is OK.

My review is thus positive.

Thanks Nathann.

Nono, it's me, it's me ! It's a pleasure to code when the patches are reviewed that quickly `:-D`
