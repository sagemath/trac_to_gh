I just installed pcre on my Mac with `./configure; make; make install`, and I get a doctest failure with `stats/r.py`. If I instead emulate the installation of the Sage `pcre` package and use `./configure --enable-utf --enable-unicode-properties --enable-jit` followed by `make; make install`, everything works. Should the `.m4` file test for the appropriate feature of the system's `pcre` rather than just the presence of the library?

No, I mean to say that I downloaded a tarball for pcre and ran `./configure; make; make install`, expecting that the default settings for `./configure` would be sensible, but instead they lead to the doctest failure I mentioned.
