GH Actions tests a few 32-bit systems.

On `ubuntu-bionic-i386` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1615246784?check_suite_focus=true), `libsemigroups` is OK.

On `centos-7-i386` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1615246935?check_suite_focus=true), compilation of `libsemigroups` fails, but this is the same error as on 64 bit `centos-7` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1615246513?check_suite_focus=true) and is caused by an outdated compiler.
