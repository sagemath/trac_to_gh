```
sage: F = Family([0, 1, 4, 9])
sage: F[2]
4
sage: F[2:]
(4, 9)
```

This happens to work because it is passed on to `list.__item__`.
But:

```
sage: F = Family({0:0, 1:1, 2:4, 3:9})
sage: F[2]
4
sage: F[2:]
TypeError: unhashable type: 'slice'
```

It's a natural feature to wish. Yet one difficulty is what semantic do we want for `F[i:j]`, given that `F[i]` does not return the i-th element, but the element indexed by i?. Should this be the i-th to j-1-th element of the family? Or all elements with index k such that i<=k<j? In the latter case, for which order?

Yes, raising an `IndexError` if an element indexed by k is not present. In the order of increasing indices.

I am not sure about half-open slices. For example, what is the expected result of this?


```
sage: F = Family({0:0, 2:4, 3:9, 10:10})
sage: F[2:]
```


I would probably expect an error, as the keys `4..9` are missing, but it is not possible to obtain this information efficiently from the dictionary.

I don't expect that to be an error, but instead return `[4, 9, 10]` or maybe `Family({2:4, 3:9, 10:10})`.

What you are essentially asking for is a slice of a `dict`. However, I don't think this makes a lot of sense.

I think this is fine when the `Family` object is list-like, but in general, I doubt it is possible to get something consistent.

> I don't expect that to be an error, but instead return `[4, 9, 10]` or maybe `Family({2:4, 3:9, 10:10})`.

Indeed, it might be better if it does not raise an error, especially if the example from the description is an intended use case in which a slice is used to restrict the support of an element in `CombinatorialFreeModule`.

This is also consistent with ordinary use of slices, as the following does not throw an error either:

```
sage: [0,1,2][0:10]
[0, 1, 2]
```


> Also, what do you do when the keys are not (and cannot be) ordered?

I think it is fine to focus on the case in which the keys are integers for now.
