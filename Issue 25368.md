# Issue 25368: Add back CombinatorialClass.__len__

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25605

For unclear reasons, `CombinatorialClass.__len__` raises an `AttributeError`. This is causing trouble on Python 3, which seems to call `__len__` more often. Instead, we just remove `__len__` completely.

This indeed seems to fix the issue on python3. I have launched my bots for python2
