Cleaner and faster option in `fast_mul_long` that avoid coercions

```
- return parent_c(a)(0)
+ try:
+     return parent_c(a).zero()
+ except AttributeError:
+     return parent_c(a)(0)
```


Related note: It would be much better if this code for multiplication was closer to `generic_power_c` in `sage.structure.element`. And by the way, it would be cool to have a `generic_power_long_c`.

The change is not only **important** but **needed**! And it would be cool to have a comment saying why, i.e. `-LONG_MIN = LONG_MIN` for longs.

The improvement for the 0 case is not an improvement for elliptic curves since the group does not implement the method `zero`... but this is a different story.

Good to me!
