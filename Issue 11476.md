When trying to contour_plot a function that can return non-real numbers, such as 


```
sage: contour_plot(log(x) + log(y), (-1000, 1000), (-1000, 1000))
```


the following error is returned:


```
TypeError: can't convert complex to float
```


Sage should print a warning and skip over the those points. This is the way R behaves.

I don't know how, but it seems that this was fixed sometime. It now skips non-real points. Can someone close this ticket? Thanks.

Nope!  Now we need a patch that adds a doctest in that file that confirms that this one doesn't return an error.  I think you know how to do this, right?

Can you try some other possible contour plots like that, to make sure it wasn't just this particular one that did it?  What does the graph look like?  (You should be able to attach a png file and then refer to it here with the wiki syntax.)

Sure! I do know how to do this, but Mercurial queues are so aggravating that I'm going to have to put it off until I have time to re-learn them.

I did try several different functions. Attached is the example given in the description.

Seems like a reasonable pic.

Totally don't do Mercurial queues, it's not worth it unless you're going to be doing a lot of development; for once-off stuff it's not needed, especially if there is only one patch involved.

Okay.

Another issue is whether the real part of the complex number should be plotted, like [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log%28x%29+%2B+log%28y%29) does.

Thanks. Your wording is more precise, but I really don't want to waste a few hours rebuilding sage if I re-checkout this branch to make the change. (Release manager, or anyone else, feel free.)
