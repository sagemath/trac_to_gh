Tim Abbott has posted a new spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/tabbott/quaddouble-2.3.4.p1.spkg

but it needs testing on non-Linux.

Cheers,

Michael

The latest release is the 2.3.6 release. We should really update for the 64 bit OSX port.

Cheers,

Michael

Since we are removing quaddouble from Sage (see #3762) I am closing this as a "wontfix".

Cheers,
