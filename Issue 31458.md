We prepare a prototype package based on `sagemath-categories`, similar to `sagemath-linbox` (#31444), which packages everything related to the `SR`, with minimal dependencies.

We use it for the Continuous Integration workflow of `pynac`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31695
