Currently, `SAGE_CYTHONIZED` is used by `src/sage/env.py` to determine some include directories while building Sage.

Since we want to get rid of `SAGE_CYTHONIZED` (#21535), a first step would be to move this bit to `setup.py` in order to concentrate all uses of `SAGE_CYTHONIZED` in one place.

I wonder what would happen if we also went ahead and deleted line 110 of sage.env:


```
_add_variable_or_fallback('SAGE_CYTHONIZED', opj('$SAGE_ROOT', 'src', 'build', 'cythonized'))
```


That could wait 'til a later change though.   Looks good to me otherwise.  I agree this is a good first step to removing it entirely.

Some doctests in `src/sage_setup` use that.
