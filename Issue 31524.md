# Issue 31524: Stop loading all installed GAP packages

On a fresh run of the GAP interface, Sage caches a GAP workspace which loads every single GAP package on the system. While this might be OK with Sage's trimmed-down version of gap_packages, if using a system GAP install 
with all optional packages installed this can take a massive amount of memory (~1GB with all packages included in the 4.11.1 tarball), which in many casses surpasses the default gap_memory_pool_size value, causing crashes. This will become a common issue once #29644 is merged.

Possible solutions:
1) Don't preload packages in Sage and let GAP load its default list of packages
2) Load a hardcoded list of packages (such as those installed by the gap and gap_packages spkg's)

The second solution is essentially reverting https://github.com/sagemath/sage/commit/b9949212d7fd97e3e3b248fb969f0a18ef68a359
