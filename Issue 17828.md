CC:  tmonteil slabbe

We let .value() for continued fractions return a real lazy field element when there is no other possibilities. For example

```
sage: cf = continued_fraction(words.ThueMorseWord([1,2]))
sage: cf
[1; 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2...]
sage: v = cf.value()
sage: v
1.422388736882786?
sage: v.parent()
Real Lazy Field
sage: v.n(digits=30)
1.42238873688278548834154711602
```
