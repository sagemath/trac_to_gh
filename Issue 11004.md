The following patch fixes sage.misc.sage_unittest.InstanceTester to call it's base's __init__ as requested by the documentation of unittest.TestCase. This was harmless with Python 2.6, but breaks e.g. assertEqual with the new version of unittest in Python 2.7.

It prove effective on python-2.7 enabled sage. I will test it as well on a vanilla sage to make sure there are no side effects (there shouln't be). Thanks for the patch, it really brings us very close to sage running on python-2.7.
