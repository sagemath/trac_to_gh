Appears to me that your "extra" vector is already in the kernel as a linear combination of the basis vectors provided by Sage?  

```
sage: r = vector(GF(2), [1,1,1,1,1])  
sage: r*K

As far as I understood, "kernel" returns a matrix space with a basis. Every element k in K.list() gives "0" vector (M*k).

However, there is no information in the documentation ([http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_linalg.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_linalg.html)) regarding this.

`.kernel()` gives a vector space, not a matrix space.

`.matrix()` provides a matrix whose rows are a basis of the vector space.

`.list()` for a matrix might gives the rows, or something (unchecked).

"Every element k in K.list() gives "0" vector (M*k)."  As it should be.  But your ticket implies you think the converse should be true.  This would be impractical for matrices over an infinite ring.

Did you try listing the actual vectors of the kernel itself, not the matrix?  Not sure if that will behave as expected or not.  Perhaps so?
