```
sage: (x+x^2).series(x, 2).operator() is None
True
```

The topmost operator in  symbolic series `pseries` is not a registered function, but it can be seen in the expression tree:

```
sage: (x+x^2).series(x, 2)._dbgprinttree()
pseries @0x4e2c3b0, hash=0x0, flags=0x3
    1 (numeric) @0x35d70d0, hash=0x0, flags=0x7
    1 (numeric) @0x35d70d0, hash=0x0, flags=0x7
    -----
    function Order @0x4c197f0, serial=12, hash=0x0, flags=0x3, nops=1
        1 (numeric) @0x35d70d0, hash=0x0, flags=0x7
        =====
    2 (numeric) @0x35d7130, hash=0x0, flags=0x7
    -----
    x (symbol) @0x3e5d6d0, serial=5, hash=0xf4f4bfee, flags=0xf, domain=0, iflags=0000000000000000
    0 (numeric) @0x3647180, hash=0x0, flags=0x7
```


You can see that the function `Order` is there too. `GiNaC::Order` is registered in Pynac and imported to Sage (`symbolic/ginac.pxd`). But it somehow doesn't get into Sage's registry `sfunction_serial_dict` which is created and used in `symbolic/function.pyx`.

This was because `Order` was not registered. Should be fixed now.

Passes tests in selected directories. As soon as a patchbot run passes this can be set positive.
