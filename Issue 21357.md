Looks like this will become a very good addition to Sage. I think your choice of `catalog_partitions.py` is the best place in the doc. Some quick comments:

- In Sage, we have the triple quotes on their own line, so you should revert this change:
  {{{#!diff
  class SkewTableau(ClonableList):
-    """
-    A skew tableau.
+    """A skew tableau.
  }}}
  as well as convert the others.
- In `from_chain`, it should be `EXAMPLES::`.
- `_shape_from_labels` could be an ``@`abstract_method` and needs a doctest irregardless. (I typically do an example for a subclass which demonstrates the expected behavior.)
- `out_labels` and `in_labels` need doctests.
- When you just pass the same args to the base class `__init__`, you don't need to define an `__init__` (e.g., `GrowthDiagramRSK`).

Oh, thanks!  I somehow didn't see that I really don't do anything but passing the arguments...

Related question: should I replace the (soft) requirement to implement `_shape_from_labels` with the (soft) requirement to implement the rank function of the dual graded graphs?  ("soft" means that not implementing this doesn't render the whole thing useless, just less practical: without it, one has to provide the shape of the region always.)

The downside is: it might be that the covering relation is easier than the rank function...  Moreover, if we want to check the argument `labels`, we need the two covering relations, not just the rank.

On the other hand, it would be much less code.

Questions for the reviewer...

Background:

The main object underlying the algorithm is the "dual graded graph", that is, a pair of graded digraphs on the same set of vertices, with the same rank function, satisfying some relations (mainly: `DU = UD + rI`, where `U` means "up" in one graph and `D` is down in the other graph).

However, the code is intended mostly for experimenting with growth diagrams.  In particular, it should be as easy as possible to define new rules. Thus it is important that nothing is enforced, unless needed.  For example, it is perfectly OK to define only `_forward_rule`, and leave all of `_rank_function`, `_covers_1` , `_covers_2`, `_zero` and `_backward_rule` undefined.  The only consequence should be that in this case some features will raise an error.

Moreover, I believe that the RSK growth diagrams aren't growth diagrams in the strict sense of the word: I think it makes more sense to say that they are destandardizations of growth diagrams on Young's lattice.  Thus, I certainly do not want to be strict.

So, all of what follows is probably cosmetics.

1) should `_rank_function`, `_covers_1` , `_covers_2`, `_zero`, `_forward_rule` and `_backward_rule` be `staticmethod`s instead of attributes?

2) if these become methods, I think we should make them public, too, right?

3) it would be nice to be able to define a growth diagram completely interactively, by just specifying, for example, the forward rule.  I tried:

```
sage: from growth import GrowthDiagramOnPartitions
sage: class MyG(GrowthDiagramOnPartitions):
....:     @staticmethod
....:     def _forward_rule(a, b, c, d):
....:         pass
....:     
sage: MyG._forward_rule = GrowthDiagramDomino._forward_rule
sage: MyG([1])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
TypeError: _forward_rule() takes exactly 4 arguments (5 given)
```

so this doesn't work.  Should we have a function `growth_diagram(forward_rule=None, backward_rule=None)` that returns a class?  Or is there a more practical way to interactively redefine methods of a class?

Dear Darij!

Many thanks for your encouragement and the improvements of the documentation, especially for the `x`'s!

I do not know of a single source containing all the known rules, the references are what I accumulated over the years.  In fact, I'm quite sure I'm missing some.

However, for each rule I implemented, I gave a reference - as precisely as the article allows - in the corresponding methods `_forward_rule` and `_backward_rule`.

I just noticed that doing `GrowthDiagramRSK?` is not all that helpful, it only displays

```
   A class modelling Robinson-Schensted-Knuth insertion.

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: pi = Permutation([2,3,6,1,4,5])
      sage: G = GrowthDiagramRSK(pi)
      sage: G.P_symbol(), G.Q_symbol()
      ([[1, 3, 4, 5], [2, 6]], [[1, 2, 3, 6], [4, 5]])
      sage: RSK(pi)
      [[[1, 3, 4, 5], [2, 6]], [[1, 2, 3, 6], [4, 5]]]
```

which should not come as a surprise, but it did.  Somehow I thought that the parent's documentation would be included...

(besides: instead some documentation for `LazyImport` is displayed, three times in fact, which is annoying and stupid)

So, what should I do to make sage display the documentation of the parent class `GrowthDiagram`?  I certainly do not want to duplicate it in every subclass, it is always the same and rather long!  `automethod`?

Replying to [comment:65 chapoton]:
> +Missing doctests in combinat/growth.py: 35 / 40 = 87%

I think they are not really missing, it's a misfeature of the coverage tool:

```
Missing doctests:
     * line 208: def __init__(self, filling=None, shape=None, labels=None)
```

This is the init of an abstract class.

```
Missing documentation:
     * line 1014: def __init__(self, filling=None, shape=None, labels=None)
     * line 1165: def __init__(self, filling=None, shape=None, labels=None)
     * line 1411: def __init__(self, filling=None, shape=None, labels=None)
     * line 1554: def __init__(self, filling=None, shape=None, labels=None)
```

These get their documentation set explicitely in the following lines.
