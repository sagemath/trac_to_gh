Although subclasses of `ConvexSet_base` are not necessarily `Parent`s, it will be useful for them to provide `an_element` and `some_elements` methods.

The only little quip I have is that generally in Sage `some_elements()` returns a list rather than an iterable. It might be good to be consistent about this.

Patchbot is green modulo the unrelated `sage.misc.package` test failure.
Merged latest #31959 to get rid of pyflakes' report on an unused import.
