# Issue 26643: Deprecate calling IdentityMorphism with arguments

Issue created by migration from Trac.

`IdentityMorphism._call_with_args` uses some internals of parents such as `_element_init_pass_parent`. We could fix this, but really I wonder why `IdentityMorphism` needs to support arguments in the first place. So let's deprecate that.
