I can upload the correct binary if you can tell me where to get it...

Please avoid large attachments as they end up in the trac database forever...

That file has yet another checksum:

```
$ sha1sum libhomfly-1.0r1.tar.gz 
ac05f7f2ad0ec3cf42b452bcc3fbf77b43f86ac4  libhomfly-1.0r1.tar.gz
```

That's not too surprising, as it also has a different name...

Another one is here: [https://trac.sagemath.org/raw-attachment/ticket/18047/libhomfly-1.0.tar.gz](https://trac.sagemath.org/raw-attachment/ticket/18047/libhomfly-1.0.tar.gz)

(There are even two tarballs attached to that ticket.)

That one has the correct checksum. You will need to wait for propagation to mirrors....

Replying to [comment:7 vbraun]:

At least the correct one is on files.sagemath.org now.

(By the way, [Jeroen reported this four weeks ago](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18047#comment:63), or perhaps the tarball changed again for some reason.)

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).

Resolution: wontfix
