`generic_graph.py` contains several functions where documentation says that there are several algorithms available. However there is no explanation of their difference. Is some faster, other uses less memory? Better for sparse/dense graphs?

As an example `flow()` has three algorithm and no clear explanation when to choose `FF` or `LP`.

A possible explanation is that we have absolutely no idea of which is best in which situations, and so merely inform the users that (s)he should try them on his/her instances to find out.

Let's start from `wiener_index()`. I have no idea about what it does.

What is the difference between 'Floyd-Warshall-Cython' and 'BFS'? By default "Sage chooses the best algorithm: 'BFS' for unweighted graphs" -- so when should 'Floyd-Warshall-Cython' be used?

OK, I did a suggestion of documenting this. Now the last question for this: Is it really so that for one algorithm "no negative weight is allowed" and another "works only with positive weights", i.e. they have difference with zeros?

And then to `triangles_count()`... This will take some time.

As Nathann vanished I suppose that this is not going to get more progress any time soon. Hence we can close this.

Frédéric, maybe you can review this as it makes no harm to add this. Only documentation change in one function.
