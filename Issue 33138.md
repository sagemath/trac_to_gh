Best not to put more into `sage.misc.misc` - I'm in the process of removing environment bits from it (see for example #32986). I would suggest to just put it in a separate module `sage.misc.dot_sage`.

Still comment:2, and moreover I think `sage.misc.dot_sage` should use `sage.env`, not the other way around. Note that `var` defined in `sage.env` not only gets values from environment variables but also from `sage_conf`.

I think we can change the location of `DOT_SAGE` on Cygwin to be unconditionally `/home/.sage` to disentangle it from the "space in directory name" warning.

If "dot_sage" uses "DOT_SAGE" from "sage.env", then once again we are doing twice the job of deciding which folder to use as ".sage". The logic is rather unclear to me.

Shouldn't "DOT_SAGE" in `env` be deprecated, or at least have a comment explaining that `dot_sage` should be used whenever possible?

I'm also not sure if the misc package is the right place, since similar refactorings could (and should) be done for all path-variables in `env` so one would end-up with quite a few helper modules in `misc`.

Not really. Most of these paths are low-level information for which we already have a high-level interface in `sage.features`. For example `CONWAY_POLYNOMIALS_DATA_DIR` is exposed via `src/sage/features/databases.py`.
