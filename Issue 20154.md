CC:  cremona

Keywords: hyperelliptic curve, number of points

The following is currently broken:

```
sage: x = polygen(GF(4099))
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x^6 + x + 1)
sage: H.count_points(1)
...
ValueError: Q must be a monic polynomial of odd degree >= 3
```

The problem is that ultimately this is trying to call hypellfrob, which is only implemented for odd degree polynomials. One can patch around this using either PARI's hyperellcharpoly or the naive point counting code.

In the longer term, some more intelligent switching needs to be implemented for this method, as well as the related zeta_function and zeta_series methods; these do not all optimize the same way. See #965, #16931, #18916, #20309 for related discussions.

As reported by cremona, this is not completely resolved by #18916 after all. This call syntax should also be covered:

```
sage: F=GF(23) 
sage: x=polygen(F) 
sage: C=HyperellipticCurve(x^8+1) 
sage: C.cardinality()
... 
ValueError: Q must be a monic polynomial of odd degree >= 3

This is ultimately a dispatching issue: the code in #18916 includes some updated decision-making about what algorithm to use, but the `cardinality` method doesn't currently route through this decision point. This should be easy to fix!

Apparently what I did for `count_points` was the trivial patch: in the even-degree case, just drop down to counting points. This is of course not the correct solution long-term, but it does fix the reported bug. Anyway, I copied that trivial fix over to `cardinality`.
