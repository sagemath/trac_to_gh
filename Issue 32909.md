I see a lot of `...site-packages/sage/sets/non_negative_integers.py:83: UserWarning: Resolving lazy import FacadeSets during startup\n  Parent.__init__(self, facade = ZZ, category = InfiniteEnumeratedSets().or_subcategory(category) )` when I test this, haven't seen this before (but I'm testing it on top of some other tickets)
