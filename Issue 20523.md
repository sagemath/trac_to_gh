I've added (what I believe is) a way to compute the mirror image directly using the braid (unless I was suppose to invert each generator individually?).

I am not sure it is a good idea. If the original link was created with a pd code or gauss code, the computed braid might need more crossings than the original link. If we compute the new link from the braid, we might be unnecesarily increasing the number of crossings. Consider, for instance the monster unknot:


```
sage: L = Link([[3,1,2,4], [8,9,1,7], [5,6,7,3], [4,18,6,5], 
....: [17,19,8,18], [9,10,11,14], [10,12,13,11],
....: [12,19,15,13], [20,16,14,15], [16,20,17,2]])
sage: L
Link with 1 component represented by 10 crossings
sage: L.braid()
s0*s1^-1*s2^-1*s3^-1*s2*s1^-1*s0^-1*s1*s2^2*s1^-1*s3*s2*s1^-3
sage: len(L.braid().Tietze())
16
```


If we construct the mirror image from the braid, we sill loose the posibility of computing some invariants using the simpler representation with 10 crossings (instead of 16).

If we use the pd_code to compute the mirror image, we are safe on that size: the resulting link will have exactly the same internal representation as the original one.

Good point. I've changed it so that we use the braid iff we have the braid repr already and do not the PD code.

I think the same argument applies to the oriented gauss code. So the correct way to do so would be to use the braid iff we don't have neither the pd_code r the ogc_code (or we have them, but they have the same number of crossings as the braid).

Also, I am having problems building the documentation.

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-06-02 13:48:09

So can you add the code for the mirror via the OGC? At that point, I can start looking into the docbuilding issues.


---

Comment by mmarco created at 2016-06-02 13:48:44

Working on it.

Great, thank you!

I think that should do it. It checks if the braid exists, and if it exists, if it is as short as the ogc and pd. In that case, it uses the braid, otherwise, it uses the pd.

Also, I think the documentation should build correctly now.

I changed things so that it does not compute the PD code and OGC if they have not been computed as these are likely relatively expensive compared to simply reversing the braid (which was my original motivation for my initial reviewer change). If the current state is good with you, you can set a positive review.

Sorry for the delay. It looks good to me.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-06-25 12:45:35

No problem. I'm interpreting that as a positive review.
