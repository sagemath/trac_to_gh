I will ask for more, if it isn't too much trouble.  Could there be a small wrapper to (the better one) called degree_sequence as well?  I realize this is very low priority.  If the graph theory tour ever gets back up, this would be ideal to put in it as well.

Yes, that is exactly what I meant - wrapping the examples you provide, as it were.  I don't have time to do this, unfortunately, though it should be pretty easy.

Y-E-S, yes! :-)



The patch `trac_7564-degree-sequences.patch` implements the following degree sequences:

1. `degree_sequence()` --- the degree sequence of a (di)graph. This is implemented in the class `GenericGraph`.
2. `in_degree_sequence()` --- the indegree sequence of a digraph. This is implemented in the class `DiGraph`.
3. `out_degree_sequence()` --- the outdegree sequence of a digraph, also implemented in the class `DiGraph`.
 
I use the method names `in_degree_sequence()` and `out_degree_sequence()` to be consistent with how the graph theory module names the indegree and outdegree methods.
