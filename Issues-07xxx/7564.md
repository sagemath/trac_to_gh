The degree sequence of a graph is a basic property that is studied in an introductory course on graph theory. There should be examples explaining how to compute the degree sequence of a given graph.

Y-E-S, yes! :-)



The patch `trac_7564-degree-sequences.patch` implements the following degree sequences:

1. `degree_sequence()` --- the degree sequence of a (di)graph. This is implemented in the class `GenericGraph`.
2. `in_degree_sequence()` --- the indegree sequence of a digraph. This is implemented in the class `DiGraph`.
3. `out_degree_sequence()` --- the outdegree sequence of a digraph, also implemented in the class `DiGraph`.
 
I use the method names `in_degree_sequence()` and `out_degree_sequence()` to be consistent with how the graph theory module names the indegree and outdegree methods.
