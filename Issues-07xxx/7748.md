We don't appear to have this, though perhaps it is in Pynac/Ginac already.  We also need to translate Maxima's gamma_incomplete to our gamma_inc or incomplete_gamma as part of this ticket.

After a quick look at the GiNaC sources, I don't think there is an implementation of the incomplete gamma function in there.

Numerical evaluation of this can be done with the `gammainc()` function of mpmath.

The conversion should just work, if the conversions dictionary argument of `BuiltinFunction.__init__` contains `maxima='gamma_incomplete'`.

Okay.

But will it give us symbolic evaluation ala gamma_inc(1,1)=1/e?  That would be best.

Yes, of course, but we still have to do it :)

The 2 patches should make the incomplete gamma function symbolic. The exponential integral Ei was used in its symbolic evaluation, therefore it was also made symbolic.

I tried the exponential integral patch and it works ok. However I don't understand the changes in
random_tests.py. Also the following could be evaluated:

```
sage: diff(Ei(x),x)
D[0](Ei)(x)
sage: integrate(Ei(x),x)

Should this be in a separate ticket?

This makes a 'random' symbolic expression, and when we add new symbolic functions (and sometimes when we change them) this doctest needs to be changed, not because anything bad happened.

We should write a python function wrapping `gamma_inc` and `gamma`, similar to the provided for `psi()` in #6961.

The fact that `gamma()` accepts two arguments at the moment is a bug that I introduced in #7490. Looking at the code, it also doesn't handle the `prec` parameter correctly. I'll upload a patch with a wrapper `gamma()` function and a fix for the `prec` issue.

Integration cannot be handled with a custom method in symbolic functions. The patches attached to #6465 should make this easier.
