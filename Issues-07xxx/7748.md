We don't appear to have this, though perhaps it is in Pynac/Ginac already.  We also need to translate Maxima's gamma_incomplete to our gamma_inc or incomplete_gamma as part of this ticket.

<a id='comment:1'></a>After a quick look at the GiNaC sources, I don't think there is an implementation of the incomplete gamma function in there.

Numerical evaluation of this can be done with the `gammainc()` function of mpmath.

The conversion should just work, if the conversions dictionary argument of `BuiltinFunction.__init__` contains `maxima='gamma_incomplete'`.

Okay.

But will it give us symbolic evaluation ala gamma_inc(1,1)=1/e?  That would be best.

This makes a 'random' symbolic expression, and when we add new symbolic functions (and sometimes when we change them) this doctest needs to be changed, not because anything bad happened.

We should write a python function wrapping `gamma_inc` and `gamma`, similar to the provided for `psi()` in #6961.

The fact that `gamma()` accepts two arguments at the moment is a bug that I introduced in #7490. Looking at the code, it also doesn't handle the `prec` parameter correctly. I'll upload a patch with a wrapper `gamma()` function and a fix for the `prec` issue.

Integration cannot be handled with a custom method in symbolic functions. The patches attached to #6465 should make this easier.

<a id='comment:12'></a>attachment:trac_7748-gamma_wrapper.2.patch adds a new wrapper function to call gamma or incomplete gamma depending on the number of arguments. It also corrects the way `prec` parameter to `gamma` was handled.

Flavia's patches needed to be rebased to 4.3.3.alpha1 since the changes to `random_tests.py` didn't apply anymore.

The patches to be applied are (in this order):
* attachment:trac_7748-exp_integral_ver2.4.3.3.alpha1.patch
* attachment:trac_7748-incomplete_gamma_ver2.4.3.3.alpha1.patch
* attachment:trac_7748-gamma_wrapper.2.patch

I'm changing this to needs review. :)
