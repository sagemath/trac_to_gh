With Sage 4.3.alpha0 and 4.3.alpha1, this shows up under the script repository:

```
~/Desktop/sage-4.3.alpha1/sage -hg st
? hmac256
? jmol
? pilconvert.py
? pildriver.py
? pilfile.py
? pilfont.py
? pilprint.py
? sphinx-autogen
```
Those files should be added using "hg add" and then checked in with "hg ci".

I don't think that those should be checked in since they are installed by spkgs.
