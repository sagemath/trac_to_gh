```
With Sage 4.3.alpha0 and 4.3.alpha1, this shows up under the script repository:

```
~/Desktop/sage-4.3.alpha1/sage -hg st
? hmac256
? jmol
? pilconvert.py
? pildriver.py
? pilfile.py
? pilfont.py
? pilprint.py
? sphinx-autogen
```
Those files should be added using "hg add" and then checked in with "hg ci".

Yes, good point! Would you consider configuring Mercurial to ignore those files? If so, I have attached the patch `trac_7607-hgignore.patch` to take care of the Mercurial configuration. That patch should be applied to the script repository.
