I don't think it's helpful to have this tagged as "positive review" when it depends on #5396 which is still being worked on.  So I am switching it back to "needs work" and it can go to "needs review" after #5396 is positively reviewed.

John,

I put a new spkg in [#5396](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/5396)

I tested it on my computer and on sage.math. I believe this should work.
