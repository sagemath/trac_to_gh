I am attaching  patches which adds to the lcalc wrapping documentation that the derivatives loose about half the precision. There is additional documentation to guide how many dirichlet coefficients are needed, at least for computing near the real axis.

I don't think it's helpful to have this tagged as "positive review" when it depends on #5396 which is still being worked on.  So I am switching it back to "needs work" and it can go to "needs review" after #5396 is positively reviewed.

John,

I put a new spkg in [#5396](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/5396)

I tested it on my computer and on sage.math. I believe this should work.
