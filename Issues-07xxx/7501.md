After an extensive evaluation, we all decided that [CodeMirror](http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/) is the best JavaScript code editor to include in Sage.  It's faster and more robust than [EditArea](http://www.cdolivet.com/index.php?page=editArea).  Initially, we will include it **only** for editing `Data --> file`, then maybe later adapt it for input cells.

* Includes `codemirror.js` on every page.
* Refers to `parsesage.js` and `sage/css/pythoncolors.css`, which seem to be missing.  The new patches just use CodeMirror's Python parser and style.
* Does not align the automatic line numbers with lines of text in the editor.

Part A just adds CodeMirror to the repository.  Part B configures it for the data file page.
