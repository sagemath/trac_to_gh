* Includes `codemirror.js` on every page.
* Refers to `parsesage.js` and `sage/css/pythoncolors.css`, which seem to be missing.  The new patches just use CodeMirror's Python parser and style.
* Does not align the automatic line numbers with lines of text in the editor.

Part A just adds CodeMirror to the repository.  Part B configures it for the data file page.
