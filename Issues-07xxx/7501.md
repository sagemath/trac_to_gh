After an extensive evaluation, we all decided that [CodeMirror](http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/) is the best JavaScript code editor to include in Sage.  It's faster and more robust than [EditArea](http://www.cdolivet.com/index.php?page=editArea).  Initially, we will include it **only** for editing `Data --> file`, then maybe later adapt it for input cells.

I should have said that the "rebased" patches are actually new.  It seem easier to do this given the extent of changes to SageNB since the original patches were made.  Also, the original set

* Includes `codemirror.js` on every page.
* Refers to `parsesage.js` and `sage/css/pythoncolors.css`, which seem to be missing.  The new patches just use CodeMirror's Python parser and style.
* Does not align the automatic line numbers with lines of text in the editor.

Part A just adds CodeMirror to the repository.  Part B configures it for the data file page.
