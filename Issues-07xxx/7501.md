After an extensive evaluation, we all decided that [CodeMirror](http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/) is the best JavaScript code editor to include in Sage.  It's faster and more robust than [EditArea](http://www.cdolivet.com/index.php?page=editArea).  Initially, we will include it **only** for editing `Data --> file`, then maybe later adapt it for input cells. 

See this [screenshot](http://wstein.org/home/wstein/patches/codemirror.png).

Apply both

* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/7501/trac_7501-codemirror_partA.patch
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/7501/trac_7501-codemirror_partB.patch

to SageNB 0.7.4 (cf. #8051) OR get a trial spkg from #8194.
