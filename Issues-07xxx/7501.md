After an extensive evaluation, we all decided that [CodeMirror](http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/) is the best JavaScript code editor to include in Sage.  It's faster and more robust than [EditArea](http://www.cdolivet.com/index.php?page=editArea).  Initially, we will include it **only** for editing `Data --> file`, then maybe later adapt it for input cells.
