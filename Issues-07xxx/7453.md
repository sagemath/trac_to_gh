David Perkinson created a sage module for doing sandpile computations.  See http://people.reed.edu/~davidp/sand/sage/html/sage_sandpiles.html
for his documentation of it.
This ticket makes an experimental spkg for the module.  It installs glpk and 4ti2 which are required for the full functionality.
First attempt is up at:

Anyway, this is just going in the experimental packages so I would appreciate someone giving it a try and then a positive review if it works for you - I think the bar is set pretty low for experimental.

This installs on a mac 10.6.2 and runs at least some of the commands on
http://people.reed.edu/~davidp/sand/sage/2.0/html/sandpile.html
(I just did this today). I also installed it a few months ago on a linux 
(ubuntu) machine at work.

What more do you want for a positive review?

I don't want anything more for a positive review.  I think for an
experimental package just about anything goes.  The advantage of the
experimental package is that David Perkinson can at least say: if you
want to install this package in sage, just do: sage -i sandpile-1.51

That will make it easier for other people (besides sage developers) to
give it a try.  It would be nice to eventually get it into Sage
itself, and this is just a first step.
