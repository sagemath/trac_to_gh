That's a flaw in the install_package script if there is more than one package with the same name.

As a workaround I will change it to use the 4.9 package.  I uploaded it to the same file as above (http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/sandpile-1.51.spkg).

I don't want anything more for a positive review.  I think for an
experimental package just about anything goes.  The advantage of the
experimental package is that David Perkinson can at least say: if you
want to install this package in sage, just do: sage -i sandpile-1.51

That will make it easier for other people (besides sage developers) to
give it a try.  It would be nice to eventually get it into Sage
itself, and this is just a first step.
