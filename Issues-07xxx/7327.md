```

This patch takes care of this.

This is a duplicate of #6816.  The tests for one of these should be incorporated in the other - probably in this one, since it has some doc upgrades - and probably also the check for too many arguments in the tuple.

Just an update - it turns out the original integral reported in #6816 is not, in fact, convergent.  Fixing this doctest so something mathematically correct happens will be done in #7745, since Maxima 5.20.1 simply returns that integral now, as opposed to giving 0.
