It is inconsistent with plot and other functions that this just hangs:

```
integrate(sin(x), (x,0,1))
```

This patch takes care of this.

This is a duplicate of #6816.  The tests for one of these should be incorporated in the other - probably in this one, since it has some doc upgrades - and probably also the check for too many arguments in the tuple.
