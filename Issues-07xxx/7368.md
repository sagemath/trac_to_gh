Working on ticket #7096, I realised that there are many functionalities concerning morphisms of elliptic curves that are not implemented or implemented badly.

See also #6887, and #7262.

Here is a wish-list:

* General isogenies, not only cyclic ones should be implemented.
  Possibly this could be done in a clever way, by having it 
  internally factored into cyclic isogenies. → #32744
* Inseparable isogenies (e.g. Frobenii) should be possible too. → #33915 (See also #6413.)
* One should be able to compose isogenies. → #16245, #32744
* There should be an addition for isogenies with the same domain 
  and codomain.
* There should be an endomorphism_ring for elliptic curves whose
  elements are isogenies.
* Similarly, automorphisms should give a group of isogenies.
* Isogenies of large prime degree ℓ can be computed in time Õ(√ℓ) using https://velusqrt.isogeny.org/ → #34303
* Is there a way of constructing a (not necessarily normalized)
  isogeny knowing the degree and the domain and codomain?
