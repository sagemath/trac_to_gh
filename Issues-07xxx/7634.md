This is currently under discussion here:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8edd29e9bddc67e5

I realized that it's probably actually time to switch over, since there are a few other developers working on Sage graphs besides just me now. That way if anything slows down, we are likely to find it out pretty quickly, and get it fixed. And, with the new defaults, things already feel more speedy:

BEFORE:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph.py"             
 [113.1 s]
```
AFTER:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph.py"             
 [78.5 s]
```

A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.

The following tests failed:

I know that this could not give you much information, but I do not know of any way to make -t more verbose... any idea ?

By the way, the problem indeed comes from this distance_graph doctest !

Well, this one does its jobs, and *finally* splits the graph.py file. c_graphs are now the default ones in Sage, and this patch renames what has to be. 

Positive review/Good work/Excellent news !
