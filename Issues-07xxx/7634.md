I realized that it's probably actually time to switch over, since there are a few other developers working on Sage graphs besides just me now. That way if anything slows down, we are likely to find it out pretty quickly, and get it fixed. And, with the new defaults, things already feel more speedy:

BEFORE:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph.py"             
 [113.1 s]
```
AFTER:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph.py"             
 [78.5 s]
```

A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.

The following tests failed:

I know that this could not give you much information, but I do not know of any way to make -t more verbose... any idea ?

Yes, I found it... So stupid of not having checked :-)

By the way, the problem indeed comes from this distance_graph doctest !
