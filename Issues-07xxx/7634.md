Hmmm... When applying your patch here is what I get :

```

sage -t  "devel/sage-A/sage/graphs/graph.py"

A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
         [360.5 s]
exit code: 768
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "devel/sage-A/sage/graphs/graph.py"
Total time for all tests: 360.5 seconds
```
I know that this could not give you much information, but I do not know of any way to make -t more verbose... any idea ?
