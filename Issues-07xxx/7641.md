# Issue 7641: symbolic expression plots do not use the generic variable processing pipeline

Right now, plots for symbolic expressions do not go through the generic codepath, but through the expression.plot() function in symbolic/expression.pyx.  This specialized codepath changes how the arguments are handled, etc.  I think any functionality in the special codepath ought to go in the generic codepath, or we should reduce the generic codepath quite a bit and just pass things off to symbolic expressions.  Too much code duplication here has led to lots of little inconsistencies.

As an example, this works `plot(x^2,0,x,5)`, but this doesn't: `parametric_plot((x,x^2), 0,x,5)`, since the first uses the expression.pyx codepath, but the parametric plot uses the generic codepath.
