# Issue 7683: sphinx reference manual documentation has a major issue: in some cases the input parameters to functions are completely omitted causing great confusion!

See

http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/rings/integer.html#sage.rings.integer.Integer.jacobi

Notice that the input parameter b is simply totally omitted from the function signature. In sharp contrast, if you type

```
sage: a = 5
sage: a.jacobi(<tab>
```
in the notebook, then you'll see the correct sphinx-rendered documentation *with* the other input argument.  This is very bad and confusing for some users who trust reference manuals, especially because evidently the use of INPUT/OUTPUT blocks to describe parameters of functions is not being used nearly as much as it should be (there will be another ticket about that).

It looks good to me, and I understand the general principle behind the patch, but not necessarily the details.  (For instance, and this has more to do with Sphinx than the patch, why is essentially the same code repeated four times?)

The output seems to fix the complaint, too.  Is this worth reporting to the Sphinx people as a suggested addition to their code?
