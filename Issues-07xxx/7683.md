# Issue 7683: sphinx reference manual documentation has a major issue: in some cases the input parameters to functions are completely omitted causing great confusion!

See

http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/rings/integer.html#sage.rings.integer.Integer.jacobi

Notice that the input parameter b is simply totally omitted from the function signature. In sharp contrast, if you type

```
sage: a = 5
sage: a.jacobi(<tab>
```
in the notebook, then you'll see the correct sphinx-rendered documentation *with* the other input argument.  This is very bad and confusing for some users who trust reference manuals, especially because evidently the use of INPUT/OUTPUT blocks to describe parameters of functions is not being used nearly as much as it should be (there will be another ticket about that).
