If two users open the same worksheet, one changing it should appear to the other.  If the same person opens the same worksheet in multiple tabs or browser, changing one should update all views.  Finally, hitting the back button after viewing a worksheet (to get back to it) shouldn't result in massive corruption.  This relatively simple patch solves these problems in a very simple and direct manner.

True, but that really has little to do with my patch, since the docs were like that in sage-4.1.1.

Good question.  I think what will happen is that if you do something, say insert a cell, evaluate a cell, change a cell, and that entire transaction gets dropped, then a refresh will end up being forced.  You will (1) loose that change, and (2) see that it didn't take.  This is probably much better than thinking that you made that change but actually not making it.   

There may be some other subtle issues I'm missing.  

I should post this to alpha.sagenb.org today for further testing (not done yet).

Well, that could also happen, probably. What I was thinking about is a flaky connection (or one, where a roundtrip takes longer than 2 secs). Then, the async request is still open, but already some others waiting to get dispatched.

I just don't know all the details and what's already done by the async requests, so that's just a very rough description what i'm thinking about.

Reverting valid new content to an older version just because of bad timing with the server might be another issue. Updates from the client to the server must have higher priority.

* It's probably safer to use `parseInt` and to use `===` and `!==`, instead of `==` and `!=`, to avoid JS's implicit conversions (cf. [JSLint's](http://www.jslint.com/) "The Good Parts" setting).  Although I'm not sure how it happened, I saw the successive state "numbers" 480, 4801, 48011, etc.
* The browser and server do not update their `state_number`s if a new cell is added at the end of a sheet, when text cells are added, or cells are deleted.  Should we add these to the list, along with the `'delete_all_output'`, `'pretty_print'`, `'system'` worksheet commands?

If these changes are worthwhile, I can make a patch, but I'm not sure how/where to store the worksheet's state (or "revision") number.
