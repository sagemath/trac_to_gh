```

On 4.3.rc0, I get this:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Symbolic Ring' and
'<class 'sage.functions.generalized.FunctionDiracDelta'>'
```

The Maxima interface seems to give precedence to the global function
dictionary instead of the local variables when converting Maxima output
back to Sage expressions.

```
sage: dirac_delta(x)
dirac_delta(x)
sage: maxima(dirac_delta(x))
delta(x)
```

sage: d = var('delta')
sage: e = d._maxima_()
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_expression_from_maxima_element(e)
dirac_delta

somewhere in symbolic_expression_from_maxima_element(), the string from maxima is looked up in sage.calculus.calculus._syms, which by default has 'delta': dirac_delta .  So this is what's happening, next, SR() barfs on trying to turn dirac_delta into a symbolic expression, at which point people who just wanted their variable 'delta' back get confused and frustrated.

sage: del sage.calculus.calculus._syms['delta']
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_expression_from_maxima_element(e)
delta

That may not be such a good idea, however, since what sage calls dirac_delta, maxima refers to as delta.  Nevertheless, since reset('delta') appears to remove delta from that dictionary, perhaps var('delta') should also do so?

Of course, what happens when someone does a Laplace transform with delta as a sage variable will then come out confusing and wrong.  At least the current behavior is merely broken.

I updated [attachment:trac_7661-maxima_convert_back.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7661/trac_7661-maxima_convert_back.patch) to remove a doctest fix broken by a previous patch in my queue (#6949, `symbol...` line in sage/symbolic/ring.pyx).

This patch depends on #7748.

Hello Burcin

I think that two lines should be removed from the patch

```
global _syms 
_syms = sage.symbolic.pynac.symbol_table.get('maxima', {}) 
```

I updated your patch, it is now http://user.mendelu.cz/marik/sage/trac_7661-maxima_convert_back2.patch

If everything will work, I'll return in few (several) hours with positive review (tests in functions, interfaces, symbolics and calculus passed, now running all the test). 

Robert
