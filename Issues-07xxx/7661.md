On 4.3.rc0, I get this:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Symbolic Ring' and
'<class 'sage.functions.generalized.FunctionDiracDelta'>'
```

The Maxima interface seems to give precedence to the global function
dictionary instead of the local variables when converting Maxima output
back to Sage expressions.

```
sage: dirac_delta(x)
dirac_delta(x)
sage: maxima(dirac_delta(x))
delta(x)
```

sage: d = var('delta')
sage: e = d._maxima_()
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_expression_from_maxima_element(e)
dirac_delta

somewhere in symbolic_expression_from_maxima_element(), the string from maxima is looked up in sage.calculus.calculus._syms, which by default has 'delta': dirac_delta .  So this is what's happening, next, SR() barfs on trying to turn dirac_delta into a symbolic expression, at which point people who just wanted their variable 'delta' back get confused and frustrated.

sage: del sage.calculus.calculus._syms['delta']
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_expression_from_maxima_element(e)
delta

That may not be such a good idea, however, since what sage calls dirac_delta, maxima refers to as delta.  Nevertheless, since reset('delta') appears to remove delta from that dictionary, perhaps var('delta') should also do so?

Of course, what happens when someone does a Laplace transform with delta as a sage variable will then come out confusing and wrong.  At least the current behavior is merely broken.

Hello Burcin

I think that two lines should be removed from the patch

```
global _syms 
_syms = sage.symbolic.pynac.symbol_table.get('maxima', {}) 
```

I updated your patch, it is now http://user.mendelu.cz/marik/sage/trac_7661-maxima_convert_back2.patch

If everything will work, I'll return in few (several) hours with positive review (tests in functions, interfaces, symbolics and calculus passed, now running all the test). 

Robert

Sure, it was intended as temporary patch and from this reason I did not upload to trac server unless tested. I got some doctest failures in three files. See http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/marik/ and the files a, b and c.

I think that b is simple to fix, but have no idea about a and c.
