The functions `search_src`, `search_def`, and `search_src` are case-sensitive and have been for a while.  The documentation says that they're not.  This patch changes the documentation to reflect this, and adds one doctest to verify it.

Just out of curiosity, is it possible to change the behavior?  Obviously that would be a different ticket.  That could be useful (or not).  Maybe a function that is, and another one that isn't...

The new patch is just making the notation for "case-sensitive" uniformly with hyphen, which seemed to be the majority of references in the doc; however, usage in general seems quite variable.  One word for the adjective seems right, though.  Maybe mvngu will have a comment, so I'm cc:ing him on this.

I also added a little to the doctests to make sure we're really doctesting the right thing and compare the two possibilities.
