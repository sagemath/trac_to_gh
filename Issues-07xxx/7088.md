Hi all,

Found this simple bug in a simple Z[x] factoring example.

R.<x>=PolynomialRing(ZZ)
f = 12*x^10 + x^9 + 432*x^3 + 9011
g = 13*x^11 + 89*x^3 + 1
F = f^2 * g^3
G = F.factor()
should_be_zero = F - G.prod()
should_be_zero == 0

The problem was that F.factor returns

2028 * (12*x^10 + x^9 + 432*x^3 + 9011)^2 * (13*x^11 + 89*x^3 + 1)^3

Not 1 * (12*x^10 + x^9 + 432*x^3 + 9011)^2 * (13*x^11 + 89*x^3 + 1)^3

```

I attached a patch with a one character change: ( TESTS:: to TESTS:).

Other than that, it looks good to me.
