In the following example, a segfault occurs. Shouldn't an error be raised instead?

```
sage: F.<a> = FiniteField(3)
sage: P.<T,z> = PolynomialRing(F)
sage: type(P)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomialRing_libsingular'>

I did `sage -tp 2 devel/sage` and obtained

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial_ring.py # 89 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx # 123 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/combinat/kazhdan_lusztig.py # 5 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/algebras/iwahori_hecke_algebra.py # 17 doctests failed
```

At least in one case, it seems that in some places one needed to add further arguments to ring constructors.

Some random timings:

Without the patch

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = GF(3)[]
sage: p = R.random_element()
sage: p
-y^2 + x*z - z^2 - z
sage: timeit('q=p^100')
125 loops, best of 3: 6.24 ms per loop
```

With the new patch and the same polynomial, I get:

```
sage: timeit('q=p^100')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.99 ms per loop
```

So, this is already good news!

Criticism: The patch still does not provide doctests showing that the problem is fixed. I am now running doctests, and if they pass, I'll try to add a proper doctest via reviewer patch.

Replying to [Bouillaguet](#comment%3A13):
> This cannot possibly be doctested, so we might as well close this.

I disagree, in two regards.

First of all, if no error is raised and no crash occurs, then apparently the example is different. Could be a 32-bit versus 64-bit problem. Or not? I don't think that the problem I originally reported was 32 bit.

So, one should try to find an example in which a segfault used to occur, but an error is raised now. Can someone please test whether the following segfaults with sage-4.3?

```
sage: F.<a> = FiniteField(3)
sage: P.<T,z> = PolynomialRing(F)
sage: (T+z)^(5^15)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OverflowError: Exponent overflow (30517578125).
```

If that test segfaults in old Sage versions, then it is a valid test (in particular, those types of bugs *can* be tested against).

So, who has old Sage versions hanging around?

Unfortunately, with sage-4.7.beta1, the error is already raised (i.e., no segfault).

I don't think so. My understanding is that the problem has been fixed inside [lib]singular. Testing this particular example is difficult because the computation takes many hours. It used to crash, but it now works.
