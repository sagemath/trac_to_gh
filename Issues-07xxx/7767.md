On a Sun Ultra 27, running Open Solaris 06/2009 and gcc 4.3.4, I get the following error when trying to build PARI:

I've not looked yet, but the chances are it some GNUism passing inappropriate flags to the compiler. It might be a problem with pari, or it might be a problem in something Sage does, so at this point in time, I've not reported this upstream, despite the fact it might be an upstream bug.

At this point in time, #9343 has not been merged to any stable release (only alphas), so I think currently this ticket should stay open. 

In theory  #9343 could be reverted, though I doubt that will happen.
