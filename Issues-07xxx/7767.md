On a Sun Ultra 27, running Open Solaris 06/2009 and gcc 4.3.4, I get the following error when trying to build PARI:

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A1):
> Is this issue fixed by #9343?  If yes, we can close this ticket.

At this point in time, #9343 has not been merged to any stable release (only alphas), so I think currently this ticket should stay open. 

In theory  #9343 could be reverted, though I doubt that will happen.

Did you at least try it with PARI 2.3.**5** (which is e.g. included in Sage 4.5.3)?
