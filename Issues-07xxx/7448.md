This patch fixes rendering of nested class in Sage.

The particular metaclass `NestedMetaclass` we have to use to work around the nested class pickling bug of python get in the way of Sphinx because it change the `__name__` of the nested class.
We have to make Sphinx aware of those particular classes and to update its configuration.

I also took the chance to raise a warning if someone forgot to set the metaclass leading to a unpicklable class. Several bug have been found that way. I'll add a ticket for this.  Addendum: See #8452 for this.

Is this normal that the file\n\n```\n./patches/autodoc.py\n```\ncontains the modifications, whereas\n\n```\n./src/sphinx/ext/autodoc.py\n```\ndoesn't ?

Moreover, sage.misc.nested_class has already been added since #8250 merged in sage-4.3.3.alpha1. If you want to see the result pick a random file with nested class. They are plenty of them in categories, see eg\n\n```\nsage/categories/semigroups.py\n```\nwhich has many thing implemented in nested classes. \n\nNote that now that we do see nested classes, we find out that they are plenty of room for improvement in those docs.

Hi John,

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A12):
> (I haven't tested the patch here, just implemented it and built the spkg. Please check the file autodoc.py to make sure I patched it right.)  

Thank for this. Is this normal that the file

```
./patches/autodoc.py
```
contains the modifications, whereas

```
./src/sphinx/ext/autodoc.py
```
doesn't ? It seems that the answer is yes and that the former replace the later during build. Everthing seems to be ok. 

> To test this, do we need to add sage.misc.nested_class and/or sage.misc.nested_class_test to the reference manual?

No you don't ! Moreover, sage.misc.nested_class has already been added since #8250 merged in sage-4.3.3.alpha1. If you want to see the result pick a random file with nested class. They are plenty of them in categories, see eg

```
sage/categories/semigroups.py
```
which has many thing implemented in nested classes. 

Note that now that we do see nested classes, we find out that they are plenty of room for improvement in those docs. It will be the purpose of an (or more probably several) other ticket.

Summary of discussion with Florent over the phone:
- the patch to autodoc could be made more robust and include an analysis of the problem
- we have an example where Sphinx screws up, with plain Python nested classes (without NestedClassMetaclass), and has no chance to do any better without fixing nested class names as does NestedClassMetaclass.

Florent will post an improved patch, but not right away. So if there is an emergency to get this into 4.4, I give a positive review on that particular patch to get in as is.

Yes, it's normal: in a typical spkg, the "src" directory is supposed to contain the original unmodified source, and then it gets patched by running spkg-install.  

I noticed that the nested classes in categories/coxeter_groups seem to be rendered correctly, so I guess that's good evidence that it's working.

I uploaded a new patch for sphinx and for autodoc.py. Do *not* apply `trac_7448-nested_class_sphinx_exper-fh.patch` which was used for experiments. 

mpatel told on #8258 he will take care or building the spkg. Many thanks to him.

No objection ! Actually I think this has nothing to do with sphinx and it should be tested during the import. I put it here because if a class is detected as unpicklable, there is a very good chance it ends up typeset incorrectly by sphinx.

Sure ! Please do ! I won't have much time working on this so I'll appreciate someone take over those if the architecture is changed.

Just that I suggest any further changes be updates to that patch, via `hg qrefresh`, if it's appropriate.

Since it doesn't seem to belong in the docbuild system, can we put this check elsewhere, e.g., in the unit/doc-testing system?  And restrict this ticket to nested class rendering?

I tried doing this and didn't have instant success.  But as you suggest, it might be better to do this elsewhere.

I may be overreacting.  Thoughts?

I've attached V5, which should "just" fix Sphinx's rendering of nested classes.  To the extent it counts, my review is positive.  Could someone please review V5 for this ticket?  I've opened #8452 for the nested class pickling check and will make a patch for that.
