Hello everybody !

This is an update of the GLPK package to match the changes in ``numerical.mip``. Here is the list of changes :

* Names for the objective function, the whole problem, variables and constraints can be set through the newly exposed GLPK functions
* A problem can be exported to MPS or LP files
* GLPK now returns Exceptions when it fails ( it used to silently return the 0 solution ).
* As solveGLPK, write_mps and write_lp all need the problem to be built as a GLPK structure, a new function  ``build_glp_prob`` does this job and is used by the three of them.

Comments have also been added when felt necessary. The code should be more efficient (and Cythonized) in this version ( this was the whole purpose of redefining the structure of ``numerical.mip`` )

The spkg is available on sagemath at : ~ncohen/glpk-4.38.p4.spkg or at http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/glpk-4.38.p4.spkg or http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/glpk-4.38.p4.spkg

A new SPKG is available at

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/glpk-4.38.p4.spkg

I give Nathan's SPKG a positive review if my referee patch is accepted. The referee patch fixes a mem leak and makes some of the code in the Cython wrapper more Pythonic (I also reverted some pre-mature optimisation which wouldn't speed things up)

I am attaching the patch here for convenience (it is applied in p4 linked above).

Your new spkg file contains a build/ directory and a file .cpp in the patch/ directory ( it seems you installed the patch then packaged it without removing these temporary files ). Coild you update it ?

Besides, is there any way for me to get the diff files since the last version ? I am still not that used to mercurial :-)

Thank youuuuuuuuuu !!!

Looks good :-)

Two questions though :

* Why do you replace == and != by is and is not ?
* is enumerating range(500) faster than 0<= i< 500 or is there another reason ?
* Why did you remove the leading 'r' before the docstrings ? I was under the impression they were requried for the docstring to display correctly...

I knew nothing about enumerate()... I'll remember this one ! :-)

False and None are unique objects thus it is sufficient to compare by checking identities. Feel free to change it back, though.

> * is enumerating range(500) faster than 0<= i< 500 or is there another reason ?

Cython will write 0<= i < 500 automatically, so you can just write proper Python code and Cython will optimise it for you.

>  Why did you remove the leading 'r' before the docstrings ? I was under the impression they were requried for the docstring to display correctly...

Only if they contain a backslash.
