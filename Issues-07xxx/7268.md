Hello everybody !

This is an update of the GLPK package to match the changes in ``numerical.mip``. Here is the list of changes :

* Names for the objective function, the whole problem, variables and constraints can be set through the newly exposed GLPK functions
* A problem can be exported to MPS or LP files
* GLPK now returns Exceptions when it fails ( it used to silently return the 0 solution ).
* As solveGLPK, write_mps and write_lp all need the problem to be built as a GLPK structure, a new function  ``build_glp_prob`` does this job and is used by the three of them.

Comments have also been added when felt necessary. The code should be more efficient (and Cythonized) in this version ( this was the whole purpose of redefining the structure of ``numerical.mip`` )

The spkg is available on sagemath at : ~ncohen/glpk-4.38.p4.spkg or at http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/glpk-4.38.p4.spkg or http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/glpk-4.38.p4.spkg

Two questions though :

* is enumerating range(500) faster than 0<= i< 500 or is there another reason ?
* Why did you remove the leading 'r' before the docstrings ? I was under the impression they were requried for the docstring to display correctly...

False and None are unique objects thus it is sufficient to compare by checking identities. Feel free to change it back, though.

>     * is enumerating range(500) faster than 0<= i< 500 or is there another reason ?


Cython will write 0<= i < 500 automatically, so you can just write proper Python code and Cython will optimise it for you.

>  Why did you remove the leading 'r' before the docstrings ? I was under the impression they were requried for the docstring to display correctly...


Only if they contain a backslash.
