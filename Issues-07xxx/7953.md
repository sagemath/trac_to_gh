Reported by Ronald van Luijk:

The `print C` below only prints the first defining equation.

```
sage: # problem printing
sage: A.<x,y,z>=AffineSpace(QQ,3)
sage: C=Curve([x-y,2-z])
sage: print C
Affine Space Curve over Rational Field defined by x - y
sage: print C.defining_ideal()
Ideal (x - y, -z + 2) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field
```

I'll take the liberty to switch this patch back to positive review, since it does solve the problem described in the ticket (which is bad - Sage gives wrong answers) and there was no work done in a "better direction" for 9 month neither here nor on #7954.

The original patch uses TABs, so I changed them to spaces leaving the rest the same. Applies cleanly and passes all tests on sage-4.6.rc0.
