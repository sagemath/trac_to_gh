Reported by Ronald van Luijk:

The `print C` below only prints the first defining equation.

```
sage: # problem printing
sage: A.<x,y,z>=AffineSpace(QQ,3)
sage: C=Curve([x-y,2-z])
sage: print C
Affine Space Curve over Rational Field defined by x - y
sage: print C.defining_ideal()
Ideal (x - y, -z + 2) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field

After discussing with William (see also #7954), I'll move the non-plane curve code out of the plane_curves directory first, and rebase this patch on top of that afterwards.

I'll take the liberty to switch this patch back to positive review, since it does solve the problem described in the ticket (which is bad - Sage gives wrong answers) and there was no work done in a "better direction" for 9 month neither here nor on #7954.

The original patch uses TABs, so I changed them to spaces leaving the rest the same. Applies cleanly and passes all tests on sage-4.6.rc0.
