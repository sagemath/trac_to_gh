Yes, I think you are allowed to review my rebased patch. Essentially, I'm happy with your original patch and I would give it a positive review. But I can't successfully apply your patch to Sage 4.3.alpha1 so I had to rebase your patch. What you are doing is reviewing the modification I made to your patch.

My apology about introducing the tabs. I have attached a new patch which shouldn't have any tabs in it. Only that newer patch needs reviewing.
