If I am allowed to review the rebased patch, I give it a positive review.  The only nit that I have it is uses tabs, but there are other tabs in this file as well.

Yes, I think you are allowed to review my rebased patch. Essentially, I'm happy with your original patch and I would give it a positive review. But I can't successfully apply your patch to Sage 4.3.alpha1 so I had to rebase your patch. What you are doing is reviewing the modification I made to your patch.





> The only nit that I have it is uses tabs, but there are other tabs in this file as well.

My apology about introducing the tabs. I have attached a new patch which shouldn't have any tabs in it. Only that newer patch needs reviewing.
