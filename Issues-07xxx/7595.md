Hello !! This is clearly not my field but I dare intrude : I see you are using functions "crt" and "CRT_list", and I wondered if you would find it sensible to rename them to chinese_remainer_theorem and chinese_remainder_theorem_list ? If this is too long, it may be possible to drop the "theorem" from the name, but the fact remains that if I had to use this function sometime ( which is not excluded, as it is a very famous result ), there is no way on earth I would have thought of trying the "crt" function if I had not seen it related to this ticket :-)

I am under the impression the english speakers would end this message with :

"Well, just my two cents" :-)

The patch is fine, applies to 4.3.rc0 and all tests pass in sage/rings.

I have some problems with the CRT* functions though.

1. CRT_list does not check that the two lists have the same length;  if the moduli list is shorter you get an IndexError, but it would be better to catch that and raise a more informative error.

2. CRT_basis is rather silly.   It calls CRT_list n times with the same moduli, which must be wasteful.  It would be better to call plain CRT n times with suitable moduli (exercise for the reader).

Of course, I don't think that these issues should delay the current patch, but deserve a ticket of their own to make sure they are tided up.
