Currently, code for extracting variables, dealing with ranges of variables, and making the functions fast_float is scattered throughout the plotting directory.  There are multiple implementations, each having its own quirks.

This patch consolidates all of this to two functions in sage.plot.misc and makes all the necessary changes to use this consolidated function.

Cursory review reveals a bit of a slowdown.  Try even

```
sage: f(x)=sin(x)
sage: timeit('plot(f,(-pi,pi))')
```
Also notice that 

```
sage: timeit('plot(f(x),(-pi,pi))')
```
is even slower yet.  These are all milliseconds, not seconds, of course, but in a large plot of many functions, a contour plot with a very dense grid, or for making interacts snappy...  Is there any way to fix that? 

Also, what is the rationale for using fast_float and not fast_callable?  I ask only because there has been so much talk about "we should really use fast_callable instead of fast_float for X".  But I may not understand the difference between the two.

Finally, there should be at least one test to demonstrate that 

```
sage: plot(f, -pi, pi)
```
and friends still work in the one-variable case, because there is no reason for that to disappear in the name of consistency.  The more parentheses, the more confused students get.  But it can be a test, since of course we don't have to promote that syntax.

These are all nitpicky.  Nice refactoring, and all tests pass!

I wonder how much moving this function to cython might help.  Well, I guess checking and then profiling is the right course of action.

fast_callable has not matured to the point that we need it yet.  For example, fast_callable(0) does not work, whereas fast_float(0) does.  #5572 lists some of the things that fast_callable needs to still implement.

That said, fast_float uses fast_callable where it can.  So for most functions, I am actually using fast_callable underneath things.

Hmmm...did I delete a test doing that?  I didn't mean to.

I did change the parametric_plot syntax to deprecate ranges without parenthesis.  This was to maintain consistency with the 3d parametric plot.  For example, currently, parametric_plot((t,t^2), 0, 2*pi) works, but parametric_plot((t,t<sup>2,t</sup>3), 0, 2*pi) does not work.

Didn't delete, but a couple of ones in graphics_array got changed.  Not a big deal, as there are plenty of others in the main docs - I just didn't have time to check if those were the only ones earlier today.

I like the use of "ignore".

Okay, code checks out, and a bevy of examples don't just pass tests but also look like they are supposed to :)

The implicit_plot3d warnings should have been turned on before, but they weren't since they used their own version of the setup function, and so we missed them when we did the deprecation warnings.  So I'll just fix those tests.

The parametric_plot deprecation warnings are new with this patch, though (as pointed about above).  However, especially if they were in our basic documentation like the tour, maybe I should bring this up on sage-devel.
