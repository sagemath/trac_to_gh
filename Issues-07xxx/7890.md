<div id="comment:0"></div>

As of now, certain kinds of sage objects can be converted into GAP objects, but the resulting GAP objects cannot be converted back to sage objects.

Examples of this are matrices over finite fields:

```
sage: g = matrix(GF(5),2,[1,2, -1, 1])
sage: gg = g._gap_()
sage: gg.sage()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError
```

```
sage: a = gap('E(9)')
sage: a
-E(9)^4-E(9)^7
sage: a.sage()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError  
```

Being able to translate gap field elements into sage ones would help accesing GAP character tables, and a good conversion of matrices would allow many methods to be available for matrix groups.

Hi Javier,

What are your intentions regarding https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7890
It seems to have got dropped over two years ago.  Now none of the patches apply to recent
versions of Sage.  I wonder if you're planning to clean this up and finish it?

Hi William,

yeah, sorry about that. I changed jobs in 2010 and my whole work plan went south.
I would like to get this thing working eventually, but I don't believe the approach I was trying is a good one. The lack of types in GAP creates some ambiguity in gap elements that can have different parents and where a choice needs to be made.

Probably a better approach would be to provide an optional argument `sage_parent` to the `_sage_` function in GapElement, and then put the heavy lift into the sage parent where an ad-hoc gap-to-sage function can be defined, something like this:

```
def _sage_(self, sage_parent = None):
    if sage_parent is not None:
        return sage_parent._call_from_gap(self)
    else:
        .... # The function as it used to work

```

In this way, anyone creating a sage structure could implement their own "take an element from gap here" function rather than mess up with the interface. How does that sound?

In any case it might make sense to wait a little bit and get GAP 4.5 working first, as it seems [the representation of some objects has changed](http://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/changes/chap2.html).

Hello,

With #18152, it works fine for cyclotomic elements (because I introduced a function `E` in the global namespace)

```
sage: a = gap('E(9)')
sage: a.sage()
-E(9)^4 - E(9)^7
```
