From [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/862e9bfd7c6c999e#): 

```
sage: var('m')
m
sage: var('n')
n
sage: assume(n, 'integer'); assume(m, 'integer')
sage: sin(n*pi).simplify()
0
sage: sin(m*pi).simplify()
0
sage: forget()
sage: sin(m*pi).simplify()
0
sage: sin(n*pi).simplify()
sin(pi*n)
```
The problem seems to lie in the last few lines of _forget_all in sage.symbolic.assumptions.py, where for some reason the loop isn't doing what it should.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

The problem is actually because list removal is called in GenericDeclaration.forget(), so this is about behavior of list iteration in Python when you remove elements:

```
>>> L=[1,2,3,4]
>>> for x in L:
...     L.remove(x)
...     x
...     L
... 
1
[2, 3, 4]
3
[2, 4]
```
So this piece of code is apparently using the wrong/un-Pythonic way of removing items from a list.

This patch should fix the issue.  In fact, it's only because #7084 finally allows more than one such declaration that this bug ever showed up!
