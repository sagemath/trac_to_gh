From [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/862e9bfd7c6c999e#): 

```
sage: var('m')
m
sage: var('n')

sage: sin(n*pi).simplify()

sage: sin(m*pi).simplify()
0
sage: forget()
sage: sin(m*pi).simplify()
0
sage: sin(n*pi).simplify()
sin(pi*n)
```
The problem seems to lie in the last few lines of _forget_all in sage.symbolic.assumptions.py, where for some reason the loop isn't doing what it should.

The problem is actually because list removal is called in GenericDeclaration.forget(), so this is about behavior of list iteration in Python when you remove elements:

```
>>> L=[1,2,3,4]
>>> for x in L:
...     L.remove(x)
...     x
...     L
... 
1
[2, 3, 4]
3
[2, 4]
```
So this piece of code is apparently using the wrong/un-Pythonic way of removing items from a list.

This patch should fix the issue.  In fact, it's only because #7084 finally allows more than one such declaration that this bug ever showed up!
