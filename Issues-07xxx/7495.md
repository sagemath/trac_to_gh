Uploading or attaching an empty file or a file that doesn't exist, etc. can cause internal server errors instead of a proper error message.

Moreover, notice these lines in twist.py:

```
class Worksheet_do_upload_data
...
        dest = os.path.join(self.worksheet.data_directory(), name)
        if os.path.exists(dest):
            os.unlink(dest)
```

With a properly crafted URL I bet name could contain .. and hence one could make the notebook *server* delete any file it has access to!  This is a critical security vulnerability. 

See also #3849 for similar issues when uploading a worksheet.

Yes, this is fully exploitable and allows one to delete any file on the server:
E.g., on my laptop I created a file tmp/xyz, then pasted in this url, and that file was deleted. 

```
http://localhost:8000/home/admin/13/do_upload_data?urlField=%27%27&nameField=../../../../../../../../tmp/xyz
```

With a little more work, one could not only delete any file, but I think *replace* it by a file of ones choice.  That's a pretty massive exploit.  

So I'm upping this to a blocker and fixing it now.

Actually, clicking to delete this file raises the error:

```
        exceptions.OSError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/home/apps/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/admin/88/data/'
