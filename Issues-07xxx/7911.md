I think we just need to add `'scilab (optional)'` to the `SYSTEMS` list in `notebook.py`.  But I can't test the patch, since I don't have Scilab installed.

I applied the patch to the alpha0 version of sage on my local PC - built from source (if thats what you meant). I installed scilab yesterday so Im in a position to try reviewing the ticket again if you want (if you want to take this offline contact me at "bw7890 at gmail dot com")

The notebook is now actually a [separate project](http://nb.sagemath.org/), with it's own "sagenb" repository.  (I'm assuming that you didn't apply the patch to this repository.  In any case, absolutely no offense is intended.)  Since you built Sage from source, there should be a ~20 MB file `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/sagenb-0.6.spkg`, where `$SAGE_ROOT` is the distribution's base install directory.  To test the patch, try, e.g., 

```sh
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
tar jxvf $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/sagenb-0.6.spkg  # [1]
cd sagenb-0.6/src/sagenb
sage -hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/7911/trac_7911-missing_scilab.2.patch  # [2, 3]
sage -hg qpush
sage -python setup.py install     # [4]
```
Then start the notebook and see if/how I messed up. :)  You can run the notebook doctests with `sage -t -sagenb`.

By the way, if you'd like to apply the patch to the upcoming SageNB release (0.7.x), get the spkg from #8051 and use the first patch above.

* ![1] To install an spkg directly, use, e.g., `sage -f sagenb-0.6.spkg`.
* ![2] This assumes you've enabled the [Mercurial Queues](http://wiki.sagemath.org/MercurialQueues?highlight=%28queues%29) extension.
* ![3] If your system already has a relatively recent version of Mercurial installed, you can substitute `hg` for `sage -hg`.
* ![4] Or run `sage -python setup.py develop` to work "in place."  This is great for experimenting.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

"Uncompressed sagenb-0.6.spkg in tmp", etc (as suggested) and (1) there were no patch errors and (2) ran doctests - all passed :-)

Started the notebook using $SAGE_ROOT/sage and found "scilab (optional)" is magically now present! 

I tried a simple scilab command in the scilab console to make sure scilab was ok (I used eye(3,3) ), then tried it in the notebook and got

```

eye(3)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

    return system.eval(cmd, sage_globals, locals = sage_globals)

```

Let me know if I skipped something. (And definitely no offence taken - you left very good instructions - thanks :-)

Theres new (but different errors) :-(

To confirm them as reproducible, I 

* started from a pristine (backup) build,

* did only the "sage -python setup.py install" again, 

* started the notebook to confirm scilab dropdown option had been added (it was),

* quit the notebook (and sage) and added the new patch (as per your 4 line tip),

* checked scilab opens ok and can do eye(3,3) then I closed it and 

* restarted Sage and the notebook and selected the scilab option from the dropdown

I then tested both eye(3,3) and 1+1 (both resulted in the following error)

```

What happens if you run `scilab -nogui` at a shell prompt?  It possible that Sage can't find `scilab` in the search `PATH`.

To get some additional data:

```sh
cd $SAGE_ROOT
sage -t -optional devel/sage/sage/interfaces/scilab.py
```
With Scilab 5.2.0 on Linux, I get failures at lines 19, 123, 157, 340, and 505.  With the worksheet system set to `sage` (in the drop-down menu), evaluating `scilab('1 + 1')`, `scilab.eval('1 + 1')`, or

```py
%scilab
1 + 1
```
gives the expected answer, as does evaluating `1+1` with the worksheet system set to `scilab`.  Evaluating `scilab('1 + 1')` and `scilab.eval('1 + 1')` at the Sage command-line also works.

First, thanks for saving me all that work (and the explanation :-)

1) I installed scilab 5.2.0 (and I modified my path to include its binary path) and in running it I tried "scilab -nogui" and guess what... (it found scilab on the path and) NO ERROR!

2) Fired up the notebook, selected "scilab (optional)" then tried "1+1" and got...

...an error :-( 

But something was different, my spider-sense was tingling...  ;-)

I had forgot to export the new path (to scilab) in the terminal I was running Sage in.

I did that and... voila!

The following worked

```
# "scilab (optional)" selected from dropdown
1+1
------
eye(3,3)
------
# "sage" selected
%scilab
1+1
------
scilab('eye(3,3)')
------
% scilab
1+1
------
# only format that didnt work under "sage" dropdown was...
eval.scilab('1+1')
          	

Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
AttributeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute
'scilab'

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "_sage_input_8.py", line 4, in <module>
    open("___code___.py","w").write("# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n" + _support_.preparse_worksheet_cell(base64.b64decode("ZXZhbC5zY2lsYWIoJzErMScp"),globals())+"\n"); execfile(os.path.abspath("___code___.py"))

```

Now pls let me know what other checks I need to do and how to do some doc tests (all doc test might wait till I get a sage account soon)

That's great!  (`eval.scilab` should be `scilab.eval`.)

We should fix all doctests, i.e., ensure that

```sh
cd $SAGE_ROOT
sage -t -optional devel/sage/sage/interfaces/scilab.py
```
yields no failures.  This will require improving the sage repository patch above.  I'm changing this ticket to "needs work," for this reason.

The [developer's guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/index.html) (4.3.2.rc0 includes #8147), the [wiki page on Mercurial queues](http://wiki.sagemath.org/MercurialQueues?highlight=%28queues%29), and [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel) might be useful.  Don't hesitate to ask, if you have questions.

Tested this under sage-4.3.2 and 0.7.4 of the notebook. Requires scilab-5.2 or higher! 


Notebook and scilab interface doctests pass.


Many Scilab statements work under each of the following options:


(a) the "scilab (optional)" dropdown, as well as with

 
(b) "%scilab" directive on first line of a notebook cell and with

 
(c) scilab('<scilab-statement>') and

 
(d) scilab.eval('<scilab-statement>')


A couple of issues are likely to result in new tickets.

 

ISSUE (1)


The use of the scilab built-in constants: %e, %i, %pi etc cause errors
when they are the first expression in a statement in options (a)
and (b) above i.e.  %e + 1, %pi /4 crash under (a) and (b) - but are ok when using options (c)
and  (d)


(A workaround  until  a fix  is  created  is avoiding  these
constants at the beginning of a line i.e. reordering where possible or
prefixing with 0 i.e.  instead of "%e + 1", use "1 + %e"  or "0 + %e + 1")


ISSUE (2)


The  scilab  interface doesn't look like it's documented.  One  based  on  the  matlab
documentation [1] should do the job (and given I suggested it maybe that should fall to me :)


[1] http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/interfaces/matlab.html

These 2 issues  are new tickets whereas  this ticket solves  its stated goals (hence the positive review)
