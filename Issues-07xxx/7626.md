I noticed code like this in the sage-sage script:

```
     if [ "$SAGE_PBUILD" == "yes" ]; then 
         echo 'Pbuild is currently broken -- defaulting to serial build.' 
         # if [ "$@" ]; then 
         #     ln -snf "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage-"$@" "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage 
         # fi 
         # time python "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage/build.py -b 
         sage-build "$@" 
```

Not only is SAGE_PBUILD "broken", it has long since been replaced by something better.  So we should just delete this stuff from sage-sage.
