There was a thread on sage-devel where it seemed like a number of people felt plots (or axes!) were shifted by about one pixel or so.  Here's one manifestation:

```
region_plot([x^2+y^2<=1, x<=y], (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2),plot_points=400).show(aspect_ratio=1)
```

There are a lot of other examples in a thread on one of the sage mailing lists, but I can't find the thread.

I've attached a patch which is a workaround solving the problem.  However, it causes other side effects (fuzzy lines, since now lines are not snapped to whole-pixels).  You can uncomment the antialiased line in the patch to not get fuzzy lines, but then sometimes one axis will be one pixel wider than the other, which looks bad.  I haven't tested how these options affect vector graphics output (e.g., pdf).

So we have three options:

1. Leave things the way they are
2. Turn off snapping, but deal with possible fuzzy lines
3. Turn off snapping and turn off antialiasing, and deal with axes that sometimes don't match in width.

Pick your poison.

Setting path.snap to False makes all horizontal/vertical lines do the .set_snap(False) (not just the axes).  So using the rcParam as above would make all horizontal and vertical lines consistent.

In that case, all we have to do is set the matplotlib path.snap config parameter somewhere (either in our code, or provide a default matplotlibrc, or modify the default matplotlibrc in the spkg.

I played a little with Mathematica, and it seems like they have both crisp horizontal lines *and* perfect axes.  I'm not quite sure what they are doing, though.

I don't think the patch should be merged.  Instead, a new patch that does this:

```
import matplotlib
matplotlib.rcParams['path.snap'] = False
```

somewhere should be posted.  I think a vote should also be taken on sage-devel with before and after pics.

Thanks for volunteering :)  Thankfully, I've not even been taking home a computer that can compile Sage in less than one day home lately.

The reason I thought of this is a recent ask.sagemath.org post.
