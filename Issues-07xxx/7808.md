There was a thread on sage-devel where it seemed like a number of people felt plots (or axes!) were shifted by about one pixel or so.  Here's one manifestation:

```
region_plot([x^2+y^2<=1, x<=y], (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2),plot_points=400).show(aspect_ratio=1)
```

There are a lot of other examples in a thread on one of the sage mailing lists, but I can't find the thread.

Here is another example which clearly shows something is wrong:

```
bl = disk((0.0,0.0), 1, (pi, 3*pi/2), color='yellow')
tr = disk((0.0,0.0), 1, (0, pi/2), color='yellow')
tl = disk((0.0,0.0), 1, (pi/2, pi), color='black')
br = disk((0.0,0.0), 1, (3*pi/2, 2*pi), color='black')
P  = tl+tr+bl+br
P.show(aspect_ratio=1,xmin=-2,xmax=2,ymin=-2,ymax=2)
```

(from the disk doctests)

So we have three options:

3. Turn off snapping and turn off antialiasing, and deal with axes that sometimes don't match in width.

Pick your poison.

Instead of applying the patch above, you can also do:

1. Install #9208 (to the scripts repository)
2. If you've moved Sage from the build directory, then move it back to the original build location, delete SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/sage-current-location.txt, install #9210, start up and close down Sage, (and then you can move the sage directory back to wherever you had it in step 1).
2. Install the new matplotlib spkg at #9202

Now just type this in a notebook cell:

```
import matplotlib
matplotlib.rcParams['path.snap'] = False
```

Then the plots will go right through the origin.  This is equivalent (better, actually), than the patch above, as it makes *all* horizontal/vertical lines not snap to the nearest pixel.

So now the debate is if we should make path.snap by default False (it is True by default in matplotlib).

Setting path.snap to False makes all horizontal/vertical lines do the .set_snap(False) (not just the axes).  So using the rcParam as above would make all horizontal and vertical lines consistent.

In that case, all we have to do is set the matplotlib path.snap config parameter somewhere (either in our code, or provide a default matplotlibrc, or modify the default matplotlibrc in the spkg.

I played a little with Mathematica, and it seems like they have both crisp horizontal lines *and* perfect axes.  I'm not quite sure what they are doing, though.

I don't think the patch should be merged.  Instead, a new patch that does this:

```
import matplotlib
matplotlib.rcParams['path.snap'] = False
```

somewhere should be posted.  I think a vote should also be taken on sage-devel with before and after pics.
