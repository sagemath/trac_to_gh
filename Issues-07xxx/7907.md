The method  `__compute_omega_general()` in ell_curve_isogeny.py contains

```
        for j  in xrange(0,n-1):
            psi_prpr = psi_prpr + \
                binomial(j+2,2)*psi_coeffs[(j+2)]*cur_x_pow
            cur_x_pow = x*cur_x_pow
```
where the degree of the isogeny is 2*n+1.   In degree 3 (the only case doctested) n=1 and the loop is empty.  Otherwise there is a run-time error since the name "binomial" has not been imported.

This will be simple to patch, but of course as this indicated that higher degree isogenies in char.2 have not been tested, other issues might arise.

Patch up soon.

Here's an example of the failure which will be put into a doctest in the patch.

Before:

```
sage: F = GF(128,'a')                                     
sage: a = F.gen()                                         
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,0,0,0,(a**6+a**4+a**2+a)])     
sage: x = polygen(F)
sage: ker =  (x^6 + (a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a)*x^5 + (a^6 + a^5 + a^2 + 1)*x^4 + (a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + 1)*x^3 + (a^6 + a^3 + a)*x^2 + (a^4 + a^3 + 1)*x + a^5 + a^4 + a) 
sage: E.isogeny(ker)        
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: global name 'binomial' is not defined
```

After:

```
sage: F = GF(128,'a')                                     
sage: a = F.gen()                                         
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,0,0,0,(a**6+a**4+a**2+a)])     
sage: x = polygen(F)
sage: ker =  (x^6 + (a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a)*x^5 + (a^6 + a^5 + a^2 + 1)*x^4 + (a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + 1)*x^3 + (a^6 + a^3 + a)*x^2 + (a^4 + a^3 + 1)*x + a^5 + a^4 + a)
sage: E.isogeny(ker)                                      
Isogeny of degree 13 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y = x^3 + (a^6+a^4+a^2+a) over Finite Field in a of size 2^7 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y = x^3 + (a^6+a^5+a^4+a^3+a^2+a)*x + (a^5+a^3) over Finite Field in a of size 2^7
```
