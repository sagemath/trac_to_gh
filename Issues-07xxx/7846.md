Copying a worksheet in Sage 4.3.1.alpha0 sometimes gives

```python
          File "/home/sage/notebook/sagenb-0.4.9/sagenb/notebook/twist.py", line 795, in render
            W = notebook.copy_worksheet(self.worksheet, self.username)
          File "/home/sage/notebook/sagenb-0.4.9/sagenb/notebook/notebook.py", line 719, in copy_worksheet
            self._initialize_worksheet(ws, W)
          File "/home/sage/notebook/sagenb-0.4.9/sagenb/notebook/notebook.py", line 631, in _initialize_worksheet
            shutil.copytree(cells, target)
          File "/home/apps/sage/local/lib/python/shutil.py", line 177, in copytree
            raise Error, errors

Can you systematically trigger this?  It looks serious?  What was the worksheet that caused this.  The problem is probably symlinks to ___code___.py files being created when they shouldn't be, or something.   Those files should be completely ignored when copying the worksheet.

The attached patch should work for copying and re-publishing worksheets --- both use `Notebook._initialize_worksheet`.  But we should cover

```python
fname = 'foo.txt'
fd = open(fname, 'w')
fd.write('bar')
fd.close()

os.unlink(fname)

# This:

It seems safer to skip non-existent files.  I haven't changed the lines in `Notebook.migrate_old_worksheet`, since the they're wrapped in Try-N-Save blocks.

Should we delete all files that are temporarily symlinked but not actually in the final output?  Do people like to keep track of intermediaries?

Different problem: Should deleting a cell in the notebook delete its contents on disk?
