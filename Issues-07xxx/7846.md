Can you systematically trigger this?  It looks serious?  What was the worksheet that caused this.  The problem is probably symlinks to ___code___.py files being created when they shouldn't be, or something.   Those files should be completely ignored when copying the worksheet.

The attached patch should work for copying and re-publishing worksheets --- both use `Notebook._initialize_worksheet`.  But we should cover

```python
fname = 'foo.txt'
fd = open(fname, 'w')
fd.write('bar')
fd.close()
print os.listdir('.')
import time; time.sleep(3)
os.unlink(fname)
print os.listdir('.')
```

Which is better

    ignore = []
    for x in dirlist:
        if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(curdir, x)):

    return ignore

# This:
shutil.copytree('foo', 'bar', ignore=ignore_nonexistent_files)
# Or this:
shutil.copytree('foo', 'bar', symlinks=True)
```
?  We use [shutil.copytree](http://docs.python.org/library/shutil.html#shutil.copytree) in 5 places under `sagenb`.  If it's necessary, I can add `sagenb.misc.misc.ignore_nonexistent_files`.

It seems safer to skip non-existent files.  I haven't changed the lines in `Notebook.migrate_old_worksheet`, since the they're wrapped in Try-N-Save blocks.

Should we delete all files that are temporarily symlinked but not actually in the final output?  Do people like to keep track of intermediaries?

Different problem: Should deleting a cell in the notebook delete its contents on disk?
