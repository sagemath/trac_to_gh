<a id='comment:13'></a>
Also see #8352, which makes a very small change to twisted's spkg-install file, so the previous version of twisted builds on any platform as 64-bit, not just OS X. 

Basically changing 

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   echo "64 bit MacIntel"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 "; export CFLAGS
   LDFLAGS="-m64 "; export LDFLAGS
fi

```

to

```
if ["x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
   echo "64 bit build"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 "; export CFLAGS
   LDFLAGS="-m64 "; export LDFLAGS
fi
```

I'm happy to give the other ticket positive review, but are not going to just now, until I find the best way of handling this.

I got no feedback from sage-devel on the best way to handle this, so I've give #8352 positive review. 

I'm not marking it as 'needs work', as that might not be the right thing to do, it might be best if you incorporate the changes from that ticket too.
