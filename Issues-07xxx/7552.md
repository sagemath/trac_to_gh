<a id='comment:13'></a>Also see #8352, which makes a very small change to twisted's spkg-install file, so the previous version of twisted builds on any platform as 64-bit, not just OS X. 

Basically changing 

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   echo "64 bit MacIntel"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 "; export CFLAGS
   LDFLAGS="-m64 "; export LDFLAGS
fi

```

to

```
if ["x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
   echo "64 bit build"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 "; export CFLAGS
   LDFLAGS="-m64 "; export LDFLAGS
fi
```

I'm happy to give the other ticket positive review, but are not going to just now, until I find the best way of handling this.
