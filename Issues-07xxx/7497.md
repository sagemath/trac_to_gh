In the notebook, click "Data --> Upload or create file...", then edit the file to contain

```
Hi </textarea> foo bar 
```

Save it and re-open it.  The foo bar is *outside* the text area!  This is because this is rendered using the data/sage/html/notebook/download_or_delete_datafile.html template with this line in it:

```
    <textarea class="edit" name="textfield" rows=17 cols=70 
    id="textfield">{{ text_file_content }}</textarea>
```
