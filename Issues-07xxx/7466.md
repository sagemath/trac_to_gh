On Sage 4.3.alpha1, I first deleted the `output/` directory and then proceeded to rebuild the HTML version of the reference manual:

```

This resulted in 34 warnings. To apply patches to Sage 4.3.alpha1, first you must resolve the issue of missing image files as reported at ticket #7606. I again removed the `output/` directory, deleted everything under the directory `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/server/` *except* for
