On sage.math, before the patch:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/rings/arith.py"         
         [162.6 s]
```

And after the patch:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/rings/arith.py"         
         [50.2 s]
```

I'm putting the milestone as 4.3 only because this is almost certainly not going to break anything whatsoever.  Please change it to 4.3.1 if you think that's more appropriate.

> I see what you did here: (1) you removed tha 'gap' algorithm from the test, presumably because it was slowest

Actually, the splitting into range(2, 2255) including 'gap' and range(2256, 5000) excluding 'gap' was there before I touched this, and it was indeed because gap gets rather slow at doing this computation.  The only real change I made was to pick 500 integers in each range instead of testing the whole range.
