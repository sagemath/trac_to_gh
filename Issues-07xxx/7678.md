On sage.math, before the patch:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/rings/arith.py"         
         [162.6 s]
```

And after the patch:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/rings/arith.py"         
         [50.2 s]
```

I'm putting the milestone as 4.3 only because this is almost certainly not going to break anything whatsoever.  Please change it to 4.3.1 if you think that's more appropriate.

I see what you did here: (1) you removed tha 'gap' algorithm from the test, presumably because it was slowest, and (2) instead of testing all i in each of the ranges 2 to 2255 and 2256 to  5000 you pick 500 random indices from those ranges and use those.

I don't think that strategy (2) is a good idea, since if this test ever fails it will be hard to find out exactly where (i.e. for which i).  The tests in our standard test suite should surely be deterministic.  What I did in a similar situation was to once and for all pick a random set of indices, and make the doctest test those indices only.  This does not prevent us from having a more strenuous test to do on occasion, I am only proposing limiting what happens every time the whole of Sage is tested.

For that reason (only) I have put this as "needs work", and will post to sage-devel so that others who commented on your observation can come and have their say.

Actually, the splitting into range(2, 2255) including 'gap' and range(2256, 5000) excluding 'gap' was there before I touched this, and it was indeed because gap gets rather slow at doing this computation.  The only real change I made was to pick 500 integers in each range instead of testing the whole range.
