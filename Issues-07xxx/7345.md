Builds fine on Mac OS X 10.6 and sage.math, and installs what look like the right libraries in the right place.  What can I do to test it?

I've marked it as "needs work" because the SPKG.txt file says "libjpeg" several places instead of "libtiff".

Is the spkg-install file modeled after other ones currently in use?  (Will drkirby complain about gnuisms, for instance, or is this derived from one of his spkg-install files?)

Updated version found here: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/timdumol/libtiff-3.9.4.spkg

This should fix the OS X 10.6 problems (c.f. #7344).

```
sage: import Image
sage: im = Image.open("<your-tiff-file-here>")
sage: im = im.resize((im.size[0]/2,im.size[1]/2))
sage: print im.format, im.size, im.mode
TIFF (455, 495) 1
sage: im.show()
sage: im.save("wherever.tiff")
```

There are some problems on OS X:

```
sage: im = Image.open('/Users/palmieri/Desktop/P1000717.tiff')
sage: im.show()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IOError                                   Traceback (most recent call last)
...
IOError: encoder jpeg not available
sage: im = im.resize((im.size[0]/2,im.size[1]/2))
sage: print im.format
None
```

By the way, according to ImageMagick's "identify" program:

```
$ identify P1000717.tiff 
P1000717.tiff TIFF 3648x2736 3648x2736+0+0 DirectClass 8-bit 28.5613mb 
```
So I think it's the right format to be opened by this library.  Is there anything else I should check?

sage: print im.format
None

According to the earlier example, this should have said "TIFF".

Replying to [timdumol](#comment%3A13):
> In the notebook, `im.show()` saves a JPEG into the worksheet directory, which is then automatically displayed by the SageNB.


May I ask why? Does it make any sense to convert a "lossless image" into a lossy format, i.e., why not convert it to e.g. PNG which any (GUI) browser should be able to display?

(I know TIFF is also a "meta format", i.e. you can encapsulate JPEGs in a TIFF file, but John's example file doesn't look like it was such.)

The only reason I can imagine is that it's easier to scale JPEG images than bitmaps, but unless we include the batteries by default, a simple `show()` of a bitmap image shouldn't require `libjpeg`.
