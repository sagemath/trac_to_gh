I ran the magma optional test suite on skynet (eno):

```
./sage -t --only_optional=magma devel/sage/sage > magma.out&
```

And the failures are:

```
        sage -t --only_optional=magma "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx"
        sage -t --only_optional=magma "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ring_generic.pyx"

I tested again using the new magma V2.16-7 with sage-4.3.5. 

```
[wstein@eno sage-4.3.5]$ magma
Magma V2.16-7     Tue Apr  6 2010 11:14:18 on eno      [Seed = 3125460604]
Type ? for help.  Type <Ctrl>-D to quit.
```
There are now even more failures.  I've attached a new test log created using the following on eno:

```
./sage -tp 10 -only_optional=magma devel/sage/sage
```

John,

I think you should give my patch a positive review anyways.  The problem above is that in Magma V2.16-7, this works fine:

```
[wstein@eno ~]$ magma
Magma V2.16-7     Mon Apr 26 2010 22:51:34 on eno      [Seed = 294390646]
Type ? for help.  Type <Ctrl>-D to quit.
> R<x> := PolynomialRing(Integers());
> x*1.0;
$.1
> 
```
However, in older versions of Magma, it doesn't:

```
flat:~ wstein$ magma
Magma V2.15-11    Mon Apr 26 2010 19:53:21 on flat     [Seed = 4201111680]
Type ? for help.  Type <Ctrl>-D to quit.
> R<x> := PolynomialRing(Integers());
> x*1.0;

>> x*1.0;
    ^
Runtime error in '*': Bad argument types
Argument types given: RngUPolElt[RngInt], FldReElt
```

Since Magma's capabilities, etc., change a *lot* -- even from minor version to version -- I think the Sage optional doctests should be targeted at the latest released version of Magma.   

Note that the computation is multiplying a polynomial over ZZ[x] by a floating point numbers.  In Sage, there is a beautiful coercion model that makes most such things "just work".  In Magma, one implements the '*' function for every conceivable choice of pairs of types... and I guess somebody got around to eventually implementing this one. 

Just to emphasize how totally arbitrary (and sad) Magma's system still is after all these years, notice that even in Magma V2.16-7, the same computation with polynomials over ZZ and rational numbers doesn't work!

```
> x + 1/2;        

>> x + 1/2;
     ^
Runtime error in '+': Bad argument types
Argument types given: RngUPolElt[RngInt], FldRatElt

> x*(1/2);

>> x*(1/2);
    ^
Runtime error in '*': Bad argument types
Argument types given: RngUPolElt[RngInt], FldRatElt

> 
```

Sage had the same sort of silly anomalies until people like David Harvey, Craig Citro, David Roe, and *Robert Bradshaw* and others stepped in and greatly improved the situation. 

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: x * 1.0
x
sage: parent(x * 1.0)
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: x + 1/2
x + 1/2
sage: (1/2)*x
1/2*x
```

Sage coercion is still of course far from perfect.  But it's also far from sucking.

I just lost my posting here (cookie problem) and don't feel like rewriting it all....

I only have C2.16-1 and the patch requires V2.16-7 or higher to pass, it seems, so I cannot verify it at present.

Is it anywhere documented which version of Magma Sage relies on for positive tests?

Is there any explanation of why these doc tests need to be revised? I can see 

sage/symbolic/expression.pyx

has a pretty trivial change, since Magma has decided to reverse the order of the outputs. 

But others seem really odd. 

magma(HyperellipticCurve(f)).IgusaClebschInvariants() # optional - magma 
remove: [ 0, -2048/375, -4096/25, -4881645568/84375 ] 
add: [ -640, -20480, 1310720, 52160364544 ] 

Were the first set of Magma results wrong? If so, why was they used as a doctest? 

This is probably my lack of mathematical knowledge showing here, but it appears to me Magma has output something completely different in many cases. Is the new output correct? Was the old output incorrect? 

Dave

That makes a lot of sence and should probably be put in some sort of guide to using trac. Is there one specifically for Sage? 

I know I came unstuck recently when I put a link to an spkg in the description, but that spkg needed tekinfo (or whatever it was), so Francois posted one which did not need it. But mine was in the description, his one was less prominently placed in the notes, so you used mine and found it did not work.

According to the `sage -h`, the option should be `-only-optional=magma` and **not** `--only-optional=magma`


I don't have Magma, but do have Mathematica, so I thought I'd try

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.2.rc1$ ./sage -t -only_optional=mathematica devel/sage/sage
sage -t -only_optional=mathematica "devel/sage/sage/probability/all.py"

sage -t -only_optional=mathematica "devel/sage/sage/probability/__init__.py"
	 [0.1 s]
sage -t -only_optional=mathematica "devel/sage/sage/probability/random_variable.py"
```

but it seems to run every doctest, not just the Mathematica ones, which fail anyway, as noted at #8495.

With the earlier patch (patch3) and the latest magma I tested everything and got no errors, so it seems like a waste of (my) time to do it all again.

I do not understand mraum's comments about doing tests on a machine with no magma.  I ran complete tests with and without  -only-optional=magma.
