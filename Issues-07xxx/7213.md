Positive review.

This can be closed now. The updated ECL spkg is up in the standard spkg repository on sagemath.org and has been mirrored out. See

http://mirror.switch.ch/mirror/sagemath/spkg/standard/ecl-9.8.4-20090913cvs.p3.spkg

```
07:39 < mvngu> schilly: But you should note ticket #7213.
07:40 < mvngu> schilly: If people upgrade to Sage 4.1.2 and they have problem
               with ECL, then ticket #7213
07:40 < mvngu> is the answer.
07:40 < mvngu> schilly: I just gave it a postive review.
07:41 < mvngu> schilly: So the standard packages respository on sagemath.org
               should have that updated ECL spkg.
07:41 < mvngu> schilly: Otherwise upgrade would result in a path error with ECL.
07:42 < schilly> mhm, ok ...
07:42 < schilly> if it is updated in the usual place, it will be on the mirrors
07:43 < mvngu> schilly: I mean update the standard spkg on sagemath.org with
               that ECL spkg, and mirror out this updated spkg.
07:43 < schilly> ok, filename is the same
07:43 < schilly> yes, just looked at www-files/packages/standard ... it's the
                 same
07:44 < mvngu> schilly: It says ".p3"?
07:44 < schilly> http://mirror.switch.ch/mirror/sagemath/spkg/standard/
07:45 < mvngu> schilly: cool.
07:45 < schilly> ;)
07:45 < mvngu> schilly: Maybe wstein took care of updating that repo.
07:46 < schilly> he copied over to the usual place
                 (www-files/packages/standard) and that's all he has to do
07:46 < schilly> then he mirrored it together with the new source
07:46 < schilly> or i did it when i checked the mirror-ing earlier this day
07:47 < schilly> so, it's already on the servers
07:47 < mvngu> That's good to know.
07:48 < schilly> the only thing i don't understand is, why the source tarball 
                 of 4.1.1 is newer than the newer one for 4.1.2
07:48 < schilly> probably some copy-activity or replacement. i'll move 4.1.1 to 
                 the older files anyways
