FreeBSD refers to the x86_64 architecture under its original name of 'amd64' so use this as an alias for x86_64.  The `-fPIC' fix is needed to correct:

Hi Peter, 

Thank you for cc'ing me. 

The fix looks like it will resolve the FreeBSD issue, but there is an obvious problem with the SPARC platform on that line, as -fPIC will be selected there too, which may not always be appropriate. 

If #7818 gets implemented, it will add a variable FPIC_FLAG which could be set once for any compiler. I don't know if you could change this so spkg-install has something like

```
FPIC_FLAG=-fPIC
```
then use $FPIC_FLAG in pari-2.3.3.p5/patches/get_dlcflags. 

That way, it should work today, and with simple removal of the one line from spkg-install, this could work with any compiler. 

Oh why was there never a standard for compiler flags! Life would be so much easier. 

Dave
