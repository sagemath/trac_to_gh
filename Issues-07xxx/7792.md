Somethings up with these patches.  Both povray_doc.patch and povray_doc.2.patch are identical and won't apply on top of povray.py.  Also, the file is missing class-level documentation and doctests, (as mhampton noted, you should move the file-level doc back) and nothing is doctested in the methods.
