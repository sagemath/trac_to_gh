Due to a bug in Solaris, MPFR can fail tests on sun4v machines.

We have solved this (#6453) some months back.,I added some code to a shell script that could apply the patch or not depending on whether INCLUDE_MPFR_PATCH was set to 1 (apply patch) or 0 (do not apply). Given other variable in Sage use "yes" or "no", it would be sensible this was changed to be consistent. Clearly this is a very trivial patch,
