There is a generic group method called `quotient`, which is meant to return the quotient group by a normal subgroup, and is meant to be overridden by inheriting classes.  However, the corresponding method for permutation groups is called `quotient_group` instead:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: N = S.normal_subgroups()[1]
sage: S.quotient(N)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/ghitza/.sage/temp/artin/674/_home_ghitza__sage_init_sage_0.py in <module>()

/home/ghitza/sage-stable/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/groups/group.so in sage.groups.group.Group.quotient (sage/groups/group.c:1719)()

NotImplementedError: 
sage: S.quotient_group(N)
Permutation Group with generators [(), (1,2)]
```

The attached patch renames the permutation group method to `quotient` and deprecates `quotient_group`.
