In some parts of Sage, it is desirable to know what compiler is being used - in particular if its gcc or Sun, but there are other cases too. 

The two scripts check the variable CC and CXX, and try to determine what the compiler is. I've no idea where the scripts should go though - ultimately they should be copied to SAGE_LOCAL/bin, but if great if someone can put them in a sensible place to start with. I would be appreciate that. 

The scripts can report one of several answers.  

* GNU (for GNU gcc, on any platform.)
* Sun_on_Solaris (for the Sun Studio compiler on Solaris)
* Intel_improved_GCC (An improved commercial version of gcc by Intel. Compatible with gcc, but supposedly faster)
* Sun_improved_GCC (A compiler by Sun, that appears to code to be gcc, but uses Sun Studio as a back-end.)
* HP_on_Alpha_Linux (HP compiler on Alpha hardware running Linux)
* HP_on_HPUX (HP's commerical compiler on HP-UX)
* IBM_on_AIX (IBM's commercial compiler on AIX)
* HP_on_Tru64 (HP's commerical compiler on Tru64)
* Unknown  (The scripts can't work out what the compiler is). 

These two scripts work by testing what pre-processor directives the compilers test. For example, gcc will define !__GNUC!__. 

But so will the Intel and Sun compilers which try to be GNU like. But the Intel one will define !__INTEL_COMPILER and the Sun compilers define !__SUNPRO_C so it's possible to differentiate the GNU, Intel and Sun compilers, even though they all aim to be GCC-like. 

Compiler documentation was obtained from various sites, and is documented in the scripts. 
 == Testing ==
Obviously a reviewer can test these scripts on any platforms they have access to, but here are some tests I performed. I've not managed to check these scripts on every platform and compiler for which they are aimed to work on, due to lack of access to the hardware. 

* On a Sun Blade 2000 SPARC box, with Sun Studio 12.1

```
drkirkby@swan:[~] $ uname -a
SunOS swan 5.10 Generic_139555-08 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Blade-1000
drkirkby@swan:[~] $ echo $CC
/opt/xxxsunstudio12.1/bin/cc
drkirkby@swan:[~] $ echo $CXX
/opt/xxxsunstudio12.1/bin/CC
drkirkby@swan:[~] $ ./testcc
Sun_on_Solaris
drkirkby@swan:[~] $ ./testcxx
Sun_on_Solaris
```

*  On the same Sun Blade 2000, but with CC and CXX set to gcc and g++

```
drkirkby@swan:[~] $ export CC=gcc
drkirkby@swan:[~] $ export CXX=g++
drkirkby@swan:[~] $ ./testcc 
GNU
drkirkby@swan:[~] $ ./testcxx
GNU
```

* On a Sun Ultra 27, but with CC defined to be a simple *hello world program*, to prove the code returns *Unknown* when it can not determine the compiler. 

```
SunOS hawk 5.11 snv_111b i86pc i386 i86pc
bash-3.2$ gcc hello.c -o hello
bash-3.2$ export CC=./hello
bash-3.2$ ./testcc
Unknown
```

* On an IBM machine running AIX 6.

```
$ uname -a
AIX client9 1 6 00C6B7C04C00
$ export CC=gcc
$ export CXX=g++
$ ./testcc
GNU
$ ./testcxx
GNU
```

* On the same IBM machine running AIX 6, but with CC and CXX set to the IBM commercial compilers. 

```
$ uname -a
AIX client9 1 6 00C6B7C04C00
$ export CC=/usr/vacpp/bin/xlc
$ export CXX=/usr/vacpp/bin/xlc++
$ ./testcc
IBM_on_AIX
$ ./testcxx
IBM_on_AIX
```

* On a HP C3600 running HP-UX 11.11, CC and CXX set to GNU compilers. 

```
$ uname -a
HP-UX hpbox B.11.11 U 9000/785 2016698240 unlimited-user license
$ export CC=gcc
$ export CXX=g++
$ ./testcc
GNU
$ ./testcxx
GNU
```

* On the same HP C3600, but this time using trial versions of HP's commercial C and C++ compilers. 

```
$ export CC=/opt/ansic/bin/cc
$ export CXX=/opt/aCC/bin/aCC
$ ./testcc
HP_on_HPUX
$ ./testcxx
HP_on_HPUX
```

* On a linux machine (sage.math.washington.edu), with the variable CC and CXX not set. In this case, the exit code is 1, not 0. 

```
kirkby@sage:~$ unset CC
kirkby@sage:~$ unset CXX
kirkby@sage:~$ ./testcc
Sorry, you should define the environment variable CC
kirkby@sage:~$ ./testcxx
Sorry, you should define the environment variable CXX
```

* On the same Linux machine, but with CC and CXX set to locations of GNU compilers. In one case an absolute path is given, in the other case it is not 

```
kirkby@sage:~$ uname -a
Linux sage.math.washington.edu 2.6.24-23-server #1 SMP Wed Apr 1 22:14:30 UTC 2009 x86_64 GNU/Linux
kirkby@sage:~$ export CC=/usr/bin/gcc
kirkby@sage:~$ export CXX=g++
kirkby@sage:~$ ./testcc
GNU
kirkby@sage:~$ ./testcxx
GNU
```

* On an Apple (bsd.math.washington.edu) running OS X 

```
[kirkby@bsd ~]$ uname -a
Darwin bsd.local 10.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 10.2.0: Tue Nov  3 10:37:10 PST 2009; root:xnu-1486.2.11~1/RELEASE_I386 i386 i386 MacPro1,1 Darwin
[kirkby@bsd ~]$ export CC=gcc
[kirkby@bsd ~]$ export CXX=g++
[kirkby@bsd ~]$ ./testcc
GNU
[kirkby@bsd ~]$ ./testcxx
GNU
```

The code was tested by someone else on Tru64, but I can not show the results of this. 

I have not verified it with the Sun or Intel compilers which are GCC compatible, nor on Alpha linux. In each case, I've used compiler documentation, and hope it is right.

I was worried that the sage_scripts repository would be installed too late for these scripts but I was wrong. I agree with Mike that this is where these scripts belong.

The only issue I can see is that `# of C++ code, and checking what are defined.` in testcc should be `C code`. There are a few of these copy'n'paste 'errors' in the docs, which are beautiful in general! 

Also, I'd call the scripts `testcc.sh` and `testcxx.sh` to emphasise that they are shell scripts.

I thought it would be better if they returned 'GNU' for **any** compiler which was like gcc (i.e. whether produced by Sun, Intel or HP), and only gave very specific information about whether it was Sun/Intel/HP if an option was passed to the scripts. This is because, in 99% of cases, the user will only want to know if the compiler acts like gcc, and will probably not care if it the GNU distribution, or an improved one from HP, Intel or Sun. 

Once I know exactly what you mean by your comment, I'll make the changes, rename the files with a .sh extension, and submit again for review. 
Dave

Having looked at prereq, it is not a collection of scripts, so I do not believe that is the appropriate place for them. 

I believe if the two scripts are put in the directory 

```
$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/
```

and the file 

```
$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install
```

is updated to copy these two scripts to $SAGE_LOCAL/bin (as it does some other files), then that will solve the problem. That 'SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install' script is run very early (before even prereq), so an added bonus is that the script could be called from within prereq if needed. 

I'm not sure how to check these in properly though vi hg. I've never got to grips with that properly. I'll drop you an email about that. 

I'm attaching the revised install script, and the patch file.

The review of this has got a bit complex, mainly since agreeing where the scripts should go has not been without some problem, but I also slightly changed the output shown, in view of difficulty of the fact Sun Studio can be run on Solaris, and difficulties finding some information I wanted. 

Hence I thought I'd clarify some things. 

The scripts output one of:

* GCC
* Sun_Studio
* HP_on_Tru64
* HP_on_Alpha_Linux
* HP_on_HP-UX
* IBM_on_AIX
* Unknown

I believe the scripts (see attached) should be:

```
$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/testcc.sh
$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/testcxx.sh
```
The file

```
$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install
```
needs to be modified (patch attached), so it copies the two scripts to 

```
$SAGE_LOCAL/bin
```

in addition to the files it already copies there. This allows the scripts to be called from anywhere, including the prereq script, which might be necessary. 

The scripts can't actually break anything in Sage, as they are not called at all. But calling them will simplify a lot of portability issues later one.

REFEREE REPORT:

Please read everything below before making any changes.

1. In the usage it says:
"Will return one of the following, to indicate the C compiler". 
However, shell scripts don't return anything.  It is more precise to say "Will print one of the following to stdout, to indicate the C compiler."

2. I would expect to also get the usage message when CC isn't defined. 

```
flat:Downloads wstein$ ./testcc.sh
Sorry, you must define the environment variable CC
```

Currently, the *only* way to get the usage is to call the command with an extra argument (in which case one doesn't get an error message, by the way):

```
flat:Downloads wstein$ ./testcc.sh foo
Usage: ./testcc.sh
  Will return one of the following, to indicate the C compiler
...
```



3. Perhaps change the message to say "You must export the CC environment variable", because of course defining the CC variable as instructed above doesn't work:

```
flat:Downloads wstein$ CC=gcc
flat:Downloads wstein$ ./testcc.sh 
Sorry, you must define the environment variable CC
flat:Downloads wstein$ CC=gcc; export CC
flat:Downloads wstein$ ./testcc.sh 
GCC
```

4. I wonder about the design. If I were writing this script I would make it take a single argument:

```
$  ./testcc.sh <path to compiler>
```
instead of using an environment variable.   Then the usage info would naturally be printed no matter what when one does 

```
$ ./testcc.sh
```
and one doesn't have to mess with (= muck up) the environment at all in order to use this command.     You could use it like you already plan to by just doing

```
testcc.sh "$CC"
```
To me, that would fit much, much better with standard conventions for command line tools. 

5. I think the script should immediately bail in case 

```
TESTFILE=/tmp/test.$$.c
```
already exists.  Its entirely possible somebody else makes a shell script that uses a similar "strategy" for making temp files and your script just clobbers them.  (The right way to make temp files is to use the tmpfile C library calls.  It would be reasonably easy to rewrite this script, say in Python, to do that, and then temp files would be properly handled and never clash.  This should be done later, since your script is nicely laying down the interface.   Yes, this would depend on some Python being installed system-wide, but that's OK.)

Maybe you could completely avoid using temp files by using - to get input from stdin, e.g. use `$CC -` and pipe the input in. 

```
$ echo "main(){}" | gcc - -E
# 1 "<stdin>"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 1 "<stdin>"
main(){}
```


SUMMARY: I personally think that testcc and testcxx should take one command line argument instead of using the environment to pass arguments.  Their documentation could be slightly clarified.  The use of the temp file could also be very slightly made more robust.   In fact -- much better -- perhaps just rewrite the script to not use temp files at all. 

Sorry for being so picky.  It's just because I just spent a bunch of my limited time reading through this all very carefully and just want to contribute something of value.

each case, the test scripts work as claimed. We can say that the scripts have been tested and work as claimed on various versions of the following platforms with GCC and the relevant commercial compilers: AIX, Cygwin on Windows XP, Fedora, HP-UX, Mac OS X, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Solaris, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Ubuntu. So far, no one has been able to test the scripts on Tru64 or Alpha Linux because we don't have access to the relevant platform/hardware combinations. At this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/8ea858e120eec662) thread, Peter Jeremy mentions that he has access to a Tru64 machine, but he won't be able to test the scripts on that machine within the next few weeks from now. But that should not prevent the scripts from being merged in Sage.\n\n\n\n\nThe patch `trac_7505-test-scripts.patch` needs to be applied to `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base`. But note that with Sage 4.3 some files under `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` are not yet managed by revision control:\n\n```\n[mvngu@boxen base]$ pwd\n/dev/shm/mvngu/sage-4.3/spkg/base\n[mvngu@boxen base]$ hg st\nM sage-env\nM sage-spkg\n! prereq-0.3-install\n? prereq-0.5-install\n? prereq-0.5.tar\n```\nThe file `prereq-0.3-install` is now superseded by `prereq-0.5-install` so `prereq-0.3-install` can be removed as follows:\n\n```\n[mvngu@boxen base]$ hg remove prereq-0.3-install\n[mvngu@boxen base]$ hg st\nM sage-env\nM sage-spkg\nR prereq-0.3-install\n? prereq-0.5-install\n? prereq-0.5.tar\n```\nAlso, the file `prereq-0.5-install` needs to be checked in with:\n\n```\n[mvngu@boxen base]$ hg add prereq-0.5-install\n[mvngu@boxen base]$ hg st\nM sage-env\nM sage-spkg\nA prereq-0.5-install\nR prereq-0.3-install\n? prereq-0.5.tar\n```\nBut the file `prereq-0.5.tar` need not be under revision control. In that case, the release manager could edit the file `.hgignore` to ignore that particular tarball. Anyway, I have attached the patch `trac_7505-revision-control.patch` which should take care of editing `.hgignore`, adding `prereq-0.5-install` and removing `prereq-0.3-install`. I have attached a version of David Kirkby's patch that contains his name so that when his scripts are checked in, they are committed in his name. Finally, note that the files `sage-env` and `sage-spkg` must be first checked in before applying any of the above patches. That is, patches/changes should be applied/made to the directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` in the following order:\n\n1. Check in the changes to `sage-env` and `sage-spkg`.\n2. Apply `trac_7505-revision-control.patch` to properly put three existing files under revision control.\n3. Finally, apply `trac_7505-scripts.patch` which has the same changes as `trac_7505-test-scripts.patch`, but any check ins would be made in David's name.",

The patch `trac_7505-test-scripts.patch` contains two shell scripts: one for testing the type of C compiler, and the other for testing the type of C++ compiler. Here are the results of my testing them on different combinations of platform and hardware:

* AIX 6.1 (access provided by OpenAIX at http://www.metamodul.com/10.html), PowerPC_POWER5 `@` 2097 MHz, with GCC 4.2.4. Unfortunately, the license for the IBM commercial compilers on this machine has expired, so I wasn't able to use those IBM compilers to test the scripts.

In each case, the test scripts work as claimed. We can say that the scripts have been tested and work as claimed on various versions of the following platforms with GCC and the relevant commercial compilers: AIX, Cygwin on Windows XP, Fedora, HP-UX, Mac OS X, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Solaris, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Ubuntu. So far, no one has been able to test the scripts on Tru64 or Alpha Linux because we don't have access to the relevant platform/hardware combinations. At this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/8ea858e120eec662) thread, Peter Jeremy mentions that he has access to a Tru64 machine, but he won't be able to test the scripts on that machine within the next few weeks from now. But that should not prevent the scripts from being merged in Sage.




The patch `trac_7505-test-scripts.patch` needs to be applied to `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base`. But note that with Sage 4.3 some files under `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` are not yet managed by revision control:

```
[mvngu@boxen base]$ pwd
/dev/shm/mvngu/sage-4.3/spkg/base
[mvngu@boxen base]$ hg st
M sage-env
M sage-spkg
! prereq-0.3-install
? prereq-0.5-install
? prereq-0.5.tar
```
The file `prereq-0.3-install` is now superseded by `prereq-0.5-install` so `prereq-0.3-install` can be removed as follows:

```
[mvngu@boxen base]$ hg remove prereq-0.3-install
[mvngu@boxen base]$ hg st
M sage-env
M sage-spkg
R prereq-0.3-install
? prereq-0.5-install
? prereq-0.5.tar
```
Also, the file `prereq-0.5-install` needs to be checked in with:

```
[mvngu@boxen base]$ hg add prereq-0.5-install
[mvngu@boxen base]$ hg st
M sage-env
M sage-spkg
A prereq-0.5-install
R prereq-0.3-install
? prereq-0.5.tar
```
But the file `prereq-0.5.tar` need not be under revision control. In that case, the release manager could edit the file `.hgignore` to ignore that particular tarball. Anyway, I have attached the patch `trac_7505-revision-control.patch` which should take care of editing `.hgignore`, adding `prereq-0.5-install` and removing `prereq-0.3-install`. I have attached a version of David Kirkby's patch that contains his name so that when his scripts are checked in, they are committed in his name. Finally, note that the files `sage-env` and `sage-spkg` must be first checked in before applying any of the above patches. That is, patches/changes should be applied/made to the directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base` in the following order:

1. Check in the changes to `sage-env` and `sage-spkg`.
2. Apply `trac_7505-revision-control.patch` to properly put three existing files under revision control.
3. Finally, apply `trac_7505-scripts.patch` which has the same changes as `trac_7505-test-scripts.patch`, but any check ins would be made in David's name.

There is a mismatch in documentation in `testcc.2.sh`:

```
54  # Exit if the user supplies any command-line arguments.
55	if [ $# -ne 1 ] ; then
56	  usage
57	  exit 1
58	fi
59	CC_LOCAL=$1
```
Do you also want to change the above section to something like the following?

```
# Exit if the user does not supply one command line argument.
if [ $# -ne 1 ] ; then
  usage
  exit 1
fi

CC_LOCAL=$1 # Compiler name or path as argument to script. 
```
This would also be in line with the corresponding documentation in `testcxx.2.sh`.




PS: If you want to replace an earlier version of an attachment with the same name, you could do so. On the page for uploading files, there should be a check box to indicate that you want to replace files of the same name.
