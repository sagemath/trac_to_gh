I think it is important to add on platforms such as Solaris, AIX and HP-UX, where both 32 and 64-bit builds are supported, the library path **must** point to the 32-bit library if building 32-bit, and must point to a 64-bit library if building 64-bit. 

(How about OS X? Perhaps the fortran.spkg takes care of that.) 

On Solaris that will probably be the following, though this would need checking.

```
SAGE_FORTRAN=/path/to/gcc/install/directory/bin/gfortran (SPARC and x86)

SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB=/path/to/gcc/install/directory/lib/libgfortran.so (32-bit SPARC)
SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB=/path/to/gcc/install/directory/lib/sparcv9/libgfortran.so (64-bit SPARC)

SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB=/path/to/gcc/install/directory/lib/libgfortran.so (32-bit x86)
SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB=/path/to/gcc/install/directory/lib/amd64/libgfortran.so (64-bit x64)
```

William, you said on sage-devel, on the subject of SAGE_FORTRAN and OS X. 

*Use the binary included in Sage if SAGE_FORTRAN is not specified. Otherwise, use the one pointed to by the that environment variable. *

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e2867ea2efe7e052

Therefore, SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB might be important if someone wanted to use their own version of gcc, rather than the one in Sage. In which case, the question arises as to what would be the path to the library. Would it be different for 32 and 64-bit builds, as it is on Solaris and HP-UX? 

Dave

README.txt was recently updated, so this will need to be rebased again.  Is the original problem still a problem, given the latest one?

With respect to drkirkby's comments, I think the following remain:

This seems reasonable to change.

I have no idea if this is true, but at any rate we still use the phrase "system-wide" in line 137.

These three seem to be a matter of taste.  As long as we accurately document what Sage builds with, we might as well leave it alone.  And warnings of things that fail are good if they prevent people from wasting time trying to make them fail :)
