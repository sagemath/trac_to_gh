Okay, great.  If that doesn't happen, then I already made the ticket and patch:

http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7484

This can be closed (or modified) to indicate the need for gfortran on all platforms, whenever that patch is merged.

(How about OS X? Perhaps the fortran.spkg takes care of that.) 

On Solaris that will probably be the following, though this would need checking.

```
SAGE_FORTRAN=/path/to/gcc/install/directory/bin/gfortran (SPARC and x86)

SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB=/path/to/gcc/install/directory/lib/libgfortran.so (32-bit SPARC)
SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB=/path/to/gcc/install/directory/lib/sparcv9/libgfortran.so (64-bit SPARC)

SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB=/path/to/gcc/install/directory/lib/libgfortran.so (32-bit x86)
SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB=/path/to/gcc/install/directory/lib/amd64/libgfortran.so (64-bit x64)
```

William, you said on sage-devel, on the subject of SAGE_FORTRAN and OS X. 

*Use the binary included in Sage if SAGE_FORTRAN is not specified. Otherwise, use the one pointed to by the that environment variable. *

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e2867ea2efe7e052

Therefore, SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB might be important if someone wanted to use their own version of gcc, rather than the one in Sage. In which case, the question arises as to what would be the path to the library. Would it be different for 32 and 64-bit builds, as it is on Solaris and HP-UX?

> I think it is important to add on platforms such as Solaris, AIX and HP-UX, where both 32 and 64-bit builds are supported, the library path **must** point to the 32-bit library if building 32-bit, and must point to a 64-bit library if building 64-bit. 


Done. Fixed in the updated README.txt.





> (How about OS X? Perhaps the fortran.spkg takes care of that.) 


Also fixed in the updated README.txt. For Mac OS X, I have removed the reference to ticket #7095, as the issue contained therein has been fixed.

README.txt was recently updated, so this will need to be rebased again.  Is the original problem still a problem, given the latest one?

With respect to drkirkby's comments, I think the following remain:
>  * Line 22: says Sage is distributed under the GPL, but does say what version. I believe it should be GPL 2 (or at your option any later version). 
 
This seems reasonable to change.
>  * **Lines 144 + 145. Again refers to a gFortran. Also, there is no reason gfortran needs to be installed system wide. Someone can create their own private copy of gcc with Fortran support.**
 
I have no idea if this is true, but at any rate we still use the phrase "system-wide" in line 137.
>  *  Line 299. I would change to simply Sage needs GCC >= 4.0.1
>  * Line 300 seems a bit pointless, as long as we say Sage needs gcc >=4.0.1
>  * Line 301 can be removed, as it is totally impossible to build Sage with that. The 'prereq' script will exit immediately with an error. 
 
These three seem to be a matter of taste.  As long as we accurately document what Sage builds with, we might as well leave it alone.  And warnings of things that fail are good if they prevent people from wasting time trying to make them fail :)

This has already been taken care of at least as of Sage 4.5.2.  I'm going to mark it as invalid now.
