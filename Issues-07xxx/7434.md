Please ignore V2.  I've just noticed that the patch doesn't work in Cr4, IE8, and S4 on Windows XP.  It seems the WebKit browsers use `applet`s instead of `object`s.  IE8 uses `object`s, but the `type` attribute is empty.

V3 fixes this with [jmolSetAppletCssClass](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/jslibrary/#jmolSetAppletCssClass) and `$('.jmol_applet')`.
