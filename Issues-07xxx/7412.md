Hi Yann ! 

Thanks for the report ! Are you working on it ? The fix is rather trivial and I'm not in the mood for racing with you to get the first patch :-)
 
By the way, thanks for putting me in CC, but it is better to put all the sage-combinat group for all these problem.

Cheers,

Florent

The patch is ok and ready to go but I don't see any dependence with #7011...
Maybe you meant #7411, but there is no problem with it. The two patches do commute.
