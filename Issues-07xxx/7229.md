With the update to the new sage notebook, the jsmath-image-fonts spkg now installs to the wrong directory.

```

> >  * Silently fall back to using image fonts if TeX fonts are not available


This is what was done in the sage notebook a few days ago.  William had 
installed the optional jsmath-image-fonts spkg a long time ago.  What 
probably happened is that no one rebased the jsmath-image-fonts to copy 
to the right javascript directory, and since these all moved around with 
the new notebook code, everything is broken with respect to this spkg now.

A solution is to modify the spkg to install to the right location, and 
install it again on sagenb.org.
```

Robert replies:

Installed 4.1.2. and the old spkg file with image fonts.
I got this error
I copied the image fonts from /opt/sage/local/notebook/javascript/
jsmath to /opt/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb/data/
javascript/jsmath and everything works fine.

How should we deal with #7196?  A special `JSMATH_HOME` variable?

Also: Should we add the [extra fonts](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/download/extra-fonts/welcome.html)?

Works fine on fresh install of Sage 4.1.2. 
However (as new) I give up the closing of this ticket to some more skilled Sage user/developer.
Thank you for the fix.
