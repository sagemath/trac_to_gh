# Issue 7512: fast_callable should respect the variable order in callable symbolic expressions (treating them like lambda functions rather than like expressions)

This is a somewhat subtle issue if the function is a pure python function (you'd need to analyze the argument names), but maybe a convention is that if variable names are specified, they must match up to argument names in the function, and then they are slotted into the function using a dictionary, so that no matter where in the variable range list the range for x appears, it always is sent to the function as f(x=value).

See http://sagenb.org/home/jason3/302/

I think that each of these should return the same plot:

```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: def f(x,y):
...      return x*sin(y)
...
sage: plot3d(f, (x,0,3),(y,-6,6),viewer='tachyon')
sage: plot3d(f, (y,-6,6),(x,0,3),viewer='tachyon')
sage: g(x,y)= x*sin(y)
sage: plot3d(g, (x,0,3),(y,-6,6),viewer='tachyon')
sage: plot3d(g, (y,-6,6),(x,0,3),viewer='tachyon')
```

I have two dumb questions.  Not putting "needs work" in case someone else decides on the review.

1. Aren't CallableSymbolicExpressions already Expressions?  How does this get into the else? 

```
    if isinstance(x, Expression):
        et = x
        vars = et._etb._vars
    else:
        from sage.symbolic.callable import is_CallableSymbolicExpression
        if is_CallableSymbolicExpression(x):
            vars=x.args()
```

2. Why did you decide again that 1 and 3 should be different from 2 and 4?  I'm just curious, since this seems VERY counter-intuitive to me, since we go to the trouble of having g(x=1,y=2)==g(y=2,x=1) for callable guys and not allowing other variable names in them (this came up in the PREP workshop from a user question).

I'm just curious, since this seems VERY counter-intuitive to me, since we go to the trouble of having g(x=1,y=2)==g(y=2,x=1) for callable guys and not allowing other variable names in them (this came up in the PREP workshop from a user question).




We do allow other variable names in callable expressions:

```
sage: f(x,y)=a*x+y
sage: f(1,2)
a + 2
sage: f(a=2)
2*x + y
```


I'm also looking at your other points...
