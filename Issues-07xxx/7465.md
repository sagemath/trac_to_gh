This is using 4.3.1rc1 on 10.6, 64-bit.

The problem is that local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/numpy/distutils/fcompiler/gnu.py adds a "-shared" flag when linking, even though OS X doesn't support it.

Mac OS X (Darwin) compilers do not support the "-shared" option. The class Sage_FCompiler_1 currently calls compilers on all platforms using the "-shared" option. So whenever this class is used on Mac, it fails. On my computer, this led to f2py failing. This is a five line patch (plus documentation) that changes the compiler options on Mac to be in line with those already used in Sage_FCompiler, while leaving the compiler options on other platforms such as Solaris unchanged. If you'd like to check it on Solaris, then go ahead, but the patch was intentionally written to avoid changing behaviour on platforms other than OS X.

This breaks "on some mac systems" - f2py is broken on my 64-bit sage, but seems to be working on 32-bit mac systems without this patch. My guess is that 32-bit macs use Sage_FCompiler rather than Sage_FCompiler_1. Anyone who is familiar with the numpy spkg, please confirm or correct me!
