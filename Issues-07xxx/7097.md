Using 4.1.2.rc0.

Define a number field K with the irreducible polynomial g of degree 24, and another polynomial f:

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ)
sage: f = 8*x^9 + 42*x^6 + 6*x^3 - 1
sage: g = x^24 - 12*x^23 + 72*x^22 - 286*x^21 + 849*x^20 - 2022*x^19 + 4034*x^18 - 6894*x^17 + 10182*x^16 - 13048*x^15 + 14532*x^14 - 13974*x^13 + 11365*x^12 - 7578*x^11 + 4038*x^10 - 1766*x^9 + 762*x^8 - 408*x^7 + 236*x^6 - 126*x^5 + 69*x^4 - 38*x^3 + 18*x^2 - 6*x + 1
sage: assert g.is_irreducible()
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(g)
```

f has a root in K:

```
sage: x0 = 3260097/3158212*a^22 - 35861067/3158212*a^21 + 197810817/3158212*a^20 - 722970825/3158212*a^19 + 1980508347/3158212*a^18 - 4374189477/3158212*a^17 + 4059860553/1579106*a^16 - 6442403031/1579106*a^15 + 17542341771/3158212*a^14 - 20537782665/3158212*a^13 + 20658463789/3158212*a^12 - 17502836649/3158212*a^11 + 11908953451/3158212*a^10 - 6086953981/3158212*a^9 + 559822335/789553*a^8 - 194545353/789553*a^7 + 505969453/3158212*a^6 - 338959407/3158212*a^5 + 155204647/3158212*a^4 - 79628015/3158212*a^3 + 57339525/3158212*a^2 - 26692783/3158212*a + 1636338/789553
sage: f(x0)
0
```
(in fact f splits over K) but the root-finder does not find any:

```
sage: f.roots(K)
[]
```
What is worse, even though f factors over QQ:

```
sage: f.factor()
(8) * (x^3 + 1/4) * (x^6 + 5*x^3 - 1/2)
```
it apparently does not over K!

```
sage: f.change_ring(K).factor()
(64) * (x^9 + 21/4*x^6 + 3/4*x^3 - 1/8)
```

Remark: f is the 4-division polynomial of the elliptic curve [0,0,1,0,0] and K is the 4-division field.

Since Sage uses pari's nffactor() for factoring polynomials over number fields, I tried the same example in pari (gp version 2.4.3 (development svn-11651) to be precise).  there, it found one linear factor but failed to factor the other degree 8 part.  This suggests that we'll have to wait for bug fixes in pari before this can be closed.

*Why* are you sure that this is what PARI already does?  

The relevant paper is: http://www.math.fsu.edu/~hoeij/papers/factor_Oct12_2004.dvi

Note that this paper contains statements like: "Then one has a polynomial time 
algorithm that runs very well in practice, with running times that should be 
the same as those reported in [Bel03] for QQ[X]."   Such a statement would 
perhaps be silly if one just reduces to the QQ case by taking norms.  

I'm not 100% sure of anything though since I haven't read the relevant pari
source code yet.

The logic used to handle non-monic polynomials in nffactor() was flawed,
leading to "increasing" leading coefficients that eventually became too
large compared to our a priori factor bound. Thus factors were missed.

Neither factornf(), nor nfroots() are affected.

Fixed in svn. The fix is non trivial and quite extensive, I won't be
able to backport it to pari-stable in a safe way. pari-stable user will
have to rely on factornf() to handle non-monic polynomials for a few
more months.

Cheers,

   K.B.
```

Since it will be a while until this bugfix in pari percolates through to Sage, I suggest that the code in Sage does a change of variables so that the polynomial passed to pari's `nffactor()` is always monic.

factornf() always uses Trager's trick, reducing to factorization over Z.

nffactor() may also use that trick, but only when it would improve the
running times; and it should be (much) more efficient when the trick is
not used.

The only reason why factornf() hasn't been obsoleted yet is that
nffactor() used to require a 'nf' structure as input; but this is no
longer the case.

For users of the svn version, where the bug you reported is now fixed,
there is no point whatsoever in using factornf.

Cheers,

   K.B.

The patch seems to fix the problem by rescaling the polynomial so that it is monic (and rescaling the factors found later).

I am somewhat confused since the code already made polynomials monic (by dividing by the leading coefficient).  Instead, I replace f(x) by u**(d-1)*f(x/u) where u is the leading coefficient and d the degree, which preserves integrality, and that seems to work better.

We should still use factornf instead, once we upgrade the pari library to a version in which the upstream bug has been fixed.
