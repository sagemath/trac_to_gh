The dimension is currently computed to be too big in some cases when k is odd. E.g., this B below should be reported to have dimension 2, not 3:

```
sage: ModularSymbols(Gamma1(4),7).boundary_map().codomain().dimension()
3   # bad
```

See also #6072, which deals with a similar problem for GammaH spaces. 

Here's the email discussion of this:

The B_k in Merel's paper has dimension 2.   Merel does not state that dim(B_k) is the number of cusps in general.  That's only true when the weight is even. 

Sage does have a very small bug, which is that it computes the correct space B_k but embeds it (trivially) in a bigger space.  There is no need to do this, and I can see how it could be confusing.    The correct relations are used, the correct map is computed, it's just that there are extra 0's tacked on.   For example, in your example we have the following matrix for the boundary map:

[-1  0  0]
[ 0 -1  0]
[ 0 -1  0]
[ 0 -1  0]
[ 0  0  0]
[ 0  1  0]

notice that the extra dimension -- the 0 in the last column -- isn't involved.

The fix for this bug is to remove all the cusp classes that are equivalent to 0 because of the relation
    [Gamma(lambda u; lambda v)] ~ sign(lambda)^k[Gamma (u;v)]

For example, in your example that would be the class (u;v) = (1;2). 

>> I assume that 4 and 6 are correct, as a comparison with the usual
>> dimension tables for modular forms suggest.

Yes.

>> What is even more confusing is that Merel states that the isomorphism
>> between the boundary space and the space B_k(Gamma) is an
>> _isomorphism_, whereas in the SAGE sourcecode and in William Stein's
>> book it is only stated that it's injective.

Injectivity is all that is needed for the algorithm.

This has some substantial overlap with #6072, where I reported the same problem for GammaH groups. (This problem comes up much more often in the GammaH case than Gamma1, since Gamma1(N) has no irregular cusps unless N = 4.)
