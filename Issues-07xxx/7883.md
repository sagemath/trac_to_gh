Added some functionality to ideals (is_maximal works more often now, and there's a new ideal class for univariate polynomial rings).  Changed the logic on what class is chosen for ideals so that it's easier to override with _ideal_class_. Number of generators? 

Prerequisite for #8333, #8334, #8335, #9887.

There's a lot of useful looking code in here, but it's unclear what exactly it does or it's intended to fix. Some more explanations would be nice, and the new behavior should be doctested. Especially for most of the changes in `sage/rings/ideal.py`

What is the parameter in `_ideal_class_` supposed to mean? (Then why is it 0 by default?) 

Depends on #7881?

Attachment [trac_7883-ideals-folded.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7883/trac_7883-ideals-folded.patch) by @loefflerd created at 2010-09-23 15:36:30

I've uploaded a patch above which consists of 
- the two patches mentioned in roed's previous comment 
- the hunk from `7585_12_1_fixes.2.patch` (at #8334) that concerns `sage/rings/ring.pyx`
- a tiny fix to remove the code in `ideal_1poly_field` that calls `residue_field`, since the residue fields code isn't going in until a subsequent patch.

I have checked that this applies cleanly to 4.6.alpha1 and passes long doctests.
