On occasion, it's useful to get the installed SageNB version from inside a Sage process.  Here's a possible API:

```python
sage: import sagenb.version
sage: sagenb.version.version
0.4.3
sage: sagenb.version.date
'2009-11-12 11:56:53'
```
This is similar to `sage.version`.

Reminder: If this merges, update #7390's test report generator, which has a notebook version field.
