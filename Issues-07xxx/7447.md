On occasion, it's useful to get the installed SageNB version from inside a Sage process.  Here's a possible API:

```python
sage: import sagenb.version
sage: sagenb.version.version
0.4.3
sage: sagenb.version.date
'2009-11-12 11:56:53'
```
This is similar to `sage.version`.

Reminder: If this merges, update #7390's test report generator, which has a notebook version field.

V2 follows (and depends on) the simpler, `setuptools`-based approach of #7467.  The [attachment:trac_7447-sagenb_version_v2.patch new patch] also adds the Sage Notebook version to HTML test reports.

For what it's worth, the local queue is

```

trac_7390-sagenb_test_report_B_v2.patch
trac_7390-sagenb_test_report_referee.patch
trac_7402-pkg_resources.patch
trac_7428-publish_last_edited_v2.patch

trac_7447-sagenb_version_v2.patch
trac_4714-sagenb_jsmath_init.patch
trac_6855-published_interacts.patch
```
But please let me know if I should rebase any patch(es).
