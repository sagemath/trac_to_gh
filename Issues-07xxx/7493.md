When a test file takes time to execute, it would be handy to have a quick overview of which specific tests take long. 

Something like:

```
    sage -t --verbose --time bla.py
    Trying: 
        1+1
    Expecting:
        2
    ok [0.1ms]
    Trying: 
        factor(....)
    Expecting:
        ...
    ok [10s] warning: please use # long time
    Trying: 
        factor(.....) # long time
    Expecting:
        ...
    ok [10s]
    Trying: 
        factor(........)
    Expecting:
        ...
    ok [300s] warning: this is too long!
```

And in non verbose mode:

```
    sage -t --time bla.py
    Warning: factor(....) line 30 takes 10s: please use # long time
    Warning: factor(........) line 50 takes 300s: this is too long!
```

Here is a patch which sorts of do the job. It is not intended to be merged, but to make you crave enough for the feature to actually implement it right:

```
zephyr-~s/categories>sage -t -time coxeter_groups.py    
sage -t -time "4.3/devel/sage-combinat/sage/categories/coxeter_groups.py"
...
File "/opt/sage-4.3/devel/sage-combinat/sage/categories/coxeter_groups.py", line 1010:
    sage: for u in P4:
          for v in P4:
              assert u.bruhat_lequal(v) == P4toW(u).bruhat_le(P4toW(v))
Expected nothing
Got:
    Warning: test took 8.1s > 1s. Please use # long time
Total time for all tests: 24.0 seconds
```

Nicolas, can you actually attach your toy patch to this ticket?  I've now been in a few situations where I'm staring at the output of sage -t -verbose, and having *anything* automated for this would be a great help to my sanity.
