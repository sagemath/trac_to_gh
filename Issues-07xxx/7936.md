From an email `[sage-support] error in documentation "Construction"` on 2010-01-15:

```
Hi everyone,

I just checked out one of  first page in the "Constructions" page:

http://www.sagemath.org.nyud.net/doc/constructions/calculus.html

Just after the first example "Differentiation"

sage: var('x k w')
(x, k, w)
sage: f = x^3 * e^(k*x) * sin(w*x); f
x^3*e^(k*x)*sin(w*x)
sage: f.diff(x)
k*x^3*e^(k*x)*sin(w*x) + w*x^3*e^(k*x)*cos(w*x) + 3*x^2*e^(k*x)*sin
(w*x)
sage: latex(f.diff(x))
k x^{3} e^{\left(k x\right)} \sin\left(w x\right) + w x^{3} e^{\left(k
x\right)} \cos\left(w x\right) + 3 \, x^{2} e^{\left(k x\right)} \sin
\left(w x\right)

there is

"If you type view(f.diff('x')) another... "

When I do that, I get a long error message, which could frighten off
(it is the first example...). With "view(f.diff(x))" it works.
However, if the function is defined via

f = maxima(....)

then both ways work:   view(f.diff('x')),  view(f.diff(x))

I don't know if this is intended, but at least on the website it
should be changed, not to get the error.

Greets,
Stefan
```

It would be really nice if that whole constructions page could be written without any explicit calls to maxima at all--not sure how much of that is possible, but for derivatives, integrals, and power series it certainly is. 

Also, nearly every example involves Piecewise, which doesn't play nicely with all the symbolic stuff (nor does it make for concise examples).

Two years?   It from at least *four* years ago!  It was mostly written around the time of Sage 1.0, or earlier.  It needs a total rewrite.  When it was written, explicit calls to maxima were the only way to do any calculus.

Thanks for explaining that about the second patch.

desolvers.sage can be removed now since Robert Marik has kindly implemented everything in it in sage already.

Can you just delete the file, Minh?

I just want to point out also that William is probably going to get rid of the examples directory in the near future - as usual, I do not have the URL for that discussion :) so the sooner we explicitly know it's not necessary, the better.

I think so.   Someone should check the interact wiki and make sure that the essence of the Newton-Raphson example is captured in the interacts already there which are about that.  Recall that this needs review, though, so you (or someone) would need to formally give this positive review at least.
