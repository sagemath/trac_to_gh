From an email `[sage-support] error in documentation "Construction"` on 2010-01-15:

```
Hi everyone,

I just checked out one of  first page in the "Constructions" page:

http://www.sagemath.org.nyud.net/doc/constructions/calculus.html

Just after the first example "Differentiation"

sage: var('x k w')
(x, k, w)
sage: f = x^3 * e^(k*x) * sin(w*x); f
x^3*e^(k*x)*sin(w*x)
sage: f.diff(x)
k*x^3*e^(k*x)*sin(w*x) + w*x^3*e^(k*x)*cos(w*x) + 3*x^2*e^(k*x)*sin
(w*x)
sage: latex(f.diff(x))
k x^{3} e^{\left(k x\right)} \sin\left(w x\right) + w x^{3} e^{\left(k
x\right)} \cos\left(w x\right) + 3 \, x^{2} e^{\left(k x\right)} \sin
\left(w x\right)

there is

"If you type view(f.diff('x')) another... "

When I do that, I get a long error message, which could frighten off
(it is the first example...). With "view(f.diff(x))" it works.
However, if the function is defined via

f = maxima(....)

then both ways work:   view(f.diff('x')),  view(f.diff(x))

I don't know if this is intended, but at least on the website it
should be changed, not to get the error.

Greets,
Stefan
```

It would be really nice if that whole constructions page could be written without any explicit calls to maxima at all--not sure how much of that is possible, but for derivatives, integrals, and power series it certainly is. 

Also, nearly every example involves Piecewise, which doesn't play nicely with all the symbolic stuff (nor does it make for concise examples).

Two years?   It from at least *four* years ago!  It was mostly written around the time of Sage 1.0, or earlier.  It needs a total rewrite.  When it was written, explicit calls to maxima were the only way to do any calculus.

No, unfortunately, I don't think so.

I give a positive review to the first patch. I don't understand the second patch. I'm giving the first a positive review though. Fell free to reverse my vote back to needs review, but I'm marking it for now as needs info. The instructions for patch 2 are just completely unclear to me.

Thanks for explaining that about the second patch.

desolvers.sage can be removed now since Robert Marik has kindly implemented everything in it in sage already.

Can you just delete the file, Minh?

I just want to point out also that William is probably going to get rid of the examples directory in the near future - as usual, I do not have the URL for that discussion :) so the sooner we explicitly know it's not necessary, the better.

This patch does not apply to 4.4.2.a0 for me. Does anyone else have this problem?

I'll use ... to indicate the rest of the path until the Sage folder.

```
cd .../sage-4.4.1/examples/
~/.../sage-4.4.1/sage -hg log | less  # gives you the log, which is very boring :)
~/.../sage-4.4.1/sage -hg import https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7936/trac_7936-no-calc-examples.patch.gz
~/.../sage-4.4.1/sage -hg log | less  # gives you the log, which should now indicate the patch was applied.
```
And if you go in ./sage/examples/calculus/ now, it should be empty.  The release manager would have to remove the empty folder by hand, I think.

I agree that it is very annoying that one has to do this without hg_sage - it took me a long time to figure out how to do it - but eventually the examples directory will cease to exist and so that won't be a problem.  This is just a first step.

Thanks very much! 

This applies fine to 4.4.2.a0 and sage -testall passes (except for unrelated failures in interfaces/r.py and misc/sagedoc.py).
