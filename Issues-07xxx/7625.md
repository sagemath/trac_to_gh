This looks good to me, apart from the comedy of errors that is the notebook settings page.  Also, 14 out of 15 Selenium tests still pass (cf. #7455).

I think Dr. Palmieri reviewed #7470.

Positive review, pending Tim's confirmation?

Replying to [@TimDumol](#comment%3A10):
> Correct me if I'm mistaken, but is #7467 actually included? I cannot find it in the merge log.

Oh crap, you're right.  I don't know how I made that mistake.  Here's a sagenb-0.4.7 that includes that and one other patch I merged:

  http://wstein.org/home/wstein/patches/sagenb/sagenb-0.4.7.spkg

```
SAGENB-0.4.7
#7467: Tim Dumol: Make SageNB use `setuptools` instead of `distutils` [Reviewed by Mitesh Patel]
#7628: Mitesh Patel: Error on account creation still creates (half of) an account [Reviewed by William Stein]
