From the report a bug link:

It seems that the zorder does not work with disk(). I found a report saying that this was resolved for point() and polygon(), (and I know it works) but nothing about disk(). I found this using the following test:

```
d1 = disk((0,0), 1, (0, 2*pi), color = 'red', zorder=0) 
d2 = disk((0,0), 0.75, (0, 2*pi), color = 'brown', zorder=1)
d3 = disk((0,0), 0.5, (0, 2*pi), color = 'green', zorder= 2)
d4 = disk((0,0), 0.25, (0, 2*pi), color = 'yellow', zorder=3)
final = d4 + d3 + d2 + d1
final.show(aspect_ratio = 1)
```

Incidentally (not in the report), this shows that axes apparently have default zorder of 2.  So do arrows, but polygons have a default of 1.  This is confusing.

The patch fixes the zorder problem (the code below produces 3 colorful bullseyes).

```
sage: d1 = disk((0,0), 1, (0, 2*pi), color = 'red', zorder=0) 
sage: d2 = disk((0,0), 0.75, (0, 2*pi), color = 'brown', zorder=1)
sage: d3 = disk((0,0), 0.5, (0, 2*pi), color = 'green', zorder= 2)
sage: d4 = disk((0,0), 0.25, (0, 2*pi), color = 'yellow', zorder=3)
sage: final = d4 + d3 + d2 + d1
sage: final.show(aspect_ratio = 1) 
sage: final2 = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4                                   
sage: final2.show(aspect_ratio = 1)                                
sage: final3 = d3 + d2 + d4 + d1   
sage: final3.show(aspect_ratio = 1)
```
(Note: Intuitively, final, final2 and final3 should all produce the same image and they do)
