I think there are a few problems with the patch set:

* [Expected] doctest failures in `cell.py`.
* Adding a new text cell at the end of a worksheet does not update the `cell_id_list`.
* In Firebug's console, there are two errors:
  * `get_cell(id) is null` in `resize_all_cells()` for text cells.
  * `cell_prev is null` in `join_cell()` when the top cell is a text cell.

I'm working on part 3.

Also:  Evaluating all cells, deleting all output, slide mode.

A potential annoyance:  Reopening (or editing) a worksheet fuses consecutive text cells.
Should we have "special" delimiters for text cells?

This has been the case since there first were text cells.  Some people consider it good (a feature), and others find it confusing.
