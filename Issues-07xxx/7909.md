sage-spkg has $MKDIR in one place, which will cause problems with an updated 'sage-env' which no longer defines MKDIR. 

I'm attaching a copy of the revised sage-spkg, and also a Mercurial patch.

Don't know whether the name 'sage-spkg' is any good. Did you mean to attach the new sage-env?

The patch is simple and looks good.
