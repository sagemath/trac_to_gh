`from `__future__` import *` statements must be the first statements in a file. However, the old Sage Notebook inserts synchronization code before the file, and the new SageNB inserts prompt changing code first. Both of the aforementioned changes break the code.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

Needs work, since this has a subtle bug, which I bet you can easily fix.  See below.

Using regular expressions is unfortunately not rock solid.  For example, this input "mysteriously" gives a SyntaxError:

```
print """
from __future__ import division"""
```
outputs:

```
Syntax Error:
    from __future__ import division"""
```
whereas the similar

```
print """
from __xfuture__ import division"""
```
works fine.  

I think the right fix is to require that the even in the notebook the <code>from \`__future__\` import ...</code> lines appear at the very top.  This would make it possible to use the same method you already used.
