`from `__future__` import *` statements must be the first statements in a file. However, the old Sage Notebook inserts synchronization code before the file, and the new SageNB inserts prompt changing code first. Both of the aforementioned changes break the code.

Needs work, since this has a subtle bug, which I bet you can easily fix.  See below.

Using regular expressions is unfortunately not rock solid.  For example, this input "mysteriously" gives a SyntaxError:

```
print """
from __future__ import division"""
```
outputs:

```
Syntax Error:
    from __future__ import division"""
```
whereas the similar

```
print """
from __xfuture__ import division"""
```
works fine.  

I think the right fix is to require that the even in the notebook the <code>from \`__future__\` import ...</code> lines appear at the very top.  This would make it possible to use the same method you already used.
