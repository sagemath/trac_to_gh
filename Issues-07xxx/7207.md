Needs work, since this has a subtle bug, which I bet you can easily fix.  See below.

Using regular expressions is unfortunately not rock solid.  For example, this input "mysteriously" gives a SyntaxError:

```
print """
from __future__ import division"""
```
outputs:

```
Syntax Error:
    from __future__ import division"""
```
whereas the similar

```
print """
from __xfuture__ import division"""
```
works fine.  

I think the right fix is to require that the even in the notebook the `from __future__ import ...` lines appear at the very top.  This would make it possible to use the same method you already used.
