This patch adds these tests.  It still depends on the (newest) patch at #3401, and in fact gets rid of one final thing which was only needed by the previous implementation of Li.

This needs more work. See my comments about the prec parameter at [#3401 comment:10](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/3401#comment:10).

Two different functions whose names differ only in capitalization (`li` and `Li`) is also very confusing. We need to come up with a better name for this.
