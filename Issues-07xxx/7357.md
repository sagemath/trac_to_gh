This needs more work. See my comments about the prec parameter at [#3401 comment:10](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/3401#comment:10).

Two different functions whose names differ only in capitalization (`li` and `Li`) is also very confusing. We need to come up with a better name for this.

The function added in #11143 is really a class called ``Function_exp_integral_li`` and it has an alias ``exp_integral_li`` to match the other exponential integrals. #11143 also moves all the exponential integrals to a new module under sage/functions so this would conflict with that design decision too.
