This patch adds these tests.  It still depends on the (newest) patch at #3401, and in fact gets rid of one final thing which was only needed by the previous implementation of Li.

This needs more work. See my comments about the prec parameter at[comment:10](#comment%3A10):ticket:3401.

Two different functions whose names differ only in capitalization (`li` and `Li`) is also very confusing. We need to come up with a better name for this.

The function added in #11143 is really a class called ``Function_exp_integral_li`` and it has an alias ``exp_integral_li`` to match the other exponential integrals. #11143 also moves all the exponential integrals to a new module under sage/functions so this would conflict with that design decision too.
