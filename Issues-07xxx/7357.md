This patch adds these tests.  It still depends on the (newest) patch at #3401, and in fact gets rid of one final thing which was only needed by the previous implementation of Li.

This needs more work. See my comments about the prec parameter at [comment:10](#comment%3A10):ticket:3401.

Two different functions whose names differ only in capitalization (`li` and `Li`) is also very confusing. We need to come up with a better name for this.

This seems to be addressed in the context of a much bigger overhaul by #11143.  But there the name is... more complicated.
