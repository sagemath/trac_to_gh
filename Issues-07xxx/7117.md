From IRC:

```
By the way, if I evaluate "jsmath(RIF)" in the notebook, jsMath complains: "Unknown control sequence '\I'". 
Is there a missing macro definition?
```
It looks to me as though the `_latex_` method for RIF has been defined in terms of '\\I' for a long time, and it has not worked since at least Sage 3.4.  The attached patch changes it from "\\I \\R" to "\\Bold{I} \\Bold{R}".

I had to do a minor rebasing and attached the new patch.
