I am getting this in 4.1.1 and find it really frustrating (especially since it took me several hours to catch):


```
sage: QQ["x", "y"].inject_variables()
Defining x, y
sage: e1 = x^2*y^3 - x^2*y - x*y
sage: e2 = e1.parent().fraction_field()(e1)
sage: print e2
x^2*y^3 - x^2*y - x*y
sage: print e2.subs(y=SR("s"))
x^2*s^3 - (x^2 - x)*s
```
The last line is wrong!

But in 4.1.2.rc0:

```
sage: QQ["x", "y"].inject_variables()
Defining x, y
sage: e1 = x^2*y^3 - x^2*y - x*y
sage: e2 = e1.parent().fraction_field()(e1)
sage: print e2
x^2*y^3 - x^2*y - x*y
sage: print e2.subs(y=SR("s"))
s^3*x^2 - s*x^2 - s*x
```
So the problem may already have been solved.
