Thank you for your help !!! just one question though : on which version of GLPK is your patch based ? The new version of GLPK is available in #7268 and still waiting for review... Could we merge your changes in ? :-)

I had no idea that "id" was a python keyword... And thank you for noticing this memory leak !
