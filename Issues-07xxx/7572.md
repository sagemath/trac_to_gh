Thank you for your help !!! just one question though : on which version of GLPK is your patch based ? The new version of GLPK is available in #7268 and still waiting for review... Could we merge your changes in ? :-)

I had no idea that "id" was a python keyword... And thank you for noticing this memory leak !

Me neither, but Emacs noticed it :) I think there's still a memleak there, you `new glp_ioct` but never `delete` it. However, I couldn't find anything on `glp_ioct` anywhere.
