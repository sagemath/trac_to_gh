This would increase our potential user base, though, as well as make it possible for people to use Sage in virtually any college course very easily (with the exception of most geometry courses, but a Geogebra plugin would do that).

Examples follow; one can certainly come up with one's own examples, this just shows what isn't supported and the current error messages.

```
sage: r.library('MASS')
sage: r.library('lattice')
sage: r.bwplot('MPG.highway ~ Origin', data = 'Cars93')

Warning message:
In grid.newpage() : No png support in this version of R

sage: r.histogram('~ MPG.highway',data='Cars93')

Okay, I have dug into this, and here are some preliminary thoughts.

We have a function r.png, which only works if capabilities('png') returns TRUE.  In the default build on Mac, we get

```
> capabilities()
    jpeg      png     tiff    tcltk      X11     aqua http/ftp  sockets 
   FALSE    FALSE    FALSE     TRUE    FALSE    FALSE     TRUE     TRUE 
  libxml     fifo   cledit    iconv      NLS  profmem    cairo 
    TRUE     TRUE     TRUE     TRUE     TRUE    FALSE    FALSE 
```
However, to build with X11 (which would enable png and friends) or with aqua on Mac (which would enable the quartz graphics device), we need to build with certain options.  See [http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html](http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html) and [http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Configuration-options](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Configuration-options) for some info. 

On sagenb.org, however, we do have png and Cairo TRUE, though X11 FALSE.  The commands that give various errors on my computer in the description instead give the actual data set (!) on sagenb, except the last one which still returns NULL.  However, the following DOES work (from the documentation in interfaces/r.py):

```
r.png('temp.png')
x = r([1,2,3])
y = r([4,5,6])
r.plot(x,y)
r.dev_off()
```
So it seems that one can do this, but it's annoying.  Similarly:

```
r.png('temp2.png')
r.plot('MPG.highway ~ Weight', data='Cars93')
r.dev_off()
```
works on sagenb.  It's very nice, in fact!

So presumably if we enabled X11 on Mac (perhaps on a case-by-case basis for each version of OSX as in the above websites) we would get this at least, and perhaps also enabling aqua would solve this on Mac.  To be continued...

Okay, here is something that should work and doesn't now - probably because of the new cell structure, though perhaps it already didn't work before, or maybe it's the fault of the r.png() setting its own path?  Try the following in the notebook (evaluated in Sage):

```
r.library('lattice')
r.png()
r("print(histogram(~wt | cyl, data=mtcars))")
r.dev_off()
```
Notice that below and to the right of the graphic there is a link for the graphic - but there is no actual graphic at that link, because it's a link to the /tmp directory (the actual evaluation directory), and the file doesn't actually exist there:

```
Crismans-Computer:~ crisman$ ls -al .sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/admin/0/cells/2/
total 40
drwx------   4 crisman  crisman    136 Apr 19 20:20 .

lrwxr-xr-x   1 crisman  crisman     33 Apr 19 20:20 .Rplot001.png-wZKi -> /tmp/tmp_0wLLV/.Rplot001.png-wZKi

lrwxr-xr-x    1 crisman  wheel   59 Apr 19 20:20 data -> /Users/crisman/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/admin/0/data
```
Any clue as to how to fix that?  I don't understand this at all.  I don't know that this should hold things up, though, particularly since one can either drag and drop the picture or just do it from the command line if one wants it.

Otherwise this is all coming together nicely, also works on PPC, so I think sufficiently robust at this point.  Here is some resolution of the original examples in command line.

```
sage: r.library('MASS')
sage: r.library('lattice')
sage: r.bwplot('MPG.highway ~ Origin', data = 'Cars93')
sage: r.dev_off() # Now it should be in the home directory name Rplot001.png or something
sage: r.histogram('~ MPG.highway',data='Cars93')
sage: r.dev_off() # Now it should be in the home directory name Rplot002.png or something
sage: r.plot('MPG.highway ~ Weight', data='Cars93') # Calls dev.off(), so should be in home directory immediately
```
Great!  Putting 'needs review', though presumably we'll have to do a few more things to tie up loose ends.

To release manager: This depends on the sagenb 0.8 package, and requires the spkg [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/r-2.10.1.p1.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/r-2.10.1.p1.spkg), the Sage library patch trac_7665-r-plotting.patch, and the two reviewer patches from was (one for the Sage library, one for sagenb which will presumably have to be part of sagenb 0.8.1).  At least I think that's right.
