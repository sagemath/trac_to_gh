Positive review.  By the way,

```
sage: a = RIF(3.9999999999999999999999999999999999,5.000000000000000000000000000000000)
sage: b = RIF(4.000000000000000000000000000000000,4.9999999999999999999999999999999999)
sage: a.is_int()
(False, None)
sage: b.is_int()
(False, None)
```
though I don't know if that's a bug (except in user input), since

```
sage: a.str(style='brackets')
'[3.9999999999999995 .. 5.0000000000000000]'
sage: b.str(style='brackets')
'[4.0000000000000000 .. 5.0000000000000000]'
```
but anyway wanted to point it out in case this is considered something that should be documented in is_int(), not just in RIF().
