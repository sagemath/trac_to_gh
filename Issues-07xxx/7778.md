Post-#7467, the SageNB install path depends on its version, but `jsmath-image-fonts-1.4.p2.spkg` expects a slightly different format.

This ticket just updates `spkg-install`.

See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/82304cb7adbb22f9), [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/10b3e588e9110322).

There's a trial package at

I've CC'd Dr. Kirkby, because I see

```sh
$ checkbashisms -x -f spkg-install
possible bashism in spkg-install line 36 (bash arrays, ${name[0|*|@]}):
for DIR in ${CANDIDATES[@]}; do
possible bashism in spkg-install line 44 (bash arrays, ${name[0|*|@]}):
    echo "${CANDIDATES[*]}"
```
I don't know if these are problems on Solaris or, if they are, how to work around them.

Hi,

I upgraded sagenb.org to use sagenb-0.5.  I then tried to install this spkg.  It definitely got confused and didn't work, for some reason (maybe because of an old sagenb from before).   I eventually *manually* copied the fonts to:

/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python/site-packages/sagenb/data/jsmath/fonts

where sagenb is a symlink to sagenb-0.5-*egg/sagenb, and this did work. 

Notice that:

```
root@boxen:/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python/site-packages/sagenb/data/jsmath/fonts# python
Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Jul 22 2009, 15:33:10) 
[GCC 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu3)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import os
>>> from pkg_resources import Requirement, working_set
>>> sagenb_path = working_set.find(Requirement.parse('sagenb')).location
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'location'
```

I'm really just recording this for posterity in case there really is something wrong.  I don't have time to delve deeper now.

I would not be surprised, if it really is wrong.  The Python script embedded in `spkg-install` is run with `/usr/bin/env python`.  Maybe this doesn't always use Sage's `python`?
