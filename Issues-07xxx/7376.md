It would be really nice if the "Search" function in the upper left of the published worksheet listing also searched for the username (e.g., I could search for "jason3" and get all of my published worksheets).

Nice; this works as advertised.

I like all the discussion above about even more sophisticated searching systems, but of course they shouldn't hold up this ticket getting a... positive review!
