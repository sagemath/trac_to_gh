It would be really nice if the "Search" function in the upper left of the published worksheet listing also searched for the username (e.g., I could search for "jason3" and get all of my published worksheets).

But:

```python
sage: from sagenb.notebook.worksheet import split_search_string_into_keywords as ss
sage: ss('hello there')
['hello', 'there']
sage: ss(" foo bar  'modular form' hello there")
['modular form', "'", 'hello', 'there']

Should we add modifiers?  For example, the search phrase `"Fourier user:joe` would restrict the search to worksheets published by Joe.  Other possible modifiers: `title`, `text_cell`, `compute_cell`, `dates`, `input`, `output`, `collaborators`, `rating`.

Nice; this works as advertised.

I like all the discussion above about even more sophisticated searching systems, but of course they shouldn't hold up this ticket getting a... positive review!
