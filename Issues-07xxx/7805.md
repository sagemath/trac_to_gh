**Attachment:** [trac_7805.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7805/trac_7805.patch)

This seems to pass all tests on sage 4.3.5 on a 10.6.2 mac (the only failure was that of the fresh copy of 4.3.5). 

Like #8639, this seems like a very very minor change. As far as I can seen, positive review.
