`I.variety()` should first check whether the ideal I is indeed 0-dimensional and refuse to continue otherwise.  This should be a fairly trivial fix.  Right now the following seems to run forever:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.2, Release Date: 2009-10-24                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: R.<x, y, z> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([x^2-y^3*z, x+y*z])
sage: I.dimension()
1
sage: I.variety()
verbose 0 (1808: multi_polynomial_ideal.py, variety) Warning: falling back to very slow toy implementation.
