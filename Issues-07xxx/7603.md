Attached patch adds `_is_symbol()`, `_is_constant()` and `_is_numeric()` methods to `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression` objects.

These methods are just a thin wrapper around the `is_a<*>()` methods from pynac. They should provide a straightforward interface to query the internal representation of a symbolic expression when `.operator()` returns None.
