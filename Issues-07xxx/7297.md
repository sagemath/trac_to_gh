Seems like things compiled OK though.  This is on an intel mac, 10.5.

As far as I can tell, there is no attempt to actually build png2theora, its not a failure.  But I am not sure how to edit the makefile to force this build.

Is there the line

```
Build example code: ......... yes
```

at the end of configure?

Did it find libpng?

The option --enable-examples for configure should force the building of the examples.

I do see the "Build example code: ........... yes" string at the end of the configure output.

I don't see any indication of it looking for libpng, either a failure or success.

The only things that are being built inside of spkg/build/libtheora-1.1.1/src/examples are dump_video and dump_psnr.

OK, I tried copying the libogg spkg into the spkg/standard directory, but then the configure script fails with:

checking for Ogg... no
*** Could not run Ogg test program, checking why...

Whats the point of 

```
unset RM
```
in the spkg-install of libogg-1.1.4 ? 

I'd either remove the line, or add a comment why it is needed.
