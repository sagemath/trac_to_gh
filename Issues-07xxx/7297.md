As far as I can tell, there is no attempt to actually build png2theora, its not a failure.  But I am not sure how to edit the makefile to force this build.

Is there the line

Did it find libpng?

The option --enable-examples for configure should force the building of the examples.

I do see the "Build example code: ........... yes" string at the end of the configure output.

I don't see any indication of it looking for libpng, either a failure or success.

The only things that are being built inside of spkg/build/libtheora-1.1.1/src/examples are dump_video and dump_psnr.
