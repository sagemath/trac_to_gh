# Issue 7483: notebook: move preparsing to the worksheet process and out of the server (was: weird pointless line)

```
In worksheet.py (at the end of `start_next_comp(self)`) in sagenb we have these lines:

```
        self.__comp_is_running = True
        'exec `_support_`.preparse(base64.b64decode("%s"))'%base64.b64encode(input)
        self.sage().execute(input, os.path.abspath(self.data_directory()))
```

That 'exec ' line in the middle is just sitting there making a string that is just discarded?

The issue is that I thought I had fully implemented moving all preparsing to the worksheet process (out of the server).  Unfortunately, I didn't -- in fact, I only figured out how to do it, but didn't finish.

I think I meant

```
input = 'exec `_support_`.preparse(base64.b64decode("%s"))'%base64.b64encode(input)
```
and to get rid of preparsing input at all done by the server.  In fact, I know for a fact I implemented things that way so that this wouldn't be broken:

```
implicit_multiplication(True)
///
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: Implicit multiplication not implemented for the notebook.
```

But now it seems to be broken again. 

I can only conclude that a serious mismerge or mangling has occurred to the code I originally wrote, since I definitely had the above working in an earlier version of sagenb.  

Hence, this ticket.

So the attached patch moves all the preparsing from the notebook server to the worksheet process.   I had thought I had made this change long ago, but I definitely hadn't.  It's *extremely* important from a security/robustness/speed/flexibility point of view.  Why?  Because it means the possibly time consuming and definitely `_dangerous_` preparsing work gets pushed off to the worksheet processes, which will often be running on some remote virtual machines.  That's what we want!

This patch also makes it so the following are now fully supported in the notebook.  Note that they both used to not work at all:

* implicit_multiplication -- turning on and off implicit multiplication

* preparser -- turning on and off the preparser
