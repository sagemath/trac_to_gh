```
In worksheet.py (at the end of `start_next_comp(self)`) in sagenb we have these lines:

```
        self.__comp_is_running = True
        'exec _support_.preparse(base64.b64decode("%s"))'%base64.b64encode(input)
        self.sage().execute(input, os.path.abspath(self.data_directory()))
```

That 'exec ' line in the middle is just sitting there making a string that is just discarded?

The issue is that I thought I had fully implemented moving all preparsing to the worksheet process (out of the server).  Unfortunately, I didn't -- in fact, I only figured out how to do it, but didn't finish.

I think I meant

```
input = 'exec _support_.preparse(base64.b64decode("%s"))'%base64.b64encode(input)
```
and to get rid of preparsing input at all done by the server.  In fact, I know for a fact I implemented things that way so that this wouldn't be broken:

```
implicit_multiplication(True)
///
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: Implicit multiplication not implemented for the notebook.
```

But now it seems to be broken again. 

I can only conclude that a serious mismerge or mangling has occurred to the code I originally wrote, since I definitely had the above working in an earlier version of sagenb.  

Hence, this ticket.

It seems that `load` and `save` are now broken in the notebook.

Were `attach` and `detach` already broken in the notebook?
