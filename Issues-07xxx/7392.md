Right now, we rely on the horrible (for floating point) generic echelon implementation to calculate the rank of an RDF/CDF matrix.

In fact, over RR, it wouldn't hurt to call numpy/scipy either.



Component: **linear algebra**

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

here is an example and some thoughts:

```
sage: m=matrix(2,[1.5,1.75,1.5,1.75])
sage: m
[1.50000000000000 1.75000000000000]
[1.50000000000000 1.75000000000000]
sage: m.rank()
2
sage: 
```
This can be traced to   _echelon_in_place_classical in $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/matrix2.pyx, which attempts to compute
row-echelon form of this matrix (basically, Gaussian elimination), and fails due to a precision loss.
 
Numerics people recommend using the QR-decomposition, (i.e. into product of an orthogonal and an upper-triangular matrices q and r) followed by inspection of r. This is apparently more stable.
For instance:

```
sage: from scipy.linalg import qr
sage: q,r=qr(m)
sage: q
array([[-0.70710678,  0.70710678],
       [ 0.70710678,  0.70710678]])
sage: r
array([[ -2.12132034e+00,  -2.47487373e+00],
       [ -0.00000000e+00,   3.96275894e-16]])
```

One then has to decide how to round entries of r to 0.0.
This would take care of RDF and the like.

Interestingly, the computation of the charpoly is more robust, and can perhaps provide an alternative (just count the powers of x it is divisible by):

```
sage: m.charpoly()
x^2 - 3.25000000000000*x
sage: 
```

As a precursor to computing rank, I've written a short routine to get singular values and conveniently work with deciding the cutoff for zero values.  At #10802.  I'll get to this ticket 
next.

I think a QR decomposition can be less expensive to compute, but a bit less reliable.  And I've got good advice on how to make an automated decision on "zero" entries with the SVD.

That's very interesting.  Should we be submitting it upstream to scipy, where it would be used by a much wider audience than Sage?
