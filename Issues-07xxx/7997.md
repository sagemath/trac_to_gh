Hey, I think I'm gonna be pretty busy till I graduate this March, so if anyone wants to work on this patch, I'm posting an updated incomplete patch now. The new interface based on multiprocessing seems to work quite well, with a 300ms speed boost (really makes things seem lightning fast on local calculation of cheap stuff), but I haven't quite found out exactly how to get file saving to work properly.

I'd like to work on this patch.  At this point we're doing a lot more than just replacing the display hook hack - what should the scope of this patch be?

(Tom, correct me if I'm wrong) The patch currently:
1. Replaces the display hook hack with a much more robust implementation using python's [ast library](http://docs.python.org/library/ast.html).
2. Adds a new process implementation that passes a data object across
   * The old implementation passed a string to get exec-ed.  The string was "write this base64 encoded string to a file and exec it".
   * The new implementation gets the data object, writes the preparsed string to a file (just so exec will have line numbers), and exec's the string.  This is faster because it's only one exec.

There should be no noticeable change in output for clients, except for speed differences. Notably, the traceback output should remain properly.

By the way, it's Tim.

Hi,

I have managed to finish the local implementation of WorksheetProcess_PipesImplementation (WPPI), and I have found it to be roughly 251.3 ms faster than WorksheetProcess_ExpectImplementation (WPEI). The patch, however, makes WPEI and its remote equivalent useless, due to an API change on the WorksheetProcess interface. This means that to finish this patch, a remote implementation must be made, and that both be *very* thoroughly tested.

Here are the benchmark results, if anyone's interested:

```
sage: from sagenb.interfaces.pipes_interface import WorksheetProcess_PipesImpl as WPPI
sage: wp = WPPI()

# This is without the print_expressions, which is not equivalent to what WPEI does. Mean: 251.53 µs
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('print 1', preparse=False, print_expressions=False)\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
625 loops, best of 3: 488 µs per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('print 1', preparse=False, print_expressions=False)\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
625 loops, best of 3: 451 µs per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('print 1', preparse=False, print_expressions=False)\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
625 loops, best of 3: 424 µs per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('print 1', preparse=False, print_expressions=False)\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
625 loops, best of 3: 481 µs per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('print 1', preparse=False, print_expressions=False)\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
625 loops, best of 3: 479 µs per loop

sage: wp.execute('from sage.all_notebook import *; import sagenb', preparse=False, print_expressions=False)

# This, on the other hand, is. Mean: 680 µs
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('1', preparse=False)\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
625 loops, best of 3: 664 µs per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('1', preparse=False)\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
625 loops, best of 3: 734 µs per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('1', preparse=False)\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
5 loops, best of 3: 601 µs per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('1', preparse=False)\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
625 loops, best of 3: 739 µs per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('1', preparse=False)\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
625 loops, best of 3: 664 µs per loop

# Note, this has preparsing. This checks to see if the speedup scales. It does not.
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('[x for x in primes(1e4)]')\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
5 loops, best of 3: 21.5 ms per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('[x for x in primes(1e4)]')\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
25 loops, best of 3: 19.6 ms per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('[x for x in primes(1e4)]')\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
25 loops, best of 3: 19.5 ms per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('[x for x in primes(1e4)]')\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
25 loops, best of 3: 17.7 ms per loop
sage: timeit("""wp.execute('[x for x in primes(1e4)]')\nwhile wp.is_computing(): pass""")
25 loops, best of 3: 19.7 ms per loop
```

By contrast, here is the benchmark for WPEI:

```
sage: from sagenb.interfaces.expect import WorksheetProcess_ExpectImplementation as WPEI
sage: wp = WPEI()

Tom Boothby, I'm adding you to the CC since this also fixes the problem with the tracebacks you mentioned to me last January.

This version of the patch is hopefully the final version of the patch. It does the following:

* Uses ast to replace the displayhook_hack in `sagenb.misc.format`, this was achieved through the efforts of me and Alex Leone (thank you!).

  * The new version, now named `parse_display_expr`, can now print either the last expression, as before:

```
1
2
3
----
3
```

  or all root level expressions:

```
1
2
for x in range(3):
    x
3
-----
1
2
3
```

  or all expressions:

```
1
2
for x in range(2):
    x
3
-----
1
2
0
1
3
```

     This new functionality is customizable via the Notebook Settings page.

* Adds new WorksheetProcess implementations based on `multiprocessing`, and deprecates the pexpect based ones, since this also changes the WorksheetProcess API. The blocking reference implementation has been updated to the new API.

  * The local implementation (`WorksheetProcess_PipesImpl`) is on average 251.3 ms faster than the pexpect based one.

  * The remote implementation ('WorksheetProcess_RemoteSSHPipesImpl`) is on average 212 ms faster than the remote pexpect based one. For now, it has the same vulnerabilities as the old one, with one additional: the connection between the main server and the computing server is unencrypted, and thus may be snooped on. It is trivial to fix this, however I am not sure whether the speed (and extra computing load) tradeoffs are worth it.

* It now formats tracebacks as:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  Line 7, in <module>
    bar()
  Line 5, in bar
    foo()
  Line 2, in foo
    raise Exception("Hello")
Exception: Hello
```

instead of:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):    def baz():
  File "", line 1, in <module>
    
  File "/tmp/tmpfzcGzr/___code___.py", line 13, in <module>
    baz()
  File "", line 1, in <module>
    
  File "/tmp/tmpfzcGzr/___code___.py", line 10, in baz
    bar()
  File "/tmp/tmpfzcGzr/___code___.py", line 7, in bar
    foo()
  File "/tmp/tmpfzcGzr/___code___.py", line 4, in foo
    raise Exception("Hello")
Exception: Hello
```

which have their line numbers offset by +2, also.

ping about reviewing.  If the two of you wrote this together, what do you want from a third reviewer?  I don't have time to read and understand it all right now.  But I can install and test it.

I had a student complain the other day that Sage only did one thing at a time, so this patch would be appreciated!
