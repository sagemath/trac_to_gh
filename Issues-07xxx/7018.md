I understand the word "tree" may be the only way to get this result, the other words being less common or not mathematics-related... Even though :

```
sage: search_doc("tree")

html/en/installation/source.html:246:build tree to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/local</span></tt>.

Here is a patch.  This implements two new keywords for searching, one of which addresses the issue in this ticket.  These work for `search_src`, `search_doc`, and `search_def`.

- You can now do `search_doc('tree', whole_word=True)`, and it will look for 'tree' as a whole word, not returning matches for 'toctree' or 'trees'.

- You can now do `search_src('TreE', ignore_case=True)`, and it will return matches for 'TREE', 'Tree', 'tree', etc., completely ignoring case.  (By default, all searches continue to be case-sensitive, so `search_src('TreE')` returns no matches.)
