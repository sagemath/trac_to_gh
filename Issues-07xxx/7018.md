I understand the word "tree" may be the only way to get this result, the other words being less common or not mathematics-related... Even though :

```
sage: search_doc("tree")

html/en/installation/source.html:246:build tree to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/local</span></tt>.
