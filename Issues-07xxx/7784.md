I have been using the script at the following site to generate release notes for Sage:

http://bitbucket.org/mvngu/rnotes/

I think an option could be added to that script to generate release notes for sagenb. The current usage for the script is

```
./generate_release_notes sage-x.y.z
```
A possible option for generating sagenb specific release notes is

```
./generate_release_notes sage-x.y.z -sagenb
```
This would generate a release note for all sagenb specific tickets closed in the Sage x.y.z milestone. It's possible that during a particular milestone, more than one version of sagenb is released and integrated into Sage. Another possibility is 

```
./generate_release_notes sagenb-x.y.z
```
This would generate a release note for sagenb x.y.z.
