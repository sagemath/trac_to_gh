In sage-4.1.2, reset() causes problems by deleting 'sagenb' from the namespace; there may be other important things deleted as well.

A simple fix might be to add 'sagenb' to the sage.misc.reset.EXCLUDE list.  But perhaps a more extensive rewrite of this function would be better.

Keywords: **reset, notebook, sage-4.1.2**

Component: **notebook**
