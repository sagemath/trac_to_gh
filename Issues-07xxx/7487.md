This patch definesRandom Interval Graph, as explained in the docstring :

```
        An interval graph is built from a list `(a_i,b_i)_{1\leq i \leq n}`                                                                          
        of intervals : to each interval of the list is associated one                                                                                
        vertex, two vertices being adjacent if the two corresponding                                                                                 
        intervals intersect.                                                                                                                         
	                                                                                                                                             
        A random interval graph of order `n` is generated by picking                                                                                 
        random values for the `(a_i,b_j)`, each of the two coordinates

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
The patch looks mostly good to me with the exception of the changes I made.

Tuples already sort based on their first component (then second, etc.).  Also, I decreased the size of the example so that the chromatic number didn't take too long to compute.

Could you look at these changes?

Looks ok ! :-)

I should have thought of directly using sort instead of this lambda-function.. And I forgot that the default behaviour of sort on tuples was to use the lexicographic order, which is perfect in this case.... :-)

If you have some time for reviews ( as you merged an amazing amount of patches today ! ) could you take a look at #6680 or #6679 ? I'd understand if you could not, I know it would take much more time than for others, but these two patches are the real blockers in the graph section... 

Thanks !!! :-)
