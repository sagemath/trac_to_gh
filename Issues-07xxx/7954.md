Reported by Ronald van Luijk:

because the Curve constructor automatically interprets a homogeneous polynomial in 3 variables as a projective curve, the following doesn't work:

```
A.<x,y,z>=AffineSpace(QQ,3)
C=Curve([x-y,x-z])
```

Hi,

I made some important improvements to the patch while refereeing it.  However, it is clear after looking at this code for a bit that there is a *MAJOR* design flaw (which Willem pointed out to me in person).  The flaw is this in plane_curve/affine_curve.py:

```
class AffineSpaceCurve_generic(Curve_generic, AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_affine):
    def _repr_type(self):
        return "Affine Space"
```
However, Curve_generic is very much a *plane* curve:

```
class Curve_generic(AlgebraicScheme_subscheme):
...
    def defining_polynomial(self):
        return self.defining_polynomials()[0]
```

Thus the *isa* relationship that *must* be satisfied by derivation of objects is broken.

The space curve code must be completely moved out of this directory to the appropriate place.

The issue seems to have been solved now by adding `A`mbient space argument to the `Curve` constructor.

```
sage: A.<x,y,z>=AffineSpace(QQ,3)
sage: C = Curve([x-y,y-z],A)
sage: C
Affine Curve over Rational Field defined by x - y, y - z
```
