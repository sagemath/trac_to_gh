Reported by Ronald van Luijk:

because the Curve constructor automatically interprets a homogeneous polynomial in 3 variables as a projective curve, the following doesn't work:

```
A.<x,y,z>=AffineSpace(QQ,3)
C=Curve([x-y,x-z])
```

Hi,

I made some important improvements to the patch while refereeing it.  However, it is clear after looking at this code for a bit that there is a *MAJOR* design flaw (which Willem pointed out to me in person).  The flaw is this in plane_curve/affine_curve.py:

```
class AffineSpaceCurve_generic(Curve_generic, AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_affine):
    def _repr_type(self):
        return "Affine Space"
```
However, Curve_generic is very much a *plane* curve:

```
class Curve_generic(AlgebraicScheme_subscheme):
...
    def defining_polynomial(self):
        return self.defining_polynomials()[0]
```

Thus the *isa* relationship that *must* be satisfied by derivation of objects is broken.

The space curve code must be completely moved out of this directory to the appropriate place.
