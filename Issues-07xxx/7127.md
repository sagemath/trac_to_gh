```

A Google found this page on the gnupg-users mailing list. 

[gnupg compilation problems on Solaris 10 64 bit](http://www.mail-archive.com/gnupg-users@gnupg.org/msg09887.html) 

Someone suggested the person having the problem should use:


```
./configure with --disable-asm
```

That fixed the problem for him. 

So I changed the spkg-install so the assembly code was disabled on 64-bit Solaris. However, whilst the above problem did not display (I think the build got further this time), it did eventually fail with 

```
ld: fatal: file /export/home/drkirkby/sage/gcc64-sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/lib/libgpg-error.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32
```

It looks like some code is being built 32-bit, and other code 64-bit, which is the usual cause of this *wrong ELF class:* message.

Hence there remains a bug to be fixed here.

This can be closed as fixed. I'm not exactly sure when the last time any 32-bit code was produced when the environment variable `SAGE64` was set to "yes", but it is a long time ago. A 64-bit Solaris port seems not too far off now.
