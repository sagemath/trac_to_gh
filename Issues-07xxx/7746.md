This applies and tests fine (modulo the usual failures) on sage-4.3.rc0 on a mac running 10.6.2.

This is definitely a complete reimplementation (as stated in the docstring) of Hogan's module, since we actually did a hybrid of the HAC version and the Wikipedia version of the algorithm.

I am not crazy about this:

```

 	289	    However, if there are no primes between the lower and upper bounds, 
 	290	    this function could hang forever. For instance, a lower bound of 24 and 
 	291	    an upper bound of 28 would trigger an infinite loop. 
```

It seems to violate the "defensive programming" (or "assume all people are stupid") principle that if the is some very bad input which can be entered, then you should assume that it *will* be entered at some point.

Other than this, the patch looks very well documented, gives good references and examples. I've forgotten how to compile the docs to see if the html comes out okay. Can someone point to a page in the Developers' manual of something where html generation is explained? I don't see the changes in 

```
sage-4.3.rc0/devel/sage-BG-7746/doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/crypto/cryptosystem.html
```

Finally, some general more-or-less stylistic questions.

Is SageObject the best superclass for this? 

Is the best place for blum_blum_shub in util or in a stream cipher module?

> It seems to violate the "defensive programming" (or "assume all people are stupid") principle that if the is some very bad input which can be entered, then you should assume that it *will* be entered at some point.

It looks to me that there needs to be a function called, say, "has_blum_prime(lbound, ubound)" in the module `sage/crypto/util.py`. This function checks to see if there is a Blum prime within the specified lower and upper bounds. One could then use `has_blum_prime()` to first check for the presence of a Blum prime within a specified interval, prior to actually computing a random Blum prime.





> Can someone point to a page in the Developers' manual of something where html generation is explained? I don't see the changes in 

After you have applied the patch and rebuilt your branch, you could use the following command to rebuild the HTML version of the reference manual:

```
./sage -docbuild reference html
```




> Is SageObject the best superclass for this? 

No, not really. Ideally, the best parent class for the class `BlumGoldwasser` is `sage.crypto.cryptosystem.PublicKeyCryptosystem`. I'll see what I can do to make `sage.crypto.cryptosystem.PublicKeyCryptosystem` the parent class of `BlumGoldwasser`.





> Is the best place for blum_blum_shub in util or in a stream cipher module? 

I think the best place for the function `blum_blum_shub()` is in a module for pseudorandom number generators. The module that comes to mind is `sage/misc/prandom.py`. But all functions in that module are exported to the global name space, so those functions are available upon starting Sage, without having to explicitly import them. Adding more functions to the global name space is not a good idea. One wants to minimize Sage's loading time, but also to have a default set of common useful functions. Adding `blum_blum_shub()` to `sage/misc/prandom.py` and polluting the global name space is not my intention. The Blum-Blum-Shub pseudorandom bit generator is not as commonly used as, say, `random()` and `randint()`. For now, `blum_blum_shub()` fits OK in `sage/crypto/util.py`. Functions in that module are not exported by default, which is why you see lots of import statements throughout examples in that module.

Why not 

```

Replying to [@wdjoyner](#comment:4):

```
sage/crypto/stream_cipher.py
```

The module `sage/crypto/stream_cipher.py` acts as a back-end for `sage/crypto/stream.py`. I believe a more appropriate place is to put `blum_blum_shub()` in  `sage/crypto/stream.py`. The latest version of the patch does this.
