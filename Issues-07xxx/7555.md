Cayley tables for permutation groups are broken, see #7340.

For other finite algebraic structures, it would be useful for educational purposes to have tables for whatever operation(s) may be present.

Text file included here provides a class that creates a Cayley table object, it can be generalized to provide a similar table for any object with an addition or multiplication - general groups and rings would be the first places to use it.

Depends on #8579.

Patch contains a new class, `OperationTable`.

This is meant for educational applications, and is unlikely to be used for anything much bigger than can be displayed on a screen or a sheet of paper.  So the speed (it is a bit slow) is not a concern.

Since it only requires a binary operation, I created the groupoids directory, based on the existence of  a category by the same name.

Next thing will be an application of this class to generic groups, fixing #7340.  There are stubs left here for methods to create color and grayscale graphics of the tables.

I've tied the new `OperationTable` class into the categories framework as a multiplication table for Semigroups and as an addition table for Commutative Additive Semigroups.  I've also added it as a Cayley table for groups, since I'd like to later expand this somewhat to take advantage of the extra structure in groups.

The old Cayley table was used to build Latin squares.  I believe the behavior now with the new cayley table will be identical - IF the identity is the first element of the group.

Had a hard time constructing a nontrivial finite additive semigroup, so the documentation there is barebones right now.

As more structures become available in the categories this should be all ready to go, unchanged.  Right now it already makes the multiplication table available for all groups, rather than just permutation groups.

Hi Rob!

Very nice patch! I'll sure use it soon :-)

Replying to [rbeezer](#comment%3A4):
> I've tied the new `OperationTable` class into the categories framework as a multiplication table for Semigroups and as an addition table for Commutative Additive Semigroups.  I've also added it as a Cayley table for groups, since I'd like to later expand this somewhat to take advantage of the extra structure in groups.


That's the way to go!

Out of curiosity: what are the specific features of groups that could
be useful?

> The old Cayley table was used to build Latin squares.  I believe the behavior now with the new cayley table will be identical - IF the identity is the first element of the group.


Isn't that more "if the elements are listed in the same order"?

> Had a hard time constructing a nontrivial finite additive semigroup, so the documentation there is barebones right now.


In waiting for something better, you may want to include a test with a
commutative additive group like:

```
    sage: Z5 = IntegerModRing(5)
```

By the way:

```
    sage: from sage.categories.examples.commutative_additive_monoids import FreeCommutativeAdditiveMonoid
    sage: F=FreeCommutativeAdditiveMonoid(('a', 'b'))
```

Is better constructed as::

```
    sage: F = CommutativeAdditiveMonoids().example(('a','b'))
```

And actually should eventually become:

```
    sage: F = CommutativeAdditiveMonoids().free(('a','b'))
```



> As more structures become available in the categories this should be all ready to go, unchanged.  Right now it already makes the multiplication table available for all groups, rather than just permutation groups.


And for semigroups, which I am very interested in :-) Actually, it
could be generalized to Magmas() (just a binary operation, not
necessarily associative) once we have this category.

I browsed quickly through the patch. Here are some suggestions for
improvements:

- Pass the operation as a function (like operator.mul)
  Then OperationTable will be useful for any binary operation

- For addition or multiplication, the user won't call directly
  OperationTable, but rather use S.addition_table() /
  S.multiplication_table(). So I would remove the guessing
  feature, and make ``operation`` a required parameter.

  (and possibly add an operation_symbol = "+" option?)

- Remove the restriction for the empty operation table, unless
  absolutely necessary.

- comparisons by < do not seem that meaningful. I would just test
  equality of operation tables. Then, there are two possible
  semantics:

   - two tables are equal if they correspond to the same algebraic
     structure, operation and element order

   - two tables are equal if they are equal as "functions", i.e. the
     two operations both map the i-th and j-th element to the same
     k-th element (that's what the current comparison by list of ints
     does)

  I don't have a preference yet.

Note: in many other places, we will need a class for matrices with row
and indices indexed by any objects, and not just integers. This is a
good first step, and it will remain to extract a more general super
class. To prepare the ground, I would suggest the following:

   - Rename list to index_set, or maybe row_index_set, to avoid
   confusion with the usual semantic of list.

   - dict is a bit vague. It is related to ranking (see EnumeratedSets).
   Maybe row_rank, or row_rank_dict.

Is ascii_table really needed? I would tend to just implement _repr_,
and not teach the user another specific way of getting the
representation.

By the way: several other Sage objects (like matrices, partitions,
...) are starting to have a 2d ascii art representation.  We should
standardize the handling of those.

Please add (and use?) a __getitem__ method. It will make
OperationTable not only useful for printing, but also as a useful data
structure for computations.

The last issue is the name of the methods. When we discussed this at
Sage Days 15, we had settled for P.product(x,y) and P.summation(x,y)
as names for the two operations (the choice was not that clear, and
the prevailing argument has been consistency with prod and sum
respectively, and naming the *result* of the operation on x and y)
[1]. Consistency would then call for P.product_table and
P.summation_table, though that is not so nice.

The code is a bit cryptic, but it appeared to me that if the identity was first, then the elements were numbered in the order they were listed.  But I didn't study it that carefully, since I was going to pull it out anyway.

You get `addition_table` with tab completion, but then\n\n```\nAttributeError: 'IntegerModRing_generic' object has no attribute 'addition_table'\n```\n\nwhen you try to execute it. Similarly for `cayley_graph`.  And `FiniteField`s I just assumed rings were not plugged-in yet.  Is there an easy fix?\n\n\n> Is better constructed as::\n\n>\n> \n> ```\n>     sage: F = CommutativeAdditiveMonoids().example(('a','b'))\n> ```\n\n\nWill do.\n\n> Actually, it\n> could be generalized to Magmas() (just a binary operation, not\n> necessarily associative) once we have this category.\n\n\nYes, I wanted this category.  Will there be two - additive and multiplicative?  Also called \"groupoids\" if we want avoid confusion with the CAS.  Doing `search_src` on \"magma\" turns up lots of things related to the program, not the structure.\n\n> I browsed quickly through the patch.

Names can be any string, not just integers, so this doesn't feel like a ranking or an enumerated set to me.  It's more of a translation table.  So maybe there is a better name.  \"translation\"?  But I think rank would be confusing.\n\n> Is ascii_table really needed?

Dear Nicolas,

I knew you'd have some comments!  Thanks for all the helpful advice and suggestions, on categories, and in general.

Yes, it certainly is.  ;-)

Grab a normal subgroup, as close to size sqrt(n) as you can get (perhaps automatically), then order elements in bunches as cosets.  You can sometimes see the quotient structure in the table, especially if done graphically.  But maybe this belongs higher up the hierarchy?

That would of course be sufficient.  The code is a bit cryptic, but it appeared to me that if the identity was first, then the elements were numbered in the order they were listed.  But I didn't study it that carefully, since I was going to pull it out anyway.  Hopefully the change doesn't cause anybody any trouble.

I tried this repeatedly.  You get `addition_table` with tab completion, but then

```
AttributeError: 'IntegerModRing_generic' object has no attribute 'addition_table'
```

when you try to execute it. Similarly for `cayley_graph`.  And `FiniteField`s I just assumed rings were not plugged-in yet.  Is there an easy fix?

Yes, I wanted this category.  Will there be two - additive and multiplicative?  Also called "groupoids" if we want avoid confusion with the CAS.  Doing `search_src` on "magma" turns up lots of things related to the program, not the structure.

Guessing was a "feature" before I found categories.  It'll go away.

Didn't check, but thought I'd have to add lots more logic to handle this case.  Maybe not.

How about "headings"?

The returned dictionary pairs elements with their names.  Names can be any string, not just integers, so this doesn't feel like a ranking or an enumerated set to me.  It's more of a translation table.  So maybe there is a better name.  "translation"?  But I think rank would be confusing.

Yes, I did much the same thing once already for Sudoku puzzles.

Not sure how you mean this to work?  If T is a table, then T[i]=<element>, or T[i,j]=<table-entry>??  More precisely,.....

I really had students in mind as I built this, though everybody might find it useful.  "product" is OK, "summation" sounds like more than two terms.  In any event, what about having both (ie product and multiplication, summation and addition)?  I know people don't like this, and it clutters up tab-completion.  Permutation groups had `multiplication_table` as an alias for `cayley_table`.  I'd really like this to be dead-obvious for the beginner finding their way in Sage.

Thanks again for the interest and help!

Ok. Or maybe it can be just a helper function for how to list the
elements by default, which would be overridden in Groups.

With groupds, there is a possible confusion with the other use of
groupoids (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupoid) which is about
having a partially defined operation; but with associativity holding
whenever meaningful.

Thanks to the s, there is no naming clash between Magmas and Magma, so
that's probably fine (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_%28algebra%29)

Thinking twice about it, I vote for m.column_keys() / m.row_keys() for
consistency with the d.keys() of a dictionary (which we also use for
Family's, and CombinatorialFreeModule elements).

They multiplication table looks very much like a matrix, so one would
want, for u,v elements (not names/labels) of the group to have m[u,v]
be u*v.

Yeah, hard point. multiplication / addition is consistent with __mul__
and __add__. So that's probably ok without cluttering the namespace.

By the way: congrats on being essentially the first non Sage-Combinat

Hi Nicolas,

Allowing more general operations is a big improvement.  See example of table of commutators of a finite group once I get a patch up.  ;-)

I'll include a note in the source to this effect.

Aah - that answers lots of questions.  Thanks.  "categorified"??  Your English is excellent, but that is pretty bad.  ;-) ;-)  ;-)  (But it was I might have said too).

Nice.  I like it.  I'm a fan.  And your ring patch will help me recognize when/how categorification happens.

Patch is complete enough to review.

`__getitem__` implemented.

row_keys/column_keys are the latest name for elements in headings-order.

Left `translation` dictionary as-is.

`addition_table` is a stub of sorts.  Has a doctest, and so on, but can be much better documented when `IntegerModRing` is settled at #8562.  It'll mostly be a cut/paste job from `multiplication_table` with new examples.  

But I'd like this to move forward independently, since my time will be limited for a few weeks.

Thanks for you work on this. This sounds very good, so will set up a
positive review as soon as I get a running 4.3.4 sage to launch the
tests.

Three minor thing I am hesitating about:

- Do we really want coercion in __getitem__. By default, I would tend
  to not do it for efficiency, unless a strong use case comes up in
  practice.

- In OperationTable, there is now a bit of redundancy between S and
  elements; the only place where S is used is to coerce the elements.
  In particular, what about just accepting:

	OperationTable(iterable, operation)

   where iterable is any iterable (up to the user to make sure that it
   is finite).

   No big deal; this can be added later if desirable.

I'll probably post a small reviewer patch with once I can double check
the html doc with micro typos and, if you agree, removing coercion in
__getitem__.

Cheers,
				Nicolas

Coercion here could go away - I've perhaps gone overboard with coercion, envisioning students typing in strings that are not really elements, such as permutations.  So I want to keep coercion in `__init__`.  You are right, if no coercion in `__getitem__` then the object does not need to hold a reference to S.

This struck me as a good idea at first, but again, I'd like a chance to coerce the contents of `elements` (when present) into something (S, a parent), so I'd really like to keep this feature.  It's only on creation, and only once per element.  I find coercion is a hard idea for students to come to grips with, so I'd like to help out as much as possible here and not assume that the input is pure.

Sure, you can clean-up `__getitem__` to suit your tastes.

Thanks for all your help with this.

Hi Robert,

The updated patch contains the following changes:

- OperationTable is moved in sage.matrix.operation_table

- multiplication_table and addition_table are moved in the new
  categories Magmas and AdditiveMagmas respectively (sorry, this
  introduces a dependency on #8579; but there will be many changes
  soon in Semigroups, and this will avoid later conflicts when moving
  things around)

- __getitem__ does not do coercion anymore

- The input can be a finite iterable, as in:

```
        sage: T = OperationTable([False, True], operator.or_, names = 'elements')
        sage: T
            .  False  True
             +------------
        False| False  True
         True|  True  True
```

- self._elts (and thus the column/row keys) is a tuple (reduces the
  risk of accidently changing its content)

- a couple minor doc improvements: using directly :: at the end of a
  sentence describing the next example, putting default values within
  () ...

- I allowed myself to change the '+' and '*' to operator.add and
  operator.mul, for a more uniform logic (anyway, the basic user
  won't use OperationTable directly, and for the others, it is nice
  to show them directly the general approach).

Given that all the code was moved around, a reviewer patch would not
have brought any useful information. So I just folded everything
together.

All tests pass on my ubuntu laptop.

Hi Florent,

Nicolas changed a list to a tuple, so that explains part of this.  Not sure why the table changed.  I'll be working on this about 12 hours from now, so will double-check everything then.

This is fantastic.  Here are some more very minor things:

* two typos in the docs for _name_maker: "fromatting" and "adictionary"
* in column_keys, the OUTPUT: header looks weird without a blank line between it and the following text
* The first example on _ascii_table doesn't look like the top row lines up with the first column (the +---- line should be padded with one more space on the left)

And an enhancement:

* If it makes sense to support slice notation in get_item, or multiple rows/columns, to get a submatrix (subtable), then it would be easy to call the sage.misc.misc_c.normalize_index on the indices that you are already finding in _get_item_ to easily get a nice subtable.

Jason,

Thanks for catching a few details, and for the suggestion.

This is getting mixed up with a bunch of other patches, so I'd like to finalize it.  I have to come back and improve the documentation for the addition table (once integer mod rings are straightened away), so I'll look into slicing then.

Thanks again,
Rob

Hi Nicolas,

Your changes all look good - thanks for those.  Feel free to add yourself to the author field - it'd be good to "share" a patch with you.  So this is a positive review on those.

With latest "fixup" patch, passes all tests in Sage library, docs build without warnings and look OK.

Now the ball is in your court.  A handful of little things, in a separate patch so they are easy to isolate.

- self._S is removed, since it is not needed in `__getitem__` anymore

- "\\cdot" with two backslashesfor latex symbol for generic operation, my mistake

- four fixes from Jason (above)

- title for reference manual, and GPL header in sage/matrix/operation_table.py

- fixed a reference to semigroups which has now moved

So I believe you could check these and we'd be done?

Rob

Thanks for the offer! It'd be a pleasure indeed. Now, you really wrote the bulk of the code. I just did my reviewer's job: all in all, my main code contribution is the writing of the Magmas category, which is not much and for which I'll get credit separately. 

It was a pleasure working as a team on this patch, and I am looking forward writing another patch together :-)

Your fixups look good! I just changed the copyright header as per the
template in http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html,
and used the occasion to replace a r'\blah' into '\\blah' in the
doctests for consistency with the other occurrences in this file.

I reran the tests on the file itself, and on the category code, which I
believe is sufficient. So, on my account, it's now all good to go. Feel
free to set a positive review once you have double checked my changes.

OK, all done.  This has a (cumulative) positive review.

Thanks, Jason, for the contributions, and thanks, Nicolas, for stepping in with all the prompt help with categories and useful fixes and enhancements.  When #8562 is done the addition table docstring can be expanded - doing this is #8596.

To do:  Add slicing as Jason suggests, make graphical output (#8598).

Release manager:

This needs #7880 first, then #8579.  Apply just the "all-in-one" patch.  Once merged, #7340 (the root motivator) can be marked fixed.
