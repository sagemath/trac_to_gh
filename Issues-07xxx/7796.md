From [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/64bcac2d0705570f):

```
I built the html documentation in a fresh 4.3 build using "sage
-docbuild reference html" as usual.  I made a clone, and it appeared
that all the docs were rebuilt (another 5 mins).  I made a change to a
docstring in one file (see #7780) and did "sage -b" and then "sage
-docbuild reference html" again, and again it appeared that all the
docs were built -- another 5 mins. 
```
Mitesh Patel suggests the following fix:

```
A possible workaround:  In

SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python2.6/site-packages/Sphinx-0.6.3-py2.6.egg/sphinx/environment.py

import inspect and insert, e.g.,

                if inspect.isfunction(config[key]):
                    continue

around line 474. 
```

I would be happy to trust you on this without going through all that myself!  But perhaps we need a third opinion before giving this a positive review?

I would think that making this spkg replacement part of the first alpha release of 4.3.1 would be the best way of testing it more thoroughly.

> I then switched back to the main branch and again did a docbuild, expecting nothing to happen -- but a complete docbuild started.

The new spkg-install file deletes all of the documentation output (from all of the branches, not just the active one), so the docs for sage-main were deleted -- that's why they had to be rebuilt.

Anyway, the whole thing works as advertised for me.  Can we give it a positive review now?

Also, do we need to report anything upstream (in conjunction with the changes in #7683)?
