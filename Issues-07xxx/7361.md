There is not necessarily a vertex named 0 in the graph, in which case the first line of your patch does not do what you want...

What you could try is something like that :

```
it=self.degree_iterator()
k=it.next()
for i in it:
   if i!=k:
       return False
return True
```

Besides, if you want your docstring to be "formally" correct, here are a few remarks :
The first line of the docstring should describe in a few words what the function does. In your case : "Tests whether the graph is regular" or simething similar should do.

Two lines later, you explain a bit more in details what it does if necessary.

You can create an INPUT: section to describe the parameters of your method.

Besides : when you want something to be written through LaTeX, like u_1 or \sum_{x=0}^\infty , you have to write it like that :

```
`u_1`
or
`\sum_{x=0}^\infty`
```
When you want a word to be understood a a python keyword, like the name of a variable, or the values True/False, you add two times this sign :

```
``True``
``False``
```

And this is all I can think of for the moment :-)
