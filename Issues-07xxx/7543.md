The definition of S-adic words is found here :

[Pytheas S-adiques](https://www.lirmm.fr/arith/wiki/PytheasFogg/S-adiques)

This patch adds S-adic to the word generator :

```
    sage: tm = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->ba')
    sage: fib = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->a')
    sage: from itertools import repeat

One trivial example of infinite s-adic word::

    sage: words.s_adic(repeat(tm),repeat('a'))
    word: abbabaabbaababbabaababbaabbabaabbaababba...

A less trivial infinite s-adic word::

    sage: m = WordMorphism({0:tm,1:fib})
    sage: tmword = words.ThueMorseWord()
    sage: w = m(tmword)
    sage: words.s_adic(w, repeat('a'))
    word: abbaababbaabbaabbaababbaababbaabbaababba...

Random infinite s-adic words::

    sage: from sage.misc.prandom import randint
    sage: def it():
    ...     while True: yield randint(0,1)
    sage: words.s_adic(it(), repeat('a'), [tm,fib])
    word: abbaabababbaababbaabbaababbaabababbaabba...
    sage: words.s_adic(it(), repeat('a'), [tm,fib])
```

See the patch for more examples.

I just updated the patch (doctest improvements) :

```
    sage: t = words.ThueMorseWord([tm,fib])
    sage: words.s_adique(t, repeat('a'))
    word: abbaababbaabbaabbaababbaababbaabbaababba...
```

I am wondering if I should add a `#random` where I use random examples. Sometimes, other computers gets different random sequence of numbers in the doctest routine...

Hi Sebastien,

I made the following changes in the documentation and the code seems to be OK.

* In english the term is adic (like p-adic numbers)
* I added lines between the item of the INPUT (http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings)

Take care,
Vincent

Thanks for the review Vincent. I agree with your changes.

There are two lines that should be keep "s-adiques" : the reference html to pytheas. Will post a patch soon.

Vincent, to help you make the final review, here is what I changed in the patch to correct the failed doctests (the parameter check doesn't exist yet):

```
- kwds['check'] = False  
+ #kwds['check'] = False 
```

Knowing that

```
sage: timeit('W.size_of_alphabet() not in ZZ')
625 loops, best of 3: 24 µs per loop
sage: timeit('W.size_of_alphabet() is Infinity')
625 loops, best of 3: 3.43 µs per loop

We can win 21 micro seconds (at least on my computer) ! As it not important I switch to postive review...
