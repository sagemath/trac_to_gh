Using

* Solaris 10 update 7 on SPARC
* sage-4.1.2.alpha2
* Sun Studio 12.1
* An updated configure script to allow the Sun compiler to be used  (#7021)

CC was set to the Sun C compler, and CXX to the Sun C++ compiler. The singular configure script does not believe the Sun C++ compiler can create executables. This is the same sort of error as seen in quaddouble-2.2.p9 #7030. 

This time the problem is easy to diagnose. The test is used adds the option -fPIC when trying to test the C++ compiler. But -fPIC is a GNU-specific option - it is not acceptable to the Sun C++ compiler. Instead  -xcode=pic32, -KPIC or -PIC would work, but not -fPIC. 

It's clearly dumb to send a GNU specific option to test a C++ compiler unless you are 100% sure the C++ compiler is the GNU C++ compiler.
