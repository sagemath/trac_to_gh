-The code is
-
-```
-def cylindrical_plot(f,phiran,zran,**kwds):
-   phi=phiran[0]
-   z=zran[0]
-   Rho=(f*cos(phi),f*sin(phi),z)
-   return parametric_plot3d(Rho,phiran,zran,**kwds)

-
-Several examples can be found in [http://www.sagenb.org/home/pub/1325/](http://www.sagenb.org/home/pub/1325/)
-
-For simplicity's sake I have not added default values for the ploting domain, that tends to produce undesired results.
