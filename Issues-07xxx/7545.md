The added patch will add a file 'gaussian_integer.py' which adds `GaussianIntegers` and `GaussianNumberField` to sage. The elements of the `GaussianIntegers` are elements in a quadratic Order, but they have a few more functions. Like `factor`, `gcd`, `is_prime`, `quo_rem`,... Also they are printed as `a + b*i` not as `b*i + a`. Also the coefficients of integers are in `ZZ`, not in `QQ` as for general quadratic orders.

I am not sure if I should propose this ticket for review and inclusion in sage. It maybe against the more general framework in number fields and will create silly exceptions. Also I still have not learned to do this in cython, so it is nowhere as efficient as it should be.

One might also want to change further things, like the function `gcd`. Also `QuadarticField(-1)` should give back `GaussianNumberFields` etc. 

A futher issue is 'i'. By default i is a symbol expression. If someone types `GaussianInteger()` he will probably assume that 'i' is in it afterwards. But changing this would probably not be a good idea.

Anyway, the patch is here to be looked at as it may inspire some further work in this direction.

The Pynac/symbolic one is, yes.  In fact, it looks a lot like the one in this patch already:

```
    K = QuadraticField(-1, 'I', embedding=CC.gen(), latex_name='i')
    pynac_I = K.gen()
```
which by the way appears to be a bug of sorts; `embedding` should be `True` or `False` in this case, which then passes things to `NumberField`, where `embedding` should be the image of the generator in an ambient field.  I don't know if should be considered a bug in `QuadraticField` or in the Pynac implementation, though.  What's actually passed to `NumberField` is `CLF(-1).sqrt()`.

(Parenthetical: sage.rings.all says

```
# i = I = QuadraticField(-1, 'I').gen()
I = CC.gen()
```
So I wonder if there is any conflict between these that would need to get sorted out.  Apparently it just gets overwritten during the import process when Sage starts up.)

Anyway, in sage.symbolic.pynac we have further that

```
    I = new_Expression_from_GEx(ring.SR, g_I)
```
So is it possible to make `I` no longer be this Pynac-wrapped generator of the appropriate quadratic field, but instead stay an element of the number field 'coerced' as robertwb says when appropriate (such as with `2.*I`)?  

I would be very happy to take Chris' excellent start and turn it into that, because I could definitely use it this spring in my own class.  But I'd need help because I don't know how the coercion stuff works at all.

If you'd like to start this (as I believe you understand technical details of Sage coercion, which I do not really) by rebasing the current patch to those tickets in the way you indicate, I should have some time this summer and some motivation to help out.

Looking at this ticket, I fail to see the need for a whole new implementation of `Z[i]`. If `NumberField(x^2+1, 'I').ring_of_integers()` doesn't suit you, we should fix the latter such that it does.

I do agree with just defining the name `GaussianIntegers` to be a synonym of `NumberField(x^2+1, 'I').ring_of_integers()`.

Some stuff already works with this.  However, it is definitely insufficient.
* I can't figure out how to get something prime (I can get the factorization and whether it's a unit, but that's not the same thing).
* What is this?

```
sage: GaussianIntegers([199,0]).quo_rem(GaussianIntegers([100,0]))
(199/100, 0)
```
* There is no `gcd` implemented either.

So I don't think it could just be a synonym, but would it be possible to only slightly extend the class, maybe?  I would be, as mentioned before, very motivated to review something like this, not sure if just adapting the current patch (well, the stuff that is missing) to just extend the current thing is possible or the way to go.

Alternately, should we use `QuadraticField`?

Also, what about the questions in the original post - would these nowadays be fixed by just doing the 'obvious'?  I think that for pedagogical purposes at least, and hopefully general purposes, these would both be useful.

The best choice would be

```
ZI = QuadraticField(-1, 'I').ring_of_integers()
```

This is an indeed an "issue". However, it certainly does not justify adding a whole new class just to print things differently. One should add some kind of option to `NumberField` to `_repr_()` things in a different order.

I don't think that code should go in. Some of the comments above relate to outdated things. After all this ticket is now 5 years old.

Regardless of that. I believe we should have that the standard `I` in sage is an element in the ring of integers of the `QuadraticField`. It may be worth to have this particular field and its ring as a class for the following reason:
* I would really want the printing to change and I am not sure I want to fight for a change for arbitrary number fields.
* I think the global name `GaussianIntegers` could be worth having for educational purposes.
* Maybe there are things from pari's `I` that one can use to increase the speed. Presumably pari's `I` is not just a wrap around `Mod(x,x^2+1)` but I don't know about this.
* It is also one of two in the intersection of `CyclotomicFields` and `QuadraticField`. 
* It could interact with the symbolic `I` and other instances of it.
In any case, this should not be more than a wrapper around optimized code in other places.

What I consider a bug is

```
sage: K = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: I in K
False
```

I don't think so. PARI's `I` is really meant for complex numbers, not for doing number theory. PARI's `I` is a very different thing than `Mod(x, x^2+1)`.

So I think that we have a few separate issues.
* Add prime elements, not just ideals (done)
* Add gcd (ticket #17294)
* Add alias for `GaussianIntegers` (this ticket)
* Worry about printing order
* Figure out how to get `I in GaussianIntegers` to work, if at all possible, or document the heck out of it if not

Can anyone think of anything else that would be needed for pedagogical purposes?  I can only think of
* Plotting Gaussian integers, especially primes, like http://www.jasondavies.com/gaussian-primes/ (though I have some nice interacts of my own for this)

Agreed: this is **very** annoying. And actually, defining `I` as the generator of `ZZ[I]` might work out of the box

```
sage: good_I = QuadraticField(-1,'I').gen()
sage: (good_I + 1.0).parent()
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: (good_I + 1/2).parent()
Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: good_I == I        # not perfect
I == I
sage: bool(good_I == I)  # but not that bad
True
