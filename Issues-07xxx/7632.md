As discussed on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/bc1ea5faa96eea13), we need to document how to write portable POSIX conforming code, using best-practices. One such example, which started the discussion, was using 

```
test "$1" && test "$2" 
```

and NOT 

```
test "$1" -a 	"$2"
```


It would be wise to cite the URL for the 2004 POSIX standard (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition), in the developers guide. The URL is:  

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/

(There is a later 2008 POSIX standard, but some of changes in this may not be implemented in everyone's operating system, whereas most operating systems will implement the 2004 standard). 

Unfortunately, due to what I believe is probably the use of frames, all URLs on this site appear to be the same. As such, if directing people to a URL, right-click on the item required, and copy the URL. E.g for the 'test' tool, it is:
