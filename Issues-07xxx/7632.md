As discussed on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/bc1ea5faa96eea13), we need to document how to write portable POSIX conforming code, using best-practices. One such example, which started the discussion, was using 
 

```
test "$1" && test "$2" 
```
 
and NOT 
 

```
test "$1" -a "$2"
```
 
 
It would be wise to cite the URL for the 2004 POSIX standard (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition), in the developers guide. The URL is:  
 
 http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/
