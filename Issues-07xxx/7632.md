It would be wise to cite the URL for the 2004 POSIX standard (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition), in the developers guide. The URL is:  

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/

(There is a later 2008 POSIX standard, but some of changes in this may not be implemented in everyone's operating system, whereas most operating systems will implement the 2004 standard).
