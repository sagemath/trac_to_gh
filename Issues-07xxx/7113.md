Juan Jose Garcia (author of ECL) has maybe found the bug, which is in ECL:

```
I have found that the GNU C library routines for controlling the
signalling of floating point exceptions, which are not really C
standard but GNU extensions, do not work in the itanium. Well, they
work in the sense that they can suppress the signalling but when
activating it, saving and restoring exceptions, etc, they break.

The solution is taking src/h/config.h
and surrounding the line that contains #undef HAVE_FEENABLEEXCEPT
with something like
#ifndef __ia64__
#endif

I must say I tested this with ECL 9.10.2 but I think the fix should
also work in the versions that Sage is using.

BTW, I do not have access to  my development machine so this fix has
not yet been committed.

Juanjo
