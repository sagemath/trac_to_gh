Total RAM use does not decrease after deleting a worksheet. In the Trash section, it appears as (running).

I suggest the page is stopped, then deleted, as usually someone deleting a worksheet does not plan on working on it further.

When I have to correct a lot of worksheets from the students, I upload one, correct it, save it, and delete it, but RAM eventually gets collapsed.

This should do the trick. It only quits a worksheet if the only user viewing it is the person trashing it, as it may otherwise ruin other people's sessions.
