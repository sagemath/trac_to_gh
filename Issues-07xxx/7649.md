Here is a (small) patch which includes some explanation and references in the docstrings for totallyreal_rel.py.

The roundoff error is a bit mystifying to me, but in any case I
believe I fixed it in the patch: just expanding the bounds works, and seems to only slow it down by a small amount.

In truth, I think the issue has to do with the fact that math.floor
and math.ceil return float64 not ints, and so I have to coerce these
ints, but I couldn't verify this.
