From Chris Wuthrich on sage-edu:
"From my perspective the biggest problem was that I did not allocate
enough resources to the virtual server the notebook was running on.
I was a bit disappointed with the documentation for setting up a
server etc. For instance the docstring of the notebook still contains
lines like
  nb = load('./sage/sage_notebook/nb.sobj')
which do not seem to apply any longer. "

So at least that needs to be cleaned up in notebook_object.py.
