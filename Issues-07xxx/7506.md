From Chris Wuthrich on sage-edu:
"From my perspective the biggest problem was that I did not allocate
enough resources to the virtual server the notebook was running on.
I was a bit disappointed with the documentation for setting up a
server etc. For instance the docstring of the notebook still contains
lines like
  nb = load('./sage/sage_notebook/nb.sobj')
which do not seem to apply any longer. "

So at least that needs to be cleaned up in notebook_object.py.

**Assignee:** boothby

**CC:**  @jhpalmieri

**Keywords:** notebook, documentation, server

**Resolution:** fixed

**Author:** Tim Dumol

**Reviewer:** Mitesh Patel, Dan Drake, John Palmieri

We should have added a note about [attachment:trac_7506-sage_core_lib-notebook-obj-ref.patch], which also adds `notebook_object` to the reference manual.  I'm not sure why it's missing the usual Mercurial header.

If Tim doesn't mind, I suggest that the release manager merge

* [attachment:trac_7506-ref-manual.patch] into the sage repo.
* [attachment:trac_7506-notebook_object-documentation.2.patch] into the sagenb repo.
