On OS X with sage-4.3, if you do "sage -bdist" it creates the dist/sage-* directory correctly. However, it doesn't create the dmg anymore.  It can evidently be made to do so by setting environment variables.  But the default "sage -bdist" doesn't create a bdist.     This is confusing and very inconsistent with the behavior on all other OS's.  For some reason Ivan Andrus changed this in #7546. 

This will have to be fixed back for 4.3.1.

Well, apparently as long as you don't have SAGE_APP_DMG being 'no', it will make the dmg.   At least, that's what happened when I tested this, and Sage worked.  Should I change

```
        echo 'If you wish to create a disk image please set'
        echo 'SAGE_APP_DMG=yes'
```
to something about

```
        echo 'If you wish to create a disk image please do'
        echo 'unset SAGE_APP_DMG'
```
or something similar?

I just don't know what is best; since we want the default to be making a dmg, I guess any of these options make it maximally hard to *not* make a dmg, but maybe they are not very 'shell-script'-y.  I'm putting this as 'needs review' again, but feel free to put it back to 'needs work' with any comments that would make it better.

<a id='comment:7'></a>After the patch "trac_7765-dmg.patch" from seven weeks ago, the functionality is as (I think) it should be, i.e. unless an environment variable "SAGE_APP_DMG" both exists and has a value of "no", the dmg will be built. Good.

As for the documentation/printout statements, one might think of something along the following lines to be more verbose:

``` 
    if [ "$SAGE_APP_DMG" = "no" ]; then
        echo 'If you wish to create a disk image please set'
        echo 'SAGE_APP_DMG=yes'

        echo ' or completely unset SAGE_APP_DMG)'
    else
        echo "Creating dmg"
        echo '(If you don't wish to create a disk image please set'
        echo ' SAGE_APP_DMG=no)'
        DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAGE_ORIG_DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH; export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
        hdiutil create -srcfolder "$TARGET" -format UDBZ "$TARGET".dmg

Could you update the patch, or should I do it (I didn't because otherwise I couldn't be the reviewer, could I)?

<a id='comment:9'></a>I see one problem with this script that no one has yet noticed, and perhaps was William's initial question about it. 

```
Moving final distribution file to /Users/.../sage-4.3.5/dist
mv: rename sage-Sage2-PowerMacintosh-Darwin.* to /Users/.../sage-4.3.5/dist/sage-Sage2-PowerMacintosh-Darwin.*: No such file or directory
```
Right!  Because

```
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
...
    else
        echo 'If you wish to create a disk image please set'
        echo 'SAGE_APP_DMG=yes'
        echo '(or to anything else but the current SAGE_APP_DMG=no,'
        echo ' or completely unset SAGE_APP_DMG)'
    fi
else
    echo "Creating tar.gz"
    tar zcvf "$TARGET".tar.gz "$TARGET"
fi
```
but

```
echo "Moving final distribution file to $SAGE_ROOT/dist"

mv $TARGET $SAGE_ROOT/dist/
mv $TARGET.* $SAGE_ROOT/dist/
```
So the point is that when SAGE_APP_DMG=no, not only is there not a DMG, but not even a .tgz file is created!  Which yields the weird error message I always see from the very last line.

However, testing once again showed that default behavior is now .dmg creation (as it was with the other version of the patch), and none of this should affect anything other than Darwin, so we just have to make sure that we add the right lines to the "else" above and then this should be good to go.  I'll do that in the morning, and then (sigh) we'll need yet another review...
