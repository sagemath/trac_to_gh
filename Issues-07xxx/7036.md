Using

* Solaris 10 update 7 on SPARC
* sage-4.1.2.alpha2
* Sun Studio 12.1
* An updated configure script to allow the Sun compiler to be used #7021 

CC was set to the Sun C compiler, CXX to the Sun C++ compiler and SAGE_FORTRAN to the Sun Fortran 95 compiler. 

rubiks-20070912.p9 totally ignores the setting of CC, and uses gcc which it finds in the path. This is unfortunately not an uncommon problem.

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
Having looked at this package, I can see it was broken in numerous ways. 

* g++ was hard coded
* An option was passed to the assembler in an attempt to suppress warnings, though this would only work with the GNU assembler
* I don't think it could build 64-bit executables - there was nothing about SAGE64 in the spkg-install
* CFLAGS were used when CXXFLAGS should have been used. 

Basically, the makefiles were a total mess. 

The revised .spkg has been tested on
* 32-bit Solaris SPARC with gcc
* 64-bit Solaris SPARC with gcc
* 32-bit Solaris SPARC with Sun compiler
* 64-bit Solaris SPARC with Sun compiler
* Sage.math - I think the default is 64-bit there. 
* 32-bit on bsd.math with gcc
* 64-bit on bsd.math with gcc

There are now no hard-coded options, or compilers. Everything can be set from spkg-install, and is set sensibly. I've tested this with both 32 and 64-bit builds on Solaris, using both the GNU and Sun compilers. Also tested on sage.math. Also tested on bsd.math in both 

The new spkg can be found here. 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/rubiks-20070912.p10/rubiks-20070912.p10.spkg

The spkg-install is here
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/rubiks-20070912.p10/spkg-install

The revised Makefiles, patches etc are in this directory:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/rubiks-20070912.p10

Be warned, the patches are bigger than the makefiles - the chances are so many.

Since you gave this a positive review, I've changed the title from '[with spkg; needs review] ' to '[with spkg; positive review]' 

Now this new radio button has been added to trac that allows one to specify a positive review, should one still add '[with spkg; needs review]' to the title, or the 'needs review' bit ignored?
