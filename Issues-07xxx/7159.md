This patch adds to the Graph class the function merge_vertices.

It is a very common operation in Graph Theory. In a Graph G, one merges two vertices u and v by deleting them and adding a new vertex, which is linked to any other vertex w such that there was an edge uw or vw in G. This can be done with any number of vertices at a time.

Besides, writing this class I noticed there was an error in function edge_boundary :

the function Graph.edge_boundary([u,v]) returns a list of edges, BUT :
* the edges returned do not always contain u or v as their first element. it can be the second one in undirected graphs
* The edges between u and v are returned, which is not the expected behaviour of this function

This patch fixes this too.

Great minds think alike ;-)
I just made a ticket ( #7304 ) for edge contraction, but this ticket is more general, so closing mine as a duplicate.

However, there is something wrong in your patch, as my first try revealed this:

```
sage: P=graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: P.merge_vertices([5,7])
sage: P.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

```
if (v in vertices) and not (u in vertices) and v != vertices[0]:
```
If edge_boundary works as expected, the second test should not be needed as u and v can never be in vertices at the same time. I attach a patch to remove the unneeded test. It applies on top of your patch.

If you agree with this, you can count this as a positive review.

I'm a student in mathematics and a bit of computer science. I use Sage for diverse calculations in graph theory, and when I find that Sage can't do all that I want it to, I have to do something about it ;-P

I read the trac guidelines more closely and there is a last tiny issue before this patch can be said to be perfect:

"Bug Fixes Must Be Doctested: The patch that fixes an issue must also contain a doctest specifically to test the problem."

So all that is missing is a test that displays the expected behavior of edge_boundary(), and that would fail without your patch. For example something like this:

```
sage: G=graphs.DiamondGraph()
sage: G.edge_boundary([0,1])
[(0, 2, None), (1, 2, None), (1, 3, None)]
```
