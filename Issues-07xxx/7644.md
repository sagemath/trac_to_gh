From this [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/34fdf02add8100b6) thread: Make the following work over any base ring:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[[]]
sage: f = 1/(1-x) - 1; f
x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7 + x^8 + x^9 + x^10 + x^11 + x^12
+ x^13 + x^14 + x^15 + x^16 + x^17 + x^18 + x^19 + O(x^20)
sage: g = f.reversion(); g
x - x^2 + x^3 - x^4 + x^5 - x^6 + x^7 - x^8 + x^9 - x^10 + x^11 - x^12
+ x^13 - x^14 + x^15 - x^16 + x^17 - x^18 + x^19 + O(x^20)
sage: f(g)
x + O(x^20)
```

Matt Bainbridge says about power series reversion, which uses pari in some cases, and maybe isn't there in others:

```
Its easy enough to code this in sage.  This seems to work over any
field:


def ps_inverse(f):
   if f.prec() is infinity:
       raise ValueError, "series must have finite precision for
reversion"
   if f.valuation() != 1:
       raise ValueError, "series must have valuation one for
reversion"
   t = parent(f).gen()
   a = 1/f.coefficients()[0]
   g = a*t
   for i in range(2, f.prec()):
       g -=  ps_coefficient((f + O(t^(i+1)))(g),i)*a*t^i
   g += O(t^f.prec())
   return g

def ps_coefficient(f,i):
   if i >= f.prec():
       raise ValueError, "that coefficient is undefined"
   else:
       return f.padded_list(f.prec())[i]
```

The code doesn't quite run, since it references some other function
(ps_coefficient); here's an updated version which uses only built-in
functions:

def ps_inverse_Lagrange(f):
  if f.valuation() != 1:
      raise ValueError, "series must have valuation one for
reversion"
  if f.prec() is infinity:
      raise ValueError, "series must have finite precision for
reversion"
  t = parent(f).gen()
  h = t/f
  k = 1
  g = 0
  for i in range(1, f.prec()):
      k *= h
      g += (1/i)*k.padded_list(i)[i - 1]*t^i
  g += O(t^f.prec())
  return g

In general, return a power series over the fraction field.  But if the leading coefficient is a unit, then despite the fact that Lagrange inversion involves division, the inverse series has coefficients in the same ring as the original series.  E.g., with the function defined in [was](#comment%3A3),

```
sage: PS.<t> = ZZ[[]]
sage: f = t + t^2 + O(t^10)
sage: ps_inverse_Lagrange(f)
t - t^2 + 2*t^3 - 5*t^4 + 14*t^5 - 42*t^6 + 132*t^7 - 429*t^8 + 1430*t^9 + O(t^10)
```
though

```
sage: ps_inverse_Lagrange(f).parent()
Power Series Ring in t over Rational Field
```
Over a ring of finite characteristic, to use Lagrange inversion, you have to lift to a ring of characteristic zero, invert, and then project down to the original ring.

and works fine in all my tests.

I've been looking at this.  One concern is that for power series with rational coefficients the existing method using pari is a great deal faster, so that at least in this case the pari method should be retained.  Strangely the existing method fails for integer power series, though pari handles them perfectly ok.

On investigation it turns out that it is the conversion to pari which is failing and that this problem is pointed out in modular/overconvergent/genus0.py, and raised as #4376.  I have produced a short patch (awaiting review) which extends the range of base rings over which pari conversion of a power series is possible.

What I propose then is that a revised patch (depending on the #4376 patch) should try to use pari and that only if this fails should the Lagrange inversion code be used.   

I also think it is sensible to be able to revert infinite precision series, either by specifying the desired precision or by using the parent's default precision.

Thanks!

Yes, especially if there is work in progress to support converting more rings to pari.  I wrote a revised patch which first attempts to convert to pari and do reversion there, and then tries the Lagrange inversion if conversion to pari fails.  I think that implementation means that this patch can be independent of #4376 -- it will simply perform better when that patch is included.


> I also think it is sensible to be able to revert infinite precision series, either by specifying the desired precision or by using the parent's default precision.  

Yes, upon further consideration I agree.  I've made this and two other improvements:

1. Given a power series with infinite precision and degree `deg`, it's reversion is computed with precision `deg + 1`.
2. Given a power series whose leading coefficient is not a unit, the code tries to pass to the fraction field of the base ring and compute the reversion there.
3. Given a power series over a base ring of positive characteristic, the code tries to lift to a characteristic zero base (using `.lift()`), compute the reversion, and then push back down to the positive characteristic base.  This works over finite fields and `Zmod(n)`, but fails over a base ring like `Zmod(n)[x]`.

Each of these is demonstrated with an example.

A good point (but it would be nice if #4376 could be reviewed; it's very short).

I don't see the logic for this.  I would suggest having a keyword `precision` with default `None`, and replacing

```
    if f.prec() is infinity:
        out_prec = f.degree() + 1
        f = f.add_bigoh(out_prec)
    else:
        out_prec = f.prec()
```
with

```
    if f.prec() is infinity and precision is None:
        precision = f.parent().default_prec()
    if precision:
        f = f.add_bigoh(precision)
```
Then one could do (to get some Catalan numbers):

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[[]]
sage: (x - x^2).reversion()
x + x^2 + 2*x^3 + 5*x^4 + 14*x^5 + 42*x^6 + 132*x^7 + 429*x^8 
+ 1430*x^9 + 4862*x^10 + 16796*x^11 + 58786*x^12 + 208012*x^13 
+ 742900*x^14 + 2674440*x^15 + 9694845*x^16 + 35357670*x^17 
+ 129644790*x^18 + 477638700*x^19 + O(x^20)
```
or

```
sage: (x - x^2).reversion(precision=8)
x + x^2 + 2*x^3 + 5*x^4 + 14*x^5 + 42*x^6 + 132*x^7 + O(x^8)
```
rather than

```
sage: (x - x^2).reversion()
x + x^2 + O(x^3)
```

This is looking good.  Some comments on the docstring:

```
If f has infinite precision, then the precision 
of the reversion defaults to the default precision of 
``f.parent()``. 
```
should say "unless precision is set", or words to that effect.

The remark a few lines later that

```
self must have finite precision (i.e. this cannot be done 
for polynomials).  
```
is no longer appropriate.  Nor is

```
Under the current implementation, the leading 
coefficient must be a unit in the base ring, and the base ring must 
have characteristic zero. 
```
I'm not sure that

```
In positive characteristic, attempt first to lift to characteristic 
zero and perform the reversion there:
```
is in the right place; it's really to do with the algorithm.  Perhaps  better to say here that the function can handle some base rings of non-zero characteristic.
