I just noticed something odd on Solaris 8. bzip2 built fine, but I started the build after modifying one a file in 'prereq'. Then I get:

```
cp -f libbz2.a /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.3/spkg/../local/lib
chmod a+r /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.3/spkg/../local/lib/libbz2.a
cp -f bzgrep /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.3/spkg/../local/bin/bzgrep
ln -s -f /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.3/spkg/../local/bin/bzgrep /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.3/spkg/../local/bin/bzegrep
ln: cannot create /export/home/drkirkby/sage-4.3/spkg/../local/bin/bzegrep: File exists

```

It actually leaves several files starting with the letters 'bz' in local/bin.
