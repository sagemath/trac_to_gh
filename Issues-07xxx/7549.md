In the Sage reference manual, it might be useful to

* List the base classes for a class.
* List inherited members but not their docstrings.
* Include docstrings for "private" variables (e.g., `__init__`, `_foo`).
* Include inheritance diagrams.

Sphinx extensions of interest: [autodoc](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html), [inheritance_diagram](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/inheritance.html).

See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a34a80097ad47805/2e57eb60d7f9881d?#2e57eb60d7f9881d) for some discussions.

The patch, which may depend weakly on #7473's "builder" patch,

* Adds a `sage -docbuild` option `-i` to include inherited members, mostly without docstrings.

* Adds a `sage -docbuild` option `-u` to include "private" variables.

* Uses Sphinx's `:show-inheritance:` [autodoc](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/autodoc.html) option to list the base classes of a class.

* Sets up Sphinx's [inheritance_diagram](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/inheritance.html) extension.  See [attachment:inheritance_example.patch:ticket:6586 this attachment] for an example.  This requires [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/).

It's likely that the attached patch needs work.  In particular, `sage.doc.common.conf.process_inherited` would benefit from expert intervention.

Note: To force a rebuild when toggling `-u`, add `-S -aE` to the command-line.  For example,

```
sage -docbuild reference html -juv3 -S -aE
```
Toggling `-i` should automatically trigger a rebuild.

Should we do this with every Sage library .py and .pyx file?

After fixing this (by ripping out a doctest), things built fine.  The html version of the reference manual looks good, and seems to have all of the methods we want, with the inherited ones having no docstrings.  

Here are some timings on my iMac.  Between each build, I removed the directory doc/output:

```
sage -docbuild reference html -j        11 minutes
sage -docbuild reference html -ji       22 minutes

sage -docbuild reference html -jiu     63 minutes!
```
Also

```
sage -docbuild reference pdf -iu  
```
took too long on my iMac.  On sage.math, it took about 2 hours and then bombed when trying to run pdflatex: there was one error (a missing "r" before a triple-quoted docstring with backslashes); once this was fixed, it ran for a while and then said

```

I don't know if there is a way of fixing this, short of #6495.  (I think that the tex installation on sage.math is somewhat old, which doesn't help.)

```
export extra_mem_bot=8000000; latex ...

Should we move the new options to the "Advanced" section?  Add "may use lots of memory"?

I get the html manual to build, too, although with 1517 warnings when built with "-u", and more than 28,000 warnings with "-iu": either because the docstrings for underscore methods are sloppily formatted (not a surprise) or messages along the lines of those in #8244.

I noticed that after I built with "-j -iu", edited a few files and ran "sage -b", then when I built the manual again with "-j -iu", in the "reading sources" portion of the build, it only processes the changed files, but in the "writing output" phase, it rewrites all of the files.  This could be a little annoying; can it be avoided?

I haven't had the time to try a pdf build yet, but I'll work on that later today.

Aside from my question about why "-iu" rewrites all of the output when it shouldn't have to, I'm happy with this.  (I haven't tested this with "-i" or "-u".)

I've seen this message, too.  It *might* be a Sphinx bug.

The HTML builder writes a hash of the `html_*` settings to `.buildinfo` in the output directory.  It appears that [StandaloneHTMLBuilder.get_outdated_docs](http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/src/tip/sphinx/builders/html.py#cl-144) contains nearly all of the relevant code.

If, for some reason, this `get_outdated_docs` doesn't get called, the builder writes empty strings for the hashes.  For example, `sage -docbuild reference html -j -S -a` does this (`-a` tells Sphinx to write all files).  The next build attempt triggers the warning.

But I don't know if this is responsible for what we see.

If I run `sage -docbuild reference html -i`, I get

```
reading sources... [  8%] sage/algebras/iwahori_hecke_algebra_element
Exception occurred:
  File "/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/common/conf.py", line 354, in skip_member
    if 'SAGE_CHECK_NESTED' in os.environ:
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
The full traceback has been saved in ...
```
I scanned the traceback but didn't see anything obviously helpful.

By the way, I think we can put back the doctest from interfaces/singular.py, by changing the triple quotes at the beginning of the docstring to `r"""`.  The attached patch does this.

Also, I used all of the extra error messages to figure out where the warnings

```
<autodoc>:0: (ERROR/3) Unexpected indentation.
```
were coming from, and the attached patch fixes the problems.  So now, combined with #8457, I get no error messages when building the reference manual (without the -i or -u switches, of course).

For the new warnings when building with -i or -u or -iu, I say we deal with them on another ticket.  It's a big job revising all of the docstrings for underscore functions so that they are in proper reST format.  (Also, right now they're useful -- see the previous paragraph. :)

Finally, do we want some sort of warning for the -i switch, and possibly the -u switch?  ("may be slow, may not be compatible with PDF output" as part of its help string, for example)?
