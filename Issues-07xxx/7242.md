I notice that sage is still including the Python processing module.  It 
seems that in Python 2.6, a version of the processing module was merged   
into the Python standard library under the name "multiprocessing".  I am  
told that it should be possible to convert by just replacing the references to processing with new ones to multiprocessing.

See <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0371/>

We should then be able to drop the "processing" spkg.
