<a id='comment:6'></a>#7820 is a ticket to update the version of gfan to 0.4plus. At the time of writing, the ticket is awaiting review. 

I tested that changed package with Sun Studio 12.1 on Open Solaris (not SPARC like this about). gfan 0.4plus will not build with the Sun compiler on Open Solaris, so I doubt it will build on SPARC either, but I've not checked that.
