According to the Simon Josefsson, there are security issues with version 2.2.1. 

*"Unless you back-port security fixes to 2.2.x, you want to use the 2.8.x release to get proper security fixes."*

There are two other issues with 2.2.1 I am aware of. 
* #7387 gnutls not building on OpenSolaris (x86)
* #7511 gnutls-2.2.1 fails to build on HP-UX 

I do not know exactly what the bug is, but I'm told there are security issues with this release.

I tried to create a .spkg from the latest release, but that failed to build on Solaris 10 (SPARC) so was worst than the older release, though the developers tell me it should be ok.
