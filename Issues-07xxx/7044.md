The `eclib` package is used for elliptic curve computations, it has nothing to do with `calculus`.

I added John Cremona, the developer of eclib, to the CC list.

burcin is right, this is my code.  It seems that the compiler is not finding the NTL library (I mean the NTL include files) which is bound to cause the compilation to fail.

Is NTL building and installing itself properly before this point in the build?
