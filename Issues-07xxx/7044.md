The `eclib` package is used for elliptic curve computations, it has nothing to do with `calculus`.

I added John Cremona, the developer of eclib, to the CC list.

burcin is right, this is my code.  It seems that the compiler is not finding the NTL library (I mean the NTL include files) which is bound to cause the compilation to fail.

Is NTL building and installing itself properly before this point in the build?

The goal of these tickets is laudable, but:

* We need at least one user who is able to test.
* The package/OS information on this ticket is outdated beyond usefulness.
* Upstream is a better place to report portability issues these days.
