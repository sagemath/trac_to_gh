I have verified this.    It is a *very* bad bug, since it means that one thinks the notebook got interrupted, but it didn't.  This results in a seemingly totally broken worksheet, which must cause massive confusion to everybody, to say the least.

Hard to say what's going on here.  My guess would be a bare `except:` somewhere catching the `KeyboardInterrupt`.
