Interrupting the notebook is less robust than it used to be.  The attached worksheet is an example where the notebook fails to interrupt.  When this happens, the notebook acts as though it's interrupted.

I have verified this.    It is a *very* bad bug, since it means that one thinks the notebook got interrupted, but it didn't.  This results in a seemingly totally broken worksheet, which must cause massive confusion to everybody, to say the least.

Hard to say what's going on here.  My guess would be a bare `except:` somewhere catching the `KeyboardInterrupt`.
