New issue: Valgrind versions prior to 3.7.0 do not build on any Linux 3.x kernels, so we really need to upgrade it ASAP.

---
The optional valgrind-3.1.1 did not build in Fedora 12 x86_64

reason: glibc-11 is not supported. Even in the last released stable valgrind-3.5.0

So I downloaded from SVN and made an spkg.

See: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/valgrind-3.6.0.svn.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/valgrind-3.6.0.svn.spkg)

Urgent: we need a maintainer other than me and Michael!

Hi Tim,

Would you mind taking over? I'm not a valgrind expert as Michael was.

I have some problems with sage -t on Fedora 12 64 bit on my computer with i7 860 processor. So I tried valgrind. It came up with some issues. See:

Is there an option to install the package via SVN or is the spkg-file in the download link really broken?

There are some empty shell script in the package, I repaired it for my self with copying some of the files from valgrind.3,5.0 package, and it worked fine.

I guess that make should be replaced by $MAKE in both spkg-check and spkg-install.

The SAGE_LOCAL logic should also be added to spkg-check.

Some message should be printed if tests fail.

The updated changelog in SPKG.txt is wrong (3.6.1 instead of 3.7.0).

I guess the hg log could contain this ticket number at the beginning (#7766: ...)

Moreover the spkg should be named .... .p0.spkg.

Otherwise it looks fine.

I'll test the package now.

Done.

> The SAGE_LOCAL logic should also be added to spkg-check.


It probably doesn't need it since it will run after spkg-install succeeded, but I added it anyway since it's safer than way.  Is there a way to run the tests of an already installed package?

> Some message should be printed if tests fail.


Done.

Oops.

Good point.

> Moreover the spkg should be named .... .p0.spkg.


I thought I read that if there were no patches to upstream then we weren't supposed to put the `.p0` on it, but I changed it since I don't really know.

Thanks for taking the time to review this.

About the p0, the problem was that the directory inside the archive was named with a p0 but not the spkg itself so sage would not find it after decompression.

So removing the p0 from both might be a better choice :)
