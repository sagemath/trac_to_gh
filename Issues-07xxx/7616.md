When testing my new S-units code with trivial examples, I found this corner case bug, but it took Robert Bradshaw and me hours to track down the cause, which I believe is in the code from #1083.

After the patch (with 4.3.rc0):

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-3)
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(x - 5)
sage: a*b
5*a
```
The result was `0` before.

But

```
sage: b

IndexError

IndexError: tuple index out of range

The result was `5` before.

Since b == 5, this is correct.

Disclaimer:   Since I did not follow all the discussions between the 2/3 of you, and the only patch I looked at is the most recent one ( trac_7616_alt.patch ) I may be blind to some of the issues here.

The patch applies fine to 4.3.rc0 and all tests in sage/rings/number_fields pass.

The new code is very well documented both with explanations of what is being done and why, with references to the underlying pari structures, and with lots of examples.  (I also tried some of my own).

It looks fine to me:  I suggest that the best way forward is to pass this, and if there are some problems further down the line then the explanations inserted here as comments will make it easier to deal with them.  Since I know that rlm ran into this problem while working on his S-units and S-class group code, we may find such issues sooner rather than later;  never mind.
