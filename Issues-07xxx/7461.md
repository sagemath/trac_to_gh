I have witnessed this on many 32-bit linux machines:

```
[wstein@flavius sage-4.2.1.rc0]$ ./sage -t --long "devel/sage/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/refinement_matrices.pyx"
sage -t --long "devel/sage/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/refinement_matrices.pyx"

[[times out after 1800 seconds]]

^CKeyboardInterrupt -- interrupted after 1386.7687881 seconds!
         [1387.2 s]
 
```

Doing the same with --verbose dosn't necessarily time out.

It *always* happens on I think every single 32-bit Linux platform with non-verbose doctests.

<a id='comment:5'></a>I think I am seeing this on centos32 on boxen. On this machine, the trouble is that the walltime is somehow severely messed up.

```
sage: walltime()
1256774719.748621
```

*Exactly* ten seconds later:

```
sage: walltime()
1256774720.2823999
```

The difference is only 0.533. At that rate, what is supposed to be a 180 second doctest would take 3,374 seconds.

I'm noticing other strange behavior here too. To debug, I had the code writing to a file. When I kill the doctest, I get my terminal back. But, in the other terminal which I am using to "tail" the file, I watch things continue to be written. Also, running the doctest for one minute, and sending a keyboard interrupt, gives the following:

```
wstein@centos53-32:/tmp/wstein/farm/sage-4.2.1$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/refinement_matrices.pyx
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/refinement_matrices.pyx"
KeyboardInterrupt -- interrupted after 3.99422097206 seconds!
	 [4.5 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


	sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/refinement_matrices.pyx"
Total time for all tests: 4.5 seconds
```

Huh!?!

Also, I have fixed the doctests to ensure that they are truly random, so that all this testing might actually find something.
