It is currently implemented by building the list !
Here are some suggestions: Look at 

```
http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~ivan/F49-int-part.pdf
```
Thanks to #7408 we have a fast algorithm for generating partitions with Plancherel measure. So I suggest the following interface:

```
Paritions(n).random_element()
```
default to

```
Partitions(n).random_element_uniform()
```
and to implement

```
Partitions(n).random_element_Plancherel()
```
Any comment about the interface ? 

Cheers,

Florent

I implemented an algorithm from "Nijenhuis, Wilf, Combinatorial Algorithms" which looks reasonably fast. There is certainly room for improvement. However, It will be done later if needed.
