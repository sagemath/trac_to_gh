The code looks fine to me. I tested it on a 10.6.8 mac under sage-4.8.a3 and on a Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) machine under sage-4.8.a1.

There was a discussion of cached methods in sage-devel, but I'm not sure how that relates to this ticket, so I'm giving this a positive review. Maybe changes, if any, from that thread can go in a separate ticket.

This has been lingering on trac for a while; thought I could review it. I tried to apply these patches to 5.5 in the given order.

The second one gives

```

Is it possible to rebase them? I'll set this ticket to 'needs work' in the mean time.

Hey,

Thank you for working on this. However there are multiple docstring issues you will need to address. More specifically, you will need to change (for example)

```
EXAMPLES:
    sage: H = MatrixGroup([matrix(GF(5),2,[1,2, -1, 1]), matrix(GF(5),2, [1,1, 0,1])])
    sage: h = H(matrix(GF(5),2,[1,2, -1, 1]))
    sage: H.conjugacy_class(h)
    ...

#####

TODO:
    - Implement a non-naive fallback method for computing all the elements of
    the conjugacy class when the group is not defined in GAP, as the one in
    Butler's paper.
    - Define a sage method for gap matrices so that groups of matrices can
    use the quicker GAP algorithm rather than the naive one.

EXAMPLES::

- Conjugacy classes for groups of permutations 

    sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4) 
    ...
```
to

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: H = MatrixGroup([matrix(GF(5),2,[1,2, -1, 1]), matrix(GF(5),2, [1,1, 0,1])])
    sage: h = H(matrix(GF(5),2,[1,2, -1, 1]))
    sage: H.conjugacy_class(h)
    ...

####


.. TODO::

    - Implement a non-naive fallback method for computing all the elements of
      the conjugacy class when the group is not defined in GAP, as the one in
      Butler's paper.
    - Define a sage method for gap matrices so that groups of matrices can
      use the quicker GAP algorithm rather than the naive one.

EXAMPLES:

    sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4) 
    ...
```
otherwise the formatting will be incorrect (the convention is not to use bullet points for different examples). For a full description, see [the conventions page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html:).

Also you will need to cleanup the patch's header message.

Thanks,

Travis

Hey Javier,

Replying to [jlopez](#comment%3A20):
> Thanks for looking at my patch! I have a complicated work situation during the week, but will fix the docstring style and rebase again over sage 5.7 on Friday or Saturday.


Thank you! There's not a huge rush, just ping back when it's done and I'll give it a look-over.

> Not sure what you mean about the patch header message. Do you mean the Spanish characters in my name? That is automatically added by my hg configuration, but it seems that trac does not support UTF-8; I added the appropriate encoding to the python files, but don't know how to do it for the patch (and don't feel inclined to change my name either). If it is about the cruft that came from patch folding, I will take care of that as well.


If you look at the beginning of the patch, you have the following:

```
# HG changeset patch
# User Javier LÃ³pez PeÃ±a <vengoroso@gmail.com>
# Date 1360004753 0
# Node ID 2782ba59f14a8dafdb44e05a67972e5a9d4db0cf
# Parent  fa8decac55338225dc33568ad600c261fc777b4c
* * *
Trac 7886: Conjugacy classes
* * *
Trac 7886: Created module for conjugacy classes of finite groups.
Added wrappers for GAP functions and naive fallback method.
* * *
Trac 7886: Conjugacy classes
```
In particular, the line right after the `# Parent ...` should be a one line summary of the patch with the ticket number (such as `Trac 7886: Conjugacy classes` which is probably what you originally had). This can get mangled when folding patches. You can change this by doing a `qrefresh -e`. I don't think the encoding for your name in the header is important.

Gracias por tu trabajo,

Travis

Hey Javier,

I've attaching a review patch which fixes up the remaining documentation and adds the files to the docbuild (I had to do some extra tweaks in the `categories/finite_groups.py` since it wasn't in the docbuild prior to this patch). If everything works and looks good to you, you go ahead and set this to positive review.

Thanks,

Travis

Hi Travis,

your reviewer patch fails to apply for me:

Are we working over the same version of sage (I'm on 5.7), or did you apply any previous patches that changed documentation files?

You shouldn't return lists from `@`cached_method functions. If somebody mutates the output list then future calls return the wrong result! Always return tuples instead of lists unless you want the output to be mutable.

Also, `ConjugacyClass` is a parent without elements; Use `SageObject` as base for classes that do not use the parent/element pattern.
