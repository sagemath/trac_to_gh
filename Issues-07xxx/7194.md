wrapped list, use intvec as input, wrapped ring (RingWrap for return)...
This can wrap a lot more of Singular functions now.

This needs the header file lists.h, which is not installed by default.

Depends on #6909.
After getting a new singular spkg, which includes the header, I consider this patch ready for review.

Cheers,
Michael

I updated the patch. It now supports matrices as well :-).
I also fixes some problem when returning polynomials.
Cheers,
Michael

P.S.: Next targets are intmat and letter place.

Hi!
A small demonstration of the copy and paste feature:

Singular:

```
proc content(f)
"USAGE:   content(f); f polynomial/vector
RETURN:  number, the content (greatest common factor of coefficients)
         of the polynomial/vector f
SEE ALSO: cleardenom
EXAMPLE: example content; shows an example
"
{
  if (f==0) { return(number(1)); }
  return(leadcoef(f)/leadcoef(cleardenom(f)));
}
example
{ "EXAMPLE:"; echo = 2;
   ring r=0,(x,y,z),(c,lp);
   content(3x2+18xy-27xyz);
   vector v=[3x2+18xy-27xyz,15x2+12y4,3];
   content(v);
}
```

Sage:

```python

from sage.libs.singular.function import singular_function, lib
leadcoef =  singular_function("leadcoef")
cleardenom = singular_function("cleardenom")

def content(f):
    """
    Examples:
    sage: P.<x,y,z>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
    sage: content(3*x**2+18*x*y-27*x*y*z)
    -3
    """
    if f==0:
        return 1
    return leadcoef(f)/leadcoef(cleardenom(f))

```

The latest version supports also modules and free resolution objects.

Free resolution objects form some lazy blackbox in Singular, so I just did some basic blackbox. The rest can be accessed via singular functions using this interface.
So, we might extend Resolution object interface at some time, when it is needed.

Michael
