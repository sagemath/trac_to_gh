```
wrapped list, use intvec as input, wrapped ring (RingWrap for return)...
This can wrap a lot more of Singular functions now.

This needs the header file lists.h, which is not installed by default.

Depends on #6909.
After getting a new singular spkg, which includes the header, I consider this patch ready for review.

Cheers,
Michael

I updated the patch. It now supports matrices as well :-).
I also fixes some problem when returning polynomials.
Cheers,

P.S.: Next targets are intmat and letter place.

Hi!
A small demonstration of the copy and paste feature:

Singular:

```
proc content(f)
"USAGE:   content(f); f polynomial/vector
RETURN:  number, the content (greatest common factor of coefficients)
         of the polynomial/vector f
SEE ALSO: cleardenom
EXAMPLE: example content; shows an example
"
{
  if (f==0) { return(number(1)); }
  return(leadcoef(f)/leadcoef(cleardenom(f)));
}
example
{ "EXAMPLE:"; echo = 2;
   ring r=0,(x,y,z),(c,lp);
   content(3x2+18xy-27xyz);
   vector v=[3x2+18xy-27xyz,15x2+12y4,3];
   content(v);
}
```

Sage:

```python

from sage.libs.singular.function import singular_function, lib
leadcoef =  singular_function("leadcoef")
cleardenom = singular_function("cleardenom")

def content(f):
    """
    Examples:
    sage: P.<x,y,z>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
    sage: content(3*x**2+18*x*y-27*x*y*z)
    -3
    """
    if f==0:
        return 1
    return leadcoef(f)/leadcoef(cleardenom(f))

```

Free resolution objects form some lazy blackbox in Singular, so I just did some basic blackbox. The rest can be accessed via singular functions using this interface.
So, we might extend Resolution object interface at some time, when it is needed.
