First, skip Gears - that project fades out and will be html5. Chrome,
Firefox and Safari are afaik nearly capable of providing these
features, or already do. Gears is just an early example that is
similar to html5.

One feature is to have a database. Then, you can access tables and
entries with (probably a bit limited?) SQL.  For the implementation,
there could be a table for each worksheet, or one table holding all
cells and a n:m relationship table for worksheet:cell or something
like that.

Another html5 feature is to define offline resources. These are html
(or other) files which are stored locally. They will be used for the
starting page and the static javascript code. Maybe it's also possible
for this feature to save everything as such an offline resource and no
need for the database mentioned above.
