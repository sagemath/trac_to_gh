```
This patch extends `ClasscallMetaclass` so that one can control the call of a class trough two different static methods:

- `__classcall__` which behaves as usual and is inherited
- `__classcall_private__` which is not called by derived classes

If both exists the later is used.

By the way it does some polishing of the code.

Thanks Florent, and thanks for using this occasion to cleanup my code!

Can you fix the copyright dates? Mine should be 2009, and yours 2010

I like the idea of using Python's standard convention for private attributes; on the other hand, I am a bit worried about emulating Python's mechanism. In particular, we could eventually get in trouble with the class name hacking we do for pickling:

```
   sage: Sets.ParentMethods.__name__
   'Sets.ParentMethods'
```
I haven't found a way to *use* Python mechanism. So instead, what about using ``__classcall_private__``, and doing the test with '__classcall_private__' in cls.__dict__?

(I also prefer ``private`` to ``no_inherit``).

Cheers,
