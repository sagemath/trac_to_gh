This patch extends `ClasscallMetaclass` so that one can control the call of a class trough two different static methods:

- `__classcall__` which behaves as usual and is inherited
- `__classcall_private__` which is not called by derived classes

If both exists the later is used.

By the way it does some polishing of the code.

**Assignee:** @hivert

**CC:**  sage-combinat

**Keywords:** ClassCall, inheritance

**Resolution:** fixed

**Author:** Florent Hivert

**Reviewer:** Nicolas M. Thiéry

**Merged:** sage-4.3.2.alpha0

Thanks Florent, and thanks for using this occasion to cleanup my code!

Can you fix the copyright dates? Mine should be 2009, and yours 2010

I like the idea of using Python's standard convention for private attributes; on the other hand, I am a bit worried about emulating Python's mechanism. In particular, we could eventually get in trouble with the class name hacking we do for pickling:

```
   sage: Sets.ParentMethods.__name__
   'Sets.ParentMethods'
```
I haven't found a way to *use* Python mechanism. So instead, what about using ``__classcall_private__``, and doing the test with '__classcall_private__' in cls.__dict__?

(I also prefer ``private`` to ``no_inherit``).

Cheers,
