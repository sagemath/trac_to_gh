The min and max arguments should accept variables too, and not just real values or None. This is now possible, along with more complex expressions inside of add_constraint and without even using min/max ( which are still the most efficient way to define constraints )

Also fixes an important bug (copy was used instead of deepcopy, which produced wrong results)

I started looking at your patch. I think it shouldn't be too hard to review. All tests pass !

However, I have one question: is there a reason why you implement all operators <, >, >=, etc. ? You could only implement `__richcmp__` and would do the same job with only one function.

Another strange thing is that the tests pass only when I install GLPK. With CBC, nothing works. Is that normal ?

Hello !!!!

I remember having tried the two This patch has had many different versions At some point some of these classes were "cdef class", then got back to usual python... I remember having noticed at some point that if I were to define < > == ... using richcmp instead of the usual python operators, other low-level comparators would be used by default instead of mine. Well, I had many troubles with this class, so perhaps I should give it a try again now that it works again :-)

It is not normal at all that nothing works with CBC :-/
Could you tell me which kind of errors you get ? 

Thank youuuuuuuuu !!

Here is what I did:

1. I tested all sage with `sage -testall` and all tests passed.

2. I tried `sage -t -optional` on the folder sage/numerical. Of course, some tests didn't pass.

3. I installed CBC. All tests passed with `sage -t *` in the sage/numerical folder, but when I type `sage -t -optional *`, I get the following:

```
[~/Applications/sage/devel/sage-linear/sage/numerical]$ sage -t -optional *
sage -t -optional "devel/sage-linear/sage/numerical/__init__.py"
	 [0.2 s]
sage -t -optional "devel/sage-linear/sage/numerical/all.py" 
	 [0.1 s]
sage -t -optional "devel/sage-linear/sage/numerical/knapsack.py"
	 [13.8 s]
sage -t -optional "devel/sage-linear/sage/numerical/mip.pyx"

```

4. I then installed GLPK, and then all tests passed, with the command `sage -t *` as well as the command `sage -t -optional *`.

If I'm not mistaken and if my installation is not broken, it means that the examples you included in the docstring are based on GLPK and not CBC.

Then it is not a problem at all :-)

The errors you see are in no way related to the present patch. You can see in all of your error messages that the line at fault if followed by : optional - requires GLPK. Note that there is no mention of CBC in those.

These lines are GLPK-specific as they are those who define the functions exporting a LP to a .mps or a .lp file, which make use of the GLPK library.

You had me worried for a while ! :-)

4. There are still lines of code of the form

```
functions = linear_function.constraints 
if linear_function.equality: 
```
It's true that you do not modify the `linear_function` object (you seem only to access the `constraints` and `equality` objects, but this would be cleaner to have methods that give you access to these.

Hello !!!!

First, this new patch contains first my file trac_7311.patch, along with your corrections from trac_7311_review-abm.patch (and my thanks for your time!).

 # (we talked about this together, but for the completeness of this ticket...). The names for Variables and Constraints are totally "useless" at the moment.

   Besides, I have not lost hope of touching the .show() method so that it would use the names of these variables/constraints when the user wants to see his LP.

 # It is dangerous. And it is a mistake :-)

 # I thought the documentation from `__init__` appeared when typing MixedIntegerLinearProgram? .... A bit silly not to have noticed it until now.... You're perfectly right !

Sphinx has some problem to deal with Cython files when generating the documentation and this issue was discussed in #8244.

While retesting the patch, I noticed that some tests didn't pass when one doesn't have CBC or GLPK installed.

This means that some doctest wasn't tagged "optional" properly. Sorry about that, Nathann, but there is still some work to do. I'll try to identify the bugs tonight.
