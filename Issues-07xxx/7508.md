This is another form of the problem I couldn't fix in #6243 and #6851.

**Attachment:** [trac_7508-fderivative_hash_collision_doctest.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7508/trac_7508-fderivative_hash_collision_doctest.patch)

This is fixed (hopefully, for good) in the new pynac package here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.10.spkg

[attachment:trac_7508-fderivative_hash_collision_doctest.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7508/trac_7508-fderivative_hash_collision_doctest.patch) adds doctests for the fix.

Note that the new pynac version also contains fixes for #7264 and #7406. Tests should be run with the patches from those tickets also applied in this order:

* #7508 (this ticket)
* #7264
* #7406

This ticket now depends on #7490.

I should point out that #7264 has a problem, so the spkg should not be merged until that is resolved.
