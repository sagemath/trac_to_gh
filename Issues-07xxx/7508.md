This is another form of the problem I couldn't fix in #6243 and #6851.

Attachment: **[trac_7508-fderivative_hash_collision_doctest.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7508/trac_7508-fderivative_hash_collision_doctest.patch.gz)**

This is fixed (hopefully, for good) in the new pynac package here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.10.spkg

[attachment: trac_7508-fderivative_hash_collision_doctest.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7508/trac_7508-fderivative_hash_collision_doctest.patch.gz) adds doctests for the fix.

Note that the new pynac version also contains fixes for #7264 and #7406. Tests should be run with the patches from those tickets also applied in this order:

* #7508 (this ticket)
* #7264
* #7406

This ticket now depends on #7490.
