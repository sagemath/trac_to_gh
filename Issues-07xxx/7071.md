Using

* Solaris 10 update 7 on SPARC
* sage-4.1.2.alpha4
* Sun Studio 12.1
* An updated configure script to allow the Sun compiler to be used #7021

This is one of the many packages that ignore the setting of the variable CC.

The "xyes" test, as it is called above, is the safest, most portable way to test for a string, as other methods, like the proposed change, can fail under obscure conditions. One might argue they don't fail with modern versions of bash, but IMHO is it worthwhile to write scripts which will always work under all conditions. The original code will always work - the proposed change is less portable. I suggest you take a look at the scripts created by autoconf. You will find they use a similar method to what was in Sage, as it is known to always work. 

As such, I believe the change is a retrograde step. 

Dave

I disagree. The xblah test makes it more difficult to read the test, which both increases the chance for errors as well as the long-term maintenance effort. 

A quick survey shows that at least half of the Sage spkgs use the simplified test, so clearly nobody has yet encountered a shell ancient enough to not work. I'm pretty sure many upstream sources use simplified tests, too, so there is basically no hope of ever compiling Sage on such a system without installing a shell that isn't from the middle ages. Autotools output really is a totally different issue, since their scripts are autogenerated readability is not an issue (and usually is pretty bad, in fact).

If you disagree we can discuss this on the sage-devel, but its such a pervasive issue throughout Sage that it doesn't really matter if we use the simplified test in one spkg more or less.
