[JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) on "The Good Parts" setting, applied to `sagenb/data/sage/js/*.js` but *not* `notebook_lib.js`.  The latter will have its own ticket.

For now, I've disabled [strict mode](http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/), since most (all?) current browsers don't yet have it.

Given the present architecture of the notebook JS library --- use lots of global variables, etc. --- I haven't implemented *all* of JSLint's suggestions.  More generally:
