I committed the patch [7827.atlas.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/7827/7827.atlas.patch) in pjeremy's name. The patched version of `SpewMakeInc.c` is available under `patches/`. I also patched the installation script `spkg-install-script` to copy pjeremy's patched `patches/SpewMakeInc.c` over to `src/CONFIG/src/SpewMakeInc.c`. The relevant modification is:

The updated spkg needs another pair of eyes (anyone's, other than mine) to comb through it. If my change to `spkg-install-script` gets the green light, then the updated spkg can be merged.
