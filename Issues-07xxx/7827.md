An updated spkg is available at

I committed the patch [7827.atlas.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7827/7827.atlas.patch.gz) in pjeremy's name.

I also patched the installation script `spkg-install-script` to copy pjeremy's patched `patches/SpewMakeInc.c` over to `src/CONFIG/src/SpewMakeInc.c`. The relevant modification is:
