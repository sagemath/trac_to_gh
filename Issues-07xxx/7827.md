An updated spkg is available at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/spkg/standard/atlas/atlas-3.8.3.p11.spkg

I committed the patch [7827.atlas.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/7827/7827.atlas.patch) in pjeremy's name. The patched version of `SpewMakeInc.c` is available under `patches/`. I also patched the installation script `spkg-install-script` to copy pjeremy's patched `patches/SpewMakeInc.c` over to `src/CONFIG/src/SpewMakeInc.c`. The relevant modification is:

```
diff -r cffdd7ee34e2 spkg-install-script

+++ b/spkg-install-script
@@ -120,6 +120,10 @@

 # add PPC4 7447 CPU and better Itanium2 detection:
 echo Deal with PPC4 7447 model and Itanium 2
 cp patches/archinfo_linux.c src/CONFIG/src/backend/archinfo_linux.c
```
The updated spkg needs another pair of eyes (anyone's, other than mine) to comb through it. If my change to `spkg-install-script` gets the green light, then the updated spkg can be merged.

This looks good. Note there are also some patches to #8039 which needs work, but I suspect will make it into 4.3.2.
