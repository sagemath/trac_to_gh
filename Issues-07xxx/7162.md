I'm trying to build sage-4.1.2 on disk.math.washington.edu (opensolaris x86) and had to change the spkg-install of gd-2.0.35.p2:

```
# We explicitly disable X support, since (1) X is not a SAGE dependency,
# and (2) the gd build fails on a lot of OS X PPC machines when X is enabled.
./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --without-jpeg --without-x --without-xpm --with-zlib="$SAGE_LOCAL" --with-freetype="$SAGE_LOCAL"
```

I added `--without-xpm`.

Maybe we should make this standard?

This change make the build depend on setting export CFLAGS=-m64

Is this a good thing to  do?

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi, 
you have a point, but there was some logic to this. 

The purpose of the ticket which William opened was to add 

```
--without-xpm
```

to the line where the configure script it invoked. The ticket had nothing to to with SAGE64.

I think whilst trying to build on Solaris in 64-bit mode, you should set CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to include -m64, as that will allow **some** packages to build without making changes to their spkg-install files. This is one such package. 

I've written two scripts (#7505) which check what the compiler is (GCC, Sun Studio, HP, IBM etc). That ticket already has positive review. 

I've written an updated version of sage-env, #7818 which is awaiting review. That will uses those two script, determine the right compiler flag, then automatically export the right compiler flag to CFLAGS. 

As such, I believe making only the change William suggested is sufficient in this case. Just export CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to include -m64, and expect that in the next release or two, that will happen automatically for you. Doing this, will reduce somewhat the number of spkg-install files that need editing.
