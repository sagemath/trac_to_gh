Using

* Solaris 10 update 7 on SPARC
* sage-4.1.2.alpha2
* Sun Studio 12.1
* An updated configure script to allow the Sun compiler to be used  (#7021)

CC was set to the Sun C compiler, and CXX to the Sun C++ compiler. It's apparent that singular is ignoring CC and using gcc instead.

It does build ok with gcc, even though CC is set to the Sun compiler. There is no C++ code, so I can't immediately tell whether CXX is ignored too, but I suspect it is.

I've created a fix for this long standing bug. Basically replacing 'gcc' with '$(CC)' in the makefile. 

I also changed spkg-install so SAGE64 was respected at the same time (in fact, that was my main motivation for fixing this ticket, as the failure to observe CC is not fatal, but a failure to observe SAGE64 is). 

The symmetica package is odd, in that the SPKG.txt makes it clear that fixes are applied to the source directly, not via patches. I find that a bit odd, but followed in the same way. I needed to fix the 'makefile' but left a copy of what I think is the original makefile as /src/makefile.original 

The package now add -m64 with SAGE64 set to yes, and fully respects CC. 

**This must be updated as a package, and not simply a patch applied, due to the fact that changes are made directly in the src directory.**

I've put everything at
