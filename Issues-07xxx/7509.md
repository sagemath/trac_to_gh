Paste the following code into any notebook cell (in any version of sage ever) and you have a debugger. 

```
class debug:
    """
    If you get a traceback in the notebook, type ``d=debug()`` right
    after the error to create a debugger object on that traceback.
    Using the debugger you can move and down the call stack, and 
    evaluate arbitrary code anywhere in the call stack (typically
    to inspect the value of variables).
    
        - printing ``d`` shows the call stack and some context
        - ``d.up(n)`` (or ``d.u(n)``) moves up `n` frames in 
          the call stack
        - ``d.down(n)`` (or ``d.d(n)``) moves down `n` frames
          in the call stack
        - ``d.list(n)`` (or ``d.l(n)``) displays `n` lines of source 
          code context around the current position in the stack trace
        - ``d("some code")`` executes the given code in the
          context of the current position in the stack trace
          
    Notes:
        - Input is not preparsed. 
        - You can define and work with many debug objects at the same time.

Steps to try this out interactively in the notebook:

1. install the patch and rebuild Sage.

2. Do anything that causes a traceback in the notebook, e.g., `EllipticCurve([0,0])`

3. Type `debug()` in any other notebook cell.    You can move up and down the call stack, adjust the amount of context, and evaluate code in the box.   These are the *only* features currently supported -- no setting of breakpoints, stepping through execution, etc.  But this is a very useful first step. 

Source code display for Cython code isn't implemented yet.  That's for another ticket.  I think it's OK to put off, since the command line debugger doesn't support it anyways.

Above t is an HTML string that I'm construting, and output within an <html> block for the notebook.  It thus gets displayed properly.

Ah, now I see what you mean. The stupid source code display needs to have some HTML escaping done, e.g., < turned to &lt;.  There is a function in the notebook that does that properly, and I'll fix the patch accordingly.  Thanks for finding a genuine bug.

This is very nice und useful.

The patch [trac_7509_syntax_highlight.patch] adds syntax highlighting to the stack frame,

The <hr>> things are also fixed. Apply after the first patch [trac_7509.patch].

This is while debugging the example

```
EllipticCurve([0,0])
```

If you type in a command (e.g. "print ainvs"), execute it, switch to a different frame and press enter again, nothing happens: it doesn't execute the print statement in the new frame.  You can get it to execute by hitting the button though.  If you type in a different command, then it starts executing upon pressing enter again.

There are doctest failures in listing, since you updated the functions.

Another small request would be to add a doctest to the evaluate function that demonstrates the case that a user types in a command to the text box which raises an error.

This is a fundamental limitation of `@`interact right now.   I can make a remark about this in the docstring.

I'll fix + improve the doctests and post a new patch.

I want to avoid highlighting the whole file, since this can be quite slow.
On my computer it takes about 2 seconds to load and highlight graphs/generic_graph.py.

I think the main problem when one gets wrong highlighting is when the code fragment
starts in the middle of a docstring. At ticket:12451 there is an improved patch which
detects when the code fragments starts in the middle of a tripple quoted string, and does the correct highlighting in this case.
