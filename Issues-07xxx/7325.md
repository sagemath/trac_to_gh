The patch is a simple interface to two Maxima solvers. 

For one inequality we use solve_rat_ineq from Maxima and for one or more inequalities written as list we use fourier_elim from Maxima.

Please note that #7155 also was about this - always check if a ticket already exists.  I have closed this.

Does this depend (for instance, for parsing 1#0) on any other tickets?  It is usually best if one builds on other Sage capacity, current or forthcoming.

REVIEW:
The basic idea behind this ticket is good.  There is a new global solve_ineq (which could eventually be called from solve if it detects inequalities?), and two different inequality solvers for the univariate and multivariate cases.  So in general, this is on the right track.

However, the implementation of the univariate solve is nearly all in one gigantic Maxima/Lisp command, as far as I can tell, and that makes it incredibly hard to read for the typical Sage/Python programmer.  It is not clear why the various options are there, nor what they do, because of this.  At the very least, the one gigantic command should be separated into smaller pieces, with comments, so that any future person can figure them out.

The output style makes sense, but many more examples would be welcome.  Is it possible that some of the stuff in the first example could be made easier using a little bit of Maxima parsing (e.g., sage.calculus.calculus.from_string_to_symbolic or whatever)?

Also, there are some nonstandard things.  *opts should probably be made more explicit - what are the options or keywords, exactly, that are expected?  All the line breaks make the code harder, not easier to read; Pythonic indentation should be used.  There are also some typos or slightly ungrammatical English (which is fine for a first patch, but a reviewer should eventually check), and the documentation is not in the normal markup format (see other examples, including in the same file, for prototypes, including blank lines and the :: stuff, or see the Sage developer's [guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/)).  

All that said, assuming it works (which I trust it does, but am not currently checking since I can't understand the code), this will be a valuable addition to Sage, particularly since it has a framework that will allow addition of other inequality solving options - such as the upcoming improved to_poly_solve of Maxima, or one or more of the various linear programming solvers now included in Sage per default.

Many thanks for valuable comments. I am still newbie in this and I'll try to improve patch according to your suggestions. 

It was intended as nothing more than interface to commands available in Maxima. 

Btw: This one huge lisp command comes also from Maxima -- it is nothing more than a fix for the bug [SF 2882408](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2882408&group_id=4933&atid=104933) and should be removed after fixing this Maxima bug. Hence only few lines remain, like in other interfaces to Maxima commands.

#1163 has now been updated to parse not equal, at least hopefully; ideally, this patch would be able to use that - or one could open a new ticket.  

As for the current patch, it is a vast improvement on the previous one for readability.

For solve_ineq_univar and solve_ineq_fourier, the output should probably be formatted as a list, like the input is.

This follows probably from updated version of fourier elimination in Maxima. The answers are correct and equivalent to previous answers. I think that it is sufficient to fix the tests and to fix the following message from solve command

```
NotImplementedError: solving only implemented for equalities
```

I'll update the patches after testing on 4.3.rc1

what about to replace output of 

```
solve_ineq(x^2>-1)
```
from 

```
'all'
```
to 

```
x>-Infinity
```
?

I will hopefully soon have time to actually test this - thanks for your patience!  Here are a few things to keep in mind for when you rebase to 4.3.1.alpha1 (as #7745 is now merged).

0. Rebase, of course :)

1. I think I agree that x>-Infinity is much more "Sage-like", or maybe `[x>-Infinity]` would be more in keeping with the other solutions.   Good thought.  Or maybe `[x>-Infinity, x<Infinity]` ?  I'm not sure about that.

2. Probably <code>\`\`special cases\`\`</code> shouldn't be in the quoting environment.  In fact, [] and the above are both lists, so you would just need to clarify what they mean.

3. Something similar should happen with multivariate.  Here, there is also a small inconsistency involved - `[0 < y, y < x, 0 < x]` for multivariate, but `[This is the Trac macro *0 < y, y < x, 0 < x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#0 < y, y < x, 0 < x-macro)` seems to be the univariate result type.  

4. In calculus/calculus.py, there is the following code:

```
maxima = Maxima(init_code = ['display2d:false', 'domain: complex', 'keepfloat: true', 'load(to_poly_solver)', 'load(simplify_sum)'],
                script_subdirectory=None)
```
Maybe the initialization of solve_rat_ineq and fourier_elim should be there?   Otherwise we are trying to load this with every attempt at a solve_ineq, which seems inefficient.

5. Looking at things, I wonder if it would be possible (without too many bugs) to actually implement ineq.solve(), not just solve(ineq) - that is, in relation.py and expression.py, rather than having solve() gag on inequalities, have it at least try the solve_ineq and just catch any exceptions that are raised and instead raise a NotImplementedError for that particular inequality.  I wonder?

But as before, a great addition to Sage - just trying to get the maximum benefit from this ticket!  Thanks again.

I think that it is inefficient to load a bundle of packages whenever Maxima starts. This makes computations provided by Maxima slower. Perhaps we could use some variable swhich stores information, whether solvers of inequality have been used or no. 


And thanks for the other comments.

Robert,

Overall this is really good now.  One possible thing is what the best way to implement the checking for whether things are already loaded - I have no idea whether this is more efficient than before or not, truthfully, I probably should have brought it up.  The other is that usually one imports maxima from sage.calculus.calculus and then one doesn't have to always check the parents.  But since this is new code and not slowing down old code, that can wait - it's really time we have this.

I am still waiting for 4.3.1 to make check on my dev machine, but once it does I will try this out once again and add a tiny reviewer patch - there is a one-character typo, for instance.  Thanks for all your hard work on this!

Can you open a ticket for this and put it as "Reported upstream, " etc.?  Even though it's not a Sage bug, we might as well track it - I don't see the need to upgrade Maxima every time they fix a minor bug that affects Sage, but if there is a ticket for it then when there are enough such tickets that are resolved upstream we will see the need to upgrade.

Hmm, weird in line 5932 (the log(x) log(y) solving inequality) I get a doctest error, where instead of three conditions, I get the (simpler) equivalent two conditions 0<y, y<x or whatever.  If I instead add the condition [y,x], I get the result in the doctest, while [x,y] gives the result that is documented for [x,y].  The same happens on the one with the min in the same doctests.  Could the reason be the same as you mentioned above (changes in the fourier_elim, yet again), or perhaps truly a platform issue (I am on Macintel)?

Aargh, it was so close!  But I am sure this can be easily resolved.  I do like the way you dealt with the "or" things, by the way.  It would be nice to wrap that for understanding general Maxima results (like from to_poly_solve), obviously not in this ticket.

This patch should do it, hopefully it applies to alpha0.  The only changes were in doctests to ensure it passes, and to explain what is going on.  Perhaps it is in Maxima itself that this platform-dependence happens, but I don't have time to check this.

Perhaps to explain in more details what happens for ineq.solve(x):

* ineq has not equality sign, the previous version of solve command raised error, the new version excutes the code above

* we try solve_ineq(self), i.e. we use the Maxima's solve_rat_ineq. This raises error if there are more than one variable and if the solve_rat_ineq is not polynomial or quotient of two polynomial (after moving right hand side to the left and simplifying). Hence this function does not need the name of the variable on input. this is because solve_rat_ineq handles rational inequalities better than fourier_elim

Oh, yes, I understand, I am just suggesting that in the future solve itself (not just solve_ineq) could take the variable given into account as well.

This raises error if there are more than one variable and if the solve_rat_ineq is not polynomial or quotient of two polynomial (after moving right hand side to the left and simplifying). Hence this function does not need the name of the variable on input. this is because solve_rat_ineq handles rational inequalities better than fourier_elim

Yes, of course.  Again, just suggesting that in the future (because the variable order matters for some reason) that the variables could fit in here in the future.  It's still great work!

Incidentally, on Linux:

```
sage: set((x,y))
set([y, x])
```
On Mac:

```
sage: set((x,y))
set([x, y])
```
So that is why we are seeing these changes.  Probably something other than set could solve this issue, so I may open a new ticket for that.
