html fragments are some lines of html code, that can be defined as text variables in a global configuration file. when a notebook page is generated by a template, and those variables are defined (not empty), their value is inserted at given fixed locations. 

primary use is to include the analytics page tracking code right before the bottom </body> tag. (login page, list of notebooks, the notebook itself)

similar is the theme+variable support in moinmoin wiki: [http://moinmo.in/HelpOnThemes#Modify_wiki_configuration](http://moinmo.in/HelpOnThemes#Modify_wiki_configuration)
