Here are some examples of the improvements made by the patch :


BEFORE:

```
sage: t = words.ThueMorseWord()
sage: w = t[:10000]
sage: time _ = [w.number_of_factors(i) for i in range(20)]
CPU times: user 4.19 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 4.19 s
Wall time: 4.19 s
sage: time _ = [w.number_of_factors(i) for i in range(50)]
CPU times: user 10.28 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 10.28 s
Wall time: 10.28 s
```

AFTER:

```
sage: t = words.ThueMorseWord()
sage: w = t[:10000]
sage: time _ = [w.number_of_factors(i) for i in range(20)]
CPU times: user 0.30 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.30 s
Wall time: 0.30 s
sage: time _ = [w.number_of_factors(i) for i in range(50)]
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02 s
sage: time _ = [w.number_of_factors(i) for i in range(100)]
CPU times: user 0.06 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.06 s
Wall time: 0.06 s
sage: time _ = [w.number_of_factors(i) for i in range(1000)]
CPU times: user 4.90 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 4.90 s
Wall time: 4.90 s
sage: time _ = [w.number_of_factors(i) for i in range(1001)]
CPU times: user 4.85 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 4.85 s
Wall time: 4.85 s
sage: time _ = [w.number_of_factors(i) for i in range(2000)]
CPU times: user 27.64 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 27.64 s
Wall time: 27.64 s
```


I should also add some Rauzy graphs examples and some timing improvements on palindrome complexity as well.

I added a patch that improves the rauzy graph function (adds the labels to the edges).

Still needs review!

At least it is not slower and I find it clearer:

```
sage: timeit('G = DiGraph(loops=True)\nfor i in range(200):\n  for j in range(200):\n    d.add_edge(i,j)')
5 loops, best of 3: 248 ms per loop
sage: timeit('d = {}\nfor i in range(200):\n  d[i]=[]\n  for j in range(200):\n    d[i].append(j)\nG=DiGraph(d,loops=True)')
5 loops, best of 3: 266 ms per loop
```

One way to avoid the `word: ` identifier is to set it empty using 

```
sage: WordOptions(identifier='')
sage: Word(range(10))
0123456789
```

but it affects not only the vertices of the Rauzy graph but every single print of a word which might not be exactly what you want...
