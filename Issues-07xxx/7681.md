This interface to R (which is entirely different from the rpy2 python module) is rather hard to do and still needs work. I think the problem is that "vector" in R does something differently than you imagine. I.e. an error happens which isn't shown and the pexpect interface is confused.

```
sage: x = r.c(1,2,3)
sage: r.as_vector(x)
[1] 1 2 3
sage: r.is_vector(r.as_vector(x))
[1] TRUE
```

works for me.

Here what really happens in R:

```
> length(c(1,2,3,4))
[1] 4
> vector(c(1,2,3,4,3))
Error in vector(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 3)) : 
  vector: cannot make a vector of mode '1'.
> as.vector(c(1,2,3,4,3))
[1] 1 2 3 4 3
```

Okay, now I understand this example.  But clearly the error should be shown, correct?  The current behavior is bizarre, and in general this sort of thing happens a lot when trying to use it.

Should we not use the R interface and use rpy2 instead?  But it looks rather more difficult to use, upon a quick perusal of the documentation.

And here's just something randomly annoying:

```
sage: r([1,1/2,1/2])
[1] 1.0 0.5 0.5
sage: r([0,sqrt(3)/2,sqrt(3)/2])
Error: object 'sage10' not found
```
Even though R knows what sqrt(3) is natively:

```
> sqrt(3)/2
[1] 0.8660254
```
I'm not saying this is really related to the summary of the ticket, but it's not unrelated, either.

yes of course, wrong error handling + hickup is bad. these examples might be useful to track down the bug.

[http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2/doc/html/rpy_classic.html](http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2/doc/html/rpy_classic.html) might be helpful when using rpy, though...
