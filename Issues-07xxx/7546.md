There is a syntax error with else and fi on consecutive lines.  Maybe this is intended?

```
        # Rename it with the version number
        mv Sage.app "Sage-$SAGE_VERSION.app"
    else
        echo 'If you wish to create an app bundle please set'
        echo 'SAGE_APP_BUNDLE=yes'
    fi

    # Go back to the right directory for later copying
    cd "$CUR"/tmp/
    if [ "$SAGE_APP_DMG" = "yes" ]; then
        echo "Creating dmg"
        DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAGE_ORIG_DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH; export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
        hdiutil create -srcfolder "$TARGET" -format UDBZ "$TARGET".dmg
    else
        echo 'If you wish to create a disk image please set'
        echo 'SAGE_APP_DMG=yes'
    fi
```
I did this and am now testing on Macintel 10.5, hope to do MacPPC 10.4 as well if it doesn't take forever to build.

Ack!  That's exactly what I meant.  That's what I get for not waiting the incredible amount of time it takes to build before posting a patch.  I have uploaded a patch that I actually tested this time :)

As for the other, try (from the top level sage directory)

cd data/extcode
curl https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7546/app-bundle-7546.patch | sage -hg import -

that seems to have worked for me.  I tried to use hg_sage.import_patch(...) but it put it in the wrong place.  I'm no expert in that part of sage so I probably did something wrong.

It's a patch to the extcode repo, so you have to use `hg_extcode.import`...

I'll change to positive review once I've verified a couple more things, which will depend on how fast sage.math and my own network are.\n\nDo you have any idea why it takes so dang long for the dmg to verify (more than five minutes)?  This could be a real turnoff; I haven't downloaded a binary in a while, so I forget whether that also takes a while to verify.  And then it takes another ten minutes to copy - granted, on an older computer, but this is a long time.  Good thing we have sagenb to try it out!\n\nNaming for PPC/Intel is now #7623.",

Yes, thanks was - I only knew about hg_scripts and hg_sage.  Great!

I should point out that the .DS_Store thing does 

```
1 out of 1 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/ext/.DS_Store.rej
sage/ext/.DS_Store not tracked!
sage/ext/.DS_Store: No such file or directory
abort: patch failed to apply
```

but I think everything actually still works out okay.   I'll change to positive review once I've verified a couple more things, which will depend on how fast sage.math and my own network are.

Do you have any idea why it takes so dang long for the dmg to verify (more than five minutes)?  This could be a real turnoff; I haven't downloaded a binary in a while, so I forget whether that also takes a while to verify.  And then it takes another ten minutes to copy - granted, on an older computer, but this is a long time.  Good thing we have sagenb to try it out!

Naming for PPC/Intel is now #7623.

Okay, the only problem I have found is the following:

IF someone had a previous Sage install with the old notebook, but now downloads and uses this, the script will ask whether they want to migrate their notebooks.  Like this:

```
********************************************************************************
*
* The Sage notebook at
*
*      '/Users/karl-dietercrisman/.sage/sage_notebook'
*
* will be upgraded to a new format and stored in
*
*      '/Users/karl-dietercrisman/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb'.
*
* Your existing notebook will not be modified in any way.
*
********************************************************************************

Would like to continue? [YES or no]
```

Otherwise it all seems to work fine.  Positive review!  

Can we still get this in 4.3?  This would be really good.

I'm also looking to check what happens when I try to run an Intel bundle on a PPC, but unless the network significantly speeds up, that won't happen today.

The reason why I still put positive review despite the migration issue is that at this point the sage-bdist doesn't make these by default, and sage-support can easily point to downloading the non-notebook version when that time comes.  I'm putting that on #7622 as well.
