```
The default `Scheme._point_morphism_class()` has a different signature than the versions in the subclasses of Scheme, causing a `TypeError` when it is called instead of the intended `NotImplementedError`.

Small nonsensical example to trigger it in sage 4.2:

```
sage: S = Spec(ZZ)
sage: f = S.identity_morphism()
sage: from sage.schemes.generic.glue import GluedScheme
sage: T = GluedScheme(f,f)
sage: S.hom([1],T)
TypeError: _point_morphism_class() takes exactly 1 non-keyword argument (3 given)
```

The attached patch should fix it.
