The implementation of RSK in Sage has a number of inefficiencies which add up when dealing with large permutations.  The main improvement comes from using a binary search to figure out where to insert the number.

A last slight improvement would be to avoid the burden of keeping maxes and lenths.

A row version would then be:

```
    def robinson_schensted(self):
        from bisect import bisect
        p = []       #the "left" tableau
        q = []       #the "recording" tableau

        #For each x in self, insert x into the tableau p.
        for i,x in enumerate(self):
            row_counter = 0
            for r in p:
                if r[-1] > x:
                    y_pos = bisect(r, x)
                    x, r[y_pos] = r[y_pos], x
                    row_counter += 1
                else:
                    break
            if row_counter == len(p):
                p.append([x])
                q.append([i+1])
            else:
                r.append(x)
                q[row_counter].append(i+1)

        return [tableau.Tableau(p),tableau.Tableau(q)]
```

This gives me something like a 15% speedup.

This patch greatly improve the speed of RSK even for small permutations:

```
sage: p4 = Permutations(4).list()
sage: timeit("map(attrcall('robinson_schensted'), p4)")
625 loops, best of 3: 1.22 ms per loop
sage: p = Permutations(1000).random_element()
sage: timeit("p.robinson_schensted()")
25 loops, best of 3: 19.5 ms per loop
```
whereas we had:

```
sage: timeit("map(attrcall('robinson_schensted'), p4)")
625 loops, best of 3: 1.34 ms per loop
sage: p = Permutations(1000).random_element()
sage: timeit("p.robinson_schensted()")
5 loops, best of 3: 265 ms per loop
```
However, I was not sure that bisect cut the thing correctly in case of repeated letters so I had to write another test. I'd rather see it integrated into sage.
Please review this minor change. 

Otherwise you can put a postive review. 

Cheers,

Florent
