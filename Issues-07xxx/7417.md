The big public sagenb.org server, after a few days, often suddenly starts outputing this:

This makes a multi-gigabyte logfile, and of course also means that the notebook is down.  This has not been observed on any other notebook server ever, I think.

This is caused by:

```
        exceptions.IOError: [Errno 24] Too many open files: '/sage/sage/local/lib/python/site-packages/sagenb/data/sag
e/html/error_message.html'

exceptions.IOError: [Errno 24] Too many open files: '/home/sage/sagenb/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/pablo.albacete/2/worksheet_conf.pickle'
```

Googling for this error shows that Python itself evidently has a 256 file hardcoded limit.  See, e.g., http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r21366308-Python-IOError-Errno-24-Too-many-open-files

This is regularly causing *massive* trouble on sagenb.org... when there are several dozen simultaneous users.  

This is particularly bad because it leads to data loss, since the notebook server can't save state, since it can't open files. 

This simple test program illustrates this hard limit:

```
v = []
for i in range(300):
    print i
    v.append(open('a%s'%i,'w'))
    sys.stdout.flush()
```

A solution may be here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=919340

They explain that `tempfile.mkstemp()` returns a file descriptor that *must* be explicitly closed.   They give sample code:

```
import sys
import os
import tempfile
import shutil 

for idx in range(5000):
    (outfd,outsock_path)=tempfile.mkstemp()
    print "%(outsock_path)s"%locals()
    try:
        outsock=os.fdopen(outfd,'w')
    except IOError,err:
        print "IOError:",err
        print "idx=%s"%idx
        print "Cannot write to %(outsock_path)s"%locals()
        sys.exit(1)
    outsock.close()
    os.remove(outsock_path)  
```

Since the Sage notebook now uses tempfile, maybe our problem is the same.

In particular, the following fails:

```
for i in range(400):
    fd, name = tempfile.mkstemp()
```
but the following works fine:

```
for i in range(400):
    fd, name = tempfile.mkstemp()
    os.fdopen(fd,'w').close()
```

There are two places in the sagenb code where mkstemp is used:

```
misc/misc.py:        return tempfile.mkstemp()[1]
storage/filesystem_storage.py:        worksheet_txt =  tempfile.mkstemp()[1]
```

So both of these just need to be fixed to properly close the file descriptor.  Or, if safe, instead use `tempfile.mktemp()`, which doesn't make a file descriptor. 
 
Anyway, this is a *huge* bug which will bring down any notebook server eventually so must be fixed for sage-4.2.1.
