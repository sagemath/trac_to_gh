Depends on #7309, #7310 and #7332. This is an initial version of the test suite. Many of these test cases were adapted and mildly modified from Mike Hansen's original Selenium test code.

More test cases to come, but I feel that having a test suite included asap is essential.

Version 5:

* Fixes `TestWorksheet.test_edit`.

* Changes `TestWorksheet.test_7341`, for now, to use

```python
sel.get_eval('window.evaluate_cell_introspection(1, null, null);')
```
   instead of

```python
self.tab('cell_input_1')
```
   For some reason, `self.selenium.key_press_native(9)` doesn't consistently send a TAB character in Firefox 3.5.3, at least for me.  I think the problem is Selenium's.

* Simplifies `TestWorksheetsList.test_searching_for_worksheets`.  Is searching published worksheets broken in sagenb's tip?  I see, e.g.,

```
        exceptions.IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/pub/12/worksheet.html
```
   if I publish a worksheet, visit "Published," and try a search.  Restarting the server fixes the problem.

Anyway, this is great work!  To the extent it counts, my review is positive.

"If nothing else, it would be really good to have a test suite that we can include and that anybody can trivially use with no confusing (or in my case, impossible) setup and configuration issues."

To achieve this --- moreover, a fast, self-contained suite --- Python is a logical choice.  But setup/config may be significantly simpler with simulated browsers.  I suppose we need to cover three areas with up to three frameworks:

a. In-browser - Se, Wa.
b. Sim-browser - FL, Se 2.0, Wa, Zt.
c. Load - FL, Gr.

For 4.2.1, it may also be worthwhile to include one or more of these bug fixes: #7316, #7318, #7339, #7354, #7385.

On organizing tests:

Suppose we put all framework-dependent code (or as much as possible) in `sagenb.testing.notebook_test_case`, where we define `NotebookTestCaseSelenium`, `NotebookTestCaseZopeTestbrowser`, etc., as subclasses of `NotebookTestCaseAbstract`.  Then, we can write tests under `sagenb.testing.tests` with a [largely] framework-independent, higher-level API.  We can select a framework with which to run the tests in `sagenb.testing.run_tests`.

Of course, we can add specialized methods for particular frameworks.  Moreover, over time, we can add or remove framework classes without discarding too many tests.

Thoughts?
