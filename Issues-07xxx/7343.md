Depends on #7309, #7310 and #7332. This is an initial version of the test suite. Many of these test cases were adapted and mildly modified from Mike Hansen's original Selenium test code.

More test cases to come, but I feel that having a test suite included asap is essential.

Version 5:

* Fixes `TestWorksheet.test_edit`.

* Changes `TestWorksheet.test_7341`, for now, to use

```python
sel.get_eval('window.evaluate_cell_introspection(1, null, null);')
```
   instead of

```python
self.tab('cell_input_1')
```
   For some reason, `self.selenium.key_press_native(9)` doesn't consistently send a TAB character in Firefox 3.5.3, at least for me.  I think the problem is Selenium's.

* Simplifies `TestWorksheetsList.test_searching_for_worksheets`.  Is searching published worksheets broken in sagenb's tip?  I see, e.g.,

```
        exceptions.IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/pub/12/worksheet.html
```
   if I publish a worksheet, visit "Published," and try a search.  Restarting the server fixes the problem.

Anyway, this is great work!  To the extent it counts, my review is positive.

Notes:

*  I tried testing WebDriver's Python bindings to no avail.  It may be best to wait for a post-merger release of Selenium.

* Pylot test cases must be written in XML, which is not as expressive as Python.

* Can we use Selenium Grid with a Linux virtual machine to work around the OS X problem, for now?

* zope.testbrowser seems promising for light-weight functional testing.

* For load tests, I think The Grinder and (yes) FunkLoad are worth a closer look.  To get some data, I'll try to extend the simple FL test I ran recently to more complicated scenarios.  The Grinder may well be a better choice, although it's written in Java, since it seems to be mature, well-documented, and actively developed.

To achieve this --- moreover, a fast, self-contained suite --- Python is a logical choice.  But setup/config may be significantly simpler with simulated browsers.  I suppose we need to cover three areas with up to three frameworks:

a. In-browser - Se, Wa.

On organizing tests:

Suppose we put all framework-dependent code (or as much as possible) in `sagenb.testing.notebook_test_case`, where we define `NotebookTestCaseSelenium`, `NotebookTestCaseZopeTestbrowser`, etc., as subclasses of `NotebookTestCaseAbstract`.  Then, we can write tests under `sagenb.testing.tests` with a [largely] framework-independent, higher-level API.  We can select a framework with which to run the tests in `sagenb.testing.run_tests`.

Of course, we can add specialized methods for particular frameworks.  Moreover, over time, we can add or remove framework classes without discarding too many tests.

Thoughts?
