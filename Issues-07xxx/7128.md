An inspection of spkg-install for zlib shows that the -m64 flag is only added on OS X, and not on Solaris. 

```
# The -fPIC is needed otherwise builing libpng fails later
# (at least on a Debian 64-bit opteron).

if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   CFLAGS=" -m64 $CFLAGS -fPIC -g -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\""
   cp ../patches/configure-OSX-64 configure
else
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fPIC -g -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\""
fi
```

There are several things wrong with this
* -fPIC is not a universally used flag. The correct flag to use on Solaris is -KPIC, though -fPIC will be accepted. On other compilers, such as those on AIX or HP-UX, there is no guarantee that -fPIC is the correct flag. 
* The -m64 flag to build 64-bit code is only used on OS X. It is not used on Solaris, despite the fact we are supposed to be supporting Solaris. On some compilers, **the correct flag to produce 64-bit code is not -m64**. IBM's compiler on AIX uses -q64, and HP's on HP-UX uses +DD64.

I've sorted this out for Solaris. Currently the option added is always -m64, which is not ideal, as it will break with compilers other than GNU or Sun, but when #7818 get added, sorting this lot out will be a lot easier. 

On OS X, not only is -m64 added to the flags, but an altered version of a configure script is copied too. There is no need to change the configure script on Solaris, so OS X is still handled differently. 

**Previous code:**

```
if [ "x`uname`" = "xDarwin" ] && [ "x$SAGE64" = "xyes" ]; then
   CFLAGS=" -m64 $CFLAGS -fPIC -g -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\""
   cp ../patches/configure-OSX-64 configure
else
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $FPIC_FLAG -g -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\""
fi

```

Revised code: 

```
if [ "x`uname`" = "xDarwin" ] && [ "x$SAGE64" = "xyes" ]; then
   CFLAGS=" -m64 $CFLAGS -fPIC -g -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\""
   cp ../patches/configure-OSX-64 configure
elif [ "x`uname`" != "xDarwin" ] && [ "x$SAGE64" = "xyes" ]; then
   CFLAGS="-m64 $CFLAGS $FPIC_FLAG -g -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\""
else
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $FPIC_FLAG -g -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\""
fi
```

Sorry, I forgot to add the location of the code. 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/portability/zlib-1.2.3.p6/

There's an spkg there. Best tested on Solaris, using a 64-bit build.

Looks good, but SPKG.txt is not according the standards.

e.g. missing Changelog header, new line between the entries.
