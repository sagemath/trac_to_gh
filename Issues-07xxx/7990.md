Sage 4.3 built fine on Solaris 10 (SPARC), with the smallest of modifications needed if Sun Studio was installed. 

A gcc bug on Solaris causes #7932 to stop Sage building, though a workaround for that has been posted. 

However, another issue has arisen now. Whether it's related or not, I don't know, and have not had chance to investigate, though at first glance it looks unrelated.

See error below.
