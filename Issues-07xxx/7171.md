The code appears to be trying to find information about the number of CPUS, the fails completely trying to find the L1 cache size

It would seem sensible to me the authors change the code so it does not break if it can't get the information it needs. 

However, in the case of HP-UX, I can give them access to the box, but even then you could get another Unix system where you don't know what CPUs it has, or the cache size. In which case assume something sensible
