One of the scripts recently added to sage in ticket #7505 has an extra space in the output when the Sun compiler is used on Solaris. The revised version just used 'sed' to strip out any spaces. 

The problem was not see on the testcc.sh, but I thought it prudent to do do both scripts the same.

## How to test
To test this patch you will need to have Sun Studio installed. 

```
$ local/bin/testcc.sh /opt/sunstudio12.1/bin/cc 
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.3.1.alpha1$ local/bin/testcc.sh /opt/sunstudio12.1/bin/cc 
Sun_Studio
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.3.1.alpha1$ local/bin/testcxx.sh /opt/sunstudio12.1/bin/CC 
Sun_Studio
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.3.1.alpha1$ local/bin/testcxx.sh /opt/sunstudio12.1/bin/CC  | wc 
       1       1      12
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.3.1.alpha1$ local/bin/testcc.sh /opt/sunstudio12.1/bin/cc | wc 
       1       1      11
```

Note how the current version of testcxx.sh outputs 12 characters, not 11. There is an extra space. With the attached patch, any spaces are removed, so the outputs from the two commands are identical. This is important if one wishes to test that the compilers are the same.
