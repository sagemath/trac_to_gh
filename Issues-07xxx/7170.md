I think we should either 

* check for the program 'install' in a modifed 'prereq' script
* Make use of 'cp' installed. 
* include an 'install'  


```
       gcc -O2 -g twist.c  -o twist
        mkdir -p /home/drkirkby/sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/bin
        no install in /home/drkirkby/sage-4.1.2.rc0 /home/drkirkby/sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/bin /home/drkirkby/sage-4.1.2.rc0 /home/drkirkby/sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/bin /usr/local/bin /usr/bin /opt/ansic/bin /usr/ccs/bin /usr/contrib/bin /opt/mpi/bin /opt/hparray/bin /opt/nettladm/bin /opt/upgrade/bin /opt/fcms/bin /usr/bin/X11 /usr/contrib/bin/X11 /opt/graphics/common/bin /opt/pd/bin /opt/resmon/bin /opt/mozilla /opt/netscape /usr/local/bin /opt/gnome/bin /opt/graphics/phigs/bin /opt/OpenSource/bin /usr/sbin/diag/contrib /opt/wbem/bin /opt/wbem/sbin /opt/hp-gcc/bin /opt/aCC/bin /opt/cadvise/bin /opt/sentinel/bin /opt/langtools/bin . /opt/kirkby/bin reid/optimal /home/drkirkby/sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/bin
