String conversion is fine.

```
sage: S('y_1*z_2^2*z_1')
y_1*z_2^2*z_1
```

I know that there is no coercion between these two rings. However, here we have *conversion*. Conversion should -- as much as I understand -- try to make a meaning out of the input, even if the parents do not support coercion.

Therefore I consider this a quite serious bug.

Hi, sorry for taking so long to take a look. The reason for this behaviour is that currently, conversion is simply defined by index:

```python
sage: R.<a,b,c> = GF(3)[]
sage: S = QQ['x','y','z']
sage: S(a)
x
```

So, technically, it is not a bug. However, it might be a good idea to change this behaviour?

I disagree: There is a bug.

Admittedly it is not a bug with my original example, because it contains `z_1` (index 9 in `R.gens()`), whereas `S` only has 9 variables. So, the attempt to find a generator of index 9 must fail (but please with a less cryptic error message!!).

However, we also have

```
sage: S(y_1*z_2^2*z_4)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1154, 0))

ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1154, 0))
...
```
even though we have

```

sage: R.gens().index(y_1)
3
sage: R.gens().index(z_2)
8
sage: R.gens().index(z_4)
6
sage: S.gens()[3]
y_1
sage: S.gens()[8]
z_1
sage: S.gens()[6]
z_3
```

So, using indices for conversion, one *should* have

```
sage: S(y_1*z_2^2*z_4)
y_1*z_1^2*z_3
```
but one gets a traceback.

That is clearly a bug. Is that fixed with your patch?

So, what behaviour do we want?
a) when the number of variables match
b) when the number of variables do not match?

* If we leave a) as it is (by index) but allow b) by name, it could be quite confusing?
* If we change a) to match b) we might break some code?

Time for a little advertisement: At #8821 and #11490, I suggest to add a section in the guided tour resp. a thematic tutorial explaining coercion in Sage (both needs review). At least in #11490, I try to explain the rationale behind the conversion of polynomials in Sage.

I think we should have the following rules:

Let P and Q be polynomial rings, over the same base ring (for simplicity).

If the set of variable names of P is a subset of the set of variable names of Q then the conversion from P to Q is name preserving, and it is used as a coercion. That is how it currently works.

```
sage: P.<a,b,c> = QQ[]
sage: Q = QQ['c','b','d','a']
sage: f = Q.coerce_map_from(P)
sage: f(a),f(b),f(c)
(a, b, c)
```

Otherwise, we should have a position preserving conversion - regardless whether the number of variables matches or not. If the number of variables of P is bigger than of Q, then the conversion is only defined on a sub-ring of P. In any case, that conversion must not be used as a coercion.

Note that at the moment we only have that behaviour if the number of variables matches:

1. Q has more variables than P:

```
sage: P.<a,b,c> = GF(2)[]
sage: Q = GF(2)['c','b','d','e']
sage: f = Q.convert_map_from(P)
sage: f(a)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1154, 0))
...
```
I suggest that one should have

```
sage: f(a), f(b), f(c) # not implemented
(c, b, d)
```

2. Q has as many variables as P:

```
sage: P.<a,b,c> = GF(2)[]
sage: Q = GF(2)['c','b','d']
sage: f = Q.convert_map_from(P)
sage: f(a),f(b),f(c)
(c, b, d)
```
I think that's fine.

3. Q has less variables than P:

```
sage: P.<a,b,c> = GF(2)[]
sage: Q = GF(2)['c','d']
sage: f = Q.convert_map_from(P)
sage: f(a)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1154, 0))
...
```
I suggest that one should have

```
sage: f(a), f(b) # not implemented
(c, d)
sage: f(c)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: That polynomial ring only has 2 variables
```

I'm not sure allowing more variables in the input ring + matching by index is such a good idea. Let me know what you think.\n\n\nI have an argument pro and an argument contra:\n\nI think we agree that the solution for situation 1) and 2) makes sense: It is \"tradition\" in Sage to use a position preserving conversion in 2), and you extended it to 1).\n\nSo, why not extending it to 3) as well? Would that be confusing to the user? Well, if a user is not confused by 2) (which already works in Sage) then s/he will not be confused by 1) or 3) either.\nThe argument \"pro\" is that we have greatest generality, being consistent with the existing solution 2).\n\nOn the other hand, consider the following scenario:\n\n```\nsage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]\nsage: S = QQ['z','y','x']\nsage: S(x),S(y)\n(x, y)\nsage: R(S(x))\nx\nsage: R(S(y))\ny\n```\n\nThat is the current behaviour. But 3) would imply that the conversion from S to R should be position preserving, and thus R(S(x)) would raise an error.

Good!

> However, for 3) it currently just raises an error. I'm not sure allowing more variables in the input ring + matching by index is such a good idea. Let me know what you think.


I have an argument pro and an argument contra:

I think we agree that the solution for situation 1) and 2) makes sense: It is "tradition" in Sage to use a position preserving conversion in 2), and you extended it to 1).

So, why not extending it to 3) as well? Would that be confusing to the user? Well, if a user is not confused by 2) (which already works in Sage) then s/he will not be confused by 1) or 3) either.
The argument "pro" is that we have greatest generality, being consistent with the existing solution 2).

On the other hand, consider the following scenario:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S = QQ['z','y','x']
sage: S(x),S(y)
(x, y)
sage: R(S(x))
x
sage: R(S(y))
y
```

That is the current behaviour. But 3) would imply that the conversion from S to R should be position preserving, and thus R(S(x)) would raise an error. So, having 3) would mean to change existing behaviour that actually seems quite natural. That is a strong argument "contra".

Allow me to modify my suggestion as follows:

 If the set of variable names of S is a subset of the variable names of R then we have a name-preserving conversion in *both* directions, and the conversion from S to R is a coercion. Otherwise, we have a position-preserving conversion in both directions, which is not a coercion.

That would be consistent with the current solution for 2), would coincide with what your patch does in 1), is consistent with the current behaviour of R(S(x)) in the example above, and we would *always* have a conversion.

What do you think...

Cheers,

Simon

If I understood correctly, I still find this confusing, for the following reason:

```python
sage: P.<a,x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S = QQ['x','y','b']
sage: S(a) # conversion by index
x
sage: S(x) # conversion by name
x
```

so we get collisions which I don't like.

In your example, the set of variable names of P is not a subset of the set of variable names of S. Hence, I believe that in your example one should have conversion by position *only*. Thus:

```
sage: S(a)

sage: S(x)

We got two failures (interestingly in two modules I'm quite familiar with):

So, you just need to change two error messages.

I am not sure, but it seems to me that the doc tests of the elliptic curves code became slower. Testing it now.

The updated patch does just that.

Okay, good. Let me know what the verdict is and I'll take a look at performance if needed.

Concerning timings, I was mistaken (had remembered wrong figures): It is 920 versus 922 seconds for all long tests on elliptic curves. So, no significant difference.

With the new patch, all non-long tests pass, and with the old version all but two long tests passed. Hence, it is a positive review.
