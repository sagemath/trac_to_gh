Just take a newly built Sage-4.1.2.alpha4, say, containing the newly introduced maxima 5.19.1 / ecl 9.8.4 (Sage-4.1.1 had older versions of maxima/ecl). In the SAGE_ROOT directory type

```

I was reading the ecl binaries and grepping around (I felt a bit like a "warez person" for a moment)... and found this in the binary:

    ... ECLDIR^@Cannot find ECL's directory^...

So I tried setting ECLDIR, and that fixes the problem.  Maybe we just broken setting it somewhere?   Or?

Planned fix:

Option 1: Put 

```
ECLDIR="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ecl"; export ECLDIR
```
in sage-env, and put the following in the ecl spkg:

```
cd $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/; rm -f ecl; ln -s ecl-* ecl
```

This is robust against moves.  It assumes we don't have multiple local/lib/ecl's installed, which the spkg should fix anyways, right?

Good catch!

I just finished building from scratch Sage-4.1.2.rc0, with the single change the ecl-9.8.4 was replaced by the older ecl-9.41 spkg from Sage-4.1.1. and had essentially the same finding as before. Starting maxima from the build dir:

```
computer:/Users/Shared/sage/build/sage-4.1.2.rc0 georgweber$ maxima
;;; Loading #P"/Users/Shared/sage/build/sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/lib/ecl-9.4.1/DEFSYSTEM.fas"
;;; Loading #P"/Users/Shared/sage/build/sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/lib/ecl-9.4.1/cmp.fas"

Using Lisp ECL 9.4.1
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) quit();

```
After moving, starting maxima failed silently (i.e. without error message), but failed nevertheless. So I guessed it's not something wrong with ecl, but with the way that maxima is built/installed. Now let's have a look into the script $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/maxima. Near the start, we have:

```
setup_vars() {
  if [ -z "$MAXIMA_VERSION" ]; then
    MAXIMA_VERSION=5.19.1
  fi
  prefix=`unixize "/Users/Shared/sage/build/sage-4.1.2.rc0/local"`
  exec_prefix=`unixize "${prefix}"`
  PACKAGE=maxima
  top_srcdir=`unixize "/Users/Shared/sage/build/sage-4.1.2.rc0/spkg/build/maxima-5.19.1.p0/src"`
  libdir=`unixize "${exec_prefix}/lib"`
```
which made me curious how this could have ever worked (it's essentially the same for the old maxima from Sage-4.1.1). But then I saw lines 111 - 123:

```
setup_vars

if [ ! -d "$MAXIMA_IMAGESDIR" ]; then
# Have we been moved?
  MAXIMA_PREFIX=`(cd \`dirname $0\` 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null; dirname \`pwd\`)`
  export MAXIMA_PREFIX
  unsetup_vars
  setup_vars
  if [ ! -d "$MAXIMA_IMAGESDIR" ]; then
    echo "$0: unable to determine MAXIMA_PREFIX" 1>&2
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```
This might be a another good place to set the ECLDIR environment variable (i.e., if it isn't already set), what do you think? (This would avoid the introduction of a new environment variable in sage-env.)

Who's going to make the changes, and who's going to review?
(I do like the one-line change to ecl you proposed.)

Almost, there's more than meets the eye.

If I do the "cd $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ && rm -f ecl && ln -s ecl-* ecl" command and add the following after line 123 in $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/maxima (which one should patch in maxima_spkg/src/src/maxima.in by maxima's "spkg-install"):

```
if [ -n "$MAXIMA_PREFIX" ]; then
  ECLDIR="$MAXIMA_PREFIX"/lib/ecl/
else
  ECLDIR="$libdir"/ecl/
fi
export ECLDIR
```
(do mind the slash at the end of the variables, for me, it does seem to be worse without), then on one test installation it works. On the other I get (and Sage doesn't work either):

```
computer:/Users/Shared/sage/test/sage-4.1.2.alpha4 georgweber$ maxima
;;; Loading #P"/Users/Shared/sage/test/sage-4.1.2.alpha4/local/lib/ecl/DEFSYSTEM.fas"
;;; Loading #P"/Users/Shared/sage/test/sage-4.1.2.alpha4/local/lib/ecl/cmp.fas"
;;; Loading #P"/Users/Shared/sage/test/sage-4.1.2.alpha4/local/lib/ecl/sysfun.lsp"
Maxima encountered a Lisp error:

 NIL is not of type (OR FILE-STREAM STRING PATHNAME).

Automatically continuing.
To reenable the Lisp debugger set *debugger-hook* to nil.
computer:/Users/Shared/sage/test/sage-4.1.2.alpha4 georgweber$
```
If the slash (remark in parenthese above) is missing, the same error message occurs, but without the three lines beginning with ";;;".

The "working installation" is the one with Sage-4.1.2.rc0 and ecl replaced by ecl-9.4.1; the "non-working installation" is Sage-4.1.2.alpha4 (with the current maxima and ecl spkgs). I don't know yet what exactly makes the difference. Next I'll try with Sage-4.1.2.rc0 "vanilla".

For the record, it turns out one must do

```
ECLDIR="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ecl/"
```
instead of what I had.  I've made this fix.
