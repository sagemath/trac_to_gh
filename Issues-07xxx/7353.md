The text on the left bar in Sphinx-generated documents has phrases like "Table of content", "quick search", and so on. Sphinx includes translations of these phrases, so we should use that for our French documentation.

This is very easy: just put `language = 'fr'` in conf.py. This depends on #7190.

I originally thought that the tutorial also needed this, but it doesn't. So maybe I should have just posted this micro-patch at #7190, but since I already opened the ticket, I uploaded the patch here.
