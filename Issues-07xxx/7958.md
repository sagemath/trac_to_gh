<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
Your fix does work great for QQ, but this is actually a more general issue than just QQ:

```
sage: _.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-2)
sage: R.<b> = K.ring_of_integers()
sage: S.<y> = R[]
sage: F = FractionField(S)
sage: F(1)/F(a)
1/a
sage: F(1/a)
*boom*
```

And a minor issue: I think the comment about QQ should be a code comment rather than in the doctest, since it might now confuse users (who might think they need to handle QQ specially themselves).

To see that this issue is now resolved (for rationals and number fields), consider
{{{sage: _.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x<sup>5-3*x</sup>4+2424*x^3+2*x-232)

sage: S.<y> = R[]
sage: F = Frac(S)

But the last three lines highlight a bug in the printing routines.
