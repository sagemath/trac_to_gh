<a id='comment:3'></a>Your fix does work great for QQ, but this is actually a more general issue than just QQ:

```
sage: _.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-2)
sage: R.<b> = K.ring_of_integers()
sage: S.<y> = R[]
sage: F = FractionField(S)
sage: F(1)/F(a)
1/a
sage: F(1/a)
*boom*
```

And a minor issue: I think the comment about QQ should be a code comment rather than in the doctest, since it might now confuse users (who might think they need to handle QQ specially themselves).
