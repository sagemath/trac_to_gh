- weak_le
- bruhat_poset (finite Coxeter groups)
- weak_poset   (finite Coxeter groups)

Improved doctests for related methods

<a id='comment:2'></a>This patch implements the bruhat_order as a cached method and is badly needed.

With Sage 4.3, this raises an exception at the test in coxeter_groups.py, line 1010.

The definition of Q could be rewritten:

```
W = WeylGroup("B3")
sage: fcn = lambda x,y : x.bruhat_le(y)
sage: Q=Poset((W.list(),fcn))
```

Maybe the `?!?` should be removed from the `# long time` directive
a couple of lines later since it is unclear what it means.

Oops, I forgot that this depended on another patch; now #7842.  As you mention, this dependency is trivial though, so we can also work around it if #7842 is not merged instantly.

Fixed, and updated the # long time around that line. I was just surprised by how much time this was taking. We need more Weyl group optimizations!

By now this code is tested a lot, at least for finite Weyl groups, and
the previous reviewer comments were addressed. I am changing the
status to positive review.
