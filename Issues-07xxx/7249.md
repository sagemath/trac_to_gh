At [#7269 comment:24](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7269#comment:24) you say that we need Model-View-Presenter/Controller separation. How hard will that be? It sounds hard. :)  I've run into Unicode string problems while trying to internationalize the notebook, so I'd definitely like to do this if it's the right way to go about it.

MVC [1] separates the layers of the program into a model, which has the data; views, which are ways to present the data; and the controller/s, which control which data to show etc.

Currently the notebook serves as a model/controller and has some view functions mixed into it (`html_*`). Separating things will make things cleaner, and will make dealing with unicode easier: the view is presented with encoded byte strings, the controller deals with unicode strings, and data is retrieved from the model (db or filesystem) in encoded data which is converted to unicode strings.

Without this separation, one will need to check whether each string passed is an encoded byte string or a unicode string.

Separation will entail first removing the `html_*` functions, which in turn means restructuring the templates. I'll be working on that very soon.

V3:

* Fixes a number of doctests.
* `iamges` --> `images` in `cell.py`.
* `inpit_text = input_text.decode('utf-8', str)` --> `input_text = input_text.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')` in `cell.py`.

I'm not sure about the choice of `encode` / `decode` in some places.  Should we always `decode` instances of `str` and `encode` instances of `unicode`?  Could you please double-check the patch?  Also, would it be better to write and use a helper function to do the conversions?

Should the changes to `cell.html` be at #7786?  Isn't `div_wrap` a `boolean`?

Does the change to `Worksheet.preparse` belong at #7835?

If we're planning to use unicode "everywhere", even for the worksheet / cell *system*, should we also **consistently** cover the relevant methods (and examples for) in `worksheet.py` and elsewhere?

I apologize for my ignorance.

Sure, and yes.

div_wrap is a boolean. The div_wrap_ and wrap_ variables are workarounds to limitations present in Jinja2 but not in Jinja, so no, it's not for #7786.
> 
> Does the change to `Worksheet.preparse` belong at #7835?

Since this particular ticket is for Jinja2, which requires unicode, no. #7835 only replaces functionality that was previously present.

> 
> If we're planning to use unicode "everywhere", even for the worksheet / cell *system*, should we also **consistently** cover the relevant methods (and examples for) in `worksheet.py` and elsewhere?

Yes, unicode functionality should be doctested.

In `notebook.py`, should `hunk = encoded_str(hunk)` be `hunk = unicode_str(hunk)`?

In `Cell.__init__`, can we simplify `self.set_input_text(str(input).replace('\r',''))`?

In `twist.py`, do we need to call `unicode_str` on the incoming input?  The constructors and `set_input_text` do this.

Upon saving and quitting a worksheet that contains an evaluated <code>print \`é\`</code> cell, I see

```python
worksheet.py:1924: exceptions.UnicodeWarning: Unicode equal comparison failed to convert both arguments to Unicode - interpreting them as being unequal
```

What about the `unicode_str`s in `twist.py`?  I'm just wondering why we need them.

Minor: It appears we can just call `encoded_str` in `sage_inspect.py`.

Also, can you slip some Unicode characters into the Se and/or doctests, so that we can detect potential regressions?

Sphinx raises

```
reading sources... [100%] sagenb/notebook/worksheet
Sphinx error:
'utf8' codec can't decode bytes in position 420-422: invalid data
```
The "invalid" data appears to be `u'\xe4'` in line 695 (or so) of `worksheet.py`:

```python
            u'\u03ab\xe4\u013b\u01be\u1e40\u0411'                               
```
V8 just makes the docstring raw (`"""` --> `r"""`).  I've added `'Теория чисел'`, partly for fun.

It may be better to make the docstrings unicode strings.  V9 does this, but I can't attach it right now:
