We've been working on factoring polynomials in FLINT very intensively the last couple months.  So we've been making floating point LLL in FLINT.  During the process I just discovered what I thought was my bug but is actually a bug in fpLLL which means it's a bug in SAGE too.

Here's a simple lattice which triggers the bug on my 32 bit machine.
(It's the zero rows which are not handled cleanly causing it to size
reduce in very odd ways...)  For a 64 bit machine I have a much larger example which breaks it.

[[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[1 0 0 0 11]
[0 1 0 0 47]
[0 0 1 0 3748]]

To test the bug in SAGE just run the following code:

matrix([[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,11],[0,1,0,0,47],
[0,0,1,0,3748]]).LLL()

(This was on SAGE 4-1-1 the August 14th version.)
