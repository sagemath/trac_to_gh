<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Okay, I have a successful spkg.  BUT there are a number of things that will have to be fixed.  I have most of them (just doctests) but there are a couple bigger ones.  So this needs work (and a patch), but hopefully will be ready for 4.3.1, when that comes.

The spkg is at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/maxima-5.20.1.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/maxima-5.20.1.spkg).

1. For some reason, a certain integration with infinity is not working properly.  Maybe Maxima regressed on it?  Or maybe we aren't parsing it properly?  

```
sage: integrate(t*cos(-theta*t),(t,-oo,oo))
```

2. Because of overall improvements to to_poly_solve/%solve, there are some annoying things we will have to fix.  Some are just in parsing the new %solve and some other things from its new capabilities, like

```
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression '[If(cos(pi*...!=0,[x=-...],union())]' in Sage
```
though this used to be nicely behaved from 

```
sage: solve(cos(x) * sin(x) == 1/2, x, to_poly_solve=True)
```
but unfortunately one of them is yet another hang in the algsys which doesn't automatically resolve (this is line 5948 in symbolic/expression.pyx):

```
sage: a = .004*(8*e^(-(300*t)) - 8*e^(-(1200*t)))*(720000*e^(-(300*t)) - 11520000*e^(-(1200*t))) +.004*(9600*e^(-(1200*t)) - 2400*e^(-(300*t)))^2
sage: a.solve(t, to_poly_solve=True)
<hang>
```
I'm contacting the author of that for info.

Update: this integral doesn't converge!  It was reported in #6816 but we never checked that it made sense, since Maxima did give an answer - zero, because the limit of the indefinite integral from -N to N is zero.  Maxima now (sensibly) doesn't give that any more, though it would be even better if it returned divergent; however, that would be a different ticket.

Still working on fixing the remaining doctest issues.
