Implements Graph.eulerian_orientation which returns a DiGraph corresponding to an eulerian orientation of the graph :

An eulerian orientation of an eulerian graph is an orientation such that 

```
d^{+} = d^{-} = d/2 
```
for any vertex.

If the graph is not eulerian, this method returns a DiGraph such that 

```
d^{+} + d^{-} = d 
```
and 

```
```
| d^{+} - d^{-} | <= 1

Hi Nathann

Patch looks good. All tests passed! I'm ready to put a Positive review.

However, I'm not a graph expert so I've no idea how clever is the algorithm.
So maybe it should be reviewed by a graph expert. Speaking about clever algorithm, if the complexity is known and in particular if it's known to be optimal or not, it could be a good idea to put a "..note:" in the doc giving this information. Of course the preceding remarks apply to any graph algorithm (and even to any algorithm). So maybe you want to put a positive review anyway.

Cheers,

Florent

From the "complexity" point of view, this algorithm is linear in the number of edges in the graph, so I think it could be filed as "optimal".

From the "practical" point of view, I do not think it would be easy to improve, though I am more and more thinking about trying to write such methods in C rather than in Python... Most of the time in these algorithms is spent on Python considerations rather than on actual Graph computations...

I am sending a mail to sage-devel about your great idea of a general "Complexity" note in algorithms.

Is this a standard in graph theory to call 'm' the number of ??? Actually what ? Edge, Vertex or sum of Both... Maybe this is obvious but better explicit than implicit ;-)
