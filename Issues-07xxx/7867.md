 == The build environment ==
* Sun T5240. 2 x 1167 MHz T2+ SPARC processors 32 GB RAM (t2.math.washington.edu)
* Solaris 10 update 6 (released in 05/2009)
* gcc 4.4.1 configured to use both the Sun assembler and linker.

Error building new version of SAGE.
You might try typing 'sage -ba' or write to sage-support with as much information as possible.

sage: An error occurred while installing sage-4.3.1.alpha1 
```

 == Possible reasons ==
#6583 could possibly be the reason, but I am probably mistaken. The changes were committed only recently, which makes me think it might be the problem.

Based on random googling, I'd suspect the flag `-std=c99`, which is required since the file depends on FLINT. This thread* seems to suggest replacing that flag with `-xc99`. Other threads suggest adding `-xc99=%none`: this flag may be required because it is trying to link in ratpoints, and is the first thing in Sage to try to do so. See this thread^ for more details.

^ - http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-bugs-list/2005-September/030452.html

In particular, the relevant part of limits.h says

```
/*
 * It is invalid to compile an XPG3, XPG4, XPG4v2, or XPG5 application
 * using c99.  The same is true for POSIX.1-1990, POSIX.2-1992, POSIX.1b,

 * or a POSIX.1-2001 application with anything other than a c99 or later
 * compiler.  Therefore, we force an error in both cases.
 */
```

This is where my understanding reaches its boundaries, but maybe I've said something helpful to someone. The ratpoints code is fairly old, and it wouldn't surprise me if the above comment was relevant.

I've tried building ratpoints with

* -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600
* -std=c99
* -std=c99 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600

All 3 allow ratpoints to build, but none of them allow the Sage library to build. 

Ratpoints also currently builds with the option 

```
-DUSE_SSE
``` 

on SPARC, which is a bit silly, as the SPARC processor does not support SSE instructions. Removing that (as is done on OS X already), still does not allow the Sage library to build. 

Ratpoints seems to build with pretty much any options I throw at it - getting it work with the Sage library is not proving so easy. 

I have not tried adding -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600 to the Sage library. I do not know how to do this.

I see no problems with other architectures (tested on Fedora 11 and 12), as it only effects SunOS.

This is a great step forward on the Solaris port!

On open Solaris I now could build matplotlib for instance.

So positive review.
