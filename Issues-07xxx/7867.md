I've tried building ratpoints with

* -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600
* -std=c99
* -std=c99 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600

All 3 allow ratpoints to build, but none of them allow the Sage library to build. 

Ratpoints also currently builds with the option 

```
-DUSE_SSE
``` 

on SPARC, which is a bit silly, as the SPARC processor does not support SSE instructions. Removing that (as is done on OS X already), still does not allow the Sage library to build. 

Ratpoints seems to build with pretty much any options I throw at it - getting it work with the Sage library is not proving so easy. 

I have not tried adding -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600 to the Sage library. I do not know how to do this.

The patch itself only affects Solaris, but to make double sure, you can see I only copied the patch on Solaris. So there is no fear of it breaking on any operating system. 

Unfortunately, the small patch needs a revised configure.in, and a revised configure script, as well as the directory autoconf makes (sometimes copying the configure script alone is not sufficient). 

As such, the Mercurial patch is 1 MB in size. I've attached it here, but you can't view it on trac due to its size.

I see a possible conflict between the current ticket and #7761. Ticket #7761 already has a positive review and its updated Python spkg is `python-2.6.4.p6.spkg`. However, the current ticket (i.e. #7867) also has an updated Python spkg `python-2.6.4.p6.spkg`. Is it possible for you to base your updated Python spkg on top of that at #7761?

Thank you Minh. 

I've created a .p7, based on the ticket at #7761. It may be found here.

I see no problems with other architectures (tested on Fedora 11 and 12), as it only effects SunOS.

This is a great step forward on the Solaris port!

On open Solaris I now could build matplotlib for instance.

So positive review.
