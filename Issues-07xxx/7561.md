InfinitePolynomialRing was responsible for some bugs and extreme slowness in the utilisation of MixedINtegerLinearProgram for LP containing more than 1000 variables.

By replacing this polynomial ring by 'var', this is settled and waaaaayyyy mroe efficient !!

One simple bug in constraints() is also fixed in this patch. A nasty -1 was shifting all the constraints compared to their bounds. This only affected the functions show() and constraints() and is of no incidence on the solve() function.

This patch depends on #7270

**Assignee:** jkantor

**Resolution:** fixed

Hello !!! It seems there are no "id" anymore in the file, and I corrected the x[3]..

The min/max variables are only defined in some (short) functions where they appear natural enough... Do you think we should change the arguments of the add_constraint() function ? I understand why you do not like to see this and I was not aware of it before you mentionned it, but they seem mostly harmless and I have no idea of which keyword we could pick to replace them...

Hi, it seems you didn't upload your new patch.

How about `minimum` & `maximum`? I'll leave it to you to change it or to keep min/max.

This should go into 4.3, it opens a whole new world for MIP problems.
