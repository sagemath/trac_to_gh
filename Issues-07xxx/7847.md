The patch works for me and should not affect browsers that do include the referer.  I don't know if we can use just the workaround for all browsers.

Good job fixing the problem, but unfortunately your patch means anyone can cause you to empty your trash.

The reason for the HTTP-Referer check was actually security. Without it, anyone could have sent you a link to http://localhost:8000/emptytrash (or http://sagenb.org/emptytrash) and empty one's trash. This was clearly the wrong approach though.

This new patch accepts only POST requests, which should be much more secure.
