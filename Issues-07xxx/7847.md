Good job fixing the problem, but unfortunately your patch means anyone can cause you to empty your trash.

The reason for the HTTP-Referer check was actually security. Without it, anyone could have sent you a link to http://localhost:8000/emptytrash (or http://sagenb.org/emptytrash) and empty one's trash. This was clearly the wrong approach though.

This new patch accepts only POST requests, which should be much more secure.
