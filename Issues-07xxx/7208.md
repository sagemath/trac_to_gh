Log of the attached patch:

* Families are parents, in the (Finite/Infinite)EnumeratedSets category
* New class EnumeratedFamily; Family accept any (Finite)EnumeratedSet as input
* Improves the output of lazy families, and update accordingly the
  doctests in CombinatorialFreeModule, ...
* Clean trailing whitespaces
* Use TestSuite
* Fix enumeration for FiniteFamily

Depends on #5891
