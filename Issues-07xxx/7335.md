```
It fails with the following error

```
cc1: error: unrecognized command line option "-mpentium"
```

The fix is simply to simply remove that part of the flags from the Make-arch file for the win32 target.

I will post an updated spkg shortly.

#11504 is this again.

I couldn't extract this properly (it tried, and looked right, but then had 'x's next to everything and was not a folder).

Anyway, the fix is the same.
