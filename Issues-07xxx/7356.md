```
Floats have no LaTeX representation and are formated using str function. Thus output of latex(float(1e25)) is '1e+25' and not '1 \times 10^{25}'. 

The solution is to define function to handle this like the function below

```

def float_function(x):
    r"""
    Returns the LaTeX code for a float ``x``.

    INPUT: ``x`` - float number

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.misc.latex import float_function
        sage: float_function(float(123.05))
        '123.05'
        sage: float_function(float(3e-15))
        '3 \\times 10^{-15}'
        sage: float_function(float(3.2e25))
        '3.2 \\times 10^{25}'
        sage: float_function(float(3.2e+15))
        '3.2 \\times 10^{15}'

        The output is in some cases shorter than latex method for real numbers.

        sage: float_function(float(1e+15))
        '1 \\times 10^{15}'
    """
    s = str(x)
    parts = s.split('e')
    if len(parts) > 1:
        # scientific notation
        if parts[1][0] == '+':
            parts[1] = parts[1][1:]
        s = "%s \\times 10^{%s}" % (parts[0], parts[1])
    return s
```

Will post simple patch, provided it passes tests.

Perhaps yes, but the patch in this trac produces shorter output, so I think that this is better. The patch #7328 produces sometimes zeros which are not necessary at the end of decimal number.
