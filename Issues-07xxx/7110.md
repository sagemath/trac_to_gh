Apart from rebasing existing patches, I've rearranged some files:

* Moved `sagenb/data/templates/*_lib.js` to `sagenb/data/javascript/sage/*.js`.
* Moved TinyMCE initialization code to `sagenb/data/javascript/sage/tinymce.js`.
* Updated affected HTML templates.
* On `notebook_lib.js`'s template macros:
  * `SAGE_URL`: "Replaced" with [this URL](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/users/welcome.html) for now.  The [existing link](http://sage.math.washington.edu/sage/jsmath) is broken.
  * `KEY_CODES`: "Moved," in `twist.py`, to `javascript/sage/keys.js`.  They're still generated dynamically.

However:

* `notebook.js` and friends are now static, so they're not sent through `compress.JavaScriptCompressor`.  It may be much better to use the [YUI compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/).
* There are two versions of `sage3d.js`.  Can we move one or both (after renaming) to `javascript/sage3d` or `javascript/sage/`?
* jsMath initialization is not yet in `javascript/sage/jsmath.js`.  I'll do this at #4714.
* A rebased jQuery / UI upgrade (cf. #5447) will move `farbtastic` to `jquery/plugins`.
* Do we use `zorn`?
* Perhaps we should organize `data/` differently.  By package?  Examples: `highlight` and `sage`, templates and images included.

Patch v2 takes care of `"main.js"` in `notebook.list_javascript_window()`, although this function is currently unused, it seems.
