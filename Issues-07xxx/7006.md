This doesn't seem to build properly on OS X 10.5, 32-bit.  (As far as I can tell, it works with 10.5 64-bit and also with 10.6).  The problem occurs when starting to build ntl:

```
mv mach_desc.h ../include/NTL/mach_desc.h
sh MakeGetTime "gcc -I../include -I.  -O2 -g  -fno-common " "-lm"
does anybody really know what time it is?
gcc -I../include -I. -O2 -g -fno-common -o TestGetTime TestGetTime.c GetTime1.c -lm
running
using GetTime1.c
gcc -I../include -I.  -O2 -g  -fno-common   -I/Applications/sage_builds/sage-4.1.2.alpha2/local/include -o gen_lip_gmp_aux gen_lip_gmp_aux.c -L/Applications/sage_builds/sage-4.1.2.alpha2/local/lib -lgmp -lm

```
If I install the old version of mpir using './sage -f mpir-1.2.p4.spkg', then ntl builds correctly.
