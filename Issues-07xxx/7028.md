Using

* Solaris 10 update 7 on SPARC
* sage-4.1.2.alpha2
* Sun Studio 12.1
* An updated configure script to allow the Sun compiler to be used, I found that matplotlib-0.99.0 will not build. 

CC was set to the Sun C compler, and CXX to the Sun C++ compiler, What appears to be happening is that matplotlib is taking the CC variable but using that to try to build C++ code.

This has been reported upstream to matplotlib-users@lists.sourceforge.net. The developers acknowledge this is a bug, but to quote from Michael Droettboom. 

*This is a years-old known bug in distutils (which it looks like you've already commented on...).  I've looked at it many times over those years, and it's really very difficult to fix from outside without terrible monkey-patching hacks that are certain to break on as many systems as they fix.*

One suggested workaround is to defined CC to be a C++ compiler, then all code gets built with a C++ compiler. I have poined out that there will be a performance impact with this.

So Jeroen, you want to resurrect this issue to fix distutils in sage?
