cliquer seems one seriously messed up package! Under some circumstances (see #6852) it can fail to build as it can't find the Sun C compiler cc. On other occasions, it can build with gcc, even though CC is set to the Sun compiler. 

In the example below, CC was set to the Sun compiler, but cliquer uses gcc instead!

That's because cliquer-1.2.spkg is using SCons. The package cliquer-1.2.p0.spkg at #6681 doesn't use SCons at all.
