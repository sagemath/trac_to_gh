A bit later than I said, but here are some patches.  I'm not sure if this is the right place to put all of them, but they're all related to GF(p)(t)... somehow (if only getting doctests that I broke fixed again)

I've subsumed Robert's patches into 7585_1_FpT-orig.patch and 7585_2_FpT-more.patch.  The third patch is mostly focused on fraction_field_FpT.pyx.  The rest are mostly consequences of the changes I made to residue_field.pyx, but they're pretty wide ranging.

7585_ALL.patch includes everything, but isn't viewable on trac since it's too big.
