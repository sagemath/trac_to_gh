Despite the warning

```
## IMPORTANT: Do *not* import matplotlib at module scope.  It takes a
## surprisingly long time to initialize itself.  It's better if it is
## imported in functions, so it only gets started if it is actually
## going to be used.
```

it's gotten back in there again. There should be a test.
