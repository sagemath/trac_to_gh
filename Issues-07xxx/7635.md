The code here is simple, and ipaddr.py will be in Python 2.7 and is (I think) in Python 3.1, so we can drop that later. The only thing I'm worried about now is something that confused me when testing this -- you have to specify `address=*` *in addition to'' `subnet=[...]`. That strikes me as confusing -- they seem to be saying the same thing.

Of course, if you read carefully and understand networking, they're not -- `address` refers to a network *interface*. So perhaps we can change `address` to `interface`, but continue accepting `address` for backwards compatibility? Something like this in the docstring:

```
            - ``interface``       -- (default: 'localhost'), address of network
              interface to listen on; give '' to listen on all interfaces. You may 
              use ``address`` here for backwards compatibility, but this is deprecated
              and will be removed in the future.
```
along with a warning issued when `notebook()` gets an `address=` keyword.

Or, we could have `subnets` imply `address=''`.

This will be a positive review once this small issue is sorted out.

On Wikipedia it says \"Localhost always translates to the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1 in IPv4.\"\n\n\nI'm using Ubuntu 9.10. You're right that localhost always resolves to 127.0.0.1, but apparently connections over the loopback network interface can get assigned IP addresses other than that.\n\nThe source of all this confusion is that I've never actually given a real value to `address`! I have only ever given `address=''` to listen to everything, or not specified it at all to make it do localhost only. My computer is klee.kaist.ac.kr and I tried address='klee', so maybe I should go back and try some more.\n\n> Your patch has 127.0.0.1/8 by the way. \n\n\nI noticed.

Maybe the patch at #7639 isn't quite right; do we need the name of an *interface* (such as \"eth0\" or \"lo\") or an IP address to which that interface is bound?

> Wow! Your localhost is 127.0.1.1?  What operating system is that on?  For me on OS X and sage.math, localhost is 127.0.0.1.  On Wikipedia it says "Localhost always translates to the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1 in IPv4."


I'm using Ubuntu 9.10. You're right that localhost always resolves to 127.0.0.1, but apparently connections over the loopback network interface can get assigned IP addresses other than that.

The source of all this confusion is that I've never actually given a real value to `address`! I have only ever given `address=''` to listen to everything, or not specified it at all to make it do localhost only. My computer is klee.kaist.ac.kr and I tried address='klee', so maybe I should go back and try some more.

> Your patch has 127.0.0.1/8 by the way. 


I noticed. I should change that, although the /8 bitmask means that the last three octets don't matter.

> I guess your micro patch doesn't quite work because of the line `if '127.0.0.1' not in subnets:` right above the insert line.


I noticed that before, but it's not going to make a big difference -- if someone puts '127.0.0.1/8' or whatever into subnets, then the resulting list in memory would be something like

```
['127.0.0.0/8', something, '127.0.0.1/8']
```
which won't make any real difference with access control.

 
> Also, are you sure about your patch?  You say: Try `notebook(address='x.y.z', subnets=['blah'])`  But as soon as you explicitly specify the address then Twisted only listens on that interface and ignores localhost or any other interface (localhost is just a network interface like any other).

I think I'm going to play around with the address keyword some more until I understand how it works. Maybe the patch at #7639 isn't quite right; do we need the name of an *interface* (such as "eth0" or "lo") or an IP address to which that interface is bound? I'll play around a bit more and report back.

I think we need the *address* to which that interface is bound.  That's why I called the parameter "address" before.  However, in twisted it is called "interface", so your suggestion to change that name is definitely correct.  See e.g., this diff there:

```
152	 	            strport = 'tcp:%s:interface=%s'%(port, address) 
 	161	            strport = 'tcp:%s:interface=%s'%(port, interface) 
```
Here strport gets passed on to twisted and has "interface=" in it.

<a id='comment:13'></a>I've uploaded an improved version of the micro-patch.

Now I understand `address`. If you do something like

```
notebook(address='123.456.1.2', subnets=['123.456.0.0/16'])
```
(which, yes, I know is silly), then nothing we do with `subnets` will allow access via the loopback interface, since Twisted is simply not listening there. So getting denied access via loopback with the above is correct behavior. OTOH, with

```
notebook(address='', subnets=['123.456.0.0/16'])
```
I think it's more reasonable to put our own "127.0.0.0/8" into `subnets`, since the user did implicitly ask for Twisted to listen on the loopback interface.

I see that [Debian puts 127.0.1.1](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/reference/ch05.en.html#_the_hostname_resolution) into /etc/hosts. On my machine, that has the effect of having "localhost" resolve to 127.0.0.1, and "klee" resolve to 127.0.1.1. So we should definitely support the whole 127.*.*.* range.

Now that I understand the address/interface keyword, I'm putting your patches back to positive review. I also think we should allow 127.0.0.0/8; what do you think of my patch? Should the help text be modified to match the code?
