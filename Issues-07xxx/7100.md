A rounding error causes an issue in `vectors_by_length()`. The square root of a very tiny negative number (which should be rounded to zero) is computed, creating a symbolic imaginary expression which floor can't round to a nearest integer (e.g. `floor(2.0 + 1.49011611938e-08*I)` below).

Replying to [@mwhansen](#comment%3A1):
> I changed it to take the abs of Z, but I don't know if this goes the right way for the bounds.  Someone familiar with the algorithm should check this.  All tests do pass.

Actually, this is wrong:

```
Q = QuadraticForm(ZZ, 4, [1,1,1,1, 1,0,0, 1,0, 1]) 
sage: map(len, Q.vectors_by_length(2)) 
[1, 12, 11]
```
Because it's missing one of the vectors of norm 2 (namely `[0, -1, 0, -1]`) due to roundoff errors.

The way to fix this is to use a bound for searching which is an epsilon larger than an integer --- enough to cover the roundoff errors. Pari uses `1e-6` for this epsilon.

I'll post a patch in a moment.
