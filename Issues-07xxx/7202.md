<a id='comment:3'></a>Can you test this again on 4.2?  Reasons follow.

This works fine on my OSX 10.4 G4 PPC with 4.1.2.rc2 with #6642 also loaded.  Namely:

```
sage: var('Q')Q
sage: solve(Q*sqrt(Q^2+2)-1,Q)[Q == 1/sqrt(Q^2 + 2)]
sage: solve(Q*sqrt(Q^2+2)-1,Q,to_poly_solve=True)
[Q == -1/sqrt(-sqrt(2) + 1), Q == 1/sqrt(-sqrt(2) + 1), Q == -1/sqrt(sqrt(2) + 1), Q == 1/sqrt(sqrt(2) + 1)]
sage:  K.<a> = NumberField(x^5-x+1, embedding=-1)
sage: SR(a)
-1.1673040153
```
Note that the behavior has changed since #6642, because using to_poly_solve as a default meant that we didn't always get multiplicities, so now it is an option.   Also note that in the ONE case above, out of many many new correct solutions, we get two spurious ones - this is fixed in Maxima CVS, though, so when the new one comes out in December (probably) we can upgrade and fix that.

Anyway, I think it is much more likely that this build which was tested for some reason had something patched which asked for to_poly_solve to be used but didn't have to_poly_solver loaded by Maxima, as this is precisely the error message which would come out of that.  However, #6642 has both in Sage since 4.2.alpha0, so I don't think this should be a problem any more.
