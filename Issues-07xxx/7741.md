Given a symbolic expression which is a rational fraction sage refuse to convert it to a element of the Field of rational fraction:

```
hivert@boxen:~$ sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: fr = (1+x)/(1+x+x^2)
sage: Fld = FractionField(PolynomialRing(QQ,x))
sage: Fld(fr)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1181, 0))

| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |

[...]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.pyc in _element_constructor_(self, x, check, is_gen, construct, **kwds)
    304                 x = x.numerator() * x.denominator().inverse_of_unit()
    305             else:
--> 306                 raise TypeError, "denominator must be a unit"
    307
    308         elif isinstance(x, pari_gen):

TypeError: denominator must be a unit
```

It seems that it needs to convert is to a polynomial. Of course if one convert numerator and denominator separately everything is Ok:

```
sage: Fld((1+x))/(1+x+x^2)
(x + 1)/(x^2 + x + 1)
```

I'm not sure about which component should be selected... Is it algebra, calculus or coercion...

Is this really preferable to `denominator == 1`?

Actually, the "is 1" was intentional, as I wasn't thinking of taking that path if the user passed in a ring element (as opposed to the default value) and didn't want to make the default value None and handle it everywhere. In retrospect, I think it's fine for it to be equal to 1.
