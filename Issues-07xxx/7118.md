Since quaddouble was deprecated a year ago, and voted out, we should finally actually remove it.  This is motivated also by us getting numerous build failure reports that involve quaddouble lately.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/7118

```
oh, your own failure is in the pickle jar.
[2:06pm] williamstein:
That requires manually removing a pickle from the pickle jar.
[2:07pm] williamstein:
There is a quaddouble pickle in there.
[2:07pm] williamstein:
Notice that the doctest failure is in the message about how many pickles there are.
[2:07pm] williamstein:
so that's fine.
[2:07pm] williamstein:
In my tree i've removed that.
[2:07pm] williamstein:
that = 1 pickle

14:09 < williamstein> you have to remove a file from the tarball in
                      data/extcode/pickle_jar
14:09 < williamstein> it's the one with "rqdf" in its name, I think.
14:09 < williamstein> then you remake the tarball.

Applied patches in this order to Sage 4.1.2.rc0:

1. `trac_7118.patch`
2. `trac_7118-part2.patch`
 
Then uncompressed the file `SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/pickle_jar/pickle_jar.tar.bz2` and removed the following files from the directory `SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/pickle_jar/pickle_jar`:

1. `_type__sage_rings_real_rqdf_QuadDoubleElement__.sobj`
2. `_type__sage_rings_real_rqdf_QuadDoubleElement__.txt`
 
With these files removed, the directory `SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/pickle_jar/pickle_jar` is compressed into a tarball again and replaced the previous version of the same tarball. From Mercurial's point of view, this would result in a change to a file it tracks, i.e. the pickle_jar.tar.bz2 has changed and all changes should be checked in. Now edit the file `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install` to comment out the line related to quaddouble. The commented lines should be:

```
# See ticket #7118: remove quaddouble from sage                                 
# QUADDOUBLE=`$newest quaddouble`                                               
# export QUADDOUBLE
```
The file `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install` is not tracked by Mercurial, so no need to check in changes. Also, edit the file `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/deps` to comment out all lines related to quaddouble. The commented lines should be:

```
# See ticket #7118: remove quaddouble from sage
# $(INST)/$(QUADDOUBLE): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(MPIR) $(INST)/$(MPFR)
#       $(SAGE_SPKG) $(QUADDOUBLE) 2>&1

                  # $(INST)/$(QUADDOUBLE) \
```
This file is also not tracked by Mercurial, so no need to check in changes. Finally, remove the package quaddouble-2.2.p9.spkg from the directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard` of standard Sage packages. With these changes, I made a new source tarball called "sage-4.1.2.rc1-7118-quaddouble". After unpacking that tarball and compiling from scratch, I got the following error.

Please email sage-devel http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel
explaining the problem and send the relevant part of
of /scratch/mvngu/release/sandbox/sage-4.1.2.rc1-7118-quaddouble/install.log.  Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
/scratch/mvngu/release/sandbox/sage-4.1.2.rc1-7118-quaddouble/spkg/build/sage-4.1.2.rc1-7118-quaddouble and type 'make'.
Instead type "/scratch/mvngu/release/sandbox/sage-4.1.2.rc1-7118-quaddouble/sage -sh"
in order to set all environment variables correctly, then cd to
/scratch/mvngu/release/sandbox/sage-4.1.2.rc1-7118-quaddouble/spkg/build/sage-4.1.2.rc1-7118-quaddouble
(When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.)

23:35 < mvngu> williamstein: Any ideas about the error I reported at #7118 (remove quaddouble)?
23:40 < williamstein> wow, I can't belive the pickle jar is under revision control -- that's stupid.
23:41 < williamstein> but that is orthogonal.
23:41 < williamstein> maybe you made a typo when editing module_list.py?
23:42 < williamstein> wait, that was my patch.
23:42 < mvngu> williamstein: I didn't touch module_list.py
23:42 < williamstein> hmm.
23:42 < williamstein> i'll post my deps file.
23:42 < williamstein> maybe there is a typo ther.e
23:43 < williamstein> the error you get suggests a messed up deps file.
23:44 < williamstein> http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/7118/deps
23:45 < williamstein> my wife just decided to stay overnight at her friends house, since they are having so much fun... so
23:45 < williamstein> sounds like a good night for a Sage all nighter for me!
23:46 < williamstein> 3 new sagenb users in the last few minutes...
23:47 < williamstein> mvngu -- thanks again for looking at the #7118!
23:49 < mvngu> williamstein: A diff of the original deps vs. your changed deps... this suggests that I should really delete lines relating to quaddouble, instead of commenting them out.
23:49 < williamstein> You should try that.
23:50 < mvngu> trying now...

I wanted to give the ticket a positive after writing up my test results on various platforms. But my mind at the time was more focused on my thesis, so I didn't actually change the status to "positive review". I apologize for the confusion. Now the status is positive review, and the ticket can be closed as fixed.
