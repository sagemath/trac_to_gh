```
In the extcode spkg, pari/dokchitser/testall uses bashisms but has a /bin/sh #! line:

#!/bin/sh
echo "\\r ex-bsw" | sage -gp
echo "\\r ex-chgen" | sage -gp

We should change the #! line to

#!/bin/bash

I think the

```

#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

(from memory, so might not be right)

is better, as bash is not always installed in /bin

```
bash-2.04$ uname -a
