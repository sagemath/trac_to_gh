Several examples:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x)
sage: K.ideal(5)
Fractional ideal (5)
sage: QQ.ideal(5)
Principal ideal (1) of Rational Field
sage: QQ.number_field().ideal(5)
Principal ideal (1) of Rational Field
```

```
K = QQ
I = K.ideal(7)
```

This creates ideal that does not have the functions I.denominator, I.numerator, I.prime_ideals() ... which a fractional ideal in a number field should have

```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+2)
I = K.ideal(7)
```

Similarly, QQ.places() is not implemented; it should return the one infinite place for Q. Although there seems to be QQ.embeddings().

```
QQ.places()
```

<a id='comment:13'></a>-1 for closing. I think[comment:11](#comment%3A11) discloses a serious problem, though not exactly what is emphasized in the ticket description.  Number fields are rings:

```

Thus, the `ideal` method of a number field needs to return an ideal of `self` (not an ideal of some subring of `self`), because that is what is expected by the `ideal` method of a `Ring`. Otherwise, well-written code involving rings will be buggy.

<a id='comment:15'></a>I think I can live with the practical effect of the implementation of `is_prime` on number field elements, but note that its documentation says:

```
        Is ``self`` a prime element?

        A *prime* element is a non-zero, non-unit element `p` such that,
        whenever `p` divides `ab` for some `a` and `b`, then `p`
        divides `a` or `p` divides `b`.
...
        In fields, an element is never prime::
...
```
so its documentation directly contradicts its behaviour. This is due to the fact that the method is inherited from `Ring`, but the `ideal` protocol is not compatibly implemented. That obviously needs fixing. In this case, it probably means equipping number field elements with a fresh implementation of `is_prime` with appropriate doc.

Reassigning this ticket to a milestone, because having documentation directly contradict behaviour is obviously something that not just generic "low priority" or "not a bug".
