This patch is *totally unacceptable* as is.  The problem is this:

(1) Turn off your internet connection, then

(2) Try doing "sage -python setup.py install", and you get

```
...
Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple/zope.testbrowser/
Download error: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known -- Some packages may not be found!
Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple/zope.testbrowser/
Download error: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known -- Some packages may not be found!
Couldn't find index page for 'zope.testbrowser' (maybe misspelled?)
Scanning index of all packages (this may take a while)
Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple/
Download error: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known -- Some packages may not be found!
No local packages or download links found for zope.testbrowser>=3.7.0a1
error: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('zope.testbrowser>=3.7.0a1')
```

Now imagine that you're building Sage from source on an airplane, or while camping, or working at a job which for security reasons doesn't allow outside network connections.

Options:

(1) Get zope.testbrowser included as a standard sage package. 

(2) Make the dependency on zope.testbrowser optional.

Please correct me if I am mistaken, though.

No, that should be fine, and is probably a good idea.     Can you post your edited spkg-dist file?
