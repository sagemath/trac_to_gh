The problem seems to be that the auto-indent code "fires" too often, e.g., when the shift key comes up before the enter key.  The [attachment:trac_7756-extra_text_shift_enter.patch patch] should fix this in Cr, FF, S, and O.  If it does not, please let me know!

Note: I've extracted the patch here from the patch at #7666.
