The problem seems to be that the auto-indent code "fires" too often, e.g., when the shift key comes up before the enter key.  The [patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7756/trac_7756-extra_text_shift_enter.patch) should fix this in Cr, FF, S, and O.  If it does not, please let me know!

Note: I've extracted the patch here from the patch at #7666.
