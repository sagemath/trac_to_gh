Attachment [trac_7756-extra_text_shift_enter.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket7756/trac_7756-extra_text_shift_enter.patch) by @qed777 created at 2009-12-24 06:32:00

The problem seems to be that the auto-indent code "fires" too often, e.g., when the shift key comes up before the enter key.  The [attachment:trac_7756-extra_text_shift_enter.patch patch] should fix this in Cr, FF, S, and O.  If it does not, please let me know!

Note: I've extracted the patch here from the patch at #7666.
