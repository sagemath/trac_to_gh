Worksheets in the Sage notebook can contain live `interact`-ive cells, which may make it easier to understand how an object's properties depend on a set of parameters.  Please visit the Sage Wiki to view [some examples](http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact).  Currently, however, `interact` cells do not work in published worksheets.

To enable live published `interact`s, apply the patch

* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/7908/trac_7908-pub_interact_c11.patch

**Note:** it depends on #7666 and its dependencies.  **Or** use this spkg with 4.3.1.alpha2:

* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/7908/sagenb-0.5-7908c11.spkg

The chief leftover tasks, I think, are to

* Allow only *interactive* public cells to be evaluated, e.g., someone `evaluate_cell` in a JS console.
* Limit the use of `sage_eval` in published `interact`s.
* Enforce the `'doc_pool_size'` (and a `'pub_pool_size'`) but avoid any wrap-around problems. We could add checks in `*_eval` and `*_cell_update`, return an updated `worksheet_filename`, and/or send the user a message (e.g., to reload the page or wait a few minutes and try evaluating again).

I'm not sure about how to set *globally* just one cookie for anonymous visitors.  Setting it `twist.AnonymousToplevel.render` works only for those who visit the login page.  `twist.PublicWorksheet.render` could be a good place.  But it seems we don't actually *use* anonymous cookies, so we could just not generate them at all (see `guard.MySessionWrapper.requestAnonymousAuthentication`).

In particular, we may need to adjust the timing or make it an option.  A `div`'s 'ready' event fires too early.  `DIV`s don't have 'load' events, unfortunately.

It probably did, given the changes to the queue --- last time I checked, what I posted did work, at least for me.  I would really like this reviewed, given that it's large, I don't want to keep rebasing it (this was transplanted from #6855), implements some potentially useful changes (e.g., JSON-encoding for server-to-client data), and because it's important for #6855.  I'll try to rebase this later this week, after some dust has settled.  Given the many other (and quite welcome) changes afoot right now and the fact that I'm not in Seattle, it doesn't seem practical to this now.
