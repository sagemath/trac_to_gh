<a id='comment:3'></a>http://dcsmail.anu.edu.au/pipermail/nauty-list/2009-November/000546.html

shows Brendan's reply to Jason as well as possible work-arounds. 

Using -ansi did not work reporting same problem if put in CFLAGS and gave other errors (below) if put in CC definition:

```
...
gcc -ansi -o genrang -O4  genrang.c nausparse.o \
                gtools.o nautil.o naututil.o naugraph.o rng.o
genrang.c: In function ‘main’:
genrang.c:405: error: storage size of ‘nauty_tz’ isn’t known
make: *** [genrang] Error 1

```

however, his other suggestion, did make a compile work:

```
sed -i 's/getline/readline/g' gtools-h.in
sed -i 's/getline/readline/g' shortg.c
sed -i 's/getline/readline/g' gtools.c
./configure
make
```

I'm not sure how to test that this doesn't brake anything within sage though.
