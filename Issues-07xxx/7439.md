I confirmed that this is a problem with the latest nauty 2.4 as well.
I've sent a message to the nauty mailing list.

shows Brendan's reply to Jason as well as possible work-arounds. 

Using -ansi did not work reporting same problem if put in CFLAGS and gave other errors (below) if put in CC definition:

```
...
gcc -ansi -o genrang -O4  genrang.c nausparse.o \
                gtools.o nautil.o naututil.o naugraph.o rng.o
genrang.c: In function ‘main’:
genrang.c:405: error: storage size of ‘nauty_tz’ isn’t known
make: *** [genrang] Error 1

```

however, his other suggestion, did make a compile work:

```
sed -i 's/getline/readline/g' gtools-h.in
sed -i 's/getline/readline/g' shortg.c
sed -i 's/getline/readline/g' gtools.c
./configure
make
```

I'm not sure how to test that this doesn't brake anything within sage though.

Jason, sorry for the horrible spkg, this was my first spkg... Your new spkg works like a charm
(tested under Fedora 12). I did not run the doctests (do they test optional packages) but the
following did work:

```
sage: graph_list = graphs.nauty_geng("-q 3")
sage: len(graph_list)
4
```
(I've removed my name as author since the new spkg is your work.)

Oh, I thought it was my fault, as I did the original nauty spkg, and there weren't nice guidelines back then.

Yes, but I don't know if there are any #optional doctests for nauty in the sage library.
