the ratpoints spkg builds an executable we just throw away.  On Cygwin it fails though changing the link order from

```
	    -lgmp -lm -lratpoints
	to
	    -lm -lratpoints -lgmp
```
would fix the problem.

The only change in the spkg package is:

```
-make
+make libratpoints.a
```

since this is all that is needed, it's +1 from me.

Here's an updated spkg

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/release/spkg/standard/ratpoints-2.1.2.p4.spkg

Changes from William's version include:

* Remove the junk files `spkg-install~` and `SPKG.txt~`.
* Make `spkg-install` executable using "`chmod +x spkg-install`".
* Use about 75 characters for each line in the file `SPKG.txt`. Any longer than that and it would be difficult to read on a standard terminal width, i.e. 80 characters wide.
