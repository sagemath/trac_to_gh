An "official" way to setup the basic bootstrap for building Sage is to execute the following in an extracted Sage source tarball from SAGE_ROOT:

```
cd spkg/; ./install scripts
```

Doing so works, but unfortunately also results in:

```
...
python: can't open file '/scratch/wstein/build/x/sage-4.3.rc0/devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

Fix this.  Get rid of this error message.

Currently, `cd build; ./install scripts` doesn't work and it certainly isn't an "official" way to bootstrap anything.
