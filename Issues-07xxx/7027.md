f2c ignores CC, CFLAGS, and MAKE variables:
On sage.math using

```
  CC=clang
  CFLAGS=-O3
  MAKE="make -j6"

Also, there are left over files from development on OSX:

```

Finally, there are unnecessary files in the patch directory, we only need one of the patches, and neither of the makefiles.

Ok, updated with $MAKE and $CFLAGS.

There was a silly patch whose entire purpose was to make the f2c makefile respect global cflags, of course the spkg-install wouldn't respect those cflags :-/. I am now just passing the cflags at the end of the make line in spkg-install, rather than patching the makefile.

Thanks for taking the time to do this, I didn't check the old SPKG for those files.

I've compared the p2 and p3 `src` directories after patching; they look equivalent given the `spkg-install` changes.

To test the original issue, I've replaced `$CC` and `$CFLAGS` in both makefiles with junk. If I don't set my environment variables, the build crashes. If I export a real `$CC` and `$CFLAGS`, it builds fine.

I built with `MAKE=make -j40` with no problems.

If we want to go this route, we'll have to set the fuzz factor. Otherwise, GNU patch, at least, will happily return success:

```
$ emacs makefile
$ patch -p0 < ../../patches/libf2c.makefile.patch 
patching file makefile
Hunk #1 succeeded at 73 with fuzz 1 (offset 3 lines).
$ echo $?
0
```

Using `--fuzz=0` should catch that, but will still miss large offsets. I don't know if there's a way to catch those... `patch` is returning success here even for huge offsets:

```
$ patch --fuzz=0 -p0 < ../../patches/libf2c.makefile.patch 
patching file makefile
Hunk #1 succeeded at 111 (offset 41 lines).
$ echo $?
0
```

Whoever is upgrading the package would hopefully check for this, but maybe there's a smarter way that I haven't found yet.

Anyway, these are back =)

```
$ sage -hg status
? ._.hg
? ._.hgignore
? ._SPKG.txt
? ._spkg-install
? patches/._f2c.makefile

Ok, new version, got rid of the `._` files again (which was my bad, since I restarted off of the p2 package). I've also made some more changes to spkg-install, added some comments, moved some stuff around, made it more uniform, as well as make a libf2c directory in patches, just to make it easy to add patches in the future, if they are ever needed.

This one looks good.

For future reference, we can probably drop the `-g` (debug) flag, and shouldn't install `libf2c` if building `f2c` fails, but those are minor and unrelated to this ticket.

Those are pretty innocent and not a big deal in my opinion.  I have never seen a patch applied wrongly because of this.

CC needs quoting:

```
$MAKE CC="$CC" CFLAGS="${CFLAGS}" 
```

Also, it would be good to mention the ticket number in `SPKG.txt`.
