f2c ignores CC, CFLAGS, and MAKE variables:
On sage.math using

Also, there are left over files from development on OSX:

Finally, there are unnecessary files in the patch directory, we only need one of the patches, and neither of the makefiles.

Thanks for taking the time to do this, I didn't check the old SPKG for those files.

I've compared the p2 and p3 `src` directories after patching; they look equivalent given the `spkg-install` changes.

To test the original issue, I've replaced `$CC` and `$CFLAGS` in both makefiles with junk. If I don't set my environment variables, the build crashes. If I export a real `$CC` and `$CFLAGS`, it builds fine.

I built with `MAKE=make -j40` with no problems.

If we want to go this route, we'll have to set the fuzz factor. Otherwise, GNU patch, at least, will happily return success:

```
$ emacs makefile
$ patch -p0 < ../../patches/libf2c.makefile.patch 
patching file makefile
Hunk #1 succeeded at 73 with fuzz 1 (offset 3 lines).
$ echo $?
0
```

Using `--fuzz=0` should catch that, but will still miss large offsets. I don't know if there's a way to catch those... `patch` is returning success here even for huge offsets:

```
$ patch --fuzz=0 -p0 < ../../patches/libf2c.makefile.patch 
patching file makefile
Hunk #1 succeeded at 111 (offset 41 lines).
$ echo $?
0
```

Whoever is upgrading the package would hopefully check for this, but maybe there's a smarter way that I haven't found yet.

Anyway, these are back =)

```
$ sage -hg status
? ._.hg
? ._.hgignore
? ._SPKG.txt
? ._spkg-install
? patches/._f2c.makefile
```
