f2c ignores CC, CFLAGS, and MAKE variables:
On sage.math using

```
  CC=clang
  CFLAGS=-O3
  MAKE="make -j6"
```

Also, there are left over files from development on OSX:

```
hg status
? ._.hg
? ._.hgignore
? ._SPKG.txt
? ._spkg-install
? patches/._f2c.makefile
```

Finally, there are unnecessary files in the patch directory, we only need one of the patches, and neither of the makefiles.

Nope, but that wasn't the initial goal of this ticket, that said I've changed the purpose/description.

Thanks for taking the time to do this, I didn't check the old SPKG for those files.

I've compared the p2 and p3 `src` directories after patching; they look equivalent given the `spkg-install` changes.

To test the original issue, I've replaced `$CC` and `$CFLAGS` in both makefiles with junk. If I don't set my environment variables, the build crashes. If I export a real `$CC` and `$CFLAGS`, it builds fine.

I built with `MAKE=make -j40` with no problems.

If we want to go this route, we'll have to set the fuzz factor. Otherwise, GNU patch, at least, will happily return success:

```
$ emacs makefile
$ patch -p0 < ../../patches/libf2c.makefile.patch 
patching file makefile
Hunk #1 succeeded at 73 with fuzz 1 (offset 3 lines).
$ echo $?
0
```

Using `--fuzz=0` should catch that, but will still miss large offsets. I don't know if there's a way to catch those... `patch` is returning success here even for huge offsets:

```
$ patch --fuzz=0 -p0 < ../../patches/libf2c.makefile.patch 
patching file makefile
Hunk #1 succeeded at 111 (offset 41 lines).
$ echo $?
0
```

Whoever is upgrading the package would hopefully check for this, but maybe there's a smarter way that I haven't found yet.

Anyway, these are back =)

$ sage -hg status
