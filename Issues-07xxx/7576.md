This patch makes several improvements to the prove_BSD function:

- better handling of when the Heegner index is computed

- speeds up several cases and makes some other cases possible

- uses results from Dimitar Jetchev's thesis when applying the Kolyvagin bound

REFEREE REPORT:

1. For proper Sphinx the indention has to be consistent. Your docstring is wrong:

```
        INPUT:

            - ``verbosity`` - int, how much information about the proof to print.

                - 0 - print nothing
                - 1 - print sketch of proof
                - 2 - print information about remaining primes

            - ``simon`` - bool (default False), whether to use two_descent or
              simon_two_descent at p=2.

            -  ``proof`` - bool or None (default: None, see
              proof.elliptic_curve or sage.structure.proof). If False, this
              function just immediately returns the empty list.

            - ``secs_hi`` - how many seconds to try to compute the Heegner index
              before switching over to trying to compute the Heegner index bound.
              (Rank 0 only!)
```

E.g., the proof one should be:

```
            - ``proof`` - bool or None (default: None, see
              proof.elliptic_curve or sage.structure.proof). If False, this
              function just immediately returns the empty list.
```

I find it useful to try making a simple function with the given docstring in the notebook, then evaluate and introspect that, to see what Sphinx does.


2. <code>\`\`secs_hi\`\` - how many seconds to try to compute the Heegner index</code> -- change "how many seconds" to "maximum number of seconds", which is more precise. 

3. Add something to the verbose output when secs_hi interrupts a calculation.  

4. Once you have 3, add an example that illustrates it.   

5. Unfortunately, evidently hitting control-c doesn't work for some reason:

```
for E in cremona_optimal_curves([1..1000]):
     if E.rank() == 0:
         print E.label(), E.prove_BSD(secs_hi=0.1, verbosity=1)

....
<try hitting control-c -- ignored. :-(>
....
```         
This might be related to how you setup the alarm.  It's hard to tell.

6. The multiple uses of D here seems potentially confusing:

```
        5993	                for D in self.heegner_discriminants_list(100): 
 	5994	                    heegner_primes, D = self.heegner_index_bound(D, verbose=False) 
 	5995	                    if isinstance(heegner_primes, list): 
 	5996	                        break 
```

Also, the above hard-coded 100 makes me a little nervous.  What happens if we go through the whole list of 100 and don't find one that works?  (Highly unlikely in practice, of course.) Then we think the last one we looked at does work.  Not good.  

7. What is the point of this line?:

```
6157	                print '    ord_p(#Sha) >= 0' 
```
It's trivial that `ord_p(#Sha)>=0`, since `#Sha` is an integer, and `ord_p(n)>=0` for any integer n. 

8. In the docstring you should give precise references for the results you're using later.  E.g., instead of just "by Jetchev", you could explain that this means "by Theorem xyz" in his Compositio paper xxx.  "by Mazur" you mean theorem blah of blah, etc.   This could just go in the docstring, not the actual output (your choice).

I read that Robert has implemented a fast 2-isogeny descent. Can this compute the honest 2-Selmer group of a given elliptic curve?

I thought these bugs might be arising from the fact that mwrank does not always do this.

With 438e, it erroneously computes the rank bound to be 1, while it should be 0.

With 960d the optimal curve has sha of order 4 while sha is trivial for an isogenous 
curve, so mwrank returns a rank bound of 0.
