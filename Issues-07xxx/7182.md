gfan will not build on my HP-UX box, as the 'make' program does not like a 'makefile'. Perhaps the gfan developer would like to fix this, but from the point of view of Sage, it is easier we ensure that 'make' is GNU make (see #7181), since on Solaris we find Sun's 'make' has no chance at all of building Sage.
