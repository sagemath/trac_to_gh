This change has been discussed and approved on sage-devel and sage-combinat-devel. I went through the current patch and it looks good. This is a conditional positive review, pending a rebase on 4.3.1 (if at all needed), a recheck of all tests passing, and two little details:

- Renaming the patch to trac_7938_swap_term_and_monomial-jb.patch
- Adding a short description on top of it; say something like: "#7938: swap term and monomial in category and combinat code for consistency with the rest of sage"

Thanks Jason!
