- Renaming the patch to trac_7938_swap_term_and_monomial-jb.patch
- Adding a short description on top of it; say something like: "#7938: swap term and monomial in category and combinat code for consistency with the rest of sage"

Thanks Jason!

The patch called 'trac_7938_...' is all that should be applied.  In response to Nicolas' comments:
* Rename patch: done
* Add description: done
* Remove spurious change to affine.py: done, but see #7978
* Add default value for coeff in self.term: done
* Add optional coeff argument to monomial: Not done yet. I'll look more (but maybe not much more) at this later.
