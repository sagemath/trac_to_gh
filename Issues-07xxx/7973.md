You're concatenating three different patches into one file. That would result in failures when applying the resulting one file (with the three patches):

```
[mvngu@mod sage-main]$ hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7973/13639.patch.gz && hg qpush
adding 13639.patch to series file
applying 13639.patch

Hunk #2 FAILED at 58
2 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file doc/en/developer/producing_patches.rst.rej
patching file doc/en/developer/producing_patches.rst
Hunk #1 FAILED at 21
Hunk #2 FAILED at 58
2 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file doc/en/developer/producing_patches.rst.rej
patch failed, unable to continue (try -v)
patch failed, rejects left in working dir
errors during apply, please fix and refresh 13639.patch
```
Looking at the attachment [13639.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7973/13639.patch.gz) more closely, I see that the three patches only touch the file

```
doc/en/developer/producing_patches.rst
```
I have split the three different patches into three different files and attached them to this ticket for reference. Applying any one of them individually is OK. But if I then first apply one and then any of the other two, I'd get hunk failures. So of all the changes in your original attachment, which set of changes did you intend to submit for review? Also, one minor nit-pick: please reference the ticket number in your commit message. The general format of a commit message should be:

```
trac xxxx: <your-commit-message-here>
```
where "xxxx" is the ticket number.

Since Sage is written in Python, "Cardinal Fang" seems completely appropriate. :)

That change was a direct request from wstein, who is, apparently, the anti-Python(Monty). :-)

Replying to [mvngu](#comment%3A5):
> I'm OK with the proposed changes in [13639.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7973/13639.2.patch.gz). I have attached a reviewer patch [trac_7973-reviewer.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7973/trac_7973-reviewer.patch.gz), which fixes some typos. The attachment [13639.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7973/13639.2.patch.gz) contains some tab characters, which don't look good when you view the HTML version of the Developer's Guide, i.e. only the corresponding section in the Developer's Guide. Try to avoid tabs as much as possible in patches. If you're OK with the reviewer patch, then the whole ticket gets a positive review.

All those reviewer changes are spot on.  Thanks!  It's good to go for me.

Sage isn't Python, and I think it's funner in math software to have references to math-related items.  The vast majority of potential Sage users and developers will have no clue about these Python in jokes, and I don't want to confuse them.
