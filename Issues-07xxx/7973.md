This is not the same as 6987 which suggests moving the entire section to a different location in the manual.  That might be a good idea, but this is a revision of the actual content, not a change in the location.

Looking at the attachment [13639.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7973/13639.patch.gz) more closely, I see that the three patches only touch the file

```
I have split the three different patches into three different files and attached them to this ticket for reference. Applying any one of them individually is OK. But if I then first apply one and then any of the other two, I'd get hunk failures. So of all the changes in your original attachment, which set of changes did you intend to submit for review? Also, one minor nit-pick: please reference the ticket number in your commit message. The general format of a commit message should be:

```
trac xxxx: <your-commit-message-here>
```
where "xxxx" is the ticket number.

Now wait, what's wrong with "Cardinal Fang"?  According to [the Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/appetite.html), 

```
Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!
```
Since Sage is written in Python, "Cardinal Fang" seems completely appropriate. :)
