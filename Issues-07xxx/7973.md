**Attachment:** [13639_03.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7973/13639_03.patch)

You're concatenating three different patches into one file. That would result in failures when applying the resulting one file (with the three patches):

```
[mvngu@mod sage-main]$ hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7973/13639.patch && hg qpush
adding 13639.patch to series file
applying 13639.patch
patching file doc/en/developer/producing_patches.rst
Hunk #1 FAILED at 21
Hunk #2 FAILED at 58
2 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file doc/en/developer/producing_patches.rst.rej
patching file doc/en/developer/producing_patches.rst
Hunk #1 FAILED at 21
Hunk #2 FAILED at 58
2 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file doc/en/developer/producing_patches.rst.rej
patch failed, unable to continue (try -v)
patch failed, rejects left in working dir
errors during apply, please fix and refresh 13639.patch
```
Looking at the attachment [13639.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7973/13639.patch) more closely, I see that the three patches only touch the file

```
doc/en/developer/producing_patches.rst
```
I have split the three different patches into three different files and attached them to this ticket for reference. Applying any one of them individually is OK. But if I then first apply one and then any of the other two, I'd get hunk failures. So of all the changes in your original attachment, which set of changes did you intend to submit for review? Also, one minor nit-pick: please reference the ticket number in your commit message. The general format of a commit message should be:

```
trac xxxx: <your-commit-message-here>
```
where "xxxx" is the ticket number.

Now wait, what's wrong with "Cardinal Fang"?  According to [the Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/appetite.html), 

```
Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!
```
Since Sage is written in Python, "Cardinal Fang" seems completely appropriate. :)
