This is not the same as 6987 which suggests moving the entire section to a different location in the manual.  That might be a good idea, but this is a revision of the actual content, not a change in the location.  

And one probably shouldn't perform the location changes requested in 6987 without first applying the above patch to the actual text.

I have split the three different patches into three different files and attached them to this ticket for reference. Applying any one of them individually is OK. But if I then first apply one and then any of the other two, I'd get hunk failures. So of all the changes in your original attachment, which set of changes did you intend to submit for review? Also, one minor nit-pick: please reference the ticket number in your commit message. The general format of a commit message should be:

```
trac xxxx: <your-commit-message-here>

where "xxxx" is the ticket number.

Replying to [mvngu](#comment%3A5):
> I'm OK with the proposed changes in [13639.2.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/7973/13639.2.patch). I have attached a reviewer patch [trac_7973-reviewer.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/7973/trac_7973-reviewer.patch), which fixes some typos. The attachment [13639.2.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/7973/13639.2.patch) contains some tab characters, which don't look good when you view the HTML version of the Developer's Guide, i.e. only the corresponding section in the Developer's Guide. Try to avoid tabs as much as possible in patches. If you're OK with the reviewer patch, then the whole ticket gets a positive review.


All those reviewer changes are spot on.  Thanks!  It's good to go for me.

Sage isn't Python, and I think it's funner in math software to have references to math-related items.  The vast majority of potential Sage users and developers will have no clue about these Python in jokes, and I don't want to confuse them.
