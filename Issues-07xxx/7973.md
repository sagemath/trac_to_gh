This is not the same as 6987 which suggests moving the entire section to a different location in the manual.  That might be a good idea, but this is a revision of the actual content, not a change in the location.  

And one probably shouldn't perform the location changes requested in 6987 without first applying the above patch to the actual text.

You're concatenating three different patches into one file. That would result in failures when applying the resulting one file (with the three patches):

Looking at the attachment [13639.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/7973/13639.patch) more closely, I see that the three patches only touch the file

I have split the three different patches into three different files and attached them to this ticket for reference. Applying any one of them individually is OK. But if I then first apply one and then any of the other two, I'd get hunk failures. So of all the changes in your original attachment, which set of changes did you intend to submit for review? Also, one minor nit-pick: please reference the ticket number in your commit message. The general format of a commit message should be:

```
trac xxxx: <your-commit-message-here>
```
where "xxxx" is the ticket number.

Since Sage is written in Python, "Cardinal Fang" seems completely appropriate. :)
