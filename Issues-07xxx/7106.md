The new parenthesis matching keyboard shortcut ctrl-0 introduced in
#3646 was not documented in the doc string of config.py. Once all
information is in the doc string, I would suggest to shorten the help
page text a little.

I apologize, if I'm misinterpreting your question.  The changes to

* `config.py` should appear on ["this" page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/notebook.html).
* `tutorial.py` should appear on the main notebook help page, e.g., http://www.sagenb.org/help/ .

To rebuild the docs after applying a patch to the `sage` repository (i.e., the main Sage library), try, e.g.,

* `sage -b`
* `sage -docbuild reference html -j`
* Browse to `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/index.html`

Please see `sage -docbuild -H` for more options.  If/after #7367 merges, the post-patch procedure for the `sagenb` repository could be

* `cd sagenb-0.4/`
* `sage -python setup.py install`
* `sage -docbuild reference html -j`

Should we move `tutorial.notebook_help` to a HTML page or template?
