See also #5467 and #7915 (!).

These patches change the prompt detection/stripping and update doctests to cause no errors with Macaulay2 1.3.1.

Improvements/fixes achieved:
- examples in Macaulay2 documentation (which include input prompts) do not break the interaction with Sage;
- empty/whitespace/comment lines can be executed;
- multiline commands can be executed;
- stripping output prompts will not cut error messages if they occur (e.g. the first call "help Thing" currently shows some errors in Macaulay2);
- "macaulay2.restart()" does not print a useless variable name.

This is done by:
- changing input and input continuation prompts;
- starting with a big line number to make all output labels of the same width;
- making sure that only output labels and spaces are stripped from the output.

These patches make tickets #7882 and #7888 unnecessary.

I changed my mind about importance of "restart" command in the middle of the code after seeing a talk today. So the patch is rewritten to allow it everywhere. All doctests still pass with both patches applied.
