Currently, block_and_cut_vertices says that the vertex in a single-vertex graph is a cut vertex:

```
sage: Graph(1).blocks_and_cut_vertices()
([0], [0])
```

According to the definition of cut vertices given in the documentation of the function, a cut vertex, when removed, increases the connected components of the graph.  Either that documentation should be changed to mention a corner case, or (preferably), the above computation should look like:

```
sage: Graph(1).blocks_and_cut_vertices()
([0], [])
```

Here it is ! Actually the answer [0],[0] seemed deliberate in the code, but my tests with the patch applied did not show any error coming from the fix :-)
