From the docstring : 
A graph is a Gallai tree if and only if it is connected and its `2`-connected components are all isomorphic to complete graphs or odd cycles.

This patch also slightly touches the function is_clique, which was unnecessarily copying the whole graph 2 times :
* Firstly, using the subgraph method
* Secondly, using the to_simple method
