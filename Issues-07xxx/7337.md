It fails with 

```
  /home/mhansen/sage-4.2/spkg/build/gd-2.0.35.p2/src/gd_png.c:70: undefined reference to `_png_get_error_ptr'

  /home/mhansen/sage-4.2/spkg/build/gd-2.0.35.p2/src/gd_png.c:87: undefined reference to `_png_error'
  /home/mhansen/sage-4.2/local/lib/libgd.a(gd_png.o): In function `gdPngWriteData':

```

This can be fixed by adding png12 and z to the list of libraries needed when gd is present.

I'll post an spkg shortly.
