Positive review except there is no doctest to indicate that one can now integrate f(x)=x!  It works:

```
sage: integrate(f,x,0,1)
1/2
```
So maybe this should be put in somewhere in sage/calculus/calculus.py in tests, or wherever you think is most appropriate.

On the other hand, there is a doctest for the cause of the problem.
