NOTE:  I discovered that if I comment out the lines 

```
#from hashlib import sha1

    #from hashlib import sha1
    #raise ImportError

#    from sha import new as sha1

in jinja/loaders.py then `python setup.py build` doesn't segfault, though
installing does.  However, I can copy the build/lib*/jinja directory over to 
site-packages by hand and it seems to work.   

Similar remarks apply to Sphinx.
