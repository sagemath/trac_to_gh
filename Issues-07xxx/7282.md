NOTE:  I discovered that if I comment out the lines 

```
#from hashlib import sha1
#try:
    #from hashlib import sha1
    #raise ImportError
#except ImportError:
#    from sha import new as sha1
```
in jinja/loaders.py then `python setup.py build` doesn't segfault, though
installing does.  However, I can copy the build/lib*/jinja directory over to 
site-packages by hand and it seems to work.   

Similar remarks apply to Sphinx.

We really should try to make sure that there are no problems with hashlib since it's a very common module.

The problem occurs somewhere with the optional speedups extension.  We can (temporarily) work around this by doing 

```
python setup.py --without-speedups install
```

on Cygwin.
