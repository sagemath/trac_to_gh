From [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/b0d82d01bc1f123?tvc=2):

```
As of version 4.1.2.alpha2, the Sage tutorial has a section containing 
a guided tour of graph theory in Sage.  In principle, this is a good 
idea, but the execution is severely flawed: about 2/3 of the tour 
focuses on the methods "g.max_matching()", "g.edge_coloring()", and 
"g.vertex_coloring()".  There are no such methods in Sage.  (The 
relevant doctests were never executed because of the issue discussed 
at trac ticket #6572.)  Since the tutorial ought to be one of the 
first pieces of documentation people use, this situation is 
disastrous. 

I suggest that before we release 4.1.2, we delete this part of the 
tutorial until the file is fixed.  (Alternatively, we could delete 2/3 
of the file, but that might make it a bit short on substance.) 
```

Thanks for catching this; sorry for the bother!

We should probably reopen #6774 now, for when the functionality is merged into Sage.
