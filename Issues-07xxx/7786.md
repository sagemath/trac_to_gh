By idiomatic Jinja, I mean

* Inheritance instead of inclusion

* Arguments required are only the needed models to produce the required view [1]

This will make editing the templates easier, and will allow for a more consistent interface (by specifying base templates for each section).

I can only look at the patch right now, but I think these are much-needed and appreciated changes to SageNB.  I think we should make merging this ticket (plus its dependencies) a priority.  I'll try to start reviewing the patch soon.

As the merge nears, I'll rebase #7666 and its descendants, as necessary.

By the way, the dependency graph is *awesome*. You may want to put it in the wiki somewhere, for Sage Notebook development tools.

* Is `_topbar.sass` missing?  When compiling, I see

   If I comment out the `@import`, the generated `main.css` seems to be missing topbar directives.

<a id='comment:29'></a>
In V10, I replaced `$(document).ready()` in a few places with either synchronous evaluation or `$(window).load()` (in particular, `$(document).load()` does not always work).  The main reason is timing --- the "DOM ready" event can fire too early for certain notebook initializations.  For example, evaluate

```
import time
time.sleep(20)
print 'foo'
```
and reload the worksheet.  Published interacts are another, forthcoming example...

I noticed that `Worksheet.html_cell_list` in V9

* Referred to a non-existent template `published_worksheet.html`.
* Is really no longer used.  The lone remaining call, in `twist.py` sends refreshed HTML that `notebook_lib.js` ignores.

I've replaced the call with an empty string.  *However,* the main problem is that HTML for published worksheets is now no longer cached by the server.  Or am I mistaken?

I'll try to fix this in V11...
