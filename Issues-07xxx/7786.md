This will make editing the templates easier, and will allow for a more consistent interface (by specifying base templates for each section).

Or the same?  Anyway, possibilities for a completely different ticket:

* Remove `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` from `td.cell_number` for cells with no output.
* Put the green "cell is running" bar adjacent to the red "cell is not evaluated" line.  The latter is actually a border, but we could insert a fixed-width `div` element here.  We could make this a status-area for the whole cell (input + output), add a right-click menu (e.g., for select / insert / move / delete operations, etc.), an on-hover toolbar, etc.
