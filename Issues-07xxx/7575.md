In the original example (in this ticket's description), note that calling E.two_descent() produces output to the screen but returns nothing and stores nothing in E which was not there before.  E.gens() by default uses mwrank_shell, which does not allow any passing of parameters (see the TODO block in the docstring), not because it cannot be done but because we have not implemented it.  The non-default option mwrank_lib goes via creation of the associated mwrank_curve which also does not allow changing of the parameters.

What I suggest is that we use mwrank_lib by default;  that we allow passing of all the parameters which the two_descent function of an mwrank elliptic curve allows from all higher level functions which call mwrank (e.g. gens()) and that we use the enquiry functions provided by mwrank to find out how successful it has been:  it can give you a lower and upper bound for the rank, so all is well if they are equal and in any case can give you a number of gens equal to the lower bound.  The only difficulty would be with caching rank and gens -- probably best not to do so at all unless we have certainly found them.

Does this all make sense?  I think it would be much more helpful to have sample curves where things do not work well and sample code which does not go via a call to the (presumably complicated) function prove_BSD()!

This behaviour is supposed to be caught by mwrank C++ code, so that this can be detected gracefully by using the ok() function.

As we are planning to replace the pexpect interface entirely this will be dealt with.  (There is absolutely no reason to use the interactive interface when everything can be found from the library interface.)

> This behaviour is supposed to be caught by mwrank C++ code, so that this can be detected gracefully by using the ok() function.


On looking into it, I see that this will need a patch to the file src/qrank/mrank1.cc, since I just call abort() when I try to round to a long int and it overflows.  Instead I need to catch that properly.  (Pity C++ does not have the try/except functionality of python).

So this particular bug / behaviour needs to be flagged as "report upstream (done) and wait for a patch from upstream (on my todo list)".

The documentation for `EllipticCurve.gens` says:

```
HINT: If you would like to control the height bounds used in the
2-descent, first call the two_descent function with those height
bounds. However that function, while it displays a lot of output,
returns no values.
```

However, this doesn't work, because `EllipticCurve.gens` doesn't know about it:

```
sage: x,y=var('x,y')
sage: E = EllipticCurve(y^2 + x*y + y == x^3 - 10525529*x - 21714803524)
sage: E.two_descent(second_limit=11, verbose=False)
sage: E.gens()
*BOOM*
```

Despite:

```
sage: A = E.mwrank_curve()
sage: A.gens()
[[1737553736529419603224344006006032245457891558644991945121564365621L, -1605018042749306385493128932071874233128412498544999275367916849231954L, 2038538889602737161869943561394015059980551394212496529475951L]]

The 1st and 4th items in the TODO list are implemented in #8184 with a new spkg and subsequent patch,

I think that logically that patch should be reviewed first, and then this one will need so changes (since a lot of the same functions are affected).  I hope others (rlm in particular) will agree!  For that reason (only) I have switched this to "needs work".

I applied trac_7575.patch successfully to 4.3.2 after first applying everything from 
#8184, #8155 and  #8124 in that order.

The code looks good.  It's great now that we do not have to make embarrassing excuses for mwrank's incomplete output!

I only spotted one thing:  in a couple of places the docstring says that the default search bound is 16, whereas it is in fact 12.  (Certainly 12 is more sensible!)  That needs changing (trivial).  It might be a good idea to alert the user to how expensive (in time) adding one to the bound is, so that (for example) a bound of 20 could lead to the program never ending.

One other comment (to rlm):   when doing descent by 2-isogeny, when the second descent is used and the coefficients are large, it is a good idea to increase the decimal precision a lot (to 100 or 200 digits) because then the reduction of the second descent quartics is done much better.  Now, mwrank will not do that for you (though perhaps it should).  I suggest that when mwrank is used on curves with 2-torsion, we first call mwrank_set_precision(200).  This will not slow anything down (in fact the opposite) -- but that is not the case for 2-descent in general (no 2-torsion).  Perhaps we could do that on another ticket.

I tested the whole library with -long after applying this patch and the earlier ones on which it depends (as well as the new eclib spkg at #8184):  all pass!

I really hope that this sequence of 4 tickets can all be merged quickly into 4.3.3.

It reappears after `make ptestlong`, or anywhere I run a `sage -t` command that includes `ell_rational_field.py`.  Is it possible to save the file to a fixed location?

We could 

* Add a line to `.hgignore`.
* Not add a line to `MANIFEST.in`.

This should ensure the file is not included in a new `sage-*.spkg`.  But users might complain about the new file appearing elsewhere.

I have made some progress in tracking this down.   
1. When the mwrank shell starts up, it looks to see if there is a file in the local directory called PRIMES.  If so, it reads in the contents and uses them (without checking their primality) in a trial division stage of integer factorization.
2. The function that does that is called initprimes().  This function is wrapped in Sage but as far as I can see is not called when the library is used.  This should possibly be changed.
3. When integers are factored there is an initial trial division stage.  Primes which are detected this way (e.g. if trial division goes up to their square root) are added to a list which is maintained for the session to help in future trial divisions.
4. On exit, if there are any primes in the maintained list (which might be there either because they are read at the start or added when found) then that list is output to a file called PRIMES.  In the working directory, and created if it does not already exist, or overwritten if it does.

Now, two of the curves in the doctests for ell_rational_field.rank, namely [1,0,0,0,37455] and [0,0,1,-79,342], have large primes in their discriminants, namely 16180561 and 19047851.  These are added to the maintained list of primes when found, and therefore on exit should be output to the file PRIMES.

I do not know why the output file is only being produced when mwrank_lib is used.  I would expect it to be the other way round!  The writing to file is done by a function called when a global instance of a C++ class has its destructor called.

Wouldn't it be better to simply set the location to something in `DOT_SAGE`, instead of the current directory?

I inserted diagnostic "cout" statements in `extra_prime_class::~extra_prime_class` and ran a few tests.  It seems the destructor always gets called, but the timing --- and whether `PRIMES` is actually written to the file system, it seems --- depends on whether I use the library or pexpect interface.

The pexpect interface reads `SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/mwrank/PRIMES`.  But it doesn't update this file when I quit the Sage command line.  However, if I run

```
sage -c "EllipticCurve([1,0,0,0,37455]).rank(proof=False)"
```
then "hg stat", for example, confirms the file has changed.

Would it help to call a `exitprimes` method explicitly, near the end of `main`?  This *might* avoid problems related to when the runtime calls the destructor.

Disclaimer:  I'm not at all familiar with eclib.
