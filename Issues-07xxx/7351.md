I'm using sage -startuptime.

The singular interface also looks like a *major* culprit:

              sage.interfaces.singular: 0.329 (sage.rings.ideal)
               sage.structure.sequence: 0.000 (sage.interfaces.singular)

Looking, I see that a *horrendously* time consuming function called 
"generate_docstring_dictionary()" is called whenever the file sage/interfaces/singular.py is imported.  This is completely pointless, and shouldn't happen until somebody actually tries to use the singular interface.  A few lines of code would immediately reduce the startup time of Sage by nearly a half second there.
