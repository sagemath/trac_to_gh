The patch implement the disjoint union of a family of enumerated sets. It allows in particular to deal with infinite unions such as in 

```
sage: DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets(
...       Family(NonNegativeIntegers(), Permutations))
Disjoint union of Lazy family (Permutations(i))_{i in Non negative integers}
```

Depend on #7395.
