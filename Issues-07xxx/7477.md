Matroids in Sage could be interesting from the educational point of view, as there are not so many ways to play with matroids on a computer, but also from the algorithmic point of view, as the Graph Theory section could use some help from the Matroid Union and Matroid Intersection Theorems... ( see #7476 )

Macek is a GPL+C implementation of them http://www.fi.muni.cz/~hlineny/MACEK/ which I never tried but may be a good starting point !

I attended a short course on matroids at the US national math meetings in January 2011, and spent the two days hacking up as much about matroids as I could.  I knew David Joyner had done something similar, but I purposely did not look at his work first.  So you will see some common ideas and some differences.

This is definitely not pretty, nor efficient.  The goal was to implement as much functionality as quickly as possible, so there are obvious places where things should be done differently.  But it is clear that much of the hard work can be shipped off to Sage routines for graph theory, linear algebra and combinatorics.

Implements vector matroid, cycle matroid, bicircular matroid, transversal matroid, uniform matroid, and duals of matroids.

Hi Stefan,

Thanks for the information on MACEK.  I didn't know the details, but it looked to me like all support had ended, so it is good to have the confirmation.

What will it take to get the matroid community started with Sage?

Short answer (I sent you a longer by email): the matroid community has already started. We had a [meeting](http://msor.victoria.ac.nz/Main/MatroidComputation) in December, and will have a followup meeting in June. Several people have committed themselves to the effort.

By the way, I changed the "Component" field to combinatorics. I hope that's ok.

Hi David,

Sorry for the delay in replying to this - recovering from Bug Days.

I think the computational matroid folks are quite serious about moving a lot of their work to Sage.  Maybe it would be best if we let them decide what structure will work best for their purposes, rather than putting in something now that may not work well long-term?

You and I could probably best help them by advising and reviewing their contributions, I think.

But we shouldn't wait for them forever.  ;-)

Rob

<a id='comment:12'></a>Hi!

There's a significant effort going on behind the screens to get matroids into Sage. You can get to our work-in-progress code at

https://bitbucket.org/matroid/sage_matroids/

and we've got a mailing list at

https://groups.google.com/group/sage-matroid

Please join in the discussion. There is still plenty to be done.

A quick description of our current status: we've got an abstract Matroid class with a bunch of subclasses: BasisMatroid, LinearMatroid, RankMatroid, CircuitClosuresMatroid are the main ones. There is support for minors and abstract duality. We have a rather fast isomorphism test, and a host of methods for standard queries. There's also a library of common matroids, and a constructor that takes various inputs (including Sage graphs). So you can write

M = Matroid(G)

We think we need some minor coding and major documentation-string-writing before we want to submit it to Sage.

Note: the documentation builds fine from scratch, but I sometimes have trouble when adding these patches to an already built reference manual.

<a id='comment:16'></a>This review will take a lifetime, but right now all I can say is that the code of `circuits`, `cocircuits`, `noncospanning_cocircuits`, and `nonspanning_circuits` look awfully similar.

Nonono, of course you need them. I was just saying that perhaps there could have been an internal function computing all 4 things, exposed in 4 differents ways to the user. This way there is no copy/paste of code.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Hellooooooooooo again !

Well, I've been spending some time on that code, and I first have to say that it is awfully clean. I was a bit afraid that something developped outside of Sage would be more combinat-like, and that is not the case at all here.

The other thing is that, stupid as it may seem, I had not realized until a couple of minutes that I cannot realistically review 21 000 lines of code by myself. I mean, with a real job that I have to do, with 3 meals per day, everything. Looks complicated. This is one of the problems of developping everything for a while then trying to create a single patch out of it.

I will be glad to spend time on that, and also to work with the code later, but yep, I guess that I cannot review 21 000 lines of code `:-)`

I think that in this case, as the code looks preeeeetty clean and all, the best would really be to ask on sage-devel whether :
1) We take it in without a review (as if it were a spkg, actually)
2) Somebody (or many persons) are willing to review it together

Perhaps it would also help if you were to say in your message how you produced this code. If many persons wrote that code, if many tried it...

I think that I can't do more. Otherwise, I know that I will not set this to "positive review" before I am convinced that every single choice is a good one, or at least having asked about it. And after having thought for a while about each line, wondering if it is the best way to do it. I already spent weeks on easier reviews, and I know that I cannot do that one `:-)`

You should have somebody who is more familiar with Sageisms to look at code style, then it should be ready to go. There are some small code style issues that would have been easier if you had started with a smaller chunk of code.\n\nPEP8 whitespace http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations\n\n```\ni = i + 1   # yes\ni=i+1       # no\n```\n\nDocstring markup http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx:\n* `EXAMPLES::` not `EXAMPLE::` (though thats also misspelled in other places in the sage library)\n* Imperative: \"Test that foo is bar\" instead of \"Tests that foo is bar\".\n* `INPUT:` should include type information and our formatting:\n  {{{\n- ``n``: The dimension of the projective space.             # no\n- ``n`` -- positive integer. The dimension of the projective space.  # yes\n    }}}\n  * We have markup for referencing other docstrings\n    {{{\n... see :class:`OtherClass` ...\n... or :meth:`other_method` ...\n    }}}\n    that you might want to use more consistently.\n\nThe SetSystem should probably be factored out and integrated into `sage.sets`.\n\nYour private reimplementation of all matrix functionality has a lot of code-smell. If the only reason is that pivoting is too slow then you should look into fixing that instead of writing your own matrix implementation. \n\nWhats this (left-over debugging?):\n\n```\n  #if d>0: \n  #    F=Fa+Fb \n  #    self._q_projection=self._q_projection.matrix_from_rows_and_columns(F,F) \n```",

<a id='comment:23'></a>Looks pretty solid. I think you can review the mathematical correctness among yourself. You should have somebody who is more familiar with Sageisms to look at code style, then it should be ready to go. There are some small code style issues that would have been easier if you had started with a smaller chunk of code.

PEP8 whitespace http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations

```
i = i + 1   # yes
i=i+1       # no
```

Docstring markup http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx:
* `EXAMPLES::` not `EXAMPLE::` (though thats also misspelled in other places in the sage library)
* Imperative: "Test that foo is bar" instead of "Tests that foo is bar".
* `INPUT:` should include type information and our formatting:
  {{{
- ``n``: The dimension of the projective space.             # no
- ``n`` -- positive integer. The dimension of the projective space.  # yes
    }}}
  * We have markup for referencing other docstrings
    {{{
... see :class:`OtherClass` ...
... or :meth:`other_method` ...
    }}}
    that you might want to use more consistently.

The SetSystem should probably be factored out and integrated into `sage.sets`.

Your private reimplementation of all matrix functionality has a lot of code-smell. If the only reason is that pivoting is too slow then you should look into fixing that instead of writing your own matrix implementation. 

Whats this (left-over debugging?):

```
  #if d>0: 
  #    F=Fa+Fb 
  #    self._q_projection=self._q_projection.matrix_from_rows_and_columns(F,F) 
```

<a id='comment:24'></a>This looks wildly useful, not just for educational purposes. I always wanted to play around with the matroid Hopf algebra, for example...

The remarks below are mostly random and not always to the point. Most of the code is beyound my grasp due to the use of Cython and bitsets and partly due to advanced matroid theory. I'm just looking at random points which seem relevant and/or understandable to me.

What does this mean:

```
It is up to the child class to update its data structure make information  
relative to the new basis more accessible. 
```

Typo "an an":

```
if `I` is covered by a matching an an appropriate bipartite graph
```
That said, "covered by" might be useless, given that you're not saying "maximum matching".

In the next line, do you really mean "maximal matching", or rather "maximum matching"? (I don't know what you want.)

Typo "Compute a the rank". Also, look out for "the the" errors, you got 2 of them.

Any chances to get some comments on `cdef  __fundamental_cocircuit` and `cdef  __fundamental_circuit`? I can't say the code is self-explanatory... Is the "fundamental circuit" of a basis B and an element y the set of all elements of B that could be replaced by y, united with {y}? I see why this is a circuit (when y is not in B, that is) but I haven't seen this notation used anywhere...

Missing "of" in "of the flats the matroid" and in "of the coflats the matroid". Also, typos: "wheter", "distinguised", "commom".

Does the docstring of `cpdef _augment(self, X, Y):` want to say something like "nonempty (if possible) subset `I`" or "maximum subset `I`"? Just a subset is a bit boring...

Is matroid union implemented? I can't find it in the code...

The "if" in "with the property that if no modular triple of hyperplanes has exactly two members in the modular cut" looks out of place. Incidentally, a definition of the notion of "hyperplane" would be of use, too; I didn't know of that notion so far.

The `max_weight_independent` method raises an error if the ground set is empty and the weights keyword is set, something that might happen in practice in recursive definitions:

```
sage: M = matroids.Uniform(0,0)            
sage: wt = {}                             
sage: M.max_weight_independent(weights=wt)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-10-89b2ef4dae56> in <module>()
----> 1 M.max_weight_independent(weights=wt)

/home/darij/sage-5.9/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matroids/matroid.so in sage.matroids.matroid.Matroid.max_weight_independent (sage/matroids/matroid.c:25219)()

/home/darij/sage-5.9/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matroids/matroid.so in sage.matroids.matroid.Matroid.max_weight_independent (sage/matroids/matroid.c:24847)()

IndexError: list index out of range
```

This is due to the `if wt[-1][1] < 0:` line, of course. Same for `max_weight_coindependent`.

This just looks weird:

```
                if self.full_rank()==0: 
	            return True             
	        if self.full_rank()==0 or self.full_corank()==0: 
	            return True  
```

One of the A's should probably be an Atranspose in:

```
                If the matroid is represented by `[I_1 A]`, then the dual is represented by `[-A I_2]` for appropriately sized 
	        identity matrices `I_1, I_2`. 
```
(The minus sign, on the other hand, I don't see the reason for...)

Feature suggestion, if not already implemented: a method to test if a given weight function is generic, i. e., has exactly one maximizing basis. Of course, this is easy thanks to the exchange graph, as one only needs to find a maximizing basis and then check that all its exchange neighbours have strictly smaller weight. This function is useful to some Hopf-algebraic constructions.

<a id='comment:25'></a>Thanks for all your kind words, and for your suggestions! Michael Welsh and I worked on them, and the improved code is now on the ticket. Below I'll address your concerns one by one.

To ncohenn:

- Similar code for circuits(), cocircuits(), nonspanning_circuits(), nonspanning_cocircuits().
  Organizing the code into a common, abstract function is not worth the trouble, in my opinion.
  It will be hard to do so without incurring a speed loss in these exponential-in-the-worst-case
  methods.
- Lingering commented-out code from development has been removed.

To vbraun:

- PEP8 compliance has been achieved, except for line lengths.
- Docstring markup should be much closer to Sage's standards (we use imperatives everywhere, EXAMPLES is plural, INPUT, OUTPUT singular. I did not revisit all inputs to see if they specify type clearly, and did not work on
  referencing markup).
- SetSystem has twofold functionality right now. It serves as return type for methods like circuits(). We plan to change this in the future: the "yield" keyword did not work in Cython when we started out.
  The other function is partition refinement for isomorphism testing. This is mostly of internal use, and makes use of some tweaks. I think a revised SetSystem definitely has its place in sage.sets, but our current effort is
  not nearly polished enough, and is best kept for internal use by the Matroid code.
- Matrix functionality: touching Sage's matrix code was daunting: finite field matrices seem to use floating-point implementations, and I did not want to risk speed regressions elsewhere in Sage. I'm following the M4R1
  and related efforts with interest, and once they are viable, moving our code back to them is easy enough.

To darij

- We want this code to be useful enough, and fast enough, to answer our research questions. These questions routinely generate and compare hundreds of thousands matroids, so
  we aimed for efficiency that matches the best C code out there (Macek and Gordon Royle's private code). We're not there in all methods, but our binary matroids and our isomorphism
  test are really fast.
- I added an example to the description of BasisExchangeMatroid to clarify what a child class might do.
- I expanded the description of the (not yet implemented) class TransversalMatroid a little.
- I fixed the typos mentioned.
- Yes, "augment" will return the maximal such set.
- The B-fundamental circuit of e is the unique circuit contained in B+e. This is standard terminology in matroid theory. I added a line to the method explaining this. I was somewhat surprised that we have no user-facing
  version of it, but that'll be for a later trac ticket.
- The B-fundamental cocircuit of e is the unique cocircuit meeting B only in e. This is the dual notion of the previous item.
- Matroid union is on my wish list. Again, a later trac ticket.
- I added a definition of hyperplane, and removed the offending "if".
- Added an extra check to max_weight_independent and max_weight_coindependent (and two doctests covering this case)
- Removed the double check on self.full_rank()
- Added the transpose. The minus sign is to ensure the row spaces of the matrices are orthogonal complements of each other.
- Feature suggestion: I suggest opening a trac ticket. Do you want just True or False, or a list of all maximizing bases? Maybe an option to max_weight_independent would suffice (e.g. find_all=False)? Oh, wait, that is
  expensive to compute when the weight function is constant.

<a id='comment:27'></a>I think you started studying the code in the wrong file. The main entry point is matroid.pyx. This is an abstract class of which all others derive. It implements all functionality in terms of just the rank function (ok... it'll convert to BasisMatroid for things like isomorphism testing). It should be fairly straightforward, and the code does not swerve far from pure Python.

BasisExchangeMatroid is a common framework for BasisMatroid and LinearMatroid. Internally the groundset is translated to a list of integers, which are used for bitset indexing. So we have

* regular methods. User-facing, expected to be careful with input checking.
* underscored methods. May assume properties regarding their input (type is frozenset, elements are from groundset, two sets are disjoint, ...)
* doubly underscored methods. Very internal use (usually cdef). Use the encoded version of the groundset, and may have bitset arguments into which the return value is copied.

I think most people who will be adding code, will not move beyond the first underscore (things like union() belong in the generic Matroid class anyway). But certainly the cdef methods deserve a little bit of an explanation.

And yes:

```
sage: A = Matrix(GF(7), [[1,0,1,1],[0,1,1,2]])
sage: type(A)
sage.matrix.matrix_modn_dense_float.Matrix_modn_dense_float
```
In our matroid code we store the entries simply as a list of GF(q) elements, with some splicing commands for row operations. Results in a 10- to 20-time speedup in places. It's weird.

I hope I'll get around to doing the further edits soon!

<a id='comment:31'></a>I spent a good chunk of the afternoon looking over the documentation and wrestling with `intersphinx`.

Following are all pretty routine, though maybe the messages from exceptions needs discussion.  Second post is about more mysterious stuff.

I'm doing

```
sage -docbuild reference html
```

and might turn to PDF output once this is settled.  I'd be happy to ride herd on documentation as part of a group review.  By and large, it looks excellent - I like many of the extras, like a discussion on subclassing and accurate synopses and lists at the top of modules.  Nits:

(1) Set up code in the small patch all looks routine to my eye (except see next post).  I have some experience with this, but will not say I am expert at it, so a second look is probably in order.  (Interesting to see how little is actually required to add in a whole new field.)  On the downside, having "matroid" at the top level is now going to make it harder to auto-complete the top-level "matrix" at the command line.  ;-)

(2) In "Creating mew Matroid subclasses": "For incidental use, the RankMatroid subclass." needs another "use"?

(3) In documentation of matroid.is_isomorphism() the EXAMPLES all have an extra indent.  Again with matroid.minor, matroid.equals.  You might troll for more of these across all modules.

(4) I see "MatroidError" instances in the documentation, specifically here at matroid.max_independent.  Is there a precedent for custom exceptions elsewhere in Sage?  More commonly errors are TypeError or ValueError it seems to me.  (Yes, PEP8 says differently.)  And I find the "Problem with a matroid operation:" redundant.  I believe it is a Python convention to have error messages begin with a lower case, to follow the colon (but cannot find a reference for this).

I'd be inclined to replace

```
MatroidError: Problem with a matroid operation: 'Input is not a subset of the groundset.'
```

with something like

```
ValueError: 'input set is not a subset of the groundset.'
```

Even better is to repeat the problem input in the error message.  Here:

```
ValueError: 'input set ['x'] is not a subset of the groundset.'
```


There is usually enough context provided automatically, but echioing the bad input is often very helpful.  Also consider making the text of error messages somewhat unique, so that searches will land a user at the right place in the reference manual.  


(5) Apparently-minor documentation warnings follow.  Should be trivial to fix.

I've had trouble building the documentation. I guess adding an extra folder is not easily accounted for. My recipe was

* delete the doc/output directory
* delete all auto-generated content in doc/en/reference/matroids
* do a "make doc"

I'll get to the other issues mentioned soon.

<a id='comment:34'></a>Hey Rob,

It's saying it can't find that file `/sage/sage-5.10.beta2/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/matroids/objects.inv`. It probably doesn't exist. When doing top-level doc stuff, I always run

sage -docbuild all html
```
I'd try that first.

Also I'm somewhat scared of deleting the entire output directory now. I once did that and consistently got the error your is getting, even doing `docbuild all` (I ended up reinstalling sage, but that's more because I wanted to upgrade anyways.) Perhaps `make doc` does a few extra things then `docbuild all` does...?

Stefan,

The bullet points need to be formatted like this:

```
Some text saying a list:

- the first level, note the blank line
- but this needs a sublist:

  - Note the indentation and the blank line inbetween.

- A line which needs a break
  will go like this.
```
I believe that should take care of the sphinx errors.

Best,

Travis

That's looking much better!  And without editing a `conf.py`  I'll take it up more seriously in the morning.

<a id='comment:38'></a>I just uploaded a new version of the patch. I tested it against 5.10.beta4, I hope it didn't break on 5.10.beta5... 

Items fixed:

* Fixed multiline doctests to have ....:

Responding to darij:

* Improved documentation of cdef methods (especially doubly-underscored ones)
* Corrected _with_coloop docstring
* Corrected typos

Responding to rbeezer:

* Fixed (2)
* Fixed EXAMPLES indentation (3)
* Got rid of MatroidError, made error messages lower case. Did not change content of messages, leaving it for future improvements (4)
* Fixed the documentation (5)

Responding to vbraun (some comments are replies to issues from sage-devel):

* I'm happy to move the bitset enhancements into the rest of Sage (I think you're right that they belong there), but I'd like to wait until after this patch has been accepted. It just keeps it less of a moving target, and reduces the risk of having to rebase.
* Fixed/removed some import statements that got broken (this caused the segfaults)
* Made the lean_matrix interfaces agree with Sage's Matrices to the largest extent (see comments near top of linear_matroid.pyx). 

The LinearMatroid class only uses the trivial nonstandard ``is_nonzero`` method now. The subclasses BinaryMatroid, TernaryMatroid, QuaternaryMatroid, RegularMatroid use a few more methods that have no Sage Matrix equivalent, but all are flagged in the code, and it should be possible to replace them.

<a id='comment:41'></a>Yes, you're right, I didn't look closely enough at the docbuild process. It is related to lazy_import: if I change all.py to do a regular import, then the documentation builds just fine... I guess I'll have to ask sage-devel for advice on that.

And opening a separate ticket: that's definitely a good solution, why didn't I think of that?

Me, too.  I got a bit of advice from John Palmieri off-list, but that did not do the trick.  FWIW, no matter how hard I try to rebuild from scratch, these persist.  I was about to poll sage-devel, but I see that has started.  

Once this gets sorted, I should be able to finish a review of the documentation part of this.

Yes, hope to finish by the end of the weekend (will be way next week at a conference).

"proof reading" might be a bit strong.  I'm looking for adherence to our conventions and only reporting minor problems as I go.  Generally, it is in great shape.  (And of course, way better than some of the older bits of Sage.)  Now that I can actually build all of the documentation, I should be able to wrap it up soon.

John's patch looks good to  me.  I guess the onus will be to now keep the exclusions up-to-date (eg static, template) if new ones come along.  I had not looked too carefully before - it does not really belong in the setup patch here.  Does it make sense to put it on its own ticket, so it does not get buried in this (big) ticket?

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:55'></a>Dear Stefan,\n\nOK, here's the result of another pass - got through two sections this time.  Some of this may be systematic, I'll let you decide what needs mass editing, and what might be one-off.  Generally, the documentation is really very good.  Lots of thought has gone into it and I'm sure it will be easy for new users to get up-to-speed quickly.  Most of this is annoying details (yes, I said annoying).  Some themes, amplified in specific comments below:\n\n1.  Single backticks get TeX treatment for mathematics.  Small chunks of code need double backticks.  This might be isolated in small parts of the constructor file.\n2.  Making references to documentation of other classes (inside or outside of the matroids package) would be better as live links, definitely when you say \"see...\".\n3.  I'm not too dogmatic about long lines in doctests, but an effort should be made to line-break both input and output in the cases where it goes on forever.\n4.  Lots of \"simple\" methods without OUTPUT sections.  Yes, it seems silly to just say \"foo() returns all the foo's of the matroid.\"  I like to provide some very basic idea of what a foo is if possible, then the documentation seems worthwhile.  I've learned a lot of math by reading Sage documentation.\n\nI know this seems like a lot of trouble, but it will be worthwhile in the long run.  I'm thinking this package might be a very good example for others to follow if they wish to add-in other new areas of mathematics.\n\nRob\n\n\n\nMatroid construction (constructor.pyx):\n\n  \"For EXAMPLES:\" appears at least twice, probably a mass substitution hitting the phrase  \"For example\".  Perhaps more in other files?\n\n  The flexibility of the Matroid() constructor in the first two arguments may drive you crazy some day down the road.  I am not suggesting you change it - just a comment.\n\n  \"A matroid specified by a list of circuits gets converted to a BasisMatroid internally:\"\n  Making BasisMatroid a link to the class would be an improvement.\n\n  \"Note: if a groundset is specified, we assume it is in the same order as G.edge_iterator() provides:\"\n  It'd be nice if small chunks of code were typeset as such, here  ``G.edge_iterator()``\n\n  Code:  \"If that fails, we simply use a list `[0..m-1]`\"\n  The single backticks are giving TeX, this should definitely be code, hence two backticks\n  Probably the (i,j) preceding is similar, though we could debate if that is math or code.\n\n  Code:  \"When the ``graph`` keyword is used, a variety of inputs can be converted to a graph automatically. The following\n  uses a graph6 string (see the ``Graph()`` method's documentation)::\"\n  Formatting of the keyword is exactly correct.  Perhaps \"Graph()\" should definitely be a link when it is used in a suggestion to go there.\n\n  Code:  \"sage: M = Matroid(circuit_closures={3: ['edfg', 'acdg', 'bcfg', 'cefh', 'afgh', 'abce', 'abdf', 'begh', 'bcdh', 'adeh'], 4: ['abcdefgh']})\n  Makes a very long line in the documentation, which puts up a scrollable box in my browser.\n  You could define the the long list on its own line, then just reference it, or I think there is enough flexibility on where you can line break the command (maybe open the dictionary, put each key/value on its own line, mildly indented, then close dictionary at start of a subsequent line?).\n\n\nAbstract class (matroid.pyx)\n\n  URL in [GG12] seems broken\n\n  Doctest output:\n   \"sage: M = matroids.named_matroids.Fano()\n    sage: sorted([sorted(C) for C in M.circuits()])\n    [['a', 'b', 'c', 'g'], ['a', 'b', 'd', 'e'], ['a', 'b', 'f'], ['a', 'c', 'd', 'f'], ['a', 'c', 'e'], ['a', 'd', 'g'], ['a', 'e', 'f', 'g'], ['b', 'c', 'd'], ['b', 'c', 'e', 'f'], ['b', 'd', 'f', 'g'], ['b', 'e', 'g'], ['c', 'd', 'e', 'g'], ['c', 'f', 'g'], ['d', 'e', 'f']]\"\n  You can line-break output at any whitespace and the test should succeed.  Here, you could put each interior list\non a line of its own.  I have not looked at the PDF version, but I suspect this will just run off the right edge of the page.\n\n  f-vector() documentation:\n    Has a list with just one item for output.  Probably does not need to be a list.  Ditto for flats().  I'm seeing more like this.  I'm inclined to just write a paragraph, unless returning a pair, triple, or ...\n\n  groundset():\n     Not sure an INPUT section is necessary if there is none.  Even though this is an abstract method, maybe the OUTPUT should be documented?\n\n  is_connected(), is_cosimple() (and more is_ methods) lack OUTPUT, even if it seems silly to have it.\n\n  \"loops() Return the set of loops of the matroid.\"  Is it easy to say in an OUTPUT section what a loop is?  Some people learn mathematics by reading the documentation.  You do not have to go overboard, but can you say in one sentence what a loop is?  It makes the documantation look less vacuous.  (eg OUTPUT: A list of the loops of the matroid.  A loop is a one-element dependent set.)",

Generally, the documentation is really very good.  Lots of thought has gone into it and I'm sure it will be easy for new users to get up-to-speed quickly.  Most of this is annoying details (yes, I said annoying).  Some themes, amplified in specific comments below:

1.  Single backticks get TeX treatment for mathematics.  Small chunks of code need double backticks.  This might be isolated in small parts of the constructor file.
2.  Making references to documentation of other classes (inside or outside of the matroids package) would be better as live links, definitely when you say "see...".
3.  I'm not too dogmatic about long lines in doctests, but an effort should be made to line-break both input and output in the cases where it goes on forever.
4.  Lots of "simple" methods without OUTPUT sections.  Yes, it seems silly to just say "foo() returns all the foo's of the matroid."  I like to provide some very basic idea of what a foo is if possible, then the documentation seems worthwhile.  I've learned a lot of math by reading Sage documentation.

I know this seems like a lot of trouble, but it will be worthwhile in the long run.  I'm thinking this package might be a very good example for others to follow if they wish to add-in other new areas of mathematics.

Matroid construction (constructor.pyx):

  "For EXAMPLES:" appears at least twice, probably a mass substitution hitting the phrase  "For example".  Perhaps more in other files?

  The flexibility of the Matroid() constructor in the first two arguments may drive you crazy some day down the road.  I am not suggesting you change it - just a comment.

  "A matroid specified by a list of circuits gets converted to a BasisMatroid internally:"
  Making BasisMatroid a link to the class would be an improvement.

  "Note: if a groundset is specified, we assume it is in the same order as G.edge_iterator() provides:"
  It'd be nice if small chunks of code were typeset as such, here  ``G.edge_iterator()``

  Code:  "If that fails, we simply use a list `[0..m-1]`"
  The single backticks are giving TeX, this should definitely be code, hence two backticks
  Probably the (i,j) preceding is similar, though we could debate if that is math or code.

  Code:  "When the ``graph`` keyword is used, a variety of inputs can be converted to a graph automatically. The following
  uses a graph6 string (see the ``Graph()`` method's documentation)::"
  Formatting of the keyword is exactly correct.  Perhaps "Graph()" should definitely be a link when it is used in a suggestion to go there.

  Code:  "sage: M = Matroid(circuit_closures={3: ['edfg', 'acdg', 'bcfg', 'cefh', 'afgh', 'abce', 'abdf', 'begh', 'bcdh', 'adeh'], 4: ['abcdefgh']})
  Makes a very long line in the documentation, which puts up a scrollable box in my browser.
  You could define the the long list on its own line, then just reference it, or I think there is enough flexibility on where you can line break the command (maybe open the dictionary, put each key/value on its own line, mildly indented, then close dictionary at start of a subsequent line?).


Abstract class (matroid.pyx)

  URL in [GG12] seems broken

  Doctest output:
   "sage: M = matroids.named_matroids.Fano()
    sage: sorted([sorted(C) for C in M.circuits()])
    [['a', 'b', 'c', 'g'], ['a', 'b', 'd', 'e'], ['a', 'b', 'f'], ['a', 'c', 'd', 'f'], ['a', 'c', 'e'], ['a', 'd', 'g'], ['a', 'e', 'f', 'g'], ['b', 'c', 'd'], ['b', 'c', 'e', 'f'], ['b', 'd', 'f', 'g'], ['b', 'e', 'g'], ['c', 'd', 'e', 'g'], ['c', 'f', 'g'], ['d', 'e', 'f']]"
  You can line-break output at any whitespace and the test should succeed.  Here, you could put each interior list
on a line of its own.  I have not looked at the PDF version, but I suspect this will just run off the right edge of the page.

  f-vector() documentation:
    Has a list with just one item for output.  Probably does not need to be a list.  Ditto for flats().  I'm seeing more like this.  I'm inclined to just write a paragraph, unless returning a pair, triple, or ...

  groundset():
     Not sure an INPUT section is necessary if there is none.  Even though this is an abstract method, maybe the OUTPUT should be documented?

  is_connected(), is_cosimple() (and more is_ methods) lack OUTPUT, even if it seems silly to have it.

  "loops() Return the set of loops of the matroid."  Is it easy to say in an OUTPUT section what a loop is?  Some people learn mathematics by reading the documentation.  You do not have to go overboard, but can you say in one sentence what a loop is?  It makes the documantation look less vacuous.  (eg OUTPUT: A list of the loops of the matroid.  A loop is a one-element dependent set.)

You haven't got to catalog.py yet (it's horrible for this), but is there a general guideline on characters per line?

There were lots like this, so I left them as they are, as that's a debate I don't really want to have.

I'm confused. f_vector() returns a list [f_0, ..., f_r] where f_i is the number of flats of rank i, and r the rank of the matroid. That's got more than one thing in it. And flats() returns a SetSystem, not a list, and there's normally a lot more than one flat at a given rank.

Yes, no need to debate, but `[0..m-1]` is definitely code and should definitely be in double backticks.  I don't want to debate either - but it is often extremely clear if you have code or math, and these should be formatted right.
