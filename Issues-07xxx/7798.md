The purpose of the ticket is be able to recompute plots such that the following problem can be solved

```

# to increase the range of axis does not extend the plots
# we need to recompute the plot to do that
var('x')
p = plot(x**,x)
p.set_axes_range(-10,10,-10,10)

```

**Assignee:** @williamstein

**Keywords:** axes, range
