The purpose of the ticket is be able to recompute plots such that the following problem can be solved

```

# to increase the range of axis does not extend the plots
# we need to recompute the plot to do that
var('x')
p = plot(x**,x)
p.set_axes_range(-10,10,-10,10)

```

+The purpose of the ticket is be able to recompute plots in order to have labels at given functions. You need to locate where the function text should be applied to the function plot to be able to have labels for plots like: 
+
+   var('x'); 
+   x_cord = xmin; 
+   f = x**2; 
+   p = plot(f,x)+text(f,(x_cord,f(x_cord))

+
+   g = x;
+   f = x**2;
+   p = plot(f,x);
+   x_cord = xmin;
+   (g + f) + text(f, (f,x_cord), g, (g,x_cord)) 
+
+where the string prints the label for g, while "g" prints label only for f.
