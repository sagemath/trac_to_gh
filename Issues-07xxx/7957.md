This is fallout from #7490. See also #7916 for problems with `conjugate()`.

[attachment: trac_7957-pynac_exceptions.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7957/trac_7957-pynac_exceptions.patch.gz) adds exception handling to sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx to eliminate the "error ignored" message.

With a simple change in the pynac `numeric::real()` code, new timings are:

Before:

```
sage: %time real(v14)
CPU times: user 30.19 s, sys: 0.42 s, total: 30.61 s
Wall time: 30.96 s
-0.5773508481209188?
```

After:

```
sage: %time real(v14)
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.01 s
-0.5773508481209188?
```

I'll make a new pynac package including this change available soon.

Sorry for the inconvenience. My patch queue contains all the fixes from yesterday. I forgot to check dependencies.

This depends on #6961. You can apply the patch there without waiting for the new pynac spkg. Only the `loads(dumps())` test with `psi2`, should fail.
