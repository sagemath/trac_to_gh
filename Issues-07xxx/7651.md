This is because the data structure for sparse graphs is itself directed, and in_neighbors is a slow function, as it needs to check each node.

I saw you replaced 

```
for w in (self._cg.out_neighbors(v) if side == 1 else self._cg.in_neighbors(v)): 
```
with

```
if side == 1: 
   neighbors = self._cg.out_neighbors(v) 
elif self._cg_rev is not None: # Sparse 
   neighbors = self._cg_rev.out_neighbors(v) 
else: # Dense 
   neighbors = self._cg.in_neighbors(v) 
```
I understand what you mean, but wouldn't it easier for developpers to define a function "in_neighbors" or "out_neighbors" doing this stuff to avoid dealing with the implementation of graphs when in the c_graph.pyx file ( where the algorithm are more graph-theoretic and a bit further from the implementation ) ?

This kind of thing is bound to reappear very often as we write algorithms in Cython... :-)

On the level of c_graphs, there is no way to avoid the implementation of graphs. You're using ints as vertices which may not line up with the actual labels, and since you're calling methods of self._cg, there's no way around it. If you want to write on a more friendly level, you need to sacrifice some speed, since on the level of (mostly Python) backends, the vertex labels are honest, and 'in_neighbors' is the appropriate function there.

This is only relevant to very low-level functions. In which case you *are* implementing graphs :)
