This is because the data structure for sparse graphs is itself directed, and in_neighbors is a slow function, as it needs to check each node.

I saw you replaced 

```
for w in (self._cg.out_neighbors(v) if side == 1 else self._cg.in_neighbors(v)): 
```
with

```
if side == 1: 
   neighbors = self._cg.out_neighbors(v) 
elif self._cg_rev is not None: # Sparse 
   neighbors = self._cg_rev.out_neighbors(v) 
else: # Dense 
   neighbors = self._cg.in_neighbors(v) 
```
I understand what you mean, but wouldn't it easier for developpers to define a function "in_neighbors" or "out_neighbors" doing this stuff to avoid dealing with the implementation of graphs when in the c_graph.pyx file ( where the algorithm are more graph-theoretic and a bit further from the implementation ) ?

This kind of thing is bound to reappear very often as we write algorithms in Cython... :-)

This is only relevant to very low-level functions. In which case you *are* implementing graphs :)

SparseGraphs will never have a reversed version. CGraphBackends may have a reversed version (i.e. two SparseGraphs), in which case in_neighbors will call it. I don't think we need to worry too much about lots of people implementing functions for the backends.
