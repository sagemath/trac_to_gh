This is not good:

```
flat:sagenb wstein$ pwd
/Users/wstein/sage/nb/sagenb
flat:sagenb wstein$ sage -c "print os.path.abspath('.')"
/Users/wstein/sage/build/64bit/sage/local/bin
```

It should be when one runs "sage -c" that it runs in the *current* directory.  The actual behavior is very confusing.
