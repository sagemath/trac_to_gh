Somewhere between 4.1 and 4.3, log(x) got really slow when x is a float.

Example:


```
sage: version()
'Sage Version 4.3, Release Date: 2009-12-24'
sage: x = float(5)
sage: x
5.0
sage: timeit('log(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 362 µs per loop
```

```
sage: version()
'Sage Version 4.1, Release Date: 2009-07-09'
sage: x = float(5)
sage: timeit('log(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 7.26 µs per loop
```

Although it is not the same issue, this will be fixed by #7822. I have a new patch for that problem which brings the timings back to comparable values.
