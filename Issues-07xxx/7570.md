list_plot does not accept **empty** lists:

```
list_plot([1],rgbcolor=(1,0,0))+list_plot([],rgbcolor=(0,0,1))

IndexError: list index out of range
```

does not work, whereas

```
list_plot([1],rgbcolor=(1,0,0))+list_plot([2],rgbcolor=(0,0,1))
```

does work. It would be nicer if list_plot of empty lists gives an empty graphics object.

The patch was made against sage-4.6.0

It handles empty lists as input to arrow, line, point, and plot.

I'm not sure what other plotting functions would benefit from empty lists as input.

sage/plot/point.py fails. 

When I passed an empty list I got an error. 

sage: point([])
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (273, 0))

Thanks for working on polishing these things!

One quick comment from just glancing at the patch: there is a typo that occurs twice in the patch: "returns and empty plot" (where "and" should be "an").

Try:
[[[
a = point([])
type(a)
]]]
a is of type sage.plot.plot.Graphics()

The only test that didn't pass was ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/plot/arrow.py and I think it's only because you have line 412 in:

```
sage: arrow2d(headpoint=None, tailpoint) 
```


If you delete that line, the tests pass and everything looks good.
