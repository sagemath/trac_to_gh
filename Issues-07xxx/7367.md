Currently, the [reference manual's](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/index.html) [Notebook section](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/notebook.html) documents the old Sage notebook.

We should update this section with docstrings from the recently separated [SageNB](http://nb.sagemath.org/).

I've commented out the "Interfaces" section, for now.

I think `sagenb.misc.sphinxify`'s docstrings need just a bit of tweaking.

Of course, we can comment it out, too, temporarily.  I didn't mean to pile on more work.

"Documentation" is indeed confusing.  I think my motive was to identify and group the [mostly] help-related modules.  Since `support` falls under "Online Help" and "Miscellaneous," the forthcoming patch simply puts them all under the latter.
