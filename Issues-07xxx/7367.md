Currently, the [reference manual's](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/index.html) [Notebook section](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/notebook.html) documents the old Sage notebook.

We should update this section with docstrings from the recently separated [SageNB](http://nb.sagemath.org/).
