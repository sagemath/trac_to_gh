Currently, the [reference manual's](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/index.html) [Notebook section](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/notebook.html) documents the old Sage notebook.

We should update this section with docstrings from the recently separated [SageNB](http://nb.sagemath.org/).

I've commented out the "Interfaces" section, for now.

I think `sagenb.misc.sphinxify`'s docstrings need just a bit of tweaking.

Of course, we can comment it out, too, temporarily.  I didn't mean to pile on more work.

Everything looks good, but why is the miscellaneous section named "Documentation"? Shouldn't it be named "Miscellaneous functions", or "Introspection", or the like? The name "Documentation" is confusing, at least for me.

"Documentation" is indeed confusing.  I think my motive was to identify and group the [mostly] help-related modules.  Since `support` falls under "Online Help" and "Miscellaneous," the forthcoming patch simply puts them all under the latter.
