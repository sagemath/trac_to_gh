It should be easy to get the orthogonal complement of a subspace W of a vector space V.   From Jason Grout: 

```
sage: def orthogonal_complement(space):
....:     if space.dimension()==0:
....:         return space.ambient_vector_space()
....:     else:
....:         return space.basis_matrix().right_kernel()
```
One would also want to add an option to specify the larger space in which you were dealing, with it defaulting to the ambient vector space.  Probably 'perp()' should be an alias.

Thanks for doing this - I never got to it, since I haven't used this lately.   Agreed on the enhancement.

The documentation should make it clear what the ambient space is by default, perhaps by adding an example where things fail?  Or at least commenting that the first example just shows itself as the ambient space.  What would happen if one took a double subspace - what would it consider to be the ambient subspace?

<a id='comment:4'></a>I got a chance to look at this over the weekend.  Unsurprisingly, in general it's great.  But...

Since this is in the free module module (!), there should be a better error for 

```
sage: c = FreeModule(Integers(8), 2)
sage: c.perp()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<snip>
NotImplementedError: Don't know how to compute kernels over Ring of integers modulo 8
```
I also noticed the following behavior, which is probably desirable, but which should then definitely be explicitly mentioned in the documentation for this function, since it does return a different type of object for the perp object:

```
sage: c = FreeModule(ZZ, 2)
sage: c
Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
sage: c.perp()
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 0 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
[]
```

Then what do you suggest?  Since this is primarily useful for pedagogical purposes, perhaps we can just raise an error outside of QQ, RR, and friends.  In particular, I think it's definitely appropriate to not allow this for anything but vector spaces.

One interesting thing is that Sage is already doing something analogous to your suggestion about tensoring in getting the "basis matrix", which led to the workaround Travis made.  Then again,

```
Vector space of degree 3 and dimension 2 over Integer Ring
```
shouldn't even be legal to appear in Sage, in some sense...

Even there it's only wrt the standard inner product (i.e., if your basis is orthogonal) that this complement is *orthogonal*.

Wouldn't just `complement` work? I think that's a reasonably established term for direct cofactor.

And indeed, you should probably only offer this for vector spaces, i.e., when the base ring is a field.

<a id='comment:14'></a>First, if the ring is not a PID, there are many attributes that are not there anymore (ex. `span()`), so getting the attribute error is consistent with the rest of free modules.

As for them being inner product spaces, we have this in sage:

```
sage: F = FreeModule(Integers(8), 3)
sage: v = F([1, 2, 3])
sage: v*v
6
sage: F.inner_product_matrix()
[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
```
so I think sage always assumes it has an inner product (although not necessarily a nice inner product).

For the

```
Vector space of degree 3 and dimension 2 over Integer Ring
```
that was a doctest error coming from me thinking I know what the output should be >_<.

Anyways, new version of the patch with the method now called `complement()`, removed `perp()`, and only works for vector spaces.

For patchbot:

Apply: trac_7522-perp-ts.patch
