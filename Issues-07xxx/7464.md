```
The use of a non-POSIX option '-v' to the 'cp' command prevents this package installing on Solaris. The option, which can also be written as --verbose, is only to show what is actually being copied, so removing it should have no impact. 
Therefore

```
cp -rv cremona $SAGE_DATA/
```
was changed to 

```
cp -r cremona $SAGE_DATA/
```
in spkg-install. 

I also renamed 'SAGE.txt' to SPKG.txt, and added a slightly better description, and upstream contact information, to make it more consistent with other packages. 

This is an optional Sage package. 

It is unusual in that the .spkg file, was a tar file, and not a compressed tar file as they usually are. 

The updated files can be found at:

This is the case for all databases of compressed files.  One makes a non-compressed spkg by doing

```
   sage -pkg_nc directory_name
