DEPENDS ON #7483

The goal of this ticket is to rewrite the load and attach commands to eliminate a lot of weirdness:

 (1) they should both be usable as normal python functions, so people who find the `load <...>` form and `attach <....>` forms weird, can forget they exist.  This also makes comprehensive doctesting way easier. 

 (2) it should be possible to do `load DIR+'file.sage'` say, and also constructions like 

```
for i in range(3):
    load "setup%s.py"%i
```


The patches hopefully do the above and much more.   They refactor all the relevant code, document it way, way better, clean it up, and unify it (there was tons of replication between the notebook and command line).  

The notebook page (sagenb-7514.patch) is only needed if you use the ntoebook, by the way.

Reading the summary of this ticket made me remember a problem I was having with the attach command : Can we attach a file already in the sage tree that we are editing? I already tried, but I stopped using it because sometimes the changes in the file were not considered and I have been stopping sage and running sage -br ever since then.

Maybe I was doing something bad or maybe this ticket solves the problem or maybe it is not possible at all to do this...??

I noticed

```python
sage: f = 1
sage: save(f, 'f')
sage: attach('f.sobj')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: argument (='f.sobj') to load or attach must have extension py, sage, or pyx                             
sage: attached_files()
['f.sobj']
```

Questions about loading/attaching Cython files:

* Can they only be loaded once, if they haven't changed?  For example: If `zzz.pyx` contains `print 'Zzz!'`, I see

```python
sage: load('zzz.pyx')
Compiling zzz.pyx...
Zzz!
sage: load('zzz.pyx')
sage: load('zzz.pyx')
sage: # Now I edit zzz.pyx
sage: load('zzz.pyx')
Compiling zzz.pyx...
Awake!
```

* Can they access existing objects?  For example: If I put

```python
try:
    b += 1
except:
    b = 10
print b
```

    in a .pyx file, loading the file always sets `b` to 10, even if it's already defined.

Disclaimer:  I'm still quite ignorant about Cython.

I'm not sure about the Cython file reload problem.  Should we set `use_cache=True` when loading .pyx files explicitly?

On globals:  I see that a Cython file `foo.pyx` is compiled to a module and loaded via `from foo import *`.

Can someone else please help to review this ticket?

I'm not sure.  But I think this should be a separate ticket, since it would be a new feature.

That's really weird, because it is one of the problems that this patch definitely fixes.  Are you sure?   Did you define a function f in one input cell, then do f?? in another, and it didn't show the source code?    Were you using a clean sagenb-0.4.8 install for testing?  Maybe I messed up posting the patch.

This has been the case forever.  It is not caused by this patch.  I don't think it is desirable.  Please do open a ticket. 

OK, so I'm going to fix the ___code___.py issue you reported above, triple check that f?? works, and if not, figure out what went wrong, then mark this as "needs review" again.

The attached patch (sagenb-7514-rebase-part3.patch) should:

1. Fixed this: "When I load/attach a .(s)pyx file in the notebook, _code.py appears in the cell's output HTML."

2. Fixed this: "Typing f??<TAB> for a function f defined in the notebook shows its docstring but not its source code."  Actually, this wasn't exactly broken... the last line of the docstring was missing.  I've added a newline to the end of the input file, and now the problem is gone.  This isn't a hack, since I think files are *supposed* to end with a newline, according to "IEEE Standard 1003.1 (aka POSIX)".
