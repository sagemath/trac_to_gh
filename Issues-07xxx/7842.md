```
The attached patch allows for the following:

```
            sage: xseries = attrcall('series', x)
            sage: xseries(sin(x), 4)
            1*x + (-1/6)*x^3 + Order(x^4)
```

This is used in #7753

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

Another nice thing to have now that I think about it would be this syntax:

```
sage: xseries = attrcall.series(x)
sage: xseries(sin(x), 4)
1*x + (-1/6)*x^3 + Order(x^4)
```

I'll make a new ticket for this so that that it'll backward-compatible with the old version.

Your point is that this syntax gives a better visual hint about this being about method calls, right? So here, attrcall would be some sort of dummy object placeholder? Why not. Though I am a bit reluctant with having two syntaxes.

Do you mind reviewing this first, so that we can get #7753 in?

I'll review your patch in return :-)

This patch looks good to me.

We should also maybe allow putting keywords in too at the "second stage".
