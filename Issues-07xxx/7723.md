Here's the beginnings of my work on sparse double matrices.

This is based on 4.3.rc0. Note that I have *not* run the entire Sage test suite,
only tests in the matrix package. I'm happy to run the entire suite once I know
the final revision this will be rebased to, but 4.3.rc0 produces a few test
failures in itself (=noise I'm not bothering with for the moment).

There are three patches, which should be applied and reviewed in this order:

- generic_multiply lets one override matrix multiplication with
  different parents.  This is in a seperate patch because it changes
  structure/element.pxd, causing a big recompile.

- double_sparse is the main new classes

- coo_format changes the matrix constructor to accept "coo=..." (see docstring
  in patch)

More comments:

- I will not introduce seperate classes for real and complex -- there
  will be other subclasses (Hermitian, strictly-diagonal etc.) and I
  don't want to double the size of the hierarchy. There are other
  (and better) ways to get efficient getitem/setitem without a speed
  penalty (such as introducing a seperate ItemAccessor protocol/class
  -- though for sparse matrices an if-test won't matter either).

- Once this is accepted (and I have a general feel for what I do
  right and wrong) I hope to continue with solvers etc. (as I scratch my itches).

REFEREE REPORT:

* trac_7723-generic_multiply.patch: 

Looks good, except there is a missing word "have" in this documentation:

```
3485	        The matrices should both the same base ring and either both 
3486	        should be dense or both sparse. 
```
This doesn't cause any doctest failures, and factoring this code out is a good idea. 

* trac_7723-double_sparse.patch

Looks good.


* trac_7723-coo_format.patch 

This causes a bunch of doctest failures:

The following tests failed:

Total time for all tests: 1.5 seconds
```


I noticed a *massive* performance regression as a result of your patches:

```
OLD SAGE:
sage: s = random_matrix(RDF,100)
sage: time t =s*s
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.15 s


WITH YOUR PATCHES:
sage: s = random_matrix(RDF,100)
sage: time t =s*s
CPU times: user 0.91 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.91 s
Wall time: 0.91 s
```

Ouch.  These are both dense matrices.  There must be something that got seriously messed up with re-factoring?

* Why is there a backslash here in `matrix_double_sparse.pyx`:

```
        either as a single list of length ``nrows\*ncols``, or as a 
```


---

Overall I'm very happy and excited about this patch!!  I'm really, really glad you're working on this, and would like to do anything I can to encourage this.  It is critically valuable to the Sage project to get much better numerical sparse matrix support.

Ouch.

I have not idea when I can get back to this at the moment. Basically what has happened is that I bit the bullet and implemented my own numerical matrix class hierarchy which is usable without Sage (but loosely modeled after it). That ended up giving me the results I needed much faster...

The long-term goal is to perhaps try to merge this back into Sage, however as there's no real benefit for my own work in doing that I don't really know if or when.
