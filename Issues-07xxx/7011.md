At #6283, we changed the parallel testing framework so that it automatically uses all the cores/threads available, but perhaps this is not the best solution.

Dave says ([comment:9:ticket:6283]) "I would have personally not allowed the default to exceed 8", so maybe we can incorporate his limit in a way that still lets ordinary multicore computers be well-used:

* NUM_THREADS defaults to 0, which is now interpreted in the sage-ptest script as min(cpu_count(), 8) -- so the default doesn't exceed 8, as Dave suggested.
* if NUM_THREADS is -1, it just uses cpu_count().

On sage-devel, I suggested that a solution that works really well for 99+% of people is a good one -- and since most "regular" machines on which Sage is doctested have 8 or fewer cores, this still works fine for them, and with the above suggestion, people won't bring sage.math or t2.math to their knees.

Thoughts?

On second thought, scratch the -1 idea. We can just make one change to sage-ptest: line 267 could be

```
numthreads = min(8, multiprocessing.cpu_count())
```
Anyone who is desperate to saturate a machine with more than 8 cores can just specify it on the command line.
