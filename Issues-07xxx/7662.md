<a id='comment:5'></a>Hello ! I added a short definition of what a hole is (a cycle of length at least 4), and replaced peo_copy by peo (sorry for that `O_o`).

What about my `Such an ordering is called a Perfect Elimination Order` ? Would you like something more formal instead ?

I'm not sure whether this is enough. Imagine a user who knows what the definition of chordal is, but not much else. You still want the documentation for this function to make sense to that user. Granted, it is not Sage's job to educate people about all of mathematics, but it certainly should be able to make clear what the input and output of each function is. Perhaps in this case it could do a better job of informing the user of what it is returning.

As long as you say what an elimination order is, then I think that's enough, but right now it is an undefined term.
