You should define what a "perfect elimination order" and a "hole" are in the documentation.

Hello ! I added a short definition of what a hole is (a cycle of length at least 4), and replaced peo_copy by peo (sorry for that `O_o`).

What about my `Such an ordering is called a Perfect Elimination Order` ? Would you like something more formal instead ?

I'm not sure whether this is enough. Imagine a user who knows what the definition of chordal is, but not much else. You still want the documentation for this function to make sense to that user.

As long as you say what an elimination order is, then I think that's enough, but right now it is an undefined term.
