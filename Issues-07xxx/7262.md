Currently sage returns a pair of rational functions when asked 

```
E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
E.multiplication_by_n(7)
```

I would be better if this creates a `EllipticCurveIsogeny` object from E to E.

I would send both coordinates to the constructor. Your code of constructing them is faster than what the generic isogeny-code will do.

Yes, that is what I will do. I do not think that we will need this option of specifying an isogeny when the codomain is not known. One could always send the denominator as a kernel_polynomial which will create the codomain.

Of course there is an obvious extension that should be added here. Complex multiplication, like multiplication_by_n(2*i+3). Also we could make automorphisms into a group and create a endomorphism ring... oh but I am dreaming some steps ahead of what I will do about this ticket.

I've got a prototype patch ready that I'm going to post now, but I'd like some opinions before I finish it off. 

First, here's what I did: it'd be nice if we could make `multiplication_by_m` return an `EllipticCurveIsogeny` object without breaking any old code. This is no problem: I added a `__getitem__` and `__iter__` method to `EllipticCurveIsogeny` objects, so that statements like ` x, y = E.multiplication_by_m(7) ` still work just as before. However, it's not all sunshine and roses ...

Here are some questions:

* It's **significantly** slower to do it this way. This is because isogeny objects compute a whole bunch of other information about themselves, which has to happen to create one. (We could do a lot more work to make all those attributes lazy, which would possibly alleviate some of the issue.) This isn't just "oh, it's a few percent slower" -- here's an example with the old code:

  ```
  sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
  sage: %time x,y = E.multiplication_by_m(17)
  CPU times: user 0.73 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.75 s
  Wall time: 0.87 s
  ```
  I ran the new version of the code on the same example when I **started** this ticket, and it's still running. And no, I don't type at 4000 WPM. `:)` So that's definitely a huge speed penalty. A `_very_` cursory glance suggests that at least part of this time is getting lost in some polynomial arithmetic; I'm happy to look into that if no one beats me to it. 

* The `x_only` argument also creates an issue. Before, the function would return either a rational function or a tuple of two of them, which is unfortunate -- in general, the rule of thumb is that we prefer for functions to have a single return type, no matter what flags are passed. So we could still do the same thing, but it somehow feels even more egregious to have the function return either a rational function or an isogeny object.

I'm not sure what the best plan is -- I'm guessing people aren't willing to accept that speed hit in general. We could also have a separate function, maybe `multiplication_by_m_isogeny` or somesuch?

I'm attaching a patch anyway, in case people want to play around with it. Don't be frightened by the size of the patch file -- I got a little carried away using `\C-t` in emacs, and reformatted all the documentation to be at most 80 characters wide. I also changed some statements of the form `x == None` to `x is None,` mostly out of habit. (It's faster, and arguably more sensible -- after all, `None` is a unique object.) So even if we decide on a completely different plan for this ticket, I'd still like to extract the doc cleanup changes and submit those.

Since I'm mostly looking for comments, I'm adding one or two people on the cc list ...

(Shame that I am sitting in my office, marking exams, when all this action happens on bugs.)

I fear that speed is an issue, so I am in favour of having both options, `multiplication_by_m_isogeny` sounds like a good idea.

In a more long-term vision, you might want to look at #7368. For instance, I am not sure yet, how one should design isogenies in general. Probably they should internally remember their factorisation if they came with one. Like a seperable \circ non-seperable isogeny. Even for the isogeny [m], it might be much faster if we treat it as \phi \circ \hat\phi when there is a factorisation like that. etc etc.

But any progress on this is very welcome and the big philiosophical questions can be looked at later.

Probably you are aware of the related ticket #6413.

I have read through the patch, but not started testing yet.  I think this is a summary of what it contains:

1. A lot of cosmetic changes to the docstrings
2. Several minor changes such as "is None" for "None == "
3. The new ability to construct an isogeny with the maps in hand, not just the kernel poly.
4. A new function in ell_generic which creates a multiplcation-by-m map as an isogeny (in the separable case) by using the existing code to get the maps and then calling the new constructor.

Have I missed anything?  I do think that this is a good start, and will go on to test.

Am I doing something stupid here?  The patch applies fine but when I run the test I get
this from ell_generic.py:

```
    sage: E.multiplication_by_m_isogeny(7)
    AttributeError: 'EllipticCurve_rational_field' object has no attribute 'multiplication_by_m_isogeny'
```
which makes no sense since E has type `EllipticCurve_rational_field` which derived from `EllipticCurve_generic`, which is where multiplication_by_m_isogeny() is defined.

Apologies, I patched a clone but ran the main branch.  Stupid!

Tests do pass.  Positive review soon, I expect!

Looking at the code, I see that this is not doing exactly what my original idea was when I opened this trac. The reason this is so slow is that a lot of computations will be done several times. I thought that one should create the isogeny without running through the current init of the object. I think all data is known easily once the division polynomial is computed.

Of course, we can leave it like that by now, but I would suggest to open a further ticket to improve this.

Another ugly thing is

```
sage: phi.codomain() == phi.domain()
False
```

One should set the post_isomorphism correctly.

As to the 4-isogeny, this is indeed not implemented since it is a bit more complicated. The best would be to have the composition of morphisms defined and then to defined by iterating [2]. We can leave it like that by now. It is a shame though.
