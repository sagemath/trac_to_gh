I assume this is in one of the files that gets called for every single .spkg. It appears 'date -s' is not portable

Where's the fix that received positive receive, and so allowed the ticket to be closed? 

It seems a lot of tickets are now getting positive review and closed, where there is no actual fix.

1. This ticket has seen no activity at all in years.
2. I haven't seen any report of this problem in years (usually, when there is really a problem, it pops up on `sage-devel` now and then).
3. I grepped the Sage sources and couldn't find anything like `date -s`.

If you really think there is still a problem, feel free to re-open the ticket but with more concrete info than just "I assume this is in one of the files that gets called for every single .spkg".
