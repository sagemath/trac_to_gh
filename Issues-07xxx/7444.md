From Tim Dumol (also [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7343#comment:6)):

Creating and publishing a worksheet, and then searching for it on the /pub/ page causes an HTTP 500. Server logs show:

```
[...]
File "/opt/sage-bin/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb/notebook/twist.py", line 1652, in render
            s = render_worksheet_list(ctx.args, pub=True, username=self.username)
          File "/opt/sage-bin/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb/notebook/twist.py", line 1483, in render_worksheet_list
            search=search, reverse=reverse)
          File "/opt/sage-bin/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb/notebook/notebook.py", line 1292, in worksheet_list_for_public
            W = [x for x in W if x.satisfies_search(search)]
          File "/opt/sage-bin/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb/notebook/worksheet.py", line 1977, in satisfies_search
            + open(filename).read().lower())

Attachment: **[trac_7444-search_after_publish.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7444/trac_7444-search_after_publish.patch.gz)**

Notes:

* This depends on #7428.
* I assume it's OK to call `worksheet.save` in `notebook._initialize_worksheet`.
* `TestWorksheetList.test_searching_for_worksheets` no longer fails --- it now yields an error.

Patch works. Positive review.

The error is due to the lack of the javascript libraries on the Log page. This is now #7455.
