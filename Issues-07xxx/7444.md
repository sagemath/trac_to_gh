From Tim Dumol (also [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7343#comment:6)):

Creating and publishing a worksheet, and then searching for it on the /pub/ page causes an HTTP 500. Server logs show:

```

**Attachment:** [trac_7444-search_after_publish.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7444/trac_7444-search_after_publish.patch.gz)

Notes:

* This depends on #7428.
* I assume it's OK to call `worksheet.save` in `notebook._initialize_worksheet`.
* `TestWorksheetList.test_searching_for_worksheets` no longer fails --- it now yields an error.
