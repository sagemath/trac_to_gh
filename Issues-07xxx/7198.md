I backed this out of sage-4.2.alpha1.

This caused problems since there were other free monoid elements that expected to have an `__iter__` which returned something different than what was chosen for this patch.  For example, things in the StringMonoid and free monoid elements in sage/crypto.

**Attachment:** [trac_7198-string_monoid_element_iterator.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7198/trac_7198-string_monoid_element_iterator.patch.gz)

I added a new patch which restores the expected iterator interface of `StringMonoidElement`s.

Martin, can you review my changes?

Both

* [attachment:trac_7198-string_monoid_element_iterator.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7198/trac_7198-string_monoid_element_iterator.patch)
should be applied.
