I backed this out of sage-4.2.alpha1.

This caused problems since there were other free monoid elements that expected to have an `__iter__` which returned something different than what was chosen for this patch.  For example, things in the StringMonoid and free monoid elements in sage/crypto.

I added a new patch which restores the expected iterator interface of `StringMonoidElement`s.

Martin, can you review my changes?
