I backed this out of sage-4.2.alpha1.

This caused problems since there were other free monoid elements that expected to have an __iter__ which returned something different than what was chosen for this patch.  For example, things in the StringMonoid and free monoid elements in sage/crypto.

Attachment [trac_7198-string_monoid_element_iterator.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket7198/trac_7198-string_monoid_element_iterator.patch) by @burcin created at 2009-12-29 21:44:43

I added a new patch which restores the expected iterator interface of `StringMonoidElement`s.

Martin, can you review my changes?

Both
* attachment:trac_7198-free_algebra_iterator.patch and
* attachment:trac_7198-string_monoid_element_iterator.patch
should be applied.
