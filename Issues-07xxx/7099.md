The original bug is already solved by passing the correct precision to PARI's `incgam()`.

The bug in comment:5 should be solved by the additional changes to `Function_gamma_inc._evalf_()`.

I think it is better not to confuse these 2 different bugs.

is `prec` parameter mentioned in the doc on `gamma`? It doesn't, IMHO. 
Are there other transcendentals for which this parameter does work?
