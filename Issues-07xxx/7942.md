That is dumb and should be fixed!

sage: latex(I)
I
sage: latex(i)
I

It should output "i" not "I".

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
This is a duplicate of #6405. Number field elements don't support a separate latex name option, so we have 3 options:
* Use `i` for both modes
* Use `I` for both modes
* implement a latex_name option for number field elements.
