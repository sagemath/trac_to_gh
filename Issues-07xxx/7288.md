See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomory%E2%80%93Hu_tree. (which explains the algorithm used)

Gomory-Hu trees are a classical decomposition of the edge connectivity of graphs, and this is not very long to write when one has a function for min-st-cut.

This patch also slightly improves edge_cut and vertex_cut, which was needed to implement gomory_hu_tree

Note : until #7311 is reviewed and merged, some exceptions will be raised when testing the file generic_graph

Hello again !
I tested your patch with ``sage -t generic_graph.py graph.py`` and it works ok, but when I type ``sage -t -optional generic_graph.py graph.py``, I get the following:

```

All tests passed!

Hello, Nathann !
I looked at your patch and I'm getting more and more used to what it does. I just added a patch that change many different small things in the docstrings and in the code, but these are only formatting changes. I assume you won't agree with all of them (a lot are based on my style of programming, though I tried to respect yours as much as I could ;)) so feel free to put anything back to what it was if you don't agree.

Before I resume the review, I have some comments/questions on your code.

1. Around line 3109 of the file generic_graph.py, you write

```
[p.add_constraint(v[x] + b[x][y] - v[y], min=0, max=0) for (x,y) in g.edges(labels=None)]
```
Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems it would be more readable and more efficient to simply write a `for` loop doing the same work. It is strange to create a list that you won't use anymore in the function. There are two other lines like this in the functions `vertex_cut` and `vertex_cover`. I understand you do it to save a line, but is it really worth it (maybe it is and you know why !) ?

2. The output of the function `edge_cut` and `vertex_cut` are either real numbers or lists. Wouldn't it be better to return real numbers or tuple instead ? There is no reason to use a list representation and tuples are closer to the mathematical notation.

3. I changed a variable with name `l` by `label` since the letter `l` looks very much like the number `1`.

4. In the Gomory-Hu function, you have a parameter `vertices` that you state is not useful for the user : doesn't it mean you should remove it ? I understand that you need this parameter for recursion purposes, but the user shouldn't see it ! You should create a private function doing all the work and another public one calling the private one with the initial parameter set accordingly.

That's all for now. The rest seems fine, but I'll pay more attention to it once you've answered. Don't forget to apply my patch on top of yours before making any change !

Hello !!

1. It was indeed just to save a line. At some point, I believed it made the code more readable, as one can directly look at the added constraint, while the "implicit" iterators are written later, but in the end it just looks like a sick way to write it ;-)

2. I really do not mind. So in the end, if you think tuples would be better in this case, this sounds to me like a perfectly good reason to make it so ! ;-)

3. +1

4. Well. I am a bit lazy, and I thought writing a new function, + new docstrings just to avoid one parameter (which appears in the proof of the result, by the way) was a bit too much.. But same thing here : if you think this should be removed, I see no reason why it should stay...

5. Your fixes in the docstrings : I agree with most of them, but I do not know what your way of writing INPUT: sections looks like when the reference is generated. I would like to compare the two :-)

With the comments you made, it sounds like I should rewrite some parts of the code and sen a new patch, merged with the one you sent. Before doing it, can you tell me whether you have "pending" modifications on this patch ? If so, could you update your patch ? I will then take it, mix it with mine, and bring to the code the modifications you requested, but it would not be a good idea to do it now if you are also working on the same parts of the code...

Some questions/comments:

1. You said you merged my patch with yours, but there seems to miss many modifications I did on the docstring. Does it mean that you don't agree with it ?

2. Following 1, I think you should at least add an OUTPUT field, especially for the functions `edge_cut`, `vertex_cut`. It is important that the user knows what he's going to have returned when using your functions.

3. The same comment about returning tuples instead of lists. I agree with you that this is minor, but I think there is a reason why the two data structures exist in Python. Tuples seem more immutable while lists are dynamical. Here, you return fixed things that shouldn't be modified.

4. I insist on the point that the `vertices` parameter should be hidden. I think this is important... the signature of the function is a very important feature to understand what the function does.

If you agree with that and since you've put a lot of work since the beginning, I have no problem at all to change all these by myself.

Another remark : when merging my changes, it's better to create another patch that applies on top of your changes and on mine at the same time. This way, one can visualize more easily what each of us did and when. This can very simply realized with mercurial. You only need to apply, say, the two first patches, and then create a new patch with `hg qnew` that applies on top of both the first patches.

So as soon as you tell me that I can make some changes, I'll do them, but I don't want to work for nothing, so I'll wait till you answer.

Note that I tested the new functions and I agree with what they do, everything works fine, it's just the documentation and some code choices that I want to discuss.

Hello !!!

Here is the patch I should have sent you last time... Actually, I did the job a bit better this time, as I replaced each occurence of the lists [p.add_constraint...] I could find in the code, so there should be none left :-)

It still fixes all doctest bugs, and it splits the gomory_hu function, and it includes your patch, and it should be fine, though as I told you over email I made a mistake when applying the patches and I can not give you, as you asked, a patch to apply on top of yours, but another patch with contains all of it.. :-/

I'll read hg's manual again, just to be sure ;-)

Nathan

I reviewed the patch for what I expect will be the last time ;)

I did the following tests. First, I compiled from source two versions of sage-4.3.3.

Then, I applied the two patches of #7311 on both versions and Nathann's patch for #7288.

On the other hand, I tested both the `sage/numerical` and `sage/graphs` folders with the command `sage -t -optional`. Once again, all tests passed !

Finally, I made some minor changes, touching only the documentation and some comments in the code. I restested all and the results were the same. I also looked at the documentation generated by Sphinx. Everything seemed fine.

To conclude, I give this ticket a positive review, as soon as Nathann confirms he agrees with my changes.

Great work !
