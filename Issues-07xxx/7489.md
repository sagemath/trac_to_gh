I send a proof of concept. It is a class called geogebra_applet that can show geogebra applets and (limited, and only working in ideal conditions now) interact with them.

By default it uses the .jar files of the geogebra site, but another ones can be passed as parameters. It can also be passed a ggb as a parameter to be loaded.

If you want to see what it is capable of doing, do the following:

attach('path-to-sageogebra.py')
A=geogebra_applet()
A.show()
A.eval_command('P = (1,1)')

#11489 about using iframe is also probably relevant, particularly the examples showing Geogebra use from within Sage.  This is not the same as this ticket, since those would depend on an internet connection and don't actually put GG in Sage, but it's still worth mentioning here.
