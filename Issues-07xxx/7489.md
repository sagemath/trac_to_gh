Given its features, maturity, and popularity, we should consider integrating GeoGebra into [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/).

<a id='comment:2'></a>I send a proof of concept. It is a class called geogebra_applet that can show geogebra applets and (limited, and only working in ideal conditions now) interact with them.

By default it uses the .jar files of the geogebra site, but another ones can be passed as parameters. It can also be passed a ggb as a parameter to be loaded.

If you want to see what it is capable of doing, do the following:

attach('path-to-sageogebra.py')
A=geogebra_applet()
A.show()
A.eval_command('P = (1,1)')
