The call `region_plot(2/x + 1/y > 1/x * 1/y, (x,-10,10), (y,-10,10))` passes the following function to setup_for_eval_on_grid: `(y, x) |--> -2/x - 1/y + 1/(x*y)`, but passes the variables in the order (x,y).  The problem is the equify function.  This patch simplifies the code in equify to not try to put an ordering on the variables, but to just pass back an expression (not a function).

In practice, since variables would be substituted by name, I don't think this will make a difference.  But it does make the code cleaner and more correct.

This is not related to this ticket.  The error is caused by a bug in fast_callable--see #7810.

I didn't bother to check, but it seems like this was the concern, or?  At any rate there should be something documented that didn't work before and now does.  Otherwise I don't quite get why we are removing the potential for passing in the variables here.

sage: %time region_plot([y>.3, x>0, x^2+y^2<1], (y,-1.1, 1.1), (x,-.5, 1.1)).show(aspect_ratio=1)
CPU times: user 1.96 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 2.04 s

sage: %time region_plot([y>.3, x>0, x^2+y^2<1], (y,-1.1, 1.1), (x,-.5, 1.1),plot_points=400).show(aspect_ratio=1)

After:

Too bad about mangle_neg, but it was almost more confusing that way than in the code, I think you are right.  

Be sure to include some test where the order of coordinates is switched.  Incidentally, you should also remove the #long time flag from that one test; it only takes one second on my machine, which I don't think counts as a long time any more.  The file takes nearly a half minute to test for me, though!

Other than that, positive review.

The old code gave the correct result too, I think.  I consider this patch more a refactoring of code.  The error that I corrected didn't show up because I think we were more careful in another part of the code.

Looks good.  The use of s and t is good because then it's not so clear to the user from convention which one "should" be horizontal.  Positive review; apply in the order simplify-equify, simplify-negative-code, variable-order.
