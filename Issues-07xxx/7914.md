Attachment: **[trac_7914_rebased_fixed.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7914/trac_7914_rebased_fixed.patch.gz)**

Fixed.  The only change between the new patch and the previous one is line 1076 of modules_with_basis.py, in the `invert` method:

```
-                 domain = self.domain(),               codomain = self.codomain(), 
+                 domain = self.codomain(),             codomain = self.domain(), 
```

Yes, Adrien had noticed this, and was about to fix it in the Sage-Combinat
queue. Since this patch is not yet in Sage, I agree that it's best to
include the fix right away in it. Positive review!
