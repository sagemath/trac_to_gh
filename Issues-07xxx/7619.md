Currently pickling doesn't work for finite word defined by iterator and callable :

```
sage: w = Word(iter('abcdefghijkl'))
sage: loads(dumps(w))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'generator'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.generator failed
```

This is not too hard to support. One just have to expand the iterator to a list  (or a tuple?) and save the list instead:

```
sage: w = Word(iter('abcdefghijkl'))
sage: loads(dumps(w))
word: abcdefghijkl
sage: type(_)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
```

This is more general solution to the problem solved in #7519.

I just uploaded the patch. Pickle is now supported for infinite word defined from a function :

```
sage: w = Word(lambda n:n)
sage: loads(dumps(w))
word: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,...
```

It uses the `pickle_function` and `unpickle_function` (which gives a new utility for `datatype` argument)

```
sage: lambda n:n
<function <lambda> at 0x887e764>
sage: pickle_function(_)
"csage.misc.fpickle\ncode_ctor\np1\n(I1\nI1\nI1\nI67\nS'|\\x00\\x00S'\np2\n(t(t(S'n'\ntp3\nS'<ipython console>'\np4\nS'<lambda>'\np5\nI1\nS''\ntRp6\n."
sage: Word(_, datatype='pickled_function')
word: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,...
```

Since `pickle_function` fails on `CallableFromListOfWords`, those finite words are expanded as a list in order to be saved:

```
sage: w = Word(range(5)) * Word('abcde')
sage: type(w)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_callable_with_caching'>
sage: z = loads(dumps(w))
sage: z
word: 01234abcde
sage: type(z)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
```

Needs review!!

Hello Sebastien. I've taken a look at the patch. Great changes! We can now pickle objects that we could not have pickled before.

The patch applies cleanly to sage-4.3.3 and all tests passed for `make test`.
