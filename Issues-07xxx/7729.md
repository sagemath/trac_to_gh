The attached patch implements Iwahori Hecke algebras. Given a Cartan Type (finite or affine), the Iwahori Hecke algebra is a deformation of the group algebra over the Weyl group. It has generators in bijection with the simple reflections of the Weyl group that satisfy simple quadratic relations of the form `(T_i-q1)*(T_i-q2)` = 0. Often we default q2=-1, q1=q in which case the relation is of the form `T_i^2=(q-1)T_i+q`. The generators also satisfy the braid relations.

Hi Dan!

Thanks much for implementing this very useful feature!

Do you mind renaming it into IwahoriHeckeAlgebraT or TBasis, so that we can
later use IwahoriHeckeAlgebra for the abstract Iwahori Hecke algebra with its other bases?

Other than that, the code looks good, except for the duplication of the CombinatorialFreeModule code. Do you mind if I refactor it to use the category framework and CombinatorialFreeModule?
I am not sure when I'll be able to do that though, so maybe it's best to first get this patch
into Sage. Unless you are tempted by the adventure.

I don't expect particular problems with affine weyl groups or other coxeter groups.

Ah one thing: please make the algebra generators into a family indexed by the index set of the Dynkin diagram (so that T[1], ... ) will do what we expect.

I've revised it so that it works with affine Weyl groups.

I don't mind renaming it IwahoriHeckeAlgebraT but it seems to
me that perhaps other presentations can be handled within this
framework. I think I should leave the refactoring to the
category framework to you.

I will make the algebra generators into a family. When I've
done that I will change the status back to needs review.

I've addressed two out of three of Nicolas' requests, and his
message indicates that the refactoring issue can be postponed.

* The name is now `IwahoriHeckeAlgebraT`

* `self.algebra_generators()` now returns a finite family.

I've changed the status back to needs review.

what other bases do we need? There is the Bernstein Zelevinsky presentation.

I posted a revised version. With this version, the base ring can be either a field
containing q1 and q2, or a LaurentPolynomialRing. The previous version did not
work with LaurentPolynomialRings.

Also, methods were added to
compute inverses of basis elements, a common task. 

Finally, there is a bug fix in
sage.categories.pushout (import PolynomialRing when needed).

-This code is very tested for type A and is almost certainly correct for Weyl groups of finite type. It also works for affine Weyl groups in the most recently posted version.
-
-The following issues remain.
-
-* David Roe suggested that the _coerce_impl method should be removed. I have not looked at this yet.
-
-* Subjectively, it seems a little slow compared with a previous implementation for type A only. This is probably a limitation of the `WeylGroup()` class on which it depends. My earlier implementation was based on Permutation. If it proves unacceptably slow it may be possible to speed it up by a caching scheme.
-
-* Later I may add a method to compute intertwining elements which depend on spectral parameters. These have applications to representations of p-adic groups.
