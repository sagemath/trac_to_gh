The solution is to add 'sage_fortran' to the beginning of the list of fortran compilers on the cygwin line in src/numpy/distutils/fcompiler/__init__.py

trac_7321-1.patch appears to already be part of numpy-1.3.0.p2 and I won't comment on it.

trac_7321-2.patch appears to be correct and I'll give it a positive review.

OTOH, comparing numpy-1.3.0p2.spkg in sage-4.3 with mhansen/numpy-1.3.0.p3.spkg shows a number of other differences which shouldn't be present:
* Various emacs backup files (*~) exist
* Various *.pyc files exist
* patches/cygwin-core-setup.py has been copied to src/numpy/core/setup.py
* patches/!__init!__.py has been copied to src/numpy/distutils/fcompiler/!__init!__.py
* patches/gnu.py has been copied to src/numpy/distutils/fcompiler/gnu.py
* patches/cygwin-lapack_lite-setup.py has been copied to src/numpy/linalg/setup.py
* src/site.cfg exists
* src/build exists
Overall, your numpy-1.3.0.p3.spkg needs rerolling to only include the changes in trac_7321-2.patch
