To avoid confusion, we should add a message to the top of each **old** Sage notebook .py file stating that one should work on [SageNB](http://nb.sagemath.org/) instead.

This should be a patch to the core Sage library.

```
This file is part of the OLD Sage notebook and is NOT actively developed,
maintained, or supported.  As of Sage v4.1.2, all notebook development has
moved to the separate Sage Notebook project:

http://nb.sagemath.org/

The new notebook is installed in Sage as a spkg (e.g., sagenb-0.3.spkg).

Please visit the project's home page for more information, including directions on
obtaining the latest source code.  For notebook-related development and support,

Since the code isn't being run and is officially "deprecated", one option is to put a nodoctest.py file in the directory (or #nodoctest at the top of the file) so that the code isn't tested.
