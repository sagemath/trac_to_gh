This is used by PIL (c.f. #7273). Inclusion as an optional or even as a standard package would be helpful.

There is an extra file, SPKG.txt~, in the package.

I don't know if this should block its inclusion (I think this should go in as an optional package ASAP so it gets wider testing) but the show function doesn't work on my intel mac, 10.4.11, opening a TIFF file:

```
sage: import Image
sage: im = Image.open("/Users/mh/Pictures/psym.tiff")
sage: print im.format, im.size, im.mode
TIFF (455, 495) 1
sage: im.show()
sage: dyld: Symbol not found: __cg_jpeg_resync_to_restart
  Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO

A few points looking at spkg-install, which is overly complicated following recent updates to sage-env. 

* The recent changes to sage-env (#7818) will mean a **lot** of spkg-install can be removed. In particular most, if not all the SAGE64 stuff, as sage-env will automatically add the right flags to CFLAGS, CXFLAGS etc for a 64-bit build. It will not do this (yet) for LDFLAGS so it **may** be necessary to add that, but I'm not convinced it will be necessary. It needs testing on bsd.math without the LD flags set. If it builds, then forgot it all. If it needs LDFLAGS to have -m64, replace -m64 with 

```
if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ] ; then
  LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS $CFLAG64" 
  export $LDFLAGS
fi
```
then it will work irrespective of the flag needed to generate 64-bit binaries. (Not all compilers need -m64, as others use -q64 and other flags). I'm not totally convinced LDFLAGS ever needs -m64, as I believe LDFLAGS gets passed to the linker. No linker I am aware of has the -m64 option (check GNU binutils manual if you wish). But I'm not 100% sure it is never needed. I think the right flag if needed is -64 for the GNU linker, but it is rarely needed, as normally the linker can work out whether a 32 or 64 bit binary is needed, based on the object files. The exception is when creasting shared libraries from archives, where the linker may not be able to determine this.
* Remove the checks for the Sun compiler and adding -Wall with gcc. The updates to sage-env will add the -Wall for you with gcc. 
* Remove the checks to see if there is a mix of Sun and GNU compilers - that is taken care of elsewhere now. 

* Unless there is good reason, remove the 

```
: ${CP=cp}; CP="$CP -f"; export CP
: ${MV=mv}; MV="$MV -f"; export MV
: ${RM=rm}; RM="$RM -f"; export RM
```
as it was agreed recently (see sage-devel) that there is no need for there to be variables for very basic commands. However, if the source code makes use of $CP etc, then they might have to stay. But if possible, just use mv, cp etc. 

* Someting called 'CC' is used here. I'm not sure what that is, but be aware the Sun C++ compiler is called 'CC' so there might be a name clash. Make sure the absolute path to CC is specified if it's not already done, otherwise it may break if the Sun C++ compiler is in the path. 

* Give me a day or so, and I'll put on sage-devel a **considerably** simpler skeleton spkg-install which will remove 95% of this. 

It does actually build on Solaris, but the spkg-install could be reduced considerably in size, as most of these checks are now done in once place. 

I'll help you do this.

Attachment: **[spkg-install.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7344/spkg-install.gz)**

I've looked at this, and have attached a revised spkg-install, which is a lot simpler. However, there are some odd things about this. 

* Why is the package called libjpeg-7.p1, rather than libjpeg-7 ? The .p0 is appended when a patch is applied, .p1 is used when a second patch is applied. This would therefore imply it's been patched twice, whereas in fact it has not. 
* There is no need for a patches directory when there are no patches.
* What is the purpose of this code 

```
: ${CP=cp}; CP="$CP -f"; export CP
: ${MV=mv}; MV="$MV -f"; export MV
: ${RM=rm}; RM="$RM -f"; export RM
```

I just took the libjpeg source code, then built it with:

```
$ ./configure --prefix=/tmp
$ make 
$ make install
```
and it all went ok, without me having to override 'cp', 'mv' or 'rm'. 

* You would need to get William or someone else to look over the license. I know there is one requirement there, which is not a requirement of the GPL. That is, if you use their code, you must acknowledge them. Having had some GPL'ed code of mine ripped off without acknowledgment, I was a bit annoyed, but I've been told there is no requirement to acknowledge anyone if you use their GPL code. I am not a lawyer are more interested in the technical aspects than license conditions, but someone would need to verify this license is compatible. 

In the attacked in spkg-install I've left all the overriding of cp, but I don't feel it should be necessary. 

Dave

New package version here: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/timdumol/libjpeg-7.p2.spkg

As stated in #7818, some makefiles depend on $RM being unset or set to "rm -f". The above code overrides any $RM setting, which otherwise causes compilation failure (at least for me).

I am unsure of the GPL compatibility of libjpeg's licensing, but this message on: http://www.mail-archive.com/mozilla-license@mozilla.org/msg00143.html seems to suggest that it is widely considered GPL compatible. Otherwise, we may want to consider libjpeg-turbo (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo/) and patch PIL to use that.

Regarding review of this package:

The package may be reviewed by using the PIL package, as above:

```
sage: import Image
sage: im = Image.open("<your-jpeg-file-here>")
sage: im.resize((im.size[0]/2,im.size[1]/2))
sage: print im.format, im.size, im.mode
TIFF (455, 495) 1
sage: im.show()
sage: im.save("wherever.jpg")
```

There's a much simpler way to unset RM than use

```
: ${RM=rm}; RM="$RM -f"; export RM
```

one can use:

```
unset RM
```

If a Makefile needs RM set, I feel it would be better to fix the Makefile and report that upstream. Likewise if a Makefile needs `rm -f`, it should use `rm -f`

Hmmm, the error is just that `nasm` doesn't produce 64-bit object files by default. (`configure` should notice that, and use `-fmacho64` instead of `-fmacho`.)

John, did you set `SAGE64=yes`?

Haven't yet looked if there are further `configure` options (`./configure --help` doesn't show appropriate ones), or what happens if `nasm` isn't installed. (Guess it then just defaults to C implementations rather than using GCC with inline assembly; MacOS X / XCode doesn't have a `gas` IIRC.)

Btw., there's crap in the spkg, and I can't read the Mercurial files:

```sh
$ ls -a

..  .hgignore  .hgignore.swp  .spkg-install.swp  .SPKG.txt.swp
$ hg log ; hg status
abort: requirement 'dotencode' not supported!
abort: requirement 'dotencode' not supported!
```

Also, unfortunately Tim has deleted the old "patches" that were applied on MacOS X

```sh
# This was needed for libjpeg. Is this needed for libjpeg-turbo?
#if [ -n "`uname -s | grep Darwin`" ]; then
#   $CP ../patches/config.sub .
#   $CP ../patches/config.guess .
#   # Required for Mac OS (http://jetfar.com/libjpeg-and-python-imaging-pil-on-snow-leopard/)
#   ./configure --enable-shared --enable-static --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL"
#else
./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL"
#fi
```
though that's not necessarily the problem.

> John, did you set SAGE64=yes?

I hadn't, because with OS X 10.6 on 64-bit machines, it shouldn't be necessary.  I just tried it anyway, and got the same result.

The file BUILDING.txt in the src directory says this:

```
-- NASM
   * 0.98, or 2.01 or later is required for a 32-bit build
   * NASM 2.00 or later is required for a 64-bit build
   * NASM 2.07 or later is required for a 64-bit build on OS X.  This can be
     obtained from MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).
```
The default version of nasm seems to be 0.98.40, or at least that's what I have installed.  The same file also says this; perhaps this is the way to go:

```
32-bit Library Build on 64-bit OS X
-----------------------------------

Add

  CFLAGS='-O3 -m32' LDFLAGS=-m32

to the configure command line.
```
If I configure with those options, it seems to succeed.  That is, I ran "sage -sh", then changed to the directory `sage/spkg/build/libjpeg_turbo-1.1.1/src` and ran

```
CFLAGS='-O3 -m32' LDFLAGS=-m32 ./configure --prefix=/Applications/sage/local
```
Then `make` succeeded.  I haven't tried `make install` or testing it inside of Sage.

I wonder if it builds (on MacOS X) without assembly parts (perhaps with `--without-simd` passed to `configure`), as I mentioned above.

(You could also try temporarily "removing" `nasm` by renaming it to something obscure and then run `./configure`.)

If `libjpeg` stays an optional package, we could of course also add an optional `nasm` package (if the licence allows this), but I won't add more (binary?) standard spkgs just to accomplish prerequisites. Fortran is IMHO bad enough.

Or we have to resort to some other (upstream) `libjpeg` package.

I think we should simply check whether `nasm` is installed (`command -v nasm >/dev/null`), and if so, its version (`nasm -v`), and then -- depending on the operating system (especially 32-bit vs. 64-bit on Darwin) -- decide whether we configure with `--without-simd` or not.

This should work on all platforms, and this way machines having (at least) the required version installed won't suffer from not using faster implementations.

If `SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`, we should perhaps disable it too.

According to the docs, it might also be necessary to either pass `--build=...` or update the **very old** `config.guess`, at least on / for 64-bit Darwin (MacOS X >=10.6, or 10.5 if `SAGE64=yes`). Maybe setting `ABI` accordingly also works.

... if we really want to install any executables as well.

Using them from Sage would certainly be inefficient, and `local/bin/` is already filled up with a lot of .... useful tools.

There is a discussion of the libjpeg-turbo license by the main developer (I think) here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo/forums/forum/1086868/topic/4519797

It's definitely "licensed under GPL".   However, it seems to be licensed under a subset of LGPL, which would definitely be GPL compatible.
