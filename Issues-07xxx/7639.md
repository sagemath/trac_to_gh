Address refers to a network interface. So perhaps we can change address to interface, but continue accepting address for backwards compatibility? Something like this in the docstring:

```
            - ``interface``       -- (default: 'localhost'), address of network
              interface to listen on; give '' to listen on all interfaces. You may 
              use ``address`` here for backwards compatibility, but this is deprecated
              and will be removed in the future.
