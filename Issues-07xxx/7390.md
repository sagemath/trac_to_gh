It would be useful to have a HTML report summarizing the results of Sage Notebook tests, including the output and traceback, if any, of each test.

We can begin with the notebook's functional test suites (cf. #7343), but we could add doctests, eventually.  And with a backend server, we might select, run, and monitor tests remotely.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Note: The patches depend on #7343.  Please apply parts A *and* B, in order.  To test the test report generator, try

```python
sage: from sagenb.testing.run_tests import run_and_report; run_and_report()
```
This should run the notebook's Selenium test suite, generate and write a self-contained `report.html`, and open the report in `SAGE_BROWSER`.

Remarks:

* Part A adds [HTMLTestRunner](http://tungwaiyip.info/software/HTMLTestRunner.html).
* Part B makes significant changes to `HTMLTestRunner.py` and sets up the test runner for sagenb.
* The runner captures all output, e.g., we can display information from passing tests, too.

To do, but not necessarily in this ticket:

* Stabilize the results table's column widths, especially when toggling tracebacks.
* Support multiple results tables.
* Use the runner to display doctest results.
* Use a backend server to select, run, and monitor live tests.
