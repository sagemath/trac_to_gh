It would be useful to have a HTML report summarizing the results of Sage Notebook tests, including the output and traceback, if any, of each test.

We can begin with the notebook's functional test suites (cf. #7343), but we could add doctests, eventually.  And with a backend server, we might select, run, and monitor tests remotely.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

Note: The patches depend on #7343.  Please apply parts A *and* B, in order.  To test the test report generator, try

```python
sage: from sagenb.testing.run_tests import run_and_report; run_and_report()
```
This should run the notebook's Selenium test suite, generate and write a self-contained `report.html`, and open the report in `SAGE_BROWSER`.

Remarks:

* Part A adds [HTMLTestRunner](http://tungwaiyip.info/software/HTMLTestRunner.html).
* Part B makes significant changes to `HTMLTestRunner.py` and sets up the test runner for sagenb.
* The runner captures all output, e.g., we can display information from passing tests, too.

To do, but not necessarily in this ticket:

* Stabilize the results table's column widths, especially when toggling tracebacks.
* Support multiple results tables.
* Use the runner to display doctest results.
* Use a backend server to select, run, and monitor live tests.

Doctesting *may* be straightforward.  Given `foo.py`, `sage-doctest` preparses its triple-quoted blocks and writes them as docstrings of `example_*` functions in `.doctest_foo.py`.  This file calls on itself a subclass of `doctest.DocTestRunner`.  Since Python's [doctest](http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html) module can also generate [unittests](http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html), we can "replace" the end of `.doctest_foo.py` with, e.g.,

```
if __name__ ==  '__main__':
    from sagenb.testing.run_tests import run_and_report
    import doctest
    run_and_report(doctest.DocTestSuite())
    sys.exit(0)
```
Although the test names `example_*` are not informative, `sage -python .doctest_foo_mod.py` runs the tests and makes a report!
