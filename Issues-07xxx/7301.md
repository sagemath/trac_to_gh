The Gale-Ryser theorem is about filling a matrix with 0 and 1 when you know the number of 0 and 1 in each column and in each row. 

It would not be too much work to write in Sage a function filling a matrix with 0 and 1 when the data is correct, and returning an error otherwise...

Hi there,

There is something I don't get in the doc:

```
The Gale Ryser theorem asserts that if `p_1,p_2` are two 
partitions of `n` of respective lengths `k_1,k_2`, then there is 
a binary `k_1\times k_2` matrix `M` such that `p_1` is the vector 
of row sums and `p_2` is the vector of column sums of `M`, if 
and only if `p_2` dominates `p_1`.
```
I suggest that the role of `p_1` and `p_2` are not symmetric... Is this really a "if and only if" ? If you transpose the matrix then the role of `p_1` and `p_2` are exchanged... Or dominate is not the same as dominance order...

Am I definitely confused ???

Again in the theory of symmetric function and descent algebra of the symmetric group, it is useful not to give a single solution but to give all of them, without restricting et entries of the matrix to be smaller than one (i.e. any non negative integer). Moreover the order of the input is important so that I'd rather have the input to be composition rather than partition. However I don't know if in this case we need a different enumeration algorithm. You can have a look at  http://mupad-combinat.sourceforge.net/doc/en/combinat/integerMatrices.html
to see what we had in MuPAD-Combinat.

Hello everybody !!! Well, concerning the wording issue, I believe that it is correct in this case, or that at least it depends on communities, especially, when one looks at the code : "the conjugate of p2 dominates p1" is written "p2.conjugate().dominates(p1), so surely I am not the only one to give these definitions to these words :-)

The other issue seems for you to expect more than just a solution : you are both talking about the complete enumeration of the matrices corresponding to these criteria, and through Linear Programming I can olny give you a simple solution, as solvers are not that bright on the enumeration side... Would you happen to have a reference for this algorithm ? I was onnly able to find a proof to show one matrix existed, but nothing about enumerating them. I also have to admit that if writing this function was quick enough because I knew what I needed and how to use it, I may not have enough time available too look for a new ( and possibly long ) algorithm and implement it.

Do you feel like this algorithm is totally useless as it is, or could it be possible to take this function and create a ticket to move it to a enumeration problem ?

Besides, your friend was talking about "different subsets of numbers". Well, I only met this problem for 0-1 matrices and I assume your are not talking about replacing 0 by x and 1 by y... Do you mean that there is a version of this theorem working simultaneously for several types of different variables (with two partitions per type of variable, etc...)  ?? This would interest me very much !!

Thank you for your interest !

No, I think this is a useful patch. Also, I agree that the enumeration problem is a separate ticket. I am not an expert, so to review your patch, which I think is interesting, I am told to read

```
Combinatorial Matrix Theory
by Brualdi and Ryser, Chapter 6

Combinatorial Matrix Classes
By Brualdi (I think this has a whole chapter on A(R,S), the 
set of (0,1)-matrices with prescribed row sums R and col sums S.

Combinatorial Mathematics
By Ryser (has a chapter on A(R,S))
```
They shouldn't take long to read but I don't own these and will 
have to make a trip to the library, which I will try to do tomorrow.
 
I was also told of a very interesting application of the Gale-Ryser
theorem to medical imaging (which you may already know about):

Yes, he indicated that a very simple modification of the construction should 
allow one to construct matrices whose entries are in (say) {0,1, ..., m-1}, 
with give column sums and given row sums if one exists. (Here m > 1 is
a user-supplied integer which is m=2 in your current implementation.)

I will submit my code to my colleague, who does not use Sage 
or know how to program (as far as I know) but can read Python:-)

He already said that you have implemented Gale's algorithm, and
I have implemented Ryser. He does not agree that your implementation
should be replaced by mine. Perhaps we make my implementation
the default since it seems "more elementary" than yours? 

More later when I receive his report.

Sorry, dumb question.

This is what I should have asked: The condition

```
       if sum(p1) != sum(p2):
            raise ValueError("The two partitions must sum to the same value.")
```
should be replaced by a condition on p1 and the *conjugate* of p2,
shouldn't it?

Well, the condition on the domination of p* may be fulfilled while the  two partitions do not sum to the same value, which is clearly necessary, so we need the two conditions to be checked ( and summing the fastest of the two )...

well, actually I thought after out little chat that we should forget about the LP version and implement yours when you will have found the time to write it.

It's up to you ! :-)

Python has a mechanism for "private" functions like slider01, so
I renamed it _slider01. I think that is better than hiding it inside
gale_ryser_theorem. Is that okay?

I think this will not work, if you want to allow trailing 0's.
Maybe I am missing something?

I was told that by my colleague which is much much more of an expert on
this stuff. I have not read Gale's paper and don't know of an electronic version.

Thank you for the reference! I think the docstrings are okay now.

Well, do you think slider01 could be used by ither methods ?

> I think this will not work, if you want to allow trailing 0's.

The Gale-Ryser theorem tells you that given two partitions, there is a matrix satisfying the constraints if and only if the domination criterion is checked. Well, the point you made about trailing 0's is that you do not necessarily want the column's sums in your final matrix to be *sorted in decreasing order*. When you have a binary matrix, though, you can modify it by inverting two columns without changin the rows sums, and the columns sum still have the same set of sums. So instead of just taking care of trailing 0, the best may be to take care of non-sorted sequences, which is the general case of the theorem.

Then the best is to :
* Cite the reference to justify the names Gale's method and Ryser's method
* Alternatively, use algorithm="LP" instead of Gale, as we can not say more without references ( plus it gives some enlightenment as to the algorithm used and the complexity )

<div id="comment:32" align="right">comment:32</div>

New version, after some emails exchanged :

* The function is_gale_ryser does not apply only to "partitions"
anymore, but to any sequence of integers. The purpose of the
Gale-Ryser theorem is to answer whether there exists a matrix with the
given row/column sums, which has nothing to do with Partitions, or
decreasings orders, or zeros, or anything else -- just positive
values. The function is_gale ryser only takes two integer lists as its
arguments, and answers yes if there exists a matrix satisfying the
constraints.

* There is a new section ALGORITHM in is_gale_ryser

* Various fixes in the docstrings

* gale_ryser_theorem has been slightly modified to accept unordered
sequences, and zeros. It involves marking a sorted copy of the list
without the zeros, using the algorithm you implemented, then add the
empty rows/columns and apply the reverse of the permutation applied by
the sorting.

* Your comments made me think again about this definition inside a
definition.... In the end I got convinced it was a very ugly way to
code and do not intend to say anything about it again :-)
