After #7490, we give the function object as the first argument to
custom methods of symbolic functions. The function that prints integrals
is _integrate_latex_() on line 1556 of sage/calculus/calculus.py. It
gets the function integrate as a first argument, and prints the
nonsense reported above.

...and it does, on 4.3.1. The code looks good, all doctests pass, and the problem is fixed.
