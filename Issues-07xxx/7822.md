After changes in #7490 to sage.symbolic.pynac.py_log, symbolic log function cannot handle float arguments <= 0:

```
sage: from sage.functions.log import function_log

This looks nice, but causes a serious speed regression:

BEFORE:

```
sage: %timeit ln(complex(-1))
10000 loops, best of 3: 29 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(complex(-1))
10000 loops, best of 3: 43.2 µs per loop
```

AFTER:

```
sage: %timeit ln(complex(-1))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.47 ms per loop
sage: %timeit log(complex(-1))
100 loops, best of 3: 1.47 ms per loop
```

Can this be fixed easily?

Before:

```
sage: %timeit t = ln(float(-1))
1000 loops, best of 3: 285 µs per loop
sage: %timeit t = ln(float(1))
100000 loops, best of 3: 17.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit t = ln(complex(1))
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.25 µs per loop
sage: %timeit t = ln(complex(1,1))
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit t = ln(complex(1,-1))
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.42 µs per loop

After:

```

sage: %timeit t = ln(complex(0))
100000 loops, best of 3: 15.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit t = ln(complex(-1))
100000 loops, best of 3: 15.1 µs per loop
```

Re [comment:3](#comment%3A3):

The top level log function is a regular python function which handles precision, etc. Calling that in the doctest is not really testing the `Function_log` defined in `sage/functions/log.py`. If we want people to move away from using `ln`, we should deprecate it. Since the last discussion about this topic ended up by concluding we should even support printing `ln` instead of `log`, I don't see that happening soon.
