After changes in #7490 to sage.symbolic.pynac.py_log, symbolic log function cannot handle float arguments <= 0:

```
sage: from sage.functions.log import function_log

This looks nice, but causes a serious speed regression:

BEFORE:

```
sage: %timeit ln(complex(-1))
10000 loops, best of 3: 29 µs per loop
sage: %timeit log(complex(-1))
10000 loops, best of 3: 43.2 µs per loop
```

AFTER:

```
sage: %timeit ln(complex(-1))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.47 ms per loop
sage: %timeit log(complex(-1))
100 loops, best of 3: 1.47 ms per loop
```

Can this be fixed easily?

Before:

```
sage: %timeit t = ln(float(-1))
1000 loops, best of 3: 285 µs per loop
sage: %timeit t = ln(float(1))
100000 loops, best of 3: 17.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit t = ln(complex(1))
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.25 µs per loop
sage: %timeit t = ln(complex(1,1))
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.4 µs per loop

sage: %timeit t = ln(complex(-1))
100000 loops, best of 3: 15.1 µs per loop
```

Re [comment:3](#comment:3):

The top level log function is a regular python function which handles precision, etc. Calling that in the doctest is not really testing the `Function_log` defined in `sage/functions/log.py`. If we want people to move away from using `ln`, we should deprecate it. Since the last discussion about this topic ended up by concluding we should even support printing `ln` instead of `log`, I don't see that happening soon.

All works okay, and after careful checking the patch seems correct, modulo my weak understanding of Cython.  I'll go ahead and put positive review, but someone please stop me if the whole PY_TYPE_CHECK stuff is not right.

To Burcin: In general, it would be very helpful if you could put a specific link to the changeset in Pynac (in the online hg server) which corresponds to each fix of a Sage issue.
