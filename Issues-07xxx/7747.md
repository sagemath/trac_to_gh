With Sage 4.3.rc0, I get a few doctest failures from sage/doc, at least one of which is related to #7406.  The attached patch fixes them.  It also reinstates some doctests which were disabled until #5338 was fixed.

Oh, and it also changes a `.. math` block to match the actual LaTeX output from Sage.

I'm marking this as a blocker since without it, there are doctest failures.
