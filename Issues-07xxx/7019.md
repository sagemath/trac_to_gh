Updating to biopython-1.52, which was released September 22, 2009.  Main improvements were to alignment and sequence file conversion, population genetics statistics, and the Bio.SeqIO.indexed_dict() for handling large numbers of sequences.

Here is an example that will not work with previous biopython packages:

```
sage: import urllib2 as U
sage: f = U.urlopen('http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/examples/ls_orchid.gbk')
sage: orchidfile = file(DATA+"ls_orchid.gbk",'w')
sage: orchidfile.write(f.read())
sage: orchidfile.close()
sage: f.close()
sage: from Bio import SeqIO
sage: orchid_dict = SeqIO.index(DATA+"ls_orchid.gbk", "genbank")
sage: print 'Number of records: ' + str(len(orchid_dict))
sage: orchid_dict.keys()
sage: seq_record = orchid_dict["Z78475.1"]
sage: print 'Description: ' + seq_record.description
sage: seq_record.seq

Number of records: 94
Description: P.supardii 5.8S rRNA gene and ITS1 and ITS2 DNA.
Seq('CGTAACAAGGTTTCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGGAAGGATCATTGTTGAGATCACAT...GGT', IUPACAmbiguousDNA())
```

The program itself looks nice but the package does not seem to conform to the guidelines at http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html. 

For example:
* no hg repository
* no src directory: there is a source directory and then a link to it. 
* missing parts in the SPKG.txt (Description,License,Upstream Contact)
* this package does have it's own test suite so a spkg-check would also be nice

Do you have time or should I work on it? 

Cheers,
Adam

Some suggestions. ;-)

SPKG.txt

```
== Description ==

Biopython is a set of freely available tools for biological computation written in Python by an international team of developers.

It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and applications which address the needs of current and future work in bioinformatics.

spkg-check (keeping biopython as directory name)

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ "$SAGE_LOCAL" = "" ]; then
   echo "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting";
   echo "Maybe run 'sage -sh'?"
   exit 1
fi

cd biopython
python setup.py test

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
   echo "Error testing biopython"
   exit 1
fi
```

I hope this is useful,

I'm a little confused on how to use the spkg-check script, but that's not your fault I think.  I will write to sage-devel about that.  I just haven't used such a script before.
