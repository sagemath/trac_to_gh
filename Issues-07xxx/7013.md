The goal of this ticket is to add an implementation of Andrew Booker's table-based prime counting algorithm to Sage.  An optional spkg with the largest and densest available tables of counts of primes and prime k-tuplets will be made available.  Smaller tables may be made available in a standard spkg.

Currently you can download the newest code and tables from http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kstueve/prime_pi_tables/table_based_prime_pi_31Dec2011.  You have to apply the patch to Sage-4.7.2 and manually move the tables to SAGE_ROOT/data.  Currently the code doesn't work on all systems because of trouble enabling OpenMP, but it does work on Macs.

Hi Kevin,

you posted a *.lzma-compressed file. On my Mac, neither 7-zip installs out of the box (seems to be MS Windows-only, see http://www.7-zip.org/), nor do I intend to install DarwinPorts or Fink, which contain packages to unpack such files, nor did I find some standalone *.dmg for OS X by googling some minutes around. So I'm unable to unpack this file on my computer.

Sorry, but that's a problem of your patch, not of my system installation. Patches in trac are supposed to be created by hg/mercurial and to apply seamlessly to Sage, or you should provide a link (!) to some file in *.spkg format, or both. Did you read the respective parts of the "Sage Programming Guide", by the way?

From what you write in the sage-devel thread ("Be sure to use the -m32 option when compiling the c code ...") it seems that (some C part of) your code lacks anyway build scripts that work "out of the box" on each of the platforms supported by Sage. For a start, have a look at the "Cliquer.spkg" already in Sage, or at the "Frobby.spkg", not yet in Sage due to build problems on Solaris (see trac ticket #6416), in case your C code is rather "external" to the Sage library.

On the other hand, if your code is intended to "go directly into the Sage library", you need anyway to tell the then-necessary Cython bridge how to compile your code correctly (see module_list.py). And probably some database integration, if I understand correctly what you want to do.

Better still, drop the necessity of "-m32" by using, in your code, fixed-sized C types like "uint32_t" from (ISO/ANSI C99) stdlib.h (wich exists even for msvc, although provided by third parties), and not plain "int"/"long"/... if your algorithm depends on that. But without being able to even have a single look at your code, I'll stop here.

And please, please, don't post MB-sized compressed files into trac itself, but rather post links to some accessible webspace instead. I did that myself for one of my first patches for Sage, and got pretty washed my head (see trac ticket #4857, if you want to), the file itself being erased from trac by the admin almost immediately ... (the reason is that trac is best used "text-based", and any compressed blob has to remain in there for eternity, which is bad for both size-archive-backup issues, and performance).

Heads up! ;-)


Cheers,
Georg

GeorgSWeber, I don't currently use Windows.  I made the lzma file on Ubuntu.  I am currently unable to single-handedly make build scripts for my code, because I don't have access to systems with every possible operating system on which Sage might be run.  Someone with access to different environments could help with the build script for their platform.

Note: On 64bit Ubuntu on an Acer I get the following with Silva's code without using -m32 and installing special packages for 32bit mode.  Can anyone see how to make this better?
static void *get_memory(u32 size)
{
 u32 m;

 line 100:m = (u32)malloc(size + 255); // this assumes that
sizeof(void *) = sizeof(u32)
 line 101:if((void *)m == NULL)
   exit(1);
 m = (m + 255) & ~255;
 line 104:return (void *)m; // pointer aligned on a 256 byte boundary
}

~/Documents/Silva$ bash compile
Silva.c: In function ‘get_memory’:
Silva.c:100: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
Silva.c:101: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size

Please note that the Silva c and LMO c code work fine without any special compiler options or libraries on a MacBookPro.  The Silva c code works on 64bit Ubuntu when the proper -m32 compiler option is specified and a library is installed that allows 32 bit mode (just Google the error you get without it).  The LMO c code on 64 bit Ubuntu I believe requires the -m32 flag and additional libraries for 32 bit mode.

Currently, my Python code calls Silva's code and the LMO code from the command line using the subprocess module.

Hi Kevin,

I won't be able to respond on a daily basis because I'm quite busy right now. But concerning the above code snippet, one might use the ANSI C99 type "uintptr_t" instead, since you obviously want to cast pointer values to integer values back and forth. (I can't judge right now, whether you really must do this, but that's another topic.)

Using "uintptr_t" would also very benefical in light of portability to native Windows 64bit. Sage will not be able to support this platform (well, any Windows platform) for a while, but it is a goal definitely on the road map.

Since on 64 bit platforms (e.g. on OS X 10.6, Ubuntu, Fedora, Suse, ...) we need to build Sage with "-m64", and it is not a good idea to mix "-m32" and "-m64", we should try hard to smooth this out of the code itself.

Cheers, Georg

Hi Kevin,

to continue, we firstly need some fundamental design decisions.

As I understand it (please correct me, if I'm wrong), your code resp. its functionality depends on C code written by T. Oliveira e Silva. (BTW, I like the original name "prime_sieve.c" as given on "http://www.ieeta.pt/~tos/software/prime_sieve.html" better than "Silva.c".) This is only one rather small C file, but nevertheless --- Sage is written in Python/Cython, not C. Currently, you compile this C code into an executable, which is called more or less directly from the command line (piping input and output). To include this C code (resp. its functionality) into Sage, I see (at least) four options:

1.) Keep the interfacing via commandline call --- this would mean that we need to stick this code into its own spkg

2.) Make a shared/dynamic library out of the C code, sitting in/installed by its own spkg, and write a small Cython wrapper, that links this library in --- interfacing is no longer done via command line, but via function call

3.) Write a small Cython wrapper, in order to interface via function call, and stick the bulk of the C code into the corresponding Cython extension (via "module_list.py" magic) as an external C file

4.) Rewrite it completely in Cython

Once this decision is made for the prime sieve C code of T. Oliveira e Silva, it has to be made again for the Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko "lmonew" parts from Victor Miller, which also are written in plain C. If a new spkg is created at all, it also could be placed there (either as another standalone executable to be compiled, or as another library).

I have posted a patch, the prime tables need to be placed in SAGE_ROOT/data/prime_pi_tables, I have them at [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ohanar/prime_pi/prime_pi_tables.tar](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ohanar/prime_pi/prime_pi_tables.tar)

A few things that need to be resolved still:

1.) I have not been able to fix the LMO code to compile across platforms (currently not included in the patch), we need to decide whether we want to include this code or cap at `10**16`.

2.) The li_approx file is still included, Kevin I am not sure what method is being used in it, but if we can use the sage Li function, that would be preferable.

I'm glad that things are moving on!

Technically, there are various open points, e.g. the line 105 of the modified da Silva code

```
m = (unsigned long) malloc(size + 255); // this assumes that sizeof(void *) = sizeof(u32) 
```
still looks suspicious to me w.r.t. 64bit platforms, since there, sizeof(void *) usually is sizeof(u64). It might be benefical to do something like

```
m = calloc(size/(64*sizeof(void *)), 64*sizeof(void *))
```
and we haven't even discussed the memory leakage question yet, since all this "bucket" memory is never explicitly freed again ... (important if we want to use the code as a library). Let alone "exit 1;" (line 107) in case of memory shortage being suboptimal in a Sage subroutine.

Andrew (ohanar),

I obtained the li_approx code via a personal communication (email) from Fredrik Johansson, owner of the mpmath project.  It computes an approximation to the logarithmic integral using an asymptotic series.  You can also find it described at

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_integral_function#Asymptotic_expansion

I first used the Sage Li function, but switched to this one because it is orders of magnitude faster.  The Sage Li function spends unnecessary cycles calculating Li out to many decimal places.  For this application, we can stop at the decimal point, because we only need an approximation.  Note that the calculation of an exact value of li would probably use the series representation of li rather than the asymptotic series.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_integral_function#Series_representation

For large computations, the difference in time between Li and li_approx is negligible compared to the total computation time.  However, for small computations, the saved time could be the limiting factor in the time complexity of this algorithm.  This is especially apparent when generating the tables.  Because speed is one of the most important factors in this program, I strongly advocate keeping li_approx rather than using Sage's exact Li.  IMHO,the simplicity of calling a preexisting library function simply does not outweigh the time trade-off of using the asymptotic series.  If anything, I would want some sort of fast li_approx to be made a permanent part of the Sage function library, as it would be useful for number theory research.  If using exist parts of the Sage library is desired over using new code, it might be possible to optimize small prime_pi calculations to not depend on li, but I see this as very unnecessary extra work.

If the sage-devel team decides that they want to use Li for its simplicity over the asymptotic series provided by Fredrik Johansson (actually in any case), I would like to stress the importance of using the same prime_pi approximation function (whether li_exact or li_approx) when generating the tables and when using them.  It is absolutely critical that every detail, including but not limited to rounding versus truncating and what the last included term of the series is is exactly the same in both calculations (generating the table and using it).

For everyone involved I would like to mention to be careful about confusing the logarithmic integral and offset logarithmic integral.

For everyone to read, here is a link to my writeup (I also created an attachment):

http://www.wstein.org/projects/stueve.pdf

After the code is added to Sage, I intend to submit the paper (most likely with revisions/additions) for publication.  As Andrew is taking part in the development of the code and sharing authorship, I believe it would be appropriate for myself, Andrew Ohana, and William Stein to share authorship of both the code added to Sage and the paper submitted for publication.

Kevin,

I agree that the built in Li function is slower, my tests:

Built in Li:

```
sage: timeit('prime_pi(10**16)')
625 loops, best of 3: 809 µs per loop
sage: time prime_pi(10**16-10**10)
CPU times: user 56.95 s, sys: 0.42 s, total: 57.37 s
Wall time: 57.41 s
279238071526960
```

Using li_approx:

```
sage: timeit('prime_pi(10**16)')
625 loops, best of 3: 22.3 µs per loop
sage: time prime_pi(10**16-10**10)
CPU times: user 57.10 s, sys: 0.40 s, total: 57.50 s
Wall time: 57.54 s
279238071948684
```

I don't know if the li_approx is necessary, while for certain values we have a magnitude of difference in complexity, we still are running fast enough, and the values where time actually matters changing to Li has little effect. We would need to fix the offset, but that shouldn't change the runtime noticeably. If you still want to use a li_approx, I would suggest creating a li module, and include arbitrary digit precision.



George,

 
I am not very familiar with C, I know that on most platforms `sizeof(long) == sizeof(void *)`, but I don't believe this is true on all platforms, so we might want to check the declaration of `m` as well. I'm unsure what your comment on the tables was all about, to me SAGE_ROOT/data seemed to be the most appropriate place to put them. Given my relatively limited knowledge of C, I would be hesitant to join a maintenance team, but placing prime_sieve into a spkg is clearly ideal, so if I am needed I can join (although, I don't know how much help I would be).

Take care,
Andrew

Andrew,

First of all, great work on the patch Andrew.  You have done good work, and it is nice to have the code in Cython now.  I am glad to share this project with you.  I am looking forward to working more

But I have an issue with removing the fast Li approximation.

The use of fast Li approximation function for this program is absolutely essential.  I am very strongly opposed to switching out the Li approximation for the slower built-in exact Li as it will severely impact its average case time complexity.

You say that the cases where Li's speed matter do not affect average case time complexity.  Computing average case time complexity is difficult because it requires that you define a probability distribution over the possible inputs.

If the probability distribution is uniform, meaning that any input is just as likely, then most of the input will be large numbers.  For an average large value of x (say a random 12 digit number), the li calculation takes up a very negligible fraction of the total computation time of prime_pi.

I believe that a uniform distribution in the logarithmic domain is a more accurate model of input probabilities.  In modeling average case time complexity, I would assume that 1, 2, 3, 4, ..etc digit numbers have equal probabilities of being input in the program.

For small values of x (say only a few digits long), the li calculation could represent the majority of the calculation time (where only minimal or no sieving is needed).

When average case time complexity is modeled using the more realistic logarithmic model, the performance of prime_pi on smaller values is not negligible, and could represent a significant fraction of expected input.

I see no logical reason to take code that has been painstakingly optimized for speed and make it up to 40 times slower for a significant percentage of its expected input.

After this prime_pi and nth_prime are formally added to Sage, I would like to create a graph of its performance for a set of random 1, 2, 3, 4... etc digit numbers (and compare the performance to other implementations of the prime counting function).  I really, really don't want the section of the graph representing numbers less than 5 digits to be up to 40 times slower than it could have been because of an unfounded prejudice against the asymptotic series for the logarithmic integral (which was written by an expert in coding arithmetic functions and is well documented and known by the mathematics community).

Math/Programming is war.  Every cycle of speed is fought for.  Don't give it up.

Why would I want to use arbitrary precision arithmetic to calculate an approximation that is desired to be as fast as possible (maybe you are just advocating that the desired accuracy be a parameter)?  I don't believe that the asymptotic series lends itself to error analysis or arbitrary precision.  It is simply a fast way to calculate an approximation.  And I think that the asymptotic series is preferable here to the series representation (with specified precision) because of speed issues.

If I am going to make a Li module, with the exact li, an arbitrary precision li, a specified precision li, and a fast asymptotic series li, then I am going to need some assistance from someone who has more experience than myself at making Sage patches (any takers?).

A would also like to mention track ticket 7017 at this time (prime range problem).  Ticket 7017 should help making plots of prime_pi.

Sincerely,
your friend,
Kevin Stueve

The opportunity to almost double or quadruple the speed of a program is enough to implement multiprocessing.  But when Intel's road-map includes a 32 core chip in 2010 and an 80 core chip a few years away, it becomes absolutely ridiculous not to implement multiprocessing.

I spent a lot of time and effort optimizing the use of multiprocessing.  I did benchmarking to determine at what point the time savings from multiprocessing outweighs the overhead needed.  This is time sacrificed that I could have spent doing many other things.

Now I find that my multiprocessing code has been removed.  It is not my responsibility to put it back in.  I already put it in once.

Let me remind you that the purpose of this project is the fastest possible implementation of the prime counting function.  Let's not miss a large factor of difference (that will grow exponentially as the years go by) from neglecting a few lines of trivial multiprocessing code.

your friend,

<a id='comment:22'>**Comment 22:**</a>
Let's start to create a "primes.p0.spkg" (better names appreciated ...) which provides the "prime_sieve.c" code/functionality as a library.

Primary goal: The function "primes_interval()" is accessible from a dynamic library "libprimes.so" resp. "libprimes.dll", which in turn compiles (and works) on the platforms Sage supports, and actually is being a part of some future version of Sage.

Secondary goal: This spkg also provides some precomputed tables (which in a Sage installation will be installed under "data/prime_pi_tables/").

Tertiary goal: Provide the LMO code/functionality from Victor Miller in the same way, too. 

I opened up a new ticket for this, #7539. The work on that ticket #7539 is more or less an exercise in software engineering, and does hardly interfere with the remaining work on this ticket here.

Where does the content from "data/" come from? Well, each subdirectory there is copied over from some spkg, e.g. the "data/extcode/" subdirectory from the "extcode-4.3.alpha0.spkg".

The whole range up to 2<sup>64</sup> at steps of 10<sup>9</sup> fits on a (DL-)DVD, and sieving a whole interval (worst case) with 10<sup>9</sup> primes today takes at most a few minutes. (With a step size of 10<sup>10</sup>, the table would fit on a CD, 10<sup>11</sup> would be about 65MB and so on. The tables should compress well for shipping because of the monotonicity.)

But we are yet far away from having such dense (and complete) tables, though I expect (wishful thinking?) the 64-bit range to be fully sieved within the next 5-10 years.
Regarding that, it would at my opinion be better to use a format that allows the tables to be successively updated (i.e. extended) with "arbitrary" intermediate values, until they one day are complete (and can be indexed directly rather than binary-searched).

As Kevin stated, harddisks get larger and cheaper, bandwidth continuously grows... Since the tables should be optional anyway (and they are still quite small), I think we shouldn't be too much concerned about file sizes. [Admins, take mercy on me...]

Of course we could support (and provide) both types of tables and let the user choose which one is more appropriate to him (or her).

    PS. One could of course try to throw in a few terms corresponding to the first few zeros of zeta(s) but I would think that, in practical terms, you might not gain very much.

Dear Victor:

   Unconditionally one cannot say much about this error term, because we don't even
know its order of magnitude.  Assume RH.  Then pi - li does not have a limiting distribution
because its general size is growing.  So consider

                                         pi(x) - Li(x)
                                      ------------------- .
                                      x^{1/2}/log x

This will generally lie between -1.25 and -0.75, but even this does not have a limiting
distribution.  The point is that its wobbles become slower and slower, so that
for any given order of magnitude, the quantity is almost constant.  What is needed
is an exponential change of variable.  Put

                                      f(y) = (psi(e^y) - e^y)/e^{y/2}.

Aurel Wintner showed that (on RH) this has a limiting distribution.  If one wanted
to use data to get an idea of this distribution, it would be difficult to get very many
independent data points, due to the exponential increase of the argument.  If one assumes
that the ordinates gamma > 0 of the zeros of zeta(s) are linearly independent over the
rationals, then the terms e^{i*gamma*y} act like independent random variables, and
one can develop approximations to the distribution function of f.  The distribution function
is even, its density is everywhere positive, and tends to zero rapidly (almost doubly-
exponentially) at infinity.  For each gamma > 0, let X_gamma be a random variable
uniformly distributed on [0,1], and suppose that the X_gamma are independent.  Then
the limiting distribution of f (assuming RH & the linear independence of the gamma)
is the same as for the random variable

                                 2 sum_{gamma > 0} (sin 2*Pi*X_gamma)/|rho| .

Here rho = 1/2+i*gamma.  One could sample this variable at random points to
develop an approximation to the distribution function of f.

                                                      Cheers,
                                                                   Hugh

Following is an email exchange between Victor Miller and Hugh Montgomery
regarding the distribution of the remainder pi(x) - Li(x) that was forwarded to me.

Victor Miller wrote:

  Hugh, Do you know of results about the distribution of the remainder pi(x) - Li(x) (assuming RH)?
  In particular if one wanted to store remainders like this for various random values of x if one
  knew the distribution (which I would expect is certainly not uniform) then one could use various
  data compression techniques that depend on knowing the distribution to save at least a constant factor.

PS. One could of course try to throw in a few terms corresponding to the first few zeros of zeta(s)
  but I would think that, in practical terms, you might not gain very much.

Hugh Montgomery replied:

  Dear Victor:

  Unconditionally one cannot say much about this error term, because we don't even
  know its order of magnitude.  Assume RH.  Then pi - li does not have a limiting distribution
  because its general size is growing.  So consider

                         ( pi(x) - Li(x) ) / ( x<sup>1/2</sup>/log x )

  This will generally lie between -1.25 and -0.75, but even this does not have a limiting
distribution.  The point is that its wobbles become slower and slower, so that
  for any given order of magnitude, the quantity is almost constant.  What is needed
  is an exponential change of variable.  Put

                         f(y) = (psi(e<sup>y</sup>) - e<sup>y</sup>)/e<sup>y/2</sup>.

  Aurel Wintner showed that (on RH) this has a limiting distribution.  If one wanted
  to use data to get an idea of this distribution, it would be difficult to get very many

  one can develop approximations to the distribution function of f.  The distribution function
  is even, its density is everywhere positive, and tends to zero rapidly (almost doubly-
  exponentially) at infinity.  For each gamma > 0, let X<sub>gamma</sub> be a random variable
  uniformly distributed on ![0,1], and suppose that the X<sub>gamma</sub> are independent.  Then
  the limiting distribution of f (assuming RH & the linear independence of the gamma)
  is the same as for the random variable

                                 2 SUM,,gamma > 0,, (sin 2*Pi*X<sub>gamma</sub>)/|rho| .

  Here rho = 1/2+i*gamma.  One could sample this variable at random points to

Yes. For any sort of *binary* file, I was thinking of just reserving the first 1024 bytes, which should be enough space for various information.
Such *fixed-size* header can easily be [partially] skipped if the program does not implement the latest file [header] format version.
We could even use this convention for text files, and start each file with a zero-terminated short ASCII string, s.t. 

```
user@machine~/somewhere$ head some_file_of_unknown_format
```
gives a machine- **and** human-understandable brief description (at least of its type and file format version).

Note that this version of `prime_sieve.c` is outdated (and btw, it should be called `prime_pi_sieve_tos.c`).

I hope I can provide a slightly polished version of the latest (Jan 2010, with optimizations, all overflow conditions I'm aware of - see #7539 - fixed) within this week.

Regarding the current density in other ranges, I'd consider this rather a waste of time and space; even with - nowadays suboptimal - LMO, it takes only a few seconds to compute pi(x) in that range.

Above 10<sup>19</sup> we have a spacing of 10<sup>16</sup>, which is far too sparse; I'm currently computing pi(N*10<sup>15</sup>) for N>10000 (hopefully up to N=18446, i.e. 2<sup>64</sup>, but this will take months...).

:D If I was able to *sieve* such a large interval in reasonable time, I wouldn't mind storing terabytes of data (including more than just pi(x)).

I think the primary goal should be getting denser tables in the whole 64-bit range, s.t. the average time for arbitrary values drops down significantly.
This can be accompanied by sieving "from scratch" while recording more information if we have the resources to do so.
But the current situation is that we have large "holes" in our tables that make the combinatorial method outperform table look-up and sieving by orders of magnitude (though taking even "too long" from a user's perspective, i.e. up to *hours*).

Computing pi(N*10<sup>15</sup>) for N>10000 is just a *first step*, perhaps followed by computing pi(N*10<sup>14</sup>) where these values are missing, and so on, until - *perhaps large-scale distributed* - *sieving* the remaining smaller intervals beats individually computing lots of values in them. Anyway, having data points independently computed with other methods is always good, and a prerequisite for validating results computed only once.

Andrew Ohana Cythonized my last prime counting code post.  I triple quoted the message he sent me on Mar 23

"""Hey,

So I've attached a code, how to get it working (in sage), the prime_sieve.c has the main method separated from the sieve so that we can get an unsigned 64-bit int straight out of it and into cython (huge speedup that bests the multiprocessed python code with a single thread on my machine):

0) I will refer to the sage directory (where the sage command lies) as SAGE_ROOT (as per the sage api)

1) make sure you clone sage and exit, you can do this from within sage by running hg_sage.clone(clone_name), eg

sage: hg_sage.clone('PrimePi')
<clone output>
sage: exit

2) copy your tables (with the same file names) into SAGE_ROOT/data/prime_pi_tables/

3) copy the two files I've attached to SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/functions/

4) edit SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/functions/all.py and add the following line after the prime_pi line

from cython_table_based_prime_pi import cython_table_based_prime_pi

we will remove this when the old prime_pi method is removed

5) edit SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/module_list.py and add the following lines in the sage.functions section

Extension('sage.functions.cython_table_based_prime_pi',
    sources = ['sage/functions/cython_table_based_prime_pi.pyx']),

again we will remove this later on (after testing).

6) run the sage command with the argument -br e.g.

SAGE_ROOT/sage -br

7) you should now be able to use the cython_table_based_prime_pi function from within sage whenever you are in the PrimePi branch (you can switch branches with the hg_sage.switch command).

Hopefully this illustrates how to add code to sage in general, the module_list is not needed for python modules, only for cython modules and multiple cython sources can be used for a single module.

-- Andrew"""

I think that we are ready to make an optional package and installing it in the online version of Sage.  Andrew Ohana's instructions should allow anyone to add the table-based prime counting algorithm along with the densest data available to their copy of Sage.

I have posted new table-based prime counting code in table_based_prime_pi_23_July_2011.zip.  In addition to counting primes, this code can also count twin primes, prime triplets, and prime quadruplets.  Since my last contribution, denser tables of the prime counting function and counts of prime constellations have become available (by a factor of 10 in some intervals), decreasing the amount of sieving needed by such a factor.

This code fixes the problems in my original contribution.  The sieve I used in my original contribution was Tomás Oliveira e Silva's prime_sieve.c, which assumed pointers have 4 bytes.  The sieve I use in my new code is Kim Walisch's primesieve.  Primesieve uses portable c++ and uses Oliveira e Silva's algorithm for large x.

Although a lot of work has been done, my code should still be considered a rough draft.  The path to the primesieve package is still hard-coded.  A second person should fix such problems and also go over the code line by line and double-check for off-by-one errors and the like.  I am willing to offer someone who can can get this code in Sage coauthorship of the code.

This code checks for the presence of prime count tables in SAGE_ROOT/data/prime_counting_tables, and if they are not there, instructs the user to download them from http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kstueve/prime_pi_tables/.

The code communicates with primesieve using the subprocess module and primesievesubprocess.cpp, a file I wrote to allow the code to communicate with primesieve over the command line.  It may be desirable to change this arrangement.  For one thing, primesieve has to do its initialization for every call to table_based_prime_pi.

To build primesievesubprocess.cpp, I put it into the main primesieve folder.  I ran the primesieve make file.  I removed main.o, ParallelPrimeSieve.o, and test,o from the out folder.  I then ran:
g++ primesievesubprocess.cpp out/*.o -o primesievesubprocess

Hi Kevin,

Could you please update the horribly outdated description with details on how to install your changes. Just to make sure, this is intended at as an optional package for sage, yes? (The size of the database needed is why I am asking).

Looking at your changes, the first thing that jumps out at me is that you are including the source code of primesieve directly within the sage library. Considering that it is a separate piece of software, the best way to do this would be to bundle it within a separate spkg to install to `SAGE_LOCAL`. If you are not familiar with working with spkgs, see http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html. If I remember correctly, primesieve doesn't quite work as a library out of the box, so you might have to apply some patches to it make it work as such.

I'm not quite sure about the policies for optional packages, but you may be able to require the user to have openmp, in which case the install script should check for it and fail if the computer's cc does not support it.

Secondly, you will need to create an spkg including your tables. These should be installed to `SAGE_DATA`, and the install script should be very simple.

There are some issues with the `PrimePi` class as well, but I need to sleep and look at it again before I can give you any real feedback on it.

Take care,

I've rebased your patch off of my patches and spkg at #7539. Since #7539 fixes the openmp issues you were having on sage.math, I set your patch to be in parallel (unless, of course, gcc doesn't support openmp, in which case everything is serial).

Patch: [attachment:trac7013_rebased.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7013/trac7013_rebased.patch)
