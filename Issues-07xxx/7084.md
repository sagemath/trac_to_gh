It's comparing your second assumption with the first one, presumably to make sure it doesn't conflict (?) ... but it is strange that it is talking about an attribute variables, since the attribute _var is being called, and b is real has that.

The problem is in symbolic/expression.pyx, where `__nonzero__` tries to find the variable of  "a is real" - but it only has a _var, not variables like "t>0", which is a symbolic expression.
