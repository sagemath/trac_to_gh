Although I noticed this issue on HP-UX, I know it affects Solaris too. The 'make' program certainly can not be Sun's on Solaris, and while it looks like a minor mod would allow the 'make' on HP-UX to work, it seems sensible we just check for GNU make. 

It would appear that there is an autoconf macros for this, now called 

AX_CHECK_GNU_MAKE, though it was called CHECK_GNU_MAKE()
