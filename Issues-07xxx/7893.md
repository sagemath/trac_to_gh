I revised the script according Donald Alan Morrison's comments:  

1) The stop_server function does not do error checking to ensure that 
 the pid contained in the pid file actually corresponds to a server 
 process: [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7893/sage-server.gz](http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7893/sage-server.gz&usg=AFQjCNFolyoFiY1P1jjri5DIL9m7ZUsTrg) 


30      def stop_server(): 
 31          try: 
 32              # if sage notebook server is running, "twist.pid" is 
 created 
 33              file = open(os.environ!['HOME'] + '/.sage/ 
 sage_notebook.sagenb/twistd.pid', 'r') 
 34              pid = file.readline() 
 35              file.close() 
 36              print "Stopping sage server..." 
 37              os.system('kill -INT ' + pid) 
 38          except IOError: 
 39              print "No sage server running." 


Given the frequency of reboots for most users, and the cost to the 
 user of killing a random process, it would be good to error check 
 against the actual running process name. 


2) It would be good to add some code that waits for SIG_TERM to 
 complete, then optionally sends SIG_KILL.  One can't assume SIG_TERM 
 will be handled correctly by the server, especially if it's in a bad 
state. 


3) The script should verify the completion of !#2, then delete the pid 
files.

Using "screen" is not very portable, so I would avoid that.

Further revised according to the comment :

Line 50 "blocks" (waits syncronously without checking status); also 
 half of a second may not be long enough if all memory was used up and 
 there was excessive paging in/out from the swap file.  One alternative 
 method is to check for the existence of the pid file periodically for 
 a longer period (possibly parameterized), and if it is deleted, 
 recheck that the twistd process has indeed exited else send SIGKILL. 


Otherwise, good refactor. :-)

Look at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/381 for a similar effort. On Gentoo I automatically start the Notebook with a runscript - I find it very useful because the only thing I have to do is to open a browser and type in the Notebook's address. It is also possible to access the server from a different PC. To make it a more secure it is run as a different user.

I just added a patch which lets one specify the location of twistd's PID file: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/10131 - this might be of interest.
