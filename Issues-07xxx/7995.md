```
The `sage-doctest` script returns some status info in its exit code, like if it was aborted with a `KeyboardInterrupt`. The `sage-ptest` script interprets this information, but `sage-test` mostly ignores it.

One symptom is that Ctrl-C-ing a `sage -t` run of multiple files doesn't work.

Patch attached.

In the future we may want to merge the sage-ptest and sage-test scripts entirely. They have a lot of duplicate code and minor unnecessary differences.

I don't know much the doctest framework. But the code looks good, and this removes two seriously annoying misfeatures of doctests. Thanks so much for scratching this itch for me!

Quick remarks:

- When there is an exception in the doctesting framework; will we get
  a traceback? That would be most handy!

- in "... Check the process exit codes ...": codes -> code?

- The following two comments seem contradictory. Or am I
  misunderstanding something?

> \# Return value in process exit code: 
> \# 0: all tests passed 
> \# 1: file not found 
> \# 2: KeyboardInterrupt 
> \# 3: doctest process was terminated by a signal 
> \# 4: the doctesting framework raised an exception 
> \# 100: failed doctests 
> #################################################################### 

>
> def test_code(filename): 
>     \# Return value in the doctest process exit code:

>     \# 1-253: number of failed doctests

The patch here doesn't work; it exits sage-doctest with sys.exit(2), and then munges the error code with "err = err // 256" -- that is, it does floor division by 256, so the 2 becomes 0 and KeyboardInterrupts are never detected!

I hope to fix this while working on #8641.

I tested this, and it worked for me, as well as matching what the python docs say it does on unix systems. Does it not work on your system?

The python docs for `os.system`:

```
On Unix, the return value is the exit status of the process encoded in
the format specified for wait().
```

And for `os.wait`:

```
Wait for completion of a child process, and return a tuple containing
its pid and exit status indication: a 16-bit number, whose low byte is
the signal number that killed the process, and whose high byte is the
exit status (if the signal number is zero); the high bit of the low byte
is set if a core file was produced. Availability: Unix.
```

No, it doesn't. I'll work on this more, but I know that, on my Ubuntu 9.10 system, if I ctrl-c while running tests on a bunch of files, it doesn't interrupt the whole process. In sage-test, I have this:

```
print 'finished with %s, err: %s' % (F, err)
err = err // 256
print 'finished with %s, err: %s' % (F, err)
```
and here's what I get:

```
drake@sagenb:~/s/sage-4.3.5$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/combinat/t*.py
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/combinat/tableau.py"              
^CKeyboardInterrupt -- interrupted after 2.3 seconds!

         [2.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 6.2 seconds
```

I'm not sure why this isn't working.

I put in a few print statements, like Dan did:

```
    print err,
    err = err // 256
    print err
```
On my iMac running OS X 10.6, when I hit ctrl-C, I see

```
515 2
```
which looks okay.

On sage.math, I see

```
2 0
```
which doesn't.
