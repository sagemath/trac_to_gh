I'll give it a positive, as its clear you have just deleted some useless code. It builds on Solaris at least. 

I believe there was a comment on sage-devel about a lot of work being done on this package recently. Hopefully there will be another release, as this one generates a lot of warnings from g++. Sun's compiler will not compile it.
