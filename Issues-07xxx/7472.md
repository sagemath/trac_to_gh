Can be done easily, the expression is passed to Maxima and Maxima allows many possibilities how to use [taylor command](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/en/maxima_30.html#Item_003a-taylor). I wanted to do as minotr change as possible. I was thinking for example also on the possibility to use different order for different variable, but I do not know if there is a demand for this.

I do not know to much about habits in Sage notation, but I think that we evaluate expansion about point in n-dimensional space, so the coordinates should be together.

FWIW, I also like the MMA notation better. It is more consistent with the interface to `integrate`, `plot`, etc. as kcrisman mentioned.

I assume the idea of different degrees for different variables was lost?  That really doesn't matter to me, though.

What about this one, from the documentation?

```
sage: x,y=var('x y'); taylor(x*y^3,(x,1),(y,-1),4)  
(y + 1)^3*(x - 1) + (y + 1)^3 - 3*(y + 1)^2*(x - 1) - 3*(y + 1)^2 + 3*(y + 1)*(x - 1) - x + 3*y + 3 
```
Why doesn't it end this way?

```
-(x-1)+3*(y+1) -1
```
Maybe this is documented in Maxima?  It does seem odd, though, if I'm understanding what a multivariable Taylor polynomial is supposed to look like.

But overall this looks fine, assuming the Maxima computations are correct.  I am waiting for 4.3.alpha2 to build to see if there needs to be a rebase, but surely it would be trivial if so.

Yes, different degrees for different variables seem odd to me (from the point of view of pure caculcus) and I do not know, if there is a demand to keep this functionality.

Very good question :). Maxima in fact returns 

```
-(x-1)+3*(y+1) -1
```
and Sage changes it somehow into 

```
-x+3y+.... 
```
I do not know why, perhaps I should ask on sage-devel. The same problem is also in current Sage. The linear Taylor polynomial hal always slope intercept form f'(a)*x+q, but should be (and Maxima returns) point slope form  f'(a)*(x-a)+f(a)
