It is often useful to subdivide the edges of a graph, so there should be a function in Sage for this.

When an edge e between u and v is subdivided in a DiGraph, perhaps the best thing to do would be to name the new vertices as (e, 0), (e, 1), (e, 2), etc ...

We are left with a similar problem concerning the Graphs and here I have to admit I do not know which name to use without inducing some orientation..

This being said, it has to be done ! :-)

In the docs, you say that the following are valid forms:

G.add_edge( 1, 2, 8 )

G.add_edge( (1, 2), 8 )

However, reading the code seems to indicate that it should be subdivide_edge, not add_edge.

I don't think this quite works as advertised. If I have edge `(u, v, 1)` and I do `G.subdivide_edge((u, v, 2), 5)`, then the edge `(u, v, 1)` is never deleted.

Is the input label the new label, or the label of the existing edge?

Maybe there should be a `new_label` argument instead? I'm not sure the best way to approach this, and I'm interested in your opinion.
