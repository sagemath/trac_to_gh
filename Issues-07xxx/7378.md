It is often useful to subdivide the edges of a graph, so there should be a function in Sage for this.

When an edge e between u and v is subdivided in a DiGraph, perhaps the best thing to do would be to name the new vertices as (e, 0), (e, 1), (e, 2), etc ...

We are left with a similar problem concerning the Graphs and here I have to admit I do not know which name to use without inducing some orientation..

This being said, it has to be done ! :-)
