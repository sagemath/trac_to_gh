With the new category framework there will be a lot of parent which will be tested by the testsuite machinery. It is very useful that sage-coverage stop complaining about missing `s == loads(dumps(s))` because it is done during
`TestSuite(s).run()`. The patch looks good and works. Positive review. 

Cheers,

Florent
