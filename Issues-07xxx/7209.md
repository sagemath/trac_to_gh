With the attached patch for sage/local/bin, `sage -coverage` scans for either a loads(dumps(s)) or a TestSuite(s).run() doctest, and suggests using the later.

Also refines the test whether the file defines a class.

With the new category framework there will be a lot of parent which will be tested by the testsuite machinery. It is very useful that sage-coverage stop complaining about missing `s == loads(dumps(s))` because it is done during
`TestSuite(s).run()`. The patch looks good and works. Positive review. 

Cheers,

Florent
