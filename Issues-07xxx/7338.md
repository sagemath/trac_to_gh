It fails with 

```

```

One fix is to comment out the HtmlHelpA line from sing_win.cc

Making this change to src/IntegerProgramming/Makefile gets past this particular problem (the change is to add .exe after $(MAIN1) etc. below:

OK, with the above fix rolled into the new spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/ports/cygwin/singular-3-1-0-4-20100214.spkg this now builds fine on Cygwin, and

The warning at the top is probably because of the distinction between Singular and Singular.exe, perhaps.  Anyway, this is now ready for review.
