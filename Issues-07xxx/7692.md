Hi William,

I don't want to send a 10 MB attachment (the unzipped database file is now
about 31 MB instead of the former 20), so I've attached a bash script that
should automatically generate the spkg file for you.  As long as you have
wget installed and the database can be downloaded (it doesn't check for
failure) it should work just fine.

Let me know if you have any problems running the script or using the spkg
it generates and I'll get it fixed as quickly as possible.

Best,
Steven
```

More readable version:

I completely forgot that the array size was hardcoded in SloaneEncyclopediaClass -- this is what caused the error, since now the number of entries is bigger than the array size.

(To check the numbers in your database file, run "cut -d' ' -f1 sloane-oeis | head".)

The two best fixes I have in mind, other than getting Sloane to renumber that one extra sequence, are to replace SloaneEncyclopediaClass.__data__ with a hashtable whose keys are the indices and to let it be a huge array whose last index is 557274. The first might be slower, but the second one will require storing almost 400000 extra "None" entries in the __data__ array, and they'll have to be iterated through and ignored in the find() method.

FWIW, I downloaded a snapshot of the OEIS: all sequences up to date 2009-12-19.

I made a bz2 file: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/cat25.bz2](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/cat25.bz2)

43 MB, expanded this is 176 MB.

Nice to have around.

I've added a patch which adds two new functions in SloaneEncyclopediaClass:

- SloaneEncyclopedia.install() will download the stripped.gz file from the OEIS website and install it. The user can specify an alternate URL and whether to overwrite an existing copy of the OEIS.

- SloaneEncyclopedia.install_from_gz() installs the encyclopedia from a local copy of stripped.gz; the user has to specify the filename and (optionally) whether to overwrite an existing copy.

This eliminates the need for a spkg as long as the user can get a copy of stripped.gz, so if we want to continue providing a spkg (assuming we even have permission: see http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/Seis.html#SEARCH2) it should probably just contain stripped.gz and a spkg-install script which passes it to install_from_gz().

The patch should also fix the IndexError issue from the referee report, since now instead of hardcoding the size of the database and allocating an array of that size it just loads the database into a dictionary.

Looks good to me.

Tested the new functions. Worked for me.

Remark: I think there is no problem in offering an optional spkg. Neil excludes distributing the full database.

Suggestion: maybe it is feasible to modify sloane.py to include the file names.gz.
That way sequence can have there proper name from the OEIS.

Cheers,

Two remarks:

[1] Maybe the name of the patch should be conform the standard: trac_7692.patch

[2] Output is in Python:

```
sage: SloaneEncyclopedia[111111]
 [1, 2, 0, 2, 6, 46, 338, 2926, 28146, 298526, 3454434, 43286526, 583835650, 8433987582L, 129941213186L, 2127349165822L, 36889047574274L, 675548628690430L, 13030733384956418L, 264111424634864638L]

```

I would like to see this in Sage.

Shall we open another ticket?

Cheers,

Jaap
