Version 3.6c of jsMath works around Firefox 3.5's single-origin policy for local files.  The policy can keep jsMath from loading its external components and functioning properly (cf. #6820).

Please see the [change log](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/changes.html) for other bug fixes.

I installed it and it seems to work well.  In particular, the patch at #6820 works with Firefox with this.

I skimmed the patch but I'm not going to proofread it carefully; I'm assuming that you just took the new source code for jsMath 3.6c and replaced the old source code for jsMath 3.6b.
