I went to the settings page and checked yes to allowing new registrations and requiring an email address.  I then created an account with username asdf and password asdf.  It returned an error (bad password; contains the username).  I logged out anyway and logged back in as admin.  Then I clicked on Settings, and got the following error:

**Attachment:** [trac_7628-user_settings_page_error.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7628/trac_7628-user_settings_page_error.patch.gz)

The patch should prevent the error.  It does not activate the email system.

In the future, we could auto-generate the user settings page, with drop-down menus for key-bindings, a la the notebook settings page.  From `todo.txt`:

```
[ ] move is_valid_username (etc.) out of twist.py, which is definitely *not* where it belongs
```
How about a `validate.py`, with functions for other fields, too?
