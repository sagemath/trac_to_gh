<div id="comment:0"></div>

Fixed some issues in crystals, such as
- Comparison of elements
- Latex output
- Fixes whitespaces in /combinat/crystals/affine.py (as reported by Jason Bandlow)
- All crystals have unique representation
- Preparation of categorification of crystals:
   - C.element_class -> C.Element
   - All crystals are at least in the EnumeratedSets category
   - Use rename, or define `_repr_`, instead of setting _name
     Eventually, crystals should only use `_repr_`
   => Removed dependency upon deprecated CombinatorialClass
- Systematic use of TestSuite instead of loads/dumps test
- Fixed bug in fast_crystal: delpat is not immutable (which should be
  eventually be fixed), and was accidentally changed by the weight
  method). This was caught by turning on unique representation which
  made the crystals to be reused longer in the tests.

Depends on #8028 (element wrapper improvement)

I checked that the patch passes sage --testall, either with or without #8028.

I checked that it does not break latex method for classical crystals or metapost method for fastcrystals. I think the latex changes are specific to
affine crystals.

The patch does not seem to break anything, and fixes some problems. I recommend merging it.
