Yes, I agree that this is a bug.  
What is happening is that the *symbolic* conjugate function is coercing its input X to the symbolic ring SR before applying itself.  It would be much better to test if X has a .conjugate method, and if so return that; if not, then return SR(X).conjugate().

Here's the beginning of the course code for conjugate(X):

sage: conjugate.__call__??
        # we want to convert the result to the original parent if the input
        # is not exact, so we store the parent here
        org_parent = parent(args[0])
```

Sorry for the inconvenience. My patch queue contains all the fixes from yesterday. I forgot to check dependencies.

This depends on #7822. You can apply the patch there now, it doesn't depend on any changes in pynac. The timing will be better with the new pynac spkg though.

A good solution.  The timing changes seem to be unavoidable, given that we don't want conjugate(e^(2/3*I*pi)) as the result, and they seem identical otherwise:

```
sage: %timeit z3.conjugate()
625 loops, best of 3: 469 µs per loop
sage: %timeit conjugate(z3)
625 loops, best of 3: 469 µs per loop
