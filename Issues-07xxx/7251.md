The attached patch allows for the creation of integers whose parents are not IntegerRing():

```
            sage: n = Integer(3, parent = Primes())
            sage: n
            3
            sage: n.parent()
            Set of all prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, ...
```

That's used in a couple places in the category code #5891, when illustrating how to create new parents like the set of prime integers. So this is quite urgent.

Any better implementation welcome! I am fine also with having this work only for IntegerWrapper.

Can you elaborate a little bit more. Is this a serious problem ? We definitely want to create parents whose element will be some kind of integers. Does sage definitely prevents to inherits from integer and change the parent ? Do we have to wrap the integer as an *attribute* ?

Is trac adding some kind of subliminal add ? :-)

I double checked our use cases, and altogether we indeed only need the feature

```
     sage: IntegerWrapper(3, parent = Primes())
```
with the rest as in the description.

However, I have a problem, since if I move the `__init__` to IntegerWrapper, then `__cinit__` of Integer still gets called, and complains about the parent argument. Robert, Mike: would you mind investigating what's the right way for implementing this (I am not so familiar with cython initialization)?

Thanks for the explanations! I have added them to the documentation of IntegerWrapper.

The latest patch also just modifies IntegerWrapper, without touching Integer.
