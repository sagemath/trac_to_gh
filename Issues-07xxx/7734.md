1. There should always be an example of the bug you are fixing in the patch, always always always. We need a mug shot, so the bug doesn't show its face again :) I added this, as well as several other tests, which have exposed other corner case bugs, such as:

```
sage: g = Graph(20)

Thank you for your help !!!

Concerning your second point : do you have an example for which it takes some time ? I would also like to try to improve it a bit :-)

```
sage: from sage.graphs.graph_coloring import vertex_coloring
sage: g = graphs.CirculantGraph(120, [2,3,5,7])
sage: vertex_coloring(g)
```
It takes longer to set up the constraint than to solve the problem, on my laptop.
