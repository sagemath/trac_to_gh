1. There should always be an example of the bug you are fixing in the patch, always always always. We need a mug shot, so the bug doesn't show its face again :) I added this, as well as several other tests, which have exposed other corner case bugs, such as:

```
sage: g = Graph(20)
sage: vertex_coloring(g, hex_colors=True)
{'#ff0000': 0}
```
I've fixed these.

2. It seems to take some time to add constraints to the problem, which is pointless if no solver is installed. Can you add a patch that runs a trivial test before setting up the problem, to see if it is installed?

Concerning your second point : do you have an example for which it takes some time ? I would also like to try to improve it a bit :-)

```
sage: from sage.graphs.graph_coloring import vertex_coloring
sage: g = graphs.CirculantGraph(120, [2,3,5,7])
sage: vertex_coloring(g)
```
It takes longer to set up the constraint than to solve the problem, on my laptop.

I just created #7740 to deal with the problem of speed. What would you advise for the detection of the solver ? At the moment, only the "solve" command requires an optional package to be installed, do you think it would be worth changing this and make the whole class depend on GLPK or CBC ?
