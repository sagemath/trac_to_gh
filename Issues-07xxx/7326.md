It would be *really* nice if you could include latex code in a table, like this:

```
var('t')
density=t^2
html.table([
["Density $\delta(x,y)$", density]
])
```

and have it do the jsmath magic on the $\delta(x,y)$ part.

As a workaround this already works:

```
var('t')
density=t^2
html.table([
['Density <span class="math">\delta(x,y)</span>', density]
])
```

I am not sure why jsmath does not pick up the $$s in this case.

so does html.table([This is the Trac macro *sage.misc.html.math_parse* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments ('hi $x^2$'))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#sage.misc.html.math_parse-macro))

Maybe what is going on is jsmath seems to be not set up to try to find dollar signs, but to only pay attention to class="math" spans and divs.
