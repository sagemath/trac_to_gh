New spkg up here: 

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/cygwin/singular-3-1-0-4-20090818.p1.spkg

It just has one line commented out and requirement of libncurses-devel.

This builds on my Cygwin setup. Just a few comments:

* There's a bunch of ~ backup files around; those should be deleted. (Although they are useful for reviewing purposes, since I could run "diff- u" to see what you did.)
* The dist/ directory should be removed. (#5903)
* Can you include a diff of sing_win.cc in the patches directory? That seems to be the standard practice, and it makes reviewing patches easier. (I wish that the patches directory contained *only* patches, instead of entire copies of source files, but that's for another time...)
* When I run "local/bin/Singular" from SAGE_ROOT, it appears to work, but says "? cannot open `standard.lib`". Is that okay?

Hi, just to mention it:

this "p1" spkg is based on the "original" Singular spkg from Sage 4.1.2.alpha1/2, and not on the "p0" spkg referenced from trac #6951. The changes therein already were forgotten once (in the transition from Singular 3-1-0-2 to Singular 3-1-0-4), so please make sure that they are not forgotten again :-)

The issue with libSingular on Cygwin always had been that it didn't work well with Python extensions / Cython. Does this work now (I can't test it myself currently, lacking a cygwin system/install)? If so, it has taken literally years to weed out one obstacle after another ... 

Cheers, Georg
