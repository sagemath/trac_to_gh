Two remarks :

* I would have written 
  {{{
  relabel - default: True.

  as 

  {{{
  ``relabel`` - default: ``True``.

Nice catch, on both counts.  Thanks for the review.

The "_2" patch is self-contained (ie apply just the single revised patch on a fresh install) and addresses both your comments.
