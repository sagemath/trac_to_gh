In the new sage notebook maxima cells do not work anymore for inputs
starting with '%'.

```
%maxima
%pi

Traceback (click to the left for traceback)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object has no
attribute 'eval'
```

or:

```
%maxima
%e^(%i * %pi)

Syntax Error:
    %e^(%i * %pi)
```

This used to work with older Sage versions.

I think the best fix for this is to break from processing the percent directives once a system directive has been reached.  It should be easy to detect this as the system directives are the "unknown" one has been reached.

**Attachment:** [trac_7418-maxima_cells.2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7418/trac_7418-maxima_cells.2.patch.gz)

V2 adds one --- I hope it's in the right place.  The queue:

```
SageNB 0.7 / #8051
trac_7784-hgignore_update.patch
trac_5712-interrupt-notification.5.patch
trac_6069-missing_pub_ws.2.patch
trac_8038-email_plus_addressing_v2.patch
trac_7506-notebook_object-documentation.2.patch
trac_693-spawn_notebook.3.patch
trac_5177-delete-cell-dirs.2.patch
trac_7418-maxima_cells.2.patch
```
The patch version numbers may be off by one or so.

Positive review, but someone should review my change.
