In the new sage notebook maxima cells do not work anymore for inputs
starting with '%'.

```
%maxima
%pi

Traceback (click to the left for traceback)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object has no
attribute 'eval'
```

or:

```
%maxima
%e^(%i * %pi)

Syntax Error:
    %e^(%i * %pi)
```

This used to work with older Sage versions.

I think the best fix for this is to break from processing the percent directives once a system directive has been reached.  It should be easy to detect this as the system directives are the "unknown" one has been reached.
