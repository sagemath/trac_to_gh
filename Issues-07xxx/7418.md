In the new sage notebook maxima cells do not work anymore for inputs
starting with '%'.

```
%maxima
%pi

Traceback (click to the left for traceback)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object has no
attribute 'eval'
```

or:

```
%maxima
%e^(%i * %pi)

Syntax Error:
    %e^(%i * %pi)
```

This used to work with older Sage versions.
