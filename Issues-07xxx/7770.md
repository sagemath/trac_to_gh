Some rough timing information on a 3 GHZ Core 2 Duo:

4 pegs, 10 disks, no labels, no layout info

`2^20 = 1,048,576` vertices

3,142,656 edges

240 seconds

Distance between vertex 0 and `(4^10)-1`, ie

the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle:

742 ms

I could probably provide timing on sage.math for a release tour (along with a nice graphic).

This looks like an interesting patch but 

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py"
```
seems to fail (sage 4.3, imac, 10.6.2).

Positive review.

Installs fine on 64bit ubuntu and imac 10.6.2 running sage 4.3. Passes sage -testall on the ubuntu machine and has (I think only) unrelated failures on the imac. Also I check the html output for the reference manual and it looks good.

Thanks for this patch Rob! I have used it already in some lecture notes I'm working on for next semester.

Hi David,

Thanks for the quick review, and I'm especially glad to hear it is being used *immediately*.  ;-)

I'm going to send you some extra info on the graph off-list. (I don't have permission to post it yet).
