<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Some rough timing information on a 3 GHZ Core 2 Duo:

4 pegs, 10 disks, no labels, no layout info

`2^20 = 1,048,576` vertices

3,142,656 edges

240 seconds

Distance between vertex 0 and `(4^10)-1`, ie

the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle:

742 ms

I could probably provide timing on sage.math for a release tour (along with a nice graphic).

This looks like an interesting patch but 

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py"
```
seems to fail (sage 4.3, imac, 10.6.2).

Hi David,

Thanks for the quick review, and I'm especially glad to hear it is being used *immediately*.  ;-)

I'm going to send you some extra info on the graph off-list. (I don't have permission to post it yet).
