Here's the relevant sage-devel thread: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8e38cdd8048eb39c

Thanks again for working on this!

Here are some comments about the implementation up at http://www.sagenb.org/home/pub/1323/, just based on reading the code.

1. To be consistent with the plotting functions, it would also need to support something like:

```
spherical_plot3d(lambda x,y: x+y, (0,2*pi), (0,pi))
```

That's the purpose behind the convoluted second half of the make_coordinate_plot3d function (because symbolic functions can't be multiplied by lambda functions).

2. It's better to use "zran is None" rather than "zran==None".  It's a much faster test.

3. There is still some dependence on variable names if the variable name is not specified.  This should give an error, or at least a deprecation warning, as it is no longer a supported syntax for plotting:

```
spherical_plot3d(phi*theta, (0,2*pi),(0,pi))
```

(note that the expression has two variables, but I haven't said which variable corresponds to which range.  This is particularly confusing with spherical plots, since there are two opposite conventions.

4. except statements should catch specific exceptions (e.g., "except ValueError"), instead of just triggering on any error.

5. I'm not sure there's any difference between the transform_plot3d and just plainly calling parametric_plot3d.  transform_plot3d seems to just basically be a rename of parametric_plot3d.
