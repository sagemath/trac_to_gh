This patch adds the DeBruijn digraph to the ( still very short ) list of digraphs generators.

More information here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph

I found no way to define automatically a layout for this graph. If you have an idea, do not hesitate to tell me :-)

Dear Nathann, I just reviewed your code and made some modifications (see patch). I mostly used some possibilities offered by the word code in sage (e.g. * instead of concatenation and Words(n,1) for words of length one). Tell me if you agree with those modifications.

The output when k=0 was broken (vertices of length one were appearing). Although it could not be supported (return an error), I think it may be defined using multiedges and hence the "Each vertex has exactly n incoming and n outgoing edges" statement stays true. The wiki page doesn't talk about k=0...... 

I am giving a positive review to your patch pending a solution for the case k=0. Can you review my patch?

I think your patch is perfect, including the case k=0... I did not think about empty words, though it can not hurt :-)

Positive review !
