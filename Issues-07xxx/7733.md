Just try ::

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.show()
sage: Graph(g).show()
sage: DiGraph(g).show()
```

The positions are not kept.... Why isn't Graph(g) equivalent to copy(g) ?

What do you think of line 300 ?

```
sage: g = DiGraph(graphs.PetersenGraph()) 
```

Would you like to see an independent test for it ?
