Hello !!!

Out of curiosity, I tried to look for a function I knew in Sage :

```
sage: search_doc("Floyd-Warshall")
html/en/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html:5797:<dd><p>Uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find a shortest weighted path
sage: search_doc("Floyd-Warshall","pair")
sage: Graph.shortest_path_all_pairs?
```

I understand the current way to look for things in the doc is to grep it, and that for some reason we may need to keep our lines short ( less than 80 characters or so ).. I also understand that finding another way to search the doc ( if there is none available already ) may be some big amount of work. Even though, this really isn't the expected behaviour of the function, and I think we should do something about it.

Tested this on sage-4.3.2.alpha0 with trac_7313-multiline.patch 
(tried the patch in ticket #7018 but that had errors)

Look for occurrences of "Pseudo". We find two occurrences.

```
sage: search_src("Pseudo-")
combinat/words/word.py:2655:        -   [2] V. Anne, L.Q. Zamboni, I. Zorca, Palindromes and Pseudo-
combinat/words/word.py:2656:            Palindromes in Episturmian and Pseudo-Palindromic Infinite Words,
rings/all.py:122:# Pseudo-ring of PARI objects.
databases/compressed_storage.py:113:        Pseudo-acquisition for base's stuff that we don't
```

Next, search for a multiline ocurrence of "Pseudo-Palindromes" which should occur over lines 2655-2656 in word.py according to the last search. (Note: the 2nd line is prefixed with whitespace)

```
sage: search_src("Pseudo-Palindromes", multiline=True) # finds nothing

```

Not sure if the problem is due to the patch mentioned in #7018 needs including and updating for alpha0, or this ticket needs more work or theres something Ive missed.

(The patch from #7018 is already part of 4.3.2.alpha0, which is probably why applying it gave you errors.)

Since the string "Pseudo-Palindromes" doesn't appear, I think it is correct that searching for it returns nothing.  Try this instead:

```
sage: search_src("Pseudo-", "Palindromes", multiline=True)
```
Actually, though, Pseudo- and Palindromes appear on the same line, so this isn't the best test case.  How about

```
sage: search_src("Zamboni", "Infinite")

sage: search_src("Zamboni", "Infinite", multiline=True)
combinat/words/word.py
```
