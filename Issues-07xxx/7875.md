Running `sage -preparse somefile.sage` fails with

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/gvol/vcs/cur-sage/local/bin/sage-preparse", line 230, in <module>
    do_preparse(f)
  File "/Users/gvol/vcs/cur-sage/local/bin/sage-preparse", line 119, in do_preparse
    G = preparse_file(F, magic=False, do_time=True, ignore_prompts=False)
TypeError: preparse_file() got an unexpected keyword argument 'magic'
```

It looks like local/bin/sage-preparse wasn't updated to remove magic and ignore_prompts when sage/misc/preparser.py was.
