What the problem was:
The signal handler would call save_notebook(), which would stop the twisted server.  There was a handler on the server shutdown, "reactor.addSystemEventTrigger('before', 'shutdown', save_notebook)", that would call save_notebook() again.

Changes:
Moved the code that stops the server into the signal handler, and removed the save_notebook call.
