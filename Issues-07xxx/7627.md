I started sage 4.2.1 and did:

```

and the following error in the log:

I believe this was a notebook that was automatically converted from the old format.

With the patch, the rendered notebook settings page should contain only current (i.e., present in `sagenb.notebook.server_conf.defaults`) or "properly" annotated (see `sagenb.notebook.server_conf.defaults_descriptions`) settings.

The server should now also look up [incoming] request arguments in `defaults_descriptions`.
