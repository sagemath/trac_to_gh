Then I clicked on "Settings", and then "Notebook Settings", and I got the following webpage:

```
 Internal Server Error

An error occurred rendering the requested page. More information is available in the server log.
```
and the following error in the log:

```
I believe this was a notebook that was automatically converted from the old format.

<a id='comment:2'></a>With the patch, the rendered notebook settings page should contain only current (i.e., present in `sagenb.notebook.server_conf.defaults`) or "properly" annotated (see `sagenb.notebook.server_conf.defaults_descriptions`) settings.

The server should now also look up [incoming] request arguments in `defaults_descriptions`.
