The help of `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.new_variable` shows a way to define a default type for new variables, but it uses the argument vtype and pre-defined constants (`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.__INTEGER` for example) which is really ugly.

We should accept things like :

```
p.new_variable(boolean=True)
```
or

```
p.new_variable(type="boolean")
```

Few comments:

I think parameter 'name' should be documented. I couldn't find out any place where changing this parameter would affect at all. Also show() method lists 'binary' type variables as boolean variables, which I find bit ugly. Fixing that might be out of scope of this ticket though, as 'binary' is used extensively in code and documentation.

I'm not native English speaker so I might be wrong here, but I think this: "An exception is raised when two types are required" at the documentation should maybe say something like "An exception is raised when two types are _supplied_".
