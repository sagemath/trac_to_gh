The help of `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.new_variable` shows a way to define a default type for new variables, but it uses the argument vtype and pre-defined constants (`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.__INTEGER` for example) which is really ugly.

We should accept things like :

```
p.new_variable(boolean=True)
```
or

```
p.new_variable(type="boolean")
```

I'm not native English speaker so I might be wrong here, but I think this: "An exception is raised when two types are required" at the documentation should maybe say something like "An exception is raised when two types are _supplied_".
