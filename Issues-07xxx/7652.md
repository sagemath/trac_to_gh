Following Minh's idea from #6765, here is the first version of this document.

This patch documents the small improvement from #7637 (which is hence needed by the docstrings)

I have not applied this but only read the patch file.

Comments on the English grammar:

```
10	A linear program is the sum of two information : 
```
should read

```
10	A linear program consists of the following two pieces of information : 
```
I'm not an expert on complexity theory, but I think

```
29	is usually `NP`-Complete (= it can take exponential time, according to a  
30	widely-spread belief that `P\neq NP`) 
```
is not precisely correct as stated it it? Perhaps better would be

```
29	is usually `NP`-Complete (if `P\neq NP` then there is not polynomial time 30      algorithm solving a general MILP problem) 
```

Sorry, I don't understand this beginning of a sentence:

```
82	Can be written (quite naturally, I hope !) this way :: 
```

Even when you think there is an error somewhere, your patches are perfect Minh !!! This example failed because of the patch #7637 mentioned in the description of the TRAC ticket, which is a small and recent improvement made for Martin Albrecht who needed something of the kind :-)

Once this patch is applied, yours is too, and there is no error in the docstrings, with or without the -optional flag... Positive review ! Thank you for your help again ! :-)
