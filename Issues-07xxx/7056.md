**Introduction**

Sun's compiler on Solaris produces faster code than gcc, and is more reliable with 64-bit code than gcc. This ticket outlines the issues that need to be resolved to get Sage to build on Sun Studio, and are specific to Sun Studio. As more are discovered, I'll add them to the description, so it's easy to them all, rather than find them buried well down the page. 

In many cases, the bugs can potentially affect all compilers, but are only observed on Sun Studio. 

**Hardware used for testing**

Attempts were made to build Sage on the following two Solaris machines. Where a problem is detected on only one, or is suspect it might occur on only one machine, then the hostname is stated.  

|            |            |             |        |         |         |                |              |        |

|t2|Sun T5240|SPARC T2+|2|16|1167 MHz|sun4v|Solaris 10 update 7|Sun Studio 12|

**Bugs**

The actual bugs found, along with the trac number are listed below. The hostname is stated it if might be relevant. 

If the description is in italics, and marked with note number 11, then the problem in itself would not prevent Sage being built with Sun Studio, but would impact performance adversely.

**Notes**

1) This update should have benefits to Sage on any platform, with any compiler. It is however **absolutely essential** this is fixed for Sun Studio. 

2) Although discovered when testing with Sun Studio, the bug relates to the failure of a program to properly observe CC, CXX or SAGE_FORTRAN, so it can be expected to exist with any compiler.

3) The core dump was observed on hostname 'swan'. The failure to observe CC can be expected on any platform, but dumping core may be only on this machine. 

4) Checked only on the hostname. This may or may not be specific to that machine.

5) Tickets #7025, #7026 and #7033 are very closely related, as they all relate to a failure of a program to reconsise GMP being installed. Of course, it is not installed, but MPIR is, which is a substitute. 

6) Although easy to fix, to do some introduces a major impact on the time to build Sage. 

7) A fix is available, but either awaiting review, needing work, or reviewed and awaiting to be in the next release. 

8) This uses SCons, and in general anything using SCons appears to be a problem on Solaris. 

9) #7030 and #7031 are closely related, as both believe the Sun C++ compiler is broken, which it is not.

10) cliquer is seriously messed up, sometimes using gcc when you want it to use cc, and other times trying to use cc when you want it to use gcc! I believe it is incorrect use of SCons, so CC and CXX are not set properly. 

11) This does not actually prevent linbox building, but is just an indication performance will sufffer. Later ticket #7026 will cause the build to fail when using Sun Studio. 

12) gcc gives tons of warnings with this code, so I'm not at all surprised the Sun compiler rejects it. The author should be encouraged to sort out why his/her code should generate so many warnings/errors. 

13) The fix looks quite easy. 

14) This stops Sage building with gcc too, though one can circumvent this by commenting out 3 lines. The effect of commenting these out is not known.

+**Introduction**
+
 Sun's compiler on Solaris produces faster code than gcc, and is more reliable with 64-bit code than gcc. This ticket outlines the issues that need to be resolved to get Sage to build on Sun Studio, and are specific to Sun Studio. As more are discovered, I'll add them to the description, so it's easy to them all, rather than find them buried well down the page. 
 
 In many cases, the bugs can potentially affect all compilers, but are only observed on Sun Studio. 
 
-The hostname of at least one machine 
+**Hardware used for testing**
+
+Attempts were made to build Sage on the following two Solaris machines. Where a problem is detected on only one, or is suspect it might occur on only one machine, then the hostname is stated.
