I read this warning everytime I start Sage, so I have prepared a simple patch which replaces "Set" with the built-in type set. The patch must be applied inside sage-4.3.spkg and changes the file sage/combinat/matrices/latin.py.

I should mention that I did not built Sage from Sage's makefile alone but from a gentoo ebuild written by myself - using upstream Sage does not yield this warning. Anyway, since "sets" was deprecated since Python 2.6 this should be fixed.

I checked that the file is actually still there (and the above commands work fine for other patches).

Also, it seems that there is no user information and commit message with the ticket number in the patch file.

The command fails because the patch was not generated with mercurials diff command (at the time I reported I did not know that you had to use mercurial for generating patches). So the command works if you use the standard patch command: patch < patchfile.patch - which course overwrites the original files. I will upload an hg-ified patch later.

I can also clarify the need of this patch: If one updates ipython and runs testcases without this patch a lot of testcases will fail because python now prints deprecation warnings.
