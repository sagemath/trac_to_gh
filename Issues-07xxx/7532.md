That's *definitely* a bug.   No question about it. 
```

Addendum: apply the patches `trac_7532.patch` and `trac_7532-rings.patch`.  Depends on #7535.

return NotImplementedError

**Attachment:** [trac_7532.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7532/trac_7532.patch.gz)

The attached patch fixes an error in ell_rational_field.py which is the only one I see in that directory after applying the patches at #7535,

John (jhpalmieri), can you post the details of the errors you had on the other 3 files in that directory?

Hi John,

I think your patch really belongs on #7535, not here, since it fixes a doctest which was broken by the patches there.  My comment was, if I make another change, this time to ring.pyx (see the new patch), then I get the following doctest failures:

My pleasure.  I hope the release manager can see that trac_7532.patch only needs to be applied once, not both here and at #7535!

I only just discovered the joys of "sage -pt n" which makes testing the whole library a breeze: my research machine has 16 processors of which only a few are usually in use, so I put n=10 and a full test only takes 6 minutes and the -long test I did here took only 701s!
