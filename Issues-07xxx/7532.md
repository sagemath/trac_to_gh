<a id='comment:9'></a>Hi John,

I think your patch really belongs on #7535, not here, since it fixes a doctest which was broken by the patches there.  My comment was, if I make another change, this time to ring.pyx (see the new patch), then I get the following doctest failures:

<a id='comment:15'></a>I have got to the bottom of (at least) the problem with monsky_washnitser.py.  A quantity D is computed which is in `(Z/NZ)[This is the Trac macro *t* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#t-macro)` and non-zero, where N is a prime power not a prime.  At some point in the code we need 1/D.  This crashes (while `D^(-1)` is OK).  IN the inversion, soemone asks if the parent of D is an integral domain which cannot be determined, which raises a run-time error.  Before the patch it *returned* the error, and as it was returning something nonzero that was interpreted by python as "True".

I think I can fix this, but I am still working on it.  It will need a new patch -- sorry to have muddled matters by putting onto this ticket a patch which belonged to #7535.

My pleasure.  I hope the release manager can see that trac_7532.patch only needs to be applied once, not both here and at #7535!

I only just discovered the joys of "sage -pt n" which makes testing the whole library a breeze: my research machine has 16 processors of which only a few are usually in use, so I put n=10 and a full test only takes 6 minutes and the -long test I did here took only 701s!
