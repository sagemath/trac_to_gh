Just a small remark: there is no mmpf algorithm available, this should be removed from the docstring.

(and it needs #7375 ...)

typo in the pxd: assymptotically

isn't it recommended to add a doctest for each algorithm?
maybe just add `lqup(A)==lqup(A,algorithm="naive")` and `lqup(A)==lqup(A,algorithm="mmpf")`
