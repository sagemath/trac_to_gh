I should add though that this version of sage has the latest networkx package installed.
Would that screw things up?

You need more examples in the doctest section. Some of the options return something different than what the docs say, such as:

```
sage: g.flow(1,2, value_only=False)
[3.0, Pappus Graph: Graph on 18 vertices]

I corrected the documentation as I finally thought returning a graph would be much more useful :-)

I also added a more interesting example of what one can do with flows :-)
