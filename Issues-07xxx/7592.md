As the title says, this patch implements the flow function for Graphs ( weighted or not, directed or not )

I should add though that this version of sage has the latest networkx package installed.
Would that screw things up?

You need more examples in the doctest section. Some of the options return something different than what the docs say, such as:

```
sage: g.flow(1,2, value_only=False)
[3.0, Pappus Graph: Graph on 18 vertices]
