Hi,

I'm curious how users will even *know* to do this:

```
:To use SageTeX, both Sage and LaTeX need to know about it. If you have

LaTeX aware of it. The easiest thing to do is to ...
```

the only reason I know to do the things listed there so I can use SageTex is because I happen to have looked in the spkg after installing it and was looking at SPKG.txt.   When this package is standard in Sage, how will users know how to use and set it up?  Binaries won't even include that SPKG.txt file, since SAGE binaries don't include the contents of any spkg files. 

One solution, which I think would be extremely appropriate, is for you to add a new section to the Sage tutorial explaining how to use and get going with SageTex.  It's such a killer feature, that I think this is reasonable and worth it.    Let's make SageTex one of the centerpieces of Sage!

Hi,

Why not make all this config stuff automatic?

"For Linux/Unix users, do

```
  cp -r $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/ $HOME/texmf/
```
For OS X users with MacTeX:

```
  cp -r $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/ $HOME/Library/texmf/
```
After you've copied over the necessary files, you'll need to update
TeX's database so that it can find them. Run "`texhash $HOME/texmf`"
(replace the texmf directory as appropriate) to do this."

I don't think the above is as easy as it could be...  I like to make things really easy, e.g., setting up a twisted webserver to server the Sage notebook app is `notebook()`.

One problem that I see is that there are different TeX distributions, and not all of them may automatically look in home directories for a texmf/ tree. Some users may also not want the default installation of Sage (which will now install SageTeX) to create those directories and files in their $HOME. 

> I don't think the above is as easy as it could be...  I like to make things really easy, e.g., setting up a twisted webserver to server the Sage notebook app is `notebook()`.

I agree, it's not very simple, but we are now interacting not only with Sage (which is a large software system) but with TeX, another large -- and quite different -- software system. And unlike Sage, a TeX installation is supposed to be very stable and work the same way for a long, long time -- so I'm guessing we could run into very old systems.

I'll look and see if there's a reasonably effective way to autodetect if $HOME/texmf will get picked up by TeX. I also like the idea of putting some basic installation instructions and pointers to the rest of the documentation into the tutorial.

I'll put it in the "other" directory. I just guessed when I put sagetex.rst where it is.

> Also, is it worth mentioning in the documentation that if you have several copies of sagetex.sty lying around, you need to make sure that the most recent one gets read first?

Again, not a big deal, and if you think this should be done but don't want to bother now, it can be delayed to another ticket.

I'll add a bit about this. It's one of the biggest problems with SageTeX.

> For a future version of sagetex, should sagetex print its version each time you latex the file, so that users can see what version is actually being used?

I've thought about some kind of mechanism that would check for version mismatch, but don't have any easily-implementable ideas at the moment. I think this would be best in another ticket.

> The spkg looks good, and seems to indicate in the right places that it's now a standard spkg.  Does anything else need to be checked?

I don't think so. If you can install the spkg, follow the TeX installation directions, and successfully use it on a document, I think it's good to go.

I have 4.3.1 compiled, so I'll rebase and adjust the documentation, and open a ticket for the version mismatch stuff.

I've uploaded a new version of the documentation patch. It should apply to 4.3.1.

For the reference manual, I've kept sagetex.rst in the new "other" directory; when I put it in the root reference manual directory, Sphinx would try to look up a module named "sagetex" in the Sage library, get really confused, and overwrite sagetex.rst. I found that that didn't happen when I had the file in the "other" directory. If there's a better way to do this, let me know.

I added some text to the installation guide warning about having stale copies of sagetex.sty around.

Is `md5sum.check` meant to be a realization of the ideas at #329 specifically for the SageTeX spkg?

The SageTeX spkg is the only package implementing the integrity check ideas at #329. I find the verification instructions at #329 to be very helpful, which make me think about an idea for implementing a patch to automatically verify the check sum in an spkg. But if other spkg's in the future also have a file named `md5sum.check`, it can be difficult to know which check file belongs to which package (because they're all given the same name).

* The command to compute an md5 checksum is called by different names on different systems. 'md5' and 'md5sum' are two I've come across. On Solaris one has to use 'digest -a md5 filename'
* I suspect on some cut-down Linux distros, no such command exits - it is not part of POSIX. 
* In contrast, 'cksum' is specified by POSIX, it is portable across all platforms as POSIX specifies the algorithm, and further that whilst not quite such a good test as 'md5', the probability of getting a false result is less than 2.4 x 10^-10.
