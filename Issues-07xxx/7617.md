the only reason I know to do the things listed there so I can use SageTex is because I happen to have looked in the spkg after installing it and was looking at SPKG.txt.   When this package is standard in Sage, how will users know how to use and set it up?

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hi,

Why not make all this config stuff automatic?

"For Linux/Unix users, do

```
  cp -r $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/ $HOME/texmf/
```
For OS X users with MacTeX:

```
  cp -r $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/texmf/ $HOME/Library/texmf/
```
After you've copied over the necessary files, you'll need to update
TeX's database so that it can find them. Run "`texhash $HOME/texmf`"
(replace the texmf directory as appropriate) to do this."

I don't think the above is as easy as it could be...  I like to make things really easy, e.g., setting up a twisted webserver to server the Sage notebook app is `notebook()`.

One problem that I see is that there are different TeX distributions, and not all of them may automatically look in home directories for a texmf/ tree. Some users may also not want the default installation of Sage (which will now install SageTeX) to create those directories and files in their $HOME. 

> I don't think the above is as easy as it could be...  I like to make things really easy, e.g., setting up a twisted webserver to server the Sage notebook app is `notebook()`.


I agree, it's not very simple, but we are now interacting not only with Sage (which is a large software system) but with TeX, another large -- and quite different -- software system. And unlike Sage, a TeX installation is supposed to be very stable and work the same way for a long, long time -- so I'm guessing we could run into very old systems.

I'll look and see if there's a reasonably effective way to autodetect if $HOME/texmf will get picked up by TeX. I also like the idea of putting some basic installation instructions and pointers to the rest of the documentation into the tutorial.

I'll put it in the "other" directory. I just guessed when I put sagetex.rst where it is.

I'll add a bit about this. It's one of the biggest problems with SageTeX.

I've thought about some kind of mechanism that would check for version mismatch, but don't have any easily-implementable ideas at the moment. I think this would be best in another ticket.

I don't think so. If you can install the spkg, follow the TeX installation directions, and successfully use it on a document, I think it's good to go.

I have 4.3.1 compiled, so I'll rebase and adjust the documentation, and open a ticket for the version mismatch stuff.

Note I commented on #329 that I believe 'cksum' is better than md5, since

* The command to compute an md5 checksum is called by different names on different systems. 'md5' and 'md5sum' are two I've come across. On Solaris one has to use 'digest -a md5 filename'
* I suspect on some cut-down Linux distros, no such command exits - it is not part of POSIX. 
* In contrast, 'cksum' is specified by POSIX, it is portable across all platforms as POSIX specifies the algorithm, and further that whilst not quite such a good test as 'md5', the probability of getting a false result is less than 2.4 x 10^-10.
