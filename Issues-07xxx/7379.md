@interact(layout=[['a','b'],['c','d']])

The patch at #8959 doesn't quite allow the user to specify arbitrary HTML yet, but does allow the controls to be placed on any of the four sides of the interact.

Please, please review the patch at #8959 after reviewing this patch.  The patch there extends the functionality of the patch here, and should be easy to review after you've looked at this patch.

However, with this patch is a decorator that transparently and easily takes care of the objection.  Are there any objections now to moving the auto_update argument up to the `@`interact decorator (other than backwards compatibility)?

Mike? William? You guys were the ones that objected to `@`interact(auto_update=False) in the thread listed above.
