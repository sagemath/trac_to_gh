Here is a patch to the sagenb directory which allows for the following:

```
@interact(layout=[['a','b'],['c','d']])

The patch at #8959 doesn't quite allow the user to specify arbitrary HTML yet, but does allow the controls to be placed on any of the four sides of the interact.

Please, please review the patch at #8959 after reviewing this patch.  The patch there extends the functionality of the patch here, and should be easy to review after you've looked at this patch.
