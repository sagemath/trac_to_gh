The lrs SPKG.txt is just:

```
wstein@boxen:/tmp/wstein/lrs-4.2b.p0$ more SPKG.txt
* 2008-05-15 (Marshall Hampton)
*initial build
1. Deleted McGill-specific build stuff from makefile
2. Added SAGE_LOCAL gmp build locations
```
Fix this.  I was trying to figure out what the heck lrs is, and this wasn't helfpul.

Well, that's strange, I had a much better package that was supposedly included about a year ago:

http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/5018

I hadn't noticed since the actual program hadn't changed from p0 to p1.  I did all the work on that to prepare this for being a standard package, which I think it should be.
