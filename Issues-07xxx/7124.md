Minh,

Output of plain `brute_force()` looks suspicious, and when a ranking is suggested, errors are raised.  Tests are failing as well.  See attached.

Inside `brute_force()` method, should the `L` list be so empty?

```
18:13 < mvngu> rbeezer: The output of brute_force() is all the 312 possible
               dicipherments.
18:14 < mvngu> rbeezer: It uses a list of list for an indexing scheme that's
               meant for readability.
18:14 < rbeezer> but I'm not getting the keys that achieves them
18:14 < rbeezer> the L list is a list of empty lists??
18:14 < mvngu> rbeezer: Let me upload my recent patches....
18:14 < rbeezer> aah, that'd help  ;-) ;-)
18:18 < mvngu> rbeezer: Uploaded patches.
18:18 < mvngu> rbeezer: Note the ticket dependency.
18:19 < rbeezer> thanks - do they include whatever prompted you to take the 
                 ticket back to "needs work"
18:19 < mvngu> rbeezer: yes
18:19 < rbeezer> In other words, should I attempt a full review in the next 6 
                 hours, or no?
18:19 < mvngu> rbeezer: I fixed some documentation typos, add an example on the 
               decimation cipher.
18:20 < mvngu> rbeezer: And yes, I think it's ready for a full review.
18:20 < mvngu> rbeezer: Thank you very much for spending time on these crypto 
               stuff!

At present, here's what happening with the method `brute_force()`: it returns a list of lists `L` that contains all the possible decipherments.

I think this is perhaps why you said the output of `brute_force()` is odd. In the method `brute_force()` of the shift cipher from #7123, it provides both the key together with the corresponding candidate decipherment. In the current affine cipher implementation, I forgot about the output of the brute force method in #7123. OK, move to "needs work" again.

Hi Minh,

Two comments:

1.  I think `inverse_key()` is broken.  The constant term is always identical, for example, run

`x=S.random_key(); print x, S.inverse_key(*x)` 

repeatedly.

This shouldn't happen even for a=1 as is written in the doctests, since when a=1 it is a shift system.  For testing, the inverse of (a,b)=(5,7) should be (21,9).  You can test this by enchipering with one key and deciphering with the other, results should be the same (this might be good thing to do in the doctests).

Maybe you just need subtraction someplace where you have a addition, or...

2.  Would it make sense to build the list `A` of invertible linear coefficients in the `brute_force` method as part of `__init__` for the cryptosystem?  Then you could skip some of the gcd-stuff.  For example when building a random key, you could just grab a linear coefficient, instead of repeatedly testing.  Or when checking validity for a new key, you could just test on the list.  Done right, the generation of `A` could easily generalize to a new alphabet length for a new monoid as the alphabet.

And I have skipped some of the GCD computation with the above implementation of a list of invertible elements in the multiplicative group of `ZZ/nZZ`.

Done according to your suggestion.

I can see in my mind how to implement this based on the implementation of generating invertible elements in the multiplicative group of `ZZ/nZZ`. I think this would entail changing the implementation of the class(es) that implement say, the hexadecimal monoid. Getting the affine cipher to support the hexadecimal and radix-64 monoids should be another ticket in itself.

Replying to [mvngu](#comment%3A12):

Well, I didn't really say exactly what `inverse_key()` should be on purpose - figuring it was your thesis and I shouldn't have all the fun.

Wikipedia is right on this one and it's what you have implemented in the deciphering routine.

If enciphering is accomplished by  x -> ax+b  (ie key is (a,b)) then 

deciphering is accomplished by  `x -> a^{-1}(x-b) = a^{-1}x - a^{-1}b`

so the inverse key would be the pair `(a^{-1}, -a^{-1}b)`

Note the constant term.  In other words, the inverse key should be what you use for the same algorithm (linear function mod 26) to reverse the process, ie create the inverse function.

Try the following: start with plain text P, encipher with key (a,b) to get ciphertext C.  Now encipher C with the inverse key, and you should get P back.  This would be a good doctest someplace, maybe for `inverse_key()`, to demonstrate its intent.

Minh,

Some specific comments:

1.  In `AffineCryptoSystem` there are comments about the list L which can probably be deleted.

2.  In `__call__` the sanity check computes d and checks d == 1.  This could be removed if you trust your `_invertible` list.

3.  Docstring on `inverse_key` has an odd test about euler_phi=12, a list of invertibles is computed, etc.  Not sure this is really germane.

> 1.  In `AffineCryptoSystem` there are comments about the list L which can probably be deleted.

Fixed.





> 2.  In `__call__` the sanity check computes d and checks d == 1.  This could be removed if you trust your `_invertible` list.

I have removed the test. In its place, I added some comments explaining why we don't need to test that each `a` is coprime to `n`, the alphabet size.





> 3.  Docstring on `inverse_key` has an odd test about euler_phi=12, a list of invertibles is computed, etc.  Not sure this is really germane.

That doctest is meant to explain what sort of values that `a` can take on if `(a,b)` is to be a secret key. I have rewritten the doctest to explain this.

This should be pretty much read to go now, but I've got a six errors being raised in the doctests.  They all seem to be due to lines 2912 and 3158 of  classical.py  which are identical

`OM.setdefault(e, 0.0)`

The error is

`AttributeError: 'DiscreteProbabilitySpace' object has no attribute 'setdefault'`

Alright, against 4.2 there are no doctest errors in sage/crypto, so this is done.

Positive review.

Release manager: apply two patches - first "affine" then "cryptanalysis."
