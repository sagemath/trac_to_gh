<a id='comment:6'></a>Minh,

Output of plain `brute_force()` looks suspicious, and when a ranking is suggested, errors are raised.  Tests are failing as well.  See attached.

Inside `brute_force()` method, should the `L` list be so empty?

18:13 < mvngu> rbeezer: The output of brute_force() is all the 312 possible
               dicipherments.
18:14 < mvngu> rbeezer: It uses a list of list for an indexing scheme that's
               meant for readability.
18:14 < rbeezer> but I'm not getting the keys that achieves them
18:14 < rbeezer> the L list is a list of empty lists??
18:14 < mvngu> rbeezer: Let me upload my recent patches....
18:14 < rbeezer> aah, that'd help  ;-) ;-)
18:18 < mvngu> rbeezer: Uploaded patches.
18:18 < mvngu> rbeezer: Note the ticket dependency.
18:19 < rbeezer> thanks - do they include whatever prompted you to take the 
                 ticket back to "needs work"
18:19 < mvngu> rbeezer: yes
18:19 < rbeezer> In other words, should I attempt a full review in the next 6 
                 hours, or no?
18:19 < mvngu> rbeezer: I fixed some documentation typos, add an example on the 
               decimation cipher.
18:20 < mvngu> rbeezer: And yes, I think it's ready for a full review.
18:20 < mvngu> rbeezer: Thank you very much for spending time on these crypto

<a id='comment:11'></a>Hi Minh,

Two comments:

1.  I think `inverse_key()` is broken.  The constant term is always identical, for example, run

`x=S.random_key(); print x, S.inverse_key(*x)` 

repeatedly.

This shouldn't happen even for a=1 as is written in the doctests, since when a=1 it is a shift system.  For testing, the inverse of (a,b)=(5,7) should be (21,9).  You can test this by enchipering with one key and deciphering with the other, results should be the same (this might be good thing to do in the doctests).

Maybe you just need subtraction someplace where you have a addition, or...

2.  Would it make sense to build the list `A` of invertible linear coefficients in the `brute_force` method as part of `__init__` for the cryptosystem?  Then you could skip some of the gcd-stuff.  For example when building a random key, you could just grab a linear coefficient, instead of repeatedly testing.  Or when checking validity for a new key, you could just test on the list.  Done right, the generation of `A` could easily generalize to a new alphabet length for a new monoid as the alphabet.

The constant term is always identical, for example, run\n  \n{{{\nx=S.random_key(); print x, S.inverse_key(*x)\n}}}\n> repeatedly. This shouldn't happen even for a=1 as is written in the doctests, since when a=1 it is a shift system.  For testing, the inverse of (a,b)=(5,7) should be (21,9).  You can test this by enchipering with one key and deciphering with the other, results should be the same (this might be good thing to do in the doctests).\n\n\nI may be misunderstanding your comment here, so please tell me if that's the case. Any key `(a,b) in ZZ/nZZ x ZZ/nZZ` of the affine cipher is such that `gcd(a,n) = 1`. So you're saying that the inverse key corresponding to `(a, b)` is `(a^{-1}, -b)` where `a^{-1}` is the multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `n`? If that is the case, then the current implementation of `inverse_key()` is clearly broken:\n\n```\n        try:\n            from copy import copy\n            from sage.rings.arith import inverse_mod\n            n = self.alphabet_size()\n            return (inverse_mod(a, n), copy(b))\n        except:\n            raise ValueError(\"(a, b) = (%s, %s) is outside the range of acceptable values for a key of this affine cipher.\" % (a, b))\n```\n\nHow then would one use the above defined inverse key to decrypt a ciphertext? The current implementation of the method `deciphering()` follows this Wikipedia description of the encryption and decryption functions of the affine cipher:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher\n\nThis agrees with the following text that I have access to:\n\n* Doug Stinson. \"Cryptography: Theory and Practice\" 3rd edition.\n* Wade Trappe and Lawrence C. Washington. \"Introduction to Cryptography with Coding Theory\"\n\n\n\n\n\n> Maybe you just need subtraction someplace where you have a addition, or...\n\n\nI don't quite understand this comment. Can you please explain it?\n\n\n\n\n\n> 2.  Would it make sense to build the list `A` of invertible linear coefficients in the `brute_force` method as part of `__init__` for the cryptosystem? \n\n\nYes it does make sense to do so, and I have implemented this in response to your suggestion. The resulting code of the affine crypto module looks less \"ugly\" from my point of view. Thank you, Rob.

You can test this by enchipering with one key and deciphering with the other, results should be the same (this might be good thing to do in the doctests).


I may be misunderstanding your comment here, so please tell me if that's the case. Any key `(a,b) in ZZ/nZZ x ZZ/nZZ` of the affine cipher is such that `gcd(a,n) = 1`. So you're saying that the inverse key corresponding to `(a, b)` is `(a^{-1}, -b)` where `a^{-1}` is the multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `n`? If that is the case, then the current implementation of `inverse_key()` is clearly broken:

```
        try:
            from copy import copy
            from sage.rings.arith import inverse_mod
            n = self.alphabet_size()
            return (inverse_mod(a, n), copy(b))
        except:
            raise ValueError("(a, b) = (%s, %s) is outside the range of acceptable values for a key of this affine cipher." % (a, b))
```

How then would one use the above defined inverse key to decrypt a ciphertext? The current implementation of the method `deciphering()` follows this Wikipedia description of the encryption and decryption functions of the affine cipher:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher

This agrees with the following text that I have access to:

* Doug Stinson. "Cryptography: Theory and Practice" 3rd edition.
* Wade Trappe and Lawrence C. Washington. "Introduction to Cryptography with Coding Theory"

I don't quite understand this comment. Can you please explain it?





> 2.  Would it make sense to build the list `A` of invertible linear coefficients in the `brute_force` method as part of `__init__` for the cryptosystem? 


Yes it does make sense to do so, and I have implemented this in response to your suggestion. The resulting code of the affine crypto module looks less "ugly" from my point of view. Thank you, Rob. Please see the latest version of the patches.

And I have skipped some of the GCD computation with the above implementation of a list of invertible elements in the multiplicative group of `ZZ/nZZ`.





> For example when building a random key, you could just grab a linear coefficient, instead of repeatedly testing. 


Done according to your suggestion.





> Or when checking validity for a new key, you could just test on the list. 


Done according to your suggestion.





>  Done right, the generation of `A` could easily generalize to a new alphabet length for a new monoid as the alphabet.


I can see in my mind how to implement this based on the implementation of generating invertible elements in the multiplicative group of `ZZ/nZZ`. I think this would entail changing the implementation of the class(es) that implement say, the hexadecimal monoid. Getting the affine cipher to support the hexadecimal and radix-64 monoids should be another ticket in itself.

Well, I didn't really say exactly what `inverse_key()` should be on purpose - figuring it was your thesis and I shouldn't have all the fun.

Wikipedia is right on this one and it's what you have implemented in the deciphering routine.

If enciphering is accomplished by  x -> ax+b  (ie key is (a,b)) then 

deciphering is accomplished by  `x -> a^{-1}(x-b) = a^{-1}x - a^{-1}b`

so the inverse key would be the pair `(a^{-1}, -a^{-1}b)`

Note the constant term.  In other words, the inverse key should be what you use for the same algorithm (linear function mod 26) to reverse the process, ie create the inverse function.

Try the following: start with plain text P, encipher with key (a,b) to get ciphertext C.  Now encipher C with the inverse key, and you should get P back.  This would be a good doctest someplace, maybe for `inverse_key()`, to demonstrate its intent.

Some specific comments:

1.  In `AffineCryptoSystem` there are comments about the list L which can probably be deleted.

2.  In `__call__` the sanity check computes d and checks d == 1.  This could be removed if you trust your `_invertible` list.

3.  Docstring on `inverse_key` has an odd test about euler_phi=12, a list of invertibles is computed, etc.  Not sure this is really germane.
