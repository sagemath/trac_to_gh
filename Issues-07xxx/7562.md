From sage-devel:

```
In [143]: [binomial(1,1),binomial(1,2),binomial(1,3),binomial(1,4)] 
Out[143]: [1, 0, 0, 0] 
In [144]: [binomial(1.0,1),binomial(1.0,2),binomial(1.0,3),binomial 
(1.0,4)] 
Out[144]: [1.00000000000000, 0.000000000000000, NaN, NaN] 
```
The problem is this:

```
sage: x = RealNumber('1.0')
sage: P = x.parent()
sage: P
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: gamma(x+1)/gamma(P(Integer(4)+1))/gamma(x-Integer(4)+1)
NaN
sage: gamma(x-Integer(4)+1)
NaN
```
So we'll have to put in yet another check...

Here is a patch that should fix this issue. Note that for x a
negative floating point integer we hit gamma function poles both
in the numerator and denominator. An alternative formula is used
in the patch to avoid this.

By the way, is the cc field above supposed to notify me by mail?
I did not get any.

This seems to work fine, and agrees with integer calculations.  Obviously passes tests.

But:

```
sage: binomial(0,0)
1
sage: binomial(0.,0)
NaN
```

I don't know which is the usual convention, but they should probably agree.
