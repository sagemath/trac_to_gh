In 4.2.1.alpha0:

```
sage: f(x,y)=ln(x)
sage: P=plot3d(f,(x,0,1),(y,0,1))
sage: P
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (16, 0))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip a lot>
ValueError: math domain error
```
Switch to (x,0.1,1), and all is well.  I am pretty sure the problem is that line 404 in plot/plot3d/parametric_surface.pyx doesn't have an exception handler for log(0) or other such nan type values:

```
sage: math.log(0)
<snip>
ValueError: math domain error
```
But in the plotting context, it's silly not to just ignore this; we check for things like this all the time:

```
sage: plot(log,0,1)
<works fine>
```
For now it would probably be enough to fix it for the z variable.

This works for me in 4.6:

```
sage: f(x,y)=ln(x)
sage: P=plot3d(f,(x,0,1),(y,0,1))
sage: P
```

You're right, but I am baffled as to why.   The command `./sage -hg log -p ./devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_surface.pyx` doesn't give me any indication anything of this type has changed recently.  

If this worked on both Linux and Mac, and some other edge cases worked like this, I'd be satisfied to close this ticket with a patch that documented said edge cases worked; we can always fix other things like this as they occur.
