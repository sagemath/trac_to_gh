Cython 0.12 isn't released yet, but should be shortly, and this ticket is about getting Sage to compile and pass all tests.

Spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/robertwb/cython/cython-0.12.spkg

Also depends on patch at #7023 (to be applied before the attached patch).

It looks like 0.12 is out now.  From the Cython webpage:

```
The latest release of Cython is 0.12 (released 2009-11-23).
```

Is the official release in the spkg above, or were there changes since the spkg above?

And congrats on the 0.12 release!  I'm excited about the improvements in it!
