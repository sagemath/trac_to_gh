```
The code

R.<x> = AA[]
v1 = QQbar.polynomial_root(AA.common_polynomial(x^4 + 3*x^2 + 1),\
 CIF(RIF(-RR(2.7018838812806391e-55), RR(2.5616917931009833e-55)),\
 RIF(RR(1.6180339887498947), RR(1.6180339887498949))))
v2 = (2/3*v1^3 + 2/3*v1^2 + 4/3*v1 + 1).norm()
sqrt(v2 - 1)

yields the error

NameError: global name 'AlgebriacNumber' is not defined

Apparently there is a small typo in line 3394 of the file qqbar.py

That's known.  And it was  fixed by an earlier version of the patch at
#6887 which was merged in 4.3.1.alpha1.  But I now see that that fix
has got lost, very strange.  It will need fixing again....
