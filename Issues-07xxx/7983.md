The 'descents' and 'major_index' methods of a Tableau return what are more properly known as 'i_descents' and the 'i_maj' statistic.  These should be renamed accordingly, and the proper statistics put in their place.  See, eg., Richard Stanley--Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol. 2 for a reference to the usual definition.

Yes, I thought this would be an issue.  I actually made the patch a while ago but thought that precisely your objection would be raised.  Anyways, I decided to send it in and see what would happen.  It sounds like you have a good solution.

About a new name:  is "Major_Index" a bad idea?  I don't know about sage's naming conventions.

<a id='comment:6'></a>3 years... not bad.

I've remade the patch from scratch (arattan's one didn't apply, unsurprisingly given its age) without renaming the existing `descents`, `major_index` etc. functions. While I agree with arattan that these functions should be deprecated and renamed, I think it's a top priority to get the correct ones out ASAP, under whatever name possible (I chose `standard_descents` and `standard_major_index`). I have taken the liberty to edit the docstrings of the old functions to explain that they are not what they seem to be; Jason and me are hardly the only people to trip over this. (To make things worse, the only two examples for the `major_index` function used to be cases where it happens to have the same values as the "correct" one!!)

The patch I attached does a few more things:

- Various improvements in the documentation of `tableaux.py`. The doc of `promotion` now warns about its nonstandard definition (#14641). A doctest has been added to check the equivalence between two definitions of promotion (this takes a couple seconds; let me know if that's too much).

- `up` and `down` methods are moved to `StandardTableaux` (look at what they do to see why) and now return the correct result for the empty tableau.

- The empty tableau is now correctly recognized as being rectangular.

Here's stuff that has not been done (partly because I am not sure about them -- comments are welcome):

- Copy/move attacking_pairs method to partitions.

- Generalize promotion_inverse to non-rectangular tableaux (particularly important since I believe promotion_inverse is what many people just call promotion).

- `Tableau([[]])` is standard and distinct from `Tableau([])`. Is this bad?

- Copy/move functionality to skew tableaux (this should be one separate huge ticket once other stuff is done, I guess).

- Allow creating tableaux of various ilks without checking the tableau conditions. This should be mostly called internally, so as to avoid having lots of redundant checking at runtime.

I have been building this patch on sage-5.10rc1 with only #8392 applied.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hey Darij,

Two things I notice from a quick lookthrough:

1. `up()` and friends I think should remain where they are because there's no assumptions made on the initial tableau. However I do think there are some assumptions about standardness made in their implementation...
2. The reference to Stanley is indented one too many times.

I'll do a more through look-through and we can talk about 1. once I get to Orsay tomorrow.

done!

I've made one more minor change right now: `.up()` now outputs standard tableaux, not tableaux (just a question of casting the right type; they were standard, of course).

Best regards,
Darij (in Bures now)

PS, in case this was Travis's concern: I've grepped for appearances of `.up()`, `.up_list()`, `.down()` and `.down_list()` in the source code, and found only 2-3 files apart from `tableau.py` where these were used. They were used in a different context in those files, and my changes didn't break their doctests. Of course, someone's local code might get broken, but I don't know a good way to avoid that making any change at all. One minor issue that I did introduce is that execution of `.up()` and `.down()` now takes a tiny bit longer because of checking for standardness. I'll deal with it when I add a `check_input` parameter throughout `tableaux.py`.
