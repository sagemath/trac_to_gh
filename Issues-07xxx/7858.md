WebKit browsers (e.g., Chrome, Chromium, Safari) are picky about missing `Content-Type` headers (cf. #6742).  In particular, we should add them to dynamically generated JavaScript.

Also, from Firebug's console:

```
syntax error
    KEY_SHIFT = "16,16"
```
We should declare each variable explicitly (to avoid implicit globals), e.g.,

```js
var KEY_SHIFT = "16,16";
```
