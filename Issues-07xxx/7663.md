This is weird. Occassionaly, in the SAGE notebook, version 4.2.1, the
last characters of output after evaluating a cell are supressed. I've
tried all of string.printable: the only characters supressed are "S",
"A", "G", "E" and "_". No kidding.
 Just try:

print "ASAVFDBAAGGG___EEESS"
///
ASAVFDB


print "ASAVFDBAAGGG___EEESS."
///
ASAVFDBAAGGG___EEESS.

 Is this a private joke or an amazing coincidence?

Pablo

For what it's worth, I don't see this problem with the latest at #6855.  I *may* have inadvertently fixed it.
