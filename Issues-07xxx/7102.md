Testing Sage-4.1.2-alpha4, I saw that the old failure from #6379 somehow was resurrected (probably by using some new version of the R package that has changed its internationalized warning messages). To reproduce the failure, do something (or nothing, see also #6379) like

```
export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8
```
from a (sage -sh) shell and then you'll get:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py"
