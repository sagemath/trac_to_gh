Testing Sage-4.1.2-alpha4, I saw that the old failure from #6379 somehow was resurrected (probably by using some new version of the R package that has changed its internationalized warning messages). To reproduce the failure, do something (or nothing, see also #6379) like

```
export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8
```
from a (sage -sh) shell and then you'll get:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py"             
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/Shared/sage/sage-4.1.2.alpha4/devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py", line 549:
    sage: r.library('foobar')

    ...
    ImportError: ...

2 items had failures:

***Test Failed*** 2 failures.
For whitespace errors, see the file /Users/georgweber/.sage//tmp/.doctest_r.py
         [7.3 s]
exit code: 1024
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py"
```
Fortunately, I fiddled around with this file and this bug more than once (see also #6594, #6646), so I knew where to look. Hopefully, this zombie is put down to rest ...
