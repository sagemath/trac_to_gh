The method "longest_increasing_subsequence" was computing the longest increasing factors of the permutation!

This patch fixes the problem.

I dislike the name `length_of_lis` ! I whould never had gessed the meaning of `lis`. Is it so painful to type `length_of_longest_increasing_subsequence` or `longest_incressing_subsequence_length` ? 

The latter is my favourite... 

I cc this to sage-combinat to have a vote. Add set the status to "needs info".

Hi Florent,

I agree... I think "longest_increasing_subsequence_length" is also better because it will be near "longest_increasing_subsequences" in the method list...

Best,

Replying to [vferay](#comment%3A6):
> ok I changed the name. What shall I do now?

First you should say something like:
"I just submitted a new version of the patch which is ready for review."

Then after that you should change the status which is currently "needs info" to "needs review" (see the frame at the bottom of the page) and then wait if someone react by putting a positive review or another request...

And finally for the release manager you should tell that only `permutations_fix_longest_increasing_subsequence_7200_vf.patch`
should be applied.

As you can see, I've done this for you :-). So everything is ok... 

I'm reviewing the patch...

Florent
