We have not been doctesting SageNB files as often as we test Sage files.

Please apply

* [attachment: trac_7650-scripts_doctest_force_lib_v5.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7650/trac_7650-scripts_doctest_force_lib_v5.patch.gz) to the scripts repository.  This adds two options to `sage -t`: `-sagenb` tests all SageNB files and `-force_lib` tests files *as if* they live in `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`, i.e., in the Sage library.

* [attachment: trac_7650-sagenb_doctesting_v6.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7650/trac_7650-sagenb_doctesting_v6.patch.gz) **and** [attachment: trac_7650-reviewer_v2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7650/trac_7650-reviewer_v2.patch.gz) to the sagenb repository.  This fixes broken SageNB tests.

and replace `SAGE_ROOT/makefile` with

* [attachment: makefile](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7650/makefile.gz).  This makes `make test` and `make ptest` test all SageNB files, too.

**Please note: The attachments (or their descriptions) are switched.**  I apologize for this.

Anyway, with the scripts repository patch, we can do, e.g.,

```sh
$ sage -t --force_lib sagenb/
```
With the sagenb repository patch applied to #7625 + #7483 + #7482 + #7514 + #7648, all tests but 3 pass.  The failures are in `sagenb/misc/sageinspect.py` (cf. #7514).  The Selenium tests still pass.

Remarks:

* I hope I did not create false-negatives.
* [This sage-notebook thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_thread/thread/9dd524690bb1588b/38855ecc2819205a?#38855ecc2819205a) *might* be relevant to some tests that evaluate cells.
* I "untabified" `cell.py`, `worksheet.py`, `notebook.py`, and `twist.py`.
* I added `'nodoctest'` to `simple/twist.py`, since at least one test appears to hang indefinitely.  I don't know why.
* Feel free to lower the priority.

I like this patch a lot.  However, a nitpick: get rid of the / before tmp here:

```
SAGE_TESTDIR = os.path.join(DOT_SAGE, "/tmp") 
```
Likewise, elsewhere in the patch there are a bunch of os.path.joins combined with explicit* slashes.  

Regarding adding sage -t sagenb, etc., to sage-test or whatever: "yes!"

Yes, but it's already here.  :)  In the course of fixing many failed doctests, I noticed it and a few other small problems:

* In `run_notebook.notebook_twisted`: Replaced `nb.directory()` (not defined) with `nb._dir`.
* In `worksheet`: Replaced `self.__collaborators` (`AttributeError`) with `self.collaborators()` in a few places.
* In `worksheet.set_filename`:

```diff
-        self.__dir = os.path.join(self.notebook().worksheet_directory(), filename)
+        self.__dir = os.path.join(self.notebook()._dir, filename)
```
* In `worksheet.tags`:

```diff
             d = dict(self.__user_view)
         except AttributeError:
             self.user_view(self.owner())
-            d = self.__user_view
+            d = copy.copy(self.__user_view)
         for user, val in d.iteritems():
-            d[user] = [val]
+            if not isinstance(val, list):
+                d[user] = [val]
         return d
```
 This ensures the tests in `Worksheet.reconstruct_from_basic` pass and that calling `tags` does not alter the current user view, e.g., turning `1` into `[1]`.

Also:

* Removed argument `verbose` (obsolete) from `Cell.set_introspect_html`.
