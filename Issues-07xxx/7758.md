Expected:
    Maximization:
      x0 + x1
    Constraints:
      -3*x0 + 2*x1 <= 2
    Variables:
      x1 is a real variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
      x0 is a real variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
Got:
    Maximization:
      x0 + x1
    Constraints:
      -3*x0 + 2*x1 <= 2
    Variables:
      x0 is a real variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
      x1 is a real variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
