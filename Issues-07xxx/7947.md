You can tell this is not a rounding issue from the error message.

This is a subtle bug which arises because negative numbers are created when the round and ceil functions cause upper and lower bounds to inadvertently move past each other.  The patch discards partial vectors where this happens by incrementing (successively if necessary) to the next possible partial vector, which is the correct thing to do.  Also the patch omits using a condition (i<n-1) as in Comment 3a slightly below the patch, which is ok because zero will always be an allowed value for the (n-1)st entry since that first allowed interval is not shifted at all.

The patch looks good. =)
