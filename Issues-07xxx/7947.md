After the fix in #7100 (rounding issues), there's still a bug in `the vectors_by_length()` code:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: Q = QuadraticForm(ZZ, 4, [1,-1,-1,-1, 1,0,0, 4,-3, 4])
sage: Q.vectors_by_length(3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
You can tell this is not a rounding issue from the error message.

The patch looks good. =)
