A special case of #7303 ( which is much easier and efficient to implement ) is to find a strongly connected orientation of the edges of a bridgeless connected graph.

This can be done using the short algorithm given in :
Schriver Combinatorial optimization
Volume B

1. You need to describe what a strongly connected orientation is in your docstrings.

2. You also need to clearly describe the output, i.e. what type of object is it...

3. The function shouldn't assume but rather check whether the necessary conditions are met, and print a helpful error message if they aren't. If you're concerned about speed, then you can make use of a `check=False` option.

Other than these minor issues, the patch applies and passes tests, and looks good.
