I have attached a new `README.txt` file. The patch `readme.patch` shows the differences between the old and new README.txt files. You should not apply that patch because the `SAGE_ROOT` directory is not under revision control. Instead, you should only replace the old `README.txt` with the newer, attached `README.txt`. A related ticket is #7553.
