}
```
The following code fails

```
y=function('y',x)
eqn=x*diff(y,x)^2-(1+x*y)*diff(y,x)+y == 0
desolve(eqn,y)
```
However, Maxima is able to produce the solution using contrib_ode command. If ode2 fails, Sage should call contrib_ode

maxima commands

```
load('contrib_ode)$
eqn:x*'diff(y,x)^2-(1+x*y)*'diff(y,x)+y=0;
contrib_ode(eqn,y,x);
```

will (hope) solved in few days together with 6479 which was supposed to be fixed, but needs more work.
