A quick check of the code reveals the issue: we use `os.popen3` inside the hg interface, which we can't easily use to get the return code. (Or, at least, I don't know how to do it.) Maybe we should file an enhancement ticket to rewrite those lines to use `subprocess.Popen`, and correctly give back the return code?",
