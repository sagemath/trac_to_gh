There are several ways, e.g.

```
sage: v = G.random_vertex()
sage: v in G
sage: G.has_vertex(v)
True
```
etc.
You can also do

```
sage: G.random_edge(labels=False)
(...,...)
sage: G.random_edge(labels=True)
(...,...,...)
```

Hello !! 

I added this parameter because I can not stand the fact that Graph.edges() returns triples instead of pairs, so I constantly use the labels = False argument :-)

I've tested this patch on sage 4.3.4. All tests passed, and the documentation generated with the `browse_sage_doc` function looks ok (we really need to include those graph files in the tree for the reference manual). I made a few changes, only consisting of formatting of code and documentation.

Positive review.
