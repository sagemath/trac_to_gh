The [attachment:trac_7404-css_worksheet_title.patch first take] appears to work, although a *very* long title is visible under and beyond the "Save/Discard" buttons.

I'm sure this is just one way to [attempt to] do it --- I'm not a CSS expert.  Please feel to free to replace it.  Either way, we should check that a candidate works in IE.

By the way, this patch may depend on other recent sagenb patches.  Here's my current queue (ignore the version numbers):

 (2) You should always set a milestone for the ticket.  It helps a *lot* in keeping tickets from getting totally lost. 

 (3) This patch makes all the worksheet titles in the homescreen vanish, so that's a serious bug.  See http://wstein.org/home/wstein/tmp/7404-a.png
