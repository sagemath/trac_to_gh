Attachment: **[trac_7404-css_worksheet_title.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7404/trac_7404-css_worksheet_title.patch.gz)**

The [first take](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7404/trac_7404-css_worksheet_title.patch.gz) appears to work, although a *very* long title is visible under and beyond the "Save/Discard" buttons.

I'm sure this is just one way to [attempt to] do it --- I'm not a CSS expert.  Please feel to free to replace it.  Either way, we should check that a candidate works in IE.

By the way, this patch may depend on other recent sagenb patches.  Here's my current queue (ignore the version numbers):

```
trac_7316-sageinspect_defn.patch
trac_7318-sphinxify_confdir.patch
trac_7309-javascript-sage_v2.patch
trac_7310-modals.6.patch

But it's likely that several of these commute.
