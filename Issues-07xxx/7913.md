sage: 5.is_prime_power(flag=1)  # defined in sage/rings/integer.pyx
/usr/local/src/sage-config/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:2881: DeprecationWarning: the 'flag' argument to is_prime_power() is no longer used
See http://trac.sagemath.org/16878 for details.
  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
True
```

The line `exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)` is not very useful.

This is because Cython functions do not add a new stack level.

<a id='comment:1'></a>This looks like a stacklevel mismatch between python and cython code. Some other examples in pure python:

```
sage: numerical_sqrt(3)
/home/mjo/src/sage-5.0.beta1/local/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: numerical_sqrt is deprecated, use sqrt(x, prec=n) instead
  #!/usr/bin/env python
sqrt(3)
```

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[0]]).union( Polyhedron(vertices=[[1]]) )
/home/mjo/src/sage-5.0.beta1/local/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: (Since Sage Version 4.4.4) The function union is replaced by convex_hull.
  #!/usr/bin/env python
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^1 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices.
```

If we pick something in a `*.pyx` file,

```
sage: p = m.copy()
/home/mjo/src/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/iplib.py:2260: DeprecationWarning: the .copy() method is deprecated; please use the copy() function instead, for example, copy(M)
  exec code_obj in self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns
```

```
sage: x.lgamma()
/home/mjo/src/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/iplib.py:2260: DeprecationWarning: The lgamma() function is deprecated. Use log_gamma() instead.
  exec code_obj in self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns
log_gamma(x)
```


(notice the iplib.py/sage-ipython difference). In a python file, the stacklevel of EllipticCurve seems to be correct while the one for e.g. lgamma() is off by one. Here's a test.py file:

```
from sage.all import *

print "Calling EllipticCurve..."
EllipticCurve(ZZ(1))

print "\nCalling x.lgamma()"
var('x').lgamma()
```

And running it:

```
$ sage test.py 
Calling EllipticCurve...
test.py:4: DeprecationWarning: 'EllipticCurve(j)' is deprecated; use 'EllipticCurve_from_j(j)' or 'EllipticCurve(j=j)' instead.
  EllipticCurve(ZZ(1))

Calling x.lgamma()
sys:1: DeprecationWarning: The lgamma() function is deprecated. Use log_gamma() instead.
```

Adjusting the stacklevel fixes one, but breaks the other.

+The line `exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)` is not very useful.
+
+This is because Cython functions do not add a new stack level.
