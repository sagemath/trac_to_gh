We ought to make collaborative worksheet editing somewhat more intuitive, even if we stop short (for now) of implementing full-strength [operational transformations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) or employing the [Wave Federation Protocol](http://www.waveprotocol.org/).

From [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7254#comment:11) at #7254:

     The browser and server do not update their `state_number`s if a new cell is added at the end of a sheet, when text cells are added, or cells are deleted. Should we add these to the list, along with the `'delete_all_output'`, `'pretty_print'`, `'system'` worksheet commands?
