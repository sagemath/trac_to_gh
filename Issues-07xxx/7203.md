One of changes made in my recent update of prereq (#7021) from 0.3 to 0.4 was to exit when there was a mix of GNU and non-GNU compilers. 

Whilst this works if you have a GNU C compiler and a non-GNU C++ compiler, it does **not** work if you have a non-GNU C compiler and a GNU C++ compiler. This is a bug, and is entirely my fault. 

Basically the testing for mixing of compilers happens in configure.ac something like this:


```
if test x$GCC = xyes
then
    # Check if C++ compiler is g++. If not, there is a problem.
    # as mixing GNU and non-GNU compilers is likely to cause problems.
    if test x$GXX != xyes
    then
       AC_MSG_WARN([You are trying to use gcc but not g++])
       AC_MSG_ERROR([The mixing of GNU and non-GNU compilers is not permitted])
    fi
```

There is no corresponding test if x$GXX (the C++ compiler) is GNU. (Yes, GXX is correct, its not a mistake/)

I will also need to fix #7156, which is a minor portability issue with prereq.
