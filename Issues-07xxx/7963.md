I do the following:

1. Start the notebook with `notebook()`

2. click the checkboxes next to a few worksheets

3. hit the "Download" button

and I get an error:

```
The resource /download_worksheets?filenames=admin/77___S_A_G_E___admin/76___S_A_G_E___admin/75___S_A_G_E___&sep=___S_A_G_E___ cannot be found.
```
