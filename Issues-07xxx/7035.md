Using

* Solaris 10 update 7 on SPARC
* sage-4.1.2.alpha2
* Sun Studio 12.1
* An updated configure script to allow the Sun compiler to be used #7021

CC was set to the Sun C compiler, and CXX to the Sun C++ compiler and SAGE_FORTRAN to the Sun Fortran 95 compiler. While R sends the correct flags (-KPIC) to make position independent code to the Sun C and C++ compilers, it does not do so with the Fortran compiler. Instead it used the GNU flag -fPIC. R is however picking up the correct Fortran compiler (f95 and not gfortran)
