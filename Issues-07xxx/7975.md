I just noticed that dsage is completely broken in sage-4.3 and sage-4.3.1.rc0, etc.:

```
sage: dsage.setup()
sage: D = dsage.start_all()
sage: a = D('2+3')
BOOM?
sage: a
BOOM!
```
The vote to remove was taken at [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8e36c5734cc5d8f4).

**Author:** William Stein
