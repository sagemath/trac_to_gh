#5597 or #5598 introduced a potential infinite loop (and segfault) upon coercion discovery on a cyclic graph. The first occurence of such a graph was with the newly refactored symmetric functions.

The attached patch fixes this. By the way, it uses a dictionary rather than a list to hold the marks used (register_pair) to detect cycles.

The category patches #5981 depend on this!!!

Yes, calling _register_pair would work here, even a helper is_registered function might be better than using _coerce_test_dict directly. 

Also, instead of 

```
                connection = None 
                if EltPair(mor._domain, S, "coerce") not in _coerce_test_dict: 
                    connecting = mor._domain.coerce_map_from(S)
                if connecting is not None: 
```

it might be clearer to do 

```
                if EltPair(mor._domain, S, "coerce") not in _coerce_test_dict: 
                    connecting = mor._domain.coerce_map_from(S)
                    if connecting is not None: 
                        ...

Replying to [@robertwb](#comment%3A3):
> Yes, calling _register_pair would work here

I gave it a shot, and this works almost fine: all sage tests pass; except that for jack polynomials. Looking at it, it appears that the coercion model is picking a path which is *really* far from the shortest (see the attached log). The previous version was doing reasonably. This sounds like a pure piece of luck though, since in both cases, the strategy seems to be depth first search + limited selection among the first conversions found.

Robert, Mike: from here, I see two options:
- Either you spot something stupid I did in the second version of the patch, and then we go for it after fixing it.
- Or we go for the first version of the patch for the moment (after applying Robert's suggestion for better indentation)

In both cases, after the category patches are in, we should definitely rewrite the coercion lookup to use a breath first search.
