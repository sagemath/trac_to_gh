I think these are implemented in 
http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/6452/trac_6452-ring-codes.patch
However, the patch was rejected due to memory errors. The author has not fixed them
yet.

Maybe this is related to the "piority queue" in Demaine's descrition
of the algorithm in

Attachment [trac_7673.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7673/trac_7673.2.patch) by @nathanncohen created at 2009-12-14 12:33:00

I do not think so, this bug just came from the fact that this version of dijkstra is bidirectional, and I wrongly assumed that as in the simple version of it, the first path found was the correct path. Obviously ( see your example ) it is not, and I expect this version of the algorithm to be correct :-)
