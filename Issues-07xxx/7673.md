I think these are implemented in

However, the patch was rejected due to memory errors. The author has not fixed them

Hi,
I'm sorry, but this implementation is buggy...

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_edge(0,1,9)
sage: G.add_edge(0,2,8)
sage: G.add_edge(1,2,7)
sage: G.shortest_path(0,1,by_weight=True)
[0, 1]
sage: G.shortest_path_length(0,1,by_weight=True)
9
sage: Gc = G.copy(implementation='c_graph')
sage: Gc.shortest_path(0,1,by_weight=True)
[0, 2, 1]
sage: Gc.shortest_path_length(0,1,by_weight=True)
15

Maybe this is related to the "piority queue" in Demaine's descrition
of the algorithm in
