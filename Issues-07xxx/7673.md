However, the patch was rejected due to memory errors. The author has not fixed them

I'm sorry, but this implementation is buggy...

```

I don't know if it's nicer, but did you look at how it's done in networkx?

Maybe this is related to the "piority queue" in Demaine's descrition
of the algorithm in

I do not think so, this bug just came from the fact that this version of dijkstra is bidirectional, and I wrongly assumed that as in the simple version of it, the first path found was the correct path. Obviously ( see your example ) it is not, and I expect this version of the algorithm to be correct :-)
