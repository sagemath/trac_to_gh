I'm sorry, but this implementation is buggy...

```

Clearly, it is !! Thank you for taking a lot at it :-)

Well, the only bugfix I can think about is to keep in memory the vertex v such that dist_y[v] + dist_x[v] is minimal, and only build the path when the neighborhoods of x and y at distance 2*(dist_y[v] + dist_x[v]) have been explored. It clearly fixes your counter-example, and I think it should solve all others, but I woud be glad to write a nicer solution... Any idea ? :-)

Thank you very much again ! :-)

I don't know if it's nicer, but did you look at how it's done in networkx?

Maybe this is related to the "piority queue" in Demaine's descrition
of the algorithm in
