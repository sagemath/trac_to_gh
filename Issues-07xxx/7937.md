The SASS source files from ticket #7269 are missing from [sagenb-0.5.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/sagenb/sagenb-0.5.spkg):

```sh
hg stat
! sass/config.rb
! sass/readme.txt
! sass/src/account_settings.sass
! sass/src/main.sass
! sass/src/master.sass
! sass/src/partials/_mixins.sass
! sass/src/registration.sass
! sass/src/test_report.sass
! sass/src/typography/_base.sass
! sass/src/user_management.sass
? release_notes.txt
? setup.cfg
```
I think we just need to patch the `MANIFEST.in`.
