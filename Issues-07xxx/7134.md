Using

* A Sun Blade 2000 running Solaris 10 update 7
* Sage 4.1.2.rc0
* gcc 4.4.1
* SAGE64 exported to "yes" 

We can see that *ntl* is building 32-bit libraries, despite the fact SAGE64 was set to "yes"

```
drkirkby@swan:[~/sage/gcc64-sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/lib] $ file *ntl*
libntl-5.4.2.so:        ELF 32-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARC32PLUS Version 1, V8+ Required, dynamically linked, not stripped
libntl.a:       current ar archive, not a dynamic executable or shared object
libntl.so:      ELF 32-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARC32PLUS Version 1, V8+ Required, dynamically linked, not stripped
drkirkby@swan:[~/sage/gcc64-sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/lib] $
```


Other packages building 32-bit libraries, even when SAGE64 is set to "yes" include, but are probably not limited to:

* zlib #7128
* libgpg_error #7129
* libpng #7130
* libcliquer #7131 
* pari #7133

mpir currently mixes 32 and 64-bit objects, so do not build at all #7132.

I will sort this package out after creating a new sage-env, which exports all the variables properly, including the flag for building 64-bit code, which is not always -m64.

Although there is no support for AIX or HP-UX in Sage yet, we could potentially add it - I personally own machines running AIX and HP-UX.

IBM's compiler on AIX uses -q64, and HP's on HP-UX uses +DD64.

The sensible way to resolve this is to add the correct flag on every platform.
