The theorem from Nash-Williams on the existence of k edge-disjoint spanning trees in a graph is both important, useful, and polynomial to compute. This could be implemented using the short proof described in the following article :

http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2809

Or, if we achieve to eventually define in Sage a class Matroid, this could be done through the Matroid Union Theorem as presented in Schrijver's book.

What would you think of still putting this into Sage ? It would take much more time to write the other algorithm, and nothing says that LP would not be faster anyway...
