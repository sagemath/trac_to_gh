The easiest way is

```
make doc
```
from $SAGE_ROOT, but that will build more than you need.

You could also do (from $SAGE_ROOT):

```
./sage --docbuild reference html
```

Note that the documentation will actually build, there aren only WARNINGs.  So you have to look for warnings in the on-screen output.
