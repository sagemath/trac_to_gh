The easiest way is

```
make doc
```
from $SAGE_ROOT, but that will build more than you need.

You could also do (from $SAGE_ROOT):

```
./sage --docbuild reference html
```

Note that the documentation will actually build, there aren only WARNINGs.  So you have to look for warnings in the on-screen output.

The problem is that the docstring of ` matrix_of_frobenius ` is a plain string, not a raw string (`r""" ... """)` and hence it interprets the ` \f ` in ` \frac ` as a form feed character! This completely mangles Sphinx's parsing of the Latex formulae, unsurprisingly.
