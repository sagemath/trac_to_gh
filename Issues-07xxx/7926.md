The easiest way is

```
make doc
```
from $SAGE_ROOT, but that will build more than you need.

You could also do (from $SAGE_ROOT):

```
./sage --docbuild reference html
```

Note that the documentation will actually build, there aren only WARNINGs.  So you have to look for warnings in the on-screen output.

You can also look in the output of the patchbot (click on the swirly round blob by the ticket title and go to "plugins.docbuild"). The patchbot builds the reference manual with jsmath, which means it misses the third error (because it doesn't attempt to process latex formulae at build time), but it spots the other two.
