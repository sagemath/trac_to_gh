This looks like a bug to me:

```
sage: list(SR('c+1').iterator())
[c, 1]
sage: list(SR('c').iterator())
[]
```

Apply trac_7537-iterator.patch

Depends on #9989

I don't think this is a bug. :)

It doesn't make sense to iterate over variables, constants or numeric coefficients. Iterators are only available over `add`, `mul`, and `pow` objects, which correspond to the obvious mathematical operations.

AFAICT, this is also the case in MMA:

```
Mathematica 7.0 for Linux x86 (32-bit)
Copyright 1988-2008 Wolfram Research, Inc.

In[1]:= T=x+1
Out[1]= 1 + x
In[2]:= T
Out[2]= 1 + x
In[3]:= T[[1]]
Out[3]= 1
In[4]:= X
Out[4]= X
In[5]:= X[[1]]
Part::partd: Part specification X[[1]] is longer than depth of object.
Out[5]= X[[1]]
```

We can raise a `ValueError` if the expression corresponds to a `symbol`, `constant` or `numeric` object. The docstring should also be enhanced to point to the data structure for symbolic expressions here:

Do you mean return an iterable which returns `self` when `.next()` is called? 

If you're traversing a symbolic expression, and working with iterators, I can't think of any case where symbols, constants and numeric coefficients don't form a special case which will be treated separately. The usual way to write code to traverse the expression tree should check if `.operator()` returns `None`.

I admit that I don't use this interface often enough to decide on the design though. The recent thread on sage-devel about indexing parts of expressions also shows that this needs work.

Do you have a use case we can work from? How did you run into this?

With [attachment: trac_7537-iterator.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7537/trac_7537-iterator.patch.gz) we get an error when trying to iterate over symbols, constants or numeric objects:

```
sage: x.iterator()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: cannot iterate over numeric, constant or symbol
sage: pi.iterator()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: cannot iterate over numeric, constant or symbol
sage: SR(5).iterator()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: cannot iterate over numeric, constant or symbol
```

This patch depends on #9989 (not in terms of functionality, but it will fail to apply since the patch there touches the same part of `sage/symbolic/expression.pyx`).
