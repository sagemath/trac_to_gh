The function `sage.rings.finite_rings.element_base.FiniteRingElement.multiplicative_order` should use
`sage.groups.generic.order_from_multiple` (see the example in #7324), and 
the factorization of the order of the multiplicative group of the field 
should be cached; see the documentation for `order_from_multiple`.
