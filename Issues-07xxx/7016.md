The operation x % n for p-adic numbers is confusing. Added a note about it in the documentation of the 'residue' function.

```
## Create a p-adic number in two ways
sage: e = 1 + O(2^20)  ## Explicit creation
sage: e
1 + O(2^20)
sage: c = Qp(2)(1)     ## By coercion
sage: c
1 + O(2^20)
sage: e == c
True

## Check their types
sage: type(e)
<type 'sage.rings.padics.padic_capped_relative_element.pAdicCappedRelativeElement'>
sage: type(c)
<type 'sage.rings.padics.padic_capped_relative_element.pAdicCappedRelativeElement'>

## Use the mod operation, with inconsistent results: (I expected the integer 1 in both cases)
sage: e % 8
1 + O(2^20)
sage: c % 8
0
sage: e % 8 == c % 8
False

## Check the mod types
sage: type(e % 8)
<type 'sage.rings.padics.padic_capped_relative_element.pAdicCappedRelativeElement'>
sage: type(c % 8)
<type 'sage.rings.padics.padic_capped_relative_element.pAdicCappedRelativeElement'>


## Check their lifts
sage: e.lift()
1
sage: c.lift()
1
sage: c.lift() == e.lift()
True
sage: c.lift() % 8 == e.lift() % 8
True


```



Suggestions:


1) x % M returns an integer when x is a p-adic number (in Qp) and M is
   an integer or raises an error if either the modulus is not a power
   of p or is larger than the known precision of the number allows.
   This syntax will return an error for any (non-trivial) extensions
   of Qp.

2) Add a more general syntax x.reduce_mod_prime() returns an element
   of FiniteField(q) whenever x is an element of an unramified
   extension Qq of Qp.

3) It might also be nice to have an x.reduce_mod_prime_power(n) which
   would return an element in the associated finite quotient ring
   Q_q/((pi)**n), but this may not be worth the effort right now.

This is a consequence of the fact that those two elements have different parents: 

```
sage: parent(1+O(2^20))
2-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20
sage: parent(Qp(2)(1))
2-adic Field with capped relative precision 20
```

Most rings in sage return an element of the same ring when applying the operation %.  The function you want is residue.

```
sage: a = Zp(2)(1); b = Qp(2)(1)
sage: a.residue(3), b.residue(3)
(1, 1)
sage: a.residue(3).parent(), b.residue(3).parent()
(Ring of integers modulo 8, Ring of integers modulo 8)
sage: c = Qp(2)(1/2)
sage: c.residue(3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

ValueError: Element must have non-negative valuation in order to compute residue.
```

There are some tricky questions for % and // and how they relate.  A similar issue bit William this past spring, so maybe we should have a design discussion about how to solve it.  I'm probably not going to be working on the p-adics this fall though: my advisor wants me to work on my thesis.  ;-)

That may be, but it's still a poor excuse for having "bizarre" results for `%`. If `%` makes no sense, better disallow it completely.

Actually there is already a detailled explanation of how the mod function works in its documentation, so the point of the note is mostly to direct people to the approriate documentation.
