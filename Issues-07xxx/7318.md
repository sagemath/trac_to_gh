In Sage, `sagenb.misc.sphinxify.sphinxify` does

```python
    shutil.rmtree(confdir, ignore_errors=True)
```
after running Sphinx, but this should happen only if `confdir` is a temporary directory.  Otherwise,

```sh
prompt$> cd $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/
prompt$> hg stat
! doc/en/introspect/__init__.py
! doc/en/introspect/conf.py
! doc/en/introspect/static/empty
! doc/en/introspect/templates/layout.html
```

I can confirm that before patching, doc/en/introspect is deleted, and afterwards it isn't.  The patch obviously does the right thing.
