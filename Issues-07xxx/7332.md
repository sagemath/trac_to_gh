Currently, some css id's and classes have illegal values ('admin/0', for example, in `worksheet_listing.html`). This prevents jQuery and Selenium from accessing those attributes.

This adds a filter to produce legal values from those values.

Version 3:

* Rebased against #7309, #7310.  For some reason, I got

```
applying trac_7332-css-escape.2.patch
patching file sagenb/notebook/template.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 15
Hunk #3 FAILED at 75
2 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sagenb/notebook/template.py.rej
patch failed, unable to continue (try -v)
patch failed, rejects left in working dir
```
   but the failures were inconsequential.

* Fixes the overall checkbox in `notebook_lib.js`.

To the extent it counts, my review is positive.

```
