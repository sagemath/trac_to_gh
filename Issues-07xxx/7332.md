Currently, some css id's and classes have illegal values ('admin/0', for example, in `worksheet_listing.html`). This prevents jQuery and Selenium from accessing those attributes.

This adds a filter to produce legal values from those values.

```
applying trac_7332-css-escape.2.patch
patching file sagenb/notebook/template.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 15
Hunk #3 FAILED at 75
2 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sagenb/notebook/template.py.rej
patch failed, unable to continue (try -v)
patch failed, rejects left in working dir
```
   but the failures were inconsequential.

* Fixes the overall checkbox in `notebook_lib.js`.

To the extent it counts, my review is positive.

On [this sage-devel thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9da7dd211fe5570b): I forgot to account for dots (`'.'`) in login names.  A quick fix: In `sagenb/data/sage/js/notebook_lib.js`'s `check_worksheet_filenames`, replace

```

```
        id = worksheet_filenames[i].replace(/[\/.]/g, '-');

I'll open a new ticket and add a patch, once I'm confident I haven't missed other special characters.
