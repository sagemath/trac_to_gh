sage: Q.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: complex(i)
0.99999999999999967j
```

It should give `1j` instead.

This is probably caused by the roots method using NumPy which uses Fortran which is a little off.  If you specify algorithm='pari' to the roots command when computing them, things should be fine.

```
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/dirichlet.py # 4 doctests failed

The design of embeddings was really bad before and relied on numerical errors to mess up the order of roots in case of 53 bit precision.  This was potentially *very* buggy and was I think the result of some absolutely terrible design decisions.    This absolutely must be fixed before releasing sage-4.3.  This patch basically fixes it, modulo some small remaining issue.

Here is an example from sage-4.2.1 that illustrates just how horrendously bad the previous design was (with using CDF when prec=53 but ComplexField(prec) otherwise):

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: i.complex_em
i.complex_embedding   i.complex_embeddings  
sage: i.complex_embedding()
1.0*I
sage: i.complex_embedding(100)
-1.0000000000000000000000000000*I

I think the errors in dirichlet.py comes from the following:

```
sage: a = mod(1,3)
sage: CDF.zeta(3)^a
-0.5 + 0.866025403784*I

Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber'> to an integer
```

It'd be nice if the {{{__pow__}} methods were standardized.

I've added a patch which fixes the errors in dirichlet.py by just forcing the exponent to be an int.

William's changes look good to me so the only thing that needs review is trac_7598-dirichlet.patch.

We should open another ticket for the `__pow__` discrepencies.

Do we need to apply both patches?  Or is it that Mike has given a positive review to the first and only needs a review of the second?  I was hoping to test this (being someone who experienced the problems) but as it will take a long time to rebuild, I want to make sure that the time is not wasted.

Applied all 3 patches to 4.3.rc0 on both 32-bit Suse (built using system gfortran) and 64-bit ubuntu (using Sage's gfortran).  No problems.  All tests in the files touched pass.  I still get a failure in doc/en/bordeaux_2008/nf_introduction.rst but that has a different cause.

So, positive review.
