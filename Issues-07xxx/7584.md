```
08:32 < schilly> mvngu: i found a spkg inside the pari spkg. was that me while 
                 scripting or is is this everywhere?
08:32 < mvngu> schilly: Let me check with Sage 4.3.alpha0
08:33 < schilly> ok
08:36 < mvngu> With Sage 4.2.1, it's the file pari-2.3.3.p5/pari-2.3.3.p5.spkg, 
               which a small file. The same goes for Sage 4.3.alpha0.
08:37 < mvngu> That file should be removed; it's not used anywhere as far as I 
               can tell.
08:37 < mvngu> I think it was introduced during the update to .p5
08:37 < mvngu> Unintentionally, of course.
