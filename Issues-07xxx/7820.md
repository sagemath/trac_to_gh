The new spkg is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ghitza/gfan-0.4plus.spkg


See
http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~jensen/software/gfan/gfan.html

Release 0.4plus has improved performance and a lot of new functionality.

This also takes care of the following issues: remove the debian dist directory (see #5903), clarify the license (see #3043), and separate the clean upstream from the patches needed to build in Sage (see #3338).

Assignee: tbd

Resolution: fixed

Some fixes are needed in the Sage library because of the upgrade.  I am attaching a patch that deals with the most obvious one, but there are some doctest failures left:

<a id='comment:8'></a>I'll do that today, by 1800 GMT today (7 hours from now). 

It was coincidental, but I'd just hit the problem on version 0.3 and posted something to sage-devel about this. William was willing to remove gfan, as he was no aware of anyone using it. You might want to put a comment on sage-devel about it.

I'm not sure what spkg file you're looking at.  I just rechecked the one I gave above and it has the original Makefile in src/ and a modified one in patches/.

Anyway, it's not important.  I'm looking at your spkg now.
