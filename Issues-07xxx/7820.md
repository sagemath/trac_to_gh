The new spkg is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ghitza/gfan-0.4plus.spkg


See
http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~jensen/software/gfan/gfan.html

Release 0.4plus has improved performance and a lot of new functionality.

This also takes care of the following issues: remove the debian dist directory (see #5903), clarify the license (see #3043), and separate the clean upstream from the patches needed to build in Sage (see #3338).

An updated spkg is up at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ghitza/gfan-0.4plus.spkg

Some fixes are needed in the Sage library because of the upgrade.  I am attaching a patch that deals with the most obvious one, but there are some doctest failures left:

It would be good if the Makefile could be changed so that the C compiler is set by CC and the C++ compiler by CXX, and the flags CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS used. 

The Sun compiler was not happy with the earlier version. 

I dont mind trying to sort the makefile out if you want.

I'll do that today, by 1800 GMT today (7 hours from now). 

It was coincidental, but I'd just hit the problem on version 0.3 and posted something to sage-devel about this. William was willing to remove gfan, as he was no aware of anyone using it. You might want to put a comment on sage-devel about it.

The 'src' directory at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ghitza/gfan-0.4plus.spkg

has no 'makefile' yet when I download the source code from 

http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~jensen/software/gfan/gfan0.4plus.tar.gz

there is a makefile. 

I think we should keep that, then overwrite it with a patch, so there is a record of the actual source code. i.e. something like 

cp patches/makefile src/makefile

That way, the original source is untouched. I rather start with the original code, and make changes to that, rather than someone elses makefile.

I'm not sure what spkg file you're looking at.  I just rechecked the one I gave above and it has the original Makefile in src/ and a modified one in patches/.

Anyway, it's not important.  I'm looking at your spkg now.
