The new spkg is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ghitza/gfan-0.4plus.spkg


See
http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~jensen/software/gfan/gfan.html

Release 0.4plus has improved performance and a lot of new functionality.

This also takes care of the following issues: remove the debian dist directory (see #5903), clarify the license (see #3043), and separate the clean upstream from the patches needed to build in Sage (see #3338).

An updated spkg is up at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ghitza/gfan-0.4plus.spkg

Some fixes are needed in the Sage library because of the upgrade.  I am attaching a patch that deals with the most obvious one, but there are some doctest failures left:

It would be good if the Makefile could be changed so that the C compiler is set by CC and the C++ compiler by CXX, and the flags CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS used. 

The Sun compiler was not happy with the earlier version. 

I dont mind trying to sort the makefile out if you want.

I'm not sure what spkg file you're looking at.  I just rechecked the one I gave above and it has the original Makefile in src/ and a modified one in patches/.

Anyway, it's not important.  I'm looking at your spkg now.

I've tested this and I think it looks good.  There are some minor conflicts with 7109 but I am willing to rebase 7109 against this if it is merged first.

I might not have time until this summer to extend the gfan interface but I am interested in doing so.  If anyone beats me to it I am happy to review.
