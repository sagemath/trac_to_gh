```
sage: float(e).hex()
'0x1.5bf0a8b145769p+1'
sage: RR(e).hex()
------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<ipython console>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber' object has no attribute 'hex'
```

There should probably be a `__hex__` method as well, so hex(2.3) works.

Does the C string need to be freed in the error case as well? In that case you could use a finally clause (and just "return s")

Could you add a test showing that hex(RR(x)) works too?
