sage: float(e).hex()
'0x1.5bf0a8b145769p+1'
sage: RR(e).hex()
------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<ipython console>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber' object has no attribute 'hex'
```

There should probably be a __hex__ method as well, so hex(2.3) works.
