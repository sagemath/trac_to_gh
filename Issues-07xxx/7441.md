Let me add another +1 to this. It would make it much easier when teaching -- I write up a worksheet for an assignment, publish it, and then tell the students the URL. They log into their accounts, hit upload, paste in the URL, and they have the worksheet. As it stands, either I or my students needs to manually save the worksheet file somewhere and do something with it.

As a quick and dirty hack, I see that published worksheets have something like this in their html source:

<li><a href="download/blargle floomp.sws">Download.</a></li>

...so maybe, when given a url that does not end in .sws, the upload mechanism could just suck in the html source, look for the first hyperlink tag that resembles the above, and use that URL? I'm thinking a regex of `<a href="download/.*\.sws">` or similar.

Some kind of magic incantation in the html would also allow people to use random web pages as upload sources; imagine taking the URL of a blog post and putting into the upload box, and it automagically finds a .sws file to download. This could be the html version of the "embed a .sws file into a pdf" idea that has been discussed before.

I think we can implement the "magic incantation" with something very simple, just like RSS autodiscovery. In the `<head>` of any HTML document that wishes to advertise a link to a related Sage worksheet, just put:

```
<link rel="alternate" type="application/sage" title="the title of the worksheet"
      href="http://url.to.worksheet.sws">
```
The "application/sage" mimics what the notebook server gives when downloading a worksheet from the "Download" link on a published worksheet. I don't know if that's a proper MIME type.

More info: http://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery and http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp. The rel="alternate" specifies that the link is to an alternate version of the content, which is exactly what we want.

We just need to put that link into published worksheets, and then get the "upload worksheet from URL" stuff to look for that link.

RSS autodiscovery is well-established and works very well, so using the same mechanism for our own purposes seems like a good idea, and is very easy for anyone to use on any web page.

These two patches are a mostly-working implementation of these ideas. The "link_rel" patch simply adds the appropriate link into the head of published worksheets; the "upload" patch adds support to the "upload a worksheet" stuff so that it parses and downloads associated worksheets.

Right now, however, it runs into a strange error that I don't understand. Try applying these patches, publishing a worksheet, and then using the worksheet's public URL in the upload box. You'll get a strange twisted error, the user's session will get messed up, but if you log back in, you'll see that the worksheet did get imported.

(It's likely that it won't work at all with https URLs; we'll work on that later.)

Any ideas?
