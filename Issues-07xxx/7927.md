<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

Here's a first attempt at some more code, with a little bit of overlap with Robert's code. I like his incorporation of the non-Teichmuller algorithm as an optional parameter in the main Coleman integral function, so we can mostly ignore what I do instead.

The main functions of interest are 
coleman_integral_from_weierstrass_via_boundary and
coleman_integral_from_weierstrass ; the latter can only be used for odd differentials, while the former is pretty slow, dependent on p-adic extensions. 

The auxiliary functions (e.g., P_to_S, S_to_Q, etc.) aren't likely to be of much interest to the user, but they give us good consistency checks. I'd appreciate input on renaming/restructuring things.

And my apologies for the messed-up line breaks in hyperelliptic_generic -- just noticed them now, but boxen.math (where I've been editing) has been difficult to access in the last hour from Guam. I can fix this (my) tomorrow morning.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

The overlap needs to be taken care of somehow. It might be easiest for Jen to incorporate whatever is appropriate from Robert's patch.

I'm dubious about the treatment of points in the infinite disc, on several counts. One is whether the Frobenius gets the y-coordinate right, since I think in both patches the check passes for trivial reasons whether or not the y-coordinate is right. Under Robert's patch, one gets lucky: you win as long as the square root of a p-adic number with unit part congruent to 1 mod p is guaranteed to be congruent to 1 mod p. This is undocumented but appears to be true. Under Jen's patch, one does not get lucky:

```
sage: K = pAdicField(11, 5)
sage: x = polygen(K)
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(x^5 + 33/16*x^4 + 3/4*x^3 + 3/8*x^2 - 1/4*x + 1/16)
sage: P = C.lift_x(11^(-2))
sage: C.frobenius(P)
(11^-22 + O(11^-17) : 10*11^-55 + 10*11^-54 + 10*11^-53 + 10*11^-52 + 10*11^-51 + O(11^-50) : 1 + O(11^5))
```

More seriously, computing Coleman integrals even between two points in the infinite disc seems to be broken. Under Robert's patch, we have:

```
sage: K = pAdicField(11, 5)
sage: x = polygen(K)
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(x^5 + 33/16*x^4 + 3/4*x^3 + 3/8*x^2 - 1/4*x + 1/16)
sage: P = C.lift_x(11^(-2))
sage: Q = C.lift_x(3*11^(-2))
sage: C.tiny_integrals_on_basis(P,Q)
[9*11^3 + 11^4 + 2*11^5 + 2*11^6 + 11^7 + O(11^8), 11^2 + 5*11^4 + 3*11^5 + O(11^6), 8*11^-1 + 5 + 5*11 + 5*11^2 + 6*11^3 + O(11^4), 10*11^-3 + 3*11^-2 + 7*11^-1 + 5 + 8*11 + O(11^2)]
sage: C.coleman_integrals_on_basis(P, Q)
(10*11^-102 + 2*11^-101 + 9*11^-100 + 3*11^-99 + O(11^-98), 8*11^-102 + 2*11^-101 + 2*11^-100 + O(11^-98), 10*11^-103 + 8*11^-102 + 3*11^-101 + 6*11^-100 + 7*11^-99 + O(11^-98), 2*11^-103 + 5*11^-102 + 8*11^-100 + 5*11^-99 + O(11^-98))
```
The last two lines should be the same; right now, they aren't even of the same return type (one is a list, one is a tuple).

Under Jen's patch, the last call returns an error instead:

```

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

The good news is, this looks fine on mathematical grounds. However, there are a few procedural issues before I can issue a positive review.

I am getting some doctest failures in hyperelliptic_padic_field.py. I think the problem is the indentation in the doctest for is_same_disc. If I fix that by hand, the doctests all pass.

In other news, coverage checking points up some missing documentation/doctests.
For hyperelliptic_padic_field.py:

```
Missing documentation:
	 * invariant_differential(self):

Missing doctests:
	 * is_in_weierstrass_disc(self,P):
	 * is_weierstrass(self,P):
	 * tiny_integrals(self, F, P, Q):
```
For hyperelliptic_generic.py:

```
Missing documentation:
	 * __init__(self, PP, f, h=None, names=None, genus=None):
	 * change_ring(self, R):
	 * __cmp__(self, other):
	 * lift_x(self, x, all=False):
	 * genus(self):
	 * jacobian(self):
	 * monsky_washnitzer_gens(self):

Missing doctests:
	 * local_coord(self, P, prec = 20, name = 't'):

Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
	 * _repr_(self):
	 * _magma_init_(self, magma):
```
Of these, the ones that are new (is_in_weierstrass_disc, is_weierstrass, and maybe some others) absolutely need doctests. Improving the coverage for older functions would be helpful but is not an obstacle to a positive review on this ticket (we could create a separate ticket for that).

Another minor note: various release managers have requested that the commit line for patches start with the number of the relevant ticket, e.g.,

#7927: Extend coleman integration to handle Weierstrass points

This is helpful in case a rollback is needed after applying a whole bunch of disparate patches. This comment can be ignored unless you decide to build a single patch encompassing all of the changes so far.

What's up with this condition:

```
            x = f.parent().variable_name()
            if x!='a' :  #this is to distinguish between extensions of Qp that are finite vs. not
```
I totally cannot understand why you check whether the variable name is `"a"`. That makes no sense to me.
