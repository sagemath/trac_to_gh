I've been editing the root makefile while working on a couple tickets, and I have a deep urge to refactor repetitive, boilerplate code. In SAGE_ROOT/makefile, there are many sequences of commands that are repeated in multiple targets.

The attached patch puts the repetitive bits into variables that can easily be customized later by editing only one thing in the makefile, instead of multiple things.

I'd also like to consider removing the "install" and "gmp" targets in the makefile. I suspect no one ever uses them.
