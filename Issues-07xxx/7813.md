To disable the dead links, for instance, at

1. http://sagemath.org/doc/genindex.html
2. http://sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/modindex.html
3. http://sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/genindex.html
 ...

The ticket is based on the decision to improve Sage's docs at [http://www.mail-archive.com/sage-devel@googlegroups.com/msg33505.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/sage-devel@googlegroups.com/msg33505.html).


The next step is to show Sage developers how to add words to index similarly as Python -project does by the given syntax such as


```
   .. index:: pair: file; byte-code
```


I propose to add a notice about that to Sage's developer manual and to change the command {{{ sage -coverage }} to reflect the need of the index. The manual should also show by examples which words are suitable to the index. 

I would like to have function names in the index given for instance by

 

```
 sage -grep "def [a-zA-Z]*("
```
 



In other words, it would be great to have a notice like `Please, consider new keywords to index by adding ".. index:: keyword;"` above the keyword.
