See [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/603348c82c817a21) for some recent details, and [this thread](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/6b1d3d0f06db9c6a) for older discussion; both threads have links to explanations of algorithms.

The problem is that we only use contour plotting, and no adaptive changes, for implicit plotting, which means that a nice plot takes a huge number of plot points, but a realistic one doesn't look so nice, especially if there are weird turnarounds. 

Keywords: **plot, implicit, contour**
