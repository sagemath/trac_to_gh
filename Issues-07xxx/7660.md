Equations and relations should behave like this:
equations:
* `(a==b) +-*/ c` same as:
  - `(a==b).add_to_both_sides(c)`
  - `(a==b).subtract_from_both_sides(c)`
  - `(a==b).multiply_both_sides(c)`
  - `(a==b).divide_both_sides(c)`
  - `False` if `*/0`
* `(a==b)^c` --> `a^c == b^c`
* `f(a==b)` --> `f(a)==f(b)`
relations:
* `(a<b) +- c` same as:
  - `(a<b).add_to_both_sides(c)`
  - `(a<b).subtract_from_both_sides(c)`
* `(a<b) */ c` same as:
  - `a*/c > b*/c` for `c` real and negative, or if `c` is assumed negative
  - `a*/c < b*/c` for `c` real and positive, or if `c` is assumed positive
  - `False` if `c=0` or assumed zero
  - if `c` contains variables (and no assumptions exist about it) raise `ArithmeticError: missing assumption: is ...>0?`
  - if `c` contains no variables `ArithmeticError: multiplication of inequality with irreal`
* `(a<b)^c` --> `(a<b)^c`
* `f(a<b)`  --> `f(a<b)`

From the following sage-devel thread:

Arithmetic with inequalities can be confusing, since Sage does nothing to keep the inequality ``correct``. For example: 


```

     > -x - 3 < -y + 2 
     }}} 
      
     It seems MMA doesn't apply any automatic simplification in this case:

     Maple acts more intuitively, though the way ``formal products`` are printed leaves something to be desired, IMHO:

     We should multiply both sides of the inequality only if the argument is a real number (as opposed to a symbol with real domain), and invert the relation when the argument is negative. 
      
     Note that GiNaC leaves everything formal, like MMA, by default:

Well, we could go to the !Ginac/Mathematica way too, instead of the Maple way.  But now that #11309 is on the way in, probably it's time to deal with this.  FWIW, Maxima seems to go that way as well.

```
(%i1) x<y;

(%i2) a:x<y;

(%i4) -1*a;

(%i5) b*a;

Maybe Burcin has a comment; I don't have that strong of feelings, though I'm partial to 
* `(x<y)+3 == x+3<y+3`
* `0*(x<y) is False`
but those may just be sentimental, as you suggest.

Honestly I thought the most likely response would be `0*(x<y) == 0`. `False` is an even stranger result because now you have `(x<y) == (1+0)*(x<y) == (x<y) + False`, so either `False` is now another additive identity (on relations, anyway), thus breaking the universality of `? - ? = 0`, or `False == 0`, which is another can of worms...

And if `(x<y)+3 == (x+3<y+3)`, then presumably `3 == (3<3) == False`...?

None of this makes any sense, IMHO. I think it would be best to go the Mathematica/GiNaC/Maxima way, as shown in your Maxima output, rather than the Maple way.

I gather that's similar to what Maple does.

Here are the statements sent via `maxima_eval("#$%s$"%statement)`:

Before:

```
sage: solve(-(x > 1),x)
sage0 : (x)*(-1) > -1
sage1 : solve_rat_ineq(sage0)
_tmp_ : sage1
kill(sage1)
kill(sage0)
[[x < 1]]
```
After:

```
sage: solve(-(x > 1),x)
sage12 : (x > 1)*(-1) = 0
sage13 : x
sage14 : solve(sage12,sage13)
kill(sage13)
kill(sage14)
_tmp_ : [x>1=0]          <---------?
kill(sage12)
```
Apparently, Sage's last statement sent is the result itself (no idea why), and maxima then barfs because it can't digest its own output. In maxima:

```
(%i11) solve((x > 1)*(-1) = 0,x);
(%o11)                            [x > 1 = 0]
(%i12) [x>1=0];
incorrect syntax: Found logical expression where algebraic expression expected
[x>1=
   ^
```
In summary there are three problems:
* 46 doctests fail in symbolic alone
* maxima can't handle the formal expressions generated via this patch, and `solve()` will fail because it uses maxima solve() and not solve_rat_ineq() (probably because the expression looks like an algebraic). However:

```
sage: solve_ineq((x>1)*(-1),[x,y])
#0: solve_rat_ineq(ineq=-(x > 1))
...
TypeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: solve_rat_ineq:  -(x > 1)  is not an inequality.
```
So maxima refuses to handle the formal expression generated by this patch, and this means they cannot be solved, regardless of method called. So, in addition, `solve()` should be changed to do simplification of these expressions before handing them on. This special simplification avoids all issues raised in[comment:10](#comment%3A10). It can be implemented after this ticket (#15906).
* `calculus.py:symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string()` should catch maxima `RuntimeError`s from `ecl.c` and rethrow them with meaningful information. (#15902)

<a id='comment:31'></a>
Let's start this fresh. To summarize, what's wanted is the following:

equations:
* `(a==b) +-*/ c` same as:
  - `(a==b).add_to_both_sides(c)`
  - `(a==b).subtract_from_both_sides(c)`
  - `(a==b).multiply_both_sides(c)`
  - `(a==b).divide_both_sides(c)`
  - `False` if `*/0`
* `(a==b)^c` --> `a^c == b^c`
* `f(a==b)` --> `f(a==b)`
relations:
* `(a<b) +- c` same as:
  - `(a<b).add_to_both_sides(c)`
  - `(a<b).subtract_from_both_sides(c)`
* `(a<b) */ c` same as:
  - `a*/c > b*/c` for `c` real and negative, or if `c` is assumed negative
  - `a*/c < b*/c` for `c` real and positive, or if `c` is assumed positive
  - `False` if `c=0`
* `(a<b)^c` --> `(a<b)^c`
* `f(a<b)`  --> `f(a<b)`

Question: Real or: if coerced to the reals successfully?
A followup extension would be like Maxima's ineq package, i.e., ask before doing a sign switch.
