Obviously. Florent recently complained about a patch of mine that wasn't based on vanilla and so (just) the line numbers changed s.t. Mercurial operated more verbosely than usual. ;-)

In general it's better to also touch the diffs, or keep them in full sync with the patched files; I've come across spkgs where apparently obsolete files were copied over; and it's confusing when there are dead old patches that do not reflect the current differences.
