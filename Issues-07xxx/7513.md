The current version is **1.6.4**, the version shipped with Sage 4.6 is **1.3.1**.

Cool new functionality: `hg qpush --move` allows to push a patch out of order, i.e. it can be used to reorder patches.

I originally wanted to give it immediately a positive review, though `patches/posix.py.patch` (which is redundant and for reference only) had not been updated, but just the line numbers changed. (I haven't updated it either.)

Jeroen's changes look fine, except `spkg-install` still tried to copy an obsolete, now removed patch (to `setup.py`).

Then I took a closer look at the rest (including `SPKG.txt`), which ended up in my reviewer patch.

Jeroen, if you agree with my changes, please merge them into the spkg, and I can give it positive review. ;-)

Obviously. Florent recently complained about a patch of mine that wasn't based on vanilla and so (just) the line numbers changed s.t. Mercurial operated more verbosely than usual. ;-)

In general it's better to also touch the diffs, or keep them in full sync with the patched files; I've come across spkgs where apparently obsolete files were copied over; and it's confusing when there are dead old patches that do not reflect the current differences.
 
> Thanks for looking more carefully at this, I just wanted a new spkg quickly :-)

Well, the ticket's first (opening) anniversary is close...

Yes, I forgot to suggest you removing the code commented out.

Reviewed reviewer's patch looks ok.

I wasn't sure if quoting the '`$`' was intended or not, but assumed the latter. Giving the effective filename would IMHO be ok, too.

Going to check the new spkg...

You are totally right, I forgot to update the `src/` directory when making the new spkg.  I automated this for the PARI spkg and forgot that not every spkg does this automatically :-)
