The current version is **1.6.4**, the version shipped with Sage 4.6 is **1.3.1**.

Cool new functionality: `hg qpush --move` allows to push a patch out of order, i.e. it can be used to reorder patches.

Then I took a closer look at the rest (including `SPKG.txt`), which ended up in my reviewer patch.

Obviously. Florent recently complained about a patch of mine that wasn't based on vanilla and so (just) the line numbers changed s.t. Mercurial operated more verbosely than usual. ;-)

In general it's better to also touch the diffs, or keep them in full sync with the patched files; I've come across spkgs where apparently obsolete files were copied over; and it's confusing when there are dead old patches that do not reflect the current differences.

Well, the ticket's first (opening) anniversary is close...
