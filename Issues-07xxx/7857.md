I've made a three more changes to the previous patch:

- In two places I wrongfully used ``/`` instead of ``//``.
- In another place I had ``base_ring`` instead of ``ring``.

This should be working now.  I've successfully run the doctests in the folder ``sage/rings``, and am currently running a complete test, too.

First comment:  Note that the "second patch" replaces the first one!

I noticed a bare "except:"  which is bad style -- it should list the errors expected explicitly.

Question:  the code for sub is (of course) almost identical to that for add.  Would it not be better to implement sub by adding the inverse?  I would have thought that the overhead would be trivial, and itmakes the code easier to maintain.

The (second) patch applies fine to 4.3 and all tests in sage/rings and sage/schemes/elliptic_curves pass.  (I tested the latter since I seemed to remember some fraction field arithmetic somewhere in there).  I also checked the docs still build ok.

I'll tag this as "needs work" but it's very minor to fix the exception trapping and (perhaps) replace the subtraction code.

Dear John,

Thank you for looking at the patch this quickly.

About your first point, I agree.  I followed the previous code of the method "reduce" in this part, which is why I am not completely sure I'll be able to find out exactly which exceptions might be raised.  But I will look into this.

I think you are also right with your second point.  Of course, when I wrote the code I simply copied the method and replaced the appropriate signs to avoid the unnecessary overhead, but in this context this is probably a bad habit, since the maintainability of the code should take priority over a simple sign swap plus an extra function call.  By the way, the same applies to multiplication and division, too.

I'll aim to complete this tonight or tomorrow.

Kind regards,

Sebastian

At the moment, the following tests still fail:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-ff/sage/combinat/sf/hall_littlewood.py
sage -t  devel/sage-ff/sage/combinat/sf/macdonald.py
sage -t  devel/sage-ff/sage/combinat/sf/sf.py

sage -t  devel/sage-ff/sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_element.pyx
sage -t  devel/sage-ff/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx
```

After taking a first look, it seems that some of these are just positive docstring changes (e.g. a previous ``(-1)/(-1)`` which is now correctly displayed as a ``1``), others are negative changes (e.g. a previous ``1`` now displayed as ``(1/3)/(1/3)``).

Firstly, I wanted to say that the most recent patch file now passes all doctests on my machine.

It is definitely true that a lot of errors are silenced.  But this is done in essentially the same way as before, where, whenever ``reduce`` was called from ``__init__``, the three kinds of errors (``AttributeError``, ``NotImplementedError``, and ``TypeError``) were converted to an ``ArithmeticError``, which was then silenced in ``__init__``.  That is, the user would only actually see the errors if he called ``reduce`` directly.

Of course, I am not entirely sure about this, but I think the behaviour might have been intended.

I've made three further improvements:

- I've now incorporated Robert's suggestion to catch ``NotImplementedError``s, too.  
- I've improved the method for computing the derivative further, noting that the second GCD computation was unnecessary since at that point in the computation the result was in lowest terms already.
- I've added some test cases to the method ``_derivative``.

This looks pretty good, and I am checking it now (as it touches so many places I am doing a full test on both 32 and 64 bit machines).

Two small points:
1. If you have several "except" clauses each with the same action, you can combine them thus:

```
    except (AttributeError, NotImplementedError, TypeError):
```
2. It's a bit perverse to call the num and den of "self" rnum and rden whle calling those of "right" snum and sden.   However, swapping the over without introducing any bugs would not be trivial!

I will report back when the full tests have finished.
