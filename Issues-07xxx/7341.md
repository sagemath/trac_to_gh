Try this in the notebook:

```
K.<a> = QuadraticField(-7)
b = K.pari_bnf()
b.bnf<tab>
```

Then compare to the command line.  For some reason the last thing, "b.bnfunit" is missing in the notebook.

Bug confirmed, and patch works. I've also added a new test in #7343 to confirm that the patch does the fix. Perhaps we should require any patch to SageNB to add a Selenium test?
