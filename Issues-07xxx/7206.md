  The following tests failed:

          sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py" 
```

This seems like #5884 again. I ran a bisect and it blames #6647.

Hy Dan,

With 4.1.1 and sage-combinat queue applied (the patch come from here : #6647), I have

```
nicolas@nicolas-laptop:/opt/sage/devel/sage-combinat$ sage -t sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage-combinat/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py"
	 [5.4 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 5.4 seconds
```

But, if I play with the method .random_element()

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3),(4,5)],[(1,2)]])
sage: G.random_element()
()
sage: G.random_element()
(4,5)
sage: G.random_element()
(1,3,2)(4,5)
sage: G.random_element()
(1,3,2)
sage: G.random_element()
(2,3)(4,5)
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3),(4,5)],[(1,2)]])
sage: G.random_element()                             
(4,5)
sage: G.random_element()
(1,3,2)
sage: G.random_element()
(1,3,2)
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3),(4,5)],[(1,2)]])
sage: G.random_element()                             
(2,3)(4,5)
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3),(4,5)],[(1,2)]])
sage: G.random_element()                             
(1,3,2)
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3),(4,5)],[(1,2)]])
sage: G.random_element()                             
(1,3)
```

I saw your pointer from my patch about strong generating system. I didn't touch random_element(). I would be very happy to help and investigate this but my guess is that touch interface and Gap behavior... I don't know even if it is possible to put a doctest on such random method where the random part is inside Gap and not inside Sage...

I don't really know that is very important in this doctest, a possible trick is

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3),(4,5)],[(1,2)]])
sage: G.random_element() in G                        
True
```
Here, one's can be sure there no timestamps random dependencies of Gap or other things I should not say because I really don't know anything about random and Gap.

If anyone know something about that ?
