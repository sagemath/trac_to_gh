From http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/1f3d4eca8bbff6c2/d3108ab8f2060050

Ronald van Luijk encountered the following problem:

```
sage: S.<p,q> = QQ[]
sage: A1.<r> = AffineSpace(QQ,1)
sage: A1_emb = Curve(p-2)
sage: type(A1_emb)
<class 'sage.schemes.plane_curves.affine_curve.AffineCurve_generic'>
sage: g = A1.hom([2,r],A1_emb)
TypeError: _point_morphism_class() takes exactly 1 non-keyword argument (3 given)
```

This is fixed in current Sage (e.g. 5.0.prealpha1). A doctest is added by

* [attachment:sage-trac_7956.patch]

Here's a description of the other patch, which fixes an apparent oversight in the class hierarchy.

We browsed through the schemes module a bit, and the functionality for a morphism to an affine curve does seem to exist through functions such as `AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_affine._point_morphism_class()`, but
is not accessible since `AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_affine` is not a superclass of `AffineCurve_generic`. Comparing it to the projective case, `AlgebraicScheme_subscheme_projective` _is_ a superclass of `ProjectiveCurve_generic`.

Is this a simple oversight in the class hierarchy for `AffineCurve_generic`, or is there a more fundamental reason why this does not yet work?


wjp made a patch (for sage 4.2) that makes the class hierarchy for affine curves similar to that of projective curves, but would appreciate if someone familiar with the schemes module could take a look since it is a rather invasive change:

http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~wpalenst/sage/affine_morphism.patch

The patch also changes the constructor of `SchemeMorphism_on_points_affine_space` to expect a number of polynomials equal to the dimension of the ambient space instead of the dimension of the curve/subscheme, analogous to a change to
`SchemeMorphism_on_points_projective_space` by David Kohel from 2007.
