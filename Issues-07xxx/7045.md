The current libgcrypt in Sage will not build with Sun Studio. I managed to mess up an update #6758, but Minh's correction ignores my fixes to the C source code, so that will not build on Sun Studio. 

Here is an spkg with the latest upstream version. 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/libgcrypt-1.4.4/

It's been tested on

* Sun Studio 12.1 on my own SPARC running Solaris 10 update 7 in 32-bit mode
* sage.math (64-bit)
* bsd.math in 32-bit mode only
