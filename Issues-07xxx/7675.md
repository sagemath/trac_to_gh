Welcome to Sagemath

> I wanted to work on this ticket. I have made the changes in c_graph.pyx and generic_graph.py . I had an issue that changes I have made in generic_graph.py do not appear in the git status output. 

I'm not a git guru, so others may have better ideas of what's going on
* Have you created a new branch first?
* Do you see your changes with `git diff` ?
* To commit your changes, I recommend to write `git commit -m "trac #7675: short and relevant description of this commit" -a`
* then push your branch for instance in `u/jlokesh/7675`
* the page http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/manual_git.html is very useful

Also, to test your changes, you can do (other methods might also be good/better)
* `./sage -btp src/sage/graphs/` or `./sage -btp src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` to both compile the code and check if it passes all tests
* `./sage -docbuild reference/graphs html` to rebuild the documentation of the graph module only. Be aware that from time to time you will be forced to rebuild the doc from scratch with `make doc-clean && make`


> Further the shortest_paths function in generic_graph.py uses functions from boost_graph.pyx .

The changes you do should be consistent for all algorithms.

I have added the distance_flag parameter to the shortest_path function of generic_graph.py and all the functions which are called from this function. I couldn't add it to boost_graph.pyx function as it returns both distance and path dictionaries in a list. Any changes to these functions lead to failure of doctests as they are used by other functions.
If distance_flag is True and u,v are not connected then the shortest_path function returns None or an exception based on the algorithm used. Networkx returns an exception. Should I also raise an exception for such a case?

Hello,

You have apparently not seen that we have methods like `shortest_path_length` and `shortest_path_lengths` to get the shortest path length from `u` to `v` and from `u` to all reachable vertices. So you should not add `distance_flag` to `shortest_path` in `generic_graph`.

The original motivation for this ticket is to get a faster method for computing shortest path length(s) with `c_graph`, avoiding to first compute and return the shortest path and then compute its length as is currently done in `shortest_path_length` and `shortest_path_lengths` (except for boost methods).

This said, in `c_graph.pyx`:
* in method `shortest_path`, you don't need to add a `else`. Indeed, if `distance_flag==True`, then you return the distance. Otherwise you continue. So don't change the indentation of subsequent lines.
* I don't understand why you condition the operation `pred_current, pred_other = pred_other, pred_current` to the value of `distance_flag`. This is only a exchange of pointers, no?
* Same remarks for `bidirectional_dijkstra`
* Concerning method `shortest_path_all_vertices`, you should use the variable `d` (but move it's +1 earlier in the loop) to write `distances_int[self.vertex_label(v_int)] = d`

In `generic_graph.py`:
* don't modify methods `shortest_path` and `shortest_paths`
* do the appropriate changes in methods `shortest_path_length` and `shortest_path_lengths`

Finally, please use a shorter name for the branch like `u/jlokesh/7675` and adopt the good practice of `git commit -m "trac #7675: short but relevant description of this commit" -a`. You can also make multiple commits.

I just wanted to point out that there are cases where a one-line commit message is not appropriate, and you would add a multi-line explanation there (without using `-m` flag, 
but letting git pop-up an editor to write the commit message in).

Another handy thing is `git commit --amend` to change the last commit (can be only the message, or also actual changes).

I'm not sure to understand what you have changed or not.

For sure, you should not modify the `shortest_path` method in `generic_graph`, but change the `shortest_path_length` method.

Sorry to post a little late with comments, but there are a few small things I think need to be addressed.

I don't see the need or desire to have a separate dict `distances_int` in `shortest_path_all_vertices`. Just add an extra `if` statement when initializing `distances[v]`. IMO it is cleaner code and doesn't require allocating an unnecessary object.

This is both the wrong type of error (for the message) and the wrong statement:

```
            raise ValueError("Algorithm " + algorithm + " not yet " +
                             "implemented. Please, contribute!")
```
For example, `algorithm='foobar'` says we should implement a fictitious algorithm. A `ValueError` is the correct error message, but it should say something like `'unknown algorithm "{}"'.format(algorithm)`. (Edit: Yes, no capital letter. Bad splicing of my post.)

Minor point, but for easier readability (PEP8), use `a == b` instead of `a==b` and similarly:

```
def shortest_path_all_vertices(self, v, cutoff=None, distance_flag=False):
```

In `shortest_paths`, please change

Looking at the code, I realize that we have the following problem:

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: 2 in G
False
sage: G.shortest_path(2,2)
[2]
sage: G.shortest_path_length(2,2)
0
```
I don't know why it has not been reported before.

Can you add necessary tests to check that u and v are in the graph and raise an error if it is not the case.

Thanks.

In the diff, I see the following modifications that must be cancelled.

```
-.. csv-table::
+ v\sv-table::
```

```
-    :meth:`~GenericGraph.add_vertex` | Create an isolated vertex.
+*-* :meth:`~GenericGraph.add_vertex` | Create an isolated vertex.
```

In case, you can "quickly" rebuild the html documentation of the graph module using `./sage -docbuild reference/graphs html`.


Concerning the tests, I would prefer something like that (and 

```
if not self.has_vertex(u):
    raise ValueError("vertex '{}' is not in the (di)graph".format(u))
if not self.has_vertex(v):
    raise ValueError("vertex '{}' is not in the (di)graph".format(v))
```
