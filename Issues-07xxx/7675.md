This modification would avoid the building of the shortest path, which is interesting for a function so often used !

Welcome to Sagemath

I'm not a git guru, so others may have better ideas of what's going on
* Have you created a new branch first?
* Do you see your changes with `git diff` ?
* To commit your changes, I recommend to write `git commit -m "trac #7675: short and relevant description of this commit" -a`
* then push your branch for instance in `u/jlokesh/7675`
* the page http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/manual_git.html is very useful

Also, to test your changes, you can do (other methods might also be good/better)
* `./sage -btp src/sage/graphs/` or `./sage -btp src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` to both compile the code and check if it passes all tests

Hello,

You have apparently not seen that we have methods like `shortest_path_length` and `shortest_path_lengths` to get the shortest path length from `u` to `v` and from `u` to all reachable vertices. So you should not add `distance_flag` to `shortest_path` in `generic_graph`.

The original motivation for this ticket is to get a faster method for computing shortest path length(s) with `c_graph`, avoiding to first compute and return the shortest path and then compute its length as is currently done in `shortest_path_length` and `shortest_path_lengths` (except for boost methods).

This said, in `c_graph.pyx`:
* in method `shortest_path`, you don't need to add a `else`. Indeed, if `distance_flag==True`, then you return the distance. Otherwise you continue. So don't change the indentation of subsequent lines.
* I don't understand why you condition the operation `pred_current, pred_other = pred_other, pred_current` to the value of `distance_flag`. This is only a exchange of pointers, no?
* Same remarks for `bidirectional_dijkstra`
* Concerning method `shortest_path_all_vertices`, you should use the variable `d` (but move it's +1 earlier in the loop) to write `distances_int[self.vertex_label(v_int)] = d`

In `generic_graph.py`:
* don't modify methods `shortest_path` and `shortest_paths`
* do the appropriate changes in methods `shortest_path_length` and `shortest_path_lengths`

Finally, please use a shorter name for the branch like `u/jlokesh/7675` and adopt the good practice of `git commit -m "trac #7675: short but relevant description of this commit" -a`. You can also make multiple commits.

I just wanted to point out that there are cases where a one-line commit message is not appropriate, and you would add a multi-line explanation there (without using `-m` flag, 
but letting git pop-up an editor to write the commit message in).

Another handy thing is `git commit --amend` to change the last commit (can be only the message, or also actual changes).

For sure, you should not modify the `shortest_path` method in `generic_graph`, but change the `shortest_path_length` method.

Sorry to post a little late with comments, but there are a few small things I think need to be addressed.

I don't see the need or desire to have a separate dict `distances_int` in `shortest_path_all_vertices`. Just add an extra `if` statement when initializing `distances[v]`. IMO it is cleaner code and doesn't require allocating an unnecessary object.

This is both the wrong type of error (for the message) and the wrong statement:

```
            raise ValueError("Algorithm " + algorithm + " not yet " +
                             "implemented. Please, contribute!")
```
For example, `algorithm='foobar'` says we should implement a fictitious algorithm. A `ValueError` is the correct error message, but it should say something like `'unknown algorithm "{}"'.format(algorithm)`. (Edit: Yes, no capital letter. Bad splicing of my post.)

Minor point, but for easier readability (PEP8), use `a == b` instead of `a==b` and similarly:

```
def shortest_path_all_vertices(self, v, cutoff=None, distance_flag=False):
```

I agree that we can safely get ride of the `distances_int` dict using an extra `if`. It will be cleaner.

For the error message, the convention to follow is `raise ValueError('unknown algorithm "{}"'.format(algorithm))`, so without capital letter for the first word and no `.` at the end.

So you also have to change `raise ValueError("The 'BFS_Bid' algorithm does not work on weighted graphs."` to `raise ValueError("the 'BFS_Bid' algorithm does not work on weighted graphs")`

It should be ok to do so, but be aware that some tickets like #23124 are currently modifying many files in `graphs`.

In `shortest_paths`, please change 
`if self.num_verts()==1 and self.vertices()[0]==u` to
`if self.order() == 1 and self.has_vertex(u):`

I forgot to update the tests for the changes made to the error message. The second commit makes those changes.

Looking at the code, I realize that we have the following problem:

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: 2 in G
False
sage: G.shortest_path(2,2)
[2]
sage: G.shortest_path_length(2,2)
0
```
I don't know why it has not been reported before.

Can you add necessary tests to check that u and v are in the graph and raise an error if it is not the case.

Thanks.

In the diff, I see the following modifications that must be cancelled.

```
-.. csv-table::
+ v\sv-table::
```

```
-    :meth:`~GenericGraph.add_vertex` | Create an isolated vertex.
+*-* :meth:`~GenericGraph.add_vertex` | Create an isolated vertex.
```

In case, you can "quickly" rebuild the html documentation of the graph module using `./sage -docbuild reference/graphs html`.


Concerning the tests, I would prefer something like that (and 

```
if not self.has_vertex(u):
    raise ValueError("vertex '{}' is not in the (di)graph".format(u))
if not self.has_vertex(v):
    raise ValueError("vertex '{}' is not in the (di)graph".format(v))
