In Sage 4.1, the category of a category was changed from Objects() to Sets(). I.e. we used to have:

```
sage: Groups().category()
Category of objects
```
And now we have:

```
sage: Groups().category()
Category of sets
```

The attached patch reverts this, in particular because the
objects of Sets() are exactly the parents.
