I have added two references; fixed the points() method to return points in lexicographic order so `__eq__` works properly; made is_simple() its own standalone method and call it from block_design_checker and added the following constructions: Derived at a Point, Residual at a Point, Derived at a Block, Residual at a Block, Complementary, Supplementary, Point Deletion and Extraction of Blocks by size.

Some relevant discussion is here:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/305158ab5d3181bc

Reviewers:

- Please think about my first item on the TODO list; is that a better way to proceed with derived_blck and residual_blck?

-I do not know whether this is "Minor" or "Major" (I am pretty sure it is not the others) so I have put "Major".  Please tell me if I was wrong.

- I have no idea what to put in Milestone so I have left it blank.

I have changed the function names so they are all fully descriptive of what they do.

I also have a question.  When I run:

sage -coverage Projects/SAGE/sage-source/devel/sage/sage/combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py

I do get 100% coverage but I also get:

ERROR: Please add a `TestSuite(s).run()` doctest.

I have looked in the sage reference manual and the developers guide to see what this is and how I add such a thing, but to no avail.  If someone knows what this is please tell me or send a link to a page that describes it.  When I know what to do, I will add one of these.

Here is the patch for adding such a thing to matrices in Sage.  You might find the code useful as an example.

#6936

Here is the ticket that introduced the framework:

#6343

I don't know where this is documented, but there probably is a mailing list message or two about it.

There's general information about building on Solaris at
