Distribute is a fork of setuptools that aims to be open and actively maintained. It's also run by a handful of core Python devs.

There's a new spkg file, as well as updates to `spkg/install` and `spkg/standard/deps`. All three are sitting in this directory:

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/craigcitro/distribute-spkg/

To test, delete the setuptools spkg, drop in the new `install` and `deps`, and then build sage. (Or, alternately, build the two spkgs that currently depend on setuptools -- Jinja and SQLAlchemy.)

Yep, it failed on my Mac, too. I have no idea why: it's having trouble finding the Jinja egg, which is there in `site-packages`, and is listed in `easy_install.pth`! Here's the error message:

It's clearly trying to go out and grab a dependency from the internet -- but I don't know why. In theory, that dependency should be provided already ... here's `easy_install.pth`:

```
import sys; sys.__plen = len(sys.path)
./distribute-0.6.6-py2.6.egg
./Jinja-1.2-py2.6-macosx-10.3-i386.egg

import sys; new=sys.path[sys.__plen:]; del sys.path[sys.__plen:]; p=getattr(sys,'__egginsert',0); sys.path[p:p]=new; sys.__egginsert = p+len(new)
```

It's **identical** to the `easy_install.pth` installed via setuptools; I have no idea why it's failing.

I get this with both 32-bit and 64-bit.

As I said earlier, I've also seen a different error -- it got a little farther and bombed when it reached Sphinx, and it was trying to download Jinja1.2.  In that case, there were files "setuptools.pth" and "setuptools-0.6....egg" in SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-packages by the time the build failed.
