This patch adds the standard workaround (copying over the system package to $SAGE_LOCAL/lib). This should not ever fail since `readline` is in the `base` repository, and so should be installed in all systems.

Originally I thought it was because readline linked to termcap, which is disabled in Arch, but linking to curses did not help.

> On running Sage or the next build, readline fails with:
> 

```
 bash: symbol lookup error: /opt/sage-bin/local/lib/libreadline.so.6: undefined symbol: PC
```

This is because our shared libreadline lacks a `DT_NEEDED` tag for libtermcap, libncurses, libtinfo or whichever library provides these symbols (depends on the OS / distro).

I have a readline 6.2.p2 spkg which fixes this, but haven't yet opened a ticket for it...

(Just in case someone searches for this error and ends up here.)
