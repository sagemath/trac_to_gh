The following is a quote from John Cremona, 

    http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/3638a91c0438f439

I define a rational function in two variables over a finite field:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(2)[]
sage: f = x*y/(x+y)
sage: f.parent()
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite
Field of size 2

```

I try to factor it, and get this error:

```
sage: f.factor()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

(sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.cpp:22701)()

NotImplementedError: proof = True factorization not implemented.  Call

```

So I do what I am told, but:

```
sage: f.factor(proof=False)

The patch I attached earlier changes the behaviour of the factoring method in fraction fields, passing on additional parameters to the factoring method of the underlying ring rather than ignoring them.

I've now tested the patch (without the ``long`` option), and this did not return any test failures.
