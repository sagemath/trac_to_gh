Mostly looks good, although the math environment dealt with in `trac_7772-typo.patch` doesn't look good either before or after the patch.  I'm attaching a patch to fix this.  In fact, there are two attachments: the "delta" patch shows my changes, and for the convenience of the release manager, the "all-in-one" patch is just that.

For anyone else who looks at this, to get rid of the "duplicate citation" messages, I had to delete the output and then rebuild the tutorial; otherwise, the cached versions were confusing Sphinx.
