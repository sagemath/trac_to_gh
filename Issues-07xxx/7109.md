The Polyhedron class is an interface to cdd, but does not correctly map some of the features that go beyond compact, full-dimensional polyhedra. For starters, "linearities" means two different things for H- and V-representation (equalities or lines), but there is only one self.linearities() method. For reference:

**H-representation: inequalities and equalities**

**V-representation: conv(vertices) + IR_+{rays} + IR{lines}**

It is often confusing what has already been computed from the complementary representation and what has not been computed, and the package does not always get it right. For example:

```
  sage: vert_to_ieq(vertices=[[0]], rays=[[1]]).linearities()
  [[0, 1]]
  sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[0]], rays=[[1]]).linearities() 
  []
```
Also, the constructor by default eliminates redundant vertices but not other redundant data which can be confusing.

Finally, ccd pivots and hence changes the enumeration of the data. This makes parsing the incidences and adjacencies tricky. 

### Proposal

I propose to change the behaviour of Polyhedron such that the constructor automatically computes both an optimized H-representation and an optimized V-representation. Thereafter, no more calls to cdd would be necessary. 

If one really wants to use Polyhedron as a container for only H-representation or only V-representation, then a special class constructing function can do that. Any calls to methods that require the complementary data shall then fail with an `AttributeError` exception.


### cdd caveats

cdd sometimes omits the origin as a vertex:

```
  sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[[0, 1]]).vertices()
  []
```
cdd also sometimes adds a "inequality at infininty"; Contrary to the output below, the half-line has only one face

```
  sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[0]], rays=[[1]]).facial_incidences()
  [[0, [0]], [1, [1]]]
```
Given equations/inequalities without a solution, cdd will return an empty polyhedron (no vertices). But conversely, given an empty polyhedron, cdd will error out instead of producing equations without solution (one of the cases where the H-representation is not unique)

### Plan

1) Write a binary based on cddlib that acts as a filter stdin->stdout and computes an canonical H- and V-representation. I'll attach a suitable patch against the contents of cddlib-094f.spkg

2) change polyhedra.py to run cdd only once in the constructor (TODO)

3) compute incidence matrix within sage as cddlib does not have a convenient function to do so without adding an "inequality at infinity" (TODO)

If you want to add the missing test that would be great. Email me if you have questions / comments.

I tried to stick to the following general philosophy for the polytopes class:

* if the vertex coordinates can be chosen rational, then the polyhedron should be in QQ

* otherwise, the polyhedron should be over RDF by default. A rational approximation can be optional via a "field=QQ" parameter.

Floating point coordinates are fine with cddlib as long as the input is sufficiently nondegenerate, and polytopes defined by vertices are no problem.

I agree with you that compatibily should be preserved if possible.

I don't think it will be all that hard to keep most things compatible.  Part of the point of doctests is to check back-compatibility, so I think if possible all the old doctests of things like vertices() should be put back in.  

Its true that "vertices" might be chosen more often, but I think its worth it.  The present behavior has been around for almost 2 years, so its not a minor issue.  By caching lists I don't think this is terribly inefficient.  Also, anyone who can't understand what vertex_generator does probably doesn't want a generator object.  

I will keep thinking about this; my understanding is improving as I write the doctests.

Previously we only eliminated redundant vertices, now we also eliminate redundant (in)equalities. I added some timing to the output:

```

The polyhedral input is one with relatively few vertices (and without any redundancies), but lots of inequalities. This is why reducing the inequalities to a minimal set takes relatively long.

About 2/3 of the total time is spent on computing facet adjacencies. This part of the computation could be split off, but since it is less than one order of magnitude it is probably not worth the added complexity.

I haven't had as much time as I'd like but I've been working a little on the doctests.  I am still concerned about speed - even when computing the same quantities, the new code seems to be 2 to 3 times slower for most operations.  

For backwards compatibility, I changed the keyword "ineqs" back to "ieqs", and made the vertices function return a list of lists as before.  The function returning a generator of vertices I renamed vertex_generator.  Just those two changes help a lot with compatibility.  I think having vertices() cache the list will speed up some other functions too, once I rewrite them to take advantage of that.

I am almost done getting this to 100% coverage.  I am understanding the classes a lot better now so the final doctests should be fairly easy for me to do.

I am checking the building the reference manual and that made me aware of the fact that a few other modules in sage depend on functions that are removed by this patch.  One example is that sage.rings.polynomial.groebner_fan imported the function ieq_to_vert which is deleted by this rewrite.  It should be fairly easy to convert that, but to be safe I think it should be included again, deprecated, and removed in sage-5.0.  

Otherwise with a few more back-compatibility tweaks this should be ready for review soon, by the end of December at the latest.  I think vbraun should look over my changes and then we will really need a 3rd person to do a final review.

OK, this now passes all tests with 100% coverage.  Current issues I plan on addressing:

1) Add old functions that are missing:
{{{facial_adjacencies
facial_incidences
graph
linearities
n_facets
render_solid
render_wireframe
schlegel_projection
simplicial_complex
triangulated_facial_incidences
vertex_adjacencies
vertex_incidences}}}

2) Fix Groeber_fan.py to reflect these changes.  
3) Fix newton_polytope function doctests.
4) Add polyhedra.py to reference manual.
5) Change some functions for back-compatibility.
6) Deprecate overlaps where the new name/functionality is clearly better.

I looked through the patch and it looks pretty good! Some minor changes:

* Beautified documentation
* Made clear that ieqs() is an alias for inequalities().
* Fixed the crash _init_from_cdd_output() for the input
  sage: p = Polyhedron(ieqs = [[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0]]) 
* Renamed the generator for incident V-representation objects from
  Hrepresentation.facet() to Hrepresentation.incident(). Wrote the
  analogous Vrepresentation.incident()
* Added aliases Hrepresentation.adjacent() for
  Hrepresentation.neighbors() and Vrepresentation.adjacent() for
  Vrepresentation.neighbors()
* Hrepresentation now accepts an optional argumment: 
  Hrepresentation(i) now returns Hrepresentation()[i]. same with Vrepresentation
* Rewrote facial_adjacencies(), facial_incidences(),
  vertex_adjacencies(), vertex_incidences() to make use of the
  Hrepresentation/Vrepresentation objects.
* Equation._repr_() fixed.

As far as I am concerned, this is now ready for inclusion in sage.

Here is how (I think) everything should be applied. First, the patches from within sage

```
sage: hg_sage.apply('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7109/trac_7109_mh1.patch.gz')
sage: hg_sage.apply('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7109/trac_7109_vb1.patch.gz')
```

Now the cddlib-094f.spkg update: in the sage home directory, do

```
[vbraun@volker-two sage]$ ls
COPYING.txt  data  devel  examples  install.log  ipython  local  makefile  README.txt  sage  sage-README-osx.txt  spkg
[vbraun@volker-two sage]$ wget https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7109/cddlib-094f.spkg.gz
[...]
[vbraun@volker-two sage]$ ./sage -f cddlib-094f.spkg 
[...]
[vbraun@volker-two sage]$ ./sage -br
```

I did this in Sage version 4.3. I don't see any problem with gfan/#7820, doctests pass. It seems to me that trac_7109_referee2.patch unnecessarily includes the patch from #7820. In any case, #7820 only fixes output that is used in doctests and should be completely independent of this rewrite.

I think the point of referee patches was to separate the work done by different people and make it possible to see what was actually changed by Marshall, as opposed to the code which he already carefully reviewed and accepted modulo his changes.

Yes to both points - the only reason for the referee patch was to clarify what I did, so its irrelevant to actually applying things, and I will look over Volker's patch.  Then hopefully either Alex or Andrey can review the final changes.

I will try to check out Volker's changes tomorrow (January 23) and summarize things after that, although family obligations might cause some delay.

The new spkg has a few minor issues:

```
[ghitza@artin cddlib-094f-p2]$ hg status
M spkg-install
? .DS_Store
? patches/cdd_both_reps-make.patch
? patches/cdd_both_reps.c
```

I fixed all of this and put up the new spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ghitza/cddlib-094f-p2.spkg

Note that SPKG.txt is not in the correct format, but this will be another ticket.


Now:  There are obviously not enough patches on this ticket :)  So I'm adding another one.  It is small and consists mostly of very minor typo fixes.  It also addresses one major issue: when I ran long doctests on `geometry/polyhedra.py`, it timed out on me.  Here is the reason:

```

CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02 s
720
```

These tests are not just long, they are way too long to include.  So I have marked them as `#not tested`.  If you can think of some way to get them under 30 seconds each, they can go back in.  I don't want to just delete them since they are examples of usage.

One thing that I noticed but not fixed is that none of the geometry code is in the reference manual at the moment.  This should be another ticket.

In summary: I'm giving a positive review to everything so far; someone needs to look at my patch.  We'll sort out authors/reviewers/etc when it's all done.

Summary for the release manager who will have to merge this: once everything has a positive review, get the new spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ghitza/cddlib-094f-p2.spkg

then apply `trac_7109_mh2.patch` and `trac_7109_ag.patch`.

Do you also want to remove the "dist/" directory from the cddlib spkg? Or do you want to open another ticket for this removal? See #5903 for some background information on why "dist/" can be deleted.

```
So what happens here is that you could wait for Sage 4.3.2.alpha0 to be released and then rebase the patches on this ticket against Sage 4.3.2.alpha0. Another option is to rebase [trac_7109_mh2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7109/trac_7109_mh2.patch.gz), and possibly [trac_7109_ag.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7109/trac_7109_ag.patch.gz) as well, on top of #7535.

OK, it was a really tiny rebase, but so annoying nevertheless.

I've put up a combined patch that has everything in it.

No changes were really needed, since the piece that #7535 had modified simply didn't exist any more.  So I'm tempted to set this to positive review again, but maybe Minh can check that it indeed applies for him.

I don't understand what the `Polyhedron().radius_square()` function included in this ticket is trying to do. I've rewritten it at #12492, if anyone wants to take a look.
