This ticket implement PQ-Trees, to be used as a recognition algorithm for interval graphs. It also defines the function Graph.is_interval.

For the moment, PQ-Trees are defined inside of the graph/ folder, as it is where they are useful for the moment, but this may change if someone has a better idea :-)

I tried to document it as much as I could. Tell me if anything is missing !

Depends on #8284.

Oh yes, and... There are many missing doctests, but as this algorithm heavily uses dictionaries I wondered whether this could be done without being platform-dependent ^^;

Any idea welcome, here too.. Even though those functions will never be needed directly by the users, and all of them are indirectly tested anyway through the docstrings of is_interval.

Ouch.  That's a problem.  I don't think the ticket should go into Sage without doctests on each python function.

(I haven't had time to look at the rest of the patch, though.)
