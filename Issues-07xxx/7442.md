The package [scipy-0.7.1.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/scipy-0.7.1.spkg) contains some changes not yet checked in:

```
[mvngu@sage scipy-0.7.1]$ hg status
? .copy_patches.pl.swp
? patches/setup.py.special.orig
```
Is `patches/setup.py.special.orig` meant to be under revision control? The file `.copy_patches.pl.swp` looks like a junk file. If so, it needs to be deleted.
