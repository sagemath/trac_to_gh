Did you know there is a directory SAGE_ROOT/examples?   Do you care?  Because if nobody seriously cares, I'm going to *delete it* from future versions of Sage, since it is still a mess, and the last nontrivial commit was 1.5 years ago (!):

summary:     Extract sagetex.py and sagetex.sty
```
I can put the same directory online somewhere, and move the fortran file that is used in one doctest out.  I'm just really curious if anybody knows about this directory and cares. 

**Apply**:
1. [attachment: trac_7494.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7494/trac_7494.patch.gz) to the Sage library repo

**Release Manager:**

Delete `$SAGE_ROOT/examples/` as part of this ticket. 

(This should happen automatically, i.e., the directory should vanish, when `sdist`ing.)

I was wondering about that directory too a few months ago.  So we don't do anything with it currently?  Here are comments.

I think it would be worth linking at least a few of the top-level ones to the wiki, and perhaps put in one of the documentation places, as some of the examples files there are definitely useful for templates.  

I bet some of the programming (Pyrex/SageX/Cython) examples might be useful too.  

I am cc:ing wdj to see if he thinks all his examples/routines from calculus are now in the main Sage library.

The linalg folder is definitely pointless, as permanents are now in the main library.

The worksheets folder seems pretty pointless in its current state.

The tests directory has some things that should be added as random doctests for those things, though.

The modsym directory stuff likely is already tested in that area, given how important it is to Sage!

The latex_embed is obviously superfluous at this point.

Fortran was has already discussed above.

Finance is *really* pointless.

The Groebner basis thing seems intriguing - perhaps should be incorporated in doctests for that elsewhere?

Is the Ajax thing now very very superfluous, given how much we use it?  It's not (that) old.

The GSL folder is quite large compared to the rest and perhaps has some examples which should be combined into one big file which is doctested, if those sorts of tests aren't.  It would seem valuable not to lose this many doctests -does it currently pass?

I just realized that there is one thing that has to be done. Observe:

```
wstein@ubuntu:~/d/sage$ sage -grep "examples"|grep SAGE_ROOT
finance/stock.py:            sage: finance.Stock('aapl').load_from_file(SAGE_ROOT + '/examples/finance/AAPL-minutely.csv')[:5]
finance/stock.py:            sage: finance.Stock('goog').load_from_file(SAGE_ROOT + '/examples/finance/AAPL-minutely.csv')[:5]
finance/stock.py:            sage: finance.Stock('aapl').load_from_file(SAGE_ROOT + "/examples/finance/AAPL-minutely.csv")
misc/hg.py:hg_examples = HG('%s/data/examples'%SAGE_ROOT,
misc/inline_fortran.py:            sage: s = open(os.environ['SAGE_ROOT'] + '/examples/fortran/FIB1.F').read()
wstein@ubuntu:~/d/sage$ 
```

So the stuff in examples that are used in doctests need to be moved to the SAGE_ROOT/data/ directory.  Thus one needs to attach a patch that does this to this ticket, and that patch will need to be reviewed.

Trash it.  There's too much old misleading stuff about as is.

I renamed the examples directory, applied the patch, ran tests and got no failures.

I guess we need to alert the release manager somehow to actually delete the directory in the next distribution?  I'll put a note above, edit as necessary.

Attachment: **[trac_7494-root-repo.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7494/trac_7494-root-repo.patch.gz)**

Ok, I've `sdist`ed with a version with the patches applied, built the new Sage distribution from scratch, and all (long) tests pass.

As expected, I got rid of the `examples/` directory and the spkg in the new distro.
(Note that also the examples spkg in `spkg/standard/` of the *original* distribution got deleted; not sure whether this is intentional. In contrast, the `examples/` directory there remained.)

Upgrading from a path without an examples spkg *should*<sup>TM</sup> IMHO also work; haven't tried that [yet].




Don't know yet whether Jeroen's merger is "prepared" for such an operation, and since Sage 4.7.2.alpha3 is almost out, I don't think I'll attempt to merge this ticket into *this* release. There'll certainly be an alpha4, or we could try with the next release candidate.

Unfortunately we don't win much regarding the size; the current examples spkg is just 2.0 MB, 3.9 MB uncompressed on my disk (i.e., the size of the `examples/` directory), and just 2.6 MB in "real" bytes.
