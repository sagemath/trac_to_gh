Using
* A Sun Blade 2000 running Solaris 10 update 7
* Sage 4.1.2.rc0
* gcc 4.4.1
* SAGE64 exported to "yes"

We can see that libpng is building 32-bit libraries, despite other packages are building 64-bit libraries. 

```
libpng12.so:    ELF 32-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARC32PLUS Version 1, V8+ Required, dynamically linked, not stripped
libpng12.so.0:  ELF 32-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARC32PLUS Version 1, V8+ Required, dynamically linked, not stripped
libpng12.so.0.35.0:     ELF 32-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARC32PLUS Version 1, V8+ Required, dynamically linked, not stripped
libreadline.a:  current ar archive, not a dynamic executable or shared object
libreadline.so: ELF 64-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARCV9 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
libreadline.so.6:       ELF 64-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARCV9 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
```

Other packages building 32-bit libraries, even when SAGE64 is set to  yes include, but are probably not limited to. 
* zlib #7128
* libgpg_error #7129

I will sort this package out after creating a new sage-env, which exports all the variables properly, including the flag for building 64-bit code, which is not always -m64.

Although there is no support for AIX or HP-UX in Sage yet, we could potentially add it - I personally own machines running AIX and HP-UX.

IBM's compiler on AIX uses -q64, and HP's on HP-UX uses +DD64.

The sensible way to resolve this is to add the correct flag on every platform.

This is a quick hack, to get this to build only with only gcc and perhaps Sun Studio, as they both take -m64. A more portable solution, which will work for any compiler will be implemented later.
