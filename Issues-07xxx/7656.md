There are some extra tricks in here: http://www.jjj.de/fxt/#fxtbook

in the first chapter for doing bitset operations that ought to be applied to our Bitset class.  For example, there is a trick that allows you to count the number of bits in log time instead of linear time.

More bitset tricks can be found at:

* [Bit Twiddling Hacks](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html) by Sean Eron Anderson
* [All The Twiddled Bits](http://bits.stephan-brumme.com) by Stephan Brumme

The project on this ticket can be divided up into the following sub-projects:

1. #10287 memleak in bitset_realloc()
2. #10093 clean up documentation of sage/misc/bitset.pyx
3. #10269 clean up documentation of sage/misc/bitset_pxd.pxi
4. #10245 clean up documentation of sage/misc/bitset.pxi

This FXTBook is the best book in the universe. I'm *EAGER* to read it.

About the counting trick : there is a builtin gcc command called __builtin_popcount which may do wonders. It does count the bits in general (though I haven't found the corresponding code) -- it may well be the logarithmic way (+very nice trick btw), and in case the popcnt instruction is available on the processor, it is directly called.

And I assure you for having compared the two that it does.... WONDERS :-D
