This patch allows us to count the number of spanning trees in a simple graph, as well as the spanning out-trees from a user-defined root node in a digraph.

Method used: Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem [1] and the Laplacian matrix for the simple graphs, and a variation of the same [2] in the directed case.

Here is a new patch based on yours, plus some modifications :
* I was not able at first to apply your patch, as it was based on an old version of Sage. This new version is now based on 4.1.2.rc0.
* I fixed some docstrings :
      * you set "math" mode with this sign : ` 
        ( exemple : `x^2` )
      * you set "sage" mode with this sign : `` 
        ( exemple : ``graph.am()`` )
* I renamed the function from spanning_trees to spanning_tree_count as the first seemed to imply an iterator over spanning_trees
* Some details concerning the root_vertex too. Many graphs have vertices not among integers but among strings, or tuples, etc. Besides, it is not necessary to enumerate all the vertices to get the first one :

      ```
      v=G.vertices()[0]
  ```
  You can also do :

      ```
      v=G.vertex_iterator().next()
  ```
* You had to modify the adjacency matrix to fit the definition used in your references. This was perfectly fine, but also meant there was an error in the definition of ``kirchhoff_matrix`` for directed graph. This patch fixes this, plus some docstrings error in the kirchhoff_matrix function.

Short of these details, you algorithm works fine, thank you for having sent this patch !!

If you agree with this nex patch I am sending, you can set this ticket to positive_review

Thanks !

Nathann

Algorithm is OK, both for Graphs and Digraphs. You had to re-define

Ncohen, you've broken kirchhoff_matrix.  According to the definition, row-sums of the Kirchhoff matrix should be zero.  Here's the doctest before you changed it:

```
sage: G = DiGraph({1:{1:2,2:3}, 2:{1:4}}, weighted=True,sparse=True) 
sage: G.laplacian_matrix() 
[ 3 -3] 
[-4  4] 
```
here, the row-sums are zero.

But you actually had to change the doctest to make the code pass,

```
sage: G = DiGraph({1:{1:2,2:3}, 2:{1:4}}, weighted=True,sparse=True) 
sage: G.laplacian_matrix() 
[ 4 -3] 
[-4  3] 
```
but the row-sums aren't zero!  Don't break math to make code work!

Hello !!

Yes, I indeed changed the docstring because I thought this was a bug in kirchoff_matrix. As it is written in the patch I sent, the definition of kirchhoff matrix perfectly matches the definition from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix
Two differences : the kirchhoff matrix can be defined when the graph is a DiGraph. 
* In this case, as defined ( for example ) in the book AJonsson is mentionning, the diagonal values should be set to the indegree of each vertex ( and not their out-degree as it is currenty the case ). He has, in his own code, to change manually the values from the returned kirchhoff_matrix, which I felt was not right if the kirchhoff_matrix function was "correctly" defined ( "correctly" here means : according to this book ).
* In this docstring, you test your code against a special graph, as it has loops. As you see, the definition from wikipedia does not include the case where the graph includes loops. The definition from the book AJonsson mentions in his docstring ( I have it as a pdf file and can send it to you if you like ) produces the output of the functions kirchoff_matrix when my patch is applied.

I honestly thought this was just a bug happening in special cases ( DiGraph + loops ), and checked several times the definition. Could you tell me which one you used ? 

Sorry for the trouble. In added you in Cc uniquely to avoid unnoticed changes like this. Oh, and btw, I ran sage -testall to be sure this modifications broke no part of Sage.

Hello Nathann,
thanks for your review. I agree with your changes and have made an updated patch against sage 4.1.2. I did some more testing and noticed that the code for digraphs could easily be crashed by adding string-labeled vertices, so added a type check for that.


As for the Laplacian matrix, I left the current function alone since I saw the following on wikipedia: "In the case of directed graphs, either the indegree or the outdegree might be used [for the diagonal values], depending on the application." At the present only the out-degree is used in sage, but it would of course be possible to make it a user option at creation of the Laplacian matrix if in- or out-degrees are to be used.

If as you say, the two different ways are used, the best option would be to modify kirchhoff_matrix as you say, to let the user choose its own definition. ( the problem with the loops still remains, though, but we do not really care about it in this special application ).\n\nI am still worried about what you said considering Strings, though.

Considering the view Tom Boothby had of my little modification of kirchhoff_matrix, it may be better not to touch it for the moment in this patch. If as you say, the two different ways are used, the best option would be to modify kirchhoff_matrix as you say, to let the user choose its own definition. ( the problem with the loops still remains, though, but we do not really care about it in this special application ).

I am still worried about what you said considering Strings, though.

This patch should satisfy all of us, I hope. It includes the last version of AJonsson's code, and it adds an argument to kirchhoff_matrix so that the user may chose if D is the matrix of indegree or outdegrees.

I added the corresponding documentation to the kirchhoff_matrix function.

I have to mention that the way kirchhoff_matrix is written contains a lot of repetitions because of the possibility of different values for the indegree variable. I thought of other ways to write it to preserve the code, but these ways could have at some point impaired the performances, as checks for the values of the variable indegree could have happened much more often. I write it this way as the function is still very short and this should not be a problem for its maintenance.
