This should probably give a warning to the user that the matrix is ill-conditioned and you may get wrong results (like you do in this case).

```
sage: n = matrix([ [-0.3, 0.2, 0.1],
                    [0.2, -0.4, 0.4],
                    [0.1, 0.2, -0.5] ])

sage: n.echelon_form()

[ 1.00000000000000 0.000000000000000 0.000000000000000]
