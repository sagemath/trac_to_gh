It answer always true if two posets have the same size:

```
sage: p1 = Posets(2)[0]; p2 = Posets(2)[1]
sage: p1.cover_relations()
[]
sage: p2.cover_relations()
[[0, 1]]
sage: p1 == p2
True
```

The fix posted here solve the problem of equality but raise a much more subtle one

```
sage: p1, p2 = Posets(2).list()
sage: p2 < p1
True
sage: [[p1.__cmp__(p2) for p1 in Posets(2)] for p2 in Posets(2)]
[[0, 1], [1, 0]]
sage: [[p2.__cmp__(p1) for p1 in Posets(2)] for p2 in Posets(2)]
[[0, 1], [-1, 0]]
sage: p2 < p1
False
```

I forward the discussion to sage-combinat-devel.
