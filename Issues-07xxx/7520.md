Improve the creation of a word from a word when the parent changes :

BEFORE:

```
sage: w = Word('abab')
sage: P = WordPaths('abcd')
sage: P(w)
word: abab
sage: type(w)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_str'>
sage: type(P(w))
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_str'>
```

AFTER:

```
sage: w = Word('abab')
sage: P = WordPaths('abcd')
sage: P(w)
Path: abab
sage: type(w)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_str'>
sage: type(P(w))
<class 'sage.combinat.words.paths.FiniteWordPath_square_grid_str'>
```

The following construction gets also faster with the patch applied :

BEFORE:

```
sage: w = Word([0,1]*10000)
sage: %timeit z = Words([2,0,1])(w)
1000 loops, best of 3: 586 µs per loop
```

AFTER:

```
sage: w = Word([0,1]*10000)
sage: %timeit z = Words([2,0,1])(w)
1000 loops, best of 3: 343 µs per loop
```

My patch needs work:

```
sage: P = WordPaths([0,1,2,3])
sage: P
Word Paths on the square grid
sage: w = words.ChristoffelWord(5,8)
sage: P(w)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'LowerChristoffelWord' object has no attribute '_class_str'
```

> I am changing the status to "needs work" because I thought of a cleaner way of solving this.

I still think that the construction of words is not clean, but I will not clean it in this ticket. This ticket solves some problems and I believe it can now get a review and an eventual merge into sage. 

Here are some key points I am actually thinking (I am writing them as a reference for future improvements):

- The first version of sage-words got merged into sage in the end of December 2008. In January 2009, we quickly realized that many improvements should be done to the library (involving word construction, reorganisation of the classes and of course, many pickle problem...). In July 2009, the big reorganisation was merged into sage without breaking any pickle (Thanks to Franco for the quirk).
- The code now looks really ugly for supporting the old pickled objects and I don't like ugly code. 
- I am looking forward to get rid of word_content, utils and friends. 
- I don't hide that I would be happy to have the right to break the pickle of the old word objects and replace the ugly code by clean and simple code.
- Looking afterward, I think we should not have supported any pickling of word objects for the first year (by suggesting the users to save their word objects as lists). Doing so, it would have allow some time for us to find really what we think is the good solution for classes and word constructors.
- `CallableFromListOfWords` inherits from tuple which I think is bad because (1) it doesn't have to and (2) it is the only last reason why one must use the datatype='callable' for word creation.
- Then, get rid of the datatype argument.
- I think that creating classes inline from bases classes (`MathObject` + `DataObject`) would work. And, in this case, `__reduce__` should not return a class as first argument but the usual Word function. Did Nicolas Thiéry convinced anyone about creating inline classes? Was it used in the lastly merged category code?
- `WordDatatype_callable` is storing its data into the attributes `self._func` while I think all those `WordDatatype` should save their data into the same `self._data`.
- When writing a `__reduce__` function, always make sure to put only essential things because this might become a problematic argument to be supported by creation function in the future. Moreover, the first argument of the tuple returned should be think as a function (or a class) that will always exist.
- Right now only `WordDatatype` provide `__reduce__` function. Now, what if the `FiniteWord_class` now wants to store some attributes. How to set them again after loading a pickle word? It might work by defining `__setstate__` and `__getstate__` for `FiniteWord_class`... To be checked! I would be great if we could do it without defining any function in the (inline) classes like `FiniteWord_list`.

> I will fold the two actual patches, improve them and post a new patch soon...

So I did folded the two actual patches. I also updated the description of the patch to help the review. The patch now needs review!
