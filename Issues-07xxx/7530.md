It is not possible to form a polynomial ring over a Laurent polynomial ring.  This is because the function `is_integral_domain` for Laurent polynomial rings lacks the optional parameter `proof=True` (unlike every other instance of `is_integral_domain`).  The patch corrects this omission, which solves the problem.

Patch applies to 4.3.rc0, but:

1. The function does not use the new parameter!
2. No examples or doctests are given.

so -- needs work!

Thanks, John.  

You're right; the `proof` parameter needs to be passed on to the base ring, which I've done in a replacement patch.  I've included an example verifying that the problem I had with constructing a polynomial ring over a Laurent polynomial ring is solved by the patch.

As it happens, the Laurent polynomial constructor currently restricts the base ring to be an integral domain.  Of course this isn't (mathematically) necessary, but the current code for taking negative powers of Laurent polynomial generators uses the fraction field of the base ring (producing some bizarre errors in the process).  I'll raise another ticket about this issue.
