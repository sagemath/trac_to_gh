That's definitely a coercion bug.   You can workaround it like this:


sage: sage: A.<z>=LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: sage: B.<w>=LaurentSeriesRing(A)
sage: z/w
1
sage: (1/w) * z
z*w^-1
```

Before any division takes place, z is getting incorrectly coerced to w.  I think this is because in laurent_series_ring_element.pyx, in the LaurentSeries class `__init__` method the represention (variable)^n*f is shifted by the code:

```
        else:
            val = f.valuation()
            if val == 0:
                self.__n = n    # power of the variable
                self.__u = f    # unit part
            else:
                self.__n = n + val
                self.__u = f >> val
```

and I think that shifting is missing that different variables are involved.
