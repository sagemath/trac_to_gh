Consider the following situation:

```
sage: S = Spec(ZZ)
sage: x = S.an_element()
```
Running `TestSuite(S)` and `TestSuite(x)` yields several failures.  A related problem is

```
sage: S
Spectrum of Integer Ring
sage: parent(x)
Set of rational points of Spectrum of Integer Ring
```
whereas we expect `parent(x) is S`.

Here is the complete `TestSuite` report:

```
sage: TestSuite(S).run()
Failure in _test_an_element:
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError
------------------------------------------------------------
  Failure in _test_category:
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: False is not true
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Failure in _test_pickling:
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: Point on Spectrum of Integer Ring defined by the Principal ideal (991) of Integer Ring != Point on Spectrum of Integer Ring defined by the Principal ideal (991) of Integer Ring
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  The following tests failed: _test_category, _test_pickling
Failure in _test_elements
Failure in _test_some_elements:
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError
------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed: _test_an_element, _test_elements, _test_some_elements
```

```
sage: TestSuite(x).run()
Failure in _test_category:
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: False is not true
------------------------------------------------------------
Failure in _test_pickling:
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: Point on Spectrum of Integer Ring defined by the Principal ideal (991) of Integer Ring != Point on Spectrum of Integer Ring defined by the Principal ideal (991) of Integer Ring
------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed: _test_category, _test_pickling
```

(Note: the `NotImplementedError` that one gets after applying #16158 is a different one than before.)


Depends on #16158

#11599 claims to fix this, but I am not entirely sure what would it take to fix this ticket - the reported category is now schemes and only 3 of the `TestSuite` tests fail.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

What is `Spec` intended to mean in the first place?  The definition currently starts with

```
class Spec(AffineScheme):
    ....
```
This suggests that `Spec` is a special kind of affine scheme.  But aren't "the spectrum of a ring" and "an affine scheme" exactly the same thing?

This code probably predates the category framework.  A more modern design would perhaps be something like the following:
- define the category `AffineSchemes` (or `Schemes().Affine()`) of affine schemes;
- designate `AffineScheme` as the "canonical" type for objects in this category, and move functionality from `Spec` to `AffineScheme` as appropriate;
- convert `Spec` into a functor from `CommutativeRings` to `AffineSchemes`.
(Mathematically speaking, Spec [as a functor from commutative rings to schemes, or even locally ringed spaces] can be defined as the adjoint functor of the global sections functor *X* -> *O<sub>X</sub>*(*X*) from schemes to commutative rings, and this gives an anti-equivalence of categories from commutative rings to affine schemes; I wonder if this could somehow be formalised in Sage's category framework, but that's another story...)

[Edit: the above idea is now essentially #16158, although there is no category of affine schemes yet.]

Is there some way you can get rid of that custom `__call__` method in `AffineScheme`, or at least passes things up through the `Parent.__call__` when trying to construct an element?
