Currently, the code that recognizes a source file is part of the sage library and hence is run from a different location than where the edit copy lives, is broken due to the python2.5 -> python2.6 upgrade. Attached fixes this problem and makes matching more robust so that it won't break the next time. To illustrate the problem, currently we have

```
sage: sage.misc.edit_module.file_and_line(edit)
('/usr/local/sage/4.3/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/edit_module.py', 194)
```
which obviously is NOT the file to edit. It should be `.../sage/devel/...` instead. Attached patch fixes this.
