Looks good to me.

Apply [attachment: trac_7289-rebased.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7289/trac_7289-rebased.patch.gz) and [attachment: trac_7289-part2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7289/trac_7289-part2.patch.gz)

Nathann, Can I get your approval for the second patch? Switch it to positive if you're happy with it.
