This one looks good to me.  However, when testing #4621 I noticed that this:

```
F.<a>= NumberField(x^2-2)
RR(a)
```
causes an infinite recursion, which is not good, but not caused by this patch.

I am giving this a positive review, and letting #4621 be sorted out after, also the issue above.  Perhaps rwb would like to open a ticket for that unless it is already covered by one?
