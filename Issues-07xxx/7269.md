<a id='comment:2'></a>Notes from "functional tests:"

* "Report a Problem," which now appears on more pages, appears to be broken on some.
* "Toggle" seems to be broken.
* Should a "Copy of" a docbrowser worksheet include `default.css`?  Should we strip the copy of the sidebar, header, footer, etc.?

I try to take a closer look at the patch itself tomorrow.

Out of curiousity:

* What is `backwards` for?
* Has anyone seen a inheritance diagram generator for HTML templates?
* Could we unify two or more of `accounts_settings.css`, `user_management.css`, and `registration.css` for a common user/admin settings theme?

I haven't an idea. I just copied that from the old code.
>  * Has anyone seen a inheritance diagram generator for HTML templates?
 
No, but that would be simply awesome.

I actually planned to do a fair bit of changes to the structure (use inheritance instead of includes, etc.), but I think it would be better to put it in another ticket.

> I'll try to look at `main.css` tomorrow...

I actually just copied the old main.css and put it through `css2sass` so I could edit it in SASS [1] and Compass [2]. I find it much easier to edit CSS that way -- just ask if you want to see the SASS source files. It's just a pity that SASS is Ruby-based, and the only Python alternative (CleverCSS) lacks many of the features and community support that SASS has.

I can do so. I'll also put instructions on using SASS + Compass.

I've separated out what I think is a minimal `ws_list.js` for these pages.  It depends only on jQuery.  It'll also depend on jQuery UI after I replace the `alert`s.

* Rebased for #7650.
* Fixes several failed doctests.
* Adds `ws_list.js` to the "Help" and "Log" pages.
* Re-centers the "Help" page.

Problems:

* Live doc worksheets don't render, e.g.,

```python
        exceptions.UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc2 in position 1294: ordinal not in range(128)
```

* Minor: The notebook settings page sections are no longer centered(?).
* Minor: Can we remove `html/notebook/doc.html` and `notebook.html_doc`?  It *appears * to be redundant.
* Minor: The user name is not aligned with "Toggle," "Home," etc.

"Heads up" note: I'm about to

* Revisit #7650 to try to keep `cell.py` doctests from taking too much memory.
* Rebase my patch for #7666, which will visit many .py, .js, and .html files, against this ticket.  The local queue:

To fix this cleanly (without too much cruft) will require a clean MVP/MVC (Model-View-Presenter/Controller) separation. I'm removing the jinja2 conversion from this patch, in the meantime.

To note, `ws_list.js` is the default js include, and so was already included in the Help and Log pages.

I have not noticed that the settings page was centered. IMHO though, I think flush left is cleaner looking (nice straight left edge).

This patch update deletes the obsolete files, aligns the username and removes the Jinja2 migration.

Oops.  I apologize for this.  I'm about to attach V11, which

   * May make the top bar display better in narrow windows or those with large fonts.
   * `ttile` --> `title` in `top_bar.html`.
   * Adds a `tr` to `worksheet_listing.html` (WebKit error).
   * Fixes failed doctests in `template.py`:
   * Restores the previous `template.py` doctests.
   * Adds `'# not tested'` to the Jinja2 tests.
   * Fixes a failed doctest in `notebook.py`.
