One way would be to add target="_new" right before href="...". 

The justification for this change is that currently after looking at the docs one hits the backbutton which results in a corrupted view of the worksheet (for now).

Possibly good idea.  I did something like this with "help(foo)", where it creates a link to a page that opens in a new browser.

I have to say, I really don't like that it gives you the file.  Getting the whole plot/plot.py isn't very useful!  I mean, you can do a text search, but the command-line experience is much better than that.
