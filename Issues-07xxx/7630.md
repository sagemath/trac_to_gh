Right now it says in the Settings page "Require e-mail for account registration".  This implies to me that an account will not be activated until a valid email address is added.  Furthermore, when this is checked, a new account screen says: "Your email address is required for account confirmation and recovery. You will be emailed a confirmation link right after you successfully sign up."  This definitely implies that an account will not be activated until the user clicks on a link.

However, the account is activated, whether or not the user clicks on the link in the email.

If we're going through the trouble of making a link and confirming email addresses, it makes sense to follow the well-established practice of not letting the user log in until they confirm their email address.

It seems that this could be a very easy check in the login stage, too.  Just check to see if "require email address" is set, and if so, check to make sure the user's email address is confirmed.

Patch up, please review. Sorry for the whitespace noise in the patch, I have nuke-trailing-whitespace on in emacs.

Several issues I noticed while working on this:

* The confirmation tokens are not saved across sessions, so if a user signs up, then you quit the notebook and restart, then the user clicks on the confirmation URL, the server says it doesn't know about that confirmation token. This may or may not be something we want to fix.
* We should have a way of letting the admin user bypass the email confirmation, since email can get lost, etc. Perhaps another column in the suspend/reset user account page, so that the admin can just click to consider the email confirmed, or to bypass email confirmation for that user. Or, we might have a "resend confirmation email" feature. Perhaps we should have both.

Twisted includes an SMTP server.

 (b) If I am using Sage on a local lan set up for a specific computer lab then I am not interested in wasting class time with confirmation emails. In my opinion, there should be something like accounts_with_confirmation=True to implement this and accounts = True does not.

Right now, the notebook server has the option to require email confirmation before logging in -- but you can log in anyway, even before the email has been confirmed. That's the purpose of this ticket. No one will be forced to do anything with email registration / confirmation.

BTW, with this patch, if the admin user adds a user on the "Manage Users" page when "require email" is checked, that user cannot log in until his email is confirmed...and since there's no email associated to the user, it's spectacularly unlikely that the user will ever be able to login.

Also, I don't know how this will work with existing users who have never had their email addresses confirmed. For backwards compatibility, it would be nice if there was some kind of "has_logged_in_at_least_once" boolean that we could test; if the user has already logged in somehow, email confirmation gets bypassed.

Well, there's lots of print statements throughout the code, and I decided to leave those in for reviewing purposes. When I was working on this, I found it very hard to follow the execution path, so I put in lots of "prints" -- it seems like a reviewer would also appreciate the help in seeing what's happening.

After the patch gets a good review, I can add a small remove-all-the-prints patch.

(Although I would like to see the notebook print more information; some kind of verbose logging option would be really useful.)

Please make all the print statements conditional, e.g., write a function

```
   def log_devel(s):
        if VERBOSE: print s
```
and call that function everywhere.    Then make a file-scope variable VERBOSE which is False in your patch.
Explain here (and in a comment) that by setting it to True, the reviewer can enable devel logging.  This'll get
used elsewhere too.
