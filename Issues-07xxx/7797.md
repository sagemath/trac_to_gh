The new aim of this ticket is to add an interface to the [letterplace](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/latest/sing_427.htm#SEC480) component of Singular, that actually goes beyond what Singular offers.

The patch provides

* A new implementation of free algebras with fast arithmetic, but  restricted to weighted homogeneous elements, with positive integral degree weights.
* Degree-wise Gröbner basis computation for twosided weighted homogeneous ideals of free algebras. If a finite complete Gröbner basis exists, it can be computed.
* Normal form computation with respect to such ideals.
* Quotient rings of such ideals

(Note that the original purpose was merely to compute Groebner bases up to a degree bound of two-sided ideals of free algebras, but without normal form computation etc.)

Examples are below, in the comments.

Actually, this doesn't make sense to me:

```python
bck = int(libsingular_options)  
#letter place needs these options
libsingular_options['redTail'] = True
libsingular_options['redSB'] = True
libsingular_options(bck)
```

First bck is stored and then options are changed. So far fine. However, then bck is loaded and thus overwrites the options just set.

What is meant by "Letterplace functionality"? Is it "simply" computing Gröbner basis with degree bound in free associative algebras?

Something that irritates me (and I already asked in the Singular forum) is that I could not find a way to *apply* such Groebner basis, e.g., in order to compute a normal form of an element of the free associative algebra w.r.t. this Gröbner basis. Also I tend to call *basic arithmetic* a funtionality.

OK. *If* I find the time, I'll finish the wrappers that I hacked together yesterday. The new ticket will then provide two alternative implementations of free (associative) algebras.

FYI: As I mentioned in an earlier post, just having a two-sided Gröbner basis is not enough for my envisioned applications. I also need a competitive arithmetic for free associative algebras, normal form computation, and, if possible, ideals in non-commutative rings, and ring quotients.

So, I implemented something from scratch, *not* based on the previous patches. I already got an implementation of free associative algebras based on letterplace (with a dynamic degree bound). For example, computing `(x+y)**20` is 84 times faster than with the old implementation of free algebras.

I also have a base class for left, right and twosided ideals: If R is any ring and L a list of elements, then R*L is a left ideal, L*R a right ideal, and R*L*R a twosided ideal.

Using freegb for the computation of a two-sided Gröbner basis will be straight forward. In addition, Grischa Studzinski and Viktor Levandoskyy provided me with some code for computing normal forms in free algebras, that is supposed to be in a future Singular release. My plan is to back-port it.

And then there's documentation to write...

I have attached a new patch that replaces all previous patches and provides a lot more functionality.

Since I learned much from the previous patches, I hesitate to remove Michael and Burcin from the author list. But perhaps you like to be referee? Then you should move your name into the reviewer field.

**__Technical Remarks__**

`singular_function` is very useful! However, it was impossible to simply call the `freegb.lib` library functions of Singular, since they rely on ring attributes -- but ring attributes have not been wrapped in `libSingular`.

Moreover, it is not a good idea to call the `makeLetterplaceRing` function from Singular and then transform the resulting `RingWrap` into a polynomial ring. It *is* possible -- but the result can not be pickled, since its variable names look like `x(1),y(1),x(2),y(2)` and are thus no valid identifiers.

But it is no problem to create another ring with more sober variable names, and apply the letterplace functions to it. One just needs to work around the attribute tests that these functions do. In fact, these functions do only one thing after the checking, namely a system call. So, I simply did this system calls as well.

In the current release, Singular does provide the Gröbner basis computations in free algebras, but it does *not* provide normal form computations. Grischa Studzinski has send me some code that is supposed to become part of `freegb.lib` -- again, I can not call it directly, but it was fairly straight forward to implement along the lines of Grischa's code.

**__New Features__**

*__Free Algebra constructor as `UniqueFactory`__*

Up to now, the `FreeAlgebra` constructor was based on an incomplete way of caching: When you pickle and unpickle a free algebra, you would not get the same object.

```
# old behaviour
sage: F.<a,b,c> = FreeAlgebra(QQ,3)
sage: loads(dumps(F)) is F
False
```

This is now resolved. Moreover, it is not needed to explicitly provide the number of generators, when it is obvious from the list of names:

```
sage: F.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ)
sage: loads(dumps(F)) is F
True
```

I did one change that may be subject to criticism, and I wouldn't oppose to revert it. A free algebra in one generator is a polynomial ring. So, I return a polynomial ring:

```
sage: FreeAlgebra(QQ,'x')
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

The constructor can now also be asked for a different implementation, as in all examples below.

*__Free Algebra via Letterplace__*

I provide a new implementation of free algebras. It can be constructed as follows:

```
sage: F.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, implementation='letterplace')
sage: F
Free Associative Unital Algebra on 3 generators ('x', 'y', 'z') over Rational Field
```

Due to some shortcomings of Singular's letterplace implementation, unfortunately we need to restrict to homogeneous elements:

```
sage: (x+2*y)^2
x*x + 2*x*y + 2*y*x + 4*y*y
sage: x+0
x
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: Can only add elements of the same degree
```
This is why the new implementation can not yet become the default.

However, the arithmetic in the new implementation is much faster than the old:

```
sage: F.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, implementation='letterplace')
sage: F_old.<a,b,c> = FreeAlgebra(QQ)
sage: timeit('t=(x+y)^15')
5 loops, best of 3: 27.7 ms per loop
sage: timeit('t=(a+b)^15')
sage: %time t=(a+b)^15
CPU times: user 4.51 s, sys: 0.09 s, total: 4.60 s
Wall time: 6.46 s
sage: 4510/27.7
162.815884476534
sage: timeit('t=(x+y)^15')
25 loops, best of 3: 19.7 ms per loop
sage: %time t=(a+b)^15
CPU times: user 2.70 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 2.72 s
Wall time: 2.73 s
sage: 2700/19.7
137.055837563452
```

*__One- and Twosided Ideals of Noncommutative Rings__*

I implemented it in a fairly general way, ideals can be created for any ring:

```
sage: A = SteenrodAlgebra(2)
sage: IL = A*[A.1+A.2,A.1^2]; IL
Left Ideal (Sq(2) + Sq(4), Sq(1,1)) of mod 2 Steenrod algebra
sage: IR = [A.1+A.2,A.1^2]*A; IR
Right Ideal (Sq(2) + Sq(4), Sq(1,1)) of mod 2 Steenrod algebra
sage: IT = A*[A.1+A.2,A.1^2]*A; IT
Twosided Ideal (Sq(2) + Sq(4), Sq(1,1)) of mod 2 Steenrod algebra
```

Note some nastyness: The parent of an ideal still is the "monoid of ideals of a ring". But we actually have no multiplication in the non-commutative setting:

```
sage: IL*IR
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: Can not multiply non-commutative ideals.
```

Of course, in general, we have no way to solve the ideal containment problem. But in free algebras, we have letterplace:

```
sage: I.groebner_basis(degbound=3)
Twosided Ideal (y*y*y - y*y*z + y*z*y - y*z*z, y*y*x + y*y*z + y*z*x + y*z*z, x*y + y*z, x*x - y*x - y*y - y*z) of Free Associative Unital Algebra on 3 generators ('x', 'y', 'z') over Rational Field
sage: (x*y*z*y*x).normal_form(I)
y*z*z*y*z + y*z*z*z*x + y*z*z*z*z
sage: x*y*z*y*x - (x*y*z*y*x).normal_form(I) in I
True
sage: x*I.0-I.1*y+I.0*y in I
True
sage: 1 in I
False
```

*__Quotient Rings__*

Previously, quotient rings have only been available for rings that inherit from the base class of commutative rings. My patch makes them available for all rings, and actually it should work to some extent even for objects that belong to the category `Rings()` but do not inherit from `sage.rings.ring.Ring`.

The requirement is that we mod by an ideal `I` that is *twosided* and that has a method `I.reduce(x)` that returns a normal form of an element `x` with respect to `I`. That requirement holds for ideals of polynomial rings, and also for homogeneous ideals of free associative algebras. In particular:

```
sage: F.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, implementation='letterplace')
sage: I = F*[x*y+y*z,x^2+x*y-y*x-y^2]*F
sage: Q.<a,b,c> = F.quo(I); Q
Quotient of Free Associative Unital Algebra on 3 generators ('x', 'y', 'z') over Rational Field by the ideal (x*y + y*z, x*x + x*y - y*x - y*y)
sage: a*b
-b*c
sage: a^3
-b*c*a - b*c*b - b*c*c
sage: J = Q*[a^3-b^3]*Q
sage: R.<i,j,k> = Q.quo(J); R
Quotient of Free Associative Unital Algebra on 3 generators ('x', 'y', 'z') over Rational Field by the ideal (-y*y*z - y*z*x - 2*y*z*z, x*y + y*z, x*x + x*y - y*x - y*y)
sage: i^3
-j*k*i - j*k*j - j*k*k
sage: j^3
-j*k*i - j*k*j - j*k*k
```

One can also test if the quotient is commutative:

```
sage: Q.is_commutative()
False

**__Miscellaneous__**

I inserted the documentation of the new modules into the reference manual - I think it looks nice, but I guess a referee should double check.

Doc tests pass for me. Thus: Ready for review!!

At least, it enables the following:

Thank you! There is at least one point that should probably be raised on sage-algebra: Is it acceptable that (with my patch) the `FreeAlgebra` constructor returns a polynomial ring when asked for a free algebra with only one generator? 

Mathematically it is correct, but I wonder if that is acceptable in a CAS.

I managed to split my patch. The part concerning "basic implementation of ideals in non-commutative rings" is now at #11068. The new patch is based on top of that.

**__TODO__**

Let the `FreeAlgebra` constructor always return a free algebra, not a polynomial ring.

**__New Feature__**

In addition to what was described in previous comments, my letterplace wrapper can compute *complete* twosided Gröbnerbases by an adaptive algorithm. The idea is simple: If the Gröbner basis is known out to degree `2*d-1`, but the highest degree of its generators is `d`, then the Gröbner basis is complete.

Example:

```
sage: F.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, implementation='letterplace')
sage: I = F*[x*y-y*x,x*z-z*x,y*z-z*y,x^2*y-z^3,x*y^2+z*x^2]*F
sage: I.groebner_basis(Infinity)
Twosided Ideal (z*z*z*y*y + z*z*z*z*x, z*x*x*x + z*z*z*y, y*z - z*y, y*y*x + z*x*x, y*x*x - z*z*z, x*z - z*x, x*y - y*x) of Free Associative Unital Algebra on 3 generators ('x', 'y', 'z') over Rational Field
```

Since the commutators are contained in the ideal, we can verify that result with a commutative Gröbner basis, as follows:

```
sage: P.<c,b,a> = PolynomialRing(QQ,order='neglex')
sage: J = P*[a^2*b-c^3,a*b^2+c*a^2]
sage: J.groebner_basis()
[b*a^2 - c^3, b^2*a + c*a^2, c*a^3 + c^3*b, c^3*b^2 + c^4*a]
```

So, that's a good consistency test.

Actually I am not sure about all dependencies. #11068 should be enough on top of sage-4.7.alpha5. However, here is a full account of the patches that I had applied to sage-4.7.alpha5 before creating the patch here: #10296, #9944, #9138, #9976, #11115, #11068.

In particular, I think the refactoring of rings, quotient rings and non-commutative ideals is successfully solved in #9138 and #11068. Concerning unigenerated free algebras, it seems better to stay in the world of free algebras, rather than returning a polynomial ring. So, we have

```
sage: F.<x> = FreeAlgebra(QQ)
sage: F
Free Algebra on 1 generators (x,) over Rational Field
sage: F.is_commutative()
True
sage: F.<x> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, implementation='letterplace')
sage: F
Free Associative Unital Algebra on 1 generators (x,) over Rational Field
sage: F.is_commutative()
True
```

In principle, it could be reviewed now. But the patch chain in front of it is rather large, and not everything has a positive review, yet.

My next plan: Allow positive integer degree weights on the generators, extending the scope of the letterplace wrapper from homogeneous to weighted homogeneous elements, and allow degree-wise computation of weighted homogeneous Gröbner bases. Note that this goes beyond what is currently implemented in Singular, but it should work using a little hack (slack variables).

Actually, on second thought, it belongs there: I am talking about the two singular_function instances included in the module. The main problem was that singular_function includes the documentation provided by Singular without taking care of formatting -- resulting in numerous errors (e.g., back ticks are misinterpreted as the beginning of Latex expressions, the indentation is handled differently, and so on).

In #11268, I suggest to take care if it by turning the Singular documentation into a verbose code block. With that change, the documentation looks a lot better. I therefore make it a new dependency.

Meanwhile I implemented two other features:

**Uniqueness of parents**

We had

```
sage: F.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: loads(dumps(F)) is F
False
```

I rewrote the `FreeAlgebra` constructor using `UniqueFactory`, so that the answer above becomes `True`.

**Degree weights**

The letterplace implementation in Singular is restricted to homogeneous ideals, and each generator can only have degree 1. With a little hack, I introduced positive integral degree weights for generators, so that we can now do:

```
sage: F.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, implementation='letterplace', degrees=[1,2,3])
sage: I = F*[x*y+z-y*x,x*y*z-x^6+y^3]*F
sage: I.groebner_basis(Infinity)
Twosided Ideal (x*z*z - y*x*x*z - y*x*y*y + y*x*z*x + y*y*y*x + z*x*z + z*y*y - z*z*x, x*y - y*x + z, x*x*x*x*z*y*y + x*x*x*z*y*y*x - x*x*x*z*y*z - x*x*z*y*x*z + x*x*z*y*y*x*x + x*x*z*y*y*y - x*x*z*y*z*x - x*z*y*x*x*z - x*z*y*x*z*x + x*z*y*y*x*x*x + 2*x*z*y*y*y*x - 2*x*z*y*y*z - x*z*y*z*x*x - x*z*y*z*y + y*x*z*x*x*x*x*x - 4*y*x*z*x*x*z - 4*y*x*z*x*z*x + 4*y*x*z*y*x*x*x + 3*y*x*z*y*y*x - 4*y*x*z*y*z + y*y*x*x*x*x*z + y*y*x*x*x*z*x - 3*y*y*x*x*z*x*x - y*y*x*x*z*y + 5*y*y*x*z*x*x*x + 4*y*y*x*z*y*x - 4*y*y*y*x*x*z + 4*y*y*y*x*z*x + 3*y*y*y*y*z + 4*y*y*y*z*x*x + 6*y*y*y*z*y + y*y*z*x*x*x*x + y*y*z*x*z + 7*y*y*z*y*x*x + 7*y*y*z*y*y - 7*y*y*z*z*x - y*z*x*x*x*z - y*z*x*x*z*x + 3*y*z*x*z*x*x + y*z*x*z*y + y*z*y*x*x*x*x - 3*y*z*y*x*z + 7*y*z*y*y*x*x + 3*y*z*y*y*y - 3*y*z*y*z*x - 5*y*z*z*x*x*x - 4*y*z*z*y*x + 4*y*z*z*z - z*y*x*x*x*z - z*y*x*x*z*x - z*y*x*z*x*x - z*y*x*z*y + z*y*y*x*x*x*x - 3*z*y*y*x*z + 3*z*y*y*y*x*x + z*y*y*y*y - 3*z*y*y*z*x - z*y*z*x*x*x - 2*z*y*z*y*x + 2*z*y*z*z - z*z*x*x*x*x*x + 4*z*z*x*x*z + 4*z*z*x*z*x - 4*z*z*y*x*x*x - 3*z*z*y*y*x + 4*z*z*y*z + 4*z*z*z*x*x + 2*z*z*z*y, x*x*x*x*x*z + x*x*x*x*z*x + x*x*x*z*x*x + x*x*z*x*x*x + x*z*x*x*x*x + y*x*z*y - y*y*x*z + y*z*z + z*x*x*x*x*x - z*z*y, x*x*x*x*x*x - y*x*z - y*y*y + z*z) of Free Associative Unital Algebra on 3 generators (x, y, z) over Rational Field
```
This and the possibility to compute a complete Gröbner basis (provided a finite complete Gröbner basis exists) go beyond what is currently in Singular.

The underlying idea of the degree weights is: Introduce a homogenizing variable. By default, it is called `x`, but a different name is chosen if there is a name conflict. Here, it is renamed to `x_`. And then, we represent a generator `z` of degree `d` internally as `z*x_^(d-1)` (of course with non-commutative multiplication).

Hence, the underlying truncated letterplace ring becomes a bit bigger, and in the bigger ring all generators are of degree one. Of course, the additional variable is omitted in the string representation. We have for example

```
sage: z
z
sage: z.degree()
3
sage: z.letterplace_polynomial()
z*x__1*x__2
```

As much as I know, with that approach, Gröbner bases are correctly computed: If in all polynomials each occurrence of `z` is followed by `x_^(d-1)` then all S-polynomials and reductions (computed in the ring with additional generator `x_` and with all generators in degree 1) will have the same property.

I know this is a hack, but I guess it may be useful. It certainly will be usefull for my current project, because I *need* degree weights.

In my application, I also need conversion from graded sub-algebras. Hence, I implemented it in the new patch.

To be precise: If we have free graded algebras A and B in letterplace implementation, then there is a coercion from A to B if and only if there is a coercion from the base ring of A to the base ring of B, and the set of generator names of A is a subset of the generator names of B, and the degrees of equally named generators of A and B are equal.

The coercion is always name and degree preserving.

Example:

```
sage: F.<t,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(ZZ, implementation='letterplace', degrees=[4,2,3])
sage: G = FreeAlgebra(GF(5), implementation='letterplace', names=['x','y','z','t'], degrees=[1,2,3,4])
sage: t*G.0       # indirect doctest
t*x
sage: (t*G.0 + G.1*G.2)*y
y*z*y + t*x*y
```

I see that most (or all?) the errors reported in the log file occur while calling a singular_function. Is it perhaps the case that singular_function is generally problematic on Solaris SPARC? 

Does Letterplace works on Solaris SPARC in Singular? I think I was told that Singular's system function could be a problem -- but Letterplace relies on it, both in Singular and here.

I.e., is the problem on the side of Singular, or of the wrapper?

How can I check?  What commands should I run in Singular to check?

Also, I added #13237 (Upgrade to Singular-3-1-5) as dependency just in case it matters.  My tests on Solaris SPARC were done with the new Singular from #13237.

Hans Schönemann has tested it. He used Singular-3-1-5, or in more detail:

```
Singular for SunOS-5 version 3-1-5 (3150)  Aug 27 2012 19:23:52
with
        factory(@(#) factoryVersion = 3.1.5),libfac(3.1.5,July 2012),
        GMP(4.2),NTL(5.5.2),64bit,static readline,Plural,DBM,
        dynamic modules,dynamic p_Procs,OM_CHECK=0,OM_TRACK=0,random=1346170574
        CC= gcc -m64 -mptr64 -mcpu=ultrasparc3 -O2 -w -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -DNDEBUG -DOM_NDEBUG -DSunOS_5 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H,
        CXX= g++ -m64 -mptr64 -mcpu=ultrasparc3 -O2 -w -fomit-frame-pointer -I.. -I/users/cip/alggeom/hannes/galois64 -pipe -DNDEBUG -DOM_NDEBUG -DSunOS_5 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H (3.3.2)
```

The example worked fine, which indicates that it is a problem with my wrapper. If you want to test it for yourself:

```
LIB "freegb.lib";
ring r = 0,(x,y,z),dp;
int d =4; // degree bound
def R = makeLetterplaceRing(d);
setring R;
ideal I = x(1)*y(2) + y(1)*z(2), x(1)*x(2) + x(1)*y(2) - y(1)*x(2) - y(1)*y(2);
option(redSB); option(redTail);
ideal J = letplaceGBasis(I);
J;
```
The expected result is

```
==> J[1]=x(1)*y(2)+y(1)*z(2)
==> J[2]=x(1)*x(2)-y(1)*x(2)-y(1)*y(2)-y(1)*z(2)
==> J[3]=y(1)*y(2)*y(3)-y(1)*y(2)*z(3)+y(1)*z(2)*y(3)-y(1)*z(2)*z(3)
==> J[4]=y(1)*y(2)*x(3)+y(1)*y(2)*z(3)+y(1)*z(2)*x(3)+y(1)*z(2)*z(3)
==> J[5]=y(1)*z(2)*y(3)*y(4)-y(1)*z(2)*y(3)*z(4)+y(1)*z(2)*z(3)*y(4)-y(1)*z(2\
   )*z(3)*z(4)
==> J[6]=y(1)*z(2)*y(3)*x(4)+y(1)*z(2)*y(3)*z(4)+y(1)*z(2)*z(3)*x(4)+y(1)*z(2\
   )*z(3)*z(4)
==> J[7]=y(1)*y(2)*z(3)*y(4)-y(1)*y(2)*z(3)*z(4)+y(1)*z(2)*z(3)*y(4)-y(1)*z(2\
   )*z(3)*z(4)
==> J[8]=y(1)*y(2)*z(3)*x(4)+y(1)*y(2)*z(3)*z(4)+y(1)*z(2)*z(3)*x(4)+y(1)*z(2\
   )*z(3)*z(4)
```
I will see whether `letplaceGBasis` does anything new - perhaps I can learn from it?

No, the essential part is the same. Namely:

```
  ideal J = system("freegb",I,uptodeg,lV);
```
If I am not mistaken, it is the analogue of this command that fails in my code.

The question that I'd like to be answered is: Are calls to Singular's "system" function possible in Sage on Solaris SPARC? Could you please test the following in Sage on Solaris SPARC?

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.function import singular_function
sage: sing_system = singular_function("system")
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: sing_system("uname", ring=R)
'x86_64-Linux'  # ok, the answer will be different on Solaris SPARC...
```

That test is about an internally used method (note the underscores), and the output depends on a polynomial ring that is used to simulate computations in free associative algebras out to a certain degree. As you can see, the ideal we expect and the ideal we got are alike - only the polynomial rings differ.

The point is that the underlying polynomial ring can change during computations, and the free associative algebras are unique parents. Hence, if tests are executed in different order then it may very well be that the polynomial ring used behind the scenes is different. Only the final result (i.e., interpreted in the free associative algebra) is unique.

I suggest to modify that test (and perhaps others as well) as follows:

```
>     sage: G = F._reductor_(I.gens(),3); G
> Expected:
>     Ideal (x*y_1 + y*z_1, x_1*y_2 + y_1*z_2, x*x_1 + x*y_1 - y*x_1 - y*y_1, x_1*x_2 + x_1*y_2 - y_1*x_2 - y_1*y_2) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z, x_1, y_1, z_1, x_2, y_2, z_2... over Rational Field
```
The variables before the `...` are guaranteed to occur, and we don't know (and don't care) whether more variables appear behind the scenes.

Would you accept that solution?

I think we have already discussed that the order of doctests may influence the size of the polynomial ring used to represent the letterplace elements.

So, the fix should be to have `Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z, x_1, y_1, z_1, x_2, y_2, z_2... over Rational Field`. I'll do so (hopefully) soonish.

I am sorry that I took so long to fix it.

I have changed the "big" patch. The diff of the two patch versions is:

I hope it is ok to restore the positive review, since I assume doctests will be run anyway before releasing.
