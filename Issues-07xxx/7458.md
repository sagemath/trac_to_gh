Small patch to add Sylvester matrix calculation for univariate and multivariate polynomials.

I think that my patch is a bit more general (and has doctests) compared to didier deshommes' patch here, which seems to have never been merged:

Attachment: **[trac-7458-sylvester-rebase-4.6.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7458/trac-7458-sylvester-rebase-4.6.patch.gz)**

This is a very basic feature that has to be in Sage.

I have rebased Carlo patch to 4.6  but have not touched the code.

I have some concerns that makes me mark the patch as needs work:

- The univariate case should accept the same syntax as the multivariate case. In the univariate case, the preferred call is f.sylvester_matrix(g), but I do not want Sage to throw an error if I wrote f.sylvester_matrix(g, x)

- Corner cases must be well documented. 

```
sage: K.<x>=QQ[]
sage: K(1).sylvester_matrix(K(1))
[]
```

In particular, I am not sure how to deal with the sylvester matrix of 0 and constant or 0 and 0
Curretly it throws an error. My opinion is that this is not defined but  should throw a more meaningful error.

Maple for instance return the empty matrix. So in maple:

Determinant(Sylvester_Matrix)  != Resultant 

In this corner cases.

I will  try to check what other CAS do to get a wider picture.

- An example explicitly relating Sylvester matrix and resultant should be added.

- I have added more documentation and doctest.

- The variable argument is now optional in both univariate and multivariate. If it is not used, the first variable of the polynomial ring is used.

- I have added coercion to be able to compute the Sylvester matrix of polynomials in different rings, for ex. ZZ[x] and QQ[x] 

- solved an issue for the dimension of the matrix of the sylvester matrix of (x**n, 0)

It is not ready for review because the sylvester matrix of (0,0) is not implemented.
