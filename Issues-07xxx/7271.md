<a id='comment:5'></a>Hi Mike, sorry for being so brief earlier, I was in a rush.

PolyBoRi calls this function from various functions which are called by the `groebner_basis` function. The ones I could find quickly are:

```
polybori-0.6/pyroot/polybori/rank.py:    return p.lex_lead().variables().next()
polybori-0.6/pyroot/polybori/ll.py:      return Monomial(v).variables().next().index()
polybori-0.6/testsuite/py/parsegat.py:    return p.lead().variables().next()
```

As you can see, it calls next() immediatly on the result of `variables()`. Right now, certain GB computations will fail with an `AttributeError` because of this.

Regarding parsegat, as you can see, I moved a corrected version between our repositories (similar one-liner). But there is no dependency on parsegat.py .
The only funny thing about the recent versions of parsegat.py is that, you
can see a poor mathetician trying to recognize patterns from bad encoded circuits.
I still have nightmares from it.

<a id='comment:12'></a>There are several issues I am aware of with m4ri, which should perhaps be sorted out before code is added that depends on it. 

#7171 - Although reported against HP-UX, this is more serious, as it is broken on Solaris too. 
#7037 - libm4ri thinks the C compiler is broken

I beleive the current version of PolyBoRi might actually build with Sun's compiler, but this would stop that, if it has a dependancy which does not.
