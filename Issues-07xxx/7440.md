I sent this email to sage-devel:

```
Hello,

The valgrind-3.3.1 spkg no longer works with newer Linux installs.
E.g., with Ubuntu-9.10 we get the error:

    configure: error: Valgrind requires glibc version 2.2 - 2.7
    error configuring valgrind 3.3.1

See: http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7440

Unfortunately, Michael Abshoff is the official maintainer of this
spkg.  Can somebody else please volunteer to be the Valgrind spkg
maintainer?  If nobody does, then I'll remove valgrind as an optional
spkg (I'll put it in experimental), at least until I have more time
and maintain it myself.

I tried installing this on Mac OS X 10.6 and got an error during the "configure" process:

```

configure: error: Valgrind works on Darwin 9.x (Mac OS X 10.5)

```
Seems to build correctly on sage.math, for what that's worth.

Once the OS X issue is worked out, other people should definitely look at this; I don't think I'm qualified to review it properly.

This has a portability bug. 'uname' will will called with the '-p' option on any non-Linux system. But '-p' is not a POSIX option for uname. 

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/uname.html

so there is no reason any system should support the -p option. If you need to test the processor type, make sure the test is only done on platforms where you know the -p option is supported. HP-UX is one platform where this will fail, and I expect there are others too. 

```
$ uname -a
HP-UX hpbox B.11.11 U 9000/785 2016698240 unlimited-user license
$ uname -p
uname: illegal option -- p
usage: uname [-amnrsvil] [-S nodename]
```

I do not believe this is a problem, since `uname -p` will only be called on Linux and Darwin platforms because of boolean logic shortcircuiting, e.g.:

```
[timdumol@tim-pc sage]$ if [ -z "" ] && [ -z "`error`" ]; then echo "Success"; fi
bash: error: command not found
Success
[timdumol@tim-pc sage]$ if [ -n "" ] && [ -z "`error`" ]; then echo "Success"; fi
```

    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>\nFirst, merry Christmas to you both. \n\nWilliam asked me the other day to check what optional packages installed on Solaris. Valgind did not install, but did give a helpful error message, indicating why. That's much better than executing a command which will fail. So I believe the fact Valgind does not work on Solaris, AIX, HP-UX etc is a not an excuse for sloppy programming - there is enough of that in Sage anyway!\n\nWilliam's use of:\n\n```\nelif [ `uname` = \"SunOS\" -a \"`uname -p`\" != \"sparc\" ]; then\n```\n\nin an early version of 'prereq' did cause an issue on HP-UX, with the -p option creating problems - see #7156. \n\nTim's version is written slighlty different, using the preffered '&&' instead of '-a'. The use of '-a' is deprecated and discouraged by POSIX\n\nhttp://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/test.html\n\nso perhaps Tim's arugument is valid.

First, merry Christmas to you both. 

William asked me the other day to check what optional packages installed on Solaris. Valgind did not install, but did give a helpful error message, indicating why. That's much better than executing a command which will fail. So I believe the fact Valgind does not work on Solaris, AIX, HP-UX etc is a not an excuse for sloppy programming - there is enough of that in Sage anyway!

William's use of:

```
elif [ `uname` = "SunOS" -a "`uname -p`" != "sparc" ]; then
```

in an early version of 'prereq' did cause an issue on HP-UX, with the -p option creating problems - see #7156. 

Tim's version is written slighlty different, using the preffered '&&' instead of '-a'. The use of '-a' is deprecated and discouraged by POSIX

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/test.html

so perhaps Tim's arugument is valid. On reflection, I agree with Tim. 

However, as my grandmother used to say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so I tested this on HP-UX, where sage-4.2.1 is installed.
