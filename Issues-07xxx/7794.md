The following was reported by Alex P on [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/d92efb12f35e758a):

```

^CException KeyboardInterrupt: KeyboardInterrupt() in 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.get_cparent' ignored
^C^C

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```

So: First, Ctrl-C is ignored, which is bad IMO. Then, hitting Ctrl-C again (actually twice) results in a segfault, which is a desaster.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I just verified that the problem seems to be fixed in sage-4.6.2.

Firstly, the original example now works sufficiently quickly, so that there is no need to interrupt the computation:

```
sage: F.<a> = FiniteField(3)
sage: P.<T> = PolynomialRing(F)
sage: PP.<z> = PolynomialRing(P)
sage: PP
Univariate Polynomial Ring in z over Univariate Polynomial Ring in T over Finite Field of size 3
sage: type(PP)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_integral_domain'>
sage: (z^3 + T*z)^(81*3)
z^729 + T^243*z^243
```

Secondly, if one tries the same thing with a higher exponent, hitting Ctrl-c works (or at least it does after several attempts):

```
sage: (z^3 + T*z)^(81^3)
^C^C^C---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyboardInterrupt                         Traceback (most recent call last)

     11 def my_sigfpe(x, n):

```

So, I believe this ticket can be closed! If I am not mistaken, I first need to put it as "needs review"...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

Since the problem seems to be related with get_cparent, I was first looking into that. There was a bare "except:", where it should be catching an attribute error. But that was not the problem.

Next, I looked into polynomial_template.pxi, where get_cparent is frequently used. Too frequently, actually. In many methods it is called several times. So, it would be better to assign its output to a cdef'd variable -- that would actually boost the speed a lot!

Namely, working on other tickets, I know that the "harmless" method `modulus()` takes the most time when doing arithmetic with polynomials over finite fields. `modulus()` is called in get_cparent (actually, it is called twice!), and get_cparent is called several times in both `_pow_` and `_mul_` (as in polynomial_template.pxi).

So, one approach would be to remove the redundant calls - which makes sense anyway. If that does not help with the segfault, one could still try to wrap it into sig_on()/sig_off().

Hi Jeroen,

Can you give me a pointer to the documentation of the `except? 0` syntax? Sounds useful.

I'll try your patch. I have prepared another patch, with the purpose of reducing the number of calls to get_cparent() (and thus to modulus()). But this will concern performance and should thus be on another ticket.

In the original version of get_cparent, an attribute error was caught internally, and then zero was returned. Now, you return zero on error, and you do not catch the error internally. Couldn't that result in confusion, if the argument `parent` has no `modulus()` method?

Perhaps it is safer to keep modify the internal try-except clause (namely replace the bare `except:` by `except AttributeError:`) and declare the Cython funtion as `cdef inline cparent get_cparent(parent) except -1:`.

Namely, -1 can not result as a regular return value (the return value is the modulus of a ring, and thus a positive number), and so it would be safe to reserve -1 for errors (then you can also remove the question mark from `except?`).

Will you do this change (if you agree with my arguing), or shall I make the change in a separate patch?

        return 0
    try:
        return <unsigned long>(parent.modulus())
    except AttributeError:
        return 0
```

Rationale:

The original code was catching an error that should probably be an attribute error - so, we do the same, and return the same value that was returned by the original version.

But the return value 1 can never occur (which I verified by the doctests of sage/rings/). So, it is safe to reserve 1 as the exceptional value, without question mark after `except`.

However, our two patch versions performed equally when I tried some timings. Hence, unless you say that I convinced you to use 1 as exceptional return value (without question mark), I will give your patch a positive review, provided the doc tests pass.

you are probably right about `except AttributeError`. How about

```

    except AttributeError:

Yes, that looks a bit better. 

Concerning modulus 1:

It is possible to explicitly construct an instance of `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.Polynomial_zmod_flint` whose parent has modulus 1:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring import PolynomialRing_dense_mod_n
sage: P = PolynomialRing_dense_mod_n(Zmod(1),'x')
sage: type(P.0)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.Polynomial_zmod_flint'>
```

So, in order to be on the safe side, one should not have `get_cparent(parent) except 1:`.

One may argue, however, that it can not occur if one constructs a ring as one is supposed to, namely by calling the polynomial ring constructor:

```
sage: P.<x> = Zmod(1)[]
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial_generic_dense'>
```

But better safe than sorry, in particular since your safe solution (`... except? 0:`) should have no serious time penalty.

Namely, as much as I understand, `cdef get_cparent(parent) except? 0:` will slow things down only if the return value is 0, because then it will be tested whether an error has actually occured.

But, to the best of my knowledge, it is *impossible* to have a parent with modulus zero, even if one works around the polynomial ring constructor:

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing_dense_mod_n(ZZ,'x')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: invalid integer: +Infinity
```

So, if one has return value zero then something exceptional must be happening: Either it is a real error, or it is during pickling, when `parent` is None. So, we can certainly afford to test for an error in that situation.

Can you update your patch, so that the attribute error is caught? Then I'll run the tests again, and will hoppefully be able to renew my positive review.

All long tests passed with your new patch.

I tried to add a doc test, as follows:

```
    sage: def test():
    ...    P = GF(3)['T']
    ...    PP = P['z']
    ...    T = P.gen()
    ...    z = PP.gen()
    ...    alarm(1)
    ...    try:
    ...       while(1):
    ...           x = (z**3+T*z)**243
    ...    except KeyboardInterrupt:
    ...       print "First interrupt caught"
    ...    alarm(1)
    ...    try:
    ...        while(1):
    ...            x = (z**3+T*z)**243
    ...    except KeyboardInterrupt:
    ...        print "Second interrupt caught"
    sage: test()
    First interrupt caught
    Second interrupt caught
```

However, it did not work, since there seem to be other places in which errors are not properly caught. Namely, I occasionally got:

```
sage: test()
First interrupt caught
Exception KeyboardInterrupt: KeyboardInterrupt('computation timed out because alarm was set for 1 seconds',) in T^79 + 2*T^78 + 2*T^77 + T^74 ignored
^CSecond interrupt caught
```
So, the first alarm worked, but the second didn't, and only when I pressed <ctrl>-c then the computation was interrupted.

What shall we do now? Clearly, your patch is a progress. So, I tend to give it a positive review (because all tests pass), and deal with the remaining problem on a different ticket.

What do you think?

    PyErr_Fetch(&etype, &eval, &etb);
    ++Py_REFCNT(o);
    __pyx_pf_4sage_5rings_10polynomial_21polynomial_zmod_flint_19Polynomial_template_3__dealloc__(o);
    if (PyErr_Occurred()) PyErr_WriteUnraisable(o);
    --Py_REFCNT(o);
    PyErr_Restore(etype, eval, etb);
  }
  __pyx_ptype_4sage_5rings_10polynomial_18polynomial_element_Polynomial->tp_dealloc(o);
}
```

The problem is the line

```
if (PyErr_Occurred()) PyErr_WriteUnraisable(o);
```
Since this code is generated by Cython, perhaps it is not possible to solve this problem without patching Cython.

I believe the "Exception ignored" to be harmless, in the sense that it's not going to break anything or cause segmentation faults.  If the exception is ignored, the computation simply continues and the user can press ctrl-C a second time and that should do it.

Yes, but it made it impossible for me to create a doctest for your fix!
