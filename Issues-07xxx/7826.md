mpfi like many packages ignores the setting of SAGE64. mpfi clears CFLAGS, so even setting environment variables will not allow this to build. Hence spkg-install needed updating. 

I left some remarks for the package maintainer, on how to get rid of the SAGE64 junk. 

An updated package can be found at the following address. All changes are checked in.

No, I am not allowed to close the ticket, despite the fact I opened it. But I can leave a note for the release manager to close it.

I got told off for doing this this other day (see #8201), though in that case I marked someone elses ticket as "wontfix". 

It was pointed out to me by Alex that the trac guidelines 

http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/TracGuidelines 

do not permit you to close tickets. 

More specifically, the paragraph about closing tickets: "No Closing Or Invalidating: Unless you have admin powers in trac (which includes all the people who have ever done releases of Sage), do not close tickets unless you are explicitly told to do so. Since we have email notification now this has become less of an issue. If you think that a ticket is invalid or has been fixed, just comment on it and the current release manager will take a look and close it if appropriate." 

I'll drop an email on sage-devel and ask someone to close it, or someone might give me permission to close it, in which case I'll do it.
