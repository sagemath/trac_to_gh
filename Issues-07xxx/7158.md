<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

The attached patch, which depends "somewhat" (`twist.py`) on #7110, adds two challenge-response methods for new user registration:

* Simple question and answer, e.g., "How many bits are in one byte?"
* [reCAPTCHA](http://recaptcha.net/).

The code for both is in the new file `sagenb.notebook.challenge.py`.  I've also

* Rewritten `twist.RegistrationPage` for linearity.
* Modified `registration.html` and added the template `recaptcha.html`.
* Added several options to `sagenb.notebook.server_conf.defaults`:

```python
defaults = {
             [...]
             'email': True,
             'challenge': True,
             'challenge_type': 'simple',
#             'challenge_type': 'recaptcha',
             'recaptcha_public_key': '',
             'recaptcha_private_key': '',
            }
```

One way to test the "simple" challenge, after applying the patch:

* Backup `~/.sage`
* Delete `~/.sage`
* `sage`
* `sage: import sagenb.notebook.notebook_object as n; n.notebook(accounts=True)`
* Enter admin's password twice.
* Browse to `http://localhost:8000`
* Log out, if necessary, and click on "Sign up for a new Sage Notebook account".
* Try to sign up for new accounts.

To test the "recaptcha" challenge, [sign up](http://recaptcha.net/whyrecaptcha.html) for a [reCAPTCHA](http://recaptcha.net/) key, update `server_conf.py`, and follow the steps above.

It's critically important that usage of this is documented and that we make a notebook server settings page that can configure all this stuff.  I had no clue how to configure these things, except for the very helpful directions on this trac ticket (which were excellent).
