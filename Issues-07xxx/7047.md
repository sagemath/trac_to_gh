Are you sure this is not an upstream problem? You appear to have set a number of tickets to N/A, but that might not be the case.

I simply modified the descriptions so that tickets would be referenced as "#NNNN" rather than by URL (see: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/a97f1a4473848617). I could not figure out why Trac kept thinking that I set the upstream field, even though I never touched it. My apologies if I ruined something!

The goal of these tickets is laudable, but:

* The package/OS information on this ticket is outdated beyond usefulness.
* Upstream is a better place to report portability issues these days.
