You get those two lines with the exclamation marks because the file
MANIFEST.in in Sage 4.3.alpha0 isn't configured to pick up those two
image files. When ticket #7190 (French translation: A Tour of Sage)
[1] was merged in Sage 4.3.alpha0, the file
devel/sage-main/MANIFEST.in wasn't also changed to take into account
the new image files, so these are not picked up when releasing the
alpha0 tarball. A result is that one would not see the image files in
devel/sage-main/doc/fr/a_tour_of_sage. You can fix the missing files
problem as follows:

[mvngu@sage sage-4.3.alpha0-7473-sphinx]$ cd devel/sage-main/
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg st
! doc/fr/a_tour_of_sage/eigen_plot.png
! doc/fr/a_tour_of_sage/sin_plot.png
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg revert -a
reverting doc/fr/a_tour_of_sage/eigen_plot.png
reverting doc/fr/a_tour_of_sage/sin_plot.png
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg st
<no output>
```
This missing files problem is due to #7190.

Here are some steps to fix the problem with missing image files. On a freshly compiled Sage 4.3.alpha1 or a newly unpacked binary of that version, do a Mercurial revert to recover the deleted images:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.3.alpha1-7606-images]$ cd devel/sage-main/
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg st
! doc/fr/a_tour_of_sage/eigen_plot.png
! doc/fr/a_tour_of_sage/sin_plot.png
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg revert -a
reverting doc/fr/a_tour_of_sage/eigen_plot.png
reverting doc/fr/a_tour_of_sage/sin_plot.png
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg st
<no output>
```
Next, apply the patch `trac_7606-manifest.patch`, which configures MANIFEST.in to pick up those two image files when making a source release. Afterwards, making a source tarball with "./sage -sdist <version-number>" should also pick up the two image files.
