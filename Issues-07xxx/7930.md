The following code

```
E = EllipticCurve('99d1')

R.<X> = QQ[]
K.<t> = NumberField(X^3 + X^2 - 2*X - 1)
L.<s> = NumberField(X^3 + X^2 - 36*X - 4)

EK = E.base_extend(K)
toK = EK.torsion_order()
da = EK.local_data()

EL = E.base_extend(L)
da = EL.local_data()
```

produces a `TypeError`. Having played around with this for hours, I believe that all lines in the above code are necessary to produce the bug. Especially both the torsion and local data computations over another field. I have no idea whatsoever of where to look for the error.
