The following code

```
E = EllipticCurve('99d1')

R.<X> = QQ[]
K.<t> = NumberField(X^3 + X^2 - 2*X - 1)
L.<s> = NumberField(X^3 + X^2 - 36*X - 4)

EK = E.base_extend(K)
toK = EK.torsion_order()
da = EK.local_data()

EL = E.base_extend(L)
da = EL.local_data()
```

produces a `TypeError`. Having played around with this for hours, I believe that all lines in the above code are necessary to produce the bug. Especially both the torsion and local data computations over another field. I have no idea whatsoever of where to look for the error.

  This is very strange. For that curve E2, I sometimes get

  ```
  Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + a*x*y + (a+1)*y = x^3 + (a+1)*x^2 + (12289755603565800754*a-75759141535687466985)*x + (51556320144761417221790307379*a-317814501841918807353201512829) over Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 38
  ```
  but sometimes I get 

  ```
  Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + a*x*y + (a+1)*y = x^3 + (a+1)*x^2 + (368258520200522046806318444*a-2270097978636731786720859345)*x + (8456608930173478039472018047583706316424*a-52130038506793883217874390501829588391299) over Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 38

Almost. Here is a patch that adds the example as a doctest (in a _function so as not to appear in the documentation) to make sure that the bug does not appear again in the future.
Because we are not certain what caused the bug in the first place.
