This animate command shouldn't ignore the options to show() that are passed through by the plot command (here the options are ymin and ymax):

```
sage: var('t')
sage: damped_oscillator = 41/311*sqrt(311)*e^(-3/8*t)*sin(1/8*sqrt(311)*t) + 3*e^(-3/8*t)*cos(1/8*sqrt(311)*t)
sage: animate([plot( lambda x: damped_oscillator( t = x + k ), -1/2, 3*pi, ymin=-2, ymax=3.5 ) for k in srange( 0, pi, 0.3 ) ]).show()
```

Thanks to Johann Myrkraverk Oskarsson for reporting this.

Bill and Karl-Dieter,

You two might be interested in this.  Karl-Dieter, you wrote the original code that passed show options around, I believe.  I just made the consolidation happen in .save() instead of .show().

Here is another effect of this, I think:

```
plot(x,(x,0,1),aspect_ratio=1).save('test.png')
```
does not save a graph with aspect ratio 1.

Isn't it a bug that `save` saves something in some cases when `savenow=False`?..

> Also, this needs a doctest (it's in the original patch) to show that animate options actually work, at least in theory (if one looked at it and ran the optional tests).  So... needs work.  Sorry :(


I added the doctest. Was it the only reason for "needs work" or you would like to have `save` parameters changed as well?

We check that Trac #7981 is fixed::

Hmm, but in many places in this file it says why such things are optional.   In fact, *earlier in the same docstring* the first occurrence of `.show()` explains this:

```
        sage: a.show()          # optional -- requires convert command
```
as well as several lines later

```
        sage: a.show() # optional -- requires convert command
```
so hopefully one wouldn't need to do it a third time in three paragraphs.  Especially since it's a `TEST`.

Also, the actual issue with creating a file I have posted to sage-devel about; it's not 100% clear to me that this is a bug.  It just happened to have a bad effect here, which I changed from Andrey's patch.  But it's orthogonal to the ticket.

So putting back to 'needs review'.  I hope you will agree with me that this is in fact still worthy of positive review.

Now, of course there is in the doctesting framework the issue that one can do optional tests with only certain keywords, so if one has `convert` one could run them with that keyword.  But in that case, the entire file `animate.py` is replete with violations of this, and I feel that should be a separate ticket.

Yes, I am.  This issue is pretty important, and the other issue is somewhat orthogonal.  I've opened another ticket for the issue about the optional keyword - this is now #10655.
