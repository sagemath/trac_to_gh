This animate command shouldn't ignore the options to show() that are passed through by the plot command (here the options are ymin and ymax):

```
sage: var('t')
sage: damped_oscillator = 41/311*sqrt(311)*e^(-3/8*t)*sin(1/8*sqrt(311)*t) + 3*e^(-3/8*t)*cos(1/8*sqrt(311)*t)
sage: animate([plot( lambda x: damped_oscillator( t = x + k ), -1/2, 3*pi, ymin=-2, ymax=3.5 ) for k in srange( 0, pi, 0.3 ) ]).show()
```

Thanks to Johann Myrkraverk Oskarsson for reporting this.

Bill and Karl-Dieter,

You two might be interested in this.  Karl-Dieter, you wrote the original code that passed show options around, I believe.  I just made the consolidation happen in .save() instead of .show().

Sadly it didn't also fix #10244, so I will try to figure that out if I can.

I don't remember exactly what I meant, but probably it was changing parameters of `save`.

I think that it makes the syntax of save cleaner and easier to understand (and document for that matter). As was recently mentioned on sage-devel, one should use common sense when deciding whether to deprecate something or change immediately, I think that these changes fall into the latter category ;-) As for `*args` I just think that it is a bad practice to call functions with 20 or so possible parameters listing them without names.

Isn't it a bug that `save` saves something in some cases when `savenow=False`?..

> Also, this needs a doctest (it's in the original patch) to show that animate options actually work, at least in theory (if one looked at it and ran the optional tests).  So... needs work.  Sorry :(


I added the doctest. Was it the only reason for "needs work" or you would like to have `save` parameters changed as well?

Attachment [trac_7981-reviewer.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket7981/trac_7981-reviewer.patch) by @kcrisman created at 2011-01-17 18:42:01

Just an update - apparently 

```
sage: animate([plot(sin(x + float(k)), (0, 2*pi), ymin=-5, ymax=5)
...            for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.3)]).show() # optional
```
does not obey the optional test, for it created a new file (I must have ImageMagick!).  We don't create non-temp new files in doctests, though, so this had to be changed.  New reviewer patch fixes this as well, maintains positive review.  Should not affect the plot patches which depend on this.

Maybe you should document in the file what you just said in your comment.  Also make it clear why the test is tagged optional.

Hmm, but in many places in this file it says why such things are optional.   In fact, *earlier in the same docstring* the first occurrence of `.show()` explains this:

```
        sage: a.show()          # optional -- requires convert command
```
as well as several lines later

```
        sage: a.show() # optional -- requires convert command
```
so hopefully one wouldn't need to do it a third time in three paragraphs.  Especially since it's a `TEST`.

Also, the actual issue with creating a file I have posted to sage-devel about; it's not 100% clear to me that this is a bug.  It just happened to have a bad effect here, which I changed from Andrey's patch.  But it's orthogonal to the ticket.

So putting back to 'needs review'.  I hope you will agree with me that this is in fact still worthy of positive review.

Now, of course there is in the doctesting framework the issue that one can do optional tests with only certain keywords, so if one has `convert` one could run them with that keyword.  But in that case, the entire file `animate.py` is replete with violations of this, and I feel that should be a separate ticket.

Yes, I am.  This issue is pretty important, and the other issue is somewhat orthogonal.  I've opened another ticket for the issue about the optional keyword - this is now #10655.
