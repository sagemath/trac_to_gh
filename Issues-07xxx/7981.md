This animate command shouldn't ignore the options to show() that are passed through by the plot command (here the options are ymin and ymax):

```
sage: var('t')
sage: damped_oscillator = 41/311*sqrt(311)*e^(-3/8*t)*sin(1/8*sqrt(311)*t) + 3*e^(-3/8*t)*cos(1/8*sqrt(311)*t)
sage: animate([plot( lambda x: damped_oscillator( t = x + k ), -1/2, 3*pi, ymin=-2, ymax=3.5 ) for k in srange( 0, pi, 0.3 ) ]).show()
```

Thanks to Johann Myrkraverk Oskarsson for reporting this.

Since the original patch does not apply cleanly on sage-4.6.alpha1, I posted my patch, but I have incorporated Jason's changes to `show` to eliminate double processing of options.\n\nI have changed call parameters to `save` since it is not documented why one would ever need `savenow=False`. If I want to save later, shouldn't I call `save` later?-) Also it does not make sense in my opinion to use any extra positional arguments in this function except for the file name.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I have just wrote a patch fixing the issue for `save` (which is quite annoying in conjunction with SageTeX) and then found this ticket. Since the original patch does not apply cleanly on sage-4.6.alpha1, I posted my patch, but I have incorporated Jason's changes to `show` to eliminate double processing of options.

I have changed call parameters to `save` since it is not documented why one would ever need `savenow=False`. If I want to save later, shouldn't I call `save` later?-) Also it does not make sense in my opinion to use any extra positional arguments in this function except for the file name. I realize that this is a backward-incompatible change, but all long tests pass with this patch.

Isn't it a bug that `save` saves something in some cases when `savenow=False`?..

I added the doctest. Was it the only reason for "needs work" or you would like to have `save` parameters changed as well?

<a id='comment:23'></a>Hmm, but in many places in this file it says why such things are optional.   In fact, *earlier in the same docstring* the first occurrence of `.show()` explains this:

```
        sage: a.show()          # optional -- requires convert command
```
as well as several lines later

```
        sage: a.show() # optional -- requires convert command
```
so hopefully one wouldn't need to do it a third time in three paragraphs.  Especially since it's a `TEST`.

Personally, I would write it a third time.  On the other hand, I don't care too much.  So if you feel like you're happy with the patch as-is, then that's fine for me.

Yes, I am.  This issue is pretty important, and the other issue is somewhat orthogonal.  I've opened another ticket for the issue about the optional keyword - this is now #10655.
