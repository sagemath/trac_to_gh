This animate command shouldn't ignore the options to show() that are passed through by the plot command (here the options are ymin and ymax):

```
sage: var('t')
sage: damped_oscillator = 41/311*sqrt(311)*e^(-3/8*t)*sin(1/8*sqrt(311)*t) + 3*e^(-3/8*t)*cos(1/8*sqrt(311)*t)
sage: animate([plot( lambda x: damped_oscillator( t = x + k ), -1/2, 3*pi, ymin=-2, ymax=3.5 ) for k in srange( 0, pi, 0.3 ) ]).show()
```

Bill and Karl-Dieter,

You two might be interested in this.  Karl-Dieter, you wrote the original code that passed show options around, I believe.  I just made the consolidation happen in .save() instead of .show().

Here is another effect of this, I think:

```
plot(x,(x,0,1),aspect_ratio=1).save('test.png')
```
does not save a graph with aspect ratio 1.

I think that it makes the syntax of save cleaner and easier to understand (and document for that matter). As was recently mentioned on sage-devel, one should use common sense when deciding whether to deprecate something or change immediately, I think that these changes fall into the latter category ;-) As for `*args` I just think that it is a bad practice to call functions with 20 or so possible parameters listing them without names.

Isn't it a bug that `save` saves something in some cases when `savenow=False`?..

> Also, this needs a doctest (it's in the original patch) to show that animate options actually work, at least in theory (if one looked at it and ran the optional tests).  So... needs work.  Sorry :(

I added the doctest. Was it the only reason for "needs work" or you would like to have `save` parameters changed as well?

There is a trivial error in this patch that however causes it to fail doctests.

```
We check that Trac #7981 is fixed:: 

    sage: animate([plot(sin(x + float(k), (0, 2*pi), ymin=-5, ymax=5)) 
    ...            for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.3)]).show() # optional
```
Notice that there is a parenthesis missing after `float(k)` which instead comes after `ymax=5`.  Patch coming up.

Hmm, but in many places in this file it says why such things are optional.   In fact, *earlier in the same docstring* the first occurrence of `.show()` explains this:

```
        sage: a.show()          # optional -- requires convert command

so hopefully one wouldn't need to do it a third time in three paragraphs.  Especially since it's a `TEST`.

Also, the actual issue with creating a file I have posted to sage-devel about; it's not 100% clear to me that this is a bug.  It just happened to have a bad effect here, which I changed from Andrey's patch.  But it's orthogonal to the ticket.

Personally, I would write it a third time.  On the other hand, I don't care too much.  So if you feel like you're happy with the patch as-is, then that's fine for me.
