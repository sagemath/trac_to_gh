This animate command shouldn't ignore the options to show() that are passed through by the plot command (here the options are ymin and ymax):

```
sage: var('t')
sage: damped_oscillator = 41/311*sqrt(311)*e^(-3/8*t)*sin(1/8*sqrt(311)*t) + 3*e^(-3/8*t)*cos(1/8*sqrt(311)*t)
sage: animate([plot( lambda x: damped_oscillator( t = x + k ), -1/2, 3*pi, ymin=-2, ymax=3.5 ) for k in srange( 0, pi, 0.3 ) ]).show()
```

Thanks to Johann Myrkraverk Oskarsson for reporting this.

Bill and Karl-Dieter,

You two might be interested in this.  Karl-Dieter, you wrote the original code that passed show options around, I believe.  I just made the consolidation happen in .save() instead of .show().

```

This seems to work, and all doctests in the module plot (not just the file) pass.

Sadly it didn't also fix #10244, so I will try to figure that out if I can.

Positive review.

I don't remember exactly what I meant, but probably it was changing parameters of `save`.

> I guess I mean to ask whether this is a good such change; usually there is a deprecation period.  After all, doctests catch very few of our use cases :)  What is wrong with the usual `*args,**kwds` syntax? 

I think that it makes the syntax of save cleaner and easier to understand (and document for that matter). As was recently mentioned on sage-devel, one should use common sense when deciding whether to deprecate something or change immediately, I think that these changes fall into the latter category ;-) As for `*args` I just think that it is a bad practice to call functions with 20 or so possible parameters listing them without names.

Isn't it a bug that `save` saves something in some cases when `savenow=False`?..

> Also, this needs a doctest (it's in the original patch) to show that animate options actually work, at least in theory (if one looked at it and ran the optional tests).  So... needs work.  Sorry :(

I added the doctest. Was it the only reason for "needs work" or you would like to have `save` parameters changed as well?

Yeah, these two make sense.  It looks like dpi will still work, given `SHOW_OPTIONS`.  

>As for `*args` I just think that it is a bad practice to call functions with 20 or so possible parameters listing them without names.

Okay, I see what's going on here now.  Especially since the order would be open to suspicion!

No, just an undocumented feature!  Since it doesn't save a *graphic*.  I agree this seems odd, though, so not complaining.

No, assuming this still applies by the buildbot, and since you've explained the parameter issue fine, that's okay.  The only reason I felt justified in overruling the original positive review was because it didn't actually include the doctest, though I had the other questions as well.

There is a trivial error in this patch that however causes it to fail doctests.

```
We check that Trac #7981 is fixed:: 

    sage: animate([plot(sin(x + float(k), (0, 2*pi), ymin=-5, ymax=5)) 
    ...            for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.3)]).show() # optional
```
Notice that there is a parenthesis missing after `float(k)` which instead comes after `ymax=5`.  Patch coming up.

Hmm, but in many places in this file it says why such things are optional.   In fact, *earlier in the same docstring* the first occurrence of `.show()` explains this:

```
        sage: a.show()          # optional -- requires convert command
```
as well as several lines later

```
        sage: a.show() # optional -- requires convert command
```
so hopefully one wouldn't need to do it a third time in three paragraphs.  Especially since it's a `TEST`.

Also, the actual issue with creating a file I have posted to sage-devel about; it's not 100% clear to me that this is a bug.  It just happened to have a bad effect here, which I changed from Andrey's patch.  But it's orthogonal to the ticket.

Now, of course there is in the doctesting framework the issue that one can do optional tests with only certain keywords, so if one has `convert` one could run them with that keyword.  But in that case, the entire file `animate.py` is replete with violations of this, and I feel that should be a separate ticket.
