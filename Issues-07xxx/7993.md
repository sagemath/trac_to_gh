When doctesting a file `a.sage` containing

```
def foo():
    """
    sage: 1+1
   2
    """
    pass
```

(note the missing space before the 2), you get:

```
[wjp@issa sage-4.3.1.rc0]$ ./sage -t a.sage
sage -t  "a.sage"                                           
A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
         [2.4 s]
exit code: 768
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "a.sage"
Total time for all tests: 2.4 seconds
```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I changed the `sage-doctest` script to make the actual doctesting process catch exceptions and communicate this to `sage-doctest` via the process exit code.

It now differentiates between a crash and an exception raised by the doctesting code.


This patch depends on the patch at #7995.

As for #7995: thanks much for handling this. I'd love to see this in Sage very shortly.

Please include the new output in the ticket description!

I can try to review this, but I'd rather have a testing framework expert to it.

I noticed an existing, unrelated problem.  Let `foo.py` contain

```python
def g():
    """
    sage: 1 + 1

    return

Then `sage -tp 1 foo.py` ends with

For whitespace errors, see the file /home/.sage//tmp/.doctest_foo.py

Anyway, we can make a separate ticket to unify, simplify, and *doctest* the doctesting framework.

I'm not an expert, but the changes look OK.  Can we report at least partial results for interrupted tests?

That's strange; the same command works for me in a clean 4.3.3.
Do you have any other patches applied to the scripts repo? (I don't think branching will affect that repo.) You can check with hg_scripts.status() and hg_scripts.log().

Yes, it does look like it. I don't think `sage -clone` touches the scripts repository, but only the main sage library.

with the patch, we now get with the initial example:

```
tarte% sage -t a.sage
sage -t  "a.sage"                                           
Exception raised by doctesting framework. Use -verbose for details.
         [1.4 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "a.sage" # Exception from doctest framework
Total time for all tests: 1.4 seconds
```
and the whole doctest still produces 22 Segfaults (see #7773). However, instead of say:

```
sage -t  tests/benchmark.py
A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed d\
octest.
         [62.3 s]
```
we now get:

```
sage -t  tests/benchmark.py
The doctested process was killed by signal 14
         [62.5 s]
```
which is more informative. I thus give a positive review.
