From [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/9fba0850f4211fd9):

```
As you mentioned, the documentation instructed 
me that arctan2(y,x)=arctan(y/x) and so I thought that arctan2(0,x) 
would always equal 0. 
```

Could you add backslashes to "pi" so that it prints well in LaTeX ? :-)

Once this is done, this patch can be set to "positive review"

Thank you !!!
