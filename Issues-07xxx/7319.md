On Cywgin, the gdmodule spkg requires libiconv.  I think we have two choices for handling this:

1. Making sure that libiconv is always installed in the system Cygwin environment.  We can probably have control over this if we include the Cygwin install with Sage.

2. Add a libiconv spkg that is only installed if we are in Cygwin.  Note that this would probably amount to including it in all source tarballs.

Once libiconv is present, we need to patch Setup.py in gdmodule to add libiconv to the list of required libraries.

I'll put up an spkg for libiconv and gdmodule here shortly.

Note, SPKG.txt has:

### gdmodule-0.56.p5 (Mike Hansen, October 27th, 2009)
* Make gdmodule work on Cygwin.

### gdmodule-0.56.p5 (Michael Abshoff)
* add .hgignore, SPKG.txt
* clean up patches directory
* build gdmodule against libpng12 instead of libpng (#5289)

with no entry for a p6 or p7. So this needs a bit of work, but even then, I'm unable to test on Cygwin, so you would need another reviewer too.
