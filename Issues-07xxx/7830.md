Here's a function that answers the question posed in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/c8c75b483f2c47f6 -- give the sign, mantissa, and exponent of a floating point number.

I also cleaned up a few minor other things.

The mantissa and exponent for MPFR is not the same as the mantissa and exponent for IEEE 754.  So I'm a little doubtful about the choice to follow IEEE 754 conventions for the exponent value of 0.  (but I'm not doubtful enough to change it).  I just thought I'd point out that the values from MPFR are different than the conventions from IEEE 754 for the same floating point number.
