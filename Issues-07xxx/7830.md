Here's a function that answers the question posed in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/c8c75b483f2c47f6 -- give the sign, mantissa, and exponent of a floating point number.

I also cleaned up a few minor other things.

The exponent for 0 should be 0. This also avoids the issue of platform dependance for that value, and `RDF(0)`'s exponent being unrealistically small. 

Also, sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx, line 1890 should be EXAMPLES::
