Here's a function that answers the question posed in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/c8c75b483f2c47f6 -- give the sign, mantissa, and exponent of a floating point number.

I also cleaned up a few minor other things.

parts() seems too vague.  Maybe ieee_754_parts(), except that we support arbitrary precision, not just the set precisions they mention.  Maybe floating_point_representation(), or sign_mantissa_exponent().

I'm willing to concede on the naming to make sure this gets in before I start my numerical analysis class in two weeks :).

The exponent for 0 should be 0. This also avoids the issue of platform dependance for that value, and `RDF(0)`'s exponent being unrealistically small. 

Also, sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx, line 1890 should be EXAMPLES::
