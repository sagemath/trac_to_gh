MPIR is supposed to be a substitute for GMP. When using the Sun compiler with sage-4.1.2.alpha2, givaro-3.2.13rc2 seems to think GMP is not installed, even though the substitute mpir is installed. See below. 

It works on Solaris if gcc is used, which is a bit odd. I checked to see if the mpir had created the header files and libraries, and see that local/include/gmp.h and local/lib/libgmp.* do in fact exist, so mpir really has been installed.
