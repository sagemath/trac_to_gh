```
The attached patch implements unit groups for finite fields.  It is 
modelled on John Cremona's code for the unit groups of number fields.  One 
difference is that if F is a finite field,  while F.unit_group() yields 
the group of units (just as for a number field), F.unit_group(n) gives the 
group of n-th roots of unity.

I have designated it as "needs work" for two reasons:

1.  Both pieces of code deserve generalising to more general rings.  In
particular, Rob Beezer has
[expressed](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/4f903f830aed653d) 
a need to have the group of units of the integers modulo n.

2.  There are certain aspects of the notation/terminology/implementation
that I am not totally happy with.  Maybe `F.unit_group(n)` is not such a
good idea.  Also it seems
odd that one has

```
sage: F.<g> = FiniteField(16)
sage: UF = F.unit_group()
sage: UF.gen()
g
sage: g in UF
True
```
but

```
sage: UF(g)
u
sage: UF(1 + g + g^3)
u^7
```
It's similar for number fields:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 39*x - 91)
sage: UK = K.unit_group()
sage: UK.gens()
[-1, a^2 - 4*a - 22, a + 3]
sage: UK(a + 3)
u2
```
Note also that `UF(UF(g))` and `UK(UK(a + 3))` both lead to errors.

Deciding how to be more consistent probably needs to be done at a more
general level and will most likely best be done by introducing a class
`UnitGroupElement` based (for commutative rings anyway) on
`AbelianGroupElement`, something that has been avoided in the finite field
and number field cases.

When I implemented that for number fields I ran into these issues.  Initially I tried to construct a UnitGroupElement but gave up -- the problem I faced was the underlying AbelianGroup class, and that has not (yet) improved.

Concerning `(Z/nZ)^*`, note that this is implemented over number fields (by me and Maite) using pari functions for that, including generalised discrete logs.  Sage already has Integers(n).unit_group_gens() using some native code; it could also use pari.

- [Ask Sage question 42726: Multiplicative group of a field](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42726)

Francis or John, would you turn the patch into a branch?

The group of roots of unity could be for another ticket
if that is the blocking point.
