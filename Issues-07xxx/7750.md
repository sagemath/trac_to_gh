If you call search_doc and one piece of the Sage docs are missing, this patch prints the following warning (and then proceeds with the search):

```
sage: search_doc('factorial')
Warning, the following Sage documentation hasn't been built,
so documentation search results may be incomplete:

/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/output/html/fr/tutorial

You can build this with 'sage -docbuild fr/tutorial html'.
```
If more than one piece is missing, it prints this warning:

```
sage: search_doc('factorial')
Warning, the following Sage documentation hasn't been built,
so documentation search results may be incomplete:

/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/developer
/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/installation
/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/output/html/fr/tutorial

You can build these with 'sage -docbuild DOCUMENT html',
where DOCUMENT is one of 'developer', 'installation', 'fr/tutorial', 
or you can use 'sage -docbuild all html' to build all of the missing documentation.
```
You can test this by installing the patch and selectively deleting and building pieces of the documentation.  You don't need to restart Sage between deletions or builds -- do that in another window, and each call to search_doc will check for existence of the docs each time.

There are no doctests for this, because I think that doctests should assume that the Sage build is complete: all documentation should be assumed to be built.
