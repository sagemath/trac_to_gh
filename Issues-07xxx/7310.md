Version 7:

* Updates a few JS functions per [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) in "The Good Parts" mode.
* Includes `farbtastic.min.js`, `jquery.event.extendedclick.min.js`, and `jquery.form.min.js`, all made with the [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/) 2.4.2:

```
java -jar yuicompressor-2.4.2.jar foo.js > foo.min.js
```
* Uses `src="/javascript/jquery/plugins/jquery.bgiframe.min.js"` consistently.

To the extent it counts, my review is positive.
