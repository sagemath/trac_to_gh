There are several problems in the Flint spkg-install and makefile which prevent it building 64-bit on any platform other than OS X. Apart from the usual changes of adding -m64 to CFLAGS, the makefile has previously been changed to make it work on OS X. However, it does not work on Open Solaris in 64-bit mode, as the -m64 flag is not being added where it should be.

Not only does it work on Open Solaris on x86 hardware, but I just tried for the first time to build a 64-bit version of Sage on a Sun Blade 2000 with a pair of UltraSPARC III+ CPUs running Solaris 10. This was based on the 4.3.1.alpha2 source code, but with this patch added. There are warnings issued during the 64-bit SPARC build that there are no 64-bit assembly routines, so C is used. But apart from that, Flint is now at least building on:

* 32-bit Solaris 10 SPARC 
* 64-bit Solaris 10 SPARC
* 64-bit Open Solaris x86
