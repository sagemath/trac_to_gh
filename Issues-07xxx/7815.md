There are several problems in the Flint spkg-install and makefile which prevent it building 64-bit on any platform other than OS X. Apart from the usual changes of adding -m64 to CFLAGS, the makefile has previously been changed to make it work on OS X. However, it does not work on Open Solaris in 64-bit mode, as the -m64 flag is not being added where it should be.

The changes have been checked in with 'hg'
