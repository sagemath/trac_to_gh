There are several problems in the Flint spkg-install and makefile which prevent it building 64-bit on any platform other than OS X. Apart from the usual changes of adding -m64 to CFLAGS, the makefile has previously been changed to make it work on OS X. However, it does not work on Open Solaris in 64-bit mode, as the -m64 flag is not being added where it should be.

Here's an updated spkg which corrects the faults. It essentially does that by adding the environment variable CXXFLAG64 to the Makefile. This will add -m64 whenever SAGE64 is set to yes. If you look at the makefile you will see -m64 has been hard-coded when building the library on OS X, but not for other platforms. 

The changes have been checked in with 'hg'
