Mercurial no longer has an hgmerge script.  This if one does 

```
sage: install_scripts('/usr/local/bin/')
```
with sage right now then very bad things happen.  For starters, you get an hgmerge script that hangs, which means any time any file ever gets merged with mercurial, instead of getting a merge option, you get a hang.  Pretty confusing.
