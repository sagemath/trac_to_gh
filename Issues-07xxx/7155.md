From a Maxima FAQ:

```
(%i1) load(fourier_elim)$

(%i2) fourier_elim([abs(x - abs(5-x)) < 1],[x]);
(%o2)                          [2<x,x<3]

(%i3) fourier_elim([x + y < 1, x - y > 9],[x,y]);
(%o3)                     [y+9<x,x<1-y,y<-4]

(%i4) fourier_elim([max(-x,x) < 7 * x + 1],[x]);
(%o4)                           [-1/8<x]
```
From pre-release codebase:

```
 (%i79) to_poly_solve((x-1)*(x-6) < 0,x);
 (%o79) %union([1 < x,x < 6])

 (%i80) to_poly_solve(min(x,1) < max(-5,x),x);
 (%o80) %union([1 < x],[x < -5])

 (%i81) to_poly_solve(min(x,1) # max(x,4),x);
 (%o81) %union([1 < x,x < 4],[4 < x],[x = 1],[x < 1],[x = 4])

 (%i82)  to_poly_solve((x+1)/(x-1) < 4,x);
 (%o82) %union([5/3 < x],[x < 1])
```
So it should not be too hard to wrap this, checking input/output for < or > or something.   This is one of those basic things people want, but which we assume it's too hard to write from scratch (which it probably is!).

kcrisman, please don't close tickets. That's the job of the release manager.  See [this section](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/trac.html#closing-tickets) of the Developer's Guide for conventions on closing tickets.
