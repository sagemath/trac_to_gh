line 364 of `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-ptest` is where to start looking:

```
    if len(failed) == 0:
        if interrupt == False:
            print "All tests passed!"
        else:
            print "Keyboard Interrupt: All tests that ran passed."
        #Only update timings if we are doing something standard
        if opts=="-long" or len(opts)==0:
            with open(time_file_name,"w") as time_file:
                pickle.dump(time_dict, time_file)
                print "Timings have been updated."
    else:
        if interrupt:
            print "Keyboard Interrupt, not all tests ran"
        print "\nThe following tests failed:\n"
        for i in range(len(failed)):
               print "\t", failed[i]
        print "-"*int(70)
```

The reason I want this is that if you're making lots of changes and testing frequently, and you never get a completely clean run, all the good files still run in a random order, which is inefficient.

<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
Works as expected.  Removed timings, introduced a doctest that would fail.

Ran `sage  -tp 2  -long devel/sage/sage/graphs/`

twice, and repeated experiment without -long argument.

In both cases, second run obviously employed timings.

Positive review.
