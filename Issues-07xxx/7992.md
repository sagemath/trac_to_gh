Patch attached.  As far as I can see this message does not appear in a doctest.  Which means that I should add a doctest for it, hence not ready for review yet.

New patch adds doctest (one showing failure and one ok).

I don't know why the output of the RuntimeError does not include the string (the one where the typo was fixed).  Maybe the review does?
