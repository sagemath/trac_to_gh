Attachment [trac_7992-typo.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7992/trac_7992-typo.2.patch) by @JohnCremona created at 2010-01-19 09:38:00

New patch adds doctest (one showing failure and one ok).

I don't know why the output of the RuntimeError does not include the string (the one where the typo was fixed).  Maybe the review does?
