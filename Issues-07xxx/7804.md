Hello !!

This patches moves the files mip_coin and mip_glpk to Sage. They are currently included in the packages CBC and GLPK and are a lot harder to work on because of this.

This patch copies them in sage/numerical/ and adds several lines to modules_list so that they will only be compiled if the corresponding packages are installed.

For the moment, the copies of these files included in the packages will not be removed, in order to preserve backward-compatibility : the users of earlier versions of Sage will then be able to keep using the same packages. 

*Only the changes to file modules_list need to be reviewed -- mip_coin and mip_glpk are copies of what is included in the spkg and have already been checked ! This should be a short review :-) *

I just modified it so that it is now independent from the huge changes going on in graph.py. Would it be possible to have this merged to the next release ? It would let me write another speed-up patch now that solve_glpk and solve_cbc are available ;-)

Do you want to make a separate ticket for making some doctests here, or would you prefer it if I just pull the patch back out?
