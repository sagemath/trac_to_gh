nice
[10:29pm] amhou:
not sure how to get past the importing into global namespace
[10:29pm] amhou:
because we definitely don't want that
[10:30pm] amhou:
but if I define within the functions, then the stuff called outside of the functions doesn't work
[10:30pm] amhou:
:-/
[10:30pm] williamstein:
Robert Bradshaw came up with some new clever, clever code to uniformly deal with this problem.
[10:30pm] williamstein:
I'll ping him.

In this case, I think what you want is http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0369/

I'm not sure about using IntVector, as it will silently truncate all non-integer lists...

```
sage: list(rpy2.robjects.IntVector([1,1/2,pi]))
[1, 0, 3]
