The package installs and the check runs fine. I got a couple of warnings from the BioSQL test but that seems to be expected if I understand the code. 

One small thing: The changes haven't been committed to the hg depository in the package. Otherwise, it looks good to me.

Thanks for the quick review.  I commited the changes in hg, and removed a couple of .DS_Store files that my mac had added.  This new package is up at the same link above.
