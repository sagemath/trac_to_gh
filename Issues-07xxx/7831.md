Just noting here that although this was the Sage version, Numpy upstream still has the special FreeBSD code, [here as of June 2012](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/distutils/system_info.py#L972), so the patch definitely hasn't been applied.  My sense is that probably the R upgrades over the years is what made this obsolete.

So I'm putting this to positive review as it builds (and so does R) and passes the overwhelming majority of tests on FreeBSD 8 and 9, but leaving this info here in case in certain unusual cases this ends up being a problem after all.
