We probably want to return an inverse function, if possible, when n<0... I'm also wondering if there is a generalisation of this to all real numbers.

I think the most important thing though is to implement something with a clear interface and definition now and get it into sage. Then we can make it faster whenever we want.

I this case it should not be too different from these few lines ( if I make none of my usual mistakes )

```
if n==0:
    return "identity function"( no idea how it is called in Sage )

if n%2 == 1:
    ff = compose(f, (n-1)/2, a)
    return f(ff(ff(a)))
else:
    ff = compose(f, n/2, a)
    return ff(ff(a))
```

But perhaps the function "compose" should be a method of these symbolic callable expressions you mentionned, which would be called by this "compose" function : it may be interesting to compute symbolically the n^th composed of a function without evaluating it  :-)

I have two comments: (1) the patch contains twice the new function, and (2) it would be nice to
be able to write `compose(f,x,n)` for a symbolic variable n (or any expression). Only when
n is an integer would the "nesting" be evaluated. Comment (1) needs more work, comment (2) could
be a separate ticket, but if easy it would be nice to do it.

Additional comment: please rename the patch as trac_7742.patch.

<a id='comment:12'></a>
The new patch addresses many of the above concerns (other than symbolic n), and splits the functionality into three functions:

* compose(f,g) which composes functions such that compose(f,g)(x) = f(g(x))

* self_compose(f, n) which composes a function with itself such that self_compose(f,n)(x) = f(...(f(x))...)

* nest(f, n, a) which effectively self_composes and evaluates (but does it slightly faster than a self_compose)

Questions:

* compose(f,g)(x) = f(g(x)) - is this the most common convention among mathematicians? or should the RHS be g(f(x))?

* Is (f, n, a) or (f, a, n) the best order of parameters for nest?

* Is there somewhere more suitable than misc/misc.py for these functions?

compose(f,g) seems good to me.

I prefer (f,n,a) since this is coherent with `self_compose(f,n)`.

I don't know.

I don't actually know anything about symbolic functions in Sage.  As such, all doctests and examples in the patch are for regular python functions not symbolic functions.  The compose functions in the patch use lambda functions, which may or may not break symbolic functions.

With normal python functions (such as those in the doctest), the powers-of-two provides a major speedup for large n over the other techniques I tried, both for the function composition and for the evaluation of the resulting function (benchmarked using "timeit").  In fact, without a powers-of-two-type algorithm, the self_compose function regularly hit the recursion limit and crashed for large n (above 500 or 1000).  But I don't know if anyone is interested in large n cases.

I ran the following:

```
sage: def f(x):
....:     return x + 1
....: 
sage: g = self_compose(f,10000)
sage: g
<function <lambda> at 0xb0aa80c>
sage: timeit('g(0)')
25 loops, best of 3: 9.41 ms per loop
sage: timeit('nest(f,10000,0)')
125 loops, best of 3: 6.35 ms per loop
```
Since nest just loops through xrange and doesn't use powers of two, maybe the slowdown before was due to the recursion.  But in any case, it definitely helps with the symbolic ones.

I'm attaching a patch to check for symbolic functions and (hopefully) do the right thing.  I also make self_compose(f,0) return the identity.

```
sage: f(x) = x+1
sage: g(y) = y+1
sage: compose(f,g)
y + 2
sage: compose(g,f)
x + 2
```

[please use { { { and } } } to quote Sage examples]

I can't reproduce this. I get with the patch from Felix:

```
sage: f(x) = x+1
sage: g(y) = y+1
sage: compose(f,g)
<function <lambda> at 0x1787c80>
sage: compose(f,g)(x)
x + 2
```
which seems ok to me.

I am not very happy with the fact that when f is an expression, the code assumes it has exactly
one symbolic variable:

```
sage: f = 2
sage: self_compose(f,0)
<function <lambda> at 0x41031b8>
sage: self_compose(f,1)
2
sage: self_compose(f,2)
<function <lambda> at 0x7fa8ac2b0d70>
```
or

```
sage: f = x+y
sage: self_compose(f,0)
x
sage: self_compose(f,1)
x + y
sage: self_compose(f,2)
x + 2*y
```
Consider also:

```
sage: f = pi+1
sage: self_compose(f,0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    912         if type(f) == sage.symbolic.expression.Expression:

    914         else:
    915             return lambda x: x

```

I would prefer that symbolic expressions such as `f=x+1` are not allowed,
and we should write instead `f(x)=x+1` or `f = lambda x : x+1`.

I now think it's best to leave compose,self_compose, and nest agnostic to the type of f; the user can supply anything callable and we won't attempt to turn it back into a symbolic function.

Then as a separate issue, symbolic functions can grow an f.self_compose(n) function that plays nice with types.

But I don't know if anyone is interested in large n cases.

With normal python functions, I don't think there is any gain from powers of two.

With the self_compose from adds-compose-etc.patch:

```
sage: f = lambda x: x + 1
sage: g = x + 1
sage: f1 = self_compose(f,10000)
sage: g1 = self_compose(g,10000)
sage: timeit('self_compose(f,10000)')
625 loops, best of 3: 66.6 µs per loop
sage: timeit('self_compose(g,10000)')
625 loops, best of 3: 66.9 µs per loop
sage: timeit('f1(0)')                
25 loops, best of 3: 9.32 ms per loop
sage: timeit('g1(0)')
5 loops, best of 3: 375 ms per loop
sage: timeit('nest(f,10000,0)')
125 loops, best of 3: 6.46 ms per loop
sage: timeit('nest(g,10000,0)')
5 loops, best of 3: 379 ms per loop
sage: def new_self_compose(f,n):
....:     return lambda a: nest(f,n,a)
....: 
sage: timeit('new_self_compose(f,10000)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.17 µs per loop
sage: timeit('new_self_compose(g,10000)')
625 loops, best of 3: 2.68 µs per loop
```

Since self_compose is implemented via `lambda x: f(g(x))`, we have to eventually pass the argument through `f` the correct number of times.

Let's move the powers of two, and the symbolics handling, into a method of symbolic functions.  Then the compose tools for python functions can have fast, dirt-simple implementations.

Yes, `nest` is always faster than `self_compose` if you actually want to evaluate the function.  However the functions do different things: `nest` isn't really a compose function, since it returns f^n(x) not f^n.  `self_compose` is more useful than `nest` if you want to forget about f and only want to apply `f^n`.  In hindsight, `self_compose` should actually look like this, which I agree would be faster to construct and to evaluate than the powers of two method:

```

def self_compose(f,n):
    return lambda x: nest(f,n,x)
``` 
> Let's move the powers of two, and the symbolics handling, into a method of symbolic functions.  Then the compose tools for python functions can have fast, dirt-simple implementations.

I agree that we should scrap the powers of two, and not go out of our way to support symbolics in this ticket.  I'm uploading a patch that makes the change detailed above.  I'm not going to have any more time to work on this for at least a month, so someone else will have to finish the ticket if further changes are required.

The new patch works for n = 0, but still does not check whether n is symbolic.  I don't think this is the worst thing in the world: the documentation does state that n should be a nonnegative integer, and if it is symbolic then the error raised is appropriate IMO:

Replying to [zimmerma](#comment%3A35):
> does anybody know why this patch with positive review was not included in 4.6.1?

I know because I was the one making that decision.

Most likely, the 4.6.1 release cycle was in bug-fix-only status at the time when this patch got positive_review.  Unfortunately, 4.6.1 stayed in that status for quite a while (much longer than usual Sage releases) because there were a lot of changes in the Sage build scripts giving rise to many system-specific issues which had to be tracked down.

Replying to [zimmerma](#comment%3A39):
> a minor point: it would be good to check that n is indeed a nonnegative integer in
> `self_compose` and `nest`, otherwise we can get strange results

Done:

```
sage: self_compose(sin, -3)
...
ValueError: n must be a nonnegative integer, not -3.
sage: self_compose(sin, x)
...
TypeError: n (=x) must be of type (<type 'int'>, <type 'long'>, <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>).
```
