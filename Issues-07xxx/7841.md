The attached patch defines a new class Polynomial_ZZ_pEX via templating (uses polynomial_template.pxi).

This class should be used for polynomials over GF(p^k) with p>NTL_SP_BOUND.
For smaller values of p, we should wrap NTL's lzz_pEX which is not done yet at all.

For the record, some comparisons:

I think that this is a good idea.

The patch applies fine to 4.3, and the tests in sage/libs/ntl and sage/rings/polynomial pass.

I would like someone who has more experience in cython & wrapping C++ to look at this too.  Meanwhile, I see that most functions do not have INPUT or OUTPUT blocks (though they do mostly have EXAMPLES), and these should be added.  Put yourself in the position of someone else a year or two in the future trying to debug something subtle -- they will need to have all the details!

Anyway, I left it is "needs review" in the hope that someone else will take a look at the code too.

I just lazily adapted the files for GF2X. But I admit it's not perfect.

The patch is updated, it now makes NTL the default implementation.
sage -testall -long without finishes without any failures.

The doc is still minimal though.

Thanks a lot for looking at this. I've done almost all the requested changes, except:

> * `Polynomial_template.__init__` calls `Polynomial.__init__`: you shouldn't duplicate this earlier in your `__init__` function.

It's not duplicated. When I call it, the method returns before calling `Polynomial_template.__init__`

> * `_cmp_c_impl` (...) It's also probably better to do this by defining celement_cmp in the linkage file.

I know it's quite ugly, but I need to compare the elements of the finite field with the Sage implementation. I don't know how to handle this inside celement_cmp. If you have an idea, please do it and I would be happy to review your patch.
