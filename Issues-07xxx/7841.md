The attached patch defines a new class Polynomial_ZZ_pEX via templating (uses polynomial_template.pxi).

This class should be used for polynomials over GF(p^k) with p>NTL_SP_BOUND.
For smaller values of p, we should wrap NTL's lzz_pEX which is not done yet at all.

For the record, some comparisons:

I think that this is a good idea.

The patch applies fine to 4.3, and the tests in sage/libs/ntl and sage/rings/polynomial pass.

I would like someone who has more experience in cython & wrapping C++ to look at this too.  Meanwhile, I see that most functions do not have INPUT or OUTPUT blocks (though they do mostly have EXAMPLES), and these should be added.  Put yourself in the position of someone else a year or two in the future trying to debug something subtle -- they will need to have all the details!

Anyway, I left it is "needs review" in the hope that someone else will take a look at the code too.

Thanks for looking at this!

I just lazily adapted the files for GF2X. But I admit it's not perfect.

Looks good.  Here are some comments.  After a few changes, I'll be happy to give this a positive review.


* sage/libs/ntl/ntl_ZZ_pEX_linkage.pxi
  * Update the copyright to include a year and name.  You may just want to copy the header from another file and edit to change details.
  * There's a strange indentation in `celement_pow` on the `ZZ_pEX_LeftShift` line.

* sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py
  * `__modulus`: if you're going to access it outside the class use one underscore.  That way you don't have to use name mangling.

* sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_zz_pex.pyx
  * Add a copyright and short docstring at the top of the file.
  * In `__init__` documentation, `GF(2) -> GF(p^n)`
  * Use `e = K.coerce(e)` rather than `e = K._coerce_(e)`
  * `Polynomial_template.__init__` calls `Polynomial.__init__`: you shouldn't duplicate this earlier in your `__init__` function.
  * In `__getitem__`, get rid of the second return line 
  * In `__call__`, why use coerce(K,a) and not K.coerce(a)?  It seems to work, but I can't find where coerce is defined.  Also, it's generally not a good idea to catch everything.  Presumably you want to catch `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `NotImplementedError`.
  * In resultant, if you're going to coerce anyway, why use cython to enforce the type of other?  Just use `parent()` instead of `_parent`.  Again, use `self._parent.coerce(other)` not `self._parent._coerce_(other)`.

Thanks a lot for looking at this. I've done almost all the requested changes, except:

> * `Polynomial_template.__init__` calls `Polynomial.__init__`: you shouldn't duplicate this earlier in your `__init__` function.

It's not duplicated. When I call it, the method returns before calling `Polynomial_template.__init__`

> * `_cmp_c_impl` (...) It's also probably better to do this by defining celement_cmp in the linkage file.

I know it's quite ugly, but I need to compare the elements of the finite field with the Sage implementation. I don't know how to handle this inside celement_cmp. If you have an idea, please do it and I would be happy to review your patch.

Looks good.  I think it's possible to do _cmp_c_impl within the linkage file, but don't worry about it.

All tests pass.
