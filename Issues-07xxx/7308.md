The section where SAGESOFLAGS are set assumes that the operating system is Linux, OS X, or Solaris.  The spkg-install script exits even if SAGE_PORT is set to yes.

I'm not in a position to test this, but if you need to make any changes, I would suggest the following would be helpful. Some are I admit code I introduced, which is probaby not necessary. None are particularly important. 

* There is no longer any need to have 

```
if [ -n "$SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB" ] && [ ! -e "$SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB" ]; then
    echo "SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB is defined as $SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB, but does not exist"
    exit 1
fi
``` 
since code in the recent *prereq-0.4* (#7021) script checks this, so the above code is redundant. 

* There is no need to have the following line

` if [ "x$SAGE64" = "xyes" ] || [ "x$SAGE64" = "x1" ]; then `

It should instead be replaced by

   ` if [ "x$SAGE64" = "xyes" ]; then `

since some earlier code in the *prereq-0.3* script written by William only allows SAGE64 to be unset, or set to *yes* or *no*. It is not possible to set it to *1*, so there is no point testing if it is *1*. The same behaviour is followed in my recent updated to prereq-0.4 (#7021) and also to prereq-0.5 which I have awaiting review (#7352)

* There is no need to have 

  ```
    # We exit here, since we are possibly on an unsupported platform.
    if [ -n "${SAGE_PORT:-x}" ]; then
        echo "Cannot determine your platform or it is not supported... exiting"
        exit 1
    else
  ```
since the recent *prereq-0.4* update will exit for **all** unsupported platforms unless SAGE_PORT is set to 'yes'.
