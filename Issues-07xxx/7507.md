Robert Dodier's comments:

```
I'm guessing that Sage punts to Maxima for this stuff.
For better or worse (mostly worse) there are different ways
to declare & undeclare stuff in Maxima.
For the "odd" declaration, it's declare(n, odd) and remove(n, odd).
I guess assume(n, 'odd') was translated to declare(n, odd) but
forget(n, 'odd') was not translated to remove(n, odd).
I don't know much about Sage so I could be way off here.

Yes, this was fixed as part of #1163, as it turns out.

```

    for x in preprocess_assumptions(args):
        if isinstance(x, (tuple, list)):
            forget(*x)
```
used to have

```

    for x in preprocess_assumptions(args):
        if isinstance(x, (tuple, list)):
            assume(*x)
```
before that patch.
