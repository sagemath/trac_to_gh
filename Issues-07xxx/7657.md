The problem is that in `check_comp` we have

```
C = self.__queue[0]
<a few things>
try:
    output_status = S.output_status()
except RuntimeError, msg:
    verbose("Computation was interrupted or failed. Restarting.\n%s" % msg) 
    self.__comp_is_running = False
    self.start_next_comp()
    return 'w', C
out = self.postprocess_output(output_status.output, C)
```
which is where the exception is raised, but this `_before_preparse` is only defined in `start_next_comp`, which *also* does

```
C = self.__queue[0]
<a lot of stuff getting the input>
self.sage().execute(input, os.path.abspath(self.data_directory()))
```
So if a worksheet cell is updated in `sagenb/flask_version/worksheet.py` and 

```
@worksheet_command('cell_update')
def worksheet_cell_update(worksheet):
    <stuff>
    worksheet.check_comp()
    <lots more>
     # Compute 'em, if we got 'em.
    worksheet.start_next_comp()
```
or if somehow in the code above the computation is interrupted but the same cell is enqueued, this kind of race condition could occur.  I'd recommend either enqueuing a lot of cells at once, or interrupting and restarting a lot of cells, to replicate this - which could be hard.

ancient ticket about deprecated sagenb, can we close ?

There are still many such tickets, seen by clicking on the "notebook" component link.
