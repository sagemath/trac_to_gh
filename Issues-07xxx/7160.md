I think this is confusing:  you have an ordering of elements of a real or imaginary quadratic field which is based on some kind of lexicographic ordering on the representation of the elements rather than anything mathematical.  Presumably this is so lists, etc, can be sorted in a pythonic way.  But I find this bizarre:

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: i>0
True
```
and this raises a strange error:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+x-10)
sage: a < -a

1. Typo: " comparision" in sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element_quadratic.pyx. 

2. This code raises a big red flag for me:

```
        1704	                from sage.rings.all import RR 
 	1705	                r = RR(right) 
 	1706	                l = RR(embedding(left)) 
 	1707	                return cmp(l, r) 
```
My concern is that you're comparing to double (=53 bits) precision, which is totally arbitrary.  What if there is an embedding and cmp(left, right) requires 54 bits of precision to sort out?  I could probably with some work construct a nasty example of this, where the above code just gives totally the wrong answer.   I guess we need to (1) compute to precision of the embedding, and (2) if cmp(l,r)==0, then check something more?

3. Where is "self._element_class" actually used?  I guess by the coercion model, but it's hard to see how from this patch, exactly. 

4. I feel like this is too much code that gets around a fundamental problem or bug in number field elements in the case of the reported problem, but leaves the underlying bug unfixed.  Note that *before* applying your patch:

```
sage: bool(I^2 < 0)
True
sage: (I^2).pyobject() < 0
False
```

It seems to me that the output of both lines above should be the same, right, but I bet pynac is evaluating the first comparison and not even going to the pyobject level. Similarly:

```
sage: bool(I^2 < SR(0))
True
sage: (I^2).pyobject() < SR(0).pyobject()
False
```

This is because in Sage we currently have:

```
sage: K.<I> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: I^2 < 0
False
sage: I^2
-1
```
This is, as Cremona pointed out, due to the arbitrary lexicographic ordering rather than using the one we get on the intersection of K and R inside embedding(K). 

So... it seems to me that the real problem is that the arbitrary ordering is lame.   What you've done is implemented a natural fix in one very, very special case.  Maybe that's the intention, and maybe you had something more general before?  I don't know, since you changed the patch. 

I'm guessing your more general patch changed comparison for all elements to:
  (1) check if there is an embedding of the parent(s), and (2) if so, use that to induce an embedding on *the* real subfield of the field(s).   That would be natural. 

So all of the above, is just me understanding why you are doing what you're doing.  It might make sense to add something like this to the documentation.

> 4. I feel like this is too much code that gets around a fundamental problem or bug in number field elements in the case of the reported problem, but leaves the underlying bug unfixed.  Note that *before* applying your patch:


 ```
  sage: bool(I^2 < 0)
  True
  sage: (I^2).pyobject() < 0
  False
   ```
>

The first comparison is done in the `test_relation()` method of `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression`. This converts both sides of the relation to `CIF` and performs the comparison there.

Note that this lame ordering is causing problems all over symbolics since `is_positive()` checks fail. See #10849, #10062, #10064 for examples.

I attached a new patch at [attachment:trac_7160-quadratic_number_field_element_comparison.patch,](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7160/8b44a421920c535b21a64d670f051ba7.patch,) based on Mike's last patch [attachment:trac_7160.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7160/trac_7160.patch)This changes the comparison function of quadratic number field elements to always use the embedding into `CC`.

Timings with the patch:

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: t = K.random_element(); t
-2*sqrt2 - 35
sage: u = K.random_element(); u
-1
sage: %timeit res = cmp(t,u)
625 loops, best of 3: 659 µs per loop
sage: u = K.random_element(); u
-2*sqrt2 - 1
sage: %timeit res = cmp(t,u)
625 loops, best of 3: 807 µs per loop
```

Without the patch:

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: t = -2*sqrt2 - 35
sage: u = K(-1)
sage: %timeit res = cmp(t,u)
625 loops, best of 3: 419 ns per loop
sage: u = -2*sqrt2 - 1
sage: %timeit res = cmp(t,u)
625 loops, best of 3: 419 ns per loop
```

So there is a significant slow down.

There are two failing doctests I need help with:

Hi,

I made a sort of duplicate with #13213. My aim was to use the natural order of RR in the case of real embedding. For quadratic field it is quite easy and fast. In the same patch, I aim to implement other functions related to the real embedding (is_positive, floor, ceil, abs, ...).

On the other hand, the difference of timings with my patch have an order of magnitude of x10 and not of x1000.

Should I close my ticket ? What to do with my patch ?

Hi Vincent,

thanks a lot for taking a look at this long standing problem.

Replying to [vdelecroix](#comment%3A18):

Fixing the comparison of quadratic number fields elements and implementing `floor`, `ceil`, etc. should be in separate patches.

Since your patch performs much better, we can move ahead using that. I will try to review your patch on #13213.

Once the patches in this ticket are rebased on your patch, we can close this as a duplicate.
