Here's an attempt.  If init.sage isn't present, then run the script "sage-starts".  I think this makes all of the appropriate subdirectories of .sage.  In any case, it seems to fix the problem for me.

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
Calling "make ptestlong" (as suggested in ticket #7079), we already call "sage-starts", as this is a part of the TESTPRELIMS in the makefile.

So the test case(s) for this ticket seems to be for directly calling "sage -tp .." from the commandline.

I don't understand the intention of the attached patch, however. If I delete the file "./sage/init.sage" and then call "sage -tp ...", the file would have been created anew before the patch, but *not* after the patch. Even if I delete the whole ".sage" directory, this file will not be recreated (after the patch).

Is it possible that the creation of "init.sage" (which should exist at least as an empty file IIRC) somehow originally did cause the problems?

Another thought: Might the presence (or not ...) of these infamous ".DS_Store" files (Mac OS X only, there's an open ticket to remove them IIRC) break the parallel building, causing somehow these "mysterious memory failures"?

I don't think the ".DS_Store" files have anything to do it: I can recreate this problem on sage.math by deleting my .sage directory and then doing "sage -tp 4 devel/sage/sage/algebras", for example.

As far as I could tell, the presence (or lack) of init.sage was unrelated to the problem, so it wasn't in the patch.  I'm attaching a new patch which puts those lines back, just in case.  This patch runs "sage-starts" at the beginning no matter what: a few extra seconds to run this shouldn't be a big deal.

This seems logical, the patch causes no harm, seems like a good idea, is eloquent.

I don't know if it fixes the "mysterious error" issue, since I couldn't cause that error to occur.  However, I can understand in theory how it could fix that.  Positive review.
