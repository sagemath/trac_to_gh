In order to use Maxima as a library via ECL, we need to have maxima as a lisp library rather than a stand-alone executable.

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nbruin/maxima-5.19.1.p1.spkg

implements this change. With this package properly installed, one can have the following session:

After loading up #6781, I try to sage -f this package.    All seems well until the actual build process, which returns a typically enigmatic response 

```
Summary:
ECL enabled. Executable name: "ecl"
default lisp: ecl
wish executable name: "wish"
Now building maxima; this takes a few minutes
Since we're using OS X and there is a very weird
bug with buffered output while building maxima,
you will not be able to see the output of the build
as it occurs.  Don't worry, the build process did
not hang.

```
which really, according to spkg-install, just means

```
check_error "Failed to make Maxima." 
```
Which could be any kind of error.  And oddly,

```
So apparently nothing "bad" happens to the current Maxima executable, and perhaps this is completely unrelated to the spkg.  However, I get the same thing once I try to revert to the previous spkg, and in general even removing ecl.so doesn't fix this; Maxima stays working within Sage, but I cannot get Maxima to rebuild.  Could this have something to do with #6781?

So needless to say, I don't think the script gets to the library Maxima, and I can't load it:

In the above transcript, the fact that (require 'maxima) fails indeed indicates that the install failed. The other attempts to load maxima fail because the library "maxima.fas" now gets installed in a different place.

If you take a look at the patch that was made to spkg-install,
you can see that the four lines added can't possibly lead to
maxima failing so badly. One guess I can make is that I packaged the spkg in the wrong way (I actually followed the instructions in spkg-dist!). The resulting spkg is quite a bit smaller than "p0" that Ghitza provided, so perhaps maxima automake files got deleted by that script?

To test this hypothesis:
- Unpack the original maxima spkg (or install with -s)
- apply the attached patch, or paste in the relevant lines into spkg-install
- install again

If that works, then one should probably just repackage the spkg. Otherwise, I don't know what the problem is.

Is the .fas file what we typically use, though?  My sense is that it's /local/lib/maxima/5.19.1/binary-ecl/maxima.

I guess what I meant was that Maxima still works as an executable within Sage.

Yes, I noticed that.  Of course, Maxima itself isn't failing per se...

That seems very likely; the size should be exactly the same, one would think.

Unfortunately, although repackaging it did seem to solve the size issue, I still get the same error as above.  In particular, I get the following in a different log:

```
;;; Note: Creating tag: "_eclLn4HfWn8_QUH5U1z" for #P"binary-ecl/maxima-package.o"
;;; Internal error: Unable to find include directory
;      - Binary file binary-ecl/maxima-package.fas is old or does not exist. 
;        Compile (and load) source file /Users/.../sage-4.2/spkg/build/maxima-5.19.1.p1/src/src/maxima-package.lisp instead? y
;      - Should I bother you if this happens again? y
;      - Compiling source file

;      - Loading binary file "binary-ecl/maxima-package.fas"  
```
So it's not finding that even upon normal building.   Is the .fas file what we typically use, though?  My sense is that it's /local/lib/maxima/5.19.1/binary-ecl/maxima.  I don't know that the automake message is as important, as apparently there is a Maxima executable still there:

Ticket #6781 does not touch anything that can influence maxima's build.

I think the problem is in spkg-dist, which SPKG.txt instructs you to run prior to packaging the spkg:

```
for X in ['es', 'es.utf8', 'pt', 'pt.utf8', 'pt_BR', 'pt_BR.utf8']:
    cmd('rm -rf "src/doc/info/%s/"*'%X)
    open('src/doc/info/%s/Makefile.in'%X,'w').write('all:\n\tls\n\n')
```

This must delete some files that were "automake" generated. The build process of Maxima detects that, tries to run automake, bails on a wrong version number, and the spkg install fails. This problem had nothing to do with the patch, but everything with the instructions on how to build a new spkg. Anyone with experience with the maxima spkg interested in weighing in?

An updated Maxima spkg is available at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/maxima-5.19.1.p2.spkg

I have built Sage 4.3.alpha0 from scratch with that package. The compilation process went OK on the following platforms:

* sage.math --- Ubuntu 8.04.3 LTS. All doctests pass, except the known failure with the Maxima interface.
* rosemary.math --- Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 5.4. All doctests pass, except the known failure with the Maxima interface.
* bsd.math --- Mac OS X 10.6.2. Numerous doctest failures as expected as this platform is not yet completely supported.

After the build and doctests, you could run ECL and using Maxima as a library. Do either "./sage -ecl" or from a Sage command line session, do "!ecl":

```

So by this stage, Maxima can be built as a Lisp library. I'm doing more build/tests on other Linux boxes.
