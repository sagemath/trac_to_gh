As the title says, there are many places where Graph.vertices() is used when Graph.vertex_iterator ( or even self ) would be better. The same goes for edges.

As long as you provide a good reason to close the ticket. Don't just close a ticket without any good reasons.

Sorry for commenting a closed ticket, but...

If I look at the docstring for `vertices` I see (in the default case):

```
return sorted(list(self.vertex_iterator()))
```

A new list is created, doubling the memory needed, and this list is sorted which might take time too.

I still think it might make sense to replace `vertices` with `vertex_iterator` when possible.
