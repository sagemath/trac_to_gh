I gather ratpoints is causing problems with it wanting a very recent version of gcc, where here is another issue. Even if the variable CC is set to the Sun compiler, ratpoints ignores that and simply uses gcc anyway. 

The build of ratpoints was attempted using 

* Solaris 10 update 7 on SPARC
* sage-4.1.2.alpha2
* Sun Studio 12.1
* An updated configure script to allow the Sun compiler to be used #7021 

So it seems there are two at least two issues to resolve in ratpoints.
