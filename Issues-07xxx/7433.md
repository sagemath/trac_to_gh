This is a really weird bug. 

1. Create a worksheet W and publish it to make a published worksheet P.  Do *not* check "Automatically re-publish when changes are made". 

2. Change the title of W and something in the body of W.  Notice that in the list of published worksheets the title of P doesn't change.  However, click on P in that list, and notice that the title *does* change at the top of the worksheet.  The body doesn't change, fortunately.

This works fine for me and fixes the problem. 

I haven't verified that the selenium tests work, since I can't run Selenium yet on my OS X computer. 

Note that the patch needed to be rebased for me, so I've posted a rebased patch.
