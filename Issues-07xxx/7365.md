As the docstring says :

Petersen's 2-factor decomposition theorem asserts that any
`2r`-regular graph `G` can be decomposed into 2-factors.
Equivalently, it means that the edges of any `2r`-regular
graphs can be partitionned in `r` sets `C_1,\dots,C_r` such
that for all `i`, the set `C_i` is a disjoint union of cycles
( a 2-regular graph ).

As any graph of maximal degree `\Delta` can be completed into
a regular graph of degree `2\lceil\frac\Delta 2\rceil`, this
result also means that the edges of any graph of degree `\Delta`
can be partitionned in `r=2\lceil\frac\Delta 2\rceil` sets
`C_1,\dots,C_r` such that for all `i`, the set `C_i` is a
graph of maximal degree 2 ( a disjoint union of paths
and cycles ).

If you're introducing a new module in sage.graphs, the header of the file should be much more descriptive of what the module is for, etc... Take a look at some of the other files for examples.

I'm (personally) very curious about what else you plan on including in `graph_decompositions`...

The patch applies cleanly, and the code looks good. Once again, I'd like to see a little more examples in the documentation.

Hello !!!

As mentionned, I moved this function toward graph.py, and will patiently wait for the splitting of graph.py to begin creating new files.. :-)

(please do not forget to install GLPK or CBC before testing it because of #7734)
