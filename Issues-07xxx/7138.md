Using

* A Sun Blade 2000 running Solaris 10 update 7
* Sage 4.1.2.rc0
* gcc 4.4.1
* SAGE64 exported to "yes" 

Looking at the directory $SAGE_HOME/local/lib, we can see the *freetype* libraries are 32-bit, even though SAGE64 was set to "yes"

```
drkirkby@swan:[~/sage/gcc64-sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/lib] $ file libfreetype*
libfreetype.a:  current ar archive, not a dynamic executable or shared object
libfreetype.la: commands text
libfreetype.so: ELF 32-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARC32PLUS Version 1, V8+ Required, dynamically linked, not stripped
libfreetype.so.6:       ELF 32-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARC32PLUS Version 1, V8+ Required, dynamically linked, not stripped
libfreetype.so.6.3.16:  ELF 32-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARC32PLUS Version 1, V8+ Required, dynamically linked, not stripped

```
This is far from the only package building 32-bit when SAGE64 is set to "yes" on Solaris. All of the following do, and I suspect there are many others too.

* zlib #7128
* libgpg_error #7129
* libpng #7130
* libcliquer #7131
* pari #7133
* ntl #7134
* python #7135
* gp #7136 
* ratpoints #7137

mpir currently mixes 32 and 64-bit objects, so does not build at all #7132.

I will sort this package out after creating a new sage-env, which exports all the variables properly, including the flag for building 64-bit code, which is not always -m64.

Although there is no support for AIX or HP-UX in Sage yet, we could potentially add it - I personally own machines running AIX and HP-UX.

IBM's compiler on AIX uses -q64, and HP's on HP-UX uses +DD64.

The sensible way to resolve this is to add the correct flag on every platform. This is not a very difficult task really. Whilst any changes to the source that might be necessary for a port would take a lot of time, finding the right flags to build with should be quite easy.

Looks ok for me. Tested on Open Solaris 0906 64 bit and Fedora 12.

I think SPKG.txt needs work, that can be done later by the official maintainer :)

Positive review.

I really mean SPKG.txt as it is not conform the rules!

William is the maintainer so he will make the changes sometime.

spkg-install is ok withe me.
