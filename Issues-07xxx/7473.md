According to its documentation, `shutil.copytree` is very similar to `cp -pr`.  But their results aren't identical, it seems.

I don't know if `cp -pr` is cross-platform.

#7407 provides the following link, saying that it describes the only options to "cp" which should be used:

[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cp.html](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cp.html)

Reading this, I wonder if we should use "cp -pR" instead of "cp -pr".

I made a new clone, applied the patch, built the documentation, and then made another clone.  The new cloning process took 2-3 minutes on my iMac running OS X 10.6, and when done the documentation did not need to be rebuilt again.  On sage.math, the same thing happened, with the cloning process taking about the same amount of time.  In both cases, updating the modification times was quick.  Also in both cases, using "cp -pR" worked just as well as "cp -pr".

Shall we take the cited web page as enough evidence that this is cross-platform?  And should we change "r" to "R"?

I'm happy with it (Mac OS X 10.6 and sage.math).

On what other platforms does it need to be tested?

I tried it on my Fedora ( built from sources ) and it applies fine and does its job ( I'm not stuck anymore when cloning ) !

( Even though I can not control your script as I have no idea of how Sage works at this level... ) :-)

Thank you for your patch !!!

I tried sage -combinat install (which calls clone), and it worked smoothly (ubuntu 9.4, sage 4.2.1, macbook pro)!
