According to its documentation, `shutil.copytree` is very similar to `cp -pr`.  But their results aren't identical, it seems.

I don't know if `cp -pr` is cross-platform.

#7407 provides the following link, saying that it describes the only options to "cp" which should be used:

[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cp.html](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cp.html)

Reading this, I wonder if we should use "cp -pR" instead of "cp -pr".

I made a new clone, applied the patch, built the documentation, and then made another clone.  The new cloning process took 2-3 minutes on my iMac running OS X 10.6, and when done the documentation did not need to be rebuilt again.

Also in both cases, using "cp -pR" worked just as well as "cp -pr".

Shall we take the cited web page as enough evidence that this is cross-platform?  And should we change "r" to "R"?

nthiery, ncohen:  If you have a chance, could you let us know if the patches above work?  In particular,

* Apply [attachment: trac_7473-sage_builder.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7473/trac_7473-sage_builder.patch.gz) to the sage repository.
* Apply [attachment: trac_7473-scripts_clone_v3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7473/trac_7473-scripts_clone_v3.patch.gz) to the scripts repository.

If this is yet another false positive, I apologize.

I'm happy with it (Mac OS X 10.6 and sage.math).

On what other platforms does it need to be tested?

I tried it on my Fedora ( built from sources ) and it applies fine and does its job ( I'm not stuck anymore when cloning ) !

( Even though I can not control your script as I have no idea of how Sage works at this level... ) :-)

Thank you for your patch !!!

I tried sage -combinat install (which calls clone), and it worked smoothly (ubuntu 9.4, sage 4.2.1, macbook pro)!
