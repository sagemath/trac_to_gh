I *think* the [attachment:trac_7473-scripts_clone.patch attached patch] for the scripts repository prevents the hang when cloning.  The [attachment:trac_7473-sage_builder.patch sage repository patch] should ensure that we usually keep just one copy of the reference manual's `environment.pickle`.

But I'm still not sure about how to avoid rebuilding nearly all of the manual when cloning or after trivially switching branches.  The latter may be a separate problem.

Version 2 of the scripts repo (i.e., `sage-clone`) patch uses `cp -pr` instead of [shutil.copytree](http://docs.python.org/library/shutil.html#shutil.copytree) to copy the auto-generated .rst files.  Could someone please test this and the sage repo patch?  It appears to prevent the hang and unnecessary rebuilds of the reference manual on sage.math.

According to its documentation, `shutil.copytree` is very similar to `cp -pr`.  But their results aren't identical, it seems.

I don't know if `cp -pr` is cross-platform.

#7407 provides the following link, saying that it describes the only options to "cp" which should be used:

[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cp.html](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cp.html)

Reading this, I wonder if we should use "cp -pR" instead of "cp -pr".

I made a new clone, applied the patch, built the documentation, and then made another clone.  The new cloning process took 2-3 minutes on my iMac running OS X 10.6, and when done the documentation did not need to be rebuilt again.
