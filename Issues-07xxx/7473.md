I *think* the [attachment:trac_7473-scripts_clone.patch attached patch] for the scripts repository prevents the hang when cloning.  The [attachment:trac_7473-sage_builder.patch sage repository patch] should ensure that we usually keep just one copy of the reference manual's `environment.pickle`.

But I'm still not sure about how to avoid rebuilding nearly all of the manual when cloning or after trivially switching branches.  The latter may be a separate problem.

According to its documentation, `shutil.copytree` is very similar to `cp -pr`.  But their results aren't identical, it seems.

I don't know if `cp -pr` is cross-platform.

#7407 provides the following link, saying that it describes the only options to "cp" which should be used:

[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cp.html](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cp.html)

Reading this, I wonder if we should use "cp -pR" instead of "cp -pr".

I made a new clone, applied the patch, built the documentation, and then made another clone.  The new cloning process took 2-3 minutes on my iMac running OS X 10.6, and when done the documentation did not need to be rebuilt again.

I tried it on my Fedora ( built from sources ) and it applies fine and does its job ( I'm not stuck anymore when cloning ) !

( Even though I can not control your script as I have no idea of how Sage works at this level... ) :-)
