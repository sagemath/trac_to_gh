With this patch, all parents and elements can inherit code from categories, even extension types. This includes in particular
generic tests (see TestSuite(...).run()):

```
sage: ZZ.category()
Category of commutative rings
sage: TestSuite(ZZ).run(verbose = True)
running ._test_additive_associativity() . . . pass
running ._test_an_element() . . . pass
running ._test_associativity() . . . pass
running ._test_element_pickling() . . . pass
running ._test_not_implemented_methods() . . . pass
running ._test_one() . . . pass
running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
running ._test_prod() . . . pass
running ._test_some_elements() . . . pass
running ._test_zero() . . . pass
```

It is to be expected that this will catch bugs in many places in the library. To start with, see #7922, #7929, #7945, #7946

See patch description for details.

All tests seem to pass with it on 4.3; I still need to double check a couple things. It does change things in many places; so the best would be to integrate it in the early phase of 4.3.2 before it rots away.

Early feedback welcome!

The attribute lookup code looks good. Most of the other changes are minor, though changing loads/dumps to running tests is an independent change is seems. 

sage/groups/group.pyx

```
    def __call__(self, x): # NT: doesn't this get in the way of the coercion mechanism? 
```

Groups are not yet converted over to the new coercion model, and are a mess in general. 

In sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py, you removed the method but kept the docstring floating there. Those tests should be kept, but probably not put there. 

sage/modules/free_module.py - It'd be good to test the category of non-vector space.

Could you explain the changes to sage/structure/sage_object.pyx?

Shouldn't this def be removed, so as not to prevent groups inheriting from Group to progressively get converted to the coercion model? Sure, that should be a separate patch.

Well, I actually only added 2/3 of them, mostly as an attempt to catch possible introduced issues. The others were already there, and needed to be updated due to all the new (often failing) tests coming from categories.

Ok. Shouldn't this def be removed, so as not to prevent groups inheriting from Group to progressively get converted to the coercion model? Sure, that should be a separate patch. As for the comment above: I just can't prevent myself from adding comments in the code when I stumble on strange stuff. I can remove it if you prefer.

Oops, fixed.

Done.

> Could you explain the changes to sage/structure/sage_object.pyx?


I improved the description on top of the patch, including a comment about this.

I have a question regarding this old ticket. The following fails:

```
sage: a = ModularForms(11,4).an_element()
sage: a._test_category()
```
The reason for this is that `a` is not an extension class so `_test_category` expects that the type of `a` inherits from `a.parent().category().element_class`. Now if I try to do such inheritance

```
class HeckeModuleElement(sage.modules.module_element.ModuleElement, HeckeModules.element_class):
```
I get a

```
metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its base
```

Anyway, I'm getting the feeling that such inheritance does not happen anywhere (partly because most element classes are extension classes). The methods from the element_class are available anyway (just like for extension classes). So is it safe to remove this check from `_test_category`? I.e. should we change

```
if not is_extension_type(self.__class__):
    # For usual Python classes, that should be done with
    # standard inheritance
    tester.assert_(isinstance(self, self.parent().category().element_class))
else:
    # For extension types we just check that inheritance
    # occurs on a dummy attribute of Sets().ElementMethods
    tester.assert_(hasattr(self, "_dummy_attribute"))
```
into

```
    tester.assert_(hasattr(self, "_dummy_attribute"))
```

If it's not an extension type, it really should inherit `a.parent().category().element_class`.
Except in complicated cases (e.g. parents whose elements can belong to
several classes), this is taken care of automatically if a category is specified to
`Parent.__init__`; otherwise one needs to use manually
`_make_element_class`. See sage.categories.primer (better with #10963 applied) and the
documentation of Category for details.

Most likely the issue here is that the category is not specified
properly.

> Anyway, I'm getting the feeling that such inheritance does not happen anywhere (partly because most element classes are extension classes).


Most of my bread and butter element classes are *not* extension
classes :-) Just for one example:

```
sage: x = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3]).an_element()
sage: x.__class__
<class 'sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModule_with_category.element_class'>
sage: x.__class__.__bases__
(sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModuleElement,
 sage.categories.vector_spaces.VectorSpaces.WithBasis.element_class)
```

> So is it safe to remove this check from `_test_category`?


Please don't: so far failures here have always pointed to actual bugs.

Cheers,
                            Nicolas
