This is from the "report a problem" link in the notebook:

If you have a vector space, that is a quotient of a subspace of
another vector space, then after coercing elements into it, something
goes wrong in (un)pickling it.

```
sage: V = VectorSpace(QQ, 2)
sage: W = V.subspace([V([1,1])])
sage: Z = W.subspace([])
sage: WmodZ = W / Z
sage: WmodZ(W(0))
(0)
sage: loads(dumps(WmodZ))

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

If I understand the patch correctly, it violates a very essential assumption about hash codes: The hash has to be the same for objects that are equal. But with the patch, it may be possible that during unpickling the hash "0" is returned,  while afterwards a completely different value is returned for *the same* object.

This is giving me headache. Isn't it be possible that things are put in the wrong hash bucket?

Wouldn't it be a cleaner solution to ensure that self.!__basis is defined during unpickling before the hash is requested?

Could you explain why your solution is correct?
