For the record:

```
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: D = graphs.DodecahedralGraph()
sage: L = D.lexicographic_product(P) 
sage: L.allow_multiple_edges(True)
sage: time L.has_multiple_edges()
```

Before: Wall time: 39.56 s

After: Wall time: 19.32 s

I hope I did no mistake, it's 4 a.m here...
