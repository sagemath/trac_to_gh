Some time ago I sorted out the fact that znpoly failed to build if the linker used was the Sun linker, as znpoly used GNU specific flags. 

I'm using

* Solaris 10 update 7 on SPARC
* sage-4.1.2.alpha2
* Sun Studio 12.1
* An updated configure script to allow the Sun compiler to be used #7021 

Well it seems there was another defect too, as the setting of CC is ignored too.

<a id='comment:13'>**Comment 13:**</a>
Should this not be "wont fix"? 

This almost automatic setting 

new -> needs_review
need_review to positive review
positive_review to closed. 

is in my opinion a bad thing.

It looks like it is "won't fix": look at the ticket's "milestone".
