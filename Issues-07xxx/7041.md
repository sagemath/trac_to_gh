`spkg-install` for `gap-4.4.10.p12`:

```
echo "*WARNING*: Unsetting CC since that tends to break GAP building"
unset CC
echo "*WARNING*: Unsetting CXX since that tends to break GAP building"
unset CXX
```

This appears to be done by Michael Abshoff as `SPKG.txt` shows:

```
=== gap-4.4.10.p8 (Michael Abshoff, June 16th, 2008) ===
 * unset CC in spkg-install (work around for #2575)
```

Looking at #2575 I can't help feel there must be a better solution.

* #7041: Only unset `CC` and `CXX` if really necessary (i.e., if they
  contain spaces, which is what currently would break the build).
* Clean up `spkg-install`.  Some things seem still weird, see comments.
* Added "Special Update/Build Instructions" section above.

For the record, the GAP 4.4.12.p6 spkg still unsets these variables, for whatever reason (#2575 and #4161 might shed some light on that).

Hopefully someone will soon upgrade to GAP 4.5, which **might** solve potential issues with not unsetting them; haven't tested that (or looked at it) at all.

I'm currently preparing a GAP 4.4.12.p7 spkg fixing this issue (i.e., only unsetting `CC` and `CXX` if absolutely necessary), and cleaning up `SPKG.txt` and `spkg-install`.

There are still some open questions though; see e.g. my comments [comment:ticket:10825:14 here] (on #10825).

Excerpt from (the modified) `SPKG.txt`:

## Dependencies

* readline (according to spkg/standard/deps)
* Sage (? also according to deps, "so that gap_reset_workspace works")

## Special !Update/Build Instructions

* TODO:
  - Use `patch` instead of copying patched files.
    (Then also add `patch` to the dependencies above.)
  - "Flatten" (i.e. remove) the `build()` function.
  - Perhaps check whether we can fix GAP's configure / build scripts
    w.r.t. brokenness of multiple words in `CC` (and `CXX`?) and its
    ignorance concerning `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`.
    (Then also support `SAGE_DEBUG` in `spkg-install`, and probably
    set up reasonable default `CFLAGS`.)

* Do we really want to copy everything from the build directory???
  (Cf. comment in `spkg-install`.)

 ...


I'll perhaps address some of the TODOs (I added myself) later, in a p8, but I'd really like to get this spkg in soon.

The stated (probably obsolete?) dependency on Sage and the last point should be answered by some of **you**... ;-)
