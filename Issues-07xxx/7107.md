```

Note that the above error occurs after mpfr successfully builds during building of the test suite.  Possible fixes:

* do not run spkg-check on OS X 10.4 (then the build continues fine... for a while -- i only watched a few minutes)

* fix the source of the problem (probably a compiler bug on OS X, so impossible)

* deprecate support for OS X 10.4.

I like the first option above.

The first option also works on the PPC G4 X.4 box I am trying.  Hopefully the build will complete; it's already through mpfi, Cython, Pynac, ... which is a good sign.  

In this case, I guess one would need something like the following at the VERY end of the spkg-install file:

```
-cd ..; ./spkg-check
+if [`uname` = "Darwin" and something else to show it's X.4]; then
+        shell equivalent of pass
+else
+        cd ..; ./spkg-check
+fi
```
Where I have no idea what the shell equivalent of pass is, and where I don't know how to check X.4 - I feel like there is some variable set sometimes that checks for things like 8.11.0 (which is the version of the box I'm running this on), but I can't remember what/where it is.
