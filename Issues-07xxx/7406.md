The LaTeX representation of (x<sup>pi)</sup>e is not valid TeX string and is not rendered by jsmath

```
sage: latex((x^pi)^e)
{(x)}^{\pi}^{e}
```

Burcin [suggested](http://groups.google.cz/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/c49c684f1c89d0c4) how to fix this and get output like 

```
{{(x)}^{\pi}}^{e}
```

```
The code for printing
symbolic expressions is in pynac (C++). The fix can be as simple as
printing an extra set of braces around power objects.

If anybody wants to try fixing this, the relevant function is
power::do_print_latex() in power.cpp. To get to the file (using the
instructions I wrote in another message just now), go to your SAGE_ROOT
and do:

./sage -f -s spkg/standard/pynac-0.1.9.p0.spkg

cd spkg/build/pynac-0.1.9/src/ginac

Edit power.cpp. To compile and make your changes effective, go to your
SAGE_ROOT again, and do

./sage -sh
cd spkg/build/pynac-0.1.9/src
make install 
```

However a better fix would be to get 

```
{x}^{a}
```
if the base is an atom (or not power) and

```
\left({x^a}\right)^{b}
```
if the base is a power. This allows to distinguish easily between

```
x^(a^b) 
```
and 

```
(x^a)^b
```

A workaround is to remove powers of powers by simplification. For example radcan function from Maxima perfoms such simplifications

```
sage: latex(maxima((x^pi)^e).radcan().sage())
x^{\pi e}
```

Perhaps close problem is

```
sage: latex(x*(1/(x^2)+sqrt(x^7)))
{(\sqrt{x^{7}} + \frac{1}{x^{2}})} x
```

Note missing \left and \right at outside parentheses which makes the rendering of the expression far from perfect. Should look like

```
sage: latex(x*(1/(x^2)+sqrt(x^7)))
{\left(\sqrt{x^{7}} + \frac{1}{x^{2}}\right)} x
```

Attachment [trac_7406-power_latex.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7406/trac_7406-power_latex.patch) by @burcin created at 2009-11-22 18:11:40

The new pynac package here

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.10.spkg

contains fixes for both the problem in the description and the one in [comment:3](#comment%3A3).

attachment:trac_7406-power_latex.patch contains doctests for the fix.

Note that the new pynac version also contains fixes for #7508 and #7264. Tests should be run with the patches from those tickets also applied in this order:

* #7508
* #7264 
* #7406 (this ticket)

This ticket now depends on #7490, #7508 and #7264.
