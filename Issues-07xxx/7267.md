```
A compact alternative to [Farbtastic](http://acko.net/dev/farbtastic) would be useful in space-constrained interacts and notebook/user settings pages.

Candidates:

* [Color Picker](http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/)
* [jPicker](http://www.digitalmagicpro.com/jPicker/)

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

There's a patch at

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/7267/trac_7267_color_choosers.patch

The patch 

* Adds both [ColorPicker](http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/) and [jPicker](http://www.digitalmagicpro.com/jPicker/).
* Adds a dedicated `color_selector()` `interact` control.  The keyword option
  * `widget` selects the widget to render.  The choices are `'farbtastic'` (the default), `'jpicker'`, and `'colorpicker'`.
  * `hide_box` (default: `False`) sets whether the input box is visible.

Here's a compact example:

```python
@interact
def _(color=color_selector((1,0,1), label='', widget='jpicker', hide_box=True)):
    show(plot(x / (8/7 + sin(x)), (x, -50, 50), fill=True, fillcolor=color))
```

Remarks:

* jPicker adds itself as a (grand)<sup>n</sup>-child of the output cell, so it's confined to that area.  This is a problem, e.g., when `auto_update=False` and a plot disappears.  The smarter ColorPicker appends itself to `document.body`, similarly to jQuery UI's dialogs.

* Continuously or rapidly changing *any* of the widgets sends so many requests to the server that a rendered `interact`'s final color may not match the final selected color.  The server does receive the final color, according to a print statement in `twist.Worksheet_eval`.  I'm not sure what happens to the corresponding output.  Anyway, I think this is an important but separate problem.

* In a future ticket, I'll set up one of the new choosers for user, worksheet, and notebook settings pages.  See `sagenb.notebook.conf.Configuration.html_table()` and `server_conf` for details.

For what it's worth, here's what I have in mind:

* For a [settings page](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9a5262dfaada469e/764b6f135d926ccd?#764b6f135d926ccd) with many color options (active / inactive cell text, background, etc.), we can use either CP or jP.

* For interacts, CP is a good default compact color selector, since it works better than jP when `auto_update=False`.  But I'm planning to add transparency control with jP, probably in a successor to #260 and the #5601-#5605 sequence that extends Sage's `Color` to matplotlib's RGBA tuples.

* For a [plot options control panel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/msg/ca41dc7496254063) --- double-click on a plot to open the dialog --- I'd like to support transparency (cf.

REFEREE REPORT:

1. General remark/question.  Is there any way we can get rid of stuff like this, where the exact version number is explicitly given:

```
+<link rel="stylesheet" href="/javascript/jquery/plugins/jpicker/css/jPicker-1.0.11.css" type="text/css" />
+<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript/jquery/plugins/jpicker/jpicker-1.0.11.min.js"></script>
```
This is I think happening more and more in the code, and I think it makes it difficult to upgrade the plugins.  Could we use symbolic links or something else that is clever (perhaps in twist.py) to get around this?

I don't think this is specific to this ticket, so I'm not considering this in refereeing this patch. 

...

Actually, WOW this is a really nice patch!   It must have been quite a lot of work, and really gives the notebook some real added depth.  Thanks!

Everything looks good.  It works fine. 

William

The sage notebook doesn't work on Windows yet though....  However, another option is just to rename the installed library folder without the version numbers (so no symbolic link is needed).  As long as we include a README things should be clear.
