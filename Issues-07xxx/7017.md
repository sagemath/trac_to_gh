I haven't looked closely at the patch. The one quick note I can make is that it looks like a few uses of double-quotes should be changed to backquotes, i.e. everything that should appear as `code`.

More important to me is the segfault.

There are a number of easy solutions, but I think the most robust would be to just hardcode an upper bound: if the user asks for a range with one of the parameters larger than our fixed bound, we should just fall back to a different method.

On my atom netbook with 1GB RAM I can't even use prime_range near 4*10**8 (and my virtual memory was thrashing for 3*10**8).  I don't think a hard-coded limit is appropriate if what values are possible depends on how much RAM is available (should the limit be configurable?).

Sebastian Pancratz suggested having the algorithm default be None, which would cause the algorithm to be automatically chosen.

Yes, it would be better if it automatically selected the appropriate algorithm for the input.

At a minimum, when prime_range with pari_primes fails, a message should be printed saying that the other algorithm is available.  Unfortunately assuming the user will read the doc string when a function fails is not realistic.

The patch I made also includes fixing a typo in a doc string in line 8605 (primes_up_to_n) of gen.pyx in the sage pari lib.

Currently prime_range in fast_arith.pyx calls primes_up_to_n in gen.pyx, which calls pari(n).primepi().  I think this should be replaced with Sage's prime_pi, which is faster and works for larger input.

Another bug, regarding Sage trac.  I put the traceback in a special box.  Yet this text above does not wrap.  This text above should still be word wrapped.
