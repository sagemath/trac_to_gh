For `p=3`, an error is getting triggered in computation of the p-adic regulator:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('148a')
sage: E.is_surjective(3)
(True, None)
sage: E.has_additive_reduction(3)
False
sage: E.has_nonsplit_multiplicative_reduction(3)
False
sage: E.is_good(3)
True
sage: E.is_ordinary(3)
True
sage: E.sha().p_primary_bound(3)
BOOM
```

I have a feeling that this just means that the documentation needs to include the rank 0 condition when `p=3`:

```
E.rank()
1
```
