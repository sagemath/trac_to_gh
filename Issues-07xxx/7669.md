Obviously one couldn't do this completely, but there are a few bits and pieces here and there so  perhaps it could be done for fairly simple programs and things like Manipulate?  This was requested by a participant at the first Sage Education Day; the idea would be to have something which would translate old notebooks etc. into Sage, so that one could use old code without using one of the interfaces/APIs when one's license expired, I think.

Well, the person who asked it asked an incredibly general question!  Hence sage-wishlist.  

More seriously, probably each of these, if feasible, would eventually be a "real" ticket.
