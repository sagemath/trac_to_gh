This patch contract an edge (u,v) in a graph. In the resulting graph vertex u is merged into vertex v.

The variables u and v can be passed as variables, a tuple (u,v) or a 3-tuple (u,v,'label'). The last allows us to use an element from G.edges() for contraction.

<a id='comment:4'></a>On second thought, reopening.

Merging vertices gives a slightly different result for certain cases that are important in deletion-contraction algorithms, so this function has a place to fill as well.

Example of case that contract_edge() handles differently:

If we have two vertices A, B, with two parallel edges between them, a merging of A and B results in a single vertex with no edge or loops. If we instead choose to contract one of the two parallel edges (and allow loops), we will end up with a single vertex which has a loop.

As a matroid theorist, I look at deletion and contraction a bit differently. It bothers me that I cannot write something along the lines of

H = G.delete((1,2)).contract([(3,5),(6,7)])

without modifying G.

    "body": "<a id='comment:18'></a>My pairs would be edges. In an even more ideal world, I would refer to them by their labels. For comparison, if M is a matroid with elements 'e', 'f', 'g', I currently have some experimental code allowing me to write\n\nN = M / ['e'] \\ ['f', 'g']\n\nresulting in the matroid with e contracted and f,g deleted. From a matroid-theoretic point of view, if you contract an edge, all edges parallel to it should turn into loops. The current merge_vertices doesn't do that, even if I call G.allow_loops(True) first. With this behavior, contracting a loop should probably equal deleting a loop.\n\nAnyway, my main point is that I feel there should be methods for deletion and contraction that return a new graph, rather than modifying the graph itself.\n\nReal use case: the other day I was wondering about maximal planar subgraphs of a small graph G. In that case you want to explore: first delete edge 'e', then delete edge 'f', then 'f' and 'g', then 'f' and 'h', and finally only edge 'h'. The current implementation makes such exploration of minors a bit cumbersome: you frequently make copies of G, which you then modify.",

<a id='comment:18'></a>My pairs would be edges. In an even more ideal world, I would refer to them by their labels. For comparison, if M is a matroid with elements 'e', 'f', 'g', I currently have some experimental code allowing me to write

N = M / ['e'] \ ['f', 'g']

resulting in the matroid with e contracted and f,g deleted. From a matroid-theoretic point of view, if you contract an edge, all edges parallel to it should turn into loops. The current merge_vertices doesn't do that, even if I call G.allow_loops(True) first. With this behavior, contracting a loop should probably equal deleting a loop.

Anyway, my main point is that I feel there should be methods for deletion and contraction that return a new graph, rather than modifying the graph itself.

Real use case: the other day I was wondering about maximal planar subgraphs of a small graph G. In that case you want to explore: first delete edge 'e', then delete edge 'f', then 'f' and 'g', then 'f' and 'h', and finally only edge 'h'. The current implementation makes such exploration of minors a bit cumbersome: you frequently make copies of G, which you then modify.

<a id='comment:28'></a>Brunellus,

This isn't quite there, and you haven't tested everything.

Graphs have a copy method -- `g = g.copy()` is faster than `g=copy(g)`.  There are two problems with the block

```
        if vertices and vertices[0] is None: 
	    vertices[0] = g.add_vertex()
```

first off, this assumes that `g.add_vertex()` returns the label of the added vertex.  It does not.  Second, it modifies `vertices` for no good reason (what if the users passes in a tuple, set, or generator?)

This is the main difficulty with such method: what's the good answer? what is the user expected ? It is really application dependent. For instance, in some cases you want to contract an edge unless it creates a loop.\\
I would say that as long as the behavior is clearly documented, it's fine. If the user wants something else, he can code his own method.

 

One remark. You could use `edges_incident.extend( self.outgoing_edges(v) )` instead of `out_edges=self.edge_boundary([v])`. You can also use `self.incoming_edges(v)`.

<a id='comment:63'></a>Another round of comments. 

In method `contract_edge`
- in the `INPUT` block, some lines are for `contract_edges` and so should be removed from here.
- remove the `OUTPUT` block. It is useless here
- If I call `G.contract_edge( (u, v) )` and that the graph has edge `(u, v, 'label')`, then the method will do nothing. Is this the behavior you expect? If so, it should be documented.
- you may replace `for e in self.edges_incident(v):` with `for x,y,l in self.edges_incident(v):`. I don't know which option is the best.

In method `contract_edges`:
- The first line is too long. Usually, the first line is short, and followed with a longer description
- Again the `OUTPUT` block is useless
- in the `TESTS` block, you have an indentation problem
- If we pass a list of 2-tuples but that all edges of the graph have non `None` labels, nothing will happen. If it's expected behavior, it should be documented
- after the `for e in edges:` loop, you should add a termination test like `if not edge_list: return` or `if not edge_list or not vertices: return`
- `out_edges=self.edge_boundary([v])` -> `out_edges = self.edge_boundary([v])`
- `edges_incident = edges_incident + self.edges_incident(v)` -> `edges_incident.extend(self.edges_incident(v))`
- `for (u, v, label) in edges_incident:` -> `for u, v, label in edges_incident:`.

I can't reproduce this. `self.has_edge(u,v)` works the same as `self.has_edge(u,v,None)`. It seems though the last edge it has in memory between `u` and `v` gets contracted.

```

I changed it to `x,y,l` for consistency.

Why is `x,y,l` preferred over `(x,y,l)`? I don't see anything about this in PEP8, but I've been using the parentheses around the tuple a lot because I think it's easier to read that way.

I think I put those tests in before I rewrote `contract_edge` to use `merge_vertices`. Maybe it's irrelevant to have those tests there now. Now that uses `merge_vertices`, it's dependent on #23290 to keep the loops. I should have been clearer about that, sorry.

Yes, I see it now. I'll fix those shortly.

<a id='comment:72'></a>Right, better to rebase on top of #23290.

In method `contract_edge`, I suggest the following change. Do you agree ?

```
       if self.allows_loops() and (not self.has_edge(u, u) or self.allows_multiple_edges()):
           # add loops
           for (x, y, l) in self.edges_incident(v):
               if set([x, y]) == set([u, v]):
                   self.add_edge(u, u, l)
```

In method `contract_edges`
- the test `if len(set([len(e) for e in edges])) > 1:` is fun ;)
- `if self.has_edge((u, v, label)):` -> `if self.has_edge(u, v, label):`. This is to avoid guessing the format in method `has_edge`.

I think sage will fail silently if multiedges are off, but it makes sense in principle to check first. I changed the order of the tests because I figured checking a boolean with `self.allows_multiple_edges()` is probably faster than looking for an edge.

<a id='comment:81'></a>Final comments (sorry for that).

For method `contract_edge`:
- at the top of the `generic_graph.py` file, could you ensure that the description of `contract_edge` is the same as in the method. I propose to put: `Contract an edge from `u` to `v``. Note that I use `Contract` and not `Contracts`.
- Then in the method, split the first line to `Contract an edge from `u` to `v`` and then have a next paragraph with `This method returns silently if the edge does not exist.`

For method `contract_edges`:
- at the top of the `generic_graph.py` file, for `contract_edges`: use `Contract` instead of `Contracts`
- improve the alignment of paragraph `If `e` is an edge that is...`
- In the `INPUT` block, `- ``edges`` - a list...` -> `- ``edges`` -- a list...`. You will certainly have to put the last word (edges) on the next line to be in 80 columns format.
- In the `TESTS:` block, just before `With loops in a digraph::`, remove the empty `::` block. I was not able to build the documentation and it took me a while to understand that it was caused by this `::` stuff.
- I'm not sure the empty line `....:` is useful. You can remove it.

I hope it's the last round of corrections ;)

<a id='comment:85'></a>You have used `from 'u' to 'v'` with `'` instead of ```. I think that ``` is more appropriate. It is nicer in the documentation and it avoids confusion with string.

You have to do the correction both at the top of the file and at the beginning of `contract_edge`.

After that you can set the ticket to positive review (or I will do it later).
