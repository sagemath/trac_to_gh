This patch contract an edge (u,v) in a graph. In the resulting graph vertex u is merged into vertex v.

The variables u and v can be passed as variables, a tuple (u,v) or a 3-tuple (u,v,'label'). The last allows us to use an element from G.edges() for contraction.

On second thought, reopening.

Merging vertices gives a slightly different result for certain cases that are important in deletion-contraction algorithms, so this function has a place to fill as well.

Example of case that contract_edge() handles differently:

If we have two vertices A, B, with two parallel edges between them, a merging of A and B results in a single vertex with no edge or loops. If we instead choose to contract one of the two parallel edges (and allow loops), we will end up with a single vertex which has a loop.

There's a spam link above here that needs removing.

As a matroid theorist, I look at deletion and contraction a bit differently. It bothers me that I cannot write something along the lines of

H = G.delete((1,2)).contract([(3,5),(6,7)])

without modifying G.

My pairs would be edges. In an even more ideal world, I would refer to them by their labels. For comparison, if M is a matroid with elements 'e', 'f', 'g', I currently have some experimental code allowing me to write

N = M / ['e'] \ ['f', 'g']

resulting in the matroid with e contracted and f,g deleted. From a matroid-theoretic point of view, if you contract an edge, all edges parallel to it should turn into loops. The current merge_vertices doesn't do that, even if I call G.allow_loops(True) first. With this behavior, contracting a loop should probably equal deleting a loop.

Anyway, my main point is that I feel there should be methods for deletion and contraction that return a new graph, rather than modifying the graph itself.

Got it !

This being said, I understand that's how matroid theory is written "on the paper", but do you think it would be possible to write useful code using only those symbols when any of them means copying the whole structure ? But perhaps I do not know how you intend to code it, and how much such operations could cost in memory and time ...

Brunellus,

This isn't quite there, and you haven't tested everything.

Graphs have a copy method -- `g = g.copy()` is faster than `g=copy(g)`.  There are two problems with the block

```
        if vertices and vertices[0] is None: 
	    vertices[0] = g.add_vertex()
```

first off, this assumes that `g.add_vertex()` returns the label of the added vertex.  It does not.  Second, it modifies `vertices` for no good reason (what if the users passes in a tuple, set, or generator?)

I ended up writing some new methods for edge contraction. I didn't use either patch here. The first one didn't seem to respect edge labels, and `allow_loops_multiedges` seems redundant since these are intrinsic to the graph, and the second one seemed too complicated to disentangle from `merge_vertices`. I also didn't include an `inplace` option for consistency with `delete_edge`.

The `contract_edges()` method was tough because if the user inputs a list of edges, the vertices need to be updated dynamically as the contractions occur and vertices are lost. I ended up using nested while loops to accomplish this. Maybe there's a faster way?

It's nice that sage already has an implementation of this algorithm, but I find it lacking. If I want a list of non-roots, I can do `vertices = [v for v in vertices if (v not in DS.root_to_elements_dict() )]`, but there doesn't seem to be an analog to my `root()` method. So at the end, when I need to know what the root of a vertex is, I don't see any easy way to do that if I'm using `DisjointSet`.

This is the main difficulty with such method: what's the good answer? what is the user expected ? It is really application dependent. For instance, in some cases you want to contract an edge unless it creates a loop.\\
I would say that as long as the behavior is clearly documented, it's fine. If the user wants something else, he can code his own method.

 

One remark. You could use `edges_incident.extend( self.outgoing_edges(v) )` instead of `out_edges=self.edge_boundary([v])`. You can also use `self.incoming_edges(v)`.

Another round of comments. 

In method `contract_edge`
- in the `INPUT` block, some lines are for `contract_edges` and so should be removed from here.
- remove the `OUTPUT` block. It is useless here
- If I call `G.contract_edge( (u, v) )` and that the graph has edge `(u, v, 'label')`, then the method will do nothing. Is this the behavior you expect? If so, it should be documented.
- you may replace `for e in self.edges_incident(v):` with `for x,y,l in self.edges_incident(v):`. I don't know which option is the best.

In method `contract_edges`:
- The first line is too long. Usually, the first line is short, and followed with a longer description
- Again the `OUTPUT` block is useless
- in the `TESTS` block, you have an indentation problem
- If we pass a list of 2-tuples but that all edges of the graph have non `None` labels, nothing will happen. If it's expected behavior, it should be documented
- after the `for e in edges:` loop, you should add a termination test like `if not edge_list: return` or `if not edge_list or not vertices: return`
- `out_edges=self.edge_boundary([v])` -> `out_edges = self.edge_boundary([v])`
- `edges_incident = edges_incident + self.edges_incident(v)` -> `edges_incident.extend(self.edges_incident(v))`
- `for (u, v, label) in edges_incident:` -> `for u, v, label in edges_incident:`.

I can't reproduce this. `self.has_edge(u,v)` works the same as `self.has_edge(u,v,None)`. It seems though the last edge it has in memory between `u` and `v` gets contracted.

```
sage: edgelist = [(0,1,0), (0,1,9), (0,1,2), (0,2,2), (1,2,3)]
sage: G = Graph(edgelist, loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.contract_edge(0,1); G.edges()
[(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 9), (0, 2, 2), (0, 2, 3)]
sage: edgelist = [(0,1,0), (0,1,2), (0,1,9), (0,2,2), (1,2,3)]
sage: G = Graph(edgelist, loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.contract_edge(0,1); G.edges()
[(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 2), (0, 2, 2), (0, 2, 3)]
```

> - you may replace `for e in self.edges_incident(v):` with `for x,y,l in self.edges_incident(v):`. I don't know which option is the best.


I changed it to `x,y,l` for consistency.

Why is `x,y,l` preferred over `(x,y,l)`? I don't see anything about this in PEP8, but I've been using the parentheses around the tuple a lot because I think it's easier to read that way.

I have a few more questions.

- Is `return` preferred over `return None`? I've changed them to just `return`.
- Where is the indentation error in `contract_edges()`? Is it the space in front of some of the edges in the output? That matches the output, and it makes the html display correctly.
- I've noticed that there are problems for `contract_edges()` if the input is a mix of 2-tuples and 3-tuples as the example below shows, but this is kind of a GIGO situation and I don't know if I should bother addressing it.

```
sage: edgelist = [(0,1,0), (0,1,1), (0,1,2)]
sage: G = Graph(edgelist, loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.contract_edges([(0,1,2), (0,1)]); G.edges()
[(0, 0, 0)]
sage: G = Graph(edgelist, loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.contract_edges([(0,1), (0,1,2)]); G.edges()
[(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1)]

Something has changed in the tests for method `contract_edge`. Now we are loosing loops. I don't know why

```
sage: edgelist = [(0,0,'a'), (0,1,'b'), (1,1,'c')]
sage: G = Graph(edgelist, loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.contract_edge(0,1,'b'); G.edges()

sage: D = DiGraph(edgelist, loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: D.contract_edge(0,1,'b'); D.edges()

```

In `contract_edges`:
*`if not edges:` -> `if not edge_list:`
* indentation of tests `With loops in a digraph::`

I think I put those tests in before I rewrote `contract_edge` to use `merge_vertices`. Maybe it's irrelevant to have those tests there now. Now that uses `merge_vertices`, it's dependent on #23290 to keep the loops. I should have been clearer about that, sorry.

Yes, I see it now. I'll fix those shortly.

Right, better to rebase on top of #23290.

In method `contract_edge`, I suggest the following change. Do you agree ?

```
       if self.allows_loops() and (not self.has_edge(u, u) or self.allows_multiple_edges()):
           # add loops
           for (x, y, l) in self.edges_incident(v):
               if set([x, y]) == set([u, v]):
                   self.add_edge(u, u, l)
```

In method `contract_edges`
- the test `if len(set([len(e) for e in edges])) > 1:` is fun ;)
- `if self.has_edge((u, v, label)):` -> `if self.has_edge(u, v, label):`. This is to avoid guessing the format in method `has_edge`.

I think sage will fail silently if multiedges are off, but it makes sense in principle to check first. I changed the order of the tests because I figured checking a boolean with `self.allows_multiple_edges()` is probably faster than looking for an edge.

That also makes sense.

Nevermind. A digraph can have two arcs in different directions between a pair of vertices and still have multiedges disabled, so contraction can create a loop. I suppose it's better like it is, since if there's already a loop at `u`, it will always be kept with its original label now.

Final comments (sorry for that).

For method `contract_edge`:
- at the top of the `generic_graph.py` file, could you ensure that the description of `contract_edge` is the same as in the method. I propose to put: `Contract an edge from `u` to `v``. Note that I use `Contract` and not `Contracts`.
- Then in the method, split the first line to `Contract an edge from `u` to `v`` and then have a next paragraph with `This method returns silently if the edge does not exist.`

For method `contract_edges`:
- at the top of the `generic_graph.py` file, for `contract_edges`: use `Contract` instead of `Contracts`
- improve the alignment of paragraph `If `e` is an edge that is...`
- In the `INPUT` block, `- ``edges`` - a list...` -> `- ``edges`` -- a list...`. You will certainly have to put the last word (edges) on the next line to be in 80 columns format.
- In the `TESTS:` block, just before `With loops in a digraph::`, remove the empty `::` block. I was not able to build the documentation and it took me a while to understand that it was caused by this `::` stuff.
- I'm not sure the empty line `....:` is useful. You can remove it.

I hope it's the last round of corrections ;)

You have used `from 'u' to 'v'` with `'` instead of ```. I think that ``` is more appropriate. It is nicer in the documentation and it avoids confusion with string.

You have to do the correction both at the top of the file and at the beginning of `contract_edge`.

After that you can set the ticket to positive review (or I will do it later).

Best,
