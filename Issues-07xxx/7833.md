Pass CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS from the environment into the build process.  This also corrects a typo in CPPFLAGS.

Note that FreeBSD needs the path to libiconv to be explicitly specified.  In theory, --with-libiconv-prefix should work but configure script is broken and ignores that path when looking for libiconv.  Hard-wire /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib via xxFLAGS.  Without this change, you get:

```
checking iconv.h usability... no
checking iconv.h presence... no
checking for iconv.h... no
checking for iconv... no
checking for iconvlist... no
configure: error: --with-iconv=yes (default) and a suitable iconv is not available
Error configuring R.

Is #6532 relevant here?  Is it possible to update this patch for that spkg - it looks like it should be fairly trivial.  You could review that one first if that makes it easier; unfortunately, I don't have access to a FreeBSD machine to return the favor :(

I don't have a FreeBSD machine, but this patch looks fine to me. The previous spkg-install was clearly written incorrectly. The issues at #6532 are something quite separate. So a positive review from me.

This needs a link to an spkg to be reviewed.  However, I have incorporated it in the spkg at #6532, so hopefully that will be sufficient!
