Pass CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS from the environment into the build process.  This also corrects a typo in CPPFLAGS.

Note that FreeBSD needs the path to libiconv to be explicitly specified.  In theory, --with-libiconv-prefix should work but configure script is broken and ignores that path when looking for libiconv.  Hard-wire /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib via xxFLAGS.  Without this change, you get:

```
checking iconv.h usability... no
checking iconv.h presence... no
checking for iconv.h... no
checking for iconv... no
checking for iconvlist... no
configure: error: --with-iconv=yes (default) and a suitable iconv is not available
Error configuring R.

I don't have a FreeBSD machine, but this patch looks fine to me. The previous spkg-install was clearly written incorrectly. The issues at #6532 are something quite separate. So a positive review from me.
