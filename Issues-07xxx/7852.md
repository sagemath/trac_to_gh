Observe the docstring for solve_left for an RDF matrix:

```
sage: A = random_matrix(RDF,3)
sage: A.solve_left?
Solve the equation A*x = b, where
        
        EXAMPLES:
            sage: A = matrix(RDF, 3,3, [1,2,5,7.6,2.3,1,1,2,-1]); A
            [ 1.0  2.0  5.0]
            [ 7.6  2.3  1.0]
            [ 1.0  2.0 -1.0]
            sage: b = vector(RDF,[1,2,3])
            sage: x = A.solve_left(b); x
            (-0.113695090439, 1.39018087855, -0.333333333333)
            sage: A*x
            (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
```

But that is solve_right. 

This was evidently introduced by maybe Grout's "Switch the RDF and CDF matrices to a numpy 1.2 backend; factor out common functionality to matrix_double_dense.pyx.".

Patch corrects the naming problem, and creates upgraded ``solve_left`` and ``solve_right``.

This required just a few touch-ups where the name had been wrong, or the improved accuracy changed results.

Without the patch, "solve_right" seems to work for nonsquare matrices over RDF, I guess because it's using the generic "solve_right" method from matrix2.pyx.  With the patch, it looks like this won't work any more; is that right?  Is there a good reason for not allowing square matrices?  We could instead add a method `_solve_right_nonsingular_square` to matrix_double_dense.pyx, and then I think this should be called by the generic solve_right method.

For "solve_left", could we just remove the version from matrix_double_dense.pyx altogether, and just use the generic version?

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A4):

Yes, there is some tension in handling inexact matrices with routines designed for exact matrices (which is the root issue here, I believe).  `NumPy/SciPy` just does not do certain things, such as computing a rank.

I'm hoping to get some guidance from the `NumPy` folks here at Sage Days 29 right now and we can chat some more.

Finally getting back to this one.

1.  solve_left and solve_right are confused at the moment - I think this is important to fix.

2.  The code is different, in part because the error messages are explicit, naming rows and columns when sizes do not match.

3.  The longer I think about it, the more I think we should *never* be feeding floating-point matrices into exact routines.  We should expose the ScyPy/NumPy/LAPACK routines as much as possible and not pretend the exact routines are going to give reasonable answers as a "fallback."

4.  I'm happy to try to get solutions to systems with non-square coefficient matrices with floating-point entries, but despite a lot of thought and reading, I'm not convinced of the right approach.  In any event, I'd like to fix the problem at hand, and do the non-square somewhere else.

5.  I am going to set this to "needs review" but I'm happy to entertain more discussion - I'll just need convincing.

The three reviewer patches apply, build and pass their tests once #11848 is applied to a recent alpha3 prerelease that already has the main patch.  Currently passes all tests in `sage/matrix` but will run full tests overnight.

This has a positive review from me based on the reviewer contributions, but is marked as closed right now anyway.  I'll only retreat if something unexpected happens overnight.

Leif - thank-you very much for getting these noisy tests cleaned up.
