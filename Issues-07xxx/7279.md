Thanks,

Jason doesn't want to see that error.  It is there because of enhanced security on the public notebook.

If you use server_pool, the worksheet process now run in a way that is much, much safer than it was before.  In particular, they don't have read or write access to anything outside /tmp (except to the DATA dir temporarily in their worksheet), whereas the old worksheet processes could pretty much delete or change all the worksheet data for any worksheet.

This enhanced security is totally automatic for anybody that uses the server_pool option.

So:

1. Usually a shell script changes directory to the worksheet directory and executes its commands there.

2. It can't do that if server_pool option is used.

It seems that instead of masking the error, we should use sh.chdir so that the script does not try to change directory to the worksheet directory.  It makes me uncomfortable to just mask the error, when the real problem is that sh tries to change directory when it should just stay inside of the temporary directory.

Do you want me to change the %sh mode so it specifically changes to the /tmp/foo-* directory instead of the worksheet directory?   That seems like a good idea, though it
will mean that %sh behaves differently than it used to when server_pool isn't set.

Is a temporary directory created when server_pool is not used?

If yes, then right now there is a terrible inconsistency, in that we are in that temporary directory when server_pool is used (because chdir errors out), but we are not in that directory when server_pool is not used (because chdir succeeds).  What I'm saying is that this inconsistency between server_pool=True and server_pool=False is really bad.

Note that the default for sh._curdir is '.'.  Would it be best to just change the current working directory to the temporary directory before executing anything?
