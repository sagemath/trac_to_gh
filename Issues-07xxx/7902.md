This is similar to #5517.

The error reported by scipy-0.7.p3 is:

```
Can't locate File/Copy.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /etc/perl /usr/local/lib/perl/5.10.0 /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0 /usr/lib/perl5 /usr/share/perl5 /usr/lib/perl/5.10 /usr/share/perl/5.10 /usr/local/lib/site_perl .) at ./copy_patches.pl line 2.
```
However, the `spkg-install` here is actually a shell script which calls the perl script (`copy_patches.pl`), *but it doesn't check the exit status*. Therefore, even though the perl script is aborted, the spkg-install continues without a real warning.
