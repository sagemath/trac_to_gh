if you use the python platform module, you can check specifically for 10.6:

```
>>> platform.mac_ver()
('10.6.1', ('', '', ''), 'i386')
```

However, it might be nice to warn people on 10.5 that 10.6 will not work to prevent people from upgrading.  What do you think?

I think the test `if os.uname()[2] == "10.0.0"` does check specifically for 10.6.  If you're running OS X 10.5, then os.uname()[2] returns "9.8.0" (at least on my machine.  (On the other hand, `platform.mac_ver()` doesn't return anything with 10.5: I get `(*, (*, *, *), '')` as output.)

As for the warning, in addition or instead, should we put a notice up on sagemath.org, on the Mac download page?
