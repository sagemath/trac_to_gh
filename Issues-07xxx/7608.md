<a id='comment:1'></a>With the provided patch, all doctests in the graph/ directory pass.
I didn't tested more yet.

<a id='comment:11'></a>I tested this on an imac running 10.6.1, which has these failures before adding the spkg and the patch from this ticket:

```

The tree patches must be applied.

The only doctest failure remaining for me is

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx"
```
It's  a backward compatibility problem: we can't unpickle graphs pickled in the old format as the NetworkX format changed. I must admit I don't really know how to deal with this.

This seems a little glib to me. I've never seen problems with refinement_graphs.pyx timing out, #7461 was supposed to fix a timeout in refinement_matrices.pyx, which only happened on systems where the clock was seriously messed up.

David-- Can you apply the patch at #7461 and see if refinement_graphs.pyx is still hanging?

There is some code in there which converts to and from NetworkX graphs, if I'm not mistaken. There might actually be something going on there.

The problem is that, for me, #7461 will not apply after applying the tickets from 
this patch. I guess they are conflicting?

I only got the hanging problem with refinement_graphs.pyx after applying these
patches.

Also, try to put all changes into one patch. In this case, the following three patches could be rolled into one:

* [trac_7608_networkx-1.0.1_fixes.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/7608/trac_7608_networkx-1.0.1_fixes.patch)

Doing so would make it easier to review.

I have attached [trac_7608-networkx-folded.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/7608/trac_7608-networkx-folded.patch) which folds the following three patches into one patch:

Only apply [trac_7608-networkx-folded.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/7608/trac_7608-networkx-folded.patch). This folded patch is based on Sage 4.3.3 because [trac_7608_networkx-1.0.1_fixes.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/7608/trac_7608_networkx-1.0.1_fixes.patch) results in a hunk failure as reported above.

This ticket keeps trying to make me the owner.  Jason?

This is on 4.3.3.final, I will upgrade right now and try again.  Just a few errors:

```
        sage -t  devel/sage-networkx/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py # 4 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-networkx/sage/graphs/graph_plot.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-networkx/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py # 2 doctests failed
```

Some are ordering problems, mostly on what appear to be random graphs.  Some look obviously fixable.  The `graph_plot.py` is an exception and looks unintelligible to me.

More in a little bit.

Yep, I was only looking carefully at the low-order bits.  ;-)

This doctest is addressed in one of the previous patches (trac_7608_networkx-1.0.1_fixes.patch).

Minh did an excellent service in cleaning-up the monster version of this patch, but I'd guess maybe a couple of necessary parts didn't make the cut into the latest version.  Perhaps the other five could also be located in the "fixes" series.

<a id='comment:45'></a>I've tested this with a 700-line script I used last August to generate graphics for a graph theory talk.  While not comprehensive, it will certainly give the basic graph theory routines quite a workout.  Output looks correct, no errors raised, and just one (legitimate) deprecation warning about the `cliques()` method.  So I'm even more confident that these changes should be (fairly) backward-compatible.

I don't have any patches on this ticket, so I could give a positive review once the six doctests are fixed.  Or if no one rises to the bait, I'll fix the doctests in a day or two......

<a id='comment:46'></a>Latest attachment fixes five doctests (and a sixth seems to fix itself as it is in a chain of random events where two were deleted).  This has been kept separate from the "folded" patch so it can be easy to review.

All of the new doctest results in this patch are straight out of the original "fixes" patch, so I believe they were simply omitted in creating the "folded" patch.

With this patch, all tests pass on sage.math except for some `sage/combinat/words/morphism.py` pickling/save/category stuff.  My own setup seems a bit messed up, so with `-testall` I get lots of failures, but all tests pass in `sage/graphs`.

Hi Jason,

Sorry I missed your ping on IRC.  Yes, all I did was copy six missing doctests.  One big patch had many spurious changes (line endings, blank lines, whatever).  Minh did a great service to clean it up, but I think he simply missed a few tests.  I just copied them out of the old patch and ran tests.  And I also ran it against a big script I used to build my Hoffman-Singleton Graph talk.

Yes, I think the possible break in user code is somewhat out of our hands, given it was a change in NetworkX.  But not bad, given how long its been since an upgrade.

Short answer - I think it just needs somebody fresh to run tests (on the whole Sage library?) and call it good.  That'd be you.  ;-)

Hi Jason,

Had to rebase the mega-patch and it looks like there are some new (trivial) failures with the edge labels being None/empty-dictionaries.

I'll try to get some full tests done and new patches up before the evening is out.

<a id='comment:61'></a>The latest fix-ups by Minh, the rolled-up mega patch, the upgraded spkg all build and past tests on 4.4rc0, specifically,

`sage -t -long  devel/sage/sage`

so I'm flipping this back to positive review.  Hopefully it'll get merged before any new graph theory tickets.
