```
sage: F = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: K = F.subfields(3)[0][0]
sage: K
Number Field in zeta70 with defining polynomial x^3 + x^2 - 2*x - 1
```

I think this convention of adding a 0 to the variable name, as nice and practicle as it is in general, is not good in this case. The resulting algebraic element is not a 70th root of unity as the name would suggest.

Attachment: **[trac_7695.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7695/trac_7695.patch.gz)**

This is ready for review but depends on #9407.

Of course, this is not the only solution, but it eliminates the cases that bother me.
