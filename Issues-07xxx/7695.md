sage: F = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: K = F.subfields(3)[0][0]
sage: K
Number Field in zeta70 with defining polynomial x^3 + x^2 - 2*x - 1
```

I think this convention of adding a 0 to the variable name, as nice and practicle as it is in general, is not good in this case. The resulting algebraic element is not a 70th root of unity as the name would suggest.

This is ready for review but depends on #9407.

Of course, this is not the only solution, but it eliminates the cases that bother me.

`sage --dev` has its own local version of the dependencies.  I think that when the local and remote dependencies are different, it is supposed to ask if you want to upload or download the dependency list or to leave the two lists different.
