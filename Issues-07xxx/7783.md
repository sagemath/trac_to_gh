<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Actually, all command line 3d graphics are broken in sage-4.3.   I just tried on one of the linux binaries and found this too:

```
wstein@ubuntu910-64:/tmp/wstein/farm/sage-4.3$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.3, Release Date: 2009-12-24                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: !sage-native-execute local/bin/jmol
Jmol.jar not found
```

This is yet more fallout from changing the sagenb to use setuptools instead of distutils. The problem is that the jmol script says this:

```
#!/bin/sh
JMOL_HOME="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages/sagenb/data/jmol"
...
```

However, look at site-packages now:

```
...
sagenb-0.4.8-py2.6.egg
...
```

Doing this makes the problem disappear:

```
$  cd sage-4.3/local/lib/python/site-packages
$  ln -s sagenb-0.4.8-py2.6.egg/sagenb .
```
