- faster hash method calling the hash of the underlying matrix
  (which is set as immutable for that purpose)
- new __eq__ method
- action on the weight lattice realization:
  optimization of the matrix multiplication

Depends (trivially) on #7753

This indirectly improve most Weyl group routines:

Without the patch:

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(["F",4])
sage: W.cardinality()
1152
sage: time l=list(W)
CPU times: user 12.14 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 12.20 s Wall time: 12.20 s

sage: W = WeylGroup(["E",8])
sage: time w0 = W.long_element()
CPU times: user 1.71 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 1.72 s Wall time: 1.72 s
```

With the patch:

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(["F",4])
sage: W.cardinality()
1152
sage: time l=list(W)
CPU times: user 7.96 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 8.00 s Wall time: 8.01 s

sage: W = WeylGroup(["E",8])
sage: time w0 = W.long_element()
CPU times: user 1.40 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.41 s Wall time: 1.42 s
```

Honestly, this is still ridiculously slow; luckily there still is much room left for improvements by improved caching and optimizations of the underlying tools (CombinatorialFreeModules, ...).

I tested this patch without #7753. I tested it with and without the
patch in #7751.

It is a very substantial speedup. It cuts a few 
seconds off `sage -t weyl_groups.py` but more importantly it about doubles the speed of computing the reduced word of a Weyl group element, which is the basis of most combinatorial algorithms.

There are three patch fragments, one replacing the hash method with the hash of the underlying matrix, one replacing the `__eq__` method, and
one unraveling some unnecessary complexity in the Weyl group action. I tested each patch fragment separately and found that they are all speedups, the last one being very significant.

Hi Dan and Nicolas,



I'm doing a release tour of the features of this ticket, see the [Sage wiki](http://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-4.3.1) page. Is there some sample code I could use to show the speed-up implemented by this ticket?
