Still there in 4.3.1:

```
sage: rational_reconstruction?
...

        exists, that pair is unique and this function returns it. If no
        such pair exists, this function raises ZeroDivisionError.
```
and:

```
sage: rational_reconstruction(29,105)
...
ValueError: Rational reconstruction of 29 (mod 105) does not exist.
```

Note also that in 4.3.1 a.rational_reconstruction? gives a different documentation, which does
not mention what happens in case of error. Why are the documentations different?
