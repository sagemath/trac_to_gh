zlib-1.2.3.p4/src/contrib/masmx86/inffas32.obj: 80386 COFF

zlib-1.2.3.p4/src/contrib/masmx64/gvmat64.obj: ACB archive data
```

Delete the above and it builds fine.  Similar directories don't have obj files.

Note that the above is for Microsoft Windows anyways, so it's especially important we don't distribute their binary stuff!
