This ticket is analogous to #3106, but in addition to exporting a 2d image there should be a way to export a html page with the 3d applet script embedded.  

It would be assumed that the user has a jmol/ directory in the same directory as the html file - I don't see an easy way to be more flexible about that.

I thought this might be of some interest to people since I'm not sure
how well the process is documented.

I wanted to make some vector field plots using Jmol and then put them
on a web page.  To do that, you have to get the zipped script file
from the cell, unzip it, and put it on your web server.  The server
also has to have the jmol directory with the standard jmol .jar files
and Jmol.js (downloaded from the jmol site).

Instead of trying to explain it in detail, it may be more helpful to
look at the result:
```

http://www.d.umn.edu/~mhampton/m3298f9/vfieldplots.html

```
...for the lab the students are given a list of vector fields that
they must match to the plots.

It would be nice if this could be automated in some way, with some
sort of "export to html page" command, analogous to the "Get Image"
command currently supported.

In particular, in the latest versions of jmol one can set defaultdirectory to be inside the zip file, negating the need for an external script that does (only) that.
