By default, you get the following, which is corrected by the patch to singuname.sh:

```
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/peter/sage/sage-4.3/spkg/build/singular-3-1-0-4-20090818.p2/src'
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `distclean'.  Stop.

creating cache ./config.cache
checking uname for singular... unknown
configure: error: Unknown architecture: Check singuname.sh
Unable to configure Singular.
```

Correct configure script for amd64 by patching the autoconf inputs and re-running autoconf.  This corrects a problem where linking libsingular.so reports lots of undefined references to both internal `om`* functions and functions within libncurses.

Several other trivial fixes to support dynamic linking on FreeBSD/amd64.


Upstream: **Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.**

Unless I am mistaken, you have modified the singular sources directly, which is not permitted. Instead, you should create new versions of the files, put them in the 'patches' directory, and have something in spkg-install like

```
cp patch/mod_raw.cc src/kernel/mod_raw.cc
```
Likewise, you should not change the configure script, or configure.ac, but instead have 

```
cp patches/configure src/
```
and created a diff file between the old configure.ac and the new configure.ac and put that in the patches directory. 

Once that is done, it would need testing on Solaris, OS X and Linux in addition to FreeBSD.

The patch by Stephen Montgomery-Smith, reported above by kcrisman, is only needed because when building using the FreeBSD port math/sage, the program ar is replaced by another program.

It would be really great if these three lines could be removed from the configure file.  As best as I can tell, they serve no purpose whatsoever for any OS.

I quote from the ticket:

```

fixed: do not abort configure, if ar is not found

This allows to define a different ar program
but if none is found, you are on your own.
Will be changed with the new version anyway.
```

This is pretty enigmatic.

Anyway, this patch and the following diff for spkg-install are doing it for the [FreeBSD port](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/math/sage/).
