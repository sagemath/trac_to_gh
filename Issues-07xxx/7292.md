With the flow function from #7592, functions returning a maximal number of Vertex/Edge disjoint st-path should be defined. The will obviously use the flow functions, but in many applications the user is just interested in these paths, and so there should be an easy way to find them in Sage.

Here it is !!

Please check, when appying it, that nothing disappears "above" and "after" the added sections ! If this version is not easier to apply, I think the best way would be to create a patch based upon the version you are working on and the patch you already applied (this should not be long though, this patch just adds two consecutive functions)

Sorry for the trouble ! :-)
