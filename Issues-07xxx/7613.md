Twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 2.  Currently the twin prime counting function, which counts the number of twin primes less than a given x, is not implemented in Sage, Mathematica, or other computer algebra systems.  Where it is calculated, the method used is mere sieving.

Use the approach of #7013 and #7539 to make a competitive (if not the only available as general purpose software) implementation of the twin prime counting function.  It should be at least 1000-10000 times faster than mere sieving.

(possible names are twin_prime_pi and prime_pi2).

Implement next_twin_prime, is_twin_prime, is_chen_prime, is_semi_prime functions

Other types of primes such as cousin primes, prime triplets, and sexy primes could also be considered.

Maybe could also try to compute partial sums of Brun's constant or prime harmonics sums.

Computing the Twin Prime Counting Function

If anyone is looking for a project to do over winter break (or knows anyone who would enjoy this project), they should read this.  This is a great opportunity to make a significant contribution to Sage and the mathematics community in general.  I would do it myself, but I already have a project (graphical physics simulation) for this month.  Just make sure that multiple people don't independently make distinct implementations.

Twin primes are primes that differ by 2.  Primes are difficult enough to understand, but twin primes are to an even greater extent.  Many techniques used in studying primes do not carry over to twin primes.  For example, Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes does not carry over to twin primes.  Infinitude of twin primes is the twin prime conjecture, one of Landau's problems.  It was reading about this problem in Calvin C. Clawson's Mathematical Mysteries, the Beauty and Magic of Numbers when I was in junior high-school that made me fall in love with number theory.

"""At the 1912 International Congress of Mathematicians, Edmund Landau listed four basic problems about primes. These problems were characterised in his speech as "unattackable at the present state of science" and are now known as Landau's problems. They are as follows:

1. Goldbach's conjecture: Can every even integer greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes?
2. Twin prime conjecture: Are there infinitely many primes p such that p + 2 is prime?
3. Legendre's conjecture: Does there always exist at least one prime between consecutive perfect squares?
4. Are there infinitely many primes p such that p − 1 is a perfect square? In other words: Are there infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1?

As of 2009, all four problems are unresolved."""
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau%27s_problems

Modeling the distribution of twin primes probabilistically (as done by the prime number theorem), produces convincing evidence (but not proof) of the twin prime conjecture.  There is even a twin prime analogue to the logarithmic integral.
"# Li_2(x) = integral(2*c_2/(ln t)^2, t, 2, x), the Hardy-Littlewood integral approximation for pi_2(x).

According to Jeffrey Lagarias, Victor Miller, and Andrew Odlyzko's 1985 paper "Computing pi(x): The Meissel-Lehmer Method" (where a record breaking value of the prime counting function was published that used a new essentially O(x^(2/3)) algorithm)
"Legendre [born 1752] was the first to suggest a method of calculating pi(x) without locating all the primes less than x."
http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/arch/meissel.lehmer.pdf

Look at the absolutely beautiful graphs of the twin prime counting function at http://curvebank.calstatela.edu/prime/prime.htm.

Results concerning how small the gaps between primes can be (representing progress toward the twin prime conjecture) have been made as recently as 2005.

This prompted a Nova science now segment on twin primes (and a song).

You could make some of these functions methods of the Primes() object:

```
sage: P = Primes(); P
Set of all prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, ...
```

So

```
sage: P.twin_prime_pi(1000)
...
sage: P.prime_pi2(1000)
...
```

This would help gather these functions together so it is easy to find, etc.

After thinking about this some more, this problem seems easier than I had first realized.  You do not need to sieve out all non twin primes to calculate the twin prime counting function.

As sieving is likely much more computationally demanding than iterating over a bit array, it would be a better to sieve out primes, then iterate through your bit array, noting each twin prime, prime triplet, etc as the case may be.
