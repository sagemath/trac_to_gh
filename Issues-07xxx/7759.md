Since sage-4.3.rc0 should build on Solaris, I think we need a README file. But I agree with William's suggestion some time ago, that this is a link to a Wiki. So the attached README.Solaris basically tells people where to get information on building Sage on Solaris. 

I'll update the Wili regularly.
