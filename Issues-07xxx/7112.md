<a id='comment:2'></a>I attached a patch trac_7112.patch that fixes all doctest issues:

* I couldn't reproduce the weird maxima-related solve doctest failure in the original log.

* I changed `sage: print get_url('http://localhost:%s/simple/compute?session=%s&code=2*2' % (port, session)) ` to use a larger timeout, since on OS X 10.5 PPC the default timeout isn't enough for Sage to even startup.

* There is a numerical noise in ell_rational_field.py

* The output of totallyreal_rel.py was not deterministic so I sorted it.

* This `dict_function({x/2: y^2, "hallo": "world"})` test latex.py is *impossible* to do right with more than one dictionary entry, since dictionaries are by definition in a random platform dependent order.  So I made it a dictionary of length 1.

* The html output for the notebook.py test is a bit different on OS X. It doesn't matter so much since that code is deprecated in sage-4.1.2.

For some reason on PPC X.4, I actually got a different answer, forget the sorting, on the item in part2.  I don't know why, but '5'  did not show up in the list.   Indeed, it must not have Same running the commands separately.  Even more aggravating, doctests pass now BUT if I do it "by hand", I still don't get 5, no matter what I do.  And it looks like that must be the case on your X.5 PPC as well, since you removed the five in the first patch.

But on Macintel X.5, I get the 5, as I also do on sagenb.org.  So I assume that the '5' is right, BUT the answer is definitely different on PPC.  What now?  Is there a way to mark this test as being dependent?  Or should there be a ... in the test?  Or is there a bug in the code for integral_elements_in_box?  

On the plus side, everything else is great!

```

All I need is to really test the whole patch(es) on my PPC, but #7186 was holding me up (the very first file, calculus.py, did show a very nasty doctest output ...), so I have to postpone this for yet another day (i.e. night, sigh ...).
