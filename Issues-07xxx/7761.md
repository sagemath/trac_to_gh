I believe William is aware of this bug and said it can be fixed by installing OpenSSL or similar. But I am unable to find a trac ticket for it, so I thought I'd open one. It's interesting this issue does not arise on Solaris 10 (SPARC), despite OpenSSL libraries not being present there either. This bug seems to come up a lot on linux too, as a Google search shows. 

On a Sun Ultra 27 (Intel Xeon processor), running Open Solaris 06/2009, I get the following problem when python is being built.

I'm not sure if this should be reported upstream or not. Some feedback on that might be useful. If so, I will report it to a python bug tracker or similar. The issue seems to arrise often enough.

These problems go away if one builds in 64-bit mode, by exporting SAGE64 to yes. However, CFLAGS must be passed properly to Python, otherwise the -m64 does not get added as a CFLAG. That was only happening on OS X. 

This updated spkg file adds:

```
CC="$CC $CFLAGS"
```
on the end of the configure line. Then, as long as CFLAGS contains -m64, so the package will build with 64-bit support.

Where is openssl supposed to be be installed?

/usr/local/ssl did not work for me.

I did something like:

 I'm not sure if this should be reported upstream or not. Some feedback on that might be useful. If so, I will report it to a python bug tracker or similar. The issue seems to arrise often enough.

I finally got this going on Open Solaris in VirtualBox!

The problem was related to different ssl libraries.

We have to be sure there is only one openssl in the process.

In the end I only used the system ssl and libcrypto

Installing OpenSLL is probably not the solution in Open Solaris.

In the standard setup the spkg installs fine.

So positive review! But leaving it to needs_info. Waiting for David.

I don't like the way you handle this. Dave made a point. It works on Open Solaris when CFLAGS contains -m64.

It maybe not sufficient, but it works here and let me have a working python.

I think release managers are way due to resolve this issue: having two p5 patches.

Let's get on!

I can understand why this was not merged. I'm just in the process of updating #7818. I just need to double check everything. But the main change is that 

* The user can supply SAGE_CFLAGS to set some CFLAGS they want. Since they are not setting CFLAGS, them doing so will not risk corrupting the Sage environment. 

* CFLAGS will not be exported, but instead 'SAGE_COMMON_CFLAGS', which will contain what the user specific in SAGE_CFLAGS, plus those flags I deem sensible. 

* Any spkg-install script that wants to use these flags, would have to do so by explicitly doing so via. 

CFLAGS="$SAGE_COMOON_CFLAGS"

That I believe will be safe. No package is forced to use my flags, but they can choose to. Hence I believe the changes to sage-env will be 100% safe, as they will not change any commonly used environment variables. 

So that's what I intend to do with sage-env. Now to the specific of this package.

Great. 

> Prior to writing this new package, I looked at Python's spkg-install to see how the 64-bit build has been enabled on OS X, and you can see it added -m64 to gcc, so "gcc -m64" was used as a compiler. Hence I basically used a similar method. 


Ah, OK. For easy reference: 

```
    if [ `uname` = "Darwin" ]; then
        if [ "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
            echo "64 bit OSX build enabled"
            OPT="-g -O3 -m64 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes"; export OPT
            ./configure $EXTRAFLAGS --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --without-libpng \
	    --enable-unicode=ucs4 --with-gcc="gcc -m64" --disable-toolbox-glue
        else
            ./configure $EXTRAFLAGS --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --without-libpng \
	    --enable-unicode=ucs4 --disable-toolbox-glue
        fi
    else
        ./configure $EXTRAFLAGS --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --without-libpng --enable-unicode=ucs4 CC="$CC $CFLAGS" CXX="$CXX $CXXFLAGS"
    fi
```

Interestingly, -m64 gets added to both OPT (used by Python and distutils in making CFLAGS) and gcc. I wonder if both are necessary, or if this is redundant (yielding two -m65s in the final command, which shouldn't hurt). In any case, hopefully we can do this in such a way that all the spkg-installs that are just "python setup.py install" won't have to have extra stuff added in there as well.

Sure, I tested this on linux. But the change in spkg-install only affected SunOS. So
I was not afraid it would break a linux build.

I'm taking myself off this as author, and adding myself as reviewer, as these changes by Jaap are his, and my earlier version was not working completely, so I feel justified in reviewing this. 

I'm going to delete the version I have on boxen, so not to cause any confusion.
