If I type

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,6,6,sparse=True); MS
Full MatrixSpace of 6 by 6 sparse matrices over Rational Field
sage: MS?
```
Then sage hangs eating all the memory. I don't have the less idea why it happens with `MatrixSpace`. I didn't try very hard but I can't manage any other request with the same effect. I checked that this is not a problem of installation on my computer: It happens as well on boxen. Though, on the contrary to my own computer, I didn't check that it effectively eat all the memory on boxen ;-)

Cheers,

Florent

So what should we do ? Try to figure out a smaller file that triggers the problem and report to the ipython community ? I've no idea how to debug ipython. Any better suggestion ?

Half-right. IPython is swallowing the kbd interrupt, but the bug is in
sage, it's the fact that len(MS) never returns:

sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,6,6,sparse=True); MS
Full MatrixSpace of 6 by 6 sparse matrices over Rational Field
sage: len(MS)

Good remark ! This indicate that there should be a generic test in the base category `Objects()` checking that for the current object `__len__` is either not defined either returns a correct `int` object or else raise an exception. Any other behavior (loop, returning a sage Integer or any fancy object should be reported as an error).

Those bugs seems therefore catchable by `TestSuite` if the object correctly inherits from the good category. I'll try it.

Otherwise positive review.
