The patch looks fine, and ``make test`` on my installation of SAGE 4.2.1 returns only one unrelated error, which I include for completeness:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.py"
```

```
File "/scratch/pancratz/sage-4.2.1/devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.py", line 297:
    sage: os.system('rm ' + tempname)
Expected:
    0
Got:
    256
```

I have attached an additional patch which removes one unused local variable.

Sebastian
