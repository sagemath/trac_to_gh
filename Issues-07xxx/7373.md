Libgcrypt is a package which has some assembly code routines. An option to the *configure* script

```
--disable-asm 
```

will disable the use of assembly code. This is mandatory on some platforms such as OS X and 64-bit SPARC, and would appear to be desirable on others, unless we can be sure it works. 

On my Sun Ultra 27, which has a quad core Xeon, running OpenSolaris 06/2009, libgrcypt would not build. The error message indicated it was related to the use of assembly code. 

However, I believe libgcrypt did not cause an issue on 'disk.math', so I'm somewhat surprised it did on my Ultra 27. But I think it is safer to disable assembly code on all Solaris x86 systems. 

I disabled the assembly code on 64-bit SPARC too, as I know that is broken - see #7127. Disabling the assembly code does not allow libgcrypt to be built as 64-bit code on Solaris, but the build does get further with the assembly code disabled. (It ultimately fails, as both 32-bit and 64-bit objects are created). 

I also added some tests for other platforms (AIX, HP-UX, Tru64 and IRIX) and disabled assembly language on them all except HP-UX, where I could verify it did not cause any problems. 

**Hence assembler code is disabled on**
* OS X          (both 32 and 64-bit)
* Solaris x86   (both 32 and 64-bit)
* Solaris SPARC (32-bit only)
* IRIX          (as a precaution, as untested)
* AIX           (as a precaution, as untested) 
* Tru64         (as a precaution, as untested)
'''
Assembly code is enabled on:'''
* Linux
* Solaris SPARC (32-bit only)
* HP-UX     
* Anything else, not mentioned above. This would include Cygwin.

**The updated package has been tested on** 
* sage.math
* bsd.math
* Sun Ultra 27, Intel Xeon processor, running OpenSolaris (x86)
* Sun Blade 2000, SPARC processor in 32-bit mode. 
* Sun Blade 2000, SPARC processor in 64-bit mode. The code does not build fully in this case, as explained above. 
* HP C3600 running HP-UX 11.11. The code builds fully.

It should be noted, the HP C3600 uses a PA-RISC processor. More modern HP-UX machines use the Itanium processor. These would certainly not use the same assembly code. 

The code may be found here.
