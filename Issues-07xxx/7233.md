The goal of the patch is to adapt SymmetricGroupAlgebra to categories and to add some improvements. The patch improve SymmetricGroupAlgebra in two ways:
 
- SymmetricGroupAlgebra is now in the category FiniteDimensionalAlgebraWithBasis. Note: A forthcomming patch from Valentin Feray will put it in the correct GroupAlgebras category;

- When creating SGA(n) a coercion from SGA(n-1) is declared.

I'm submitting the patch on behalf on Nicolas after reviewing it.

Depends on the categories framework #5891.

Cheers,

Florent
