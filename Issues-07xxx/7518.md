Observe:

```
sage: Q.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: gcd(Q(2),x^2)
1
sage: xgcd(Q(2),x^2)
<hang forever!>
```

whereas

```
sage: Q.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,implementation="NTL")
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_ntl.Polynomial_integer_dense_ntl'>
sage: gcd(Q(2),x^2)
1
sage: xgcd(Q(2),x^2)
(4, 2, 0)
```

works fine.

I don't see why the 'Reported; little feedback' should be annoying. The fact you have reported it is acknowldeged, the fact you have got no feedback is true. 

Once you get some feedback, then update it. It this case, I would have updated it to 'Preported Upstream. Developers acknowldge it's a bug', since at this point in time, there is no fix. 

What I think would be usefully added is 'Reported upstream. Useful feedback'. Sometimes it takes quite a bit of discussion to decide whether its a Sage bug or a bug in the upstream code.

I'm upgrading FLINT to 1.5.2 (not 1.6, at least for the moment, nor 2.x) for a couple of reasons (e.g. failing to build the test suite with MPIR 2.x, cf. #9858, #8664; ARM support, cf. #10328). I had an almost ready spkg last year, but now have to rebase my changes since the p5 has meanwhile become a p9. (There's a lot wrong with this spkg, especially the `makefile`, but also `spkg-install` and even `SPKG.txt`.)

I so far can confirm that the failing example given above works with FLINT 1.5.2, so this ticket can most probably be closed when a new FLINT spkg has been merged.

Stay tuned on #9858.
