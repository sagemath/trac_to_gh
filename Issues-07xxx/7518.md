Observe:

```
sage: Q.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: gcd(Q(2),x^2)
1
sage: xgcd(Q(2),x^2)
<hang forever!>
```

whereas

```
sage: Q.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,implementation="NTL")
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_ntl.Polynomial_integer_dense_ntl'>
sage: gcd(Q(2),x^2)
1
sage: xgcd(Q(2),x^2)
(4, 2, 0)
```

works fine.

> Dave 

I'm upgrading FLINT to 1.5.2 (not 1.6, at least for the moment, nor 2.x) for a couple of reasons (e.g. failing to build the test suite with MPIR 2.x, cf. #9858, #8664; ARM support, cf. #10328). I had an almost ready spkg last year, but now have to rebase my changes since the p5 has meanwhile become a p9. (There's a lot wrong with this spkg, especially the `makefile`, but also `spkg-install` and even `SPKG.txt`.)

I so far can confirm that the failing example given above works with FLINT 1.5.2, so this ticket can most probably be closed when a new FLINT spkg has been merged.

Stay tuned on #9858.
