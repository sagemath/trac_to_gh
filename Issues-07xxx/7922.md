This ticket refactors the code of WeylCharacterRing and WeightRing to use categories and (combinatorial) free modules. Along the way, it adds a couple features (Dan: please list them here), and solves a pickling issue which was caught by #7921:

```
sage: A2 = WeylCharacterRing(['A',2])
sage: a2 = WeightRing(A2)
sage: TestSuite(a2).run()
Failure in _test_element_pickling:
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: 2*a2(0,0,0) != 2*a2(0,0,0)
```

Indeed:

```
sage: x = a2.an_element()
sage: x == loads(dumps(x))
False
```


**Apply** [attachment:trac_7922-rebased-4.7.alpha3.patch]

**Remove** the following pickles from the pickle jar:

```
_class__sage_combinat_root_system_weyl_characters_WeightRing__.*
_class__sage_combinat_root_system_weyl_characters_WeylCharacterRing_class__.*
_class__sage_combinat_root_system_weyl_characters_WeylCharacter__.*
```

**Copy** the contents of 
[attachment:trac_7922-new_pickles.tar.gz] into `data/ext_code/pickle_jar`.

Regarding speed, testing a large number of branching rules show that the patch is a substantial speedup over the old code with a caveat: the old code has an option cache=true for WeylCharacterRings. If this option (which is not the default) is selected for every WeylCharacterRing, then the old code is faster. Typical times:

|        |          |
|--------|----------|
|Old Code|48 seconds|
|New Code|25 seconds|
|Old Code, cache=true|18 seconds|

Since I made the method `_irr_weights` a cached method, the caching done in the new code is approximately equivalent to the caching in the old code, so at the moment I don't see any way to improve the situation.

Hi Dan,

I just did a final proofreading, fixed a couple typos, updated coerce_to_sl in the doctests of the thematic tutorials, and removed some trailing white space and tabs.

For me it is now all good to go. Please check my reviewer's patch on the sage-combinat patch server. If it's ok with you, you can fold/upload and set a positive review here on my behalf.

Hi Dan,

I just checked out your final changes on the Sage-Combinat queue (trac_7922_alpha3-changes.patch), and it looks all good. So the final rebased patch you just posted (and which includes the above) is good to go.

Positive review!

This needs a few small fixes:
1. at various places `doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_character_ring.rst`, the indentation is inconsistent.  It should be 4 spaces but in the newly added examples it is more or less random.
2. in `doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_character_ring.rst`, the test on line 250 takes a very long time but is not marked as such.

Please add an additional patch fixing these issues.

Fixing the indentation is now #14678. The very long time is not necessary anymore, most likely thanks to the optimizations in #13391 (the example takes 0.22s on my machine).
