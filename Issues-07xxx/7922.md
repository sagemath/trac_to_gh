This ticket refactors the code of WeylCharacterRing and WeightRing to use categories and (combinatorial) free modules. Along the way, it adds a couple features (Dan: please list them here), and solves a pickling issue which was caught by #7921:

```
sage: A2 = WeylCharacterRing(['A',2])
sage: a2 = WeightRing(A2)
sage: TestSuite(a2).run()
Failure in _test_element_pickling:
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: 2*a2(0,0,0) != 2*a2(0,0,0)
```

Indeed:

```
sage: x = a2.an_element()
sage: x == loads(dumps(x))
False
```


**Apply** [attachment: trac_7922-rebased-4.7.alpha3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7922/trac_7922-rebased-4.7.alpha3.patch.gz)

**Remove** the following pickles from the pickle jar:

```
_class__sage_combinat_root_system_weyl_characters_WeightRing__.*
_class__sage_combinat_root_system_weyl_characters_WeylCharacterRing_class__.*
_class__sage_combinat_root_system_weyl_characters_WeylCharacter__.*
```

Regarding speed, testing a large number of branching rules show that the patch is a substantial speedup over the old code with a caveat: the old code has an option cache=true for WeylCharacterRings. If this option (which is not the default) is selected for every WeylCharacterRing, then the old code is faster. Typical times:

|        |          |
|--------|----------|
|Old Code|48 seconds|
|New Code|25 seconds|
|Old Code, cache=true|18 seconds|

Since I made the method `_irr_weights` a cached method, the caching done in the new code is approximately equivalent to the caching in the old code, so at the moment I don't see any way to improve the situation.

I just did a final proofreading, fixed a couple typos, updated coerce_to_sl in the doctests of the thematic tutorials, and removed some trailing white space and tabs.

Hi Dan,

I just checked out your final changes on the Sage-Combinat queue (trac_7922_alpha3-changes.patch), and it looks all good. So the final rebased patch you just posted (and which includes the above) is good to go.

Positive review!

This needs a few small fixes:
1. at various places `doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_character_ring.rst`, the indentation is inconsistent.  It should be 4 spaces but in the newly added examples it is more or less random.
2. in `doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_character_ring.rst`, the test on line 250 takes a very long time but is not marked as such.

Please add an additional patch fixing these issues.

Fixing the indentation is now #14678. The very long time is not necessary anymore, most likely thanks to the optimizations in #13391 (the example takes 0.22s on my machine).
