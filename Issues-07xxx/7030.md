Using

* Solaris 10 update 7 on SPARC
* sage-4.1.2.alpha2
* Sun Studio 12.1
* An updated configure script to allow the Sun compiler to be used

CC was set to the Sun C compler, and CXX to the Sun C++ compiler,

The 'quaddouble-2.2.p9' package believes the Sun C++ compiler can't create executables. 

```
configure: error: C++ compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details.
error configuring quad double
```

But other configure scripts have found the default output is a.out, so I'm pretty sure the Sun compiler can create executables! Maybe the test used is invalid.

Quaddouble was supposed to be removed from Sage long ago.   So there is no point in fixing it.
