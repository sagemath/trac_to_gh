Using

* Solaris 10 update 7 on SPARC
* sage-4.1.2.alpha2
* Sun Studio 12.1
* An updated configure script to allow the Sun compiler to be used

CC was set to the Sun C compler, and CXX to the Sun C++ compiler,

The 'quaddouble-2.2.p9' package believes the Sun C++ compiler can't create executables. 

```
configure: error: C++ compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details.
error configuring quad double
```

But other configure scripts have found the default output is a.out, so I'm pretty sure the Sun compiler can create executables! Maybe the test used is invalid.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Quaddouble was supposed to be removed from Sage long ago.   So there is no point in fixing it.
