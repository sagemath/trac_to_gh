Thanks for the quick work on this one!  I was going to try to test it with my original purpose.  But I can't seem to find a sagenb repo in my development tree.

What does it take to apply and run the patch?  I have a 4.3.1.alpha1 installation and know how to apply patches in /sage/devel.  is it much different?  Do I get everything I need in the Sage source distribution?

Thanks,
Rob

<a id='comment:8'></a>mpatel,

Works just fine for me with the interact I was building.  Leads with four sliders all with nice labels.  Screenshot here, and I'll post on sage-devel and sagenb.

Thanks - this will make interacts look all the better.

Yes, to adventurous, no to spare time.  But I think adventure wins.  

But (this is embarrassing) I've never installed an spkg.  How should I do this so I can back it out again without having a mess on my hands?  ;-)  I don't have anything important to lose, so it won't be a crisis if I screw up.  Can you give me another short primer?

Should have said above: I don't think I know enough to give a review.  But I'm going to go right now and advertise how good the patch is and see if we can get one.
