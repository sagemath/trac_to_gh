Can we typeset the labels of interact controls

```python
@interact
def test(x=slider(-2,2,1, label='$x^2$')):
    print "Doing nothing in an interact"
```
?

Hi Pat,

Thanks for the quick work on this one!  I was going to try to test it with my original purpose.  But I can't seem to find a sagenb repo in my development tree.

What does it take to apply and run the patch?  I have a 4.3.1.alpha1 installation and know how to apply patches in /sage/devel.  is it much different?  Do I get everything I need in the Sage source distribution?

Thanks,
Rob

mpatel,

Works just fine for me with the interact I was building.  Leads with four sliders all with nice labels.  Screenshot here, and I'll post on sage-devel and sagenb.

Yes, to adventurous, no to spare time.  But I think adventure wins.  

But (this is embarrassing) I've never installed an spkg.  How should I do this so I can back it out again without having a mess on my hands?  ;-)  I don't have anything important to lose, so it won't be a crisis if I screw up.  Can you give me another short primer?
