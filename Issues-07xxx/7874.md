Hi Pat,

Thanks for the quick work on this one!  I was going to try to test it with my original purpose.  But I can't seem to find a sagenb repo in my development tree.

What does it take to apply and run the patch?  I have a 4.3.1.alpha1 installation and know how to apply patches in /sage/devel.  is it much different?  Do I get everything I need in the Sage source distribution?

Thanks,
Rob

mpatel,

Works just fine for me with the interact I was building.  Leads with four sliders all with nice labels.  Screenshot here, and I'll post on sage-devel and sagenb.

Thanks - this will make interacts look all the better.

Yes, to adventurous, no to spare time.  But I think adventure wins.  

But (this is embarrassing) I've never installed an spkg.  How should I do this so I can back it out again without having a mess on my hands?  ;-)  I don't have anything important to lose, so it won't be a crisis if I screw up.  Can you give me another short primer?

Should have said above: I don't think I know enough to give a review.  But I'm going to go right now and advertise how good the patch is and see if we can get one.

To install any spkg, local or remote, just do, e.g.,

```
sage -f http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/7666/sagenb-0.5-7666b2.spkg
```
To revert to the "default" spkg (or another version), just do, e.g.,

```
sage -f $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/sagenb-0.4.9.spkg
```
(The default should already be part of the source distribution.)  Actually, `sage -advanced` also gives `sage -i thepackage.spkg` as a way to install an spkg.  The `-f` option forces a reinstall, even if the package is already installed.

As always, please let me know, if there are questions and/or problems.
