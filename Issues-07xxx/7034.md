Using

* Solaris 10 update 7 on SPARC
* sage-4.1.2.alpha2
* Sun Studio 12.1
* An updated configure script to allow the Sun compiler to be used #7021 

CC was set to the Sun C compiler, and CXX to the Sun C++ compiler, 


It would appear that Using PolyBoRi correctly uses the value of CXX as the C++ compiler, but will pass GNU specific options to that compiler.

```

PolyBoRi uses SCons, and the use of SCons in Sage seems to cause countless problems.

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
From polybori-discuss:
In fact, Sage forces PolyBoRi to do so. Sage's spkg contains a custom.py
file, which overwrites PolyBoRi's settings:
Looking at  polybori-0.6.3.r1647-20091028, one can see:

dreyer@lts035 [999] (0) [...patches]cat custom.py
import os
import sys

CCFLAGS=["-O3 -Wno-long-long -Wreturn-type -g -fPIC"]
CXXFLAGS=CCFLAGS+["-ftemplate-depth-100 -g -fPIC"]
[...]

The -W options can be dropped without any problems for all platforms.
But the remaining options were set intentionally in Sage, as far as I
know.  (I don't know the reason for -fPIC).
Does PolyBoRi compile with the sun-compiler, if -ftemplate-depth-100 and
-fPIC is dropped, i.e. if the two lines from custom.py read as follows:

CCFLAGS=["-O3 -g"]
CXXFLAGS=[""]
(previous line corrected since polybori-discuss)

In addition (see
http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/cmp_stlport_libCstd.html)
in order to have C++98 available, one has to build with  -library=stlport4 .

But there are still some lines of code (related to default template parameters), which do not compile using the solaris compiler. I'll try to sort this out.

Regards,
  Alexander
