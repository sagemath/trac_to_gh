As of sage-4.3.alpha0, there's a small typo in the help text you get by running sage -advanced: the line that starts with "-fixdoctest" should be "-fixdoctests", as the latter is the correct name for the command. This typo was introduced in #6354. The attached patch fixes this (apply to the repository in local/bin).
