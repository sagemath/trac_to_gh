it was decided that in a partition diagram a square should be called a cell instead of a box. The following patch implement this choice. In particular, the following methods are renamed:

- add_box -> add_cell, remove_box -> remove_cell, boxes -> cells

I also took the occasion to fix an indentation problem which prevents some doc to be correctly typeset, and to further rename:

- leg -> leg_length
- arm -> arm_length
- hook -> hook_length

Cheers,

Florent
