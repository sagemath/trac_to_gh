<a id='comment:1'></a>I'm not totally sure of how this should be done as I don't know the details of coercions, neither the details of the polynomial templating used.

At least, my patch doesn't break any doctest for me.

It touch for methods, the ones using _coerce_.

It test for parent equality before applying coercion. I also introduce a variable

`parent = (<Polynomial_template>self)._parent`

for readability.

<a id='comment:2'></a>The patch looks good and applies & doctests cleanly for me. However, we can do a little better. 

On my machine I get the following:

**Before**

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(3)[]
sage: p=x^100 + x^81 + x^67 + x^33 + 1
sage: q=x^10 + x^8 + x^6 + x^3 + 1
sage: timeit('p%q')
625 loops, best of 3: 193 µs per loop
```

**Patch**

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(3)[]
sage: p=x^100 + x^81 + x^67 + x^33 + 1
sage: q=x^10 + x^8 + x^6 + x^3 + 1
sage: timeit('p%q')
625 loops, best of 3: 26.6 µs per loop
```

With my incremental reviewer patch I get:

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(3)[]
sage: p=x^100 + x^81 + x^67 + x^33 + 1
sage: q=x^10 + x^8 + x^6 + x^3 + 1
sage: timeit('p%q')
625 loops, best of 3: 18.2 µs per loop
```

So, this is a positive review if someone reviews my reviewer patch.
