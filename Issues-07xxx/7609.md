This is fine, but there was another one in functions/trig.py (this on a 32-bit Macintel 10.5):

```
sage: float(cot(1))

Hi Karl-Dieter,

[attachment: trac_7609-pynac_numerical_noise.take2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7609/trac_7609-pynac_numerical_noise.take2.patch.gz) adds a fix for the error you get as well. It is a good coincidence that you're testing on that box. :)

Thanks.
