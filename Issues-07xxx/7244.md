The dicyclic groups are nonabelian groups of order 4n, n> 2.

With these added, it will be possible to easily construct every subgroup of order 8 and 12 as a permutation group, and then every subgroup of size 15 or less will be easy to construct.

Dicyclic groups are implemented as a new class in the named permutation groups collection.

The "quaternion group" is implemented by simply forming the dicyclic group of order 8.  The intent is that this small group is a good one for students to contrast with the other four groups of this order.

Karl-Dieter,

Thanks for the comments.  I've replaced the patch with a new one addressing your comments.

If you test building the docs will you see if you get the warning

```
/doc/en/reference/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.rst:: document isn't included in any toctree
```

This file really needs a workover, and probably shouldn't be in the docs as-is, but I'm not sure if the warning was there before, or if I've induced it.

Thanks,
Rob
