```
Hi all:

I found some strange behavior in solve that's related to function
composition.  Check out this short example.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.2, Release Date: 2009-10-24                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: var('x,t')
(x, t)
sage: f= function('f',x)
sage: e= {x:exp(t)}
sage: ft= f.subs(e); ft
f(e^t)
sage: Ft = t^2 + ft^2; Ft
t^2 + f(e^t)^2
sage: a= diff(Ft,t); a
2*e^t*f(e^t)*D[0](f)(e^t) + 2*t
sage: solve(a==0,diff(f,x).subs(e))
[D[0](f)(t) == -t*e^(-t)/f(e^t)]

Did you spot the strangeness?  Somehow diff(f,x).subs(e) became diff
(f,x).subs({x:t}) after solving.  Does anybody know how to fix this?

Alex

Submitted patch solves the problem described above

limitation and disadvantage of this patch are:

* it works for univariable functions only

* introduces new dummy variable into Maxima session

All comments are welcomed and any help appretiated

That's fine - that's still improving the previous situation, correct?  Looking at the code, it would be helpful to know what happens if params has more than one element - particularly in 

```
return "at(diff('%s(dummy_var_der), %s),dummy_var_der=%s)"%(f.name(), ", ".join(params), opnds[0]) 
```
it seems like one could have more items in the substitution tuple than there are %s to fill up, even if for some reason len(args)==1.  What is the relation between args and params - could there be more params than args?

Also, make sure to add a doctest showing that the NotImplementedError comes into play.  Search for 'Traceback' in the file to see how the doctests for errors look.

This is unfortunate, but probably unavoidable currently.  You should test whether this breaks anything in Maxima, but I don't see why it would.

My suggestion related to f.variables() does not work, since I cannot acces the variables inside the function derivative. 

The original patch does not work for something like diff(f(x,y),x).subs(x=3) so I updated it and tested for various combination how many variables are in the function, how many variables appear at the resulting expression, how many variables are substituted etc.

Perhaps could be improved for multivariable functions, but Maxima expression "at (expr, [eqn_1, ..., eqn_n])" cannot be translated to current Sage and both issues should be fixed together. Perhaps in this ticket? (leaving as needs_work, despite the fact that the original problem has been fixed and doctested)

Can you give an example of Sage command -> Maxima command -> Maxima output that would give rise to such a situation?  That should make it fairly straightforward to change the at function appropriately.

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A7):

> Can you give an example of Sage command -> Maxima command -> Maxima output that would give rise to such a situation?  That should make it fairly straightforward to change the at function appropriately.

I thought that this happens for taylor polynomial in more variables. However, it is not the case (btw. taylor polynomial in more variables seem to be not supported in Sage and I submited patch for #7472).

Hence I think that the problem is patched and if someone finds situation where she/he needs to enhace the functionallity, this can be solved in another ticket.

This causes a failure in sage/interfaces/maxima.py with this example

```
maxima(derivative(ceil(x*y*d), d,x,x,y))

since multivariate derivatives are not supported.

sage: solve(a==0,diff(f,x).subs(e))

As you say, e.g.

```
sage: x,y,=var('x y') 
sage: a = function('f', x, y).diff(x).subs(x=4).subs(y=8) 
sage: b=maxima(a); b

sage: b.sage()

Huh.  Maybe this is a side effect of making symbolic variables unique in Maxima?  Or the library interface?  I bet no one has looked at this for a *long* time.

Good point, I guess we can just add the doctests from the patch.

Two comments:
* use `a = function('f')(x,y).diff(x)` to avoid the confusing (and hopefully to deprecated) function('f',x,y).
* perhaps include an example that also tests the behaviour when the auxiliary variables aren't necessary:

```
sage: a = function('f')(x,y).diff(x)
sage: a
D[0](f)(x, y)
sage: maxima(a)
'diff('f(_SAGE_VAR_x,_SAGE_VAR_y),_SAGE_VAR_x,1)
```
since that also illustrates a template how to arrive at more user-friendly printing.
