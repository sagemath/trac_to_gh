As we will soon have a Flow function in Sage, the next step could be to write a Nowhere Zero flow function !

It should also be possible to define a flow over an abelian group, as they equivalently exist...

Depends on #24366

<a id='comment:14'>Comment 14:</a>
You are right, the returned digraph must be on the same vertex set.
I have pushed required changes.

However, the current solution does not pass test due to an issue in `orientations`:

```
sage: G = Graph(1)
sage: next(G.orientations())
Digraph on 0 vertices
```
I'm opening a ticket to fix that and put a dependency on ticket #24366. So we have to wait before finalizing this ticket.

Why? I don't see the point of waiting for the beta with the dependency to be released. I just merge in the branch, and let us continue with the review here.

I made a few more small tweaks. If my changes look good, then positive review.
