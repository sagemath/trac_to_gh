The code for running docstrings through Sphinx on-demand could be useful in other contexts:

* Command-line (cf. #6820).
* Notebook reST editor (cf. [The List](http://wiki.sagemath.org/SageUsability)).

Currently, the code lives in `cell.py`, but it would be easier to mantain and extend in `sage.misc`, say.
