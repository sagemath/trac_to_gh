```
- Changes "... done" to ". . . pass" in the output of TestSuite().run(verbose = True) to avoid unintentional matches
- Fix the doctests accordingly.
- Adds skip option; use it in sage/combinat/sf/jack.py and orthotriang.py
- In case of failure, execute the following tests after printing out a traceback, and write a summary at the end
- Only use verbose=True in the doctests when useful (category examples)


Rationale for the ...: when testing something in verbose mode the typical output of sage is:

```
   sage: P = Sets().example("inherits")
   sage: TestSuite(P).run(verbose=True)
   running ._test_an_element() ... done
   running ._test_element_pickling() ... done
   running ._test_not_implemented_methods() ... done
   running ._test_pickling() ... done
   running ._test_some_elements() ... done
```
And there is some risks that the "..." match something they should'nt I change them to ". . ."

Good spot :-)

I had already found a couple, and thought I had done a systematic search.

Fixed in the newly uploaded patch.

I just "discovered" `sage.misc.sage_unittest`.  In case it's of wider use: At #7390 there's a `unittest` HTML report generator that may make it into SageNB.
