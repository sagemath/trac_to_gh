It would be great if this worked:

```
            sage: t=var('t')                      
            sage: r=vector([t,t^2,sin(t)])
            sage: integrate(r,t)
            (1/2*t^2, 1/3*t^3, -cos(t))
            sage: integrate(r,(t,0,1))
            (1/2, 1/3, -cos(1) + 1)
```

Looks real good (and useful).

Builds fine, passes tests in sage/modules/module_element.py, behaves as expected, docs look good.

Positive review.
