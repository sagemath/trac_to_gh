<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
From Fernando Perez:

```
Actually no, not that hard: ipython executes all  user  code inside a
dict created at initialization time.  One could replace this (today a
plain python dict) with another dict that would implement the
requested behavior.  This would spring variables into existence when a
KeyError was about to occur.

The command-line doesn't have the notion of a cell (yet, that will
hopefully change soon) but it could be toggled with a function call.

It's basically a matter of instantiating the initial ipython with a
custom user_ns dict that does the above, that should be all.  And
providing a magic (or even plain) function in the global namespace to
toggle this behavior on/off at runtime.

The attached file (run it as 'ipauto.py') shows how it could work, I
didn't implement the toggling and it's a quick hack, but the basic
idea is  there.  Here it is in action:

In [1]: %autocall 0
Automatic calling is: OFF

In [2]: x+y
Injecting x
Injecting y
Out[2]: x + y

In [3]: type(x)
Out[3]: <class 'sympy.core.symbol.Symbol'>

In [4]: x+3
Out[4]: 3 + x

In [5]: x**2+x*x
Out[5]: 2*x**2

In [6]: x+z**3
Injecting z
Out[6]: x + z**3


A couple of notes:

- It's key to disable autocalling for this to work, otherwise too many
false positives are triggered.  If this idea proves to have  wings, it
will be one more argument in favor of disabling autocalling (it just
has too many uncontrollable side effects).

- Unfortunately IPython as shipped needs a tiny patch for this to
work, due to a really silly omission.  The patch is a trivial 2-liner,
in case anyone wants to take this further for Sage:
