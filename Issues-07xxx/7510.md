I found that Primes has no methods `is_finite`. This is actually not a problem of `Prime` but should be dealt in categories. I put a small patch here though i'm not sure we want to do this. Isn't this redundent with categories ?

For the second example, don't you want an EnumeratedSet and not a FiniteEnumeratedSet?
