<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

Here is the code for integral_elements_in_box line by line, up to the first place where PPC differs from Intel:

```
sage: K.<alpha> = NumberField(x^2-2)
sage: d = K.degree()
sage: Z_F = K.maximal_order()
sage: Foo = K.real_embeddings()
sage: B = K.reduced_basis()
sage: import numpy
sage: import numpy.linalg
sage: L = numpy.array([ [v(b) for b in B] for v in Foo])
sage: Linv = numpy.linalg.inv(L)
sage: C = [[0,5],[0,5]]
sage: Vi = [[C[0][0]],[C[0][1]]]
sage: 
sage: Linv

array([[ 0.5       ,  0.5       ],
       [-0.35355339,  0.35355339]])
sage: for i in range(1,d):
....:     Vi = sum([ [v + [C[i][0]], v + [C[i][1]]] for v in Vi], [])
....:     
sage: Vi
[[0, 0], [0, 5], [5, 0], [5, 5]]
sage: V = numpy.matrix(Linv)*(numpy.matrix(Vi).transpose())
sage: V

matrix([[  0.00000000e+00,   2.50000000e+00,   2.50000000e+00,
           5.00000000e+00],
        [  0.00000000e+00,   1.76776695e+00,  -1.76776695e+00,
           5.55111512e-17]])
```
In particular, the matrices Linv and Vi, even in their numpy versions, are still the same.  Essentially, on PPC (at least G4) the computation -0.35355339*5+0.35355339*5 is not (quite) zero, but on Intel it is.  On Intel we get the same stuff but with just 0., 2.5, etc - and the last entry is 0., no hint of the 5.55e-17.  

Anyway, this leads to the following error (since we are depending on the ceil of zero to be zero, but the ceil of 5.55e-17 is 1):

```
sage: while j < 2**d:
    for i in range(d):
        if V[i,j] < V[i,j+1]:
            V[i,j] = math.floor(V[i,j])
            V[i,j+1] = math.ceil(V[i,j+1])
        else:
            V[i,j] = math.ceil(V[i,j])
            V[i,j+1] = math.floor(V[i,j+1])
    j +=2
....:         
sage: V

matrix([[ 0.,  3.,  2.,  5.],
        [ 0.,  2., -2.,  1.]])
```
Where Intel correctly gives 0. in the last entry.

Just so that it's clear that PPC is the issue:

```
sage: matrix(Linv)*matrix(Vi).transpose()

[              0.0               2.5               2.5               5.0]
[              0.0     1.76776695297    -1.76776695297 5.55111512313e-17]
```
Slightly more digits, but same problem.  I can in fact do the computation completely in Sage (which I assume doesn't call numpy for matrix multiplication?) and get the same.  Note however that Sage CAN multiply correctly, as can Numpy:

```
sage: -0.35355339*5+0.35355339*5
0.000000000000000
sage: numpy.int(5)*numpy.float(-0.35355339)+numpy.int(5)*numpy.float(0.35355339)
0.0
```
So somehow it has to do with our matrix multiplication algorithm and how it works on PPC.  Perhaps there are other nasty bugs lurking as yet unseen.  Any thoughts?

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

The file "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_rel.py" has five functions, and only three of these have doctests. The problem in this ticket is with one these, which is an internal function not used elsewhere. From what I guess from the code, it is meant to be called with "inexact" bounds --- see the use of "eps_global".

So we might "heal" this internal function by using some kind of interval technique --- but the price could be high, i.e. slowing down the algorithm where this internal function is intended to be used.

I rather propose to heal the doctest by giving bounds [-0.1, 5.1] ... instead of [0, 5] ..., which most probably is far closer to the actual intended usage than the current doctest.

William, can you try 

```
sage: K.<alpha> = NumberField(x^2-2)
sage: d = K.degree()
sage: Z_F = K.maximal_order()
sage: Foo = K.real_embeddings()
sage: B = K.reduced_basis()
sage: import numpy
sage: import numpy.linalg
sage: L = numpy.array([ [v(b) for b in B] for v in Foo])
sage: Linv = numpy.linalg.inv(L)
sage: C = [[0,5],[0,5]]
sage: Vi = [[C[0][0]],[C[0][1]]]
sage: Linv # should be array([[ 0.5       ,  0.5       ],       [-0.35355339,  0.35355339]])
sage: for i in range(1,d):
....:     Vi = sum([ [v + [C[i][0]], v + [C[i][1]]] for v in Vi], [])
....:     
sage: Vi # should be [[0, 0], [0, 5], [5, 0], [5, 5]]
sage: V = numpy.matrix(Linv)*(numpy.matrix(Vi).transpose())
sage: V # should be matrix([[  0.00000000e+00,   2.50000000e+00,   2.50000000e+00,           5.00000000e+00],        [  0.00000000e+00,   1.76776695e+00,  -1.76776695e+00,           0.00000000e+00]]) but isn't on PPC, last element is e-17
sage: matrix(Linv)*matrix(Vi).transpose() # should be [              0.0               2.5               2.5               5.0] [              0.0     1.76776695297    -1.76776695297           0.0] but isn't on PPC
``` 
on cleo to see if (one of the) problem(s) there is also in matrix multiplication on itanium?   Just to clarify, at least one problem is that ceil(0)=0 but ceil(epsilon)=1.

You're gonna love this... on Intel Mac 10.5:

```
number_field/totallyreal_rel.py", line 76:
    sage: sorted(v)
Expected:
    [-1/2*a + 2, 1/4*a^2 + 1/2*a, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1/4*a^2 - 1/2*a + 5, 1/2*a + 3, -1/4*a^2 + 5]
Got:
    [-1/2*a + 2, 1/4*a^2 + 1/2*a, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1/4*a^2 - 1/2*a + 5, 1/2*a + 3, -1/4*a^2 + 5]
```
This is from the cubic field example.

Also, probably it would be good to directly confirm that the original bugbear is fixed, at the end of the first doctest:

```
sage: C = [[0-eps,5+eps],[0-eps,5+eps]] 
sage: v = sage.rings.number_field.totallyreal_rel.integral_elements_in_box(K, C) 
sage: sorted(v) [-alpha + 2, -alpha + 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, alpha + 2, alpha + 3]
```

The documentation clarifies things a lot, so +1 on that!

Grmpf.

The new patch version 2 tried to address the issues. In the cubic field example, the "5" should be in, so I enlarged the epsilon. This works "as is" on MacIntel OS X 10.4.11.

However, the patch version 2 does *not* work on MacPPC OS X 10.4.11, so this ticket has to stay "needs work".

Remark from John Voight:
"...what a mess!  I'm so sorry.  (Next time, feel free to contact
me earlier if there are issues with my code that I can be of help
with.)

The algorithm used is described in
 http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~voight/articles/ANTS144.pdf
in Section 3.1 (page 9), "Lattice points in boxes".  There is
absolutely a rounding issue which I can see as failing miserably in
low precision.  Off the top of my head, one might be able to fix the
issue by replacing a ceiling with a floor + 1, or even a ceiling +
1--but even then, this assumes the precision loss is so constrained...

I won't have a chance to work on the doctest until the weekend, but
it's in my queue now.
