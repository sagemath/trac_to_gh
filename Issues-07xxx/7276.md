will still fail however, there is a deeper problem lurking in that one point of a certain lattice sitting in a certain rectangle is missed in the computations on a PPC platform --- but that would be another ticket. Let the doctest fail for the time being, the enhancements by the patch(es) for this ticket here are needed anyway, I guess.

Here is the code for integral_elements_in_box line by line, up to the first place where PPC differs from Intel:

```
sage: K.<alpha> = NumberField(x^2-2)
sage: d = K.degree()
sage: Z_F = K.maximal_order()
sage: Foo = K.real_embeddings()
sage: B = K.reduced_basis()
sage: import numpy
sage: import numpy.linalg
sage: L = numpy.array([ [v(b) for b in B] for v in Foo])
sage: Linv = numpy.linalg.inv(L)
sage: C = [[0,5],[0,5]]
sage: Vi = [[C[0][0]],[C[0][1]]]
sage: 
sage: Linv

array([[ 0.5       ,  0.5       ],
       [-0.35355339,  0.35355339]])
sage: for i in range(1,d):
....:     Vi = sum([ [v + [C[i][0]], v + [C[i][1]]] for v in Vi], [])
....:     
sage: Vi
[[0, 0], [0, 5], [5, 0], [5, 5]]
sage: V = numpy.matrix(Linv)*(numpy.matrix(Vi).transpose())
sage: V

matrix([[  0.00000000e+00,   2.50000000e+00,   2.50000000e+00,
           5.00000000e+00],
        [  0.00000000e+00,   1.76776695e+00,  -1.76776695e+00,
           5.55111512e-17]])
```
In particular, the matrices Linv and Vi, even in their numpy versions, are still the same.  Essentially, on PPC (at least G4) the computation -0.35355339*5+0.35355339*5 is not (quite) zero, but on Intel it is.  On Intel we get the same stuff but with just 0., 2.5, etc - and the last entry is 0., no hint of the 5.55e-17.  

Anyway, this leads to the following error (since we are depending on the ceil of zero to be zero, but the ceil of 5.55e-17 is 1):

```
sage: while j < 2**d:
    for i in range(d):
        if V[i,j] < V[i,j+1]:
            V[i,j] = math.floor(V[i,j])
            V[i,j+1] = math.ceil(V[i,j+1])
        else:
            V[i,j] = math.ceil(V[i,j])
            V[i,j+1] = math.floor(V[i,j+1])
    j +=2
....:         
sage: V

matrix([[ 0.,  3.,  2.,  5.],
        [ 0.,  2., -2.,  1.]])
```
Where Intel correctly gives 0. in the last entry.

Just so that it's clear that PPC is the issue:

```
sage: matrix(Linv)*matrix(Vi).transpose()

[              0.0               2.5               2.5               5.0]
[              0.0     1.76776695297    -1.76776695297 5.55111512313e-17]
```
Slightly more digits, but same problem.  I can in fact do the computation completely in Sage (which I assume doesn't call numpy for matrix multiplication?) and get the same.  Note however that Sage CAN multiply correctly, as can Numpy:

```
sage: -0.35355339*5+0.35355339*5
0.000000000000000
sage: numpy.int(5)*numpy.float(-0.35355339)+numpy.int(5)*numpy.float(0.35355339)
0.0
```
So somehow it has to do with our matrix multiplication algorithm and how it works on PPC.  Perhaps there are other nasty bugs lurking as yet unseen.  Any thoughts?

The file "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_rel.py" has five functions, and only three of these have doctests. The problem in this ticket is with one these, which is an internal function not used elsewhere. From what I guess from the code, it is meant to be called with "inexact" bounds --- see the use of "eps_global".

So we might "heal" this internal function by using some kind of interval technique --- but the price could be high, i.e. slowing down the algorithm where this internal function is intended to be used.

I rather propose to heal the doctest by giving bounds [-0.1, 5.1] ... instead of [0, 5] ..., which most probably is far closer to the actual intended usage than the current doctest.

The output on itanium (cleo) is exactly the same as on PPC above.  I.e., I get "last element is e-17".  

So is there a bug somewhere in the algorithm that assumes some floating point number is 0.0, but really it might just be epsilon sometimes, and this is revealed on PPC and Itanium. 

NOTE: Our PPC box is *big endian*.  Our Itanium is *little endian*.  So this is not just an endianess issue.

Attachment [trac_7276.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket7276/trac_7276.patch) by @williamstein created at 2009-11-10 06:27:25

I have attached a patch that does what Georg suggested above.  I also added more doctests (i.e., a cubic example) to explain what the mysterius "C" is.   With this patch, doctests pass on ppc, itanium, and x86_64 now. 

I've also emailed John Voight asking him to get the docs of this file up to snuff.

You're gonna love this... on Intel Mac 10.5:

```
number_field/totallyreal_rel.py", line 76:
    sage: sorted(v)
Expected:
    [-1/2*a + 2, 1/4*a^2 + 1/2*a, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1/4*a^2 - 1/2*a + 5, 1/2*a + 3, -1/4*a^2 + 5]
Got:
    [-1/2*a + 2, 1/4*a^2 + 1/2*a, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1/4*a^2 - 1/2*a + 5, 1/2*a + 3, -1/4*a^2 + 5]
```
This is from the cubic field example.

Also, probably it would be good to directly confirm that the original bugbear is fixed, at the end of the first doctest:

```
sage: C = [[0-eps,5+eps],[0-eps,5+eps]] 
sage: v = sage.rings.number_field.totallyreal_rel.integral_elements_in_box(K, C) 
sage: sorted(v) [-alpha + 2, -alpha + 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, alpha + 2, alpha + 3]
```

The documentation clarifies things a lot, so +1 on that!

Grmpf.

The new patch version 2 tried to address the issues. In the cubic field example, the "5" should be in, so I enlarged the epsilon. This works "as is" on MacIntel OS X 10.4.11.

However, the patch version 2 does *not* work on MacPPC OS X 10.4.11, so this ticket has to stay "needs work".

Remark from John Voight:
"...what a mess!  I'm so sorry.  (Next time, feel free to contact
me earlier if there are issues with my code that I can be of help
with.)

The algorithm used is described in
 http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~voight/articles/ANTS144.pdf
in Section 3.1 (page 9), "Lattice points in boxes".  There is
absolutely a rounding issue which I can see as failing miserably in
low precision.  Off the top of my head, one might be able to fix the
issue by replacing a ceiling with a floor + 1, or even a ceiling +
1--but even then, this assumes the precision loss is so constrained...

I won't have a chance to work on the doctest until the weekend, but
it's in my queue now.

JV"
