We just need to add them to sage/devel/sage/misc/functional.py.  Modifying the versions of integrate/integral in that file would probably be easiest.

Replying to [ryan](#comment%3A3):

No, this is an existing method of symbolic functions, which uses a different algorithm to get a numerical integral.  But you can only call it in 

```
sage: f(x)=some_formula_with_x
sage: f.nintegrate(...)
```
not as a top-level

```
nintegral(f,...)
```
type function.  

We should also probably make the syntax like that of `numerical_integral` *and* make that syntax consistent (at least as an option) with that of `integral` itself (see ask.sagemath.org for various problems this causes).

There are two issues with this.  First, because of the extreme possibility for confusion with the already top-level `numerical_integral`function, this will need some work in documentation.  See some of the documentation in 

```
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.nintegral??
```
for what I mean.   I don't think all of that needs to be there, but there should then be a reference for how to access the rest of it.  Basically, Maxima numerical integration and GSL numerical integration are different.  In particular, one would want to use Maxima for symbolic expressions - in case there is an exact answer known! - and then have a variety of options for numerical integration if that fails.

Anyway, that was a longish digression.  More importantly, this patch doesn't exactly do what is asked.   The point isn't to be able to approximate exact answers to integrals, but rather to expose to the top level the Maxima integration.  

```
sage: a = e^(-x^4 + x)
sage: a.nintegral(x,0,1)
(1.3638178766496709, 1.5141420080518571e-14, 21, 0)
sage: integral(a,(x,0,1)).n()
1.3638178766496716
```
Note the slight difference in output, incidentally - presumably within the error tolerance, of course.  This is because we apparently have a THIRD way to evaluate integrals - Pynac!

```
sage: R = RealField(53)
sage: integral(a,(x,0,1))._convert(R)
1.3638178766496716
```

Anyone have ideas for what the best resolution on this would be?

Oh, and just for comparison:

```
sage: numerical_integral(a,0,1)
(1.3638178766496716, 1.5141420080518571e-14)

There are two different inconsistency 

numerical_integral is top level only function and it uses gsl

nintegral is not top level and uses maxima

for consistency purpose I was thinking of doing the following:

1. to both add algorithm input, (the default would be gsl for top level and maxima for non-top level)

2. make both functions top level and methods

Any thoughts?

This comment still applies.

Another interesting thing is the use of `*args` and `**kwds`.  Really, we expect only a few cases of args, and only one keyword.  I think the syntax for this should be like for symbolic integrals, e.g. `f.integrate(algorithm="mathematica_free")` - that is to say, maybe it should be `algorithm` instead of `alg`.  Maybe even specifically check the args?  I don't know.

The private function `_numerical_integral` needs documentation.

```
#This is so the old numerical_integral will still work
```
is not quite accurate, as it's doing more than that :)

I'm not sure whether the Mma or sympy ones actually will return numerical values.  Also, one should doctest all those options.

What is the idea with calling the other numerical integral (from Maxima) `_nintegral_sym`, since it's not symbolic?  Maybe I'm missing something.

I think you now have `Note that in exotic cases` twice in the same docstring - is that correct?

Anyway, all doable things, and the final produce will be quite valuable.

I have read this line several time and can't figure out what it is trying to say, perhaps someone else can tell me what it should be. 
   There should be better formatting (`Examples::` should be capitalized, for example),

Fixed

 and hopefully links to the functions put in - see the plotting functions, especially plot.py, for examples of how to do that in Sphinx.

I tried to make the lines shorter, but the html file looked wierd. Html file formats each line and wraps it around. If I make them them shorter the documentation doesn't come out right.

Actually, there are several different sets of keywords depending on the algorithm provided. 

 I think the syntax for this should be like for symbolic integrals, e.g. `f.integrate(algorithm="mathematica_free")` - that is to say, maybe it should be `algorithm` instead of `alg`.  Maybe even specifically check the args?  I don't know.

The reason I went with alg, was that for alg="gsl", algorithm is one of the keywords already being used.

I tested mma and you are right it gives an error, though the actual function it is calling makes it seem like it should work.

Sympy, however does return numerical values for symbolic functions with closed form. 

Added doctest for all algorithms

This used to be nintegral and is imported by symbolic.integration for f.nintegral. I kept this because it has different output than numerical_integral (both old and new)

This was already there, I will read the documentation for that function and see if it is still needed.

This is still open, but if one uses integral instead of numerical_integral it works. Since the result until the numerical values are inputed is not numeric, but a function in x, and y , numerical_integral should perhaps not be used.

I mean like <code>:func:\`~sage.plot.plot.plot\`</code> referring to the function `plot`; one can do the same here, I think.
