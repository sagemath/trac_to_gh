While developing a command called transform_plot3d, that generalized ploting in diferent coordinate systems, Jason Grout suggested to me that such a command would be better implemented within plot3d.

I agreed to that, so I propose an adition to plot3d's syntax: "plot3d(function,var1range,var2range,transformation=None,**kwds)" where transformation is a 4-tuple containing 3 functions of arity 3, and a variable which is to be interpreted as the function to be ploted. Like this (r*cos(fi),r*sin(fi),z,r), so the function will be ploted as r.

Examples can be found in [http://www.sagenb.org/home/pub/1328/](http://www.sagenb.org/home/pub/1328/).

I've just added a patch.

The patch I just attached represents my initial work on this issue. I added Oscar's code to plot3d() to implement the transformation keyword parameter, and I added the two new plotting functions spherical_plot3d and cylindrical_plot3d.

I made some minor changes to the original code. I moved the formulae for the transformations for spherical and cylindrical coordinates out of the body of plot3d, and into the bodies of spherical_plot3d and cylindrical_plot3d, since I thought that was a better place for them. I also added some error handling; the urange and vrange given to plot3d may be 2-tuples, in which case the variables are implicit -- but we expect urange[0] and vrange[0] to be the plot variables.

We need to add some documentation for the new features. I think I can draw upon the examples Oscar provided in his published worksheets to create doctests for the new functions. Oscar, could you help me come up with descriptions of cylindrical_plot3d and spherical_plot3d for use in their docstrings? And more examples are always helpful.

I haven't been able to do a thorough review yet, but in general I agree that this looks very nice!  Everything below should be interpreted as nitpicking; however, because of the last item (doctests) I must put this as 'needs work'.

In spherical_plot3d, it is a 'drop' of water, not a 'drom'.

In plot3d where the transformations are added, should it be

```
elif adaptive:
```
or 

```
if adaptive:
```
That is, does transformation exclude adaptive?  If so, this should be documented.  Also, shouldn't

```
+    from sage.symbolic.callable import is_CallableSymbolicExpression
```
be done only if transformation is not None?

The `@`interact doctests don't really make sense in the command-line format.  I tried them nonetheless, and it popped up a bunch of jmol windows - looked nice!  But there must be a better way to doctest this; perhaps just A;B;C;D;E or something.

Also, why are Cylindrical and Spherical imported in plot3d/all.py?    It's not clear to me why someone would want that available but not just use e.g. spherical_plot3d or just import Spherical if they really needed it? 

Also, doctests are needed for the abstract classes, and (for readability) a blank line between methods wouldn't hurt.

I think transformation excludes adaptive since parametric_plot3d doesn't support adaptive plots. I'll make sure to document this.

Sure. I don't see how that really matters though, since its just an import statement.

> The `@`interact doctests don't really make sense in the command-line format.  I tried them nonetheless, and it popped up a bunch of jmol windows - looked nice!  But there must be a better way to doctest this; perhaps just A;B;C;D;E or something.

How about `show(A + B + C + D + E)` in the TESTS section below?

> Also, why are Cylindrical and Spherical imported in plot3d/all.py?    It's not clear to me why someone would want that available but not just use e.g. spherical_plot3d or just import Spherical if they really needed it?

This is one of the major features of the transformation system. You can use spherical_plot3d, which will graph a function r in terms of phi and theta, or you can specify transformation=Spherical() which lets you choose the dependent and independent variables.

For example,

```
plot3d(..., transformation=Spherical('phi', ['r', 'theta']))
```
will graph a function phi in terms of r and theta. So basically you get more flexibility by using Spherical(). Is there a way I could make that clearer in the documentation?

> Also, doctests are needed for the abstract classes, and (for readability) a blank line between methods wouldn't hurt.

Okay.

Most of the changes seem fine.  I am still confused about this, though.  Isn't

```
sage: spherical_plot3d(e^-y,(x,0,2*pi),(y,0,pi))
```
already allowing one to use a different name for the variables?  

Ah, I think I see.  There are six different possibilities for order of independent variables and the dependent variable, and you want to allow all of these - it that it?  Maybe you should make it clearer that this is what is going on by saying that it's not the names, but rather which one is the dependent variable, you are changing - in fact, that the names look the same only to preserve the usual terminology - and then adding to

```
      sage: Spherical('theta', ['r', 'phi']) 
      Spherical coordinate system (theta in terms of r, phi) 
```
by actually plotting something with this.  

Also, in line 623, I think it should be

```
   sage: var('r,u,v')
``` 
instead of r, u, u; I am surprised this doesn't give a doctest failure (I didn't get a chance to run that right now).

Is it ok if I make it still 'needs work' to just clarify these?  For most users it will all be irrelevant, of course, but if we are really going to import Spherical() at the top level, then it should be very clear what the point is.

One more point that I thought of when trying to use this feature.  Why should I have to specify the names of variables more than once?  Introspection should be able to get these from my gen_transform function.  It seems like I should be able to do this:

```
class Cylindrical(sage.plot.plot3d.plot3d._CoordTrans):
    """
    Some docs for the mathematical definitions of the variables
    """
    def gen_transform(self, radius=None, azimuth=None, height=None):
        return (radius * cos(azimuth),
                radius * sin(azimuth),
                height)
```

and things should just work.  all_vars can be inferred from the keyword arguments to gen_transform.  It's pretty easy to come up with a good default _name (i.e., 'name of class (variables) coordinate system').

Jason,
I've taken a look at your code and you've done a great job of cleaning this up! I can't find any fault with it. Apply the following patches to Sage 4.3.3: trac-7872-polish.patch, trac_7872_new-all.patch. Applies fine and passes all doctests.

Now which one of us should mark this as a positive review, or should we bring in a 3rd party?

Apply the patches in this order, though: trac_7872_new-all.patch, trac-7872-polish.patch.

There is precedent for two people collaboratively writing and reviewing each other's code as being okay.  Since you've passed off on my code, and I've passed off on your code, I'll mark this as positive review.  olazo: can you look at this as well, and if you find a problem, change it back to needs work?
