Using implicite coercion and then calling monomials might cause a segmentation fault. This is a side effect.

```
K.<rho> = NumberField(x**2 + 1)
R.<x,y> = QQ[]
p = rho*x
q = x
p.monomials()
 ...
q.monomials()
 ...
p.monomials()
 Segmentation Fault
```

Going back to line 5 you can avoid this by

```
p.parent()(p).monomials()
 ...
q.parent()(q).monomials()
 ...
p.parent()(p).monomials()
 ...
```
This might be used as a workaround.

If no implicite coercion is involved, everything works fine, i.e. use

```
R.<x,y> = K[]
```

This is most probably related to #6160.

This segfaults because the `monomials()` method doesn't set the current ring. attachment:trac_7152-monomials_cring.patch contains the fix.
