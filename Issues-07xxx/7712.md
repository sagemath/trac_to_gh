Consider the following example:

```
sage: P.<y,z> = PolynomialRing(RealIntervalField(2))
sage: Q.<x> = PolynomialRing(P)
sage: C = (y-x)^3
sage: C(y/2)
0
```
I do not understand why the result is 0. In fact there are two
errors:
(i) the result is a polynomial of degree 3 in y, thus y<sup>3</sup> should appear
(ii) the result should "contain" the exact result which is 0.125*y<sup>3</sup>, thus it should be c*y<sup>3</sup> where c is an interval containing
0.125. Compare the following with a precision of 10 bits:

```
sage: P.<y,z> = PolynomialRing(RealIntervalField(10))
sage: Q.<x> = PolynomialRing(P)
sage: C = (y-x)^3
sage: C(y/2)
0.12500?*y^3
```

Depends on #13760

Normally, both calls should return an object of type "Real Interval Field", isn't it?
(If necessary, I can open a different trac ticket for both issues.)

Replying to [@zimmermann6](#comment%3A3):
>    C=C.subs(xk=R(0),sk1=R(1))

The two polynomials obtained here are constants.
The strange behaviour about the type comes from line 153 of

`sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py`

where we find:

```
        try:
            K = x[0].parent()     <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
        except AttributeError:
            K = self.parent().base_ring()
        y = K(0) 
        for (m,c) in self.element().dict().iteritems():  
            y += c*misc.mul([ x[i]**m[i] for i in range(n) if m[i] != 0])
```

I don't know exactly why, but It first try to take the type of the first input (here Integer 0) and this type is then changed only by coercion when doing the computation.

With precision 391 the polynomial is null and no operations are performed, so the results stays Integer.

I would say this is a bug but maybe there is a purpose behind this.

Hey Paul and Guillaume,

For future reference, just mark the patch as duplicate in the milestone dropdown and set it to *needs_review*.

#13760 does seem to fix the problem:

```
sage: method2(391)
0.?e-8
sage: _.parent()
Real Interval Field with 391 bits of precision
```

Best,

Travis
