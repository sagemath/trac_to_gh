I think *part* of the problem could be line 294 of sagenb.interfaces.expect:

       s = s.strip().rstrip(self._prompt)


Replacing this with

       s = s.rstrip(self._prompt)

appears to restore the expected spacing.  But quitting and reopening the
worksheet puts

1      1      1
    2      4      8
    3      9     27
    4     16     64

in the output cell.  I think the problem here is line 910 (or so) of
sagenb.notebook.cell:

           out = '///\n' + out.strip()


Replacing this with

           out = '///\n' + out.strip('\n')

seems to solve this problem.  It also makes the text representation of
the worksheet more compact.

Note: I haven't tested these changes extensively.
