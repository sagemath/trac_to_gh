On slow machines (or even fast ones), building all the documentation for a build which will not be used for general purposes takes a looooong time.  But even [the install guide part about documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/documentation.html) doesn't mention `make build` to avoid this.

This ticket is to improve the install guide so that things are documented more fully.  See [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html?#section-make) for current make targets documented.

* Install guide for documentation should mention `make doc` and `make build` and `make doc-clean`.
* Make targets section should include `make clean`, `make install`, `make logs`, `make doc-clean`, `make -k` for ignoring errors, and others not there from [the Makefile](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/Makefile) - and if some of those shouldn't be documented, that's okay, but just to say why on this ticket
* Same section should have a link to the `make ssl` section
* Be sure to mention in that section `make -jNUM` (it's elsewhere but not there)` and link to how to set `MAKE` to have that standard

It would also be good to have more links from the developer guide to the installation guide, for instance about this.

Another option might be an environment variable 'NO_DOCUMENTATION' or similar. I was about to update sage-env to handle a lot more environment variables. This could be added. The biggest problem is chaning every single packaging that builds the documentation. Adding a switch or compiler variable is the easy part!
