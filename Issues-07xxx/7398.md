<div id="comment:0"></div>

The following mantra occurs at three places in Sage's code to test whether v is an iterator:

```
     if hasattr(v, 'next'):
```
This is not quite correct since some sage objects have a next method without being iterable, or with a different semantic. 

Let me quote python's doc:

> The iterator objects themselves are required to support the following two methods, which together form the iterator protocol:

 
>  iterator.__iter__()::
> 

     Return the iterator object itself. This is required to allow both containers and iterators to be used with the for and in statements. This method corresponds to the tp_iter slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.

> iterator.next()::
> 

    Return the next item from the container. If there are no further items, raise the StopIteration exception. This method corresponds to the tp_iternext slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.


Therefore here is the good way to test if an element is an iterator:

```
    try:
        return it is iter(it)
    except:
        return False
```
Note: it is not sufficient to check for the existence of the methods since some sage object implement `__iter__` to raise a `NotImplemented` exception !

The patch trac_7398_iter_detect-fh.3.patch broke something in graph_generators. 
the patch trac_7398_combclass_set_compat-fh.patch should fix it. 

Apply those two patches in that order.

Cheers,

Florent
