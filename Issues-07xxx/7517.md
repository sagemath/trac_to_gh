The ring ZZ[x] is not a principal ideal domain (e.g., the ideal (2, x) isn't principal), so xgcd *can't* in general return polynomials s, t such that g = s*a+t*b.    A simple example is a=2*x and b=x^2. Then x is the gcd, but you can't write x as a ZZ[x] linear combination of 2*x and x^2, since the linear term of s*(2*x) + t*x^2 is even. 


What it does return is the next best thing, which is s, t such that 

   s*a + t*b = resultant(a,b), 

assuming a, b are coprime (if they aren't, rescale so they are, do the above, then multiply through). 

Note that Sage just calls the FLINT library, and this behavior of xgcd is documented there. 

I did just maybe (?) find a bug in FLINT though (and certainly one in sage):
sage: gcd(Q(2),x^2)
1
sage: xgcd(Q(2),x^2)
<hang forever> 

Doing the same using NTL works fine:
sage: Q.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,implementation="NTL")
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_integer_dense_ntl.Polynomial_integer_dense_ntl'>
sage: gcd(Q(2),x^2)
1
sage: xgcd(Q(2),x^2)
(4, 2, 0)
sage: xgcd(x-2, x^3+2*x^2)
(16, -x^2 - 4*x - 8, 1)

So, the docs in Sage need to change to correctly define xgcd over a non-PID.  Also, there is maybe a serious bug in FLINT.
