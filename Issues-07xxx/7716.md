Adds features to the sage-coverage script.

* rewrite for modularity and easier addition of features
* changes the score of the file to reflect the presence or absence of a TestSuite.run or equivalent test.
* adds option to check cdef'd functions
* adds option to check docstrings on classes
* adds option to check for the existence of INPUT block
* adds option to check that parameters are all listed in the INPUT block.
* adds option to check for the existence of OUTPUT block

So that we don't bring our coverage level way down, these aren't turned on automatically.  Instead, they can be invoked from the command line by using options ( -cdefs, -classes, -input, -output and -params)

Resolves #1795 and #5859

The current ticket might conflict with #8699.

What if a function does not return anything, but uses "return" to exit from the function in the middle? From looking at the patch it seems to me that it will be reported as "bad".

Overall looks good.  A few comments: It doesn't look like this will detect Sphinx/reST markup for input and output, as described [here](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings) -- a block like

```
:param x: the length of the rectangle
:type x: float
:param w: the width of the rectangle
:type w: float
:return: the area of the rectange
:rtype: float
```
Or am I missing something?

Also, as I've said on #4323, it takes a certain amount of hubris, or maybe (as mabshoff pointed out) just a strong sense of irony, to put functions with no docstrings into a file like "sage-coverage".

Finally, I couldn't get it to apply cleanly, either.  When applying to the scripts repository in 4.3.rc0, I got the message

```

Maybe the patch is broken/corrupt?  It starts

```
# HG changeset patch

Adds features to the sage-coverage script.

- rewrite for modularity and easier addition of features
...
```
then line 604 is suddenly:

```
# HG changeset patch

Adds features to the sage-coverage script.

- rewrite for modularity and easier addition of features
- changes the score of the file to reflect the presence or absence of a TestSuite.run or equivalent test.
...
```

which involves exactly the same changeset comment and changes to the same file (sage-coverage).

Anyway, I'm pretty confused by this, and can't even referee it.

Yeah, I don't know what that was.  Here's a new patch (against 4.3.rc0) that gets rid of the weird double header problem.  7716_coverage.patch should be applied first, then 7716_underscores.patch

It doesn't need to be rebased against 4.3, since there are no changes to sage-coverage or sage-coverageall since 4.3.rc0.  William, are you up for reviewing this now that it should apply?

Some issues:

- sage-coverageall doesn't deal with unrecognized options well, since it just parses the output from sage-coverage.  So if you pass an unrecognized option, it ends up saying "No files in ...".  Instead of doing

```
    r = os.popen('sage -coverage %s * | grep SCORE'%opt).readlines()
```
 we should probably set P to be the process and check its return status before asking for its output.

- the options should work with either one or two hyphens.

- We should have a "--help" option for sage-coverage which does the same thing as running sage-coverage with no arguments: print the usage.  I think we should also expand this usage message.

I'm attaching a "diff" which makes these changes.  I haven't looked at the rest of the code in detail yet, but I may soon.
