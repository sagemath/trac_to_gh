I have created an enhanced and updated version of openopt. It is a pre release of the next 0.28 release (revision 404). Once 0.28 is released, upgrade should be easy. 

1. it now consists of 3 packages, all togehter are called the "OO-Suite". and hence I've included all three.
2. I have to disable the preparser `preparser(False)` to get examples for all three packages working.

I've updated openopt's spkg to 0.28 which you can find here:
[openopt spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/schilly/sage/spkg/)

it contains the entire openopt suite and as stated above, you need to set `preparse(False)` and then test it via a script like 
[nsp_1.py](http://trac.openopt.org/openopt/browser/PythonPackages/OpenOpt/openopt/examples/nsp_1.py) .
