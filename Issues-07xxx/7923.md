When 2<sup>31</sup> < q<sup>2</sup> < 2<sup>32</sup>, one can get an overflow in exponentiation 
(because of the use of signed vs unsigned ints).

This occurs for q=3<sup>10</sup>.

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(3^10)
sage: b = a^9 + a^7 + 2*a^6 + a^4 + a^3 + 2*a^2 + a + 2
sage: b^(71*7381) == (b^71)^7381
False
```

This is based against 4.3.rc0 and the patch 7585_ALL.patch, but that will only change relative positioning, so it should apply with just a shift.
