I don't think sage should have it's own implementation if the one of Boost is fast enough. 
You can give it a try, but I'm not sure you can produce something faster than `'Floyd-Warshall_Boost'`.

Note that we already have a (slow) Python implementation `'Floyd-Warshall-Python'` for weighted graphs, and a Cython implementation `'Floyd-Warshall-Cython'` but for unweighted graphs only.

I added the `Floyd-Warshall` implementation of `SciPy`. It's working well but it's not as fast as expected. In fact, most of the time is wasted in turning the graph to a Numpy array and then turning the results to required dict of dicts.

```
sage: D = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(30, .33)
sage: for u, v in D.edges(labels=False):
....:     D.set_edge_label(u, v, randrange(100))
sage: %time _ = D.shortest_path_all_pairs(by_weight=True, algorithm='Floyd-Warshall_Boost')
CPU times: user 6.44 ms, sys: 517 µs, total: 6.96 ms
Wall time: 6.56 ms
sage: %time _ = D.shortest_path_all_pairs(by_weight=True, algorithm='Floyd-Warshall_SciPy')
CPU times: user 30.2 ms, sys: 1.85 ms, total: 32 ms
Wall time: 30.6 ms

When you look at the code of scipy (for instance, https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/sparse/csgraph/_shortest_path.pyx), the input parameter is always

```
    csgraph : array, matrix, or sparse matrix, 2 dimensions
        The N x N array of distances representing the input graph.
```
You can also check method `validate_graph` in https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/sparse/csgraph/_validation.py. It may convert from one matrix format to another.
