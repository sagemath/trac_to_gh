This would not be terribly hard to do using the python wave module.  See this interact for a basic demo:

It would be good to wrap this functionality in a more user-friendly command.

Nice! Wow, I wasn't expecting a reply from one of the core Jupyter developers ;-) though I guess he WAS one of the original people on this ticket :-)

Maybe this ticket can then just be adding this to a likely place in the documentation.
