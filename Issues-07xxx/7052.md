Playing around with some graphs I noticed that even though the graph below (the McGee graph) not is bipartite, it is claimed to have chromatic number 2 (This should be 3).

The error seems to be in the calculation of the chromatic polynomial, as there is no chromatic root (x-2) in the factorization of the chromatic polynomial, which is then used to say that there exists 2-colorings of the graph.


Code to reproduce:

```
G = Graph({0:[1,12,23], 1:[0,2,8], 2:[1,3,19], 3:[2,4,15], 4:[3,5,11],\
            5:[4,6,22], 6:[5,7,18], 7:[6,8,14], 8:[1,7,9], 9:[8,10,21], 10:[9,11,17],\
            11:[4,10,12], 12:[0,11,13], 13:[12,14,20], 14:[7,13,15],\
            15:[3,14,16], 16:[15,17,23], 17:[10,16,18], 18:[6,17,19], 19:[2,18,20], 20:[13,19,21],\
            21:[9,20,22], 22:[5,21,23], 23:[0,16,22]})
print G.is_bipartite()
print G.chromatic_number()
print G.chromatic_polynomial().factor()
```
Output from code above:

```
False

(x - 1) * x * (x^22 - 35*x^21 + 595*x^20 - 6545*x^19 + 52360*x^18 -

Figured out the cause of the miscalculations. Coefficients of the chromatic polynomial are saved as 32-bit integers in Sage, so numbers larger than 2,147,483,647 will come out wrong.

Comparison of the computed chromatic polynomial for the McGee graph using Sage and using a program made by Pearce and Haggard[1]:

Chromatic polynomial using Pearce:

```
x^24 - 36*x^23 + 630*x^22 - 7140*x^21 + 58905*x^20 - 376992*x^19 +
1947760*x^18 - 8346686*x^17 + 30245418*x^16 - 93999140*x^15 +
253180660*x^14 - 595401630*x^13 + 1228477234*x^12 - 2229115744*x^11 +
3556493741*x^10 - 4973964734*x^9 + 6058278383*x^8 - 6356758192*x^7 +
5650054983*x^6 - 4146754706*x^5 + 2415720549*x^4 - 1046958944*x^3 +
299392840*x^2 - 42167160*x
```

Using Sage:

```
x^24 - 36*x^23 + 630*x^22 - 7140*x^21 + 58905*x^20 - 376992*x^19 +
1947760*x^18 - 8346686*x^17 + 30245418*x^16 - 93999140*x^15 +
253180660*x^14 - 595401630*x^13 + 1228477234*x^12 + 2065851552*x^11 -
738473555*x^10 - 678997438*x^9 + 1763311087*x^8 - 2061790896*x^7 +
1355087687*x^6 + 148212590*x^5 - 1879246747*x^4 - 1046958944*x^3 +
299392840*x^2 - 42167160*x
```

If we now look at the coefficients for x^11 we see that the difference between them is 

```
2065851552 - (-2229115744) = 4294967296 = 2^32
```
i.e  32-bit integer.

solution: replace int with long long in suitable places in /sage/graphs/chrompoly.pyx so that 64 bits are used to describe each coefficient value (long won't suffice, as it is only 32-bit)

Attaching a patch that changes relevant variables to long long, as well as adding the McGee graph to named graphs as a doctest to show that the changes give a correct answer (the chromatic number should be 3).

Found the wonderful graphs.LCFGraph() function, so it became clear to me that a constructor for the McGee graph was redundant, when a simple graphs.LCFGraph(24, [12,7,-7], 8) worked just as fine.

New version of the patch just changes int to long long at the necessary places, and adds a test of the value of the chromatic polynomial at x=2, to see that it is 0 now.

Changing priority to major, as this clearly will happen to any graph that is sufficiently large.
