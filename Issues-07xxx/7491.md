```
sage: solve([x==x],x)
```
gives an exception.

Maxima says this:

```
$ maxima -q
(%i1) solve([x=x],x);
(%o1)                                 all
(%i2) 
```

There is a short [discussion](http://groups.google.cz/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ce3a256a9102c7fc) about this topic.

Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: solve
sage: y=var('y');solve(SR(0),y,solution_dict=True)
{y: r1}
sage: y=var('y');solve(SR(0),y,solution_dict=True,multiplicities=True)
