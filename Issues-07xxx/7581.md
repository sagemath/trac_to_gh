The attached patch makes things slightly faster.

**Before**

```
sage: R1 = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',10001,order='lex')
sage: R2 = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',10002,order='deglex')
sage: x10000 = R1('x10000')
sage: %time a = R2(x10000)
CPU times: user 5.77 s, sys: 0.18 s, total: 5.95 s
Wall time: 7.54 s
sage: %time a = R2(x10000)
CPU times: user 5.43 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 5.43 s
Wall time: 5.59 s

sage: x10001 = R2('x10001')
sage: %time x10000 + x10001
CPU times: user 16.87 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 16.87 s
Wall time: 17.05 s
x10000 + x10001
sage: %time x10000 + x10001
CPU times: user 5.43 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 5.43 s
Wall time: 5.49 s
x10000 + x10001
```

**After**

```
sage: R1 = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',10001,order='lex')
sage: R2 = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',10002,order='deglex')
sage: x10000 = R1('x10000')
sage: %time a = R2(x10000)
CPU times: user 1.18 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 1.34 s
Wall time: 1.36 s
sage: %time a = R2(x10000)
CPU times: user 0.87 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.87 s
Wall time: 0.92 s

sage: x10001 = R2('x10001')
sage: %time x10000 + x10001
CPU times: user 7.67 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 7.67 s
Wall time: 7.77 s
x10000 + x10001
sage: %time x10000 + x10001
CPU times: user 0.86 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.87 s
Wall time: 0.91 s
x10000 + x10001
```

I haven't run doctests yet.

Sorry, but neither of the patches applies to a fresh build of sage-4.3.alpha0.

But it could actually be that my sage-4.3.alpha0 has a problem. After building it, I did
  ./sage -clone infinitepoly
waited 8 hours, but it wasn't finished. It seems that it hanged while trying to do the documentation. Eventually, I pressed Ctrl-C (was needed several times). 

The clone seemed to work, though. But:

```
sage: hg_sage.import_patch('patches/singular_prcopyr_no7577.patch')
cd "/home/SimonKing/sandbox/sage-4.3.alpha0/devel/sage" && hg status

```

OK, back, ./sage -br main.

```

abort: outstanding uncommitted changes
```

OK, what are the changes?

```
sage: hg_sage.diff()
cd "/home/SimonKing/sandbox/sage-4.3.alpha0/devel/sage" && hg diff  | less
(END)
```

No changes, then, but there are uncommitted changes. Frustrating.

Conclusion: I can not give a positive review, of course, but the problem seems to be deeper, so, it isn't "needs work" either. I'll mark it "needs review".

Hi Martin!

Replying to [@malb](#comment%3A7):
> The repository in 4.3.alpha0 is borked, try `hg status`, it will point out two files which are missing. Then create those files (i.e. `touch /path/to/filename`) afterwards, importing should work.

I followed the advices that [Minh](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/11f432ca0302189e) gave. However, there were problems applying the "no7577" patch. 

It simply does not work.

```

So, it is a fresh 4.3.alpha0

```
sage: hg_sage.status()

I don't see what I did wrong here. So, I guess it is "needs work".

I tried to modify the files manually, and I think I found the problem.

Apparently your version of sage/libs/singular/singular-cdefs.pxi that you based your patch on is *not* the version in sage-4.3.alpha0.

Namely, sage/libs/singular/singular-cdefs.pxi only has 930 lines, while your patches start at line 963 and 973, respectively.

So, can you please provide a new patch?

Cheers,

Simon

`sage -testall` passes. 

Your patch provides a strong improvement. However, genuine Singular is match faster:

```
> system("--ticks-per-sec",1000);
> ring r1 = 0, (x(1..10000)),dp;
> poly p = x(10000);
> ring r2 = 0, (x(1..10001)), dp;
> int t = timer;
> poly q1 = imap(r1,p);
> timer-t;
410
> poly q2 = fetch(r1,p);
> timer-t;
430
```

So, 0.41s for imap and only 0.02s for fetch, in a situation where (even with your patch) Sage needs 5.43s! And I think imap does exactly what one needs in element conversion -- I mean, take a variable from one ring and return the variable with the same name in another ring.

Is it possible to wrap imap in libsingular? This would probably yield a drastic improvement (factor 10?).

But I guess this should be a different ticket, and since your patch does provide a good improvement, I give it a positive review.

There is no button for "positive review"? Well, I guess I first have to change it into "needs review", and then push the button...

Cheers,
Simon

Double oops. I have my children in the office and am a bit distracted.

OK.

We have 

```
> system("--ticks-per-sec",1000);
> ring r1 = 0, (x(1..10000)),dp;
> poly p = x(10000);
> ring r2 = 0, (x(1..10001)), dp;
> int t = timer;
> imap(r1,p)+x(10001);
x(10000)+x(10001)
> timer-t;
410
```

while we have (with your patch)

```
sage: R1 = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',10001,order='deglex')
sage: R2 = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',10002,order='deglex')
sage: x10000 = R1('x10000')
sage: x10001 = R2('x10001')
sage: %time R2(x10000) + x10001
CPU times: user 0.74 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.74 s
Wall time: 0.73 s
x10000 + x10001
```

I think this is equivalent to what I did in Singular. In other words, your patch is not far from native Singular.

This confirms my positive review.

Cheers,

Simon
