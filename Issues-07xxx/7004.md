Latest version of the patch on:
http://combinat.sagemath.org/hgwebdir.cgi/patches/file/tip/trac_7004-graphviz-nt.patch
and followups

Using the graphviz interface requires graphviz to be installed on the
machine, as well as a dot2tex spkg which can be installed with:

```
sage -f http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/dot2tex-2.8.7-dev.spkg
```

From the patch description:

* Refactors the graph layout code:

* Add a new main graph.layout() method, to be called by plot, plot3d, latex, graph_editor, ...

* The various graph layout algorithms spread over the graph code are systematically reorganized into as many layout methods that can be called from layout():

* graph.layout_circular()
* graph.layout_spring()
* graph.layout_tree()
* graph.layout_ranked()
* graph.layout_acyclic()
* graph.layout_planar()
* graph.layout_default()

* Extends the graphviz_string method (latex labels) and refactors its logic to make it simpler for subclasses

* Slightly simplifies the handling of default values for graph.latex_options

* Visible user change: graph_editor, plot3d, ... all accept the same layout options.

* Implements an interface to dot2tex/graphviz:

* Define a new layout method .layout_graphviz() implemented by calling dot2tex and graphviz

* Implement an alternative implementation of latex for graphs by delegating all the work to dot2tex (GraphLatex.dot2tex_picture)

* Makes some fixes to the poset code:
  * __repr__ -> _repr_
  * _latex_ by calling latex on the internal element

* Moved the level_sets method from HasseDiagram to DirectedGraph Reimplemented to support properly non acyclic graph. It should be quite faster (it just goes through the graph, without modifying it).

TODO, for this ticket or a later one:

* Double check all the logic to make sure it is backward compatible
   - Done for the latex part (Rob)

* What should be the default layout algorithm?
  * Planar layout when the graph is planar (not yet: the planar
    layout is not that nice looking; postponed for later when
    planar+spring will be implemented)
  * acyclic if acyclic
  * spring otherwise

* The spring option for ranked layouts does not work nicely:

```
     sage: G = posets.IntegerPartitions(5).hasse_diagram()
     sage: G = DiGraph({1:(2,3), 2:[4], 3:[4]})            # alternative example
     sage: G.plot(layout="acyclic_dummy", spring = True)
```

   to be compared with:

```
      sage: G.plot(layout="acyclic_dummy")
      sage: G.plot(layout="spring")
```

   Thinking twice about it, this seems to be inherent. See the comments in the code.


* Find a better name for acyclic_dummy. Once the spring layout will be functional, this could be set to the default value, and the layout renamed to acyclic_spring.

* Choose a good option name for the direction of growth of acyclic layout, an a good default value. Merge this with the option for tree layout (tree_orientation).
  * orientation = "up" (as for tree) ?
  * rankdir = "BT" (as in graphviz)?

* A lot of code is doing things very similar to dot2tex. Maybe things could be merged.

* Implement the various options for both latex constructions (tikz or dot2tex)

* Implement the default layout of standard graphs using a default_layout method rather than at construction time.

+Latest version of the patch on:  http://combinat.sagemath.org/hgwebdir.cgi/patches/file/tip/trac_7004-graphviz-nt.patch
 
+This also requires graphviz and a dot2tex spkg available from: 
+
+http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/dot2tex-2.8.7.spkg
+
+From the patch description:
+- Refactors the graph layout code:
+
+  - Add a new main graph.layout() method, to be called by plot,
+    plot3d, latex, graph_editor, ...
+
+  - The various graph layout algorithms spread over the graph code
+    are systematically reorganized into as many layout methods that
+    can be called from layout():
+
+     - graph.layout_circular()
+     - graph.layout_spring()
+     - graph.layout_tree()
+     - graph.layout_ranked()
+     - graph.layout_acyclic()
+     - graph.layout_planar()
+     - graph.layout_default()
+
+  - Extends the graphviz_string method (latex labels)
+    and refactors its logic to make it simpler for subclasses
+
+  - Slightly simplifies the handling of default values for
+    graph.latex_options
+
+  - Visible user change: graph_editor, plot3d, ... all accept the
+    same layout options.
+
+- Implements an interface to dot2tex/graphviz:
+
+  - Define a new layout method .layout_graphviz() implemented by
+    calling dot2tex and graphviz
+
+  - Implement an alternative implementation of latex for graphs
+    by delegating all the work to dot2tex (GraphLatex.dot2tex_picture)
+
+- Makes some fixes to the poset code:
+  - __repr__ -> _repr_
+  - _latex_ by calling latex on the internal element
+
+  - Moved the level_sets method from HasseDiagram to DirectedGraph
+    Reimplemented to support properly non acyclic graph. It should be
+    quite faster (it just goes through the graph, without modifying it).
+
+TODO, for this ticket or a later one:
+
+- Double check all the logic to make sure it is backward compatible
+
+- graph_editor was using iterations=1000 as default. Was there a
+  reason? If yes, do we want to set this up as default value for all
+  layouts?
+
+- What should be the default layout algorithm?
+
+   - Planar layout when the graph is planar
+   - acyclic if acyclic
+   - spring otherwise
+
+- The spring option for graded layouts does not work. Could someone
+  please debug this?
+
+    sage: G = posets.IntegerPartitions(3).hasse_diagram()
+    sage: G.plot(layout="acyclic_dummy")
+    sage: G.plot(layout="acyclic_dummy", spring = True)
+
+- Find a better name for acyclic_dummy. Once the spring layout will
+  be functional, this could be set to the default value, and the
+  layout renamed to acyclic_spring.
+
+- Choose a good option name for the direction of growth of acyclic
+  layout, an a good default value. Merge this with the option for
+  tree layout (tree_orientation).
+
+  orientation = "up" (as for tree) ?

+- A lot of code is doing things very similar to dot2tex. Maybe things
+  could be merged.
+
+- Implement the various options for both latex constructions (tikz or
+  dot2tex)
+
+- Implement the default layout of standard graphs using a

Looks like the first if of `set_pos` needs an `else` clause. But this wasn't the problem you indicated.

<a id='comment:15'></a>All graphs used to plot as square plots, whether you wanted them to or not. This would stretch any plot into a square, so if the relative distances were larger in one dimension than in the other, this would not show in the plot.

The following adjustment seems to improve the situation a bit, but I'm really not sure what the "right" fix is here.

An important option that I did not find

* be able to modifiate the layout

It could be nice to have pointers in the documentation:

* more documentation for the method .set_latex_options()... at least a list of options (or is it available somewhere else)
* have a view(G, ...) example somewhere in the docstring of the object or in the set_latex_options one.

<a id='comment:21'></a>> It's not clear from the graph documentation that we can use latex for the output. It could be clearer to have a link in the docstring of the plot method or in the one of the object (Graph or DiGraph) itself.


The documentation is quite clear and complete but in an "hidden" file: sage.graphs.graph_latex

The refactorization of the code is really good, I will just talk about the graphviz, string and latex possibilities. Perhaps for other tickets...

1) __graph to text conversion__

There is different standards format for string representations of graph objects. At least two or three
* graphml (http://graphml.graphdrawing.org) which uses XML
* dot (http://www.graphviz.org) which was created by graphviz
* xdot which is can be considered as an extension of dot with non standard options

From now, there exists a method graphviz_string. Could we prefer a dot_string ? and in the same manner think about a graphml_string ?
The main problem with those two names is that there does not start with the same prefix... and we get a contradiction with the use of the tab completion. As the refactorization for layout is perhaps we can consider string_dot and string_gml ? and string(format='dot') string(format='gml')

2) __latex generation__

There is a intersection between the two format of GraphLatex (which is written in the description). dot2tex is able to produce a lot of different format...

Couldn't we prefer in the GraphLatex file some different methods

* picture_tikz
* picture_pstricks
* which can also be used from picture(format='tikz') picture(format='pstricks')

and have an option inside picture_tikz to consider whether we use dot2tex or we use the actual code ?

3) __latency__

It took one second to execute in a console

```
neato -Txdot my_graph.dot | dot2tex -ftikz | pdflatex
```

And almost one minute for

```
sage: G = MyGraph()
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex')
sage: view(G)
```

Do you have an idea where the time is lost ?

4) __graph editor__

There is a java program which can be used to interact with graphviz: http://www.dynagraph.org/
The program is made of two things dynagraph and grappa. It could be really nice to have an applet inside the notebook to use it directly as graph_editor works !!

It is available under the Common Public License

Yup. Note that there already exists methods graph6_string
sparse6_string, and so on.

The ..._string convention is followed consistently; so it might be a
bit late to change it. On the other hand, it could be nice indeed to
have a string(format='...') method

I see all those methods as internal (actually, maybe they should start
with _), while the main entry point for the user is the latex method.
With this in mind, each picture_* method should concentrate on a
specific task (creating a tikz picture manually / creating a picture
by calling dot2tex), whereas all the dispatching job should go in the
latex method.

I would not mind if the latex method would take extra arguments (as a
shortcut to calling set_latex_options).

Ah, interesting! On extra thing that dot2tex does it to run latex on
each node to get the dimension of its bounding box. In principle, this
is done in one swoop for all nodes, so that should not be that bad. So
we should check whether it is dot2tex or the interface to dot2tex
which is to be blamed. Could you give me your example and/or run the
dot2tex script on it?

+Latest version of the patch on:  http://combinat.sagemath.org/hgwebdir.cgi/patches/file/tip/trac_7004-graphviz-nt.patch
+
+Using the graphviz interface requires graphviz and a dot2tex spkg available from:
+
+http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/dot2tex-2.8.7.spkg
+
+From the patch description:
+
+* Refactors the graph layout code:
+
+* Add a new main graph.layout() method, to be called by plot, plot3d, latex, graph_editor, ...
+
+* The various graph layout algorithms spread over the graph code are systematically reorganized into as many layout methods that can be called from layout():
+
+* graph.layout_circular()
+* graph.layout_spring()
+* graph.layout_tree()
+* graph.layout_ranked()
+* graph.layout_acyclic()
+* graph.layout_planar()
+* graph.layout_default()
+
+* Extends the graphviz_string method (latex labels) and refactors its logic to make it simpler for subclasses
+
+* Slightly simplifies the handling of default values for graph.latex_options
+
+* Visible user change: graph_editor, plot3d, ... all accept the same layout options.
+
+* Implements an interface to dot2tex/graphviz:
+
+* Define a new layout method .layout_graphviz() implemented by calling dot2tex and graphviz
+
+* Implement an alternative implementation of latex for graphs by delegating all the work to dot2tex (GraphLatex.dot2tex_picture)
+
+* Makes some fixes to the poset code:
+  * __repr__ -> _repr_
+  * _latex_ by calling latex on the internal element
+
+* Moved the level_sets method from HasseDiagram to DirectedGraph Reimplemented to support properly non acyclic graph. It should be quite faster (it just goes through the graph, without modifying it).
+
+TODO, for this ticket or a later one:
+
+* Double check all the logic to make sure it is backward compatible
+   - Done for the latex part (Rob)
+
+* What should be the default layout algorithm?
+  * Planar layout when the graph is planar (not yet: the planar
+    layout is not that nice looking; postponed for later when
+    planar+spring will be implemented)
+  * acyclic if acyclic
+  * spring otherwise
+
+* The spring option for ranked layouts does not work nicely:
+
+\`\`\`
+     sage: G = posets.IntegerPartitions(5).hasse_diagram()
+     sage: G = DiGraph({1:(2,3), 2:[4], 3:[4]})            # alternative example
+     sage: G.plot(layout="acyclic_dummy", spring = True)
+\`\`\`
+
+   to be compared with:
+
+\`\`\`
+      sage: G.plot(layout="acyclic_dummy")
+      sage: G.plot(layout="spring")
+\`\`\`
+
+   Thinking twice about it, this seems to be inherent. See the comments in the code.
+
+
+* Find a better name for acyclic_dummy. Once the spring layout will be functional, this could be set to the default value, and the layout renamed to acyclic_spring.
+
+* Choose a good option name for the direction of growth of acyclic layout, an a good default value. Merge this with the option for tree layout (tree_orientation).
+  * orientation = "up" (as for tree) ?
+  * rankdir = "BT" (as in graphviz)?
+
+* A lot of code is doing things very similar to dot2tex. Maybe things could be merged.
+
+* Implement the various options for both latex constructions (tikz or dot2tex)
+
+* Implement the default layout of standard graphs using a default_layout method rather than at construction time.

+Latest version of the patch on:
+http://combinat.sagemath.org/hgwebdir.cgi/patches/file/tip/trac_7004-graphviz-nt.patch
+and followups
+
+Using the graphviz interface requires graphviz to be installed on the
+machine, as well as a dot2tex spkg which can be installed with:
+
+\`\`\`
+sage -f http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/dot2tex-2.8.7-dev.spkg
+\`\`\`
+
+From the patch description:
+
+* Refactors the graph layout code:
+
+* Add a new main graph.layout() method, to be called by plot, plot3d, latex, graph_editor, ...
+
+* The various graph layout algorithms spread over the graph code are systematically reorganized into as many layout methods that can be called from layout():
+
+* graph.layout_circular()
+* graph.layout_spring()
+* graph.layout_tree()
+* graph.layout_ranked()
+* graph.layout_acyclic()
+* graph.layout_planar()
+* graph.layout_default()
+
+* Extends the graphviz_string method (latex labels) and refactors its logic to make it simpler for subclasses
+
+* Slightly simplifies the handling of default values for graph.latex_options
+
+* Visible user change: graph_editor, plot3d, ... all accept the same layout options.
+
+* Implements an interface to dot2tex/graphviz:
+
+* Define a new layout method .layout_graphviz() implemented by calling dot2tex and graphviz
+
+* Implement an alternative implementation of latex for graphs by delegating all the work to dot2tex (GraphLatex.dot2tex_picture)
+
+* Makes some fixes to the poset code:
+  * __repr__ -> _repr_
+  * _latex_ by calling latex on the internal element
+
+* Moved the level_sets method from HasseDiagram to DirectedGraph Reimplemented to support properly non acyclic graph. It should be quite faster (it just goes through the graph, without modifying it).
+
+TODO, for this ticket or a later one:
+
+* Double check all the logic to make sure it is backward compatible
+   - Done for the latex part (Rob)
+
+* What should be the default layout algorithm?
+  * Planar layout when the graph is planar (not yet: the planar
+    layout is not that nice looking; postponed for later when
+    planar+spring will be implemented)
+  * acyclic if acyclic
+  * spring otherwise
+
+* The spring option for ranked layouts does not work nicely:
+
+\`\`\`
+     sage: G = posets.IntegerPartitions(5).hasse_diagram()
+     sage: G = DiGraph({1:(2,3), 2:[4], 3:[4]})            # alternative example
+     sage: G.plot(layout="acyclic_dummy", spring = True)
+\`\`\`
+
+   to be compared with:
+
+\`\`\`
+      sage: G.plot(layout="acyclic_dummy")
+      sage: G.plot(layout="spring")
+\`\`\`
+
+   Thinking twice about it, this seems to be inherent. See the comments in the code.
+
+
+* Find a better name for acyclic_dummy. Once the spring layout will be functional, this could be set to the default value, and the layout renamed to acyclic_spring.
+
+* Choose a good option name for the direction of growth of acyclic layout, an a good default value. Merge this with the option for tree layout (tree_orientation).
+  * orientation = "up" (as for tree) ?
+  * rankdir = "BT" (as in graphviz)?
+
+* A lot of code is doing things very similar to dot2tex. Maybe things could be merged.
+
+* Implement the various options for both latex constructions (tikz or dot2tex)
+
+* Implement the default layout of standard graphs using a default_layout method rather than at construction time.
