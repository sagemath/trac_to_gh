With the attached patch, the precondition for registering a new
coercion from P to Q with register_coercion becomes: 

 "no coercion into P has been queried, or no coercion from P to Q has been registered or discovered earlier"

Which is a bit weaker than the previous:

 "no coercion into P has been queried"

This should still be quite safe, while covering all the formerly
problematic practical use cases coming up in the category code #5981.

I think is probably okay.  After thinking about it for a bit, I could come up with a situation where this change would make the coercion graph non-commutatitve.

I'll run all the tests with it here in a bit.

There is one way this can go wrong. Suppose one has B -> C, and one wants to register A -> B. If A -> C was previously requested, its non-existence will be cached. 

Now I don't think this will be an issue in practice, nor does `_unset_coercions_used` solve it.

With the updated patch register_coercion also does not bark if _coercions_used is false.

Otherwise, this triggered to failing doctests in sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_module.py
and sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_morphism.py. An expert should investigate why a coercion gets registered twice in those modules, and whether this is not a bug. But I vote for postponing that for later.

I agree.

So, is this positive review?
