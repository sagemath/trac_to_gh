With the attached patch, the precondition for registering a new
coercion from P to Q with register_coercion becomes: 

 "no coercion into P has been queried, or no coercion from P to Q has been registered or discovered earlier"

Which is a bit weaker than the previous:

 "no coercion into P has been queried"

This should still be quite safe, while covering all the formerly
problematic practical use cases coming up in the category code #5981.

I'll run all the tests with it here in a bit.

Now I don't think this will be an issue in practice, nor does `_unset_coercions_used` solve it.

Otherwise, this triggered to failing doctests in sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_module.py
and sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_morphism.py. An expert should investigate why a coercion gets registered twice in those modules, and whether this is not a bug. But I vote for postponing that for later.

I agree.

So, is this positive review?
