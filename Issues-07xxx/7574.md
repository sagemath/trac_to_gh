There are a few issues with the MIP code:
* ``max`` and ``min`` are built-in core functions in Python and shouldn't be used as variable names
* ``id`` shouldn't be used as a variable name
* I don't think we should have ``try: foo except: bar`` blocks without a specific ``except ThisandThatError``.

Component: **numerical**
