Use the plot_points option.  Type "parametric_plot3d?" for more details:

        -  ``plot_points`` - (default: "automatic", which is
           75 for curves and [40,40] for surfaces) initial number of sample
           points in each parameter; an integer for a curve, and a pair of
           integers for a surface.
        
Note that the documentation output by "plot3d?" doesn't even mention the plot_points option, which is why you're confused.
