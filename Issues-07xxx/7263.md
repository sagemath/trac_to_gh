I replicated the following with a fresh build under Linux and OS X too.  Basically *all* plotting of 3d jmol plots at the command line is broken!  The notebook works fine.  This is serious.

```
I'm having trouble with jmol from the command line in 4.1.2 and
4.2.alpha0.  E.g.,
sage: var('A,B,C')
(A, B, C)
sage: implicit_plot3d(sin(A)*cos(B)+sin(B)*cos(C)+sin(C)*cos(A),
(A,-2*pi,2*pi),(B,-2*pi,2*pi),(C,-2*pi,2*pi))
does nothing.  Adding .show() also fails, and quicker.  On
alpha.sagenb.org I don't have the same problems (though sometimes I
get the featureless black box), so I think it may be a command-line
issue.  Any ideas? I do NOT get this in 4.1.1.  I am on a MacIntel
running OSX 10.5.

What happened to the jmol application?

Also, how come jmol and the java3d viewer aren't their own spkgs?
