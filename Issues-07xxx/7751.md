This patch includes algorithms for the Bruhat order, Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, improvements to the `__repr__` method of WeylGroup elements, and other enhancements.

Mike Hansen is working on an interface to coxeter3, which is be able to compute Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials rather faster. However I think this patch still contains things that are needed.

For discussion see this thread:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/d324f6fcb6d2a436?hl=en

This patch depends on #7753 and #7754.

I made a minor change so that the Kazhdan-Lusztig computation doesn't
hang in the affine case. I've only done much testing for finite Weyl groups
but I suppose it is correct in the affine case.

Looks good.  Here are a few comments.  After these are addressed, I'll be happy to give this a positive review.

* `sage/combinat/kazhdan_lusztig.py`
  * typo in your e-mail address.
  * the method of determining KL._base_ring_type seems a little strange.  Why not use is_Polynomial and isinstance(q, LaurentPolynomial)?
  * KazhdanLusztigPolynomial should inherit from SageObject.  That allows pickling, etc.

* `sage/combinat/root_system/weyl_group.py`
  *In `WeylGroup_gens`, `__classcall_` needs another trailing underscore.  Include a doctest to make sure that this feature works!
  * Can you include a doctest in `WeylGroupElement.__repr__`?  I know it's tested elsewhere, but...

In general, do you have a reason to use `__call__` explicitly, rather than parentheses?  Similarly, you don't need to explicitly call __repr__: using %s in a string will do that for you automatically.

Patch review: trac_7751

This patch implements Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials and R-polynomials associated to pairs of Weyl group elements in arbitrary type using standard recursive formulas.  I have verified the results of this code against the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials produced by GAP/Chevie for all pairs of elements in finite type A_4.  I also verified this code against GAP/Chevie for all pairs in affine type A_2 (having 3 generators) for all pairs of elements with Coxeter length less than or equal to 5.  This patch correctly implements useful mathematics and the documentation includes references to relevant mathematical literature.
