From this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/c0543314ff9c15cb) thread:

```
By the way, I discovered accidentally that from the command line (not
the notebook) if you type:

sage: ed   # or %ed or %edit

then it opens up your favorite editor (whatever is set by the $EDITOR
shell variable).  Then in the editor you can type

def FF(x):
    long definition here
    which would be really annoying
    to type on the command line

then save it -- it gets written to a temporary file -- and the code
gets executed and you have thus redefined FF.  Then later you can do

sage: ed FF

and it will let you modify your code.  This is an ipython feature, it
seems.  Should it be described somewhere in the Sage documentation?
```
The following commands should at least be documented in the Developers' Guide together with explanation on how to use them for interactive development:

1. `load` --- see `sage.misc.interpreter`
2. `attach --- see `sage.misc.interpreter``
3. `iload` --- see `sage.misc.interpreter`
4. `ed`
5. `%ed`
6. `%edit` --- see the [IPython manual](http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/manual/html/config/editors.html)
7. `edit()` --- see `sage.misc.edit_module.edit`

Some of those commands -- the % ones -- come from IPython, right? If so, we should find where their documentation is online and link to that, along with some brief descriptions of useful commands. One that I like is `!clear` which simply clears the screen.
