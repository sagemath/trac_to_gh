* It seems that auto-indentation was already broken in IE8.  V9 does not fix the problem.

* Possible CSS problem: The rendered completions menu is just two columns (not characters) wide in IE8 and O10.

* On introspection:  I think I've reproduced most of the standard behavior.  New: Pressing `TAB` for explicitly requested docstrings or source code toggles between both.

A pre-existing bug:

* "Evaluate All" cells in a worksheet.
* Evaluate the last cell.
* A new cell is not automatically inserted in the notebook.
* Reload to see the new cell.

?  It seems the client and server cell lists are out of sync.  This might explain the "spontaneously appended cell" phenomenon.

mpatel asked if I would test this package.  Some observations follow,  Firefox 3.5.6 on Kubuntu 9.10.

1.  ESC on introspection seems to be working (a great addition!).  First time I hit ESC it didn't seem to have effect, then next tab-completion was weird, then all subsequent uses of ESC worked fine.  Opened a new worksheet, and several uses of ESC worked fine.  So maybe just once per server session?

2.  Formatted labels are working in interacts, but now I don't see any output.  Three different interacts, no output at all.  Controls are functional though, so it is not hung.

3.  Was testing resizing cells on paste:

(a) paste into a new cell, hit edit key and the pasted text is gone.

(b) this one took me a while
- make a new cell, type a space, then type a sentence almost to the far end of the cell.

- resize browser window by grabbing right edge and dragging left (slowly)

- resize until just the last word of sentence wraps to a new line.

- cell doesn't resize and second line is hidden

- hit edit, cancel changes, see cell is now sized right

- click into cell, it sizes wrong again


Without a space at the start of the line, sometimes there's no problem.  Notice if you keep sliding the window edge, and push two words onto the next line, the sizing comes back to being right.

Thanks for your detailed feedback!

I think the JavaScript compressor *may* be so aggressive that it's changing the semantics of the code.  Could you try this (but don't bother if it's too much trouble):

* Insert `debug_mode = False` just before `_cache_javascript = None` in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb-0.5-py2.6.egg/sagenb/notebook/js.py`.
* Restart the server, clear the browser's cache, and test ESC and `interact`s again.

> 3.  Was testing resizing cells on paste:

This should be easy to fix by also sending the input to the server just after the paste event.
> (b) this one took me a while

I've noticed this, too.  The server code and JS library use different methods to (re)size a cell.  The server does the sizing just before it sends the worksheet to the browser (e.g., on first display, after exiting "Edit" mode, etc.), but the browser resizes in between.  I don't know how easy it is to reconcile the methods, but I'll definitely take a closer look.

V4 should make it so a cell is resized and saved about 0.25 seconds after a paste event -- using no delay at all is too fast, apparently.

I think unifying the client and server resize methods should be a separate ticket.  Neither of the current methods is optimal.  The server assumes 80-column-wide input cells.  The browser suffers from the problem described above.

I'm not sure what to do about the compressor.  See #7787 and [sage-notebook](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/msg/7ad2a17f4e0cc972) for potential options.
