This depends on #7514. 


College teacher often say that by far the biggest obstruction to people switching from Maple to Sage is that:


 (1) symbolic variables don't magically spring into existence when used

 (2) one has to use object oriented notation---foo.bar(...)---to access methods of an object.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I have created a "mock up" of the above functionality, for people to play with, which doesn't even require applying a patch.  Just paste the following into a Sage notebook cell and press shift-enter:

```
class MagicVar(Expression):

    def eval(self, s, globals, locals=None):
        x = preparse(s).strip()
        y = x.split('\n')
        if len(y) == 0:

        s = '\n'.join(y[:-1]) + '\n'
        t = y[-1]
        try:

        except SyntaxError:
            s += '\n' + t
            z = None
        while True:
            try:    
                self._eval_code(s, z, globals)
            except NameError, msg:
                nm = msg.args[0].split("'")[1]
                globals[nm] = MagicVar(SR, var(nm))
            else:

    def _eval_code(self, s, z, globals):
        eval(compile(s, '', 'exec'), globals, globals)
        if z is not None:
            eval(z, globals)
        
magic = MagicNames()                 
```

Now if you put %magic at the top of an input cell, then symbolic variables magically spring into life, and object oriented notation is not necessary.   There isn't an easy way to make this permanent for all cells in a worksheet (without putting %magic) without actually changing the sage library with a patch.  This is because of a major annoying mistake I found just now (see #7483).

<a id='comment:3'></a>Here is a session (to be used in the notebook) that illustrates automatic_names:

```
sage: automatic_names(True)
sage: x + y + z + wxy
wxy + x + y + z
sage: y(y=10)
10
sage: type(y)
<class 'sagenb.misc.support.AutomaticVariable'>
sage: trig_expand((2*x + 4*y + sin(2*theta))^2)
4*(sin(theta)*cos(theta) + x + 2*y)^2
sage: type(trig_expand)
<class 'sagenb.misc.support.AutomaticVariable'>
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(y)
<class 'sagenb.misc.support.AutomaticVariable'>
```

Notice above that trig_expand, y, and theta were all automatically created.  Notice that substitution `y(y=10)` still works.   If an object obj had a y method, then y(obj) would be evaluated as obj.y().

Here's a test showing that we avoid infinite loops:

```
sage: raise NameError
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError
sage: raise NameError, "'var'"
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: Too many automatic variable names and functions created (limit=10000)
```
