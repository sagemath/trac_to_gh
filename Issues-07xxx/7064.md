On a fresh compiled Sage 4.1.2.alpha4, building the HTML version of the reference manual resulted in the following warnings:

```
WARNING: /scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.2.alpha4/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/numerical/knapsack.py:docstring of sage.numerical.knapsack.knapsack:69: (WARNING/2) Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

```
This should be fixed before releasing the upcoming rc0. I have made this ticket a blocker for 4.1.2. The HTML version of the reference manual should build without any warnings. See also ticket #6916 for a patch to fix the first warning. The remaining three warnings are due to #6177.
