On a fresh compiled Sage 4.1.2.alpha4, building the HTML version of the reference manual resulted in the following warnings:

```

This should be fixed before releasing the upcoming rc0. I have made this ticket a blocker for 4.1.2. The HTML version of the reference manual should build without any warnings. See also ticket #6916 for a patch to fix the first warning. The remaining three warnings are due to #6177.
