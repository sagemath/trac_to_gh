With the default color settings in IE8, this makes an active cell's background bluish-grey (lower contrast) but an inactive cell's background is white (higher contrast).  Many users may expect the opposite.  We may get comments.

I'm leaving this closed and will merge it into SageNB 0.7.

Perhaps a better patch would be to leave the "background-color" white and set the "color" to black.
