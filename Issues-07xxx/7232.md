I was upgrading Sage on sagenb.org to the new version (sage-4.1.2)., which took about an hour today.  Unfortunately, I didn't do the rather complicated dance of upgrading a different install, shutting down sagenb.org, starting it with the other install, etc.   This meant that sagenb.org was unstable for about 30 minutes.

This is not Sage segfaulting but the Tachyon subprocess.
I.e., the Sage process is not segfaulting.  It is running the Tachyon ray tracer on a certain input file, and that ray tracer is crashing.  
    
As a workaround, you can use Sage's own parametric_plot command instead of using the Tachyon object: 

a = 1; b = 0; c = 0
var('t')

f = ((a*c*cos(t) - b*sin(t))/sqrt(a^2+b^2), 
     (b*c*cos(t) + a*sin(t))/sqrt(a^2+b^2), cos(t)*sqrt(a^2+b^2))

parametric_plot(f, (t,0,2*pi))

If you want it rendered with Tachyon, you can do:

parametric_plot(f, (t,0,2*pi), viewer='tachyon')

Regarding the Tachyon segfault, it's not special to the notebook -- it happens on my other Sage installs and even happens on OS X:
...
sage: t.show()
sh: line 1:  2106 Segmentation fault      tachyon /Users/wstein/.sage//temp/flat.local/2053//tmp_2.dat -format PNG -o /Users/wstein/.sage//temp/flat.local/2053//tmp_1.png > /dev/null

This is a bug that was introduced in the Sage-4.1 --> Sage-4.1.1 release cycle (so 2-3 months ago).   It doesn't happen in sage-4.1, but it does in sage-4.1.1.   The Tachyon spkg 

   tachyon-0.98beta.p9.spkg

is the same in all cases, so the problem must be with the input that is being sent to Tachyon.   Indeed, the script being fed into Tachyon is totally different in sage-4.1.1 than in sage-4.1. Diffing them:

< = "old one that worked" and > = "new one":

...

Checking trac we find ticket #6542 (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6542) which has a ticket with basically a 1-line patch by Marshall Hampton refereed by Tim Dumol that introduced these changes. 

So, Marshall -- I hope you will fix that you broken Sage's Tachyon ASAP. 
And Elliott, you get a chocolate for finding and reporting a bug!  :-)

Tachyon seems to bomb out on the original example in the limit as camera_center->(0,0,0). Then, from tachyon.py viewdir=(0,0,0), which may not make sense; although on other examples I've tried when camera_center and viewdir are the zero vector then Tachyon returns an empty image. For the given example using

```
t = Tachyon(camera_center=(1.e-30,1.e-30,1.e-30))
```
does give, a not very interesting, image. How small vector_center can be and not cause Tachyon to bomb out my be hardware/software specific. With

```
t = Tachyon(camera_center=(-3,3,0))

I get an image similar to the parametric_plot() output. This sounds like a Tachyon bug.

I think this is a reasonably way to handle this given how long it's been, and a good doctest, but a brief reminder here about what the *default* camera center and look at are might be helpful.

Actually, I think I like the error message better the way it is.  Listing the defaults will be hard to maintain (in the unlikely case that they change later), unless we print them from some attribute.  But that makes printing the error depend on successfully determining the value of the attribute, making it slower and more prone to error itself.  I think the error message currently gives all the necessary information with a minimum of overhead and complication.

Maybe as a compromise, if necessary, print "see init method for default values"  ?

Well, it's actually in the `Tachyon?` documentation, not even just init, so I think then you've convinced me this is fine.
