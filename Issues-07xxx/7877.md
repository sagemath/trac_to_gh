A lot of the great stuff in the docstrings for the matrix `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` functions should be in the reference manual somewhere, maybe http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/matrix/docs.html.

Here's a typo in the patch:

```
96	Get the second column of M:: 
97	         
98	    sage: M[1:,0] 
99	    [ 1] 
100	    [ 1] 
101	    [-1]
```
The code should be:

```
sage: M[:,1]
[-2]
[ 8]
[ 1]
[ 2]
```
I have attached patch for this, which needs some review. Otherwise the whole ticket looks good.
