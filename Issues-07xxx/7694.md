Interestingly, I just looked in sage-4.4.3.alpha2, and this is already fixed:

```


    ::

        sage: std = os.environ['SAGE_DATA'] + '/extcode/pickle_jar/pickle_jar.tar.bz2'
        sage: print "x"; sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all(std)
        x...
        Successfully unpickled ... objects.
        Failed to unpickle 0 objects.
```
Cool.
