From Bernhard Esslinger:

```
I also would like to have a verbose mode for brute_force(), which
also prints the statistical values like chi square (to check and
make comparisons easy) 
```
Possibilities for the keyword `verbose` include:

1. print the rank number of a candidate decipherment
2. print the statistical value of a candidate decipherment
