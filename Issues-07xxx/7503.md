Whilst reviewing #7375 (upgrade M4RI to newest upstream release), for which I gave a positive review, I did notice some issues which should at least be investigated by Martin Albrecht. They are shown in a log file I attached to #7375 

Overall the update of M4RI solves two obvious problems (#7171 and #7037), and is clearly an improvement over the previous version of M4RI, so I felt fully justified in giving #7375 a positive review, even though I am aware of problems in the source code.
