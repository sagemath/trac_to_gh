There's a doctest in `sage/misc/test_class_pickling.py` that doesn't actually test anything. I was a reviewer for this patch, which means it's my bad for letting it through. Of course, this code gets tested anyway, so it's not so serious, but we should fix it anyway. Patch attached.

Good catch. That actually was a relic from a former (failed) attempt at getting c1 and c2 to be garbage collected by putting them out of scope, and see if this had any influence.

Replacing it by an equality test is sure better. Thanks!
