```
The spkg-install of libz zlib-1.2.3.p5 has this:

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   CFLAGS=" -m64 $CFLAGS -fPIC -g -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\""
   cp ../patches/configure-OSX-64 configure
else
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fPIC -g -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\""
fi
export CFLAGS
```

so is almost doomed to a 64-bit build unless one sets CFLAGS externally.

Attachment: **[add-64-bit-support-to-zlib.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7851/add-64-bit-support-to-zlib.patch.gz)**

With the recent updates to sage-env, this will actually build in 64-bit mode, as that will set CFLAGS appropriately. But there were some other issues with this package, so the following have been addressed. 

* Move -I $SAGE_LOCAL/include to CPPFLAGS, not CFLAGS
  There's no reason it should go there. 
* Removed most of the SAGE64 related stuff. The only bit 
  remaining is to apply a patch on OS X in 64-bit mode. 
* Removed -Wall and -g from CFLAGS - the new sage-eve 
  will add these automatically for gcc. Since they are 
  GNU specific flags, they would break with other compilers. 
* Substituted -fPIC for $FPIC_FLAG as -fPIC is a GNU specfic 
  option and sage-env defines FPIC_FLAG to be -fPIC for 
  gcc, but other things for Sun Studio and other compilers from
  HP and IBM.

This problem is not as simple as I first thought. Using the zlib source code, without any CFLAGS, but with the --shared option, we get the message the shared library is built. 

```
drkirkby@swan:[~/sage-4.3.1.alpha1/spkg/standard/zlib-1.2.3.p5/src] $  ./configure --shared

```

Trying to build in 64-bit mode, the shared library is not built.

I've reported this issue to the email address zlib at gzip.org and are awaiting feedback.  I don't think it will be easy to progress on this until that point.

Has entries for QNX os, remember those days.
