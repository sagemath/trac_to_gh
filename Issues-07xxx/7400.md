Before the patch

```
sage: o1 = ElementWrapper([1], parent=ZZ)
sage: o2 = copy(o1)
sage: o2.value[0] = 3; o2
[3]
sage: o1
[3]
```
After the patch

```
sage: o1 = ElementWrapper([1], parent=ZZ)
sage: o2 = copy(o1)
sage: o2.value[0] = 3; o2
[3]
sage: o1
[1]
```

Cheers,

Up to two small comments below, this is looking good:

The implementation of copy can probably be simplified a bit by using "super":

```
sage: class bla(SageObject):
....:     pass
....: 
sage: x = bla(); x.a = []; y = copy(x)
sage: id(x), id(y), id(x.a), id(y.a)
(204820300, 205533580, 208011212, 208011212)
sage: class bla(SageObject):
   def __copy__(self):
       res = copy(super(bla, self))
       res.a = copy(self.a)
       return res
....: ....: ....: ....: ....: 
sage: x = bla(); x.a = []; y = copy(x)
sage: id(x), id(y), id(x.a), id(y.a)
(204866636, 204866156, 205535372, 204820300)
```

In the ElementWrapperTester: `__repr__` => `_repr_`

This does not work if you inherits from `Element` rather than from `SageObject`. I consider this as a bug in `Element` but I'm not sure. I'm waiting for answer on  [sage-devel](http://groups.google.fr/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/d13fab1cd0bf79bc)

I had to write `__repr__` because `ElementWrapper` also has `__repr__` fixed both...

Is there a reason not to use  `super(Element, self).__copy__()` in Element.__copy__?

Oops, I meant:  copy(super(Element, self)). Btw: does copy(super(Element,self)) work for ElementWrapper? I think I vaguely prefer it if it works.

If you look at the way copy works, you'll realize that there is no chance that this works... And indeed:

```
File "/usr/local/sage/sage-4.2/devel/sage-combinat/sage/structure/element.pyx", line 322:
    sage: blo.__dict__ is bla.__dict__
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
```

Any more suggestion you don't want to try by yourself ;-)

I am happy with the patch.

I just did some minor editing of the doc on the Sage-Combinat patch server. Please double check, and/or adapt, and then you can set a positive review.
