I'm trying to make a 64-bit build of Sage on my Sun Ultra 27, but although I've sorted out many packages which do not honour SAGE64, the sage_fortran package is unique, and I don't have a clue how to fix it. 

I've also set FCFLAGS to -m64, but that is being ignored. 

I've marked this as critical, as it really will inhibit progress on Sage on Open Solaris if this bit insists on building 32-bit executables. Overall, it seems less hassle to build 64-bit on Open Solaris than 32-bit, due to the OpenSSL issues.
