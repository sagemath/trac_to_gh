This ticket is about adding support for creating Ogg Theora or WebM videos from animation objects. The resulting video files are embedded into the notebook using the HTML 5 video tag.

The show method of animations now works more like the one of Graphics objects. Animations can now be embeddend in html fragments, for example using html.table(). By default animations are still created as animated GIFs. To get a modern video from an animation "a" use one of these:

```
a.show(mimetype="video/ogg")
a.show(format="webm")
```

The original ticket was designed to use libtheora and libogg from #7297 and only supported Theora. The currently attached branch builds on FFmpeg and supports a variety of formats, including Theora and WebM. Support for calling FFmpeg is already in place, so the focus here is on user interface, mainly integration with the `show` method and using HTML 5 video tags.

The "iterations" optional argument does not work, but I don't think it's needed, as html5 has video controls. I'd suggest to either remove this argument, or change the documentation of 'ogv' from:

-  ``iterations`` - integer (default: 0); number of
   iterations of animation. If 0, loop forever.

to:

-  ``iterations`` - this argument is ignored, but kept for
   compatibility with the 'gif' function
           
Otherwise, everything's fine. The issue above is absolutely minor, so I'm giving a positive review.

I'm getting a docbuild warning from `sage/plot/animate.py`:

```
:0: (WARNING/2) Literal block expected; none found.
```
I think the problem is that the `ogv` method's docstring ends with

```
        .. note::
           If libtheora is not installed, you will get an error
           message like this::

Could someone please fix this?  For now, I'm removing [attachment:ogv.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7298/ogv.patch) from 4.5.2.alpha0.

If the two packages are installed correctly the 'png2theora' command line utility should
be in $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin.

And

```
sage: !png2theora --help
```
should give some output.

indeed:

```
$ which png2theora
/Applications/sage/local/bin/png2theora
```

```
sage: !png2theora --help
png2theora 1.1
Usage: png2theora [options] <input>

The input argument uses C printf format to represent a list of files,
  i.e. file-%06d.png to look for files file000001.png to file9999999.png 
...
```

Other things I could check?

I don't know what the problem is. The code just creates a bunch of png files with the frames of
the animation and then calls 'png2theora' to convert it an ogv file.

The relevant code is at the lines 405-415 of sage/plot/animate.py. You can try to remove the
try/except block to see the real error message of check_call.

Thanks; the problem seems to be that, for me, `check_call` needs to be called with a list of inputs -- giving the command as a single string fails for some reason (`png2theora` returns its usage message, so probably it is not receiving the arguments in the expected format):

```
sage: check_call(["png2theora", '-o "tmp2.ogv"', '%08d.png'])
9 frames, 202x106

./00000005.png
./00000006.png

done.

```

but 

```
sage: check_call(["png2theora", '-o "tmp2.ogv" %08d.png'])
png2theora 1.1
Usage: png2theora [options] <input>
...
```

and 

```
sage: check_call('png2theora -o "tmp3.ogv" %08d.png')

```

The last command is a simplified version of what appears in `sage/plot/animate.py` . . . does it really work for other people here?  And if so, why?

This seems to be the offending code:

```
405	        cmd = 'cd "%s"; sage-native-execute png2theora -o "%s" -f %s  %%08d.png 2> /dev/null'%(d, savefile, int(100/delay))

407	        try: 
408	            check_call(cmd, shell=True) 
```

I'm switching this to "needs work", since I think ``cmd`` needs to be a list of strings rather than a single string (see above).

I tried working on this again, but now I'm having trouble installing the `libtheora` spkg with sage 4.6.  For what it's worth, installing `libogg` went fine.  Is this a known issue?

The last lines of the failing install (before the timing and other end messages) are:

png2theora is one of the example programs included in libtheora and it is used by this patch
to generate the ogv videos. This line means that it failed to build. Besides libtheora itself
its only dependency is libpng. Did you get the line

```
checking for PNG... yes
```

in the configure log?
Which platform are you using?

I'm using Mac OS 10.6.6.  Since I made my last post above, I have downloaded libtheora directly from their website and compiled png2theora successfully outside of Sage.  I just retried installing from within Sage, and it still cannot find libpng, and still fails to build png2theora . . .

Yes. I have never developed on Mac OS, so I don't really know how to fix it. This is the autoconf
check, used by libtheora to test for libpng:

```
dnl check for libpng
HAVE_PNG=no
if test "x$HAVE_PKG_CONFIG" = "xyes"
then
  PKG_CHECK_MODULES(PNG, libpng, HAVE_PNG=yes, HAVE_PNG=no)
fi
AC_SUBST(PNG_CFLAGS)
AC_SUBST(PNG_LIBS)
```

It is very simple, and since the original source builds for you, this should also work on Mac OS.

Maybe one could hard code the variables PNG_CFLAGS and PNG_LIBS in spkg-install, but there should be a better solution.

I created a new spkg for libtheora, which checks for libpng12.

There is perhaps also the subtlety of patent and license issues -- there seem to be more severe limitations on the ways ffmpeg can be distributed, while png2theora is licensed under a relatively free BSD-style license . . . thus png2theora could conceivably be included with sage at some point, while ffmpeg is harder to imagine.

In any case, the patch at #11170 is quite useful, and doesn't suffer from the Mac-specific problems mentioned above.

Can you clarify this? I've seen this claim elsewhere, but I'm not sure what it means.  On the [ffmpeg web page](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) it says that it is distributed under LGPL or GPL, depending on what components are being used, and this wouldn't put any extra restrictions on us.  I guess the very last question on [this page](http://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html) might be an issue, but it's not very clear to me.

See #16533 for a branch which does add the video tag, backed by ffmpeg. It also restores animation embedding in general, which appears to be broken at the moment, and it adds support for APNG as well.

I hope I'm not stepping on anybodies toes by commandeering this ticket here to carry my branch. And I hope I'm doing it the right way.

That branch is my <video> tag implementation, building on code from #16533. Once that is accepted, the modification to add the video tag is pretty small, and mostly involves some mime type fiddling.

I kept the table embedding stuff in there, since Wilfried Huss had it in his patch, and it seemed like a good idea but probably not worth a ticket all by itself.

+The original ticket was designed to use libtheora and libogg from #7297 and only supported Theora. The currently attached branch builds on FFmpeg and supports a variety of formats, including Theora and WebM. Support for calling FFmpeg is already in place, so the focus here is on user interface, mainly integration with the `show` method and using HTML 5 video tags.

* Should I restrict users to e.g. Theora and WebM as video formats?

* Should I dynamically create new classes, one for every user-requested format?
* How about support for more than one format, should we introduce a type which generates a bunch of common video formats (e.g. again Theora and WebM) to plug them into a single `<video>` tag so the browser can pick what he likes best, at the cost of increased conversion time?

Judging from e.g. the handling of LaTeX output, it looks as if I could simply generate HTML and have that recognized by the notebooks. I hope that's the case. I'll have to look whether embedding animations into tables still makes sense, but I hope it does.

I *very strongly* disagree. Animations involving gradients, e.g. from 3D scenes, tend to look *horrible* in 255 color GIF. Animations with few frames and lots of change in between (like e.g. the first example from the animate docs) look *horrible* as video, due to heavy compression artifacts.

APNG looks as good as things can get, since we create everything else from a bunch of PNG frames and this is a lossless method. But for lengthy animations it might simply be too big to be feasible to transfer this. After all, my APNG assembler makes no effort to compress things using clever frame disposal combinations.

Do I need to bundle up a few examples to support these claims, or will you accept my word or your own observations for this?

> Users care either about […] saving an animation in a particular format to be used elsewhere.

The easiest way to do this, in my book, is have the animation show up in my notebook, then right-click and save to file. That works for cloud sessions as well as for local sessions as well as for sessions using some notebook server in my LAN. And I can always look at the animation first, make sure it looks the way I want it to, *then* save it to a local file once I'm satisfied. So the distinction between “view” and “save” is not as sharp as you claim.

Distinguishing between the color-reduction losses of GIF and the frequency-domain compression losses of WebM and Theora does, in my opinion, indeed require some knowledge of formats. Sure, I won't mind if a polyfill-supported APNG becomes the lossless and shiny default, so that only the tech-savvy people ever have to make such a distinction.

I'd say that on the one hand, noone should be forced to make any format decision for elementary work (small 2D animations with few colors), but those who have the knowledge to choose a format should also have the power to get things displayed in their format of choice. I don't want to force anybody to save stuff to a file and open it in a different application just because showing it in line would offer too many choices.

By the way, how are chances that every browser-based notebook will reliably detect whether the browser supports WebM, Theora, or perhaps even something else which FFmpeg already supports but Sage does not know about?

I'd go a step further: there are many ways the animation composition might be tweaked. For ffmpeg videos you might control a million settings, bit rate probably the most important one. For GIF via ImageMagick there are a number of steps one can perform to achieve smaller and better files, reduction to a global color table foremost among these. I'd like to one day offer all of this power to the user, so he can pass ffmpeg command line switches or enable ImageMagick optimizations, whether he's saving to disk or viewing in browser. If you don't believe in “right click to save”, then you can still consider the “view in browser” as a preview to what will be saved to disk.

With the changes I had here, passing `**kwds` from `show` through `save` all the way to the format-specific methods, where additional options could be introduced as needed. Now if you claim that the user shouldn't even have control over whether the animation goes through FFmpeg or through ImageMagick, that approach doesn't make that much sense any more.

I can understand some of your concerns. To me, a supported output type is a promise. For most simple output types the promise is “if you give me a file of said type, I'll display it to the user”. But with video, it's not as simple. It's not the backend which decides what video formats are supported, but instead it's the browser or the system setup.

It's not “output all video that Sage NB understands”.

For the `<video>` tag you need the MIME type. For the media player, you need the correct file extension.

One more comment: if there is one thing I can't stand about computer programs, it's if these try to be more clever than the user. The user should be in charge, and if the user says “I want to view this animation in that format”, the code should not second-guess that decision, should not forbid the operation just because the named format isn't in a list of known formats, or support by the browser or media player can't be verified up front.

Fine with me. I'm not saying that it should behave differently than your `OutputVideoAny`, I'm just asking you to make it possible for other backends to rely on the output types.

> Thanks, looks much better.

Glad you say so. I'm still a bit concerned by the fact that a format supported by backend and FFmpeg still won't be supported only because it's not in our list.

I'm slightly worried by the fact that we save the video to some temporary file, only to copy it to the current working directory in a subsequent step, where SageNB can pick it up. This feels kind of wasteful. As far as I see, the temporary file used for the rich output never gets deleted (if this is wrong, where is the code doing that), which means a long-running SageNB process will accumulate temporary files without association to notebook cells, and might exhaust some tempfs due to this. Should this be a separate ticket?

> I still dislike that HTML 5 tag attributes are attached to the rich output types, that makes no sense outside of a browser.

Well, most of the attributes map to other players as well. To support that claim, take e.g. `xine` which has `-Z` to suppress autoplay, `--hide-gui` and `--no-gui` to disable controls, and `--loop` or perhaps `--loop=repeat` to loop. So while the names of the attributes were taken from HTML5, the semantics can be found elsewhere as well.

The main problem is that each viewer has a different set of command line arguments to represent these options, and as long as we open stuff through `xdg-open` (which I consider the most likely approach for `BackendIPythonCommandline` on Linux), we have little chance of actually supporting any of this outside the browser in the near future.

> The settings in question:

Use case: Creating the animation takes five minutes, so you work in some other window while Sage gets its act together. When you switch back you want to be able to view the animation from the beginning using a single click. Or perhaps you have a loop creating several animations, and want to show them one after the other. Controlling when an animation starts may be particularly important in an environment where you have an audience, and some effect visible in the animation which you don't want to divulge prematurely.

> * controls: Who would ever want no video controls? Hard to imagine any use case for that on a scientific data visualization platform.

I guess you are right there. I guess the main reason to have that in HTML is when you have your own controls written in JavaScript. Not something we need to worry about.

> * loop: Seems desirable

Mapping `loop` to e.g. the IPython command line backend sounds like it's going to be really tricky, but I think we simply have to live with the fact that some backends won't support some of the features.

> So IMHO we should only have a `loop=True` optional keyword argument on the video output types, and no attrs={} dictionary.

If I could convince you with the `autoplay` use cases, should I add two keyword arguments? I guess so.

Temporary files are always a kludge, which is why the OutputBuffer is designed around in-memory buffers. In general there is no guarantee that the compute kernel and the notebook server share a common file system. Like all temporary files, they are eventually deleted by the separate sage-cleaner process.

There is a technical solution to not playing stuff in hidden browser tabs: http://caniuse.com/#feat=pagevisibility. No need to force the user to do it by hand.

If you want to show multiple animations one after the other then you really want a single animation with the frames concatenated. Presumably you can add animation objects... 

If you don't want the audience to see the animation then don't evaluate the cell that shows the animation.
