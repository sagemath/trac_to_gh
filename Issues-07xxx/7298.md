This ticket is about adding support for creating Ogg Theora or WebM videos from animation objects. The resulting video files are embedded into the notebook using the HTML 5 video tag.

The show method of animations now works more like the one of Graphics objects. Animations can now be embeddend in html fragments, for example using html.table(). By default animations are still created as animated GIFs. To get a modern video from an animation "a" use one of these:

```
a.show(mimetype="video/ogg")
a.show(format="webm")
```

The original ticket was designed to use libtheora and libogg from #7297 and only supported Theora. The currently attached branch builds on FFmpeg and supports a variety of formats, including Theora and WebM. Support for calling FFmpeg is already in place, so the focus here is on user interface, mainly integration with the `show` method and using HTML 5 video tags.

The "iterations" optional argument does not work, but I don't think it's needed, as html5 has video controls. I'd suggest to either remove this argument, or change the documentation of 'ogv' from:

-  ``iterations`` - integer (default: 0); number of
   iterations of animation. If 0, loop forever.

to:

-  ``iterations`` - this argument is ignored, but kept for
   compatibility with the 'gif' function
           
Otherwise, everything's fine. The issue above is absolutely minor, so I'm giving a positive review.

I'm getting a docbuild warning from `sage/plot/animate.py`:

```
:0: (WARNING/2) Literal block expected; none found.
```
I think the problem is that the `ogv` method's docstring ends with

```
        .. note::
           If libtheora is not installed, you will get an error
           message like this::

Could someone please fix this?  For now, I'm removing [attachment:ogv.patch] from 4.5.2.alpha0.

Hi,

I'd really like to use this, but I'm having trouble from the start . . . 

```
sage: a = animate([sin(x + float(k)) for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.7)], xmin=0, xmax=2*pi, figsize=[2,1])
sage: a.ogv()
Error: libtheora does not appear to be installed. Saving an
animation to a Ogg Theora file or displaying an animation requires the
libtheora spkg, so please install it and try again.

sage: install_package('libtheora')
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: Package is already installed. Try install_package('libtheora',force=True)
```

I did install both `libogg` and `libtheora` using `install_package` in sage 4.5.2

If the two packages are installed correctly the 'png2theora' command line utility should
be in $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin.

And

```
sage: !png2theora --help
```
should give some output.

indeed:

```
$ which png2theora
/Applications/sage/local/bin/png2theora
```

>

```
sage: !png2theora --help
png2theora 1.1
Usage: png2theora [options] <input>

The input argument uses C printf format to represent a list of files,
  i.e. file-%06d.png to look for files file000001.png to file9999999.png 
...
```

Other things I could check?

I don't know what the problem is. The code just creates a bunch of png files with the frames of
the animation and then calls 'png2theora' to convert it an ogv file.

The relevant code is at the lines 405-415 of sage/plot/animate.py. You can try to remove the
try/except block to see the real error message of check_call.

Thanks; the problem seems to be that, for me, `check_call` needs to be called with a list of inputs -- giving the command as a single string fails for some reason (`png2theora` returns its usage message, so probably it is not receiving the arguments in the expected format):

```
sage: check_call(["png2theora", '-o "tmp2.ogv"', '%08d.png'])
9 frames, 202x106

./00000006.png

done.

but 

```

```

and 

```

```

The last command is a simplified version of what appears in `sage/plot/animate.py` . . . does it really work for other people here?  And if so, why?

This seems to be the offending code:

```
405	        cmd = 'cd "%s"; sage-native-execute png2theora -o "%s" -f %s  %%08d.png 2> /dev/null'%(d, savefile, int(100/delay))

407	        try: 
408	            check_call(cmd, shell=True) 
```

I'm switching this to "needs work", since I think ``cmd`` needs to be a list of strings rather than a single string (see above).

png2theora is one of the example programs included in libtheora and it is used by this patch
to generate the ogv videos. This line means that it failed to build. Besides libtheora itself
its only dependency is libpng. Did you get the line

```
checking for PNG... yes
```

in the configure log?
Which platform are you using?

Yes. I have never developed on Mac OS, so I don't really know how to fix it. This is the autoconf
check, used by libtheora to test for libpng:

```
dnl check for libpng
HAVE_PNG=no
if test "x$HAVE_PKG_CONFIG" = "xyes"
then
  PKG_CHECK_MODULES(PNG, libpng, HAVE_PNG=yes, HAVE_PNG=no)
fi
AC_SUBST(PNG_CFLAGS)
AC_SUBST(PNG_LIBS)
```

It is very simple, and since the original source builds for you, this should also work on Mac OS.

Maybe one could hard code the variables PNG_CFLAGS and PNG_LIBS in spkg-install, but there should be a better solution.

I believe that we ship libpng, so it's weird that it didn't find it.

I know in matplotlib, though, on OSX, we look for libpng12.  It seems that a long time ago, we kept picking up the wrong libpng on OSX, so now we look for libpng12.  I believe the problem has been fixed since then, but the "fix" for matplotlib is still in the spkg.

I created a new spkg for libtheora, which checks for libpng12.

[http://www.math.tugraz.at/~huss/spkg/libtheora-1.1.1.p1.spkg](http://www.math.tugraz.at/~huss/spkg/libtheora-1.1.1.p1.spkg)

It still works for me. Could someone test it on OSX?

There is perhaps also the subtlety of patent and license issues -- there seem to be more severe limitations on the ways ffmpeg can be distributed, while png2theora is licensed under a relatively free BSD-style license . . . thus png2theora could conceivably be included with sage at some point, while ffmpeg is harder to imagine.

In any case, the patch at #11170 is quite useful, and doesn't suffer from the Mac-specific problems mentioned above.

I hope I'm not stepping on anybodies toes by commandeering this ticket here to carry my branch. And I hope I'm doing it the right way.

That branch is my <video> tag implementation, building on code from #16533. Once that is accepted, the modification to add the video tag is pretty small, and mostly involves some mime type fiddling.

I kept the table embedding stuff in there, since Wilfried Huss had it in his patch, and it seemed like a good idea but probably not worth a ticket all by itself.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A50):
> GIF/APNG/Webm animations presumably all look the same to a human


I *very strongly* disagree. Animations involving gradients, e.g. from 3D scenes, tend to look *horrible* in 255 color GIF. Animations with few frames and lots of change in between (like e.g. the first example from the animate docs) look *horrible* as video, due to heavy compression artifacts.

APNG looks as good as things can get, since we create everything else from a bunch of PNG frames and this is a lossless method. But for lengthy animations it might simply be too big to be feasible to transfer this. After all, my APNG assembler makes no effort to compress things using clever frame disposal combinations. It simply concatenates files, more or less.

Do I need to bundle up a few examples to support these claims, or will you accept my word or your own observations for this?

> Users care either about […] saving an animation in a particular format to be used elsewhere.


The easiest way to do this, in my book, is have the animation show up in my notebook, then right-click and save to file. That works for cloud sessions as well as for local sessions as well as for sessions using some notebook server in my LAN. And I can always look at the animation first, make sure it looks the way I want it to, *then* save it to a local file once I'm satisfied. So the distinction between “view” and “save” is not as sharp as you claim.

Distinguishing between lossy / lossless compression for graphics is reasonable, and doesn't require the user to know what webm&apng is. This is similar to preferring vector or raster graphics for 2-d plots. In #17234 I introduced a preference system for rich output, e.g.

IPython is not the only notebook. I'm happy to use SageNB in almost all of my daily work, and have been happily using my own video-enabled branch on several occasions as well. If IPython doesn't support these, that's just one more reason to stick with SageNB for now, and hope that IPython learns to play along eventually.

My Firefox supports APNG just fine, thank you very much.

I tell you this *is* working, since I *am* doing this, on a fairly regular basis. (I very much hope you won't claim that this is just me pressing the space bar for heat-induced Ctrl.)

Sounds good, what ticket number is it?

Can we please also have an option `preview` to the method `save` so it will show an inlined preview of the file you've just saved and can download via the link? In that case, I'll simply switch to writing `save` instead of `show` and will be just as happy as I am now, since it does give show me the file inline, give me full control over the format, and lets me save via right-click or that link.

The whole point of the rich output model is to separate different output types.\n\n\nI can understand some of your concerns. To me, a supported output type is a promise. For most simple output types the promise is \u201cif you give me a file of said type, I'll display it to the user\u201d. But with video, it's not as simple. It's not the backend which decides what video formats are supported, but instead it's the browser or the system setup. So the promise I associate with `OutputVideoAny` is \u201cif you give me a file of said type, I'll present it to a user in such a way that it either plays or the user gets notified about what went wrong\u201d. Which in a browser context means \u201cI'll create a HTML5 `<video>` tag for it\u201d.\n\nDue to this nature, `OutputVideoAny` should never be used to auto-guess supported formats. It doesn't mean \u201cthis client supports any video format\u201d, but instead \u201cthis client can present any video format to the user, but that presentation might be in the form or an error message\u201d. So the machinery shouldn't use it to throw arbitrary formats at the back end, but as a means to throw explicitly requested formats at it.\n\nI wouldn't mind having specific formats. For video, a full file format description consists of a container format, a video codec format, and possibly a bunch of other constraints as well. So we'd have `OutputVideoWebMVP8` and `OutputVideoWebMVP9` and `OutputVideoOggTheora` and `OutputVideoAviH264` and `OutputVideoFlashH264` and `OutputVideoMp4H264` and `OutputVideoQuicktimeH264` and probably a hundred other combinations. (We could parse the list of formats FFmpeg supports.) And in my opinion, each of these would indicate a promise to actually support the given type. So we'd have to somehow detect support. Or state that such a type being listed with the supported types does not imply it's actually supported. I have no idea on how to do auto-detection, and having a bunch of maybe supported formats feels no different to my `OutputVideoAny`.\n\nSo do you have any suggestions of how to handle this situation in a better way? I understand your criticism from an idealistic point of view, but on the pragmatic side, unless one can do active format support detection, all formats are essentially the same to the backend, and a single representation for all of them avoids useless overhead.\n\n> The rich output container must not contain anything but the data. No mime types, no file extensions. The type is unique to the output. By lumping it into a single OutputAllVideoThatSageNBunderstands you destroy any hope of ever supporting other notebooks without reverting your branch.\n\n\nIt's not \u201coutput all video that Sage NB understands\u201d.

> But OutputVideoAny is just a slap in the face of any attempt at sanity. The whole point of the rich output model is to separate different output types.


I can understand some of your concerns. To me, a supported output type is a promise. For most simple output types the promise is “if you give me a file of said type, I'll display it to the user”. But with video, it's not as simple. It's not the backend which decides what video formats are supported, but instead it's the browser or the system setup. So the promise I associate with `OutputVideoAny` is “if you give me a file of said type, I'll present it to a user in such a way that it either plays or the user gets notified about what went wrong”. Which in a browser context means “I'll create a HTML5 `<video>` tag for it”.

Due to this nature, `OutputVideoAny` should never be used to auto-guess supported formats. It doesn't mean “this client supports any video format”, but instead “this client can present any video format to the user, but that presentation might be in the form or an error message”. So the machinery shouldn't use it to throw arbitrary formats at the back end, but as a means to throw explicitly requested formats at it.

I wouldn't mind having specific formats. For video, a full file format description consists of a container format, a video codec format, and possibly a bunch of other constraints as well. So we'd have `OutputVideoWebMVP8` and `OutputVideoWebMVP9` and `OutputVideoOggTheora` and `OutputVideoAviH264` and `OutputVideoFlashH264` and `OutputVideoMp4H264` and `OutputVideoQuicktimeH264` and probably a hundred other combinations. (We could parse the list of formats FFmpeg supports.) And in my opinion, each of these would indicate a promise to actually support the given type. So we'd have to somehow detect support. Or state that such a type being listed with the supported types does not imply it's actually supported. I have no idea on how to do auto-detection, and having a bunch of maybe supported formats feels no different to my `OutputVideoAny`.

So do you have any suggestions of how to handle this situation in a better way? I understand your criticism from an idealistic point of view, but on the pragmatic side, unless one can do active format support detection, all formats are essentially the same to the backend, and a single representation for all of them avoids useless overhead.

> The rich output container must not contain anything but the data. No mime types, no file extensions. The type is unique to the output. By lumping it into a single OutputAllVideoThatSageNBunderstands you destroy any hope of ever supporting other notebooks without reverting your branch.


It's not “output all video that Sage NB understands”. It's more like “output all video which can possibly be handled by a `<video>` tag”, combined with “output all video which gets opened by launching up the user's default media player”. For the `<video>` tag you need the MIME type. For the media player, you need the correct file extension. But if you consider the `<video>` element as the deliverable of the output, then the mime type is very much part of the data needed to assemble that.

One more comment: if there is one thing I can't stand about computer programs, it's if these try to be more clever than the user. The user should be in charge, and if the user says “I want to view this animation in that format”, the code should not second-guess that decision, should not forbid the operation just because the named format isn't in a list of known formats, or support by the browser or media player can't be verified up front. Please leave the users in charge of their application, not the other way round!

The main problem is that each viewer has a different set of command line arguments to represent these options, and as long as we open stuff through `xdg-open` (which I consider the most likely approach for `BackendIPythonCommandline` on Linux), we have little chance of actually supporting any of this outside the browser in the near future.

> The settings in question:

Use case: Creating the animation takes five minutes, so you work in some other window while Sage gets its act together. When you switch back you want to be able to view the animation from the beginning using a single click. Or perhaps you have a loop creating several animations, and want to show them one after the other. Controlling when an animation starts may be particularly important in an environment where you have an audience, and some effect visible in the animation which you don't want to divulge prematurely.

I guess you are right there. I guess the main reason to have that in HTML is when you have your own controls written in JavaScript. Not something we need to worry about.

> * loop: Seems desirable


Mapping `loop` to e.g. the IPython command line backend sounds like it's going to be really tricky, but I think we simply have to live with the fact that some backends won't support some of the features.

> So IMHO we should only have a `loop=True` optional keyword argument on the video output types, and no attrs={} dictionary.


If I could convince you with the `autoplay` use cases, should I add two keyword arguments? I guess so.
