Here is the cause:

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ,0,'')
sage: P('pi')
pi
sage: type(P('pi'))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

[attachment:trac_7951-zero_variable_poly_coercion.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7951/trac_7951-zero_variable_poly_coercion.patch) has the fix.

Doesn't apply cleanly to 4.3.1, maybe I don't have a new enough alpha?
