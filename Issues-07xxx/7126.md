Thanks very much for finding these problems.  I ran the JS code in `layout.html` through [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) on the "The Good Parts" setting and made the attached changes.  Note: I didn't add ["use strict";](http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/), since ECMAScript5 is not in widespread use.  I also prepended a "global" comment for `jQuery` and `window`, the latter for its [resize event](http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/resize.html).

I don't think Sphinx does any JS compression.  I think a lone `$` in Sphinx's `layout.html` causes `misc.html.math_parse()` and `notebook.docHTMLProcessor.process_doc_html()` effectively to strip the `\n`'s from the toggle code.

We should still fix the `$` problem, since Firebug and Opera's DragonFly complain about it.  Worse yet, it makes Chromium's Developer Tools hang.
