MPIR would not build on my HP-UX box, so needless to say programs wanting gmp will not work. However, cddlib-094f  checks for gmp, then ignores the fact it can't find it. It should exit with a clear error message then, not carry on. 

A developer can have access to the HP-UX box, but this is not really necessay to fix this. Just email me with your preffered user name if you want to have an account
