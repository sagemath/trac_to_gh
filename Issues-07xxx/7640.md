One problem IMHO with `c_graph` is that as is (correct me if I'm wrong)
we won't be able to have a fast `in_neighbors`.

At least the current implementation is to test all vertices in the graph.

One less between Sage and c_graphs :-)

Here is the result of the test given in the description of this ticket :

```
sage: sage: G = graphs.CubeGraph(5)
sage: sage: C = G.copy(implementation='c_graph')
sage: sage: timeit("G.shortest_path('01001', '10100')")
625 loops, best of 3: 51.6 µs per loop
sage: sage: timeit("C.shortest_path('01001', '10100')")
625 loops, best of 3: 30.4 µs per loop
```

Great work!

A few comments:

1. You can use `if self._backend.hasattr('_cg')` to test whether self is a `c_graph` or a `networkx` graph. This seems cleaner than a try-except block.

2. It should be easy to implement something in the case `bidirectional=False`, and we should do this since the point is to replace NetworkX with our own functionality.

3. We also need to handle the case `by_weight=True`: this is only relevant for `SparseGraph`s, since `DenseGraph`s don't support edge labeling.

I applied the patch here, together with the patch at #7634, (to `4.3.rc0`) in order to fully test the new functionality, and here are the results of `-t -long sage/graphs` (files not listed passed):

Well, in the end I corrected the first two errors, which were directly errors in the algorithm ( I ignored the direction of arcs, which is now fixed ).

The following ones are created by the enumeration of degree ( for example the error in eulerian_orientation is not really one. The result given is correct, but there is one inversion due to the fact that the order in the listing of neighbors is not the same when you patch is applied :-)

This reminded me that your patch for c_graphs had not actually been tested against the new Sage because of the slowness in the distance function..
