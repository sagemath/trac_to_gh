The spkg's with ._ file crap all over the place are:

* `flintqs-20070817.p8` (standard)
* `gap_packages-4.4.12.p1` (optional)
* `boost_1_34_1` (experimental)
* `quantlib-0.9.6` (experimental)
* `quantlib_swig-0.9.6` (experimental)

This can be fixed by extracting the spkg, deleting the crap, and remaking it with "sage -pkg".  I think "sage -pkg" works correctly on OS X now-a-days, but certainly does on Linux.
