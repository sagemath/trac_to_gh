pdehaye reported a build error in pari on IRC.

We tracked this down to what seems to be a bug in pari's Configure script (or rather config/get_fltk): if X11 is not found, and fltk is found, it ignores the --graphic=none option. It then tries to build with fltk support, and fails spectacularly.

(Aside: pari-2.4.2.alpha still has the same logic in config/get_fltk.) This [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/0c895b6b12eb1d41) thread also reports the same problem.
