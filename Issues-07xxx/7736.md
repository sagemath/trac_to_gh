Here is a result that confuses me (appologies for not having a simpler example for this):

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('1728z');
sage: Et = E.mod5family();
sage: f=Et.discriminant().numerator().factor()[0][0];
sage: K.<alpha> = NumberField(f);
sage: f.change_ring(K).factor()[1][0].is_irreducible()
False
```
Here f turns out to be a degree 12 polynomial, and when you factor it over K, you get a linear factor and a degree 11 factor. However, degree 11 factor in this case is not irreducible. In fact, if you continue with

```
sage: g = f.change_ring(K).factor()[1][0];
sage: g.factor()
```
you get a linear factor and a degree 10 factor, where both are irreducible.

I fear it is no good asking for an upstream fix, since they (pari) have already fixed it but we are not using the fixed version. See #7097 for more details.

It may well be that the short-term fix I put in at #7097 is not yet good enough.  [It is short-term since the latest version of pari have fixed some bugs which arose for non-monic polynomials, which is why the patch  I put in at #7097 made sure that pari was only called to factor monic ones.]

I just had a possibly worse example, and found this ticket while looking to see if I should open a new one:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('4900a2')
sage: f = E.division_polynomial(9)
sage: K3.<z> = CyclotomicField(3)
sage: ff = f.change_ring(K3)
sage: ff.degree()
40
sage: [g.degree() for g,e in ff.factor()]
[1, 3, 9, 40]
```
I factor a degree 40 polynomial and the returned factors have degrees 1,3,9,40!
Even if I make the polynomial monic (above it has leading coefficient 9) it is no better:

```
sage: x = f.parent().gen()
sage: g = 9^39 * f(x/9)
sage: all([c.is_integral() for c in g.coefficients()])
True
sage: [h.degree() for h,e in g.change_ring(K3).factor()]
[1, 3, 9, 40]
```

Explanation:  fm is f made monic and integral which is required for construction of number fields.  We check that both f and fm factor correctly over the number field defined by f (which we have to construct using fm): factors have degrees 1,1,10.  Note that we have to change variables before factoring, otherwise we get an error;  and that the factornf functions require more than the default memory allocation.

This is good news since right now a few feet from me William and Robert B are spending the day making this version of pari into an new spkg (see #9343).
