Looks good to me. I've made some tiny doctest fixes, and uploaded a new version of the patch, still with roed's user stamp on it. This applies cleanly to 4.3.4.rc0, if you apply the patches in the following order:

```
$ sage -hg qseries
trac_8218_fixes_434alpha1.patch
trac_8332_givaro_python.patch
trac_8332_reviewer.patch
trac_7880-sets_with_partial_maps.patch
```


on top of the patches at #8218 and #8332.
