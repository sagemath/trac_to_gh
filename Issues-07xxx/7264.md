```

I can reproduce this:

```
sage: var('a,b,c,I')
(a, b, c, I)
sage: model_exp = exp(I)**a*(b)
sage: sol1_l={b: 5.0, a: 1.1}
sage: model_exp.subs(sol1_l)
/home/burcin/sage/sage-4.1.2/local/bin/sage-sage: line 203: 23916
Segmentation fault      sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

The cause might be #6948.

```
sage: var('a,b,c,I')
(a, b, c, I)
sage: model_exp=exp(I)**a*(b)
sage: sol1_l={b: 5.0, a: 1.1}

<a id='comment:2'></a>This was indeed caused by the changes to pynac from #6948. I forgot to adjust
automatic simplification of pynac `mul` objects to the new exp power rule. 

This is fixed in the new pynac package here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.10.spkg

attachment:trac_7264-exp_power_segfault.patch adds doctests for the fix.

Note that the new pynac version also contains fixes for #7508 and #7406. Tests should be run with the patches from those tickets also applied in this order:

* #7508
* #7264 (this ticket)
* #7406

This ticket now depends on #7490 and #7508.

Did you have #7490 applied to your tree?

That patch was merged in 4.3.alpha1, so you can also try updating to the latest alpha.

Thank you for your time.

<a id='comment:5'></a>This needs work, because somehow the following test with the new spkg causes a segfault (Mac OSX 10.5, Intel):

```
sage: exp(x)^I*exp(z)^(2.5)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```
However, everything else behaves properly, so if this can be fixed, all three tickets will have positive review.  These are important fixes, so thanks for the work!

To get a backtrace, you need to run Sage under gdb as the error message says. When it crashes, type `bt`, then copy and paste the output here.

Starting from a clean install, and making sure there is nothing else to effect this test could also help.

By the way, I get tons of errors when running sage -gdb "could not find object file "....o" - no debug information available for "....c" though I assume that is normal.

The same type of error happens if I just do 

```
sage: exp(blah)^I*exp(z)
```
where blah can be anything.  So perhaps something is parsing weird with the I* business.

Also notice that currently I seem to have both pynac-0.1.10 and pynac-0.1.10.a0 installed, but fixing this and reinstalling pynac 0.1.10 didn't hep.  Interestingly, it has to be two different things in the exps, as exp(x)^I*exp(x) works fine, but even exp(2)^I*exp(3) doesn't.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I can confirm this still happens on both sage.math and my Macintel machine.   On sage.math this was from a fresh binary; note it did have the pynac-0.1.10a0 in it, which I am wondering whether this might have something to do with it - maybe two variants of something or other?

I put another version at the same place:

Hopefully this is the last time. :)

Can you try again?
