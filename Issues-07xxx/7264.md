```

I can reproduce this:

```
sage: var('a,b,c,I')
(a, b, c, I)
sage: model_exp = exp(I)**a*(b)
sage: sol1_l={b: 5.0, a: 1.1}
sage: model_exp.subs(sol1_l)
/home/burcin/sage/sage-4.1.2/local/bin/sage-sage: line 203: 23916
Segmentation fault      sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

The cause might be #6948.

In 4.2:

(a, b, c, I)
sage: model_exp=exp(I)**a*(b)
sage: sol1_l={b: 5.0, a: 1.1}

This was indeed caused by the changes to pynac from #6948. I forgot to adjust
automatic simplification of pynac `mul` objects to the new exp power rule. 

This is fixed in the new pynac package here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.10.spkg

[attachment: trac_7264-exp_power_segfault.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7264/trac_7264-exp_power_segfault.patch.gz) adds doctests for the fix.

Note that the new pynac version also contains fixes for #7508 and #7406. Tests should be run with the patches from those tickets also applied in this order:

* #7508
* #7264 (this ticket)
* #7406

This ticket now depends on #7490 and #7508.

Did you have #7490 applied to your tree?

That patch was merged in 4.3.alpha1, so you can also try updating to the latest alpha.

Thank you for your time.

This needs work, because somehow the following test with the new spkg causes a segfault (Mac OSX 10.5, Intel):

```
sage: exp(x)^I*exp(z)^(2.5)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```
However, everything else behaves properly, so if this can be fixed, all three tickets will have positive review.  These are important fixes, so thanks for the work!

Can you post a backtrace? I can't reproduce the problem and I have no clue what might be going wrong.

To get a backtrace, you need to run Sage under gdb as the error message says. When it crashes, type `bt`, then copy and paste the output here.

Starting from a clean install, and making sure there is nothing else to effect this test could also help.

This was a fresh build of 4.3.alpha1.  Only issue was that I had to hg -add several files to be able to add patches, and revert the two png files Minh has mentioned on sage-devel.  But I don't see how that would have affected things.

By the way, I get tons of errors when running sage -gdb "could not find object file "....o" - no debug information available for "....c" though I assume that is normal.

The same type of error happens if I just do 

```
sage: exp(blah)^I*exp(z)
```
where blah can be anything.  So perhaps something is parsing weird with the I* business.

Also notice that currently I seem to have both pynac-0.1.10 and pynac-0.1.10.a0 installed, but fixing this and reinstalling pynac 0.1.10 didn't hep.  Interestingly, it has to be two different things in the exps, as exp(x)^I*exp(x) works fine, but even exp(2)^I*exp(3) doesn't.
