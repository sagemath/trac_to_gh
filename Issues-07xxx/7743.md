This patch fixes two issues with the piecewise class, brought up in this sage-support thread:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/18d830ece7826898/86c401e4d6b8f3dd

The first issue is that when a piece of the function belongs to the Integer ring, integration doesn't work. This is fixed by coercing each piece to the symbolic expression ring.

The second issue is that there are cases where maxima needs to be given assumptions about the domain of x for the piece being integrated. This is fixed with the assume and forget functions.

Additional unit tests have been added (or existing tests modified) for each issue.

Keywords: **integration**

Component: **calculus**

Author: **Paul Butler**

Reviewer: **David Joyner**

Merged: **sage-4.3.1.alpha2**

_Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/7743_

Applies to 4.3.1.a0 (the hacked version) and 4.3. Passes all tests but sagedoc on 64bit ubuntu 9.10 with 4.3.1.a0
and only with seemingly unrelated failures on imac 10.6.2 with 4.3.

Thanks for fixing this bug!
