This functions uses LP and has a big overhead because of that... Is many cases, though, the graph is not connected, or not 2-connected.

To test if a graph is connected, we already have the function is_connected which does the job very efficiently through depth-first-searches.

We also have a function is_strongly_connected for DiGraphs.

To test if a Graph is 2-connected, we can first :
*  compute a strongly_connected_orientation with a linear-time function
*  check whether the returned graph is strongly-connected ( linear time too )

Without this, much time is spent over building a useless Linear Program.

Nathann, I tried before the patch but got:

```

ValueError: There does not seem to be any Linear Program solver installed. Please visit http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/ to install CBC or GLPK.

Hello !!!!

Actually, the patch works with any LP solver which is installed.
What you get is is a totally unrelated "bug". After installing the package corresponding to a LP solver, the user has to run "sage -b" but has no way to know about it for the moment. There is an update of GLPK waiting for review (#8298) and Cbc will follow (#8171). Sorry for the trouble !

This patch just avoids the use of LP when it is possible -- when the graph isn't connected, or not 2-connected. The functions used are written in Cython, which makes them almost instantaneous to use. Actually, checking the connectivity for low values this way is even faster than just generating the linear program, so it definitely is good to have :-)

thanks Nathann for your answer.
I successfully installed the cbc package from http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/ in 4.3.3
(btw, there are several compiler warnings during compilation, on a 64-bit Core 2 Duo).
*Before* applying your patch, I get:

```
sage: g = 2 * graphs.PetersenGraph() 
sage: g.edge_connectivity() 
0.0
sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(10) 
sage: g.edge_connectivity() 
1.0
sage: g = digraphs.ButterflyGraph(3) 
sage: g.edge_connectivity() 
0.0
sage: g = 2 * graphs.PetersenGraph() 
sage: g.vertex_connectivity() 
0.0
sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(10) 
sage:  g.vertex_connectivity() 
1.0
sage: g = digraphs.ButterflyGraph(3) 
sage: g.vertex_connectivity() 
0.0
```
thus it seems to me some work is needed, because according to the patch documentation, after
applying the patch I will get integer values instead of floating-point numbers, which may break
some code using those functions.

Now the patch gives floating-point values as before.
However I wonder why those values are floating-point numbers and not integers, since for example
the connectivity is an integer according to the reference wikipedia page.

(This might be solved in a further ticket, thus I give a positive review for the present one.)

The reason is that this function handles weighted edges, and those edges may be weighted with floating-point values :-)

I am myself only interested by "topological" connectivity, in which all edges are weighted with 1, but I do not really mind as long as connectivity() == k works... 

Thank you very much for your help !!!
