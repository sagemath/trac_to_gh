I'm posting an spkg to update Python from 2.6.2 to 2.6.4.  The changes from the previous spkg: in spkg-install, I have removed the lines

```
# This tells Bash to exit the script if any statement returns a non-true
# value.
set -e
```
Reason: in this part of the script, we want to test the return values and print a helpful message if they're not true, rather than just exit silently.

I've also removed the patch for the file `src/Lib/ctypes/__init__.py`, because I think it only deals with Mac OS X, 10.3 or earlier, and we don't support that.  Does Sage even build on pre-10.4 systems?

I looked at the other patches, and I think we still need them, but I'm not an expert.  (I tried removing the pickle patches, for instance, and got lots of doctest failures.)

I've added a patch file for socket.py: what we're patching hasn't changed, but in the previous spkg, there wasn't a patch file recording it.

The spkg is here: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/python-2.6.4.p0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/python-2.6.4.p0.spkg).

Actually, I'm not sure I see the point of another patch, the one to pkgutil.py.  The SPKG.txt file says

```
 * Patch pkgutil.patch: Make Python's help command work in Sage, work
   around failures for locals.
```
I built an spkg without this patch, and it seems to work fine, but I may very well be missing something.  That version is here: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/python-2.6.4.p1.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/python-2.6.4.p1.spkg).

With both of these spkg's, I see one new doctest failure, but I don't know if it's significant.  If it's not significant, it's easy enough to fix the doctest.  It's for `sage/misc/explain_pickle.py` -- see the last line ("(cPickle raised an exception!)"):
