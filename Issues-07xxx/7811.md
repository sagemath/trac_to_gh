We need to account for this difference

```
$ grep compile twist.py template.py
twist.py:re_valid_username = re.compile('[a-z|A-Z|0-9|_|.|@]*')
template.py:css_illegal_re = re.compile(r'[^-A-Za-z_0-9]')
```
when processing the checkboxes in a worksheet listing.  Otherwise, the Archive, Stop, and Delete buttons will not work for users whose login names contain dots (`.`) or [at signs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign) (`@`).

This is a follow-up to #7332.  See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9da7dd211fe5570b) for the bug report.
