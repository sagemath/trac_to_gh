Since the ticket description is rather sparse, I'm collecting here some statements that emerged from reading the patch and discussing with Nicolas, who is sitting beside me.

* It disposes of abstract categories. Hooray!
* On the one hand, one has (abstract) vectorspaces. A realization of such abstract vector space is given by specific data, for example by a basis, but it should be emphasized that not all realizations of a vector space are necessarily in terms of a basis. So, not any realization of a vectorspace is a "vectorspace with basis".
* The realizations of a vector space are related by canonical morphisms (for example, change of basis).
* Is any "vectorspace with basis" a realisation of a vector space? No! There is no gurantee that this specific vectorspace with basis is equiped with the above-mentioned canonical morphisms. 

**__TODO__**

* The docstring of the class `Category_realization` has no examples. Its `__init__` method should define its arguments and provide a test. `_get_name` is not documented either.
* Similarly, `Realizations` is undocumented.
* `Realizations.super_categories()` returns `[Sets()]`. Idea of Nicolas: Add an optional argument `Realizations(parent, category=Bla)`, so that the default for Bla is `Sets()`. The given category will be returned as super category.

* I tried some example, with comments/questions inserted:

 ```
 sage: C = Algebras(QQ)
 sage: C.WithRealizations()
 Join of Category of algebras over Rational Field and Category of sets with realizations
 ```
 Does it really have to be a join category?

 ```
 sage: from sage.categories.category_types import Category_realization
 sage: Category_realization(QQ)
 The category of category_realization of Rational Field
 ```
 So, do I understand correctly that the set of all realisations of `QQ` forms a category, each object being a realisation of `QQ`, the morphisms being canonical maps between the different realisations?

 ```
 sage: Category_realization(QQ).is_subcategory(Rings().WithRealizations())
 BOOM
 sage: hasattr(Category_realization(QQ), 'super_categories')
 False
 ```
 So, that's a bug. `Category_realization(QQ)` is a category and thus MUST have a `super_categories` method.


**__Is the category of "Bla with realisations" a 2-category?__**

Since Nicolas is now teaching, I can not ask him directly:

* If I understand correctly, for any parent P there is a *category* `Category_realizations(P)`.
* For any category C, there is a category `C.WithRealizations()`.
* Shouldn't it be the case that for any `P in C`, the realisations of P (thus, the *category* `Category_realizations(P)`) is an object in `C.WithRealizations()`?
* But if the objects of `C.WithRealizations()` are categories themselves, shouldn't we first implement the notion of higher categories in Sage, before we treat the category of realizations of objects of C?

No, it isn't. I had a totally wrong notion of a higher category. Sorry.

    "body": "<a id='comment:9'></a>\nHi Nicolas,\n\nI just posted a\n[review patch](http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/file/a9bb0e6af448/trac_7980-multiple-realizations-review-fh.patch)\non sage-combinat queue. Here are the main changes\n\n1. This is mostly documentation, except that I changed trivially the code in\nthe example, by renaming some parameter names:\n\n- in `SubsetAlgebra(S)` the parameter S is a set;\n\n- in `Fundamental(S)`, `In(S)` and `Out(S)` it is a\n  `SubsetAlgebra`;\n\nI was really confused about that reading the code so that I renamed `S`\nto `SAlg` in the second case and added an `INPUT:` field in the doc\n\n2.

Hi Nicolas,

I just posted a
[review patch](http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/file/a9bb0e6af448/trac_7980-multiple-realizations-review-fh.patch)
on sage-combinat queue. Here are the main changes

1. This is mostly documentation, except that I changed trivially the code in
the example, by renaming some parameter names:

- in `SubsetAlgebra(S)` the parameter S is a set;

- in `Fundamental(S)`, `In(S)` and `Out(S)` it is a
  `SubsetAlgebra`;

I was really confused about that reading the code so that I renamed `S`
to `SAlg` in the second case and added an `INPUT:` field in the doc

2. The correct markup for see also is the following:

```
.. seealso::
   bla bla bla
   bla bla 
```
as variants, you can use uppercase as Sphinx markup is not case sensitive. You
can also put everything on one line if it fits:

```
.. SEEALSO:: bla bla bla
```
If you put a space as in `..see also::` then this become a comment and is
ignored by Sphinx ! This remind me that I should finish #12078 Add an example
of SEE ALSO

3. There is a missing doctest in my review patch

```
    sage: A.F() in A.Realizations()
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```
I left it on purpose. I realize that the correct doctest is

```
    sage: A.F() in A.Bases()
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```
But it took me quite a lot of thinking understanding that. I think we should
explain this somewhere, probably where the broken test is.

Please review my numerous doc change, fold the patch if you are Ok with it.

Florent

Thanks!

I went through it, folded it in, and added a

Good point. I ended up renaming SAlg to A since this is what we use in
all the examples.

Ouch! That's not good. I am not sure this is the best approach, but I
added A.Realizations() to the super categories Bases(A). Maybe
A.Realizations() should be Bases(A) instead. In any cases, that will
work for now. I added A._test_realizations() which checks:

```
    R in A.Realizations() for R in A.realizations()
```

Feel free to fold in my review patch and repost after checking it out.

I should have mentioned that it is in on the Sage-Combinat queue, and the review by Florent is occuring here. In such situations it's a waste of time to update the patch on trac all the time; and leaving an outdated patch on trac is not so good either (someone might waste time reviewing old stuff).
