Vanilla hg accepts something like

  hg commit -m 'some comment'

However, if hg is a script that calls "sage -hg" (like /usr/local/bin/hg on sage.math.washington.edu), then the above command does not work.

The following was issued on the above server:

```
mkdir a
cd a
hg init
echo "abc def" > abc
hg add abc
hg commit -m 'some comment'
comment: No such file or directory
abort: file comment not found!
```
