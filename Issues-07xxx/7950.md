1. Factoring of 0 should raise an error like it does over ZZ, but doesn't right now:

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(ZZ,0,'')
sage: P(10).factor()
10
sage: P(0).factor()
0
sage: factor(0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ArithmeticError                           Traceback (most recent call last)
```

2. The element 10 in the polynomial ring "ZZ[]" in 0-variables is actually *not* a unit.  So it is wrong that it is put in the "unit" slot of the factorization.   Notice how factoring 10 works:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: (10*x).factor()
2 * 5 * x
sage: list((10*x).factor())
[(2, 1), (5, 1), (x, 1)]
```
In particular, the 10 is *not* treated incorrectly as a unit.

So I think this patch needs work.
