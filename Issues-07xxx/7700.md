This file:

```
sage-4.3.rc0/spkg/standard/extcode-4.3.rc0/sage/ext/mac-app/Sage.app/Contents/MacOS/Sage
```

is a mysterious 80K binary program that does something.  Where did it come from?  What does it do?  Who made it?  How can I easily recreate it from source?    

If the answer is: "it's a binary from some random guy of the 'net that nobody knows"... then maybe we should be worried!

How to resolve this ticket:  For starters, add a README.txt to the directory: sage-4.3.rc0/data/extcode/sage/ext/mac-app that answers the above questions.

Even better would be if we could document how to use Xcode and InterfaceBuilder directly to do something like this (as opposed to the black box of Platypus.  "Platypus creates applications with a special binary that launches a specified script and captures its output."  One nice thing about it, on the other hand, is it should be able to easily create something that would take a .sage, .sws, or .py file and run it just by dropping it on the icon.

We should also have some sort of environment variable that would ask the user on start if they want notebook or command line, or something like that.  But of course now we're beyond this ticket; just recording the idea for now.

Also note that this doesn't affect most users, since we are not bdist-ing the app bundle by default yet.  Since this is really about the distribution of Sage in Mac, I'm also changing the component accordingly.

It is in fact the actual program that platypus creates which handles the gui etc. of the application.  It just runs the script with the options in Resources/AppSettings.plist (though I guess I should read the platypus source to ensure that's all it does)

I will be happy to create a readme and a script to recreate these files (I thinking of adding it to sage -bdist, but I'm not sure that's the best place for it).  I'm taking finals right now so it may be a week or so before I get to it.

I would certainly not be opposed to a hand coded app, but platypus is definitely easier and since it's not clear how many people will actually use it I didn't want to spend too much time on it.

As for dropping files and having them open, that was what I wanted to work on next, but when I [asked on sage-devel about a month ago](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/b685a7396f627816/7ea17ebd69df26bd?lnk=gst&q=andrus#7ea17ebd69df26bd) I got no feedback, so I would definitely like to know what the desired behavior would be.

All the Platypus thing does is to run that script, but with a nice little window around it - you may want to try -bdisting with the appropriate app bundle variable set and seeing for yourself.  I don't know that we can avoid having the Terminal fire up without doing something equivalent to that, even without Platypus.

I was just trying to address the myth that .app bundles are complicated, messy things--I agree that the script can (and should) do more. 

In terms of isolating the sage notebook from browsing, firefox has a -no-remote option that may be possible to use. It is also possible to start up to separate instances of Safari (by invoking the binary directly, though I haven't investigated how the two instances interact...)

In any case, this ticket is about documenting what exactly that is, and you've done a fine job, so +1 from me too.
