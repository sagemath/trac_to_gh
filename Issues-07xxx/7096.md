This looks like something which should be easy to fix.

One month of hard work later:  first impressions were deceptive!

While looking at the code of `{dual()`, I found a second bug in this

```
E = EllipticCurve(GF(7),[1,-1,1,-3,3])
phi = E.isogeny(E([1,0]))
phi.dual()
```

gives a ZeroDivisionError. Only separable isogenies are implented, so one can not possibly take the dual of this separable isogeny of degree 7 in chracteristic 7. A quick check should be introduced here.

Yet another, bigger problem with dual() : Say E -> E' is an isogeny of degree d, then all the algorithm does is creating an isogeny E' -> E of degree d. This does not guarantee that it is the dual; it could be the dual composed with an automorphism, like [-1]. This probably happens quite often as it uses `WeierstrassIsomorphism(E,E')`. This returns one of the isomorphisms without any control of it, hence often the sign will be wrong.

The function dual definitely needs a lot of work.

Now, the actual bug reported in this ticket is not in dual but occurs as

```
E1 = EllipticCurve(GF(1013),[1,-1,0,288,19])
E2 = EllipticCurve(GF(1013),[7,970,0,363,464])
EllipticCurveIsogeny(E1,None,E2,7)
```

Of course the field in the previous lines should be 1019. The output is

```
Isogeny of degree 7 from Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y = x^3 + 1018*x^2 + 288*x + 19 over Finite Field of size 1019 to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 7*x*y + 850*y = x^3 + 970*x^2 + 445*x + 202 over Finite Field of size 1019
```

which has visibly the wrong, but an isomorphic codomain.
After 1 hour of chasing through the code, I was not able to find the error. I include the author as CC in the hope that he might have an idea.

I started implementing some more related to this ticket. Especially the `formal()` for isogeny. Then there are two ideas how to compute the dual.

* I can take the implementation as it is now. This yields **a** isogeny of the correct degree
  in the opposite direction. Then I can compute the leading term of the composition in the 
  formal expansion (or simply check to what multiple the differential is pulled-back to). This 
  gives me the `WeierstrassIsomorphism` to use. I am not 100 % sure if this will work in
  all cases. Say the elliptic curve is defined over a finite field and has a cyclic isogeny of
  degree *n<sup>2</sup>* to itself. It is certain that our current implementation gives back a cyclic 
  isogeny and not just *[n]*. I fear one could find counterexamples... I have to do some 
  testings.
* Otherwise, I will try to implement the full computation of the dual via the formal group. I 
  believe that there is an algorithm with running time *O(n)* for an isogeny of prime degree 
  *n*. Though I have not checked this in details. It would only involve to compute the first 
  *2n* coefficients in *[n]* and the `division_polynomial` in the formal expansion. The 
  one example I have computed so far by hand was a failure :(. One obstacle here will be the 
  fact that `.reversion()` is only defined for power-series with coefficients in **Q**.

à suivre.

I found another issue with isogenies.

```
E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
E2 = EllipticCurve('11a2')
E2.isogeny(None,codomain=E1,degree=5)
```

fails with 

```
ValueError: Codomain parameter must be isomorphic to computed codomain isogeny
```

while `E.isogeny(None,codomain=E2,degree=5)` works fine. The reason is that the algorithm for computing the kernel polynomial in `compute_isogeny_starks` is only valid for **normalised** isogenies. 

Stark's algorithm is implemented in ell_curve_isogeny.py from scratch and so it contains the computation of the formal expansion of the Weierstrass p function. I wonder if we should add as another possible algorithm to do the same sort of computation, but using the already existing code for formal groups instead. ....

Yet another bug with `dual`. I have to chase that. It does not look like being related to the previously reported bugs.

```
k = GF(103)
E = EllipticCurve(k,[1,0,0,1,-1])
P = E(60,85)
phi = E.isogeny(P)
phi.dual()
```

gives

```
IndexError: list index out of range

    "body": "<a id='comment:11'></a>\nOK. Here we go. That is a patch for this ticket that I would like to be reviewed.\n\nI explain all the changes it introduces as it is quite a long and complicated patch. (I like the fact that the initial comment on the ticket was *\"This looks like something which should be easy to fix.\"* while it took me a month of quite hard work.)\n\n* I moved the computation of the weierstrass p-function into a seperate file ell_wp.py.\n  I also completely clean it. It used to contain a lot of functions on power series that\n  are already implemented in sage. There is an option now to call the pari version.\n* I added a `weierstrass_p` to ell_field.py.\n* Having redone all the weierstrass_p with laurent and power series rather than with \n  polynomials, also got rid of the `IndexError` mentioned above.\n* The dual is now correct and not just up to an automorphism.\n* When trying to give an isogeny with a codomain, it now checks if the algorithm fails\n  (typically because there is no cyclic normalized isogeny of this degree). This eliminates a\n  bad bug that was known in the code.\n* We can now take duals of non-normalized isogenies\n* There is a new function `formal` that computes the formal expansion of the isogeny.\n* This `formal` can be used to check if the isogeny is normalized; this simplifies and\n  corrects the previous code (which is still there but deprecated).\n* I included a check to forbid `dual` of isogenies of degree divisible by the \n  charactersitic.\n* I updated a lot of the documentation of isogenies.\n* And I also changed the starting documentation of ell_generic.py to clarify what we mean by\n  an elliptic curve in sage.\n \nThere is still a lot that should be done about isogenies for elliptic curves. I hope this patch corrects and clarifies what is possible right now. For further things that one could wish for in sage concerning isogenies and endomorphisms I opened ticket #7368 as a follow up.\n\nNote that this ticket also includes the correction asked for in #7307.",

OK. Here we go. That is a patch for this ticket that I would like to be reviewed.

I explain all the changes it introduces as it is quite a long and complicated patch. (I like the fact that the initial comment on the ticket was *"This looks like something which should be easy to fix."* while it took me a month of quite hard work.)

* I moved the computation of the weierstrass p-function into a seperate file ell_wp.py.
  I also completely clean it. It used to contain a lot of functions on power series that
  are already implemented in sage. There is an option now to call the pari version.
* I added a `weierstrass_p` to ell_field.py.
* Having redone all the weierstrass_p with laurent and power series rather than with 
  polynomials, also got rid of the `IndexError` mentioned above.
* The dual is now correct and not just up to an automorphism.
* When trying to give an isogeny with a codomain, it now checks if the algorithm fails
  (typically because there is no cyclic normalized isogeny of this degree). This eliminates a
  bad bug that was known in the code.
* We can now take duals of non-normalized isogenies
* There is a new function `formal` that computes the formal expansion of the isogeny.
* This `formal` can be used to check if the isogeny is normalized; this simplifies and
  corrects the previous code (which is still there but deprecated).
* I included a check to forbid `dual` of isogenies of degree divisible by the 
  charactersitic.
* I updated a lot of the documentation of isogenies.
* And I also changed the starting documentation of ell_generic.py to clarify what we mean by
  an elliptic curve in sage.
 
There is still a lot that should be done about isogenies for elliptic curves. I hope this patch corrects and clarifies what is possible right now. For further things that one could wish for in sage concerning isogenies and endomorphisms I opened ticket #7368 as a follow up.

Note that this ticket also includes the correction asked for in #7307.
