Currently, SageNB makes use of `distutils`. The standard method of package distribution, though, is [setuptools](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools). This has several advantages, the foremost being a `setup.py develop` command, which bypasses the need to reinstall the package in order to propagate a change, as well as the ability to upload the package to PyPI with a single command. There is also additional functionality regards packaging, etc.

These tools are orthogonal to usage of `setuptools`, to note.

I personally make use of Virtualenv and Pip all the time for deployment. They're very useful for keeping one's site-packages clean.
