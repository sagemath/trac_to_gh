Currently, SageNB makes use of `distutils`. The standard method of package distribution, though, is [setuptools](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools).

These tools are orthogonal to usage of `setuptools`, to note.

I personally make use of Virtualenv and Pip all the time for deployment. They're very useful for keeping one's site-packages clean.

I believe something like this should do the trick:

```
from pkg_resources import Requirement, working_set
version = working_set.find9Requirement.parse('sagenb')).version
