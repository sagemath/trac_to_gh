```
Currently there is no direct way in Sage to apply the transformation:

```
log(x) + log(y) -> log(x*y)
```

The attached patch fixes this by inserting a call to logcontract()
in the definition of simplify_radical.

Now the following works:

```
sage: f = log(sqrt(2) - 1) + log(sqrt(2) + 1)
sage: f.simplify_full()
0
```

But I'm not sure if this is the right place for this.

Do not do it please. The user knows if he/she wants to contract logarithms or not and then he/she can run the coresponding method. If you include this as an automatical simplification in simplify_full, consider the following

* domain of log(1-x)+log(1+x) is different from domain of log(1-x^2)

* you should add a function which expands logarithms

Thanks

I disagree.  simplify_full is the sort of thing used by people who do NOT know if they want to contract - they want the simplest-looking form possible.  In fact, these people usually use just simplify() first and then email sage-support complaining it doesn't do things like this :)  

Anyone who is looking for something specific can use the specific wrappers for the Maxima simplifiers; the general user who is not actually interested in symbolics or niceties like domains (which presumably the other simplifiers also disrespect, e.g. x**2/x is not x but presumably one of them does this and is part of simplify_full) needs a function which applies as much machinery as possible, and simplify_full is it.

That said, wrapping more of the expanding functions is a very good idea!  One could even have an "expand_full" function to complement the "simplify_full".  

(Unfortunately, many users (including me) get tripped on on simplify versus expand linguistically, because in colloquial high school English they are often used interchangeably... sigh, but I'm just as guilty as anyone.)

<a id='comment:9'></a>Here are a few comments, which you can incorporate if you agree with them.  Overall, though, a VERY well documented patch, which tells the user exactly what they can and cannot do with it, options, etc.  Good work!

1. typo of "gowerns" instead of "governs" in line 5268

2. Maybe the if coeff is not None:  should be set off in a block? For better readability and logical flow.

3. Perhaps 

```
sage: (log(5)-log(2)).simplify_log()
-log(2) + log(5)
```
should be included as a doctest, with a comment that this is not simplified (though it's not mathematically wrong, so I am okay with this being as is).  This will also encourage us to upgrade Maxima :)

4. There are some duplicated doctests.  Is this intentional (i.e., to show it won't simplify any more)?  Since 

```
sage: x,y,t=var('x y t') 
sage: f = log(x)+2*log(y)+1/2*log(t) 
sage: f.simplify_log()
log(x*y^2) + 1/2*log(t)
sage: f
1/2*log(t) + log(x) + 2*log(y)
```
it must have some other rationale.  Anyway, that should be clarified, or the duplicates should be removed, as this is confusing.

We should be able to provide an interface to all these "rewriting" tasks through a few conceptually defined methods like rewrite(), expand() and combine()( or contract()?).

Francois Maltey had a proposal for a possible interface to all this. Maybe he can comment here, or we can discuss his proposal on sage-devel.

Reviewer patch adds some additional doctests, fixes typos, clarifies a few other things.  It also fixes a bug which may not have appeared on the author's platform, essentially the same one as in the 5-bugfix patch but for the log_expand function.  

I don't really understand why the original code didn't work, because it should!  But for some reason the logexpand variable was sticking around, also messing up other doctests in expression.pyx, for me, so I made this change.  Only this change needs review now; all else is enthusiastic positive review!

<a id='comment:23'></a>The reviwer patch seems to be O.K. for me. Thanks for fixing typos and adding docs. Running tests now.

restoring default value of logexpand was not necessary, since 'ev' environment has been used in my original patch and this has no influence to the value of logexpand

```
sage: maxima('logexpand')
true
sage: maxima('ev(log(x*y),logexpand:false)')
log(x*y)
sage: maxima('logexpand')
true
sage: maxima('ev(log(x*y),logexpand:super)')
log(y)+log(x)
sage: maxima('logexpand')
true
```

but the current method without 'ev' enviroment is also O.K. and perhaps better, since ev may lead sometimes to some other problems and should be avoided if possible (as I understand discussions related (for example)to substitution from maxima group).
