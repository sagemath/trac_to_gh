```
Currently there is no direct way in Sage to apply the transformation:

```
log(x) + log(y) -> log(x*y)
```

The attached patch fixes this by inserting a call to logcontract()
in the definition of simplify_radical.

Now the following works:

```
sage: f = log(sqrt(2) - 1) + log(sqrt(2) + 1)
sage: f.simplify_full()
0
```

But I'm not sure if this is the right place for this.

Do not do it please. The user knows if he/she wants to contract logarithms or not and then he/she can run the coresponding method. If you include this as an automatical simplification in simplify_full, consider the following

I disagree.  simplify_full is the sort of thing used by people who do NOT know if they want to contract - they want the simplest-looking form possible.  In fact, these people usually use just simplify() first and then email sage-support complaining it doesn't do things like this :)  

Anyone who is looking for something specific can use the specific wrappers for the Maxima simplifiers; the general user who is not actually interested in symbolics or niceties like domains (which presumably the other simplifiers also disrespect, e.g. x**2/x is not x but presumably one of them does this and is part of simplify_full) needs a function which applies as much machinery as possible, and simplify_full is it.

That said, wrapping more of the expanding functions is a very good idea!  One could even have an "expand_full" function to complement the "simplify_full".  

(Unfortunately, many users (including me) get tripped on on simplify versus expand linguistically, because in colloquial high school English they are often used interchangeably... sigh, but I'm just as guilty as anyone.)

note that something does not work as expected due to recently fixed Maxima [bug](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2835634&group_id=4933&atid=104933).

As a particular example (log(5)-log(2)).logcontract() does not work now, (log(x)-log(y)).logcontract() works as expected.

Here are a few comments, which you can incorporate if you agree with them.  Overall, though, a VERY well documented patch, which tells the user exactly what they can and cannot do with it, options, etc.  Good work!

1. typo of "gowerns" instead of "governs" in line 5268

2. Maybe the if coeff is not None:  should be set off in a block? For better readability and logical flow.

3. Perhaps 

```
sage: (log(5)-log(2)).simplify_log()
-log(2) + log(5)
```
should be included as a doctest, with a comment that this is not simplified (though it's not mathematically wrong, so I am okay with this being as is).  This will also encourage us to upgrade Maxima :)

4. There are some duplicated doctests.  Is this intentional (i.e., to show it won't simplify any more)?  Since 

```
sage: x,y,t=var('x y t') 
sage: f = log(x)+2*log(y)+1/2*log(t) 
sage: f.simplify_log()
log(x*y^2) + 1/2*log(t)
sage: f
1/2*log(t) + log(x) + 2*log(y)
```
it must have some other rationale.  Anyway, that should be clarified, or the duplicates should be removed, as this is confusing.

Many thanks for reviewing and comments. New patch is there. It accepts your suggestions and adds more:

If we contract logarithms, we have to build the way back - I added expansion of logarithms.

I also updated simplification of rational functions and added one option to simplify_trig.

An additional thought on this:

And to be honest, we should reset logexpand anyway, because after using log_expand one might want to do something else with Maxima where one might want the default logexpand setting, and be surprised that logexpand had been changed by log_expand.

The reviwer patch seems to be O.K. for me. Thanks for fixing typos and adding docs. Running tests now.

restoring default value of logexpand was not necessary, since 'ev' environment has been used in my original patch and this has no influence to the value of logexpand

```
sage: maxima('logexpand')
true
sage: maxima('ev(log(x*y),logexpand:false)')
log(x*y)
sage: maxima('logexpand')
true
sage: maxima('ev(log(x*y),logexpand:super)')
log(y)+log(x)
sage: maxima('logexpand')
true
```

but the current method without 'ev' enviroment is also O.K. and perhaps better, since ev may lead sometimes to some other problems and should be avoided if possible (as I understand discussions related (for example)to substitution from maxima group).

It shouldn't have, but for some reason it did in my installation - specifically in some tests in solve and friends which had logs in their answers that mysteriously began simplifying!  Anyway, glad you think this solution is okay.
