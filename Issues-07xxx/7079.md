With a freshly compiled Sage 4.1.2.alpha4, or take the sage.math binary for Sage 4.1.2.alpha4, follow these steps and watch the carnage:

1. Delete the directory HOME/.sage, yes that directory and everything under it. Or you could just make sure that HOME/.sage/tmp doesn't exist. Yes, it's "tmp", not "temp".
2. Go to SAGE_ROOT.
3. Open SAGE_ROOT/makefile and give the variable NUM_THREADS a positive integer such as 2, or say anything positive integer from 2 to 10 on sage.math.
4. From SAGE_ROOT, do "make ptestlong" and watch Sage give a bunch of file not found errors:

I've tried following your steps (with NUM_THREADS=2), and it's running smoothly, though with

A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.

and a couple more like this.  I'll investigate these cases and any others that arise.

The "mysterious" errors (of which there were 14) seem to be cases where Sage 4.1.2.alpha4 crashes 
(on my Mac OS X 10.6.1).  E.g.,

```
sage -t -verbose "devel/sage/sage/functions/hyperbolic.py"  
...
Trying:
    arccosh._evalf_(Integer(2), Integer(53))###line 13:_sage_    >>> arccosh._evalf_(2, 53)
Expecting:
    1.31695789692482
ok
...
Trying:
    bool(diff(csch(x), x) == diff(Integer(1)/sinh(x), x))###line 185:_sage_    >>> bool(diff(csch(x), x) == diff(1/sinh(x), x))
Expecting:
    True
         [16.9 s]
exit code: 768
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t -verbose "devel/sage/sage/functions/hyperbolic.py"

I think the patch is a good idea.  It basically works for me on Mac OS X 10.5 and on sage.math.  Maybe it should get a positive review and then we should work on the "mysterious" errors. On sage.math, if I don't apply the patch, delete my .sage directory, and do parallel doctesting, it's a complete disaster.  Once I apply the patch, if I delete my .sage directory, and while in SAGE_ROOT I do `sage -tp 2 devel/sage/sage/algebras`, then I get 

```
init.sage does not exist ... creating
touch: cannot touch `/home/palmieri/.sage//init.sage': No such file or directory
Global iterations: 1
File iterations: 1
No cached timings exist; will create upon successful finish.
Doctesting 21 files doing 2 jobs in parallel
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/algebras/free_algebra_quotient.py
A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
```
and then all of the other doctests pass.  This is not related, I think, to the problems on Mac OS X 10.6: if I do it again (but with an existing .sage directory), all tests pass.  Maybe the issue is that one thread is running a doctest while another is still busy creating .sage and all of its subdirectories, and so the doctest crashes?

Should we run one test and then switch to parallel testing, or should we run the script (whatever it is) that creates .sage, and then go on to parallel testing?

So I don't know if this should get a positive review and the mysterious crashes should be in a separate ticket, since that would solve most of the problem, or if this should be marked "needs work" and the whole thing fixed at once...

That's what I think.  So I've switched to to that, applied it, and opened a new ticket: #7103
