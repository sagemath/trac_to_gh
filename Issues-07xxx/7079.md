With a freshly compiled Sage 4.1.2.alpha4, or take the sage.math binary for Sage 4.1.2.alpha4, follow these steps and watch the carnage:

1. Delete the directory HOME/.sage, yes that directory and everything under it. Or you could just make sure that HOME/.sage/tmp doesn't exist. Yes, it's "tmp", not "temp".
2. Go to SAGE_ROOT.
3. Open SAGE_ROOT/makefile and give the variable NUM_THREADS a positive integer such as 2, or say anything positive integer from 2 to 10 on sage.math.
4. From SAGE_ROOT, do "make ptestlong" and watch Sage give a bunch of file not found errors:

This seems very strange.  Lines 606-608 of SAGE_ROOT/local/bin are

which, apart from the non-standard indent, seem perfectly ok.  In particular, line 608 can never be executed if the directory VALGRIND exists.  And yet this is what seems to be happening for you.

I've tried following your steps (with NUM_THREADS=2), and it's running smoothly, though with

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py
A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
```
and a couple more like this.  I'll investigate these cases and any others that arise.

The "mysterious" errors (of which there were 14) seem to be cases where Sage 4.1.2.alpha4 crashes 
(on my Mac OS X 10.6.1).  E.g.,

```
sage -t -verbose "devel/sage/sage/functions/hyperbolic.py"  
...
Trying:
    arccosh._evalf_(Integer(2), Integer(53))###line 13:_sage_    >>> arccosh._evalf_(2, 53)
Expecting:
    1.31695789692482
ok
...
Trying:
    bool(diff(csch(x), x) == diff(Integer(1)/sinh(x), x))###line 185:_sage_    >>> bool(diff(csch(x), x) == diff(1/sinh(x), x))
Expecting:
    True
         [16.9 s]
exit code: 768
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t -verbose "devel/sage/sage/functions/hyperbolic.py"
Total time for all tests: 16.9 seconds
```

That's what I think.  So I've switched to to that, applied it, and opened a new ticket: #7103
