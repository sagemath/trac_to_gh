If you look at the error, you'll see that it is expecting an
alphanumeric variable name, but got '(1 + O(3^5))*x' instead.  This
is because it is using the .gen() method and that's how the
generator prints out.  The patch changes it so that it uses the
variable_name() method instead which doesn't have the (1 + O(3^5))
part.

Applies fine, passes the tests.. It took me 10 times the amount of time somebody knowing this class would have needed, but it is ok :-)
