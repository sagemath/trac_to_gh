A method could be added to the `VigenereCryptosystem` class in `src/sage/crypto/classical.py`. I would suggest calling the method something like `cryptanalyze`. If more than one method of cryptanalysis is implemented, then I would suggest providing an `algorithm` keyword argument, so the user can choose between them.

Follow-up ticket: The `AffineCryptosystem` and `ShiftCryptosystem` classes have methods `rank_by_chi_square`, `rank_by_squared_differences`, and `brute_force`. I would suggest making them all available from a single `cryptanalyze` method (with `algorithm` keyword argument) so they are easier to find.

Isn't the current method better as rank_by_chi_square, rank_by_squared_differences are only methods of ranking brute force results rather than being different methods of cryptanalysis themselves.
