[`pkg_resources`](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PkgResources) is the official way to access data directories in a `setuptools` package. Using `pkg_resources` to locate the `DATA` directory will allow us to use [`.pth` files](http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/02/06/using-pth-files-for-python-development/) for ease of development. For example:

```
$ pwd
/home/timdumol/devel/sagenb-0.3.5/src
$ dev_dir=`pwd`
$ cd /opt/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/
$ rm -r sagenb*
$ cat "$dev_dir" > sagenb.pth
```

Thus, there will no longer be a need to `sage -python setup.py install` after every change.

**Attachment:** [trac_7402-pkg_resources.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7402/trac_7402-pkg_resources.patch.gz)

This patch should do it.

As a note, we won't even need to restart the server if all we edit are template files. A big plus in ease of development, IMHO.

Since this is only used for development, I don't think there's much of a problem. It should be possible to fix by making Sphinx read the .pth file and look there, but I am inexperienced regarding that.

Regards the --dev-mode thing, I just noticed that SageNB uses disttools, not setuptools, which is why the `sage -python setup.py develop` command does not exist. This is now #7467.
