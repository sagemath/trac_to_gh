def surface_to_stl(surface):
    """
    Return an STL representation of the surface.
    
    INPUT:
        - `surface` -- any surface, eg. output of a 3d plot function.
    
    OUTPUT:
        A string that represents the surface in the STL format.
    
    COMMENTS:
        (1) You must view the surface before plotting it.
            Otherwise, this will not work.
        (2) In order to do 3d printing with this, you will need to
            convert it into gcode. Skeinforge is an open-source
            program that can do this.
        (3) The size of the surface is not normalized in export.
            Sage's units will become the units of the STL 
            description. These seem to be ~0.05 cm (at least when 
            printed using skeinforge -> replicatorg -> hacklab.to's 
            cupcake).
        (4) Be aware of the overhang limits of your 3d printer; 
            most printers can only handle an overhang of Pi/2 (45*) 
            before your model will start drooping.
    
    EXAMPLES:
        sage: x,y,z = var('x,y,z')
        sage: a = implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2-9, [x,-5,5], [y,-5,5],[z,-5,5])
        sage: a
        sage: f=file.open("foo.stl",'w')

        sage: f.close()

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
Useful for 3D printers, see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12784 for an interesting use case.

I have mostly rewritten the code for better efficiency.

Maybe this could be added in some way to the options of `.save` ?


And it would be much better to use the binary STL format instead.

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
I have tested the STL export by loading the result in FreeCAD, and it works. I have now added the "more modern" xml-based AMF format, but not tested that it works sor far, as FreeCAD is not able to load that file format.

It is necessary to compress the AMF file with ZIP..

I am looking at it.

Some comments:

Would there be some way to doctest the saving feature? Maybe saving to a temporary file, then reading it, showing some part of the content and erasing.

The warning about only working for triangulated surfaces should go in a Warning section

Otherwise the code looks good, although i am having some trouble to rebase it to latest version in order to test it.
