The markup is inserted dynamically.  To view live changes in Safari / Chrome, evaluate an `interact` cell, right-click on the output, and select "Inspect Element."  This should open the "Web Inspector" / "Developer Tools," which should also be available under some menu (the location and name depend on the browser, OS, etc.).  Anyway, try browsing to the cell under "Elements" (an instantaneous tree-like representation of the page).

Opera and IE8 have similar, built-in tools.  For Firefox, I suggest installing the [Firebug extension](http://getfirebug.com/).
