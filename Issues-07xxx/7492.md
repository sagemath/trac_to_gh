As the title says, the Birkhoff–von Neumann Theorem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkhoff%E2%80%93von_Neumann_Theorem) says that any doubly stochastic matrix ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_stochastic_matrix ) can be written as a convex sum of permutations.

This patch requires several other patches to be applied first ( or merged into Sage ) :

* #8364
* #8166 (non-optional matching function !)

<a id='comment:7'></a>Needs work, I'm afraid.

- Firstly, there are no checks on the input type. It will happily accept non-doubly-stochastic matrices, and return garbage; and it seems to silently replace real numbers with rational approximations to them, which is frankly rather weird. The docstring should state clearly what base rings are allowed (integers? rationals? reals?) and there should be a check to make sure that the input matrix really is a doubly stochastic matrix over one of these base rings.

- The doctests won't work without an optional spkg, so they should be flagged as such.

- Non-ASCII character in the docstring (it reads as "Birkhoff[a-with-circumflex][empty-square-box][empty-square-box]von Neumann" on my system)

- There's not a lot of point in adding functions when there's no obvious way of calling them from the command line. Either this should be imported in an all.py somewhere, or (much preferably) there should be a method of one of the matrix classes that calls it.

This patch needed to be updated anyway, as it was veeeeery old and many things changed since. I will gladly add a chechking that the matrix is indeed bistochastic if you think it necessary (though I like to think of functions doing just what they are meant to, and not spend too much time checking the user is not doing anything wrong). It is not very long anyway :-)

<a id='comment:11'></a>I think the standard practice is to have an optional argument "check", which defaults to True but can be set to False if you know your input is valid and you don't want to waste time checking.

Rather than having an explicit list of allowable base rings, I suggest checking that the base ring has a canonical coercion map to RR.

Maybe you could put in a method under (perhaps) sage.matrix.matrix2 that calls this, and cross-reference between the two docstrings.
