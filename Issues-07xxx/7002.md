#auto was the old way, %auto was the new way.  Plus, we should say % directives need to happen above the input. 

To see the problem, click the "Help" in the upper right corner.  The second row is:

Any cells with "#auto" in the input is automatically evaluated when the worksheet is first opened.

This should be changed to:

Any cells with "%auto" above the input is automatically evaluated when the worksheet is first opened.

Probably, though I'm not sure how we would do a deprecation, since it is the notebook feature that is deprecated, not something in the Sage process doing the calculations.

"#auto" used to be the way to do things before Mike Hansen refactored things (in January or February, I believe).  

What I am suggesting is just that the documentation be changed to reflect the new way.  The "#auto" still works.  I'd just like to get new people using "%auto".

Oh, if it still works and we aren't getting rid of it, then probably just making the change is okay.  

Incidentally, this doesn't apply cleanly due to someone having added something about HTML above the Shell scripts thingie.  Does this patch depend on something?
