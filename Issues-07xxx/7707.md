The picklejar doctest in structure/sage_object.pyx has to be changed whenever we update the picklejar, when things get deprecated, etc.  That's silly.  Let's change the test to be like this:

```
        sage: print "x"; sage....
        x...
        Failed to unpickle 0 objects.
```

**Resolution:** fixed
