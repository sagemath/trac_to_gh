After building sage on OS X 10.6.2 with Xcode 3.2.1 (all latest versions right now, and using #7426), PARI doesn't work, which causes massive failures all over the place:

```
PARI/GP is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and comes WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.

Type ? for help, \q to quit.
Type ?12 for how to get moral (and possibly technical) support.

parisize = 8000000, primelimit = 500000
