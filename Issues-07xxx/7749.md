Add access to the names.gz file (http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/names.gz) to sloane.py so that users can access sequence names while offline.

Change the output from Python ints to Sage (see SloaneEncyclopedia[111111] for an example).

I plan to add a function SloaneEncyclopedia.sequence_name(n), rather than changing the output of __getitem__ or anything like that, to avoid backwards compatibility issues.

This will require the patch from ticket #7692.
