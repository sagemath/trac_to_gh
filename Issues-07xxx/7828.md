I did wonder whether it would be better to return a Sage integer rather than an int?

Also, I looked for places where sgn() was used/defined and found a redundant  definition of sgn() in quadratic_forms/extras.py, which I am removing in another ticket (#9068).

I will do the following now, and report back:

1. Apply both your patch and mine at #9068
2. Change the function you changed in two ways: making the return type Integer and also checking for x.sgn()
3. Test the whole library.

For the moment I have reverted this to "needs work".
