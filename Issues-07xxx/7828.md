Looks good, applies fine to 4.4.3.alpha0 and tests pass.

I did wonder whether it would be better to return a Sage integer rather than an int?

Also, I looked for places where sgn() was used/defined and found a redundant  definition of sgn() in quadratic_forms/extras.py, which I am removing in another ticket (#9068).

Well, I did look for other places where methods sgn() or sign() were defined;  since in fact I have another comment, which is that as well as looking to see if x has a method sign() you should also look for a method sgn().  The only thing I found was that function in quadratic_forms, and that distracted me from making this comment.

I will do the following now, and report back:

1. Apply both your patch and mine at #9068
2. Change the function you changed in two ways: making the return type Integer and also checking for x.sgn()
3. Test the whole library.

For the moment I have reverted this to "needs work".

OK, I did that (see the reviewer patch).  All tests pass (note that I also had my patch from #9068 applied).

I think we need an independent reviewer of the combined changes (preferably of #9068 also) so I have put it back to "needs review".

Was there a concious decision in this ticket (or elsewhere) not to standardize on either `sign()` or `sgn()`. I just saw the relevant part of `sage/functions/generalized.py`, and thought one of these is redundant.

However, I guess in this ticket and #9068 there is an implicit assumption that the methods (as opposed to functions) should be called `.sign()`.  Is that bad?
