Looks good, applies fine to 4.4.3.alpha0 and tests pass.

I did wonder whether it would be better to return a Sage integer rather than an int?

Also, I looked for places where sgn() was used/defined and found a redundant  definition of sgn() in quadratic_forms/extras.py, which I am removing in another ticket (#9068).

Well, I did look for other places where methods sgn() or sign() were defined;  since in fact I have another comment, which is that as well as looking to see if x has a method sign() you should also look for a method sgn().  The only thing I found was that function in quadratic_forms, and that distracted me from making this comment.

I will do the following now, and report back:

1. Apply both your patch and mine at #9068
2. Change the function you changed in two ways: making the return type Integer and also checking for x.sgn()
3. Test the whole library.

For the moment I have reverted this to "needs work".
