As the title says, this patch implements Graph.vertex_cover.


You could be in need of #7270 and GLPK from http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/glpk-4.38.p4.spkg depending on the version of Sage you are using !!!

I've never reviewed a patch before.

We were just talking about vertex cover in my algorithms class the other day.

The three problems:


1) Does G have a clique of size m or more?


2) Is there a vertex cover of size m or less for G?


3) Does G contain an independent set of size m or more?



are all polynomially reducible to each other.

exercise 9, p 403, The Design and Analysis of Algorithms, 2nd Edition

I'm not aware if those other problems are implemented in Sage.  If not, maybe a ticket should be created.

3048	          As vertex cover is a `NP`-complete problem

IMO, would be better with the word "an" in place of "a".

Hello !!!!

You are right, these three are reducible to each other ! Actually, Sage already has an algorithm for 1) and 3) through Cliquer, which is way more efficient that LinearProgramming... I will immediately add several lines to the patch to let it use Cliquer by default, and use LP if the users wants it ( and this way we can control the respective values of the two algorithms ) :-)

Thank you very much for your remark, this should speed up the algorithm amazingly ! :-)

Done ! Thank you very much for your help ! :-)
Besides, as the algorithm Cliquer does not require GLPK or CBC, there is a way for everybody to compute a vertex cover now :-)
