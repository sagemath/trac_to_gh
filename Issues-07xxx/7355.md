Right now this doesn't quite work: your sage-latest-online-version prints things with ".spkg" on the end, and that confuses sage-spkg. One fix is to change the line

```
v = list(set([x.strip() for x in r if x.endswith('.spkg')]))
```
to

```
v = list(set([x.strip()[:-5] for x in r if x.endswith('.spkg')]))
```
to strip off the .spkg at the end.

I'll work on a review this weekend, I hope.

I'm looking at the proposed sage-latest-online-package script and have some comments.

I don't really like the 'list.tmp' temporary file business. It's nice to check if the user has the permissions to upgrade, but I think doing so should be the job of whatever actually does the upgrade. The name of the script implies that it tells you the latest online package name, and I'd like to see it do *only* that.

I see that urlretrieve always uses a temporary file automatically (which gets deleted automatically), so perhaps we could do the first part of spkg_list like so:

```
web_url = "%s/%s"%(PKG_SERVER, url)
fn = urllib.urlretrieve(web_url)[0]
r = open(fn).read()
[etc]
```

Also, when you build the list of spkgs, why do list(set(..)), then sort the list? The listings are alphabetized anyway, and if we run into a duplicate, the script will exit on the first occurrence anyway. It looks like just this will be fine:

```
return [x.strip()[:-5] for x in r if x.endswith('.spkg')]
```
instead of 

```
v = list(set(...))
v.sort
return v
```

With the above changes, the script seems to work fine. I'd like to know if anyone uses a nonstandard SAGE_SERVER so we can make sure the script still works for such cases.

Harald Schilly says that each subdirectory of packages has a "list" file; for example, http://sagemath.org/packages/standard/list which simplifies the script even more (presuming we can depend on the "list" file being present). Something like this should be okay:

```
fn, hdrs = urllib.urlretrieve(url + '/list')
spkgs = open(fn).read().splitlines()
if spkgs[0].endswith('.spkg'):
    return spkgs
```
If you get a 404, the first line will be some html and won't be a string ending in ".spkg".
