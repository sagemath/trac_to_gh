# Issue 7065: lcalc fails - Sun Studio compiler does not accept code. (I'm not surprised)

    "body": "lcalc fails with Sun Studio as below. \n\nHaving looked at lcalc in the past, I am at all surprised. The code previously had tried to suppress assembler warnings with a GNU-specific flag. Once I removed that, and added -Wall with gcc, then gcc reported a huge number of warnings. The Sun compiler considers at least some errors, so lcalc does not build. \n\nI think the developer of lcalc should look over his code, as it clearly has many problems. \n\n\n```\nlcalc-20080205.p3/src/src/Lriemannsiegel.cc\nlcalc-20080205.p3/src/src/._.DS_Store\nlcalc-20080205.p3/src/src/cmdline.c\nlcalc-20080205.p3/src/src/Lglobals.cc\nFinished extraction\n****************************************************\nHost system\nuname -a:\nSunOS swan 5.10 Generic_139555-08 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Blade-1000\n****************************************************\n****************************************************\nCC Version\n/opt/xxxsunstudio12.1/bin/cc -v\nusage: cc [ options] files.

lcalc fails with Sun Studio as below. 

Having looked at lcalc in the past, I am at all surprised. The code previously had tried to suppress assembler warnings with a GNU-specific flag. Once I removed that, and added -Wall with gcc, then gcc reported a huge number of warnings. The Sun compiler considers at least some errors, so lcalc does not build. 

I think the developer of lcalc should look over his code, as it clearly has many problems.
