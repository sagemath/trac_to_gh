```
On HP-UX, where there is no gmp.h (the build of that failed), ratpoints is not handling this very elegently - it should check for a program like gmp before trying to use it. 

A ratpoints developer can be given access to this machine, but it seems to me a more general fix is required.

Since Sage ships `gmp.h` (by MPIR), this is a non-issue.
