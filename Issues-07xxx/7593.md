As the title says, this patch implements a function solving the maximum weight matching problem.


You could be in need of #7270 and GLPK from http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/glpk-4.38.p4.spkg depending on the version of Sage you are using !!!

Do you need to rebase this?

Sorry for the long delay in refereeing. 

It applies okay to 4.3.rc0 on ubuntu 9.04 32 bit, and passes 
sage -testall except for the failures that I got without the 
patch installed (in calculus and nf_introduction). The documentation also
looks satisfactory to me. The optional test

```
sage -t -optional "devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph.py
```
gave rise to (in particular) the following failure

```

Does this seem related to your patch? glpk is installed, to the error message
("solver not installed") seems wrong, or at least is unexpected by me.

This is indeed related to my patch, but I have a question : when you say that glpk is installed, do you mean that you installed it in the same branche where you applied the patch ? If you installed it when you were using a different branch, then switched to another one to test this patch, it will not be detected.. You need to install it in every branch where you need to use it :-)

This comes from the fact that during the installation of the procedure, the file mipGlpk.pyx is compiled and only accessible by the "current" branch. You the probably need to switch to the branch which uses matching, then to sage -f GLPK ( as it needs to be forced ) :-)

Hope this will solve it ! :-)

It should be `.. math::` instead of `.. MATH::`.  Also, it would be good to follow PEP 8 rules http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ regarding spacing -- http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ .
