As the title says, this patch implements a function solving the maximum weight matching problem.


You could be in need of #7270 and GLPK from http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/glpk-4.38.p4.spkg depending on the version of Sage you are using !!!

I could not get this to apply to sage 4.3.rc0 with glpk installed.

Do you need to rebase this?

Sorry for the long delay in refereeing. 

It applies okay to 4.3.rc0 on ubuntu 9.04 32 bit, and passes 
sage -testall except for the failures that I got without the 
patch installed (in calculus and nf_introduction). The documentation also
looks satisfactory to me. The optional test

```
sage -t -optional "devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph.py
```
gave rise to (in particular) the following failure

```
wdj@wdj-virtualbox:~/sagefiles/sage-4.3.rc0$ ./sage -t -optional "devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph.py"

Does this seem related to your patch? glpk is installed, to the error message
("solver not installed") seems wrong, or at least is unexpected by me.

The patch needs a little touching up.
