Here it is !!!

Some remarks, though :

* I copied the file conf.py, without being sure of why...
* I did not touch it either, but it may be necessary
* The two .png files, which are copied from the original directory, do not seem to be included in the patch I exported.
* As you can see, it is very quick to write translations.. I did not forget what I said about translating Sage in French. Actually, I began to look for things that needed translations and intended to write a list of it, but ended up doing other things instead... Though when I know what is to be translated, once more, it is very quick :-)

I'm sending an email to Philippe Saade, as I do not know his username to add him in Cc.

[attachment:trac_7190_add_images.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7190/trac_7190_add_images.patch) adds in the images. I'd prefer that we have only one copy of the images, but I don't know how to convince Sphinx to load the images from the en/a_tour_of_sage directory.

Nathann's patch looks good, although I can't comment on his writing.

#7353 depends on this ticket -- it switches Sphinx's language to French.

Also, should the document title (the "project" line in conf.py) be "Une tourn√©e de Sage"?
