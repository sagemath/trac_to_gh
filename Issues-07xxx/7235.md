I see it says:

**
  These binaries are only for OS X 10.4 or 10.5.  They will not work on OS X 10.3. 
**

However, that's simply wrong, since the binaries are only for the platform listed in the name of the dmg.  Argh.  That needs to be changed.  (I was thinking of a different README file when I wrote my response.)    Thanks for the bug report.

We might say: "These binaries are only for the OS X version that is indicated by the
package .dmg name.
They generally will not work on any other OS X version (unless
explicitly stated otherwise)."

See also this thread on sage-support about naming conventions:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/4c6fc409f60053f4#

BTW, on the Sage download page side-by-side with the Mac binaries (.dmg's), there is a README.txt file reading:

```
NOTE: the OS X 10.4 binary works fine on OS X 10.5. 
```
One might put more information there, too.

I must admit I'm a bit flattered. However, I'm not the author of the one-line change suggested and incorporated in the new file, as one can see in the change history's first entry.

On the other hand, we *do* agree on what to do, so I confirm that the issue at hand has a positive review.  :-)
