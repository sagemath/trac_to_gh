I'm not sure whether this is an upgrade or a new spkg, but the plan is to switch the notebook to Jinja2, which will require updating/replacing the current Jinja spkg.

John Palmieri has a proposed spkg at #6586.

"Proposed"?  It's in Sage 4.2.alpha0.

Some work needs to be done if you want to get rid of Jinja -- last time I checked, some parts of the Sage library use things from Jinja that it wasn't immediately obvious how to replace using Jinja2: see [this comment from #6586](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6586#comment:49).

Oops. I didn't know.

For this ticket, I was thinking of just getting jinja2 in. We can do another ticket later for removing jinja. I'll close this since it's already done.

This ticket isn't about switching anything to Jinja2. The title is "include jinja2 / upgrade jinja spkg", and I closed it because you had already done exactly that in 4.2.alpha0.

#7249 is about switching, and it has a patch and awaits review.
