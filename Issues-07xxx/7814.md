eclib-20080310.p7 suffered the usual problem of many packages - SAGE64 was ignored unless the operating system was OS X. This trivial patch simply ensure SAGE64 is not ignored on any platform. 

I've checked in the changes with 'hg'

Dave, I only just noticed this ticket (from the Release Notes).  I think you should have incereased the patch level from p8 to p9 - there now exist two different version s of the eclib spkg both called eclib-20080310.p8 which is rather confusing.

Looking at the diff file I made of the SPKG.txt

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/portability/eclib-20080310.p8/SPKG.txt.diff

the last revision made was in 

 === eclib-20080310.p7 (Michael Abshoff, October 12th, 2008) ===
* Work around paralle make issue (#4228)

then I added 

### eclib-20080310.p8 (David Kirkby, 2nd January 2010)
* Allow SAGE64 to work on all platforms, not just OS X. 

Are you sure the previous one was patch level 8 and not 7? If it was, then SPKG.txt was not updated when it moved to 8. Sorry about that, if I did overlook this. I agree it is confusing, if this is so. 

For it to also be merged, and the release manager not notice, seems a bit strange.

What I found was this.  On my own computer I have a p8 with the following changelog entry:

```
=== eclib-20080310.p8 (John Cremona, January 6th, 2009) ===
 * Change to debugging output in procs/p2points.cc (not relevant for Sage)
 * Change to pdivs() in procs/marith.cc (not relevant for Sage)
```
Now, whatever that was about, it was not relevant for Sage (either referred to functions not used by anything wrapped in Sage, or under compiler options which Sage does not use), and presumably for that reason I did not make a ticket for it to replace the (then) standard p7 in Sage.

I guess the thing for me to do now is to make a p9 which has both the changes I made in my p8 and the ones you made, and get it into Sage.  I have to keep the version of the source files which are used by Sage in sync with the versions I have, otherwise I'll go mad.
