Reset doesn't touch _ names, so the fix is easy -- just use `import sagenb.notebook.interact as _interact_` then everywhere in code refer to `_interact_` instead of `sagenb.notebook.interact`.  This is better on many levels.

OK, this seems to fix the problem.  I had some troubles with the patch at first but I think they are my fault.  Patch should be installed in 

spkg/build/sagenb-0.3.3/src/ 

and then

sage -python setup.py install

After doing this and doing sage -b, I got some strange errors about certain libraries, for example:

___gmpz_tdiv_r_2exp referenced from libmpfr expected to be defined in /Volumes/E/sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/lib/libgmp.3.dylib

My sage install originally was in /Volumes/E/sage-4.1.2.rc0, and then I upgraded and renamed it.  I think this can be ignored as a quirk of my setup, I've been doing quite a bit of cloning and some patch reviews on it, so I am going ahead and giving this a positive review.
