Instead of using

```
INPUT:

- ``x`` - integer (default: 1) blah
```
Sphinx has specific markup for this:

```
:param x: blah
:type x: integer, default 1
```
The resulting output isn't quite the same, but it looks nice.

There are two patches here; one adds a little to the developer's guide to document this.  The other patch implements this (applied to the file sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py) so you can build the documentation and see what it looks like.  The patches are independent; either or both could be merged, although it would not really accomplish the purpose of the ticket to just merge the simplicial complex patch...
