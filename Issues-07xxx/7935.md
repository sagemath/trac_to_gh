First of all, I spotted the following bug:

```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-38)
E = EllipticCurve([a,1/2])
E.global_integral_model()
```

which yields

```
AssertionError: bug in global_integral_model: [0, 0, 0, 4/361*a, 4/6859]
```

and that is easy to fix. But I also wish to add a `tamagawa_product` and improve the documentation.

I will post a patch later today.

Thanks for all the excellent documentation!

About the bug:  I am puzzled by this, as I still don't see how either my original code failed or how the change (of uniformiser) works best.  Here was my thinking:  if val(a_i)<0 for some i, then find the minimal e such that e*i+valuation(a_i) is >=0 for i in [1,2,3,4,6] and then replace a_i by `a_i/pi^(e*i)`.  The point about using the "negative" flag on the uniformiser was so ensure that dividing by a power of pi maintained integrality at all other primes.  Your new code will not do that.

Would this be better:

```
        D = self.discriminant()
        for P in D.prime_factors():
            if not all([a.valuation(P)>=0 for a in ai]):
                   pi=K.uniformizer(P,'negative')
                   e  = min([(ai[i].valuation(P)/[1,2,3,4,6][i]) for i in range(5)]).floor()
                   ai = [ai[i]/pi**(e*[1,2,3,4,6][i]) for i in range(5)]
```
? 

I have not looked at your last point yet.  I am not so keen on tamagawa_product() not giving the product of the Tamagawa numbers.  Are you sure that over Q when an equation is non-minimal at p that the number returned by tamagawa_number() is not the index for the minimal model?  I thought that was what Tate's algorithm would give.  I'll need to look at it more closely.


I am leaving this as "needs review" as I have not actually tested it yet!

Maybe you make a little sign error ? In the bug-example, the valuation of a6 at P = (a) is -2. So e is -1. So you are really multiplying the ais by pi<sup>+i</sup>. So pi should be integral away from P.

As to your comment on `tamagawa_product()`, we have

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a2')
sage: E.tamagawa_product()
1

sage: E2 = E.change_weierstrass_model([1/11,0,0,1])
sage: E2
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 3993*y = x^3 - 121*x^2 - 114492620*x - 466951591502 over Rational Field
sage: E2.tamagawa_product()
1
```

So it is defined to be the product of the Tamagawa numbers (i.e. the index of E<sup>0</sup> (K_v)) on the minimal model.

My definition (and that is the only sensible over number fields) of `tamagawa_product()` changes as one changes the chosen invariant differential in such a way that the product of it with the periods is invariant under this choice. In particular it is not the product of the Tamagawa numbers despite the name.

OK, I agree that there was a sign error...   The value of e in the code is always negative (since we skip if a is integral, hence at least one of the fractions (which are rounded down by the "/" operator) is negative.  Hence we divide by a negative power of pi, i.e. multiply by a positive power, so haveing pi integral is exactly what you want.  You win! 

Sorry, it's 5.30 on a Friday after the first week of term.

On the T. products, can we come up with a different name for one of the functions since they don't agree?  Either that, of have an optional parameter in the case over Q to give the same value as if Q were treated as a number field?
