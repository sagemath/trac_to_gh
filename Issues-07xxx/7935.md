First of all, I spotted the following bug:

```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-38)
E = EllipticCurve([a,1/2])
E.global_integral_model()
```

which yields

```
AssertionError: bug in global_integral_model: [0, 0, 0, 4/361*a, 4/6859]
```

and that is easy to fix. But I also wish to add a `tamagawa_product` and improve the documentation.

I will post a patch later today.

Before I get complains, I'd better add that tamagawa_product will not be the product of tamagawa numbers, but rather it envolves also the changes to the local minimal model. It will be the term that appears in BSD. Something I always wanted to add.

Thanks for all the excellent documentation!

About the bug:  I am puzzled by this, as I still don't see how either my original code failed or how the change (of uniformiser) works best.  Here was my thinking:  if val(a_i)<0 for some i, then find the minimal e such that e*i+valuation(a_i) is >=0 for i in [1,2,3,4,6] and then replace a_i by `a_i/pi^(e*i)`.  The point about using the "negative" flag on the uniformiser was so ensure that dividing by a power of pi maintained integrality at all other primes.  Your new code will not do that.

Would this be better:

```
        D = self.discriminant()
        for P in D.prime_factors():
            if not all([a.valuation(P)>=0 for a in ai]):
                   pi=K.uniformizer(P,'negative')
                   e  = min([(ai[i].valuation(P)/[1,2,3,4,6][i]) for i in range(5)]).floor()
                   ai = [ai[i]/pi**(e*[1,2,3,4,6][i]) for i in range(5)]
```
? 

I have not looked at your last point yet.  I am not so keen on tamagawa_product() not giving the product of the Tamagawa numbers.  Are you sure that over Q when an equation is non-minimal at p that the number returned by tamagawa_number() is not the index for the minimal model?  I thought that was what Tate's algorithm would give.  I'll need to look at it more closely.


I am leaving this as "needs review" as I have not actually tested it yet!

Maybe you make a little sign error ? In the bug-example, the valuation of a6 at P = (a) is -2. So e is -1. So you are really multiplying the ais by pi<sup>+i</sup>. So pi should be integral away from P.

As to your comment on `tamagawa_product()`, we have

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a2')
sage: E.tamagawa_product()
1

sage: E2 = E.change_weierstrass_model([1/11,0,0,1])
sage: E2
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 3993*y = x^3 - 121*x^2 - 114492620*x - 466951591502 over Rational Field
sage: E2.tamagawa_product()
1
```

So it is defined to be the product of the Tamagawa numbers (i.e. the index of E<sup>0</sup> (K_v)) on the minimal model.

My definition (and that is the only sensible over number fields) of `tamagawa_product()` changes as one changes the chosen invariant differential in such a way that the product of it with the periods is invariant under this choice. In particular it is not the product of the Tamagawa numbers despite the name.

OK, I agree that there was a sign error...   The value of e in the code is always negative (since we skip if a is integral, hence at least one of the fractions (which are rounded down by the "/" operator) is negative.  Hence we divide by a negative power of pi, i.e. multiply by a positive power, so haveing pi integral is exactly what you want.  You win! 

Sorry, it's 5.30 on a Friday after the first week of term.

On the T. products, can we come up with a different name for one of the functions since they don't agree?  Either that, of have an optional parameter in the case over Q to give the same value as if Q were treated as a number field?

but sometimes I get

```
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + a*x*y + (a+1)*y = x^3 + (a+1)*x^2 + (368258520200522046806318444*a-2270097978636731786720859345)*x + (8456608930173478039472018047583706316424*a-52130038506793883217874390501829588391299) over Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 38
```
on the same machine.  (Note that both are valid, since both are models with a unit Discriminant so are certainly global minimal models.)

The only way round this I can see in the short term is to remove the line in the doctest which displays E2 itself.  What do people think?

the first one would be ok, the second is missleading as it is not minimal.

tamagawa_product_bsd or tamagawa_product_as_in_bsd so that the tab still
completes it as before.
