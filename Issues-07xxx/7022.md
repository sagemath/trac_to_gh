This is a huge problem and total blocker:

```

flat:.matplotlib wstein$ cd

Ideas for solution: 

  (1) track down exactly where the problem happens in the matplotlib/freetype(?) code and fix it.

  (2) Just ship the font cache with Sage until this gets resolved upstream


A working version of the fontcache is here:

This supersedes what is at #6994.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Doctesting reveals that just using FONTCONFIG is not enough, e.g., any saving to pdf still breaks. 

Here is the problem narrowed down more:

```
sage: import ft2font; ft2font.FT2Font('/Library/Fonts/NISC18030.ttf')
/Users/wstein/sage/build/64bit/sage-4.1.2.alpha1/local/bin/sage-sage: line 199: 65960 Abort trap              sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

ft2font.so is a C extension in matplotlib.
