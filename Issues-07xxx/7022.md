This is a huge problem and total blocker:

```
flat:.matplotlib wstein$ mv fontList.cache fontList.cache.XXX
flat:.matplotlib wstein$ cd

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: parallel
sage: import pylab
sage: 
```

Ideas for solution: 

  (1) track down exactly where the problem happens in the matplotlib/freetype(?) code and fix it.

  (2) Just ship the font cache with Sage until this gets resolved upstream


A working version of the fontcache is here:

The spkg is here:

Doctesting reveals that just using FONTCONFIG is not enough, e.g., any saving to pdf still breaks. 

Here is the problem narrowed down more:

```
sage: import ft2font; ft2font.FT2Font('/Library/Fonts/NISC18030.ttf')
/Users/wstein/sage/build/64bit/sage-4.1.2.alpha1/local/bin/sage-sage: line 199: 65960 Abort trap              sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

ft2font.so is a C extension in matplotlib.

The matplotlib problem may be in its spkg file: it says

```
if [ $UNAME = "Darwin" -a `uname -r` = "10.0.0" ]; then
    echo "Running a horrible hack to force ft2font.so to build in a way that doen't crash."
    echo "This is of course temporary.  See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7022"
    ../patches/osx10.6hack
fi
```
But with my computer, "uname -r" returns "10.2.0", not "10.0.0".  How do you modify a shell script like this to make it work for a range of version numbers?  (We don't just want "10.0.0" or "10.2.0", I'm guessing.)
