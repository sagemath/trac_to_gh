It was decided on sage-devel only to put the version and not the date in the message of deprecation aliases. I just uploaded a patch witch does that. Please review. Aside from that

You have a Positive review on trac_7157.patch. You can change the status as soon as you had an eye on my trivial review patch. 

Cheers,

By the way a review on #7515 is welcome ;-)
