This was suggested by Nathann Cohen. This is a followup of #7515 where a short mantra for deprecated function aliases is set-up.

I'll not have the time to do this right now so any volunteer is welcome.

This ticket isn't really a precise task. I think with #13109 any non-optimal use of deprecation should just die out eventually.

I propose we close this ticket as invalid.

I'm downgrading and turning this into an enhancement, since this is not really a bug at all.   Once older deprecations are removed one could also closed this ticket.

Obviously.  However, there haven't even been any volunteers for deleting some of the deprecations in question - some of which are nearly three years old!  Just because a ticket is fairly pointless doesn't mean it isn't valid, if you take my meaning :)  Downgrading to trivial.
