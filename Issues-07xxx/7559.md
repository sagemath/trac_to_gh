This was suggested by Nathann Cohen. This is a followup of #7515 where a short mantra for deprecated function aliases is set-up.

I'll not have the time to do this right now so any volunteer is welcome.

I'm downgrading and turning this into an enhancement, since this is not really a bug at all.   Once older deprecations are removed one could also closed this ticket.
