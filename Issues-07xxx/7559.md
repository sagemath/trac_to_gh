This was suggested by Nathann Cohen. This is a followup of #7515 where a short mantra for deprecated function aliases is set-up.

I'll not have the time to do this right now so any volunteer is welcome.

This ticket isn't really a precise task. I think with #13109 any non-optimal use of deprecation should just die out eventually.

I propose we close this ticket as invalid.

I don't know about this being imprecise.  It says to replace `deprecation` with `deprecation_function_alias` wherever possible.   It's true that they will be removed someday, so this isn't a very high priority ticket!  But given that many of them haven't been removed yet, if someone really wanted to, this would be an ok thing to do by someone wanting to learn how to develop for Sage.

I'm downgrading and turning this into an enhancement, since this is not really a bug at all.   Once older deprecations are removed one could also closed this ticket.

Obviously.  However, there haven't even been any volunteers for deleting some of the deprecations in question - some of which are nearly three years old!  Just because a ticket is fairly pointless doesn't mean it isn't valid, if you take my meaning :)  Downgrading to trivial.
