With maxima-as-an-ecl-library and ecl accessible as a library, we can start interfacing with maxima via a binary library interface. This should be more efficient and more robust, because expressions can be transmitted in a much richer format than text and parsing does not have to recognise error messages and questions (since communication does not go via STDIN/STDOUT anymore).

Applies cleanly to 4.7.alpha3.

Depends on: #10766, #10773, #10743. #10818 desirable but not essential.

I think the following email might be of interest to other people wanting to hack maxima:

> Maxima and (especially) getting back Sage stuff from Maxima, would

lib/ecl.pyx has nothing to do with maxima-specific stuff. That is all in
sagemax.py. It is actually a little bit important to keep that distinction.
Maxima is not the only lisp program we might want to interface with.

There is `max_read(S) = cadadr(EclObject("#$%s"%S))`, which *reads* the string
S as a maxima expression and returns its parsed result.

So `meval(max_read(S))` would do the trick. I do not know what routines maxima
has to convert expressions to a string. If I wanted to know, I would find it
out by looking at something like

`max_read("maxima-command-to-print-to-string(x)")`

and see what token the maxima reader puts in. I imagine you get something
like

```
<ECL: ((MAX-PRINT-STRING) x)>
```

back, So do:

```
maxprint:=EclObject("MAX-PRINT-STRING") #do this once globally
meval(EclObject([[maxprint], maxexpression])).python()
```

Indeed:

```
sage: max_read("string(x)")
<ECL: (($STRING) $X)>
sage: meval(max_read("string(x)"))
<ECL: "x">
sage: meval(max_read("string(x)")).python()
'"x"'
sage: meval(max_read("string(x)")).python()[1:-1]
'x'
```

So

```
sage: maxprint=EclObject("$STRING")
sage: def max_to_string(s):
....:      return meval(EclObject([[maxprint],s])).python()[1:-1]
```

would give you a string representation. Be aware that #$...$ suffers from
performance loss, so if you repeatedly use it, your timings will go south
quickly. See Dodier's comments on this a while ago. Apparently you could
patch Maxima to lose the performance-losing routine (at the expense of
losing the wonderful linear-search history the maxima parser offers now).

> Sage command -> calls Maxima command -> Maxima command evaluated, but
> in the ECL library version, not the pexpect version -> Maxima output
> (a string) converted back using the stuff in Sage

Yes, that would be an approach virtually orthogonal to the one taken in sagemax.py.

```
> sage: str(ecl_eval("#$load(to_poly_solver)$"))
> append: argument must be a non-atomic expression; found false
> -- an error.  To debug this try debugmode(true);
```
To illustrate the inner workings:

```
sage: from sagemax import *
sage: e=max_read('load("to_poly_solver")')
sage: e
<ECL: (($LOAD) "to_poly_solver")>
sage: meval(e)
append: argument must be a non-atomic expression; found false
 -- an error.  To debug this try debugmode(true);

sage: meval(max_read("append(a,b)"))
append: argument must be a non-atomic expression; found a
 -- an error.  To debug this try debugmode(true);
```

So my guess is that "load" is trying to append to an improperly initialized
maxima list. I guess that means that in the current setting, our maxima
environment hasn't properly been set up yet. That is no surprise. It is
actually surprising that so much of maxima works without any initialization
at all.

Updated maxlib.patch. Changes made:
* Code catches (throw 'macsyma-quit) and tries to recognise errors (often successful)
* suppress questions and throw errors instead
* suppress ";;; load ..." lines and load warnings
* set environment appropriately for calculus instance
There is a nasty problem that "forget(facts())" gets executed by sage, but throws errors. These get caught by the classic interface, but mess up the printing.

Doctesting calculus/calculus.py leads to 10 failures. All have to do with either forget() acting up or the fact that "maxima asks a question" gets reported differently by the two interfaces.

(the uploaded code has some diagnostic output in `maxima_eval` to try to debug the "forget" issues. The "ask" errors should just consist of updating the doctest.

Go at it!

Attachment: **[maxlib.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7377/maxlib.patch.gz)**

Another update:

* change to symbolic/assumptions.py to not try: ... error: pass (gentler removal of assumptions makes the interface behave a bit better)

* monkey patch maxima to throw error on divergent integral instead of *printing* "Principal Value" and giving an answer.
(maxima does behave as documented, so it is a matter of taste to change maxima's behaviour)

* slightly more pretty/informative error messages

Doctests failures on calculus.py are only 5 and are restricted to whitespace and differently formatted error messages (in other words, for real use, the two interfaces shouldn't be distinguishable anymore).

Attachment: **[fastcalculus.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7377/fastcalculus.patch.gz)**

The latest patch must be applied after `abstract-maxima` and `maxlib`. It adds routines `sr_to_max` and `max_to_sr` that try to translate between maxima's internal datastructure and SR while avoiding string transformations as much as possible. It falls back to the old interface to establish many of its symbol and operator translations, but takes note of them and uses a dictionary directly the next time around. It also avoids the overhead of binding expressions to maxima variables.

to go back and forth, `maxima_lib.MaximaElement()` as a new function {ecl()} which passes back the underlying EclObject. Conversely, `maxima_lib.maxima` accepts EclObjects and returns a corresponding expect interface object.

This patch also rewrite calculus integral, limit and sum to directly pass back and forth to maxima. There is a lot of overhead in SR itself, so speed gains are not that big. New times are:

```
sage: timeit("integral(cos(x),x)")
625 loops, best of 3: 1.1 ms per loop
sage: timeit("integral(cos(x^2),x)")
5 loops, best of 3: 31.2 ms per loop
```
where old were

```
sage: timeit("integral(cos(x),x)")
25 loops, best of 3: 8.08 ms per loop
sage: timeit("integral(cos(x^2),x)")
5 loops, best of 3: 37 ms per loop
```

It is easy to swap the old and new interfaces: simply comment/uncomment the appropriate lines in `calculus.py` to define the appropriate calculus.maxima

There are 7 doctest failures in `calculus.py`. All of them are whitespace, errors and changed precision in floats:
the binary interface passes `double`s directly, so there are no digits rounded. This affects some doctests. In other words, as far is `calculus.py` is concerned the two interfaces are functionally equivalent.

Unfortunately, it does. Since Robert split off the Maxima pexpect interface, there were a few minor changes to `sage/interfaces/maxima.py`. His patch needs to be rebased.

AFAIR, the only reason that held this ticket back was a mix-up in the updates to the ecl/maxima packages. The version that properly built maxima as a library got lost since there were several new packages at the same time. I don't know if that problem is fixed in the latest release.

I tried to update the patches so that they apply on Sage 4.6.1 with Maxima 5.22.1, some things moved since the last patches were produced, but there was nothing too terrible. I'll up them right now.

However, there is now a problem when loading Maxima as a library. Maybe some changes in the spkg (in init-cl.lisp where set-pathnames is defined ?) are responsible for this. Without that line, there is a problem later.

I don't know anything about Lisp, ECL and Maxima, so I was not able to fix that in the little time I tried.

As far as the patches as concerned, I feel that more work is needed. Deleting duplicate examples and methods, moving the library interface to libs directory, not sure where maxima abstract should go (if it is kept, should something be done like MaximaLib/Maxima as for Pari/GP ? no idea if those two "interfaces" share something...), getting rid of the inheritance on Expect in Maxima_lib and Maxima_abstract.

I'm ready to have a look at all of this, if someone helps me launching Maxima as library with latest versions of everything.

My first guess is that maxima.fas is not available to your newly built ecl-11.1.1.

Note that in 4.6.1, building maxima produces this library:

$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/ecl-10.4.1/maxima.fas

so once you upgrade ecl, you need to rebuild maxima as well. Did you do that?

I downgraded to ecl-10.4.1 and rebuilt maxima and sage but I don't seem to have
maxima.fas, I have a number of other fas but not maxima.fas.
It was done on sage-on-gentoo, so it is possible that this particular file wasn't

I will check what the maxima spkg do.

I just upgraded to 4.6.2.aplha2 (hoping I won't have to rebuild from scratch for next upgrade...) and everything went fine, it gives me better timings than with the Pexpect interface. Before patches:

```
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: jp
sage: timeit("integral(cos(x^2),x)")
5 loops, best of 3: 96.6 ms per loop
sage: 
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m1.02s, Wall time 0m8.17s).
Exiting spawned Maxima process.

```
After:

```
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: jp
sage: timeit("integral(cos(x^2),x)")
5 loops, best of 3: 62.8 ms per loop
sage: 
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m1.56s, Wall time 3m5.27s).

```
However those are much more than what was posted above.

Glad to hear it also ran on Sage on Gentoo.

I think some refactoring still has to be done for the new classes. The abstract class is a good idea to transparently switch interface but I think it would be cleaner if it did not inherit from Expect class (and so "Maxima as a lib" does not too). I'll try to work on this this weekend.

It should be also be decided, which interface is used for what, especially since we can only have one "Maxima as a lib" running. Should that Maxima as lib be used for calculus and be given a direct access (maybe as "maximalib" variable as "maxima" gives access to a copy of Maxima in Sage, even if currently the "maxima" variable points to a different instance of Maxima than the one used by calculus).

Replying to [@jpflori](#comment%3A24):

Hi Jean-Pierre,

It's great you're taking on this project! It has the potential of being a lot of fun. I won't be working on it, so I'm very happy to see someone else interested in taking it on. I'll give you some background on the points you raise, so that you can take more informed design decisions.

> I think some refactoring still has to be done for the new classes. The abstract class is a good idea to transparently switch interface but I think it would be cleaner if it did not inherit from Expect class (and so "Maxima as a lib" does not too). I'll try to work on this this weekend.

The *only* reason to organize the maxima interfaces as they are now is because Robert remarked that whatever was needed to communicate with maxlib at a string-level was going to have a lot of overlap with the present maxima interface. Hence, he abstracted out the common stuff and I modified the concrete maxlib interface to talk to ecllib instead of a separate process. This was experimental and at the time I had no idea how much was necessary, so I changed as little as possible: The original interface inherited from expect, so the new one did too, just overriding whatever methods needed overriding. So yes, there will be a lot of lint and extraneous stuff in there. What you're looking at is a first hack.

> It should be also be decided, which interface is used for what, especially since we can only have one "Maxima as a lib" running. Should that Maxima as lib be used for calculus and be given a direct access (maybe as "maximalib" variable as "maxima" gives access to a copy of Maxima in Sage, even if currently the "maxima" variable points to a different instance of Maxima than the one used by calculus).

The largest benefit is to be gained when the communication can avoid string parsing altogether. (ecllib at the moment converts Integers to ecl bignums via strings, which is silly: They are both implemented as gmp/mpir integers! The only reason is that I never succeeded in importing the gmp/mpir headers in a usable way in ecl.pyx, to copy over the integer. ECL largely avoids gmp's registered memory manager, so some care must be taken to transfer the integer to properly allocated memory.) The routines sr_to_max and max_to_sr (in the fastcalculus patch) implement this strategy. If you want to have this benefit, the maxlib instance *has* to be the "calculus" instance. Note that the default "maxima" instance is already distinct from the "calculus" instance:

```
sage: integrate(cos(x),x);
sage: maxima(x);
sage: 
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.12s, Wall time 0m16.73s).
Exiting spawned Maxima process.
Exiting spawned Maxima process.
```
(note the two maxima spawns)

Once the design has stabilized, it would be possible to make max_to_sr and sr_to_max more intelligent. For instance, SR variables would not need to be translated to maxima identifiers with the same name. This currently leads to problems, because this conversion collapses namespaces:

```
sage: cosvar=SR.var("cos")
sage: cos(cosvar)
cos(cos)
sage: integrate(cos(cosvar),cosvar)
integrate(cos(cos), cos)
sage: cosvar=SR.var("sage_cos")
sage: integrate(cos(cosvar),cosvar)
sin(sage_cos)
```
as you see, the print name of the SR.var matters!

Let me know if you have further questions. I might be able to help with information.

Ok so it runs but in its present state it breaks quite a lot of doctests for me.
Unless you can point out something else I would need to do.

Hmm, that is very interesting.  I am not quite sure what this `del` thing is, but I remember seeing something about it on the Maxima list...

This must be us using Sage Integers somehow at the library level where before they were coming back from Maxima?

Notice we expect a TypeError.

Now we just get a different error.  I assume that the new code interface has something about ECL asking.  We would want to make sure that this still is turned into the helpful type of message we have here, but that should be easy (if tedious) to make work.

Thank you for beginning this testing!

I have a cedilla thanks to the international setting on my desktop.

More seriously, it should be pointed out that this is done with ecl-11.1.1
and it may have an influence. I have a faster machine at work and I'll test
ecl-10.4.1 on Monday.

Some are probably due to ecl-11.1.1 so it should shrink, but it will take a bit
of time since ecl, maxima and sage have to be rebuild.

Hmm, this must have to do with 5.23.2, because "Here arccoth doesn't have 1 in its domain, so we just hold the expression:" in the past.  So Maxima must have improved something here.

```
    sage: integrate(ceil(x^2 + floor(x)), x, 0, 5)    # todo: Mathematica can do this
Expected:
    integrate(ceil(x^2) + floor(x), x, 0, 5)
Got:
    155/3
```
If this is right, that's good.  No idea what's going on with the next one.

In general, I'm seeing a lot of stuff that's related to having the newer Maxima.  I think that we should either upgrade Maxima first, and take care of things related to better error handling/functionality in Maxima, and then address this ticket separately, OR do this first with our current Maxima and then upgrade Maxima.

I will do another run of tests with maxima-5.22.1 later. It is not too hard
to go from one version of maxima to another. At least you don't have to rebuild
anything else. 

But it definitely looks like upgrading maxima would be a good thing,
we'll have to make a ticket about it.

The `MAXIMA>>` prompt indicates that you're dropped into to ECL debugger [the default behaviour of LISPs is to drop you into a debugger when an uncaught condition arises].

This is Maxima printing something on the STDOUT. We should be catching this before it gets printed! In other words, find which routine in maxima prints this and monkey-patch it to raise an error *before* printing this. Apparently, maxima does raise an error after printing this, which normally gets caught on maxima's top level. But since we decapitated maxima, we're getting that now, and that is where the next thing goes wrong:

```

```
so a FORMAT statement is failing here. Apparently "Condition" objects (roughly "exception" objects in python) can have a format string and items hanging off them. FORMAT is LISPs "printf", but with a much more baroque set of options. FORMAT format specifiers have been rumoured to be Turing complete. Let's look at the parameters:

```
MAXIMA>> (SIMPLE-CONDITION-FORMAT-CONTROL CONDITION)

"The number ~:M isn't in the domain of ~A"
MAXIMA>> (SIMPLE-CONDITION-FORMAT-ARGUMENTS CONDITION)

```
So the "~:M" is probably a Maxima extension to format which is not accessible at the point where we are trying it. The fact that there are no arguments also indicates that Maxima might be forming a condition object that is not fit for general consumption.

Let's see where this error really arose by stepping further up in the backtrace:

Finally we're at the ecllib level. SAGE-SAFE-APPLY is the way ecllib tries to execute LISP code
As you can see, the arguments here indicate that this is the original call we started with, translated to maxima (well, the underlying LISP representation of maxima).
We know this raised an error, which gets processed by the HANDLER-CASE/SERIOUS-CONDITION. The PRINC-TO-STRING tries to make a string rendition of the CONDITION object, which fails for the reasons we have seen above.

So, the most direct way to solve the problem is to monkey-patch Maxima to raise an acceptable error *instead* of printing a message and sending a CONDITION object that crashes PRINC (which should be a near-universal printing routine). This should be relatively straightforward, because that Maxima routine already produces an acceptable string.

I have looked a little into the error reporting and it looks like maxima was not creating the error that crashed ecllib's error string creation routine -- instead it was maxima-eval, the maxima "top level" replacement we run to catch and interpret maxima's error reporting. Maxima's error reporting hasn't changed since 1985. It just happened that this was the first time we stumbled into an error message that was not properly handled. The new patch "errorcatching.patch" (to be applied after all the "rebased" patches) fixes this.

We now get:

```
sage: arccoth(1).simplify()
 -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);
(result= MAXIMA-ERROR)
($error= ((MLIST) The number ~:M isn't in the domain of ~A 1 ACOTH))
TypeError: ECL says: The number 1 isn't in the domain of acoth
sage: elliptic_e(arccoth(1), x^2*e)
(result=
 (MAXIMA_EVAL
  . /usr/local/sage/4.6/local/share/maxima/5.22.1/share/orthopoly/orthopoly.lisp))
($error= ((MLIST) The number ~:M isn't in the domain of ~A 1 ACOTH))
(result= (MAXIMA_EVAL))
($error= ((MLIST) The number ~:M isn't in the domain of ~A 1 ACOTH))
 -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);
(result= MAXIMA-ERROR)
($error= ((MLIST) The number ~:M isn't in the domain of ~A 1 ACOTH))
elliptic_e(arccoth(1), x^2*e)
```

So we see a bunch of things:
* printing the error has now been turned off, but a quick glance at the code shows that the message `-- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);` cannot be turned off. I regard that a bug in Maxima and we can consider reporting that. We could also just monkeypatch MERROR.
* the error now gets properly reported
* there is a lot of junk diagnostic output generated by my fixed routine. Feel free to comment that back out.
* the actual simplification of elliptic_e (whatever is tried there) apparently is wrapped in a try/except and the error reported by ecl is nicely hidden and the result is left unchanged.

This should be closer to how sage handled this first.

<div id="comment:39" align="right">comment:39</div>

two return statements is indeed strange. Is the second return ever reached?
Could it be a left over forgotten there? Looking at the code I am not sure
what ex.parent()(l) is supposed to be.
I haven't had time to test the errorcatching patch but will try ASAP.
One of my testing friend noted that maxima as a lib and ecl compiled
with thread support are not compatible (ever seen a SIGPWR?). I am mentioning
that, in case it becomes the default in ecl in the future.

No, it isn't. However, Burcin apparently thought that `l.sage()` would give better results. I'm actually thankful that he left in the original return statement because that served as a nice flag that something had changed there.

It is "Coerce l into the parent of ex", the original input parameter, i.e., coerce l into the Symbolic Ring. In the new code, "sr_limit" produces something that is hopefully *coercible* into the SymbolicRing -- it probably isn't a maxima object at all anymore. I think in all cases it's better to coerce into SR instead of calling l.sage(): On maxima objects it should be about the same and if limit produces something that cannot be represented in the SymbolicRing we should get an error. I'll ping him about it.

Good to know! A little googling found http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/debugging.html
It's the garbage collector that uses SIGXCPU and SIGPWR to synchronise cross-thread garbage collection. So if we want ecllib+threads we need to adjust the sage signal handler to properly handle those. BoehmGC is made for integration into C programs, so this may be doable.

It was clearly a mistake on my part to leave the second return statement. I'm glad it ended up being useful though.

I don't have much time these days to investigate this. So it would be great if someone can update me on the progress. Especially, when rebasing Robert's patch to split off the maxima interface, did you merge in the changes that were made to sage/interfaces/maxima.py in the meantime?

The operation we are using is conversion, not coercion. IMHO, the code for converting maxima objects (of any kind, pexpect or library) to Sage symbolics objects should be within the maxima objects. Most of this functionality is in sage/calculus/calculus.py at the moment, I would like to see that moved to sage/interfaces/maxima.py or it's variants.

Adding a .sage() method to maxima interface objects was a step in this direction. This method knows which lookup tables to use to convert functions, etc. from maxima back to Sage. The code for this function is simply

```
   def _sage_(self):
       import sage.calculus.calculus as calculus
       return calculus.symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string(self.name(),
               maxima=self.parent())
```
around line 1775 of sage/interfaces/maxima.py. I would expect this to work for the library interface to maxima as well, since AFAIK, this is also string based ATM.

I am not quite sure what a conversion to the symbolic ring does for maxima interface objects. I don't expect it to have special behavior if the input is a maxima interface object. It would make sense, if it called the .sage() or ._sage_() methods of the argument though.

Sorry I can't be more helpful.

I'll leave that to JP

Ultimately, this model might fit better with maximalib, but currently it means some refactoring of what we already had (or just go back to the SR coercion)

> around line 1775 of sage/interfaces/maxima.py. I would expect this to work for the library interface to maxima as well, since AFAIK, this is also string based ATM.

With the fastcalculus patch it is not, though. In principle one could try to polish the abstract_maxima and maxima_lib patches so that they give a drop-in string-based library interface to maxima, but I never really went that far. That would be (probably boring but) very well-defined project and might speed up adoption. 

What happens with the current set of patches:
* a maxima_lib interface is made available that in principle should be a drop-in replacement for maxima (except that only one instance can exist)
* this interface adds some extra methods to get "under the hood" of objects:

  (1) There is an .ecl() method that returns the underlying EclObject (i.e., direct access to the LISP object implementing the maxima object)

  (2) the maxima() method also accepts EclObjects and returns the appropriate wrapper, so maxima(M.ecl()) and maxima(eclobject).ecl() are supposed to be the identity (In a strong sense: The python wrapped might change Id but the ecl object not) where defined.

  (3) sr_to_max(), a method to translate an SR object into an EclObject ready for wrapping in maxima.

  (4) max_to_sr(), a method to translate an EclObject representing a maxima expression to something in or coercible to SR. Note that maxima expressions can be lists, which should be translated into a python list of SR elements, so the mapping cannot be perfectly into SR.

  (5) methods sr_limit, sr_sum, sr_integrate which expect arguments living in SR and return something convertible to SR

The idea is that (3) and (4) offer a way to go back and forth between SR and maxima without using strings. maxima(E) and maxima(sr_to_max(E)) should have the same result. Similarly, SR(M) and SR(max_to_sr(M.ecl())) should have the similar result. Under the hood, sr_to_max and max_to_sr keep mappings between SR symbols and their EclObject counterparts. They build up these mappings via the string-based interface, but avoid strings once they know the mappings.

The methods in (5) were an attempt to make "compute limit/sum/integral via maxima" dependent on which maxima interface was in use. The old maxima-interface got stubs that just returned the result of calling the appropriate maxima expression, which returns a maxima expression, which is coercible into SR again.

The maxima-lib implementation uses sr_to_max and max_to_sr as much as possible and returns the result of a max_to_sr, so that should be coercible into SR as well.

Doing it this way (at the time) was the smallest change and left as much as possible in the calculus.limit routine. The general setup fits will in Burcin's philosophy, but is presently broken because the result of a max_to_sr likely doesn't have a .sage() method. An alternative would be to push the actual conversion of the answer to SR into the sr_limit routine as well. But then one would have to tell sr_limit into which SR the answer has to be pushed. (I guess expr.parent())

I think the `_proper_` way to do all these computations is to construct a dummy_limit or a dummy_integral in SR first ("inert" limit and "inert" integral being the less opinionated synonyms), convert that to maxima (via sr_to_max or string-based), call the appropriate simplification on it there (note that sr_to_max will absolutely not do any simplification. It's just mapping over expression trees) and then pull the answer back via max_to_sr or string based.

To come up with a truly robust design for this (the present was just a first hack and proof-of-concept), people who know a lot about SR and the general calculus architecture need to be involved. I've tried to show with various examples on this ticket that you don't need to understand much of lisp to make sense of what happens in maxima. The sage side of this is really much more complicated than the maxima side. The ECL objects representing maxima expressions look messy and have a lot of parentheses, but have a very straightforward structure.

Finally for (4): I know maxima functions like li[n] and psi[n] are not translated yet, because recognising them means looking a bit deeper in the maxima constructs. This is straightforward to do. There may be more of these constructs. Whoever wrote the string-based converter probably knows them already, because there they need special treatment too.

 With maxima-as-an-ecl-library and ecl accessible as a library, we can start interfacing with maxima via a binary library interface.
 This should be more efficient and more robust, because expressions
 can be transmitted in a much richer format than text and parsing does
 not have to recognise error messages and questions (since communication does not go via STDIN/STDOUT anymore)

doctesting on 4.6.1 yields failures in only 12 files, and most of these are just changed formatting of output, numerical noise because floats are now binarily copied rather than transcribed via decimal string representations, and because some errors get reported differently. (For ECL everything is a RuntimeError, for instance).

List here:

* `devel/sage/sage/symbolic/assumptions.py`: "Assumption
is inconsistent" errors get reported differently

* `devel/sage/sage/symbolic/function_factory.py`: Serious issues with
translating FDerivative constructs (it doesn't work at the moment)

* `devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx`: A strange
issue with `(x*log(9)).simplify_log('all')`. Oddly,
`(x*log(3/7)).simplify_log('all')` does behave correctly.

* `devel/sage/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py`:
"Maxima asks a question" errors get reported differently, float issues

* `devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py`: "Maxima asks
a question" errors get reported differently. These doctests are wrong, because
they test the maxima_lib interface via calculus, not a real maxima interface.

* `devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py`:
These doctests were never adapted

* `devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py`: Whitespace
and nintegral reports failure differently.

* `devel/sage/sage/calculus/wester.py`: Looks like
correct answer, but differently collected.

* `devel/sage/sage/calculus/tests.py`: Odd errors. They seem to depend on
context. Perhaps assumptions that aren't properly forgotten or max_to_sr cache
that gets spoilt?

* `devel/sage/sage/calculus/desolvers.py`: lots of
problems. The desolve interface probably needs treatment like the to_poly_solve
routine.

* `devel/sage/sage/calculus/functional.py`: "Maxima
asks a question" gets reported differently

* `devel/sage/sage/symbolic/assumptions.py`:
Inconsistent assumptions get reported differently.

Most of these are a matter of changing the doctests to the generated answer, but
a few serious issues remain.

From my own experiments some of this patch set will need rebasing if it goes in.

the lisp function `retrieve` in maxima is responsible for asking questions, so we just monkey-patch it to throw an error with an informative message instead. The patch trac_7377-better-ask-error.patch improves the readability of this message by executing exactly the original code in retrieve, but wrapped in a `(with-output-to-string (*standard-output*) ...)`. The method is generally applicable and may be useful in adapting other printing bits.

Oddly enough, this patch does not invalidate any additional doctests, but:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-devel/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py"   
**********************************************************************

```
so perhaps maxima inserts a TAB in the error message. Are TABs not allowed in doctest output?
(it looks like one gets produced and matched by a "..." in the doctest template). A `sage -t --verbose` shows that no individual test fails.

>  desolver 

This might be not so bad.

The main thing there is that the call forms for "desolve" are rather complicated, because there are all kinds of auxiliary arguments. to_poly_solve had a similar problem. I solved that by declaring an explicit to_poly_solve method on maxima_lib.MaximaElement.

Probably just parsing the optional arguments and putting them together in the right kind of structure (see to_poly_solve for an example) solves most problems.

I don't know how bad the structures are that come back from desolve, but for most cases I have had surprisingly little problems in that direction.

> abstract derivative

The whole `D[0](f)` syntax needs separate treatment. I realized later that currently, only
`D[i,j,k](f)(x1,x2,...,xn)` is allowed if `x1,...,xn` are distinct symbolic variables. This surprised me a bit. Sage support for functional derivatives is only rudimentary.

I think that if we have an expression: `D[i0,...,ir](f)(e0,...,en)`, we should just do
`diff( f(t0,...,tn), [[t0,...,tn][i] for i in [i0,...,ir]]).subs({t0:e0,...,tn:en})`
i.e., introduce temporary variables t0,...,tn to take the appropriate derivate relative to named variables and then specialize to the evaluation point requested. Is there a reason this approach has not been taken? Just lack of need/implementation time?

In Maxima one can take exactly the same approach:

```
at(diff( f(t0,t1,t2,t3) , t0,1,t1,1,t0,1 ), [t0=e0,t1=e1,t2=e2])
```
the documentation of at is scary: substitutions are done in series, not in parallel. That's basically a bug given the intended use of the routine, even though it is documented behaviour. However, if we make sure that our temporary variables are truly unique, there should be no problem. Perhaps call `gensym`.

OK so I tested the new patch set on sage-on-gentoo and it is strange. I see all the doctests failures that Nils is seeing. Plus a few more strangely enough in scheme/elliptic_curves/ that you wouldn't think are related. But I also get a lot of SIGFPE all over the place from seemingly unrelated components (mpmath, pynac...).
They go away when I rebuild without the patches.

I fail to see the cause to effect relation between maxima-lib and these, but there they are.

I almost forgot I have an unpickling failure as well

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment%3A55):
>  But I also get a lot of SIGFPE all over the place from seemingly unrelated components 

ECL does normally install SIG handlers, but we try to put them back (at the time Juanjo said this should be basically safe). The responsible code is in `sage.libs.ecl.init_ecl()`,
`sage/libs/ecl.pyx:131`.

```
    #get all the signal handlers (does any system have signal numbers above 32?)
    for i in range(1,33):
        sigaction(i,NULL,&(act[i])) 
 
    #initialize ECL
    cl_boot(0, argv)
    
    #and put the signal handlers back
    for i in range(1,33):
        sigaction(i,&(act[i]),NULL)
```
To see if this is the culprit, take a pristine sage and ensure that sage.libs.ecl_init() gets called upon initialization (i.e., insert a call into some module to ensure this gets called. Normally it doesn't)
Now run the SIGFPE producing doctests. Do they offend again? Perhaps you can improve ecllib's initialization?

Other things to watch out for:
- Your Boehm-Weiser GC might be built with different options
- Make sure that ecl.so links against the same MPIR/GMP library. Having two GMPs hang around will definitely wreak havoc.

(I think I saw the pickling error too. Some gherkin expert can probably easily pinpoint what's wrong and how to fix it)

I produced new versions of the patches based on Sage 4.6.2.alpha4, ECL 11.1.1 of !#10766 and Maxima 5.23.1 of #10773.

I think I forgot to include some changes in Sage in the previous rebased patches, things should be better with those versions.

The patches will follow shortly.

I'm currently running "make ptest" to check I get the same failures as what was posted above.

I'm also currently trying to get rid of the Pexpect class inheritage of MaximaAbstract and MaximaLib classes.

The best idea I got so far is to split all the non-pexpect and non-communication things of Sage pexpect class into a parent class and make MaximaAbstract inherit from that class so that we still have access to all the nice features defined in Pexpect class.

MaximaLib would just inherit MaximaAbstract and Maxima woulb inherit both MaximaAbstract and Pexpect.

I'll post this set of patches asap.

2. symbolic/function_factory.py : "del" thing as posted earlier
3. symbolic/expression.pyx : got "x*log(9)" instead of "log(9!^x)" so Maxima got better in simplify_all, but also a lot of blabbering : "solve: using arc-trig functions to get a solution.
Some solutions will be lost." and "rat: replaced -0.032 by -4/125 = -0.032"

1. symbolic/integration/integral.py : error reporting, numerical noise and same kind of verbosity as mentionned above ("rat: replaced ...")
2. interfaces/maxima_lib.py : TAB character (anyway changes are still missing)
3. interfaces/maxima.py : Error reporting
4. calculus/tests.py :

   * integrate(ceil(x!^2 + floor(x)), x, 0, 5) gives 155/3 instead of integrate(ceil(x!^2) + floor(x), x, 0, 5), Maple gives me 145
   * integrate(sin(x), x, a, b) gives cos(a) - cos(b) instead of ceil(cos(a)) ...
   * next 2 errors are !__call!__() takes at most 3 arguments (4 given)Â 
5. calculus/wester.py : some verbosity ("solve:..."), the results are printed differently but are equal (I'll test with #9880)
6. calculus/calculus.py : 

   * a = sage.calculus.calculus.maxima("x!#0"); a gives x # 0 and a lot of strange verbosity ("***JOB ABORT DUE TO UNRECOVERED ERROR.") instead of x#0
   * nintegral reports error differently
7. calculus/desolvers.py : seems broken, lots of ascii art displayed things
8. calculus/functional.py : error reporting
9. structure/sage_object.pyx : unpickle failure: load('/home/jp/.sage/temp/napoleon/8057/dir_2/pickle_jar/_class!__sage_interfaces_maxima_MaximaFunction!__.sobj')

So I get the same errors as reported above. I don't know why Maxima gets so verbose ("rat:...", "solve:...", ascii art things in desolve, "-- an error.  To debug this try debugmode(true);"...), was it intended in the patches ?

Cheers,

My experience is totally different. I patched my sage-on-gentoo to the max (ecl/maxima/cython/mpmath/ppl+this set), reinstall ecl-11.1.1, maxima-5.23.2 and sage-4.6.2.alpha4 and ran the tests.

The only abnormal failure for sage-on-gentoo was interfaces/r.py and it didn't show up again when I tried it individually. No SIGFPE, everything fine. 
This is a 64 bit intel machine and the install of the sage spkg itself was from scratch. 

It's the first time this patch set doesn't give me a huge amount of broken doctests back.

I don't know why Maxima gets so verbose (\"rat:...\", \"solve:...\", ascii art things in desolve, \"-- an error.  To debug this try debugmode(true);\"...), was it intended in the patches ?\n\nThat's wonderful! A cleaner refactoring as proposed above would be great. Concerning the verbosity: Maxima is always like that. With the current interface, pexpect receives this and filters it out. With the library setup, we're not listening to stdout anymore, so this ends up with the user. Possible solutions:\n\n- get maxima patched to have options to remove these warnings & verbosity. There are already a few out there (no error message is printed anymore thanks to turning one off), but others survive (the \" -- an error occurred ...\" is hard-wired. I've reported that one to Maxima)\n\n- live with it (that shouldn't be necessary)\n\n- redirect lisp standard output. Thankfully, lisp wraps all its I/O in its own stream system which allows for redirection so if we feed (setf *standard-output* *dev-null*) to ECL during maxima initialization, we'll never see anything (obviously not a good idea for debugging). Perhaps we also need that on *standard-error*. In fact, since a lot of this output does not seem to affect doctesting, perhaps it's already ending up on stderr.\n\nThis actually suggests another approach to getting a strings-based interface to maxima/ECLlib:\n\n- locate the Maxima Read/Evaluate/Print loop and break it open to just be a Read/Evaluate/Print routine maxima-rep (i.e., it returns instead of looping)\n- wrap this routine:\n\n```\n(defun mrep-with-stringio (maxima-input-string)\n   (let ((*standard-input* (make-string-input-stream maxima-input-string))\n         (*standard-output* (make-string-output-stream)))\n      (maxima-rep)\n      (get-output-stream-string *standard-output*)\n))\n```\nThis approach would be a little closer to the current pexpect interface, so you could possibly reuse more of the current maxima pexpect interface. You'd still only be communicating with maxima via string I/O, though, whereas we can do much better with the library. It would be an option if all you're interested in is creating an I/O based interface to maxima without fork.",

> So I get the same errors as reported above. I don't know why Maxima gets so verbose ("rat:...", "solve:...", ascii art things in desolve, "-- an error.  To debug this try debugmode(true);"...), was it intended in the patches ?

That's wonderful! A cleaner refactoring as proposed above would be great. Concerning the verbosity: Maxima is always like that. With the current interface, pexpect receives this and filters it out. With the library setup, we're not listening to stdout anymore, so this ends up with the user. Possible solutions:

- get maxima patched to have options to remove these warnings & verbosity. There are already a few out there (no error message is printed anymore thanks to turning one off), but others survive (the " -- an error occurred ..." is hard-wired. I've reported that one to Maxima)

- live with it (that shouldn't be necessary)

- redirect lisp standard output. Thankfully, lisp wraps all its I/O in its own stream system which allows for redirection so if we feed (setf *standard-output* *dev-null*) to ECL during maxima initialization, we'll never see anything (obviously not a good idea for debugging). Perhaps we also need that on *standard-error*. In fact, since a lot of this output does not seem to affect doctesting, perhaps it's already ending up on stderr.

This actually suggests another approach to getting a strings-based interface to maxima/ECLlib:

- locate the Maxima Read/Evaluate/Print loop and break it open to just be a Read/Evaluate/Print routine maxima-rep (i.e., it returns instead of looping)
- wrap this routine:

```
(defun mrep-with-stringio (maxima-input-string)
   (let ((*standard-input* (make-string-input-stream maxima-input-string))
         (*standard-output* (make-string-output-stream)))
      (maxima-rep)
      (get-output-stream-string *standard-output*)
))
```
This approach would be a little closer to the current pexpect interface, so you could possibly reuse more of the current maxima pexpect interface. You'd still only be communicating with maxima via string I/O, though, whereas we can do much better with the library. It would be an option if all you're interested in is creating an I/O based interface to maxima without fork.

<div id="comment:64" align="right">comment:64</div>

I've put a first (very) rough version of a patch to refactor the different interfaces:

* It split the previous Expect classes in Interface classes (without pexpect stuff, did not find a better name) and Expect classes (inheriting from the previous ones + pexpect stuff)
* MaximaAbstract classes depends on Interface classes
* MaximaLib on MaximaAbstract
* Maxima (classic) on MaximaAbstract and Expect

It kind of works easily thanks to the current Method Resolution Order used by the version of Python in Sage but it obviously introduces a lot of new failures in addition to the one above.

The patch must be applied after the "_p2" patches (and ecl_iter).

It is quite big, touches a lot of files, and should be splitted in at least two parts (split Expect; refactor).

It is absolutely not considered as finished (very far from it) and I did not test it (apart from trivial things like integrate(x)), it is mainly to get some feedback on the choices I made, so any comments are mare than welcome.

Ok I found the reason of the strange "ceil" function appearing.

That's because sr_to_max calls op_max=caar(maxima(expr).ecl()) and maxima(expr) can simplify the object change its structure, so the dictionary is wrongly built (we get "ceil" for "+").

Putting op_max=maxima(op).ecl() seems functional.

The issue with (log(9)*x).simplify_log('all') is similar.

Maxima transforms log(9!^x) back to log(9)*x before it is passed to string function in max_to_string:

```
(%i8) logexpand:false$

(%i9) string(log(9^x));

(%o9) "log(9)*x"

(%i10) log(9^x);

(%o10) log(9)*x
(%i11) simp:false$

(%i12) log(9^x);

(%o12) log(9^x)
(%i13) string(log(9^x));

(%o13) "log(9^x)"

```
As far as the classic pexpect interface is concerned, a lot of problems are solved if one changes  "back" return result to return result._sage_() in sage.symbolic.integration.external

It used to be return result.sage() but some routines in the fastcalculus patch for maxlib return symbolic object which do not have such a method but one with underscores.

I'll post updated patches when they are in a better shape.

A little digging gives us a way to access *just* the maxima reader, without the extra evaluation:

```
mymread=ecl_eval("""
(defun my-mread (cmd)
  (caddr (mread (make-string-input-stream cmd))))
""")

def parsemaxstring(l):
  return mymread('"%s;"'%l)
```
Examples:

```
sage: parsemaxstring("integral(x^2,x)")
<ECL: (($INTEGRAL) ((MEXPT) $X 2) $X)>
sage: parsemaxstring("ceiling(x^2+floor(x))")
<ECL: (($CEILING) ((MPLUS) ((MEXPT) $X 2) (($FLOOR) $X)))>
sage: parsemaxstring("log(9^x)")
<ECL: ((%LOG) ((MEXPT) 9 $X))>
```

```
sage: EclObject("#$ceiling(x^2+floor(x))$").cdr().car().cdr().car()
<ECL: (($CEILING) ((MPLUS) ((MEXPT) $X 2) (($FLOOR) $X)))>

With the new version of the patch only the following errors persist with maxima as a lib:

* unpickling problems,
* some timeouts (sage.interfaces.gap3).

And trivial to fix:

* error reporting,
* floating point precision.

With the classical maxima, I only get the first set of errors.

The translation of the derivatives seems better than before and the errors in desolver disappeared.

There is currently a problem with ecl and signals.

With the current initialization, interrupting a computation does not work well.

You can try the example of sage.interfaces.maxima with maxima as a lib:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import maxima_lib as maxlib
sage: maxlib('sum(1/x^2, x, 1, 10000)') # or bigger to be convinced

```
and hit Ctrl+C immediately.

Yes, sage.lib.ecl simply does not enable them. 

It looks like ECL development has carefully looked at how to best handle signals. See http://ecls.sourceforge.net/new-manual/ch22.html . But it also looks like a non-trivial task to adapt Sage's signal handling to play nice with the way ECL expects it. The ECL_OPT_SIGNAL_HANDLING_THREAD way sounds patently incompatible with sage.

You could of course try to just insert the appropriate sig_on() and sig_off() around the calls to ecl's "eval" and hope for the best. This must be a problem that has arisen for other libraries, such as pari, singular, ginac, gap etc.

I have tested the new packages with 4.6.2.alpha4 and I am finding largely agreement with JP. As a baseline, I have used ECL and Maxima from #10766 and #10773 respectively, with applied patches:

```
trac_10766-fix_doctest.patch
trac_10766-fix_symbolic_integration_integral.patch
trac_10773-fix_maxima_version.patch
trac_10743-ecl-iter_p1.patch
handlerswap.p2.patch #this is from ticket #10818
```
All doctests are OK there. When I further apply

```
trac_7377-abstract-maxima_p2.patch
trac_7377-maximalib_p2.patch
trac_7377-fastcalculus_p2.patch
trac_7377-better-ask-error_p2.patch
trac_7377-split_and_refactor.patch
```
I am finding doctest failures that are just due to different errors reporting and floating point, so these can be fixed by changing the doctests:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/calculus/functional.py # 1 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/maxima.py # 2 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/assumptions.py # 2 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py # 5 doctests failed
```
Furthermore,

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/tests/startup.py # 1 doctests failed
```
usually fails. Note that we are now initializing ECL upon startup, so we're really doing more work. Should we be lazy with this? This just means that the calculus maxima instance would have to be made lazy (i.e., set to a function that initializes maxima and then rebinds sage.calculus.maxima)

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx # 1 doctests failed
```
needs a pickling expert

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/gap3.py # Time out
```
this is a real error that was probably introduced by `split_and_refactor`. The timeout is caused by an infinite recursion upon exit (run with -verbose) and probably has to do with the fact that

```
sage: gap3("1+2")
```
now fails differently. It seems that a "name()" attribute is missing. If you now try to "quit()", an infinite loop on some Exception resolution is triggered, but I expect the damage happened in the line above. gap3 is optional, by the way, but the error apparently already happens with tests that check the absence of gap3.

Impressive progress indeed!

Some forensics on:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx
```
The error occurs on
`_class__sage_interfaces_maxima_MaximaFunction__.sobj` in the pickle jar, coming from the doctest (slightly adapted):

```
sage: f=maxima.function('x,y','sin(x+y)')
sage: save(f,"newpickle.sobj")
sage: load("newpickle.sobj")==f
True
```
The incompatibility seems to come from a rearranging of the abstract_maxima interface etc.
To pin down version information:

```
$ ls -l _class__sage_interfaces_maxima_MaximaFunction__.*
-rw-r--r-- 1 nbruin nbruin  96 2009-03-10 13:04 _class__sage_interfaces_maxima_MaximaFunction__.sobj
-rw-r--r-- 1 nbruin nbruin 130 2009-03-10 13:04 _class__sage_interfaces_maxima_MaximaFunction__.txt
$ cat _class__sage_interfaces_maxima_MaximaFunction__.txt
type(obj) = <class 'sage.interfaces.maxima.MaximaFunction'>
version = 3.4.rc1
obj =
'                                    sage270'
```
Loading this pickle into a new version yields:

```
sage: load("/home/nbruin/_class__sage_interfaces_maxima_MaximaFunction__.sobj");
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'reduce_load_Maxima_function'
```
On the other hand, loading the new pickle into an old version (4.3.4):

```
sage: load("newpickle.sobj");
ImportError: No module named maxima_abstract
```
So this seems to be not so much an error but more a non-compatible change. I am sure these have happened before elsewhere. I'd be happy to just accept the fact that these pickles aren't portable across these versions, but if someone has an example we might be able to put the hooks in to preserve backwards compatibility (really, no-one should have a reason to pickle maxima functions from sage).

Thanks for the fix, that was my mistake: I changed some references to self.!__name to calls to a name() function which was much more clear with the new class hierarchy.

I confirm that your patch fixes the gap3 timeout (without gap3 installed).

I'll post an updated patch "split_and_refactor" including your fixes and some changes so that the name of "MaximaLib" is now "_maxima_lib_" (even if most of the time, if not always, the related objects are treated like maxima ones for now).

As far as the pickling problem is concerned, I was aware that it was "just" caused by the changes in class hierarchy (and names).

I search a little bit through Google (!http://ask.sagemath.org/question/123/what-is-the-standard-pickle-jar-for-and-how-do-i), and I think the Sage general policy is to be able to pick up old pickles (quite lgical), so I guess that we should try to include a workaround.

...Ok you've just posted a fix for that one too, so I'll include it as well.

I'm currently running "make ptestlong" to check for errors we could have missed.

As soon as it is finished (say in a couple of hours), I'll post a new version of "split_and_refactor" including the following patches:

```
trac_7377-split_and_refactor.patch
trac_7377-interface-namefix.patch
trac_7377-pickle-fix.patch

```
And a minor change I made inbetween which is in none of these patches (setting the "name" of maxima lib to "_maxima_lib_" rather than "_maxima_").

Is that what you wanted (there will still be successive patches applied to maxima* files... however) ?

With the new patch that follows (and without lazy patch!), I only get the following failures due to error reporting and float precision:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tests failed:

	sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py # 2 doctests failed
	sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/calculus/functional.py # 1 doctests failed

	sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py # 5 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 2633.7 seconds

```
The update patch should be "consolidated" as asked (that was because of the command I used to generate it).

So the patches should be applied as follows:

```
trac_7377-abstract-maxima_p2.patch
trac_7377-maximalib_p2.patch
trac_7377-fastcalculus_p2.patch
trac_7377-better-ask-error_p2.patch
trac_7377-split_and_refactor_p2.patch

```
Applying "lazy" patch breaks more test for me:

* lazy objects are not callable so maxima(x) fails in sage.plot.plot3d.plot3d
* exception raised in sage.plot.line

Sorry and thanks for catching. Both are solved by adding a "__call__" method to lazy:

```
    def __call__(self,*args,**kwargs):
        import sage.interfaces.maxima_lib
        sage.calculus.calculus.maxima = sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.maxima
        return sage.calculus.calculus.maxima(*args,**kwargs)
```
but in fact `sage.misc.lazy_import` does exactly what we need here. (See attached patch). I've ran doctests and I don't think the lazy causes additional fails.

Incidentally, I'm getting a silly doctest failure

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py"
```
for the result of

```
sage: sorted(maxima._commands(verbose=False))
```
but it looks like nothing has changed. Perhaps my build is corrupted.

Turns out the rounding errors weren't really that. Rather, max_to_sr preferred to return floats rather than RealDoubleElement, which are apparently the sage default type for float, and these print differently:

```

> > Patch attached. That means that the `__only__` doctest failures now are due to the fact that "maxima asks a question" gets reported via a different error. Ready for review?

> I'm sorry I haven't been able to test this lately.  Can you give an example?  As long as the end user still knows what to do (as in, `assume(x>0)` etc.) that should be fine.

For example:

```
    sage: integral(x^n,x)
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints (try the command 'assume(n+1>0)' before integral or limit evaluation, for example):
    Is  n+1  zero or nonzero?
Got:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: ECL says: Maxima asks: Is  n+1  zero or nonzero?

```
So we do not parse the error message and are less explicit than before.

There are still some things I'd like to change before a potential review:

1. Currently the interact function is broken for maxima_lib, it would be nicer to have it working than deleting it (and we should not leave something broken)
2. I'll update "split_and_refactor" to get rid of superfluous terpri or string-trim as stated in comment 73
3. Someone should check error stated in comment 88, I also got it sometimes, not sure why because that code was not so much touched
4. I could merge "floatcast" with "fast_calulculus" or "split_and_refactor" so that we have less patches to apply and it is easier to test
5. Parse error messages or just change the doctests and do bettor error reporting later.

Afterwards (in other tickets ?):

1. Add doctests to maxima_abstract and maxima_lib
2. Avoid as much as possible string conversion in maxima_lib and take into account comment 73.

Here is a patch to fix the interact function. It was only broken because python_to_ecl did not convert unicode objects.

My workaround is to convert the unicode object to an str object and convert that object as before.

There is surely a better way to do it, feel free to post a better patch and I'll integrate it to split_and_refactor instead of this one.

Hmm, we should really catch this particular RuntimeError (enough to search for 'Maxima asks', I think) and then copy the code which gave the user a potential way to fix it.  This behavior will be too confusing for the most likely people to be using Maxima, which is why we changed it the first time.  Should be pretty easy to copy from the previous behavior, though, if you are still getting this error.

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A98):
> Is there a way to format the returned message in a similar way to how it currently happens (so that your ellipses above are filled in)?

Yes, you could do the string processing in lisp, but in that case you may want to intercept that various ask... routines to preformat the question that gets sent to retrieve to begin with. Those should have more structured information on what question is asked, so formatting the question differently there should be quite cheap. However, there are two points why I think it's a bad idea anyway:

* The advice currently is wrong! Why would "...>0" be the right thing? That just propagates a kind of halfbrained trial-and-error mathematics that I cannot bring myself to endorse. The proper advice is for the user to read up on the assume(...) facility.

* There are big problems with relying on the print names of symbols agreeing between maxima and sage. Now that we're moving away from string-based communication it would be quite easy to let SR("x") correspond to EclObject("$SAGE-SYMBOLIC-VARIABLE-4711"). The actual question that maxima asks is not so enlightening anymore in that situation.

In fact, currently, the advice already leads to errors

```
sage: my_symbolic_n=SR.var('n')
sage: limit(x^my_symbolic_n,x=oo)
TypeError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints (try the command 'assume(n>0)' before integral or limit evaluation, for example):
Is  n  positive, negative, or zero?
sage: assume(n>0)
AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'assume'
sage: n
<function numerical_approx at 0x18e0410>
```
so the user actually has a good reason to not shadow the python binding of n, but of course the print name n for a symbolic variable is very desirable. You CANNOT assume that the print name corresponds with the python variable bound to your object and sage SHOULD NOT propagate such assumptions in its error messages. It's nice to make a program accessible to starters but not at the expense of allowing them to progress to experienced users.

Nothing here is stopping someone from advancing to being experienced.  This problem occurs other places than here - see many discussions on sage-devel about print names not coinciding, or about var() being annoying in general.  If someone knows anything about what you are saying, they will be plenty experienced to realize that this message isn't talking about 'their' n.

Solve it how you like. I don't particularly mind what sage does. I've given you the reasons why `__I__` won't be doing it. I think you can settle on some fixed example expression inside the error message, a la "A declaration along the lines of assume(x>0) may help solve your problem.", because the surgery that is currently done doesn't always lead to useful suggestions anyway, i.e.,

```
sage: var('x,y')

suggests `assume( (y+1)*(y-1) > 0 )` which doesn't make the question go away, and the fact that sage clearly goes out of its way to make a suggestion that doesn't turn out to help really does look silly.

<div id="comment:104" align="right">comment:104</div>

I just updated the split_and_refactor patch to rmove supefluous calls to "terpri" and "mterpri".

I left the "strim-string" because it seems that "displa" adds one.

Anyway, there should be work done on error reporting (I'd say later, let's try to get the lib interface reviewed and merged now).

Nils and I got the same problem as FranÃ§ois in maxima_abstract.

It's related to the data saved in ~/.sage/maxima_commandlist_cache.sobj which seems to get updated with unrelated data.

If you delete the file and rerun the test, it gives you what it should.

I'll have a look at it.

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment%3A103):

> Tried all the patches on top of the current 4.7.alpha2. Apart from the already much discussed doctests errors mentioned so far I had one in interfaces/maxima_abstract.py ` sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py" ********************************************************************** File "/usr/share/sage/devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py", line 197: sage: sorted(maxima._commands(verbose=False)) Expected: ['Alpha', 'Beta', ... 'zunderflow'] Got: ['Alpha', 'Beta',  <cut a very long list> 'zunderflow', 'zz'] `

The problem here is that some doctest in maxima_abstract.py creates something called 'zz' and if the test line 197 gets executed afterwards, self.!__commands gets built then and includes 'zz', it fails... not really sure why this happens now and did not before.

If I put a call to self._commands() at the beginning of the doctest for trait_names(), self.!__commands is built without 'zz'.

So we could consider that this is not a bug.

What's more problematic is that the result of _commands() gets cached and includes a fraction of random variable names (as 'sage???' and the problematic 'zz'). that was already the case before but fortunately no var between 'Alpha' and 'Beta' or after 'zunderflow' was created.

Okay, I think I learned enough just barely enough Lisp now that I might be able to help on the assumptions/declarations issue.  

However, there are other Maxima errors that might get reported.  So one would, at the minimum, want to have a conditional error situation.  One princ option wouldn't be enough.  That seems to be a nightmare to do (at least for someone not an expert in Lisp).  I even briefly wondered whether we might want Sage people at the command line to be able to interact and type 'y' like in Maxima, which perhaps is possible now... anyway, that was lies madness, at least for me.

So would it be terribly horrible to catch in the same way the function already does?

```
    def sr_integral(self,*args):
        try:
            return max_to_sr(maxima_eval(([max_integrate],[sr_to_max(SR(a)) for a in args])))
        except RuntimeError, error:
            s = str(error)
            if "Divergent" in s or "divergent" in s:
                raise ValueError, "Integral is divergent."
            else:
                raise error
```
This is only going to slow things down if there is, in fact, an error.  I don't see why one couldn't put something here, if we are already going to catch divergent integrals.  And this is basically how it was handled before.

One could similarly do this with `sr_limit` (what is `sr_tlimit`?), with examples like 

```
sage: var('a')    
a
sage: limit(x^a,x=0)
<snip>
RuntimeError: ECL says: Maxima asks: Is  a  positive, negative, or zero?
```
which, remarkably, is not in the doctests (there is no limit question-asking error, that is, despite the fact that Maxima certainly will ask about this).

Similarly, with the inconsistent assumptions, one could change the try/except

```
      File "/Users/student/Desktop/sage-4.6.2/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/symbolic/assumptions.py", line 104, in assume
        maxima.eval("declare(%s, %s)" % (repr(self._var), self._assumption))
      File "/Users/student/Desktop/sage-4.6.2/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py", line 266, in eval
        if statement: result = ((result + '\n') if result else '') + max_to_string(maxima_eval("#$%s$"%statement))
      File "ecl.pyx", line 619, in sage.libs.ecl.EclObject.__call__ (sage/libs/ecl.c:4425)
      File "ecl.pyx", line 202, in sage.libs.ecl.ecl_safe_apply (sage/libs/ecl.c:2609)
    RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: declare: inconsistent declaration declare(x,odd)
```
in assumptions.py to look for a RuntimeError.  

The latter is pretty easy to fix, I think.  But hopefully all of these could lead to finishing this off.

What about doctests?  I noticed that definitely not all functions are doctested - no surprise, this is a huge project.  Will that hold up merging of this, though?  

```
devel/sage/sage/interfaces//maxima_lib.py
SCORE devel/sage/sage/interfaces//maxima_lib.py: 37% (13 of 35)
devel/sage/sage/interfaces//maxima_abstract.py

```

The current Maxima interface has 94 of 100 functions doctested.  Just throwing it out there, I know jpflori also has mentioned it above, but this is a little data on it.

Never mind, this is all correct as it stands.  I have been singularly unhelpful, though not by design.  Maybe one could copy the material at the top of `maxima.py` and put it in `maxima_lib.py` with a `from sage.interface.maxima_lib import maxima` at the very beginning, with some clarifying words.  That would provide a double check, too.

There are also a few places in a few docs that still mention expect wrongly, I think - I'll keep looking for them.  

Issues I think I can deal with while taking care of the error handling:

* `maxima._expect_expr`, while usefully staying the same as before, certainly isn't doctested by those tests any more.
* Can the old `sr_integral` etc. in `maxima.py` be removed, or should they be kept in case someone wanted to use the pexpect for doing calculus?  I would think remove.
* With respect to `sr_sum` and `sr_integral`, since they are implementing the divergent integral/sum check, should we remove those from `calculus.py` and `symbolic.integration.external.py`?  Those pieces of code will probably never be reached, since the ValueError is already raised in `maxima_lib.py`.

I'll keep looking for things like this, hopefully catch as many as possible.

Okay, while this patch is not 100% ready, it is certainly good enough to look at and give feedback on.  It takes care of the three things I mention above, and adds a little doctesting.  It also documents `assume` more comprehensively early in its docstring.

I get a weird error with this, though:

```
sage:             sage: var('x, n')
(x, n)
sage:             sage: integral(x^n,x)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (534, 0))
<snip - then the expected ValueError>
```
which I cannot explain.

We now have 100% ((really) basic (and stupid)) doctests coverage.

I also fixed some minor issues here and there.

What could be postponed to later tickets:

* better doctests
* better error handling
* better conversions between maxima and sr
* reorganize the code in maxima_lib to make it clearer

Sorry I do not have time to check this properly today.  Do you get the 

```
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
```
problem with these patches?  I hope not :)

A couple very small points about the doctests patch, which by the way is nontrivial and nice all by itself.
* You should have a `loads(dumps(foo))==foo` test if possible for class definitions.  I think there are eight of these? 
* You probably don't need to put `INPUT` and/or `OUTPUT` blocks if there isn't one or it's essentially stated in the first line of the documentation - I'm thinking of `_false_symbol` or `version`.  Up to you, of course, since you already did it.
* In a few places where you have more than 'really basic and stupid' documentation (you sell yourself short! it's not bad at all) you have some lines that aren't going to work.  Ones like

```
- ``use_disk_cache`` - boolean (default: True); if set to True, try to read cached result from disk 
```
are too long, and should be made into two lines like you did for 

```
- ``eqns`` - a list of m strings; each representing a linear 
question in m = n variables 
```
However, these will cause a problem in Sphinx, I think, unless you reformat them like so

```
- ``eqns`` - a list of m strings; each representing a linear 
  question in m = n variables 
```
This won't show up well on Trac, but notice that the 'q' in 'question' is lined up with the first '`' in '``eqns``'.  This was correctly done for 'pts_list', for example.

It looks like the `zunderflow zz` was fixed as well, and assuming that fix passes tests as well, I think it can be 'needs review'.  

In fact, as long as everyone involved is not reviewing their own patch, this can even be 'positive review'.  For instance, I will assume that JP slightly changing my reviewer patch indicates no problems with it.   

Can anyone say what would still need to be done for positive review, other than passing all long doctests, which I can't check right now, and taking care of the things above which will lead to Sphinx errors?

I do not get that one.

It is fixed because I changed the check to something else.

The real problem is that this test gives a somewhat random output according to when it is run.

So I guess the problem, if there is one, does not lie in the test used now, but in the implementation of the function itself.

See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7377#comment:106 I guess we could open another ticket if we want to change the current behavior.

It's not hard and fast, but it makes it so that when it shows up in a terminal window it doesn't look weird. 
> For the INPUT and OUTPUT blocks, I just tried to follow http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html as much as possible to get something consistent even if it is often redundant or empty.

Maybe we need to add something here about that...

> It is fixed because I changed the check to something else.

Yes, I saw that the fix was the one you suggested earlier - sorry for not being clear about that.
> The real problem is that this test gives a somewhat random output according to when it is run.

Well, not too bad.  One would expect this, given the nature of the function.

Okay, so I'll put this to 'needs work' and then hopefully it will be very easy to produce a p1 of the doctests patch that has the loads/dumps and fixes the other very minor issues.  I can try to review that patch tomorrow or Wednesday (US East Coast) and run tests.

Can you think of anything that you have done that hasn't been positively reviewed by Nils or Francois?  It's a little hard to determine that from the comments.  At any rate this will be one of the better-tested major changes in how we interface to a sub-program, thanks to the long gestation period.

So we could just replace all of those and remove the catch for inconsistent declarations in the code, I guess.\n\n```\n> **********************************************************************\n> File \"/usr/share/sage/devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/assumptions.py\", line 294:\n>     sage: sum(a*q^k, k, 0, oo)\n>     NameError: name 'k' is not defined\n```\nOops.

That means we can't just remove the piece about this in the integration code, as I thought.  Since ECL returns the divergent error, it seemed like we could, but apparently skipping the error still outputs the principal value.  I would need someone with knowledge of how the new interface works to figure out how to make sure this reports an error.\n\n```\n> sage -t -force_lib \"devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py\"\n> **********************************************************************\n> File \"/usr/share/sage/devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py\", line 356:\n>     sage: integrate(1/x^3,x,-1,3)\n> Expected:\n>     Traceback (most recent call last):\n>     ...\n>     ValueError: Integral is divergent.\n> Got:\n>     4/9\n```\nSame thing for this one - we are catching it, but it still prints the question.  How do we make sure it doesn't do that?  I don't think it did that before, so it may be one of the apparently-not-innocuous things JP removed in the last patch.\n\n```\n>     sage: integrate(1/(x^3 *(a+b*x)^(1/3)), x)\n>     ValueError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints; using the 'assume' command before integral evaluation *may* help (example of legal syntax is 'assume(a>0)', see `assume?` for more details)\n>     Is  a  positive or negative?\n> **********************************************************************\n> File \"/usr/share/sage/devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py\", line 484:\n>     sage: res = integral(f,x,0.0001414, 1.); res\n>     ValueError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints; using the 'assume' command before integral evaluation *may* help (example of legal syntax is 'assume((y-1)*(y+1)>0)', see `assume?` for more details)\n>     Is  (y-1)*(y+1)  positive, negative, or zero?\n```",

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment%3A121):
> After applying the patches I am now getting:

Thank you so much!  I knew I was tired when I made that patch, hence it not being quite ready for prime time.  To be fair, I warned of this.  But it shouldn't be too bad to make a p3 of it.

In this case, the new message is just as informative as the old one (though longer).  So we could just replace all of those and remove the catch for inconsistent declarations in the code, I guess.

```

Oops.  Sorry.  Same for the next one.

```
This is interesting.  That means we can't just remove the piece about this in the integration code, as I thought.  Since ECL returns the divergent error, it seemed like we could, but apparently skipping the error still outputs the principal value.  I would need someone with knowledge of how the new interface works to figure out how to make sure this reports an error.

Same thing for this one - we are catching it, but it still prints the question.  How do we make sure it doesn't do that?  I don't think it did that before, so it may be one of the apparently-not-innocuous things JP removed in the last patch.

I uploaded updated versions of both last patches. I accidently deleted two lines in the previous one which cause the principal error, they are restored now. I added pickling tests, not sure they make sense. Also some various fixes and cosmetic changes to reduce line lengths for sphynx and readibility.

Afterwards "make ptestlong" reported no errors on my computer.

Don't know if someone already took a look at what I did to split Interface class out of Expect class.

It seems functional now, but maybe I left some mistakes there.

I don't know if they do either, but this is one of the things Sage has come to a consensus on, for better or for worse.  Some were already there, as it turned out - in the `__init__`, not class definition - but doesn't hurt to have the others.

I'll check that all out next, after running my own tests.  There is one final 'evalutation' that I should be able to fix very easily.

I'll try to look at it, but I fear there is a little too much ECL there for me to feel comfortable reviewing that.

> It seems functional now, but maybe I left some mistakes there.

Maybe Francois can then give positive review :)

I should point out that if this depends on #10743, in principle this ticket's positive review wouldn't be very useful until that one is reviewed.

Okay, the HTML docs look fine in general.  Good catch on a few of the indentations that were incorrect before in any case.  

```
   1.

      Sage can currently only understand a subset of the output of Maxima,

      Maple and Mathematica, so even if the chosen backend can perform

      the summation the result might not be convertable into a Sage

      expression.
```
shouldn't be double-spaced, but this is not really a big deal because it still looks ok.

More importantly, but still not enough to stop positive review, is the fact that the new files are not in the documentation!  We will need to fix `interfaces.rst` in the sage/doc/en/ folder to be accurate, as well as to include the new `sage/interfaces/maxima_lib`, `sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract`, and `sage/interfaces/interface` documentation.  This is now #10942.

I am not sure about alpha3 either, it is a big change. He may object to it for 4.7 altogether. In any case we'll be ready to be picked up at the next opportunity.

I rebased the patches against sage 4.7.alpha3.
I could run make ptestlong yet because upgrade from 4.6.2 failed (givaro problem) and the binary provided for 4.7.alpha3 would not run (some liblapack problem).
However it should apply cleanly.
I'm building 4.7.alpha3 from source and will test when finished.

Could you tell me where to have a look for those chatty things ? Don't have much time to investigate that alone right now.

It is also a little bit surprising because the splitting of the expect class into expect and interface classes should be kind of trivial (just take a bunch of methods in expect and paste them in a superclass).

At least for most classes inheriting expect it should not have dramatic consequences. Of course I could have screwed up something in the way.

Both Maxima classes are more problematic because of multiple inheritance. It "works" now thanks to python MRO, but IIRC, that MRO will change with python 3.0 and could break everything.

I have posted a log at #9958 (sage-4.7.alpha4-test.log.bz2) look for mwrank.py for example.

Are you sure that mwrank is related in any way to the expect.py/interface.py we've modified here ?

mwrank.pyx provides access to a C++ library and the interface.py in the same folder just provides direct python access to methods defined in the first file or am I completely missing something here ?

<div id="comment:163" align="right">comment:163</div>

I've search through the logs for "interfaces" (the main directory wa are concerned with), "calculus" and "symbolic".

The only noise I found so far is:

```
File "/usr/share/sage/devel/sage-main/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 7728:
    sage: f = 1 + x + sqrt(x+2); f.find_root(-2,10)
Expected:
    -1.6180339887498949
Got:
    -1.618033988749895
#0: simplify_sum(expr='sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
#1: simplify_sum(expr=a*'sum(q^k,k,0,inf))

```
and:

```
File "/usr/share/sage/devel/sage-main/sage/calculus/calculus.py", line 223:
    sage: float(z)
Expected:
    4.6467837624329356
Got:
    4.646783762432936
#0: simplify_sum(expr='sum(q^k,k,0,inf))
#1: simplify_sum(expr=a*'sum(q^k,k,0,inf))

```
Which does not cause any problem if the doctest passes (i.e. if we set the expected answer to the correct precision).

It's caused in some way by ECL (I've tried to redirect as much as possible toward "/dev/null" slightly modifying the first version of the patches but could not get better result, I'm no expert in Lisp) and not by the refactoring of expect.py into expect.py/interface.py
