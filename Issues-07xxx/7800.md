Without this, on many platforms -- e.g., sage.math -- it takes hours to generate keys, since GNUtls's key generation program is crap.

Hi,

I kept suggesting the above, because long ago I wrote this code in dsage:

-------------
    if os.uname()[0] != 'Darwin' and cmd_exists('openssl'):
        # We use openssl by default if it exists, since it is *vastly*
        # faster on Linux.
        cmd = ['openssl genrsa > %s' % privkey_file]
        print "Using openssl to generate key"
        print cmd[0]
        subprocess.call(cmd, shell=True)
-------------

So I thought people were having issues with slow keys since they didn't have openssl installed.  However, I just checked and the above code mysteriously morphed into:

-------------
    if False and os.uname()[0] != 'Darwin' and cmd_exists('openssl'):
        # We use openssl by default if it exists, since it is *vastly*
        # faster on Linux.
        cmd = ['openssl genrsa > %s' % privkey_file]
        print "Using openssl to generate key"
        print cmd[0]
        subprocess.call(cmd, shell=True)
    else:...
-------------

I'm guessing somebody tested certtool on one platform where they got luck and certtool seemed to actually work in a reasonable amount of time, and concluded the issue was fixed.  Nope. 

Please referee

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7800

which reverts this behavior, switching back to using openssl if available.
