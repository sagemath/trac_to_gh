From [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/da735a05781e3945):

```
At the end of the script which runs sage there is this:

# This should kill all children of this process too.
# Uncomment this if you have trouble with orphans.
# Note that you'll get an annoying "Killed" message
# whenver Sage exists.
# kill -9 -$$

where the last but one line should read

# whenever Sage exits.

(2 typos!)
```
