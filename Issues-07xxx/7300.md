It is often useful when solving linear programs to see which constraints are tight.... And so there should be a way to do it in Sage !!!

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
Perhaps there should be a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` method similar to `get_values` that retrieves the values of the constraint functions at the current solution; its input should be the same as the input to `constraints`.

Note also that some backends already have support for getting this kind of information, for example GLPK has `get_row_prim`.
