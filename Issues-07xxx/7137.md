Using

* A Sun Blade 2000 running Solaris 10 update 7
* Sage 4.1.2.rc0
* gcc 4.4.1
* SAGE64 exported to "yes" 

Looking at the directory $SAGE_HOME/local/bin, we can see that *ratpoint* is being built as 32-bit binary, despite the fact that SAGE64 was set to "yes"

```
drkirkby@swan:[~/sage/gcc64-sage-4.1.2.rc0/local/bin] $ file ratpoint
ratpoint:       ELF 32-bit MSB executable SPARC32PLUS Version 1, V8+ Required, dynamically linked, stripped
```

This is **far** from the only package building 32-bit when SAGE64 is set to "yes" on Solaris. All of the following do, and I suspect there are many others too.

* zlib #7128
* libgpg_error #7129
* libpng #7130
* libcliquer #7131
* pari #7133
* ntl #7134 
* python #7135
* gp #7136
    
mpir currently mixes 32 and 64-bit objects, so does not build at all #7132.

I will sort this package out after creating a new sage-env, which exports all the variables properly, including the flag for building 64-bit code, which is not always -m64.

Although there is no support for AIX or HP-UX in Sage yet, we could potentially add it - I personally own machines running AIX and HP-UX.

IBM's compiler on AIX uses -q64, and HP's on HP-UX uses +DD64.

The sensible way to resolve this is to add the correct flag on every platform.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
This was fixed for OpenSolaris #8351. The fix also works for Solaris 10, so this can be closed.
