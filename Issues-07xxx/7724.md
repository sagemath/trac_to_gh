There's a merging conflict:

```

Hello !!

I could not reproduce your merging conflict, though as I had applied the patch I use the occasion to add a few other things... You will find in this new version of the patch

* A function beadth_dirst_search ( with optional arguments ``reverse`` and ``ignore_direction``
* A function ``depth_first_search`` with the same paremeters
* A function ``is_connected``
* A function ``is_strongly_connected``
* I needed to know inside the graph backend whether the graph was directed or not : I thought for some time about it, and ended up adding to the constructors of ``Graph`` and ``DiGraph`` a line ``self._backend.directed = True/False`` according to the situation.
* I also modified graph.py so that it would use the functions defined in c_graph whenever possible, and NetworkX otherwise

And with this, we should be another step closer.. :-)
