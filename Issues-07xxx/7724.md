Hello !!

I could not reproduce your merging conflict, though as I had applied the patch I use the occasion to add a few other things... You will find in this new version of the patch

* A function beadth_dirst_search ( with optional arguments ``reverse`` and ``ignore_direction``
* A function ``depth_first_search`` with the same paremeters
* A function ``is_connected``
* A function ``is_strongly_connected``
* I needed to know inside the graph backend whether the graph was directed or not : I thought for some time about it, and ended up adding to the constructors of ``Graph`` and ``DiGraph`` a line ``self._backend.directed = True/False`` according to the situation.
* I also modified graph.py so that it would use the functions defined in c_graph whenever possible, and NetworkX otherwise

And with this, we should be another step closer.. :-)

But you can still define a iterator class.

The following patch is based on your work, and defines an iterator. You can choose which one you prefer.

1. The iterator patch is preferable, since there are actual speed gains when a loop is terminated early. I've rebased the patch against sage-4.3.

2. There is some confusion as to the function `get_vertex`. This should go from Python objects to ints, and in several places it is used the other way around.
