#1497 added a few lines of code 

```
#!/usr/bin/env
import ctypes
print str(8*ctypes.sizeof(ctypes.c_long))
```
into the ATLAS build process, which reports the number of bits Sage was compiled as. It makes use of the module 'ctypes' in Python, but 

http://docs.activestate.com/activepython/2.5/whatsincluded.html

shows that ctypes is seriosuly broken on many platforms, including

* Older linux-x86 build failures
* aix-powerpc build failures
* linux-ia64 build failures
* solaris-sparc build failures
* solaris-x86 build failures
* hpux-parisc libffi not ported to PA-RISC arch
* hpux-ia64 build failures
* win64

Hence the code needs replacing with something less broken

See: 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/portability/atlas-3.8.3.p10/

for an updated version of ATLAS which fixes this issue. bitwidth.py has been changed. 

The 4/5 lines of code I used were posted on sage-devel by  vengoroso@gmail.com but I don't know his fully name, so can't give full credit. Please let us know your full name! 

Note however, for me at least, ATLAS does not build fully, but at least it gets further than it did on Open Solaris.

Maybe I should use gcc gcc-4.4.2 with the gnu loader?
