So I don't actually *need* matrix_of_frobenius_hyperelliptic of a curve over an extension field, but I inadvertently passed it in during a computation and caused a segfault. It would be nice for this to work (coercion?), since the curve is defined over QQ anyway.

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x^3-10*x+9)
sage: K = Qp(3,5)
sage: J.<a> = K.extension(x^30-3)
sage: HJ = H.change_ring(J)
sage: import sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.monsky_washnitzer as mw
sage: M_frob, forms = mw.matrix_of_frobenius_hyperelliptic(HJ)
...SIGSEGV...
```
