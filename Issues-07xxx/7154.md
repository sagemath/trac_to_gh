There should be a consistent naming scheme for the "thickness" of graphics objects. If I have a function my_plot(**kwds) that passes **kwds to all constructed graphics objects, then my_plot(thickness=5) should consistently scale the thickness. 

The current status is:

```
  sage: point([0,0], pointsize = 5)
  sage: point3d((0,0,0), thickness=5)                      
  sage: line2d([[0,0],[1,1]], thickness=5)
  sage: line3d([[0,0,0],[1,1,0]], thickness=5)
  sage: arrow([0,0],[1,1], width=5)    
  sage: arrow3d([0,0,0],[1,1,1], thickness=5)
  sage: polygon([(0,0), (1,1), (0,1)], thickness=5)      
  sage: polygon3d([(0,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0)], thickness=5)
```

Also, the arrow3d thickness behaves differently than the thickness of point3d and line3d: If you zoom in, the arrow becomes bigger and bigger like a physical object. The line3d and point3d stay the same apparent size, about thickness pixels wide on screen. Since the arrow3d is usually used to indicate a direction it would be nice if it would scale (or, rather, not scale) just like point3d and line3d.

```
  sage: scene = \
  ....: line3d([[1,0,0],[1,3,0]],thickness=5) + \
  ....: arrow3d([2,0,0],[2,3,0],thickness=5) + \
  ....: point3d([3,2,0],thickness=5)
  sage: scene.show( aspect_ratio=[1,1,1])
```

and then zoom in/out in the Jmol viewer.

I agree with the first comment; the arguments should distinguish between "width", which is in data coordinates and changes as you zoom, and "thickness", which is in screen coordinates, and does not change as you zoom.  Figure out which is which for the cases above, and probably use the `@`rename_keyword decorator from the plotting code to change instances with deprecation.

Thanks!  Fixing things like this really add to the polish and ease-of-use of Sage, and make it much more user-friendly.

Three comments:

1. I think the rename_keyword works the other way.  See this example from the docs:

```
rename_keyword(deprecated='Sage version 4.2', deprecated_option='new_option')
```

Don't you want it to be thickness='width'?  Also, the actual keyword in the function should be changed in the function declaration (you can probably then search and replace in the function definition to replace 'thickness' with 'width'.

2. Could you add a deprecation by using the deprecation feature of rename_keyword?

3. Could you add a short doctest showing the deprecation warning and the new option?  The deprecation warning should probably be in a TESTS: section, while the new option should definitely be in the EXAMPLES section.

Thanks for working on this!
