The function minimum_outdegree_orientation() returns a DiGraph which is an orientation of the current graph, such that the maximum out-degree is minimized.

Uses LP !

I'm ready to give this a positive review, except there is a conflict:

```
Given a complete bipartite graph `K_{n,m}`, the minimum  
outdegree of an orientation is  
`\left\lceil \frac {nm} {n+m}\right\rceil`:: 

sage: g = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(3,4) 
sage: o = g.minimum_outdegree_orientation() # optional - requires GLPK or CBC 
sage: max(o.out_degree()) == ceil((4*3)/(3+4)) # optional - requires GLPK or CBC 
True
```

Should "the minimum outdegree" be "the smallest possible maximum outdegree", or something similar?
