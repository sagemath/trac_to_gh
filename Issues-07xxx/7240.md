The patch applies fine to 4.3.rc0 after installing the optional spkg at #7239 and the patch there, and tests pass.  Good doctests included.

BUT in both places where _cunningham_prime_factors() is called, a run-time error will be raised if the optional database is not installed.  If the database is really going to be optional then these calls must be wrapped with try/except, otherwise people who have not installed the optional package will find lots of their code fails.

Hence: needs work.

In fact if the patch from #7239 is applied, but the database not installed, `_factor_cunningham` will just be the usual factor, with the first time it's called a warning (not an error) saying:

"You might consider installing the optional package for factoring Cunningham numbers with the following command: ``sage -i cunningham_tables-1.0``"

Moreover this warning will only be seen if the characteristic is `p \in {2,3,5,7,11}` and `p^k > 2^100`. I thought it was nice to tell the user that there exists an optional package useful for them, but I can remove it if necessary.

So I suggest that we give this a positive review.  This will take two steps....

Thank you for the clarification, John. The merging of this ticket can wait until:

1. the (currently optional) Cunningham package becomes a standard spkg; or
2. there is some code to test whether that spkg is installed.

Dear everyone,

I would like to add a few comments here.  If I understand things correctly, the Cunningham database in SAGE is now just a list of numbers without structure, right?

I have written myself a PARI/GP-2.4 script which

1) tries to determine which b<sup>n</sup>-1 numbers have a non-trivial gcd with a given number.  The algorithm is essentially p-1 factorisation, but with several well-chosen bases instead of one (random) base.

2) uses that information to do Aurifeuillian factorisation and a more clever table lookup.

Step 1) can be skipped if we know exactly that we want to factor 10^555-1 for example.

I could probably manage to port this to some SAGE functions in Python.  Once this has been done, I would like to add a lot more factors to more numbers of the form b^n-1 to the database (larger b and n).

Yes right, this was just a quick and dirty solution to my problems.

This would be great if you port your work to SAGE. My first thought was to include your script but currently SAGE is still shipping pari 2.3.3.
