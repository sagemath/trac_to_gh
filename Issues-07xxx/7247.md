I think this is because gettext isn't installed.  We either need to include gettext (which may have its own benefits) or see if we can build mercurial without gettext support.

Hmm.  Mercurial built fine on OS X 10.6 on my machine.  At various points in install.log, it says

```
checking for xgettext... no
...
checking for GNU gettext in libc... no
...
checking for GNU gettext in libintl... no
```
so I don't seem to have gettext installed.

It turns out there were a copy of gettext in my /usr/local/bin/ directory from 2006 -- probably from installing tex or something, and it was now broken.  Mercurial I guess was never broken by it before.  Anyway, removing it and also the broken msgfmt and now mercurial builds.  Thus I'm closing this ticket as invalid.  Thanks again!",
