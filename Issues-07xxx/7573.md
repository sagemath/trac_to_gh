This crashes Sage:

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=True)
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: p.set_objective(sum([b[v] for v in g]))
sage: p.set_binary(b)
sage: p.solve(objective_only=True)
```

Depends on #7270 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hello !!!

This problem does not seem to exist on the version I am using, with patch #7270 and the new GLPK spkg installed... Did you test it on the current Sage version of both  ?

I just tested your patch and it seems Coin behaves much better than GLPK : the new doctests fails for solver="Coin", as it peacefully returns an exception as it should. Could you add in your test solver="GLPK" to the p.solve() call ?

It sounds like wrapping solveCoin with _sig_on and sig_off is not needed, though it can not hurt to let it stay ;-)

Thank you very much for your help !!!!
