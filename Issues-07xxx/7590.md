Given the sequence of degrees for set A and a sequence of degree for set B, create the corresponding bipartite graph if possible.

This patch uses #7301 and incidentally the packages GLPK ( or CBC, but this one is under review at the moment )

Well, I'd say this patch is ready for review (as it is written and functional) even though #7301 is not :-)

The discussion in #7301 could lead to a gale_ryser function which does not use GLPK  ( and may be even more efficient ), which is good for everybody :-)

As this function is not so fundamental to Sage, I see no harm in making it wait until #7301 is ready :-)
