Some comments:

1. The arguments for std and variance don't seem very user-friendly.  I think it would be much better to have "sample=True/False" or "population=True/False", or maybe something more general like numpy: "ddof=<number>" (delta degrees of freedom), where the denominator is n-ddof (so ddof=1 is sample, ddof=0 is population).

2. When calling the std or variance methods of the object, the population vs. sample distinction is ignored.

2. Why are these methods in a class?  They don't seem to use any benefits of a class; they just seem to be standalone functions.  It seems like it would make much more sense to me to have these methods be just functions inside of the module.  We can still import them into a namespace called "stats".

REFEREE REPORT:

0. All tests pass in the entire tree after applying this.

1. I'm OK with not adding std_sample and std_population simply because R, matlab, mathematica all don't and the instructor can easily add some alias's for their class. 

2. Add copyright header block.

3. Add a docstring section at the top with AUTHOR, overview of capabilities, etc. 

4. Don't import numpy at top level; it'll just get moved later since we should not import numpy/matplotlib/etc. at startup. 

5. For `def std(v, bias=False):` and any other function that handles special types, put in examples that illustrate that your code for handling these types works. 

Fix all the above and I'll be happy with this patch!

REPORT 2:

1. a little too spartan:

```
"""
Basic Statistics

This file contains basic descriptive functions.

AUTHOR:
    - Andrew Hou (11/06/2009)
...
"""
```

2. Make sure there is a test that tests this code:

```
    """
    if hasattr(v, 'mean'): return v.mean()
```

3. Same for mode:

```
    if hasattr(v, 'mode'): return v.mode()
```

4. Same for this:

```
    if hasattr(v, 'standard_deviation'): return v.standard_deviation(bias=bias)
```

5. Type checking in python should always use isinstance:

```
    if type(v) is numpy.ndarray:
    if type(v) == numpy.ndarray:
```
should be

```
     if isinstance(v, numpy.ndarray):
```

6. Test this:

```
    if hasattr(v, 'variance'): return v.variance(bias = bias)
```

7. Change this:

```
    if bias == True:
        # population variance
        if isinstance(x, (int,long)):
            return x/ZZ(len(v))
        return x/len(v)
    elif bias == False:
```
to

```
    if bias:
        # population variance
        if isinstance(x, (int,long)):
            return x/ZZ(len(v))
        return x/len(v)
    else:
```


8. Make sure this is tested:

```
    if hasattr(v, 'median'): return v.median()
```

9. Weird """ in moving_average:
{{{ 	318	                                                                                    """ 
 	319	    x = []    
}}}

10. Change

```
    bin_size = len(v)/bins     
```
to floor division:

```
    bin_size = int(len(v)//bins)
```

11. You can do this at the very end of each docstring if you want...
