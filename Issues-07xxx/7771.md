This nearly always happens after installing an R package and then following the directions Sage gives:

```
sage: r.restart()
Error: object 'sage0' not found
```
This seems to be unrelated to whether R has recommended packages installed or not, so I am making a new ticket for this.  Making it minor since just restarting Sage takes care of things as well.

As of Sage 4.3.2.alpha1, ticket #6532 upgrades R to version 2.10.1. From what I gather, after installing an R package, one needs to restart Sage:

```

It didn't say to use the command `r.restart()`. What about issuing `reset()` after installing an R package? It works for me:

```
sage: r.install_packages("igraph")

* DONE (igraph)

sage: r.library("igraph")
```
Perhaps you want the command `r.restart()` to achieve the same effect as `exit` and `reset()`? That is, one could install an R package with `r.install_packages("pkg-name")`, run `r.reset()`, and then load the newly installed package with `r.library("pkg-name")`? As a side note, one could not install R packages with a binary Sage distribution.

Yes, that is a change I made since r.restart() didn't work, but in the source it is commented that this *should* work.

Oh, that is bad.  I wonder why?  One can install optional spkgs in a binary install, correct?

Yikes!  Turns out that...

```
## <entry>
## Deprecated in 1.6.0
## Defunct in 1.7.0
machine <- function() .Defunct()
Machine <- function() .Defunct(".Machine")
Platform <- function() .Defunct(".Platform")
restart <- function() .Defunct("try")
## </entry>
```
Note that R is now at version 2.10.1!   So this is the problem here.  The restart() thing must be very old - and odd, since the function that replaced it was try (for exception handling.  Anyway, if reset() is good enough, that is fine - no need to do r.foo() if a normal Sage command does it well enough.  I'll work on a patch for this.

Attachment [trac_7771-reviewer.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket7771/trac_7771-reviewer.patch) by mvngu created at 2010-05-09 04:01:47

With the patch [trac_7771-r-restart.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/7771/trac_7771-r-restart.patch), I got the following failure when doctesting with "-t -long -optional":

```
Expected:
    R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
    You are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.
    Type 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.
    ...
    The R package 'aaMI' may now be loaded via r.library('aaMI').
    If this should not work, type reset(), or restart Sage.
Got:
    The R package 'aaMI' may now be loaded via r.library('aaMI').
    If this should not work, type reset(), or restart Sage.
```

It might be simpler to just test for the output:

```
The R package 'aaMI' may now be loaded via r.library('aaMI').
If this should not work, type reset(), or restart Sage.
```

I have attached a reviewer patch that does only that. With both patches, I now get the following failure:

```sh
[mvngu@sage sage-4.4.1]$ ./sage -t -long -optional devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/r.py 
sage -t -long -optional "devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/r.py"

```

But that is for another ticket. So only my patch needs reviewing by anyone but me.
