This nearly always happens after installing an R package and then following the directions Sage gives:

```
sage: r.restart()
Error: object 'sage0' not found
```
This seems to be unrelated to whether R has recommended packages installed or not, so I am making a new ticket for this.  Making it minor since just restarting Sage takes care of things as well.

As of Sage 4.3.2.alpha1, ticket #6532 upgrades R to version 2.10.1. From what I gather, after installing an R package, one needs to restart Sage:

```
[mvngu@mod sage-4.3.2.alpha1]$ ./sage

It didn't say to use the command `r.restart()`. What about issuing `reset()` after installing an R package? It works for me:

```
sage: r.install_packages("igraph")
<downloading-compiling-messages>
* DONE (igraph)

The downloaded packages are in
	‘/tmp/RtmpllHMEs/downloaded_packages’

sage: reset()
sage: r.library("igraph")
```
Perhaps you want the command `r.restart()` to achieve the same effect as `exit` and `reset()`? That is, one could install an R package with `r.install_packages("pkg-name")`, run `r.reset()`, and then load the newly installed package with `r.library("pkg-name")`? As a side note, one could not install R packages with a binary Sage distribution.

Yes, that is a change I made since r.restart() didn't work, but in the source it is commented that this *should* work.

Yikes!  Turns out that...

```

In fact, it's not even clear whether one needs to reset().  

```
Please restart Sage in order to use 'igraph'.
sage: r.library("igraph")
sage: a = r.graph_ring(10)
sage: a
Vertices: 10 
Edges: 10 
Directed: FALSE 
Edges:
          
[0] 0 -- 1
[1] 1 -- 2
[2] 2 -- 3
[3] 3 -- 4
[4] 4 -- 5
[5] 5 -- 6
[6] 6 -- 7
[7] 7 -- 8
[8] 8 -- 9
[9] 0 -- 9
sage: r.add_edges(a, (1,5,2,6) )
Vertices: 10 
Edges: 12 
Directed: FALSE 
Edges:
           
[0]  0 -- 1
[1]  1 -- 2
[2]  2 -- 3
[3]  3 -- 4
[4]  4 -- 5
[5]  5 -- 6
[6]  6 -- 7
[7]  7 -- 8
[8]  8 -- 9
[9]  0 -- 9
[10] 1 -- 5
[11] 2 -- 6
```
And this on an install which definitely hadn't had this package installed before.  The same happened with package 'aaMI'.  Which leads me to believe one doesn't even have to reset() - the package is just automatically available.  I'm going to put up a patch to that effect, with the covering statement to use reset() or restart Sage if you encounter problems.

With the patch [trac_7771-r-restart.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket7771/trac_7771-r-restart.patch.gz), I got the following failure when doctesting with "-t -long -optional":

```
Expected:
    R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
    You are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.
    Type 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.
    ...
    The R package 'aaMI' may now be loaded via r.library('aaMI').
    If this should not work, type reset(), or restart Sage.
Got:
    The R package 'aaMI' may now be loaded via r.library('aaMI').
    If this should not work, type reset(), or restart Sage.
```

It might be simpler to just test for the output:

```
The R package 'aaMI' may now be loaded via r.library('aaMI').
If this should not work, type reset(), or restart Sage.
```

I have attached a reviewer patch that does only that. With both patches, I now get the following failure:

```sh
[mvngu@sage sage-4.4.1]$ ./sage -t -long -optional devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/r.py

But that is for another ticket. So only my patch needs reviewing by anyone but me.
