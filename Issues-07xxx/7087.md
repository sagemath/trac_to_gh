The text around the offending doctest is talking about the number of results returned, so I changed the doctest to just test the number of results. I also added a new doctest that tests a sequence that should only ever return one result -- [the first bits of A137443](http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A137443) are quite unlikely to show up in another sequence.
