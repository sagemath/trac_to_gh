Finally, if SAGE64 is set and we're on DARWIN, is it worth making some of the other changes in [http://blog.hyperjeff.net/?p=160](http://blog.hyperjeff.net/?p=160)?  For example, in src/make.osx, changing

CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch ppc -I${PREFIX}/include -I${PREFIX}/include/freetype2 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk"

so that "-arch ppc" gets changed to "-arch x86_64"?  (That web page also suggests adding "FFLAGS", and making a few other changes.  We can defer these until later, also.)

As far as actual testing goes, on my OS X 10.6 machines:

- before the patch, if I delete the files in ~/.matplotlib, then `sage: plot(sin)` causes a crash.

- after the patch, if I delete the files in ~/.matplotlib, then `sage: plot(sin)` works fine.

- this is completely reproducible: if I force installation of the old matplotlib spkg, then the crashes come back, and then if I force installation of the new one, the crashes go away.

So positive review, modulo the comments made above.

Do we need to test on an OS X 10.5 machine?

It runs patches/osx10.6hack on any OS X, but *only* actually applies the hack on 10.6.  It immediately exits patches/osx10.6hack on other than 10.6. 

I've updated the spkg, and also now tested it on 10.5 and it works fine (as before).  So, can you change it to positive review?
