With Sage 4.3, building the PDF version of the reference manual hangs at the line:

```
! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.164972 $\mbox{min_bound} 
                           \leq \mbox{linear_function} \leq \mbox{max_bound}$
```
This is due to the docstring of the method `constraints()` in `sage/numerical/mip.pyx`. The attached patch should fix the docstring formatting and allow the PDF version of the reference manual to build successfully.

Without the patch, the PDF build crashes.  With the patch it succeeds.  Both the PDF and html versions look good with the patch.
