With Sage 4.3, building the PDF version of the reference manual hangs at the line:

```
! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.164972 $\mbox{min_bound} 
                           \leq \mbox{linear_function} \leq \mbox{max_bound}$
```
This is due to the docstring of the method `constraints()` in `sage/numerical/mip.pyx`. The attached patch should fix the docstring formatting and allow the PDF version of the reference manual to build successfully.
