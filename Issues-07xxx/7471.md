Excellent, thanks for tracking this down!   

Now, I wonder what idiot messed up Sage's mpir-1.2 spkg by not updating the patches properly?

[... checks SPKG.txt ...]

=== mpir-1.2 (William Stein, May 31, 2009) ===
 * Update to the latest MPIR 1.2 pre-release
 * Change "GMP" --> "MPIR" in various places.

Doh.

Thanks.   I can't work on this further until tonight because my internet connection is so horrible.

The new spkg is here: http://wstein.org/home/wstein/patches/mpir-1.2.2.spkg

All I did was put the latest vanilla spkg from http://mpir.org in the src directory.   There are no patches, so that's it.    I've not tested yet that this new spkg really solves the problem involving FAT binaries that started this ticket

Looks good to me.  Good work (to you and Jason Moxham) in tracking the confusing problem with Pari down.
