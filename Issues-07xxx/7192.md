The attachment `index.rst` is a translation of "A Tour of Sage" to Spanish. Based upon this attachment, one needs to create a patch under the directory `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/doc/es`.

Well, that's the folder where I grabbed the file from and then transformed it.
If it's in your plans to create a new folder ".../es/...", that would be great.

Sorry for the omission.

The Sage computer algebra system used to be called "SAGE", which is an acronym for Software for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation. That acronym has been abandoned. You should only use "Sage" to refer to the Sage mathematics software at 

http://www.sagemath.org

Using the capitalization "SAGE" would only confuse people.
