As of Sage 4.3, every time you make a clone or build an spkg, the whole documentation is also rebuilt. This is very annoying. See this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/f6d2c21372a7d1d7) message for the vote to move the docbuild commands to their own targets in the script `SAGE_ROOT/makefile`. Or at least make it so that creating a clone or rebuilding an spkg doesn't also trigger a rebuild of the documentation.

I think I object to the positive review here, because having complete documentation is an important part of Sage, but it looks like with these patches, building Sage from source will not build the documentation.  Correct me if I'm wrong about this.

At the very least, since this is a major change, this should discussed more thoroughly in sage-devel before doing this.

What happens if we add "doc" to the targets in the makefile for "make all"?

> Since the test targets in SAGE_ROOT/makefile do not depend on the doc targets, we may get reports about failed doctests in sage.misc.sagedoc

If you feel, as I do, that the documentation is an integral part of Sage, then it's reasonable that if you try doctesting with an incomplete Sage build (for example, if you're missing the documentation), you should not be surprised if there are doctest failures.  The failures do say "Warning, the following Sage documentation...", so it's more or less clear why they failed.

I apologize about the first versions.  I've attached an updated `makefile` and `makefile.diff`.  The target(s)

* `build` builds Sage but not the documentation.
* `all` depends on `build` and `doc`.
* `*test*` depend on `all`.

What are the circumstances under which [rebuilding just an spkg triggers a rebuild of the docs](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/2ed1823b567d6d26)?

No need to apologize: this is why patches are refereed.

I'm curious about this, too.  Maybe if you rebuild the spkg by deleting the appropriate file spkg/installed and then typing "make"?  With the new patch you could type "make build" instead, and it should build the spkg without rebuilding the docs.
