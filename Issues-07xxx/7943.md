As of Sage 4.3, every time you make a clone or build an spkg, the whole documentation is also rebuilt. This is very annoying. See this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/f6d2c21372a7d1d7) message for the vote to move the docbuild commands to their own targets in the script `SAGE_ROOT/makefile`. Or at least make it so that creating a clone or rebuilding an spkg doesn't also trigger a rebuild of the documentation.

Since the test targets in `SAGE_ROOT/makefile` do not depend on the doc targets, we may get reports about failed doctests in `sage.misc.sagedoc`:

```python
sage: len(search_doc('tree', interact=False).splitlines()) > 2000
sage: len(search_doc('tree', whole_word=True, interact=False).splitlines()) < 100
sage: 'abvar/homology' in _search_src_or_doc('doc', 'homology', 'variety', interact=False)
```
What if we make the first two `optional` and insert `or 'Warning, the following Sage documentation'` in the third?

I think I object to the positive review here, because having complete documentation is an important part of Sage, but it looks like with these patches, building Sage from source will not build the documentation.  Correct me if I'm wrong about this.

At the very least, since this is a major change, this should discussed more thoroughly in sage-devel before doing this.

What happens if we add "doc" to the targets in the makefile for "make all"?

If you feel, as I do, that the documentation is an integral part of Sage, then it's reasonable that if you try doctesting with an incomplete Sage build (for example, if you're missing the documentation), you should not be surprised if there are doctest failures.  The failures do say "Warning, the following Sage documentation...", so it's more or less clear why they failed.
