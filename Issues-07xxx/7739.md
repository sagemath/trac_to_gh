Look basically good.  Robert, do you want to add the test for a=0 or b=0 or a=-b in the complex_double case, and also perhaps a=0 or b=0 for the real cases?

There's a typo (sgm for agm) in the docstring (line 1944 of complex_double).  I edited the patch to fix that.

Otherwise I'm quite happy -- applies to 4.3 and tests in sage/rings/{real,complex}* all pass.  So: positive review!
