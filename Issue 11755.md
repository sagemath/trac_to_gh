graphs() has an option deg_seq, which is not a pretty name (a newbie can easily miss its meaning), and moreover is the only abbreviated option. 
Let us call it degree_sequence, and depreciate deg_seq.

(by the way, if sombody here plays with degree sequences, I wrote a long patch about them at #11584. I don't remember whether I advertised that one much `:-D`)

positive review -- this is a minor change, and cleanly implemented, too.

Usually, if all you did was an obvious rebase, then you can set back positive_review yourself.
