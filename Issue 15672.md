# Issue 15672: Spurious gap processes when running tests

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: aschilling

Original creation time: 2014-03-08 03:05:05

CC:  mkoeppe slelievre

Keywords: gap, doctests

When I run tests, I often remain with spurious gap processes in the background. For example running

```
sage -t /src/sage/combinat/root_system/coxeter_group.py
```

I end up with

```
84121- gap          98.0  07:30.09 1/1  0    14   30     155M   240K   156M   266M   1099M  84121 1     running  501  40753
```

There have been several GAP updates in the meantime so
it seems reasonable to close.

Reopen if this can still be observed.
