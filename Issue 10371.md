A common situation for augmenting a matrix is when a beginning student might augment a coefficient matrix with a single (column) vector, and then analyze the reduced row echelon form to uncover the nature of the solution set.  Right now the vector needs to be converted by hand into a matrix with a single column (not trivial for a beginner).

This patch makes this possible easily.  In detail, it:

1. Demotes the current `augment()` method to a helper method (so that its optimized functionality is unchanged).

2. Makes a new `augment()` method.  Its main purpose is to allow for either a matrix or a vector as input, and then error-check and/or sanitize the input for the helper function.

3. Documentation has improved, as written up on the new method, which is what a user will see.

This work suggests two further possible improvements.

1. Add an option to subdivide the augmented matrix.  An upcoming patch will do this (and for `stack()` as well).

2. Coerce to a common parent, rather than coercing the elements of the `other` matrix into the base ring of `self`.

The current augment doesn't really have any optimized functionality, so I think it'd make more sense to put this all into a single function. Just do

    cdef Matrix other

and name the original input to be something else.

Yes, I was wrestling with the `cdef` for `other` and didn't want to slow down any of the optimized stuff there.  It would be better to make this all one function.  So I'll take your hint and try to make it happen.

I did notice that matrix row operations are implemented in two parts (a pure python routine and a Cython routine), but maybe that is because the Cython part gets used twice typically.

Thanks for the assist and I'll get back to this soon.

That would be easy to implement, but then we would need people to suddenly **not** put ticket numbers themselves in the commit message.  The best solution would be to add another "header" field, so the top of a patch file would look like

```
# HG changeset patch
# User Rob Beezer <beezer@ups.edu>
# Date 1291401373 28800
# Node ID f1dfd7d6d7fcea5f8473979c4052824b2a8579f1
# Parent  f843fff860efc5c791da4d8f7d85d434ba057de9
# Ticket 10242
10424: augmentation of matrix augment method
```


But can hg cope with this and can we grep for it?

Why? Wouldn't it be easier to have a script that prepends the ticket number if it isn't already in the description?

I don't know, but it wouldn't show up in the shortlogs, so better to have it in the first line of the description. 

In any case, there should be IMHO a different setting than "needs work" for trivial issues like this.
