`devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/coercion_and_categories.rst` mixes TABs and spaces for indentation, which is very bad style and might also lead to doctesting trouble.

How to replace tabs by four blank spaces (in linux or vim)? Perhaps you can answer faster than I can look up in google...

OK, you were faster. I found `sed 's/\\t/    /g' oldcode.py >newcode.py` in google...

Good. After applying the patch, I could not find any tab space in the code. Since the patch does not change the actual text, since the documentation built w/o trouble, and since the result looks fine in the browser, I give it a positive review.
