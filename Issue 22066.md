Slight modification, in a hope to make (semi)automatic processing a little easier. Contain also two `SEE ALSO` -> `SEEALSO`.

Was this done with a script?

- I found one more "EXAMPLE::", line 130 of src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/interact.py

- There are a lot of instances of "EXAMPLE:" (single colon). Should those also be changed?

> Was this done with a script?

Yes, `find . -name ... | xargs perl -e 's|...|...|g;' -p -i.bak`.

Most have happened after last beta. I'll check.

> - There are a lot of instances of "EXAMPLE:" (single colon). Should those also be changed?

Hmmm... yes. Of course, as they are also kind of block markers.

I did the changes, now compiling and testing.

For example `GF2XHexOutput` at `src/sage/libs/ntl/ntl_GF2X.pyx` has an error also. I will look at those later.
