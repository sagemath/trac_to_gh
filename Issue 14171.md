What I'm trying to say is that the current string version of the doctesting framework might see byte strings encoded as UTF-8, even when not using the `unicode` type. Remember that Sage uses UTF-8 encoded source files, so any strings defined in doctests will be encoded as UTF-8.

Put it a different way: imagine we see a `\x9b` in doctest output, which is more likely:
1. It is part of a UTF-8 sequence.
2. It is a CSI code in a different encoding.

I would say the first is more likely.

Replying to [comment:22 jdemeyer]:
> "We" already partially switched to UTF-8: Sage source files are UTF-8 and some terminals (more and more these days) use UTF-8 encoding by default.

The terminal has no say in doctesting. The "want" is UTF-8 (or at least comes from the UTF-8 encoded sage source), but the "got" is whatever byte string was printed by the worker.

Volker, I confirm the utf8 problem, but that's for a different ticket (I don't know enough about `TeX` to review that): #14571.

I fixed the problem on this ticket by simply using a `r"""` string instead of `"""`. Needs review.
