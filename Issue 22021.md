I'm slightly worried about the `richcmp(left.__prec, right.__prec, op)` doing more precise comparisons than before and would cause a subtle behavior change. Nor am I not completely convinced the doctests cover all the behavior. I won't have time today to add such tests and verify, but I will try to get to this tomorrow (unless someone who is more familiar with interval comparisons verifies this is okay).

In this case, the behaviour looks meaningful so it's a change in the good sense.
