Issue created by migration from Trac.

The method `_coerce_c_impl` is typically used for coercion method of the old coercion model. Now `BooleanPolynomialRing` uses the new coercion model but it still has a `_coerce_c_impl` method which is used internally. To avoid confusion, we just rename this method.
