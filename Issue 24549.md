I haven't looked closely at this code yet, but presumably in Python 2 `OrderCode` is an old-style class which allowed assignment to their `__dict__` attributes, whereas new-style classes do not allow this.  Whatever it's trying to accomplish by assigning to `__dict__` can surely be done another way.

Erik, could you please post on sage-devel some kind of report of your progress on python3 ? In particular, I would like to know how far we still are 

(0) from sage starting (almost there, I think it may just need #24728),

(1) from being able to build the doc (#24774 and then ?),

(2) from having a functional doctest framework (#24343 and what else ?).

And what are the involved tickets for each of these objectives ? I must say that I am a bit lost in your recent flurry of activity. I would like to put some priority between all these tickets.

That's fair--I've been thinking about that myself.  I almost feel like we need some kind of status board for Python 3.  I'll see what I can come up with.

As for the "recent flurry of activity" almost all of this is work I did some time ago but never got around to organizing into comprehensible discrete tickets.  Most of it is miscellaneous and not directly tied to each other (I will usually make clear when multiple tickets are related to each other).

Here are the lines in https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/blob/master/sage-brial/brial/PyPolyBoRi.py

```
class OrderCode:
    pass

OrderCode.__dict__ = order_dict
OrderCode.__module__ = __name__
```

There is a newer version of brial but if there is still bugs I am happy to merge PR.


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-04-23 13:41:33

Changing status from new to needs_review.


---

Comment by saraedum created at 2018-04-30 16:05:58

This says "needs review". What should be reviewed here?


---

Comment by saraedum created at 2018-04-30 16:05:58

Changing status from needs_review to needs_info.

Comment by embray created at 2018-04-30 17:59:15

The PR to brial did need review, but this is done now.  

What we need to do now is either add this patch to Sage, or release a new version of brial and update Sage to use it (preferably the latter).  But let's wait to see if I can identify any more Python 3 bugs in brial (I don't think there are but it's feasible).


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2018-04-30 21:05:53

I can release a new brial when you think it is ready. The main reason I have that power on the brial repo is to be able to do releases for sage in a timely fashion. Although I also did quite a bit of clean up with the help of other sage-on-distro maintainers in the last few months.

`@`fbissey

Please make a release of brial. This will be helpful for python3 progress.

I may have time tomorrow but that will be a squeeze. Better count on it on Tuesday (NZ time).

New release out for you at https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/releases/download/1.2.4/brial-1.2.4.tar.bz2

Do check that it has all the changes you need.

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-06-19 12:25:40

now we need to update brial here


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-06-20 08:26:18

Are you saying I should make a branch to upgrade Sage's brial to this version?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-06-20 09:02:19

Hello Erik, and welcome back.

Well, I think we should upgrade brial, indeed. Either here or in another ticket.

Maybe Pynac upgrade is more important than this one for being able to make the doc.


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-06-20 09:32:00

Thanks!

And yes, IIRC the pynac updates are especially critical for Python 3 support (otherwise there are segfaults, etc.)


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-06-20 09:32:15

I can put the brial update in this ticket.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-07-04 12:46:12

`@`embray : yes, please, let us do the brial update here

patches do not apply.. And I am not able to do the required refreshing of patches, sorry

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. New commits:

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-07-12 10:03:11

turns out the patch was no longer needed. So this should be good now

Comment by chapoton created at 2018-07-12 10:05:42

well, seems to work after `sage -f brial`

so setting back to needs review.

I was a bit surprised and was going to ask for more details.

LGTM.  Jeroen should probably comment since he wrote the patch.

Why? The patch was from a pull request he made to BRiAl and which I have merged. So the patch is included in this version of BRiAl.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Comment by embray created at 2018-07-13 10:26:15

Ok. That wasn't immediately obvious.  It looks like my PR is included as well.

I believe this issue can reasonably be addressed for Sage 8.4.
