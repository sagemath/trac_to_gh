I haven't looked closely at this code yet, but presumably in Python 2 `OrderCode` is an old-style class which allowed assignment to their `__dict__` attributes, whereas new-style classes do not allow this.  Whatever it's trying to accomplish by assigning to `__dict__` can surely be done another way.

Erik, could you please post on sage-devel some kind of report of your progress on python3 ? In particular, I would like to know how far we still are 

(0) from sage starting (almost there, I think it may just need #24728),

(1) from being able to build the doc (#24774 and then ?),

(2) from having a functional doctest framework (#24343 and what else ?).

And what are the involved tickets for each of these objectives ? I must say that I am a bit lost in your recent flurry of activity. I would like to put some priority between all these tickets.
