I felt it might be important to make sure these functions were working properly, as some of Sage's metaprogramming and related tests rely on reliable introspection.

A number of the tests in this module only made sense on Python 2 due to minor syntactic differences or similar minor differences between the languages; in some cases I provided Python 3 alternatives, in other cases the test is just run on Python 2.  In still other cases I changed the test slightly to work on both, where I felt that it didn't impact the validity of the test.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24312

Speaking of which, it turns out that change *was* relevant to this ticket, because one of the tests in sageinspect uses `TestNestedParent` from that module.  The only reason I can tell that its even in a separate module is that it's related to testing `sage_getsource`.

```
class NewStyle(...):

which occurs a lot in Sage. It's not obvious to me why it doesn't matter if `Element` is a new-style or old-style class.

In this case the *only* reason was because there was some part of the test that checked the repr of the nested class, and new-style and old-style classes have different reprs :(

Alternatively I could add a fixup for this to the doctest parser as I've done in other cases.  This isn't the only example I've found like this.  It's usually just simpler to convert to a new-style class except in the miniscule number cases where that has an impact on what's being tested.

Just to clarify, let me elaborate on that. I am not specifically keen on old-style classes per se. In fact, if there would be an easy way to "configure" Python so that

```
    class A:
        ...
```

would always create a new style class, that would be very fine.

On the other hand, we have quite some of code in Sage *and* outside of Sage (in packages or users private code) that use the idiom:

```
    class A(...):
        class Element:
            ...
```


It would not be a practical to have to change this everywhere to

```
    class A(...):
        class Element(object):
            ...
```

when anyway that won't be needed anymore with Python 3.

Cheers,

`inspect.getargspec` is not used in any of the code, only in some of the doctests  The reason to keep it is that the output of `sage_getargspec` is the same as the output of `inspect.getargspec` and this tests that that is the case.

The only alternative would be to change `sage_getargspec` to be equivalent to `inspect.getfullargspec` which has no equivalent on Python 2, and then have separate tests for Python 2 and 3.  I'd be okay with that, but it's a slightly larger change.
