Keywords: list FiniteEnumeratedSet cache

There are two way to get the list of the elements of a `FiniteEnumeratedSet`:

```
     list(FSet)
     FSet.list()
```

The first case uses `FSet.__iter__` which is slow in many practical case, for example because of deep `yield` recursion...

After a discussion with Nicolas, We decided the following: In the second case, we assume that there is a need for speed and therefore we take chance to cache the list.
