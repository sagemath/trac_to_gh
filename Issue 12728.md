The Demazure roots (often just called roots) of a toric variety give you the non-Abelian part of the continuous automorphisms.

Doesn't use anything from #12892, but otherwise this ticket applies with fuzz.

Should there perhaps be a check that the variety is complete? Also would be nice to have a direct link to arXiv.

For incomplete varieties it would already bomb out because it can't enumerate the points in the (non-compact) dual polytope. But its better to have an explicit check with meaningful error message. Also fixed the typesetting of the doctest.

I've updated the paths for #13023, and checked that all doctests pass.

looks good to me.

I propose to remove the dependency to #12892, which is not really needed.

If you agree, you can remove the dependency and set a positive review.

This patch conflicts with #14891. One should be rebased on top of the other.

ok, I have made this ticket depend on #14891 

I have rebased my review patch, but there remains a hunk in the original patch.
