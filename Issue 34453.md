CC:  @matteocati

With #32267 done, the next not yet implemented construction is for n=116. This was originally constructed by Williamson, 
cf e.g. Marshall Hall's book https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118032862

Implementing Williamson construction would be a natiral way here.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34690

OK, good.

The 1st and 2nd smallest value for which we don't have an implementation. 
are now 156 and 188.

156 was first constructed in https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society/volume-71/issue-1/A-new-construction-for-Hadamard-matrices/bams/1183526410.full 

236 is the 3rd.
Here seems to be the reference on the 1st construction of Hadamard matrices of order 236: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316574900569

For 188 there is https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0640.pdf - but most probably it's not the 1st such a construction.

Do we always mean return a normalised Hadamard matrix?

Note that `hadamard_matrix(116)` fails, as there is a default `check` 

```
    if check:
        assert is_hadamard_matrix(M, normalized=True)
```

which is done with `normalized=True` - which is not the case here.

This error was already present in #32267, so I fixed it in that ticket and then rebased this one.
