# Issue 34453: implement more constructions for Hadamard matrices, e.g. for size 116

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34690

Original creator: dimpase

Original creation time: 2022-10-24 08:12:10

CC:  @matteocati

With #32267 done, the next not yet implemented construction is for n=116. This was originally constructed by Williamson, 
cf e.g. Marshall Hall's book https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118032862

Implementing Williamson construction would be a natiral way here.

Added Williamson construction, together with data for creating hadamard matrices of order 116 and 172 using this construction.

OK, good.

The 1st and 2nd smallest value for which we don't have an implementation. 
are now 156 and 188.

156 was first constructed in https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society/volume-71/issue-1/A-new-construction-for-Hadamard-matrices/bams/1183526410.full 

236 is the 3rd.
Here seems to be the reference on the 1st construction of Hadamard matrices of order 236: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316574900569

For 188 there is https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0640.pdf - but most probably it's not the 1st such a construction.

Do we always mean return a normalised Hadamard matrix?

Note that `hadamard_matrix(116)` fails, as there is a default `check` 

```
    if check:
        assert is_hadamard_matrix(M, normalized=True)
```

which is done with `normalized=True` - which is not the case here.

Please also check whether new matrices at #32267 work with `hadamard_matrix()`, i.e. we had this regression already...

This error was already present in #32267, so I fixed it in that ticket and then rebased this one.

Added Turyn construction for matrix of order 236.
For order 188 I believe the first construction is the one described in: https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1956&context=infopapers

This can be used to construct a few other matrices with the T-sequences given in http://mathscinet.ru/files/OD4t.pdf

The next construction that can be implemented is the one described in https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82189436.pdf, which will give new Hadamard matrices for many different orders (including 292, which is the smallest value currently missing).

OK, great. For comment:33 constructions, please open a follow-up ticket. 

How far will we be from 668 (the 1st 4k for which existence of a matrix is unknown) then?

After implementing the construction in comment:33 the missing orders will be 412, 428, 452, 476, 508, 532, 604, 612, 652 but it should be possible to implement all of them just by adding more data (T-sequence and williamson type matrices) to the constructions that are already present.

Could you replace `sets` in `...-sequences are sets of four (-1, 0, 1) sequences` (2 times) in `combinat/t_sequences.py` with `tuples` ? (At least in the 2nd case it's obvious that each of the 4 -1,0,1-sequences plays a distinct role, so they can't be just be swapped arbitrarily.
