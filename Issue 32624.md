Does this make the line mentioning `memory-allocator` in https://wiki.sagemath.org/Conda not needed?

Yes, after this ticket is merged

`@`isuruf, do you (plan to) ship the `sage-setup` package in conda as well? Then this would also need `distros/conda.txt`

No, we don't currently ship it. `sage-setup` version is dependent on the sage version, so it's better to not add it to `distros/conda.txt`.

Should we add the pip dependencies (pkgs/sage-conf, pkgs/sage-setup) in `src/environment.yml` then?
