As reported [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/FRKhjYnOn3k/xsQ6IiDvBAAJ); running the following in a loop leads to memory growth. 

```
def get_polytope(M):
    q = MixedIntegerLinearProgram( maximization = False, solver = 'Coin' )
    w = q.new_variable(real = True, nonnegative = True)
    for v in M.rows():
        q.add_constraint( dot_prod(v, w) == 0 )
    return None
```

This appears to be `coin`-specific.
