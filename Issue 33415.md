# Issue 33415: Left eigenvectors for CBF

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33652

Keywords: ComplexBallField

When computing left eigenvectors for ComplexBallField matrices, sage raises a not implemented error, whereas right eigenvectors are working.

Example :


```
M = random_matrix(CBF,2,2)
print(M.eigenvectors_right())
print(M.eigenvectors_left())

NotImplementedError: eigenspaces cannot be computed reliably for inexact rings such as Complex ball field with 256 bits of precision,
consult numerical or symbolic matrix classes for other options
```

The problem is that in the generic code (`matrix2.pyx`) it is implemented the other way around : there is a default implementation for `eigenvectors_left` and `eigenvectors_right` calls `eigenvectors_left` with the transposed matrix.

Lgtm except for one occurrence of `eigenvectors_right_approx` that should be `eigenvectors_left_approx`` in the doc of ``eigenvectors_left``.

Thanks for having a look. Indeed I was not very careful when copying the doc.

Patchbot says:

It should be `Return` with no s.

Other issues on the patchbot seems unrelated to this branch. Only the issue with `blocks` remain.
