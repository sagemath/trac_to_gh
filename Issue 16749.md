The cases of number fields and finite fields work fine, but many other fields fail. Also there are some issues in the documentation:

- The descriptions of both functions reference QQ only
- The description of all_rational_preimages reference parallel (which it is not)
- The text is after the :: in examples so is not formatted correctly
- number field is 2 words and not capitalized

For functionality: here are some examples which fail. They fail in at least 3 distinct ways.


```
R.<t>=FunctionField(QQ)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(R,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2-y^2,y^2])
f.rational_preimages(P([0,1]))
```



```
R.<t>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(FractionField(R),1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2-y^2,y^2])
f.rational_preimages(P([0,1]))
```



```
R.<t>=PolynomialRing(QuadraticField(2))
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(FractionField(R),1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2-y^2,y^2])
f.rational_preimages(P([0,1]))
```



```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(Qp(3),1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2-y^2,y^2])
f.rational_preimages(P([0,1]))
```



```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(CC,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2-y^2,y^2])
f.rational_preimages(P([0,1]))
```

}
```

The code snippents above are resolved now, but here are a couple more issues:

- the docs are still wrong see comment 4 above

- for subschemes the points being returned are in the ambient space and not the subscheme

- the following two examples fail


```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(CC,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2-2*y^2,y^2])
f.rational_preimages(P([0,1]))
```

The previous example also fails for RR


```
z = var('z')
K.<w>=NumberField(z^3+2)
R.<z>=PolynomialRing(K)
L.<v>=K.extension(z^2+z+1)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(L,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^3-2*y^3,v*y^3])
f.rational_preimages(P([0,1]))
```
