# Issue 19117: Minor typos in 6.9

Issue created by migration from Trac.

CC:  darij

This is a container ticket for minor documentation typos found in version 6.9, to be fixed for 6.10. I'll add them here, if I am not doing another ticket for same part of Sage. Of course others can also make additions to this.

- Someone can count only to two: `generic_graph.py`, `edge_cut` says "There are currently two different implementations - -" and then lists three.

Darij: Can you confirm that in `frank_network()` "for each p and q in P such that x≥y, an edge from (0,p) to (1,q)." should be "for each p and q in P such that p≥q, an edge from (0,p) to (1,q)."

Confirmed. Good catch!

Frédéric, how we know when 6.10 is going out, i.e. when to close this?

Please correct the last topic, so that we can close this ticket now, and open a new one. No need to wait for 6.10.

As you wish. But I guess I won't review this until monday.

Example of `graphs()` is kind of artificial. But better examples take more time, and maybe are not better for showing how to use this.

ok, looks good to me now. Jori, please double check and set to positive review if you agree

- A 3-tuple ` (`g`, ``rw``, ``signs``) ` misses a pair of ` around g.

- is_directed_acyclic on digraph.py, still too much indentation on output, see part "When certificate=True".

Otherwise I found no problems.

No, this is written ``g`` in the whole doc of the function, let us rather keep that.

> - is_directed_acyclic on digraph.py, still too much indentation on output, see part "When certificate=True".

I do not understand. How much indentation do you want ? 0 ?

OK.

There is


```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

            * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
              where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
              appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```


and I think that it should be


```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

          * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
            where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
            appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```


I.e. 2 spaces less, and so one level less in indentation.

Almost forgot. I put Frédéric also as reviewer, as he read my example on `graphs()` iterator.

On `is_directed_acyclic()` at `digraph.py` I changed "When ``certificate=True`` :" to "When ``certificate=True``:", i.e. removed a space. Now this merges.
