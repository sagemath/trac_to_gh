This is a container ticket for minor documentation typos found in version 6.9, to be fixed for 6.10. I'll add them here, if I am not doing another ticket for same part of Sage. Of course others can also make additions to this.

- Someone can count only to two: `generic_graph.py`, `edge_cut` says "There are currently two different implementations - -" and then lists three.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19354

No, this is written ``g`` in the whole doc of the function, let us rather keep that.

I do not understand. How much indentation do you want ? 0 ?

OK.

There is


```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

            * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
              where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
              appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```


and I think that it should be


```
        * When ``certificate=True``:

          * If the graph is acyclic, returns a pair ``(True, ordering)``
            where ``ordering`` is a list of the vertices such that ``u``
            appears before ``v`` in ``ordering`` if ``u, v`` is an edge.
```


I.e. 2 spaces less, and so one level less in indentation.
