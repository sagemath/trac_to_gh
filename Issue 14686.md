Logarithms seem to evaluate numbers differently, depending on type. This causes some precision errors when using numbers which can be coerced into integers. For example, if we use integers and evaluate something of the form log_b(b^k) the answer is what it should be:


```
sage: log(3^5,3)==5
True
```


However, if we use reals which can be coerced into integers, the answer is rounded and slightly off:


```
sage: log(3.0^5,3.0)==5
False
```


This problem doesn't always happen, for example if we replace the 5 with 12:


```
sage: log(3.0^12,3.0)==12
True
```


This only seems to be happening for some exponents; in base 3, we found that this sort of expression evaluates to False for exponents equal to 5, 13 and 17, but it does not happen for numbers in between.

Sage is not the place to implement this. If you really need this, it should be implemented in MPFR, then Sage can interface it.

Close as "wontfix".
