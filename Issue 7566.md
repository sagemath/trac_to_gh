From Bernhard Esslinger:

```
I also would like to have a verbose mode for brute_force(), which also prints the statistical values like chi square (to check and make comparisons easy) 
```

Possibilities for the keyword `verbose` include:

 1. print the rank number of a candidate decipherment
 1. print the statistical value of a candidate decipherment
