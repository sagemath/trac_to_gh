The attached picture shows how many modules (horizontal) you can run in how many CPU minutes (vertical). So, for example, in 40 CPU minutes (i.e., 10 wall minutes on my laptop) I can run all the doctests in 80% of all Sage modules. In 4 CPU minutes, I can doctest 50% of all Sage modules.

It would be nice to add a `--limit=40:00` switch (or similar) to run doctests in each module for at most the corresponding fraction of time (I still have to try whether it's better to do the accounting by module or by line of doctest.)

In any case, this would give us a quick way to check that a change did not break things too terribly. For example, when I work on p-adics, I would probably do: `sage -tp --long --limit=4:00 src/sage/rings/padics` frequently. Once I am happy with my changes, I could do `sage -tp --limit=4:00 src/sage/rings` and a final `sage -tp --limit=40:00 src` before I leave the rest to the patchbot.

I have a first prototype now. If I set it to try to finish in 30s walltime and run on `src/sage/rings/padics`, it does skip tests in only 4 files (here reported as failures at the moment):

```
sage -t ../rings/padics/padic_base_leaves.py  # 125 doctests failed
sage -t ../rings/padics/padic_lattice_element.py  # 303 doctests failed
sage -t ../rings/padics/padic_extension_leaves.py  # 72 doctests failed
sage -t ../rings/padics/padic_generic_element.pyx  # 172 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 35.8 seconds
```


As an extreme example, if let it test everything in `src/` in two minutes, it manages to finish within four minutes (because it does not actually abort any doctest line once it started) and runs 314607 docstring lines and skips 361692, so it skips roughly 50%.

I think it's a legitimate regression, unlike my earlier guess.  The failure is here:


```
        The only-errors mode does not output anything on success::

            sage: DD = DocTestDefaults(only_errors=True)
            sage: FDS = FileDocTestSource(filename, DD)
            sage: DC = DocTestController(DD, [filename])
            sage: DTR = DocTestReporter(DC)
            sage: doctests, extras = FDS.create_doctests(globals())
            sage: runner = SageDocTestRunner(SageOutputChecker(), verbose=False, sage_options=DD, optionflags=doctest.NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE|doctest.ELLIPSIS)
            sage: Timer().start().stop().annotate(runner)
            sage: D = DictAsObject({'err':None})
            sage: runner.update_results(D)
            0
            sage: DTR.report(FDS, False, 0, (sum([len(t.examples) for t in doctests]), D), "Good tests")

        However, failures are still output in the errors-only mode::

            sage: runner.failures = 1
            sage: runner.update_results(D)
            1
            sage: DTR.report(FDS, False, 0, (sum([len(t.examples) for t in doctests]), D), "Failed test")
                [... tests, 1 failure, ... s]

```


The intent of the test is that nothing should be output by `DocTestRunner.report` if it's in "only-errors mode" (a thing I didn't know existed), and there are no failures.

I guess this happens when the tests in `atexit` are only run partially and maybe some cleanup that is part of the doctests did not happen.

Since you're listed as the author of that file, any clue what's going on here?
