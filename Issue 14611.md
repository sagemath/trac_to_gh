the documentation of small_roots says:

```
   Let N be the characteristic of the base ring this polynomial is
   defined over: "N = self.base_ring().characteristic()". This method
   returns small roots of this polynomial modulo some factor b of N
   with the constraint that b >= N^beta. Small in this context means
   that if x is a root of f modulo b then |x| < X. This X is either
   provided by the user or the maximum X is chosen such that this
   algorithm terminates in polynomial time. If X is chosen
   automatically it is X = ceil(1/2 N^{beta^2/delta - epsilon}).
```

However the parameter `delta` is not defined.
Looking at the source code it seems it is the degree of the input polynomial,
but this should be confirmed and documented.

Robert, since you are the only author of `polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.pyx`, I add you in cc.
Please can you confirm that `delta` is the degree of the input polynomial?
