CC:  fbissey embray jdemeyer mkoeppe

It is not uncommon for pip package names to have `-` in the name, e.g. `sphinxcontrib-websupport` that popped up on #14645.
However, currently there is no way to have Sage package of type `pip`
that would be the equivalent of the explicit call

```
./sage --pip install sphinxcontrib-websupport
```

as `-` is not allowed in Sage package names, at least
an attempt to specify `sphinxcontrib-websupport` in a Sage package
dependencies produces an error.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23764

**this** is an ability to specify the (external) pip package name which is not equal to the Sage package name of type pip. Such an ability would allow handling `-` in the (external) pip package names.

But I have no idea where things dealing with packages of type `pip` are handled in the build system and how - thus I ask for some pointers to the latter.

The problem is that `-` is used as a version separator. So `sphinxcontrib-websupport` would be understood as package `sphinxcontrib`, version `websupport`. And given that projects put all kinds of strange things in their version numbers, we cannot know that `websupport` is *not* a version number.

I think the point is that the "pip" package type could be considered bad, and better not used for new packages.  Perhaps this should be made official.

We still can, say, parse `ls SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/` for the list of package names, which could have `-` in them, and then build a list of pairs (package_name,package_version) by looking at `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/<package_name>/package-version.txt`.

There is also not much point in keeping wishlist tickets open that nobody is ever going to work on. If you really want to fix this, you can always reopen the ticket or create a new one.
