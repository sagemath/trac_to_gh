lc, lm, and lt are defined for multivariate polynomial rings but not defined for univariate polynomial rings.

The method  `coefficient` doesn't make much sense for univariate polynomials. One would rather use `monomial_coefficient`.

Docstring of `gradient` should be clarified -- there's only 1 partial derivative.
Docstring of `lm` is wrong.

This looks good to me. But since the new method`lc` is now a duplicate of `leading_coefficient` in univariate polynomial rings (to be compatible with multivariate polynomial rings' method `lc`, I'm wondering if:
 - `leading_coefficient` should be deprecated or
 - also the alias `leading_coefficient` should be supplied for the multivariate case.
