Spent a lifetime on that because I had not noticed that I was first enumerating elements using a list L, then enumerating the same elements using `{x:i for i,x in enumerate(L)}`. And of course that was not the same ordering `T_T`

If you want to add columns instead it becomes a mess, you have to extend each column instead of just adding a row to the matrix.

By the way, many cals to `OA_from_quasi_difference_matrix` are already preceded by a `M=zip(*M) # transpose M`. Actually, I am looking at database.py and really a LOT of code would be simplified by changing that: look how often you have code like that to create the matrices:


```
for <something>:
    M[0].append(e)
    M[1].append(f)
    ....
```


If all that was the transpose instead, we would just have to write:


```
for <something>:
    M.append([e,f,...])
```


What do you think ?

Hello,

1) Why do you transpose the matrix to check the definition? You would avoid many multiplications in `x_minus_y[M_c[ii*K+i]][M_c[ii*K+j]]`.

2) I do not like the order of the argument. For orthogonal arrays it is OA, k, n, but here it is G, k, M... I would prefer G,M,k.

3) We can win a lot of time with a C array for `x_minus_y` and `seen_values`. It is at `u/vdelecroix/16797`

Yo !

> 1) Why do you transpose the matrix to check the definition?

When we will change the definition to have k columns instead of k rows we will just have to remove the block of lines before the transposition.

> You would avoid many multiplications in `x_minus_y[M_c[ii*K+i]][M_c[ii*K+j]]`.

I am not sure that we pay these multiplications. Because of your experience with `is_sum_of_square` and my useless optimization in `is_orthogonal_array`

Hmmm... The way you manage memory, you don't free any of the x_minus_y if there is a problem during the allocation of G_seen. By the way you could spare yourself a loop of alloc/free if you do not allow a vector of length G_card for each entry of x_minus_y but rather alloc a big table of size `G_card**2` and then let `int ** x_minus_y` point toward parts of it.

I don't know. For difference family it is `D,G` and not `G,D`.
