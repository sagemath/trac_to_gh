This works for me when building Sage and when upgrading `sagelib` from 9.3.beta6 to 9.3.beta7, or from building the develop branch to building this one. What else should I test?

I've used it for a while now, I wouldn't know what else to test either.

The title shows that the ticket is very specific, are there other tickets I have missed for:
 * setup.py
 * sage/misc/cython.py
 * sage/env.py
 * documentation mentioning distutils specifically
