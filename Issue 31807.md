# Issue 31807: build/pkgs/compilerwrapper: Remove

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32044

Looking at https://bitbucket.org/vbraun/compilerwrapper/src/master/ (no changes since 2013), it is likely that our `compilerwrapper` package (marked "experimental") is not needed any more.

This ticket removes it.
