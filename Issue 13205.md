# Issue 13205: Remove dead code from gen.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13377

Original creator: nbruin

Original creation time: 2012-08-17 19:09:36

Assignee: was

Keywords: easy, beginner

I get two complaints about unreachable code in `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx` for `toGEN` (line 9197 after #12215) and `_coerce_c_impl` (line 9670 after #12215) and the compiler is correct if I read the code correctly. The edits causing this both are from the pre-trac ticket era (2007 and 2006 respectively)

Changing keywords from "easy, beginner" to "easy, beginner, sd51".

The description mentions two blocks to be removed but the patch only removes one.  Why?

Ah, forgot to mention that the other block has already disappeared.  You can see this by (a) looking at what happens when you apply the patch and rebuild sage--there are no other warnings about unreachable code; and/or (b) reading the very short function `_coerce_c_impl` and seeing that there are no issues.
