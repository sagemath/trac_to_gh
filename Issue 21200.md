Maybe it isn't strange after all. It is about a random test. The values I provide in the test are what I get when I start a fresh Sage session, but probably I forgot that the random seed in doctests is different.

And which part of `src/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pyx` calls a meataxe executable?

You could set them in `sage-env` where many similar variables are handled.

My modular group cohomology package does. It was made dysfunctional by changes in Sage, and my long-standing plan is to turn it into a new style package.

It seems that I forgot to import a couple of things: sig_malloc, sig_free.

Currently I am using sig_malloc and sig_free, but check_realloc.

                        FfStepPtr(&(x))
                sig_off()
```

Somewhere I was reading that sig_on/sig_off should be used if there are potentially long c commands, whereas in the code above (only very short commands are executed in tight loops) one should use sig_check.

Did I describe the intended use of sig_* correctly?

Working on #18514, I found that the situation is confusing for me.

My plan was:

- With the current code from here and #23352, `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense` overrides the MtxLibDir variable that is declared in `sage.libs.meataxe`, but it doesn't touch the environment variables.
- The cohomology code cimports MtxLibDir from `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense` and reads its content. It is then also written into an environment variable, so that the MTX-executables can find the multiplication tables.

The reality is:

- When the cohomology code cimports MtxLibDir, its content is a certain location in `/usr/local/`, which is where the multiplication tables can NOT be found. Thus, any computation crashes.

If I recall correctly, the reason for the bad behaviour is the fact that the meataxe library is a dynamic, not a static, library. Hence, any Cython module and any C program using meataxe has to define MtxLibDir explicitly: Cimporting it won't suffice.

Concerning `MtxLibDir`: I think that part of the problem comes from insufficient separation between (1) the MeatAxe library and (2) the implementation of matrices using MeatAxe.

Things like dealing with the `MtxLibDir` and also the error handler really have nothing to do with matrices and should be moved to `src/sage/libs/meataxe.pyx`. If you set `MtxLibDir` in `src/sage/libs/meataxe.pyx` and you `import sage.libs.meataxe`, then that should work too and it's a much cleaner solution.

I think I have removed all such cases. `sig_on()` now only appears three times in the code, namely

```python
        sig_on()
        OUT.Data = MatDup(self.Data)
        MatMul(OUT.Data,right.Data)
        sig_off()
```


```python
        sig_on()
        MatMulStrassen(OUT.Data, self.Data, right.Data)
        sig_off()
```


```python
        sig_on()
        try:
            OUT.Data = MatInverse(self.Data)
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            sig_off()
            raise
        sig_off()
```

It doesn't involve python code, right?

Example, with the latest commit:

```
sage: M = random_matrix(GF(81,'x'),1000)
MTX location /usr/local/mtx/lib
os.c(254):p081.zzz: No such file or directory
```

which is an unhandled crash. So, both MtxLibDir is not visible for `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense` (otherwise meataxe would find the multiplication table) and the error handler is not defined (otherwise it would raise an error rather than crash).

How can this be overcome?

By this, I mean: We have modules A,B,C, and A is supposed to do some initialisation to a dynamic library that A, B and C link against. Is it possible to make it so that "import A" in B and C automatically executes code that will do the initialisation in B resp. in C rather than only in A?

Here, we have A=sage.libs.meataxe, B=sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense and C=the cohomology code from #18514

A potential solution would be to write `sage.libs.meataxe.pxi`, and then include the .pxi file rather than cimport.

However, that sounds like an ugly hack.

You're swapping "static" and "dynamic" but otherwise you are right: the problem with static libraries is that each Cython module gets its own "copy" of the static library.

Here is a better idea: in `meataxe.pxd`, define an inline function

```
cdef inline init_meataxe():
    # set up MtxLibDir and error handler
```

Then you just need to call `init_meataxe()` in the module(s) where you want to use MeatAxe.

Doesn't work. At least not when I do the following:

In sage/libs/meataxe.pxd

```python
cdef inline meataxe_init():
    ## Define an environment variable that enables MeatAxe to find
    ## its multiplication tables.
    from sage.env import DOT_SAGE
    MtxLibDir = PyBytes_AsString(os.path.join(DOT_SAGE,'meataxe'))
```

In sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pyx:

```python
print("MTX location", MtxLibDir)
meataxe_init()
print("New location", MtxLibDir)
```

Before and after calling meataxe_init() I get the same wrong location.

For Python 3 compatibility, it would be good to add

```
from __future__ import absolute_import, division
```

in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pyx`

Then you should also use floor division if that's what you want, for example here:

```
cdef size_t pickled_rowsize = len(Data)/nr
```

There might be other such places too, I have not checked.

Since this patch is getting rather big, would it be possible to separate this part? Then we could keep this ticket just to fix things, not adding new functionality.

If you feel up to it, I would actually suggest to split it up even further. For example, the pickling fixes alone deserve a separate ticket.

* 6e33226 - (t/23352/fix_random_matrix_gfpn_dense) Properly fill the last few columns of random meataxe matrices (2 days ago) <Simon King>

OK, quite a lot...

How to split that into smaller chunks? I see the following four topics:

1. Bug fixes, for example:
   * 6e33226 - Properly fill the last few columns of random meataxe matrices
   * 02fa8a2 - Make pickling machine independent
   * 9e0f5d4 - Fix reading mtx-matrix from non-existent file
2. Code style/cleanliness, for example:
   * b6c8114 - Make matrix_gfpn_dense python 3 compliant
   * 04e7986 - Improve use of sig_on/off/check
   * b70bc5f - Change some str into bytes
   * 413e4a9 - Remove deprecated Cython syntax, use check_malloc
   * d943f93 - Remove rawMatrix function 
3. Proper MeatAxe initialisation, for example
   * 08e03c2 - Change ErrorHandler? into sage_meataxe_error_handler
   * 353a8b9 - meataxe_init() inline function
   * 67a85ca - Move meataxe definitions from sage.matrix to sage.libs
   * c929fcc - Remove unused MTX* environment variables
4. Additions, for example
   * e17e4df - Document and test _rowlist_()
   * e861781 - Add c(p)def functions to get/set horizontal matrix slices

Since this ticket's name is about "addition", I suggest to deal with 4. *here*.

Since #23352 is about fixing something, I suggest to deal with 1. *there*, and make it a dependency of everything else.

And then there should be two new tickets for 2. and 3. Probably I will not cherry-pick commits, but will go through the whole diff and manually move stuff to the different topics.
Does that sound reasonable to you?

OK. Also, I found another case where I could be more specific (namely: If a file of a given name doesn't exist, which I guess should result in an !IOError).

I see. I didn't realize that wasn't already the case.  Is there any reason these have to be written in Cython? I don't see functions like these getting much speedup from it.  In any case , maybe I can just copy these directly into Sage and sprinkle them around the appropriate places.

You do get the speedup from *calling* those functions (calling a `cdef` function vs. calling a Python function).

And for `cypari2`, Cython was an obvious choice since `cypari2` is completely implemented in Cython.
