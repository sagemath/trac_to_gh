All backends right now compute both H/V-representation; the dual is of course a much more complete certificate that a vertex is really a vertex. Also, the bounding hyperplane is not canonical---which one to pick? If you really need one you can construct one from the incident hyperplane equations of the vertex (or, more generally, d-dimensional face).

In this case your considering one of two possible rays. Probably should only append rays for inequalities, but I'm not sure.

Reading carefully your doctests, one sees a bug, which will be fixed in #29155.

Instead of using `faces` for iteration you can use the new method `face_generator`.

I think the following is more direct:


```diff
-        origin = parent.zero().vertices()[0].vector()
+        origin = self.ambient_space().zero()
```


Otherwise you can put it positive review on my behalf. Maybe wait for bots yet.
