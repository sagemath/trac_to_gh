We add `_test...` methods to `Basis_abstract` and run the test suite for some instances of `FreeModuleBasis`, `FreeModuleCoBasis`.

The tests currently fail:

```
File "src/sage/tensor/modules/free_module_basis.py", line 388, in sage.tensor.modules.free_module_basis.FreeModuleCoBasis
Failed example:
    TestSuite(f).run()
...
    IndexError: index out of range: 0 not in [1, 3]
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    The following tests failed: _test_iter_len

Should the method `FreeModuleCoBasis.free_module` really return the (primal) base module, as it currently does? Or rather the dual of it?

While there is a bit of ambiguity, considering the output:

```
sage: f
Dual basis (e^0,e^1,e^2) on the Rank-3 free module M over the Integer Ring
```

which is saying that it is a dual basis of M, I think it is fair that `free_module` returns the base module rather than its dual. As such, I am setting this to a positive review.
