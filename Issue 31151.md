# Issue 31151: Correct docstring in hyperplanes method for HyperplaneArrangement

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31388

Original creator: nailuj

Original creation time: 2021-02-12 14:57:48

Keywords: HyperplaneArrangements

The current docstring of the 
`hyperplanes` method of the `HyperplaneArrangementElement` class says

`Return the number of hyperplanes in the arrangement`

when it does in fact return the hyperplanes in the arrangement as a tuple.
