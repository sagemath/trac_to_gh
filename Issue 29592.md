In #29493, it was proposed to remove the remove the `sage.libs.glpk.error` module and `error_recovery.patch` for GLPK, which was rejected by upstream.

This ticket is split out from the larger changes in #29493.

I have created this ticket as a place for a continued discussion of this removal, initially proposed in #29493.
