(from #30296)

Jupyter ships with its own copy of mathjax already.

We remove the installation of the symlink to our copy of `mathjax` from the `nbextensions` directory and the corresponding configuration item from the notebook.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31035
