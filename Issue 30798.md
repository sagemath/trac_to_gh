(from #30296)

Jupyter ships with its own copy of mathjax already.

We remove the installation of the symlink to our copy of `mathjax` from the `nbextensions` directory and the corresponding configuration item from the notebook.

To be considered in the review of this ticket:

 - Is there any difference in font rendering between the mathjax that comes with Jupyter notebook and our copy of mathjax? Does Jupyter notebook rely on online resources for any font rendering?
