The intervals in a `RealSet` already have these methods.

It would also be nice to be able to compute closure and interior relative to a given larger `RealSet`. 

```
sage: RealSet((1, 2)).closure(relative_to=RealSet((0, 2))  # wishful thinking
[1, 2)
```

Could you also add a test:

```
RealSet((1, 2), (2, 3)).boundary()
```

Other than that, LGTM.
