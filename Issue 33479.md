# Issue 33479: cycle_basis() docstring used equality instead of assignment

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33716

I was trying to implement an algo using cycle_basis() (`sage.graphs.generic_graph.cycle_basis`) and got a bit confused with the `INPUT` docstring. 

It says: 
`output â€“ string (default: 'vertex'); whether every cycle is given as a list of vertices (output == 'vertex') or a list of edges (output == 'edge')`

Shouldn't we write `output='vertex'` and `output='edge'` instead? If anyone agrees, I can quickly make a commit to address this.

Whether it is good style to write the documentation with such formulas is another issue, but I think equality is stating intent here: it is describing what the input is when `output` equals 'vertex' and when `output` equals 'edge'. I think that's the desired way of describing the output.

Elsewhere, the documentation may be describing something like "If you want vertex output, you should specify `output = vertex` as a keyword argument" or something along those lines.

If it really bothers you, perhaps

```
output - string (default: 'vertex'); specify output format.
   When 'vertex', cycles are returned as a list of vertices
   and when 'edge', cycles are returned as a list of edges.

It doesn't bother me much. We can leave it the way it is, if no one else sees a problem with it. 

I have been working with Sage for a few weeks now, and so far, I noticed that the syntax used in most docstrings is `param='value'`. Since the doc of cycle_basis was different, it just stood out to me. It'll be nice if the syntax is consistent throughout.

I agree. We are constantly working on improving the coding style and the presentation. It's a lot of work and it must be done in multiple tickets to reduce merge conflicts.

Is there a meta ticket to track this? I'd like to see whether I can help out

I don't think we have such a meta ticket. `@`chapoton is very active on this issue, and I help for the graph module mostly.
