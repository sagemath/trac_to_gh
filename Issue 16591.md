Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16828

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2014-08-14 13:21:24

In `GO` of sage/groups/matrix_gps/orthogonal.py there needs to be an extra colon for correct formatting.
Currently this is line 171. https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/groups/matrix_gps/orthogonal.py#n171

Pick a milestone when it should be merged, if any.

Okay, I get asking people to write names.    But this was obvious as a typo fix, and I don't know why I didn't pick the milestone - probably because I had to relog into Trac about five times for each comment while in Chennai.

Sometimes its not clear whether you want to close as duplicate or not. I didn't have time to read ticket history during the day.
