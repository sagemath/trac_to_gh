For example :


```
sage: s = WordMorphism('1->12,2->13,3->1')           
sage: D = s.fixed_point('1')                         
sage: v = s.pisot_eigenvector_right()                
sage: P = WordPaths('123',[(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)]) 
sage: w = P(D[:200])                                 
sage: w.plot_projection(v, size=30)
```


Depends on #8670 (merged in 4.7.alpha2).
