Keywords: coxeter, reduced word, graph

The reduced word graph of an element `w` in a Coxeter group is a graph whose vertices are reduced words of `w` and edges are when two reduced expressions differ by a single braid move.

Here is how the graph in your example looks like on my machine (when I try `view`):

Is this a problem with this patch, with the graph framework (which is seeing changes these days), with graphics, or with dot2tex?

You have to explicitly set `G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex')`, as I didn't want to do the check for dot2tex as there was an issue with this for posets recently (IDK the ticket number off-hand).

Didn't you run a `make distclean` when upgrading? Did you rerun `sage -i dot2tex`?

Your changes LGTM. Thanks for doing the review.

Hi,

I was not quick enough to review to ticket! Darij was too fast!

I will definitely be using this in the future, thanks Travis!

I had a suggestion of extension for the ticket. I guess now I'll call it a follow-up. There is a possible follow-up which could implement the even/odd length braid relations (quotients of the present graph).

This is, in particular, related to the higher Bruhat order, plabic graphs, and subword complexes.

See section 3 of this paper.

[http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7380](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7380)

I'll need this, so I could work on it soon.

I needed this to do KLR algebras, but I'm glad you will find a use for it. Feel free to cc me on your follow-up and I will review it (and to pester me if I let it slip away).
