No. I meant what is written. Look at the other reference (not Brouwer) that I cite after this paragraph. I added it there because it has been rather difficult to figure out what was meant by (n,epsilon)-RSHCD. That reference defines it clearly. By the way both `\delta` and `\epsilon` belong to `-1,1`, so the equation you wrote is never satisfied.

> Let's put it here in this way, [BH12], OK? Less hassle for me on #18972 then.

Fixed.

I also added a commit I had forgotten: otherwise the new constructions are not used in `graphs.strongly_regular_graph`.

I am not so sure. I have spend some time to do a better "ascii_plugin". I made it so that it now complains only in presence of UTF8 characters in .py or .pyx files without utf8 declaration in the preamble. Which is the case here.

There is https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/

But is seems to be useful only if you want unicode in the source.
Maybe encoding declaration in presence of uft8 can be considered good practice anyway ?

in your case the group will be given by 3 permutation generators, but this will only make it even faster.

How hard is to say that in a comment that you used pds such-and-such for group such-and-such?

If you can make it work fast in Sage, I have no objection. Here is the code I used to generate it:


```
from sage.groups.finitely_presented import FinitelyPresentedGroup
G = FreeGroup('x,y,z')
x,y,z = G.gens()
rels = (x**5,y**5,z**4,x*y*x**(-1)*y**(-1),z*x*z**(-1)*x**(-2),z*y*z**(-1)*y**(-2))
G = FinitelyPresentedGroup(G,rels)
x,y,z = G.gens()
H = G.as_permutation_group()

L=["120","140","200","210","201","401","411","321","002","012","022","042","303","403","013","413","240","031","102","323","300","231","132","133","310","141","142","233","340","241","202","333","410","341","222","433","430","441","242","302","312","322","332","442","143"]
L = map(lambda x:map(int,x),L)
L = [G(x**xx*y**yy*z**zz) for xx,yy,zz in L]
GG = Graph()
for v in G:
    for u in L:
        uv = u*v
        GG.add_edge([v]+[x for x in G if x==uv])
        print GG.size()
```


> How hard is to say that in a comment that you used pds such-and-such for group such-and-such?

I just do not care at all. That's why I did not. Can you acknowledge that others can have a different view on this?

I will add a commit, just to end the discussion.

I can contact an author of the paper in question I know, and ask his opinion.
You will  be in for a shock then ;-)
To many people a reference of the form "this is one I fished out from [Blah]" is too vague, not only to me.

> I will add a commit, just to end the discussion.

Could you change ` in [JK03]_.` to `in Tab.8.1 from [JK03]_.` there?
Otherwise you force the person interested to browse through most of the paper, and it is 30+ pages long.

Hello,

> (and analogous code for the other graph), and # long time tests showing that these are the graphs you claim they are.

I do not want to, especially when the code is badly written in order to avoid a bug. If you care, you can add a commit. But really, it would be better to wait for the bug to be solved before writing that.

> I can contact an author of the paper in question I know, and ask his opinion.

It would change nothing even if the author has the same opinion. The status is simple: *I* do not care, which is why I did not do it. That ends your means to force me to do it. If you want to do it, there is no problem, as usual.

As for the authors, I sent them an email this morning to tell them what I did, and to thank them for the instructions.

> Could you change ` in [JK03]_.` to `in Tab.8.1 from [JK03]_.` there?

Will do.

well, it's your Sage code that does something very slow. Here is a slight modification that
is very fast:


```
def g1():
    from sage.groups.finitely_presented import FinitelyPresentedGroup
    G = FreeGroup('x,y,z')
    x,y,z = G.gens()
    rels = (x**5,y**5,z**4,x*y*x**(-1)*y**(-1),z*x*z**(-1)*x**(-2),z*y*z**(-1)*y**(-2))
    G = FinitelyPresentedGroup(G,rels)
    x,y,z = G.gens()
    H = G.as_permutation_group()
    L=["120","140","200","210","201","401","411","321","002","012","022","042","303","403","013","413","240","031","102","323","300","231","132","133","310","141","142","233","340","241","202","333","410","341","222","433","430","441","242","302","312","322","332","442","143"]
    L = map(lambda x:map(int,x),L)
    x,y,z=(H.0,H.1,H.2)  # from now on we work in H
    L = [H(x**xx*y**yy*z**zz) for xx,yy,zz in L]
    GG = Graph()
    for v in H:
        GG.add_edges(map(lambda u: (v,u*v), L)) # and we add edges in bunches
    return GG
```

gives

```
sage: timeit('G=g1()')
25 loops, best of 3: 13.7 ms per loop
sage: G.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True)
(100, 45, 20, 20)
```


Would you like to change the code to use this way to build these graphs, or prefer me doing it?
In the latter case I'd appreciate having strings in L for the other graph...

in fact the lines

```
    GG = Graph()
    for v in H:
        GG.add_edges(map(lambda u: (v,u*v), L)) # and we add edges in bunches
```

can be replaced by

```

You really have your way to phrase things, Dima... Clearly there is no slowness in Sage, and I was doing it very badly.

At some point I wanted to try the permutation group version, but I did not know how to get the generators back in this version of the group. Despite the fact that it indeed works, how can you be sure that you will get the same generators, in the same order?

> Would you like to change the code to use this way to build these graphs, or prefer me doing it?

You want that feature, and you apparently know more than I on the matter.

I don't have it anymore. I overwrote it with this second list.

No, no, no, creation of the same group twice is a deadly sin in my Book!
(besides, `SRG_100_44_18_20` and `SRG_100_45_20_20` doctest it good enough)

This is ridiculous. But if you insist:

1) Make it a Python function
2) Doctest it properly
3) Rename it with a `_` before its name, so that it is clearly a private function

This function is a cdef function because it needs to be fast. So it can't.

I want you to do the job properly: either you copy paste it, or you document what you write. You don't turn a function into a 'cdef' function just because you don't want to write documentation.

Besides, you don't give a positive review to your own changes. Period.
