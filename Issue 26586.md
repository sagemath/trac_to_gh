**python remark**:
I think there is a bad copy-paste line 15709.

```
        if not self.has_vertex(u):
            raise ValueError("vertex '{}' is not in the (di)graph".format(u))
        if not self.has_vertex(u):
            raise ValueError("vertex '{}' is not in the (di)graph".format(u))
```


**pep8 remarks**:
- 1. Missing whitespace around operator:
l 15278: `s=start`
- 2. At least two spaces before inline comment:
l 15289: `s = next(act_path_iter[-1]) # try to get the next neighbor/successor, ...`\\

l 15553: `if u == v: # to avoid a NetworkX bug`\\

l 15714: `# to avoid a NetworkX bug`\\

- 3. Do not assign a lambda expression use a def:
l 15551, 15724, 15947, 16167, 16450, 16490, 16516: `weight_function = lambda e: e[2]`\\

l 15564, 15736, 15949, 16169, 16481: `weight_function = lambda e: 1`
- 4. Too many blank lines:
l 15557
- 5. Missing whitespace:
l 15984: `_,pred = ...`\\

l 16492: `dist[u],pred[u] = ...`

I have implemented all your comments. Thank you.

You're welcome.

There is one remaining `weight_function = lambda e: 1` in `shortest_path_all_pairs` line 16487.
