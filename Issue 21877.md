OK. Were these done with


```
find ... | xargs perl -e "s|(^ +<)type ('[^']+'>$)|\1... \2|g;" -p -i.bak
```


?

rc1 is out, so I changed the milestone.

This was done with several grep and replace, indeed, but I left out the case of "<type 'instancemethod'>" because I do not know the behavior of that in Py3.
