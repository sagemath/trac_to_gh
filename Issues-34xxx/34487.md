This returns a partial module morphism from a free module with basis to an ambient free module, indexed according to the support order.

Calling the morphism is like calling the element method `IndexedFreeModuleElement._vector_`, but it would also work with elements of infinite-dimensional modules because an appropriate finite-dimensional submodule will be used.

This generalizes the interaction of `_dense_free_module`, `get_order`, and `_vector_` in `CubicHeckeAlgebra`; and it makes the morphism used by `_vector_` explicit.

Also for `ModulesWithBasis.FiniteDimensional` we can generalize the following methods of `FreeModule_generic` (from `sage.modules`):
`coordinates`, `coordinate_vector`, `coordinate_module`.

Probably better to actually make this `support_submodule`, `coordinate_submodule`, with the morphisms just exposed as the lift/retract maps of the constructed submodule.
