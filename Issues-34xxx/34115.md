We introduce a reusable workflow `docker.yml`.

After #34017, `tox.yml` only contains Linux builds, so we rename it to `ci-linux.yml` and factor it through `docker.yml`.

We leave `tox-optional.yml`, `tox-experimental.yml` as is for a follow-up ticket (#33062).

We also add two new platforms and remove two platforms that can no longer be tested.

Test run: https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/2748565810

The workflow `docker.yml` can also be used by upstream packages. First example: https://github.com/latte-int/latte/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-sage.yml (ran at https://github.com/latte-int/latte/actions/runs/2633447828)
