Currently, an instance of `Stream_initialized` duplicates the cache of its defining stream.

This ticket aims at removing this redundancy, at least in the case when the defining stream is dense.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Unfortunately, the current branch fails.  Here is a simplified illustration of what goes wrong:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: A = L.undefined(valuation=5)
sage: B = L.undefined()
sage: A.define(z^5 + B)
sage: B.define(z + A)
sage: A
z^5 + z^9 + z^10 + O(z^12)
sage: B
1 + z^4 + O(z^7)
```

I think we are sloppy about our use of `_approximate_order` and `_offset`, which are now both lazy attributes.  This might eventually become a problem anyway (eg. with #34556), so we better solve it:

```
sage: A = L.undefined(valuation=5); B = L.undefined(); A.define(z^5 + B); B.define(z + A)
sage: A._coeff_stream._offset
5
sage: B._coeff_stream._offset
0
sage: B[0]
1
```

The iterator of `B` (which is just the default iterator of `Stream_inexact`) is

```
    def iterate_coefficients(self):
        n = self._approximate_order
        while True:
            yield self.get_coefficient(n)
            n += 1
```
When it is called by `B._coeff_stream.__getitem__[0]`, we find `n == self._approximate_order == 1`, which does not correspond to `self._offset`, which is `0`.
