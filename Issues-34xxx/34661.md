Currently, an instance of `Stream_initialized` duplicates the cache of its defining stream.

This ticket aims at removing this redundancy, at least in the case when the defining stream is dense.

Unfortunately, the current branch fails.  Here is a simplified illustration of what goes wrong:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: A = L.undefined(valuation=5)
sage: B = L.undefined()
sage: A.define(z^5 + B)
sage: B.define(z + A)
sage: A
z^5 + z^9 + z^10 + O(z^12)
sage: B
1 + z^4 + O(z^7)
```

I think we are sloppy about our use of `_approximate_order` and `_offset`, which are now both lazy attributes.  This might eventually become a problem anyway (eg. with #34556), so we better solve it:

```
sage: A = L.undefined(valuation=5); B = L.undefined(); A.define(z^5 + B); B.define(z + A)
sage: A._coeff_stream._offset
5
sage: B._coeff_stream._offset
0
sage: B[0]
1
```

The iterator of `B` (which is just the default iterator of `Stream_inexact`) is

```
    def iterate_coefficients(self):
        n = self._approximate_order
        while True:
            yield self.get_coefficient(n)
            n += 1
```
When it is called by `B._coeff_stream.__getitem__[0]`, we find `n == self._approximate_order == 1`, which does not correspond to `self._offset`, which is `0`.

The current behaviour is that it starts with the `_approximate_order` which is currently valid :-)

Actually, now I found a bug (or garbage in - garbage out without warning), without this ticket:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ, sparse=False); A = L.undefined(valuation=3); B = L.undefined(); A.define(z^3 + B); B.define(z^2 + A^2)
sage: A
z^3 + z^6 + 2*z^9 + O(z^10)
sage: B
z^2 + z^6 + O(z^7)
```
This is wrong, because `A != z^3 + B`.

My hope would be to have a cleaner design, and more precise responsibilities for `approximate_order`.

Help would be very much appreciated.

I guess I should go through a simple recursive definition with pen and paper.

@tscrim, in case you have some time, this is the ticket I currently find most important.

I'd like to stress, however, that I do not find the aim as stated in the description important (in most cases, the savings will be negligible).  Instead, what I hope for is a much cleaner (and therefore more robust) design.

In particular, this ticket should probably be considered together with #34556.

No problem. I will be at a conference next week, but I can talk during my evenings.
