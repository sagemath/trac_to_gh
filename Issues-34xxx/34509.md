This is the element class of a `CombinatorialFreeModule`.

Its implementation of `__iter__`, `__contains__`, `__len__` are not compatible with anything in the [collections.abc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html) protocols. Specifically, 

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a','b','c'])
sage: B = F.basis()
sage: f = B['a'] + 3*B['c']; f
sage: import collections.abc
sage: isinstance(f, collections.abc.Collection)
True
```
but `__iter__`ating over this collection gives objects that are not `__contain__`ed in it.

To improve interoperability, we propose to make the following changes: 
- Deprecate the `__contains__` method (currently testing whether a given index is in the support). After its removal, the class would no longer be considered by Python to be a subclass of `collections.abc.Collection`, but merely a `Sized` `Iterable`. 
- As a replacement for this functionality, revise the method `support` to return an instance of a new class `SupportView`, which provides a fast `__contains__` method, instead of a list.


(Similarly, in #24815, it was proposed to make the elements of free modules from `sage.modules` a [collections.abc.Sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence).)

Contrast this to the “usual” free modules, where they have a natural compatibility with `sequence` as elements in R<sup>n</sup>, which are also how we think of finite sequences.

Yes, and there are two interpretations of this when the parent is a submodule.

- one is `monomial_coefficients`, which refers to the basis of the submodule
- one is the proposed new `items`, which will refer to the ambient. (This will be compatible with sparse vectors in `sage.modules`.)

So actually returning the coefficient as part of the iterator instead of saying you should access it by a completely different method is exactly the same by your logic. You wouldn’t agree that it is a much smaller change to have R<sup>n</sup> vector iterators change to return the pairs?

Unfortunately because of different implementation goals (mainly the speed that is needed for the R<sup>n</sup> modules), we cannot enforce compatibility for everything. I would rather all vectors follow what CFM vectors do from a more abstract mathematical point of view, but we have to make trade-offs. This one is here very clear-cut.

Also, it isn’t just limited to sparse vectors, right?

If we change the iterator for R<sup>n</sup> modules to make it compatible with what `IndexedFreeModuleElement` does, then this would lead to slow downs because the R<sup>n</sup> module elements are fairly likely to be used in time-critical code sections (where extra indirections can matter).

I don’t think it is necessarily worth it as it won’t be run in tight loops. Although it would just become `if len(phi.support()) == 1 and 0 in phi.support() and phi[0] < ell:` I guess.

In view of #29218, I would also move `__iter__` from `IndexedFreeModuleElement` to the category, next to `__len__`. Together they merely provide a default implementation of the `Sized` `Iterable` protocols. (Dense modules necessarily override both.)

The `length` method, on the other hand, is full specified and would be changed to not go through `__len__`.
