This is the element class of a `CombinatorialFreeModule`.

Its implementation of `__iter__`, `__contains__`, `__len__` are not compatible with anything in the [collections.abc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html) protocols. Specifically, 

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a','b','c'])
sage: B = F.basis()
sage: f = B['a'] + 3*B['c']; f
sage: import collections.abc
sage: isinstance(f, collections.abc.Collection)
True
```
but `__iter__`ating over this collection gives objects that are not `__contain__`ed in it.

To improve interoperability, we propose to make the following changes: 
- Deprecate the `__contains__` method (currently testing whether a given index is in the support). After its removal, the class would no longer be considered by Python to be a subclass of `collections.abc.Collection`, but merely a `Sized` `Iterable`. 
- As a replacement for this functionality, revise the method `support` to return an instance of a new class `SupportView`, which provides a fast `__contains__` method, instead of a list.


(Similarly, in #24815, it was proposed to make the elements of free modules from `sage.modules` a [collections.abc.Sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence).)

Part of Meta-ticket #30309: Unify free module elements API: methods dict, monomial_coefficients, etc.

Contrast this to the “usual” free modules, where they have a natural compatibility with `sequence` as elements in R<sup>n</sup>, which are also how we think of finite sequences.

Yes, and there are two interpretations of this when the parent is a submodule.

- one is `monomial_coefficients`, which refers to the basis of the submodule
- one is the proposed new `items`, which will refer to the ambient. (This will be compatible with sparse vectors in `sage.modules`.)

Replying to [Matthias Köppe](#comment%3A11):
> Yes, it makes no sense to say that returning `(key,value)` pairs is closer to being the "same API" as returning `value`s.


So actually returning the coefficient as part of the iterator instead of saying you should access it by a completely different method is exactly the same by your logic. You wouldn’t agree that it is a much smaller change to have R<sup>n</sup> vector iterators change to return the pairs?

Unfortunately because of different implementation goals (mainly the speed that is needed for the R<sup>n</sup> modules), we cannot enforce compatibility for everything. I would rather all vectors follow what CFM vectors do from a more abstract mathematical point of view, but we have to make trade-offs. This one is here very clear-cut.

Also, it isn’t just limited to sparse vectors, right?

If we change the iterator for R<sup>n</sup> modules to make it compatible with what `IndexedFreeModuleElement` does, then this would lead to slow downs because the R<sup>n</sup> module elements are fairly likely to be used in time-critical code sections (where extra indirections can matter).

Yes, of course the current implementation of `support()` is bad. It's another Python2-ish leftover of returning lists all the time.

We have somewhat allowed for the possibility that it can hold zero coefficients, but we almost always in practice just remove them. We probably should just enforce this. This would make the `support()` call much cheaper, although checking containment could still be slow as it might be `list`-like checking rather than `set`-like. Anyways, I doubt it is used in much time critical code, but it is still good to keep similar performance in mind.

I don’t think it is necessarily worth it as it won’t be run in tight loops. Although it would just become `if len(phi.support()) == 1 and 0 in phi.support() and phi[0] < ell:` I guess.

Should we also do comparisons with different `SupportView` objects, following python?

```
sage: d = {1:1, 2:2}
