We add a dummy package `github_cli` for
- https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
- https://repology.org/project/github-cli/versions
and add it to `_develop`'s dependencies.

Thus it appears in the command lines in https://3b45534b5b3352783037dfc8b44a6590deca8100--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/source.html#software-prerequisites-and-recommended-packages
as well as in the conda environment file `src/environment-dev.yml`.

No, that was take care of by #34561.

`ubuntu-jammy` and `ubuntu-kinetic` have the package, see https://repology.org/project/github-cli/versions

That takes care of the openssh issue, but not the failing gh.

But sage also offically supports older ubuntu versions... Thus, I suggest to add the commands from https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian-ubuntu-linux-raspberry-pi-os-apt before the autogenerated `apt-get install ...` line.

None of this is specific to the `gh` package. Whenever we add a new package, it may not be available on older versions.

I started using `gh` only recently, and still don't know about those powerful alternatives except github web interface (I don't feel like searching for them, yet).

Promoting `gh` as a development prerequisite seems too much to me. But as  `gh`, along with `git`, will be the official tool (I hope) with which we document the development workflow with github, it seems appropriate to advertise `gh` and offer an installation guide. So

+1 to adding dummy package `github-cli`.

+1 to removing `github-cli` from `_develop/dependencies`. 

We may add a new dummy package `_develop_extras` and add `github-cli` to it.

If you wish to do Sage development, we recommend that you additionally install the following:

$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake gh git gpgconf libtool openssh-client pkg-config
```
Of the packages in the list, `git` is really not an option for sage development.
