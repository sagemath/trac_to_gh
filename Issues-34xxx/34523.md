We add a dummy package `github_cli` for
- https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
- https://repology.org/project/github-cli/versions
and add it to `_develop`'s dependencies.

Thus it appears in the command lines in https://3b45534b5b3352783037dfc8b44a6590deca8100--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/source.html#software-prerequisites-and-recommended-packages
as well as in the conda environment file `src/environment-dev.yml`.

Doesn't sound like an improvement to me.

Note that this section has long lists of packages that we *recommend* people install. 
These are not the minimal prerequisites, which would be a shorter list of packages.

I'll take a stab at clarifying this.

It should wait until the move to gh is decided, or not?

I still question if a "general recommendation" is a good idea. For me the gh cli falls in the same preference category as IDEs (since it is essentially a different view on the gh web interface). There are few other tools that provide similar functionality, are as officially supported (e.g. https://desktop.github.com/) and some devs might prefer one over the other. 

Just to make this clear: I'm not objecting that we recommend the gh cli, just that it should be accompanied with a disclaimer explaining when to install it.

But sage also offically supports older ubuntu versions... Thus, I suggest to add the commands from https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian-ubuntu-linux-raspberry-pi-os-apt before the autogenerated `apt-get install ...` line.

None of this is specific to the `gh` package. Whenever we add a new package, it may not be available on older versions.

I started using `gh` only recently, and still don't know about those powerful alternatives except github web interface (I don't feel like searching for them, yet).

Promoting `gh` as a development prerequisite seems too much to me. But as  `gh`, along with `git`, will be the official tool (I hope) with which we document the development workflow with github, it seems appropriate to advertise `gh` and offer an installation guide. So

+1 to adding dummy package `github-cli`.

+1 to removing `github-cli` from `_develop/dependencies`. 

We may add a new dummy package `_develop_extras` and add `github-cli` to it.

=================================================================

Description
-----------

Script package representing a list of system packages recommended for developers.
```

A "hard dependency" of a package that collects recommendations is merely a recommendation.

we read

```
If you wish to do Sage development, we recommend that you additionally install the following:

$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake gh git gpgconf libtool openssh-client pkg-config
```
Of the packages in the list, `git` is really not an option for sage development.
