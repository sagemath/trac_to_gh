We add a dummy package `github_cli` for
- https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
- https://repology.org/project/github-cli/versions
and add it to `_develop`'s dependencies.

Thus it appears in the command lines in https://3b45534b5b3352783037dfc8b44a6590deca8100--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/source.html#software-prerequisites-and-recommended-packages
as well as in the conda environment file `src/environment-dev.yml`.

It's an appropriate use of our infrastructure as it is designed. Dummy script packages serve exactly this purpose: Advertising software and how to obtain it on different systems, in a way that it serves both documentation purposes and provisions executable environments.

Doesn't sound like an improvement to me.

Note that this section has long lists of packages that we *recommend* people install. 
These are not the minimal prerequisites, which would be a shorter list of packages.

I'll take a stab at clarifying this.

by the way, gh/cli is extendable - see https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_extension

There is a list of ones promoted (?) by github: https://github.com/topics/gh-extension

So we can potentially script what's needed to make `gh` better suited for our worksflows (or find what's needed there)

I think that the changes in #34528 address the concerns (changing the language from "If you wish to do Sage development, additionally install the following" to "If you wish to do Sage development, we recommend that you additionally install the following:").

Is this branch ready for review?

It should wait until the move to gh is decided, or not?

I still question if a "general recommendation" is a good idea. For me the gh cli falls in the same preference category as IDEs (since it is essentially a different view on the gh web interface). There are few other tools that provide similar functionality, are as officially supported (e.g. https://desktop.github.com/) and some devs might prefer one over the other. 

Just to make this clear: I'm not objecting that we recommend the gh cli, just that it should be accompanied with a disclaimer explaining when to install it.

But sage also offically supports older ubuntu versions... Thus, I suggest to add the commands from https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian-ubuntu-linux-raspberry-pi-os-apt before the autogenerated `apt-get install ...` line.

None of this is specific to the `gh` package. Whenever we add a new package, it may not be available on older versions.

I started using `gh` only recently, and still don't know about those powerful alternatives except github web interface (I don't feel like searching for them, yet).

Promoting `gh` as a development prerequisite seems too much to me. But as  `gh`, along with `git`, will be the official tool (I hope) with which we document the development workflow with github, it seems appropriate to advertise `gh` and offer an installation guide. So

+1 to adding dummy package `github-cli`.

+1 to removing `github-cli` from `_develop/dependencies`. 

We may add a new dummy package `_develop_extras` and add `github-cli` to it.

we read

```
If you wish to do Sage development, we recommend that you additionally install the following:

$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake gh git gpgconf libtool openssh-client pkg-config
```
Of the packages in the list, `git` is really not an option for sage development.
