```
We add a dummy package `github_cli` for
- https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
- https://repology.org/project/github-cli/versions
and add it to `_develop`'s dependencies.

Thus it appears in the command lines in https://3b45534b5b3352783037dfc8b44a6590deca8100--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/source.html#software-prerequisites-and-recommended-packages
as well as in the conda environment file `src/environment-dev.yml`.

<a id='comment:25'></a>I don't see the harm in recommending installation of this package. It's not like we're recommending `vi` when we all know that `emacs` is a better option. It's also not like recommending `TeX-Live` which is quite large (a few gigabytes). People are free to ignore the suggestion, or they can install it (since it's quick to install and doesn't take up that much space) and then end up not using it.

Well, I don't see us documenting use of GitHub Desktop in our manuals.
The official command-line interface does have special standing.

> in my opinion, gh-cli will be considerably less used than even git-trac.


Documenting use of the github-cli has an important function for the proposed transition to GitHub: To alleviate concerns that developers are "forced" to interact with a website.

That takes care of the openssh issue, but not the failing gh.

But sage also offically supports older ubuntu versions... Thus, I suggest to add the commands from https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian-ubuntu-linux-raspberry-pi-os-apt before the autogenerated `apt-get install ...` line.

None of this is specific to the `gh` package. Whenever we add a new package, it may not be available on older versions.

I started using `gh` only recently, and still don't know about those powerful alternatives except github web interface (I don't feel like searching for them, yet).

Promoting `gh` as a development prerequisite seems too much to me. But as  `gh`, along with `git`, will be the official tool (I hope) with which we document the development workflow with github, it seems appropriate to advertise `gh` and offer an installation guide. So

+1 to adding dummy package `github-cli`.

+1 to removing `github-cli` from `_develop/dependencies`. 

We may add a new dummy package `_develop_extras` and add `github-cli` to it.

Description

Script package representing a list of system packages recommended for developers.

A "hard dependency" of a package that collects recommendations is merely a recommendation.

```
If you wish to do Sage development, we recommend that you additionally install the following:

$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake gh git gpgconf libtool openssh-client pkg-config
```
Of the packages in the list, `git` is really not an option for sage development.
