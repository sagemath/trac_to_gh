We modernize how we pass build options to the package, using the PEP 517 `--config-settings` mechanism. This is the same as in #34421, where it was needed as a critical bug fix. (For `python_igraph` there is no bug because the analysis in #33138 is still true for our current version of `python_igraph`.)

Also including a minor upgrade to `python_igraph`.

I'm seeing

```
[python_igraph-0.9.11]   We are going to build the C core of igraph.
[python_igraph-0.9.11]     Source folder: vendor/source/igraph
[python_igraph-0.9.11]     Build folder: vendor/build/igraph
[python_igraph-0.9.11]     Install folder: vendor/install/igraph
```
which means that the `--use-pkgconfig` option was not processed correctly. Working on it
