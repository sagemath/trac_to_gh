We modernize how we pass build options to the package, using the PEP 517 `--config-settings` mechanism. This is the same as in #34421, where it was needed as a critical bug fix. (For `python_igraph` there is no bug because the analysis in #33138 is still true for our current version of `python_igraph`.)

Also including a minor upgrade to `python_igraph`.
