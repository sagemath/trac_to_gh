<a id='comment:1'></a>Using a the na√Øve version using the Taylor series speeds things up considerably:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: f = sqrt(1 + z)
sage: %time f[200]
CPU times: user 254 ms, sys: 4.21 ms, total: 258 ms
Wall time: 258 ms
```
versus before

```
sage: %time f[200]
CPU times: user 2.39 s, sys: 1.83 ms, total: 2.4 s
Wall time: 2.4 s
```

Another example:

```
sage: q = ZZ['q'].fraction_field().gen()
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(q.parent())
sage: f = (1 - z)^q
sage: f
1 - q*z + ((q^2 - q)/2)*z^2 + ((-q^3 + 3*q^2 - 2*q)/6)*z^3 + ((q^4 - 6*q^3 + 11*q^2 - 6*q)/24)*z^4 + ((-q^5 + 10*q^4 - 35*q^3 + 50*q^2 - 24*q)/120)*z^5 + ((q^6 - 15*q^5 + 85*q^4 - 225*q^3 + 274*q^2 - 120*q)/720)*z^6 + O(z^7)
sage: %time f[200]
CPU times: user 439 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 439 ms
Wall time: 439 ms
```
versus before

```
sage: %time c = f[200]
CPU times: user 10.3 s, sys: 9.75 ms, total: 10.3 s
Wall time: 10.3 s

<a id='comment:4'></a>I reproduced the time difference, that's indeed huge!

I also took the opportunity to update the docstring for `__pow__` with your examples. Before that it was only documenting integer powers. Once you have reviewed this change I think it's good to go.
