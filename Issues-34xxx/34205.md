When system packages are upgraded, shared libraries that a Sage installation links to can disappear, rendering the Sage installation broken. This is a common problem, reported for example in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/Iz8ZsmQM3Pg/m/CPl9CbHmBgAJ

As a partial solution, we can copy system shared libraries into our platform wheels using auditwheel (Linux) or delocate (macOS), like cibuildwheel does. This increases the installation size and build time, so it should be optional.

This is only a partial solution because 
- executables in `$SAGE_LOCAL` (which are not installed via wheels) can still break when shared libraries that they are linked to disappear
- sagelib is not installed via a wheel (#32874)

 As a partial solution, we can copy system shared libraries into our platform wheels using auditwheel (Linux) or delocate (macOS), like cibuildwheel does. This increases the installation size and build time, so it should be optional.
