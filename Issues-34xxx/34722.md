This is mainly to reduce the amount of code duplication in `sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.weierstrass_morphism.isomorphism` by turning it into a generator, plus generic style tweaks.

I consider the second commit (renaming `isomorphisms()` to `_isomorphisms()`) optional: The function has been marked as "not intended for users" forever, so I figured we might as well just hide it. Note that this does not affect the `EllipticCurve_generic.isomorphisms()` *method* in any way.
