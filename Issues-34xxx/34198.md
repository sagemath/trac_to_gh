Currently (Sage 9.6), trying to construct an ideal of a non-maximal order in a number field errors out.

We should at least have a basic implementation that supports the standard ideal operations. This can serve as a foundation to which specialized code (such as for class-group computations, cf. #27413) can later be added as needed.

**Status:** new

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34198
