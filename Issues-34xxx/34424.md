Currently `TensorFreeModule` (and similar classes) inherits many methods from `FiniteRankFreeModule` that actually only work with the base module.
Trying to use them leads to incomprehensible error messages. For example:

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 3, name='M')
sage: M.tensor_module(2, 1).tensor_module(3, 3)
Free module of type-(3,3) tensors on the Free module of type-(2,1) tensors on the Rank-3 free module M over the Integer Ring
sage: _.an_element()
ValueError: the None has not been defined on the Free module of type-(2,1) tensors on the Rank-3 free module M over the Integer Ring
```

As discussed in #30229#comment:6, we introduce a common base class that only defines the methods that should be inherited by `TensorFreeModule` and other such classes.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Here's a basic version that works.

Some more of the methods can probably be moved to `FiniteRankFreeModule_abstract` -- but currently all doctests pass as is, so in this case we should add some examples that use subclasses.

```diff
- Free module of finite rank over a commutative ring.
+ Abstract base class for free modules of finite rank over a commutative ring.
```
Otherwise, LGTM.
