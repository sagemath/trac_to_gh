Did you check the documentation output? I am a bit worried about the docstrings with `\*` in them (e.g., `act_on_polynomial()`).

It displays `f(self*x)`.

However, I realize that this ticket changes some `"""` to `r"""` in some cdef and coded functions which are not in the html documentation. Is it really needed ? I assume it does not hurt.
