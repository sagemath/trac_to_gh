Looking at all occurrences of `def gens` in the sagemath source code reveals that the output of the `gens` method is a tuple in the vast majority of cases (including for the class `ParentWithGens` in `src/sage/structure/parent_gens.pyx`). In fact, the final line of the source code of the method is usually `return tuple( <something> )`. However, the search uncovered several exceptions that return a list:

This is **clearly a bug**, because the output type does not match the documentation.

* `SpecialCubicQuotientRing` in `src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py`

Perhaps most (or all) of the above should be changed to a tuple.

An iterator or `Family` is returned in the following cases, but that makes sense because the set of generators may be infinite:
* `SteenrodAlgebra_generic` in `src/sage/algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra.py`
* `HeckeAlgebra_base` and `HeckeAlgebra_anemic` in `src/sage/modular/hecke/algebra.py`
* `OverconvergentModularFormsSpace` in `src/sage/modular/overconvergent/genus0.py`
* `AlgebraicClosureFiniteField_generic` in `src/sage/rings/algebraic_closure_finite_field.py`

This ticket arose fromticket: ticket:34105#comment:4#comment:34105, which pointed out that multivariate polynomials behave differently than single-variable polynomials.
