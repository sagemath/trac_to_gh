#34668 was focusing on making doctests pass but did not test docbuilding.

The following plot in `src/sage/plot/plot.py`

```
    .. PLOT::

        g = plot(2*x+1,(x,0,5),ticks=[[0,1,e,pi,sqrt(20)],2],tick_formatter="latex")
        sphinx_plot(g)
```
is causing the building of the documentation to fail horribly.

Tests of this plot were disabled in #34668 and now we need to remove the plot. The whole example needs to be replaced by something that works.

We could not overcome the problem of symbolic values that numpy rejects, but instead made a fix to circumvent numpy and revived the doctest and the example.

It is clear. We can use symbolic values as tick marks. It is a useful feature. I may use it (though I never did :)

> So, removing it does not seem to be a big deal.

Removing a feature to upgrade a package is a big deal.

I investigated the real cause of the failure. Fortunately I found it. It is a kind of bug in matplotlib 3.6. I reported it to upstream:

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/24557

Let's see how they react before we proceed.

I will investigate the former possibility. We have

```python
sage: a = sqrt(2)
sage: a.is_infinity()
False
``` 
but I don't know how to "add `isfinite` support" to satisfy numpy...

and https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.dtypes.html

Then

```python
class Symbolic(object):
    __array_interface__ = {'typestr': 'f'} 
    
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.num = a
        self.den = b

    def __float__(self):
        return float(self.num / self.den)
    
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import sympy as sym
from matplotlib.ticker import FixedLocator, NullLocator, FuncFormatter

# make data
x = np.linspace(0, 3, 100)
y = 2 * x + 1

# plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.plot(x, y, linewidth=2.0)

a = Symbolic(1,2)

ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(FixedLocator([a, 1, 2, 3]))
ax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(NullLocator())
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: str(x)))

plt.show()
```
works. Moreover

```python
>>> a = Symbolic(2,3)
>>> np.isfinite(a)
True
>>> np.array(a)
array(0.6666667, dtype=float32)
```
Hence so we now know how to make `Expression` float-like (from the perspective of numpy).

To implement this mechanism for `Expression` may require major restructuring, since  the scope of `Expression` is much more broad beyond constant expression. As suggested in the upstream discussion, we may need `ConstantExpression` that would hold only constant values, and make that float-like or complex-like.

It can be `lazy_attributes` or `property`.

But I realized a major problem. By the mechanism, `Symbolic` is simply converted to floats, and you see `0.5` in the plot instead of `1/2`. So this defeats the original purpose! Now it seems to me that we cannot retain the feature (supporting symbolic ticks)...

The rescue is to use matplotlib's `FixedFormatter` to provide strings for the tick values separately. This would amount to reimplementing sage's `tick_formatter="latex"`.

Anyway, implementing this together with `ConstantExpression` seems a daunting task apart from the "worth to do" question.

I don't know how frequently the symbolic tick mark feature is used by sage users. If no one uses it :) then perhaps we may turn off this feature while we upgrade matplotlib to 3.6.

OK. So, it is currently broken and will take some time and efforts to put it right, if there is a will.

In the meantime, the branch removes just a plot showcasing the capability because it breaks building the documentation in sage-on-distros which already have matplotlib 3.6.x available.
Should we comment the plotting code and add reference to a ticket with work in progress or just remove it until things are ready?
