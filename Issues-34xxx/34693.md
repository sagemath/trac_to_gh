#34668 was focusing on making doctests pass but did not test docbuilding.

The following plot in `src/sage/plot/plot.py`

```
    .. PLOT::

        g = plot(2*x+1,(x,0,5),ticks=[[0,1,e,pi,sqrt(20)],2],tick_formatter="latex")
        sphinx_plot(g)
```
is causing the building of the documentation to fail horribly.

Tests of this plot were disabled in #34668 and now we need to remove the plot. The whole example needs to be replaced by something that works.

We could not overcome the problem of symbolic values that numpy rejects, but instead made a fix to circumvent numpy and revived the doctest and the example.

Not sure how I got to attach the wrong branch. Thankfully, I noticed.

It is clear. We can use symbolic values as tick marks. It is a useful feature. I may use it (though I never did :)

> So, removing it does not seem to be a big deal.


Removing a feature to upgrade a package is a big deal.

I investigated the real cause of the failure. Fortunately I found it. It is a kind of bug in matplotlib 3.6. I reported it to upstream:

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/24557

Let's see how they react before we proceed.

I will investigate the former possibility. We have

```python
sage: a = sqrt(2)
sage: a.is_infinity()
False
``` 
but I don't know how to "add `isfinite` support" to satisfy numpy...

Then

```python
class Symbolic(object):
    __array_interface__ = {'typestr': 'f'} 
    
    def __init__(self, a, b):

        self.den = b

from matplotlib.ticker import FixedLocator, NullLocator, FuncFormatter

# make data
x = np.linspace(0, 3, 100)
y = 2 * x + 1

# plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.plot(x, y, linewidth=2.0)

a = Symbolic(1,2)

ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(FixedLocator([a, 1, 2, 3]))
ax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(NullLocator())
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: str(x)))

plt.show()
```
works. Moreover

```python
>>> a = Symbolic(2,3)
>>> np.isfinite(a)
True
>>> np.array(a)
array(0.6666667, dtype=float32)
```
Hence so we now know how to make `Expression` float-like (from the perspective of numpy).

To implement this mechanism for `Expression` may require major restructuring, since  the scope of `Expression` is much more broad beyond constant expression. As suggested in the upstream discussion, we may need `ConstantExpression` that would hold only constant values, and make that float-like or complex-like.

The rescue is to use matplotlib's `FixedFormatter` to provide strings for the tick values separately. This would amount to reimplementing sage's `tick_formatter="latex"`.

Anyway, implementing this together with `ConstantExpression` seems a daunting task apart from the "worth to do" question.
