By the way, I see many messages like this in package log files:

```
      ############################
      # Package would be ignored #
      ############################
      Python recognizes 'terminado._static' as an importable package,
      but it is not listed in the `packages` configuration of setuptools.

      'terminado._static' has been automatically added to the distribution only
      because it may contain data files, but this behavior is likely to change
      in future versions of setuptools (and therefore is considered deprecated).

      Please make sure that 'terminado._static' is included as a package by using
      the `packages` configuration field or the proper discovery methods
      (for example by using `find_namespace_packages(...)`/`find_namespace:`
      instead of `find_packages(...)`/`find:`).

      You can read more about "package discovery" and "data files" on setuptools
      documentation page.
```
(There are lots of hits for "Package would be ignored".) This is unaffected by the update to `setuptools`. Is this something to worry about?
