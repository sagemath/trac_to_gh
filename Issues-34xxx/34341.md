As reported on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/rXZeGZjAIdU):

```
sage: a = x^2 + 2*x + 1
sage: b = (x + 1)^2
sage: c = a != b
sage: bool(c)
True 
```

Note that

```
sage: bool(c.expand())
False
```

This is due to calling `is_trivial_zero` instead
of `is_zero` in the `__bool__` method for symbolic expressions.

The fix provided by this ticket is not intended to fix other existing `bool(expr1 != expr2)` issues (e.g. #33698).
