Two enhancements are proposed to the module sage/combinat/similarity_class_type

1. Given a matrix with entries in a finite field, we 
   should be able to compute its similarity class 
   type.
   {{{
   sage: A = Matrix(GF(2),[[0,1],[0,0]])
   sage: SimilarityClassType(A)
   [This is the Trac macro *1, [2* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1, [2-macro)]
   }}}


2. Given a similarity class type, determine the 
   invariant subspace generating function.
   This is the function where the coefficient of 
   t<sup>j</sup> is the number of invariant subspaces of 
   dimension j. This number is a polynomial in q, 
   the order of the finite field.

   1 + t^4
   }}}
