(split out from #34340)

We equip `ImageSet` with an `_element_constructor_` and hence, with a membership test. (This needs a map with inverse.)

We also add a new parameter value `is_injective='check'`.

I think you should `try`-`except` the call to `self._inverse(x)` as that could fail in many different ways (with the actual error getting lost in the noise). Subsequently, I am not sure of the utility of verifying that it is an inverse versus trusting the user did give an honest inverse.

There is also an infinite recursion that seems to be happening:

```
src/sage/categories/sets_cat.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

Also, calling `len(list(self))` might run for forever if `self` is infinite. I think `list(self)` also does a `__len__` check too. This is also probably related to the infinite recursion above.

Yes, I think that's a good idea

Mapping back is necessary to get an element that is in the correct parent.
The comparison is just a safety check there.
