The use of `std::binary_function` and `std::unary_function` have been deprecated for almost 10 years and gcc-12 is now signalling it. They may be completely removed soon. We get the following warnings when building sage

```

The following files contain offending code

```

There are no instances of `unary_function` in sage.

I did a similar clean up in brial quite recently https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/pull/52/files

OK, that's interesting. So, my patch includes touching one file not in that commit because it is not in that repository. And the commit touches files we do not have in sage. Where they overlap, my job is identical to one white space difference.

So, I think I'll just send my branch and we'll think about synchronisation later because that won't be fun.
