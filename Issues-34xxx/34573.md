The use of `std::binary_function` and `std::unary_function` have been deprecated for almost 10 years and gcc-12 is now signalling it. They may be completely removed soon. We get the following warnings when building sage

```

The following files contain offending code

```

src/sage/symbolic/ginac/ex.h:struct ex_swap : public std::binary_function<ex, ex, void> {
```

There are no instances of `unary_function` in sage.

I did a similar clean up in brial quite recently https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/pull/52/files
