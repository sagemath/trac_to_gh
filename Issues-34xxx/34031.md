Keywords: upgrade,sympy

There is some new functionality that I am interested in from SymPy 1.10.1, but [SageMath](SageMath) uses 1.7.1. Could this upgrade be completed.

Specifically, I am interested in using the control plots: https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/control/control_plots.html
