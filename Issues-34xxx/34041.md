it's a FAQ, how to do this. Should be fixed, and a working solution provided.

one can test this by exporting env.vars
`SAGE_GAP_MEMORY` and/or `SAGE_GAP_COMMAND` (details in the branch`), before testing, e.g. 

```
 $ export SAGE_GAP_MEMORY="500m"
 $ make test
```

I love `sage.env`. In fact, I had my own equivalent of `sage.env` in sage-on-gentoo before there was one in vanilla sage. Of course that doesn't mean you should put anything and everything in there.

Now, I am not really against using `os.getenv` directly in code to change a behavior on the fly. But if you do, it should fall back to a sensible default or nothing if it is not defined. `sage.env` arguably serves as a single stop to collect such variables that ensure consistent use.
