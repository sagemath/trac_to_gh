We add Jacobian groups to algebraic curves over finite fields (via global function fields).

There are two models for Jacobian points arithmetic:  

- Hess model: A point is represented by a divisor (internally represented by a pair of certain ideals) and arithmetic relies on divisor reduction using Riemann-Roch space computation by Hess' algorithm.

- Khuri-Makdisi model: A point is represented by a linear subspace of a linear space and arithmetic uses Khuri-Makdisi's linear algebra algorithms. For implementation, #15113 was referenced.
