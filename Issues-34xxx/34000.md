We provide some cleaning and speed up to the `PolyDict` class by always enforcing keys to be `ETuple` (some parts of the code did assume that was the case). As a consequence we deprecate the usage of the constructor arguments `force_int_exponents` and `force_etuples`.

We also simplify the design by getting rid of `PolyDict.__zero` (and hence deprecating the argument `zero` of the `PolyDict` constructor).

Along the way, we fix

```
sage: R = ZZ['x']['y,z']
sage: y, z = R.gens()
sage: y.integral(y)
1/2*y^2
sage: parent(y.integral(y))
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in y, z over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```
and

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.polydict import ETuple
sage: e = ETuple([0, 1, 0])
sage: e.eadd_p(0, 0).nonzero_positions()
[0, 1]
```

> * in `MPolynomial_polydict.integral()`, why do you have two different code paths for determining the result's parent?

I shamefully copied the code from univariate polynomials, see [polynomial_element.pyx#L3980-L3985](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx#L3980-L3985)

> * what do the `RuntimeError`s now raised by `PolyDict` on various occasions correspond to?

One of them is ensuring that keys are `ETuple`. All others are here because I also made uniform that no coefficient is zero. At least, it did not break any test.

It is really a `RuntimeError` : it is assumed that keys are `ETuple` and coefficients are nonzero.

`@`Xavier Caruso: now that I made systematic zero coefficient removal in `polydict.pyx` I have trouble with Tate algebras. Namely, it seems that you always want to keep zeros there even though there is no natural way we can make difference between exact and inexact zero in the base ring

```
sage: R = Zp(2, print_mode='digits', prec=10)
sage: R(0, 5).is_zero()
True
sage: R(0, 5) == R(0)
True
sage: not (R(0, 5) != R(0))
True
```
This affects code such as

```
sage: R = Zp(2, print_mode='digits', prec=10)
sage: A.<x,y> = TateAlgebra(R)
sage: f = 1 + 64*x
sage: f -= R(1, 5)
sage: f
...00000 + ...0000000001000000*x
```
which now returns `...0000000001000000*x`.

On the other hand, I believe that the code in Tate algebra is buggy for the following reason. The conversion `R -> A` does not commute with binary operations

```
sage: R = Zp(2, print_mode='digits', prec=10)
sage: A.<x,y> = TateAlgebra(R)
sage: A(R(1)) - A(R(1,5))
...00000
sage: A(R(1) - R(1,5))
0
```
The following is also broken

```
sage: A({(1,1): R(0,5)})
0
```
(it should have been `R(0,5)*x*y` which prints as `...00000*x*y`)

The main question is : how do we test whether an element is exactly zero in `R` ? `r.precision_absolute() == infinity and r.is_zero()`? I could introduce an attribute `zero_test` in `PolyDict` to make this check consistently.

hmm as well as multivariate polynomial rings over power series

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: A.<y,z> = R[]
sage: O(x^3) * y
0
```

I think you can use the method `_is_exact_zero` for padics.

I'll have a look at the bug in coercion from base ring to Tate algebra you noticed.

It is not a bug in the coercion system. It is the way elements of the Tate algebra are constructed. The `PolyDict` class does a cleaning of zero coefficients in its input.

As far as this ticket is concerned there is an easy way out : leave simplification of zero coefficients in `PolyDict` to the user (via the `PolyDict.remove_zeros` method). This will solve the construction issues with Tate algebra.

I opened ticket #34024 to fix polynomials.

I think some timings are needed here before a positive review to see what sort of speed regressions we incur because we no longer have the option to turn off certain features and checks.

Why is addition the only operation that gets a special in-place operation? I think it would be good to make this universal.

It is generally not a good ideal to check `if type(e) is not ETuple:`. I understand this is faster than `isinstance(e, ETuple)`, but it is less future-proof if someone subclasses `ETuple`.

Naively coverage seems to have decreased; e.g., `__len__` no longer has documentation. It is a bit of a misdirect that the coverage has increased as it is just total percentage.
