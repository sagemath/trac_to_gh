This is a follow-up to #32786 with the following changes:

- Copy curve orders between domain and codomain for all `EllipticCurveHom` instances of nonzero degree, rather than (previously) just `EllipticCurveIsogeny` objects.
- Copy point orders when pushing a point through an isomorphism.
- Copy point orders when pushing a point through an isogeny of degree coprime to the point order.
- Rearrange some computations in the √élu code (#34303, #34614) to make (better) use of cached orders; in particular, this unbreaks the use of `.set_order()` on the kernel point prior to passing it to `EllipticCurveHom_velusqrt`. [Thanks to Jonathan Komada Eriksen for reporting this last issue.]
