I got an error (accidentelly called the method on the manifold instead of the chart) it looks like something was not implemented:


```
> Chi = M.transition_map(M, [t-r, r, th, ph], name='Chi', latex_name=r'\Chi')

```


```

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
Note that you get to see the trace-back from an error and that python lists source fragments to help analysis. The mention of the attribute is in:

[category_object.pyx:828](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/55a711e3d6251f2ff4f3bcccc4c6a8b7a2a8d1b2/src/sage/structure/category_object.pyx#L828)

which is a doctest. The error messages relevant for you are at the very top `KeyError`, repeated with full error message below its traceback. This error was deep down and caught, and then reraised as an `AttributeError` with a more informative error message; right at the bottom of the traceback.

Python's traceback formatting is still geared towards terminals, so the most important message is repeated at the very bottom, where it won't be scrolled back yet.

The error indicates exactly what's wrong (the attribute is not available on the object) and reflects user error. I think this can be closed as "invalid".
