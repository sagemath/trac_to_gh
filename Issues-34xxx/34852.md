I got an error (accidentelly called the method on the manifold instead of the chart) it looks like something was not implemented:


```
> Chi = M.transition_map(M, [t-r, r, th, ph], name='Chi', latex_name=r'\Chi')

```


```

Python's traceback formatting is still geared towards terminals, so the most important message is repeated at the very bottom, where it won't be scrolled back yet.

The error indicates exactly what's wrong (the attribute is not available on the object) and reflects user error. I think this can be closed as "invalid".
