`Element._test_category` checks `isinstance(self, self.parent().category().element_class`.

Need to generalize `element_class` to `element_classes`

Then we will be able to fix many of the `_test_category` failures that are worked around by marking them as skipped: `git grep 'skip=.*test_category'`

This generalization will also take care of `Parent`s with no element classes (as discussed in #33713)
