```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([(1, 2), (-1, -2)], domain=[0,1,2,-1,-2])
sage: G.domain()
{0, 1, 2, -1, -2}
sage: H = SymmetricGroup([3, 4, 5])
sage: H.domain()
{3, 4, 5}
sage: GH, from_G, from_H, to_G, to_H = G.direct_product(H)
sage: GH.domain()
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
```
When the domains are disjoint, it would be more user-friendly to use the union of the domains as the domain of the result.
