Thanks. Everything looks fine to me. 

I will try to run `maketestlong`. If that works and there are no comments from anyone else, then I will plan to set to positive review tomorrow.

The PR removes the file `.lgtm.yml`, deletes mention of `lgtm` from `src/doc/en/developer/tools.rst`, and fixes some minor spacing issues. None of this should cause problems. This was confirmed by `Build & Test` (which passed), and I ran `make testlong` with no errors.
