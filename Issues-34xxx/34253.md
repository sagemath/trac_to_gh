Thanks for writing this code, it looks very nice! A few comments:

- The test

```diff
+        if E.order() == E.base().order():
```
  can be very expensive if the order of the curve hasn't been computed yet. (Not a very common scenario, but possible by using `.set_order()` on points.)
  Suggestion: Replace by

```python
n == E.base_field().cardinality()
```
  or something like that.

- If I remember correctly, `E.formal_group().log()` is another way to construct the power series underlying this mapping. Perhaps we should add `SEEALSO` cross-references, and/or reuse that method (assuming it doesn't make things slower or otherwise worse)?

- Here

```diff
+        For anomalous curves with `#E = p`, the `padic_elliptic_logarithm`
```
  you can use the syntax

```
:meth:`padic_elliptic_logarithm`
```
   to turn the `padic_elliptic_logarithm` reference into a link in the HTML documentation.

- This change

```diff
-        EXAMPLES::
+        EXAMPLES:

             sage: F = GF((3,6),'a')
```
  is incorrect; the documentation format requires a double colon before an indented block.

Here's an example for which this branch fails to compute `.discrete_log()`:

```sage
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: F.<i> = GF(787^2, modulus=x^2+1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([268*i + 507, 42*i + 772])
```

You could either add an `.is_prime_field()` check, or (better) generalize the code to non-prime finite fields.

(By the way, you should set the ticket to "needs review" once it's ready from your perspective. I looked at this anyway because I didn't notice it was still "new", but in general you will only attract reviewers by setting the correct status.)

I've added the primality test. I have to figure out how to handle the non prime field case. Do you want me to open another ticket for that ?

I think this is incorrect for non-anomalous curves over prime fields: In that case, the first `if` holds (so the `elif` branches are skipped), but for a non-cyclic group we do still have to run the pairing check to ensure there's a solution.

Given that the prime case is already working and useful on its own, I think the non-prime case should go into a new ticket.
