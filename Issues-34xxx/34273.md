Our OpenSUSE system package info leads to the installation of LibreSSL, which is not compatible with the python3 build. 

```
[python3-3.10.6] checking whether compiling and linking against OpenSSL works... yes
[python3-3.10.6] checking for --with-openssl-rpath... 
[python3-3.10.6] checking whether OpenSSL provides required APIs... no
[python3-3.10.6] checking for --with-ssl-default-suites... python
[python3-3.10.6] checking for --with-builtin-hashlib-hashes... md5,sha1,sha256,sha512,sha3,blake2
[python3-3.10.6] checking for --with-experimental-isolated-subinterpreters... no
[python3-3.10.6] checking for --with-static-libpython... yes
[python3-3.10.6] checking for --disable-test-modules... no
[python3-3.10.6] configure: creating ./config.status
```

Our configure script does not know that.

We update the distro file and add an additional check to openssl spkg-configure.m4

To test: `tox -e docker-opensuse-tumbleweed-standard -- V=1 python3`

The crucial line in python3's configure output is this:

What happened there is that Python did not build the `_ssl` module because it did not find a suitable openssl. Python reports this with the message "Could not build the ssl module!" This is only an info message.

Our script https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/pkgs/python3/spkg-build.in#L120 then checks again for the required modules and exits with an error.

I would say it is not necessary to do more testing than what our build script does.

Okay. Now I understand the situation better. So the success of the tox test has shown that your branch works well (otherwise python build script would have failed). 

The relevant github workflow is still running. So let us wait for the result to double-check.
