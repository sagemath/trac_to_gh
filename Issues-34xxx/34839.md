tox 4 renamed a tox.ini configuration keyword and has slightly changed quoting behavior.
 
Also tox >= 3.18 supports the renamed keyword - https://tox.wiki/en/3.27.1/changelog.html#v3-18-0-2020-07-23

Also the changed quote works with both versions.

The linter is finding rst issues outside of src/sage. Is this the desired behaviour ?

By the way, one should rather fix these issues.
