Part of #33833. Fix

- "ERROR: Adding a table of contents in Furo-based documentation is unnecessary" - https://73e5aa3fbbec2d751a47064c14479fc0d55c3de9--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/source.html#installation-in-a-multiuser-environment

We add `:class:` like

```
.. contents::
   :class: this-will-duplicate-information-and-it-is-still-useful-here
```
to remove the furo's warning, since those toc's are useful for pdf docs and not bad even for html docs.

Depends on #34252
