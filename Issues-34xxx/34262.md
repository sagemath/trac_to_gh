Part of #33833. Fix

- "ERROR: Adding a table of contents in Furo-based documentation is unnecessary" - https://73e5aa3fbbec2d751a47064c14479fc0d55c3de9--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/installation/source.html#installation-in-a-multiuser-environment

We add `:class:` like

```
.. contents::
   :class: this-will-duplicate-information-and-it-is-still-useful-here
```
to remove the furo's warning, since those toc's are useful for pdf docs and not bad even for html docs.

Depends on #34252

Would it be possible to only display the toc in the pdf? In my opinion, they just duplicate information that is already displayed in the right column.

They are duplicated but often a short version of the full toc on the right column, and hence they are still useful. So I think it is not worth the effort to try to find a way to show them only in the pdf.
