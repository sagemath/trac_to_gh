From `@`saraedum on zulip:
 I am building [SageMath](SageMath) from source following the guide that uses conda packages. I find that pip install --no-build-isolation -v -v --editable src always recompiles all the extension modules.

As a fix for Sage 9.7, we set an upper bound for setuptools that excludes the new editable wheels feature introduced in 64.0.0. See #34344, #34209 for follow-ups
