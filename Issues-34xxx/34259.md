This branch deprecates a bunch of import statements in `sage.misc.all`. It leaves intact `cputime` and `walltime`, but it changes some doctests by explicitly importing them, in case we do eventually want to deprecate them. There are one or two places where `cputime` was called but not used, and those have been removed. The branch also changes `from sage.all import *` in `sage.tests.benchmark` to explicit import statements.
