The following don't currently build on various platforms â€” see https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/2777704587:
- `symengine_py` #34141
- `p_group_cohomology` #30787
- `r_jupyter`
The following don't build for me on OS X 12.5:
- `polylib` #33758
- `barvinok`: depends on `polylib`
This ticket downgrades these from optional to experimental.

rubiks is fixed in #34293

I agree that `polylib` can be downgraded to experimental. Then also `barvinok` should be downgraded because it depends on `polylib`.
