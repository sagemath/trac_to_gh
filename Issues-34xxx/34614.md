The `EllipticCurveHom_velusqrt` class introduced in #34303 inherits from `EllipticCurveHom` (#32388, #32502), but it doesn't yet implement all of the required methods. In this patch, we add them.

<a id='comment:8'></a>I made minor edits. 

I took this opportunity to move the method `as_morphism()` to the class `EllipticCurveHom` so that it works with √élu isogenies. The method may be useful to check elliptic curve morphisms, though it is reasonably fast only for small examples.

One remark: There are notes like 

```
    def rational_maps(self):
        r"""
        Return the pair of explicit rational maps of this √élu isogeny
        as fractions of bivariate polynomials in `x` and `y`.

        .. NOTE::

            The data returned by this method has size linear in the degree.

        EXAMPLES::  
```   
The meaning of the note is obscure to me. How is the size of the data measured? If the data is a polynomial, then it may mean "the degree of the returned polynomial is linear in the degree of the isogeny". In this case, the data is two rational functions. You need to be explicit about what is the "size" of rational functions. I suggest that you rewrite the notes or remove them (as they are, the notes are not so useful).

It's literally the size of the object, as in "bytes of memory it takes to store".

The purpose of these remarks is to point out that merely writing down the result of calling these methods already requires time `Ω(ℓ)`, which means the √élu speedup (complexity `Õ(√ℓ)`) cannot apply to them. Perhaps that point should be made clearer.

Okay.

I now see what you mean by the note. Then if you want to keep those notes, I suggest that you write this explanation (implication) for these notes, once and for all, at the head of the file `hom_velusqrt.py`. Non-experts need the explanation.

Otherwise I am positive to the branch.
