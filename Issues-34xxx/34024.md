The design choice made for p-adics and power series is that `O(p^n)` and `O(x^n)` behave similarly to zero in comparisons. All of
- `a.is_zero()`
- `not a`
- `a == a.parent().zero()`
- `not (a != a.parent().zero()`
answer `True` for `O(p^n)` or `O(x^n)`

```
sage: a = O(2^3)
sage: a.is_zero()
True
sage: a.is_zero() and not a and a == a.parent().zero() and not (a != a.parent().zero())
True
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: a = O(x^3)
sage: a.is_zero() and not a and a == a.parent().zero() and not (a != a.parent().zero())
True
```

As a consequence, the generic implementation of uni-variate and multi-variate polynomials are broken on those rings (as it does remove terms whose coefficients are zero).

```
sage: Z2 = Zp(2)
sage: R.<x,y> = Z2[]
sage: R(1) - R(1)
0
sage: Z2(1) - Z2(1)
O(2^20)
```

Depends on #34000

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

My personal feeling is that `bool(a)` should be equivalent to "a is not exact zero".
