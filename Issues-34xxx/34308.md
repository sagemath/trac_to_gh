hello Travis,

I am just trying to get rid of the gap pexpect interface here. I am surprised that I finally managed to do that (it must be my third or fourth tentative).

I am not sure it is worth optimising further. The whole abelian group setup is IMHO a complete mess, that would deserve a complete rewriting.

Of course. I was just wondering if there was something specific behind this choice.
