We introduce a parent class for `Components`, called `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis` (although it won't be a module yet as of this ticket). 

We move symmetry attributes, frame, and output formatter there.

This is a step toward #30307.

The basis is fixed, and a `Components` instance does not even know which indices are covariant and which are contravariant positions, so I don't think any claims how things transform are made.

This module would be just like a `FreeModule` or a `MatrixSpace`. Note that a matrix also does not know how it should transform - whether as the matrix of a linear map or as the matrix of a quadratic form.

To add to this, the information how things transform is stored in the morphism from the `TensorFreeModule` to the `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis`, not in the module.

In the context of some of the other recent tickets: This morphism is exactly the `isomorphism_with_fixed_basis` (#34427).

Indeed, but the very name `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis` suggests that we are dealing with the components of a tensor on a free module, while the connection coefficients are no such thing. In particular, the set of affine connections on a given manifold is usually not endowed with a module structure: there is no meaning in adding two affine connections, and the multiplication by an element of the (potential) base ring --- the algebra of smooth scalar fields, would not lead to another affine connection.

Yes, that's clear. The "matrix" point of view should be the one to adopt here. For the case of the connection coefficients, the module operations would have no meaning for the affine connections they come from, but this is OK, i.e. these operations will simply not be used in that case (there is no addition nor scalar multiplication defined at the level of `AffineConnection`).

OK, this is a great point, thank you. Now I remember #30245, which goes in a similar direction. The presence of these automatically provided addition and multiplication operations can indeed be misleading in such situations.

It would be worthwhile to think about whether we should make it possible to create a `MatrixSpace` or `TensorFreeModuleWithBasis` in a larger category than `ModulesWithBasis`, perhaps just `Sets`, and in that case use an element class that does not provide the module operations (`_add_`, `_lmul_` etc.)

It looks less severe here than in #30245: as you pointed out, the connection coefficients in a given basis can be considered as elements of a tensor module and one can performed module operations of them (after all, the class `Components` defines `__add__` and `__rmul__`), simply these operations do not correspond to operations on the connections themselves, so that they will not be used in an actual code.

Given the remark above, I would say it is fine to stay with the category `ModulesWithBasis`.

A possible concern about moving to the `Parent/Element` scheme is about the efficiency with respect to the pure array-like structure. The class `Components` is at the root of the calculus on manifolds and one should make sure that introducing parents does now yield some significant slow down. But this is something we can check and benchmark.

Ah I see, you let the parent handle the frames. Then, at least mathematically, it should be fine.

But from the programming viewpoint I see a problem with `UniqueRepresentation`. The nice thing about the current implementation (and also the curse for maintenance) is that frames can flexibly be added. If the parent's signature is determined by the list of frames, we run into troubles when we want to add another one at a later point.

Moreover, I think we can get rid of a lot of code redundancies w.r.t. frames/bases.

What do you think?

Ah! That's clever. Then I agree with everything that was said.

(Otherwise it's also not a module...!)

Thank you for the clarification.

Yes, I'm preparing the sheafy stuff in #34398, #34461
