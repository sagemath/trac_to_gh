Keywords: Clifford

This is a really bad associativity failure:

```
sage: r = ZZ['r'].fraction_field().gen()
sage: Q = QuadraticForm(r.parent(), 2, [0,r,0])
sage: C.<p,q> = CliffordAlgebra(Q)
sage: q * (p * q)
r*q
sage: (q * p) * q
-r*p*q + r^2
```

Okay, it is a very special case. It was checking that the first element of the LHS when the RHS was single monomial. In this example, the first returned term happened to be the constant term, so it thought it just needed to multiply the LHS by that scalar. So it actually is not so bad of a bug, just a special case.
