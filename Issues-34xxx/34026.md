This ticket corresponds to the Merge Request ​https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/-/merge_requests/57.

This ticket contains implementations for the Iwasawa and Cartan decompositions for square matrices over non-archimedean local fields.

It was originally part of ​https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30690, which later became ​https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33404. In order to make the reviewing process easier, this ticket contains only some of the decompositions from the original ticket. The remaining decompositions (Bruhat-Iwahori, TSB and Bruhat) have been moved to another ticket (​https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34027).

Notes and Issues:

* In the above decompositions, Some of the returned matrices could be defined over the integer-ring of the field, but I did not coerce them into the integer-ring, because of the bug described at: #29931.
* To prevent any of the above decompositions from making changes to the original matrix, I relied on the fact that the matrix_over_field method returns a deep copy of the original matrix (even when the original is already defined over a field).
* A point for consideration: as padics and formal laurent-series over finite fields are both non-archimedean local fields, I needed to make sure that the implemented methods work for both. Having a more uniform API for padics and laurent-series could be helpful in avoiding awkward nested functions that fit different implementations for each type. For example, for getting the unit-part of an element, I had to use the unit_part method for padics, and valuation_zero_part for laurent.

Keywords: **padics, formal laurent series, decomposition**

This ticket contains implementations for the Iwasawa and Cartan decompositions for square matrices over non-archimedean local fields. \\ 
It was originally part of #30690, which later became #33404. In order to make the reviewing process easier, this ticket contains only some of the decompositions from the original ticket. The remaining decompositions (Bruhat-Iwahori, TSB and Bruhat) have been moved to another ticket (https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34027).\\

Notes and Issues:

1. In the above decompositions, Some of the returned matrices could be defined over the integer-ring of the field, but I did not coerce them into the integer-ring, because of the bug described at: #29931.
2. To prevent any of the above decompositions from making changes to the original matrix, I relied on the fact that the matrix_over_field method returns a deep copy of the original matrix (even when the original is already defined over a field).
3. A point for consideration: as padics and formal laurent-series over finite fields are both non-archimedean local fields, I needed to make sure that the implemented methods work for both. Having a more uniform API for padics and laurent-series could be helpful in avoiding awkward nested functions that fit different implementations for each type. For example, for getting the unit-part of an element, I had to use the unit_part method for padics, and valuation_zero_part for laurent.
