From Python 3.8, the //start// parameter of the built-in function `sum` can be given as a keyword argument. For instance:
 
```python
>>> sum([1,2,3], start=1)
7
>>> sum([[1],[2]], start=[])
[1, 2]
```

Sage's `symbolic_sum`, imported as `sum` and overwriting the original `sum`, does not pass this keyword argument. Hence in Sage:

```python
>>> sum([1,2,3], start=1)
6
>>> sum([[1],[2]], start=[])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'list'
```


Keywords: sum
