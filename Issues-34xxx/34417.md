Things look fine up until the `fast_map_common_subexp()` call in `singular_polynomial_call()` in `src/sage/libs/singular/polynomial.pyx`. Either the arguments are set up wrong somehow, or it might be a Singular bug?

I'm not sure what's going on, but I wasn't able to reproduce the problem directly in singular:

```
sage: singular_console()
