```
sage: R.<z> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = z[1] + z[1]*z[2]*z[3]
sage: f.subs({z[1]:z[0]})

There are some bad behaviors that this implements:

- It forces the inputs to be in the polynomial ring. I should be able to substitute anything I want where the computation makes such, such as square matrices. This should be a simple redirection.
- It forces the output to be in the infinite polynomial ring. Instead, the output should be the common parent of the input and the base ring.

The "standard" thing to do is redirect everything through `__call__` after parsing the inputs a bit, and probably should be done here too. Although I am a bit tempted to just instead do a simple redirect to `self._p.subs(*args, **kwds)`. Actually, there probably is a general problem of not expanding the input polynomial to be large enough to handle the input.

```
sage: f(x_10=f)
KeyError
sage: f(x_2=f)
x_3^2*x_2*x_1^2 + x_3*x_1^2 + x_1
sage: x[12]  # make it big enough
x_12
sage: f(x_10=f)
x_3*x_2*x_1 + x_1
```
Probably the input parsing of `subs` and `__call__` should be refactored out into a helper method, and then both of these methods redirect to their finite polynomial counterparts.

LGTM. positive review.

Almost unrelated to this ticket, already in the `__call__` method we can substitute all variables from a "finite" polynomial ring:

```sage
sage: R.<x> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: S.<z, w> = QQ[]
sage: f = x[1] + x[1]*x[2]*x[3]
sage: f(x_1=w, x_2=z^2+1, x_3=z)
z^3*w + z*w + w
```

But it is a pity we do not have a canonical coercion when substituting only some of the variables:

```sage
sage: f(x_1=w)
[...]
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Multivariate Polynomial Ring in z, w over Rational Field to Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x_5, x_4, x_3, x_2, x_1, x_0 over Rational Field

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
[...]
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x_5, x_4, x_3, x_2, x_1, x_0 over Rational Field' and 'Multivariate Polynomial Ring in z, w over Rational Field'
```

Sorry for not being able to review this sooner.

A few things need to be addressed before a positive review from me.

Some doc changes:

```diff
-        Substitute variables in an infinite polynomial.
+        Substitute variables in ``self``.
 
         INPUT:
 
-        - ``fixed`` - (optional) dict with variable:value pairs
-        - ``**kwargs`` - names parameters
-        - ``fixed`` -- (optional) ``dict`` with ``{variable:value}`` pairs
-        - ``**kwargs`` -- named parameters
 
         OUTPUT:
-            a new polynomial
+
+        the resulting substitution
```

```diff
-If you want to substitute variables more generally, use the ``.subs``
-method::
+If you want to substitute variables, you can use the
+standard polynomial methods, such as
+:meth:`~sage.rings.polynomial.infinite_polynomial_element.InfinitePolynomial_sparse.subs`::
```

This documentation is not quite correct and make this change:

```diff
-       The substitution can also handle matrices. It will
-       return a matrix whose entries are polynomials in countably
-       many variables::
+       The substitution can also handle matrices::
```
It is more complicated than that as it does the substitution and then does the addition by coercion. You can check things by looking at the parent of the outputs (or doing additional substitutions).

This sentence seems incomplete:

```
        Passing ``fixed={x[1]: x[0]}``. Note that the keys::

            sage: f.subs({x[1]: x[0]})
            x_3*x_2*x_0 + x_0
```

I am not sure I would want to prohibit the mixing of the two types of inputs. I would just do `kwargs.update(fixed)`, which would be in line with what (some) other implementations do:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: x.subs({x:1})
1
sage: x.subs(x=5)
5
sage: x.subs({x:1}, x=5)
1
```
