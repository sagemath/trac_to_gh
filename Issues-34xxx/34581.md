Add the ability to substitute variables in `InfinitePolynomialRing`.

```
sage: R.<z> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = z[1] + z[1]*z[2]*z[3]
sage: f.subs({z[1]:z[0]})
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are some bad behaviors that this implements:

- It forces the inputs to be in the polynomial ring. I should be able to substitute anything I want where the computation makes such, such as square matrices. This should be a simple redirection.
- It forces the output to be in the infinite polynomial ring. Instead, the output should be the common parent of the input and the base ring.

The "standard" thing to do is redirect everything through `__call__` after parsing the inputs a bit, and probably should be done here too. Although I am a bit tempted to just instead do a simple redirect to `self._p.subs(*args, **kwds)`. Actually, there probably is a general problem of not expanding the input polynomial to be large enough to handle the input.

```
sage: f(x_10=f)
KeyError
sage: f(x_2=f)
x_3^2*x_2*x_1^2 + x_3*x_1^2 + x_1
sage: x[12]  # make it big enough
x_12
sage: f(x_10=f)
x_3*x_2*x_1 + x_1
```
Probably the input parsing of `subs` and `__call__` should be refactored out into a helper method, and then both of these methods redirect to their finite polynomial counterparts.
