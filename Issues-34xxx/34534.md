(split out from a discussion in #33713)

Sometimes an `Element` should be simultaneously a `Parent`. For example I would like to have 
a semigroup (parent) of polyhedra (element), but each polyhedron is also a parent whose element class is a point.
There are 3 separate categories involved: 
- Semigroups
- Join of Topological Spaces, Elements of semigroups 
- Elements of Topological Spaces

We also clarify the mathematical meaning of `Parent`.

I changed the ticket description to have more neutral languange.

Matthias's definition based on the claim that a `Parent` has overly simplified its description:

> Following the central role of morphisms in modern mathematics, we clarify that definitionally, a `Parent` is that which is suitable to be a domain or codomain of a `Morphism`.


The current definition in the docstring:

> Parents are the Sage/mathematical analogues of container objects in computer science.


My supporting evidence for this is within `Parent` there are many things that support the fact that it should be treated as set-like:

- This doc:

  ```
        .. TODO::

            Eventually, category should be
            :class:`~sage.categories.sets_cat.Sets` by default.
  ```
- There are lots of specialized methods and attributes within the class specifically designed for dealing with elements. Including a documented invariant involving the elements.
- `_test_category` explicitly calls `_test_an_element`
- The default `__call__` returns a `NotImplementedError` if there is no `_element_constructor`.
- There is a default `__contains__` method.
- It implements the framework for actions on its elements.

Thus, I propose that `CategoryObject` becomes the new base class for `Parent` and `Element`, moving methods down to `Parent` that do not make sense for general objects in an abstract category.

- `Element` already has a dedicated category, and `CategoryObject`'s doc says that it is a base class for all objects in a category.
- This would allow for `Map` to also be defined between elements by replacing `Parent _codomain` with `CategoryObject _codomain` and should not affect any time-critical sections of code. (We can already create homsets between elements.)
- It allows for more abstract small categories without reimplementing `Parent` as a subclass of `Category` (which is mostly designed for code abstraction). (This is also wanted in #33713.)
- Furthermore, it reinforces the difference between `SageObject` and a general object in a category.
- It brings the implementation of `Element` and `Parent` closer together, which will make it easier for the eventual goal of this ticket.
- It is not an invasive change while separating the concern of a `Parent` having elements, `Category` to avoid the combinatorial explosion of classes, and a general object in a category.

One potential thing to discuss (that does not need to be resolved here): Should the result of `Element.category()` in a small category be the `Parent`? This would be natural since we want to think of the `Parent` as also being a (mathematical) category. However, this could have different behavior (and lead to implementation issues with, e.g., `Hom`) and make it impossible for the category framework to work correctly with something that is both a `Parent` and `Element`.

"set-like" needs clarification. This is a term that is used in Python but it has no clear mathematical meaning.

This looks cherry-picked to me. For example, `Parent` has:

```
    # This probably should go into Sets().Parent
    @lazy_attribute
    def element_class(self):
```
So clearly someone thought that `Parent` should be suitable for something that is not in `Sets`.

Some other points:

- `Parent` is explicitly calling `_set_element_constructor` in its `__init__`
- The element-based methods as part of its pickling.
- Many of the methods are related to coercion/conversion that operate on elements of the `Parent` (we can debate whether or not it should do this (and it maybe shouldn’t), but right now its implementation does depend on this because it uses `an_element`; see also `Parent.coerce`), and there are many default methods that make it act set-like (e.e.g, `__contains__` and `an_element`).
- The “how to build a new parent” thematic tutorials, essentially say “copy what these other parents do,” which all have `Element`.

This should cover at least half of the methods of `Parent`, if not much more.

Even allowing your argument that it is cherry-picked, that is saying that we should have a subclass for this. Now I agree with your implicit argument that it should be sufficient to inherit from `Sets()`, which is how you can separate things that should go into `Sets()` and having a default category of `Sets()` that isn’t a `Sets().or_subcategory(category)` (which I would argue is what was intended by that comment since that puts additional mathematical data to the programming object). However, there are many time critical parts of Sage that rely on this being very fast, so we need an explicit Cython subclass rather than a dynamically created Python subclass through the category framework.

The original authors decided to implement the necessary fast Cython stuff via hooks. I wouldn't know why suddenly subclassing would be needed.

Let's take a look at the `base_ring()` method as something very concrete. This is something that is not needed by all `Parent`s (e.g., `Partitions`) and has a `None` return type that needs to be checked against:

```
sage: Partitions().base_ring() is None
True
```
It is something that should actually be an `@abstract_method` in the `Modules` category, but we cannot do that with the default implementation returning `self._base`, which defaults to `None`. However, it needs to be very fast as it is called a lot by tight-loop polynomial code, and many times bypassed to get `_base` with an assumption that it is not `None`. If I had time, I would separate this out as `Parent_with_base` and make the necessary class inheritance changes.

Is this refactoring strictly necessary, no. However, it is technical debt and tab completion pollution and we cannot simply test if a class has a base ring (so picking out, say, all modules and Lie groups is more complicated).

While it does make sense for methods to fail, I think that should be input dependent (e.g., trying to construct an element when a scheme has no points), not implementation dependent (`Partitions` will never have a base ring, no matter what input it takes).

I would instead propose to move the cdef attribute `_parent` to `CategoryObject` (or alternatively to `Parent` -- I don't have a strong opinion on this, given that there are no real current uses of non-`Parent` `CategoryObject`s.)

The one additional cdef attribute in `CategoryObject` or `Parent` is a very mild change, and it would make the structure layouts compatible, so that we can implement parents that have parents / elements that have elements.

To clarify, after the proposed change, `Element` would still have the `_parent` cdef attribute. `CategoryObject` would be changed so that it has the `_parent` cdef too.
For example, this could be done by having both `Element` and `CategoryObject` subclass from a new class `SageObjectWithParent` that provides this cdef attribute.
