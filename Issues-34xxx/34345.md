For these methods, since we are adding them, it would be better if they were generators that iterated through the different strips. (I wanted to do this for the other methods, but I didn't want to deal with the backwards incompatibility.) So instead of `res.append(foo)`, it would be `yield foo`.

Why the change in order (`horizontal` then `vertical`)? It would be better to be consistent.

In the vertical strip, you can move the creation of `tmp` outside of the `for` loop.
