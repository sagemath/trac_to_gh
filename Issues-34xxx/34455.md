Bug: 

```
sage: V = ZZ^3
sage: U = V.submodule([[1, 2, 3], [1, 1, 1]])
sage: U
sage: u = U([2, 3, 4])
sage: u.monomial_coefficients()
{0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 4}
```
This is incorrect - by definition of `monomial_coefficients`, basis indices are mapped to coefficients; but

```
sage: u.parent().basis()
[
(1, 0, -1),
(0, 1, 2)
]
```

We also add a method `_test_monomial_coefficients` to run some tests on this and related methods of `ModulesWithBasis`.

Now we can do it with

```
U.coordinate_vector(u)
```
(made into a `dict`). We just get a bit of a performance penalty for this. However, this will have a different output than `u.dict()`, which probably benefits us as we can raise a deprecation warning for the places that are relying on the old functionality.

I don't think anything explicitly is relying on this, but I am just a bit worried about some idempotent construction might implicitly be doing it (such as `U(u.monomial_coefficients())`). I am pretty sure it is fine though.

I don't understand the failure related to `BruhatTitsHarmonicCocycleElement`. It looks to me like a genuine bug::

```
sage: X = BruhatTitsQuotient(31,7)
sage: H = X.harmonic_cocycles(2,prec=10)
sage: v = H.basis()[0]
sage: bool(v)
True
sage: v.monomial_coefficients()
{}
```

The output of that monomial coefficients is explicitly set to be `{}`. The doc says it is the comply with pickling for some reason. This makes no sense to me. I agree this is a bug.

It seems to be easy to fix: We change

```python
def monomial_coefficients(self, copy=True):
    return self.__element.monomial_coefficients(copy=copy)
```
(or `self.element()`).
