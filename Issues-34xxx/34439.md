Currently, the `WeierstrassIsomorphism` class doesn't actually specify how the isomorphism given by a tuple `(u,r,s,t)` is defined.
While this is fairly standard, it can't hurt to make it more explicit in the documentation, hence this very simple patch.

(The related `baseWI` class does show the coordinate transform, but it's written in the form corresponding more easily to the inverse isomorphism, and the change in curve models is not shown.)

Component: **elliptic curves**

Sage documentation does not show the docstring of the class `__init__` method. Hence your additional documentation reads incomplete. See

https://7e5829a3e3def0e2863ffb3edb2c324be073d1ac--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/arithmetic_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/weierstrass_morphism.html#module-sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.weierstrass_morphism

I suggest to move the docstring of `__init__` to the class docstring and combine with your docstring (except TESTS blocks). You can use the class `ProjectiveCurve`

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/schemes/curves/projective_curve.py

as a template.

As I skim through elliptic curves modules, I see that many of them need similar edits.
