Currently, the `WeierstrassIsomorphism` class doesn't actually specify how the isomorphism given by a tuple `(u,r,s,t)` is defined.
While this is fairly standard, it can't hurt to make it more explicit in the documentation, hence this very simple patch.

(The related `baseWI` class does show the coordinate transform, but it's written in the form corresponding more easily to the inverse isomorphism, and the change in curve models is not shown.)

Sage documentation does not show the docstring of the class `__init__` method. Hence your additional documentation reads incomplete. See

https://7e5829a3e3def0e2863ffb3edb2c324be073d1ac--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/arithmetic_curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/weierstrass_morphism.html#module-sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.weierstrass_morphism

I suggest to move the docstring of `__init__` to the class docstring and combine with your docstring (except TESTS blocks). You can use the class `ProjectiveCurve`

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/schemes/curves/projective_curve.py

as a template.

As I skim through elliptic curves modules, I see that many of them need similar edits.
