The tox.ini files in pkgs/*/ are broken with tox 4.

Early versions of tox 4.0.x have additional defects.

- https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/discussions/2699#discussioncomment-4403536 - factors no longer work in `passenv` - fixed in tox 4.0.13

- negated factors in `deps`, like `!pipenv-!norequirements: -rrequirements.txt` do not work - https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/2747 - fixed in tox 4.0.15

And autoprovisioning for downgrade to tox 3 is not working - https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/2634

Here we update affected `tox.ini` files so that they work both with suitable versions of tox 3 and tox 4. We change the tox `spkg-configure.m4` to check for such versions.


Follow up: #34840 Upgrade tox to 4.x
