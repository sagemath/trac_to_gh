Since #23986, Sage calls PARI's `qfbclassno()` to compute the class number of a quadratic order. However, the documentation for that PARI function says:

> [...] this function only implements part of Shanks's method (which allows to speed it up considerably). It gives unconditionnally correct results for |D| < 2.10ยนโฐ, but may give incorrect results for larger values if the class group has many cyclic factors. We thus recommend to double-check results using the function quadclassunit [...]

Thus, Sage should probably default to `quadclassunit()` and only use `qfbclassno()` if `proof=False` is set.
