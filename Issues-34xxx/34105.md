The following code produces `ZeroDivisionError`:

```
K.<x,y> = AA[]
K.ideal([]).reduce(x+1)
```

Interestingly, the error goes away if `K.<x,y> = AA[]` is replaced with `K.<x> = AA[]` or with `K.<x,y> = QQ[]`.

so the generic code in `sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py` probably chokes on a zero generator. The behaviour of `I.gens()` is the same for `QQ[]`, so I suspect the reduction code should simply skip over zero generators to be consistent with the other backends.

Btw, it's not directly related to this bug report, but I see a discrepancy in `.gens()` for univariate and multivariate ideals. In the former case, it returns a tuple and the latter case it returns a list:


```
sage: K.<x> = QQ[]
....: K.ideal().gens()
(0,)
sage: K.<x,y> = QQ[]
....: K.ideal().gens()
[0]

```

Shouldn't it be always a tuple?

Thanks for your comments! 

The code looked unpythonic to me, and I wasn't thinking about performance.  Indeed, I don't know python well enough to understand most performance issues, but I can understand that having `I = list(I)` outside of the loop is more efficient. 

Instead of `for gi in I:`, the code let `lI = len(I)` (outside of the loop) and then used the very unpythonic

```
for i in range(lI):
    gi = I[i]
```
I suppose that is also for performance (because the compiler does not know that the length of `I` is constant), so I reverted that change, too.

Part of the reason I made changes is that `p -= quot*I[i]` seemed poor.  Even though my other attempts at improvement should be reverted, it seems to me this should be changed to `p -= quot * gi`. (Indeed, `gi` was specifically defined to be a more efficient replacement for `I[i]`.) But I am not fluent in python, so I will certainly do whatever you think is best about this.

(PS: I also rebased on 9.7b5 and fixed a whitespace issue -- I had spaces at the start of three blank lines.)

Changing `I[i]` to `gi` is certainly an improvement.

On the other hand, I think that this `if gilm and P.monomial_divides(gilm, plm):` is not a real solution of the issue. As `gilm` is the leading monomial of a polynomial, it should be nonzero by definition, and it should not be necessary to check if it is so.  

The real problem is that `R.zero_ideal().gens()` returns the list of a zero polynomial. Mathematically zero (polynomial) is never a generator. Hence the proper solution would be to fix the `gens()` method of the ideal so that it returns an empty tuple (or list) for a zero ideal.

It is surprising to me that sage still has this bug, thinking the maturity of sage...

I don't agree that this is a bug or mathematical error (because I seem to use terminology differently than you do), but the documentation should be clarified.  For me, a generating set of an ideal is analogous to a spanning set of a vector space: there is no assumption that the set is irredundant or does not contain zero.

The docstring of `I.gens` says: "This is usually the set of generators provided during object creation" and I think that is the right thing to do, because it is very fast, and simplifying the list of generators could be expensive. (Probably the method `gens_reduced` should provide a good generating set, instead of just wrapping `gens`.)  For example, I think the following output is fine:

```
sage: K.<x,y> = AA[]
sage: K.ideal([x, x^2, 0, 0, x*y]).gens()
[x, x^2, 0, 0, x*y]
```

On the other hand, the docstring of `I.gens` also says "Return a set of generators / a basis of this ideal." I think the mention of "a basis" is confusing and should be deleted.  I don't know even know what it means to say that a set is a "basis" of an ideal, but I notice that ideals have a `basis` method that is a wrapper for `gens`.

A related issue is that I'm not so sure that the zero polynomial has a leading monomial:

```
sage: K(0).lm()
0
```
Perhaps this should return `None` (or raise `ValueError`), but returning `0` does seem reasonable.

> I forgot to mention a point on which I think we agree: the `gens` of the ideal generated by `[]` should be `[]`, not `[0]`.


Yes. The zero ideal is generated by an empty set of generators. Hence `R.zero_ideal().gens()` should always return an empty tuple.

It may be related with the fact that `K(0).lm()` returns `0`. I think it is also reasonable that this would raise an error.

For this ticket, we may skip `gi` if it is a zero polynomial, instead of checking `gilm` is nonzero, if we allow a zero generator but assume leading monomial is nonzero.

Setting zero element as the sole generator for a zero ideal seems pervasive in sage. 

The simplest solution for this ticket seems removing zeros for reduction.

Yes, thanks for making the change. It is better than my original fix.

The patchbot failures are known random failures (#32773 and #33907) so I consider the patchbot to be green.
