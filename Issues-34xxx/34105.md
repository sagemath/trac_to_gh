The following code produces `ZeroDivisionError`:

```
K.<x,y> = AA[]
K.ideal([]).reduce(x+1)
```

Interestingly, the error goes away if `K.<x,y> = AA[]` is replaced with `K.<x> = AA[]` or with `K.<x,y> = QQ[]`.

```

<a id='comment:8'></a>Thanks for your comments! 

The code looked unpythonic to me, and I wasn't thinking about performance.  Indeed, I don't know python well enough to understand most performance issues, but I can understand that having `I = list(I)` outside of the loop is more efficient. 

Instead of `for gi in I:`, the code let `lI = len(I)` (outside of the loop) and then used the very unpythonic

```
for i in range(lI):
    gi = I[i]
```
I suppose that is also for performance (because the compiler does not know that the length of `I` is constant), so I reverted that change, too.

Part of the reason I made changes is that `p -= quot*I[i]` seemed poor.  Even though my other attempts at improvement should be reverted, it seems to me this should be changed to `p -= quot * gi`. (Indeed, `gi` was specifically defined to be a more efficient replacement for `I[i]`.) But I am not fluent in python, so I will certainly do whatever you think is best about this.

(PS: I also rebased on 9.7b5 and fixed a whitespace issue -- I had spaces at the start of three blank lines.)

<a id='comment:10'></a>I don't agree that this is a bug or mathematical error (because I seem to use terminology differently than you do), but the documentation should be clarified.  For me, a generating set of an ideal is analogous to a spanning set of a vector space: there is no assumption that the set is irredundant or does not contain zero.

The docstring of `I.gens` says: "This is usually the set of generators provided during object creation" and I think that is the right thing to do, because it is very fast, and simplifying the list of generators could be expensive. (Probably the method `gens_reduced` should provide a good generating set, instead of just wrapping `gens`.)  For example, I think the following output is fine:

```
sage: K.<x,y> = AA[]
sage: K.ideal([x, x^2, 0, 0, x*y]).gens()
[x, x^2, 0, 0, x*y]
```

On the other hand, the docstring of `I.gens` also says "Return a set of generators / a basis of this ideal." I think the mention of "a basis" is confusing and should be deleted.  I don't know even know what it means to say that a set is a "basis" of an ideal, but I notice that ideals have a `basis` method that is a wrapper for `gens`.

A related issue is that I'm not so sure that the zero polynomial has a leading monomial:

```
sage: K(0).lm()
0
```
Perhaps this should return `None` (or raise `ValueError`), but returning `0` does seem reasonable.

Yes. The zero ideal is generated by an empty set of generators. Hence `R.zero_ideal().gens()` should always return an empty tuple.

It may be related with the fact that `K(0).lm()` returns `0`. I think it is also reasonable that this would raise an error.

For this ticket, we may skip `gi` if it is a zero polynomial, instead of checking `gilm` is nonzero, if we allow a zero generator but assume leading monomial is nonzero.
