You should use `frozenset(e)` instead of `tuple(sorted(e))`. 

Also, can you push the branch in something like `public/graphs/34809_vizing` to allow me to push review commits. It shall ease the reviewing process.

I changed the doctest to something smaller / faster.

Do you have other improvements for this method ?

There is an error due to the call `return _vizing_edge_coloring(g, hex_colors)` in the except statement.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.graph_coloring import edge_coloring
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(5) + graphs.Grid2dGraph(3, 4)
sage: edge_coloring(G, value_only=True, vizing=False)
4
sage: len(edge_coloring(G, value_only=False, vizing=False))
5
```

Also, you should check before the `ILP` if `Delta + 1 <= chi`, in which case you can directly call vizing on that component (but not on the graph).

I have a few minor comments/suggestions.

1) Please eliminate the `hex_color` code duplication. Instead of copy-pasting the `hex_color` code, wouldn't it be better to have the private method return the coloring, and let the main routine process it if necessary?

Actually I would be +1 on deleting the `hex_color` keyword, but that would be a separate ticket. Duplicating this code is moving entirely in the wrong direction, in my opinion.

2) The new implementation changes the method in a backward-incompatible way.  Sage policy therefore requires a deprecation period.  This policy is not always enforced, but there should be a good reason, so it should be specifically discussed, and perhaps the change should be announced on sage-devel, to see if there are any objections.

I can easily imagine cases where this change breaks code.  For example, if I were looking at lots of graphs of the same maximum degree, I might want to make an incidence matrix that keeps track of which edges are incident with which colors of edges. In the current implementation, I am guaranteed that these matrices all have the same size, but that guarantee is being dropped.

3) The docstring's phrase "This may result in either a `\Delta`-edge-coloring or a `Delta + 1`-edge-coloring" is very unclear.  I think the usual definition of "k-coloring" is that it can use k colors or less, so every `(Delta + 1)`-edge-coloring is also a `\Delta`-edge-coloring.  Thus, Vizing's Theorem always produces a `(Delta + 1)`-edge coloring. So, instead of using the term "`\Delta`-edge-coloring", I think the phrasing should make it more clear that the number of colors that actually appear in the coloring is either `Delta` or `Delta + 1`.

(Also, I think parentheses are necessary around "`Delta + 1`", and I think there is a typo: "\Delta" is missing its backslash in "`Delta + 1`-edge-coloring".)

4) Please add a reference to this trac ticket in a docstring or comment.

This can be fixed by adding a new color class with a random edge if a coloring with Delta colors is found, not sure if it's the best solution though. Please let me know if you have any other idea or if we should just start a discussion on sage-devel about the deprecation of this function.
