fpylll's "native" numbers are Python long ints, and it currently has a hack checking for presense of Sage at runtime and tries the conversion. This is fraught with various issues, cf e.g. https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/iIttQjz-Zaw/m/Zb8zpaRzCgAJ

Sage should just adopt whatever Sage<->Python conversion code fpylll has and use it, allowing fpylll to be clean of it.

I was going to say that there is an important possible loss of efficiency here: sage's `Integer` uses an mpz underneath, and fplll does so too. Converting through a conversion as a python integer would cause significant extra work. But then I looked at the relevant code in fpylll:

```
    if have_sage:
        if isinstance(value, Integer):
            value = long(value)
            mpz_set_pylong(t, value)
            return 0
```
so it's presently doing the double conversion *anyway*.

Perhaps it doesn't matter because LLL's running time is always much longer than the in/out conversion. But it looks like there could be a much tighter (and faster!) integration if the gmp integers were directly converted.

One solution could be to change fpylll to "fpyxlll" -- i.e., make it a python wrappen of fpylll that also has a cython ABI exposed. Then sage could do conversions against that and provide fpylll with an integer matrix in the format it expects already. But fpylll would have to make available the data structure definitions to do so.
