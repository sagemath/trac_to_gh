Right.

According to the exception message, it checks for `lrsnash` and says `lrsnash` is not available, which is correct, and suggests to me to install `lrslib`, which is an optional package. As `obtain_nash` is dependent on `lrsnash`, it should not be tested when the optional package was not installed. Right?

What is the right fix?
