    Executable 'lrsnash' not found on PATH.
    No equivalent system packages for homebrew are known to Sage.
    To install lrsnash using the Sage package manager, you can try to run:
      !sage -i lrslib
    No equivalent system packages for pip are known to Sage.
    Further installation instructions might be available at http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html.

I have been seeing these failures for a long time on my system (mac os).

Right.

> I don't think this is the right fix. `obtain_nash` decides on the default algorithm to use based on a feature test; but it checks for `Lrs` when it should check for `Lrslib` or `LrsNash`. 

According to the exception message, it checks for `lrsnash` and says `lrsnash` is not available, which is correct, and suggests to me to install `lrslib`, which is an optional package. As `obtain_nash` is dependent on `lrsnash`, it should not be tested when the optional package was not installed. Right?

What is the right fix?
