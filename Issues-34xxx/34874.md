Do you host MathJax ? Naturally this is not a good idea for a server, that's what CDNs are for.

Replying to [Dima Pasechnik](#comment%3A1):
> Do you host MathJax ? Naturally this is not a good idea for a server, that's what CDNs are for.

I "host" the complete documentation, which includes MathJax as a static asset. This is the same as for the production documentation, where the mathjax js file is at https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/_static/mathjax/tex-chtml.js and the fonts at https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/_static/mathjax/output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2/MathJax_Main-Bold.woff. 

Another, but similar, "issue" is that the jupyter manager is downloaded from https://unpkg.com/@jupyter-widgets/html-manager@0.20.2/dist/embed-amd.js instead of from a "proper" cdn such as https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@jupyter-widgets/html-manager@0.20.2/dist/embed-amd.js

Yet another standard optimization would be to bundle the css and js files, but I'm not sure how easy this would be with sphinx.
