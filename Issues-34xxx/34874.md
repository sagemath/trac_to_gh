I'm currently hosting the dev-preview of the docs in my private netlify account. In general, this is not a problem. However, I now regularly get warnings that I've used above 50% of the free bandwidth. For example, at the 22nd Dec I've used 59GB of the free 100GB.

Replying to [Dima Pasechnik](#comment%3A1):

I "host" the complete documentation, which includes MathJax as a static asset. This is the same as for the production documentation, where the mathjax js file is at https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/_static/mathjax/tex-chtml.js and the fonts at https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/_static/mathjax/output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2/MathJax_Main-Bold.woff. 

Another, but similar, "issue" is that the jupyter manager is downloaded from https://unpkg.com/@jupyter-widgets/html-manager@0.20.2/dist/embed-amd.js instead of from a "proper" cdn such as https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@jupyter-widgets/html-manager@0.20.2/dist/embed-amd.js

Yet another standard optimization would be to bundle the css and js files, but I'm not sure how easy this would be with sphinx.

That's what one gets for $19 per month. 
We certainly have funds to pay for this, while we work on the necessary optimisations.

Tobias, practically speaking, the easiest would be for you to buy a $19 p.m. subscription, and we'd reimburse you on your paypal account, or on your bank account.

I see no problem in having "This site is powered by Netlify" shown.
Do they want it on every page?

Yes on all pages, or only on the main page.

I guess this would make the most sense if the production website is also hosted on netlify. Are there any plans in this direction?

Do they allow to use a custom domain name? Having that long netify url shown is a bit ugly.

I think the sage docs are hosted on github pages, thus free, anyway.
