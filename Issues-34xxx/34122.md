There may be a bug in the `is_planar()` implementation for directed graphs.  We have a case which returns `False` instead of `True` for the below planarity test.

```
     # We include both [1,5] and [5,1]
     G = [ [1,2], [1,4], [1,5], [2,3], [2,4], [2,5], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5], [5,1] ]
     G1 = Graph(G)
     G2 = DiGraph(G)
     G1.is_planar() # True
     G2.is_planar() # False => Should be true
```

Note that it does not seem to be a problem of cycle, since it works for the following case.

```
     # We include both [1,2] and [2,1]
     G = [ [1,2] , [2,1] ]
     G1 = Graph(G)
     G2 = DiGraph(G)
     G1.is_planar() # True
     G2.is_planar() # True !
```

Keywords: digraph, planar
