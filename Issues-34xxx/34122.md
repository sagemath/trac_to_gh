<div id="comment:0"></div>

There may be a bug in the `is_planar()` implementation for directed graphs.  We have a case which returns `False` instead of `True` for the below planarity test.

```
     # We include both [1,5] and [5,1]
     G = [ [1,2], [1,4], [1,5], [2,3], [2,4], [2,5], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5], [5,1] ]
     G1 = Graph(G)
     G2 = DiGraph(G)
     G1.is_planar() # True
     G2.is_planar() # False => Should be true
```

Note that it does not seem to be a problem of cycle, since it works for the following case.

```
     # We include both [1,2] and [2,1]
     G = [ [1,2] , [2,1] ]
     G1 = Graph(G)
     G2 = DiGraph(G)
     G1.is_planar() # True
     G2.is_planar() # True !
```

Component: **graph theory**

Keywords: **digraph, planar**

Thanks for pointing out the bug. This is a fundamental error in basic functionality, so I increased the priority to "critical". 

The code applied an inequality to digraphs that is only valid for graphs.  A digraph without loops or multiple edges can have twice as many edges as the corresponding graph (because each undirected edge in a graph can be replaced with two oppositely directed edges in a digraph), so it is not true that a digraph with `self.size() > 3 * self.order() - 6` cannot be planar.
