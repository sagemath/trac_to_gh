We implement `factor`, `gcd` and `_floordiv_` for symmetric functions, and thus make them a `UniqueFactorizationDomain`.

To set the category, you need to do two things:

- Add it to the `super_categories` in `SymmetricFunctionBasses` in `sfa.py`.
- Add it to the `cat` in the `class SymmetricFunctions` in `sf.py`.

For the code, you can use `M._from_dict` because we know each index is unique because we are using the monomial basis for polynomials.

THe problem is that `UniqueFactorizationDomains` expects that also `gcd` is implemented.  There should have been a `TestSuite` test that checks this, but apparently, there isn't.

`gcd` can be implemented along the same lines (i.e., converting to a polynomial and back), and I have already done this, but I need to polish first.  I am not sure what the parent of `gcd(self, other)` should be, I am guessing `self.parent()`?

I don't know whether `quo_rem` also has to be implemented.

There is another glitch: when the union of all partitions in the symmetric functions has only a single part, then the polynomial ring is univariate, and the element constructor works differently.  This is also easy to fix.

I "implemented" `gcd` and `_floordiv_`, but it seems that this is not quite sufficient:

```

1 item had failures:
   1 of  55 in sage.rings.lazy_series

```
Very likely, these are true bugs.  If so, there is another bug: these should also be detected by the doctests in the symmetric function code and the testsuite in `lazy_series_ring.py`, but aren't.

Why are you testing if there is a `fraction_field()` method? Shouldn't it be more fundamental like being an integral domain (where the category provides a default)?

What else are you currently unsure about? The implementation looks okay to me modulo the above question.

One other small thing I might change is

```diff
         R = self.base().base_ring()

         if R in PrincipalIdealDomains:

Unfortunately, this is not true - there is no default implementation of `fraction_field`, this would be #34347.

> What else are you currently unsure about? The implementation looks okay to me modulo the above question.


There are two separate issues:

* it seems to me that the quality of our test suite should be improved in this ticket - and not postponed, because I only see it's lackingness here: we enhance the ring of symmetric functions, and a test in `lazy_series.py` fails, which is not even in the testsuite.

* in `sfa.py`, I am providing the very same not entirely trivial code to convert to and from a polynomial three times.  Moreover, I think it might be better to put this code into `SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_multiplicative`, and thus separate factorization from conversion to a parent where we can do the factorization.

Ah, right, it is not required yet. However, my question still holds. It is conceivable that division still makes sense without going to the fraction field:

```
sage: R.<z> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: (1 / z).parent()
Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in z over Rational Field
```
Admittedly that is a bit of a special case, but testing for a fraction field feels like slightly too strong of a restriction.

That is exactly what good doctests should do. Not everything needs to be, nor should be, jammed into the test suite. It has limitations of being a general purpose tool, part of which is based on the elements given to it to test. Of course, that should not be taken as we should not improve the test suite with general tests where appropriate. However, I don't think we should make broader changes on this ticket.

Am I correct in that [ccc925f](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/ccc925fd1bd22721b9e478f13350231663c31334) fixes the failures you were seeing?

> * in `sfa.py`, I am providing the very same not entirely trivial code to convert to and from a polynomial three times.  Moreover, I think it might be better to put this code into `SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_multiplicative`, and thus separate factorization from conversion to a parent where we can do the factorization.


I think that conversion (as a hidden `_to_poly` and `_from_poly`) could work. Although it is not quite isolated because you have two different elements (for two methods) that should be in the same polynomial ring when done. That kind of communication would be hard. At this point, we aren't scaling this, so it might not be worth the time and effort to find a solution to this right now.

Also `_floordiv_` should have both its arguments are part of the same parent, hence the first part of that function should not be necessarily. For `gcd`, there is the decorator `@coerce_binop` that you can use to avoid the common parent finding too.

The restriction is only in the case of exact series - but I don't quite understand your question: this `R` does have `_fraction_field`, and it coincides with `R`.

Oh, now I see.  I think I want `R.base_ring()` to have a fraction field...

I just noticed that there is a method for monomial symmetric functions doing the same, just less generally and with a bug:

```
    def from_polynomial_exp(self, p):
    ...
    assert self.base_ring() == p.parent().base_ring()
    return self.sum_of_terms((Partition(exp=monomial), coeff)
                             for monomial, coeff in p.dict().items())
```
shall I replace this with

```
    def from_polynomial_exp(self, p):
    ...
    assert self.base_ring() == p.parent().base_ring()
    from sage.combinat.sf.sfa import _from_polynomial
    return _from_polynomial(p, self)
```
?
