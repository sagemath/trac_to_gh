Circular dependencies:

```
make[3]: Circular /home/release/Sage/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.11.1/var/lib/sage/installed/typing_extensions-4.4.0 <- /home/release/Sage/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.11.1/var/lib/sage/installed/setuptools_scm-7.0.5 dependency dropped.
```
Note that this is currently a warning and the install fails successfully ;) 

My merge script checks for it though.

```
setuptools_scm/dependencies
$(PYTHON) typing_extensions | setuptools pip wheel tomli packaging
 
typing_extensions/dependencies
$(PYTHON) | $(PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN) flit_core
```
but

```
PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN = setuptools pip setuptools_scm wheel setuptools_wheel
```
so it's indeed circular. 
Note that
https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/blob/main/pyproject.toml tells that it needs `typing_extensions`.
OTOH only `flit_core` is mentioned as a build dependency in https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/pyproject.toml
