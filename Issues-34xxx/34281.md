Example:

```sage
sage: p = 2^521-1
sage: F = GF(p)
sage: GF(p) is F  # field is cached
True
sage: %timeit GF(p)
521 ms ± 6.46 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```

Note that the constructor tests primality *each time* even though the field is already cached! This was pointed out here:

  https://github.com/jack4818/Castryck-Decru-SageMath#speeding-sagemath-up-using-a-cache

In this patch, we move the primality and irreducibility testing from `FiniteFieldFactory.create_key_and_extra_args()` to `FiniteFieldFactory.create_object()`, so that it isn't performed again for fields already present in the cache.

The result is a massive speedup for repeated invocations of `GF(p)`:

```
78.6 µs ± 870 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
```
