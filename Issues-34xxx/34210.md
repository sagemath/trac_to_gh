original description, kept for the record:
a student here, Lauriane Turelier, has hit the following issue. WIth Sage 9.2 on a AMD EPYC 7282:

```
$ /usr/bin/sage res.sage
1.8131059999999994
```
With Sage 9.5 on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570:

```
$ /usr/bin/sage res.sage
0.007745000000000002
```
This is the time for the computation of the resultant of two degree-9 polynomials in two variables with coefficients of up to 248 digits.
Maybe this was fixed since 9.2, but just for the record, I prefer to report it.

New description: the Debian Singular package is compiled with Flint 2.9.0, but when run with the Debian Flint package 2.8.5, it gives wrong results.

in fact the problem is worse: the "fast" computation is completely wrong (thanks to Xavier Bonnetain for figuring it out). The "resultant" computed has degree 0 in tau, whereas the correct resultant should have degree 81 (this can be checked by computing the resultant modulo 2<sup>29</sup>-3 for example).

This bug arises on Debian with Sage 9.5, using the Debian package for Flint 2.8.5.

Changed the priority to "critical".
