The following code:

```
K.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ[I])
C.<y> = NumberField( K(cyclotomic_polynomial(7,x)) )
h = -6*y^5 - 4*y^3 - 2*y^2 - 2*y - 4
print('norm =',h.norm())
print('is_unit =',h.is_unit())
```

shows that element `h` is detected as a unit despite its norm being 4096.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Sage is behaving correctly. The parent of `h` is `C`, which is a field, and `h` is certainly a unit in that ring, so `h.is_unit()` is `True`. To ask whether an element of `C` is a unit in the ring of integers, it should be converted to an element of that ring.

```
sage: h.parent() is C
True
sage: O_C = C.ring_of_integers()
sage: O_C(h).is_unit()
False
```
Number theorists abuse terminology, and say "units of C" when they actually mean "units of O_C", but object-oriented computer programming cannot allow this, because it would lead to bugs when programs written for general rings happen to receive a number field as input (or as an intermediate result). This ticket should be closed as invalid.

This is similar to #25046. Perhaps there is some reasonable way to add a warning?
