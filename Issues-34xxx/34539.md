1. Platform-independent wheels for pure Python distribution packages sagemath-environment, sagemath-repl, sage-docbuild. (Currently we only publish sdists, but micropip needs wheels.)

2. Needed for sagemath-objects, sagemath-categories:

- `gmpy2` [available since pyodide 0.21.0](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/changelog.html#version-0-21-0)
- `cysignals`

3. Candidate for the first useful package: sagemath-polyhedra (#32432)
