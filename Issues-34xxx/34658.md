sage: A.eigenvectors_left(B)
[(-2.1075759441619084, [(-0.9905315991237724, 0.1372849268394109)], 1),

```
vs. the previous version (1.8.1), correct one:

```
sage: A.eigenvectors_left(B)
[(1.8208523846306908, [(-0.5400711566794881, -0.8416193591659354)], 1),

```

This can be traced down to scipy call:

```

       [ 0.13728493,  0.26423138]])
```
vs, correct, previous version:

```
sage: v

sage: eig
