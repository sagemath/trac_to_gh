```
Example:

```sage
sage: pow(5,7,13).parent()
Ring of integers modulo 13
```

This contradicts the docstring ("Return `(left ^ right) % modulus`."), and it doesn't happen for other parents:

```sage
sage: R.<x> = GF(59)[]
sage: pow(x,123,x^5-x+1).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 59
```

I do think the docstring of `lift` should be revised to clarify this (unless I missed something), but that's not for this ticket.
