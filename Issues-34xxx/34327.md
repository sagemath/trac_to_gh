A `ConvexHPolyhedralSet_base` is defined by finitely many linear equations and linear inequalities, some of which may be strict.

Example: { (x,y) : x >= 0, y >= 0 } \ (0,0) = { x>=0, y>=0, x+y > 0 }


A `ConvexVPolyhedralSet_base` is generated by finitely many convex/conic generators; some generators may restrict their coefficients to be strictly positive.

Example: (0,0) u { (x,y) : x > 0, y > 0 } = { a (1,0) + b (0,1) + c (1,1), a>0, b>0, c>=0 }


A `ConvexPolyhedralSet_base` has both descriptions.

Any instance of these three classes can be written as a disjoint union of relative interiors of faces of their closure.

In this ticket, we only refactor `Polyhedron_base` (closed polyhedra) through the new class `ConvexHPolyhedralSet_base`, and make it possible to use an instance of a `ConvexHPolyhedralSet_base` subclass as a container for a (non-minimal) H-representation, for example as input to the `Polyhedron` constructor.

Follow-ups: 
- We introduce new method names for the Vrepresentation that do not assume minimality of the distinguished representation: `convex_generators` instead of `vertices` etc. (see #26366).
- #32159 will add the necessary representation objects to handle the general case.
