A cross of
- https://github.com/ilyasotkov/vscode-devcontainer-python-cookiecutter
- https://github.com/mmasdeu/sage_package_template

The devcontainer config would be one of those added in #33671 (sagemath-sage or downstream-...).

Prospective sage users on Windows can use the devcontainer config to automate the Sage install in WSL. VS Code walks you through this.

Also a command `sage --cookiecutter` or `sage --new-project` could be added.

Alternative to cookiecutter: 
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cantonios.project-templates

- Getting a devcontainer template for Sage into https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers
