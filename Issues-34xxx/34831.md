CC:  @kwankyu @enderwannabe @tobiasdiez

Used in `src/sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics/projective_ds.py`.

We also set lower version bounds for backport packages `importlib_resources`, `importlib_metadata`, `typing_extensions` so that Sage developers can use Python 3.11 features.

Actually the import seems unused in that file, but it's good to have this backport package as a dependency as preparation for more type annotations.

I can't say I have any idea why I added this import. It seems like it can (and perhaps should) be removed.
