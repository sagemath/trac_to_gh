Why are we removing the one blank line at the end of files? The description of W261 does not match its example. Its "best practice" has zero blank lines and removing these from the files in this change means they have none. If they are doing some other kind of counting, then it makes no sense to have zero "blank lines". I am quite confused by this.

Replying to [Travis Scrimshaw](#comment%3A6):
> I am quite confused by this.


Yes.

- `Text\n`, then EOF -- good.
- `Text`, then EOF -- ungood - non-terminated line at EOF.
- `Text\n\n`, then EOF -- ungood - empty line before EOF.
- `Text\n \n`, then EOF -- ungood - line with trailing space.
- `Text\n `, then EOF -- plus ungood - line with trailing space, non-terminated.

I would suggest not to make style changes like this:

```
-      if a == id_anyon:
-          if x == b and y == d:
-              return 1
-          else:
-              return 0
+    if a == id_anyon:
+        return 1 if x == b and y == d else 0
```
I don't think it's universally agreed that this would be an improvement. Personally, I never use `if-else` expressions and I find them harder to read.

How about `int(x == b and y == d)`?
