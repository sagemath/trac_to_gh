We reduce the unmaintained `r` package (stuck at 3.6.3) so that we detect a system installation of R (>= 3.5) but do not attempt to install it ourselves.

When R is found as a system package, `rpy2` will be built; otherwise it won't.

rpy2 3.5.x only supports R >= 4.0 according to
https://rpy2.github.io/doc/v3.5.x/html/overview.html#requirements

Here we upgrade rpy2 to 3.4.5, the latest that still supports R >= 3.5 according to https://rpy2.github.io/doc/v3.4.x/html/overview.html#requirements

Support for R < 3.5 was already dropped in the rpy 3.3.x series (our current version of rpy2 is 3.3.6).

According to https://repology.org/project/r/versions, we will thus drop support for R on the ancient platforms:
- `ubuntu-trusty` (R 3.0.2; past [End of Standard Support](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases); EOL April 2024]), 
- `ubuntu-xenial` (R 3.2.3; past End of Standard Support; EOL April 2026), 
- `ubuntu-bionic` (R 3.4.4; End of Standard Support: April 2023)
- `debian-stretch` (R 3.3.3; past EOL)
- `fedora-26` (R 3.4.4; past EOL), 
as well as on Cygwin. (See #32074)

The files in https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/tree/master/contrib/vm suggest that you are using `ubuntu-bionic`, so if this is what you use in production, you will be affected by the proposed change.

The ticket is marked for the Sage 9.8 milestone, so you'll have plenty of time to do an upgrade to the current LTS (`ubuntu-jammy`)
