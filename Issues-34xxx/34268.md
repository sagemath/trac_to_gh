We reduce the unmaintained `r` package (stuck at 3.6.3) so that we detect a system installation of R (>= 3.5) but do not attempt to install it ourselves.

When R is found as a system package, `rpy2` will be built; otherwise it won't.

rpy2 3.5.x only supports R >= 4.0 according to
https://rpy2.github.io/doc/v3.5.x/html/overview.html#requirements

Here we upgrade rpy2 to 3.4.5, the latest that still supports R >= 3.5 according to https://rpy2.github.io/doc/v3.4.x/html/overview.html#requirements

Support for R < 3.5 was already dropped in the rpy 3.3.x series (our current version of rpy2 is 3.3.6).

According to https://repology.org/project/r/versions, we will thus drop support for R on the ancient platforms:
- `ubuntu-trusty` (R 3.0.2; past [End of Standard Support](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases); EOL April 2024]), 
- `ubuntu-xenial` (R 3.2.3; past End of Standard Support; EOL April 2026), 
- `ubuntu-bionic` (R 3.4.4; End of Standard Support: April 2023)
- `debian-stretch` (R 3.3.3; past EOL)
- `fedora-26` (R 3.4.4; past EOL), 
as well as on Cygwin. (See #32074)

 Support for R < 3.5 was already dropped in the rpy 3.3.x series (our current version of rpy2 is 3.3.6).
 
 According to https://repology.org/project/r/versions, we will thus drop support for R on the ancient platforms:
-- `ubuntu-trusty` (R 3.0.2; past [[End of Standard Support](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases); EOL April 2024]),

I think it would make sense to limit the number of mirrors it tries to some small number (5?) before it tries the upstream.
