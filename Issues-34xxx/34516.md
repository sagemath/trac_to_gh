Keywords: cremona database

I attempted to build the large Cremona database with sagemath 9.6 and sqlite 3.36.0 on a Fedora 36 x86_64 machine, as follows:

```
import sage.databases.cremona
c = sage.databases.cremona.LargeCremonaDatabase('cremona', False, True)
c._init_from_ftpdata('ecdata-2019-10-29')
```
The attempt failed at the very end.  This is the last of the output:

```
Inserting allgens.90000-99999
Committing...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/builddir/build/BUILD/sage-9.6/cremona.sage.py", line 10, in <module>
    c._init_from_ftpdata('ecdata-2019-10-29')
  File "/builddir/build/BUILDROOT/sagemath-9.6-4.fc38.x86_64/usr/lib64/python3.11/site-packages/sage/databases/cremona.py", line 1397, in _init_from_ftpdata
    self.vacuum()
  File "/builddir/build/BUILDROOT/sagemath-9.6-4.fc38.x86_64/usr/lib64/python3.11/site-packages/sage/databases/sql_db.py", line 2180, in vacuum
    self.__connection__.execute('VACUUM')
sqlite3.OperationalError: cannot VACUUM from within a transaction
```
The phrase "from within a transaction" suggests a missing commit.  Indeed, unlike `_init_degphi` and `_init_allbsd`, which both print the "Committing..." message and then call `self.commit()`, `_init_allgens` just prints the message but doesn't call commit.  This patch adds the missing commit.  With this change, I was able to build the database successfully.
