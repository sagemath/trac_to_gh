Replying to [Martin Rubey](#comment%3A5):

>  

I think the definition of the objects of a category should be (at least look) mathematical. So I prefer "we can [constructively] factor". I suggested to remove "constructively", but you may keep it if you prefer.

It seems reasonable to add an abstract method `factor` with an an appropriate docstring, as there is already a hint for the method as a comment inside `ElementMethods` inner class.

Are you going to work for the abstract method? 

Even if not, I am positive as it is. Just let me know.
