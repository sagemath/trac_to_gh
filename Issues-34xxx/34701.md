A refactor in #27946 introduced "unprotected" (not surrounded by `GAP_Enter`/`GAP_Leave`) `GAP_ValueGlobalVariable` calls. I believe this might be a GC hazard, because after updating to GAP 4.12.1 I started seeing aarch64 crashes on NixOS infrastructure such as:

```

#11 0x0000ffff99884828 in capture_stdout () at /build/sage-src-9.7/pkgs/sagemath-standard/sage/libs/gap/element.pyx:154
...
```
I also see cases where `capture_stdout` throws errors such as `sage.libs.gap.util.GAPError: Error, Length: <list> must be a list (not the integer 255)` and then crashes. Both types of errors are fixed by this ticket.

Note that I am nesting `GAP_Enter`/`GAP_Leave` calls because I didn't remove the preexisting calls inside `capture_stdout`. That's because I feared removing the innermost calls might create a new footgun (and I believe nested `GAP_Enter`/`GAP_Leave` calls are explicitly supported), but removing them should cause no problem. Removing them might even be preferable for performance reasons, I don't know.

This ticket's branch is based on #34391.

(Edit: I previously thought that holding onto a `char*` past the `GAP_Enter`/`GAP_Leave` blocks, as is done in GapElement's `__str__` and `_repr_` methods, could also cause GC hazards. It doesn't seem to be a problem in practice, though, and I am not qualified to tell if it's a problem in theory.)

Depends on #34391
