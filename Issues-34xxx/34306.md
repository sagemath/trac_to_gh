Typical changes are

```diff
-        for e in G.edges(sort=True):
-            i = G.vertices(sort=True).index(e[0])
-            j = G.vertices(sort=True).index(e[1])
+        vertex_to_int = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(G)}
+        for u, v in G.edge_iterator(labels=False, sort_vertices=False):
+            i = vertex_to_int[u]
+            j = vertex_to_int[v]
```
On the way, we also improve some calls to `.index(...)` in `src/sage/geometry/`.
