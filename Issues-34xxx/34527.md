```
Currently Sage does not understand `Composition`s as a `collections.abc.Sequence`:

```
sage: c = Composition([3,4,2,4])
sage: from collections.abc import Sequence
sage: isinstance(c, Sequence)
False
```

This ticket registers `Composition` as a `Sequence`.

I realize that I have to clarify this: It is equivalent as far as `isinstance` and `issubclass` are concerned, but you will get the mix-in methods listed in https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections-abstract-base-classes (`__reversed__`, `count`, etc.) only if you inherit from `Sequence` in the class definition.

Yes, of course, that should be added as a test maybe:

```
sage: import collections.abc
sage: C = Composition([3,2,3])
sage: issubclass(C.__class__, collections.abc.Sequence)
True
sage: isinstance(C, collections.abc.Sequence)
True
```

No, sorry, my mistake. It's getting late here.

You are right, it is not allowed to register it without implementing these mixin methods.
But you'll get them for free by changing it to subclassing instead of registering.

Ouch. Python used a metaclass for their (collections) ABCs `abc.ABCMeta`. Well, I guess that settles it; we have to register it.

No, that is going to go away at some point.

This won't solve the problem:

```
sage: from sage.structure.list_clone import ClonableArray
sage: ClonableArray.__class__
<class 'sage.misc.inherit_comparison.InheritComparisonMetaclass'>

I understand [this python discussion post](https://discuss.python.org/t/mapping-abc-and-friends-are-the-mixin-methods-required-to-satisfy-the-interface/9499/2) to mean that mix-in methods are *not* required.

On the other hand it is easy enough to implement `.count()` where `.count(n)` returns the number of parts of size `n`. So I'll do that later today.
