```
Currently Sage does not understand `Composition`s as a `collections.abc.Sequence`:

```
sage: c = Composition([3,4,2,4])
sage: from collections.abc import Sequence
sage: isinstance(c, Sequence)
False
```

This ticket registers `Composition` as a `Sequence`.

I realize that I have to clarify this: It is equivalent as far as `isinstance` and `issubclass` are concerned, but you will get the mix-in methods listed in https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections-abstract-base-classes (`__reversed__`, `count`, etc.) only if you inherit from `Sequence` in the class definition.

Yes, of course, that should be added as a test maybe:

```
sage: import collections.abc
sage: C = Composition([3,2,3])
sage: issubclass(C.__class__, collections.abc.Sequence)
True
sage: isinstance(C, collections.abc.Sequence)
True
```

No, sorry, my mistake. It's getting late here.

You are right, it is not allowed to register it without implementing these mixin methods.

Ouch. Python used a metaclass for their (collections) ABCs `abc.ABCMeta`. Well, I guess that settles it; we have to register it.

No, that is going to go away at some point.

This won't solve the problem:

```
sage: from sage.structure.list_clone import ClonableArray
sage: ClonableArray.__class__
<class 'sage.misc.inherit_comparison.InheritComparisonMetaclass'>

I understand [this python discussion post](https://discuss.python.org/t/mapping-abc-and-friends-are-the-mixin-methods-required-to-satisfy-the-interface/9499/2) to mean that mix-in methods are *not* required.

On the other hand it is easy enough to implement `.count()` where `.count(n)` returns the number of parts of size `n`. So I'll do that later today.
