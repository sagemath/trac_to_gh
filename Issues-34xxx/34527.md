```
Currently Sage does not understand `Composition`s as a `collections.abc.Sequence`:

```
sage: c = Composition([3,4,2,4])
sage: from collections.abc import Sequence
sage: isinstance(c, Sequence)
False
```

This ticket registers `Composition` as a `Sequence`.

+1 to Matthiasâs comments; in particular the `count` method is a bit unnatural for compositions.

It might make more sense to simply inherit from `Sequence` instead of registering it and providing a `__reversed__` method (which should return a `Composition`). The default `count` should be okay.

It looks like things are sufficiently fixed just by calling `Sequence.register(Composition)`. As Matthias suggested, I updated the doctest. I'm not sure there is a need to actually implement the `__reversed__` or `count` methods as I had suggested earlier.

I realize that I have to clarify this: It is equivalent as far as `isinstance` and `issubclass` are concerned, but you will get the mix-in methods listed in https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections-abstract-base-classes (`__reversed__`, `count`, etc.) only if you inherit from `Sequence` in the class definition.

Yes, of course, that should be added as a test maybe:

```
sage: import collections.abc
sage: C = Composition([3,2,3])
sage: issubclass(C.__class__, collections.abc.Sequence)
True
sage: isinstance(C, collections.abc.Sequence)
True

You are right, it is not allowed to register it without implementing these mixin methods.

This won't solve the problem:
