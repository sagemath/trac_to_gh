We implement a simple version of `sage_setup.clean.clean_install_dir` for editable installs: Remove `.so` files and `.pyc` files that are leftovers from other branches, i.e., there is no corresponding source file (`.pyx` for `.so`; `.py` for `.pyc`).

This fixes incremental builds when a Cython module is replaced by a Python module of the same name, as noted in [#34324 comment:3](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/34324#comment:3)

This simple version, because it is only applied to the source directory, not an installation directory, will be safe for modularization (in contrast to `clean_install_dir`, see #32927).
