`./bootstrap && ./sage -sh -c '(cd pkgs/sagemath-standard && tox -v -v -v -e sagepython-sagewheels-nopypi-norequirements)'` fails in 9.8.beta5 because the sdist is broken

```

  cimport cython

  ^
  ------------------------------------------------------------

  sage/algebras/fusion_rings/fast_parallel_fmats_methods.pyx:12:0: 'sage/algebras/fusion_rings/poly_tup_engine.pxd' not found

```

We fix this by 
- updating MANIFEST
- unconditionally running the module finder in pkgs/sagemath-standard/setup.py

We make the same change also in pkgs/sagemath-objects/setup.py (by symlink, this also affects sagemath-categories).

<a id='comment:6'></a>So no more sdist specific code in setup.py so simplification and make sure stuff is properly included in the manifest.

I am wondering if it is possible to first use a global include and then prune some of the files that are collected by that global include. I am just thinking we should explicitly list as few files as we can. It is a risk, because someone will forget to include them in the manifest when they create a new one - or delete one.
