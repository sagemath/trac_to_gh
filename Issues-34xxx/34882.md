Wouldn't it be better to ignore `p.add_constraint(True)` entirely?

I am surprised how tricky this little modification is.  In particular, it also affects `_is_redundant_constraint`.

To give some background, in #33238 I have, repeatedly, things like

```
                c = AZ_matrix[z][w] - B_matrix[z][w]
                if c.is_zero():
                    continue
                if c in ZZ:
                    raise MIPSolverException
                self.milp.add_constraint(c == 0, name="statistics")
```
Since the code is already hard to read, just having

```
                self.milp.add_constraint(AZ_matrix[z][w] == B_matrix[z][w], name="statistics")
```
seems nicer.  Moreover, the check `c in ZZ` seems brittle.  I guess I could use

```
               if c.coefficient(-1):
```
instead, but this also looks quite obscure.

Do you have an estimate for when #34251 will be ready?  How does CVXPY deal with trivially feasible / infeasible constraints?

I am now convinced that this is not a good idea.  It is much better to make the user convert the input to a linear constraint themselves.

> How does CVXPY deal with trivially feasible / infeasible constraints?

Usually modeling frameworks have a specialized function for forming fast sums, which also guarantees that the empty sum has the correct type. (Also Sage has `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.sum` for the same purpose.)
