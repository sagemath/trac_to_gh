We unify the classes `Set_object_enumerated` and `FiniteEnumeratedSet`.

The only difference should be that one uses a `frozenset` (fast look ups, slow indexing via iteration), the other uses a `tuple` (slow look ups, fast indexing). And we should have the option to get both operations fast. We get this for free by the category `FiniteEnumeratedSets`.

We add to the methods provided by `Sets.ParentMethods`:
- methods `is_subset` etc. (as defined for `RealSet` and `ManifoldSubset`) via discovery of inclusion morphisms (see #34461)

We add to the methods provided by `FiniteEnumeratedSets.ParentMethods`:
- `frozenset` (to complement `list`)
- specialization of `is_subset` etc. by iteration or delegating to `frozenset`
- alternate spellings `issubset` etc. used by the Python library) for finite enumerated sets - for interoperability with Python `set`, `frozenset`

Then we deprecate the import of `FiniteEnumeratedSet` in the global namespace in favor of using the constructor `Set`.
