We add a method `multivariate_interpolation` to the `MPolynomialRing_base` class.

Given a bound on the degree and either point/value pairs or a function, it returns the respective interpolation polynomial.

The ticket is now ready for review.

As this is my first ever [SageMath](SageMath) contribution, I also want to ask the following questions:

1. Is my way/style of importing correct? Or should I do it differently?                                                                   
2. I use internal functions, i.e. functions defined inside a function. Is this fine as it is or should I rename them with an underscore in front?
3. Is my way of reporting a warning good or is there a better/"sage-style" way?

Also: The status badge says the linting doesn't pass... however from the log I can't really see what is going wrong.

Mathematically the code looks very good to me, it has extensive documentation and - from what I can see - it follows the established code conventions for [SageMath](SageMath). So I am happy to give an informal positive review, but it would be good if someone more familiar with Sage would have another look.

Welcome to Sage, this looks like a great first patch!

Some comments regarding the docstring formatting (according to the usual Sage conventions):

- Use backticks ` instead of quotes " around variable names inside the text. This will make the HTML documentation render it as code.
- In general, double colons `::` are used if and only if the following block is indented; use a single colon `:` otherwise.
- `NOTE:` → `.. NOTE::`
- `WARNING::` → `.. WARNING::`
- `SEEALSO:` → `.. SEEALSO::`, and insert another blank line after.
- Do not indent the `ALGORITHM:` block.
- No need to indent the enumerated lists either.
- `a evaluable function` → `an evaluable function`, or maybe drop the articles "a" altogether in that list.

I'm also wondering if the method should just be called `interpolation()`: the "multivariate" part follows from its class.

Sorry, I got it wrong: Single backticks are for math and double backticks are for code. There are definitely too many similar-but-different markup languages out there. So, for example:

```
        * ``function`` -- evaluable function in `n` variables, where `n` is the
          number of variables of the polynomial ring
```

I also seem to recall that Sage has a preference for formatting exceptions in accordance with Python's own style, i.e., starting with a lowercase letter and omitting the final punctuation, but I can't find a reference for this right now.

The warning about non-uniqueness of the solution can be useful, but I think it can also be very annoying: Imagine running this in a loop and getting spammed with an endless stream of those messages. Perhaps a cleaner way would be to instead introduce an optional keyword argument to additionally return a basis of the vector space of polynomials which evaluate to zero at the interpolation points?

I have fixed the markup.

**Exceptions formatting:** I have scrolled the Sage source and saw both, so I'm not sure. I personally prefer full sentences, so I kept it like that. However if there is any convention, I'll change it.

**Warnings/non-uniqueness:** Isn't the point that warnings are posted via a special warnings class? So people who don't want to see them should be able to somehow supress them. At least that looks like the clean solution to me. *However*, I wanted to imitate the behavior of `M.solve_right(v)`, so I checked what this does.

Sorry for being late: wouldn't it be better to call the method just "interpolation", or even "interpolate"?

There is a single occurrence of `CALL FORMATS` in sagemath currently, but it seems to me that even there, https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matrices/sage/matrix/special.html#sage.matrix.special.ones_matrix, the documentation looks wrong and double backticks should be used:

However if multiple experienced Sage users want me to change the name, I can do it. Just let me know.

Concerning documentation I didn't get your point.. is there anything wrongly formatted that I should correct?

This function theoretically works for one variable, but:

1. The class for univariate polynomial rings is a completely different one. I would have to copy (and simplify) the code there, which I don't because:
2. There already is an interpolation function for one variable (`lagrange_polynomial()`) that works faster.

All in all the classes for univariate and multivariate polynomial rings are completely different, and the algorithms for interpolation are different as well.

That's why I thought the names should reflect that. I will change the name to `interpolation()` now, and hope that people will recognize that the appropriate function for one variable is `lagrange_polynomial()`. (I mentioned this function in my documentation.)
