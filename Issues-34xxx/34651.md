We add a method `multivariate_interpolation` to the `MPolynomialRing_base` class.

Given a bound on the degree and either point/value pairs or a function, it returns the respective interpolation polynomial.

The ticket is now ready for review.

As this is my first ever [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) contribution, I also want to ask the following questions:

1. Is my way/style of importing correct? Or should I do it differently?                                                                   
2. I use internal functions, i.e. functions defined inside a function. Is this fine as it is or should I rename them with an underscore in front?
3. Is my way of reporting a warning good or is there a better/"sage-style" way?

Also: The status badge says the linting doesn't pass... however from the log I can't really see what is going wrong.

Welcome to Sage, this looks like a great first patch!

Some comments regarding the docstring formatting (according to the usual Sage conventions):

- Use backticks ` instead of quotes " around variable names inside the text. This will make the HTML documentation render it as code.
- In general, double colons `::` are used if and only if the following block is indented; use a single colon `:` otherwise.
- `NOTE:` → `.. NOTE::`
- `WARNING::` → `.. WARNING::`
- `SEEALSO:` → `.. SEEALSO::`, and insert another blank line after.
- Do not indent the `ALGORITHM:` block.
- No need to indent the enumerated lists either.
- `a evaluable function` → `an evaluable function`, or maybe drop the articles "a" altogether in that list.

I'm also wondering if the method should just be called `interpolation()`: the "multivariate" part follows from its class.

Thanks for your feedback! I have fixed the points you mentioned.

Concerning the function name: `interpolation()` is certainly better for users to find the function. However I wanted to somehow make clear that the `lagrange_polynomial()` (for univariate poly rings) and `multivariate_interpolation()` (for multivariate poly rings) are different functions that also have different speed etc., and then only work for one or multiple variables, respectively.

In the end you are the Sage experts, so I'll call it whatever you all think is best, just let me know.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:13\" align=\"right\">comment:13</div>\n\nSorry, I got it wrong: Single backticks are for math and double backticks are for code. There are definitely too many similar-but-different markup languages out there. So, for example:\n\n```\n        * ``function`` -- evaluable function in `n` variables, where `n` is the\n          number of variables of the polynomial ring\n```\n\nI also seem to recall that Sage has a preference for formatting exceptions in accordance with Python's own style, i.e., starting with a lowercase letter and omitting the final punctuation, but I can't find a reference for this right now.\n\nThe warning about non-uniqueness of the solution can be useful, but I think it can also be very annoying: Imagine running this in a loop and getting spammed with an endless stream of those messages.

Sorry, I got it wrong: Single backticks are for math and double backticks are for code. There are definitely too many similar-but-different markup languages out there. So, for example:

```
        * ``function`` -- evaluable function in `n` variables, where `n` is the
          number of variables of the polynomial ring
```

I also seem to recall that Sage has a preference for formatting exceptions in accordance with Python's own style, i.e., starting with a lowercase letter and omitting the final punctuation, but I can't find a reference for this right now.

The warning about non-uniqueness of the solution can be useful, but I think it can also be very annoying: Imagine running this in a loop and getting spammed with an endless stream of those messages.

I have fixed the markup.

**Exceptions formatting:** I have scrolled the Sage source and saw both, so I'm not sure. I personally prefer full sentences, so I kept it like that. However if there is any convention, I'll change it.

There is a single occurrence of `CALL FORMATS` in sagemath currently, but it seems to me that even there, https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matrices/sage/matrix/special.html#sage.matrix.special.ones_matrix, the documentation looks wrong and double backticks should be used:

This function theoretically works for one variable, but:

1. The class for univariate polynomial rings is a completely different one. I would have to copy (and simplify) the code there, which I don't because:
2. There already is an interpolation function for one variable (`lagrange_polynomial()`) that works faster.

All in all the classes for univariate and multivariate polynomial rings are completely different, and the algorithms for interpolation are different as well.

That's why I thought the names should reflect that. I will change the name to `interpolation()` now, and hope that people will recognize that the appropriate function for one variable is `lagrange_polynomial()`. (I mentioned this function in my documentation.)
