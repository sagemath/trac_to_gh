The line

```
            sage: os.environ['SAGE_PEXPECT_LOG'] = "1"
```
which appears twice in `sage/doctest/forker.py` turns on logging for `pexpect`, and this results in two files being created in `DOT_SAGE/pexpect_logs` every time you doctest this file.

Doctests pass after deleting these lines, so let's remove those lines.
