This can be convenient for portability testing (`tox -e docker-...`), in particular 
- for `tox -e docker-...-incremental` (#34228), which needs to docker-pull multi-gigabyte images
- for developers who don't have Docker at work - because their sysadmins don't allow it

I am positive with the branch.

This branch seems to add a slight amount of time to the already long time that gitpod takes just to get to the command line prompt. Thus I wonder if the gitpod link is a useful addition to sage trac.
