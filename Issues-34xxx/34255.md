This can be convenient for portability testing (`tox -e docker-...`), in particular 
- for `tox -e docker-...-incremental` (#34228), which needs to docker-pull multi-gigabyte images
- for developers who don't have Docker at work - because their sysadmins don't allow it
- [#33103 comment:123](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/33103#comment:123)
- add-in from https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/blob/main/chunks/tool-docker/Dockerfile
