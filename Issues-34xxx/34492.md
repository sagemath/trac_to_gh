gmp sometimes calls `abort()`. (For example,[this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70435954) says "whenever you try to create or calculate a number with more than 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 limbs (or machine words), GMP will abort.") This can crash sage or result in cryptic error messages. 

Unfortunately, it seems that gmp does not provide a good way to trap these errors to provide helpful `OverFlow` error messages. (See the discussions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70435954) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3558684/avoiding-abort-in-libgmp).) So this may need an upstream fix. Jeroen Demeyer suggested an approach that could fix this in 2017 on the [gmp-discuss mailing list](https://gmplib.org/list-archives/gmp-discuss/2017-September/006144.html), but it seems that nothing came of it.

Even if we cannot improve the error messages, can we eliminate the crashes by using `sig_on()` / `sig_off()`?

This ticket came from a sage-devel discussion that includes the following two examples.

This crashes sage:

```
sage: def binnk3u(n,k):  return (n/k)**(k))
sage: n1=(2*10**3)
sage: d0=29004853178239
sage: n0=SR(log(n1))
sage: tt=binnk3u(n0+d0-1,(d0))
gmp: overflow in mpz type
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(no backtrace available)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
~/development/sage94/src/bin/sage-python: line 2: 55217 Abort trap: 6           sage -python "$@"
```
This should give a better error message:

```
sage: 2^(2^62)
gmp: overflow in mpz type
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)

   2190         if type(left) is type(right):

   2192         elif isinstance(left, Element):
   2193             return coercion_model.bin_op(left, right, operator.pow)

   2253 
   2254         if mpz_fits_slong_p(exp):

   2256 
   2257         # Raising to an exponent which doesn't fit in a long overflows

   2285 if n > 0:
   2286     x = PY_NEW(Integer)

   2288     mpz_pow_ui(x.value, self.value, n)
   2289     sig_off()

RuntimeError: Aborted
```
The message "gmp: overflow in mpz type" is printed to `stderr`, so some users might not see it, which would make the error messages even more cryptic.

According to [the page you referenced](https://gmplib.org/manual/Custom-Allocation), a gmp custom allocation must terminate execution (not just raise an exception), so there is a limit to what can be done, but it still might provide a solution, as you suggest.

    "No error return is allowed from any of these functions, if they return then they must have performed the specified operation. In particular note that allocate_function or reallocate_function mustn’t return NULL.

    Getting a different fatal error action is a good use for custom allocation functions, for example giving a graphical dialog rather than the default print to stderr. How much is possible when genuinely out of memory is another question though.

    There’s currently no defined way for the allocation functions to recover from an error such as out of memory, they must terminate program execution. A longjmp or throwing a C++ exception will have undefined results. This may change in the future."
