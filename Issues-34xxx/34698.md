We currently have the following behavior:

```
sage: M = ModularFormsRing(Gamma0(2))
sage: E4 = ModularForms(1, 4).0
sage: F = M(E4)
sage: F[4].parent()
Modular Forms space of dimension 1 for Modular Group SL(2,Z) of weight 4 over Rational Field
```
The parent of `F[4]` is wrong as the group should be `Gamma0(2)`.
