Hi. Sage is unable to generate algebraic normal form(ANF) results for a huge csv file containing S-Box LUT list and it kills the terminal. S-Box size is 5X5 bit. How to overcome this issue?

There's enough memory available.
I am reading each line from the csv file which contains 5X5 bit s-box LUT. There are around 1.2 Crores of such s-box LUT's in each line in the csv file. But the code kills the terminal after printing maximum of around 500 LUT line count followed by system shut down! 
However, I am able to print Nonlinearity of each LUT for entire csv file.. 

Each line of the csv file contains s-box LUT shown below:

0 8 4 12 2 10 6 15 1 9 5 13 3 11 23 14 16 24 20 30 18 26 22 28 17 29 21 25 27 19 7 31


The code to print algebraic normal form  (ANF) equation is given below:

from sage.crypto.sbox import SBox
import csv

count=0

with open('filepath/filename.csv') as f:
    for line in f:
    	
    	count+=1
    	
    	line1=line.replace('"','')
    	
        line2=line1.replace("\n","")
    	
        line3=line2.replace(' ',',')
    	
        int_list= list(map(int, line3.split(',')))
    	
        S=SBox(int_list)
    	
        print("Line{}".format(count))
        
        print(S.component_function([1]).algebraic_normal_form())

Problem was with memory, here:

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/crypto/boolean_function.pyx#L488-L509 

`R = BooleanPolynomialRing(self._nvariables,"x")` allocates a lof of memory.

I thought what if we stop recreating BooleanPolynomialRing every time we call `algebraic_normal_form`, like this:

```diff

+            R = BooleanPolynomialRing(self._nvariables,"x")
         G = R.gens()
         P = R(0)
 
```

After rebuilding sage I use this code:

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: from sage.crypto.sbox import SBox
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.pbori import BooleanPolynomialRing
sage: count = 0
sage: rings = {}
sage: with open("/tmp/sboxdataremote.csv") as f:
....:     for line in f:
....:         count += 1
....:         int_list = list(arr := np.fromstring(line, dtype=int, sep=" "))
....:         print(f"{count:>10} {arr}")
....:         S = SBox(int_list)
....:         cf = S.component_function([1])
....:         nv = cf.nvariables()
....:         R = rings.get(nv, None)
....:         if R is None:
....:             R = rings[nv] = BooleanPolynomialRing(nv, "x")
....:         anf = cf.algebraic_normal_form(R)
....:         print(f"{count:>10} {anf}")
```

Since `nv = cf.nvariables()` is 5, there is **one** BooleanPolynomialRing created, no memory is wasted and we can get millions of `anf = cf.algebraic_normal_form(R)` without fail:

```

But the error appears "algebraic_normal_form() takes no arguments (1 given)" in the terminal even after all the modifications. Please find all the screenshots attached.

That is because binary file `sage/crypto/boolean_function.cpython-3xx-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` was not rebuilt.

I'm afraid there's no other choice than to use https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html and https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/README.md to install sage from source code. 

**after ** `step 11. Type ./configure, followed by any options that you wish to use.` **and before** `step 13. Type make. That's it! Everything is automatic and non-interactive.` you should modify the `src/sage/crypto/boolean_function.pyx`

Then type `make`.  And it will build everything including new `boolean_function.cpython-3xx-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` with new `algebraic_normal_form(self, R=None)` that takes 1 optional argument R.

**step 14. Type ./sage to try it out.** and so on.

I personally never used those steps to build sage because I use Gentoo Linux and building from source code is usual/easy thing there.

That was just a quick dirty hack, problem is not fixed. We can not expect to pass `BooleanPolynomialRing` everywhere. It's the `BooleanPolynomialRing` that should be fixed.
