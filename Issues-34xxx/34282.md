Currently, as observed in [comment 7](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/34185#comment:7) of #34185, the method `is_present` of instances of class `TeXFile` runs into an exception if latex is not installed. For example:

```
sage: from sage.features.latex import LaTeXPackage
sage: LaTeXPackage("tkz-graph").is_present()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'kpsewhich'
```

The aim of the ticket is to fix this.

Done! Furthermore, I refactor the executable features not only to avoid duplicated code, but also since in my point of view it is not reasonable that just the `latex` feature has a stronger `is_functional` check.

I'm fine with your first suggestion. Concerning the second, the advantage is not clear to me. 

With your third suggestion I have a problem since in general I prefer to serialise condition checks if they only work in a certain order. I know that it is no problem any more with modern languages and compilers, since they implicitly serialise in the order they are written. But the syntax using `and` / `or` pretends a parallelism which is not given in such a situation.

AFAIK there is no feature that checks if `texlive` is just installed, no? Do you want to create a new feature or just replace the join with `pdflatex` by `latex`?

Here you want to check that "if f.is_present, then g.is_present". Right? My test just does that expressly.

> With your third suggestion I have a problem since in general I prefer to serialise condition checks if they only work in a certain order.

There is no parallelism here. My simple code exactly does what your code does. Note that

```
sage: 0 and 1
0
sage: 1 and 2
2
```
In `A and B`, `B` is never evaluated if `A` is false.

Convinced! I had *if and only if* in mind since AFAIK in reallity `f` is always present if `g` is.

I was saying *pretends a parallelism*.

So what is the advantage?

Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I know a time where you could not be sure that *`B` is never evaluated if `A` is false* (at least in `C`).

While fixing things, I could not resist from doing more than I intended. Sorry...

It seemed that TeXFile doesn't need to be a subclass of JoinFeature.

Instead, TeXFile now simply checks latex presence first.

Note that #34185 has a dependency on this ticket and I think this would break things there. More precisely, the method `joined_features` defined in class `Feature` will not work correctly for `TeX` files. So at least you should find another solution for that.

> More precisely, the method `joined_features` defined in class `Feature` will not work correctly for `TeX` files. So at least you should find another solution for that.

The purpose of this ticket as in description (but not as in old title) is to fix a **bug** in TeXFile feature, which did not check latex system in place before it check the presence of a TeX file (such as a latex package). This has nothing to do with #34185. 

Hence I think that any changes to TeXFile feature related with #34185 should be made in #34185 itself.

Moreover, as far as I understand #34185, the goal of #34185 is not clear to me and I doubt if the goal is reasonable. So the present ticket is better to be independent from #34185.

I think JoinFeature is not relevant for the bug. A joined feature is conceptually a new feature "A and B" combining A and B. TeXFile is a feature A that requires feature B. Conceptually it is "A => B".

Indeed, according to the examples given in the docstring of the class you are right. But it is at least misleading that most examples of joined features consist of just one:

```sage
sage: from sage.features.all import all_features
sage: from sage.features.join_feature import JoinFeature
sage: J = [F for F in all_features() if isinstance(F, JoinFeature)]
sage: len([F for F in J if len(F._features) == 1])
16
sage: len([F for F in J if len(F._features) > 1])
7
```

In these cases the instance of `JoinFeature` usually refers to a `SPKG` (for example `meataxe`) which is combined with a Python module (in the example `meataxe` this is `sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense`) implementing the integration of the new functionality into Sage. Since the Python module requires the `SPKG` the construction describes a dependency here, as well. But I confess that it is reverse on how I used it.

The name of a feature gives the `# optional` tag. I have used unary `JoinFeature`s to equip features such as `PythonModule` features with a tag name that differs from the systematic tag name.
