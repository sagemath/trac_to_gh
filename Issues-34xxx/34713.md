... and other updates related to IPython and Jupyter.

New standard package: `hatch_nodejs_version` (new build dep of `nbformat`)

Changed to a wheel package: `nbconvert` (because version 7.x tries to download some CSS at build time - see discussion in https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/1827)
