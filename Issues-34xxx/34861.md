This patch adds a method `QuaternionOrder.isomorphism_to()` which finds an isomorphism between two quaternion orders in the same quaternion algebra.

Algorithm: Two orders are isomorphic if and only if they are conjugate (Skolem–Noether), hence for isomorphic orders `O₁,O₂` the lattice `I = O₁·O₂` is principal. We search for a generator by minimizing the quadratic form associated to `I`; conjugation by such a generator then defines an isomorphism between `O₁` and `O₂`.

To make the computed ring isomorphism work correctly, it seems necessary to patch `RingHomomorphism_im_gens`: The `._im_gens_()` method on elements will necessarily use the generators of the quaternion *algebra*, not the order.
