The instructions given in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/launching.html#setting-up-sagemath-as-a-jupyter-kernel-in-an-existing-jupyter-notebook-or-jupyterlab-installation refer to a command "along the lines" of

```
ln -s $(sage -sh -c 'ls -d $SAGE_VENV/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath') $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/sagemath-dev
```
to make the SageMath kernel available to an existing (system) Jupyter installation. The actual kernel directory is (cf. https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/kernels.html#kernel-specs) in `$HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels`, so `/kernels` should be appended to the respective lines.
