Using Sage on Conda (installed as in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html#sec-installation-conda-develop), the following gives an empty page in Chrome. The same happens with the options `viewer='threejs'` or `viewer='jsmol'`. See attached file graphic.html.

```
sage: plot3d(lambda u,v:(u^2+v^2)/4-2,(-2,2),(-2,2)).show()
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object
```
The file hardcodes the script as `/Users/yzh/mambaforge/envs/sage-build/share/threejs-sage/r122/three.min.js`, which does not exist.
There is, however, a folder `/Users/yzh/mambaforge/envs/sage-build/share/threejs`

```
(base) yzh@Yuans-MacBook threejs $ ls
LICENSE      build        package.json version
README.md    examples     src
```

The problem does not appear in Jupyter Notebook.

The problem does not appear either if the option `online=True` is provided. See attached file graphic_online_true.html.
