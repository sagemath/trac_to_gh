For example https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/sagemath/sage, which appears as a link in our manuals, for instance,

- find the link "going to Gitpod" in https://113a817a9b18c078a108e31522579eab1afac19c--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/developer/index.html

does not work because the workspace directory is `/workspace/sage`, not `/workspace/sagetrac-mirror`
