These show up in quantum mechanics computations and are a variation of skew commuting polynomials (cf. the exterior algebra) satisfying `yx = q^{B_xy} xy` for all variables that index fixed a skew symmetric bilinear matrix `B`.

We provide a simple initial implementation.

Here is a very simple implementation for them that feeds off as much as possible. Likely could be improved (e.g., not relying on `FreeMonoid` as a backend for the basis), but it works for now.

is there any other structure on that algebra ? a coproduct or co-module structure ?

With just x and y, this is sometimes called the quantum plane, right ?


minor remark:

```
return tuple([self.monomial(g) for g in self._indices.gens()])
```
could create directly the tuple

I am not sure. I will do some searching.

Yes, it does. Should I add this as a comment to the doc? (Hopefully you can respond quickly as I will be leaving for home soon.)

It is actually (slightly) faster for whatever reason to do `tuple([generator])` than `tuple(generator)`:

```
sage: %timeit T = tuple(i for i in range(100))
2.33 µs ± 13.5 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit T = tuple([i for i in range(100)])
1.44 µs ± 17 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
```
Still remains completely counterintuitive to me.

So it doesn't seem like they are not known to carry any further natural structure since I can't find anything about that in this survey:

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02355445

Although we can build a comodule structure on them using the quantum coordinate ring of SL<sub>n</sub> as a generalization of exercise (3) in Section 3.4 of

http://www.mate.unlp.edu.ar/~ggarcia/encuentros/notas-curso-qg-ha.pdf

Maybe in Sage we should call them `QuantumPolynomials`? That is probably a better name than what I initially chose. I wasn't very happy with the name.

There is a slightly more general construction that could be done with `q_{ij}` not being `q^{b_{ij}}` but more generally `q_{ij} q_{ji} = 1`. Although that might be best for a followup ticket as that will be a fairly different implementation.

Thank you.

It’s definitely an interesting question as the classical case, and maybe even the related geometry, suggests that there should be additional structure (maybe also from the iterated Ore extensions).

What do you think about the name though? Would you say `QuantumPolynomials` is better than `qCommutingPolynomials`?

A more trivial point but do you think I should add a quantum plane note to the doc before we merge this initial version?
