(from #33713)

In Sage, `Schemes` are `Sets`. An `EllipticCurve` is in `Schemes` but does not support `element_class` etc.

```

A quick guess: wouldn't it be because affine schemes have a natural notion of elements (prime ideals in their coordinate rings), whereas more general schemes do not (or it would require to use the knowledge of the way affine charts are glued together)? An elliptic curve is a projective scheme, so defining what a point is would require to specify in which affine chart we are.

Here is an example which seems to indicate that projective schemes/spaces do not support `element_class`, which seems consistent which the fact that elliptic curves do not support `element_class`:

```

Well, general schemes have points exactly like affine schemes have. I think there is no difference here.

What I wanted to express in my previous message was that defining a natural data structure for points in a non-affine scheme seems complicated in general (because in theory you need the data of a neighborhood which is isomorphic to an affine scheme). But indeed, for projective schemes of the form `Proj(R/I)` where `R` is a polynomial ring and `I` is a homogeneous ideal (most cases of non-affine schemes in Sage, I believe), there is a convenient representation via prime homogeneous ideals saturated with respect to the irrelevant ideal.",

Ah, ok, thanks for this precision.

On a side note, this ticket might also apply to projective spaces, which seem to have a similar behavior. Perhaps this happens for all projective schemes in Sage.
