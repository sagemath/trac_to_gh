The expansion is always going to be into the infinite variable polynomial ring, and the variable with largest index occuring in the expansion is implied by the composition.\n\n\nI might want to do the expansion in a finite polynomial ring of my choosing. You will probably have to do something slightly special when the number of variables is less than the natural minimal number.\n\n> The only reason I see to have a number of variables argument is to have a fewer number of variables. Is that a thing that one would ever want to do mathematically? I know there is sometimes a reason to do that for expanding Schur polynomials as GLn characters, which is in my head as an analogous thing.\n\n\nOn the contrary, you might want it to be living in a larger polynomial ring. You are equating the weak compositions up to trailing zeros, but what if I want to look at all key polynomials in, say, a 4 variable polynomial ring only? This can matter for coercion and substitution purposes.\n\nActually, that makes me think we probably should also implement a true finite number of variables version. Mathematically, you are secretly implementing the projective limit coming from a tower of polynomial rings under the natural projections (which when precomposed with the natural inclusions give the identity map on each component). The key basis with `n` variables is naturally a subset of the key basis of `n + k` variables. The integer vectors are already available:\n\n```\nsage: IV3 = IntegerVectors(k=3)\nsage: IV3\nInteger vectors of length 3\n```\nThis might also give some speedups for some of the computations.\n\nLastly, instead of modifying `_element_constructor_`, you are probably better off implementing a new `_monomial` function to strip trailing 0s in the infinite variable case. The infinite polynomial ring would then be handled by the coercion mentioned above. This would make other construction methods more uniform.",

I might want to do the expansion in a finite polynomial ring of my choosing. You will probably have to do something slightly special when the number of variables is less than the natural minimal number.

> The only reason I see to have a number of variables argument is to have a fewer number of variables. Is that a thing that one would ever want to do mathematically? I know there is sometimes a reason to do that for expanding Schur polynomials as GLn characters, which is in my head as an analogous thing.


On the contrary, you might want it to be living in a larger polynomial ring. You are equating the weak compositions up to trailing zeros, but what if I want to look at all key polynomials in, say, a 4 variable polynomial ring only? This can matter for coercion and substitution purposes.

Actually, that makes me think we probably should also implement a true finite number of variables version. Mathematically, you are secretly implementing the projective limit coming from a tower of polynomial rings under the natural projections (which when precomposed with the natural inclusions give the identity map on each component). The key basis with `n` variables is naturally a subset of the key basis of `n + k` variables. The integer vectors are already available:

```
sage: IV3 = IntegerVectors(k=3)
sage: IV3
Integer vectors of length 3
```
This might also give some speedups for some of the computations.

Lastly, instead of modifying `_element_constructor_`, you are probably better off implementing a new `_monomial` function to strip trailing 0s in the infinite variable case. The infinite polynomial ring would then be handled by the coercion mentioned above. This would make other construction methods more uniform.

The string representation of the `Parent` is better saying “Key polynomial basis of {BR}”.

The docstring of the `Parent` should start with a one line description, and possibly a longer more mathematical description. Afterwards, the lines after `EXAMPLES:` is over-indented.

You don’t need to hold onto `_basis_keys`. This is already done by `_indices` (or if you want a little less encapsulation breaking, `self.basis().keys()`).

Turns out this only works in the finite case. In the infinite case:

```
sage: R.<z> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = z[1] + z[1]*z[2]*z[3]
sage: f.subs({z[1]:z[0]})
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Input In [3], in <cell line: 1>()
----> 1 f.subs({z[Integer(1)]:z[Integer(0)]})

File ~/Applications/sage/src/sage/structure/element.pyx:830, in sage.structure.element.Element.subs()
    828 if str(gen) in kwds:
    829     variables.append(kwds[str(gen)])
--> 830 elif in_dict and gen in in_dict:
    831     variables.append(in_dict[gen])
    832 else:

TypeError: unhashable type: 'InfinitePolynomialGen'
```

See #34581.

<a id='comment:46'></a>Thanks for the updates.

I don't quite understand why that code works for the infinite case. I think depending on #34581 is the right way to go. We should be able to fix that one fairly quickly.

Some more comments on this:

- Rename `poly_gen()` -> `poly_gens()` as it returns all of the generators.
- `while f.monomials():` seems wasteful; you can simply check `while f:` (is not 0).
- In `from_polynomial()`, I would separate out the `self._indices(m).trim()` into a separate helper method
  {{{#!python
if self._k:
    def build_index(m):
        return self._indices(m)
else:
    def build_index(m):
        return self._indices(m).trim()
  }}}
  Furthermore I am not certain that the monomials and exponents will always be given in lex order. While it is a bit more computationally intensive, I think you should call `max(f.exponents())`. You can then use that to build the monomial and/or get the coefficient. This allows you to remove the code duplication.
- Since you have an element class, you are better implementing `_mul_` there as that avoids some indirection.
