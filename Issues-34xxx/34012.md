I am not against this change, but why replace lambdas by sub functions? I ask because in the instances here, lambdas do not look ugly.

So the checker didn't understand the cython import statement `cimport`, and suggested a fix without understanding. In this case, I think it is more important to satisfy human beings than the ignorant checker. More basic imports are usually placed in front. In this case, `cimport cython` is more basic.
