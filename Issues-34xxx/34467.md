As reported in[comment:25](#comment%3A25):ticket:34303, `EllipticCurveHom_velusqrt` accidentally computes an irrational isogeny for curves defined over `GF(3)` with `7` rational points. The reason is that the computation internally requires a point lying outside the kernel, which *only in this one specific case* will be defined over a cubic instead of a quadratic extension. This in turn implies the linear factors in the numerator of the isogeny won't match up in conjugate pairs, causing the problem.

Quick fix: Simply restrict the implementation to degrees `≥ 9`. Since the older `EllipticCurveIsogeny` implementation is much faster for degrees this small anyway, this restriction won't be a problem for any remotely realistic code.

How about adding a doctest for this problematic case with an explanation and a link to this ticket?
