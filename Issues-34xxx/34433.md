We upgrade `pillow` to 9.2.0 

We modernize how we pass build options to the package, using the PEP 517 `--config-settings` mechanism. This is the same as in #34421, where it was needed as a critical bug fix. (For `pillow` there is no bug because the analysis in #33138 is still true for our current version of `pillow`.)
