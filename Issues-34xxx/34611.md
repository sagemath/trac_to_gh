Using the recursive definition

```
exp(f) = 1 + int(f' *exp(f))
```
we can make the computation of the exponential almost the same as a single multiplication.

The drawback is that we do not benefit from the error handling in `compose`.

sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)

sage: g = exp(f)
sage: %time _ = g[500]

This is not a problem if we use dense series (of course) - so there are at least three solutions:

* we could create a dense ring in `exp`,

* we could modify `Stream_uninitialized.get_coefficient` to compute coefficients in order,

* we could ignore the problem, and tell the user to use dense series.

There is also another solution: Tell the user to compute some earlier coefficients:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: f = L(lambda n: randint(1, 10), valuation=1)
sage: g = exp(f)
sage: %time _ = g[100]
CPU times: user 8.87 ms, sys: 18 µs, total: 8.88 ms
Wall time: 8.74 ms
sage: %time _ = g[200]
CPU times: user 38.1 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 38.1 ms
Wall time: 37.8 ms
sage: %time _ = g[500]
CPU times: user 678 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 678 ms
Wall time: 678 ms
```

However, I like option (2) the best because there is not a reasonable situation where we would not essentially end up computing all of the coefficients (ultimately in order):

```
sage: len(g._coeff_stream._cache)
501
```

What do you think about making `Stream_uninitialized` always dense.  This is essentially the same as (2) above, just with less overhead.

This could be done either here or in #34636, which is ready for review. I could then make #34636 a dependency for this ticket.  I could even do a doctest there, because the problem arises already with, for example, the implicit definition of the Catalan numbers:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ); C = L.undefined(); C.define(1 + z*C^2)
sage: %time _ = C[500]
...
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object

sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ, sparse=True); C = L.undefined(); C.define(1 + z*C^2)
sage: %time _ = C[350]
CPU times: user 201 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 201 ms
Wall time: 201 ms
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ, sparse=False); C = L.undefined(); C.define(1 + z*C^2)
