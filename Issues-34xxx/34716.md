As of Sage 9.7, this causes an assertion failure:

```sage
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(487^2), [311,205])
sage: G = E.abelian_group().torsion_subgroup(42)
sage: P, Q = G.torsion_subgroup(6).gens()
sage: G.discrete_log(2*P + 3*Q, [P, Q])
```

The reason is that the `p`-power part of the group generated by `P` and `Q` is trivial for some prime(s) `p` dividing the group order of `G`, which throws off `_discrete_log_pgroup()`. Easy fix.

Thanks, added the check to the loop in `.discrete_log()`. I didn't remove the check in `_discrete_log_pgroup()` because the trivial group is a pâ€‘group after all, so the function should behave correctly.

As it is a non-public function (whose name starts with an underline) only for internal use, you may restrict the use of the function only for non-trivial p-groups, perhaps just with a comment about the restriction on the input. Thus you may avoid the duplicate check.

But if you still want to keep it for the reason you mentioned, just let me know.
