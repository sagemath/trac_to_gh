Keywords: FriCAS

Our FriCAS interface always uses radical expressions
for roots of algebraic equations, which is often suboptimal.
This ticket will implement an option to use implicit roots
(not expressed in terms of radicals).

See [this fricas-devel post](https://groups.google.com/g/fricas-devel/c/1egf0EkBMH4/m/Zn16FI0CBQAJ) for context.
