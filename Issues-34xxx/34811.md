The methods `.rational_maps()` and `.x_rational_map()` for `WeierstrassIsomorphism` return polynomials, but the same methods for other `EllipticCurveHom` return rational maps (i.e., elements of the fraction field).

For consistency, these methods should return the same types in all child classes of `EllipticCurveHom`, despite the rational maps actually having denominator `1` in this case.
