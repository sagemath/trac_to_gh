I'll look into this. I also suggest to test against the Wolfram engine (newer than my (bootleg) copy of Mathematica) : I can look into this in a virtual Debian machine running under Windows. Is that sufficient ?

That's where  I fixed it (and in `src/sage/functions/hyperbolic.py`), doctests in `src/sage/interfaces/mathematica.py`.

But I currently can't push to trac (authentication problem, notwithstanding the recent upgrade of my key to ED25519)...
