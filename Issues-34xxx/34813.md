it seems that sphinx does some kind of discovery to establish hierarchy of subheadings in the text, and while you can certainly use
`~~~` and `<sup>^</sup>` and other such undertitles in the text, they should not contradict the hierarchy already established.
And in the file we fix here these two were both used for the same level of subheadings, thus the warning.
