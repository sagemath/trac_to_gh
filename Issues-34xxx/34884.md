this is hardcoded in the file `src/sage/functions/jacobi.py`

should be very easy to fix, and add a doctest

I would fix it like this

replace m by m * m in line 398 of src/sage/functions/jacobi.py :

```
397            elif self.kind == 'dn':
398               return -m * jacobi_sn(x, m) * jacobi_cn(x, m)
```

I do not know how to add a doctest.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

m stands for k*k.

If I correct the dn elliptic jacobi function first derivative, sn elliptic jacobi function satisfies the 2nd order ODE :

```
(-((k**2*(1-jacobi('sn',x,k)**2)+1-k**2*jacobi('sn',x,k)**2))*jacobi('sn',x,k)\
+(1+k**2)*jacobi_sn(x,k)-2*k**2*jacobi_sn(x,k)**3).expand().factor()
```

first line being the corrected 2nd derivative of sn  elliptic jacobi.

same issue with diff(jacobi('nd',x,k),x,1) = 𝑘cd(𝑥|𝑘)sd(𝑥|𝑘)
