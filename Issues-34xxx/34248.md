<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
This seems to be a minor big-fix upgrade, because the description of this version is:

```
Version 5.3: Released on May 17, 2022.
  An error in splitting for cases -q and -pb could cause some graphs
  to be output multiple times in version 5.2 (but not earlier).
  Also removed erroneous interpretation of CLOCKS_PER_SEC.
```
The patchbots and "Build & Test" do not seem to test the upgrade (I guess because it is an optional package), so I ran `make testlong` on [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com). There were no errors other than a known random failure that is unrelated to this ticket.
