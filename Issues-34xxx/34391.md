Having upgraded downstream, here is a list of issues:

1) Build fails because a garbage collector needs to be specified via a preprocessor macro when using gap's headers. This is included in the CPPFLAGS in gap's own `sysinfo.gap`, but Sage doesn't read it when building.

2) Build fails due to API changes in `OpenOutputStream` and `CloseOutput`

3) Colored prompt is on by default, which breaks the pexpect interface.

4) The `NaturalHomomorphism` function, used in `groups.abelian_gps.abelian_group_gap`, has been removed.

5) The functions `IsPrimitive` and `IsTransitive` changed behavior and now return false if the group does not act on the given set, breaking some tests:

```
File "/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py", line 4363, in sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup.PermutationGroup_generic.is_transitive
Failed example:
    G.is_transitive([1,4,5])
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py", line 4428, in sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup.PermutationGroup_generic.is_primitive
Failed example:
    G.is_primitive([1,2,3])
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

6) Computation of permutation group generators has changed, breaking some tests. In particular, using `algorithm=smaller` now does not make any difference in many examples.

7) Several trivial test failures due to different choice of generators or minor syntax changes.

The branch fixes (2), (3), (4) and (7). For (5), we need to decide whether we want to follow the new behavior in GAP, or reimplement the old behavior in some other way. For (6), some tests need to be updated or removed.

regarding (5), I don't think we need to reimplement, as `transitive` and `primitive` are dealing with group *action* on a domain, and are not defined, mathematically, for arbitrary subsets of the domain.
(perhaps we should have a deprecation, in case False is returned, printing a warning about the change in behavior) 

How about (1) - should `spkg-install` source `sysinfo.gap` ?

I think the other segfaults happen because `gap_element_repr` and `gap_element_str` (the two `capture_stdout` callers) call `GAP_ValueGlobalVariable` but don't use `GAP_Enter`/`GAP_Leave`. 

As a proof of concept, I applied the above patch but also moved the try/GAP_Enter/finally/GAP_Leave block from `capture_stdout` to `gap_element_repr`/`gap_element_str` ([patch](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/66f857c7c10e24e95fc429fd3c6ebd5676e29b61/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/patches/copy-string-before-gap-leave.patch)), and I didn't see a single crash in two test runs (it used to happen every time).

I have tested the last commmit (a6c293d) using system gap 4.12.0, on x86_64, x86_64-musl and i686 (void linux) with all long tests passing.

I don't have aarch64 to test.

I'm getting

```
    In file included from sage/coding/codecan/codecan.c:5227:
    /home/scratch/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sagetrac-mirror/local/include/gap/gasman_intern.h:17:2: error: #error This file must only be included if GASMAN is used
       17 | #error This file must only be included if GASMAN is used
```
what's the fix here?

In case it's useful, here are the patches I had to use for gap 4.12.0 on void linux:

https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/tree/ed7862591d1ff3a617b58ecbe2efdbb5343d508b/srcpkgs/gap/patches

I think two of those are PR 5077 and PR 5091 already mentioned in this ticket. The third patch I needed to fix something in atlasrep package.

Note also that:
a. package names have changed (at least the name of the directories changed case and removed version numbers)
b. `sysinfo.gap` used to be installed in `/usr/share/gap` and now is installed in `/usr/lib/gap`.

Sagemath (9.7 and 9.8.beta2) is working fine with this, but note I only install the minimal set of packages that are standard in sage.

For Sage's installed GAP, this will be `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/gap/`

Try packages which build executables and/or GAP kernel extensions (the latter need `gac`)
E.g. `grape` and `crypting`.

I think I will submit my changes in a separate ticket, since the present update seems ready and does not make things any worse on aarch64 as far as I can tell. What is the best way to submit a ticket/change which depends on an open one and touches the same lines of code? I think I will just branch off this one and mark the ticket as a dependency.

I spoke too soon - tested with unclean SAGE_LOCAL :-(

With everything clean, while building `gap_packages`, I get

```
gcc -g -O2 -fPIC -MQ gen/src/crypting.o -MMD -MP -MF gen/src/crypting.d -g -O2 -Wno-implicit-function-declaration -Wno-implicit-function-declaration -o gen/src/crypting.o -I/home/scratch/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sagetrac-mirror/local/share/gap/build -I/home/scratch/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sagetrac-mirror/local/share/gap/src -I/home/scratch/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sagetrac-mirror/local/share/gap -DUSE_GASMAN=1 -c src/crypting.c
In file included from /home/scratch/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sagetrac-mirror/local/share/gap/src/gap_all.h:51,

   19 | #include "version.h"
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
```
The problem is that `version.h` gets installed into `SAGE_LOCAL/include/gap` - a location unknown to `crypting` package makefile.

Do you need to look for packages in `share/gap`? There should not be any.
That's why I doubt your line from `​16c2ccb`:

```
s = str_to_bytes(sage.env.GAP_LIB_DIR + ";" + sage.env.GAP_SHARE_DIR, FS_ENCODING, "surrogateescape")

That is not only for packages. Without this, `libgap` can't find the `lib/init.g` file which is installed under `share/gap` and just crashes on initialization.

Looks like `packagemanager` expects a `lib/gap/bin` dir to exist, which is not created by `make install`

https://github.com/gap-packages/PackageManager/blob/master/gap/PackageManager.gd#L294

Simply creating an empty `bin` subdir fixes the test.

My commit is just replicating that for the `libgap` call in sage.

I must say I've no idea what's going on there. I don't even know any more where Sage stores info on installed by `sdh_install` data.

The upstream build system likely forgets to use `$(DESTDIR)` in some `mkdir` commands. We've seen this before in other packages.

Note that, if I'm not mistaken, `io` is needed for `atlasrep` and only to hit the network in the absence of `curl` and `wget`.

An alternative is to configure atlasrep to not hit the network by default
(very easy: https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/gap/patches/atlasrep-dont_use_network_by_default.patch).

I'm not sure what's better for sage.

I'm hitting a snag while testing with `gap_packages` installed on macOS 13.0.1.

Not sure whether this is reproducible on older macOS - everything is fine on Linux. Note that package `io` has a "GAP kernel module", i.e. a special dynamic library which extends GAP capabilities (not dissimilar to Python extension modules with, say, parts written in C).

I can also reproduce this at the Sage prompt (after I remove pre-built GAP images):

Dima pointed me here.

I already communicated various comments to him on our (GAP's) issue tracker. But I also just had a look at the overall diff for the changes so far. Some remarks:

We have a new helper function `CALL_WITH_STREAM` which you could use to rewrite your `capture_stdout` with pure GAP. As an example, in `GAP.jl` (Julia interface to GAP), I use these two helpers; adapting that code to match `capture_stdout` is straight-forward. Note that I use `SetPrintFormattingStatus` there to avoid diffs caused by the width of the user's terminal; but if you want to 100% faithfully reproduce what GAP does, then leave that out.

```
BindGlobal( "StringDisplayObj",
function(obj)
  local str, out;
  str := "";
  out := OutputTextString(str, false);
  SetPrintFormattingStatus(out, false);
  CALL_WITH_STREAM(out, Display, [obj]);
  CloseStream(out);
  return str;
end );

BindGlobal( "StringViewObj",
function(obj)
  local str, out;
  str := "";
  out := OutputTextString(str, false);
  SetPrintFormattingStatus(out, false);
  CALL_WITH_STREAM(out, ViewObj, [obj]);
  CloseStream(out);
  return str;
end );
```
This is of course in the end equivalent to what `capture_stdout` does, but while `CALL_WITH_STREAM` is also undocumented, it'll be more stable than calling internal kernel functions like  `OpenOutputStream`. We could also eventually offer a documented, high-level version of it as `CallWithStream`; the main reason that's not yet there is that I first wanted to validate the design. If Sage also finds it useful, that would be a strong motivation to provide a fully documented `CallWithStream` in GAP 4.13. In addition or alternatively, functions like `StringViewObj` or `StringPrint` could be provided, but there it is already less clear that we can agree on a common version (see `SetPrintFormattingStatus` ...) ?



- Another point: you could replace your uses of `GVarName` and `AssGVar` by `GAP_AssignGlobalVariable` (the performance overhead of re-calling `GVarName` should be miniscule; if `hold_reference` ever is called in a tight loop, that code likely has more serious problems than that...

- alternatively just remove `hold_reference` (nothing uses it?)

- remove `NewBag` and `CallbackForAllBags` from `gap_includes.pxd` ?

- there are a lot of other things that could be replaced by "official" libgap API usage, e.g. `IS_INT` -> `GAP_IsInt`, `IS_INTOBJ` -> `GAP_IsSmallInt`, `SUM` -> `GAP_SUM`, `VAL_MACFLOAT` -> `GAP_ValueMacFloat`, etc. -- most of these were added specifically for use by Sage years ago but apparently are not actually used by Sage?

```
    argv[8] = "-x"    # set the "screen" width so that GAP is less likely to
    argv[9] = "4096"  # insert newlines when printing objects
                      # 4096 unfortunately is the hard-coded max, but should
                      # be long enough for most cases

```

You also have the following:

```
    argv[1] = "-l"
    s = str_to_bytes(gap_root(), FS_ENCODING, "surrogateescape")
    argv[2] = s

```

This shouldn't be necessary anymore in 4.12.2 (due in ~2 weeks), thanks to https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/5193

This ticket is just an effort to get the ball rolling towards upgrading to GAP 4.12. Improvements to the intetface to libgap should not take place here, it's heavy enough as it is.

We are still hoping that https://pypi.org/project/gappy-system/ (also https://github.com/embray/gappy) will be a proper replacement for our libgap interface, but unfortunately gappy is  stalled, as @embray is at greener pastures nowadays.

That makes perfect sense. So, view this as an offer: if someone would like to tackle cleaning up some of these things, feel free to contact me for assistance.


In other news, as some of you are probably already aware, we just release GAP 4.12.2 which should make some of the patches here unnecessary.
