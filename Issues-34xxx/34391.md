<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

Having upgraded downstream, here is a list of issues:

1) Build fails because a garbage collector needs to be specified via a preprocessor macro when using gap's headers. This is included in the CPPFLAGS in gap's own `sysinfo.gap`, but Sage doesn't read it when building.

2) Build fails due to API changes in `OpenOutputStream` and `CloseOutput`

3) Colored prompt is on by default, which breaks the pexpect interface.

4) The `NaturalHomomorphism` function, used in `groups.abelian_gps.abelian_group_gap`, has been removed.

5) The functions `IsPrimitive` and `IsTransitive` changed behavior and now return false if the group does not act on the given set, breaking some tests:

```
File "/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py", line 4363, in sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup.PermutationGroup_generic.is_transitive
Failed example:
    G.is_transitive([1,4,5])
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py", line 4428, in sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup.PermutationGroup_generic.is_primitive
Failed example:
    G.is_primitive([1,2,3])
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

6) Computation of permutation group generators has changed, breaking some tests. In particular, using `algorithm=smaller` now does not make any difference in many examples.

7) Several trivial test failures due to different choice of generators or minor syntax changes.

regarding (5), I don't think we need to reimplement, as `transitive` and `primitive` are dealing with group *action* on a domain, and are not defined, mathematically, for arbitrary subsets of the domain.
(perhaps we should have a deprecation, in case False is returned, printing a warning about the change in behavior) 

How about (1) - should `spkg-install` source `sysinfo.gap` ?

I think that is fine for gap packages but not for downstream packages. I guess it is a stop gap, but a standard way of setting the flags should be provided. A .pc file or at least a config utility. You shouldn't have to search for settings in an obscure internal file. This is a genuine upstream defect in my opinion.

I am seeing a bunch of segfaults on aarch64 with GAP 4.12.0 and this branch. The following patch, which copies the output string before calling `GAP_Leave`, seems to fix almost all of the segfaults, but not 100% of them (see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/192548#issuecomment-1256686607 for more details):

I think the other segfaults happen because `gap_element_repr` and `gap_element_str` (the two `capture_stdout` callers) call `GAP_ValueGlobalVariable` but don't use `GAP_Enter`/`GAP_Leave`. 

As a proof of concept, I applied the above patch but also moved the try/GAP_Enter/finally/GAP_Leave block from `capture_stdout` to `gap_element_repr`/`gap_element_str` ([patch](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/66f857c7c10e24e95fc429fd3c6ebd5676e29b61/pkgs/applications/science/math/sage/patches/copy-string-before-gap-leave.patch)), and I didn't see a single crash in two test runs (it used to happen every time).

In case it's useful, here are the patches I had to use for gap 4.12.0 on void linux:

https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/tree/ed7862591d1ff3a617b58ecbe2efdbb5343d508b/srcpkgs/gap/patches

I think two of those are PR 5077 and PR 5091 already mentioned in this ticket. The third patch I needed to fix something in atlasrep package.

Note also that:
a. package names have changed (at least the name of the directories changed case and removed version numbers)
b. `sysinfo.gap` used to be installed in `/usr/share/gap` and now is installed in `/usr/lib/gap`.

Sagemath (9.7 and 9.8.beta2) is working fine with this, but note I only install the minimal set of packages that are standard in sage.

For Sage's installed GAP, this will be `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/gap/`

Try packages which build executables and/or GAP kernel extensions (the latter need `gac`)
E.g. `grape` and `crypting`.

I think I will submit my changes in a separate ticket, since the present update seems ready and does not make things any worse on aarch64 as far as I can tell. What is the best way to submit a ticket/change which depends on an open one and touches the same lines of code? I think I will just branch off this one and mark the ticket as a dependency.

Edit: Opened #34701, sorry for the noise!

I spoke too soon - tested with unclean SAGE_LOCAL :-(

With everything clean, while building `gap_packages`, I get

```
gcc -g -O2 -fPIC -MQ gen/src/crypting.o -MMD -MP -MF gen/src/crypting.d -g -O2 -Wno-implicit-function-declaration -Wno-implicit-function-declaration -o gen/src/crypting.o -I/home/scratch/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sagetrac-mirror/local/share/gap/build -I/home/scratch/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sagetrac-mirror/local/share/gap/src -I/home/scratch/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sagetrac-mirror/local/share/gap -DUSE_GASMAN=1 -c src/crypting.c
In file included from /home/scratch/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sagetrac-mirror/local/share/gap/src/gap_all.h:51,
                 from /home/scratch/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sagetrac-mirror/local/share/gap/src/compiled.h:26,
                 from src/crypting.c:5:
/home/scratch/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sagetrac-mirror/local/share/gap/src/modules.h:19:10: fatal error: version.h: No such file or directory
   19 | #include "version.h"
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
```
The problem is that `version.h` gets installed into `SAGE_LOCAL/include/gap` - a location unknown to `crypting` package makefile.

Ideally libgap should know where to look for its files without needing to pass the paths with `-l`, but apparently that's not the case (it works fine in the gap command line though, `GAPInfo.RootPaths` returns both paths, `lib` and `share`).

Do you need to look for packages in `share/gap`? There should not be any.
That's why I doubt your line from `​16c2ccb`:

That is not only for packages. Without this, `libgap` can't find the `lib/init.g` file which is installed under `share/gap` and just crashes on initialization.

Looks like `packagemanager` expects a `lib/gap/bin` dir to exist, which is not created by `make install`

https://github.com/gap-packages/PackageManager/blob/master/gap/PackageManager.gd#L294

Simply creating an empty `bin` subdir fixes the test.

My commit is just replicating that for the `libgap` call in sage.

Not sure whether this is reproducible on older macOS - everything is fine on Linux. Note that package `io` has a "GAP kernel module", i.e. a special dynamic library which extends GAP capabilities (not dissimilar to Python extension modules with, say, parts written in C).

I can also reproduce this at the Sage prompt (after I remove pre-built GAP images):

Dima pointed me here.

I already communicated various comments to him on our (GAP's) issue tracker. But I also just had a look at the overall diff for the changes so far. Some remarks:

We have a new helper function `CALL_WITH_STREAM` which you could use to rewrite your `capture_stdout` with pure GAP. As an example, in `GAP.jl` (Julia interface to GAP), I use these two helpers; adapting that code to match `capture_stdout` is straight-forward. Note that I use `SetPrintFormattingStatus` there to avoid diffs caused by the width of the user's terminal; but if you want to 100% faithfully reproduce what GAP does, then leave that out.

```
BindGlobal( "StringDisplayObj",
function(obj)
  local str, out;
  str := "";
  out := OutputTextString(str, false);
  SetPrintFormattingStatus(out, false);
  CALL_WITH_STREAM(out, Display, [obj]);
  CloseStream(out);
  return str;
end );

BindGlobal( "StringViewObj",
function(obj)
  local str, out;
  str := "";
  out := OutputTextString(str, false);
  SetPrintFormattingStatus(out, false);
  CALL_WITH_STREAM(out, ViewObj, [obj]);
  CloseStream(out);
  return str;
end );
```
This is of course in the end equivalent to what `capture_stdout` does, but while `CALL_WITH_STREAM` is also undocumented, it'll be more stable than calling internal kernel functions like  `OpenOutputStream`. We could also eventually offer a documented, high-level version of it as `CallWithStream`; the main reason that's not yet there is that I first wanted to validate the design. If Sage also finds it useful, that would be a strong motivation to provide a fully documented `CallWithStream` in GAP 4.13. In addition or alternatively, functions like `StringViewObj` or `StringPrint` could be provided, but there it is already less clear that we can agree on a common version (see `SetPrintFormattingStatus` ...) ?



- Another point: you could replace your uses of `GVarName` and `AssGVar` by `GAP_AssignGlobalVariable` (the performance overhead of re-calling `GVarName` should be miniscule; if `hold_reference` ever is called in a tight loop, that code likely has more serious problems than that...

- alternatively just remove `hold_reference` (nothing uses it?)

- remove `NewBag` and `CallbackForAllBags` from `gap_includes.pxd` ?

- there are a lot of other things that could be replaced by "official" libgap API usage, e.g. `IS_INT` -> `GAP_IsInt`, `IS_INTOBJ` -> `GAP_IsSmallInt`, `SUM` -> `GAP_SUM`, `VAL_MACFLOAT` -> `GAP_ValueMacFloat`, etc. -- most of these were added specifically for use by Sage years ago but apparently are not actually used by Sage? Overall I would expect that a majority of the imports from outside `libgap-api.h` can be replaced.

I just noticed you do this, so I am guessing you will want to also use `SetPrintFormattingStatus` as mentioned above, as a better alternative to that hack

```
    argv[8] = "-x"    # set the "screen" width so that GAP is less likely to
    argv[9] = "4096"  # insert newlines when printing objects
                      # 4096 unfortunately is the hard-coded max, but should
                      # be long enough for most cases

```

You also have the following:

```
    argv[1] = "-l"
    s = str_to_bytes(gap_root(), FS_ENCODING, "surrogateescape")
    argv[2] = s

```

This shouldn't be necessary anymore in 4.12.2 (due in ~2 weeks), thanks to https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/5193
