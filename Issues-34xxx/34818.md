CC:  @tscrim @jhpalmieri

The following code

```
sage: A.<a,b,x,u> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ,degrees=(2,2,3,3))
sage: A = A.quotient(A.ideal([a*u,b*u,x*u]))
sage: A.cdg_algebra({a:u,x:a*b})
```

Produces an error

```
...

File ~/sage/src/sage/algebras/commutative_dga.py:253, in Differential.__init__(self, A, im_gens)
    251 for i in A.gens():
    252     if not self(self(i)).is_zero():
--> 253         raise ValueError("The given dictionary does not determine a valid differential")

ValueError: The given dictionary does not determine a valid differential

```

which is wrong, because the differential is valid in the quotient algebra.

It seems that the computations for the differential are done in the free algebra instead of the quotient one.
