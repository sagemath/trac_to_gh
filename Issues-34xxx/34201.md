This is work toward modularization, see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging_sage_library.html#module-level-runtime-dependencies and #29705.

Tools:
- Find them with `./sage -tox -e relint` - but the list of .all modules that it complains about differs from what actually became a namespace package in #33011; this is updated in #34189. (See also #33202 - `tox -e relint`: Do not complain about imports from `sage.categories.all`)

- #34426 `import_statements`: Accept more flexible input

- https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports with option `--replace-import` ... but it rewrites all imports in a peculiar style (one import line for each imported name)

- https://pypi.org/project/import-linter/ - this could replace our use of relint for complaining about .all imports
