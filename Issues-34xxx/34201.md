This is work toward modularization, see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging_sage_library.html#module-level-runtime-dependencies and #29705.

Tickets:
- #32534/#32591/#32620/#32734/#32733: Remove .all imports (Sage 9.5)
- #32989/#32999/#33000/#33007/#33146/#33199 Remove imports from sage.*.all (Sage 9.6)
- #34189 Remove imports from sage.all and sage.rings.all in sage.rings
- #34190 Remove imports from sage.rings.all in sage.schemes
- #34191 Remove imports from sage.rings.all in sage.modular		
- #34192 Remove imports from sage.rings.all in sage.calculus, functions, symbolic		
- #34428 sage.manifolds, sage.tensor: Remove imports from sage.arith.all, sage.rings.all
- #34197 Remove imports from sage.arith.all in the Sage library	

Tools:
- Find them with `./sage -tox -e relint` - but the list of .all modules that it complains about differs from what actually became a namespace package in #33011; this is updated in #34189. (See also #33202 - `tox -e relint`: Do not complain about imports from `sage.categories.all`)

- #34426 `import_statements`: Accept more flexible input

- https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports with option `--replace-import` ... but it rewrites all imports in a peculiar style (one import line for each imported name)

- https://pypi.org/project/import-linter/ - this could replace our use of relint for complaining about .all imports
