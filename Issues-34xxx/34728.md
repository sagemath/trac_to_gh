Currently, `EllipticCurve_generic.automorphisms()` returns the automorphisms in a more or less arbitrary (albeit deterministic) order.

It is much more natural to users to receive a list with the identity and negation first, since they exist for any curve, then any other automorphisms that may exist. (I have personally seen code making this incorrect assumption.)

In this patch, we change `._comparison_impl()` for `WeierstrassIsomorphism` in such a way that `[1]` and `[-1]` will appear first in a sorted list of automorphisms.

Thank you for the feedback!

(2) Done.

(1) The answer used to be no (I had incorrectly assumed that `u` uniquely identifies the isomorphism, which is manifestly untrue in characteristics 2 and 3), but it should be handled correctly now. This did require moving the comparison up from `baseWI` to `WeierstrassIsomorphism`, as the former knows nothing about the domain curve.

Since the new changes are not totally trivial, I'll let you have another look rather than setting it to positive review right away.

Another question: Did you check all modifications in this branch or just the ones in "diff without the dependencies"?
