This works, but how about getting rid of the use of `tmp_dir` in this file (see #33213)?

Also:

```
+    subprocess.check_call(f'gcc -o {runmefile} ' + os.path.join(tempdir, '*.c ') +
```
Because this command is processed by the shell, `runmefile` should be run through `shlex.quote`

```
+                          os.path.join('$SAGE_LOCAL', 'lib', 'libTIDES.a') + ' $LDFLAGS ' +
+                          os.path.join('-L$SAGE_LOCAL', 'lib ') + '-lmpfr -lgmp -lm  -O2 -w ' +
+                          os.path.join('-I$SAGE_LOCAL', 'include '),
+                          shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
+    subprocess.check_call(tempdir / 'runme', shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
```
`tempdir / 'runme'` can be replaced by `runmefile`
