`FreeModule` (from `sage.modules`) has a method `is_ambient` for distinguishing ambient modules from submodules. 

We make this method available for `CombinatorialFreeModule` too via `ModulesWithBasis`.

Add a method `items`, with the same semantics as for sparse vectors from `sage.modules`, and matrices and tensor components after #29619. If `self` is a submodule, they refer to the ambient module (see #34455).
Likewise `nonzero_positions`, which gives the indices only.

For ambient modules, `dict`, `items`, and `monomial_coefficients` give the same result, and `support` and `nonzero_positions` are the same. We enforce this with a `_test_...` method.
