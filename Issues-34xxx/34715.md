Similar to #32838 but this time thanks to `docker.yml` we need two one-liners only

Branch for this ticket can be formed from ​[single commit in fork](https://github.com/sheerluck/sage/commit/e2d38e282ff701f3c79970eca7c54b5613d49526).

To test this ticket one needs #33842 and also to **bump LT_VERSION to 3.12.0**

and it seems like sagemath is not ready for that yet :(

Depends on #33842
