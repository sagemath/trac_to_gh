The following code shows an arithmetic bug in `InfinityRing` and broken commutativity:

```
R = InfinityRing
print( R(1) + R(0) )
print( R(0) + R(1) )
```

While `R(1) + R(0)` evaluates to `A positive finite number` (which is correct!), switching the arguments into `R(0) + R(1)` changes the evaluation to `Zero`, which is wrong.

This file predates the `TestSuite`, so it is not surprising it is not in there. I am also a bit worried that because addition is only a partially defined operation and it has multiple element classes, the `TestSuite` run would not be guaranteed to work for most of the tests.

There are probably ways on improving this, but at least for now, this fixes a clear bug and tests against it. So positive review.
