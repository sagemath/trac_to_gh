When we don't install the SPKG, then its exact version is not relevant.

We change the output from

```
gc-8.0.4:     no suitable system package; standard, will be installed as an SPKG
gcc-11.3.0:   using system package; SPKG will not be installed
```
to

```
gc:     no suitable system package; standard, SPKG version 8.0.4 will be installed
gcc:    using system package; SPKG will not be installed
```

<a id='comment:3'></a>Looks good to me. A few questions:

- The number 32 is hard-coded in the formatting string. How much work would it be to determine that from the list of all packages? (This is not really worth spending time on, though.)

- With or without this branch: `pip` packages are treated differently than others if I run this after building Sage:

```
charset_normalizer:             standard, SPKG version 2.0.4 will be installed
cliquer:                        already installed as an SPKG
```
 (At least I'm guessing it's `pip` vs. other types.) Should the `cliquer` message say "already installed version $SPKG_VERSION as an SPKG"? Should they both say that?

This version of the message is actually for packages with an `spkg-configure.m4` that are installed already (and hence the test for a system package is not run at all).

I've made a change in this direction, but I guess it could be done more generally

This is not new to this ticket, and not particularly relevant to the changes here, but I don't quite see how `uninstall_message` works. When will it be set to "use \"$srcdir/configure --disable-SPKG_NAME\" to uninstall" — it seems as though this would be most useful for optional/experimental packages.
