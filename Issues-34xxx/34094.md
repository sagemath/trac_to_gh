Currently, the following call returns an error:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(RR, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem_projective([x^2 - y^2, y^2])
sage: f.periodic_points(3, minimal=False)
```

However, the error is entirely artificial. That is, the code in the method works, but an error is thrown if the base ring is not a number field or a finite field. The intent of such an error is to fail "nicely" in order to show the user a nice error message. The cost, however, is that many unnecessary errors are thrown.

We remove such checks from `periodic_points` and `preperoidic_points`, as the cost in functionality far outweighs the benefits of a "nice" error message.
