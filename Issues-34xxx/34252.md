```
Specifically `html/en/index.html` page is now based on furo's `page.html` for furo theme.

Along the way, we fix here and there so that

- pdf docs also build
- logo links to the documentation root
- search page works
- white sage logo is transparent

Hence our doc in furo theme is now quite functional.
