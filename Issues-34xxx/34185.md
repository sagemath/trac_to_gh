As suggested in #33823 (see [comment 25](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33823#comment:25)) I make a first attempt for such an option here. The purpose of the option is to find test which need to be marked as `optional` but aren't right now.

For example see the test of the following file which contains two tests involving the optional package `database_knotinfo`. Note that on the system where I produced the output below this feature is available.

```bash
cat test_knotinfo.py
r"""
sage: KnotInfo.K9_10.homfly_polynomial()
-v^10*z^2 + v^8*z^4 - 2*v^10 + 2*v^8*z^2 + 2*v^6*z^4 + v^8 + 5*v^6*z^2 + v^4*z^4 + 2*v^6 + 2*v^4*z^2
sage: KnotInfo.K9_10.alexander_polynomial()  # optional database_knotinfo
4*t^4 - 8*t^3 + 9*t^2 - 8*t + 4
"""
```

The first test is missing the `optional` tag. Thus, this would fail on a system without that feature. But, running `sage -t` without the new option does not show the problem:


```bash
sage -t test_knotinfo.py

Will be in the next commit.

I'm wondering what's wrong with the patchbots? For example:

```
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/git/patchbot/sage-9.7.beta5/src/sage/features/__init__.py", line 301, in sage.features.Feature.is_optional
Failed example:
    DatabaseCremona().is_optional()
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AttributeError: 'DatabaseCremona' object has no attribute 'is_optional'
```

All tests failing on the patchbots succeed in the Gitpod environment. But here there is a failing test, as well, but obviously unrelated to the branch. It is caused by:

```
sage: from sage.features.latex import LaTeXPackage
sage: LaTeXPackage("tkz-graph").is_present()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'kpsewhich'
```

This happens since `kpsewhich` is not installed on the environment. Shouldn't `LaTeXPackage` be a *joined feature* with `pdflatex`?

See #34282 for a suggestion to have this fixed.

Furthermore, when testing on a system with meataxe you may randomly run into a circular import issue in `matrix_space`. This is fixed in ticket #34283.
