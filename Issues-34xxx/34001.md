This ticket adds the flag `polcast` to class `OrePolynomialRing`. It defaults to `True`.

When there is no twisting derivation and twisting morphism (or that the twisting morphism is the identity), the constructor creates a regular `PolynomialRing` if `polcast` is `True` or a real `OrePolynomialRing` if `polcast` is False.
