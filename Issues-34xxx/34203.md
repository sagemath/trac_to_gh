When system packages are upgraded, shared libraries that a Sage installation links to can disappear, rendering the Sage installation broken. This is a common problem, reported for example in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/Iz8ZsmQM3Pg/m/CPl9CbHmBgAJ

To avoid a full rebuild (`make distclean && make build`), we can try to find the specific broken packages.

The new command `make -j list-broken-packages` assists the user with this:

```
$ make -j list-broken-packages
make --no-print-directory auditwheel_or_delocate-no-deps
sage-logger -p 'sage --pip install -r "/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/build/pkgs/auditwheel_or_delocate/requirements.txt"' '/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/logs/pkgs/auditwheel_or_delocate.log'

The core functionality is implemented by the new command `sage-spkg-installcheck` (implemented in sage_bootstrap):

```

Checking shared library file '/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/local/lib/libeantic.0.dylib'

Error during installcheck of 'e_antic': Could not find all dependencies.
```

It inspects the installation records in `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed/` and all shared libraries and platform wheels listed there. 



On macOS, instead of using `otool` directly, we use `delocate-listdeps` from https://pypi.org/project/delocate/

On Linux, instead of using `ldd` directly, we use `auditwheel.lddtree.lddtree` (https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/blob/main/src/auditwheel/lddtree.py)

(Both packages are also used by cibuildwheel)

Is `patchelf` really required, or is it only necessary if one is trying to fix files, not just detect whether they're broken?
