When we try to transform a **nonpolynomial** symbolic expression to **LazyTaylorSeries**, it reports a **TypeError**. Below is an example:

```
LR.<x> = LazyTaylorSeriesRing(QQ)
(exp(x) - 1)/x
```
`1 + 1/2*x + 1/6*x^2 + 1/24*x^3 + 1/120*x^4 + 1/720*x^5 + O(x^6)`

```
y = SR('x')
LR((exp(y) - 1)/y)
```

Is there any fix to make LR(expression) work as expression to create a LazyTaylorSeries? 

Thank you very much!
