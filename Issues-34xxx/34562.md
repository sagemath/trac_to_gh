This ticket mainly aims to separate the auxiliary F-algebra in another file.

This file implements a better custom-made F-algebra, with additional useful methods.

Some quick comments about the `F_algebra`:

- The element's `coefficients` should return the nonzero coefficients, but the current implementation has different behavior.
- There should be a `from_vector` method on the parent. This is useful for the linear algebra methods.
- The `NN` can be a little funky when it comes to lazy imports not resolving correctly (#16522). It would be better to use `NonNegativeIntegers()` unless you specifically are looking for the algebraic aspects.
- Is there a reason why you are nailing `Indices` in the module level memory? It seems like the `str_to_index` is better as a method of the `F_algebra` and then you could access it by `self._indices` there (or `self.parent()._indices`).
- Instead of the recursive `basis_f_odd_iterator`, is it faster to use the iterators from `WeightedIntegerVectors` and `Permutations_mset` (which operate on lists)? It is a slightly more involved implementation, but I don't know how important speed is here.
- For the `product_on_basis`, it might be faster to do `self.sum()` since it works with the elements directly and has less transient elements.

Hello,

thanks a lot for the suggestions !

> - The element's `coefficients` should return the nonzero coefficients, but the current implementation has different behavior.


ok, done by removing the wrong alias that I had added.

> - There should be a `from_vector` method on the parent. This is useful for the linear algebra methods.


well, the difficulty is that it only makes sense for homogeneous elements, and the usual "from_vector" methods does not take the degree as input

> - The `NN` can be a little funky when it comes to lazy imports not resolving correctly (#16522). It would be better to use `NonNegativeIntegers()` unless you specifically are looking for the algebraic aspects.


I substituted that for NN and it works fine.

> - Is there a reason why you are nailing `Indices` in the module level memory? It seems like the `str_to_index` is better as a method of the `F_algebra` and then you could access it by `self._indices` there (or `self.parent()._indices`).


I would rather keep "str_to_index" as an independant auxiliary function. Why is it problematic to have Indices at the module level ? oh, I guess it will have to be initiated when the module is loaded..

> - Instead of the recursive `basis_f_odd_iterator`, is it faster to use the iterators from `WeightedIntegerVectors` and `Permutations_mset` (which operate on lists)? It is a slightly more involved implementation, but I don't know how important speed is here.


Not sure how to achieve "words of any length in odd integers at least 3 with sum n" using the existing tools. And speed generally matters in this file, indeed.

> - For the `product_on_basis`, it might be faster to do `self.sum()` since it works with the elements directly and has less transient elements.


I have not yet checked that last suggestion.

Thank you for all your work on Sage.

I see. This breaks the `CFM.from_vector(v.to_vector()) == v` loop though (although that is more for finite dimensional modules). Perhaps we could rename this here to `homogeneous_to_vector()` to make it more future-proof (if we implement a generic infinite dimensional version someday)?

Subsequently it effectively gets nailed in memory. It's fairly lightweight (and only one of them), so its not a problem, but it still is something that gets carried around.

Also, you shouldn't need to set `self._indices = Indices`; that should be done by the `CFM.__init__()`.

If speed matters, then perhaps we should just Cythonize the file. It would allow you to replace the `self.parent()` with `self._parent`, which is faster.

Perhaps iterating over the indices is not such an important operation for speed. Although it might be best to use lightweight classes (e.g., `tuple`) and implement shuffling without using the heavy `ShuffleProduct_w1w2` parent class. This becomes something like

```python
    def shuffle(t1, t2):
        n1 = len(t1)
        n2 = len(t2)
        for iv in IntegerVectors(n1, n1 + n2, max_part=1): # can probably even make this iterator smarter
            it1 = iter(t1)
            it2 = iter(t2)
            yield tuple([next(it1) if v else next(it2) for v in iv])
```

> > - For the `product_on_basis`, it might be faster to do `self.sum()` since it works with the elements directly and has less transient elements.
 
> 
> I have not yet checked that last suggestion.


Your changes look like they should be faster. Even more so if we can make the indices involve less transient objects and/or checks.

Thank you.

Do we want to use `IntegerRange` rather than the more specific `NonNegativeIntegers()`? This would also make it different than `F_algebra` (not that they need to be the same).

I think other than that, I would be happy to set a positive review (unless there are other changes you want to make).
