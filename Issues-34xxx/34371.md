Currently, `Polynomial_zmod_flint` refuses to factor polynomials modulo composites, which is generally not well-defined. However, we can easily make this work modulo prime powers (where it *is* well-defined) by reusing the implementation for polynomials over p‑adics. This is almost certainly not the fastest way of doing it, but at least it *works*.

The implementation for `ℤₚ[x]` relies on PARI, whereas the implementation of `(ℤ/n)[x]` is based on FLINT. I suppose we could inline the PARI conversion and call PARI without explicitly changing to `ℤₚ`, but that's already much more effort than this and I'm not sure how much it would actually help (it saves some Python overhead, but the conversion is still needed).

Personally I'd argue that this is an easy way to make something work that didn't work previously, and we can improve the performance later if it turns out to be a problem.

It also means you get an additional transient object that takes up time and memory, which could matter if the polynomial is "big". However...

I agree fully. Only to be done if it was clearly easy.
