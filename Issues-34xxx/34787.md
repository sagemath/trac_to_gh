Elliptic curves and points have `.set_order()` methods to supply the order to Sage's algorithms instead of computing it.

However, `.set_order()` for curves currently has a `num_checks=` keyword argument instead of the usual `check=` flag, and `.set_order()` for points does not have either argument and simply runs checks unconditionally.

In this patch we add `check=` arguments to both methods. Moreover, we make `.set_order()` work for points over general fields, where order-computation algorithms are not available at the moment.

It marks all following arguments as keyword-only. I think enforcing that `check=` be passed as a keyword argument is a good idea: It makes a function call with a `check` argument much easier to understand than a boolean positional argument.

Good catch, fixed.
