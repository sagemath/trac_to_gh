The class `ProductTree` and the function `prod_with_derivative()` were introduced in #34303. Both are fully generic in principle, but they remained in `hom_velusqrt.py` in the heat of the moment.

We should move them to a more suitable place; it seems `sage.rings.generic` is an appropriate choice. Slight tweaks to `ProductTree` while we're at it.

+1. In the `ProductTree` class docstring, there is no description about a product tree. It may be described in terms of leaves, layers, and the root in a couple of sentences.

The `ALGORITHM` section of `prod_with_derivative` just describes the source code. Thus it is too much detailed but useless for a user. I suggest to remove it.

The paragraph `The main reason for this function ...` may be moved up and replace the aforementioned `ALGORITHM` section.

But in Python "a list" is much more specific than "a sequence"! For example, a tuple is a sequence but not a list. Indeed, the Python documentation does have a concept of "sequence": https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range

> The paragraph `The main reason for this function ...` may be moved up and replace the aforementioned `ALGORITHM` section.


Are you suggesting to move it outside of the`EXAMPLES` block? Or just swap the two examples?

Strictly speaking, you are right. But it is usual to say "a tuple of" or "a list of" when an input of any sequence type is allowed. I think it is rather unusual to say "a sequence of" for an input of a sequence type (it makes one to think twice).

Again this is not a rule, but a suggestion of a style for uniformity.

To move it to the place of `ALGORITHM` (perhaps removing `alpha`). If you do not, please write a new paragraph to explain the purpose (or usage) of the function at the place of the removed `ALGORITHM`.

Thanks. LGTM, though I am not completely happy with the overuse of `iterable` where common and simple `list` is enough. It's hard to make everyone happy :)

One last thing. Please insert spaces around `//` in

```diff
+            X = [X[i//2] % V[i] for i in range(len(V))]
```

You can set positive review for me. Thanks!
