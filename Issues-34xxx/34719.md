The Carmichael λ function currently resides in the `sage.crypto.util` module, but it's really much more general than "just" crypto: λ(n) is the exponent of the unit group of ℤ/n. (The morally comparable Euler φ function does live in `sage.arith.misc` already.)

This patch lifts `carmichael_lambda()` out of obscurity, plus some tiny tweaks.
