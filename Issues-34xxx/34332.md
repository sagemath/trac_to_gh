I'm trying to compile Sage 9.6 from the tarball on Ubuntu 20.04. I have installed all the recommend packages from APT (although `./configure` complains about some of them not being installed; I've tried the recommended `sudo apt-get install` command but it didn't help).

Running `./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local --with-python=$HOME/.local/bin/python`  works fine, but then when running `make`, I get an error. It says `setuptools-59.8.0` failed to build, and gives me the following log:

```
cat: /build/pkgs/setuptools/type: No such file or directory
Error: Installing old-style SPKGs is no longer supported
```

I have no idea what the issue might be, but my relevant environment variables are as follows: `SAGE_ROOT=$HOME/.local/src/sage-9.6 MAKE="make -j4" SAGE_CHECK="yes" SAGE_DEBUG="no"`. I'm looking for advice rather than a patch.
