Keywords: HillCryptosystem

Hill encryption can be quickly cracked by known plaintext attacks.
 MK = C --> K = M<sup>-1</sup> C.

However, this kind of algorithm is missing in sage.crypto.classic.hillcryptosystem, although other classical algorithms are accompanied by cracking methods.

It would be good to add such a method, but it is not just inverting a matrix. The Hill Cryptosystem is a private-key method, so the encryption matrix `M` would not be an input to this method. The input might be a plaintext message and the corresponding ciphertext, where the plaintext is long enough for the inverse to be calculated by linear algebra.
