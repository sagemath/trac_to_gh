If `E` is an elliptic curve over `QQ`, and `D` is a fundamental negative discriminant, then `E.heegner_point(D)` should return a point on `E(L)` defined over the Hilbert Class Field `L` of `K=QQ(\sqrt(D))`.   In particular, if `D=-7` then `L=K` and the point should be defined over `K`.  But:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: D = -7
sage: P = E.heegner_point(D)
sage: PE = P.point_exact()
sage: [c.parent() for c in PE.xy()]
[Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + x + 20,
 Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + x + 20]
sage: [c.parent().disc() for c in PE.xy()]
[-79, -79]
```
So in this case the point returned is in the wrong quadratic field.

The problem is that after correctly computing the floating point coordinates:

```
sage: P.numerical_approx()
(0.500000000000000 - 1.32287565553229*I : -2.00000000000000 - 5.29150262212918*I : 1.00000000000000)
```
the code attempts to find the minimal polynomial of the `x`-coordinate, and in this case computes the polynomial to be `x`, with root `0`, and the points with `x=0` on this curve lie in `QQ(\sqrt(-79))`.

In the code (in heegner.py) polynomials are first ought with degree `n`, then `2n`, where `n`  is the class number of `D` (which is `1` in this example).  There is a comment in the code asking whether it is a good idea to try for degree `n` as well as `2n`; this is an example where it is a bad idea.

I propose to change this to only try degree `2n`.  That should fix this example.  I may also try to add a test that the pint returned has both coordinates in the right field.
