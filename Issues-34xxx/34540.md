`CategoryObject` introduces itself as "an object in some category", but this is highly ambiguous.

In this ticket, we update the documentation along the following lines:
- keep a clear distinction between a Python object and a mathematical object
- acknowledge that "the same" mathematical object can be represented by several Python objects simultaneously
- acknowledge that "the" category of a mathematical object is not a meaningful mathematical concept; if one refers to it, it means that one is implicitly talking about a pair (object, category)
- reference the is-a/has-a distinction in object oriented programming
- finally explain that an instance of (a subclass of) `CategoryObject` 
  - is a Python object 
  - that *has* a distinguished/default category as its attribute `_category` (returned by the method `category()`)
  - that mixes in attributes/methods from that category's `ParentMethods`.
- conclude that "the same" mathematical object can be represented by several instances of (subclasses of) `CategoryObject` for the purpose of "considering it as an object of" the category.
