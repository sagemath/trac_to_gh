`nauty-genbg` has inherent limitation for the ranges of partite set sizes, and produces an error if they are out of these ranges - like:

```
$ nauty-genbg 5 28
>E genbg: must have n1=1..24, n1+n2=1..32
```
I believe this is a major but poorly documented limitation. It'd be nice if the recently added interface (ticket #33365) take a special care of it and communicated such an error (if it appears) clearly to the user. 

I'm not sure if the interface should really check any ranges itself as the allowed range may potentially change in future versions of `nauty-genbg`.
