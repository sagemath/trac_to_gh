What I think would be a good way to go in this ticket would be to follow the [one year deprecation policy](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html#deprecation) of Sage. Therefore, the default value of the parameter `plus` would be `False` so that `Bernoulli(1)` still returns `-1/2`, but this option would return a warning message saying that this default value will change to `True` in a subsequent release of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath). This will give time to the user to adapt their code accordingly.

Also, if `plus=False` I would make the code return `Bernoulli(1)=-1/2` (instead of letting the algorithm decides). In my opinion, this would give the user the choice of its prefered value and avoid some possible confusions.

Here's a list of all the files with failed doctests:

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>\nHow can you say `B_1 = -1/2` is standard when Knuth uses `B_1 = +1/2`?\n\nHow can you say `B_1 = -1/2` is even a \"convention\" when Luschny has analysed the historical development of the Bernoulli numbers and found that Bernoulli himself and virtually all mathematicians before the 20th century used `B_1 = +1/2`?\n\nHave you read the manifesto? Luschny's argument has two main thrusts: the historical side as above, and the simplification of many formulae with `B_1 = +1/2`, including Euler\u2013Maclaurin.

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
How can you say `B_1 = -1/2` is standard when Knuth uses `B_1 = +1/2`?

How can you say `B_1 = -1/2` is even a "convention" when Luschny has analysed the historical development of the Bernoulli numbers and found that Bernoulli himself and virtually all mathematicians before the 20th century used `B_1 = +1/2`?

Have you read the manifesto? Luschny's argument has two main thrusts: the historical side as above, and the simplification of many formulae with `B_1 = +1/2`, including Euler–Maclaurin. He eventually finds that the Hasse–Worpitzky representation of the generalised Bernoulli function frees the numbers from all conventions – `B_1 = +1/2` is not another convention, it is the only logical value.

Frederic, really? Knuth (does this name rings a bell :-)), mentioned in the ticket description, has published maths articles, and books, and if he uses +1/2 then this should have a merit.

And there was a tentative agreement on sage-devel that this change can go forward.

I don't think so. Most people said if to be done, would need to be done with 1 year deprecation warning.

Hello Jeremy, thank you for working on this ticket and fixing the failing doctests.

A small suggestion:

```diff
+    - ``plus`` (Boolean) - ``bernoulli(1)`` gives `1/2` if this is ``True`` and `-1/2` otherwise
-    - ``plus`` - bernoulli(1) gives +1/2 if this is True and -1/2 otherwise
```
Also, I think that a more descriptive depreciation message could be useful for the user:

```diff
         else:
+            deprecation(34521, ("bernoulli(1) will return +1/2 by default in" +
+            "the future. In order to keep the original behavior, please set" +
+            "the option ``plus`` to ``False`` (bernoulli(n, plus=False))"))
-            deprecation(34521, "bernoulli(1) will always return +1/2 in the future")
```
(or something else)

I still support this change and I don't understand the convention argument against it.
