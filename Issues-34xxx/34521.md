<a id='comment:8'></a>How can you say `B_1 = -1/2` is standard when Knuth uses `B_1 = +1/2`?

How can you say `B_1 = -1/2` is even a "convention" when Luschny has analysed the historical development of the Bernoulli numbers and found that Bernoulli himself and virtually all mathematicians before the 20th century used `B_1 = +1/2`?

Have you read the manifesto? Luschny's argument has two main thrusts: the historical side as above, and the simplification of many formulae with `B_1 = +1/2`, including Euler–Maclaurin. He eventually finds that the Hasse–Worpitzky representation of the generalised Bernoulli function frees the numbers from all conventions – `B_1 = +1/2` is not another convention, it is the only logical value.

Frederic, really? Knuth (does this name rings a bell :-)), mentioned in the ticket description, has published maths articles, and books, and if he uses +1/2 then this should have a merit.

I don't think so. Most people said if to be done, would need to be done with 1 year deprecation warning.
Apart from the OP, I don't think anyone is excited about this change. Including me.

Why do you think the PR will be merged?

<a id='comment:22'></a>Hello Jeremy, thank you for working on this ticket and fixing the failing doctests.

A small suggestion:

```diff
+    - ``plus`` (Boolean) - ``bernoulli(1)`` gives `1/2` if this is ``True`` and `-1/2` otherwise
-    - ``plus`` - bernoulli(1) gives +1/2 if this is True and -1/2 otherwise
```
Also, I think that a more descriptive depreciation message could be useful for the user:

```diff
         else:
+            deprecation(34521, ("bernoulli(1) will return +1/2 by default in" +
+            "the future. In order to keep the original behavior, please set" +
+            "the option ``plus`` to ``False`` (bernoulli(n, plus=False))"))
-            deprecation(34521, "bernoulli(1) will always return +1/2 in the future")
```
(or something else)

I still support this change and I don't understand the convention argument against it.
