```
Numpy's distutils-based build system needs setuptools < 64. We upgrade to the latest suitable version, 63.4.3, which will be used in non-PEP-517 builds. https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/history.html#v63-4-3

For PEP 517 builds, we provide the latest setuptools (65.x) as a wheel, which will be used in the isolated build environments of PEP 517 packages. https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/history.html#v65-3-0

The update to 65.3 brings PEP 660 editable installs.
Here on this ticket, we disable them. The follow-up ticket #34209 will switch editable builds to this new technology.

We also update a few more build system related packages.
- tomlkit: Update to 0.11.4
- importlib_resources: Update to 5.9.0
- importlib_metadata: Update to 4.12.0
- distlib: Update to 0.3.6
- hatchling: Update to 1.10.0
- pathspec: Update to 0.10.1

<a id='comment:24'></a>Since #33789, we use build isolation for all Python packages that use `sdh_pip_install` - except for those that we invoke with `--no-use-pep517` or `--no-build-isolation`.
When build isolation is in use, it does not matter what is installed in `site-packages`, as it creates a fresh build environment using the wheels in `venv/var/lib/sage/wheels/`; this includes the setuptools wheel, which is provided by our `setuptools_wheel` SPKG.
The versions don't need to be synchronized - a setuptools-based package uses exactly one of the two.
