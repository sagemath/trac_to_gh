Keywords: stanley symmetric-function weyl-group gsoc2022

The Stanley symmetric function was implemented in several types in #8810. 

A theorem of Reiner-Shimozono (1995) allows us to compute these more efficiently in type-A. 

This ticket implements that algorithm.

One doctest fails, giving an incorrect result for the `SymmetricGroupElement` example. In further investigating, I see that:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4)

sage: W = WeylGroup(['A', 3]);
sage: w = W.from_reduced_word([3,2,3,1])
sage: g
(1,2,4)
sage: w
[0 1 0 0]
[0 0 0 1]
[0 0 1 0]
[1 0 0 0]
sage: g.domain()
[2, 4, 3, 1]
sage: w.to_permutation()

Indeed:

```
sage: SymmetricGroup(4).from_reduced_word([1,3,2,3]).domain()
[4, 1, 3, 2]
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A', 3])
sage: W.from_reduced_word([3,2,3,1]).to_permutation()

Should the `WeylGroups.ElementMethods.stanley_symmetric_function` and `*_as_polynomial` methods be moved to the category of `CoxeterGroups`? My read of [SymmetricFunctions.com](https://www.symmetricfunctions.com/stanleySymmetric.htm#stanleySymBC) is "yes" but that involves more. Would it be OK to leave Coxeter groups off of this ticket and make it a follow up one?

If there is a difference between types B and C, then they cannot move up to Coxeter groups. I am not sure without reading more closely.
