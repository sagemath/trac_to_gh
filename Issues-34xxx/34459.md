Under macOS 12.5.1 on an M1 Mac, I've installed from SageMath-9.6-1.4.2_arm64.dmg. When I run the sage command in Terminal (or in effect do the same thing by launching SageMath-9-6.app and selecting the option for command line), I get error:

dyld[16273]: Library not loaded: '/opt/local/lib/libncurses.6.dylib'
  Referenced from: '/usr/local/bin/bash'
  Reason: tried: '/opt/local/lib/libncurses.6.dylib' (mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have (arm64), need (x86_64))), '/usr/local/lib/libncurses.6.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/lib/libncurses.6.dylib' (no such file)
/usr/local/bin/sage: line 20: 16273 Abort trap: 6           /usr/bin/env - PATH="$PATH" $MIN_ENV "$SYMLINK"/venv/bin/sage "$@"

The libncurses.6.dylib referenced was installed with the MacPorts and is allegedly "universal".

What is in `/usr/local` on this machine and where does it come from?

In `/usr/local` there is no `libncurses.*`

(In `/usr/local/lib/fpc` -- from Free Pascal Compiler -- there are a couple dozen `ncurses` modules, but no `libncurses.*`.)

I presume that, because of my `PATH` settings, sage searches `/opt/local/lib`, `/usr/local/lib`, and `/usr/lib` for libncurses.

The message above complains about `/usr/local/bin/bash`. I recommend to move this (or actually the whole /usr/local) away.
