That's correct.

> Also you have empty `INPUT:` blocks. Either remove, add the inputs, or provide a link to something that explains how to parse the inputs.


Done.

Besides, I now know of a way to make sense of

```
sage: L.<x,y> = LazySymmetricFunction(SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s())
sage: f = 1/(1-x*y)
```

The natural thing is to set `x = tensor([s[1], s[0]])` and `y = tensor([s[0], s[1]])`.  Doing so, also

```
sage: f.derivative(x, 2, y)
```
makes sense.  In fact, this is what we do all the time in the doctests anyway.

I agree that it makes a little bit of sense to think of the variable as a the unique degree one element (up to scalar). However, this would be a hack IMO because the degree one elements do not generate the ring of symmetric functions (as it is a freely generated by e<sub>i</sub>). So the result of `gens()` would be wrong if it was the degree one elements. Now a way to explain yourself out of this is that the `R.<x,y>` type syntax returns the first (in some ordering) `n` generators.

I still do not think this extra little agreement with a completely different class (where I expect no such compatibility) and implementation is worth all of this extra complexity and effort. Although I won’t oppose it because you are not going to create some extra class for the variables (at least, judging by what you’re saying). However, to me it adds to maintenance costs without a clear benefit.

Actually, isn’t what is happening just a renaming of “skew_by“? Will that be implemented here too?

<a id='comment:14'></a>you never sleep, do you?

Yes, this is `skey_by(p[1])`.

Indeed, it is a bit unclear to me whether it makes sense to implement all the methods on `SymmetricFunctions` also on `LazySymmetricFunctions`.  It would be nicer to have an automatism for those which are graded maps.

However, that's almost certainly for a different project.

I wanted to convey my thoughts while you were still awake in case you wanted to respond.

It seems like that is your mathematical model is disguise. It just happens to have all of the other usual derivative properties when doing `p[1]`.

I think we can port them over as we find them to be useful.

Anyways, for follow-up tickets.

Can you add the following tests:

(For exact series with nonzero constant)

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: f = L([1,2], valuation=-2, constant=1)
sage: f
z^-2 + 2*z^-1 + 1 + z + z^2 + O(z^3)
sage: f.derivative()
-2*z^-3 - 2*z^-2 + 1 + 2*z + 3*z^2 + 4*z^3 + O(z^4)
```

Calculus rules (up to an implicit sign choice):

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: log(1-z).derivative()
-1 - z - z^2 - z^3 - z^4 - z^5 - z^6 + O(z^7)
```
Side note: This doesn't work over `ZZ` because we are too greedy about converting things to the ring. Indeed, the failure for `ZZ` stems from

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: log(1-z)
<repr(<sage.rings.lazy_series_ring.LazyLaurentSeriesRing_with_category.element_class at 0x7f2c90572c80>) failed: TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer>
```
This is the only stream that is forcing the output to be in a particular ring and an explicit example about why we shouldn't do that in `Stream`s. We should change this on a separate ticket (or here if you want).
