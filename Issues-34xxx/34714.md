Trivial instances of univariate polynomial factorization over complicated number fields are extremely slow because Sage starts by trying to compute an integral basis.

We introduce a fast path that handles monomials — most importantly, the identity polynomial.

Ideally, we should do something similar over arbitrary rings, but this is currently difficult to implement in a generic because the `factor()` method of constants is under-specified. In particular, calling `factor()` on a rational number factors the numerator and denominator, which we certainly do not want when factoring the leading coefficient of an element of ℚ[x].

In the number field case, a possible generalization would be to detect constant multiples of polynomials that factor over ℚ. Not sure if this is a good idea.
