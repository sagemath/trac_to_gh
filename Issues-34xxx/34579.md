Right now, we iterate through all planar set partitions in `algebras.PlanarPartition` by filtering out the non-planar diagrams. However, this is very inefficient for large values of `n`. We implement a recursive algorithm that works by simply taking the part `{a, b, c, ...}` that contains the largest element and uses the fact that we can form the planar partition by combining the planar set partitions on the remaining sets `{1, ..., a-1}`, `{a+1, ..., b-1}`, `...`, which are all independent.

```
versus old

```
sage: %timeit list(planar_diagrams(1))
6.36 µs ± 38.8 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit list(planar_diagrams(2))
55.4 µs ± 333 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit list(planar_diagrams(3))
1.12 ms ± 6.76 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit list(planar_diagrams(4))
28.1 ms ± 169 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
sage: %timeit list(planar_diagrams(5))
872 ms ± 5.12 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```
So we already see a 10x speedup on `n=5` (which means planar set partitions on `2n = 10` elements).

The downsides are that it no longer iterates through the set partitions in order of the number of parts and it is limited by the Python recursion depth.

A similar change could be done with the Temperley-Lieb diagrams by using the `DyckWords` iterator an `to_noncrossing_set_partition()` method, and I expect to lead to a speedup as well.

Just some not-well-cooked ideas:

- would it make sense to use `nauty` for this, if it can provide ?

- you are right about memory. Even if there is only one cached set for each integer n, the size of this set is growing like `~4^n`.

- it seems to me that iterating through Dyck paths and using `to_noncrossing_partition` is not as fast as what you propose here

But a positive review in the current state in also possible, as it is an improvement, of course.

I am not sure what aspects you want to use. If it is enumerating planar graphs, this is done by `plantri` for connected graphs, which are all the same set partition. So I don't see how to get all set partitions from this.

> - it seems to me that iterating through Dyck paths and using `to_noncrossing_partition` is not as fast as what you propose here

The `to_noncrossing_partition()` can be made a lot better. Even at its current form, it to be much slower than filtering out all Brauer diagrams by checking planarity for any `n > 7`:

```
sage: TL = algebras.TemperleyLieb(7, QQ.one())
sage: %time L = [d for d in TL.basis().keys()]
CPU times: user 572 ms, sys: 41 µs, total: 572 ms
Wall time: 571 ms
sage: len(L)
429
sage: %time L = [d.to_noncrossing_partition() for d in DyckWords(7)]
CPU times: user 10.7 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 10.7 ms
Wall time: 10.6 ms
sage: DyckWords(7).cardinality()
429

sage: TL = algebras.TemperleyLieb(8, QQ.one())
sage: %time L = [d for d in TL.basis().keys()]
CPU times: user 8.33 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 8.33 s
Wall time: 8.33 s
sage: len(L)
1430
sage: %time L = [d.to_noncrossing_partition() for d in DyckWords(8)]
CPU times: user 29.3 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 29.3 ms
Wall time: 29.1 ms
sage: DyckWords(8).cardinality()
1430
```

Some small tweaks would be made (separating out the core part of the algorithm into Cython to have it return tuples of tuples), which would likely make the speed disparity even greater.
