Sage development will soon move from Trac to Github! This was decided in a [vote on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/7h5JoRgHpxY) that closed on Oct 5, 2022. The migration work is coordinated in #30363.

The migration will convert all Trac tickets, including all comments, to GitHub Issues. 

We intend to attribute all comments of a Trac user to a corresponding GitHub account; but comments by Trac users for whom we do not have will be represented by a placeholder account.

You are cc'd here because we do not have your GitHub account on file. If you do not have one yet, now is a great time to open one.

Let us know:
- **preferably** by updating your contributor information at https://github.com/sagemath/website/blob/master/conf/contributors.xml; this information is presented in https://www.sagemath.org/development-map.html
- or by posting a comment here (but then you will receive emails when others post comments here too...)

## DO NOT SUBMIT CHANGES HERE

An e-mail is send out to all sage developers for each change! 

This results in roughly 350 x 350 unnecessary e-mails! 

There must be a better way to do this!
