I would say the bug described in the ticket is really a fault of `Set` and not of the `GeneratorIndexingSet` (which clearly knows it is infinite through `cardinality()`).

Hence, I think this ticket as-is needs more justification than what has been given.

That being said, would be good here to avoid code duplication with `cartesian_product` as I described in comment:3.

That is the by-product of saying that `GeneratorIndexingSet` must be a `Parent` subclass. What about any other (infinite) set that is not a `Parent`?

I don't think implementing a `__len__` does not mean it claims to support that ABC. Even if we allow that, I really do not see anywhere on that document (you have referenced multiple times in multiple places) what specifications are on the behaviors of such objects. It only states that by being a subclass of these ABCs, it is guaranteed that these methods are implemented.

I think you are misunderstanding the nature of the Python documentation. This is not a formal specification such as the ISO C specification, which marks various things as Undefined Behavior etc. or uses words such as MUST, SHALL, MUST NOT. So it's just misguided to try to apply language-lawyer techniques to the documentation.

The point of the `collections.abc` is to be useful -- to enable people to reliably define containers that behave just like the predefined container classes and for consumers of instances of these classes to be able to detect what protocol they can expect to work. So yes, one IS allowed to rely on such behavior.

No, you are getting this wrong too. `isinstance` is guaranteed to say `yes` when a class supports the protocol. That's what these ABCs are for.

The document explains clearly the various mechanisms that lead to isinstance saying yes. 
I have already quoted for you:

  3) Some simple interfaces are directly recognizable by the presence of the required methods (unless those methods have been set to None)

But here's also:

  Complex interfaces do not support this last technique because an interface is more than just the presence of method names. Interfaces specify semantics and relationships between methods that cannot be inferred solely from the presence of specific method names. For example, knowing that a class supplies `__getitem__`, `__len__`, and `__iter__` is insufficient for distinguishing a `Sequence` from a `Mapping`.

and of course 1 (actual normal inheritance) & 2 ("virtual subclasses" through `register`).

You are still missing my point about this not being a formal specification.

It's invalid to say "haha, I can do anything I want because it's not explicitly forbidden".

This is a valid approach with a formal specification.

It is meaningless with the Python docs.

So anything that implements `__len__`, no matter what it does, must do what behaviors? Furthermore, where is this specified? If not anywhere, why?

Membership testing on the ABC is clearly not promising anything other than the method is implemented.

As an example, what if I have `x` be an element of a free monoid. What about if I want `len(x)` to be the length of the word but when I iterate over it, I want the pairs `(gen, exp)` because that is what is most convenient for the implementation and applications.

It's also invalid to say "Because it doesn't follow my arbitrary specifications of what I think is good that you cannot do it."

Then please stop citing and using them as specifications or as a reason why we should do certain things.
