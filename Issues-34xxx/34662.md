We have

```
sage: cycles = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
sage: sage.combinat.permutation.from_cycles(6,cycles)
[2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 4]
sage: sage.combinat.permutation.from_cycles(6,(c for c in cycles))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

where the former result is correct and the latter is wrong.

The test of `int(x)` doesn't quite do what it is claiming to do:

```
sage: int(1.5)
1
```
It would be better to just explicit convert the inputs to `ZZ`, which can just fail.

Likewise, do `p[i] = ZZ(i+1)`.

Please factor out the `len(cycle)` calls as a variable in the loop as an optimization.
