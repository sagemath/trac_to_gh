I'm suggesting just doing `from ... import libgap` and also changing the one other line that uses `gap`.

It's fine, we can leave this as is, but currently searching for "import libgap as gap" (that is, `git grep "import.*libgap.*as.*gap`) comes up empty in the Sage library. I didn't know there was a proposal to rename libgap to gap.
