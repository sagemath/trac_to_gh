- `src/setup.py` (used when `--enable-editable` is in use) will continue to do a monolithic build as of this ticket
- the direct installation mode (`--disable-wheels --disable-editable`) will use an environment variable so that `pkgs/sagemath-standard/setup.py` falls back to do a monolithic build (or check if it can be done by `src/setup.py`)
