Cython warns of a use after free in `src/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/cutwidth.pyx`, in `cutwidth_dyn`.  The `try` block on line 518 has a `finally` clause that deallocates `neighborhoods`.  But the very next line of code after the `finally` clause passes `neighborhoods` to `find_order`.  The fix is to move the final 2 lines of code inside the `try` block so that `neighborhoods` is not deallocated until the function exits.

Good catch. With the current code, I can get

```
sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.cutwidth import cutwidth_dyn
sage: G = Graph()
sage: cutwidth_dyn(G, lower_bound=1)
(164935984, [])
sage: cutwidth_dyn(G, lower_bound=10)
(164935984, [])
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: cutwidth_dyn(G, lower_bound=20)
(164936464, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
```

If I'm not mistaken, these 2 lines are used only for trivial cases (`lower_boud >= G.size()`, `G.order() == 0`), right ? so may be it's best to remove the 2 lines and deal with the trivial cases before.
