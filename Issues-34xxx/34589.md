I would say that the vector field modules are indeed reflexive for the cases we can treat with Sage, namely those for which the manifold M can be split into a finite number of parallelizable manifolds N_i, i.e. there is a finite open cover of M, (N_i)_{1\leq i \leq p} (p finite), such that for each i, N_i is parallelizable. Let then consider an element f of `X(M)**`, where `X(M)` is the C<sup>oo</sup>(M)-module of vector fields on M. For a in `X(M)*`, f(a) can be reduced to f_i(a_i) on each N_i. Since N_i is parallelizable, X(N_i) is a free module of finite rank and thus reflexive. There exists then a unique v_i in X(N_i) such that f_i(a_i) = a_i(v_i). Then the vector field v in X(M) defined as being equal to v_i on each N_i obeys f(a) = a(v), which shows that the canonical map `X(M) --> X(M)**` is bijective. This is a first quick thought and this should be double checked...

Is this splitting into parallelizable manifolds explicitly done somewhere in the code?

I guess a subtlety is that in sage.manifolds a manifold M is thought to be immutable but new submanifolds on it can be declared imperatively. At any point, of course only finitely many submanifolds have been declared in M as a Python object, but it's not clear that M as a mathematical object is really assumed to be covered by only a finite number of parallelizable submanifolds...

Not explicitly, but `DifferentiableManifold`'s have the attribute `_parrelizable_parts`; for instance:

```
sage: M = manifolds.Sphere(2, coordinates='stereographic')
sage: M._parallelizable_parts
{Open subset S^2-{NP,SP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3,
 Open subset S^2-{NP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3,
 Open subset S^2-{SP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3}
sage: M._open_covers
[[2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3],
 [Open subset S^2-{NP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3,
  Open subset S^2-{SP} of the 2-sphere S^2 of radius 1 smoothly embedded in the Euclidean space E^3]]
```
Actually the parallelizable parts are declared on the fly, in the same spirit as the charts and other structures on the manifod. Even the parallelizable aspect of the manifold can appear quite late after the manifold instanciation. For example, in this [notebook about S^1](https://nbviewer.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_sphere_S1.ipynb), the manifold is (implicitly) declared parallelizable only in cell no. 21, by declaring a vector frame on it.

However, one could imagine to add the keyword argument `parallelizable` to the manifold constructor (with default being `False`).

You're right, this should be stated in the manifold documentation. The whole idea is described in Sec. 3.2 and 3.3 of this [document](https://ccirm.centre-mersenne.org/item/CCIRM_2018__6_1_A1_0/).
Note that the finite number of parallelizable pieces is not a very severe limitation. For instance this holds for any compact manifold. Actually I don't know any manifold that is not of this type, not that I doubt that some examples can be constructed...

An entry for the new file `reflexive_module.py` is missing in `src/doc/en/reference/tensor_free_modules/`, so that the documentation is not generated. I would suggest to add it in `src/doc/en/reference/tensor_free_modules/tensors.rst`. Once this is done,

```
sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules html
```
reveals that some `$` signs should be replaced by backticks:

```diff

+    the `R`-module of linear functionals `\phi:\ M \longrightarrow R`.
```
