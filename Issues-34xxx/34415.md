Given a polynomial `f(x, y)`, the method `braid_monodromy` starts with changes of variables of the type `x: x + y` till the global degree of `f` coincides with its `y`-degree. Next step is to compute its discriminant with respect to `y`.

Applying it to an example of a polynomial of degree 18 with coefficients in a number field of index 12 yields to more that 30 minutes of computation time. This polynomial has three factors. The computation of the discriminant of each factor and the resultant of the three pairs of factors is done in 15 seconds.

Now `Sirocco` takes into account the factors, so computing the discriminant via the factorization would reduce the time of computation. 

In the same ideas, it is useful for arrangements of curves to know to which irreducible component each strand of the braids correspond. A new function is define, `braid_monodromy_arrangement` which yields both the braid monodromy and the information of the strands.

Finally, a way to obtain a Puiseux presentation of the fundamental group is given.
