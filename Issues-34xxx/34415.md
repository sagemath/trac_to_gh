Given a polynomial `f(x, y)`, the method `braid_monodromy` starts with changes of variables of the type `x: x + y` till the global degree of `f` coincides with its `y`-degree. Next step is to compute its discriminant with respect to `y`.

Applying it to an example of a polynomial of degree 18 with coefficients in a number field of index 12 yields to more that 30 minutes of computation time. This polynomial has three factors. The computation of the discriminant of each factor and the resultant of the three pairs of factors is done in 15 seconds.

Now `Sirocco` takes into account the factors, so computing the discriminant via the factorization would reduce the time of computation. 

In the same ideas, it is useful for arrangements of curves to know to which irreducible component each strand of the braids correspond. A new function is define, `braid_monodromy_arrangement` which yields both the braid monodromy and the information of the strands.

Finally, a way to obtain a Puiseux presentation of the fundamental group is given.

At some point the description will be updated since more tasks have been done to shorten times of execution by replacing at some places `QQbar` by some number fields embedded in `QQbar`. Besides typos corrctions and more serious improvements there are a couple of things that could be done:\n- Create classes of arrangement of affine or projective curves; besides braid monodromy of fundamental group, other methods could be created, e.g. for singular points assignment of branches to components.\n- For the computation of `braid_monodromy`, there is an intermediate step consisting in the computation of a *geometric basis* of the fundamental group of a punctured plane.

<a id='comment:19'></a>This version passess the tests. At some point the description will be updated since more tasks have been done to shorten times of execution by replacing at some places `QQbar` by some number fields embedded in `QQbar`. Besides typos corrctions and more serious improvements there are a couple of things that could be done:
- Create classes of arrangement of affine or projective curves; besides braid monodromy of fundamental group, other methods could be created, e.g. for singular points assignment of branches to components.
- For the computation of `braid_monodromy`, there is an intermediate step consisting in the computation of a *geometric basis* of the fundamental group of a punctured plane. Sometimes it gives an error stopping the computations; we (`@`mmarco and me) analyzed the problem and he found out how to correct it.
