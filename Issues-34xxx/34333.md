I don't know the math well enough to be able to do the computations myself, but I hope that Simon (or his coauthor) can check the calculations arising in

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: H = CohomologyRing(27,4)
sage: H.make()
sage: BC = H.bar_code('LowerCentralSeries')
sage: BC.show()
...
sage: BC.data()
...
```
and in particular the `ascii_art` error here.
