Thanks Travis for the suggestions.

Trying to include the underlying set in the parent, I stumbled upon the "element_constructor" not doing the job of using the correct specific parent. This is not the first time I meet this kind of issue, but I am still unable to fix that.

Also, I would like to avoid using the sage `Set` at all, because it seems to be deadly slow.

I don't quite understand your problem with `element_constructor`. Can you give me a little more detail?

I agree that we should avoid using `Set`, but we then require hashability for `frozenset`. This is desirable, and I don't see any real use-case otherwise. However, it is a slightly backwards incompatible change.

We will also need to special case the base set in `to_packed_word()` when the parent is `OrderedSetPartitions_all`. I also don't see a real use-case for such a parent.

One micro-optimization: The change

```diff
-        par = parent(self)
+        par = self.parent()
```
is slightly slower because the first is a Cython function call (that accesses the Cython slot) versus a Python method call:

```
sage: O = OrderedSetPartition()
sage: %timeit parent(O)
28 ns ± 0.415 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit O.parent()
55.6 ns ± 0.234 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000,000 loops each)
```
Up to you if you want to revert it.

I just pushed another >2x speedup by avoiding the useless check (comment:4 point 2).

I do think it would be nice to get rid of the `Set`. I highly doubt anyone will be affected by that change. If anyone is affected, then we can just apologize to them and tell them to make their objects immutable. Iterating over `OrderedSetPartitions(7)` now, over 80% of the time is spent in `Set.__init__`.
