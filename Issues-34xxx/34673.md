Thanks Travis for the suggestions.

Trying to include the underlying set in the parent, I stumbled upon the "element_constructor" not doing the job of using the correct specific parent. This is not the first time I meet this kind of issue, but I am still unable to fix that.

Also, I would like to avoid using the sage `Set` at all, because it seems to be deadly slow.

I don't quite understand your problem with `element_constructor`. Can you give me a little more detail?

I agree that we should avoid using `Set`, but we then require hashability for `frozenset`. This is desirable, and I don't see any real use-case otherwise. However, it is a slightly backwards incompatible change.

We will also need to special case the base set in `to_packed_word()` when the parent is `OrderedSetPartitions_all`. I also don't see a real use-case for such a parent.

One micro-optimization: The change

```diff
-        par = parent(self)
+        par = self.parent()
```
is slightly slower because the first is a Cython function call (that accesses the Cython slot) versus a Python method call:

```
sage: O = OrderedSetPartition()
sage: %timeit parent(O)
28 ns ± 0.415 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit O.parent()
55.6 ns ± 0.234 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000,000 loops each)
```
Up to you if you want to revert it.

I just pushed another >2x speedup by avoiding the useless check (comment:4 point 2).

I do think it would be nice to get rid of the `Set`. I highly doubt anyone will be affected by that change. If anyone is affected, then we can just apologize to them and tell them to make their objects immutable. Iterating over `OrderedSetPartitions(7)` now, over 80% of the time is spent in `Set.__init__`.

ok, if you say so. Looks good to me

Vincent suggested to check if the original code in sage could be made more efficient than our current proposal, once no longer using Set. This seems unlikely to me.
