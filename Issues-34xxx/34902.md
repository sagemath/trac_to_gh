I got a mail about my posting in year 2017: "However, I read Stephan's paper differently: He states that breadth k is equivalent  to containing a Boolean lattice with k atoms (but none with k+1 atoms) as a subORDER, and then states in his Lemma 1 that in the case k=3 this is the same as subLATTICE."

Hence documentation of `breadth()` in `LatticePoset` containing

This can be also characterized by sublattices: a lattice of breadth at least `$n$` contains a sublattice isomorphic to the Boolean lattice of `$2^n$` elements.

must be changed to

This can be also characterized by subposets: a lattice of breadth at least `$n$` contains a subposet isomorphic to the Boolean lattice of `$2^n$` elements.
