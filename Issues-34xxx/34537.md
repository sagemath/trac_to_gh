Only two remaining issues that are going to need more help from experts:

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/interfaces/genus2reduction.py  # 15 doctests failed
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/jacobian_generic.py  # 10 doctests failed
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/jacobian_endomorphism_utils.py  # 4 doctests failed
```
These are caused by the changes in gp's `genus2red` output from https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=pari.git;a=commitdiff;h=a41e4fa95925eae42830217313583efc80628763

Sage's `genus2reduction.py` needs to be adapted to those changes.

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/groups/fqf_orthogonal.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

This is a weird issue that involves pari and gap code. Needs further investigation.

Instead of using the `ellQ_ellrank` from Denis Simon script we should be using the `ellrank` from PARI/GP (available from version 2.15). Though, the latter only works over rational numbers.

If done, this would simplify the patch at #33360, which currently chooses from two distinct implementations depending on the PARI version.

Replacing\n\n```\nsage: assert Oq(OL.0) == Oq(OL.0.matrix())\n```\nwith\n\n```\nsage: assert Oq(OL.1) == Oq(OL.1.matrix())\n```\ngives the same failure with pari 2.13. So, even though this looks like an actual issue, it is not a regression from the pari update, it just happened to work by chance before due to a different matrix being tested. I think we should just flag this as known bug and proceed with this.\n\n---\nNew commits:\n|                                                                                                                                          |                               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|[48ea610](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=48ea610d2f4fca63dbeccd0ba575d458097267e2)|`fix doctest if fqf_orthogonal`|",

Replying to [Antonio Rojas](#comment%3A35):
> This is almost ready, just needs someone to figure out the failure in `sage/groups/fqf_orthogonal.py`


OK, from a closer look it looks like this is just caused by a different choice of generators for the orthogonal group. Replacing

```
sage: assert Oq(OL.0) == Oq(OL.0.matrix())
```
with

```
sage: assert Oq(OL.1) == Oq(OL.1.matrix())
```
gives the same failure with pari 2.13. So, even though this looks like an actual issue, it is not a regression from the pari update, it just happened to work by chance before due to a different matrix being tested. I think we should just flag this as known bug and proceed with this.

Pari 2.15.1 includes the fix I cherry picked in my last comment.

The current HEAD of cypari2 already fied testsuite passes on pari 2.15, and Vincent said he will do a release soon.

It would be very nice if this can be merged for 9.8.

On OS X Intel, the basic functionality is there (i.e., Sage builds and `make ptestlong` works), but the test suite for pari hangs. I see this in the log file, with no changes in more than an hour:

This is after running `export SAGE_CHECK=yes` and `make pari`.

genus2reduction: makes sense for our doctests to just have y^2 = ... since these reductions are not unique. The most important thing is for the minimal discriminant to be correct which we do check.

cusps_nf: OK

lfunctions/*: OK

libs/pari/tests: OK

S_unit_solver: OK

number_field/*: OK

polynomial/*: OK

QQbar: looks reasonable, would take ages to rigorously check everything

elliptic_curves/
ell_field: OK (the two fields are isomorphic)
ell_generic: OK (0 is displayed differently)

ell_number_field: (1) the first simon_two_descent test in the diffs is strange as E is defined by EllipticCurve(K, '37') where K is a number field; the resulting curve is the one with label '37a1'.  Would you believe tat I had never noticed that the function parse_cremona_label() was happy both to have the curve number default to 1 (which I knew) and also the isogeny class letter code default to 'a'?  Fine, it is documented, but one day I'll change that '37' to '37a1' to be less obscure.
(2) the different matrices are OK since the rows/cols will be permuted if the curves in the class are sorted differently; the docstring (written by me) says "The curves in the class are sorted first by CM discriminant (then lexicographically using
a-invariants)" which can lead to differences, either because the field generator changes or because the choice of minimal reduced model (and hence the a-invariants) is not deterministic.  One day I'll implement the LMFDB way of sorting curves in the class.

The rest of the elliptic curves stuff is fine.

Note that we no longer need, and could deprecate, the simon_two_descent() method for curves over QQ, since the pari ellrank() function will always be better (being a C implementation with a lot of extra geatures of the same underlying theory).

and ensuing error in this file have nothing to do with Pari.
Are we still supporting 32-bit seriously? 
Indeed, these 32-bit errors should have been caught elsewhere.


I wonder whether Pari 2.15.1 passes its selftests on 32-bit, too.

Precisely. The 387 fpu has a switch to choose between 64-bit (double) and 80-bit (long double) arithmetic. The problem is that transcendental functions depend on 80 bit arithmetic to give accurate 64 bit results 🤦‍♂️

Just linking to pari (without even initializing it) will affect a program, as demonstrated in the test program in my commit message (https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/pari/patches/float32.patch).

Maybe it is possible to override the -mpc64 setting in pari library by explicitly adding -mpc80 to the linking step of sage. Or adding code in sage init to explicitly initialize the FPU to a safe mode.

Be warned that removing the `-mpc64` flag in pari might result in some numerical differences on pari itself due to 80 bit precission. In void linux we compile pari with `-ffloat-store` which avoids this issue.
