Only two remaining issues that are going to need more help from experts:

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/interfaces/genus2reduction.py  # 15 doctests failed
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/jacobian_generic.py  # 10 doctests failed
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/jacobian_endomorphism_utils.py  # 4 doctests failed
```
These are caused by the changes in gp's `genus2red` output from https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=pari.git;a=commitdiff;h=a41e4fa95925eae42830217313583efc80628763

Sage's `genus2reduction.py` needs to be adapted to those changes.

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sage/groups/fqf_orthogonal.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

This is a weird issue that involves pari and gap code. Needs further investigation.

The bug was fixed upstream, but we may want to keep the workaround. It's not particularly hackish and will allow to use an unpatched system pari 2.15.0

OK, from a closer look it looks like this is just caused by a different choice of generators for the orthogonal group. Replacing

```
sage: assert Oq(OL.0) == Oq(OL.0.matrix())
```
with

```
sage: assert Oq(OL.1) == Oq(OL.1.matrix())
```
gives the same failure with pari 2.13. So, even though this looks like an actual issue, it is not a regression from the pari update, it just happened to work by chance before due to a different matrix being tested. I think we should just flag this as known bug and proceed with this.

Dima, as noted at [#32785 comment:7](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32785#comment:7), it is not new that `giac` fails its test suite, at least on OS X machines. On Intel (old version of `giac` and `pari`):

Pari 2.15.1 includes the fix I cherry picked in my last comment.

The current HEAD of cypari2 already fied testsuite passes on pari 2.15, and Vincent said he will do a release soon.

It would be very nice if this can be merged for 9.8.

On OS X Intel, the basic functionality is there (i.e., Sage builds and `make ptestlong` works), but the test suite for pari hangs. I see this in the log file, with no changes in more than an hour:

genus2reduction: makes sense for our doctests to just have y^2 = ... since these reductions are not unique. The most important thing is for the minimal discriminant to be correct which we do check.

cusps_nf: OK

lfunctions/*: OK

libs/pari/tests: OK

S_unit_solver: OK

number_field/*: OK

polynomial/*: OK

QQbar: looks reasonable, would take ages to rigorously check everything

elliptic_curves/
ell_field: OK (the two fields are isomorphic)
ell_generic: OK (0 is displayed differently)

ell_number_field: (1) the first simon_two_descent test in the diffs is strange as E is defined by EllipticCurve(K, '37') where K is a number field; the resulting curve is the one with label '37a1'.  Would you believe tat I had never noticed that the function parse_cremona_label() was happy both to have the curve number default to 1 (which I knew) and also the isogeny class letter code default to 'a'?  Fine, it is documented, but one day I'll change that '37' to '37a1' to be less obscure.
(2) the different matrices are OK since the rows/cols will be permuted if the curves in the class are sorted differently; the docstring (written by me) says "The curves in the class are sorted first by CM discriminant (then lexicographically using
a-invariants)" which can lead to differences, either because the field generator changes or because the choice of minimal reduced model (and hence the a-invariants) is not deterministic.  One day I'll implement the LMFDB way of sorting curves in the class.

The rest of the elliptic curves stuff is fine.

Note that we no longer need, and could deprecate, the simon_two_descent() method for curves over QQ, since the pari ellrank() function will always be better (being a C implementation with a lot of extra geatures of the same underlying theory).

Failed example:
    float(f)
Expected:

and ensuing error in this file have nothing to do with Pari.
Are we still supporting 32-bit seriously? 
Indeed, these 32-bit errors should have been caught elsewhere.


I wonder whether Pari 2.15.1 passes its selftests on 32-bit, too.

The offending Pari commit, reverted by Gonzalo's patch, is not in 2.13.3, but is in 2.15.1.
Maybe it flips FPU switches somewhere...

Precisely. The 387 fpu has a switch to choose between 64-bit (double) and 80-bit (long double) arithmetic. The problem is that transcendental functions depend on 80 bit arithmetic to give accurate 64 bit results 🤦‍♂️

Just linking to pari (without even initializing it) will affect a program, as demonstrated in the test program in my commit message (https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/pari/patches/float32.patch).

Maybe it is possible to override the -mpc64 setting in pari library by explicitly adding -mpc80 to the linking step of sage. Or adding code in sage init to explicitly initialize the FPU to a safe mode.

Be warned that removing the `-mpc64` flag in pari might result in some numerical differences on pari itself due to 80 bit precission. In void linux we compile pari with `-ffloat-store` which avoids this issue.

I found an old laptop, last seriously used in 2008, it has ubuntu 10.04 installed (!) and a working Sage 4.7.  Must be 32-bit.  I wonder how much work it would be to get it into a state in which I could try building a new Sage (for testing things like this)?

l.7860: a terrible test of a weird function. The method `neg()` takes a parameter n which is not used (but is not optional), in the test a is used for the parameter (confusing), and -- worse -- the a which appears in the putput has nothing to do with the identifier a, it is a name chosen internally for some generator.

I think these three methods (neg, invert, conjugate) need attention.  The docstring for `conjugate()` wrongly says it returns the negation, a cut-and-paste error.

Years ago I spent a while improving the doctests in this >8000-line file but gave up after doing quite a lot!

I am willing to make a branch fixing all these except the first one (src/sage/parallel/decorate.py). Should I base that on u/dimpase/packages/pari2151 ?

these errors are OK - but indeed, you can put the tarball into upstream/ to avoid chasing it down.

I also usually edit the mirror list to have just one entry - then these go quick

```
$ cat upstream/mirror_list
['https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.sagemath.org/']
```
