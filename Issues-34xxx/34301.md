In the 9.6 release cycle, https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/GOGWk66zaCQ/m/M_jQiOjaAAAJ:
  Users/developers who like to continue using the Cygwin port are asked to step up to investigating and fixing these bugs on Cygwin. Otherwise, it is unlikely that we'll be able to continue offering the Cygwin port.

This has not happened, and on top of the problems at runtime in Sage 9.6, there are now several [issues](https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=closed&status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&status=positive_review&component=porting%3A+Cygwin&milestone=sage-9.8&milestone=sage-9.7&milestone=sage-9.6&milestone=sage-9.5&milestone=sage-9.4&milestone=sage-9.3&milestone=sage-9.2&milestone=sage-9.1&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=priority&col=changetime&col=author&col=reviewer&desc=1&order=changetime) that prevent a successful installation on Cygwin.

The documentation change is trivial, yes. However, it is the policy change of no longer putting any effort to care about Cygwin builds means is will further bitrot. So it will likely take much more effort to resupport Cygwin in the future.

No, it was already badly broken in the 9.6 series. Per ​https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/GOGWk66zaCQ/m/M_jQiOjaAAAJ (March 2022) "various segfaults, likely related to GAP", in the testsuite.

The broken Giac build stops us from seeing other build problems with packages that we updated in the 9.7 series. Giac upstream does not test Cygwin, and I have no line of communication with them. There's also another critical bug in Giac (#33848) and no reaction from upstream.

I worded https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/ReleaseTours/sage-9.7#Sage9.7doesnotsupportCygwinuseWindowsSubsystemforLinuxinstead carefully -- it does not say that we have "dropped" Cygwin support; it only says that Sage 9.7 doesn't support it, and it lists the issues.

Also note that this ticket does not remove the Cygwin testing infrastructure -- in fact, I made major investments in it during the 9.7 cycle - #33791, which makes it very easy for upstream projects to reuse this infrastructure to test the portability of their project. (see for example https://github.com/latte-int/latte/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-sage.yml#L93)
But we need engagement of developers on our side and in upstream projects with the Cygwin port.
