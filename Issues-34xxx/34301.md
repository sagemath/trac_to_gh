In the 9.6 release cycle, https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/GOGWk66zaCQ/m/M_jQiOjaAAAJ:
  Users/developers who like to continue using the Cygwin port are asked to step up to investigating and fixing these bugs on Cygwin. Otherwise, it is unlikely that we'll be able to continue offering the Cygwin port.

This has not happened, and on top of the problems at runtime in Sage 9.6, there are now several [issues](https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=closed&status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&status=positive_review&component=porting%3A+Cygwin&milestone=sage-9.8&milestone=sage-9.7&milestone=sage-9.6&milestone=sage-9.5&milestone=sage-9.4&milestone=sage-9.3&milestone=sage-9.2&milestone=sage-9.1&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=priority&col=changetime&col=author&col=reviewer&desc=1&order=changetime) that prevent a successful installation on Cygwin.

The documentation change is trivial, yes. However, it is the policy change of no longer putting any effort to care about Cygwin builds means is will further bitrot. So it will likely take much more effort to resupport Cygwin in the future.

No, it was already badly broken in the 9.6 series. Per ​https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/GOGWk66zaCQ/m/M_jQiOjaAAAJ (March 2022) "various segfaults, likely related to GAP", in the testsuite.

The broken Giac build stops us from seeing other build problems with packages that we updated in the 9.7 series. Giac upstream does not test Cygwin, and I have no line of communication with them. There's also another critical bug in Giac (#33848) and no reaction from upstream.
