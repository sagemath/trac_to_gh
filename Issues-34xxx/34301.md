  Users/developers who like to continue using the Cygwin port are asked to step up to investigating and fixing these bugs on Cygwin. Otherwise, it is unlikely that we'll be able to continue offering the Cygwin port.

This has not happened, and on top of the problems at runtime in Sage 9.6, there are now several [issues](https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=closed&status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&status=positive_review&component=porting%3A+Cygwin&milestone=sage-9.8&milestone=sage-9.7&milestone=sage-9.6&milestone=sage-9.5&milestone=sage-9.4&milestone=sage-9.3&milestone=sage-9.2&milestone=sage-9.1&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=priority&col=changetime&col=author&col=reviewer&desc=1&order=changetime) that prevent a successful installation on Cygwin.

It seems like we have a more nuanced description of support we have for it. It seems like the biggest issue is in docbuilding and (recently) giac. If we fully drop support for it as the ticket proposes, then almost certainly we will never get it back.

I am willing to do what I can to help as I have a Windows machine (that previously built Sage successfully on at least 9.5 IIRC, but I think it was one of the 9.6 beta versions). Although I am a bit stretched thin right now and package building is not something I know much about. However, I do think it is not something we should drop for WSL for the next few years until we are more certain most people have migrated to a Windows version that has WSL.

If we do decide to fully drop support (rather than just being honest about what we know doesn't work), we might want to include instructions to build the last stable version that we know works.

No, it was already badly broken in the 9.6 series. Per ​https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/GOGWk66zaCQ/m/M_jQiOjaAAAJ (March 2022) "various segfaults, likely related to GAP", in the testsuite.

The broken Giac build stops us from seeing other build problems with packages that we updated in the 9.7 series. Giac upstream does not test Cygwin, and I have no line of communication with them. There's also another critical bug in Giac (#33848) and no reaction from upstream.

I worded https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/ReleaseTours/sage-9.7#Sage9.7doesnotsupportCygwinuseWindowsSubsystemforLinuxinstead carefully -- it does not say that we have "dropped" Cygwin support; it only says that Sage 9.7 doesn't support it, and it lists the issues.

Also note that this ticket does not remove the Cygwin testing infrastructure -- in fact, I made major investments in it during the 9.7 cycle - #33791, which makes it very easy for upstream projects to reuse this infrastructure to test the portability of their project. (see for example https://github.com/latte-int/latte/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-sage.yml#L93)
But we need engagement of developers on our side and in upstream projects with the Cygwin port.

Thanks. I weakened the language `should` -> `can` to further indicate that we hope to bring back Cygwin support in future versions.

I will also try to be more active in maintaining Cygwin support, but starting sometime next month, I will become very busy with family stuff. At the very least, I can test stuff on my Windows machine.

I should point out that we should make similar changes here for this ticket. In particular, saying Cygwin support has discontinued means, to me, that we will not bring back support later on.

Thinking a bit more, I think we should leave the Cygwin installation guide in the docs because someone might want to install, say, 9.5 using Cygwin. This way the instructions are still there for people who might need to use Cygwin and are fine with an older version.
