Their product has a simple generating set, but right now Sage does not allow this:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,2,2)
sage: IL = MS * [2*MS.0,3*MS.1]
sage: IR = MS.3 * MS
sage: IL * IR
...
NotImplementedError: Cannot multiply non-commutative ideals.
```
We fix this.

Component: **algebra**

Keywords: **ideals**
