Various files in `sage/interfaces/` have this pattern:

```
class Octave(...):
    ....

octave = Octave()
```
When combined with `from .octave import Octave, octave` in `sage/interfaces/all.py`, this means that an instance of `Octave` is created when Sage starts up. I think we should avoid this with lazy imports.

Regarding the change

Do we need to deprecate this before just removing it? I don't know what purpose it was supposed to serve, except perhaps it is the remnants of some old code that once looped through it.

Where do the ".all" namespaces actually get used and for what? Are they just to trigger initialization of modules? Or do people use them to access symbols too? They certainly be *importing* symbols from them. Especially with lazy imports, that leads to undesirable side-effects (see e.g. #16522):

```
sage: type(maxima_calculus)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: type(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima is maxima_calculus  # they are the same object
True
sage: maxima_calculus(1)

sage: type(maxima_calculus)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: type(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)

`sage.interfaces` is a namespace package, so we're getting rid of imports from `sage.interfaces.all` within the Sage library, see #34201. When this is done, all that will remain is the reimport into `sage.all`, to fill the interactive top level as the only purpose.

Ah, OK, so our current infrastructure actually guarantees that `LazyImport`s in `sage.all` end up broken in the toplevel. Possible fixes would be to build the global namespace piecemeal and recreate appropriate `LazyImport` objects rather than just referencing them, or just do the copy and then clean them up with something like `clean_namespace` (see #16522). The latter is much easier to implement. It looks like cleaning `sage.all` and the toplevel namespace upon construction would give us a lot of benefit for relatively low effort.

One reason to ensure `LazyImport` shims don't stay lying around, especially at top level, is that documentation is only partially transparently reported. Compare:

```
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima? # reports doc but with wrong type, signature, and source file
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.maxima? # second time is OK
```

versus

```
sage: maxima_calculus? # never gets type, signature, and source file right
```

Note:

```
sage: maxima_calculus?? # finds source but is still missing type and signature
```

Replying to [Nils Bruin](#comment%3A12):
> so our current infrastructure actually guarantees that `LazyImport`s in `sage.all` end up broken in the toplevel. Possible fixes would be to [...] or just do the copy and then clean them up with something like `clean_namespace` (see #16522). The latter is much easier to implement. It looks like cleaning `sage.all` and the toplevel namespace upon construction would give us a lot of benefit for relatively low effort.


Thanks for the pointer to #16522. I haven't looked at the details, but this sounds promising.

Apologies, indeed, the "*_console" objects are just functions that, in the terminal, just starts a fresh process; as far as I can see simply as a "subshell": it just executes "os.system(cmd)". I think it's very rare current usage of sage would use that and it's easily replicated by other means, so I'd expect the "*_console" routines can just go.

In fact, as it stands, they are not available in my global namespace! So somehow:

```
try:
    from sage.repl.rich_output.display_manager import get_display_manager as _get_display_manager
except ImportError:
    pass
else:
    if _get_display_manager().is_in_terminal():
        [BLOCK]
```
must have led to not executing [BLOCK], even though on the IPython command line `is_in_terminal` does return true and the import succeeds as well. Perhaps during initialization one of these things works differently?

My concern was for the interface objects themselves (the "magma" and "octave" instances): those are not just functions. They're actually instances of a quite complicated class. 
They're obviously written to be quite light-weight (only initializing the expect interface if they're called) so you may want to do some timings to see if making them lazy actually saves anything measurable.

I think that's a good solution. 

I don't think we need to be concerned about use of these functions in user code that would try to import them from sage.interfaces.all.
