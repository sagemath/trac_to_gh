In #33950, free (graded) resolutions for modules over polynomial rings were added. However, one needs to import a top-level function to do the construction. The goal of this ticket is to add a method, such as `free_resolution()`, to these (sub)modules (and ideals) to ease access.

Depends on #33950

@kwankyu How broadly is Singular's functionality for free (graded) resolutions support to work? I can't seem to find anything definitive in the online documentation. Will it work for any commutative ring? How about any integral domain, such as

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([x^2 - y^2 - 1])
sage: Q = R.quo(I)
sage: Q.is_integral_domain()
True
```
The submodule code currently does not quite do this. (I am doing #34380 to be able to make submodules over more arbitrary integral domains.)

This is pretty definitive:

Definitely not. Singular uses Groebner bases, which do not apply to arbitrary commutative rings. Or do I misunderstand your question?

I don't find it so clear. What `R` is there? Is it a quotient of a polynomial ring like for the syzygies? The invocation of the Hilbert Syzygy Theorem does suggest that it is only for polynomial rings, but it might also be saying that it might not work for some quotients (but it might try).

I am not an expert in (computational) commutative algebras; thank you for the explanation.

So I will likely have to raise `NotImplementedError` in a number of cases, but at least it will be more publicly visible.

I agree that it is vague. It says that `R` is a quotient of K[x]_> where K[x] is a multivariate polynomial ring.

In Singular, a monomial order > can be global, local, or mixed. Depending on this, K[x]_> may define just K[x], a localization of K[x], or something more complicated.

So according to the above definition, `R` can be something far from the plain K[x].

I never worked in Singular  with a monomial order other than global, the usual monomial orders. As far as I know, Sage also uses Singular's functionality limited to global monomial orders.

For (graded) free resolutions imported into Sage in a recent ticket, `R` is definitely the plain K[x].

I just looked over Singular manual, and I found no example of computing a free resolution for a module where `R` is other than the plain K[x], though I might be just unlucky.
 
> Will it work for any commutative ring?

`free_resolution()` could be attached to at least

- quotients of polynomial rings
- ideals of polynomial rings
- quotients of free modules over polynomial rings
- submodules of free modules over polynomial rings

It seems that #33950 doesn't handle the univariate case either:

Is this expected?

From the Singular documentation, I am guessing it also requires the polynomial ring to be over a field (mainly **Z** is not allowed either)?

Right.

Perhaps Singular requires K of K[x] to be a field. With R univariate polynomial ring, there is nothing interesting with free resolutions, as all submodules are free as you said.

Okay, it is finally all ready. It took me a bit of time to figure out that when the matrix over-determines the system over a PID, then we should compute the echelon form.

One point of controversy might be the repr for the multigraded cases. My change effects the prints `(0,...,0)` and `(-a, -b)` instead of `0` and `-(a, b)`, respectively. I think this is better to indicate the multigrading by being verbose here. I can also change it so that `M((0,0))` gets printed as `M(0, 0)` instead, which might also be better.

(1) As mentioned in :comment:11, no one is interested in computing the free resolution of a free module, because it is trivially defined by a free basis of the free module. Hence

(2) `[Graded]FreeResolution` is designed (and documented so) to work with modules over **multivariate** polynomial rings (via Singular). Moreover

(3) The added logic slows down the class, however slightly, for most useful cases just because of trivial cases no serious user of free resolutions would use. 

If you want to support free resolutions for free modules for completeness (I understand this motivation because you are adding the method `.[graded]free_resolution()` to arbitrary modules), you define a new class `FreeResolution_free_module` (and may need renaming `FreeResolution` to `FreeResolution_polynomial`) and make the `free_resolution()` method dispatch for appropriate resolution class depending on the kind of the module (or the base ring).

No. The base ring does not change during the computation.

Yes. It is about projective morphisms. The smallest projective space is `P^1`, whose coordinate ring has two variables.

It was my mistake that I didn't name it `FreeResolution_polynomial` from the first.

I can't work on this in following days. Let me get back to you later, with other (perhaps minor) edits.

sage: isinstance(Tableaux(max_entry=5), Tableaux)

This isn't universal, and for very complicated implementations, like matrices and polynomial rings, the burden on developers (and sometimes because of the implementation choice) would be too great to have this feature.

No problem. There isn't a rush on this as this almost certainly won't get into 9.7.

This is still experimental. 

I introduced `ConstructorBaseclassMetaclass` slightly modified from `ClasscallMetaclass`. The idea is to separate the constructor definition from the base class definition but still manage so that `isinstance(r, FreeResolution)` holds.

For me, the separation is more important, but the `isinstance` feature is more visible. Hence this compromise.

If you were going to construct a `FreeResolution`, which returned something where `isinstance(res, FreeResolution)` is `True`, you would actually be looking at a different place for the construction than in `FreeResolution`? This is completely contrary with the behavior of `__init__`.

> The sole reason to put the constructor inside the class via `__classcall_private__` is to make `isinstance` feature work. You agreed with this. No?

Not with it being the sole reason; just a reason. It also associates the constructor (and any potential normalization of inputs) with the class itself. It also means you do not have to write duplicate documentation or have any question about where certain documentation aspects should go. It also makes it visible by, e.g., `FreeResolution??`.

> Moreover it is hard to realize that the code defined in the method `__classcall_private__` actually serves as a constructor. The new metaclass is explicit about this. 

I agree that the name makes it somewhat difficult to see this without realizing that you have something with a `ClasscallMetaclass` for the uninitiated, including what the method `__classcall_[private_]_` is suppose to do.

The problems I have with it are:

1. It is duplicating what `ClasscallMetaclass` does with a different name.
2. How do you resolve the issue of who-does-what when it also is, e.g., a `UniqueRepresentation` (both normalization and dispatch)?
3. It is not scalable: You need a completely parallel tree of classcall metaclass subclass tree (e.g., `ClasscallMetaclassInheritComparisons`).

Because of the size of the duplication, (1) is a relatively small issue. However, it does have a code smell to me.
(2) could be resolved with judicious and meticulous documentation, but I suspect it will just reinforce (1).
(3) Right now, the number of classes is small, but it does create lots of extra maintenance burden for future developers (basically technical debt).

Since your biggest issue seems to be discoverability for a programmer with the name (which could potentially also be resolved in cases like this with some code comments, say, just before the class declaration or the `__init__()` method), perhaps we can add a feature to `ClasscallMetaclass` that also parses in `__construction__` (using your experimental name; not 100% set on it yet, possible alternatives `__dispatcher__` or `__factory__`).

> `Parent` is unique in the whole sage library. It is irrelevant how `Parent` solves its own problem.  

It is just an example. Right now I don't think we have any others, but this is something that has its uses (although there are likely better methods of doing this; this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13280680/how-dangerous-is-setting-self-class-to-something-else) talks a bit about them). However, what would you expect in such a case? In particular, why is that different than automatic dispatching to a subclass?

By your idiom, we have "constructor + base class" (CB). It seems you see CB primarily as a constructor and I see CB as primarily a base class. This controversy itself indicates CB is a bad idiom. CB is against the principle of separation of concerns.

I don't see why it is desirable to associate the constructor and the base class by combining the code. There is no duplication in documentations. Actually in (CB), there is no place for either of them.

> It also makes it visible by, e.g., `FreeResolution??`.

Hmm. This is a critical disadvantage of my new metaclass (MC). It will show the documentation of the base class. But this might be fixed.

As I originally suggested, I prefer the classical solution (CL): 

```
def FreeResolution(...):  # constructor
    ...

class FreeResolution_base(...):  # base class
    ....
```

The sole reason I devised the new metaclass is to make `isinstance` feature work. (I think your idiom was first devised for the same purpose. No?) By the way, how important is this feature? This is for end users. I don't really see a use case. Is it important when working with combinatorial objects?

Sorry. I don't really understand the issues. A simple-minded answer: do not use MC in problematic situations.

> Since your biggest issue seems to be discoverability for a programmer with the name ...

My biggest issue is the presence of the definition of the constructor inside the base class. This looks strange and is hard to understand what is going on with the class. It will be the same when a developer sees it for the first time.

However, what would you expect in such a case? In particular, why is that different than automatic dispatching to a subclass?

The difference from what `Parent` does with `__class__` is that the detailed **code** of the automatic dispatching (what a constructor does) is all visible inside the base class. (MC) works in the same way with (CB) but moves the dispatching code out of the base class.

This is what this idiom is doing with a bit of syntatic sugar to make it work through the usual `__call__` protocol (by overriding that special method).

> By your idiom, we have "constructor + base class" (CB). It seems you see CB primarily as a constructor and I see CB as primarily a base class.

No, I see it as both because a base class should have a way to return an instance of itself based upon inputs. Good OOP says you don't care about the implementation details; in this case, the exact class is constructed. Python just doesn't have a good hook for this; `__init__` is already working with a specific instance.

> This controversy itself indicates CB is a bad idiom.

That is an absurd argument: Any controversy implies bad idiom.

> CB is against the principle of separation of concerns.

This makes no sense. It is the concern of the object to construct itself.

From doing a bit of Google searching, the modern trend in a factory design pattern (which is the construction function/method here) when there is a common base case is to associate the factory object to the base class ([a C++ example](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/factory-design-pattern-vishal-chovatiya/)). This is what this idiom is doing with a bit of syntatic sugar to make it work through the usual `__call__` protocol (by overriding that special method). We have just chosen a fairly generic name of `__classcall__` (that reflects when the method is called) rather than something more specific like `__construction__` or `_factory_`.

Yes there is. If we take (CL) remember that the forward facing documentation is in the constructor function. So `FreeResolution?` gives that documentation. However, if we do the same for `res?`, we get the class documentation of `FreeResolution_base`. Thus, where should the description of the object go?

Another way to think of this, which is what I am getting at with overriding `__class__`, is that it is an upscale version of `__init__` of the class. We at least agree that `__init__` should be defined in the class, right?

> Actually in (CB), there is no place for either of them.

All documentation about the object should clearly go in the class level description of the base class. Furthermore, if you need to document specific inputs to the base class, that can go in the `__init__` documentation, which is the natural place to look as it is describing its inputs.

I am just guessing about your possible solutions to this, but the top one would be to copy the base class's doc. However, you would also have to deal with the raw code (where there would be a disassociation with the documentation), doctests (how would I associate a particular doctest with the constructor versus the base class), and how we measure coverage (related also with how many duplicate tests would this yield).

AFAIK, the `ClasscallMetaclass` was originally for normalizing inputs to `CachedRepresentation`. Although it was soon applied to handle construction (and possibly dispatch) of element classes, such as `Tableau`, without having to construct an explicit parent. This was mostly used for combinatorial objects early on.

It is also useful for things like algebras that have different implementations based upon their inputs. Polynomial rings are a great example of this (but don't currently implement this idiom). For instance, you could have code like

```python
def foo(R=None):
    if R is None:
        R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x,y')
    if isinstance(R, PolynomialRing_general):
        return 1
    return 2
```
From a naïve look, why would the default argument for `R` lead to case `1`? It seems like they should be different. By being separate, the constructor is not under even a tacit promise to return a subclass of `PolynomialRing_general`. In fact, this is true in this example as there is no common ABC for univariate and multivariate polynomial rings (which has caused me some headaches).

You also have to rename something when there is a conflict between the name of the base class and the factory name:

```
sage: import_statements(matrix)
# ** Warning **: several names for that object: Matrix, matrix
from sage.matrix.constructor import Matrix
sage: from sage.structure.element import Matrix  # not the constructor!
```
Hence, it would make it easier on the developer who has to use the class.

Please define what you mean by a problematic situation. It seems like you are wanting to say it is a case when there is a conflict between your new metaclass and `UniqueRepresentation` (or anything else that uses one of the other metaclasses). This is not a feasible option as we need to support both behaviors. Your proposal is creating issues where there were none previously.

Thank you.

The only thing I am not sure about is the change for the resolution in free module handling things rather than `FreeResolution`. This also includes my implementation for the multipolynomial ideals (I think at the time, I didn’t have a single such entry point). We are duplicating some of the logic there, so there is more work to be done if another implementation is provided (in particular, if it expands the capabilities).

This isn’t really a big thing as we can revisit it should additional implementations be provided. I just wanted to see what you thought about this.

Like your `M.graded_free_resolution()`, the dispatching to specific free resolution subclasses (those with `_singular` and `_free_module` postfixes) should happen in `M.free_resolution()` as this method has information about `M`. I regard these methods as the primary dispatcher to the free resolution subclasses.

Then there is your `FreeResolution` dispatcher (I will not use the term "constructor" as, it seems, we understand the term differently) inside `FreeResolution` base class. I regard this as a secondary way to use the free resolution subclasses. Hence your dispatcher may use the methods `M.[graded_]free_resolution()` depending on the type of the input `M`. Then there would be no duplication of code.

> ... my implementation for the multipolynomial ideals (I think at the time, I didn’t have a single such entry point). 

I don't understand this. Would you name it explicitly? Where is it?

Your current proposal is not a good programming practice as it is not scalable. More concretely, you now have at least two different ways (that are not linked) for creating the free resolutions from, e.g., a module. Now you need to keep them consistent, which can be tedious as the code grows.

Then there would be no duplication of code.

This would be good with me. So we would have

```python
def __classcall_private__(cls, M, *args, **kwds):
    try:
        return M.free_resolution(*args, **kwds)
    except AttributeError:
        raise ValueError(“unable to construct a free resolution”)
```
It is just right now we are duplicating the code. You will also need to add a `[graded_]free_resolution()` method to matrices.

The reason I didn’t chose this approach was because there would still be some code duplication and scalability to address since all of these inputs types are treated as a module. For instance, if I implement a way to compute resolutions using a polynomial ring over an arbitrary field (not just ones that Singular can recognize). Then we need to update all of the different free resolution methods to allow for this more general case. However your proposal is reasonable and isn’t (yet) so unwieldy that it is a significant burden, so let’s go with it.

Clearly the main entry point was designed to be `FreeResolution`.

Free resolutions are about modules (ideals are also modules). Matrix is one way to specify a module. You don't need to attach the methods to matrices. I would not.

I changed the projective morphism to use the hook.

I also fixed some an issue with the previous ticket that I should have caught: the `singular.pyx` has full coverage now.

In `sage.rings.ideal`, you provided `free_resolution()` hook. In this context, an ideal is of a general commutative ring, but your code seems to assume that the ring is a univariate polynomial ring over a field. You need to check this first. If the ring is other than that, raise a `NotImplemented` error.

No. I wanted that the matrix input is kept in (`__init__()` of) free resolution subclasses.
But I even agreed to remove it if you want because of maintenance burden.

For `FreeResolution` dispatcher, I think that not accepting matrix input is the right way. I think I agreed upon this...

This isn't really that much of a burden, especially since we don't fundamentally want to work with the module but the underlying matrix. We have a good justification for the special case of matrices.

> For `FreeResolution` dispatcher, I think that not accepting matrix input is the right way. I think I agreed upon this...

If the class accepts a matrix, then the dispatcher should be able to handle the matrix. I think it would be really strange to have this discrepancy. Plus the constructor does some things to sanitize the input; in particular, it makes sure the matrix is immutable as this can lead to some very subtle bugs that are very hard to track down. (For example, you pass a mutable matrix into the constructor, compute the resolution, mutate the matrix; now the resolution does not necessarily match the input matrix.)

Actually, this makes me think of a case it should also handle: a free resolution input (where it would just return the input up to maybe stripping/adding the grading).

Thank you. This improved the code from my original proposal.

It took me a minute to realize that this is equivalent to the way I am used to seeing the definition of a resolution with `0 <- M <- F_1 <- ...`. However, this is definitely the better way to present this given the string representation.

Replying to [Travis Scrimshaw](#comment%3A76):

Thank you for the work. 

If we want to be more mathematical, matrix input may be entirely removed. But we may regard matrix input as an added conveniency feature. I am happy in either way.

A resolution of `M` is also said to be a resolution of `F_1/M`. See pages 22-23 of

https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/Book/ComputationsBook/book/book.pdf

It seems that "resolution of `M`" is more conventional, but I think "resolution of `F_1/M`" is more reasonable. If you want to augment `F_1 <- ... <- 0` at the left to get an exact sequence, that should be

`0 <- F_1/M <- F_1 <- ... <- 0`

where the canonical map `F_1/M <- F_1` is our 0-th differential map and `F_1/M` is our `target()`.
