Thanks for the info. Looks quite interesting. However, this fix here seems trivial -- can we get this in? At the very least the first commit.

Also, given that pari `ellmul` works with integer mod composite (in the sense that it either gives the right answer or gives a `Fp_inv` error) it seems a pity to fall back to a generic implementation as in #33228.

Same as mentioned in #33228, this was spotted by a student trying to implement ECM. It seems an important application... If point multiplication is implemented via `ellmul` this means the students might even have a shot at getting good speed if they can figure out how to choose the parameters.
