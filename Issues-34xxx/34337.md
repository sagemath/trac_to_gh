Some of these functions are also imported into the global namespace.

We replace all uses by `itertools.product`

<a id='comment:7'></a>This isn't quite a drop-and-replace because it loses the `cardinality()` method and it doesn't allow for repeat iterations.

```
sage: I = cartesian_product_iterator([[-1, 0, 1] for i in range(1)])
sage: Ip = itertools.product([-1, 0, 1], repeat=1)
sage: list(I)
[(-1,), (0,), (1,)]
sage: list(I)
[(-1,), (0,), (1,)]
sage: list(Ip)
[(-1,), (0,), (1,)]
sage: list(Ip)
[]
```
This could potentially cause subtle changes in behavior. Granted, an object that wants it to behave like a parent should be a `cartesian_product`. All of your changes here look good (I know it is not yet ready for review), but I am just giving a slight bit of caution with the deprecation.

Digressing, it can be interesting when we dig into code like this that we find things like

```diff
-g = [[] for _ in itertools.repeat(None, len(m))]
+g = [[] for _ in range(len(m))]
```

```diff
-alpha = sum([True for x in itertools.product(range(4), repeat=j_form.dim()) if j_form(x) == 0])
+alpha = sum(1 for x in itertools.product(range(4), repeat=j_form.dim()) if j_form(x) == 0)
```
that could be improved.
