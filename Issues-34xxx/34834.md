Let `\Fq` be a finite field and `K` be an `\Fq[X]`-field. Let `\phi` be a Drinfeld `\Fq[X]`-module over `K`. We denote `\mathcal{M}(\phi)` to be the ring `K\{\tau\}`endowed with the `\Fq[X]`-module law `(P, f) \mapsto f \phi_P`. We call it the *motive* associate to `\phi`. A Drinfeld module isogeny `u: \phi \to \psi` gives rise to an `\Fq[X]`-module morphism `\mathcal{M}(u): \mathcal{E}(\psi) \to \mathcal{M}(\phi)`; `\mathcal{M}` is a contravariant foncctor.

We propose to create a class `DrinfeldModuleMotive` that is a parent representing `\mathcal{M}(\phi)` and whose elements — instances of `DrinfeldModuleMotiveElement` — are elements of `\mathcal{M}(\phi)`. We would define the action of `\Fq[X]` on those elements. We would also create a class `DrinfeldModuleMotiveMorphism` to represent the morphism `\mathcal{M}(u)`. 

The motive `\mathcal{M}(\phi)` is a free `\Fq[X] \otimes_\Fq K`-tensor whose basis is `(1, \tau, \dots, \tau^{r-1})`, `r` being the rank of the Drinfeld module.

```
sage: # phi is a Drinfeld Fq[X]-module over K
sage: motive = phi.motive()  # Get the motive associated to phi
sage: f = phi(X)
sage: f
t^2 + t + a   
sage: motive(f)
(t^2 + t + a) * m_phi
sage: motive.basis()
(1, t)
sage: motive(f).coordinates()
(X, 0)
```

The motive is a dual of the module associated to a Drinfeld module (ticket #34833) but the two constructions are independent. We propose to work on those tickets once the main ticket (#33713) is merged.

More generally, we can define an `\Fq[X]`-motive independently of Drinfeld modules. The category of `\Fq[X]`-motives is anti-equivalent to the so-called category of abelian `\Fq[X]`-modules, which contains the category of Drinfeld modules as a full subcategory.

This is part of an ongoing work with Xavier Caruso.

Depends on #33713
