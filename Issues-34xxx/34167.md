 In this tutorial, we show how to construct and manipulate free modules

```

`git grep MODULEAUTHOR` shows that it is used in a number of other files and is also documented in the developer guide.

Should we remove it from the developer guide?

Or should we add it to the directives known to the linter?

I agree.

On the other hand, I did try to find the conflicting ticket and found that it is #22349. It is tedious to do this manually. It would be useful if we have the command `git trac merge 31049 32088 ... 34165` that stops at the ticket that has a merge conflict. Moreover the merge conflict message from the release manager could be so that we can just copy and paste the command.
