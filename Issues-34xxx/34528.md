We move the details regarding required compilers, binutils, etc. from the installation manual to the respective SPKG.rst files (except for the `tk` stuff, for which we don't have a package - #31206). Most users who install from source do not need this level of detail.

This change will give the simple installation instructions (with prepared package installation commands) more prominence.

I think you missed the paragraph leading to the section with these long generated command-lines:

```
+The following sections provide the commands to install a large
+recommended set of packages on various systems, which will minimize
+the time it takes to build Sage. This is intended as a convenient
+shortcut, but of course you can choose to take a more fine-grained
+approach.
```
