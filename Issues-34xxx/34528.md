We move the details regarding required compilers, binutils, etc. from the installation manual to the respective SPKG.rst files (except for the `tk` stuff, for which we don't have a package - #31206). Most users who install from source do not need this level of detail.

This change will give the simple installation instructions (with prepared package installation commands) more prominence.

If you wish to do Sage development, we recommend that you additionally install the following:

sudo apt-get install  autoconf automake git gpgconf libtool openssh openssh-client pkg-config
```

Is this not misleading now? If I'm not mistaken without e.g. autoconf or automake even the bootstrap command will fail. So these tools are a hard requirement and not a recommendation, right?

My understanding is that you only need to use the bootstrap command if you are testing new packages. If you are working solely within the Sage library, you shouldn't need it.
