We move the details regarding required compilers, binutils, etc. from the installation manual to the respective SPKG.rst files (except for the `tk` stuff, for which we don't have a package - #31206). Most users who install from source do not need this level of detail.

This change will give the simple installation instructions (with prepared package installation commands) more prominence.
