with Sage 9.5:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(next_prime(2^31))[]
sage: (x+y).resultant(x-y,x)
...
TypeError: Singular error:
   ? Wrong or unknown ground field specification
   ? cannot make ring
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 16: `ring sage9=2147483659,(x, y),dp;`
   ? expected ring-expression. type 'help ring;'
```
With previous_prime(2<sup>31</sup>) instead, we get a NotImplementedError error.
