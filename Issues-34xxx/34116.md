Sorry for losing track of this. I think we should error out if the RHS has degree > 0 rather than silently returning a wrong answer. The current behavior is to error out:

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: 1 + x // (1 + 2*x)
[snip]
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for //: 'Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field' and 'Power Series Ring in x over Rational Field'
```

A "better" way to do this IMO would be to implement this as an action of the base ring. This is faster as it would bypass the temporary object created by the coercion and it would continue to not work for any FPS.

Thanks for the feedback.

As my rough proposal goes through coercion, raising an error would require to check if the coerced element comes from the base ring, which seems very ugly..

I would be happy to see any better solution. I have zero experience about actions, so it will not be easy for me to implement what you suggest. Also, does it make sense to implement a "division" as an action?

Using a different machine has worked. Still don't know, why pushing to trac doesn't work, but github is fine.

Thank you for doing this. This is roughly what I was thinking, but I have changed it into an explicit action class. I also fixed a bug where it was not allowing for things that also coerce into the base ring.

@kliem I am not quite sure what you are worried about, but it sounds like you want things to magically work without having to implement them. What I mean is if you have a different ring with a different action, it will need to be implemented by someone. I think we can easily revisit this.

You have already solved the problem by the explicit action class. I wasn't aware that this exists.

The problem with `_acted_upon_` is that in only allows one action from `A` on `B`. E.g. we would have fixed that `ZZ` acts on `ZZ[This is the Trac macro *'x'* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#'x'-macro)` always be floor division (and not by any other operation).
