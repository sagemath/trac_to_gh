A better fix for upstream is probably to set `threadsizemax` to a good multiple of `parisize`.

Is there a public repo of giac where to follow the code? A place to report bugs or make PR? I still have to apply a few more patches for the voidlinux pkg, it would be nice if those could be upstreamed (please ping me for more info).

<a id='comment:31'></a>This is a bit silly but easy to overlook when not paying attention. 

`@`parisse your trick to ship fltk internally has a serious shortcomings. From `configure.ac`

```
	dnl force FLTK static compilation if FLTK not present
	AC_CHECK_HEADERS(FL/Fl.H,[],[tar xfj fltk-1.3.8-source.tar.bz2 ; cd fltk-1.3.8 && ./configure --disable-shared && make && cd .. && CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -I../fltk-1.3.8" && LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L../fltk-1.3.8/lib"] ) 
	dnl X11, check for opengl, fltk
	AC_CHECK_LIB(X11,main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(Xinerama, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(fontconfig, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(Xft, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(Xext, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(Xrender, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(fltk_gl, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(fltk, main)
	if test "$HAVE_LIBFLTK" = "1"; then
	   AC_DEFINE([HAVE_LIBFLVW],1, [Now defined if fltk is available])
	fi
	AC_CHECK_LIB(z,main)
	AC_CHECK_HEADERS(png.h, AC_CHECK_LIB(png,main))
	AC_CHECK_LIB(jpeg, main)
	AC_CHECK_LIB(fltk_images, main)
	FLTK_LIBS="$LIBS $X_LIBS"
	AC_SUBST(FLTK_LIBS)
```
At the end of the day I found that `config.h` was listing `HAVE_LIBFLTK` as undefined, which in turn means that inclusion of fltk headers in `Xcas1.cc`, where we see the failure is not happening because there is still a guard `ifdef HAVE_LIBFLTK` - which should go if fltk is mandatory (and it really is).

But let's figure why it happens. So, inspection of `config.log`

```
configure:21818: checking for main in -lfltk
configure:21840: g++ -std=c++14 -o conftest -g -O2 -I../fltk-1.3.8   -L../fltk-1.3.8/lib conftest.cpp -lfltk  -lXrender -lXext -lXft -lfontconfig -lXinerama -lX11 -lGL -lcurl -lglpk -lao -ldl -lpng16 -lm -lecm -lmpfi -lmpfr -lgmp  >&5
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/12/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -lfltk
```
Well, `-I../fltk-1.3.8` and `-L../fltk-1.3.8/lib` will work very well once you go to the subfolder `src`, but it doesn't from the top level source directory from which `configure` is run. In effect, you probably want to replace `../fltk-1.3.8` by something that does `${srcdir}/fltk-1.3.8` which would be an absolute path that would be right in both cases.
