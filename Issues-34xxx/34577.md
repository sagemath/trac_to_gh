These warnings appear with the latest version of OS X. We suppressed them in doctesting in #34533, but they also appear when building many parts of the Sage library. We should fix them.

Depends on #33680

A few comments:

- `git grep "dynamic_lookup"` didn't reveal much: we are not explicitly introducing the flag `--undefined dynamic_lookup`.
- If I search the log files for the warning, it seems to come up in Python-related packages. This is the list I see:

```
argon2_cffi-20.1.0.log
cffi-1.15.0.log
cvxopt-1.3.0.log
cypari-2.1.2.log
cysignals-1.11.2.log
cython-0.29.32.p1.log
fonttools-4.28.4.log
fpylll-0.5.7.log
gmpy2-2.1.1.log
iml-1.0.4p2.p2.log
kiwisolver-1.3.2.log
lrcalc_python-2.1.log
markupsafe-2.1.1.log

```
 Python may be setting this flag. I thought I had read somewhere that Python packages were supposed to use this flag on OS X, but now I can't find it.
- [Emacs developers](https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=57849) are also seeing this warning, in case their discussion sheds light for anyone else (it didn't for me).

I don't know if the right thing to do is to eliminate the flag `--undefined dynamic_lookup`, but it does seem to be set by Python. If I force Sage to build its own Python, then I get

```
% grep -I -l -R "undefined.*dynamic_lookup" venv/

venv//lib/python3.10/distutils/spawn.py

venv//lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools/_distutils/util.py
venv//lib/python3.10/config-3.10-darwin/Makefile
```
and many of those look potentially relevant. Presumably the system-version of Python has something similar.
