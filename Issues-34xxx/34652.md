This is extracted from #16522.

One issue raised on that ticket is that it is problematic to use lazy imports on things other than a function (stated in [#16522 comment:20](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/16522#comment:20)). It appears that using honest imports rather than lazy ones for `NN` should not cause too much of a slowdown, but this needs to be tested.

Mathematically there is an obvious connection between `sage/sets/non_negative_integers.py` and `sage/rings/semirings/non_negative_integer_semiring.py`, but from the code point of view, I don't see why this change causes this warning.

Replying to [John Palmieri](#comment%3A2):
> Mathematically there is an obvious connection between `sage/sets/non_negative_integers.py` and `sage/rings/semirings/non_negative_integer_semiring.py`, but from the code point of view, I don't see why this change causes this warning.

The line in `non_negative_integer_semiring.py`:

```
from sage.sets.non_negative_integers import NonNegativeIntegers
```
probably explains the link.

The semiring class inherits from it and the `__init__` chains to it. So that's a programmatic link. Apparently, something in the category framework for `FacadeSets` lazy-imports these and the initialization of `NN` triggers the resolution; now prior to conclusion of start-up. So that suggests there's a further lazy import that should be scuttled, because it now gets resolved upon startup anyway. I think that was the costly bit before, but by the looks of it the cost may not be so high anymore. Python's import framework has improved over the years, if I'm not mistaken and/or you've tested on a filesystem that has very little overhead when warmed up.

in fact, as far as I can find, it happens in `sets_cat.py` in `class Sets(Category_singleton)`; line 1882. There's a whole bunch of class-namespace-level `LazyImport`s there; some of them marked `at_startup`, which should silence the warning. You might want to double-check why those are lazy: is it to solve some otherwise circular import problem?

I suspect the trigger that actually resolves the lazy shim here is `self._with_axiom('Facade')`, which is probably executed somewhere in creating the category for `NN` or the semiring. If I recall correctly, this is one of the points where the category framework really ceases to by Python and instead is some other kind of programming language bolted onto Python infrastructure. It's certainly the kind of shenanigans that makes me never want to get near it.

Nils, thanks for the pointer to the lines in `sets_cat.py`. Changing those fixed the problem.

Here's a branch. I'm at home working on a slower machine, and I don't see any differences in startup time between this and my `develop` branch. I made limited changes here, focusing almost completely on `NN`. Other lazy import issues should be handled on other tickets.

Tests might pass, although I just upgraded to the latest MacOS so I am seeing failures. They should be unrelated to these changes. Please test it.

However, I wouldn't like to do the same change with metric_spaces.
