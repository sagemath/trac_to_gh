You inserted an additional blank line between function definitions. What is the rationale of this change? The rule is one blank line around function definitions and double blank lines around class definitons. No?

I do not object to the two blank lines here. But I am just curious if there is a rule that I do not know.

Okay. I found `Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.` in PEP8, which seems the origin of `E302` and `E305`.
