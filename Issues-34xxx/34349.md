The following issue kept coming (after double checking that I had the packages installed as described).

```
checking that generated files are newer than configure... done
configure: creating ./config.status
configure:

    notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:

        fflas_ffpack fplll givaro linbox lrcalc primecount qhull 4ti2 coxeter3 libsemigroups polymake _recommended
        
checking for the package system in use... debian
configure:

    hint: installing the following system packages, if not
    already present, is recommended and may avoid having to
    build them (though some may have to be built anyway):

      $ sudo apt-get update 
      $ sudo apt-get install  fflas-ffpack libfplll-dev libgivaro-dev liblinbox-dev liblrcalc-dev libqhull-dev

configure:

    hint: installing the following system packages, if not
    already present, may provide additional optional features:

      $ sudo apt-get update 
      $ sudo apt-get install  4ti2 polymake libpolymake-dev default-jdk libavdevice-dev
```

Thanks for the report!

Our suggestion mechanism is not perfect.

The phrasing ("if not already present", "may")
tries to convey that.

Propose to close as wontfix, unless someone
can suggest a concrete improvement.
