As reported in [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/D4jOrvAyyj8/m/yL9YEsE5GAAJ):

The `quo_rem` method for polynomials with quaternionic coefficients outputs incorrect results. Moreover, there is no way to specify whether we want a right or left division. Here is a specific example.

```
# Take the quaternion algebra (-1, -1)_QQ and the ring of polynomials over it:
HH = QuaternionAlgebra(QQ, -1, -1)
P.<x> = HH[]
# Take two polynomials
f = x^3 + HH.0*x + (HH.1 + 2*HH.2); print("f =", f)
g = HH.2*x + HH.1 + 3; print("g =", g)
# Try to compute the quotient and remainder
q, r = f.quo_rem(g)
# Check the correctness of the result assuming that this is RIGHT division
print(q*g + r == f)
# Check the correctness of the result assuming that this is LEFT division
print(g*q + r == f)
```

Both tests output False. Tested on Sage 9.5.

Mathematical background: the division with the remainder for polynomials over division rings is well known and fully described e.g. in [1] even in a more general setting when the variable does not commute with the coefficients (in our case it does commute). So it is just a matter of proper implementation.

The bug was that the multiplication by `y` and the multiplication by its inverse (`inv`) were not both on the same side.

Allowing the user to choose whether to have a left quotient or right quotient would be a bit more involved. (Adding a keyword argument for this would make the signature of this method incompatible with other implementations of `quo_rem`.) So I would like to leave this potential enhancement to a follow-up ticket.
