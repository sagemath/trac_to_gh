The decision whether a Stream_XXX class uses a dense or a sparse cache should not depend on the input streams.

For example, for `Stream_add` it is actually irrelevant whether the input streams left and right are dense or sparse.

For `Stream_zero` and `Stream_exact`, a separate cache never makes sense.

This also makes the need to implement a conversion between sparse and dense less important.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:8'></a>\nFrom #34611: it may make sense to make `Stream_uninitialized` always dense, and doctest that the following then works:\n\n```\nsage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ); C = L.undefined(); C.define(1 + z*C^2)\nsage: C[500]\n```\n\nAnother question: it may make sense to make `Stream_XXX` always sparse, if the computation of `s[n]` *obviously* does not benefit from the values of `s[n-1], s[n-2], ...`.  This is the case, for example, with `Stream_add`.\n\nThe benefit of a dense representation of `Stream_add` may be in storage and access: if we have a sparse representation and have to compute most values, the list representation uses (much) less memory, and access will be faster. For example, storing the first 600 values of a stream of integers as a list uses no more memory than storing 200 values in a dict.

From #34611: it may make sense to make `Stream_uninitialized` always dense, and doctest that the following then works:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ); C = L.undefined(); C.define(1 + z*C^2)
sage: C[500]
```

Another question: it may make sense to make `Stream_XXX` always sparse, if the computation of `s[n]` *obviously* does not benefit from the values of `s[n-1], s[n-2], ...`.  This is the case, for example, with `Stream_add`.

The benefit of a dense representation of `Stream_add` may be in storage and access: if we have a sparse representation and have to compute most values, the list representation uses (much) less memory, and access will be faster. For example, storing the first 600 values of a stream of integers as a list uses no more memory than storing 200 values in a dict.  Lookup in a list of about 1000 elements seems to take about 60%-70% of the time lookup in a dictionary takes.

In cases when we apply a very simple function to each coefficient, as in `Stream_neg`, we may not want to create a separate cache at all.  For `Stream_map_coefficients`, we currently only apply very costly functions.

You’re right; for multiplication, we should have both a sparse and dense version.

Ah, right, we don’t store the polynomials themselves in the `Stream_exact`, although there can be uses for passing the sparsity to that. I don’t remember if we implement both types of exact storage. Perhaps we should, in case someone wants to create x<sup>10000</sup>.

I am mostly wondering how much we should drop within the streams to carry around the `_sparse` parameter altogether. The multiplication will likely be split into 2 classes (with not being too lazy with the dense multiplication); the rest, except possibly the exact, are all naturally either dense (e.g., inverse) or sparse (e.g., addition).

I will have to look at the code we currently have more closely I think to get a more clear picture. I don’t remember some of the details regarding this. Perhaps you already have a clear picture about this though.

Creating z<sup>10000</sup> is not a problem:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: f = z^100000
sage: f._coeff_stream.__dict__
{'_constant': 0,
 '_degree': 100001,
 '_initial_coefficients': (1,),
 '_true_order': True,
 '_approximate_order': 100000}
```
however, z<sup>100000</sup>-1 is:

```
sage: f = z^10 - 1
sage: f._coeff_stream.__dict__
{'_constant': 0,
 '_degree': 11,
 '_initial_coefficients': (-1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1),
 '_true_order': True,
 '_approximate_order': 0}
```

Curiously, it takes a very long time to create, all of which is spent in the polynomial exponentiation - this is, because the underlying polynomial ring, for some reason is always dense:

```python
class LazyLaurentSeriesRing(LazySeriesRing):
    def __init__(self, base_ring, names, sparse=True, category=None):
        self._sparse = sparse
        # We always use the dense because our CS_exact is implemented densely
        self._laurent_poly_ring = LaurentPolynomialRing(base_ring, names)
        self._internal_poly_ring = self._laurent_poly_ring
```

There are actually two easy improvements:

* a sparse version, so we can create 1 + x<sup>100000000</sup>
* I think that the polynomial ring should be dense or sparse depending on our input

and, orthogonal to this,

* a lazy version of `Stream_exact`, with coefficients provided by a function, might also help with the problem of computing large powers or large compositions of exact series.

I can imagine that having only sparse addition is bad.  I can try to create an example if you want.

What I'd be interested in is some help with van der Hoeven's algorithm in #34616.
