Discussed
on [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/WVMuik1TICg)
and [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/j6NWgHWrUf0).

There is a coercion bug that causes the example:

```
H = PermutationGroup([ [(1,2), (3,4)], [(5,6,7),(12,14,18)] ])
kH = H.algebra(GF(2))
[a, b] = H.gens()
x = kH(a) + kH(b) + kH.one(); print(x)
x*x
```
to fail. It does not recognize in the coercion that the parents of the indexing elements should be the same.

I am pretty certain this is not the correct fix. The underlying issue comes from the fact that `PermutationGroup` is a `CachedRepresentation`, but not a `UniqueRepresentation` (nor should it be because equality is as as isomorphic groups). In particular, it comes from this:

```
sage: kH.group() == H
True
sage: kH.group() is H
False
sage: kH(a).leading_support().parent() is H
True
sage: kH(a).leading_support().parent() is kH.group()
False
```
IMO, it is luck that this makes the code work. The issue is that the coercion `H -> G -> kG`, where `G = kG.group()` and `H` is any group with a coercion into `G`, does not actually convert the basis index to an element of `G` like it should. Instead, I think we should change the `GroupAlgebra._coerce_map_from_` to something like

```diff
         G = self.basis().keys()
         K = self.base_ring()
 
+        G_coercion = G.coerce_map_from(S)
-        if G.has_coerce_map_from(S):
+        if G_coercion is not None:
             from sage.categories.groups import Groups
             # No coercion for additive groups because of ambiguity of +
             #   being the group action or addition of a new term.
-            return self.category().is_subcategory(Groups().Algebras(K))
+            if not self.category().is_subcategory(Groups().Algebras(K)):
+                return None
+            if S is G:
+                return True
+            return self.coerce_map_from(G) * G_coercion
 
         if S in Sets.Algebras:
             S_K = S.base_ring()
             S_G = S.basis().keys()
             hom_K = K.coerce_map_from(S_K)
             hom_G = G.coerce_map_from(S_G)
             if hom_K is not None and hom_G is not None:
                 return SetMorphism(S.Hom(self, category=self.category() | S.category()),
                                    lambda x: self.sum_of_terms( (hom_G(g), hom_K(c)) for g,c in x ))
```

Unfortunately, this does not solve the problem. There is an even deeper issue:

```
sage: kH.group()(a)
(5,6,7)(12,14,18)
sage: _.parent() is kH.group()
False
sage: kH.group()._element_constructor_(a).parent() is kH.group()
True
```
So we see it is getting short-circuited by the coercion system because of equal-but-not-identical-parents. Indeed, this is matched by the coercion map:

```
sage: phi = kH.group().coerce_map_from(H)
sage: phi(a)
(5,6,7)(12,14,18)
sage: phi(a).parent() is H
True
sage: phi(a).parent() is kH.group()  # Should be True
False
sage: phi._call_(a).parent() is H  # Should be False
True
sage: phi.codomain()._element_constructor_(a).parent() is H  # Should be False
True
sage: phi.codomain() is H
False
sage: phi.codomain() is kH.group()
True
```
We see a very subtle distinction:

```
sage: kH.group()._element_constructor_(a).parent() is kH.group()
True
sage: kH.group()._element_constructor(a).parent() is kH.group()
False
```
This lead me through the `UniqueRepresentation` framework, but that was a dead-end. Next, I went to `H.basis()`, which the lazy family has one seemingly innocuous line, but it shows the issue:

```
sage: Hp = copy(H)
sage: Hp._element_constructor(a).parent() is Hp
False
```
The default implementation uses `__reduce__`, which stores the `__dict__`, which contains the `_element_constructor` attribute, which points to the **original** group `H`. This is the bug!

My proposal to fix this is have `copy(H) is H` (and `deepcopy`) since the permutation group is immutable. Adding

```
    def __copy__(self):
        return self

    __deepcopy__ = __copy__
```
to `sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup.PermutationGroup_generic` fixed the issue in the ticket description for me (without the above change to the coerce map, but I still think we should do that as it would be a general improvement).

After making the change to `GroupAlgebra_class._coerce_map_from` as you suggested, I get the following doctest failure in `group_algebras.py`:

```
File "src/sage/algebras/group_algebra.py", line 158, in sage.algebras.group_algebra.GroupAlgebra_class._coerce_map_from_
Failed example:
    ZG.coerce_map_from(H)
Expected:
    Coercion map:
      From: Cyclic group of order 3 as a permutation group
      To:   Algebra of Dihedral group of order 6 as a permutation group over Integer Ring
Got:
    Composite map:
      From: Cyclic group of order 3 as a permutation group
      To:   Algebra of Dihedral group of order 6 as a permutation group over Integer Ring
      Defn:   Coercion map:
              From: Cyclic group of order 3 as a permutation group
              To:   Dihedral group of order 6 as a permutation group
            then
              Coercion map:
              From: Dihedral group of order 6 as a permutation group
              To:   Algebra of Dihedral group of order 6 as a permutation group over Integer Ring
```

I think this makes sense given the change you propose and seems mathematically correct, so I am inclined to change the doctest to the `Got:`, but want to confirm that this is right.

That is correct. While it seems like it adds an extra layer of indirection, it avoids a second call to the coercion system.
