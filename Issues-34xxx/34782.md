This patch adds a method `.twists()` to elliptic curves over finite fields `k`, which computes a set of `k`-isomorphism representatives of the `K`-isomorphism class where `K` is the algebraic closure of `k`.

This can be useful, for instance, to compute a list of all elliptic curves defined over `k` up to `k`-isomorphism:

```sage
def all_curves(F):
    return [E for j in F for E in EllipticCurve(j=j).twists()]
```
