The first two blocks works without any problem

```
E = EllipticCurve("19a1")
P = E(5,9)
E.tangent_line(P)
```
and

```
E = EllipticCurve("19a1")
K.<w> = CyclotomicField(3)
EK = E.base_extend(K)
P = EK(5,9)
EK.tangent_line(P)
```
Instead the following, just renaming the generator of the field, goes boom

```
E = EllipticCurve("19a1")
K.<z> = CyclotomicField(3)
EK = E.base_extend(K)
P = EK(5,9)
EK.tangent_line(P)
```
The error messages returned is

```
TypeError: Coordinates [9/5, 1/5] do not define a point
on Affine Plane Curve over Cyclotomic Field of order 3
and degree 2 defined by z*y^2 + (-z - 1)*y + (-10*z + 5)
```
raised by line 984 in schemes/generic/algebraic_scheme.py.
