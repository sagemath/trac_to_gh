This bug

```
sage: R = Integers(8)
sage: RXY.<X,Y> = R[]
sage: F = X^3*Y
sage: F.subs({X:1})
Y
sage: F.subs({X:2})  # should be 0!
Y
```
is fixed by #34417. However while fixing the bug, it was noticed that the code of `.subs()` is so convoluted that the code is hard to read and inefficient.

So in this ticket, we refactor the code. The modified code is shorter, simpler, and seems slightly faster. 

Moreover the patch also fixes the original bug without #34417 (upstream patch)!

Before the patch:

```sage
sage: R = Integers(8)
sage: RXY.<X,Y> = R[]
sage: F = X^3*Y
sage: F.subs({X:2})
Y
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.41 ms per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.39 ms per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.41 ms per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.46 ms per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.38 ms per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.26 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.36 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.65 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.21 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.09 μs per loop
```
After the patch 

```sage
sage: R = Integers(8)
sage: RXY.<X,Y> = R[]
sage: F = X^3*Y
sage: F.subs({X:2})
0
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.11 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.8 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.63 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.52 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.63 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.18 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 7.99 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.25 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.2 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.6 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.38 μs per loop
```
