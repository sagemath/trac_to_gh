This bug

```
sage: R = Integers(8)
sage: RXY.<X,Y> = R[]
sage: F = X^3*Y
sage: F.subs({X:1})
Y
sage: F.subs({X:2})  # should be 0!
Y
```
is fixed by #34417. However while fixing the bug, it was noticed that the code of `.subs()` is so convoluted that the code is hard to read and inefficient.

So in this ticket, we refactor the code. The modified code is shorter, simpler, and seems slightly faster. 

Moreover the patch also fixes the original bug without #34417 (upstream patch)!

Before the patch:

```sage
sage: R = Integers(8)
sage: RXY.<X,Y> = R[]
sage: F = X^3*Y
sage: F.subs({X:2})
Y
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.41 ms per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.39 ms per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.41 ms per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.46 ms per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
125 loops, best of 3: 3.38 ms per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.26 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.36 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.65 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.21 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.09 μs per loop
```
After the patch 

```sage
sage: R = Integers(8)
sage: RXY.<X,Y> = R[]
sage: F = X^3*Y
sage: F.subs({X:2})
0
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.11 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.8 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.63 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.52 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:2})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.63 μs per loop

625 loops, best of 3: 7.99 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.25 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.2 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.6 μs per loop
sage: timeit('F.subs({X:1})')
625 loops, best of 3: 8.38 μs per loop
```

At line 3557, the substituted polynomial becomes 0 correctly. But then it goes on "try_symbolic". Why?

You are right.

But there still seems to be a different issue with `.subs()`. I am investigating.
