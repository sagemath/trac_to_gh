since `cddlib`'s version `094k`, its headers are put into `cddlib/`.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

In fact, Debian is OK:
https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/libcdd-dev/filelist

shows that /usr/include/cdd is a link to /usr/include/cddlib, and the latter contains all the files.

Let's close this as invalid.
