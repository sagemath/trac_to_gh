since `cddlib`'s version `094k`, its headers are put into `cddlib/`.

But Debian renames it to `cdd/`. This needs further work on `spkg-configure.m4` of `cddlib`

<a id='comment:1'></a>In fact, Debian is OK:
https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/libcdd-dev/filelist

shows that /usr/include/cdd is a link to /usr/include/cddlib, and the latter contains all the files.

Let's close this as invalid.
