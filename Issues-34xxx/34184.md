Looks good. You could add the following code that exists in the from_lehmer_code function to take care of the case where it's an empty permutation:

    if parent is None:
        parent = Permutations()
    return parent(p)

After you add that, you could move the status to 'needs review' and someone could review it. (I don't have a working development version of Sage at the moment, so I can't do a full review.)

```diff
-    lehmer.reverse()
-    open_spots = list(range(1,len(lehmer)+1))
-    for ivi in lehmer:
-        p.append(open_spots.pop(len(lehmer)-i-ivi))

         i += 1
