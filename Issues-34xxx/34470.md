We should check the categories of our lazy rings:

```
sage: L = LazyTaylorSeriesRing(QQ, "x, y") ; L in DiscreteValuationRings
True
sage: L in PrincipalIdealDomains
True
```
is wrong.  It is not even a 'valuation ring' , see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_ring, because neither `x/y` not `y/x` is in `L`.  I doubt it should be in `UniqueFactorizationDomains`, because this category is reserved for constructive UFD's.

In the univariate case, the uniformizer is the generator "x", but this is not yet implemented:

```
sage: L = LazyTaylorSeriesRing(QQ, "x")
sage: L.uniformizer()
...
NotImplementedError: <abstract method uniformizer at 0x7ff26e85acb0>
```

Similarly, we have

```
sage: LazySymmetricFunctions(SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()) in DiscreteValuationRings
True
sage: LazySymmetricFunctions(SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()) in PrincipalIdealDomains
True
```
which is also wrong.

Depends on #32367

Indeed, a valuation ring is not simply the ring version of a valuation field.

Something in UFDs does not need to be constructive, although it does make it somewhat useless to be in that category. I cannot seem to find much of anything on factoring multivariate FPS. I suspect we can do something recursive and take advantage of the group of units being so large. Although I don’t know of a way to do this after thinking about it for the past 20 minutes. However, it is known to be a UFD (with finitely many products?).

Shouldn't all of these actually be in `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis`?  I have no idea what the consequences might be.  However, it might be nice if, for any element of an integer graded algebra, `__getitem__` would be defined as we just did for `LazyModuleElement`.  I'd love to be able to type

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: f = s[2,1]*(s[1]+s[2]+s[3]+s[4])
sage: f[::2]
[s[2, 1, 1] + s[2, 2] + s[3, 1], s[3, 2, 1] + s[4, 1, 1] + s[4, 2] + s[5, 1]]
```
instead of a clumsy list with `restrict_degree`.  More importantly, I'd love to know that this is uniform across graded algebras.

This I agree with overall, but Matthias made a good point that most of the default evaluation morphisms would not be as rings but as graded algebras, which have quite strong restrictions. There are ways around this for various special cases, but `Hom(R, S)` would still not default to the set of ring homomorphism, which would be strange for nearly all of commutative algebra. However, it should be allowed to be in `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis()` and work.

For the lazy graded algebras, that definitely should be in there.

Strong -1 on this for graded algebras in general because in CFM elements, `f[i]` should get the coefficient with index `i`. What happens when the indexing set contains integers? Slices also don’t make sense. Furthermore, implementations should be allowed to implement their own version of `__getitem__`, which might be useful for them.

We can support that for the lazy graded algebras, although from the above, it creates the same tension with something that should, generically speaking, act like the underlying algebra element. There is some justification for allowing the difference since the user should be aware that it is a completely different type. I didn’t quite think this through so thoroughly when we were first doing this… I see this as a judgement call with which behavior would be better to support, and I don’t have too strong of an opinion either way. (I might even be a bit contrarian either way you chose to make sure the choice is sound, but quite likely not.)

Somewhat related: There was an agreement to explicitly move away from allowing slices for (univariate) polynomials.

OK, too bad.  I could not think of a sensible example where the indices are integers, but I agree that there might be.

Could we at least have it for symmetric functions and similar stuff, interpreting integer and slice arguments as specifying degrees, and all the rest as indices?  And, perhaps more importantly, for polynomials?

> Somewhat related: There was an agreement to explicitly move away from allowing slices for (univariate) polynomials.


Yes, I find that this is a very impractical decision for me, because I work a lot with coefficients, and I keep forgetting how to obtain them.  Doing `list(p)[:5]` seems extremely unintuitive for me.

Remembering stuff is even harder when implementations of basic functions are so different:

```
sage: R.<s,t> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ); R
Multivariate Power Series Ring in s, t over Integer Ring
sage: f = 1 + t + s + s*t + R.O(3)
sage: f.coefficients()
{1: 1, s: 1, t: 1, s*t: 1}
```

The free monoid/group with one generator comes to mind. The exterior algebra is another if we realize subsets as binary representation of integers (this was originally the GSoC project Trevor was working on until we found it better to continue working with subsets through a different implementation).

> Could we at least have it for symmetric functions and similar stuff, interpreting integer and slice arguments as specifying degrees, and all the rest as indices?  And, perhaps more importantly, for polynomials?


I am a -1 on doing it for symmetric functions as they are not grouped together by degree like how the implementation is here. I also don’t like such a special case. In principle, considering the input `f = s[2]`, the result of `f[2]` could support `1` and not `0`. It doesn’t because it does not automatically cast the input.

Ouch, that is a bit unfortunate. It is generally a good thing to make the API uniform for these things.

OK, we disagree slightly. I guess there is nothing we can do about it, so let it be.

Just a few minor observations:

* Note that currently, `__getitem__` of symmetric functions returns 0 when given an integer.

* For lazy series, `homogeneous_component` would just be yet another alias for `__getitem__`.

* Also, for a lazy series `s` we cannot do `list(s)[a:b:c]`.  For power (Taylor) series, we could in principle do `lazy_list(s)`, once `lazy_list` is imported, but for `LazyLaurentSeries` this does not work, because it would begin with degree 0.

In summary:

The fundamental problem I see is that there may be ZZ-graded algebras where the index set is a subset of the integers, but the degree is something else.  I agree that this is a problem.  I disagree that this is a problem for symmetric functions.  The current behaviour of `f[i]` for a symmetric function `f` and an integer `i` is even more surprising but nobody has complained about it so far.

Indeed, it also returns `0` for things like `x[2,1]` for `x = s[2,1]` because it doesn’t actually convert things to a partition to check it.

That is fine (and even desirable) since it would make it compatible with other graded algebras (with basis).

This is a good argument for adding functionality on top of those for the corresponding polynomial ring for at least the lazy Laurent )and Dirichlet) series. This would also be consistent with iteration over the elements too.

It is initially surprising. Yet, you already have to know it is a way to pull coefficients of an indexed element, which means you should know it is not a partition that you are passing. Thus, with a moment of thought, it is consistent behavior (as the coefficient of the integer `i` is clearly `0`).

Yes, provided that `__getitem__` does not provide this functionality.

Let me stress that for my daily experimental work with sage, aliases are a major problem, because they are listed in the tab completion just as any other method.  They even appear twice in the documentation.  It happens very frequently that I am looking for a particular functionality, and cannot find it, so I page through the tab completion.  As an example, for SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s(), this list has currently 148 elements, even if I remove the underscore methods.

'' (if you happen to know how to make emacs and sage-shell-mode (optionally) omit the underscore methods, please let me know)

Again, this is a major problem for me.

Related to this, less severe, is that tab-completion stops working after methods.  So I have to assign names to things, and in the end I am surprised because I accidentally used the same name in a computation for two different things.

I don't understand your proposal here?  How would `lazy_list(s)` know the valuation?

> There also is an issue for non-graded bases behaving very differently than the graded ones.


Hm, I don't see that: my proposal (modulo the fundamental problem of integer indices, which probably kills the proposal anyway) is exclusively for algebras with a ZZ-grading.

It is actually a bit strange that we do not include the `x^n` in the `__getitem__` `LazyLaurentSeries`, univariate `LazyPowerSeries` and `LazyDirichletSeries`.

Similarly,

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: L = LazySymmetricFunctions(s)
sage: (s[2,1]*s[2,1])[Partition([3,2,1])]
2
sage: L(s[2,1]*s[2,1])[Partition([3,2,1])]
TypeError
```
is actually quite inconsistent.

So, how about turning things around and make `__getitem__` consistently pick out a single coefficient (no idea how to do this with multivariate polynomials, though), and improve `restrict_degree` and `homogeneous_parts` to give us the other thing.

Of course, this is a bit impractical, because for univariate power series I am not interested at all in the `x^n`, wheras for multivariate power series, I am only interested in the full graded piece.

I just realised that I am confusing two different instances of `__getitem__`:

* `SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s().__getitem__`, and

* `SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s().an_element().__getitem__`.

Clearly, the first one should only take partitions.

However, for the second, it might actually be *more* consistent, to only take integers and slices.

I am focusing on just the symmetric function part now. The ring of symmetric functions has a ZZ-grading, but not every basis consists of homogeneous elements (i.e., is naturally ZZ-graded). What should I expect if I use a basis such as `g[la] = s[la] + lower deg terms`? It is a filtered basis of a graded algebra.

In particular, consider `g[i] = s[i]` for all positive integers `i` and `g[1,1] = s[1,1] - s[1]`. Then if `x = g[1,1]`, then the degree 2 homogeneous component of `x` would be `g[1,1] + g[1]`, which would be really strange for `x[2]`. If `x[2] == g[1,1]`, then this would not be compatible with switching to the Schur basis. Or would it simply return `0`? Or raise an error?

NB: Our implementation only works for graded bases.

I miscommunicated.  My problem is when I actually do not know whether some sort of functionality exists.  For example, I'd like to get all elements of a given degree in a multivariate polynomial.  So I do

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]; f = R.an_element(); f.<tab>
```
Now, emacs offers me 97 methods.  Fortunately, I can search in the list of completions, where I find `degree`, `degrees`, `total_degree`, `weighted_degree`.  Those do not fit.  I also notice `truncate`, `monomials`, and so on.  With a lot of luck I will actually find `homogeneous_components`, buried among the other 96 methods.

I am not saying that this can be made much better easily.  However, I am saying that this can be made much worse, by introducing more aliases.  I am guessing that it would be extremely difficult for emacs to detect whether one method is an alias of another.

Why would it be strange for `x[2]` to return `g[1,1] + g[1]`?  

> NB: Our implementation only works for graded bases.


Yes, I can think of some places where things might go wrong.  Do you have an example in sage (or is there an easy way to define a basis) such that I can experiment?

Answering my own question:

```
sage: ht = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).ht()
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: s(ht[2])
-s[1] + s[2]
```
is a basis which is not homogeneous.  I am guessing that there is some trouble here:

```
sage: ht[2].homogeneous_degree()
2
sage: s(ht[2]).homogeneous_degree()
ValueError
sage: (ht[1] + ht[2]).homogeneous_degree()
ValueError
sage: s(ht[1] + ht[2]).homogeneous_degree()

I see. We might need some better class-level documentation or more tutorials. If I couldn’t immediately find it by tab completion, I might then go to the doc for the class and skim through its methods, and then up through the categories. Although I think I quickly realize certain large chunks of the tab completion available methods can be ignored because I know they are not what I want.

> I am not saying that this can be made much better easily.  However, I am saying that this can be made much worse, by introducing more aliases.  I am guessing that it would be extremely difficult for emacs to detect whether one method is an alias of another.


Indeed, we should be careful to not overpopulate any namespace. Yet, we generally cannot keep it so small.

Detecting when a method is an alias of another is easy I think, just check the address of the method:

```
sage: class Foo:
....:     def bar(x):
....:         return x + 5
....:     baz = bar

sage: Foo.bar is Foo.baz
True
```
However, the question is which one to keep. The alias sometimes can be the one you will actually recognize (e.g., same function but different names coming from different fields).

It is returning something that is not obviously homogeneous, and you get more terms than before. I guess for filtered algebras you can make it be “up to degree i,” which is how we define degree for filtered: the smallest filtered piece something belongs to. Although using that, slices do not make sense.

Division is not guaranteed except in `Fields`, so it doesn’t make sense to test it in any more general category. However, I don’t think there are any such tests.

> * implement `some_elements` for the graded completion, and think of better `_an_element` and `some_elements` in general. Currently, most examples are 'exact'.  Why is `an_element` of `ZZ` just `1`, the is not a very typical element.


The result of `an_element()` doesn’t need to be so generic. Beyond an example, it is used by the coercion framework for setting things up via the generic coercion map using `_element_constructor_`.

> * Stream_cauchy_compose and Stream_plethysm have some similarities, maybe we can make them more obvious.


+1 Probably good place for subclassing.

Sounds good overall. I might need to see details before a final verdict, but I think it should be good.

Indeed.

Great! I think this was with exact series in some way. I don’t remember exactly, but I also recall something like that.

One thing I would really like to see is an attempt to make a positive valuation element for `some_elements` of the `LazyCompletionGradedAlgebra`:

```python
it = iter(self._laurent_poly_ring.basis())
extra_elt = sum(b for _ in range(4) if (b := next(it)).degree())
if extra_elt:
    elts.append(extra_elt)
```
Of course, if the graded algebra is "trivial" with everything in degree 0, this won't get anything (or if the first few basis elements are all degree 0). So we just need to protect against that.

Other than that, I think we should bring this these into UFDs where appropriate. That way we signal the correct mathematical information, and the functions that want the constructive behavior will fail with either an `AttributeError` or a `NotImplementedError`.

Actually, FPS in a single variable are a Euclidean domain (see [this MSE post](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3911013/show-that-the-ring-of-formal-power-series-is-a-euclidean-domain)): The Euclidean algorithm uses the valuation and works as follows:

For f(x) / g(x), we want to consider f(x) = q(x) g(x) + r(x). Define F(x) by x<sup>val(f)</sup> F(x) = f(x) and similarly G(x) using g(x). This breaks up into 2 cases:

1. If val(f) >= val(g), we have f(x) / g(x) = x^val(f) - val(g)^ F(x) / G(x).
2. If val(f) < val(g), then we have q(x) = 0 and r(x) = f(x). Then we proceed with the Euclidean algorithm.

For this implementation, we can simply in the `__init__` make `self.euclidean_degree = self.valuation`. This would also become a simple `quo_rem` function.

Furthermore, this gives me an idea for doing the GCD. Let f(X) = d<sub>f</sub>(X) F(X), where F(X) is a unit and d<sub>f</sub>(X) is the lowest degree portion of f(X); similarly for g(X). Then, we have

gcd(f(X), g(X)) = gcd(d<sub>f</sub>(X)F(X), d<sub>g</sub>(X)G(X)) = gcd(d<sub>f</sub>(X), d<sub>g</sub>(X))

This would then be very easy to implement. I can do this tomorrow if you don't want to do it.

Once we do this, this we achieve the actual stated goal of the ticket. `:P`

Thanks.

Unfortunately what I said about the gcd proof is false. We cannot simply factor out the lowest term like that. Consider `f(x,y) = x + y + HOT`, but we can only span a 2 dimensional subspace of `span{x^2, xy, y^2}` for any given unit. This discrepancy only gets worse for higher degrees. Thus, there exists elements in R[This is the Trac macro *x,y* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x,y-macro) / U, where U is the group of units, whose representatives are always infinite sums.

We might be able to do something using something in [this article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717108801058), but it seems a bit involved.

Perhaps it is best to leave the UFD separate for now.

Yes, please!  I'd really like to have factorization, but more than that I'd like to have the current branch in develop.

I tried to find some facts concerning formal Dirichlet series.  What I found would be the diff below.  However, I do not want to hold up this ticket any longer.  So I'd rather include it in a later ticket.  I suggest that we document your findings there, also.

I found a number of additional bugs from some additional test suites to test the different categories. I will have more changes, but now I really need to go to bed. It took me much longer than it should have to find the bad equality test that stemmed from not converting the coefficients to the base ring in `_an_element_`.

In the branch I just pushed, I made some changes:

- I fixed a major bug with the `UniqueRepresentation`.
- I changed `_true_order` to be a boolean as I felt there was no reason to duplicate the approximate and actual orders (now they can't get out of sync).
- I made the `R[This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)` fraction field `R((x))` when `R` is a field.
- Implemented `f // g` generically. It won't necessarily fail outright if it cannot work as it has to actually try to do the normal division.
- I marked some tests as `# long time` as they were taking nearly 2 seconds on my (8 year old) laptop.
- I brought in your doc in [comment:59](#comment%3A59).

Next to figure out what is going wrong with the species.

I decided to do the mixin approach for FPS (in contrast to FLS) since it is more specialized code. I could simply move `[x]gcd` to the `LazyPowerSeries` class and add checks to error out when invalid. This gets rid of the dynamic class, but they will always appear (where we have less understanding, even over **Z** as I understand it). Your choice.

Then let’s leave it as is.

I see. We could go back to doing `_true_order` being an (extended?) integer then. It is unlikely that they do get out of sync, but some care might be needed, especially with the `_element_constructor_`. We should note this reasoning somewhere in either a code or regular doc comment.

#32367 is just waiting for a green patchbot. If you want to run all tests and build the doc to verify my changes are good, then you can set a positive review as well.

The whole sequence of tickets will be merged. We have set them up so they merge cleanly. There is nothing we need to worry about for that.
