That was a somewhat silly statement, please excuse me, since the operation is built around a representation theoretic construction, and this construction is even described in the docstring.

So, a better question is how functorial composition relates to other operations with symmetric functions.  I do not have an answer.

I just realised that the functorial composition `f.functorial_composition(g)` is (at least by Begeron-Labelle-Leroux and Décoste-Labelle-Leroux) only defined for symmetric functions `g` which correspond to a permutation representation, i.e., a group action.

This does not have anything to do with the currently failing doctest, which I still have to fix.

<a id='comment:14'></a>If it cannot be described as an operation just on symmetric functions, then that is indicating that it probably should not be here but only in the species code that uses the lazy symmetric functions.

You're assuming `g` is a lazy symmetric function but you are allowed usual symmetric functions as input.

It took me a while to see that the `Stream_map_coefficients` is not passing the lambda function `lambda x: x, m`... Although it is still converting over the zeros. I think this could be made slightly faster by

```diff
-            g = Stream_map_coefficients(g._coeff_stream, lambda x: x, p)
-            f = Stream_map_coefficients(self._coeff_stream, lambda x: x, p)
+            sR = self.parent()._laurent_poly_ring
+            g = Stream_map_coefficients(g._coeff_stream, p, R)
+            f = Stream_map_coefficients(self._coeff_stream, p, sR)
```

```diff
-g_u = g[u.size()]
+g_u = g[sum(u)]
+g_u = g[sum(u._list)]  # or even faster, but less encapsulation
```
(I know it is much better OOP to do what you had, but Python is so slow...)

Wouldn't floor division `//` be better than usual division `/` in `g_cycle_type()`?

```diff
-res = p(0)
+res = p.zero()
```

Instead of `Partition(foo)`, you can use `_Partitions(foo)` to skip a few steps.

Trivial detail, this double blank line looked weird to my eye:

```diff

This is confusing me a bit. Are there some restrictions on the input for this to be defined? If we are indeed limited on the inputs, then we definitely need to move this to the species code.

For the technical help, there are a few ways out of this. One is to create a new branch for the later ticket based on the new dependency and and just cherry-pick the requisite commits.

We can at least do a culling for the “easy” check of Schur and powersum positivity. We can just then say anything beyond that, it is up to the user to make sure it is valid input (maybe with an example with the code on how to check).

<a id='comment:22'></a>There is absolutely no restriction on `self`.  The restriction on `g` is, that it must be the Frobenius character of a (sequence of) group actions.  The resulting Frobenius character is then well defined.

If `F` happens to be a formal sum (over any coefficient ring) of group actions, and `G` is a sequences of (true) group actions, the functorial composition is even well defined as a formal sum of group action.

I am quite sure that there are other examples of methods where `self` is any member of the class but the other arguments must satisfy some conditions.

Even checking for Schur positivity may be extremely time consuming.  But I can check whether there are other easy checks (there should be).

I am currently investigating a performance issue.

Indeed, you’re right that we can impose conditions on the inputs (including `self`) for certain methods. That was a weak argument in general; I was thinking it highlighted more than it does that we should be working with species.

Since we are converting to the powersums anyways, we can check positivity there at least. I agree that the Schur positivity check is less important and can be skipped for speed.

<a id='comment:24'></a>There are indeed a few obvious checks, but the code is tricky enough so that I first want to make sure I have a few good tests.

Here is a first summary:

* For a partition `s` of `n`, all partitions `t = g_cycle_type(n)` should have the same size, which should be the number of elements in `G[n]`, which is `n!` times the coefficient of `p[1,...,1]` in the Frobenius character of `G`. Therefore, `f_t = f[t.size()]` is only a single computation, and if `not f_t`,  we can return immediately.

* the main issue is that we are potentially computing very large coefficients of `self`, and there is no way around that.

* I am guessing that using `p.element_class(p, terms)` would save some time.
