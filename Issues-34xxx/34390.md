(from [#31247 comment:82](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31247#comment:82))

If `F` is a `ForgetfulFunctor` and applying `F` to a parent `R` constructs a new parent `F(R)` (e.g., after #34384), then there should be a coercion `R -> F(R)`.

Also if there's a coerce map `phi: R -> S`, then there should be a coerce map `F(phi): F(R) -> F(S)`.
