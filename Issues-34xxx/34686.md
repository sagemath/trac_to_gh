I'm computing quadratic twists of the p-adic L-function of the modular abelian surface J_0(23) with p = 11 split in the coefficient ring using the Pollackâ€“Stevens overconvergent modular symbols algorithm. The p-adic L-function seems to be correct, however all quadratic twists I computed are 0 up to precision 4, which is fishy.

```
from sage.modular.pollack_stevens.space import ps_modsym_from_simple_modsym_space
from sage.modular.pollack_stevens.padic_lseries import pAdicLseries

Nps = [[23, 11, 0, -4]] #, [29, 7, 0], [39, 7, 1]]
# J_0(23) has an 11-torsion point over Q
# the trivial character is unramified and even, need unramified and odd
# hence twist by Q(-1) of discriminant -4

for Npi in Nps:
    N = Npi[0]
    A = ModularSymbols(N,2,1).cuspidal_submodule().new_subspace().decomposition()[Npi[2]]
    print("A =", A)
    p = Npi[1]
    print("p =", p)
    prec = 4
    phi = ps_modsym_from_simple_modsym_space(A)
    print("computed phi")
    ap = phi.Tq_eigenvalue(p,prec)
    print("a_p =", ap)
    c1,c2 = phi.completions(p,prec)
    phi1,psi1 = c1
    phi2,psi2 = c2
    
    print("1st p")
    if N % p == 0:
        phi1p = phi1.lift(p, M = prec)
    else:
        phi1p = phi1.p_stabilize_and_lift(p,ap = psi1(ap), M = prec)
    print("computed phi1p for a_p =", psi1(ap))
    for D in [-1,-4,-3,-7,-15,-19,-23,-27,-31]:
        L1 = pAdicLseries(phi1p, quadratic_twist = D)
        print(L1)
        print(D, L1.series(prec))

    print("2nd p")
    if N % p == 0:
        phi2p = phi2.lift(p, M = prec)
    else:
        phi2p = phi2.p_stabilize_and_lift(p,ap = psi2(ap), M = prec)
    print("computed phi2p for a_p =", psi2(ap))
    for D in [-1,-4,-3,-7,-15,-19,-23,-27,-31]:
        L2 = pAdicLseries(phi2p, quadratic_twist = D)
        print(L2)
        print(D, L2.series(prec))

    print("")
```

Here is the output (Sage from [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) from yesterday) for the first prime lying above 11:
