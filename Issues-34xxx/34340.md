Currently a `LazyFamily` is automatically in `EnumeratedSets`, so at most countable.

We add keyword `category` to the constructor `Family` and all implementation classes, so that the user can choose the correct category.

Moreover, we define a (non-full) subcategory of `Sets` named `Families`, which captures the additional structure (= the map from the keys onto the parent).

Follow-ups / related:
- If the `function` from indices to objects is a morphism, then the category can be taken from the codomain.
- #18849 category of lazy family wrong if infinite combinatorial class used as index
- #8822 Bug in Family constructor

Unfortunately I don't see how that is in the documentation (beyond the `.. WARNING::`; also <code>\`__iter__\`</code> -> <code>\`\`__iter__\`\`</code> in there). Nor does that seem to be true that is is `values()`:

```
sage: F = Family([1,1,1])
sage: F
Family (1, 1, 1)
sage: F.cardinality()
3
```
The `__len__` also redirects from `cardinality()` by default (from the category). Or perhaps that is your point, that it is different than what you would expect as a set (of values). Since this is a mapping, it is a set of pairs `(k, v)`, so the cardinality for me is consistent.

Okay, I think I understand better what you want to say. I think you can say the same thing as

```
Note that for most set operations, this is considered as the set
of values; for instance, containment. There are some it is considered
as a map, such as its cardinality.

My point is that it is not wrong, but the implementation, mainly iteration, is just over the values. That is an implementation detail that is separate from its mathematical definition (nor do I think we should ascribe mathematical definitions to all implementations).

Here's a mathematical definition of a family that's better for us (= the programming context in which Family is used):

It "is" a set which "has" additionally a map from a (possibly ordered) set of keys onto it.

Okay, I think I can get behind this as a definition. However, this makes computing the `cardinality()` potentially very expensive. I am also not sure about getting rid of the sequence/function-like aspect it had, but I currently do not have a use-case for it.

I am also opposed to making everything extremely mathematically strict and rigorous. Again, there are times when it is useful to break that.

I think in most existing use cases of `Family`, the map is actually injective. 
It would make sense to me to add to `Family` a keyword `is_injective` (default `True` =  unchecked promise that it is injective) that enables a fast straightforward mplementation.

The function/sequence like behavior with `cardinality()` and iteration. Why I see it as an effective deprecation is the `.. WARNING::` saying it could be wrong, changing the definition in[comment:38](#comment%3A38), adding `is_injective` in[comment:44](#comment%3A44), etc. What this amounts to is saying "we need to change the behavior when the map is not injective."

The comparison with C++ STL map is not very useful. Its elements are pairs. Calling `iterator` gives pairs.

Python `dict` does not have this behavior. Calling `iter` iterates through its keys.

And `Family` has neither behavior of the two. Calling `iter` iterates through values.

I think it is clear I disagree with this. A lack of evidence does not mean something can never happen. In the use-cases we care about, it is injective, but there is no documentation about this being a requirement.

The crucial difference is equality.

Two `ImageSubset`s are equal if they have the same elements.

Two `Family`s are equal if they have the same keys and map (whatever that means in detail).

No, this does not follow at all.

I do agree with this part, so I retract what I said in[comment:15](#comment%3A15) regarding this.

`__len__` should be the same as `cardinality`.
And this is compatible with `__iter__` (which must iterate over the elements of the set - no duplicates!)

Yes, this is exactly what being in the category guarantees.

No, the interpretation that it "is" a set of pairs (= the pairs the elements) does not hold up. I've explained it before in[comment:55](#comment%3A55).

What are elements? They are what `__iter__` produces, and they are the idempotents under `_element_constructor_`. 

These are clearly the values, not key-value pairs.

I misread what you said, sorry about that.

Actually, since you are changing the category (to `SetsWithMaps`), we do not have to have the cardinality agree with `Sets`. This is not the same relation as for, e.g., `Groups` to `Sets`. It is not intrinsic to the set.

As I have repeatedly said, it is an abuse that we should document, but we have it because it is so convenient for the uses of this class.

You mean in spite of all of the classes' documentation, the `cardinality()`, the equality, the `__getitem__()`, and the `keys()`? One implementation even stores a `dict`; the `TrivialFamily` does not because it is wasteful.

IIRC, not having an `items()` comes from the fact this was implemented in Python2, when `items()` had to result in a list and there was not a reasonable way to make sense of this when the family was infinite. Now that we are allowed to return iterators for it, we can add this.

Honestly, I don't think this was ever meant to be treated so precisely as an object in `Sets`. What I do not support is removing functionality and increasing code duplication (without a good reason; the reasoning you have given does not meet that standard to me).

So this doesn't count:

```
[(k, F[k]) for k in F.keys()]
```
which is just a slight modification of

```
[(k, d[k]) for k in d]
```
for a `dict` `d`?

A `dict` only has one thing that returns the pairs, which is `items()`. The key-value pairs are also implicit in the equality comparison; more explicitly when it not a lazy family (comparing the `_enumeration` or `_dictionary`).

It has a very similar API to `dict` with an easy way to produce key-value pairs. With Python3, this is less useful for `dict` (as it doesn't create a new list of values but simply iterates over them), but `Family` was not written in that era.

So functionally it becomes no different than `ImageSubset` with an extra check on the defining map. Thus we should replace `Family` with `ImageSubset` (as a façade parent) and equality checks with checking the map (which contains both the keys and the values). This not only is more complicated to use (and potentially slower), it also does not have the ability to define an infinite sequence indexed by some enumerated set.

My understand is this was the starting point for your argument for saying things are wrong: `Family` is in `Sets` but (its values are) not respecting the mathematical description.

OK then, I propose the following. I revert the changes to the `values()` method so that it is not an `ImageSubobject` as proposed but gives an iterable that runs parallel to `keys`. (I can also throw in an `items()` method.)

Then there could be a separate method `as_set` that would return the `ImageSubobject`.
