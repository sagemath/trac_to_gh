Sage currently computes an isogeny of prime degree `ℓ` using `ϴ(ℓ)` base-field operations. We can achieve the same task in `Õ(√ℓ)` operations using the **√élu algorithm**; see https://velusqrt.isogeny.org.

This patch adds a fairly reasonable implementation of the algorithm to Sage. It works for odd-degree isogenies over all finite fields and can outperform the current `EllipticCurveIsogeny` class starting from degrees around 100, depending on the concrete performance of the underlying base-field and polynomial arithmetic.

The new code is marked as experimental and isn't used anywhere by default. After some real-world testing and careful benchmarking, we can (and should) let Sage automatically decide which implementation to use for a given input.

That's a good question. The √élu speedup works best if you have an actual rational kernel point as input, which requires big field extensions for large isogeny degrees over number fields. There is a variant of the algorithm for rational kernels made up of irrational points, but the speedup is smaller in that case.

Do you have an application in mind? Which field and isogeny degree, and how is the input given? It shouldn't be hard to make this work for number fields, but I'm not sure if it helps at all, which is why I restricted the current implementation to finite fields.

<div id="comment:7" align="right">Comment 7</div>

Here are some comments made as I read the code, so not in order of importance.  Point 4 about documenting parameters is the most important -- otherwise docstrings, examples ans tests are very good.

1. Instead of 

```
    sage: sum(iso(psiQ) == phiQ for iso in isos)
    1
```
I would suggest

```
    sage: any(iso(psiQ) == phiQ for iso in isos)
    True
```

2. There's a comment which says that the code works on "short Weierstrass curves", so I assume that menas that the characteristic should not be 2 (and perhaps also not 3).  This should probably be stated at the top of the file `hom_velusqrt.py`.  I haven't yet checked whether this condition is checked in the code.

3. I see the comment about this implementation only being over finite fields.  I think that is fine, given that isogenies of high degree over number fields are rarely encountered (since the field would have to have high degree over `QQ`), as I said in an earlier comment.

4. Methods' docstrings should have an INPUT block documenting all parameters (apart from `self`), for example the `_init_` method, of ProductTree and more (not itemised here!).

I see that the code here is not called from elsewhere -- in particular, not called by default by isogeny methods of elliptic curve classes -- so is certainly harmless to include.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">Comment 9</div>

Thank you for the comments! I added `INPUT:` blocks to (I believe) all functions that need them.

I also made comparison work using the same code as for composite isogenies (by reducing to evaluation), and added a (purely opt-in) call path from the `.isogeny()` method for elliptic curves so that it's easy to use the new algorithm without typing long import statements.

About your other remarks:

1. `sum(...) == 1` is a stronger statement than `any(...)`, which is why I wrote it this way: The former checks unique existence, the latter just existence.

2. The implementation does work for some curves in characteristic 3, but not all of them. In the code, it simply tries converting the curve to short Weierstraß form and throws an exception if that fails. This is slightly more general than checking the characteristic.

3. Indeed, the situation over number fields mentioned in [#34303 comment:5](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/34303#comment:5) does not seem like it would benefit from this. Should it turn out that there's something we can do after all, this can of course be taken care of at a later time.

<div id="comment:10" align="right">Comment 10</div>

Replying to [@JohnCremona](#comment%3A7):
> 4. Methods' docstrings should have an INPUT block documenting all parameters (apart from `self`), for example the `_init_` method, of ProductTree and more (not itemised here!).

One comment on this: To make it more publicly visible, it can be useful to have the inputs for `__init__` to be at the class-level documentation and not (repeated) at the method-level since it does not appear in the docstrings. However, this is mostly a suggestion when you expect the user to directly call the class to build the object (rather than, e.g., an element of a parent which is through the parent's `_element_constructor_`).

One additional comment to John's, the `INPUT:` items should always be in code format, e.g.:

```diff
     INPUT:
 
-    - `n` -- odd integer `\geq 5`
+    - ``n`` -- odd integer `\geq 5`
```

In `_choose_IJK`, it would also be good to specify that this needs to be an <code>:class:\`Integer\`</code> otherwise the method will break. In fact, since you are just wanting the integer part, you could do

```python
(n-1).sqrtrem()[0] // 2
```
As a general programming note, I prefer to avoid similar variable names, such as `b` and `b_`. It is too easy to make a mistake with them.

One minor comment

- You added a new option `short_weierstrass` to `compute_model`, but did not put it in `INPUT` section.

And one question. You added this 

```
.. WARNING::

    This module is currently considered experimental.
    It may change in a future release without prior warning.        
```
In what sense is this experimental? What change do you mean? (1) bug fixes (2) wrong result (3) performance improvement, or (4) removal?

I guess you mean only (3). In that case, you don't need to tag it as experimental. Any part of code in sage can be improved later without "prior warning". If this is the case, then I suggest to remove those scary "experimental" warnings.

If you mean (4), what is the condition of removal?
