Some MILP solvers support computing multiple solutions (called *solution pool*) to a given MILP problem, but Sage lacks the ability to retrieve more than one solution from the solver (the existing `.solve()` method produces only one solution).

Here is some info on how multiple solutions can be produced in Gurobi and CPLEX solvers:

- Gurobi: https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/refman/finding_multiple_solutions.html

  - https://github.com/sagemath/sage-numerical-backends-gurobi/issues/6

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
The most likely route for Sage to improve its MIP interface is to go through CVXPY (https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33920).

So a good step would be to investigate whether CVXPY provides this feature and if not, to work on getting it added.
