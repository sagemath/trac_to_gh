This is a followup to #33213. Some users prefer (or need) to control where temporary files are created, and we should document this:

- as described at https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.gettempdir, users can set the environment variable `TMPDIR`

Possible follow-up: 
- Also, according to https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/tmpreaper.8.html, at least on some systems it would be helpful to create a non-writable file `.tmpreaper` in the directory to prevent the system from doing automatic cleanup on it.

I beleive that the cleanup is automatic, using Python's `atexit` callback.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/atexit.html

(there is of course always a chance of a segfault-like abnormal exit, which might leave
rubbish after itself:

```
The functions registered via this module are not called when the program is killed
by a signal not handled by Python, when a Python fatal internal error is detected,
or when os._exit() is called.
```

This is what we have in `src/misc/temporary_file.py`:

```python
import tempfile

import atexit

# Until tmp_dir() and tmp_filename() are removed, we use this directory
# as the parent for all temporary files & directories created by them.
# This lets us clean up after those two functions when sage exits normally
# using an atexit hook
TMP_DIR_FILENAME_BASE=tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()
atexit.register(lambda: TMP_DIR_FILENAME_BASE.cleanup())
```
