I'd like to install pynormaliz in Conda, but was unsuccessful.
I tried the following: 

```
mamba install pynormaliz
conda install pynormaliz
mamba install normaliz && pip install pynormaliz
pip install pynormaliz==2.16
mamba install libantic
mamba install antic
```
See the attachment for screenshots.
