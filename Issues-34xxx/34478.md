I'd like to install pynormaliz in Conda, but was unsuccessful.
I tried the following: 

```
mamba install pynormaliz
conda install pynormaliz
mamba install normaliz && pip install pynormaliz
pip install pynormaliz==2.16
mamba install libantic
mamba install antic
```
See the attachment for screenshots.

The first issue should now be fixed as well. (normaliz was updated)

There's a new conda package for `pynormaliz` as well. I guess we can close this ticket after adding `pynormaliz` to `build/pkgs/pynormaliz/distros/conda.txt`.
