```
During a docker build (after applying u/saraedum/34242 's changes, which are good and necessary) I got this:

```
[curl-7.84.0] configure: error: --with-libmetalink no longer works!
[...]
[curl-7.84.0] Error configuring curl-7.84.0
[...]
The following package(s) may have failed to build [...]
[...]
* package:         curl-7.84.0
```

Libmetalink is no longer supported by curl, and apparently this also errors out on --without-libmetalink!

This makes no sense as a separate ticket. This should be part of the review of #34242. I think you can just push your commit to the ticket there.

It's a problem with recent curl versions. It's also still present in 9.7.beta8 and rebuilding artifacts should fail there, too.

It does not depend on #34242, that's just related to the only way I tried to build. Sorry for the excess information. It's also not a duplicate. But thanks for linking saraedum in.
