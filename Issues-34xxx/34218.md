Following the method of #31451, we implement a method that returns the number of maximal increasing subsequences of a permutation. This method is much faster than listing them all

```
sage: %time _ = sum(len(p.longest_increasing_subsequences()) for p in Permutations(8))
CPU times: user 1.76 s, sys: 2.97 ms, total: 1.76 s
Wall time: 1.77 s
120770
sage: %time sum(p.longest_increasing_subsequences_number() for p in Permutations(8))
CPU times: user 328 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 328 ms
Wall time: 328 ms
120770
```

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

I tried implementing it, but I'm not convinced by the result. The method with the adjacency matrix of the digraph seems to be slower. Mainly, I think that a lot of the problem comes from taking the exponential of the adjacency matrix of the digraph (an (n+2)-by-(n+2) matrix raised to a power that is in θ(√n) in average), and this seems to slow the process down much more than listing the longest increasing subsequences.

After coding it, I got the following times:

```
sage: %timeit len(Permutations(100).random_element().longest_increasing_subsequences())  # Naive 
2.8 ms ± 284 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: %timeit Permutations(100).random_element().longest_increasing_subsequences_number()  # new code
4.42 ms ± 42 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

Even though I'm uploading my code to the trac, I think we might want to give up on the project. Or, if you know of a way to make it efficient, I would love to see it.

I was about to explain how to count the number of paths on a DAG when all arcs go from level `i` to level `i+1` in time `O(|V| + |E|)`, but your solution avoids the creation of the DAG. This is smart.

You could add a little explanation of the algorithm, at least for Nadia.

For the documentation, you could use `:meth:~.longest_increasing_subsequences`, or something like that.

Otherwise, LGTM.
