The implementation currently assumes that the congruence subgroup is `SL_2(Z)` and that the ring is generated by `E2`, `E4` and `E6`. However, it is possible to create a ring for a congruence subgroup, which leads to some errors like this:

```
sage: QM = QuasiModularForms(Gamma0(17))
sage: f = QM.0
sage: f.to_polynomial()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
```

The goal of this ticket is to make the code for quasimodular forms ring coherent for congruence subgroup and add more doctests.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Nice!

1) `The first generators is the weight 2 Eisenstein serie` -> `The first generator is the weight 2 Eisenstein series` (ie remove s and the end of generators and add one in series)

2) `The other generators corresponds` -> `correspond` (plural)

3)

```diff  
-    def polynomial_ring(self, names='E2, E4, E6'):
+    def polynomial_ring(self, names='g'):
```
This is a backward incompatible change (maybe not so dramatic?). One possibility would be to use the signature `def polynomial_ring(self, names=None)` and then, depending whether the group is SL(2,Z) or not, use `E2, E4, E6` or `g0, g1, g2, ...`. Also, there might be a better naming than `g0, g1, g2, ...`. For example
- `E2` is always the first generator and could be name as such
- it could be useful that the other generators carry their degree as part of their names
Do you know if there is any standard naming in the literature?

Hi Vincent, thanks for your comment! I don't think there is any standard naming in the literature (even for Eisenstein series I've seen the same name for different normalizations). I agree however for a better naming. In line with your suggestion, I propose that we use `E2` for the weight 2 Eisenstein series and `gki` to denote the `i`-th generator of degree `k` For example, if the group is `Gamma1(3)`, we would have:

```
E2, g20, g30, g31, g40
```
What do you think?

This is a good question. Yes I think that it would be possible to recognize when it is the case. However, according to my experiments (up to level 30 for `Gamma0` and level 20 for `Gamma1`), it never happens that we have *exactly* the level 1 `E4` and/or `E6` as a generator for a ring of level > 1.

If these `i_d(E4)`, `i_d(E6)`,  ... can easily be detected it might be worth introducing a special notation for them (though parenthesis are not allowed in variable names). Is it true that `i_d(M(Gamma(e))` is a sub-algebra of `M(Gamma(d*e))`? I guess that this is related to these concepts of "old forms" and "new forms".

Indeed. Old forms are precisely these `i_d(f)`. Maybe they could be "tagged" with the appropriate level `d` in their names such as 
- for new forms: `F4`, `G4`, `H4`, ...
- for old forms of level `N/2`: `F4_2`, `G4_2`, ...
- for old forms of level `N/3`: `F4_3`, `G4_3`, ...
What do you think?

I think that it is a good suggestion (which is definitely possible to implement)! I also have a suggestion: instead of distinguishing the old/new forms, we could simply distinguish whether a generator is an element of a basis for the Eisenstein subspace or the cuspidal subspace. For example, we would have

```
sage: QM = QuasiModularForms(Gamma0(29))
sage: QM.polynomial_ring()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in E2, F2, S2_0, S2_1, E4_0, F4, G4, H4 over Rational Field
sage: QM.4.qexp(30)  # E4_0
1 + 240*q^29 + O(q^30)
sage: EisensteinForms(Gamma0(29), 4).0.qexp(30)
1 + 240*q^29 + O(q^30)
sage: QM.2.qexp(10)  # S2_0
q - q^4 - q^5 - q^6 + 2*q^7 - 2*q^8 - 2*q^9 + O(q^10)
sage: CuspForms(Gamma0(29), 2).0.qexp(10)
q - q^4 - q^5 - q^6 + 2*q^7 - 2*q^8 - 2*q^9 + O(q^10)
sage: QM.3.qexp(10)  # S2_1
q^2 - q^3 - 2*q^4 + 2*q^6 + 2*q^7 + q^8 - 2*q^9 + O(q^10)
sage: CuspForms(Gamma0(29), 2).1.qexp(10)
q^2 - q^3 - 2*q^4 + 2*q^6 + 2*q^7 + q^8 - 2*q^9 + O(q^10)
```
In other words, we would use:

* `Ek_i` for the `i`-th element of a basis of the Eisenstein subspace of weight `k`
* `Sk_i` for the `i`-th element of a basis of the Cuspidal subspace of weight `k` (for the chosen group)
* If the generators are of weight `k` and are not basis elements, we would use `Fk`, `Gk`, `Hk`,...

Note here the `Ek_i` are not necessarily Eisenstein series (but linear combination of Eisenstein series), could that be confusing? Do you have any preferences between the two suggestions?

Also, currently the method `ModularFormsRing.polynomial_ring` (not quasimodular forms), does not have any default option for the names. Should I implement this for the class `ModularFormsRing` first (as a default) for better consistency?
