(split out from #33613)

This is a pip-installable package

```
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command
```
... but it is best to be installed by the user in their system environment, not in SAGE_VENV.

For example, we want to make it available on Gitpod, in devcontainers, and the user-facing Sage Docker images.

In `src/environment-dev.yml` (#33740), it should be added as a `pip: ` line. (This happens through #33613.)
