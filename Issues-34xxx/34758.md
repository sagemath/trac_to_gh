Formal differentiation and integration generally do not work in `InfinitePolynomialRing`. For example:

(1) Differentiation fails in `InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)`, e.g. the following code:

```
R.<x> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
f = x[0] + x[1]
derivative(f,x[1])
```
gives the error:
> TypeError: Argument 'var' has incorrect type (expected sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular, got InfinitePolynomial_dense)

At the same time, it works if `QQ` is replaced with something more sophisticated like

```
K.<u> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
R.<x> = InfinitePolynomialRing(K)
f = x[0] + x[1]
derivative(f,x[1])
```

---

(2) A modification of the above example into:

```
K.<u> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
R.<x> = InfinitePolynomialRing(K)
f = x[0] + x[1]
derivative(f,x[2])
```
results in the error:
> ValueError: cannot differentiate with respect to x_2

---

(3) Same issues exist with with formal integration - e.g. this code:

```
K.<u> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
R.<x> = InfinitePolynomialRing(K)
f = x[0] + x[1]
integrate(f,x[2])
```
fails while `integrate(f,x[1])` works fine.
