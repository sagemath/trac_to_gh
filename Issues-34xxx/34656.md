There is little visible difference from the previous version, except

- Change right sidebar title from "Contents" to "On this page"

I expected style updates to make <h2> headings look more separated from <section> elements, but no such updates. 

Instead, we may put a thin rule below, for example, "Mathematics", but this is a work for another ticket.
