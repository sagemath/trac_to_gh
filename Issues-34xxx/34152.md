**Background**: `./bootstrap` needs about 112 KB of m4 and shell code from `gnulib`: https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib
Before #29549, these files were copied from a system-wide installation of `gettext` (which uses `gnulib`): https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext

As opposed to `gettext`, `gnulib` does not make releases, and many systems don't package `gnulib` at all. Thus one cannot uniformly rely on `gnulib` being already installed. This essentially leaves two options for using `gnulib` in Sage - copy said 112K into the Sage git tree, or  provide `gnulib` as a Sage pseudo-package (pseudo, due to the chicken vs egg issue: one cannot just make it an ordinary spkg - it needs to be  used by `bootstrap`).

Who needs to run `bootstrap` and where:
- Any developer who switches to a branch that makes an SPKG upgrade or other changes to the build system, on their development machine.
- Our  [portability testsuite](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/portability_testing.html#testing-sage-on-a-different-platform-using-docker), run locally using `tox -e docker-...` and on GH Actions, in the Docker container for the tested platform.

Who does not need to run `bootstrap`:
- Users who only build released versions from tarballs - because they come pre-bootstrapped
- Users who only build released versions from a git clone - because Sage falls back to downloading a tarball of the `configure` SPKG.

---

**History**: #29549 intended to remove the dependency of `bootstrap` on `gettext`. #29549 made it possible to run `bootstrap` on the `manylinux` platforms needed by cibuildwheel (#33800). 

The branch of #29549 followed "copy files" approach. However, some files that `gnulib-tool` added were left out from the commit, so it breaks on machines on which `gettext` is missing completely, as reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/FezzF5Q7Wt4/m/xyxVTaYgBAAJ

---

**This ticket**: 
Here we complete the task and remove `gettext` from various `distros/` files etc.

Two approaches have been proposed:

mkoeppe ("copy files") : [Branch u/mkoeppe/fix_broken_bootstrap__ac_lib_rpath_etc__ @ 4011cc4608](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/compare/develop...4011cc4608)
- Follows approach 3 of the [Gnulib manual section 'Integration with Version Control Systems'](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/VCS-Issues.html).
- 5 files, in `config/` and `m4/`, total 112 KB, have been imported by using [`gnulib-tool import iconv`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/Initial-import.html) and committed to the branch.
- Matches our practice with imported files [`m4/ax_*.m4`](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/m4) from [autoconf-archive](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/The-Macros.html). Different from our practice with SPKGs because the files are needed to generate the `configure` script.
- Introduces no new dependency.
- Burden on a developer who authors an update ticket for these files: Obtain gnulib by cloning the repo, then re-run `gnulib-tool import`, remove unneeded files (that's where #29549 went wrong), commit the changes. (Updates are expected to be necessary only very rarely.)
- Burden on users and other developers: None.
- dimpase's criticism of this approach: "gnulib's code is not Sage's code, it has no place in Sage git tree; this way, updating the imported gnulib files is tricky and error-prone by design". 

dimpase ("Sage pseudo-package"): https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/compare/develop...u/dimpase/config/gnulib
- Follows approach 2(C) of the [Gnulib manual section 'Integration with Version Control Systems'](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/VCS-Issues.html), but instead of using Gnulib's [Programs for developing in Git checkouts](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/Developer-tools.html), implements its own script (making checkout much faster, as full `gnulib` checkout is 250 MB).
- Introduces a new (although one can't really do Sage development without `git` installed) dependency on `git` and on availability of internet connection at the first run of `./bootstrap` in a tree, to pull 83 MB (fair to say that internet is needed for Sage development a lot, anyway).
- Burden on a developer who authors an update ticket for these files: Edit the `bootstrap` file to change the commit hash, verify that the list of files removed by `make bootstrap-clean` is still correct, commit this change 
- Burden on other users: a pseudo-package needs to be installed once (and updated, automatically)
- mkoeppe's criticism of this approach: "Having `bootstrap` operate a multi-megabyte git clone (on the 1st install and when there's a change of the gnulib commit hash) in the `upstream/` directory increases complexity for no benefit."

hybrid ("copy files, spkg-src script for maintenance"): [Branch u/mkoeppe/config/gnulib](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/compare/develop...u/mkoeppe/config/gnulib)
- Resolves the criticism on the "copy files" approach: "updating the imported gnulib files" is now assisted by the `spkg-src` script (adapted from dimpase's branch)
- Resolves the criticism on the "Sage pseudo-package" approach: "operate a multi-megabyte git clone (on the 1st install and when there's a change of the gnulib commit hash)" is only done by authors of tickets that update gnulib, not by general users of `bootstrap`.

The quote you attribute to `Invoking-gnulib_002dtool.html` is actually from `gitsub.sh`.

`gitsub.sh` can do `subcheckouts` rather than `submodules`.

Because the alternative (the `gitsub.sh` -- which is to be copied into the source tree by the way) introduces a ridiculous amount of complexity.

here is a way to use gnulib-tool instead.

Based on the original branch of this ticket.
By the way, I also noticed that gettext is still mentioned in a lot of `tox`-related and CI-related files.

one would expect the system maintainers to update reasonably often.
(indeed, e.g. on Debian stable and Fedora 34 gnulib is dated 2021; it appears that https://repology.org/project/gnulib/versions is not complete/up to date, e.g. is doesn't show Fedora packages).

No need for us to do this maintainance job.

Let me try to explain it again:

Upstream states clearly that gnulib is not to be installed.
And indeed, it does not have a `make install` target.

When Debian/Fedora/... are shipping gnulib, it is likely for the purpose of implementing their policy when building packages -- i.e., updating the vendored portions of gnulib of a package before starting the build.

My reading is that gnulib's upstream doesn't want gnulib to be vendored, either, as it leads to using outdated gnulib.
The upstream wants a fresh version to be used (well, this is understandable). That's why they promote `gitsub.sh`.

> The upstream wants a fresh version to be used

But not "fresh" as in "whatever is in upstream gnulib HEAD" whenever someone runs `./bootstrap`.

Updating the imported gnulib modules is something that the maintainer of a package does explicitly. For example, gettext does use `gitsub.sh` (in "submodule" mode): updating is done by a maintainer - that's a commit.

"bits" are thousands of lines, in about 10 files. To me it screams that it should be installed and copied as needed,  not copied once and committed in our tree. 

I think gnulib is in such a weird state due to GNU folks having badly failed QA on the gnulib/gettext stuff.

Possibly :) that has never stopped anyone - and I am talking in a professional capacity as someone who helped people install real stinky software on "supercomputers" and computers not really super. Sometimes, I turn to my fellow researcher or a PhD student and go "we are not going to do that one sorry, it stinks because it is real dead. Please reconsider".

IMHO my branch for the issue, i.e. `u/dimpase/config/gnulib`, is less stinky.

Matthias already caused a bit of havoc in 9.7.beta5 by only keeping in `m4/` some of the files installed by `gnulib-tool --import iconv` and not all (a bug only visible on a box without gettext installed :-(). And still `u/mkoeppe/fix_broken_bootstrap__ac_lib_rpath_etc__` doesn't add them all.

on gentoo I had to do the "missing keyword" fix for gnulib, in order to install it.
Not sure it's a bug or feature.

The only way? 
If one wants to follow the gnulib updates then one can use `git submodule` or a similar solution; and this is mentioned in gnulib docs.
Totally no need to follow the 30+ years old way of copying files by hand.

No. 

In approach 2 of the three approaches, in the variant with `git submodule`, the author of an upgrade ticket will have to run `git submodule update --remote` and then commit the change. 

For the author of an upgrade ticket for gnulib, it's the same amount of labor as approach 3: One command and one commit.

The drawbacks of this approach: 
- it exposes all developers (not just an author of a gnulib upgrade ticket) to the complexity of git submodules. 
- a source tarball of Sage will have to contain the full copy of gnulib (a copy of the submodule). More "vendoring" ;)

The Gnulib manual, https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/manual/html_node/VCS-Issues.html, introduces the three approaches with this paragraph:

`gnulib` can be distributed by distributions, as it's done with gettext, and gnulib consumers can just call `gnulib-tool`.

Just revert #29549 if you prefer, it's ugly but at least we don't increase codebase unnecessarily.

that's not what I had in mind - what I have in mind is an (imaginary, because it'd be insane design) header-only C++ library which comes with a tool to copy some of the headers it provides into the source tree, and the manual saying that you also should commit these copied headers into your tree.

Macros in autoconf-archive also have interdependencies. For example, `ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx_11.m4` depends on `ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.m4`.

This would make it harder for developers on macOS (with homebrew or without) or conda to work on tickets that upgrade packages. So they will have to learn about Gnulib even though their package upgrade has nothing to do with it.

And it would make it harder for running our portability CIs: We would no longer be able to bootstrap a source tree from git on all supported platforms without an extra step that downloads/checks out the whole Gnulib.

As far as Homebrew is concerned, it's easy to provide a formula to install gnulib.
Such a formula can be hosted on sagemath GH.
I don't know how easy it is to do the same with Conda.

Come on, that's like 2 lines of shell, to `git clone --depth=1` the `gnulib`, and adjust the path so that  `gnulib-tool` is there. 
We can just add this step to `./bootstrap`, to be run if it can't find `gnulib-tool`.

The gnulib overlord is explicitly against this: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2018-02/msg00041.html

Maintaining the homebrew formula ourselves would be as burdensome as keeping a part of gnulib in our source tree.

that message contains an explict advice against using an outdated gnulib. 

```
Packaging gnulib through a packaging system would have the effect that its
users see an older version of gnulib...
```

Yet your branch does exactly this - as the part of gnulib you copy becomes outdated very soon indeed.

I see. Pulling the latest gnulib from the repo sounds nice.

So if gnulib is not available on the system (I guess this is almost always the case), "./configure" would error out saying that I should brew install gnulib before continue. Right? I imagine this would be an extra hurdle for a new user.

I guess that practically gnulib in sage would need to be updated very rarely. If so, keeping hombrew formula (and conda formula too?) is a burden unnecessary in Matthias' approach.

no. It would be done by `./bootstrap`.

configure (and confgure spkg) would already provide what's needed from gnulib.
So anyone who doesn't modify `./configure` won't even notice.

Matthias' solution dumps a lot of unamended code in Sage git tree, as if there is no internet or a system package to get it from...

So in your solution, `brew install gnulib` will be a prerequisite before `./bootstrap` for a new mac user?

Presently, Xcode is a unique prerequisite to build sage from source. In your solution, `gnulib` will be another one.

I am talking about Homebrew users, not the other macOS users.

Besides, isn't it true that our gfortran doesn't build on the increasingly popular M1 macs, and so just Xcode is not enough any more, anyway.

For mac non-homebrew (and other gnulib-less platforms)  developers we can have few extra lines in bootsrtap to install gnulib into upstream/, if needed.

Dima, let me try to summarize the approach that you are advocating. Correct me if I get anything wrong.

Dima 1. Start maintaining a homebrew recipe that tracks the `main` branch of Gnulib.

Dima 2. Start maintaining a conda-forge feedstock that tracks the `main` branch of Gnulib.

Dima 3. Extend `bootstrap` so that it uses and runs a `gnulib-tool` found in the system, no matter what version.

Dima 4. Extend `bootstrap` so that if no `gnulib-tool` is found in the system, it uses `git` to checkout the HEAD of the `main` branch of Gnulib, and then runs `gnulib-tool` from there. (This introduces a dependency on `git` for the bootstrapping and a dependency on internet connectivity for bootstrapping.)

In fact, `./bootstrap` is already dependent on internet connectivity - if it fails it tries do download `configure.spkg`. For building from git repo, internet connectivity is mandatory too (at least for the 1st build, which fetches tarballs to unstream/).

As well, if someone wants to do a remotely meaningful work on Sage, and that's a reason to run bootstrap, then `git` would already be there.

We should pay more attention to our source tarballs - ideally they should already be configured, and so running bootstrap is never needed.

People don't have gnulib installations in their system installations because even though debian and some other distro do have this package, it is not dependency of any package.

The plan is to add upstream/gnulib to PATH and check for gnulib-tool in ./bootstrap. 
If found, just call it.

If not, `git clone` gnulib in upstream/ - then gnulib-tool is already there, so it can be called.

This is options 3+4 with almost the same amount of code as for option 4 alone.

No, it's not. In the message that you refer to in [comment:125](#comment:125), they argue against using a random arbitrary version from a package manager (which will be untested for use with the package to be built) -- which is Dima 3.

How does one know which version is good, and which is not? I presume a version used by Debian or Gentoo is likely to be OK, because it's actually used by many projects. Less sure about an arbitrary commit from the repo, but I expect, as they can't be bothered to tag a release for 9 years, all of them to be OKish.

"It is packaged as a tool for Debian package maintainers." - you wrote it yourself. So it is used, I presume, just not in the way controlled by official dependencies.

My theory is that gnulib maintainers just can't be bothered to do a sane redesign - no wonder autotools receive so much public hate...

Francois, in fact, today I have here a complete branch, ready for review. IMHO I convinced Matthias to at least look at it :-)

No, it has nothing to do with Cygwin.

In fact, there isn't even a bug to be fixed. I thought there was when Marc reported this failure but there is actually no problem that needs to be solved. When gettext-devel is installed (as is documented as a bootstrap dependency), everything works OK.

Present ticket is an improvement that removes the remaining bits of dependency on gettext in our bootstrap process.

this is actually not a good idea, as it will force git clone on every run on bootstrap.

On the other hand, `mainainer-clean` target removes `upstream/` all together.
For the purposes of avoiding a possible confusion when `upstream/` is a symbolic link,
I'll add an explicit removal of `upstream/gnulib` to `mainainer-clean`

I think it is problematic to require developers to know that they need to do `make maintainer-clean` when they pick up a branch with a gnulib version change.

Previously in this thread, you seemed very concerned about the maintenance burden that gnulib updates bring (comment:25, [comment:82](#comment:82)). The lack of an incremental update mechanism in your current branch places such a burden on developers who aren't even touching gnulib - everyone who runs gnulib.

What do others think about this?

The lack of an incremental update mechanism in your current branch places such a burden on developers who aren't even touching gnulib - everyone who runs gnulib.

My main concern always was to avoid copying a lagre chunk of gnulib verbatim into Sage git tree. 

As to incremental updates - you argued that we don't want to follow the upstream closely, i.e. no incremental updates, but just want to pin a gnulib commit, and then, at a good moment, pin a newer one. That's what my branch does.

I can add a comment in ./bootstrap regarding the way to do this kind of update -  that certainly should be enough IMHO.

You still haven't quite explained what exactly the nature of this concern is and why it weighs so heavy that it would warrant the complexity of a script that checks out 83 MB from the Gnulib git repo?

To compare with the copied files:

```
$ du -sh config/config.rpath m4/lib-*.m4 m4/iconv.m4 m4/host-cpu-c-abi.m4
 20K	config/config.rpath
8.0K	m4/lib-ld.m4

The complexity of the 20-line script? Where is the compelexity there? 
There isn't even a loop. 1/3rd of it is about supporting `-q` option of ./bootstrap.

This is not Sage's code, it has no place in Sage git tree - and there are means to get it in if needed. And your branch provides absolutely zero support for updating said code, while you keep arguing here that my code provides less than ideal support for it...

To update files in your branch, one would need to manually install gnulib, and run `gnulib-tool` with appropriate options, remove the unneeded files, and check the result in. You already made a mistake setting it up in the previous ticket. 

Updating in my branch is trivial compared to this.

As I wrote, I think it suffices to put something like

```
# to update macros coming from gnulib:
# 1) change the commit hash below to the one desired
# 2) remove upstream/gnulib/, e.g. by running 
#    make maintainer-clean
# 3) re-run ./bootstrap
```
in ./bootstrap's `install_iconv()`

I am sorry to admit that there is still a chasm between you, and it seems that sage-devel voting is the only way to escape from this seemingly eternal debate...

The voting would be about: 

Dima's approach: install Gnulib by pulling 83 MB from Gnulib git repo (Dima, please rewrite in line of length < 80)

vs

Matthias' approach: install Gnulib by copying 112 KB into sagelib source tree (Matthias, please rewrite in line of length < 80)

Dima writes cons of Matthias' approach in 3 lines of each length < 80

Matthias writes cons of Dima's approach in 3 lines of each length < 80

Then please François post the voting to sage-devel. Okay?

You've apparently missed my point in [comment:179](#comment:179)

Yes, step 1 of your instructions needs to be run by "whoever will be updating the version of gnulib we use", that is, the ticket author.

But step 2 has to be run by everyone who runs `./bootstrap` and switches to a branch that contains such an update ticket.

Ah, right, sorry. So we need to check that the output of `git rev-parse HEAD` in upstream/gnulib repo equals the commit hash hardwired in ./bootstrap, and if not, fetch the latter commit from the repo.

gnulib is an upstream package which does not provide tarballs. So instead of a tarball one has a directory under git control.

Historical information on the relevant files of gnulib can be obtained by using `git log build-aux/config.rpath m4/lib-* m4/iconv.m4 m4/host-cpu-c-abi.m4` in a clone of Gnulib. I think the last change relevant for any of our supported platforms is from 2017.

hybrid: mkoeppe's and dimpase's branches may be combined. Dima's script is modified to a tool for updating the gnulib files, and kept in, perhaps,  `build/pkgs/gnulib/spkg-src`

Matthias seems to have agreed to this (comment:238). If Dima agrees too, then we don't need to go for the voting.

I am aware that Dima' main concern is to merge external source files into our source tree, but there already exists `m4/` directory filed with such files.

I leave it to François to decide whether to take the hybrid candidate or not for the voting. I do not insist.

OK, so if I understand the problem correctly:
- we need 5 files in "m4" from "gnulib":

``` 
m4/host-cpu-c-abi.m4	
m4/iconv.m4
m4/lib-ld.m4
m4/lib-link.m4
m4/lib-prefix.m4
```
- the only officially supported way to get these is by a git pull
- there are objections to having git as a prereq for bootstrapping a sagemath build

The "hybrid" solution:
- checks the relevant files into the sagemath repo
- includes a tool to pull from git and update those checked-in files

That means the "hybrid" solution is very robust once the files are successfully checked in: no dependency on anything outside of sagemath!

Ugly bit: we now have files in the sagemath repo that should definitely not be edited! There's another process to update them. It seems to me the ideal solution would be if there is a tarball somewhere that we CAN use to get those files from. We could do that, right? we could host a tiny repo inside sagemath that manages the tool to make the tarball by pulling from the gnulib repo and then host that tarball in our "mirror" infrastructure. Would the "spkg" download-and-resolve infrastructure already be available pre-bootstrap? or is in reasonable to special-case the download?

It looks to me like the pain of maintaining a tarball that can be referenced should be weighed against the impurity of having files under our git control that don't really belong there. But that could be processed as an improvement over "hybrid" which eminently looks like a maintainable solution.

That's right.

Yes. It shares this property with other files in our `m4/` directory, from autoconf-archive - see discussion in [comment:103](#comment:103) and following. It's just a "fact of life" - bootstrapping has to start somewhere.

Since Nils proposed to create a tarball for `gnulib` and host it somewhere, as an alternative to using git to
clone `gnulib`, I've done it here:
https://github.com/dimpase/gnulib/releases/tag/1.1beta

As you see, an `xz -9`-comperessed tarball is under 4.5Mb, instead of 80Mb via `git clone` - note that git normally uses compression (zlib) on the fly, meaning that in fact the amount of data transferred by `git clone` is perhaps only 1/10th of 80 Mb.

This places gnulib tarball size among rather average Sage spkgs.

Since we're doing numbers again (after [comment:231](#comment:231), [comment:236](#comment:236), [comment:241](#comment:241), [comment:243](#comment:243)), let me just point out that the ratio 80 MB : 112KB after said compression changes to 4.5Mb : 22kB

It sounds like a `gnulib_cropped` package would strike a nice balance if hosting the files under sagemath git control is too impure. But it sounds like it's a bit of a one-off (because the normal spkg tools are not available yet when it's needed) and perhaps not worth the effort for what we get from it.

I'll have a go at a "conceptual" design, having the benefit of not having the technical knowledge to delve into details (a good design can be understood on a conceptual level, but I won't claim there exists a reasonable converse):

Perhaps there are other files/artifacts that we need but don't really want to "git" control ourselves, and are needed before our normal spkg infrastructure (which is normally responsible for this) is available?
I saw `autoconf-archive` mentioned before? So would this be more worthwhile if we'd have a `bootstrap-aux.spkg` that has all this crap in it?

The tools for *building* that `spkg` could just be the normal tools: in the building process, it would clone `gnulib` and extract the required files and similarly fetch `autoconf-archive` and extract (and patch?) what it needs, and then wrap that up in something that would look like a normal `spkg`.

However, this package would normally not be *installed* through the normal means -- instead, when bootstrap needs it, it would locate an appropriate `spkg` file (or download it) and then extract what's necessary from it by virtue of it being a tarball.

Or perhaps fulfilling the bootstrap-aux resources needs to happen in a pre-bootstrap step, that augments our git repo with some auxiliary external files?

This makes me think Matthias comment "bootstrapping has to start somewhere" might apply and make this not worthwhile, but perhaps someone else can see a way of making something like this work without too much trouble.

I think it is useful to think about why it is that the idea of having these files in `m4` elicits such strong emotions regarding "uncleanliness" in some of us, that some of us want to go to extremes (such as the bizarre solution in #27823, which introduced the gettext dependency; or accepting a bloat factor of 1000, [comment:278](#comment:278)) -- just to avoid the unclean feeling.

I have to admit that when I first used gnulib (in a more substantial way than here, namely to implement relocatability for LattE, around 2007) that I was also kind of offended by the idea of adding its imported files to my pristine CVS repository.

So here's some food for thought: The strong emotional response may be the result of decades of abuse that we endured by the early version control systems (RCS, CVS, SVN): If you committed something "unclean" to the central system, the system would come back and hurt you.

This is all outdated with git.

But when I build sage from a fresh `git clone` the system already goes and measure speeds to mirrors, and (I think) fetch some spkgs. I presume the tarballs (or at least some fat versions of them) still come with those spkgs included, so that no internet connection is necessary to build those?

I also recently learned that on all my previous builds, apparently `bootstrap -D` has executed, downloading a configuration from somewhere.

So it seems to me that if the bootstrap auxiliaries can be packaged in an spkg, we could provide the resources through an already-required pathway, so that shouldn't really make things more fragile.

That is provided that the `bootstrap-aux.spkg` locating/downloading can actually be done through normal means. If we have to special-case its discovery too much then *that* would probably make it more fragile and hence not worth it.

I think it is important that for sagemath we do remain in a state where, after installing a well-defined set of prereqs (which should be commonly provided bits on our supported platforms) and obtaining a well-defined tarball, one should be able to build sage without internet access.

I think that rule was previously already violated by `gettext-devel` being a soft prereq for which a silent workaround required internet access (in the form of `bootstrap -D`, which apparently does need internet access), so getting that solved is already progress. That can also be solved by declaring `gettext-devel` a hard prereq (provided it's a commonly provided component).

Here what Bruno Haible (on of primary authors of gnulib/gettext) has to say about our problem:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2022-08/msg00103.html
Note that he does not suggest to check bits of gnulib in our git tree.
(and elsewhere he says he seldom sees this done: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2022-08/msg00102.html)

```

OK, now let's talk about the actual problem at hand.

I won't jump into the discussion there, because
  - it's already a very long thread,
  - I don't know what an "SPKG" is,
  - I don't know about the preferred habits in the sagemath dev community.

But there I read:
> $ du -sh config/config.rpath m4/lib-*.m4 m4/iconv.m4 m4/host-cpu-c-abi.m4
>  20K  config/config.rpath

>  12K  m4/iconv.m4
>  24K  m4/host-cpu-c-abi.m4

Yes, these is currently the list of files needed for AM_ICONV.

If you need only a few files from Gnulib, the common approach is
to invoke either gnulib-tool (if present, indicated through an
environment variable GNULIB_SRCDIR that the user can set) or
fetch the files from the git repository one by one.

To fetch only config.rpath:

GNULIB_REPO_URL="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=blob_plain;hb=HEAD;f=";
for file in build-aux/config.rpath; do
  if test -n "$GNULIB_SRCDIR" && test -d "$GNULIB_SRCDIR"; then
    "GNULIB_SRCDIR/gnulib-tool" --copy-file $file $file
  else
    wget -q --timeout=5 -O $file.tmp "${GNULIB_REPO_URL}$file" \
      && mv $file.tmp $file
  fi
done

To fetch all 6 files:

GNULIB_REPO_URL="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=blob_plain;hb=HEAD;f=";
for file in build-aux/config.rpath m4/lib-ld.m4 m4/lib-link.m4 m4/lib-prefix.m4 
m4/iconv.m4 m4/host-cpu-c-abi.m4; do
  if test -n "$GNULIB_SRCDIR" && test -d "$GNULIB_SRCDIR"; then
    "GNULIB_SRCDIR/gnulib-tool" --copy-file $file $file
  else
    wget -q --timeout=5 -O $file.tmp "${GNULIB_REPO_URL}$file" \
      && mv $file.tmp $file
  fi
done

This is the quick solution, which minimizes network traffic. But it is not
future-proof: At any moment, some more files may become needed, due to
changes in the *.m4 files. The future-proof solution is to download
the gnulib git repository (shallow, if you want) and run
  $GNULIB_SRCDIR/gnulib-tool [OPTIONS] --import iconv

AM_ICONV is documented in two places:
- https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/AM_005fICONV.html
- https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/MODULES.html#module=iconv

The consumption as a gnulib module is meant to be easier than through
gettext. A lot of work has been put into gnulib to make such a consumption
easy; gettext (autopoint) lags behind in this aspect.

> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gettext/2011-10/msg00012.html

Already in 2011, if you need only AM_ICONV, the gnulib module 'iconv'
was the better choice.

> config.rpath (in gnulib) appears to be an orphan.

No. It is maintained in gnulib, as you can see from the commit history.

> (Does gettext misappropriate prefixes AM_ and
> AC_ for its macros, making an impression that they are from autotools?)

Yes, the prefix AM_ here is a mistake. It should better be gl_. But
changing it now would cause more annoyance than benefit.

Dima, I suggested that you take your complaints about upstream gnulib to their mailing list in [comment:73](#comment:73) and again in [comment:87](#comment:87), 6 weeks ago, but you declined to do so in [comment:88](#comment:88).

I see that now you did, after all, yesterday or so, in https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2022-08/msg00089.html, and you are writing:

```
If a project does not use git's submodules, noone wants an extra
complexity of submodules to be added to the build system just due to
the need for gnulib.
In some projects I am or was involved, it's basically the case that the code 
injected by
the gnulib-tool got committed into the tree, and blissfully forgotten
about. 
```
Yes, having the gnulib-imported modules "blissfully forgotten" is exactly what my approach (and the hybrid approach) is achieving. You now seem to acknowledge that it's common practice, which sounds like a way to a peaceful resolution of what we discussed here in this ticket.

This is not what we "want". The documentation [1] gives three options. You

This problem must urgently be resolved: presently, you can have a valid setup according to the documentation and yet be unable to build/configure the last couple of sagemath beta releases.

As far as I could see, a valid solution could have been "gettext-devel is a prereq for sagemath" (a really ugly one, though) but the solutions on the ticket at the moment would work too. I think the priority is to get *something* merged that resolves the acute problem.

Once we have a somewhat workable solution in place that at least allows people to build sage, we can look if the solution, like any piece of sage, can be improved. Who knows, perhaps a better solution even gets merged before a release is actually made! But we cannot really wait for that now.
