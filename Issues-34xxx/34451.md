for #30229.

The new static method `CompWithSym._canonicalize_sym_antisym` brings `sym` and `antisym` into a canonical form as sorted tuples of sorted tuples, with trivial symmetries and antisymmetries dropped.

Using it also removes some code duplication.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Thanks for introducing this and removing the code duplication!

It would useful to add `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` fields in the docstring of `_canonicalize_sym_antisym`. 
Besides, I don't understand this change:

```diff
-                if len(isym) < 2:
-                    raise IndexError("at least two index positions must be " +
-                                     "provided to define a symmetry")
+                if len(isym) < 2:
+                    # Drop trivial symmetry
+                    continue
```
Shouldn't an error be raised if the input pretends to define a symmetry/antisymmetry with less than  2 index positions?

True...

I am wondering about what should be meant by *trivial symmetry*, especially for an antisymmetry: if only a single index position is provided, is there any meaning in stating that the components are antisymmetric with respect to this position?

One index (whether symmetry or antisymmetry) just means that there's a symmetry group of 1 element acting. This element is the identity

```
                if isym[0] < 0 or isym[-1] > nb_indices - 1:
                    raise IndexError("invalid index position: " + str(i) +
                                     " not in [0," + str(nb_indices-1) + "]")
```
is undefined. Same issue a few lines lower.
