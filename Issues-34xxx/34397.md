<a id='comment:2'></a>After this ticket, it remains in `generic_graph.py`:

```
2       E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent
13      E203 whitespace before ':'
3       E221 multiple spaces before operator
2       E231 missing whitespace after ','
2       E265 block comment should start with '# '
2       E271 multiple spaces after keyword
2       E272 multiple spaces before keyword
13      E501 line too long (164 > 160 characters)
22      E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'
```
This is much better !
