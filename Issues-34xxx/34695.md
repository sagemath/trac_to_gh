The following code

```
R1.<x> = QQ[]
R2.<y,z> = QQ[]
R3.<t> = QQ[[]]
R4.<u,v> = QQ[[]]
V = [x,y,z,t,u,v]
print([SR(q) for q in V])
print([SR(q).variables() for q in V])
```
prints

```
x y z 1*t u v
[(x,), (y,), (z,), (t,), (), ()]
```

That is, conversion `SR(t)` produces `1*t` rather than just `t`, while conversions `SR(u)` and `SR(v)` produce expressions with no variables.

I don't think these are bugs; maybe possibilities for enhancements. You can look at the types:

```
sage: type(SR(x))
<class 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(SR(t))
<class 'sage.symbolic.expression.SymbolicSeries'>
sage: type(SR(u))
<class 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: SR(u).pyobject() == u
True
```
As you can see, univariate series are converted to a different type, which apparently explicitly prints the coefficient, even if it's 1.

From the last line you can see that the multivariate series got wrapped as basically a "constant" in the symbolic ring. This indicates that no more advanced mechanism for converting to `SR` has been implemented.

For either case, `u.polynomial()` and `t.polynomial()` give you a polynomial object that can be converted to SR.

At very least I'd expect that under conversion of an algebraic object (polynomial or series) into `SR` its variables are converted into variables of the resulting symbolic expression. This is not case for multivariate series conversion as the resulting symbolic expression has no variables.

I understand that there are workarounds such as intermediate conversion to a polynomial, but I'd really appreciate if this bug is fixed so no workaround would be needed.

I haven't checked, but there may not be an appropriate multivariate series object in SR to map to. You could just truncate and map that, as "polynomial" does, but that's far from a perfect conversion either. It's definitely worth opening a ticket for implementing a more meaningful conversion there, since mapping them to symbolic atoms is almost surely useless, but I expect that ticket won't be trivial to resolve. Someone would have to study what a reasonable target construction in SR would be.

You could repurpose this ticket for that purpose and perhaps split out improving printing of `SymbolicSeries` to a separate ticket
