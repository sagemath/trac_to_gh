It doesn't seem to mind if the title word appears by itself on another line. If the title is "Axioms", then a line starting "Axioms are" will cause an error but a line containing just "Axioms" is fine.

I am fairly opposed to those parentheses; they are unnatural to me. I think we should simply remove them. If we decided we want them to be there, we should use the `:class:`HeckeModules() <HeckeModules>`` syntax.

The parentheses, indicating that it's talking about the unique instance, not the class, seem to be used very widely in this context, as `git grep 'subcategory of .*()'` shows.

> If we decided we want them to be there, we should use the `:class:`HeckeModules() <HeckeModules>`` syntax.


That's what the current branch does.
