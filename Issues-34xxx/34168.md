```
- ``category`` -- a subcategory of :class:`HeckeModules` ``()`` or ``None``

then the output from `M._Hom_?` in the notebook looks ugly:

I can't successfully build the docs with underscore methods included, so it's hard to test more broadly.

We could skip this file, but I would prefer if we could understand and solve the problem.

This bug seems to strike whenever

- the title of the file is a single word, and
- that word begins another line in the file

It doesn't seem to mind if the title word appears by itself on another line. If the title is "Axioms", then a line starting "Axioms are" will cause an error but a line containing just "Axioms" is fine.

I am fairly opposed to those parentheses; they are unnatural to me. I think we should simply remove them. If we decided we want them to be there, we should use the <code>:class:\`HeckeModules() <HeckeModules>\`</code> syntax.

So they should perhaps make the change `docstring = docstring.replace(firstline, "") ->   docstring = docstring.replace(firstline, "", 1)` to just change the first occurrence.

The parentheses, indicating that it's talking about the unique instance, not the class, seem to be used very widely in this context, as `git grep 'subcategory of .*()'` shows.
