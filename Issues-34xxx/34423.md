<a id='comment:6'></a>As on the other tickets, it would be good to have an explanation not in terms of species since not everyone who uses this code will know about species.

Some other details:

- Only use `\` instead of `\\` since you marked the docstring as `r"""` (i.e., "raw" in Python-lingo).
- Move the reference to the master reference file and follow the naming conventions there.

<a id='comment:24'></a>Hi Travis!

I am not sure whether such a test is a good idea, since the arithmetic product does not really make sense for symmetric functions with constant term.  On the other hand, I am guessing that setting the arithmetic product of `1` and `p_mu` to `p_0` for any `mu` is the only sensible extension.

So, do you want to see

```
sage: L(s(3)).arithmetic_product(5*p[2,1])
15*s[]
```
or did I misunderstand?
