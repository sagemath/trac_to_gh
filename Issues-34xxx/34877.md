I am wondering if there will be a new version for `LazyLaurentSeriesRing` supporting possibly multivariate case as `LazyPowerSeriesRing`?

Thank you very much and happy holidays!

There is no good/easy definition of multivariate Laurent series.  See, eg. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723086913000054
