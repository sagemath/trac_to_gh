The docker images are using Ubuntu impish. We should instead build against the latest LTS version jammy.

Also, the README on Docker Hub is quite outdated.

Finally, we drop the CircleCI setup here. To my knowledge nobody is using it and I it's likely broken by now anyway.

When I do set ARTIFACT_BASE=sagemath/sagemath-dev:develop then docker build errors out with

```
ImportError: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

which is to be expected, since ubuntu jammy switches to openssl 3.

This is a critical change: without it, building with docker fails.

I guess that's only a temporary issue. Once a newer image has been uploaded that shouldn't be an issue anymore.

It seems to have failed for a weird reason not related to the docker configuration (`apt-get` not being able to install some packages).
I think it has been fixed on the `develop` branch, maybe merging/rebasing will be enough to fix the build ?

BTW: I also managed to build the docker images on my system using your updated dockerfile so +1 for merging this patch

I took the liberty to rebase on develop to check whether this fixes the CI issue, and updated the ticket. Feel free to re-enable your branch at any time!
