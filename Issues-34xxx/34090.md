`tox -e docker-conda-forge-minimal -- python3` now goes a bit farther but:

```
  [python3-3.10.5]   Could not build the ssl module!
  [python3-3.10.5]   Python requires a OpenSSL 1.1.1 or newer
  [python3-3.10.5]   Custom linker flags may require --with-openssl-rpath=auto
```

Build on `cygwin` fails (not new from this upgrade) -https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/7121373085:

```

Python build finished successfully!
The necessary bits to build these optional modules were not found:
_gdbm                 _tkinter              nis                
ossaudiodev           spwd                                     
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.
The following modules found by detect_modules() in setup.py, have been
built by the Makefile instead, as configured by the Setup files:
_abc                  pwd                   time
