We fix some issues in `src/sage/graphs/base/`, except for files `static_sparse_graph.pyx` done in #34053 and `boost_graph.pyx` done in #34046.

After this ticket and #34046 and #34053, it remains mostly some `E225 missing whitespace around operator` and `E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'` in `src/sage/graphs/base/`.

For the first block, I meant to remove the space you put, to make it a commented-out code block as originally it was. Now you made it look like a comment...

Or if you understand the code and you are sure that it is not necessary any more, perhaps you may remove the commented-out code block.

The real comment before it has a typo, by the way.
