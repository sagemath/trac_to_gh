We fix some issues in `src/sage/graphs/base/`, except for files `static_sparse_graph.pyx` done in #34053 and `boost_graph.pyx` done in #34046.

After this ticket and #34046 and #34053, it remains mostly some `E225 missing whitespace around operator` and `E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'` in `src/sage/graphs/base/`.

You replace the ambiguous name `l` with `label`. But this name `l` seems also used in other names like `l_int` and `l_int_other`. I think using the same name `l` consistently makes the code more readable. And `l` is as short as `v`, which remains.

For the first block, I meant to remove the space you put, to make it a commented-out code block as originally it was. Now you made it look like a comment...

Or if you understand the code and you are sure that it is not necessary any more, perhaps you may remove the commented-out code block.

The real comment before it has a typo, by the way.

I agree. Thanks.

I was wrong. There was no typo. Anyway you removed the comment together with the code. I am not a native speaker either :)
