We fix some issues in `src/sage/graphs/base/`, except for files `static_sparse_graph.pyx` done in #34053 and `boost_graph.pyx` done in #34046.

After this ticket and #34046 and #34053, it remains mostly some `E225 missing whitespace around operator` and `E741 ambiguous variable name 'l'` in `src/sage/graphs/base/`.

You replace the ambiguous name `l` with `label`. But this name `l` seems also used in other names like `l_int` and `l_int_other`. I think using the same name `l` consistently makes the code more readable. And `l` is as short as `v`, which remains.

The real comment before it has a typo, by the way.
