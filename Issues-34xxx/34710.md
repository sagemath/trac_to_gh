Sphinx, upgraded to 5.2.3 in #34615, builds the doc with object (classes, functions, ...) entries in toc (table of contents).

We keep the object entries in TOC, but remove them from the main index pages.

<a id='comment:8'></a>
The recent upgrade of Sphinx to version 5.2.3 introduced unexpected changes in our documentation by the new "object entries in toc" feature of the new Sphinx.

See the main index page in the middle:

https://8f8af65e54d3a9962cfab40f15dc23f4e955b43f--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/curves/index.html

See the "CONTENTS" column on the right:

https://8f8af65e54d3a9962cfab40f15dc23f4e955b43f--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/curves/sage/schemes/riemann_surfaces/riemann_surface.html

To "fix" the unexpected changes, I prepared two tickets #34706 and #34710 (this ticket)

#34706 reverts the changes and makes the doc look as it did before the Sphinx upgrade.

#34710 keeps the object entries in toc, but remove them from the main index pages.

Now we need to make a choice:

(1) Accept the default of the new Sphinx (discard both of #34706 and #34710)

(2) Remove object entries from the doc (take #34706 and discard #34710)

https://e14c85760435dc1721bf626d494e92ac9bfbd46b--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/curves/index.html

https://e14c85760435dc1721bf626d494e92ac9bfbd46b--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/curves/sage/schemes/riemann_surfaces/riemann_surface.html


(3) Keep object entries but remove them from main index pages (take #34710 and discard #34706)

https://a1b70f3da76e4e2324b6b1c7cf3765bbc4f7d737--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/curves/index.html

https://a1b70f3da76e4e2324b6b1c7cf3765bbc4f7d737--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/curves/sage/schemes/riemann_surfaces/riemann_surface.html

(4) Still other possibility. Then please open a new ticket for your favorite style.

I advocate (3), but others may have different favors. So I invite a few for opinions. If all agree with me, we will go for (3). Otherwise, I will open a vote (again...) in sage-devel.
