After #33011, downstream packages that use Cython and `cimport` Sage modules need to activate PEP 420 namespace package support in Cython using `with cython_namespace_package_support` (as is done in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/setup.py#L106 for sagelib).

This feature is standard in the upcoming Cython 3 (#29863). Until downstream packages are updated, we can patch our Cython.
