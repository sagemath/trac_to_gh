# Issue 34038: Add custom scaling feature for vectors in plot_vector_field3d() as available in ​VectorField.plot()

`plot_vector_field3d()` lacks user defined scaling. By default the plotted vectors in the field are auto scaled (from 0 to 1) by using maximum length vector in the plotting domain. It is a very nice thing to auto scale like this as it avoids possible overprint of vectors with those ahead of them. But sometimes if user needs them to be scaled to a desired factor say 1 (no scaling) then for those situations we propose availability of user defined scaling as available in ​`VectorField.plot()`. This can be achieved by following modifications in `src/sage/plot/plot3d/plot_field3d.py`:

1. Add a new keyword `scale='auto'` to `plot_vector_field3d()` which can take any real number as scaling factor. Anything other than real number is ignored and auto scaling is performed. Default value 'auto' has nothing to do other than being a non-real quantity, a string, telling it to go with default auto scaling. We wish auto scaling be the default.

```python
def plot_vector_field3d(functions, xrange, yrange, zrange,
                        plot_points=5, colors='jet', center_arrows=False,
                        scale='auto', **kwds):
```

2. Modify the existing

```python
    max_len = max(v.norm() for v in vectors)
    scaled_vectors = [v/max_len for v in vectors]
```
into

```python
    if scale in RR:
        scaled_vectors = [v*scale for v in vectors]
    else: # For `scale` is anything other than real number
        max_len = max(v.norm() for v in vectors)
        scaled_vectors = [v/max_len for v in vectors]
```

No #2922 is not done. By default the vectors are normalized and scaling option is not provided.
Scaling is available in `VectorField.plot()` which is a part of sage manifolds but is a bit slow due to wide capabilities of sage manifolds and its methods.
