**We decided to go for #34710 instead of this ticket**

Sphinx, upgraded to 5.2.3 in #34615, builds the doc with object (classes, functions, ...) entries in toc (table of contents). 

In a sense, this makes our doc broken since new entries are added to toc unintentionally. Original discussion: ticket:34615#comment:22

This tickets reverts the change using a Sphinx configuration variable, also introduced in Sphinx 5.2.3.
