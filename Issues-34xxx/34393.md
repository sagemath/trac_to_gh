> That's an implementation detail, so I think the method `components` should be `@abstract_method(optional=True)` in the category, and the implementation should go to `CombinatorialFreeModule_Tensor`


I would actually go one step further and make it explicitly an `@abstract_method` like `Sets().CartesianProducts()` does with `cartesian_factors()`. Then you could implement

```python
def construction(self):
   return (TensorProductFunctor(self.category()), self.tensor_factors())
```
again following `Sets().CartesianProducts()`.

Side note: [comment:22](#comment%3A22) is not a solution for `@abstract_method(optional=True)` simply becomes a `NotImplemented`:

"Technical debt" is a big scary word. But no, doing proper deprecation does not add to the debt.

No, we shouldn't, at least without also removing `TensorProducts()` from its category (thereby completely stripping the fact it knows and carries a tensor product of `R`-modules structure).

The problem is exactly what the test is failing for: The construction is not giving the parent back. The underlying issue is that we do not have a Schur algebra representation on the individual factors. So it needs its own `construction()` method. The simple fix is just to have it return `None` to match the previous behavior. The more complicated one is to implement a `ConstructorFunctor` for it, but I don't think that will be useful here.
