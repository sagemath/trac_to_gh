I would actually go one step further and make it explicitly an ``@`abstract_method` like `Sets().CartesianProducts()` does with `cartesian_factors()`. Then you could implement

```python
def construction(self):
   return (TensorProductFunctor(self.category()), self.tensor_factors())
```
again following `Sets().CartesianProducts()`.

I think by putting a `try`-`except` block around it with a deprecation message (which nothing is being deprecated), you are increasing Sage's technical debt for people who are doing something fairly advanced and likely should know better than to do this.

No, we shouldn't, at least without also removing `TensorProducts()` from its category (thereby completely stripping the fact it knows and carries a tensor product of `R`-modules structure).

The problem is exactly what the test is failing for: The construction is not giving the parent back. The underlying issue is that we do not have a Schur algebra representation on the individual factors. So it needs its own `construction()` method.
