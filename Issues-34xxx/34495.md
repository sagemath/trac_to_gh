We introduce a construction functor for invariant and equivariant submodules.

`sage.modules.with_basis.invariant.FiniteDimensionalInvariantModule` gets a `construction` method.

In follow-up ticket #34499, also the tensor modules with prescribed monoterm symmetries from #30229 will get a `construction` method. An illustration of this application, capturing symmetric and antisymmetric matrices, is included as an example. (See #32029, #30276.)

Ah, right, because it goes through the hook and doesn’t try to simply change the ring of the class. Perhaps then my question is an optimization one. Can we simply just change the base field (IIRC, it doesn’t work over general commutative rings, maybe not even `ZZ`, but I am not sure offhand) and not go through the (likely expensive) linear algebra computation? Although this creates some issues for subclasses with different construction signatures and forcing things to be overriden… I am wondering if we can find a good solution to that.

True, and more specific cases (e.g., the `FiniteDimensionalInvariantModule`) could then implement their own version rather than going through the hook. The `invariant_module()` hook might need some more thought at some point about its signature since it was just considered in a more local context.

Only thing left is the failures in the (graded) free resolutions. I don’t think they are related, but I don’t know what would cause them to fail in general.
