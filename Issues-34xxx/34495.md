We introduce a construction functor for invariant and equivariant submodules.

`sage.modules.with_basis.invariant.FiniteDimensionalInvariantModule` gets a `construction` method.

In follow-up ticket #34499, also the tensor modules with prescribed monoterm symmetries from #30229 will get a `construction` method. An illustration of this application, capturing symmetric and antisymmetric matrices, is included as an example. (See #32029, #30276.)

Are you asking why the constructed pushout is a correct pushout? In the end, this will depend on the Action doing the right thing on the elements of the larger module. If it doesn't, then all bets are off.

Ah, right, because it goes through the hook and doesn’t try to simply change the ring of the class. Perhaps then my question is an optimization one. Can we simply just change the base field (IIRC, it doesn’t work over general commutative rings, maybe not even `ZZ`, but I am not sure offhand) and not go through the (likely expensive) linear algebra computation? Although this creates some issues for subclasses with different construction signatures and forcing things to be overriden… I am wondering if we can find a good solution to that.
