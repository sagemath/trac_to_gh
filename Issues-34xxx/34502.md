That's very helpful. For the particular case I was using, I had already implemented my own version using the algorithm you described there (item 1 below). Now I see at least three options:

1. create a polynomial ring with new generators `z_1, ..., z_m` corresponding to the subalgebra generators `y_1, ..., y_m` and reduce using the ideal `(z_i - y_i)`
2. use the `in_subring` function that you provided
3. use an `algebra_containment` function with a very similar definition

By the way, regarding item 1, is there any advantage to replacing a line like

```
J = R.ideal(z1 - (whatever), z2 - (whatever))
```
with

```
J = R.ideal(z1 - (whatever), z2 - (whatever)).groebner_basis()
```
Does that speed up the `f.reduce(J)` computation, for example if you need to do this for many `f`?

Here is a draft. Maybe it would be better to not use `singular_lib` and `singular_function` and instead define these at the same level as other Singular functions in Sage. Anyway, it's a start.
