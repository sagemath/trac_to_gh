With #33275 (finitely presented graded modules of graded algebras) and #33950 (modules over polynomial rings), we now have two different implementations of graded free resolutions in Sage. However, their API and internal structures are very different. The goal of this ticket is primarily to start unifying the API.

My main proposal is to introduce a new method to finitely-presented graded modules called `free_resolution()` (or perhaps `graded_resolution()`) that creates an instance of a new class `GradedFreeResolution` (different from that on #33950). I see several advantages of doing this:

1 - It stores all of the computations. If you want a longer resolution, you do not need to compute the previous ones again.
2 - You no longer need to specify the length and all computations are done lazily when needed.
3 - You will then be able to manipulate the resolutions, such as being able to compute left derived functors.
4 - It would make it more consistent with #33950.

The reason I am suggesting calling it `free_resolution()` (or `graded_resolution()`) is so that we can go through a deprecation period for `resolution()` that just returns the maps. It would also make it consistent with #34379.

However, there are some questions about the API for both of these that we should try to make consistent:

I) What should `__getitem__` return? On #33950 it returns the `i`-th module. This is what I would lean towards as the maps are a little more ambiguous.
II) Should this new class eventually be a subclass of `FreeResolution_generic`? Would it make sense for there be a common ABC at all?

Some other things to make consistent are:

- Being able to create submodules of graded free modules. This only works right now if we can echelonize the matrix. New classes might be needed.
- Being able to create a matrix from the free module morphisms. Although this is a general, mostly separate, issue as not every algebra implements an `is_field()` that is currently required for constructing a finite rank free module in the `to_vector()`.
- The `image()` of a graded module morphism is not a (sub/quotient) module.

For package structure, I suggest 

(1) move the class `sage.homology.free_resolution.FreeResolution_generic` to `sage.resolution.free_resolution.FreeResolution_generic`

(2) move the class `sage.homology.free_resolution.FreeResolution` to `sage.resolution.polynomial.free_resolution.FreeResolution`

(3) move the class `sage.homology.graded_resolution.GradedFreeResolution` to `sage.resolution.polynomial.graded_resolution.GradedFreeResolution` 

(4) create a new module `sage.resolution.fp_graded.free_resolution` for a new class `GradedFreeResolution` for fp graded modules, subclassed from `sage.resolution.free_resolution.FreeResolution_generic`

I agree that `sage.homology.resolutions.(...)` is logical. I worried that the full name for a free resolution class of, say, fp graded modules

`sage.homology.resolutions.fp_graded.free_resolution.FreeResolution`

is too long or too deep (just to me?). I have no strong opinion for this.

I agree.

That's a good idea until there is a subdirectory (then they will just become `free.py`, etc.). There is some precedent for this too: see `rings.real_*` (in `sage.matrix` also, but it is redundant there).

+1 as they should either be in graphs or combinat IMO.
