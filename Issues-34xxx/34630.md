(from [#32874 comment:27](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32874#comment:27))

SciPy has switched to meson-python / ninja (see #34081).
See for example https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/main/scipy/linalg/meson.build; this replaces older infrastructure like https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/main/tools/cythonize.py

Cython recently added the `--depfile` switch 
- https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/4949 (`cython --depfile`)

This finally enables build systems to do their own dependency tracking (caching dependencies in depfiles) instead of passing all source files to Cython - where it takes a good chunk of the time for a trivial `./sage -b` ([#32874 comment:27](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32874#comment:27)).

What is needed is to make use of `cython --depfile` in meson:
- https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/9049 (Cython dep handling)

Then we can switch from setuptools to meson-python. We would continue to use our own package/module discovery code (`sage_setup.find`).

In this ticket, we change the build systems of `pkgs/sagemath-*` (including `pkgs/sagemath-standard`) to meson-python. Editable builds will continue to use setuptools for a monolithic build via `src/setup.py`. (meson-python as of 0.11.x does not support PEP 660 editable wheels - https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/issues/47)
