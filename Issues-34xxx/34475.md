It currently uses:

```
    def _apply_functor(self, ambient):
        return ambient.span_of_basis(self.basis)
```
The method `span_of_basis` is only defined for the free modules of `sage.modules`. We generalize it to `CombinatorialFreeModule` (and all `ModulesWithBasis`).

Follow up: Handle the case of tensor modules of a `FiniteRankFreeModule`: only detect whether the given basis is one of the submodules with prescribed symmetries from #30229; in all other cases, we raise `NotImplementedError`.

    "body": "<a id='comment:12'></a>\nI am somewhat hesitant to have the construction be defined at the category level because it is such a universal method (mainly, construction as a what?; cf. gens()). For the tensor products, that carries functorial properties that subspaces do not do. Typically we add structure to submodules. In other words, it is common to have (mathematically) a specific algebra defined as a submodule of linear transformations (the classical Lie algebras are important examples). Of course, that is not how we have generally implemented them in Sage, but it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to, say, have the Lie algebra sl<sub>n</sub> of traceless `n x n` matrices be in the join category `LieAlgebras(R) & Modules(R).Subobjects()` (although this would lead to other conflicts with their relationship with their universal enveloping algebra and considering them as a Lie subalgebra of that (under the commutator bracket)). So the test suite would fail unless the user provides a `constructor` method.\n\nFor tensor/Cartesian products, they are almost always built from more fundamental objects as inputs that funnels into a few classes. In particular, one can easily identify what class should be used to make, e.g., tensor products. So I feel the trade off is in favor of doing it at the category level. This is in contrast to here, where we cannot have any such distinguished class.",

I am somewhat hesitant to have the construction be defined at the category level because it is such a universal method (mainly, construction as a what?; cf. gens()). For the tensor products, that carries functorial properties that subspaces do not do. Typically we add structure to submodules. In other words, it is common to have (mathematically) a specific algebra defined as a submodule of linear transformations (the classical Lie algebras are important examples). Of course, that is not how we have generally implemented them in Sage, but it wouldn’t be wrong to, say, have the Lie algebra sl<sub>n</sub> of traceless `n x n` matrices be in the join category `LieAlgebras(R) & Modules(R).Subobjects()` (although this would lead to other conflicts with their relationship with their universal enveloping algebra and considering them as a Lie subalgebra of that (under the commutator bracket)). So the test suite would fail unless the user provides a `constructor` method.

For tensor/Cartesian products, they are almost always built from more fundamental objects as inputs that funnels into a few classes. In particular, one can easily identify what class should be used to make, e.g., tensor products. So I feel the trade off is in favor of doing it at the category level. This is in contrast to here, where we cannot have any such distinguished class.

Not generically, but you can override the name of the category. You could obviously write a `_repr_()`, but I forget offhand if there is some other way to just set the short name of the category (I believe there is though).

This suggests to me that the functor construction is not preserving enough properties.

Furthermore `==` does not have to mean mathematical equality either (what if we chose different indexing sets for the submodules?). Dealing with equal-but-not-identical parents can offer up another set of painful and subtle issues with equality and coercion. Plus we aren’t able to utilize things cached with the submodule if we compute it a second time.

There are trade offs with any way we decide to implement them, but it is not fair to call it too strict.

Either way, I still think the construction functor needs to better reconstruct the object too.
