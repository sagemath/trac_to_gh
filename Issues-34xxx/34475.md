It currently uses:

```
    def _apply_functor(self, ambient):
        return ambient.span_of_basis(self.basis)
```
The method `span_of_basis` is only defined for the free modules of `sage.modules`. We generalize it to `CombinatorialFreeModule` (and all `ModulesWithBasis`).

Follow up: Handle the case of tensor modules of a `FiniteRankFreeModule`: only detect whether the given basis is one of the submodules with prescribed symmetries from #30229; in all other cases, we raise `NotImplementedError`.

Not generically, but you can override the name of the category. You could obviously write a `_repr_()`, but I forget offhand if there is some other way to just set the short name of the category (I believe there is though).

This suggests to me that the functor construction is not preserving enough properties.

Furthermore `==` does not have to mean mathematical equality either (what if we chose different indexing sets for the submodules?). Dealing with equal-but-not-identical parents can offer up another set of painful and subtle issues with equality and coercion. Plus we aren’t able to utilize things cached with the submodule if we compute it a second time.

There are trade offs with any way we decide to implement them, but it is not fair to call it too strict.

It does make sense to downgrade the subspaces to a `CachedRepresentation`.

Actually, perhaps we can get a best of both worlds. We just need to extend the submodule class to somehow handle multiple indexing sets and just inform the users that the prefix is unique. In general, I expect this to a infrequently used feature, but it would be good to support the different indexing sets.
