In order to successfully build the `./configure` script on archlinux you need the `autoconf` (providing `aclocal`) and `automake` system packages.

It seems that the `build/pkgs/_prereq` sage package lists system requirements for a variety of distros so I'll add it there. Should it be documented / specified elsewhere as well?

**Keywords:** archlinux, configure

It's not `_prereq`, it's `_bootstrap`.
