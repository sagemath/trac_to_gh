<a id='comment:11'></a>LGTM. This will make handling equality easier for subclasses.

Note that this will cause a slight performance regression when there is hashing involving things that are represented by the same list but should not be compared. For example `[3, 2, 1]` as a permutation versus as a partition (if they both inherited from `ClonableArray`). However, I don't see this having a practical effect and it is still outweighed by the ease-of-use IMO.
