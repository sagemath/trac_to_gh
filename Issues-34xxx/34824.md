We do not want the following:

```
sage: P = ParkingFunctions(3)
sage: f = P([1,1,1])
sage: g = ParkingFunction([1,1,1])
sage: f in P
True
sage: g in P
True
sage: f in list(P)
True
sage: g in list(P)
True
sage: f in set(P)
True
sage: g in set(P)
False
```

Is this because of `metaclass=InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass`?

<a id='comment:11'></a>LGTM. This will make handling equality easier for subclasses.

Note that this will cause a slight performance regression when there is hashing involving things that are represented by the same list but should not be compared. For example `[3, 2, 1]` as a permutation versus as a partition (if they both inherited from `ClonableArray`). However, I don't see this having a practical effect and it is still outweighed by the ease-of-use IMO.
