Same for `LazySymmetricFunctions`.  `compositional_inverse` might be a good alias.

Unfortunately, there seems to be an inaccuracy in `Stream_plethysm`:

```
sage: h = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).h()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: L = LazySymmetricFunctions(p)
sage: X = L(p[1])
sage: e = L(lambda n: h[n]) - 1 - X
sage: g = L(None, valuation=1)
sage: g.define(X - e(g))
sage: g[0]
0
sage: g[1]
p[1]
sage: g[2]
...booooom... (max recursion error)
```

```

Next I'd like to implement revert for TaylorSeries, derivative, derivative_with_respect_to_p1.

Still missing: functorial_composition, arithmetic_product, logarithm for SymmetricFunctions.

All of these are needed for #32367.

    "body": "<a id='comment:10'></a>\nI agree that we should throw out integer vectors that are asking for things less than the valuation. Actually, this is simple to modify with the current code.

I agree that we should throw out integer vectors that are asking for things less than the valuation. Actually, this is simple to modify with the current code. Just subtract `valuation * len(la)` from `n`. Then you just add back in the valuation to each component of the integer vector.

It sure looks like you have just essentially duplicated the plethysm code, which I don't think we should do, especially for marginal speed gains. I think you are better off improving the symmetric functions code directly.

Another micro-optimization that can be done is to store `len(l)` in the `integer_vector_weighted.iterator_fast` code since this never changes (it can be surprising how much this extra little function call can affect speed).

Some things that should be fixed:

- `_scale_part` and `_scale_c` need doctests. I might just inline the code however as they are such small and simple functions (they are needs for the symmetric functions implementation, but I think that could be improved).
- I would explain the algorithm for `revert` in terms of (lazy) symmetric functions rather than species.
- Instead of `sum_of_terms()`, I would just directly create a dictionary and go through `p._from_dict()` to avoid the redirection.
- Even though its cached, I would make this change:

  ```diff
  -        if power[d]:
  -            terms = [(self._scale_part(m, i), self._raise_c(c, i)) for m, c in power[d]]
  +        val = power[d]:
  +        if val:
  +            terms = {self._scale_part(m, i): coeff for m, c in val if (coeff := self._raise_c(c, i)))}
           else:
  -            terms = []
  +            return self._p.zero()
   
  -        return self._p.sum_of_terms(terms, distinct = True)
  +        return self._p._from_dict(terms, remove_zeros=False)
  ```
  (I only very recently learned of the `:=` syntax. it is so great to have a way to assign equality in a statement in Python. It makes writing code like the above so much easier.)

However, there is also a decent part of me that would like to see the code duplication with `sfa.plethysm()` reduced, in particular with the logic around the include/exclude. Although the same could be said for `_scale_part` and `_scale_c`, which are (essentially) the same as in the symmetric functions.

Lastly, shouldn't the compositional inverse also be implemented for lazy Laurent and Taylor series?

Concerning code duplication:

* scale_part might be a useful action on partitions.  Can this be made fast?

* the handling of degree one elements could go into a separate top-level function, but I have no idea where to place it.  Possibly sfa.py?  Alternatively it could be a method on rings.  It might look as follows:

```
def _degree_one_elements(R, include=None, exclude=None):
    """
Return variables in the ring `R`.

    INPUT:

    - ``R`` -- a :class:`Ring`
    - ``include``, ``exclude`` (optional, default ``None``) --
      iterables of variables in ``R``

    OUTPUT:
    
    - If ``include`` is specified, only these variables are returned
      as elements of ``R``.  Otherwise, all variables in ``R``
      (recursively) with the exception of those in ``exclude`` are
      returned.

    """
    if include is not None and exclude is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("include and exclude cannot both be specified")

    if include is not None:
        degree_one = [R(g) for g in include]
    else:
        try:
            degree_one = [R(g) for g in R.variable_names_recursive()]
        except AttributeError:
            try:
                degree_one = R.gens()
            except NotImplementedError:
                degree_one = []
        if exclude is not None:
            degree_one = [g for g in degree_one if g not in exclude]

    return [g for g in degree_one if g != R.one()]
```

Besides, is the following a bug?

```
sage: ZZ.variable_names()
('x',)
sage: ZZ
Integer Ring

No faster than the current implementation I think. However, +1 for making it a method of partitions. (Note that it should return an element of `_Partitions`, not the parent of itself.)

+1 as a top-level function in `sfa.py`. I would call it `_parse_degree_one_elements` and maybe tweak the one-line doc to be a little more precise about what it does. However, those are fairly trivial comments.

I think it is the result of very legacy code with it being a subclass of `sage.structure.parent_gens.ParentWithGens` and likely a requirement of the names being non-empty. See also

```
sage: QQ.variable_names()
('x',)
```
I would like to call it a bug, but that is perhaps slightly unfair.

Good luck!

It could be an action of `NN` on partitions, but I think that is a much broader change than what is needed. If we wanted to do that, it would definitely need to be another ticket.

There remains a bug in `LazyTaylorSeries.__call__`:

At the very beginning, we deal with the case where f is a polynomial:

```
        # f has finite length
        if isinstance(self._coeff_stream, Stream_exact) and not self._coeff_stream._constant:
            # constant polynomial
            poly = self.polynomial()
            if poly.is_constant():
                return P(poly)
            return P(poly(g))
```
However, this is too eager.  In the example below, we would like to compute `g.define(z / ((1-z)(g)))`, which fails, whereas `g.define(z / (1-g))` works.  Also, if we compute in the `LazyLaurentSeriesRing` instead, there is no problem.

It would be great if `LazyLaurentSeries.__call__` and `LazyTaylorSeries.__call__` and perhaps even `LazySymmetricFunction.__call__` could share some code, to avoid these inconsistencies.


Example:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyTaylorSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: f = 1 - z
sage: g = L(None, valuation=1)
sage: g.define(z / (1 - g))
sage: g
z + z^2 + 2*z^3 + 5*z^4 + 14*z^5 + 42*z^6 + 132*z^7 + O(z^8)

sage: g = L(None, valuation=1)
sage: g.define(z / f(g))

Actually, it is not a bug in the lazy Taylor series code. In fact, it i working âcorrectlyâ because it is trying a very basic test to see if it is zero or not, the test of which is out of our hands, which at the time it does not know. I would actually expect the same problem in the `LazyLaurentSeriesRing`.

To fix this, the quick-n-dirty fix would be to have an uninitialized series have `__bool__()` simply return `True` as it represents a variable that has yet to be specialized . This would make it consistent with variables of a polynomial ring or symbolic variables. )Plus, in nearly all use cases, this will end up defining a non-zero series anyways.) Actually, because of that, I would even say this is the correct thing to do, and not simply a hack solution.

A more broader change to fix the problem would be to have some kind of lazily-evaluated version of composition. Not only would it increase the code complexity when there is arguably a valid solution, it also would not be compatible with polynomials that can be evaluated at elements of the lazy series ring `R` with the result being coerced into `R`. Note that the polynomial itself does âânotââ even need to convert (much less coerce) into `R`. So this would just sweep this problem under the rug (this includes even the extreme change of removing the exact implementation or feeding off to the polynomial code).

Having written all of this down, I am fully convinced we should just make it work by saying an uninitialized series is considered to be non-zero by having `__bool__()` return `True` in that case.

I'm afraid I simply do not understand your argument.  You say that you "would actually expect the same problem in the `LazyLaurentSeriesRing`, but I don't see the problem there:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: f = 1-z
sage: g = L(None, valuation=1)
sage: g.define(z / f(g))
sage: g
z + z^2 + 2*z^3 + 5*z^4 + 14*z^5 + 42*z^6 + 132*z^7 + O(z^8)
```
In fact, this is (essentially) a doctest.

In `LazyLaurentSeries.__call__`, if `f` is a polynomial, we use the following test before composing the polynomial with `g`:
* if `g` is not a `LazyModuleElement`, we compose
* otherwise, if `g` is a `LazyCauchyProductSeries` and `g._coeff_stream` is `Stream_exact` and `not g._coeff_stream._constant`, we also do a special case
* finally, if none of the above applies, we use the generic algorithm.

I don't see where `g.__bool__` would come into play here.

In some respects, we get lucky here. I would expect the following to work:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: f = 1 - z
sage: g = L(None, valuation=1)
sage: f(g) == f.polynomial()(g)
```
In particular, the `f.polynomial()(g)` fails in exactly the same way as above.

The only reason we need to do anything special is for the negative exponents when `g` is exact. Everything else is just an optimization (as the comment there indicates, it should be replaceable by `return poly(g)`) to take advantage of caching (it could also benefit by reducing the number of multiplications too).

> I don't see where `g.__bool__` would come into play here.


It is there in the error message as there is a call to `is_zero()`.

Taylor series should be OK now.

There are still slight problems with plethysm.  Some of them might be best fixed in the implementation of ordinary symmetric functions:

```
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: p[2,2,1](3)
...
TypeError: only know how to compute plethysms between symmetric functions or tensors of symmetric functions
```
However, I am not completely sure who should handle plethysms of the form `f o g` where `f` is an ordinary symmetric function and `g` is a lazy symmetric function.  The situation is similar to the case of polynomials, but not the same.  Essentially, we need to be able to express `g` as a (possibly constant, possibly lazy) symmetric function in the power sum basis.

One possibility would be to handle this in `Stream_plethysm`.  However, this goes against the general philosophy that the "exact" case is handled in `lazy_series.py`.  On the other hand, implementing yet another version of plethysm in `LazySymmetricFunction.__call__` seems like a lot of code duplication to me.

Yea, this one annoys me from time to time that it doesn't at least try to coerce the element into a symmetric functions. This is for a separate ticket, but +1 for trying the coercion (or at least handling elements from the base ring)

The symmetric function `f` definitely should. There is no mechanism within Python (or within the coercion framework) to automatically pass control over to `g`.

I don't know how `Stream_plethysm` could even get control of this without having `f` actually handle the object. At which point, there is an easy solution: convert `f` to a `LazySymmetricFunction` and run `__call__` on that. I will push a fix in just a minute.

I ended up fixing this here as it was basically part of the changes I needed to make for the lazy series. We will not be able to return an element in the original parent for "constants" (broadly interpreted) without doing some cumbersome (and well-definedness is another issue too).

The check for tensor products is a bit brittle, so I've tried to make it a bit more robust (say, if the commutative ring is also a tensor product).

In trying to find a doctest for this, I found out that tensor products of commutative algebras do not know they are commutative rings:

```
sage: X = algebras.Shuffle(QQ, 'ab')
sage: Y = algebras.Shuffle(QQ, 'bc')
sage: X in CommutativeRings()
True
sage: Y in CommutativeRings()
True
sage: T = tensor([X,Y])
sage: T in CommutativeRings()
False
```
This is now #34453. While not a strict dependency for this ticket, it means I get to write the doctest I wanted.

It seems that we are done for now!

I am sure that code and especially tests and documentation could and should be polished, but maybe it would be good to move forward now.  At least concerning functionality, the code is a huge improvement over what we had before this ticket!

Perhaps it would make sense to make more tests systematic, and also check which tests are now redundant.

I am very grateful for all your help and expertise, Travis!

Thank you for the changes and all your hard work.

Some comments about my changes:

- I would avoid variable names of `prod` to not cause possible confusion with the function `prod` (it isn't currently imported, but it could be and even used here).
- I am very worried about breaking the assumption of the `wt_int_vec_iter`. By not following it, the plethysm could break in a subtle way. I just reversed everything.

Isn't the `:=` syntax great? I had been missing that so much.

If my changes are good, then I we can set a positive review and move on to the next thing. We can do more polishing of the documentation and tests later.
