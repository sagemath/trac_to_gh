Keywords: gsoc2022 northwest-diagram

Implement a class for diagrams (collections of cells `(i,j)` indexed by the natural numbers), and a class for diagrams with the northwest property. A diagram has the northwest property if the fact that `(i1, j1)` and `(i2,j2)` are in the diagram implies that the cell `(min(i1,i2), min(j1,j2))` are in the diagram.

From a quick look, you are not passing a `parent` argument, which should be the first argument to any element `__init__` method, and passing that up to `Element.__init__`. Mainly, these code blocks:

```python
        ClonableArray.__init__(self, Diagrams(), cells, check=False)
```

```python
        Diagram.__init__(self, cells, **kwargs)
        ClonableArray.__init__(self, NorthwestDiagrams(), cells, check=check)
```
I also don't like the double initialization of `ClonableArray` here. `Diagram` should properly handle everything, otherwise it is a code smell that strongly suggests they should not be subclasses (but they should be in this case; note that this is not universal).

Remove also the `kwargs` and make them explicit, mainly the `check`.

You should also use `_repr_` (with 1 underscore).

Sorry, I'm confused. I thought that `Diagrams()` and `NorthwestDiagrams()` were those `parent` arguments. Am I misunderstanding what you are saying?

Some minor things:

* I'd prefer `number_of_xxx` over `n_xxx`, for consistency with other methods in the combinat file

* since `Diagrams` are extremely important, but `NorthwestDiagrams` maybe not so much, should they possibly be in separate files?

* it would be great if `ParallelogramPolyomino`, (the 2-dim case of) `Polyomino`, `Partition`, `SkewPartition` and possibly even `Composition` interacted nicely with `Diagram`.  In particular, the method names should be the same, whenever possible.  I imagine that for `Polyomino` this will not be possible, but for the others, it should be.

* I'm not sure whether `number_of_cells` should be there.  If so, wouldn't `size` be more appropriate?

Actually, for me the most important point is the synergy with the other classes.

+1 Although one could argue `nrows` and `ncols` are okay (perhaps as aliases) since they are there for matrices.

> * since `Diagrams` are extremely important, but `NorthwestDiagrams` maybe not so much, should they possibly be in separate files?


-1 They are natural to go together and it can make maintenance easier (and the documentation is also together). I don't think we should base these decisions on an "importance" metric.

> * it would be great if `ParallelogramPolyomino`, (the 2-dim case of) `Polyomino`, `Partition`, `SkewPartition` and possibly even `Composition` interacted nicely with `Diagram`.

I agree with having the method names the same in general.

> * I'm not sure whether `number_of_cells` should be there.  If so, wouldn't `size` be more appropriate?

Some additional comments:

- In `check()`, it should raise `ValueError` when failing rather than an `assert`.
- All `Diagrams` can be enumerated. You put coordinates the cells by **N** by running along the diagonals. Hence, diagrams are in bijection with all finite subsets of **N**, which are easily enumerated by the binary strings of nonnegative integers.
- The default for `check` should always be `True`. It is only when we as developers want to avoid it that we should change it.
- `_cells` should be a `frozenset`. You are not using it as a `dict`. This is also hashable.

Also, some of the methods don't have doctests, so I setting this to "needs work".

Here are my current comments:

I don’t like putting so much information at the class-level documentation because each it is not associated with each individual class nor easily accessible by `Foo?`. I think a lot of it is better broken up into the individual (element) classes.

The first one-sentence description should be just that: one sentence. Subsequent information can go in the next paragraph (i.e., with a blank line in between).

For the `Diagram` class, it should sort the objects and store them in the list. There shouldn’t be a need to override stuff. This is what `SetPartition` does. This way you are not duplicating the information and there is less code to maintain. In its `__init__()`, why not use `<=` for the comparisons? For the classcall, the default should be `check=True` since we should check user input by default.

I am not really a fan of the `from_foo()` type methods. The `_element_constructor_` is the thing that should handle that, but it probably is good that the individual functions are there and publicly listed. At least, I think the `_element_constructor_` should make a check to the appropriate type and dispatch out accordingly.

`peelable_tableaux()` has a number of doc issues, include incomplete, a code block after a `.` (not `::`), `ALGORITHM:` (with the block after not indented) not `.. ALOGIRHTM::`, and `Remark 25` (it is a name).

In `from_zero_one_matrix()`, the definition of `zero` and `one` are better within the `if check:`.

The `Diagram.pp()` does not respect the partition printing option for English versus French convention (but it implicitly claims it does).

Lastly, pyflakes; see the patchbot.

Can you also separate part of `pp()` into `_ascii_art_` (and/or maybe something that also for `_unicode_art_`), where `pp()` would simply `print(self._ascii_art_())`? This would mean `ascii_art(D)` would generate the nice pictures (and could be further manipulated).

It would be good to add a `_latex_[young_diagram]()` like `SkewPartition` that does

```python
    def _latex_(self):
        if not self._list:
            return "{\\emptyset}"

        ret = []
        for i in range(self._n_rows):
            row = []
            for j in range(self._n_cols):
                row.append("\\phantom{x}" if (i, j) in self else None)
            ret.append(row)
        from sage.combinat.output import tex_from_array
        return tex_from_array(ret)
```

This will make it easier for people to visualize it.

`_pretty_print()` should return the string, not print it. That way, e.g., `_ascii_art_` can `return ascii_art(result)`.

This returns     

```
{\def\lr#1{\multicolumn{1}{|@{\hspace{.6ex}}c@{\hspace{.6ex}}|}{\raisebox{-.3ex}{$#1$}}}
    \raisebox{-.6ex}{$\begin{array}[b]{*{5}c}\cline{6-5}
    \lr{\phantom{x}}&&&\lr{\phantom{x}}&\\
    &&&&\\\cline{5-5}
    &&\lr{\phantom{x}}&&\lr{\phantom{x}}\\\cline{5-5}
    \end{array}$}
    }
```
which is not quite right.

After playing with it, I think this looks better:

```
    {\def\lr#1{\multicolumn{1}{|@{\hspace{.6ex}}c@{\hspace{.6ex}}|}{\raisebox{-.3ex}{$#1$}}}
    \raisebox{-.6ex}{$\begin{array}[b]{*{6}{p{0.6ex}}} \cline{1-1}\cline{4-4}\cline{6-5}
    \lr{\phantom{x}}&&&\lr{\phantom{x}}&\\\cline{1-1}\cline{4-4}
    &&&&\\\cline{5-5} \cline{3-3}
    &&\lr{\phantom{x}}&&\lr{\phantom{x}}\\\cline{5-5} \cline{3-3}
    \end{array}$}
    }
```

which adds lots of `\cline`s to get the boxes and also makes each box including empty boxes a square. 

Does it make sense to just do a custom tex implementation rather than using `tex_from_array`?

56*m[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] + 30*m[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] + 16*m[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]
 + 9*m[2, 2, 2, 1, 1] + 6*m[2, 2, 2, 2] + 10*m[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] + 5*m[3, 2, 1, 1, 1]
 + 3*m[3, 2, 2, 1] + m[3, 3, 1, 1] + m[3, 3, 2] + 2*m[4, 1, 1, 1, 1] + m[4, 2, 1, 1] + m[4, 2, 2]
```
A very annoying subtlety to deal with (which we can usually just hand-wave away), but we have to deal with here. Actually, I suspect the former is the "correct" output doing:

```
sage: P5 = Permutations(5)
sage: p = P5([4,5,2,3,1])
sage: p.stanley_symmetric_function()
RecursionError
sage: P5.options.mult = 'r2l'
sage: p.stanley_symmetric_function()
56*m[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] + 26*m[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] + 12*m[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]
 + 5*m[2, 2, 2, 1, 1] + 2*m[2, 2, 2, 2] + 6*m[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
 + 3*m[3, 2, 1, 1, 1] + m[3, 2, 2, 1] + m[3, 3, 1, 1]
```
Although annoyingly this is different from `p.to_permutation_group_element().stanley_symmetric_function()`. It might just be a matter of documenting what convention you use as both are "correct."

One extra thing I noticed, you can pull out the inverse here to not redo it so many times:

```diff
+    winv = w.inverse()
     cells = [c for c in cartesian_product_iterator((range(N), range(N)))
-             if c[0]+1 < w.inverse()(c[1]+1) and c[1]+1 < w(c[0]+1)]
+             if c[0]+1 < winv(c[1]+1) and c[1]+1 < w(c[0]+1)]
```
