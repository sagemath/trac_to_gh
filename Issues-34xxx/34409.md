The code from #32744 was released with Sage 9.5 and has since been real-world tested by numerous people. It is exceedingly unlikely that we'll want to remove it, and I'm reasonably convinced that there are no disastrous bugs.

Therefore I propose to remove the experimental warning in the next release. See also [#34303 comment:18](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/34303#comment:18).

In the future, we should also change the default composition method to `EllipticCurveHom_composite`: See #34410.

I agree that unreliable code shouldn't be included. The experimental warnings I added to some of my code are basically just there to allow us to tweak the API without going through deprecations. I only submit bigger chunks of code after running them myself for a while, and generally speaking I'm fairly confident that my patches are both useful and essentially correct.

Perhaps the meaning of the experimental warning is ambiguous: It could mean pretty much anything from "no idea what this computes exactly" to "we might rename this function later". I intended it more in the latter sense.

There is an official way to do this:

> Perhaps the meaning of the experimental warning is ambiguous.


I searched for the word "experimental" in the reference manual. There are 49 instances, perhaps with different meaning of "experimental". Perhaps your intended meaning would be the most harmless.

Yes. I misunderstood your experimental warnings. 

According to the doc,  experimental warnings are mainly intended for unstable interface changes. From your ticket description, I thought you tagged the code "experimental" because you were not sure of reliability of the code, now you are because there has been no bug report. I questioned this use of experimental warnings.
