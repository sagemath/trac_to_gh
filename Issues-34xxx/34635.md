This fails with `gap_packages` installed since #34393.

However, there is another failure for the submodules. I do not think subobjects of tensor products should have a tensor product structure.

If I take `V (x) W` and the submodule `V (x) w` for some fixed `w \in W`, what is the tensor product structure on that? I don't see how to make sense of that.
