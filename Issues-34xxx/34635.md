This fails with `gap_packages` installed since #34393.

However, there is another failure for the submodules. I do not think subobjects of tensor products should have a tensor product structure.

I disagree

But it should be documented

If I take `V (x) W` and the submodule `V (x) w` for some fixed `w \in W`, what is the tensor product structure on that? I don't see how to make sense of that.

What are the morphisms in the category of tensor products of modules?

Let me elaborate slightly on this. I believe we agree that the tensor product of finite dimensional modules is equivalent to the category of modules (over a (commutative?) ring `R`). It just has a little extra information about how the module was constructed (which is important for things like graded modules and representations).
