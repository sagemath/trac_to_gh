New changes in sphinx requires new attributes to be defined. Supporting this change introduces non fatal error and warnings when building with older version of sphinx.

Therefore we think it is time to upgrade sphinx in sage.

The ticket update 
* sphinx to 5.2.3 
* sphinxcontrib_websupport to 1.2.4 (no other sphinxcontrib package seem out of date)
* imagesize to 1.4.1 (required dependency)

I agree! But that seems a formidable task (unless we just leave the consequential "broken doc" at it is).

> I wanted to ask whether you had an idea why there are subsection for say "plane conics" but not "curves"?


It is because of the `maxdepth: 2`. See 

```
Plane conics
============

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2 
```
Hence it is normal. The real problem seems that definitions doc is regarded as content headings. I don't know if this is a feature of the upgraded sphinx or a problem of `sage_autodoc`...

Object definitions in TOC is a new standard feature of the upgraded Sphinx. But this changes our doc in an unintended way. This is fixed now in #34706. Needs review.
