I have no clue what's going on here.

```
sage: P = ParkingFunctions(3)
sage: f = P([1,1,1])
sage: g = ParkingFunction([1,1,1])
sage: f in P
True
sage: g in P
True
sage: f in list(P)
True
sage: g in list(P)
True
sage: f in set(P)

sage: g in set(P)
False

note that `f` and `g` have different parents:

```
sage: f.parent()
Parking functions of size 3
sage: g.parent()
Parking functions
```
now you have `f in set(P)`, so all parents of elements of `set(P)` should be `Parking functions of size 3`. So `g` is not there as it has a different parent.
