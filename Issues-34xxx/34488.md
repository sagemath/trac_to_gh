Negative on removing values_list and items_list. The iterators are really quite unreliable on a weak dictionary, because the content of a weak dict can change over time in unexpected ways, not just through explicit deletes on the dictionary.

The list versions have much better defined behaviour: there, at least at the time of the call, strong references to the values get fixed in the list.

It also means that `[do_something_with(a) for a in D.values_list()]` and `[do_something_with(a) for a in D.itervalues(D)]` can actually behave differently, because the second one has more activity by `do_something_with` injected in between the iteration over `D`, whereas the first one starts with fixing all the values of `D` with strong references before anything is done with them. So the change of `values` and `items` as proposed here may cause changes in behaviour (and bugs to surface?).

Iterating over weak dictionaries is a little ill-defined conceptiually anyway, because you're never sure if something is in there. So I think it's in principle fine to change the use a little bit, but you need to be prepared that it can cause quite unexpected changes in behaviour, of a kind that is quite likely not covered by the doctests.

Sorry to revert the status on the ticket, but I think there is a mismatch in the translation currently made:

In Py3, `D.keys()`, `D.values()` and `D.items()` return *view* objects. The corresponding iterators are obtained through `iter(D.keys())` etc. The view objects act as (multi)set views on the content.

Compare:

```
sage: D=dict(enumerate(range(10)));
sage: I=D.keys()
sage: [a for a in I] == [a for a in I]
True
sage: I=iter(D.keys())
sage: [a for a in I] == [a for a in I]
False
```
So I'm not so sure that changing `keys()` to return `iterkeys()` rather than a list is such an improvement: the (old) list implementation actually behaves better for the test above. The proper Py2.7 method would be `viewkeys()`, but that never made it into our `WeakDictionary` implementation. See https://peps.python.org/pep-0469/
