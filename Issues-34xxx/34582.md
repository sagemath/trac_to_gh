A command like `A.<x,y,z> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ, degrees=(3,1,2))` raises `ValueError: the generators should be ordered in increasing degree`. I think this is artificial, and if it's important for the code to have sorted generators, the code should handle it, not the user.

There is also a bug that perhaps can be handled in this ticket:

```
sage: A = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(3), names=('h10', 'h11', 'b10', 'h20', 'b11', 'b20'), degrees=((1, 4), (1, 12), (2, 12), (1, 16), (2, 36), (2, 48)))
sage: A.inject_variables()
Defining h10, h11, b10, h20, b11, b20
sage: B = A.cdg_algebra({h20: h10*h11})
sage: B.cohomology_algebra(49)  #  works fine
Commutative Differential Graded Algebra with generators ('x0', 'x1', 'x2', 'x3', 'x4', 'x5') in degrees (5, 13, 14, 22, 30, 38) with relations [x0*x1, x0*x3, x0*x1*x2, x1*x3 + x0*x4, x0*x1*x3, x0*x2*x3, x1*x4, x3^2, x0*x1*x2^2, x0*x1*x4, x1*x2*x3 + x0*x2*x4, x0*x3^2] over Finite Field of size 3 with differential:
   x0 --> 0
   x1 --> 0
   x2 --> 0
   x3 --> 0
   x4 --> 0
   x5 --> 0
sage: B.cohomology_algebra(50)  #  doesn't work
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Input In [79], in <cell line: 1>()
----> 1 B.cohomology_algebra(Integer(50))

...

TypeError: x must be a list of the right length
```
This doesn't happen in the corresponding singly graded case, where each degree is replaced by the total degree: `A = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(3), names=('h10', 'h11', 'b10', 'h20', 'b11', 'b20'), degrees=(5, 13, 14, 17, 38, 50))`. `B.cohomology_generators(n)` also works for values of `n` well past 50. There is an algebra generator and a cohomology generator in total degree 50, by the way.

Why is the differential ending up as zero? It should send `x6` to `x1*x5`.

So when you call its `differential `method, it just returns that already existing map.

I think what you mean to do is this:

About the ordering, i think you are right: it would be preferable to be able to give arbitrary orderings, and let sage handle it internally. However, the current code relies on this assumption in several places, so i will need to look at it carefully. Will do it in the following days (or weeks, if life/work gets in the way).

That makes sense. It bothers me that this doesn't work (with definitions as above):

```
C.cdg_algebra({x6:x1*x5})
Commutative Differential Graded Algebra with generators ... over Finite Field of size 3 with differential:
   x0 --> 0
   x1 --> 0
   x2 --> 0
   x3 --> 0
   x4 --> 0
   x5 --> 0
   x6 --> 0
```
In particular, the documentation for `cdg_algebra` says

```
Construct a differential graded commutative algebra from "self" by
specifying a differential.
```
It seems like this method cannot be used for an algebra which believes it already has a differential, and similarly `differential` can't be used to define a new differential. It looks like `differential` is documented this way, but `cdg_algebra` is just inherited from `GCAlgebra`. I'm thinking that we could instead have a base class like `GCAlgebra` but which does not include `cdg_algebra`, and then `GCAlgebra` would inherit from it and define `cdg_algebra`, while `DifferentialGCAlgebra` would inherit from it without defining `cdg_algebra`.

Maybe also `cohomology_algebra` should return a `GCAlgebra` rather than a `DifferentialGCAlgebra`, or at least provide this as an option.

I was trying to model the first few terms of a particular spectral sequence, so I was trying to define a differential on a cohomology algebra. This feels like a natural thing to try to do.

What I'm doing is very explicit and concrete: a spectral sequence of algebras in which I know the first few differentials, and I was trying to understand whether a particular class survives, so I was trying to see what other classes might be able to hit it.

Here is a slightly simpler example than the one I was trying:

```python
p = 2
TOP = 20

names = ['h10', 'h11', 'h20']
degrees = [(1,0,1), (1,0,2), (0, 1, 3)]
total_degs = [sum(x) for x in degrees]

# e1_graded = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(p), names=names, degrees=degrees)
# cohomology_algebra doesn't work with multigrading, so use total degrees instead:
e1_fake = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(p), names=names, degrees=total_degs)
(h10, h11, h20) = e1_fake.gens()
e1 = e1_fake.cdg_algebra({h20: h10*h11})

# would be ideal to have e2 be the cohomology algebra of e1, but
# it doesn't work that well, so recreate it by hand.
# e2_graded = e1.cohomology_algebra(TOP)
# e2_graded_base = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(p), names=('h10, h11, b20'), degrees=((1,0,1), (1,0,2), (0,2,6)))
e2_graded_fake = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(p), names=('h10, h11, b20'), degrees=(2, 3, 8))
(h10, h11, b20) = e2_graded_fake.gens()
e2_graded = e2_graded_fake.quotient(e2_graded_fake.ideal(h10*h11))
e2 = e2_graded.cdg_algebra({b20: h11**3})

# e3_graded = e2.cohomology_algebra(TOP)
# e3_graded_base = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(p), names=('h10, h11, h10b20, b20b20'), degrees=((1,0,1), (1,0,2), (1,2,7), (0,4,12)))
e3_graded_fake = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(p), names=('h10, h11, h10b20, b20b20'), degrees=(2, 3, 10, 16))
(h10, h11, h10b20, b20b20) = e3_graded_fake.gens()
e3_graded = e3_graded_fake.quotient(e3_graded_fake.ideal(h10*h11, h10b20**2 + h10**2 * b20b20, h11*h10b20))
```
