Currently, Sage cannot compute the transformation matrix when reducing *definite* binary quadratic forms:

```sage
sage: BinaryQF([1,2,3]).reduced_form(transformation=True)
# ...
NotImplementedError: reduction of definite binary quadratic forms with transformation=True is not implemented
```

We can use PARI's `qfbredsl2()` to make this work.

I don't understand why `content` becomes a cached method here. If `discriminant` is already one, dividing it by 4 should be costless. Could you provide timing to justify this change?

Instead of `self.content() == 1` I would rather use `self.content().is_one()`.

To my mind, all changes similar to

```diff
-        Return if ``self`` is identically zero.
+        Determine if ``self`` is identically zero.
```
makes the specification less precise. The word "determines" does not describe the output of the function.

Could you provide timing to justify this change?\n\nI think the diff you're looking at is cut in an unfortunate place\u2009\u2014\u2009the content isn't the discriminant divided by four! The reasoning behind the changes to caching (commit `7a058f3026c`) is:\n\n- Replace `gcd([a,b,c])` by `.content()` in `.is_primitive()` because that's what it is.\n- Move the `@cached_method` up from `.is_primitive()` to `.content()` because it's more general and `.is_one()` is cheap.\n- Remove `@cached_method` from `.is_zero()` because `.content()` is now cached and `.is_zero()` is cheap.\n\n> To my mind, all changes similar to\n> \n> ```diff\n> -        Return if ``self`` is identically zero.\n> +        Determine if ``self`` is identically zero.\n> ```\n> makes the specification less precise.

I think the diff you're looking at is cut in an unfortunate place — the content isn't the discriminant divided by four! The reasoning behind the changes to caching (commit `7a058f3026c`) is:

- Replace `gcd([a,b,c])` by `.content()` in `.is_primitive()` because that's what it is.
- Move the `@cached_method` up from `.is_primitive()` to `.content()` because it's more general and `.is_one()` is cheap.
- Remove `@cached_method` from `.is_zero()` because `.content()` is now cached and `.is_zero()` is cheap.

My problem with "return if X" was that it can be read as `if X then return [a thing?] else [catch fire?]`. But I don't really care; surely noone will be confused by either phrasing.

Oh I see. Thanks for the explanation. I should have looked more carefully at the final code rather than the diff.

I agree that the initial sentence was not perfect either. In most places we can read <code>Return whether \`\`self\`\` is identically zero.</code> which I like better.
