Currently, Sage cannot compute the transformation matrix when reducing *definite* binary quadratic forms:

```sage
sage: BinaryQF([1,2,3]).reduced_form(transformation=True)
# ...
NotImplementedError: reduction of definite binary quadratic forms with transformation=True is not implemented
```

We can use PARI's `qfbredsl2()` to make this work.

I don't understand why `content` becomes a cached method here. If `discriminant` is already one, dividing it by 4 should be costless. Could you provide timing to justify this change?

Instead of `self.content() == 1` I would rather use `self.content().is_one()`.

To my mind, all changes similar to

```diff
-        Return if ``self`` is identically zero.
+        Determine if ``self`` is identically zero.
```
makes the specification less precise. The word "determines" does not describe the output of the function.

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A6):
> I don't understand why `content` becomes a cached method here. If `discriminant` is already one, dividing it by 4 should be costless. Could you provide timing to justify this change?

I think the diff you're looking at is cut in an unfortunate place — the content isn't the discriminant divided by four! The reasoning behind the changes to caching (commit `7a058f3026c`) is:

- Replace `gcd([a,b,c])` by `.content()` in `.is_primitive()` because that's what it is.
- Move the `@cached_method` up from `.is_primitive()` to `.content()` because it's more general and `.is_one()` is cheap.
- Remove `@cached_method` from `.is_zero()` because `.content()` is now cached and `.is_zero()` is cheap.

My problem with "return if X" was that it can be read as `if X then return [a thing?] else [catch fire?]`. But I don't really care; surely noone will be confused by either phrasing.

Oh I see. Thanks for the explanation. I should have looked more carefully at the final code rather than the diff.

I agree that the initial sentence was not perfect either. In most places we can read <code>Return whether \`\`self\`\` is identically zero.</code> which I like better.
