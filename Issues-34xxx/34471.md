Since Sage 9.7.rc0, `FiniteRankFreeModule`'s are endowed with a `tensor_product` method, thanks to #31276. However, this does not work with the dual:

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 2, name='M')
sage: M.tensor_product(M.tensor_module(1,1))  # OK
Free module of type-(2,1) tensors on the Rank-2 free module M 
 over the Integer Ring
sage: M.tensor_product(M.dual())
...
AttributeError: 'ExtPowerDualFreeModule_with_category' object has 
 no attribute 'tensor_type'
```
The method `ExtPowerDualFreeModule.tensor_type` is implemented here, 
which fixes the issue:

```
sage: M.tensor_product(M.dual())
Free module of type-(1,1) tensors on the Rank-2 free module M 
 over the Integer Ring
```

Only if you plan to do `M.tensor_product(M.tensor_module(0, 1))`. 
You well get an error then.

It does make `tensor_product` return a wrong result instead of giving an error when one of the factors is an exterior power
