It seems like overkill to introduce another global object `FreeGradedAlgebra` just to differentiate between when we are thinking of this as a graded object versus ungraded for the category of the default homset. I think we need to educate people on the need to specify the category they want their morphisms to be in, at least when it is prudent to make backwards incompatible changes such as this one. Or if I wanted to implement a Hopf algebra structure like the tensor algebra (which are isomorphic).

Personally, I would also like to see polynomial rings know they are graded (commutative) algebras.

Can't users already pass the category to the constructor?

To the constructor of `FreeAlgebra`, no, they cannot. This would be something else I would add.
