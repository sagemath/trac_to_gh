Should do the same for the (classical) Hall algebra:

```
sage: R.<q> = ZZ[]
sage: H = HallAlgebra(R, q)
sage: H.category()
Category of algebras with basis over Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Integer Ring
```

Personally, I would also like to see polynomial rings know they are graded (commutative) algebras.

Can't users already pass the category to the constructor?

To the constructor of `FreeAlgebra`, no, they cannot. This would be something else I would add.

I think that would be very bad default. That would stop polynomial evaluation morphisms from being morphisms in the default homset

It is potentially a huge can of worms. Although we can make changes in the appropriate methods so that the requisite morphisms are done in a valid homset.
