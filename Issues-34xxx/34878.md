(from [#21003 comment:136](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/21003#comment:136))

... for use with methods that take row indices as input, such as `row`, `row_bounds`, `remove_constraint`.

If a backend does not map a constraint to a unique new row (or `check_redundant=True` and the constraint is discarded by the frontend), the method may return `None`.

We also fix a longstanding bug in how empty constraints are handled in `add_constraint`. 

The changed interface (an optional return value) is backward-compatible with user code.

We also add a Feature CVXOPT so that the backend gets tested again.

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
I'm sorry to comment late.  I have two (quite orthogonal) suggestions:

* I think that `add_constraint` should return a list of constraints added, or `None`.
    * `None` should be returned if and only if the backend does not provide a means to remove this constraint again.  
    * The empty list should be returned if and only if the constraint was redundant.
    * Otherwise, removing the constraints using `remove_constraint` yields the original MILP.
* possibly, it would make sense to return this list only on demand, eg., have a flag `return_indices`.  I am guessing that this would be better for interactive use, and it also means that only very few doctests would have to be modified.

Thank you!

Actually, it would be practical if the following too would also work, don't you think  (Ideally also with `False`, or `True` as argument)?

If you agree, it won't be hard to fix.  I don't know whether one can add these as constraints to all backends, but we could simply ignore the first and raise a `MIPSolverException` for the second.

This would make (my) user code much more readable.

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='GLPK')
sage: p.add_constraint(p.linear_functions_parent()(0 <= 0))
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: at least one of "max" or "min" must be set

sage: p.add_constraint(p.linear_functions_parent()(1 <= 0))
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: at least one of "max" or "min" must be set

The problem is that for `f = p.linear_constraints_parent()(1 <= 0)` we have neither have `f.equations()` nor `f.inequalities()`.

The following does work (also for GLPK):

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='SCIP')
sage: f = p.linear_functions_parent()(1 - 0)
sage: p.add_constraint(f, max=0, return_indices=True)
[0]
sage: p.show()
Maximization:
  

Constraints:
  c1: <= -1.0
Variables:
```
I am not sure how reliable this is.  Also, shouldn't the max be shown?
