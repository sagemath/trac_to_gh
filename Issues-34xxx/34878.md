(from #21003#comment:136)

... for use with methods that take row indices as input, such as `row`, `row_bounds`, `remove_constraint`.

If a backend does not map a constraint to a unique new row (or `check_redundant=True` and the constraint is discarded by the frontend), the method may return `None`.
