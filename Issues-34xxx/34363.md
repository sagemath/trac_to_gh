In general, Docker is slower (for both io and cpu) then WSL2. How much depends on the particular use case and the setup (e.g. whether the files are located in the windows or linux env).

In general, I'm skeptical if the devcontainer env should be indeed the recommended installation and development method on windows.

For installation, it is not clear to me how you would use the "installed" devcontainer in your own projects (i.e. outside of the vscode instance that hosts the sage source tree). For this, wouldn't it make more sense to recommend that people create a devcontainer file in their own project folder, that references a prebuild sage devcontainer?

For development, I would still favor wsl over docker for the performance. Moreover, I don't see why this should be a windows-specific recommendation in either case.

Why? The current windows installation is wsl + as you normally install in linux. The thing that you replace now is "normally install in linux" by "use a docker container", while keeping the wsl part. So I don't see why we shouldn't recommend using a docker container also for normal linux dev/install then.

Yes, although the overhead is smaller then with the old legacy hyperv backend.

Do you have a reference for this at hand so we can add it to the installation guide?

The difference is that neither WSL nor Docker-in-WSL are native Windows.

I see the key benefit of the devcontainer solution for Windows that it isolates the Windows user from having to learn about WSL, Linux distributions etc. So it reduces the learning curve for people who want to get started with Sage.

Of course, devcontainers also have general benefits that make them a good option for consideration on other platforms. But I don't see a reason why we would recommend it to users over what we recommend now - the build from source.

Users who just start with Sage do not need any of this. 
They can just run Sage in the devcontainer of SAGE_ROOT and save their Jupyter notebooks  somewhere, maybe in a subdirectory.

Of course, we know that for running the `downstream-...` devcontainer, one does not really need the whole source tree of Sage. But it gives a convenient transition: If it turns out they do have to make changes to Sage, they can just switch from a `downstream-...` devcontainer to a `develop-...` devcontainer without having to change the rest of their workflow.

Creating a "project" using Sage is far beyond what most Sage users do: Note that there are only a few dozens of published user packages ("projects") out there. #34286 is about making this easier.

The doc structure could be, as for other platforms,

```
   No development:

       Alternative 1:

       Alternative 2:

   Development:

       Alternative 1:

       Alternative 2:
```
We may put the recommended in alternative 1."No development alternative 1" would be the recommended approach for most users.

I would put "VS Code + downstream-devcontainer" approach to "No development alternative 1".

I would put "VS Code + WSL" approach to "Development alternative 1". Docker is really not necessary in sage development and conceptually more difficult than WSL, I think.

For "VS Code + downstream-devcontainer" approach, could we remove the git clone part (which is just to get `devcontainer.json`)?

Sorry for being imprecise. I meant "project" in the sense of "anything that lives outside of the sagemath folder", e.g. ones own jupyter notebooks or similar stuff. To make it precise: how do I contribute to https://github.com/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds using the devcontainer approach?

In general, I like the idea. Maybe we can go even one step further and remove the numbering completely, as there is no clear general hierarchy between the options, but the preferred one depends on the situation. So simply something like "Option: Devcontainer" and "Option: Manual compilation from source in WSL".

I would also move the good clarifications by Matthias on when to use which option to the beginning of the decision tree, not after the steps.

No objections if you want to make these edits to the structure.

Important point to keep: The devcontainer approach also works on machines where you can run Docker but not WSL. (I do not know how common this scenario is.)
