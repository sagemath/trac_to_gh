```sage
sage: EllipticCurve([5,5]).multiplication_by_m_isogeny(-1)
# ...
AssertionError: bug in multiplication_by_m_isogeny()
```

```sage
sage: EllipticCurve([5,5]).multiplication_by_m_isogeny(-2)
# ...
NotImplementedError: Kohel's algorithm currently only supports cyclic isogenies (except for [2])
```

```sage
sage: EllipticCurve([5,5]).multiplication_by_m_isogeny(-3)
# ...
ValueError: n must be a positive integer (or -1 or -2)
```

All of these are because `.multiplication_by_m_isogeny()` calls `.torsion_polynomial()` with `m`, which may be negative, rather than `abs(m)`. As the last error message indicates, the values `-1` and `-2` additionally have special meaning for `.torsion_polynomial()`, which made debugging a bit more confusing...
