For your info:

- `-undefined dynamic_lookup` is a usual flag (in macos) given to the dynamic linker (dyld) to "dynamically lookup undefined symbols".

- The only webpage I found that explains "chained fixups" is: https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/iOS15LaunchTime

Still I don't understand the warning message and "why this has begun happening" :)
