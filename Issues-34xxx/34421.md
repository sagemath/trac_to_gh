after #33866 update, I get an error on Gentoo.

As it turns out, jupyter_jsmol installation process fetches more js stuff than there is in the tarball:

and it hangs - even tough the network is OK.
Also reported [on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/emnDzvu5vR4) with Arch Linux.

A straight `./sage --pip install jupyter_jsmol` is almost instant success.

this does not seem to change anything (same `x not in list` error with `JUPYTER_PACKAGING_SKIP_NPM=1`, hang with `yarn` without the latter).

I tried overriding the system `yarn` with `src/bin/yarn` pointing to `/bin/true`. Then build finishes, and 
tests with `jsmol` pass. 

I'm however suspicious of it being non-working, still.
Is there a visual test I can do?

OK, it's actually in the docs, how to test jsmol - in notebook one has to run

```
plot3d(lambda u,v:(u^2+v^2)/4-2,(-2,2),(-2,2)).show(viewer="jmol")
```
and see it producing stuff.
It works for my crude yarn->true workaround.
