This is indeed cleaner.

The algorithm is clever. Do you know if it possible to generate such subsequence in `O(n log n)` ? In the data generated by the algo, only `r[-1]` is guaranteed to be the last element of a longest increasing subsequence.

> Indeed for a single sequence. Not sure how to extend to find all longest sequences.

There could be exponentially many longest sequences. Pick `p = [2,1,4,3,6,5,...,2n,2n-1]`. Then there are `2^n` longest increasing sequences (they are of length `n`). Note that building the automaton that stores them all is what Nadia proposed in #31451. Not sure about complexity, but it is for sure polynomial.

It would be interesting to implement something fast to count the number of such sequence. This could be obtained for example from #31451 as the coefficient `(0,n+1)` of the `n+1`-th power of the adjacency matrix of `D`.
