Dear sage people,

`plot` function accepts functions or lists of functions as an input, and proudly presents it as an example. However, the behavior of `parametric_plot` does not parallel it. `parametric_plot` accepts tuples of two-three and lists of 3 (what for i don't know), according to the code

```
if not isinstance(f, (tuple, list)) or len(f) != 3:
  raise ValueError("f must be a list, tuple, or vector of length 3")
```

To give an example:

```
plot([t^n for n in [1..3]], (t, 0, 1))
```
outputs a beautiful plot of power functions.
On the other hand

```
parametric_plot([(t,t^n) for n in [1..3]], (t, 0, 1))
```
outputs a value error.

This feels inconsistent, and plotting an array of functions is very useful feature. I don't know if I shall report is as a defect or as enhancement, I'm very new here. I haven't seen anything on that. For my project currently I'll w/a that with sum of plots (which is great) but plotting of iterables in `plot` function is a great thing i believe is worth to make a consistent pattern.
