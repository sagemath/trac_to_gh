The problem was that in the namespace of `sage.docs.instancedoc`, there was no name `instancedoc` since it was to be created when first used (as it was `lazy_import`-ed) and not used yet.

My branch just provides an easy solution.

I changed the file to a python file too. When I did this, the old cython `.so` file was not removed automatically. So sage kept loading the module from the old cython file, and spitting errors. I manually deleted the old files ('.so' and '.c' files). Perhaps this is a pitfall of the editable install?

I see. I am getting used to the editable build. It is nice to see the C file beside a Cython file.

Thank you.
