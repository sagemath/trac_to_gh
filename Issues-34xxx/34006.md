Currently the Killing form does not work for a Lie subalgebra since the `adjoint_matrix()` of an element is not returning coordinates in the basis for the subalgebra.

It was also noted that the `adjoint_matrix()` is returning the transpose of what it should be in order to define a representation. We fix this on this ticket since we also want to fix it for the subalgebras as well.

We also fix another issue that the generators of a Lie subalgebra are not elements of the subalgebra, but instead belong to the ambient algebra.

Here is a fix that is fairly simple. Unfortunately I don't know of a more general solution then the whack-a-mole way of fixing such issues as we come across them.

See also #33836 for a similar issue.
