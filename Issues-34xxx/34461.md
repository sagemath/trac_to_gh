To discuss the notion of "set inclusion" in the presence of coercion, we need to be able to discover inclusion morphisms (= injective coercion morphisms).

One mechanism to model subsets is through facade sets. But the relation of facade parents to the parent that they are a facade to is not known to the coercion system.

By registering a `FacadeInclusionMorphism` as a coercion, we can make this relation discoverable.

```
sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
sage: from sage.categories.morphism import FacadeInclusionMorphism
sage: S = Sets().Facade().example(); S
An example of facade set: the monoid of positive integers
sage: iota = FacadeInclusionMorphism(Hom(S, ZZ))
sage: iota.register_as_coercion()
sage: pushout(S, ZZ)
Integer Ring
```
