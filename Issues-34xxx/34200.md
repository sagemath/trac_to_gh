Right now `./configure && make sphinx` finishes successfully, but the `sphinx` log file says

```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement importlib-metadata>=4.4; python_version < "3.10" (from sphinx) (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for importlib-metadata>=4.4; python_version < "3.10"
```
We can fix this by adding `importlib_metadata` to the `sphinx/dependencies` file.
