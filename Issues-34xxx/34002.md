Let `C` be a projective plane curve with equation `F(x, y, z) = 0` of degree `d`. The method `fundamental_group` computes the fundamental group of the complement. When the point `[0:1:0]` belongs to the curve it may produce wrong results. 

The computation works as follows. Consider the affine curve `f(x, y) := F(x, y, 1) = 0` and compute its fundamental group via the projection `(x, y) -> x`. In this group we have an ordered system of generators `t1`, ..., `td` and to pass from the fundamental group of the complement of the affine curve to the fundamental group of the complement of the projective curve it is enough to add as relation the ordered product of the generators.

In order to apply it directly we need `[0:1:0]` outside the curve which is equivalent to have `f` to be of degree `d` in the variable `y` but up to now the method only checks if the maximal coefficient of `y` is a non-zero constant.

The following example shows the problem. It computes the fundamental group of a quintic which is known to be finite and non-abelian by Degtyarev.

```
sage: P.<x, y, z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
sage: f = z^2*y^3 - z*(33*x*z + 2*x^2 + 8*z^2)*y^2 + (21*z^2 + 21*x*z - x^2)*(z^2 + 11*x*z - x^2)*y + (x - 18*z)*(z^2 + 11*x*z - x^2)^2
sage: C = Curve(f)
sage: C.fundamental_group()
Finitely presented group < x0 | x0^3 >
```

If we make a change of coordinates to avoid this problem, everything is OK

```
sage: f1 = f(z=z+y)
sage: g1p = Curve(f1).fundamental_group()
Singularity detected. Abort Sirocco
sage: g1p.order()
320
```
