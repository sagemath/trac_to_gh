On Apple clang version 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5), building `g++ -std=gnu++11 -g -O2  -c mcube.cpp` appears to hang forever.

We work around this by reducing the optimization level on macOS.

A vaguely related question: after installing `rubiks`, if I do `./sage -t src/sage/groups/perm_gps/cubegroup.py`, then it runs tests marked `optional - rubiks`, but it says `Features detected for doctesting: <blank>` at the end. The appropriate \"Feature\" says that rubiks is present. Why doesn't it list `rubiks` among the features?",
