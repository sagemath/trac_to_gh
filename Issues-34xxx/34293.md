On Apple clang version 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5), building `g++ -std=gnu++11 -g -O2  -c mcube.cpp` appears to hang forever.

We work around this by reducing the optimization level on macOS.

When `rubiks` is installed through the Sage distribution, the Sage doctester sees the installation record in `local/lib/sage/installed/` and adds rubiks to the optional tags. It does not run the Feature test.
