Hi Antoine! I think that to make this works, you need to implement the `characteristic` method of a ring over a base.

I investigated a bit further and, to make your above code work, I think that you simply need to implement the characteristic method for the class `sage.rings.ring_extensions.RingExtension_generic`:

```python
    def characteristic(self):
        return self._backend.characteristic()
```

I cc'ed Xavier here because he implemented extensions of rings and therefore he might know a better way to solve this.

I am so stupid.

I think this can help resolve any ambiguities.

Maybe, you should also have an example `B.over(A)` where `A` and `B` have different characteristic.
For example, I suggest to replace your last example by

```
    sage: E = Fp(7).over(ZZ)
    sage: E.characteristic()
    7
```

Also you should add a doctest (in the section TESTS) demonstrating that the bug noticed in this ticket is fixed.

Copy that! Thank you for the review.

Does that mean I can merge this branch into that of Drinfeld modules? I need the patch to fix some bugs. Or should I wait for something else?

Best,
