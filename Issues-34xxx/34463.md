This will make it easier to write code that works uniformly for all kinds of quotient rings.

(Example: Polynomial quotient rings currently do not have the `.cover()` and `.defining_ideal()` methods, which are very useful when writing generic quotient-ring code.)

There seems to be a test failure

```
File "sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/hom_velusqrt.py", line 829, in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.hom_velusqrt.EllipticCurveHom_velusqrt
Failed example:
    any(map(check, psi.codomain().isomorphisms(phi.codomain())))
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```
and some linting failures

```
sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/hom_velusqrt.py:325:9: E306 expected 1 blank line before a nested definition, found 0
sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/hom_velusqrt.py:327:9: E306 expected 1 blank line before a nested definition, found 0
sage/functions/special.py:867:12: W605 invalid escape sequence '\p'
sage/functions/special.py:867:19: W605 invalid escape sequence '\p'
sage/algebras/clifford_algebra.py:2987:21: E721 do not compare types, use 'isinstance()'
```

The linting problems don't look like they're due to this ticket, but I'm not sure about the test failure.
