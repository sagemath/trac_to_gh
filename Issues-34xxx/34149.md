by the truckload everywhere (not just structure) and repeatedly. Suggested replacement is `sphinx.ext.autodoc.directive.DocumenterBridge.record_dependencies`. But it doesn't prevent the documentation to build unlike the previous two.

All changes in the branch should work with sphinx 4.4 and 4.5 as they concern things deprecated in sphinx 4.0 or earlier.

Depends on #34109

I haven't experienced trouble so far apart from sphinx just going up under my nose on Gentoo. What do you have problem with? For the record, I ended up splitting sage-doc as its own thing at about sage 9.5 because my work arounds for monolithic build where just looking they could break any time.
