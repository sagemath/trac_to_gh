This unfortunately doesn't "just work".
On Debian stable this branch leads to

```
[curl-7.84.0] configure: error: select TLS backend(s) or disable TLS with --without-ssl.
[curl-7.84.0] 
[curl-7.84.0] Select from these:
[curl-7.84.0] 
[curl-7.84.0]   --with-amissl
[curl-7.84.0]   --with-bearssl
[curl-7.84.0]   --with-gnutls
[curl-7.84.0]   --with-mbedtls
[curl-7.84.0]   --with-nss
[curl-7.84.0]   --with-openssl (also works for BoringSSL and libressl)
[curl-7.84.0]   --with-rustls
[curl-7.84.0]   --with-schannel
[curl-7.84.0]   --with-secure-transport
[curl-7.84.0]   --with-wolfssl
[curl-7.84.0] 
```

and this is the usual OpenSSL dance here, which I don't know how to do.

IMHO we cannot just disable TLS.
