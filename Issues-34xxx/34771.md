<a id='comment:13'></a>This is doing way too much conversions

```
H = libgap(aut_m).Intersection2(aut_B_aug)
rt_transversal = aut_B_aug.RightTransversal(H).List().sage()
rt_transversal = [PermutationGroupElement(g) for g in rt_transversal if str(g) != '()']
rt_transversal = [[a-1 for a in g.domain()] for g in rt_transversal]
rt_transversal = [g + list(xrange(len(g), n))
```
It would be nicer as

```
H = libgap(aut_m).Intersection2(aut_B_aug)
rt_transversal = aut_B_aug.RightTransversal(H)
rt_transversal = [[int(a) - 1 for a in g.ListPerm(n)] for g in rt_transversal if not g.IsOne()]
```
