```
In eclib version v20210310 the code for saturating points on elliptic curves over QQ was greatly improved, but a small logic error was introduced leading to the following:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 0, 0, -17607, -889490])
sage: Q = E([-82,54])
sage: E.saturation([2*Q])
([(-82 : 54 : 1)], 2, 2.36570863272098)
sage: E.saturation([2*Q], max_prime=10)
([(11649/16 : -1234751/64 : 1)], 1, 9.46283453088392)
```
The point list [2*Q] is certainly not saturated at 2, and when no saturation bound is given this is detected automaically OK, but when any bound is given it is not.  (The reason, for those interested, is that the code in eclib treats primes dividing Tamagawa numbers separately, and here 2 is such a prime.)

I don't see a way to fix this in Sage, but I have fixed the relevant bugs in eclib and made a new release which is [https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/releases/download/20220621/eclib-20220621.tar.bz2](https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/releases/download/20220621/eclib-20220621.tar.bz2)

I hope I can get the new eclib version working more easily than last time (the last version was 20210625, so almost exactly a year ago).

In my new branch (based on current develop branch) I updated the package-version.txt and fixed the checksum.ini, after putting the new tar.bz2 file into upstream/.  I deleted the patch in the patches directory since those changes are in the upstream source now. Then "sage -i -c eclib" worked fine, all checks passed.  But when I run anything relevant I get errors:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,-17607,-889490])
sage: E.rank()
```
gives a segfault.

The new version should be completely compatible, i.e. no changes are needed to the interface.

```
./sage -t src/sage/libs/eclib/constructor.py
```
is fine, but 

```
./sage -t src/sage/libs/eclib/interface.py
```
causes a lot of segfaults, e.g.

```
sage -t --warn-long 94.9 --random-seed=269743671597642066957592066085711042976 src/sage/libs/eclib/interface.py

seems that output changed, thus doctests fail, e.g.

```
File "src/sage/libs/eclib/mwrank.pyx", line 589, in sage.libs.eclib.mwrank._mw.__init__
Failed example:
    EQ.search(1)
Expected:
    P1 = [0:1:0]         is torsion point, order 1
    P1 = [-3:0:1]         is generator number 1
    saturating up to 20...Saturation index bound (for points of good reduction)  = 3
    Reducing saturation bound from given value 20 to computed index bound 3
    Checking saturation at [ 2 3 ]
...

Got:
    P1 = [0:1:0]         is torsion point, order 1
    P1 = [-3:0:1]         is generator number 1
    saturating up to 20...Saturation index bound (for points of good reduction)  = 3
    Reducing saturation bound from given value 20 to computed index bound 3
    Tamagawa index primes are [ 2 ]
    Checking saturation at [ 2 3 ]
...
```

so the new output has the line `Tamagawa index primes are [ 2 ]`, and the old does not.

Yes of course, I did not mark the ticket as ready for review yet.  But yesterday I could not even test it for the reasons I mentioned. I'll reinstall today and try again.

But thanks for testing.   The explanation for the difference in "Tamagawa index primes" is that these should include primes dividing the number of real components (which is 2 here) as well as the p-adic components (which are all 1 here).

I'll fix the doctests once I can get the new code to work.  I don't know why it is giving me segfaults.  "sage -mwrank" works OK.

One also needs to deal with potentially outdated eclibs provided by the system.
Meaning that you have to decide whether to allow the older versions at all

currently 20210625 is allowed from the system, and no other versions (cf. #31443)

Anyway, build/pkgs/eclib/spkg-configure.m4 has to be updated.
E.g. if you only want to allow 20220621, you simply need to replace the corresponding value
in this file.

If you want to allow more, it'd be more work.
One can also do testing for eclib bugs there, and rejecting buggy system eclib
(that's what we do with Pari).



Indeed, testing this on Fedora 34 (which has 20210625) and getting
