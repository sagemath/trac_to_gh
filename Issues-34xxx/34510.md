The current `IntegerVector.check()` method only checks for the positivity of each element. This adds a check for specified totals (`n`) and lengths (`k`).

This ticket also allows for any ``collections.abc.Sequence`` object to be checked as an integer vector.

I would just check that it belongs to the parent. The first test should be done by that anyways.

Also, for the error message:

```
f"{self} is not an element of {self.parent()}"
