`(z; q)_{\infty}` has a nice expression for its coefficients in `z`. We implement this very important series as a lazy Laurent series.

We implement the Euler function `(q; q)_{\infty}` as a lazy Laurent series in `q` as well.

Depends on #32324

After doing this, we might want to move the construction of the underlying function to the lazy series ring. We might also want to special case composition of a lazy Laurent series with a monomial in a lazy Laurent series.

Cool!  It makes me happy to see so many possibilities opening up!

Question: what do you mean with moving the construction of the underlying function to the `LazyLaurentSeriesRing`?

Idea / Suggestion: maybe it makes sense to use "dummy" (or something similar) instead of "z" for the variable name, to make it clear to the reader that it plays no role.  Of course, this would equally apply to all the other special functions.  I am not sure about the benefit / cost ratio, I am not even sure that there would be a benefit.

Indeed, that makes a lot of sense to me.  Similarly for all the other special functions where we end up composing with self in the last line.

One tiny thing: I think that we should be explicit that the function passed should be interpreted as coefficients:

```
sage: L.<q> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: phi = q.euler()
sage: phi
1 - q - q^2 + q^5 + O(q^7)
sage: L.<q> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(LazyDirichletSeriesRing(QQ, "s"))
sage: phi = q.euler()
sage: phi
(-1 - 1/(2^s) + 1/(5^s) + 1/(7^s) + O(1/(8^s)))
```
