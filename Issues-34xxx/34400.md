We change the attribute `_list` to actually store a `tuple` of the elements and switch methods such as `_iterator_from_list` to use the new `tuple` method instead of going through `list` (which makes a copy every time).

```
sage: L = list(range(100))
sage: %timeit list(L)
341 ns ± 5.13 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit tuple(L)
320 ns ± 9.19 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
sage: T = tuple(range(100))
sage: %timeit list(T)
354 ns ± 2.88 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
sage: %timeit tuple(T)
53.5 ns ± 0.764 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10,000,000 loops each)
