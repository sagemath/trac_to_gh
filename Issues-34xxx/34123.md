I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. My DFS initialization is not fast. In fact, it's slower than the implementation without it. 

Here are the results of some tests carried out on complete digraphs:

**Without initialization**

*300 vertices*
CPU times: user 648 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 648 ms
Wall time: 646 ms
299

*500 vertices*
CPU times: user 3.53 s, sys: 8 ms, total: 3.54 s
Wall time: 3.54 s
499

*1000 vertices*
CPU times: user 29.7 s, sys: 27.2 ms, total: 29.7 s
Wall time: 29.8 s
999

**Mine, with initialization**

*300 vertices*
CPU times: user 844 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 844 ms
Wall time: 841 ms
299

*500 vertices*
CPU times: user 3.85 s, sys: 7.46 ms, total: 3.85 s
Wall time: 3.84 s
499

*1000 vertices*
CPU times: user 31.1 s, sys: 3.45 ms, total: 31.1 s
Wall time: 31.2 s
999

I'm not seeing the 9x speedups as mentioned in the paper. I'm obviously missing something. Not sure what it is yet :/

You should do the following:
- add an optional parameter to decide if yes/no we use the DFS method. This will ease comparison
- make a non recursive version of the DFS. It should be faster.

I changed the non-recursive version. One of the difficulty was to ensure that an edge is selected before starting to process it's head.

I also did various edits in the code (coding style) and changed a few names.

I added another parameter to choose between the recursive and non-recursive versions. We will have to remove it later.

In some cases (e.g., rome), the non-recursive version is faster, but on complete graphs it is slower. I don't know why. At least it is correct and robust.

`@`David, I tried out the approach we discussed for removing loops, but it didn't work. I think I'm starting to figure out why

Remember that I said using [.remove_loops()](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/generic_graph.html#sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.remove_loops) worked, but was too expensive? Not quite. I noticed that it mattered where exactly I called .remove_loops(). If I called it before setting `max_ec`, then the code worked correctly. Otherwise, it failed. For a complete looped digraph, `max_ec` is 5, while `max_ec` is 2 for its unlooped counterpart. 

So, it seems that the accuracy of results depends on `max_ec`. Which shouldn't be the case! I'll investigate this further.
