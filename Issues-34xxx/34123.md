<a id='comment:7'></a>I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. My DFS initialization is not fast. In fact, it's slower than the implementation without it. 

Here are the results of some tests carried out on complete digraphs:

*1000 vertices*
CPU times: user 29.7 s, sys: 27.2 ms, total: 29.7 s
Wall time: 29.8 s

**Mine, with initialization**

*300 vertices*
CPU times: user 844 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 844 ms

<a id='comment:29'></a>I changed the non-recursive version. One of the difficulty was to ensure that an edge is selected before starting to process it's head.

I also did various edits in the code (coding style) and changed a few names.

I added another parameter to choose between the recursive and non-recursive versions. We will have to remove it later.

In some cases (e.g., rome), the non-recursive version is faster, but on complete graphs it is slower. I don't know why. At least it is correct and robust.
