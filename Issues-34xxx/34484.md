The base class `Module_free_ambient` makes `quotient` and `quotient_module` the same, but some subclasses override only `quotient`.

```

So in the case at hand, what's going on? Do we have

```
class Module_one(...):

    def quotient(...):

    quotient_module = quotient
```
whereas it would be better to have

```
class Module_one(...):

    def quotient(...):

    def quotient_module(...):
        return self.quotient(...)
```
Or would it be better to deprecate one or the other and focus on a single way of doing things? The Python philosophy is that there should ideally only be one obvious way to do things, so if we agree with that, then deprecation is the way to go.

I would say that redirecting to `quotient_module` is better for, say, algebras, as we could want to potentially keep the quotient-as-algebras and the quotient-as-modules different. The only other nag would be that most people will simply type (and override) the shorter-yet-still-clear `quotient` and they pay a small performance penalty of a redirect. (Of course, for the reason I just stated, this is much robust than the reverse because a programmer might implement the quotient as algebras with enforcement and expect `quotient_module` to still work and be surprised it doesn’t.) The redirect almost certainly shouldn’t have any significant impact on runtime.
