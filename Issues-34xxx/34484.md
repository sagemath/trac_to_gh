The base class `Module_free_ambient` makes `quotient` and `quotient_module` the same, but some subclasses override only `quotient`.

```
sage: A = ZZ^3; V = A.span([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
sage: V.quotient
<bound method FreeModule_generic_pid.quotient of Free module of degree 3 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 2 3]
[0 3 6]>
sage: V.quotient_module
<bound method Module_free_ambient.quotient_module of Free module of degree 3 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 2 3]
[0 3 6]>

sage: A = QQ^3
sage: A.quotient
<bound method FreeModule_generic_field.quotient of Vector space of dimension 3 over Rational Field>
sage: A.quotient_module
<bound method Module_free_ambient.quotient_module of Vector space of dimension 3 over Rational Field>
```

Having multiple names for the same thing appears in other places, too: `ZZ.quo?`, `ZZ.quotient?`, and `ZZ.quotient_ring?` display different help strings although claiming to be synonyms for each other. Maybe not as big a deal since maybe not so many things inherit methods from `ZZ`, but still not ideal (heh).

So in the case at hand, what's going on? Do we have

```
class Module_one(...):

    def quotient(...):

    quotient_module = quotient
```
whereas it would be better to have

```
class Module_one(...):

    def quotient(...):

    def quotient_module(...):
        return self.quotient(...)
```
Or would it be better to deprecate one or the other and focus on a single way of doing things? The Python philosophy is that there should ideally only be one obvious way to do things, so if we agree with that, then deprecation is the way to go.

I can't comment on how important having the alias `quo` still is.

But there are probably good reasons to have both `quotient` and `quotient_ring`, for cases where also `quotient_module` makes sense

I would say that redirecting to `quotient_module` is better for, say, algebras, as we could want to potentially keep the quotient-as-algebras and the quotient-as-modules different. The only other nag would be that most people will simply type (and override) the shorter-yet-still-clear `quotient` and they pay a small performance penalty of a redirect. (Of course, for the reason I just stated, this is much robust than the reverse because a programmer might implement the quotient as algebras with enforcement and expect `quotient_module` to still work and be surprised it doesn’t.) The redirect almost certainly shouldn’t have any significant impact on runtime.
