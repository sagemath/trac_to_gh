The following code produces a bunch of errors:

```
P.<x,w> = PolynomialRing(CC)
R = P.quotient_ring([x*w-1])
S.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(R)
```

It also errors out if `CC` is replaced with `AA`, but it works fine if it's replaced with `QQ`.

works fine for me in 9.7.beta3. Which version of sage do you use ?
