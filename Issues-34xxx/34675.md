It is possible to define `PolynomialRing(InfinityRing,'x')`, ie. univariate polynomial ring over `InfinityRing`, although not without hiccups as in #34563. 

At the same time, defining multivariate polynomial ring like `PolynomialRing(InfinityRing,2,'x')` results in the error:

> TypeError: The base ring The Infinity Ring is not a commutative ring

which contradicts `InfinityRing.is_commutative()` returning `True`.

It may be related to the fact that `InfinityRing` is not a true ring, but the error message is confusing nevertheless.
