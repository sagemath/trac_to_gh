The dev-conda environment contains quite a lot of packages that are not directly needed to compile or run sage, but only to compile one of sage's dependencies. Since conda already takes care of building the dependency tree (and only including runtime dependencies in it), there is no need to include the deep-dependencies in the environment file. Doing so just unnecessary bloats up the install time and size.

In fact, `du -hs /opt/conda/envs/**` shows

```
6.5G    /opt/conda/envs/sage-dev
1.4G    /opt/conda/envs/sage-dev-min
```
that the sage-dev environment is very large and there is a lot of room for improvement. The second env in the above list corresponds to the following env:

This env has been created using https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-tree minimizing function (which only takes the leaves of the dependency tree) and then manually going through the remaining dependencies to see which ones are not needed by sage (see comments). Sage compiles within this env, but I've not yet run the doctests. I propose to include this env file directly, replacing the existing automatically generated `sage-dev`.

Comments about whether the packages without any comments are used/needed are welcome.

To see which packages are still rather big, use

```
grep '"size":' ${CONDA_PREFIX}/conda-meta/*.json | sort -k3rn | sed 's/.*conda-meta\///g' | column -t
```

Thanks for investigating this. That's quite a dramatic difference. Could you post a list of the packages in the difference with sizes please?
