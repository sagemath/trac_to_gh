```
sage: Set([0, 1, 2, 3])
{0, 1, 2, 3}
sage: _.category()
Category of finite sets
sage: Set([0, 1, 2, 3], category=FiniteEnumeratedSets())
TypeError: Set() got an unexpected keyword argument 'category'
```

Likewise for the `Set_object_binary` classes (which implement lazy union, intersection, ...), the category should be computed from the categories of the inputs.

Also we add a `category` argument to the `Set` factory and the `__init__` methods of the various implementation classes.

Follow ups:
- #34398 the relation between `Set_object_enumerated` and `FiniteEnumeratedSet` (and `TrivialFamily`, `EnumeratedFamily`) should be clarified
- #34387 `Set()` should construct facade parents

You shouldn't need the `cardinality()` method as that should be given by the category.

You can simplify these checks:

```diff
-        if all(S in Sets().Finite() for S in (X, Y)):
-            category = category.Finite()
         if all(S in Sets().Enumerated() for S in (X, Y)):
             category = category.Enumerated()
         if any(S in Sets().Infinite() for S in (X, Y)):
             category = category.Infinite()
+        elif all(S in Sets().Finite() for S in (X, Y)):
+            category = category.Finite()
         Set_object_binary.__init__(self, X, Y, "union", "\\cup", category=category)
```

```diff
-        if X in Sets().Finite():
-            category = category.Finite()
         if X in Sets().Enumerated():
             category = category.Enumerated()
+        if X in Sets().Finite():
+            category = category.Finite()
+        elif X in Sets().Infinite() and Y in Sets().Finite():
-        if X in Sets().Infinite() and Y in Sets().Finite():
             category = category.Infinite()
         Set_object_binary.__init__(self, X, Y, "difference", "-", category=category)
```

I am also slightly worried about this change:

```diff

Can you explain why this happened? I can't see the reason immediately from your changes.

This ended up being a good test:

```
sage: X = S.difference(T); X
Set-theoretic difference of Set of elements of Rational Field and Set of elements of Integer Ring
sage: X.category()
Category of sets
```
because `QQ` does have a (canonical) enumeration that isn't recognized by Sage:

```
sage: QQ in EnumeratedSets()
False
```
However, fixing that is for another ticket.

That would negate a fair part of the category framework, it removes the fact that an enumerated set should (generally) behave like a list, and essentially every `EnumeratedSet` would have this proposed mixin class (thus being a code smell for why isn't in the category).

Indeed. No problem.
