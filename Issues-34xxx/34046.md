We fix issues reported by `./sage -tox -e pycodestyle -- src/sage/graphs/base/boost_graph.pyx` except:
- `E402 module level import not at top of file`. Certainly due to the fact that `cimport cython` is before other imports
- `E225 missing whitespace around operator` and `E227 missing whitespace around bitwise or shift operator`  which are related to cast and pointers
