CC:  @dimpase @kwankyu

We broaden the Sage developer's guide, so that it gives guidance to users/developers how they can contribute, not limited to just the Sage library.

- Move  https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiStart#Surveyingthemathematicalsoftwarelandscape to front page of developer's guide
- #34554 Merge https://wiki.sagemath.org/CodeSharingWorkflow into developer manual
- Add short chapter on distribution packaging

We haven't made a decision yet to use the GitHub wiki.

Moreover, I think it is not a good replacement for material that we now have on our wikis: GitHub wikis are not indexed by search engines.

Then change the title of ticket and do more work. Only adding "mathematical software landscape" at the introduction of the developer manual seems unbalanced to me.

Perhaps you don't really want to do the work as we did not move to github yet. Then set it "needs work" now?

Then this is an argument to keep using trac at least for wikis :)

Perhaps we will be forced to use github wiki after the migration...

Or we go back to sagemath wiki?

This appears to be about questionable Google's practice. Somebody there comments
about being unable to find anything on [GitHub](GitHub) using https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lunar+lander+game%22
Indeed, it doesn't show anything on [GitHub](GitHub) on the 1st page.
However, https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lunar+lander+game%22+%22github%22
does show [GitHub](GitHub) stuff!

That is, Google does index [GitHub](GitHub), it just doesn't want to show it, unless asked pointedly.

And https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lunar+lander+game%22+%22github%22+%22wiki%22 does show some wikis there, too

Specifically, GitHub wikis, not GitHub as a whole obviously!

And it seems that it's just that GitHub is just using robots.txt on the wikis. I haven't checked.
