We haven't made a decision yet to use the GitHub wiki.

Moreover, I think it is not a good replacement for material that we now have on our wikis: GitHub wikis are not indexed by search engines.

Then change the title of ticket and do more work. Only adding "mathematical software landscape" at the introduction of the developer manual seems unbalanced to me.

Perhaps you don't really want to do the work as we did not move to github yet. Then set it "needs work" now?

Then this is an argument to keep using trac at least for wikis :)

Perhaps we will be forced to use github wiki after the migration...

Or we go back to sagemath wiki?

The final comment here

seems to say this is not true for some popular wikis.

This appears to be about questionable Google's practice. Somebody there comments
about being unable to find anything on [GitHub](GitHub) using https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lunar+lander+game%22
Indeed, it doesn't show anything on [GitHub](GitHub) on the 1st page.
However, https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lunar+lander+game%22+%22github%22
does show [GitHub](GitHub) stuff!

That is, Google does index [GitHub](GitHub), it just doesn't want to show it, unless asked pointedly.

And https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lunar+lander+game%22+%22github%22+%22wiki%22 does show some wikis there, too

I'm saying it does not necessarily have to be done at the same time. Easier, no?

Specifically, GitHub wikis, not GitHub as a whole obviously!

And it seems that it's just that GitHub is just using robots.txt on the wikis. I haven't checked.
