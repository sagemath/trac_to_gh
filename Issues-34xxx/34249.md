In `sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.TuranGraph`, the documentation of the function `graphs.TuranGraph(n, r)` states:

The Turan graph `T(n,r)` has `\lfloor \frac{(r-1)(n^2)}{2r} \rfloor` edges.

This statement is not correct, as illustrated by the Turan graph with `n=12` vertices and `r=8` parts, which has 62 edges, whereas the expression evaluates to 63. The statement was widely thought to be true, but it has been debunked. See [math.stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1213226/deriving-the-number-of-edges-in-a-tur%C3%A1n-graph) for more details.
