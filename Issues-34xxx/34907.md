For example:

```sage
sage: GF(5^6).over(GF(5^2)).random_element().minpoly().parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field in z2 of size 5^2
sage: GF(5^4).over(GF(5^2)).random_element().minpoly().parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field in z2 of size 5^2
sage: GF(5^2).over(GF(5^2)).random_element().minpoly().parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 5
```

This is apparently because `RingExtensionWithBasisElement` defines its own `.minpoly()` method, whereas `RingExtensionElement` simply calls the one from the backend — which returns the absolute minimal polynomial.

I first discovered the inconsistency above while working on #34906, but the core issue actually runs much deeper. Here's another example:

```sage
sage: GF(5^6).over(GF(5^2)).galois_group() is GF(5^6).over(GF(5^3)).galois_group()
True
```
