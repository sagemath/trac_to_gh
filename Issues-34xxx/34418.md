```
Currently the following seems wrong: 

``` 
sage: nn = NonattackingFillings([0,0,1],PermutationGroupElement([2,1,3]))[0]; nn
[[2], [1], [3, 1]]
sage: nn.coinv()
1
```
The output should be 0

It seems that specifying a permutation was added later by sdenton but coinv was not adapted to that change.
