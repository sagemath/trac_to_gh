I agree that the sagemath image is essentially abandoned. I manage to upgrade it sometimes but it always requires me to fix some breakage that was introduced in the latest release. (And nobody else seems to be willing to help with this.)

I wouldn't call the image broken though. The sagemath-dev image takes forever to start since the latest upgrade but the the normal sagemath image should work fine though being outdated. At the same time the cocalc image is 6GB and I imagine that many people look for such images for CI purposes. (The sagemath image has unfortunately jumped to 1.5GB with its latest upgrade...)

So, shouldn't we mention both or rather link to a wiki page so the instructions can be easily adapted?

Yes, let's link to that wiki page instead.

I don't see why we should not recommend the sagemath image. It should work fine (though it's only 9.5.)

Thumbs up from me :-).  I regularly maintain and update cocalc-docker, and plan to continue to do so longterm.  It also gets a lot of usage and people complain when it breaks.

I sometimes build aarch64 images as well, though not as often as I would like.

Because it's sending potential Sage users to a dead end, and this is what we must avoid.

It's outdated (both Sage and the OS). There's no working way to upgrade it. Can't install optional packages (there's no `make`, can't install `make`) etc.
