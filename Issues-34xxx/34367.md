Yes, let's link to that wiki page instead.

I don't see why we should not recommend the sagemath image. It should work fine (though it's only 9.5.)

Because it's sending potential Sage users to a dead end, and this is what we must avoid.

It's outdated (both Sage and the OS). There's no working way to upgrade it. Can't install optional packages (there's no `make`, can't install `make`) etc.
