```
Let `g` be the complete graph on 3 vertices.

1. The command

```
g.subgraph_search_iterator(graphs.PathGraph(0))
```
returns a **list** with a single element, and that element is a **Graph**.

2. The command

```
g.subgraph_search_iterator(graphs.PathGraph(1))
```
returns a **list_iterator**,  and the first element there is a **Graph**.

3. The command

```
g.subgraph_search_iterator(graphs.PathGraph(2))
```
returns a **`SubgraphSearch`** instance, and the first element there is a **list**.

That makes it (very) hard to work with.

Tried in [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) version 9.0, Release Date: 2020-01-01.


Keywords: **subgraph**

Good catch. I assume that the expected behavior is to yield graphs, right ? and method `subgraph_search` should just return the first graph found by method `subgraph_search_iterator`.

Let me know if this is OK.

I added an extra parameter in case one prefers to get lists of vertices.

I did several improvements, in particular to ensure that we cannot search of a digraph in a graph, and that the type of each yielded graph is the same as the type of self (graph, digraph, bipartite graph).

I have not doctested the loop/multiedges cases. I don't think it's necessary.
