```
Let `g` be the complete graph on 3 vertices.

1. The command

```
g.subgraph_search_iterator(graphs.PathGraph(0))
```
returns a **list** with a single element, and that element is a **Graph**.

2. The command

```
g.subgraph_search_iterator(graphs.PathGraph(1))
```
returns a **list_iterator**,  and the first element there is a **Graph**.

3. The command

```
g.subgraph_search_iterator(graphs.PathGraph(2))
```
returns a **`SubgraphSearch`** instance, and the first element there is a **list**.

That makes it (very) hard to work with.

Tried in [SageMath](SageMath) version 9.0, Release Date: 2020-01-01.
