The following code results in 

> multi_polynomial_ideal.py:2557: DeprecationWarning: non-integer arguments to randrange() have been deprecated since Python 3.10 and will be removed in a subsequent version

```
R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(AA)
J = R.ideal([ x+y^2+z^3-8, 2*x^2+y^3+z^4-8, 4*x^3+y^4+z^5-8] )
J.variety()
```

What version of sage are you using? (And what is your operating system?)  The problem may have been fixed by #33234, which I think was merged in version 9.7.beta1.

I see it in Sage 9.6 and at https://sagecell.sagemath.org

The fix in #33234 seems to apply only to `real_roots.pyx` but not to `multi_polynomial_ideal.py`

Thanks for the additional information. I was able reproduce the error in 9.6, and also verify that it does not occur in 9.7.beta5.  The full deprecation message makes it pretty clear that the one-variable function `f.univariate_polynomial().roots` is being called:

```
<snip>/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py:2557:
DeprecationWarning: non-integer arguments to randrange() have been deprecated 
since Python 3.10 and will be removed in a subsequent version
  roots = f.univariate_polynomial().roots(ring=ring, multiplicities=False)
```

So this is a duplicate of #33234.
