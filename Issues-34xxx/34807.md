With #34690, all the Hadamard matrices of order <=288 have been added. The next task is to implement matrices of order up to 664 (668 is the first order for which no construction is known). This will require implementing https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82189436.pdf, as well as adding some more data for the constructions that are already present.

nice. 

How about bringing Sage up to date w.r.t. skew Hadamard matrices too?
I actually don't know what the 1st unknown order is in this case (something that's probably mentioned in the literature, I didn't try too hard to find this),
but I noticed that Sage does not know about orders 76, 100, and 116, whereas examples are known, see e.g.
