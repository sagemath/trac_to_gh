Sage documentation links in `help` menu have been long broken in jupyterlab notebook interface, although they work fine in jupyter notebook interface.

Jupyterlab loads local files (sage documentation files) in `iframe` tag. This is problematic and it seems hopeless to make this work. A proper way is to run local http server serving the doc along with jupyter(lab) notebook server.

The branch uses thread parallelism to run sage doc server.

Try the branch with `sage --notebook=jupyterlab`. This runs a light-weight sage doc server at `http://localhost:<SAGE_DOC_LOCAL_PORT>`, where the environment variable `SAGE_DOC_LOCAL_PORT` defaults to 8000.

Set `export SAGE_DOC_SERVER_URL=https://doc.sagemath.org` before running `sage --notebook=jupyterlab` to use the public doc server. This will be useful for jupyterhub users.

-Try the branch with `sage --notebook=jupyterlab`
+Try the branch with `sage --notebook=jupyterlab`. This runs a light-weight sage doc server at `http://localhost:<SAGE_DOC_LOCAL_PORT>`, where the environment variable `SAGE_DOC_LOCAL_PORT` defaults to 8000.
+
+Set `export SAGE_DOC_SERVER_URL=https://doc.sagemath.org` before running `sage --notebook=jupyterlab` to use the public doc server. This will be useful for jupyterhub users.
