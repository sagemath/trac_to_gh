# Issue 21768: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo, algorithm='maxima') is wrong

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22005

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2016-12-01 12:25:35

Keywords: maxima

From [ask.sagemath.org](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35839/sage-incorrectly-evaluates-series/):


```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo)
1/64*pi^2 - 1/12
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo, algorithm='maxima')
1/64*pi^2 - 1/12
```


but correct answer is `1/64*pi^2`. SymPy (with #22004) and Mathematica do it right:


```
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo, algorithm='mathematica')
1/64*pi^2
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo, algorithm='sympy')
1/64*pi^2
```

Seems to be fixed upstream or "_perhaps an interaction with some flags that Sage is setting_" according to Robert Dodier:

this is to be fixed in #18920; this bug does not appear in the currently tested configuration of ECL-16.1.3+Maxima 5.39.0; this ticket should be closed after #18920 is done.

Just to say that a doctest is already testing this issue:

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/calculus/calculus.py#L569

It was added in #22004 and updated during the upgrade to maxima 5.39.
