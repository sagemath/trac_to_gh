From [ask.sagemath.org](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35839/sage-incorrectly-evaluates-series/):


```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo)
1/64*pi^2 - 1/12
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo, algorithm='maxima')
1/64*pi^2 - 1/12
```


but correct answer is `1/64*pi^2`. SymPy (with #22004) and Mathematica do it right:


```
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo, algorithm='mathematica')
1/64*pi^2
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo, algorithm='sympy')
1/64*pi^2
```
