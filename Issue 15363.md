Zero-tests in `QQbar` and `AA` are very slow—slower than can be reasonably expected of exact computations with algebraic numbers IMHO.

On some examples, it turns out that 80% or more of the time is spent calling PARI's `polredbest`. The current implementation apparently calls `polredbest` each time exact computations in a new extension are required, which can be pretty expensive. It does so in the hope of finding a "nice" primitive element whose use will speed up subsequent computations (and perhaps also make the descriptions of the elements slightly more readable?), but otherwise my understanding is that this step is completely optional.

Let's try to disable it except for small degrees (the value of `max_deg` was chosen to avoid changing the output of the tests in `qqbar.py`):

Now these examples may not be representative of anything, and the above patch is a very naive solution. But it should certainly be possible to come up with a better strategy than calling `polredbest` every time!

I agree that QQbar *also* needs more caching. (And not only in the marked places. For instance, look how many times `nfinit` is called by `sage_input(pol.roots(...,ring=QQbar), verify=True)`: it seems to me that lots of expensive purely algebraic computations could be performed only once when we have `AlgebraicGenerator`s corresponding to several roots of the same irreducible polynomial.)

But even with caching, is it reasonable to spend tens of seconds optimizing the representation of an extension that may be used only once to check that some expression is zero?

I asked Karim Belabas. Here is what I understand of his answer:
* the cost of `polredbest` for a polynomial of degree `n` with coefficients of bit size `B` is roughly `n^5 B^2`;
* the best it can do is to reduce the cost of subsequent computations in the extension by a factor of roughly `B^2`;
* it is essentially never worth calling it on polynomials of moderately large degree;
* ...except before performing very expensive operations (typically `bnfinit()`) on the extension, when there is reason to expect that it will find a defining polynomial of very small height.

On a related note, I noticed that `QQbar` often calls `polredbest` on polynomials of the form `p(x^k)` where `k` can be pretty large. Karim suggested that the Pari function `rnfpolredbest` could be useful in this case.

As we realized with Pascal Molin, this is related in particular to #26898. What used to happen is that hashing an algebraic number α would trigger the exact computation, not just of α itself, but of the *real and imaginary parts* of α *+ β* for some β ∈ ℚ[i]...
