CC:  @kwankyu @videlec

Follow-up from #33011.

Because of the complication described in #33011, we not only remove the file from the source tree but also remove it from site-packages before building sagelib.

Follow-up: 
- make sagemath-standard, sage-setup depend on sagemath-environment


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34187

a `lazy_import` with `deprecation` keyword is to be removed after the deprecation period while a plain `lazy_import` is to remain. What seems wrong to me is that this distinction is implicitly made by the mere presence of a keyword argument.

Anyway, this ticket looks good to me.

When building surface-dynamics (a Cython project that builds against sagelib) we are getting

```
  surface_dynamics/flat_surfaces/origamis/origami_dense.pyx:39:8: 'sage/structure/element.pxd' not found
```

It seems to me that Cython does not find the .pxd file anymore because the `__init__.py` in the base directory is missing now.

We could patch the cython packaged in conda-forge with https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/4918 but maybe there is some way to fix this that works for unpatched Cythons?
