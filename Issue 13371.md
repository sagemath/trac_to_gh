The patch allows to specify which variable assignments of a solution are excluded from further solutions. For example, this is useful in cryptography, where we are only interested in the key bit variables, when reconstructing key candidates from a polynomial system.

Looks good, can you add a doctest that it indeed works?

I've fixed the patch and removed the old patch.


```
 - ``target_variables`` - a list of variables. The elements of the list are 
   used to exclude a particular combination of variable assignments of a 
   solution from any further solution. If ``target_variables`` is ``None`` 
   all variables appearing in the polynomials of ``F`` are used to construct 
   exclusion clauses. (default: ``None``) 
```


This isn't correct. If `target_variables is None` then all variables in the ring are used, not only those in `F`. Should we change that?

Also, it should be mentioned that `target_variables` also filters what variable value pairs are returned.

Finally, the commit message should be updated:

> You are encouraged to write commit messages of the form Trac XXXX: <description-goes-here> 
> using the Trac ticket number and then have a concise description, e.g. “fix echelon form 
> error” or “add echelon form over finite fields.” Some people also write commit messages in
> the form #xxxx: <description-goes-here>, which is also acceptable. A key information to
> provide in a commit message is the ticket number.

will fail if no SAT solver is installed (default). Please add `# optional - cryptominisat` to each such doctest line which means this line is only tested if cryptominisat is installed.
