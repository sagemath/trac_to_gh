Keywords: libgap

Conversion of libgap objects to Sage objects still has many gaps. For example:

```
sage: libgap(GF(3)).GroupRing(AbelianGroup([3,3]))
<algebra-with-one over GF(3), with 2 generators>
sage: _.sage()
Ring of integers modulo 3
```

A wrong answer is worse than no answer, and of course a much better answer would be

```
sage: AbelianGroup([3,3]).algebra(GF(3))
Algebra of Multiplicative Abelian group isomorphic to C3 x C3 over Finite Field of size 3
```

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

This is still apparently an issue, if anyone would like to take it on.  In this case, improvements can definitely be made to `GapElement_Ring.sage()`.
