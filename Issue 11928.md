# Issue 11928: proof parameter not passed on when factoring polynomials over function fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12100

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2011-11-29 16:05:47

Assignee: tbd

Keywords: function_fields

Applying #9054 to sage 4.7.2 factorization does not work anymore in some cases:


```
sage: k.<x> = FunctionField(GF(5))
sage: R.<y> = k[]
sage: (y^3-x^3+x).factor(proof=False)
NotImplementedError: proof = True factorization not implemented.  Call factor with proof=False.
```


The problem is that with #10635 the `proof` parameter is not passed on anymore to `_factor_univariate_polynomial()`. As a workaround one can of course call `k._factor_univariate_polynomial((f,proof=False)` directly.

I must have been working with an old version of #9054. The behaviour described above does actually not happen with the current version of #9054. This ticket can be closed. Sorry.

If you want a ticket to be closed, set its milestone to sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix.
