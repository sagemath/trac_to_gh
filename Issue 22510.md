When using the Cython compiler directive `binding=True`, Cython uses a custom type to implement functions and methods. This custom type supports more Python features, such as `inspect` support.

We can close this ticket in favor of #26254.

The only commit from the branch here that is useful is https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/d9620409749338b4c33aeef1ded7c944d74e10dd -- not really "Sage library fixes" but just some updates of doctest outputs.
