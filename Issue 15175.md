Right, stupid me. I may have had `combinat_cython` in mind but anyway after deleting the build/ directory, building all files again then passing all tests I saw no doctest problem that seems to be related. SOooooooooo well `:-)`

Similar to #15410, but slightly different error in conway polynomials; http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/%20%20fast%20Volker%20Desktop%20%28Fedora%2019%20x86_64%29%20full/builds/6/steps/compile_1/logs/conway
