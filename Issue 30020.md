# Issue 30020: Fusion Ring - Rmatrix

Keywords: FusionRing, R-matrix

The `FusionRing` method captures much of the structure of a modular tensor category. One aspect that it does not capture is the R-matrix, which is implemented in this ticket.

The results may be compared with calculations in Rowell, Stong and Wang (arXiv:0712.1377) and in Bonderson's thesis. Our results agree for the first four examples 5.4.1-4 in Rowell, Stong and Wang but diverge for 5.4.5. The reason for this discrepancy needs to be investigated.

Rowell, Stong and Wang was corrected in arXiv version 4 and Example 5.4.5 agrees with our code in the corrected version.

This method has been tested a lot in the past couple of days in computing F-matrices (using the hexagon relations). I think it is reliable.

I renamed `rmatrix()` to `r_matrix()` to be consistent with `s_matrix()` and I think this is easier to read.

I renamed `twist` parameter `reduce` to `reduced` to avoid a conflict with the `reduce` builtin Python method.

I also made some minor changes to the docstrings.

If my changes are good, then positive review.
