```
the file src/sage/repl/interpreter.py uses the variable

SAGE_ORIG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH

which is not defined by default. This cause doctests failures on
a patchbot not running in a bash shell.

Let us get rid of this variable and related code.

Example of log with failing doctests:

No.

0) once again, the patchbots are not going to look at that, because it is not "safe".
1) besides, there are very few patchbots running, and not a single one on Darwin.
2) I have no Darwin machine to check it myself.

So no progress, no way.

This was added in #14380.  It should still be there (library search paths are "weird" in Cygwin due to the use of Windows conventions for searching for DLLs--as for `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` it doesn't normally need to be set but does affect `dlopen()` calls so we set it here).

Could please somebody review this ticket ? This prevents one of my patchbots from working

It is not if you look at the commit https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=82d0a8c49fa59d57fc862d89dcdd974011d92cc0

This seems odd in the trac git diff viewer...
