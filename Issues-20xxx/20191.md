This shows an equivalent to SymPy's `Piecewise` is missing in Sage:

```
        sage: _ = var('y, z')
        sage: (x^y - z).integrate(y)
        -y*z + x^y/log(x)
        sage: (x^y - z).integrate(y, algorithm="sympy")  # see Trac #14694
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AttributeError: 'ExprCondPair' object has no attribute '_sage_'

SymPy-1.0:
>>> integrate(x**y-z,y)
       ⎛⎧  y     for log(x) = 0⎞
       ⎜⎪                      ⎟
       ⎜⎪   y                  ⎟
 -y⋅z + ⎜⎨  x                   ⎟
       ⎜⎪──────    otherwise   ⎟
       ⎜⎪log(x)                ⎟
       ⎝⎩                      ⎠

```
`Piecewise` in SymPy is a held function of `ExprCondPair` arguments. It would be a superset of our `piecewise`. The name should not be confusable, a suggestion is `if_then([(log(x)==0, y), (x^y/log(x), 1)])`.

When it is implemented a SymPy patch should be done for the `_sage_` method.

EDIT: Maxima 5.38.1 returns a similar function for some integrals.

Depends on #23820
