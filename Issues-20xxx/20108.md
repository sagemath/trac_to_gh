Indeed, looking at the setup.py, the only files that are installed using the `data_files` option are going into the selected site-packages (typically under `SAGE_LOCAL`, but in principle the appropriate site-packages for any Python that is used to run `setup.py).

This being the case it should be using `package_data` instead.

It's a file used by some Cython `.pxd` files. So yes it should be installed.

Of course, ideally this file shouldn't even exist in the first place: it mostly contains stuff to work around Cython limitations which are no longer relevant. Me and Jean-Pierre Flori already did some work to reduce the usage of `ntlwrap.cpp`, but we're not there yet.

Thinking more about `setup.py` stuff: #21600 shows that the current way how we use `data_files` doesn't really work (for other reasons).

But again as suggested by #21600: maybe the best solution is to use neither `data_files` nor `package_data` but just roll our own data-file handling class.

Do you think the approach of #21600 (using neither `data_files` nor `package_data`) makes sense? If so, we could close this ticket.

I'm not strictly against it.  I think the implementation details still need some work but I'm open to the idea.  I'd still rather get `package_data` working instead though.  I'm still convinced whatever the problem is I can fix it, I just haven't tried very hard yet.
