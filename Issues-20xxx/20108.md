Indeed, looking at the setup.py, the only files that are installed using the `data_files` option are going into the selected site-packages (typically under `SAGE_LOCAL`, but in principle the appropriate site-packages for any Python that is used to run `setup.py).

This being the case it should be using `package_data` instead.

It's a file used by some Cython `.pxd` files. So yes it should be installed.

Of course, ideally this file shouldn't even exist in the first place: it mostly contains stuff to work around Cython limitations which are no longer relevant. Me and Jean-Pierre Flori already did some work to reduce the usage of `ntlwrap.cpp`, but we're not there yet.

I seem to remember a problem with `package_data`: it assumes that the directory layout of the sources and package_data is identical.

I believe that you cannot use `package_data` to install something from `/some/random/directory/foo.dat` to `site-packages/sage/foo.dat`. And we need this for Cython-generated files.
