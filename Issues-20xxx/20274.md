Few problems at finite lattices: 1) Operators `+` and `*` for meet and join are not documented, 2) example of `breadth()` is stupid as it just `BoolenaLattice(4)` and 3) `is_supersolvable()` fails for empty lattice. This patch corrects those.

There is an on-going debate about whether to refer to <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> in any docstring (guess what side I am on :P). However you should remove the comma `,` before the `and` to be (English) grammatically correct (as <code>otherwise \`\`False\`\`</code> is not a complete sentence).

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A8):

>> Duh. Done that. Now it is inconsistent with other functions in the file. We should have a style guide for this kind of things.

> There is an on-going debate about whether to refer to <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> in any docstring (guess what side I am on :P).

OK. I don't have strong opinion, but if I must choose, then no `self`s in docstring. Most important is to make a choose and stick on it.

> However you should remove the comma `,` before the `and` to be (English) grammatically correct (as <code>otherwise \`\`False\`\`</code> is not a complete sentence).

Done that. However, almost every docstring has the same problem. I didn't touch them now.
