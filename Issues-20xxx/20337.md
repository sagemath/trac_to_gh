Contrary to documentation, one cannot set a constantly zero objective function by passing 0 to `set_objective`.

```
    sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=True)
    sage: x = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
    sage: p.set_objective(0)
    AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'dict'
```
This ticket fixes that and actually allows any field number (which ends up in the `obj_constant_term`). 

Moreover, the backend slot `obj_constant_term` is accessed directly by `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.show`; it should instead be exposed by a backend method, which this ticket adds as well.

Finally, the `show` method added an extraneous blank line when a nonzero `obj_constant_term` was present.  Fixed and doctest added.
