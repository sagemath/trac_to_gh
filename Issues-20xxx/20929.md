Yes.  [comment:ticket:20926:60 As mentioned] on #20926:  Also Givaro's *testsuite* currently requires `-std=c++98` (not fixed yet, no ticket).

Note that GCC 6.x defaults to even C++14.

(Not sure why this ticket didn't get closed, as the work-around except for Givaro's testsuite was included in #20926.  We could also make this ticket depend on #17635 though.)
