This ticket has 2 main changes:

1. Move all coercion logic from `RingElement`, `ModuleElement` and the like to `Element`.

Because of this, it matters a lot less whether a class inherits from `Element` or from `ModuleElement`/`RingElement`/`FieldElement`...

One difference remains: the more specialized classes have some default implementations for arithmetic. For example, `ModuleElement` implements unary negation as multiplication by -1. The base class `Element` has no such default implementations.

This patch also affects lookup in categories: with this patch, double-underscore methods like `__add__` are never taken from the category. The `Element` classes take precedence over the category, so the default implementations of arithmetic operations will override whatever is in the category (this is existing behaviour, not affected by this patch). For the base class `Element`, this is not an issue since there are no default implementations.

2. Change the implementation of double-underscore methods like `__add__` to return `NotImplemented` (rather than raise an error) if one argument is not a Sage `Element` and coercion fails.

This will cause Python to try the reversed operation (`__radd__` or `__add__` in Cython). This way, Sage has improved support for operations with non-Sage types.

 This patch also affects lookup in categories: with this patch, double-underscore methods like `__add__` are never taken from the category. The `Element` classes take precedence over the category, so the default implementations of arithmetic operations will override whatever is in the category (this is existing behaviour, not affected by this patch). For the base class `Element`, this is not an issue since there are no default implementations.

+2. Change the implementation of double-underscore methods like `__add__` to return `NotImplemented` if one argument is not a Sage `Element` and coercion fails.
+
+This will cause Python to try the reversed operation (`__radd__` or `__add__` in Cython). This way, Sage has improved support for operations with non-Sage types.

Hi

Just as a reminder: There are situation where we need ring element operations in a parent resp. for an element which is not really considered a ring element.

Example:
- Take a graded ring.
- Take two elements from different weight-components.
- Note that the elements by themself are considered elements of vector spaces
  (which is what we want because we probably want to do operations that only make sense for the vector space, etc).
- However we still want to be able to "add" _and_ "multiply" such elements.
  - Add would result in a ring element (unless the components are the same).
  - Multiply would result in a vector in a higher weight-component.

I had to deal with this when I implemented the graded rings of modular forms.
See src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/element.py for more details.
There I solved it as follows:
I derived the element from FormsRingElement (so it has the multiply methods) but the parent is still just a vector space. I also made sure that arithmetic operations with elements end up in the correct space.

Will this still work with this ticket?
Can you check the tests for this maybe?

Side note: At the moment I don't really have time to actively develop, so I can't really promise much help.


Best
Jonas

I read your new documentation; that's a very nice addition to the Sage documentation. I have done some changes here and there, and added a draft of explanation of the `cdef _add_` trick. Please proofread. The `_add_long` and `_mul_long` protocols need to be documented and tested in element.pyx; see the TODO there.

Other than this, I believe this is good to go. Thanks a lot Jeroen!

Thanks; I checked your commits and am happy with them.

Two small questions:
- The documentation currently seems to suggest that it's only possible to implement `_add_long` and `_mul_long` within a Cython class. Is that right? Of course, in a Python class it's probably rarely relevant to implement `_add_long`, but if this works there is no reason to hide it in the doc.

- ``Concrete implementations (of `_add_`) in subclasses should be ``cpdef`` or ``def`` methods``: do we need to be specific? cdef would actually work too, right? Or is it because with cdef, a Python level call to `x._add_(y)` would fail?

Once you have made up your mind on the above, you can set a positive review on my behalf (assuming of course all tests keep passing).

Thanks!

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

Yes, it's a `cdef` method, so it's Cython-only. Since it is only an optimization, it makes little sense to allow it to be a Python method. If you care about performance, you should be using Cython anyway.

It would work for `x + y` yes. But I think it is expected that `x._add_(y)` also works. Anyway, that is how things were historically.

Maybe one could argue that `x._add_(y)` should not be required to work from Python. But let's not change that in this ticket.
