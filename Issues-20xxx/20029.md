<a id='comment:3'></a>This bialgebra (if m=n) has a natural comodule, namely the quantum affine space.

Would it be hard to implement that, too? It seems plausible that this could be useful.

The quantum determinant is described in this paper and there are also bialgebras/Hopf algebras constructed for the other classical types.

I would suggest adding a note saying what q-convention you are using. For example the q squared in your document would be just a q in Chari and Pressley or in Kassel (or FRT for that matter). I think this would save some confusion for people that don't now about this.

Certain things that could be implemented going forward could be an antipode map for GL_q(n) and maybe the same construction for other classical types (see FRT). The quantum determinant is then replaced by the quantum similitude.

I will add the reference and a note about the q-convention. Does the antipode extend to GL<sub>q</sub>(n)? From FRT (well, at least [Ram's version](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~ram/Resources/Reshetikhin/QuantizationOfLieGroupsAndLieAlgebras.html)), it is only given for SL<sub>q</sub>(n).

<a id='comment:15'></a>I've added a class for GL<sub>q</sub>(n), but it currently fails the antipode test. I've also changed the convention from `q^2` to `q`. I just ran another test and it says that it is failing associativity, so the bug is probably in the multiplication code.

However, can you check to make sure the following data is correct?

```
sage: O = algebras.QuantumGL(2)
sage: O.quantum_determinant()
x[1,1]*x[2,2] - q*x[1,2]*x[2,1]
sage: for g in O.algebra_generators():
....:     print "{:>8}{:>33}{:>35}{:>2}".format(g, g.antipode(),
....:                                           g.coproduct(), g.counit())
  x[1,1]                         c*x[2,2]  x[1,1] # x[1,1] + x[1,2] # x[2,1] 1
  x[1,2]                 -(q^-1)*c*x[2,1]  x[1,1] # x[1,2] + x[1,2] # x[2,2] 0
  x[2,1]                      -q*c*x[1,2]  x[2,1] # x[1,1] + x[2,2] # x[2,1] 0
  x[2,2]                         c*x[1,1]  x[2,1] # x[1,2] + x[2,2] # x[2,2] 1
       c  x[1,1]*x[2,2] - q*x[1,2]*x[2,1]                              c # c 1
```
This agrees with Valentin's paper if `c = 1`.

<a id='comment:18'></a>Okay, I fixed the issue with multiplication not be associative by a slightly hacky Gröbner basis like process, but I left a little outline/proof of the method as a comment. I also forgot that it is the *transpose* of the cofactor matrix when doing the inverse (and hence the antipode).

Now just to do a little bit of cleanup and get back to full doctest coverage.
