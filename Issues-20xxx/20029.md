This bialgebra (if m=n) has a natural comodule, namely the quantum affine space.

Would it be hard to implement that, too? It seems plausible that this could be useful.

Perhaps it would be good to add a reference to Faddeev, Reshetikhin and Takhtajan, Quantization of Lie Groups and Lie Algebras, Leningrad Math. J. vol. 1 no. 1 (1990).

The quantum determinant is described in this paper and there are also bialgebras/Hopf algebras constructed for the other classical types.

I looked over the document and it looks good!

I would suggest adding a note saying what q-convention you are using. For example the q squared in your document would be just a q in Chari and Pressley or in Kassel (or FRT for that matter). I think this would save some confusion for people that don't now about this.

Certain things that could be implemented going forward could be an antipode map for GL_q(n) and maybe the same construction for other classical types (see FRT). The quantum determinant is then replaced by the quantum similitude.

Addendum - At least the FRT article is not on MathSciNet; just a description/reference information.

Thank you. I will see if I can implement this over the weekend (I'm flying to Seoul tomorrow).

<a id='comment:15'>Comment 15:</a>
I've added a class for GL<sub>q</sub>(n), but it currently fails the antipode test. I've also changed the convention from `q^2` to `q`. I just ran another test and it says that it is failing associativity, so the bug is probably in the multiplication code.

However, can you check to make sure the following data is correct?

```
sage: O = algebras.QuantumGL(2)
sage: O.quantum_determinant()
x[1,1]*x[2,2] - q*x[1,2]*x[2,1]
sage: for g in O.algebra_generators():
....:     print "{:>8}{:>33}{:>35}{:>2}".format(g, g.antipode(),
....:                                           g.coproduct(), g.counit())
  x[1,1]                         c*x[2,2]  x[1,1] # x[1,1] + x[1,2] # x[2,1] 1
  x[1,2]                 -(q^-1)*c*x[2,1]  x[1,1] # x[1,2] + x[1,2] # x[2,2] 0
  x[2,1]                      -q*c*x[1,2]  x[2,1] # x[1,1] + x[2,2] # x[2,1] 0
  x[2,2]                         c*x[1,1]  x[2,1] # x[1,2] + x[2,2] # x[2,2] 1
       c  x[1,1]*x[2,2] - q*x[1,2]*x[2,1]                              c # c 1
```
This agrees with Valentin's paper if `c = 1`.
