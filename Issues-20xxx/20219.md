The methods `idealintersection`, ` reverse`, `order`, ` listinsert`, `listput` were simply removed. You should provide deprecation and test it.

Finally, could you change the doctest

```
     sage: var('x')
     x
     sage: pari(x).ceil()
     x
```
to

```
    sage: pari(SR.var('x')).ceil()

Because `var` is an horrible function that implicitely put `x` in the namespace.

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: pari(x)....

I don't see the point. We provide the functions exposed by PARI/GP. If these functions are used in Sage library code, there is an implicit test that they work. If they are not used, I don't see why it's our business to check that PARI/GP has a `vecmin()` function for example.

`idealintersection` and `reverse` are tested in `tests.py`. The last three indeed disappeared.

But these functions used to be there. Some people might use them outside of the Sage library code. I do not claim that the code was good from the begining but that the changes should be as smooth as possible.

The same remark applies.
