There was no doctest for `vecmin`, `vecmax`, `elltaniyama`, `bnfcertify`, `bnfunit`, `idealval`, `nfsubfields`,  .Would it be possible to provide one to check that the methods exist?

The methods `idealintersection`, ` reverse`, `order`, ` listinsert`, `listput` were simply removed. You should provide deprecation and test it.

Finally, could you change the doctest

```
     sage: var('x')
     x
     sage: pari(x).ceil()
     x
```
to

```
    sage: pari(SR.var('x')).ceil()
```

sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: pari(x)....

I don't see the point. We provide the functions exposed by PARI/GP. If these functions are used in Sage library code, there is an implicit test that they work. If they are not used, I don't see why it's our business to check that PARI/GP has a `vecmin()` function for example.

`idealintersection` and `reverse` are tested in `tests.py`. The last three indeed disappeared.

OK, let's look at the functions that you mentioned:

* `vecmin`, `vecmax`: added back with doctests.
* `elltaniyama`, `bnfcertify`, `nfsubfields`, `idealval`: still exist, auto-generated.
* `bnfunit`: still exists in `gen.pyx`.
* `idealintersection`, `reverse`: still exist but deprecated.
* `order`: added back as deprecated alias.
* `listinsert`, `listput`: now auto-generated and doctested implicitly in `List()`.
