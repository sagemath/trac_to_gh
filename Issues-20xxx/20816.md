Yes, this is the core of this ticket, making this precise doctest more robust
by allowing some changes in the list of attributes. I ran the doctest on a machine with the latest magma and it was failing because of the presence of two more attributes. The aim of the test is not to check that we are up-to-date with a precise version of magma, but that we can indeed manage to get the attributes from magma itself.
