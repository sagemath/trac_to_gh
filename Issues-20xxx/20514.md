This is easy to fix (by overriding the default method):

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2)
sage: I = R.ideal(0,1)
sage: I == R.unit_ideal()
True
sage: I.is_trivial() # should give the same answer!

<a id='comment:2'></a>The docstring for `is_trivial` states:

```
Return ``True`` if this ideal is `(0)` or `(1)`.
```
Setting aside the zero ring (where all possible interpretations seem to lead to the answer `True`), there seem to be three different definitions floating around for what constitutes a trivial ideal of a ring: the zero ideal; the unit ideal; or both. In commutative algebra, I'm generally used to seeing the second interpretation. The first interpretation is the one compatible with group theory, where triviality tends to refer exclusively to the one-element subgroup.

This ambiguity makes me wonder whether we should even provide this method at all! But if we do provide it, then it should be implemented using comparisons with the `zero_ideal` and/or `unit_ideal` of the parent ring.
