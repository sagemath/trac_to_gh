`(Graph({'a': []})+Graph({'b': []})).vertices()` gives `[0, 1]`, but docstring of `__add__` says "If there are common vertices to both, they will be renamed." I do not know which way it should be.

Also there is no error checking, so `Graph({0:[]})+'junk'` does and returns nothing.

David, a question. How should this function work?

- Not at all, remove this.
- As now, i.e. always relabel to integers.
- Keep vertices, raise exception if there is a common vertex.
- Keep vertices, do like `union()` does.
- Keep vertices, but relabel common ones (like the docstring now says).

The current implementation of the `add` method is

```
        if isinstance(other_graph, GenericGraph):
            return self.disjoint_union(other_graph, labels='integers')
```
So it forces to relabel vertices as integer in `[0..n-1]`.

At the least, we should raise an error for cases such as `Graph({0:[]})+'junk'`. Indeed, the other ordering raises an error

```
sage: 'junk'+Graph({0:[]})
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-99-2e66a308aaff> in <module>()
----> 1 'junk'+Graph({Integer(0):[]})

TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'Graph' objects
```

Now, the semantic of `+` is the disjoint union, and I believe this is the right choice.
We should however ensure that the doc of `__add__`, `disjoint_union`, `union`, `__mul__` and may be `join`, are clear enough and without ambiguity for users.

Concerning the relabel to integers part, I agree that this is often painful. We could propose and intermediate behavior like: relabel only if some vertices have same label. But again some people will complain.

David.

It seems that example given uses consecutive integeres. But yes, your suggestions sounds reasonable. But now I see this:

```
sage: G = Graph({'a': ['b']})
sage: G
Graph on 2 vertices
sage: G+G
 disjoint_union : Graph on 4 vertices
sage: H = graphs.CycleGraph(3)

Right, we could improve the naming part of `disjoint_union`. Currently it is:

```

```

I just saw that there is a deprecation warning in `disjoint_union`. See #17053.

I like the idea of only relabeling (the entire graph) if there are common vertices. NetworkX automatically relabels everything to integers when adding graphs and they get along fine without people complaining. We could possibly think about doing something with recording the previously named values when relabeling them. That way people could choose to invert the labeling if it was really necessary. Our add function could pass in a dictionary of the previous labels as an attribute in the newly created graph.
In the end, I think that relabeling to integers is best. If people know they need to preserve vertex names, they can take precautions beforehand.

OK for me. Then it would be like `.disjoint_union(other, labels=âintegersâ)`. Current behaviour would be maintained, so there is no need for a deprecation. Should `disjoint_union` have an option to get really direct union (and raise an exception it graphs have common vertices)? If not, I will add an example like we now have for disjoint union of posets.

And then there is the naming thing.

But first I will wait for three days to see if there will be opinions against this.

* "Labels of the resultin" -> "Labels of the resulting"
* a doctest is needed for the `TypeError` case of the `__add__` method.
* the error message could be improved, for instance to something similar to

```
sage: 1+'a'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Integer Ring' and '<type 'str'>'
```
We could using something like that, which is valid for both `Graph` and `DiGraph`.

```
raise TypeError("adding a '{}' and a '{}' is not defined".format(typeof(self),typeof(other))
```
* I'm not fully aware of python3 syntax, but I suggest to avoid using `G._name = '%s disjoint_union %s'%(a, b)` and to prefer `G._name = '{} disjoint_union {}'.format(a, b)`. Well actually this is certainly more robust: `G.name('{} disjoint_union {}'.format(a, b))`.
