Apparently on Debian / Ubuntu a libgiac dependency may not be installed with the giac install and is somehow needed when installing Pynac in Sage (which optionally has giac installed).

To prevent unwanted linking and to reduce confusion `--with-giac=no` should be set in the Pynac spkg.

Yep, (vanilla) giac's configure instructions do not mention libao either.  But if building pynac *may* fail on !Debian/Ubuntu (hardly anyone uses these distros, I know), pynac's configure should catch that case (either by disabling giac, or giving an appropriate error message).

I'd say solve it upstream if you find the time, and we can eventually revert the changes here with one of the next releases of pynac.

Or we could make Sage's giac package a standard one.

Can't parse that... 8-)
