Apparently on Debian / Ubuntu a libgiac dependency may not be installed with the giac install and is somehow needed when installing Pynac in Sage (which optionally has giac installed).

To prevent unwanted linking and to reduce confusion `--with-giac=no` should be set in the Pynac spkg.

Well, it seems the checks for giac (more precisely, linking to the library) in `configure` aren't sufficient.  (The [instructions](http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac_compile.html) to *link to it* on Linux -- as opposed to *building giac*, you listed giac's *build dependencies* in the thread -- explicitly list also libao-dev.)

As you say it applies to Debian only---here on OpenSuSE libao is sufficient and there should be no reason why Pynac would need something that isn't already there after `sage -i giac` has finished. If `-lao` is needed by Sage then already then, isn't it?

Yep, (vanilla) giac's configure instructions do not mention libao either.  But if building pynac *may* fail on !Debian/Ubuntu (hardly anyone uses these distros, I know), pynac's configure should catch that case (either by disabling giac, or giving an appropriate error message).

I'd say solve it upstream if you find the time, and we can eventually revert the changes here with one of the next releases of pynac.

Or we could make Sage's giac package a standard one.

Can't parse that... 8-)
