Apparently on Debian / Ubuntu a libgiac dependency may not be installed with the giac install and is somehow needed when installing Pynac in Sage (which optionally has giac installed).

To prevent unwanted linking and to reduce confusion `--with-giac=no` should be set in the Pynac spkg.

Unfortunately this will only work as is on systems without giac. With giac, the optional test is done which (if not linked with pynac as was removed with the first commit) will trigger a Pynac bug.

So the optional doctest must be removed as well. Still positive?

Well, it seems the checks for giac (more precisely, linking to the library) in `configure` aren't sufficient.

As you say it applies to Debian only---here on OpenSuSE libao is sufficient and there should be no reason why Pynac would need something that isn't already there after `sage -i giac` has finished. If `-lao` is needed by Sage then already then, isn't it?

I'd say solve it upstream if you find the time, and we can eventually revert the changes here with one of the next releases of pynac.

Or we could make Sage's giac package a standard one.
