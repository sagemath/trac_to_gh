Implement subclasses of `PartitionTuples` for Kleshchev partition tuples. These partition tuples index the simple modules for the cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type A and the crystal basis of corresponding integrable highest weight modules for the affine special linear groups.

```python
sage: KleshchevPartitions(5,[3,2,1],size=3)[:]
sage: sorted(KleshchevPartitions(5,[3,2,1],size=3)[:])
[([], [], [1, 1, 1]),
 ([], [], [2, 1]),
 ([], [], [3]),
 ([], [1], [1, 1]),
 ([], [1], [2]),
 ([], [1, 1], [1]),
 ([], [2], [1]),
 ([], [3], []),
 ([1], [], [1, 1]),
 ([1], [], [2]),
 ([1], [1], [1]),
 ([1], [2], []),
 ([1, 1], [1], []),
 ([2], [], [1]),
 ([2], [1], []),
 ([3], [], [])
]
sage: sorted(KleshchevPartitions(5,[3,2,1],3,convention="left regular")[:])
[([], [], [1, 1, 1]),
 ([], [1], [1, 1]),
 ([], [1], [2]),
 ([], [1, 1], [1]),
 ([], [1, 1, 1], []),
 ([1], [], [1, 1]),
 ([1], [1], [1]),
 ([1], [1, 1], []),
 ([1], [2], []),
 ([1, 1], [], [1]),
 ([1, 1], [1], []),
 ([1, 1, 1], [], []),
 ([2], [], [1]),
 ([2], [1], []),
 ([2, 1], [], []),
 ([3], [], [])]
```

There is significant overlap between this patch and part of #15584, which implements the corresponding crystals so these patches should be merged. The labellings used for these sets of multipartitions in #15584 matches the `"down"` direction:

```python
sage: C = crystals.KleshchevPartitions(4, [3,2,1])
sage: sorted([p for p in C.subcrystal(max_depth=3) if sum(sum(l) for l in p.value.value) == 3],
....:        key=lambda x: [list(part) for part in x.value.value])
[([], [], [1, 1, 1]),
 ([], [1], [1, 1]),
 ([], [1], [2]),
 ([], [1, 1], [1]),
 ([], [1, 1, 1], []),
 ([1], [], [1, 1]),
 ([1], [1], [1]),
 ([1], [1, 1], []),
 ([1], [2], []),
 ([1, 1], [], [1]),
 ([1, 1], [1], []),
 ([1, 1, 1], [], []),
 ([2], [], [1]),
 ([2], [1], []),
 ([2, 1], [], []),
 ([3], [], [])]
```

Great. I noticed that I had too many tuples yesterday but didn't have time to investigate. I thought that I just needed to add the direction to the calls to the good nodes routines in order to get the labelling that you are using but, in addition, I should have changed `cell<=c` to `cell>=c`. With this fix to the code our labellings agree. I also separated the four different iterations (for up/down and level 1/higher levels) into their own methods.

With these changes in place the timing for my code are:

```
sage: %timeit KleshchevPartitions(5,[3,2,1],3)[:]
100 loops, best of 3: 6.44 ms per loop
sage: %timeit KleshchevPartitions(5,[3,2,1],3, direction="down")[:]
100 loops, best of 3: 6.62 ms per loop
```
Mind you I am not sure how meaningful this is as there is probably some caching going on with `UniqueRepresentation`. Not sure how to compare with your code as I couldn't produce any timings for it (sage complained with a `TypeError`...).

We already have a class for regular partitions, and essentially we have a class for restricted partitions (which is easy enough to "resurrect").

This possibility had occurred to me but I thought to ignore it. What do you think of having simple_labelling as an option but making it possible to over ride this when calling KleshchevPartitions and then hard-wiring the choice into the class. So I am thinking:

    sage: KleshchevPartitions(3)
    regular Kleshchev partitions with e=3
    sage: KleshchevPartitions(3, labelling='restricted')
    restricted Kleshchev partitions with e=3

My main aim was to get rid of the need to specify the convention in all of the (co)good, (co)normal, mullineux_map, ... methods You are likely to object to my removing the direction from these as well as with my current of the code the only way to get the previous functionality is with a kludge like:

    simple_labelling = Partitions.options.simple_labelling
    Partitions.options.simple_labelling='restricted'
    mu.good_nodes(3)
    Partitions.options.simple_labelling = simple_labelling

I thought about giving GlobalOptions a context manager to make it possible to instead write

    with Partitions.options.simple_labelling:

        Partitions.options.simple_labelling='restricted'
        mu.good_nodes(3)

but I am not sure if this is a good idea...

Btw, with the default "direction" (simple_labelling is more meaningful I think), it used to be "down" but during the code revisions it seems to have changed to "up" in some places but not others (in particular the documentation). My preference for "restricted Kleshchev's" but I am not really fussed. What would you like to me to make it?
