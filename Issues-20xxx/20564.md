Implement subclasses of `PartitionTuples` for Kleshchev partition tuples. These partition tuples index the simple modules for the cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type A and the crystal basis of corresponding integrable highest weight modules for the affine special linear groups.

```python
sage: KleshchevPartitions(5,[3,2,1],size=3)[:]
sage: sorted(KleshchevPartitions(5,[3,2,1],size=3)[:])
[([], [], [1, 1, 1]),
 ([], [], [2, 1]),
 ([], [], [3]),
 ([], [1], [1, 1]),
 ([], [1], [2]),
 ([], [1, 1], [1]),
 ([], [2], [1]),
 ([], [3], []),
 ([1], [], [1, 1]),
 ([1], [], [2]),
 ([1], [1], [1]),
 ([1], [2], []),
 ([1, 1], [1], []),
 ([2], [], [1]),
 ([2], [1], []),
 ([3], [], [])
]
sage: sorted(KleshchevPartitions(5,[3,2,1],3,convention="left regular")[:])
[([], [], [1, 1, 1]),
 ([], [1], [1, 1]),
 ([], [1], [2]),
 ([], [1, 1], [1]),
 ([], [1, 1, 1], []),
 ([1], [], [1, 1]),
 ([1], [1], [1]),
 ([1], [1, 1], []),
 ([1], [2], []),
 ([1, 1], [], [1]),
 ([1, 1], [1], []),
 ([1, 1, 1], [], []),
 ([2], [], [1]),
 ([2], [1], []),
 ([2, 1], [], []),
 ([3], [], [])]
```

There is significant overlap between this patch and part of #15584, which implements the corresponding crystals so these patches should be merged. The labellings used for these sets of multipartitions in #15584 matches the `"down"` direction:

```python
sage: C = crystals.KleshchevPartitions(4, [3,2,1])
sage: sorted([p for p in C.subcrystal(max_depth=3) if sum(sum(l) for l in p.value.value) == 3],
....:        key=lambda x: [list(part) for part in x.value.value])
[([], [], [1, 1, 1]),
 ([], [1], [1, 1]),
 ([], [1], [2]),
 ([], [1, 1], [1]),
 ([], [1, 1, 1], []),
 ([1], [], [1, 1]),
 ([1], [1], [1]),
 ([1], [1, 1], []),
 ([1], [2], []),
 ([1, 1], [], [1]),
 ([1, 1], [1], []),
 ([1, 1, 1], [], []),
 ([2], [], [1]),
 ([2], [1], []),
 ([2, 1], [], []),
 ([3], [], [])]
```

There are also duplicates in the `"down"` iteration. For this, I think we should just use the crystal iteration from #15584, which seems to match. Do you agree?

Great. I noticed that I had too many tuples yesterday but didn't have time to investigate. I thought that I just needed to add the direction to the calls to the good nodes routines in order to get the labelling that you are using but, in addition, I should have changed `cell<=c` to `cell>=c`. With this fix to the code our labellings agree. I also separated the four different iterations (for up/down and level 1/higher levels) into their own methods.

With these changes in place the timing for my code are:

```
sage: %timeit KleshchevPartitions(5,[3,2,1],3)[:]
100 loops, best of 3: 6.44 ms per loop
sage: %timeit KleshchevPartitions(5,[3,2,1],3, direction="down")[:]
100 loops, best of 3: 6.62 ms per loop
```
Mind you I am not sure how meaningful this is as there is probably some caching going on with `UniqueRepresentation`. Not sure how to compare with your code as I couldn't produce any timings for it (sage complained with a `TypeError`...).

I've done the first round of fusing the two implementations, and with your version of (co)normal/good cells, I was not getting a crystal structure. I changed things around so that they matched Kleshchev's article for the definition of (co)normal/good. Please check that you agree with them. I haven't updated the doctests yet so tests do not pass (and there's still more documentation to add/fix).

I still need to define a similar crystal structure for the level 1 partition tuples. I'm debating whether to use the current setup or to have it delegate to `e`-regular partitions (and implement a parent for `e`-restricted partitions). Any preferences?

We already have a class for regular partitions, and essentially we have a class for restricted partitions (which is easy enough to "resurrect").

I liked the fact that everything was tied to one parent called `KleshchevPartitions`, but I think it is better to utilize the separate classes for the essentially distinct behaviors and to take advantage of their specializations.

We have both given by passing the `direction`.

There is also which way we order the partition tuples, which I believe corresponds to which tensor product convention we use. Do we also want to deal with that as well?

This possibility had occurred to me but I thought to ignore it. What do you think of having simple_labelling as an option but making it possible to over ride this when calling KleshchevPartitions and then hard-wiring the choice into the class. So I am thinking:

    sage: KleshchevPartitions(3)
    regular Kleshchev partitions with e=3
    sage: KleshchevPartitions(3, labelling='restricted')
    restricted Kleshchev partitions with e=3

My main aim was to get rid of the need to specify the convention in all of the (co)good, (co)normal, mullineux_map, ... methods You are likely to object to my removing the direction from these as well as with my current of the code the only way to get the previous functionality is with a kludge like:

    simple_labelling = Partitions.options.simple_labelling
    Partitions.options.simple_labelling='restricted'
    mu.good_nodes(3)
    Partitions.options.simple_labelling = simple_labelling

I thought about giving GlobalOptions a context manager to make it possible to instead write

    with Partitions.options.simple_labelling:

        Partitions.options.simple_labelling='restricted'
        mu.good_nodes(3)

but I am not sure if this is a good idea...

Btw, with the default "direction" (simple_labelling is more meaningful I think), it used to be "down" but during the code revisions it seems to have changed to "up" in some places but not others (in particular the documentation). My preference for "restricted Kleshchev's" but I am not really fussed. What would you like to me to make it?

I feel it is too easy to break things (likely in subtle ways) with a global option. I certainly can understand the reason why you want to get rid of the convention. Well, perhaps a middle ground solution would be to add it as a global option as a default for the convention, where if the convention is not specified, it would go to the global option. For example:

```sage
def foo(self, direction=None):
    if direction is None:
        direction = self.parent().global_option.direction
    return direction
```
The other option would be to explicitly tie it to the parent. Oh, here's an much better idea:

```sage
def foo(self):
    try:
        direction = self.parent()._direction
    except AttributeError:
        direction = self.parent().global_option.direction
    return direction
```
That way we wouldn't have to move the methods away from the general partition (tuples) class. We get a global option for general parents, but for parents which depend on the direction (i.e., `KleshchevPartitions`), it avoids the global option altogether and becomes an implementation detail.

IMO, a context manager seems like complete overkill and likely would require extra boilerplate code.
