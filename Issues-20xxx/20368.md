Argh: your comment made me realize that integers already had a `squarefree_part()` method that uses a different definition of the squarefree part.

Good to notice that in this time and not later...

Can you also check #20369, if there will be something similar problem?

Okay, assuming I read the definition correctly, the two versions should now agree. Unfortunately, I don't know how to test if that's the case, since integers don't implement `squarefree_decomposition()`. I guess we should implement a generic `squarefree_decomposition()`, perhaps as part of this ticket, but I don't have time for that right now.

I found no mention of `elementary_divisor()` anywhere in the sage source code, so I guess there won't be the same problem. Of course, there could always be another inconsistency regarding who knows what convention or definitions, like there are so many in sage!

I think that you should look at `radical()` in `arith/misc.py` and probably remove the implementation using `factor()` from that.
