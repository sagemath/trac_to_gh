Argh: your comment made me realize that integers already had a `squarefree_part()` method that uses a different definition of the squarefree part.

Good to notice that in this time and not later...

Can you also check #20369, if there will be something similar problem?

Okay, assuming I read the definition correctly, the two versions should now agree. Unfortunately, I don't know how to test if that's the case, since integers don't implement `squarefree_decomposition()`.

I found no mention of `elementary_divisor()` anywhere in the sage source code, so I guess there won't be the same problem. Of course, there could always be another inconsistency regarding who knows what convention or definitions, like there are so many in sage!

I guess we should implement a generic `squarefree_decomposition()`, perhaps as part of this ticket, but I don't have time for that right now.\n\n\nI changed my mind about that. The squarefree decomposition is very useful for polynomials because it can be computed efficiently, but not that interesting for, say, integers, where it requires(?) factoring. So perhaps it is actually better to leave it unimplemented until someone really needs it (as opposed to something like `radical()`) for something else than polynomials.\n\nReplying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A8):\n> I think that you should look at `radical()` in `arith/misc.py` and probably remove the implementation using `factor()` from that.\n\n\nThanks for the suggestion.

> Unfortunately, I don't know how to test if that's the case, since integers don't implement `squarefree_decomposition()`. I guess we should implement a generic `squarefree_decomposition()`, perhaps as part of this ticket, but I don't have time for that right now.


I changed my mind about that. The squarefree decomposition is very useful for polynomials because it can be computed efficiently, but not that interesting for, say, integers, where it requires(?) factoring. So perhaps it is actually better to leave it unimplemented until someone really needs it (as opposed to something like `radical()`) for something else than polynomials.

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A8):
> I think that you should look at `radical()` in `arith/misc.py` and probably remove the implementation using `factor()` from that.


Thanks for the suggestion. I moved the implementation using `factor()` to my new method.
