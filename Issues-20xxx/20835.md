- I simplified the output message of `_repr_` and `_latex_`. I also noticed other encoders in `linear_code.py` were outputting `Encoder blah for the Code blah`, while Sage convention is to write `Encoder blah for Code blah`. I fixed this as well.

- I renamed `rank_profile_column_indices` into `systematic_positions`, and utterly simplified its implementation.

- I also added details on the encoding, and what we call "systematic form" to the class docstring.

This is still open for review.
