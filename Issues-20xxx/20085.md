I do not understand what you mean here.

> Note also that I test Pynac fully before a new version, so you need to do a `make ptestlong` yourself before giving positive review.


The ticket is not even in `needs_review` state yet; if you intend to release a new pynac release soon, I would just wait for that (and update the branch then).

The main purpose of the ticket is to have a workaround for #20082 *now* because it bites me in my current work.

Is there a particular reason for choosing milestone "sage-7.2"?

I always change it blindly to the highest. I don't know why there is a 7.2 when usually the highest is the same as the current version.
