I do not understand what you mean here.

> Note also that I test Pynac fully before a new version, so you need to do a `make ptestlong` yourself before giving positive review.


The ticket is not even in `needs_review` state yet; if you intend to release a new pynac release soon, I would just wait for that (and update the branch then).

The main purpose of the ticket is to have a workaround for #20082 *now* because it bites me in my current work.
