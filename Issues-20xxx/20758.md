The `add_face` method currently deletes the `__enlarged` cache, but this is unnecessary.

The `_faces` cache was also not treated properly, in both `add_face` and `remove_face`. For `add_face`, for example, you can see this if instead of the change here, you just delete the line `self.__enlarged = {`}: a doctest will fail because of an incorrect homology calculation, because of the wrong cached value for `_faces`.

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:6\" align=\"right\">comment:6</div>\n\nThis is fallout from #20718: in that ticket, we changed from using `self.n_faces(dim)` to using `self.faces()[dim]`, but the former allows values of `dim` greater than the dimension of the complex: it just returns the empty set in that case. So we can continue with the philosophy in #20718, that we want to avoid `n_faces`, or we can restore its use in some cases. The fix is easy either way, we just need to decide what to do.

I don't understand this error. With my branch, there is no line in the entire Sage source tree matching `return x in self.faces()[dim]`. The most recent changes one line (and I think the relevant line, from the `__contains__` method) to

```
return dim in self.faces() and x in self.faces()[dim]
```
so this error should not happen.

All tests pass for me. I started over, checking out the branch all over again, and all tests still pass.
