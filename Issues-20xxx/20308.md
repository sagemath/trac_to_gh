Currently there is a generic method zeta_series for schemes over a finite field, but not zeta_function. It would be useful to have the latter so that zeta_series could invoke it when it is implemented (which hopefully will happen for hyperelliptic curves soon).

At the same time, also make zeta_series work over nonprime fields.

Keywords: zeta function, scheme, finite field, sd87

It's not clear to me what the goal here is. The initial code seems to be using the zeta_function call to try and compute the zeta series as opposed to trying to compute zeta functions for generic schemes.

I've improved the zeta_series code to allow for non-prime base fields.

Sorry, am on vacation this week and hence unable to participate in sd87, but I can still clarify what I had in mind here!

What I had in mind is that the generic .zeta_function() returns a NotImplementedError. Then the generic .zeta_series() method would check for the existence of a .zeta_function() method, and if present would call it and convert the rational function into a power series instead of falling back to manually counting points.
