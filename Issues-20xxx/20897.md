#20322 fixed the standard `sage` CLI so that if `SAGE_BANNER=bare`, the simplified, non-unicode banner is displayed.

However, there were several other places this directive was not obeyed.  First `sage --help` would still display the full banner regardless.  Second, the built-in `banner()` function (from what the banner file is generated) also does not obey `SAGE_BANNER=bare`.

Because there is code that calls `banner()` directly, it should still only display the simplified banner if the `SAGE_BANNER=bare` variable is set in the environment (this is particularly relevant in the Docker container on Windows...)

(This bug caused a live demo to fail!  (Mysteriously the same demo did not fail when I tested it minutes earlier....not sure why it suddenly changed))

ok, you are right.

But now I am worried by something else, in sage-update-version

SAGE_RELEASE_DATE was used there and is no longer used anywhere. Are you creating some kind of circular thing, where nobody takes care of doing the real job ?

There is already code [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/misc/banner.py?id=1ade53383dec21e76b7b00ffc031c30b7a5ddfee#n18) which prints the exact same thing as the `echo "SageMath version $SAGE_VERSION, Release Date: $SAGE_RELEASE_DATE"`.  I see no point in having two things that produce the same output.

The only reason I replace it with `banner(full=False)` instead of `version()` is for symmetry.  

`banner()` was updated to wrap `version()` (by way of `full=False`) to incorporate consistent handling of the `SAGE_BANNER` environment variable, as `banner()` is already called in a few other parts of the code (including by sagenb) without respecting `SAGE_BANNER`.

ok, ok. I am still not very convinced, but this is enough.

Could you please add one doctest for `full=False` in `banner_text` ?

Then I will give a positive review.
