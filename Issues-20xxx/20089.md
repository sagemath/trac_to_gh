Here under the hood, `RR.acos` gets called. I think this should return meaningful values even if the value is outside the domain.

```
sage: cos(1.*I)
1.54308063481524        <--- CC element
sage: acos(_)
1.00000000000000*I
sage: acos(1.54308063481524)
NaN
sage: acos(CC(1.54308063481524))
0.999999999999997*I
sage: acos(RR(1.54308063481524))
NaN
```
Neither SymPy nor Pari nor Maxima do this: 

```
In [1]: acos(1.543)
Out[1]: 0.999931383282944⋅ⅈ
? acos(1.543)
%1 = 0.99993138328294395810833497263866793658*I

Replying to [ticket:20089 rws]:

Are you suggesting

```
sage: parent(1.0)
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
```
