<div id="comment:0"></div>

Here under the hood, `RR.acos` gets called. I think this should return meaningful values even if the value is outside the domain.

```
sage: cos(1.*I)
1.54308063481524        <--- CC element
sage: acos(_)
1.00000000000000*I
sage: acos(1.54308063481524)
NaN
sage: acos(CC(1.54308063481524))
0.999999999999997*I
sage: acos(RR(1.54308063481524))
NaN
```
Neither SymPy nor Pari nor Maxima do this: 

```
In [1]: acos(1.543)
Out[1]: 0.999931383282944⋅ⅈ
? acos(1.543)
%1 = 0.99993138328294395810833497263866793658*I
(%i1) acos(1.543);
(%o1)                        0.9999313832829438 %i
```

Replying to [@rwst](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/20089#comment:0):
> why are floats of type `RR` not `CC`?

Are you suggesting

```
sage: parent(1.0)
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
```
