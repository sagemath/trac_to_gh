The current implementation to compute minimal non-faces of simplicial complexes is really slow:

```
sage: SC = SimplicialComplex([(0,1,2),
 (0,2,3),
 (2,3,4),
 (1,2,4),
 (1,4,5),
 (0,3,6),
 (3,6,7),
 (4,5,7)])
sage: %time SC.minimal_nonfaces()
CPU times: user 11 s, sys: 140 ms, total: 11.2 s
Wall time: 11.2 s
{(3, 4, 7), (5, 6), (0, 4), (0, 5), (3, 5), (4, 6), (2, 5), (0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7)}
```

This is a difficult problem in general, but it seems that the algorithm could be improved with not too much efforts. I made a first try here:

```
sage: %time SC.minimal_nonfaces()
CPU times: user 881 µs, sys: 326 µs, total: 1.21 ms
Wall time: 1.21 ms
{(3, 4, 7), (0, 7), (0, 4), (0, 5), (3, 5), (1, 7), (2, 5), (5, 6), (1, 3), (4, 6), (2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 6)}
```

Sage7.1.beta4 gives:

sage -t simplicial_complex.py
    [483 tests, 6.84 s]

---
All tests passed!

---

With the patch it gives:

sage -t simplicial_complex.py
    [483 tests, 5.70 s]

---
All tests passed!

---

Of course, there are definitely cases where the presented new implementation will be slow. I am open to include any improvement if you have suggestions.

`@`Christian: Do you think you could profile the following example in polymake (it is the multi-cluster complex A_3 with k=2):

sage: SC = SimplicialComplex({(0, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11), (0, 1, 7, 8, 9, 11), (2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10), (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11), (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9), (0, 1, 8, 9, 10, 11), (0, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10), (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8), (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6), (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9), (0, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11), (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), (5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), (0, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10), (1, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11), (0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 11), (0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 11), (4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11), (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9), (1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11), (1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 11), (0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 11), (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 11), (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10), (0, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10), (3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11), (0, 2, 6, 8, 10, 11), (1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9), (0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7), (0, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11), (1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10), (0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9), (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), (1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 11), (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 11), (0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9), (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 11), (0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 10), (0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9), (2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11), (3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11), (0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 11), (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), (0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9), (5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11), (0, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11), (0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), (0, 1, 3, 5, 9, 11), (0, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), (3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11), (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11), (2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9), (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11), (0, 1, 3, 9, 10, 11), (1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11), (0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10), (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11), (3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11), (2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10), (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 11), (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), (0, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11), (0, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10), (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9), (0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8), (3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10), (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9), (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7), (0, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11), (0, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), (2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9), (0, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10), (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11), (0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10), (0, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11), (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8), (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11), (0, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11), (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9), (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11), (0, 1, 5, 7, 9, 11), (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), (0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 11)})

Just from a quick lookthrough:

- I would use `itertools` instead `Subsets`:

  ```
  sage: S = (1,2,3,4)
  sage: %timeit list(Subsets(S,2))
  10000 loops, best of 3: 162 µs per loop
  sage: %timeit list(itertools.combinations(S,2))
  The slowest run took 27.61 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
  1000000 loops, best of 3: 907 ns per loop
  sage: S = range(20)
  sage: %timeit list(itertools.combinations(S,9))
  100 loops, best of 3: 14.8 ms per loop
  sage: %timeit list(Subsets(S,9))
  1 loop, best of 3: 3.8 s per loop
  ```
  (Actually, we probably should change the iterator for `Subset` to use `itertools`.)
- In general, I would try to avoid using Sage's `Set` at much as possible (which we should cythonize). Instead, I would use python's (`frozen`)`set`s. This way we avoid the overhead.

Nice, at least a 5x speedup. My last comments:

- `any((set_candidate.issuperset(mnf) for mnf in set_mnf))` the inner parenthesis `()` are redundant.
- `set_mnf` can be a `set` and `set_mnf = set_mnf.union(frozenset([set_candidate]))` could become `set_mnf.add(set_candidate)`.
- Change `cube.append([0, ])` -> `cube.append([0])` (and the same for `[1, ]`.
- Add the example in the ticket description as a doctest (maybe with a comment indicating that this was slow before this ticket).

Once you make these changes, you can consider it a positive review by me.

`@`Christian: I guess you were profiling in polymake, right? I am profiling on my old laptop (5yo macbook pro).

For A3, k=3 it takes 16.4ms.

For A3, k=4 it takes:
CPU times: user 16.7 s, sys: 1.3 s, total: 18 s
Wall time: 18.2 s

For A4, k=2 it takes:
CPU times: user 1.77 s, sys: 643 ms, total: 2.41 s
Wall time: 2.45 s

For A4, k=3 it takes:
CPU times: user 1min 34s, sys: 3.06 s, total: 1min 37s
Wall time: 1min 40s

I don't really know why it takes so long on the Wall time, but the 'sys' time looks like 3sec. So I think it is good enough!

If everyone is happy I will set it now to positive review
