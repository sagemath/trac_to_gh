Looks like I missed the announcement for 9.8.1 I am still at 9.8.0. Unfortunately we cannot take advantage of the threading until a number of things are resolved. Threading requires C++11 and a number of packages are behind the curve.
We need #17635 so `givaro`, `fflas-ffpack` and `linbox` will be using C++11, I have a PR with `eclib` that John is ready to merge and then a new release needs to be cut. Finally `singular` and `flint` will need to be hacked. I have a proof of concept for those in sage-on-gentoo.

Do you want to go ahead with the upgrade and do the threading later?

Yes, let's just upgrade and go with threading later on.
In mainstream Sage we are quite late regarding version number anyway.

OK it should just be straight forward with the exception of disabling cpu specific instructions for binary build. Since I think 9.6.0 `ntl` does some automatic detection for avx and fma stuff and we will want to turn that off for binary build. The option to pass is `NATIVE=off`.

Tests pass here with 9.8.0 I cannot imagine 9.8.1 would break anything.
