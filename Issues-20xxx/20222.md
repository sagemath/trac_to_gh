When running Sage doctests for the very first time (with an empty `DOT_SAGE` directory):

```
sage -t --long src/sage/geometry/fan.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/geometry/fan.py", line 2887, in sage.geometry.fan.?.plot
Failed example:
    fan.plot()
Expected:
    Graphics object consisting of 31 graphics primitives
Got:
    doctest:273: UserWarning: Matplotlib is building the font cache using fc-list. This may take a moment.
    Graphics object consisting of 31 graphics primitives
**********************************************************************

Expected nothing
Got:

   1 of  15 in sage.categories.coxeter_groups.CoxeterGroups.ElementMethods.bruhat_lower_covers
    [461 tests, 1 failure, 18.31 s]
```

Of course, the failures go away when the tests are rerun. Any way we can avoid these failures?

That's not really possible because the relevant matplotlib files are *user* files (inside `$DOT_SAGE`, which is typically in `$HOME`), not *system* files.
