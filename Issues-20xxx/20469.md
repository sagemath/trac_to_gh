Here is the first version. I still have to convert from Ariki-Koike's version to the Hu-Mathas definition, but this version seems to work (in particular, it passed a few of my associativity tests and the relations I tested). There is also more documentation that needs to be added. I'm also not completely satisfied with the default base ring. However, I wanted to get feedback.

Note that the multiplication is highly recursive. In particular, once there is an l<sub>i</sub><sup>r</sup> occurring, it can easily run into Python's recursion limit. It might be possible to work this out with handling the manipulations within the code here or doing parts of the multiplication in bigger chunks. However, this would take a lot of work I think to improve and the code works.

I am also planning on implementing the isomorphism with type A<sub>n</sub>/B<sub>n</sub> Hecke algebras shortly too.

Thanks Travis. This looks interesting. I will have a play with it and see if I can improve the multiplication with the tricks that I know about these algebras -- I am not promising that this will be possible, only to look!

Some initial comments: 
- It would be better to use `L1`,`...`,`Ln` for the Jucys-Murphy elements as this is what is commonly used in the literature and it's also consistent with using `T1`,`T2`,`...` for the Hecke generators. Using `l1`,`...`,`ln` looks strange to me.
- I am not sure that it is worth the effort to define the Hu-Mathas as the algebras that we defined are different to these when `q=1` and, more importantly, the conversion between the two is easy in principle but messy in practice. 
- The default base ring should be the smallest ring that contains `q`, `u0`,...,`ur`.
- At some stage I will polish the code that I have which implements the Specht modules for these algebras. Given this it would probably be a good idea to put this code in its own subdirectory so that the module code. Similarly, my graded Specht module could go in here to.

Replying to [@AndrewAtLarge](#comment%3A3):
> Thanks Travis. This looks interesting. I will have a play with it and see if I can improve the multiplication with the tricks that I know about these algebras -- I am not promising that this will be possible, only to look!

Great, thanks. It is currently so recursive that it fails for `L2 * L1 * L2` in `H(2,2)` (although `L1 * (L2)^2` works).

> - It would be better to use `L1`,`...`,`Ln` for the Jucys-Murphy elements as this is what is commonly used in the literature and it's also consistent with using `T1`,`T2`,`...` for the Hecke generators. Using `l1`,`...`,`ln` looks strange to me.

Done.

> - I am not sure that it is worth the effort to define the Hu-Mathas as the algebras that we defined are different to these when `q=1` and, more importantly, the conversion between the two is easy in principle but messy in practice.

This also leads to a question of what do we want to call the Hu-Mathas variant? In the future, we can also add another basis to this for `q \neq 1`. We also should probably add the basis indexed by the colored permutations (i.e., monomials in `T_0, ..., T_{n-1}`).

> - The default base ring should be the smallest ring that contains `q`, `u0`,...,`ur`.

With `q` invertible, that is what it currently does (just in a slightly funky way that groups the `u`'s together then the `q`'s).

> - At some stage I will polish the code that I have which implements the Specht modules for these algebras. Given this it would probably be a good idea to put this code in its own subdirectory so that the module code. Similarly, my graded Specht module could go in here to.

I have moved this into a `hecke_algebras` folder to start. We can move the rest of the Hecke algebras (e.g., Iwahori and Yokonuma) to this folder on a followup ticket.

While adding the documentation, I also found some errors with the multiplication that I have fixed.

Hi Travis,

I have been through your code and fixed the recursion issue. It was actually an infinite recursion loop. The problem was that as the terms in the products `....T_i L_k...` were being put into standard form "letter-by-letter" (so changing the previous expression to `\sum ...

I have rewritten the `product_on_basis` code to avoid this, so I'm afraid that I've replaced this section of your code. The product code is now less recursive with terms largely being rewritten into standard form "in place". 

On top of this I proved a formula for the expansion of `L_k^m` that, embarrassingly, I later found in one of my papers. This was my first guess for improving the multiplication issues but once I'd made this change I discovered the recursion loop. The other main change is that I rescaled `L_k` to `q**{1-k}*L_k`, in [AK] notation, because this renormalisation is what is normally used in the literature as it works better with the combinatorics.

I think it is good to try and be as general as possible when it is not much work. I agree, I think it would be very annoying to switch because we would have to redo all of the product formulas (at least, I would have to put some thought on how to do this to make everything consistent).

I think we should give the base ring to better differentiate the instances. Plus this is consistent with what we do elsewhere in Sage. One slight issue is the default ring is a polynomial ring over a polynomial ring, and it is this that makes the repr very long. I decided to do this for the default ring so the q's would be grouped together.

This said, I would prefer to have the more symmetric relations `(T_i-q)(T_i+q^{-1})=0`, so I will have a think about this.

Regarding KLR algebras, implementing the "affine" KLR algebras is reasonably straightforward. I know now of a way to do the cyclotomic quotients in a few cases and I will implement them at some point, although the isomorphism to the ungraded algebras is much harder to do.

I've found and fixed 2 bugs with the multiplication:

1. In `_product_LTwTv`, the coefficient `c` was not being multiplied in the second term.
2. In `_Li_power`, the formula was suppose to be q<sup>-1</sup> (q - 1) = 1 - q<sup>-1</sup>, but instead it was q - q<sup>-1</sup>. This fixes the associativity test.

Now all doctests are currently passing.

<a id='comment:19'>Comment 19:</a>
Here is a version with 2 bases: the `T` basis given by BM and `LT` basis given by AK.

From some testing, the `T` basis implementation is (currently) clearly the better basis:

```
sage: def test(B):

sage: H = algebras.ArikiKoike(3, 3)
sage: LT = H.LT()
sage: T = H.T()
sage: %time test(LT.basis())
CPU times: user 4min 30s, sys: 1.64 s, total: 4min 31s
Wall time: 4min 31s
sage: %time test(T.basis())
CPU times: user 1min 40s, sys: 739 ms, total: 1min 41s
Wall time: 1min 40s
```
In particular, this `LT` basis computation took over 5GB of RAM, whereas the `T` basis computation took less than 2GB. (The computation above involves all 26244 possible products.) The speed difference also holds for smaller dimensional spaces.

I do not think there is need to fix that because `_Li_power` is only used in the internal multiplication, which ultimately cancels or resolves out the issues with not doing proper reduction of the the L<sub>i</sub><sup>k</sup>. By not doing as many resolutions (which can generate large number of terms), it should be faster. Should I add something to the `_Li_power` docstring about this or run some timings to confirm?

Ah, I forgot about that explanation!

I think a comment on that would make sense, since `LT._Li_power(2,4) == L2**4` giving `False` is quite irritating.

I ran some timings to confirm my suspicions, and here is what I found:

```
sage: def test(LT):
....:     B = LT.basis()
....:     for b in B:
....:         for bp in B:
....:             dummy = b * bp
sage: H = algebras.ArikiKoike(4, 2)
sage: LT = H.LT()
sage: %time test(LT)
CPU times: user 3.49 s, sys: 6.16 ms, total: 3.5 s
Wall time: 3.5 s
sage: H = algebras.ArikiKoike(5, 2)
sage: LT = H.LT()
sage: %time test(LT)
CPU times: user 2min 50s, sys: 446 ms, total: 2min 51s
Wall time: 2min 51s
```
versus always resolving it out:

```
sage: H = algebras.ArikiKoike(4, 2)
sage: LT = H.LT()
sage: %time test(LT)
CPU times: user 3.16 s, sys: 23.5 ms, total: 3.18 s
Wall time: 3.18 s
sage: H = algebras.ArikiKoike(5, 2)
sage: LT = H.LT()
sage: %time test(LT)
CPU times: user 3min 14s, sys: 463 ms, total: 3min 14s
Wall time: 3min 14s
```
So it seems to be inconsistent with which one is better strangely enough. Memory-wise they seem to be similar. The latter is ~11% slower. So I implemented a hybrid approach and here is the timings for that:

```
sage: H = algebras.ArikiKoike(4, 2)
sage: LT = H.LT()
sage: %time test(LT)
CPU times: user 3.27 s, sys: 25.4 ms, total: 3.29 s
Wall time: 3.33 s
sage: H = algebras.ArikiKoike(5, 2)
sage: LT = H.LT()
sage: %time test(LT)
CPU times: user 3min 17s, sys: 389 ms, total: 3min 17s
Wall time: 3min 17s
```
So I think I will go with the hybrid, trying keep some of the benefits of both (less multiplication and strict correctness at intermediate steps). I suspect the last timing is a little skewed because I was doing a few other things on my computer at the time.

Which timings? I agree this will probably be worse than the previous version, but it cannot be worse than the fully-reduced-to-basis version.

Of course, I meant in the comparison with the previous version!

Agreed!
