Note that the multiplication is highly recursive. In particular, once there is an l<sub>i</sub><sup>r</sup> occurring, it can easily run into Python's recursion limit. It might be possible to work this out with handling the manipulations within the code here or doing parts of the multiplication in bigger chunks. However, this would take a lot of work I think to improve and the code works.

I am also planning on implementing the isomorphism with type A<sub>n</sub>/B<sub>n</sub> Hecke algebras shortly too.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Thanks Travis. This looks interesting. I will have a play with it and see if I can improve the multiplication with the tricks that I know about these algebras -- I am not promising that this will be possible, only to look!

Some initial comments: 
- It would be better to use `L1`,`...`,`Ln` for the Jucys-Murphy elements as this is what is commonly used in the literature and it's also consistent with using `T1`,`T2`,`...` for the Hecke generators. Using `l1`,`...`,`ln` looks strange to me.
- I am not sure that it is worth the effort to define the Hu-Mathas as the algebras that we defined are different to these when `q=1` and, more importantly, the conversion between the two is easy in principle but messy in practice. 
- The default base ring should be the smallest ring that contains `q`, `u0`,...,`ur`.
- At some stage I will polish the code that I have which implements the Specht modules for these algebras. Given this it would probably be a good idea to put this code in its own subdirectory so that the module code. Similarly, my graded Specht module could go in here to.

Great, thanks. It is currently so recursive that it fails for `L2 * L1 * L2` in `H(2,2)` (although `L1 * (L2)^2` works).

Done.

> - I am not sure that it is worth the effort to define the Hu-Mathas as the algebras that we defined are different to these when `q=1` and, more importantly, the conversion between the two is easy in principle but messy in practice.


This also leads to a question of what do we want to call the Hu-Mathas variant? In the future, we can also add another basis to this for `q \neq 1`. We also should probably add the basis indexed by the colored permutations (i.e., monomials in `T_0, ..., T_{n-1}`).

With `q` invertible, that is what it currently does (just in a slightly funky way that groups the `u`'s together then the `q`'s).

> - At some stage I will polish the code that I have which implements the Specht modules for these algebras. Given this it would probably be a good idea to put this code in its own subdirectory so that the module code. Similarly, my graded Specht module could go in here to.


I have moved this into a `hecke_algebras` folder to start. We can move the rest of the Hecke algebras (e.g., Iwahori and Yokonuma) to this folder on a followup ticket.

While adding the documentation, I also found some errors with the multiplication that I have fixed.

> - whether to allow the two parameter version: `(T_i-q1)(T_i+q2)=0`. Probably quite painful as all of the product formulas will change


I think it is good to try and be as general as possible when it is not much work. I agree, I think it would be very annoying to switch because we would have to redo all of the product formulas (at least, I would have to put some thought on how to do this to make everything consistent). So, I think this is plenty good for now.

> - whether to implement the degenerate algebras. This might be easy as it could be done as a derived class with slightly different `_product_LTwTv`, `_product_Tw_L`, and `_Li_power` methods


> - I think having a slightly shorter `_repr_` string would be a good idea: `Ariki-Koike algebra of rank 5 with parameters q,u0,u2,u3` is enough I think


I think we should give the base ring to better differentiate the instances. Plus this is consistent with what we do elsewhere in Sage. One slight issue is the default ring is a polynomial ring over a polynomial ring, and it is this that makes the repr very long. I decided to do this for the default ring so the q's would be grouped together.

> - implementing other bases? This is probably best left for another ticket...especially as I think that the realisations code currently requires that the same indexing sets be used(?)


I agree; this should be another ticket unless you have code ready. The realizations code itself does not require the same indexing set, but you have to do a bit more with the morphisms. For an example, see the descent algebra (`combinat/descent_algebra.py`).

> Any way, I think that the code now works. Please have a look and let me know what you think. Happy to be a reviewer or coauthor on the ticket as you think best.


I will play around with in shortly. We will both be both coauthors and reviewers (yet again :P).

Replying to [comment:9 andrew.mathas]:
> ps. With the degenerate algebras, the other option would be to use the Hu-Mathas presentation for the "main" algebra (this combines the Ariki-Koike algebras with `q\ne1` and the degenerate AK algebras (when `q=1`) and then implement the `q=1` version of the Ariki-Koike algebras as the "extra" case. I am biased, but personally I think that makes more sense because the Hu-M. presentation fits with the KLR categorifiction of integrable highest weight modules perfectly whereas the Ariki-Koike presentation does not. 


I'm +1 for getting things closer to the KLR algebra (something that I hope to eventually get into Sage at some point). Otherwise I don't have an opinion on which presentation we use. How much would have to be changed in order to move to the Hu-Mathas presentation?

With all of these things it is mainly a matter of implementing appropriate analogues of the three methods `_product_LTwTv`, `_product_Tw_L`, and `_Li_power` that underpin the multiplication.

Regarding KLR algebras, implementing the "affine" KLR algebras is reasonably straightforward. I know now of a way to do the cyclotomic quotients in a few cases and I will implement them at some point, although the isomorphism to the ungraded algebras is much harder to do.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Here is a version with 2 bases: the `T` basis given by BM and `LT` basis given by AK.

Ah, I forgot about that explanation!

I think a comment on that would make sense, since `LT._Li_power(2,4) == L2**4` giving `False` is quite irritating.

So I think I will go with the hybrid, trying keep some of the benefits of both (less multiplication and strict correctness at intermediate steps). I suspect the last timing is a little skewed because I was doing a few other things on my computer at the time.

Are you sure you want to keep the hybrid version? I repeated your test and the timing comparison was even worse.

What about the following suggestion: Rename `_Li_power` as something like `_prepare_Li_power` to avoid such irritation. In addition, leave your new test in the docstring returning `False` as an example that this method does not give the final result (but for this purpose you have to run it for `algebras.ArikiKoike(3, 4)`).

Furthermore, the local function `L` in `_Li_power` seems not to be used any more. Can't we delete it?

Which timings? I agree this will probably be worse than the previous version, but it cannot be worse than the fully-reduced-to-basis version.

> What about the following suggestion: Rename `_Li_power` as something like `_prepare_Li_power` to avoid such irritation. In addition, leave your new test in the docstring returning `False` as an example that this method does not give the final result (but for this purpose you have to run it for `algebras.ArikiKoike(3, 4)`).


I think that name is less descriptive. Plus it gives the correct result, just not necessarily in the basis elements, which is okay for an internal function not visible to the standard user. So if we decide revert the change, then I think just a warning would be sufficient.

> Furthermore, the local function `L` in `_Li_power` seems not to be used any more. Can't we delete it?


Yes, we can delete it.

Of course, I meant in the comparison with the previous version!

Agreed! 

Once this is done from my point of view we can let the ticket pass.
