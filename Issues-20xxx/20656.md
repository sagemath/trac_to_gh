The '_variables' attribute dictionary maps a "variable" (an "element" of a `MIPVariable` "dictionary") to an index in the backend. This is redundant because these "variables" are elements of type `LinearFunction`, and as such know their index in the backend already.

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='GLPK')
sage: pv = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
sage: pv[0]
x_0
sage: pv[77]
x_1
sage: pv[0].dict().keys()
[0]
sage: pv[77].dict().keys()
[1]
```
