Part of this is normal. Quitting works when using 

```
sage: gp.console()
```
Whereas `%gp` is an interactive access to the unique pari/gp session used by sage, which is automatically restarted when crashed.

What is not normal is the infinite restarting loop..

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

One way to gracefully exit the gp console seems to be using `Ctrl` + `D`.

```
sage: %gp

  --> Switching to PARI/GP interpreter <--

pari: <Ctrl + D>

  --> Exiting back to Sage <--

sage:
```

Should this be documented somewhere?

Can we prevent the infinite loop and make
`quit` behave the same as `Ctrl` + `D`?

Demoting from 'critical' to 'major'.
