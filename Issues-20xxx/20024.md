Part of this is normal. Quitting works when using 

```
sage: gp.console()
```
Whereas `%gp` is an interactive access to the unique pari/gp session used by sage, which is automatically restarted when crashed.

What is not normal is the infinite restarting loop..

One way to gracefully exit the gp console seems to be using `Ctrl` + `D`.

```
sage: %gp

  --> Switching to PARI/GP interpreter <--

pari: <Ctrl + D>

  --> Exiting back to Sage <--

sage:
```

Should this be documented somewhere?

Can we prevent the infinite loop and make
`quit` behave the same as `Ctrl` + `D`?

Demoting from 'critical' to 'major'.
