The file numbers_abc.py registers some Sage classes as instances of numbers.Rational, numbers.Integer, etc.  However, none of these classes implement the interfaces entirely correctly, because members that the interface expects to be properties (e. g. numerator and denominator in numbers.Rational) are instead functions.

Attempts to use these interfaces will fail in a way that may be confusing to the user:

```
sage: import fractions
sage: fractions.Fraction(1/2)
Fraction(<built-in method numerator of sage.rings.rational.Rational object at 0x7f4268425b30>, <built-in method denominator of sage.rings.rational.Rational object at 0x7f4268425b30>)
sage: fractions.Fraction(1,2)
