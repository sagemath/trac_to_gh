From Polymake SPKG.txt (#20892):

Should convert this old-style Sage package:
- qhull (#21143)

Need to improve this new-style Sage package:
- bliss (needs Debian patches; can't use the existing Sage package -- #20901)

Software that currently would need to be installed manually (no Sage package
available) for a more featureful Polymake installation:
- azove,
- porta,
- vinci,
- SplitsTree4,
- barvinok (which apparently brings its own Polymake extension) (#23547)

It does seem a bit like we're duplicating Debian packaging... In any case, patches can be lifted from there or other distributions.

Right, I've deleted "old-style" in the description. See #20901 for details.
