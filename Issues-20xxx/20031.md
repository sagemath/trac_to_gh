CC:  @nbruin @jdemeyer @vbraun

The following cause a memory leak

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', implementation='NTL')
sage: x = R.gen()
sage: p = x**2 - 1
sage: while True: a = p(1)
```

I propose to deal with this in #20192 instead.

In any case, if you want the fix to be applied, you need to increase the Cython version number.

I would like to add a doctest for that. Do you think that the following is strong enough

Did you try the example? The leak causes dangling objects on the python heap. However, `gc.get_objects()` will only find tracked objects, and tuples with too simple ingredients aren't tracked. However, when you put sufficiently complicated objects in there (such as `p`) then it is tracked. So the test does work.
