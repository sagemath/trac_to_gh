# Issue 20027: Different behavior for reflections for matrix Coxeter group and Weyl groups

```
Currently, we have the following behavior:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',1])
sage: W.reflections()
[[-1]]
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',1])
sage: W.reflections()
Finite family {[0 1]
[1 0]: (1, -1)}
```
In particular, the former returns a list of elements in the group, whereas the latter returns a family whose keys are elements in the group and whose values are roots. This leads to different iterator behaviors between the two. Since Weyl groups are a subcategory of Coxeter groups, we should make this behavior consistent.

Note, this was introduced by #11010 and is specific for the matrix implementation of `CoxeterGroup`. We can also lift this up to the category of (finite) Coxeter groups.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Hi Travis,

also in the light of hopefully having soon the `chevie` version of reflection groups:
* What do you think is the correct behaviour?
* Does it make sense to allow user labels of the reflections in the case of finite reflection groups? -- this might be interesting in the situation that you want to look for words in all reflections. (But that also puts another layer of possible bugs!)
There, is is currently

```
sage: ReflectionGroup(['A',1]).reflections()
Finite family {0: (1,2)}
sage: ReflectionGroup(['A',1],reflection_index_set=["A"]).reflections()
Finite family {'A': (1,2)}
```

for the complex reflection groups to come, this would not make sense, so if we want to have these to have similar behaviour, such an indexing would be bad.

Agreed. I meant: it's a reasonable indexing in the above example. I guess at this point we want to leave freedom of the indexing set, and only impose that reflections return a collection of elements of the group.

See Dyer "Hecke algebras and shellings of Bruhat intervals" for the importance of reflection orderings ;-). I usually want them to come at least in some "convex order" as in that paper...

Anyway, I am fine with giving freedom to the keys, and only force that iteration does iters through the actual reflections.

There will be some tutorials to correct, probably.

- no lifting to category on this ticket
