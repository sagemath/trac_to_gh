This is the lowest-hanging fruit in addressing the issues I raised in [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/20218#comment:16).

It changes `sage-uncompress-spkg` to apply the umask to all files and directories extracted from tarballs.

This doesn't apply to zipfiles since they do not contain permission information, though in principle we could modify zipfiles to use the same policy. I don't think it matters much though.

I would say that the `umask` *defines* what is safe. It is the thing which determines which permissions the user wants.
