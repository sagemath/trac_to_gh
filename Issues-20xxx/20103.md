This in some sense a followup to #6102 and in some sense a precursor for a future ticket for simplicial sets. This mainly involves some reorganization, not much new.

- Add a `reduced` keyword to the `homology` method, to make it easy to compute unreduced homology. (Computing reduced homology has always been the default, but it was a little inconvenient to compute the unreduced homology before.)
- Add an `is_acyclic` method for cell complexes.
- Instead of having a single `algebraic_topological_model` method for all cell complexes, broken into cases depending on the complex, instead each class which inherits from `GenericCellComplex` should implement its own method.
- Similarly, cell complexes should have an `alexander_whitney` method. This helps to clean up the cup product code; that code should be easy to maintain if we add more types of cell complexes.
- Change `__cmp__` to `__eq__` etc., for all types of cells and complexes. My understanding is that `__cmp__` is no longer used in Python 3, so we should eliminate it.
- For simplicial complexes, define a `face` method: then `K.face(sigma, i)` will return the ith face of `sigma` in `K`. This is not really useful on its own, but it gets used in the `Sq` method in `homology_vector_space_with_basis`. The point is, we could define cell complexes (like the current Delta complexes, and like simplicial sets) in which you can only compute the face of a cell by knowing about the complex in which it lives, and we might want to extend the `Sq` method to work with such complexes.

- The input block bullets are usually not considered to be sentences and typically lack periods.
- Use ``@`abstract_method` for the generic `alexander_whitney`.
- I think this would benefit from using ``@`total_ordering` (in reality, we probably should implement a generic `__ne__` for `Element`...) so we don't have so many little methods for all of the comparison operators.

Should this be done more widely? E.g. for `cells`, `product`, `disjoint_union`, etc.?

I think I tried this for one of the classes and ran into problems. I'll try again and see what happens. (Actually, this may have been for a draft of a simplex class for use with simplicial sets, and it might have been a conflict with `UniqueRepresentation` or `EqualityById` or something like that.)

Python sets are by definition unordered, so it seems safest to explicitly sort.

> - Should we cythonize `algebraic_topological_model` now? It probably won't be too hard and we could get some speedup from that.


I am probably not the person to do that. It could safely go on another ticket, since it seems independent of the changes here.

Probably (and maybe checking to see if it is not handled by the appropriate category).

It shouldn't have any problems because it is used for the elements, which are not subclasses of `EqualityById` (plus implementing an `__eq__` nullifies the use of that class). ``@`total_ordering` does modify the class, but this should be done at initialization of the module. Thus it is done before category framework gets its hands on it (via `Element`) when an instance of the parent class is created.

Right, but the doctesting framework sorts the output of (some) things automatically when running tests on a file to avoid having to do machine-independent/memory-independent tests. I'm not opposed to doing the sort, but just a note.

I can cythonize it on a separate ticket then.

It is completely opaque to me how this is done. Maybe by the code in `repl/display/pretty_print.py` and `fancy_repr.py`? I only see references to dictionaries being sorted by keys, not for other data types.

It's entirely possible we don't yet try to order `set` and only `dict`. Okay, then we will explicitly sort things.

This is now #20114.
