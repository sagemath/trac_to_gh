Refactor `coefficients_of_generating_function` (#20056) so that the part working with one singular expansion is now a separate method of an asymptotic expansion.

This allows to perform singularity analysis also in situations where the singular expansion has been obtained by other means than the simple approach for explicit generating functions of #19944 (and follow-ups #20040 and #20056), even while #20050 is not implemented.

For now, this is a hidden method because the input will change once #20050 is done.

Once #20050 is implemented, the dual choice of output of `coefficients_of_generating_function` may be changed: if users want to have singular expansions (in order to show them in their paper, for instance), they could convert it into a singular expansion by using #20050 (or its dependents) and then feed it into `singularity_analysis`.

See #17601 for the asymptotic expansions meta ticket.

This extensions does not work with more than one singularity as the same singular expansion is used for each singularity.

* Option 1: forbid more than one singularity
* Option 2: `function` could be a list of singular expansions
* Option 3: `function` could be a dictionary, as it is the case for the output when selected.

I do not like option 3, as it is not relevant once #20050 is implemented.

-Refactor `singularity_analysis` (#19944) so that it accepts a singular expansion obtained by other means. Without #20050, this is a bit hard to explain. In the end, with #20050 implemented, the dual choice of output (with singular expansions) could be omitted: if users want to have singular expansions (in order to show them in their paper, for instance), they could convert it into a singular expansion by using #20050 (or its dependents) and then feed it into `singularity_analysis`.
+Refactor `coefficients_of_generating_function` (#20056) so that the part working with one singular expansion is now a separate method of an asymptotic expansion.
+
+This allows to perform singularity analysis also in situations where the singular expansion has been obtained by other means than the simple approach for explicit generating functions of #19944 (and follow-ups #20040 and #20056), even while #20050 is not implemented.
+
+For now, this is a hidden method because the input will change once #20050 is done.
+
+Once #20050 is implemented, the dual choice of output of `coefficients_of_generating_function` may be changed: if users want to have singular expansions (in order to show them in their paper, for instance), they could convert it into a singular expansion by using #20050 (or its dependents) and then feed it into `singularity_analysis`.

This is now a complete rewrite following yesterday's discussions and #20056.

I now think that this is basically the point that we can reach without #20050, so this now awaits your review.

I've reviewed this implementation, and I only have one comment:

Could you revise the docstring of `AsymptoticExpansion._singularity_analysis_`? Because 

1. `var` can also be the generator of an asymptotic ring, 
2. `zeta` is the location of the singularity, and 
3. `precision` is **not** set to the default precision of the ring if it is omitted, but has the same behavior as the `SingularityAnalysis` method in the generators.

Do we want that the current behavior from 3 happens, so that the asymptotic contribution has the same precision as the singular expansion by default? Would be worth considering IMHO.

Other than that, `positive_review` form my side.

We cannot directly use the precision of this element, because we have no elegant means of defining the precision of an element (we will not introspect the group). Thus IMHO the only sensible default is the default precision of the parent of this element. Thus the behaviour is now changed.

The method `coefficients_of_generating_function` does not handle the precision, either, but that could be another ticket, if you want to open one. In any case, this is unrelated to this method here.

That is what I originally meant, thank you.

Yes, this would certainly be a new ticket, and I think that this is definitely worth opening one.

In any case: your changes look good to me, and I'll just wait for the patchbot before I set this to `positive_review`. Thank you!
