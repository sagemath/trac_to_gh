Normaliz is an excellent library for computations in affine monoids, vector configurations, lattice polytopes, and rational cones. There's a command-line program and a library (libnormaliz).

We already have normaliz as an optional package. 
This ticket:
- makes a shared library build of normaliz (using the new autotools build system of normaliz)
- adds the [PyNormaliz](https://github.com/sebasguts/PyNormaliz) package
- adds a Polyhedron_normaliz class (requested using backend='normaliz')
- ... which has fast implementations of `Polyhedron.integral_points()` (cf. #18029), `Polyhedron.integral_hull()`

To install both, put the upstream archives:   
- https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/releases/download/v3.1.4/normaliz-3.1.4.tar.gz 
- https://pypi.python.org/packages/8b/d3/46d35aa05d8d1b82c24d0e37905f9df7fed17ae41b78623e1d253c2f3b15/PyNormaliz-1.0.tar.gz#md5=27a5f7d3fa0d96766d4f811495b0f5ce
into `upstream/`
and then use:

```
   ./sage -f pynormaliz
```

See the examples in the `Polyhedron_normaliz` documentation.

On follow-up tickets, should:
- provide fast implementations of existing methods of Polyhedron, Cone, triangulations, ...
- provide new methods for Normaliz's additional features.

Adding these methods would not require Cython programming and would happen on several separate tickets. All it takes is reading the [Normaliz manual](https://www.normaliz.uni-osnabrueck.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Normaliz3.1.1Documentation.pdf)
