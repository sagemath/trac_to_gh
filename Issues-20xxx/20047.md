It doesn't install for me:

```
Processing dependencies for Flask-AutoIndex==0.6
Searching for future>=0.13.0

Note: Bypassing https://pypi.python.org/simple/future/ (disallowed host; see http://bit.ly/1dg9ijs for details).

Couldn't find index page for 'future' (maybe misspelled?)
Scanning index of all packages (this may take a while)

Note: Bypassing https://pypi.python.org/simple/ (disallowed host; see http://bit.ly/1dg9ijs for details).

No local packages or download links found for future>=0.13.0
error: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('future>=0.13.0')
Error: Installing Flask-AutoIndex-0.6.tar.gz failed.
