If `read_nonblocking()` detects an EOF condition, it should call `isalive()` to reap the child process.

    ExceptionPexpect: isalive() encountered condition where "terminated" is 0, but there was no child process. Did someone else call waitpid() on our process?
```

Unfortunately, sometimes `sage-cleaner` reaps the zombie process during `isalive()` resulting in this exception, which we don't handle in some cases, but that's a separate issue IIUC.
