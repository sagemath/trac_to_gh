The [surface_dynamics](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/surface_dynamics/) package provides much more functionalities (and fixes) than what is currently in Sage. This ticket proposes to deprecate all source code from `sage.dynamics.flat_surfaces` and `sage.dynamics.interval_exchanges` (with a message giving pointer to the actual package).

Reading `Permutation is deprecated and will be removed from Sage` is quite funny but we understand that it is the one in `iet` that is meant.

```
sage: T = iet.IntervalExchangeTransformation(Permutation([3,2,1]), [3,1,2])
....: 
/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/dynamics/interval_exchanges/constructors.py:985: DeprecationWarning: IntervalExchangeTransformation is deprecated and will be removed from Sage.
You are advised to install the surface_dynamics package via:
    sage -pip install surface_dynamics
If you do not have write access to the Sage installation you can
alternatively do
    sage -pip install surface_dynamics --user
The package surface_dynamics subsumes all flat surface related
computation that are currently available in Sage. See more
information at
    http://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/surface-dynamics/latest/
See http://trac.sagemath.org/20695 for details.
