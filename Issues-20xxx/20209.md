I think a better solution would be to do

```python
def interval(self, field):
    target = RR(1.0) >> field.prec()
    val = self.interval_diameter(target)
    from sage.rings.real_mpfi import RealIntervalField_class
    if isinstance(field, RealIntervalField_class) and self.imag().is_zero():
        val = self.real().interval_diameter(target)
    return field(val)
```
(I would probably even put the import at the namespace level too.) That way we do not generate the error and catch it, which is a slow operation compared to an `isinstance` check:

```
sage: def foo():
....:     try:
....:         raise ValueError
....:     except ValueError:
....:         pass    
sage: %timeit foo()
The slowest run took 22.94 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 832 ns per loop
sage: def bar():
....:     return isinstance(RIF, type(RIF))
sage: %timeit bar()
The slowest run took 27.02 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 185 ns per loop
```
(This test is also somewhat unfair to the `isinstance` check.) I could see this conversion being used in a tight loop in many computations. (We also loose about 20ns just for having that try-except block.)

The operation `self.imag().is_zero()` is potentially costly ("exactification"). But we can check it on the interval instead. This is what contains the last commit.
