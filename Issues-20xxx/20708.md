```
1. Don't use the `-p` option at the top-level which only prints a useless `[install] `.

2. Use `sed` instead of `read/echo`. This preserves whitespace.

I think it's a bit silly to call this a "blocker" though don't you?

<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

The recent sage-logger changes from #20640 seem to cause a minor problem.

When installing an "experimental" package, Sage warns a lot and then prompts the user. 
Because of line buffering, one does not see the prompt, but Sage just waits indefinitely.

```
sage -f latte_int
...
[latte_int-1.7.3] =========================== WARNING ===========================
[latte_int-1.7.3] You are about to download and install an experimental package.
[latte_int-1.7.3] This probably won't work at all for you! There is no guarantee
[latte_int-1.7.3] that it will build correctly, or behave as expected.
[latte_int-1.7.3] Use at your own risk!
[latte_int-1.7.3] ===============================================================
```
<--- This is where it asks "[latte_int-1.7.3] Are you sure you want to continue [Y/n]?" but this is line-buffered and not visible to the user.
