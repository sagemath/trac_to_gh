The module docstring of `LinearCode` is vastly out of date, is too detailed yet too unspecific and loose, and also has formatting issues.

I suggest completely rewriting it. It is important for guiding new users to be sure to explain the difference between a `LinearCode` and a specific family subclassing `AbstractLinearCode`.

Hello,

I rewrote the module docstring of `linear_code.py`. To be more specific, I:

- completely removed the old docstring, which was, imho, focused on mathematical details and advanced specificities,
- wrote a very small definition of a linear code, 
- explained the difference between `AbstractLinearCode` and `LinearCode`, and
- gave pointers to more detailed content (thematic tutorials).

I'm setting this to `needs_review`.

David

Hi,

I've gone through the documentation and it's pretty good. I've pushed some suggested modifications to the text, in particular mentioning a few more keywords as well as emphasising the difference between generic codes and families. The latter lead to a slight restructuring of your description of `AbstractLinearCode` and `LinearCode`.

Let me know what you think, and we can co-review the ticket.

I also promoted `linear_code` in the reference manual module index, so that it figures first in its respective category. However, that lead me to thinking that perhaps some of this text should go there (not necessarily in this ticket)? What do you think -- where do people look?

Best,
Johan

I'm fine with your changes. It's indeed better to emphasise the difference between generic codes and families, as I'm not it's standard terminology so the more specific, the better.
