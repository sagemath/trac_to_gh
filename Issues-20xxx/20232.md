The module docstring of `LinearCode` is vastly out of date, is too detailed yet too unspecific and loose, and also has formatting issues.

I suggest completely rewriting it. It is important for guiding new users to be sure to explain the difference between a `LinearCode` and a specific family subclassing `AbstractLinearCode`.

Hello,

I rewrote the module docstring of `linear_code.py`. To be more specific, I:

- completely removed the old docstring, which was, imho, focused on mathematical details and advanced specificities,
- wrote a very small definition of a linear code, 
- explained the difference between `AbstractLinearCode` and `LinearCode`, and
- gave pointers to more detailed content (thematic tutorials).

I'm setting this to `needs_review`.

David

Hi,

I've gone through the documentation and it's pretty good. I've pushed some suggested modifications to the text, in particular mentioning a few more keywords as well as emphasising the difference between generic codes and families. The latter lead to a slight restructuring of your description of `AbstractLinearCode` and `LinearCode`.

Let me know what you think, and we can co-review the ticket.

I also promoted `linear_code` in the reference manual module index, so that it figures first in its respective category. However, that lead me to thinking that perhaps some of this text should go there (not necessarily in this ticket)? What do you think -- where do people look?

Best,
Johan

Hello,

I'm fine with your changes. It's indeed better to emphasise the difference between generic codes and families, as I'm not it's standard terminology so the more specific, the better. 
I also agree with the definition of encoding, dual codes, etc: these are very useful concepts which deserve to be defined here. 

> I also promoted linear_code in the reference manual module index, so that it figures first in its respective category. However, that lead me to thinking that perhaps some of this text should go there (not necessarily in this ticket)? What do you think -- where do people look?


I think we should left it as is: this file is supposed to be an index, as in any book, and when you're browsing an index, you usually expect quick access to the entry you're looking for - not some definitions. That's why I changed the name of the entry, from `Linear codes` to `Generic structures for linear codes`: with this new name, one knows exactly what to expect when one clicks on this entry.
