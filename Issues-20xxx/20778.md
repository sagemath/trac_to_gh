<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
No dashes in input description. I suggest the following:

```
        - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) if ``True`` returns ``(True, F)``,
          where ``F`` is a flat and ``self.minor(contractions=F)`` has a
          `U_{2,k}` restriction; or ``(False, None)``.
```
After that minor change, I'm happy with this ticket and will give a positive review.
