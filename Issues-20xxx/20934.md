Comment by Kevin Dilks from #20494:

"Another thing to consider would be to add functions that take an unordered chain and return the ordered list, take a multichain and return the underlying strict chain, etc."

This patch will add a `sorted` function to poset class.

> The one thing I'm going to change, however, is the example. First, it presumes that people know how to interpret a poset from a dictionary of covering relations.

This is how it is done in many examples at `posets.py`. I don't count this as a good argument.

But "natural" examples are better.

> Secondly, being a somewhat random poset requires them to keep checking back to the original data structure to confirm that the examples are doing what they should be doing. Using something like the poset of divisors of 36 would be much more transparent.

But now sorted does just what sorting plain list of integers would do. But yes, your example is better. Assuming that documentation builds and tests pass (can't check now myself), you can mark this change as positive review from my side. I guess you can review the short code I wrote.

Not bikeshedding: has someone read the code lines? Are they OK?
