Comment by Kevin Dilks from #20494:

"Another thing to consider would be to add functions that take an unordered chain and return the ordered list, take a multichain and return the underlying strict chain, etc."

This patch will add a `sorted` function to poset class.

This is how it is done in many examples at `posets.py`. I don't count this as a good argument.

But "natural" examples are better.

But now sorted does just what sorting plain list of integers would do. But yes, your example is better. Assuming that documentation builds and tests pass (can't check now myself), you can mark this change as positive review from my side. I guess you can review the short code I wrote.

Bikeshedding: do we need both complete examples? Maybe full example by Kevin with keywords, and just first part of my example, i.e. the one without additional keywords.
