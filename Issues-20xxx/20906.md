comb. free modules do not have ranks as synonym method of dimension

let us add the alias

motivation: this fails

```
sage: V3=CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ,['a','b','c'])
sage: T=End(V3)
sage: from sage.modules.matrix_morphism import MatrixMorphism
sage: MatrixMorphism(T,matrix(QQ,[[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,5]]))
```
