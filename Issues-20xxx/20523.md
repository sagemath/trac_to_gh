Usual reason...

This one is a bit more complicated than usual : the Windows toolchain has changed ; however, I do not have a Windows system to test this.

The proposed patch seems valid on Linux : it passes ptestlong with errors in two doctests :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 109.1 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 109.1 src/sage/misc/trace.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
which both pass when run standalone :

```

```

I have had this kind of hiccups since about 7.2 ; reports (on sage-release, mainly) did not alarm the release maintainers ; one of them has generated a tick.

Note that the `large_address_aware` has been lost : R 3.3.1 no longer has cygwin-specific sections in configure.ac or Makefile.in (and therefore nothing to patch) ; maybe the cygwin-relevant problems have been fixed upstream ?

I don't have a Windows machine to port Sage to ; I leave this problem to people better(?) equipped than me.

On the other hand, I found this in the current [R Installation and Administration Manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Cygwin) :

> C.8 Cygwin
> 
> The 32-bit version has never worked well enough to pass R’s make check, and residual support from
> earlier experiments was removed in R 3.3.0.
> 
> The 64-bit version is completely unsupported.

Maybe we should consider to have rather an interface to system's R and make it an optional package ?

I'll broach this subject open on sage-devel (not r-devel, as I wrote incorrectly the first time...).

From [the R 3.3.0 release notes](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html) :

>  The previously included versions of zlib, bzip2, xz and PCRE have been removed, so suitable external (usually system) versions are required (see the ‘R Installation and Administration’ manual).

So it's either :
* add xz-tools (né lzma-utils) to the list of prerequisites for Sage (i. e. relying on system's liblzma) ;
* adding xz-tools (at least the lzma library) to sage (cluttering it with yet one more library to maintain) ;
* or relying on system's R through an interface that remains to be written...

Pick your poison...

NB : I also post this on sage-devel in the recent R thread...

Okay. I just checked on my (Linux) system : xz is not installed in the $(SAGE_ROOT) tree, probably because I have it installed at system level and the build script detects that somehow. (BTW : it is an *optional* package.

Therefore, what is needed is :
a. ensure that xz *and its development files* are installed, either in the system or in the Sage package) ;
b. that this is done *before* the R installation begins ; and
c. that R installation *depends* on xz being somehow available.

This can be simplified, at the expense of making xz a *standard* package, just by ensuring that xz is installed *before* R compilation.

I have little idea on how to proceed, since the Sage build system is still a (large) bit obscure to me. What I need is a way to check in the Makefile that xz and its development files are available, install xz if not (can an optional package be installed before the compilation of standard packages is finished ?), and make the R compilation dependent on this target.

Any ideas ?

I updated the set of patches.
I also slightly modiifed the options passed to `configure` in `spkg-install`.

We still need to deal with the new dependencies.
It seemed to me that on top of `libpcre`, `R` also depends on `libcurl`...

The Cygwin patches to `main/Makefile.in` as well as  `nmath/standalone/Makefile.in`, and `etc/Makeconf.in` have effects on non-Cygwin as well.

In the first two, the folder is changed unconditionally, the third may lead to overlinking on non-Cygwin.

I also don't like removing the documentation from `SPKG.txt`; at the very least, the patch descriptions should get copied into the patches.  Renaming them IMHO isn't necessary either.

The patches have funny permissions; while you chmoded *some* a-x, the new ones again have u=rwx and go=rx.

In `spkg-install`, the lines with options to configure aren't consistently indented (in the diff at least => tabs vs. spaces used).

Well spotted, I did not pay attention on that part.

From what I saw there was underlinking in all cases, I don't see how Cygwin or non-Cygwin can change anything but I'll double check.

Anyway I'll only apply this two only coniditonally.

From what I remember there seemed to be a consensus on putting doc in patches themselves to modify a minimum set of files when adding/removing patches.
Although each patch now has some info, I'll add more from what was removed from SPKG.txt.

Windows funky choice, I'll fix it.

On top of 6.4beta6+#21622 (now necessary to build Sage on Debian), this patch passes `ptestlong` with two failures :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.2 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.2 src/sage/libs/gap/assigned_names.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Both of them pass standalone. This kind of failure is a known, iterative (and annoying) problem, probably pertaining to the test infrastructure rather than to your patch.

I am sorely tempted to set this to `positive_review`, but I think that thios must be tested by someone testing it on Cygwin, given the changes in the R toolset on Windows.

Let me know if you think this is sufficient.

I tested that R with the patches shipped here buids on Cygwin, though not from a Sage env.

IMHO this is largely sufficient as far as Cygwin is concerned.
If by any chance there are some residual side effects on Cygwin they be fixed on follow up tickets.

More of a concern is the dependency on new packages...
Can we list them here and I can try to package them:
* libpcre
* libcurl
* anything else?

Okay : `positive review`. BTW, I think that you are the main (first) author...

> More of a concern is the dependency on new packages...
> Can we list them here and I can try to package them:
> * libpcre
> * libcurl

* xz-tools.

Possible strategy :
 1) For now, list them as supplementary dependencies in the main README.TXT.

 2) Create a set of tickets to include them in Sage. These packages shuld test for existim system functionality and, if found, do nothong (how to achieve this in a Makefile ?)

 3) When those tickets are tested and positively reviewed, make them standard packages, and prerequisites for R. This pulls them off the list of prerequisites.

This way, we can buy time...

BTW : Curl and xz-tools are tools of sufficient "general" interest that we should package the whole things (i. e. binaries and docs (but maybe not test utilities ?)), not just the libraries. And add the binaries to the list of candidates for `small_scripts` making them accessible systemwide.

The good news is that R compiles against an ssl-free libcurl when configure is hacked.
And it seems that nothing that fails in the test suite is related to this lacking feature.

Not sure how it affects usability though.

Hah ! Most R repositories are switching to https:... addresses (this shown where trying to install a package without having defined a repository first : the graphical interface propose firs a list of repositories with https: addresses ; the only way to reach an http: repository is to click on the last item in that menu, which gives another list of http: repositories.

The move to such repositories parallels a similar move from various distros (starting with Debian...). I doubt that this will get reversed, and I think that, one way or another, Sage's R must keep the ability to use https:

This is true (with aggravation) of other uses of networking in applied statistics : access to remote databases is more and more frequent, and I do not see these uses accept insecure channels for a long time...

Minimal adjustments (package version + checksum) + fixed a couple of failing doctests due to R's change of representation of function source code.

These doctests might be usefully augmented by a doctest of a real R function. This doesn't seem to have ever been doctested. Advice ?

The resulting Sage (after merging with 7.5beta4) passes ptestlong with two transient failures (which pass with no errors when ran standalone).

The question of the new dependencies is still open (no answer to sage-devel's questions).

Sage-7.6.beta4 + #20523 (this patch) + #21767 + #21770 passes ptestlong witht two transient errors :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_set_morphism.py  # Bad exit: 2
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Both tests pass when run standalone.

This should close the R saga (for now) by allowing the current interfaces to work with R >= 3.3.x.

If I understand you correctly,we should either :

a. merge #21767 and #21770 into develop, **then** merge #20523 ; **OR**
b. add the contents of #21767 an #21770 into #20523

1. Is this correct ?
2. What do you recommend ?

I don't see a difference. Essentially it is as follows.

```
git checkout -b newrrr develop
git pull trac public/curl7510
git pull trac u/charpent/package_libpcre_as_a_standard_package
git pull trac public/r311
git push trac --set-upstream HEAD:public/r311
```
(not sure  if the last `push` needs `-f` or not).

It's also a question whether these 3 branches commute, so that these 3 `pull` all go through without manual intervention.

Parts ? I do not understand. Unless I'l seriously mistaken abut what git does, any modification resulting from these branches will be effected here.

Again, I do  not understand : if any part of them is defective, it should be fixed, and this fix re-merged here. What is the point ?

<Sigh> Why didn't you say so first ... </Sigh>

> (PS: While I agree with Dima that it is a very good practice to merge in your dependencies, it is not strictly necessary.)

I tried to follow the guidelines of the Developer's guide that aim to break a large issue in smaller, independent ones. Merging one ticket into another implies review of the same patches *twice*.

I didn't see Dima's point but understood the aim of consistency. Now, I am lost. Do you really want two reviews of the same code ?

I'll wait for your answer before cancelling my invalidation requests and re-adding the dependencies. After all, these tickets were ready for reviews only four and three months ago...

It won't be two reviews of the same code. Only the difference from this code and the dependencies will need to be reviewed.

I'm not sure to understand this either....

Okay. I'll reinstate dependencies, unmark my invalidation requests.

And fix a possible issue I just spotted (patches on Cygwin).

Marking this as `needs_work` for now.

This version :
* Compiles cleanly.
* passes ptestlong with :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/rigged_configurations/tensor_product_kr_tableaux_element.py  # Bad exit: 2
sage -t --long src/sage/modular/arithgroup/arithgroup_generic.py  # Bad exit: 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The first one is a well-known difference of expression of the ideal of a multivariable polynopial, already subject of a ticket.

The last two are transient errors : these tests pass when ran standalone. Race conditions ?

* Passes its own test suite.

==>`needs_review`.

ISTR that R has some Fortran libraries. What happens on Macs when clang is used ?

I think this should be fixed.

it might be problematic to use C++ libraries compiled with `gcc` with anything compiled with `clang`. While R itself does not need C++ for building, one can have an R extension that does, and this might lead to troubles...

It uses `gfortran` for Fortran, still.

From the `spkg-install` file:

```
    if [ $MACOSX_VERSION -ge 16 ]; then
        echo "OS X 10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4] Building with clang."
        CC=clang
    fi
```
This is from #21567.

From R, trivially :
* file.download("http://Url-of-soime-file-you-are-sure-in-exists", method="curl") ## libcurl
* grep("Some.*funny.*pattern", SomeCharVector, perl=TRUE) ## libpcre

This might be docscripted. Problems :

OK, I'll check this.

I don't know R, so this one look too cryptic. Could you provide a concrete example?

how about 
`http://www.sagemath.org/index.html` ?

really no idea what you mean here exactly...

Try that :

```

[1] "Uxyz"

Not really : these just test for the *presence* of the software. Downloading a *real* file, or the example I just cooked for PCRE, ensure that the software works *as expected*. Of course, I checked that these packages pass their own testsuite.

Note : I'll have to learn how to make a doctest, somewhere in the Sages's "r" documentation. Later ? Now, I'm just a bit overwhelmed (RealLife(TM) is sometimes a bitch...).

* Passes its own testsuite.
* (#21567 + #21770 + #20523 remerged with the two previous ones) passes ptestlong with two failures :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The first one is transient (passes when ran standalone) ; the second one is a well-documented, ticketed (#21884) and not yet fixed difference on the expression of the expected result.

Should I upload my local branch for #20523 (this patch) ? I think so, and will do so unless someone stops me in the next half hour...

Using `clang`, `curl` can be built with `--with-darwinssl` on OSX. This does use Apple's replacement for `openssl`. (doesn't work with gcc as it needs support for Apple's blocks extension for C). Should we do this?

By all means, yes. Updating R is a matter of some urgency...

Possible plan :
* Dima : patch libcurl (#21767) to add this switch to its `spkg-install`. Check it. Push it to trac as `needs_review`.
* Me : review it on Linux (with probably no effect at all) ==> re-mark #21767 as `positive review`
* Me also : re-merge #21767 into #20523, re-test it, push it to trac as `needs_review`
* Dima : re-test #20523 on a Mac, and possibly mark it as `poitive_review `.

What do you think ?

I think that this should be a **separate** ticket. I have reservations about trestricting the abilities of the software it includes ; in R case, the loss of secure communications would be a big loss :
* R repositories (> 10000 packages now) migrate towards https access. I doubt that they remain http-accessible for long.
* Access to Web databases (important for many applied statisticians) often requires secure communications.

So, at the minimum, let it be a choice of the user, and not something imposed. (For similar reasons, I oppose Jeroen Demerey's position, which entails a non-functional pip : too big a loss of functionality to be imposed).

And treat it as an ussue separate fron this gofddam R upgrade, which is 11 months late...

Perhaps, but that's orthogonal to this ticket. The OpenSSL dependency is not limited to OS X, so the solution to [comment:82] cannot be specific to OS X.

it is `download.file` :-)

The following works in R (run from `sage -sh` prompt) with clang-compiled curl on OSX:

```

libcurl 
   TRUE

To be fully paranoid, we should check that both downloads give the same file ;-). (I did that, but in a non-portable way).

Probably not really useful.

Let's start another ticket fo doctest it (and the PCRE test) in a future enhancement ?

A big "Thank you" to all people having helped to close this 11 months gap !

> We should still open a followup ticket to include the openssl-less patch.

Agreed. I think that running an open system which needs communication (I just don't see applied statistics without communication as very practical) without means to have *secure* communication is dangerously silly, but I also agree that there might be an use for "isolated" systems, for which communication is baggage.

But this must be an *option*, not something forced on the user by a deficient implementation.

Compiles for me with #22619 merged in. `make ptestlong` running (needs about 1 hour). Would depending on #22619 be enough for you ?

Jeroen,

Since 7.6.beta2 (IIRC), Sagemath [depends](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22189) on some SSL implementation, and we recommend OpenSSL.

BTW #20523 + #22619 passes ptestlong with the usual quirks (one transient error, one well-known, ticketed difference of expression) ; since I have OpenSSL installed systemwide, I can reach an https-accessible R repository.. Is that enough for you ? Or can you check that [your patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/f029f66bbf131eb7cdd4f8bfbe42d5c560baea1c) does what you so dearly desire ?

BTW : setting the milestone at 7.6 : this upgrade is late enough.

<a id='comment:2'></a>
the following is, most probably, an R bug:

```
[r-3.3.3.p0] making tre-match-backtrack.d from tre-match-backtrack.c
[r-3.3.3.p0] regerror.c:25:10: fatal error: 'libintl.h' file not found
[r-3.3.3.p0] #include <libintl.h>
[r-3.3.3.p0]          ^
```
which pops up if `libintl.h` is installed in `/usr/local/include/`.
Making a symbolic link to it in `SAGE_LOCAL/include` allows this to proceed.

It appears that the corresponding place in the R installation ignores CFLAGS, as
passing CFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include' on the command line has no effect.
