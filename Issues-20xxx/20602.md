As observed in the comments in #20461:

```
sage: mip = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='GLPK')
sage: mip.gen(0)           ### Names a variable, but does not create it in the backend
x_0
sage: mip.number_of_variables()
0
sage: mip[0]                  ### This now creates a variable. It prints the same as the result of gen(0), but is different.
x_0
sage: mip.get_values(mip.gen(0))
[...]
TypeError: Not a MIPVariable: x_0
sage: mip.is_real(mip.gen(0))
[...]
KeyError: x_0
sage: mip.is_real(mip[0])
True
```

To summarize, the `gen` method pretends that it can refer to backend variables (and so do `linear_function` and the special `__call__` method that is identical to `linear_function`). In reality, these methods cannot be use for anything except for what is tested in the docstring: printing some meaningless stuff. 

This patch deprecates these three methods and removes the corresponding confusing and useless examples from the class documentation.

In return, the notion of the "default MIP variable" (which `__getitem__` refers to) is explained; and it is exposed to the user by new method `default_variable`.

The patchbot report was for 7.3.b6, and there was a real issue with guava, which has since
been solved. I am launching my own bot on the ticket, but this bot has its own fake failures for the moment (solved in the next beta).
