Even after merging #20414, both `copy` and (the identical) `deepcopy` have weird semantics in relation to the `MIPVariable`s in a problems -- because a MIP does not have an API to gain access to its variables; and trying to use the old `MIPVariable`s with the copy is questionable and definitely broken if one creates new components of this variable, see #15159, #19523. Same when there's no explicit `MIPVariable` and only the `_default_mipvariable` is used via the problem's `__getitem__` method:

```
sage: sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: p[0]
x_0
sage: q = copy(p)
sage: q[0]
x_0
sage: q[1]
x_1
sage: sage: p.number_of_variables()
2
sage: sage: q.number_of_variables()
1
```

Here's a possible fix without having to change the whole design:

* a new `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.copy` method that takes a `names` keyword argument, enabling this operation:

```
sage: p.<x,y> = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: q.<newx,newy> = p.copy()
```
and the less magical syntax

```
sage: q, newx, newy = p.copy([x, y])
```
* `copy` and `__copy__` (and `__deepcopy__`) should make a copy of _default_variable (this requires writing a `__copy__` method for `MIPVariable`)
* if `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.new_variable` has been called, it should set a flag and then if `__copy__` (or `__deepcopy__`) are called, it should display a warning (deprecation??) and refer the user to the new `copy` method.

In this ticket, we take care of the default MIP variable.
#20657 will take care of the variables created with `new_variable`.

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
sage: x[0]
x_0
sage: x[1]
x_1
sage: p[0] #I don't understand this
x_2
sage: p[1]
x_3
```
But if we actually use the "generator" interface things seem OK:

```
sage: [p.gen(i) for i in [0..3]]
[x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3]
```
so I would suggest to just make sure that `p.gen(...)` works properly and indeed gives a variable of the appropriate MIP object. Then there IS an interface to get access to its variables (and really, it seems to be largely in place already) and then simply that can be used.

It looks like a variable on p is uniquely determined by its index (certainly its print name is), and `p.new_variable` seems just a funny way of obtaining such indices.

The rest of the variable data is all hanging off internal tables, and via the "is_variable_*" methods you can obtain the type of the variables.

I think you first need to make sure that all of that is accessible (and copied appropriately, but I guess that's taken care of now) and then you can think about what to do with this "new_variable" business.
