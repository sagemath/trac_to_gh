Also note one would have to have a clean binary-pkg and use file:// syntax or whatever git uses to find a local repo.

The createDSStore I wrote is pure python and should be self-contained without any other dependencies than the system's python.
What does "python --version" report on your 10.7 system, Karl?

From comment 3, I gather we close this ticket with my change which makes building under 10.7 with binary_pkg possible again - even though the icons won't be arranged and have a background image for .app.dmg built under 10.7.
