By implementing a non-recursive iterator, we avoid some overhead. With this branch, we get the following:

```
sage: I = IntegerVectors(12,7)
sage: %timeit list(I.__iter__())
10 loops, best of 3: 20.8 ms per loop
sage: I = WeightedIntegerVectors(12, [4,1,2,2])
sage: %timeit list(I.__iter__())
1000 loops, best of 3: 291 µs per loop
sage: I = WeightedIntegerVectors(12, [2,1,1,2])
sage: %timeit list(I.__iter__())
1000 loops, best of 3: 556 µs per loop
sage: I = WeightedIntegerVectors(17, [2,1,1,2,1,1,2])
sage: %timeit list(I.__iter__())
10 loops, best of 3: 56.4 ms per loop
sage: I = WeightedIntegerVectors(26, [2,1,1,2,1,1,2])
sage: %timeit list(I.__iter__())
1 loop, best of 3: 443 ms per loop
```
versus the current version:

```
sage: I = IntegerVectors(12,7)
sage: %timeit list(I.__iter__())
10 loops, best of 3: 50.3 ms per loop
sage: %timeit list(I.__iter__())
The slowest run took 8.13 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000 loops, best of 3: 301 µs per loop
sage: I = WeightedIntegerVectors(12, [2,1,1,2])
sage: %timeit list(I.__iter__())
1000 loops, best of 3: 554 µs per loop
sage: I = WeightedIntegerVectors(17, [2,1,1,2,1,1,2])
sage: %timeit list(I.__iter__())
10 loops, best of 3: 68.1 ms per loop
sage: I = WeightedIntegerVectors(26, [2,1,1,2,1,1,2])
sage: %timeit list(I.__iter__())
1 loop , best of 3: 528 ms per loop
```

Up to twice faster than your version ;-)

- it is always a bad idea to use `list.insert(0, XX)` and `list.pop(0)`. Lists are implemented as C arrays, and modifications at the bottom is `O(n)`. Whereas `list.append()` and `list.pop()` are always `O(1)` (if we ignore memory allocation).

- it is always good to avoid coercion `int / ZZ`.

It is good to go for me

I think this causes the problem at #20491.
