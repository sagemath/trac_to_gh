<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
* You must not recreate the parent (by `K = Qp(p,prec)`) but instead write `K = self.parent().fraction_field()` (in order to keep the same modes)
* You should compute once for all `K(self)` and give a name to it
* Why are you using the name `_polylog_c` whereas your function is not written in C
* Is that really useful to have three external functions (namely `_polylog_c`, `_findprec` and `_compute_g`); cannot we instead include them directly in the method `polylog`
* Instead of

```
        for x in K.teichmuller_system():
            if (self - x).valuation() > 0:
                zeta = x
``` 
you probably should write `zeta = K.teichmuller(x)`.

Thanks for all the comments caruso, I have made many of the changes you suggested, we discussed this offline but for completeness of the ticket:

Regarding the module functions, they are used in two of the public methods, so they cannot really be moved/removed, and the function _c is so named to be consistent with the paper of Besser-de Jeu I've tried to make that clearer in the docstring.
The way precision works has been made much better, the user no longer specifies a precision instead the best possible is chosen and it is up to the user to change their element to lower precision first if they want quicker evaluation.

This doesn't currently merge.

I won't be able to look at this over the weekend, but I'll be at Sage Days 88 next week and should have a chance then.

Sorry, I have another change.  Everywhere the citation [DCW2016] is referenced, the 2015 needs to be changed to 2016.  In particular:

`2016.17 (2015): 5291-5354.`

should be

`2016.17 (2016): 5291-5354.`

This occurs in two places.
