<a id='comment:4'></a>I am not sure it is a good idea. If the original link was created with a pd code or gauss code, the computed braid might need more crossings than the original link. If we compute the new link from the braid, we might be unnecesarily increasing the number of crossings. Consider, for instance the monster unknot:

```
sage: L = Link([[3,1,2,4], [8,9,1,7], [5,6,7,3], [4,18,6,5], 
....: [17,19,8,18], [9,10,11,14], [10,12,13,11],
....: [12,19,15,13], [20,16,14,15], [16,20,17,2]])
sage: L
Link with 1 component represented by 10 crossings
sage: L.braid()
s0*s1^-1*s2^-1*s3^-1*s2*s1^-1*s0^-1*s1*s2^2*s1^-1*s3*s2*s1^-3
sage: len(L.braid().Tietze())
16
```

If we construct the mirror image from the braid, we sill loose the posibility of computing some invariants using the simpler representation with 10 crossings (instead of 16).

If we use the pd_code to compute the mirror image, we are safe on that size: the resulting link will have exactly the same internal representation as the original one.
