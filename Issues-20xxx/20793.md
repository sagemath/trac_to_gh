```
sage: N = Newforms(83,2, names="a")
sage: f = N[1]
sage: K = f.hecke_eigenvalue_field()
sage: print K
Number Field in a1 with defining polynomial x^6 - x^5 - 9*x^4 + 7*x^3 + 20*x^2 - 12*x - 8
sage: l = f.coefficients(20)
sage: print l[-1].parent()
Number Field in alpha with defining polynomial x^6 - x^5 - 9*x^4 + 7*x^3 + 20*x^2 - 12*x - 8
sage: K(l[-1])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: No compatible natural embeddings found for Number Field in a1 with defining polynomial x^6 - x^5 - 9*x^4 + 7*x^3 + 20*x^2 - 12*x - 8 and Number Field in alpha with defining polynomial x^6 - x^5 - 9*x^4 + 7*x^3 + 20*x^2 - 12*x - 8
```
This can be fixed by returning the coefficients as number field elements in the variable name of the Hecke eigenvalue field instead of `alpha`.

My local sage does not build right now so I could not test this. Feel free to set it to positive review yourself once the patchbot tested it or if you have run all tests yourself.
