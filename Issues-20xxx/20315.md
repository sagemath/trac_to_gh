The presence of the solver `CPLEX` breaks plotting of knots and links: see [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/ryq2Pmn_lRY/a3twFJNUDwAJ).

Minimal example

```
sage: L = Link([[2,1,4,5], [5,6,7,3], [6,4,1,9], [9,2,3,7]])
sage: L.plot()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
MIPSolverException: 'CPLEX: The primal has no feasible solution' 
```
The reason is that the code in `Link.plot` assumes that the optimization is over integer valued variables which is not the case by default.

We also simplify and optimize the usage of the MILP solver.
