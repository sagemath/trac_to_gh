Rename `AsymptoticRing.singularity_analysis` to `AsymptoticRing.coefficients_of_generating_function` in order to describe what the method does instead of how it does it.

Furthermore, in #20053, we will introduce a method `AsymptoticExpansion.singularity_analysis` and it seems to be better to have different names for related, but not identical functionalities.
