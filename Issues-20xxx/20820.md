<a id='comment:12'></a>Functionality checkouts.

A few more minor things:

- Implement has an 'e' not an 'i'


- automorphism group example calls conjugating_set

```
sage: f = H([x**2 + x*z, y**2, z**2])
sage: f.conjugating_set(f) # long test
```


- needs a space before it, or the link doesn't format

```
[FMV]_
```

- is_conjugate()

2nd example does not format correctly, need blank line after ::
