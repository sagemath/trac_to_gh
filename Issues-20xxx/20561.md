Given an element of a permutation group, which automatically comes equipped with a fixed embedding into a symmetric group, return the cycle type of the permutation as a partition.

```python
sage: G=DihedralGroup(3)
sage: [g.cycle_type() for g in G]
[[1, 1, 1], [2, 1], [3], [2, 1], [3], [2, 1]]
sage: PermutationGroupElement('(1,2,3)(4,5)(6,7,8)').cycle_type()
[3, 3, 2]
sage: G=SymmetricGroup(3); G('(1,2)').cycle_type()
[2, 1]
sage: G=SymmetricGroup(4); G('(1,2)').cycle_type()
[2, 1, 1]
```

**Keywords:** permutation, cycle type

Hello,

You would better use the option `reverse` of `sort` rather than sorting and inversing.

On the other hand, constructing the actual cycle tuples to count their length is not optimal... I would rather implement it from scratch.

Sided remark: returning a Partition is very costly. Most of the time will be spent in the actual construction of the Partition from the given list.

I have addressed both of these points: the `reverse=True` is now used and a list is returned.

> On the other hand, constructing the actual cycle tuples to count their length is not optimal... I would rather implement it from scratch.

I have not changed this as this seems to be unnecessary code duplication. I have not delved into the cycle code deeply but it seems to me that to extract this information you would essentially rewrite much of the cython code in `cycle_tuples`.

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'></a>\nConsidering that Sage's permutations return a `Partition`, I think this should also return a `Partition` for consistency. If that extra overhead of constructing a `Partition` is that great, then the act of sorting should be a significant burden as well (which is `O(n log n)` as opposed to `O(n)`).\n\nYou can also get ~10% speedup by using `_Partitions(data)` instead of `Partition(data)`.",

Considering that Sage's permutations return a `Partition`, I think this should also return a `Partition` for consistency. If that extra overhead of constructing a `Partition` is that great, then the act of sorting should be a significant burden as well (which is `O(n log n)` as opposed to `O(n)`).

You can also get ~10% speedup by using `_Partitions(data)` instead of `Partition(data)`.

You should fix the `OUTPUT` section.

Creating a partition from a tuple is trivial at no extra cost: just do `Partition(l)`. On the other hand, creating a list from a partition is: `list(p)` and this costs a >80% slow down.

It makes sense in a lot of situations. Especially when you count solutions of equations in the symmetric group. Getting the conjugacy is not the only important thing.

> Side note: if you really care about speed, you should use `list.sort(reverse=True)` because it does it in place and does not create a second list.

This is precisely what is done in Andrew's code and that I asked for in [comment:5].

    "body": "<a id='comment:16'></a>\nI am amused how much bandwidth such a trivial ticket can generate:)\n\nI agree with Vincent that allowing singletons to be ignored will probably be useful, is more consistent with the other `cycle_*` methods and that it is trivial to implement. For all of these reasons, it should be implemented so I have added an optional `singletons` argument for this.\n\nI also agree with Travis that the casual user will expect that `cycle_type` will return a partition so I have made this the default, using `_Partitions` as Travis recommends. The non-casual user may well not want a partition so I have added a second optional argument `as_list` that , when `True`, will cause a list to be returned.\n\nHere are some new timings with these changes:\n\n```python\nsage: S = SymmetricGroup(100)\nsage: p = S.random_element()\nsage:  %timeit c = p.cycle_type()\n10000 loops, best of 3: 47.5 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit c = p.cycle_type(singletons=True)\n10000 loops, best of 3: 50.2 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit c = p.cycle_type(as_list=True)\n100000 loops, best of 3: 11.9 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit c = p.cycle_type(singletons=True, as_list=True)\n100000 loops, best of 3: 11.6 \u00b5s per loop\nsage: %timeit c = p.cycle_tuples()\n100000 loops, best of 3: 9.83 \u00b5s per loop\n```\n\nSo it seems that returning a partition is relatively costly but I think that it is more user friendly so should be the default.

I am amused how much bandwidth such a trivial ticket can generate:)

I agree with Vincent that allowing singletons to be ignored will probably be useful, is more consistent with the other `cycle_*` methods and that it is trivial to implement. For all of these reasons, it should be implemented so I have added an optional `singletons` argument for this.

I also agree with Travis that the casual user will expect that `cycle_type` will return a partition so I have made this the default, using `_Partitions` as Travis recommends. The non-casual user may well not want a partition so I have added a second optional argument `as_list` that , when `True`, will cause a list to be returned.

Here are some new timings with these changes:

```python
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(100)
sage: p = S.random_element()
sage:  %timeit c = p.cycle_type()
10000 loops, best of 3: 47.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c = p.cycle_type(singletons=True)
10000 loops, best of 3: 50.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c = p.cycle_type(as_list=True)
100000 loops, best of 3: 11.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c = p.cycle_type(singletons=True, as_list=True)
100000 loops, best of 3: 11.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c = p.cycle_tuples()
100000 loops, best of 3: 9.83 µs per loop
```

So it seems that returning a partition is relatively costly but I think that it is more user friendly so should be the default. I have added a remark in the documentation that `as_list=True` should be used when speed is an issue.

I am okay with it. Vincent (to whom, thank you for your input)?

From this, I figure it is about time that we rework `Partition` a bit so that has faster initialization.
