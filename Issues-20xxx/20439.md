Keywords: sd90

Here is the example reported at http://ask.sagemath.org/question/33084/bug-in-eigenmatrix-command/

```
sage: A = matrix(CDF, [[-2.53634347567,  2.04801738686, -0.0, -62.166145304], [ 0.7, -0.6, 0.0, 0.0], [0.547271128842, 0.0, -0.3015, -21.7532081652], [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, -0.4]])
sage: D, P = A.eigenmatrix_right()
```

According to the documentation, `D,P` should satisfy `A*P == P*D`, however:

```
sage: (A*P - P*D).norm()
7.454841195108627
```

The conjugate of `P` seems to be the correct answer though:

```
sage: P  = P.conjugate()
sage: (A*P - P*D).norm()
6.716506829378007e-15
```

The same issue holds for `eigenmatrix_left`

```
sage: sage: D, P = A.eigenmatrix_left()
sage: (P*A - D*P).norm()
8.009616737465649
sage: P = P.conjugate()
sage: (P*A - D*P).norm()
8.481237941055673e-15
```

It appears that both `eigenmatrix_right` and `eigenmatrix_left` are computed using `eigenvectors_left`, which for `CDF` is implemented in `sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.py`. That in turn is calling `scipy.linalg.eig`, whose documentation

https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.eig.html

states that indeed for left eigenvectors, the reported "eigenvectors" are actually the conjugates thereof.

So I would propose changing `eigenvectors_left` to account for this.

All tests passed on k8s, so it looks like there were no unexpected side effects. (This is a bit surprising to me, but never mind.) I do have some comments on the doctests, though.

It is a [Sage coding convention](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html) that lines should be no longer than 79 characters; anything longer should be split into multiple lines. In `matrix2.pyx`, the new doctest in `eigenmatrix_left` has a line that violates this convention.

The new doctests should reference this ticket. Sample text to illustrate the formatting:

```
    This test shows that :trac:`20439` has been resolved::
    ...
```
I would add a new doctest to `left_eigenvectors` where the substantive change was made, showing the effect of the change and again referencing this ticket. Repurposing the example from the top of the ticket would suffice.

```
        sage: A = matrix(CDF, [[-2.53634347567, 2.04801738686, -0.0, -62.166145304],

        ....:                  [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, -0.4]])

In some cases, you might have to go over 79 char/line for readability, but we try to stick to that limit as much as possible.

`@`kedlaya, you should add yourself to the reviewers list too.

I also have a few additional suggestions for the doctests:

```diff
-            sage: for i in range(A.dimensions()[0]):
-            ....:     ((A - spectrum[i][0]*identity_matrix(A.dimensions()[0]))*Matrix(spectrum[i][1]).transpose()).norm()<10^(-2)
+            sage: all(((A - spectrum[i][0]) * Matrix(spectrum[i][1]).transpose()).norm() < 10^(-2)
+            ....:     for i in range(A.nrows())
```
In fact, all of those `<` should have a space around them by PEP8 (it also is much easier to read quickly).

Two more spaces after the `....:` in these:

```
            sage: for i in range(len(spectrum)):
            ....:   spectrum[i][1][0]=matrix(CDF, spectrum[i][1]).echelon_form()[0]

You missed a few:

```diff
-(P*A - D*P).norm()<10^(-2)
+(P*A - D*P).norm() < 10^(-2)

Once that is done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
