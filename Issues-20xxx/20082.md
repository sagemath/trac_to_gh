```
sage: zeta(x).series(x==pi)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: stub
```

Fixing this will also fix the computations of residues like

```
sage: (zeta(x) * 1/(1 - exp(-x))).residue(x==2*pi*I)
```

Also see [the corresponding pynac issue](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/128).

Depends on #20085
