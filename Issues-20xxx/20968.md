Adding a construction by J.Wallis and A.L.Whiteman (1972).
This gives in particular RSHCD(676,1) and RSHCD(900,1), 
and corresponding strongly regular graphs.

To get the squares in a finite field, there is better than

```
Q = filter(lambda a: a.is_square() and a.is_unit(), F)
```
Since you are using containment test later on I would even do

```
Q = set(a**2 for a in F)
Q.remove(F.zero())
```

For `szekeres_difference_set_pair`, it would be better to have the same variable name in the documentation description and in the function (currently `G` and `Q`).

Could you remove the trailing whitespaces in the whole file?

For the ` szekeres_difference_set_pair` and `typeI_matrix_difference_set`, why not put it somewhere in `sage.combinat.designs.difference_family`?

You should add an example in `regular_symmetric_hadamard_matrix_with_constant_diagonal` where your new construction is actually used.

yes, I'll do all of the above. I can do even better, as I know a generator for the multiplicative group of the field, thus I can list the squares explicitly
without repetition...

`szekeres_difference_set_pair` does not return a group, it merely returns a list of group elements; in this form I don't think it should go there. In fact I do not know how to create, in Sage, a subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field in a natural way. Indeed:

```
sage: F=GF(27)
sage: t=F.multiplicative_generator()
sage: G=GL(1,F)
sage: t in G
True
sage: G.subgroup([t^2])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-58-d1ce805e8ed8> in <module>()
----> 1 G.subgroup([t**Integer(2)])
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.finite_rings.element_givaro.FiniteField_givaroElement' object has no attribute 'gap'
```
The problem here is that matrix groups in Sage are done via (lib)GAP, but 
this is not compatible with the default way of creating GF in Sage. 
I don't see how to overcome this easily - would you mind if I keep it the way it is?

> You should add an example in `regular_symmetric_hadamard_matrix_with_constant_diagonal` where your new construction is actually used.

right.

For all the squaring buisness it is much faster to use the **methods** of Sage integers rather than the generic functions `is_square` and `sqrt`

```
sage: %timeit is_square(n)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 698 ns per loop
sage: %timeit n.is_square()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 139 ns per loop
sage: %timeit sqrt(n)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 860 ns per loop
sage: %timeit n.sqrtrem()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 172 ns per loop
```
(though it does not import much since the time is not spent here anyway)

```
try:

except ValueError:
    raise

and not simply

These sets are not difference sets in the [classical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_set). Indeed, 

```
sage: szekeres_difference_set_pair(2)
([1, 3, 4, 5, 9], [4, 5], [3, 4])
```
That is you have v=5, k=2, and the standard equation k<sup>2</sup>-k=(v-1)l on the parameters (v,k,l) of a difference set implies l=1/2, which just cannot happen.

What we have here is a difference family, with s=2, so you have s(k<sup>2</sup>-k)=(v-1)l, ie
[the parameters of the family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_set#Generalisations) are (v,k,l,s)=(2m+1,m,1,2). Note that in `designs.difference_family` the parameter s is not explicit (but can be computed as (v-1)l/(k<sup>2</sup>-k)).
