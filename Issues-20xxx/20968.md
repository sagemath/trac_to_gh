Adding a construction by J.Wallis and A.L.Whiteman (1972).
This gives in particular RSHCD(676,1) and RSHCD(900,1), 
and corresponding strongly regular graphs.

<a id='comment:4'></a>To get the squares in a finite field, there is better than

```
Q = filter(lambda a: a.is_square() and a.is_unit(), F)
```
Since you are using containment test later on I would even do

```
Q = set(a**2 for a in F)
Q.remove(F.zero())
```

For `szekeres_difference_set_pair`, it would be better to have the same variable name in the documentation description and in the function (currently `G` and `Q`).

Could you remove the trailing whitespaces in the whole file?

For the ` szekeres_difference_set_pair` and `typeI_matrix_difference_set`, why not put it somewhere in `sage.combinat.designs.difference_family`?

You should add an example in `regular_symmetric_hadamard_matrix_with_constant_diagonal` where your new construction is actually used.

yes, I'll do all of the above. I can do even better, as I know a generator for the multiplicative group of the field, thus I can list the squares explicitly
without repetition...

`szekeres_difference_set_pair` does not return a group, it merely returns a list of group elements; in this form I don't think it should go there. In fact I do not know how to create, in Sage, a subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field in a natural way. Indeed:

```
sage: F=GF(27)
sage: t=F.multiplicative_generator()
sage: G=GL(1,F)
sage: t in G
True
sage: G.subgroup([t^2])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-58-d1ce805e8ed8> in <module>()
----> 1 G.subgroup([t**Integer(2)])
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.finite_rings.element_givaro.FiniteField_givaroElement' object has no attribute 'gap'
```
The problem here is that matrix groups in Sage are done via (lib)GAP, but 
this is not compatible with the default way of creating GF in Sage. 
I don't see how to overcome this easily - would you mind if I keep it the way it is?

it is actually even more than that; A has to be skew-symmetric and B has to be 
symmetric (in terms of their  "typeI matrices"). But this, as well as the above, is
tested indirectly, by building the corresponding Hadamard matrix.

These sets are not difference sets in the [classical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_set). Indeed, 

```
sage: szekeres_difference_set_pair(2)
([1, 3, 4, 5, 9], [4, 5], [3, 4])
```
That is you have v=5, k=2, and the standard equation k<sup>2</sup>-k=(v-1)l on the parameters (v,k,l) of a difference set implies l=1/2, which just cannot happen.

What we have here is a difference family, with s=2, so you have s(k<sup>2</sup>-k)=(v-1)l, ie
[the parameters of the family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_set#Generalisations) are (v,k,l,s)=(2m+1,m,1,2). Note that in `designs.difference_family` the parameter s is not explicit (but can be computed as (v-1)l/(k<sup>2</sup>-k)).
