Yes, I think so. this seems to be triggered ~~by the change in structure/test_factory.py~~.
I was not expecting that, but as this was something I wanted to do anyway, I am happy
to do it here.

**EDIT**: I do not understand by what change this is triggered. Maybe one in misc ?

1) I have not tested the new behaviour by adding a fake file with a bad print
2) one should also check that the print behaviour in console and notebooks is still py2
3) maybe this should be discussed on sage-devel, though this is not a major change really
4) maybe this can/should be split in another ticket ?

This is the **keystone** of all my previous changes in the doc, that prevents any regression.

I have checked that the behaviour of print is unchanged in console and both notebooks.

I still do not understand why this desirable behaviour happens.

In general, we can write 2/3 compatible docstrings, but we cannot strictly enforce it. I am in favor of enforcing the Python3 syntax, but it does create a discrepancy (at least if we add a strictly Python3 print statement). If there are no objections on sage-devel, then I am content with putting this to a positive review.

<a id='comment:19'></a>I do not think that it comes from the changes in misc/dev_tools.py

I have really tried to see where the change of behaviour came from, with no success so far.

I would now prefer this ticket not to make this change of behaviour, but for this I need to understand what has to be undone, and I have not clue.

No idea what happens exactly, but undoing this change gives us back the usual behaviour.

So this is back to being a very simple print ticket, one of the last ones for py files.
