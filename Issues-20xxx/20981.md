This small patch fixes some problems I was having doing a debug build of Sage on Cygwin (`SAGE_DEBUG=yes`).  I didn't have the same problem on Windows.

I actually made this patch a few weeks ago and don't remember all the details of why this was needed.  No symbols from `gmp` are used explicitly in those modules, but *are* brought in via `ntl`.  Normally these unused symbols would be optimized out at link time, but with `-O0` they are not.  There are also some Windows-specific details of the linker that I forget that were specifically responsible for this failing on Windows, while it still worked on Linux.

That said, it should be harmless to add this change in general.
