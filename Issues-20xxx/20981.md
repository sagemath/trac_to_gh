This small patch fixes some problems I was having doing a debug build of Sage on Cygwin (`SAGE_DEBUG=yes`).  I didn't have the same problem on Windows.

I actually made this patch a few weeks ago and don't remember all the details of why this was needed.  No symbols from `gmp` are used explicitly in those modules, but *are* brought in via `ntl`.  Normally these unused symbols would be optimized out at link time, but with `-O0` they are not.  There are also some Windows-specific details of the linker that I forget that were specifically responsible for this failing on Windows, while it still worked on Linux.

That said, it should be harmless to add this change in general.

It seems actually the last change from this ticket that has not been applied (other than the explanatory comment, though it's not essential) is not needed after all.  I've been building with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` for a while and haven't needed to link these extra libraries.

Will reopen if somehow it crops up again.
