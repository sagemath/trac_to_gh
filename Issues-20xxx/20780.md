I think this looks good. The code makes sense and appears to work as intended. I just found some really minor things:

-algebraic_scheme.py
- line 2780 - change TypeError message to all lowercase
- Old issues present before this ticket that maybe could be addressed here:
- line 2680 - ``False`` to ```False```
- line 2711 - some spacing in ProjectiveSpace calls and in lists of defining polynomials

-projective_homset.py
- line 182 - the sorted() function takes any iterable and returns a list, so it shouldn't be necessary to convert rat_points to a list first

-projective_morphism.py
- line 3920 spacing around '>'
- lines 3790 - 3793, formatting issues: ```k``th` and ``k`th` don't seem to render well, and perhaps
  ``P`` and ``Q`` should be replaced with ```P```, ```Q```.
- some ProjectiveSpace calls in examples of rational_preimages don't have any spacing in the arguments
