When working with preimage trees it is usefull to compute more than just the first preimages of a given point. The ticket is to add a parameter to rational_preimages() to specify how far back to find preimages.  I.e. find all points Q with `f^k(Q) =P` for specified `k`.

I think this looks good. The code makes sense and appears to work as intended. I just found some really minor things:

-algebraic_scheme.py
- line 2780 - change TypeError message to all lowercase
- Old issues present before this ticket that maybe could be addressed here:
- line 2680 - <code>\`False\`</code> to <code>\`\`False\`\`</code>
- line 2711 - some spacing in ProjectiveSpace calls and in lists of defining polynomials

-projective_homset.py
- line 182 - the sorted() function takes any iterable and returns a list, so it shouldn't be necessary to convert rat_points to a list first

-projective_morphism.py
- line 3920 spacing around '>'
- lines 3790 - 3793, formatting issues: <code>\`\`k\`\`th</code> and <code>\`k\`th</code> don't seem to render well, and perhaps
  <code>\`P\`</code> and <code>\`Q\`</code> should be replaced with <code>\`\`P\`\`</code>, <code>\`\`Q\`\`</code>.
- some ProjectiveSpace calls in examples of rational_preimages don't have any spacing in the arguments
