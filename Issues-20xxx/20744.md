```
The following:

```
sage: F = GF(11)
sage: Fy.<y> = F[]
sage: n, k = 10 , 5
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(F.list()[:n], k)
sage: E = C.encoder("EvaluationPolynomial")
sage: p = y^2 + 3*y + 10
sage: c = E.encode(p);

<BOOM>
```

fails because the polynomial to encode has to be in `'x'` with the actual implementation.

This ticket fixes it, by allowing the user to specify a variable name when creating the encoder.

I did what we talked about, and added related input checks and `TESTS` block.
This method `polynomial_ring` feels like code duplication with `message_space`, but it makes sense to provide it, so even if it's not über-clean, I can live with that.

Cool. You also need a check that `polynomial_ring.base_ring()` is the field of the code.

> This method `polynomial_ring` feels like code duplication with `message_space`, but it makes sense to provide it, so even if it's not über-clean, I can live with that.

Yes, that's why I suggested making it an "alias of `message_space`". But now you've made a full function anyway. However, can you add in the doc-string that this is the same as the message space?

Done.

I also removed `polynomial_ring` as a full function and made it an alias of `message_space` as you suggested. 
I think it's indeed better.

I updated this ticket to latest beta, and fixed a bug (`polynomial_ring.base_field()` was used instead of `polynomial_ring.base_ring()`).

This is still open for review.

Hi David

This new feature is not examplified when typing `codes.encoders.GRSEvaluationPolynomialEncoder?`


I suggest there should be an example with 'y' or 'my_variable' in the EXAMPLE section of the docstring. 

That could be quickly done by migrating part of the existing code in the TEST section to the EXAMPLE section.

Daniel

Hi,

I merged to the latest beta (7.4.beta3) and made the fix according to Daniel's comment. I also approve the changes.

Need someone for a definitive review (I guess).
