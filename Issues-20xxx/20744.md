```
The following:

```
sage: F = GF(11)
sage: Fy.<y> = F[]
sage: n, k = 10 , 5
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(F.list()[:n], k)
sage: E = C.encoder("EvaluationPolynomial")
sage: p = y^2 + 3*y + 10
sage: c = E.encode(p);

<BOOM>
```

fails because the polynomial to encode has to be in `'x'` with the actual implementation.

This ticket fixes it, by allowing the user to specify a variable name when creating the encoder.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Hi David

This new feature is not examplified when typing `codes.encoders.GRSEvaluationPolynomialEncoder?`


I suggest there should be an example with 'y' or 'my_variable' in the EXAMPLE section of the docstring. 

That could be quickly done by migrating part of the existing code in the TEST section to the EXAMPLE section.
