This patch will add a function to generate a random lattice with given number of elements.

Currently only "dismantlable" and "planar" are implemented as a property. Is this a good desing from user perspective? I hope to later add for example "modular", but of course most combinations will always just raise NotImplemented, as there are at least dozens of meaningful combinations that should be coded one by one.

I am not satisfied of this code, but at least it works and is quite fast.

The code must be something like

```
props = ['dismantlable', 'modular', 'planar' . . .]
for p in properties:
    if p not in props:
        Raise ValueError(...)
```

But the most important question is the "interface", that is hard to change later. What kind of parameters would be possible to have for different kind of lattices? What if type `x` lattices can have five different numerical parameters to choise from, and type `y` has two?

Or maybe I am planning too much for a code not yet written.

Actually it kind of works now, but generates a random semilattice with minimal number of covers, i.e. a tree, and then adds the top element. Would be strange if `p=0` would always give the chain and `p=0.001` would give a tree (+top).

> Is this model of random lattices known (i.e., is there a literature reference for it)?


I found only https://www.emis.de/journals/MB/125.2/mb125_2_1.pdf and the code in that paper is... Well, take a look at yourself.

I don't know if there is even a theoretical results about "random lattice", like "What is the average width of all non-isomorphic lattices on 100 elements?" So is there anything to compare to be able to say how good or bad an algorithm is?

You can also do something like this:

```python
if not set('dismantlable', 'modular', 'planar', ...).is_superset(properties):
    raise ValueError("invalid property")
```

> But the most important question is the "interface", that is hard to change later. What kind of parameters would be possible to have for different kind of lattices? What if type `x` lattices can have five different numerical parameters to choise from, and type `y` has two?


We can easily add parameters and moderately easily change to an `*args` attribute if necessary.

The minimal number of covers has to be a chain, because a tree + top will have E+k covers, where k is the number leaves that is not the root and `E` is the number of edges of the tree. 2 leaves with one being the root minimizes `k`, which implies the tree must be a path/chain. So it is not strange to me because boundary points (at least for Gnp random graphs) can behave different.

Well, if its not known, it might result in a paper if you can determine some theoretical results. I was asking more if there was a reference that could be added.

But then we can not raise exception saying *what* property was invalid.

True. We could add something like `extra` parameter if needed for some special type of lattices.

Yes for lattices. Not for semilattices.

But after all, I don't know if we really have to think about semilattices. I did the code such way that internal function generates a semilattice, which can be used directly as a meet-semilattice, inversed as a join-semilattice or after adding one element as a lattice.

True. The paper http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/papers/posets.pdf actually refers to a result about posets: "Our results do not show this behaviour, emphasizing again that the convergence of posets to their asymptotic behaviour is quite slow."

But at least the average number of atoms equals to number of coatoms. My ad hoc code does not achieve this. I used `sqrt(random())` as a slight help to this direction.

I tested that my code generates all lattices of given (small) size eventually, and it should be theoretically clear too.

OK, done that, even if this should not be an issue: I suppose we wont have *that* many properties ever available.

Now if someone says `Posets.RandomLattice(30, 0, properties='dismantlable')` it will also work, and not raise an error about parameter value 'd'. (See `set('hello')`.)

I also rethinked something, but the algorithms themself have not changed. I added tests and docstrings.

Maybe a time to close this and do other additions later. Will be a nice challenge, I guess, to make for example a random lattice that is both atomic and co-atomic.
