A minor enhancement to `sage-logger` that I've found incredibly helpful.  Every line output to stdout is prefixed with the name(s) of the log file(s) they are being logged to.

In particular this helps sort out stdout when there are large number of make processes running in parallel.  It helps to reason about what lines of output are associated with which packages.  I know each package build is logged individually as well, but this still helps understand what's going on at a glance.  It also helps quickly determine which log file to look at if I see something scroll past that I want to investigate further.
