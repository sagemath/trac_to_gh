In Sage 7.2 the following important deprecation warning is displayed:

```
sage: function('f',x)
/Users/Masson/Downloads/GitHub/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:2885: DeprecationWarning: Calling function('f',x) is deprecated. Use function('f')(x) instead.
See http://trac.sagemath.org/17447 for details.
  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
f(x)
```

As of at least 7.3.beta4 the warning is no longer there. The likely cause is #20667. Other missing warnings were reported in sage-devel:
