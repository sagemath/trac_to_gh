Currently, the divisibility test for multivariate polynomials (using libSingular) is the generic one implemented in `src/sage/structure/element.pyx` and uses a test of the form `other%self == 0`. This can be fastened a lot using libSingular's `kNF` function, with the "laziness" attribute. Below is an example of timings, with the new code:

```python
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: p = R.random_element(20, terms=30)
sage: q = prod(R.random_element(20, terms=30) for _ in range(5))
sage: r = p*q
sage: %time p.divides(r)
CPU times: user 1.26 s, sys: 23.7 ms, total: 1.29 s

sage: %time r%p == 0
CPU times: user 8min 41s, sys: 68 ms, total: 8min 41s
Wall time: 8min 41s
