This ticket provides a first toy implementation of the Matrix-F5 algorithm to compute Gröbner bases.

Many variants of this algorithm are available:
* The classical one (see https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00974810).
* An adaptation for more stable computation of p-adic Gröbner bases (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5464).
* Various adaptations to the computation of tropical Gröbner bases (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6675).

Doctests are provided.

To implement the algorithms, we define a class of Macaulay matrices with extra information (signatures, labels, etc...).

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello, and welcome !

Could you provide a git branch for your code ? some intructions are here: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/manual_git.html

About the documentation: you need to indent the examples as follows:

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: 1+1 == 2
    True
```
with 4 spaces.

And also both INPUT: and OUTPUT: must be followed by a blank line.
