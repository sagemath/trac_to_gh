I fixed the bug reported in the ticket. I have tested that it works for Gamma0, Gamma_1, and Gamma for levels up to 20, as well as for the group reported above. Below is the code that I used:

```
for N in range(1,20):
    print 'N = %s'%N
    for G in [Gamma0, Gamma1, Gamma]:
        GN = G(N)
        F = GN.farey_symbol()
        gens = F.generators()
        ngens = len(gens)
        for i in range(200):
            V = [ZZ.random_element(ngens) for _ in range(100)]
            g = prod([gens[V[i]] for i in range(len(V))])
            wd = F.word_problem(g, output = 'syllables')
            g1 = prod([gens[i].matrix()**a for i,a in wd])
            if  g.matrix() !=g1:
                print GN, V, g,g1
                assert 0
```

The reason for the bug was again in some discrepancies in sign that I was ignoring. I try hard to avoid doing the naive trick of keeping track of the matrix that the computed word represents (although this is precisely what the check=True flag does, which is enabled by default) and fixing the sign at the end.

Thanks for looking at it!

In `_get_minus_one` it would be good to have a doctest for each branch of the `if/else`. And looking at the code we really need a `multiplicative_order` on `SL2Z` elements (see #20373).
