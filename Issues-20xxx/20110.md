Currently, `Polyhedron_base.graph()` intersects with the base set of all vertices in every of the *n* over 2 loop iterations in line 3321, where *n* is the number of vertices. This is useless as far as I can see, because the sets that are being intersected cannot possibly ever contain something that is not a vertex.

Leaving out this additional intersection speeds up the process of constructing the graph significantly. I tested it on a 4 GHz machine for the polyhedron `polytopes.associahedron(['E', 7])`, and with my patch it only took close to two minutes instead of 5:15. Other examples like `polytopes.associahedron(['E', 8])` also suggest a *significant* speedup, although I don't have precise measurements from the same machine.

I also tested that the resulting graph is actually the same for some polyhedra.
