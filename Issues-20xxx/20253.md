sage: G = DiGraph([(0,1),(1,0)])
sage: G2 = G.copy(immutable=True)
sage: G2.is_strongly_connected()
False
```

The problem comes from bad initialization of some attributes in static sparse backend. We add two lines to fix this problem. We also deprecate four methods of `CGraph` to simplify its usage (namely `_in_degree`, `_out_degree`, `_num_verts`, `_num_arcs`).

I guess that there are much more methods that actually do not work. The thing is that there are uninitialized variables used by some of the methods in `CGraph` that are not initialized by `StaticSparseCGraph`.

At least adding these lines at the end of the init method, with possibly other initialization, we ensure that all backends provide the same information.
I'm surprized none of us noticed that before.

There are other weird stuff

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,1)])
sage: G2 = G.copy(immutable=True)
sage: G2._backend.is_connected()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend.StaticSpars'
object has no attribute 'num_edges'
```
The thing is that it is not clear to me what attributes and methods should be implemented in a new backend.
