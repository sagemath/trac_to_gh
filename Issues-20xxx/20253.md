```
sage: G = DiGraph([(0,1),(1,0)])
sage: G2 = G.copy(immutable=True)
sage: G2.is_strongly_connected()
False
```

The problem comes from bad initialization of some attributes in static sparse backend. We add two lines to fix this problem. We also deprecate four methods of `CGraph` to simplify its usage (namely `_in_degree`, `_out_degree`, `_num_verts`, `_num_arcs`).

I guess that there are much more methods that actually do not work. The thing is that there are uninitialized variables used by some of the methods in `CGraph` that are not initialized by `StaticSparseCGraph`.
