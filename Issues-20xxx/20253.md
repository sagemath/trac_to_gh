```
sage: G = DiGraph([(0,1),(1,0)])
sage: G2 = G.copy(immutable=True)
sage: G2.is_strongly_connected()
False
```

The problem comes from bad initialization of some attributes in static sparse backend. We add two lines to fix this problem. We also deprecate four methods of `CGraph` to simplify its usage (namely `_in_degree`, `_out_degree`, `_num_verts`, `_num_arcs`).

At least adding these lines at the end of the init method, with possibly other initialization, we ensure that all backends provide the same information.

sage: G2._backend.is_connected()
Traceback (most recent call last):

The thing is that it is not clear to me what attributes and methods should be implemented in a new backend.

the patch is working well and passes but has one doctest error (I tried `sage -tp src/sage/graphs/`
