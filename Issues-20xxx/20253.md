False
```

The problem comes from bad initialization of some attributes in static sparse backend. We add two lines to fix this problem. We also deprecate four methods of `CGraph` to simplify its usage (namely `_in_degree`, `_out_degree`, `_num_verts`, `_num_arcs`).

I guess that there are much more methods that actually do not work. The thing is that there are uninitialized variables used by some of the methods in `CGraph` that are not initialized by `StaticSparseCGraph`.

At least adding these lines at the end of the init method, with possibly other initialization, we ensure that all backends provide the same information.

sage: G2._backend.is_connected()
Traceback (most recent call last):

The thing is that it is not clear to me what attributes and methods should be implemented in a new backend.
