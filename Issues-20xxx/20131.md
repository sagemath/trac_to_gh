Two things:

- In padic_generic.py, in the doc you changed, could you also put it in code format?
- For `_find_zeros_mod_p`, while we are making changes, we should make it the declarative `Find`.

Also do we want to change the formatting of the error messages? (surprise)

Hello,

I only changed a few of the raise formatting (no capital, not dot). This kind of change makes the ticket less obvious to review. Now let us see if the bots complains.
