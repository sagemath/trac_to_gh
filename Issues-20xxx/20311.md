The standard-form transformation works well with #20296. Thanks very much! (I'll update the branch of #20296 when this ticket is merged.)

Some issues:

- I think the constant term should appear in the latex representation of the problem when nonzero.

- And it also needs to be passed through to `InteractiveLPProblemStandardForm` in `standard_form`. I have added a (failing) doctest.

- And then `InteractiveLPProblemStandardForm` needs to pass it on to the dictionaries...

- I think there should be a doctest that illustrates how the constant term interacts with `is_negative`.

- Passing `slack_variables` as a keyword argument to `standard_form` is a bit of an awkward interface, though, because `standard_form` may split equations and so the user would have to anticipate this. Perhaps it would be better to provide a list of "row_names" instead and modify that somehow when equations are split.

I'll probably work on it next weekend. For the record - it is not a good idea to edit old comments as apparently there are no notifications sent about it and it was a bit of an accident that I looked up.

Also, bloody trac does not let me post reply comments for no reason, but:
- I think problems should be typeset as `10 + max 5 x1 - 7 x2`, i.e. with constant term first and out of max/min as it makes it easier to "get rid of it" when desirable.
- I was not sure about the standard form, but probably it should include the constant term as well. And the dual problem has to be adjusted to make sure that optimal values still agree.
- For dictionaries convenient typesetting is probably in the objective as a part of its "name", as in `5 - z = 10 x1 + 9 x2`
- Interaction with negativity should also clearly documented.
- For "row_names" - I'd rather not introduce even more concepts and logic. If a user cares about slack names, he better know what they are and how they are formed. Also, if the only issue is the base name clash (without index), then the number of constraints does not matter, just pass that base name and indices will be taken care of.

It prints the non-shifted objective value. 
I suppose things would take care of themselves if the objective constant term were put in the constant (on the right hand side) of the dictionary, rather than into the objective name.

Agreed about confusion, but the questions in human language are:

A) Is this problem feasible?
B) Is this solution for this problem feasible?

which I want to translate in code to

A) `problem.is_feasible()`
B) `problem.is_feasible(solution)`

and find very natural and not **adding** any confusion at all.

Most students also feel no difference between

C) `problem.optimal_value()`
D) `optimal_dictionary.objective_value()`

since they do give the same values. Yet

C') `problem.work_hard_to_find_optimal_value()`
D') `optimal_dictionary.just_read_off_the_objective_value_you_store()`

are not the right way to teach them the difference.

I think my concern regarding A and B is in part because of Python defaulting semantics. 
If the `solution` argument is missing, people could assume that `is_feasible` somehow talks about the feasibility of some "default" solution (perhaps some "current" solution). 

I don't have a concern regarding the naming of C and D in the code.

What is default/current solution for a problem???

My point with C and D was that it is again just direct translation of "the human language" into code with neither solves nor adds confusion.

How about going with the current addition and seeing how (and with what degree of confusion) it will be received? Overloading methods is a common practice and we can always deprecate the use of arguments if it turns out to be bad.

Well, *I* know that in your design the problem is immutable, but a user might think that if he goes pivoting in "the" dictionary obtained from `initial_dictionary`, this has some effect on the problem. 

> How about going with the current addition and seeing how (and with what degree of confusion) it will be received? Overloading methods is a common practice and we can always deprecate the use of arguments if it turns out to be bad.


OK, fine.
