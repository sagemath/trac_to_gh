Sometimes this can cause building the docs to fail, espcially when
building in a single process.  See #20639

This doesn't fix the underlying issue, but does work around it in
several cases that were affected, simply by using more explicit
references.  From my readings of the docs, I'm pretty sure I got the
updated references right, but someone who knows that code
(`sage.graphs` and `sage.categories`) might want to check.

At least one of these updated references doesn't resolve into a link when I build the docs, it turns out. So maybe it needs to be updated to be even more explicit.

Turns out the issues I was trying to fix here were actually a side-effect of the issue I fixed in #21044, so this ticket can be closed.  Will reopen if this crops up again somehow.
