no typo here? this looks scary...

one way would be to add print statements and then watch doctests failing...

Probably there are some static code analysis tools to help here too, but I'm no expert in these.

I added parameter solver to many methods in `graphs/`. I have certainly missed some, but it's already an improvement. Not sure if I should do the same for other modules in this ticket. it's already a lot of modifications...
