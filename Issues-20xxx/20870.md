The top-level directory in the current source tarball for the nauty spkg has the setgid bit set on it for some reason.

This probably is not intentional and may be harmless in general, but it is causing confusion for Cygwin's permission handling, making the package unbuildable.

Should this be reported upstream?  Who made this tarball?  This is absolutely never clear....

Please do report; however, the tarball needed to be renamed, see #19919, but not re-packed IIRC.

Can't this be fixed on the level of `sage-uncompress-spkg`? Especially since that script already fixes some permission issues.

It is fixed in `sage-uncompress-spkg`; doesn't mean it shouldn't be fixed here too.
