After #20630, the following no longer crashes, but still raises an error:

```
sage: R.<theta> = QQ[]
sage: (theta^2 + 1).galois_group(pari_group=True)
...
PariError: theta already exists with incompatible valence
```
Several methods in `Polynomial_rational_flint()` have the same problem.  We solve this by using the variable name `x` instead of the Sage variable name when converting to a PARI polynomial.

<a id='comment:3'></a>One almost trivial thing:

```diff
-if any (n > 1 for n in F[1]):
+if any(n > 1 for n in F[1]):
```
since `any` is a function in Python, not a keyword. Otherwise LGTM.
