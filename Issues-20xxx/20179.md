It can be useful to query the free variables in an expression.  SR's `variables()` and `arguments()` return all variables in an expression, whether free or bound.  For example:

```
sage: var('y')
y
sage: function('f')
f
sage: e = limit( f(x,y), x=0 )
sage: e
limit(f(x, y), x, 0)
sage: e.variables()
(x, y)
```

I would like to have a `free_variables()` method that returns only `y` in this case.  Is there a recommended way to get this information from an expression?

The free variables in an expression are all its variables excluding any that are bound, for example, in limits, sums, products, or integrals.

See for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_variables_and_bound_variables for a definition.
