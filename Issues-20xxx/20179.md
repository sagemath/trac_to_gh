It can be useful to query the free variables in an expression.  SR's `variables()` and `arguments()` return all variables in an expression, whether free or bound.  For example:

```
sage: var('y')
y
sage: function('f')
f
sage: e = limit( f(x,y), x=0 )
sage: e
limit(f(x, y), x, 0)
sage: e.variables()
(x, y)
```

I would like to have a `free_variables()` method that returns only `y` in this case.  Is there a recommended way to get this information from an expression?

The free variables in an expression are all its variables excluding any that are bound, for example, in limits, sums, products, or integrals.

This is not ready for review because it doesn't work as expected but at least the interface is there now.
