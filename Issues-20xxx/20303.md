```
The `add_variables` method had defects for the CVXOPT, PPL, GLPK. 
Also, `add_linear_constraints` had a defect for CVXOPT.
See new tests added in this ticket.

I first noticed it with the CVXOPT backend. Then, by copying the same doctests to the other backends, I found more errors in the PPL, GLPK backends.
(See #20302 for a discussion regarding doctests for the backends -- there should be a better way than relying on copy-paste discipline.) 

Note, I have copied the doctests to the CPLEX and Gurobi backends but am currently not able to run them.

Besides, if you wanted to solve your LPs with an interior-point method, CVXOPT was the only way. Is it still the case?

I think the answer is yes; neither the GLPK backend nor the CPLEX backend seem to have support for these solvers' interior point algorithms.
