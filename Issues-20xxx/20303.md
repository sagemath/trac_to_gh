The `add_variables` method had defects for the CVXOPT, PPL, GLPK. 
Also, `add_linear_constraints` had a defect for CVXOPT.
See new tests added in this ticket.

I first noticed it with the CVXOPT backend. Then, by copying the same doctests to the other backends, I found more errors in the PPL, GLPK backends.
(See #20302 for a discussion regarding doctests for the backends -- there should be a better way than relying on copy-paste discipline.) 

Note, I have copied the doctests to the CPLEX and Gurobi backends but am currently not able to run them.

this backend was partially just a warm-up for the CVXOPT SDP interface.

Besides, if you wanted to solve your LPs with an interior-point method, CVXOPT was the only way. Is it still the case?

I think the answer is yes; neither the GLPK backend nor the CPLEX backend seem to have support for these solvers' interior point algorithms.

Hello,

You should explain in the ticket description what is not working... and also provide doctests to show that it works now!

I am not sure that `NotImplementedError` is the right error for PPL `add_variable` method. PPL is precisely intended to solve problems over rationals number. I would rather use a `ValueError`.

PPL is a rational MIP solver, not just an LP solver. It's only the Sage backend that does not support setting variables to be integer-constrained.
That's why it's a `NotImplementedError`. I've created a ticket (#20351).

looks good. Do not forget to remove `NotImplementedError` from PPL backend once it can do integer/binary vars from #20354.

I tested CBC, but no CPLEX or GUROBI.
