Using the non-crossing partition lattice, we can implement a Garside structure for dual braid monoids and groups for (well-generated) Complex reflection groups. Moreover, we can use this to implement the Hecke algebras.

Here is a first trivial way of getting a (non-reduced) presentation for the dual braid monoid:

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(24); W.is_well_generated()
True
sage: NC = W.noncrossing_partition_lattice()
sage: X = W.reflections().inverse_family()
sage: for chain in NC.maximal_chains():^J    print [ X[chain[i-1].inverse()*chain[i]] for i in range(1,len(chain)) ]
```
For whatever reason, here is the documentation of Hecke algebras in Chevie:
