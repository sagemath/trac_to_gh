The parent of the inverse of a Laurent polynomial can be three different things

```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: parent(~x)
Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: parent(~(2*x))
Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: parent(~(x+1))
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```

This is against the principle: "the result of an arithmetic operation should only depend on the parent".

At the same time we provide a (partial) conversion from the fraction field back to the original ring.

So you suggest to return always a fraction? In that case we would need a good conversion from such fractions back to Laurent polynomials (for the ones that actually can be converted).

Yes! We could also implement a specific function to inverse units as

```
sage: (-1).inverse_of_unit()
-1
sage: m._invert_unit()
[ 1 -1]
[-1  2]
```
Though, we would have to chose the name (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/SLfWHJp4Apk).

It is *really* annoying to not be able to do `1 / x` and stay within Laurent polynomials as there is a lot more functionality available than in the fraction field. So -1 on always returning an element in the fraction field (in this case).

Modifying the coercion model is out of the scope of this ticket ;-) What about `1 / 1`? The result should stay in whatever ring `1` belongs to? The advantage of the coercion model approach is that there is no ambiguity.

I agree that we should be able to invert `x` inside the Laurent polynomials (hence my post on sage-devel mentioned in [comment:2](#comment:2)). But I don't agree that the syntax should be `1 / x`.
