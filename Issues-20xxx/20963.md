The parent of the inverse of a Laurent polynomial can be three different things

```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: parent(~x)
Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: parent(~(2*x))
Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: parent(~(x+1))
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```

This is against the principle: "the result of an arithmetic operation should only depend on the parent".

At the same time we provide a (partial) conversion from the fraction field back to the original ring.

So you suggest to return always a fraction? In that case we would need a good conversion from such fractions back to Laurent polynomials (for the ones that actually can be converted).

Yes! We could also implement a specific function to inverse units as

```
sage: (-1).inverse_of_unit()
-1
sage: m._invert_unit()
[ 1 -1]
[-1  2]
```
Though, we would have to chose the name (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/SLfWHJp4Apk).

It is *really* annoying to not be able to do `1 / x` and stay within Laurent polynomials as there is a lot more functionality available than in the fraction field. So -1 on always returning an element in the fraction field (in this case).

Modifying the coercion model is out of the scope of this ticket ;-) What about `1 / 1`? The result should stay in whatever ring `1` belongs to? The advantage of the coercion model approach is that there is no ambiguity.

I agree that we should be able to invert `x` inside the Laurent polynomials (hence my post on sage-devel mentioned in [comment:2](#comment%3A2)). But I don't agree that the syntax should be `1 / x`.

I also think this abuse is okay from the POV of the code as the coercion framework allows you to not care when doing generic arithmetic operations. Besides, sometimes it is better to break principles/rules. ;)
