Catalogs of codes/encoders/decoders and `index.rst` file in `sage.coding` contains several problems:

- some references are missing, some other are duplicated,
- classes are listed without any specific order, and
- catalogs randomly use `import` and `lazy_import`.

This ticket fixes these problems.

I pushed some fixes.

A few remarks:

- I did not change `index.rst`... Yet. In this file, I introduced a set of headlines in #19907, and some of them might not the best. What do you think should be changed?
- Everything is now alphabetically sorted in `*_catalog.py`.
- Everything is now lazy imported in `*_catalog.py`...
- But Guruswami-Sudan decoder, because lazy importing it creates some errors in the decoder registration framework. It's possible to work around by moving the registration from `gs_decoder.py` to `grs.py`, but in that case, because of the lazy import being triggered by a call to `codes.<tab>`, it's not possible to write `from guruswami_sudan.gs_decoder import n_k_params` which creates errors in the doctesting framework...
If you have an idea to fix this, I'm interested.

Best,

David

Suggestion for headlines in `index.rst`. Note that I'm not including every single module; I'm not sure that makes sense.

You can change the title a module gets in a toc by writing "This is my title <mymodule>" instead of simply "mymodule".


```

# Coding Theory objects

- Linear Code and its abstract base class
- Decoder
- Encoder
- Channel

# Catalogs

- Index of channels
- Index of codes
- Index of decoders
- Index of encoders

# Code Constructions

- Constructing a linear code given a generator matrix <linear_code>

The named code families below are represented in Sage by their own classes, allowing specialised implementations of e.g. decoding or computation of properties. 

- Generalized Reed-Solomon code
- Hamming code

In contrast, for some code families Sage can only construct their generator matrix and has no other a priori knowledge on them.

- Code families whose generator matrix can be constructed
- Generator matrices construced using GAP-Guava
- Database of two-weight codes
- Self-dual binary codes
- Binary codes, fast implementation


# Methods and Operations related to Linear Codes

- Bounds on linear codes <index of bounds>
- Delsarte upper bounds, a.k.a. Linear Programming upper bounds
- Canonical forms and automorphisms for linear codes over finite fields


# Source coding

- Huffman Encoding


# Indices and Tables
- Bla bla

```

Other notes:

- It's a pity that Guruswami--Sudan is not easily seen when browsing Reed--Solomon codes. It could be added with a note to the top of the doc of `grs.py`.
- The module `code_bounds` is just a messy version of the index of bounds. So do we want a link to it? Further, I didn't put this index under "Catalogs" since its more of a module than a catalogue. Also, it's semi-deprecated so we don't want to give it too much attention ;-)

Best,
Johan

Hello,

I fixed some of the things you mentioned:

- I added a proper link to Guruswami-Sudan decoder in `grs.py`
- I reformatted `index.rst` as advised (I agree with you about not including every module BTW)

There's still some minor things to change (e.g. change headlines in `linear_code.py`), which
I would have done easily if I was not facing the weirdest of errors: when I rebuilt documentation after the changes in commit `8d41ac4`, everything went fine. Then, I switched branches and when I came back to this branch, some errors appeared when running make: 

```
[dochtml] OSError: [coding   ] /home/david/Desktop/sage/src/doc/en/reference/coding/index.rst:10:
WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document u'sage/coding/linear_code'
```

I moved this block, and it went fine. To be sure, I ran again `make doc-clean` and `make` and got the same error I just fixed?!

I pushed the changes anyway... Can one of you run it on your machine and let me know what happens?

David

Hello,

`codes.LinearCode` is not available anymore, which breaks several doctests in `linear_code.py`.

Which makes me wonder: as we're cleaning up some import mess here, should we remove the last codes families from the global namespace at the same time?
Before your changes, it was possible to build a linear code by using `LinearCode` or `codes.LinearCode`. I propose to deprecate `LinearCode` from the global namespace and keep only `codes.LinearCode`, and do the same with `LinearCodeFromVectorSpace`.

Another one: there are some other things available in the global namespace (`Krawtchouk`, `Kravchuk,`delsarte_bound_hamming_space`, `delsarte_bound_additive_hamming_space`). Should we clean that as well?

Another remark: it's probably not necessary to move `guruswami_sudan/rootfinding`, as #21331 simply deletes this module (actually, it moves it from `coding` to `polynomials`).
By the way, I guess we should manually merge #21331 with this ticket, as I'm afraid they will conflict.

Otherwise, it looks good. Thanks for taking care of the rephrasing.

David

Hmm, comparing with `Graph` and `graphs.<tab>`, then `LinearCode` should be in the global namespace but not the catalog. I think this makes sense. I'm OK with putting `LinearCode` in `codes` if you insist, but I would prefer `LinearCode` to stay in the global namespace.

I agree, let's fix this now.

Ok, if `Graphs` does the same, let's be consistent with it and keep `LinearCode` in the global namespace.
