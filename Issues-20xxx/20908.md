```
Catalogs of codes/encoders/decoders and `index.rst` file in `sage.coding` contains several problems:

- some references are missing, some other are duplicated,
- classes are listed without any specific order, and
- catalogs randomly use `import` and `lazy_import`.

This ticket fixes these problems.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I pushed some fixes.

A few remarks:

- I did not change `index.rst`... Yet. In this file, I introduced a set of headlines in #19907, and some of them might not the best. What do you think should be changed?
- Everything is now alphabetically sorted in `*_catalog.py`.
- Everything is now lazy imported in `*_catalog.py`...
- But Guruswami-Sudan decoder, because lazy importing it creates some errors in the decoder registration framework. It's possible to work around by moving the registration from `gs_decoder.py` to `grs.py`, but in that case, because of the lazy import being triggered by a call to `codes.<tab>`, it's not possible to write `from guruswami_sudan.gs_decoder import n_k_params` which creates errors in the doctesting framework...
If you have an idea to fix this, I'm interested.

Best,

David

<a id='comment:3'></a>Suggestion for headlines in `index.rst`. Note that I'm not including every single module; I'm not sure that makes sense.

You can change the title a module gets in a toc by writing "This is my title <mymodule>" instead of simply "mymodule".


```

# Coding Theory objects

- Linear Code and its abstract base class
- Decoder
- Encoder
- Channel

# Catalogs

- Index of channels
- Index of codes
- Index of decoders
- Index of encoders

# Code Constructions

- Constructing a linear code given a generator matrix <linear_code>

The named code families below are represented in Sage by their own classes, allowing specialised implementations of e.g. decoding or computation of properties. 

- Generalized Reed-Solomon code
- Hamming code

In contrast, for some code families Sage can only construct their generator matrix and has no other a priori knowledge on them.

- Code families whose generator matrix can be constructed
- Generator matrices construced using GAP-Guava
- Database of two-weight codes
- Self-dual binary codes
- Binary codes, fast implementation


# Methods and Operations related to Linear Codes

- Bounds on linear codes <index of bounds>
- Delsarte upper bounds, a.k.a. Linear Programming upper bounds
- Canonical forms and automorphisms for linear codes over finite fields


# Source coding

- Huffman Encoding


# Indices and Tables
- Bla bla

```

Other notes:

- It's a pity that Guruswami--Sudan is not easily seen when browsing Reed--Solomon codes. It could be added with a note to the top of the doc of `grs.py`.
- The module `code_bounds` is just a messy version of the index of bounds. So do we want a link to it? Further, I didn't put this index under "Catalogs" since its more of a module than a catalogue. Also, it's semi-deprecated so we don't want to give it too much attention ;-)

Best,
Johan

<a id='comment:5'></a>Hello,

I fixed some of the things you mentioned:

- I added a proper link to Guruswami-Sudan decoder in `grs.py`
- I reformatted `index.rst` as advised (I agree with you about not including every module BTW)

There's still some minor things to change (e.g. change headlines in `linear_code.py`), which
I would have done easily if I was not facing the weirdest of errors: when I rebuilt documentation after the changes in commit `8d41ac4`, everything went fine. Then, I switched branches and when I came back to this branch, some errors appeared when running make: 

```
[dochtml] OSError: [coding   ] /home/david/Desktop/sage/src/doc/en/reference/coding/index.rst:10:
WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document u'sage/coding/linear_code'
```

I moved this block, and it went fine. To be sure, I ran again `make doc-clean` and `make` and got the same error I just fixed?!

I pushed the changes anyway... Can one of you run it on your machine and let me know what happens?

David

<a id='comment:16'></a>Hello,

`codes.LinearCode` is not available anymore, which breaks several doctests in `linear_code.py`.

Which makes me wonder: as we're cleaning up some import mess here, should we remove the last codes families from the global namespace at the same time?
Before your changes, it was possible to build a linear code by using `LinearCode` or `codes.LinearCode`. I propose to deprecate `LinearCode` from the global namespace and keep only `codes.LinearCode`, and do the same with `LinearCodeFromVectorSpace`.

Another one: there are some other things available in the global namespace (`Krawtchouk`, `Kravchuk,`delsarte_bound_hamming_space`, `delsarte_bound_additive_hamming_space`). Should we clean that as well?

Another remark: it's probably not necessary to move `guruswami_sudan/rootfinding`, as #21331 simply deletes this module (actually, it moves it from `coding` to `polynomials`).
By the way, I guess we should manually merge #21331 with this ticket, as I'm afraid they will conflict.

Otherwise, it looks good. Thanks for taking care of the rephrasing.

> Before your changes, it was possible to build a linear code by using `LinearCode` or `codes.LinearCode`. I propose to deprecate `LinearCode` from the global namespace and keep only `codes.LinearCode`, and do the same with `LinearCodeFromVectorSpace`.


Hmm, comparing with `Graph` and `graphs.<tab>`, then `LinearCode` should be in the global namespace but not the catalog. I think this makes sense. I'm OK with putting `LinearCode` in `codes` if you insist, but I would prefer `LinearCode` to stay in the global namespace.

> Another one: there are some other things available in the global namespace (`Krawtchouk`, `Kravchuk,`delsarte_bound_hamming_space`, `delsarte_bound_additive_hamming_space`). Should we clean that as well?


I agree, let's fix this now.

> Another remark: it's probably not necessary to move `guruswami_sudan/rootfinding`, as #21331 simply deletes this module (actually, it moves it from `coding` to `polynomials`).
> By the way, I guess we should manually merge #21331 with this ticket, as I'm afraid they will conflict.


Good point, we should do that.

Will you take of the other changes, or do you prefer me to do it?
