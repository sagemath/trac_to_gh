I'm trying to build the docs on Cygwin and am getting a consistent crash at:

```

`0xC0000005` is apparently an access violation.  Not clear yet where it's coming from, but it's probably a Cygwin bug.  The reference to "pkg-config" is especially bizarre.

I'm experimenting with a patch so that if `SAGE_NUM_THREADS=1` the doc build doesn't use multiprocessing *at all* and that seems to be working.  So that might be a worthwhile patch to add anyways.

Then, with such a patch, I can further modify things so that `NUM_THREADS=1` is forced on Cygwin, just as a workaround until and unless I can get to the root of the problem.

Hmm, not sure why that would be happening, but the line in question reads:

This syntax would seem to automatically imply the `edge_label` method of `GenericGraph` so I don't know why it would think that was ambiguous.

Yes, I see now. I think this may be a bug in Sphinx (is this known)?

For example, when generating a reference for `DiGraph.edge_label` (which is referenced in the docstring for `DiGraph` as <code>:meth:\`.edge_label\`</code>) it comes up with multiple matches: 

```
[(u'sage.combinat.knutson_tao_puzzles.PuzzlePiece.edge_label', (u'sage/combinat/knutson_tao_puzzles', u'method')), (u'sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.edge_label', (u'sage/graphs/generic_graph', u'method'))]
```

In this case it should of course use `GenericGraph.edge_label`, but it doesn't recognize that `GenericGraph` is a subclass of `DiGraph` and should be preferred.  Instead this ends up generating an incorrect reference.

A workaround would be to use a more explicit reference.

Repeated `rebaseall`s don't seem to resolve the issue.  Will need to take a deeper look sometime.  In the meantime I have a patch to not use `multiprocessing.Pool` when `SAGE_NUM_THREADS=1`, and that works around the issue.

This was probably related to some other bugs, but I'm not sure anymore.  However, this has not been a problem for some time--since other issues have been fixed the doc build runs fine on Cygwin, even in parallel (though there are still some issues, namely #25089).
