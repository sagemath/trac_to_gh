```
The methods `__len__`, `list`, `_list_from_iterator_cashed` in the Parent class conflict with those of the `FiniteEnumerableSets` category.  One symptom is #20743. The proper place for them is the `EnumeratedSets` category (#12955), and the three methods are moved  to therein.

Along the way, the patch also introduces "Enumerated" axiom into the category framework. The effect is for lots of cases, we get nicer names for the joint category with the enumerated sets category.

I have some issues with this:

* You are arguing that these functions **should** be in `EnumeratedSets`, but you move them to `Sets`. Why not move them to `EnumeratedSets` and start adding parents to that category? At least, you should keep the TODO that this would be best?

* The `list` function now returns a copy of the (cached) list every time. We had a long discussion on sage-devel as well as on #20743 about this, and though complete consensus didn't arise, everyone seemed to think that `list` should **not** return a fresh copy every time. Rather we should somehow flag the list as being immutable.

Apart from that it makes sense to move those functions from `Parent`.

About the default implementation of `__len__()`: perhaps it could check whether `self` has a `cardinality` method, in which case it could return that.

I agree.

I will consider that while moving the methods again into `EnumerableSets` category. For that, now the ticket is in "needs work" status :-)

It tests the method `_cardinality_from_iterator`, which is removed in the current patch. Now `.cardinality()` method is implemented instead just using `self.list()` inherited from the enumerated sets category, which itself uses the iterator of self.

So it seemed to me that the `_test_enumerated_set_iter_cardinality` lost its point with the current patch. Even the example ("let us now break...") under the test does not work. Would you try that?

But I may have missed the point of the test as intended by the original author. Then would you elaborate on that?

With the current patch, the original code `tuple(self.algebra_generators())` falls into an infinite loop in the case that `self.algebra_generators()` is an infinite set. The change is to avoid this. I don't know a better way to deal with this... 

> Also, you should avoid having a bare `except:` statement.


I see. I will correct that.

The change is to avoid this. I don't know a better way to deal with this... \n\n\nPreviously, if we were calling `tuple(X)` when `X` was known to be infinite, then this would fail with IIRC a `NotImplementedError` (try `tuple(ZZ)`). In the example, `self.algebra_generators` is known to be infinite:\n\n```\nsage: J = JordanAlgebra(FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3, 'x,y,z'))\nsage: J.algebra_generators().cardinality()\n+Infinity\n```\nSo the error is correct (although the reason was not because the family should know it is in the  infinite enumerated sets category). Thus I would propose fixing the category issue of `LazyFamily` when the keys are known to be infinite.\n\nAlso, I am slightly of the opinion that changing this behavior of enumerated sets with unknown cardinality is a regression. I believe that if the user knows the set is finite, they can do an explicit iteration over the object and we should force them to do that as a safeguard against the infinite loops.",

It is there to test that (`X.list()` or) `list(X) == X.cardinality()`, which could break anytime a user directly implements `cardinality` (such as on the powerset of a finite set).

Previously, if we were calling `tuple(X)` when `X` was known to be infinite, then this would fail with IIRC a `NotImplementedError` (try `tuple(ZZ)`). In the example, `self.algebra_generators` is known to be infinite:

```
sage: J = JordanAlgebra(FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3, 'x,y,z'))
sage: J.algebra_generators().cardinality()
+Infinity
```
So the error is correct (although the reason was not because the family should know it is in the  infinite enumerated sets category). Thus I would propose fixing the category issue of `LazyFamily` when the keys are known to be infinite.

Also, I am slightly of the opinion that changing this behavior of enumerated sets with unknown cardinality is a regression. I believe that if the user knows the set is finite, they can do an explicit iteration over the object and we should force them to do that as a safeguard against the infinite loops.

Hi Kwankyu!

Thanks for your much needed work on cleaning the generic code for
enumerated sets. This code is tricky as it aims to cover many
different use cases, trying to do "just the right thing" in most of
them. It has grown from years of practice and this is all more artwork
than science ...

-1 on removing `_cardinality_from_iterator`. This methods
intentionally supports computing the cardinality of very large sets,
without paying the memory overhead of storing all the elements. It has
already been used for sets that just would not fit in memory.

-1 on removing `_test_enumerated_set_iter_cardinality`: it does not
only test `_cardinality_from_iterator`, but also all cases where both
`__iter__` and `cardinality` are implemented by an enumerated set.

Cheers,
                            Nicolas

Good point. I missed this.

I agree.

I will recover these and also try to incorporate tscrim's criticisms. 

As you will understand, it is quite tricky to accomplish this ticket's task while not failing parents relying on the existing structure...

From a quick look at things, I don't like all of the `@cached_method`'s on `__len__` because `cardinality` should be quick to compute or `list` is (generically) cached (and very fast to get the length of).

You should use <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> since it is essentially code.

This part of [comment:22](#comment%3A22) is still true:
> Also, I am slightly of the opinion that changing this behavior of enumerated sets with unknown cardinality is a regression. I believe that if the user knows the set is finite, they can do an explicit iteration over the object and we should force them to do that as a safeguard against the infinite loops. 


Thinking about it a bit more, I am more convinced that this is a definite regression because it can cause infinite loops in cases that it previously did not.

The problem I have is if a set `X` has unknown cardinality, then previously, if you call `len(X)`, it would error out to prevent you from entering into an infinite loop. If I understand the current code, it will not do that, and instead try to compute the length (which generically would try `X.list()`) and run into that infinite loop if `X` was indeed infinite.

Before:

```sage
sage: R = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([1], lambda a: [a+1])
sage: R.category()
Category of enumerated sets
sage: R.list()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: unknown cardinality
```
With the branch:

```sage
sage: R = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([1], lambda a: [a+1])
sage: R.list()  # Still waiting...
```
Actually, `__len__` is defined in `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` to return `None`, but the same issue would occur if it was not.

- I don't see the point of `__len__` in `subword_complex.py`. If it is necessary, then it does not need to be cached and the `EXAMPLES::` needs a blankline after it.
- Same for `abelian_group.py`.

The issue is that `SubwordComplex` is a `SimplicialComplex`, and while the latter is not an enumerated set, the former considers itself to be. However, `SimplicialComplex` does not take a category as input. So I added this and put `SubwordComplex` in the enumerated finite simplicial complexes category.

I also pushed some other improvements to the abelian groups and the libgap mixin groups. Although infinite abelian groups do not iterate properly, but that is a bug for another ticket.
