Followup of #13580, which creates a module whose doctests assume that the host has at least two cores.

In the longer term, we could imagine to have a `# multicore` option for doctests, but let us just fix the doctests for this ticket to test whether the host has a single core first.

Hi thiery,

I just pushed a 1 character fix. It allows two parallel processes even on single core machines. Note that on those kinds of machines, it make no sense to use map_reduce. The same functionality is provided by the `run_serial` method which makes no use of multi-core.

Can you test this patch on your patchbot and report failure if any ?

Florent

Hi thiery,

How long will it takes ? I've to get up early tomorrow...

While waiting, I'm playing with SSE/AVX. I've a speedup of x20 for a function which sorts 16 bytes.
