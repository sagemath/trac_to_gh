Then why offer the choice? I ask because, if you remove the `algorithm` parameter, it looks like a matrix superclass method is trying to figure out what to do by a "what subclass am I" heuristic. In that case, if the matrix class hierarchy is good enough, it might make more sense to move the subclass-specific behavior into subclass methods.

For example, the default `Matrix` would implement the "exact" or "exactconj" algorithms. (Is there a situation where "exactconj" does the wrong thing on a real matrix?)

General principle: because I see no reason to *not* offer the choice. If a choice is available, why not allow the user to override that choice? Of course, offer a good default.

More specifically: it might be hard to guess between `exact` and `exactconj`.

> I ask because, if you remove the `algorithm` parameter, it looks like a matrix superclass method is trying to figure out what to do by a "what subclass am I" heuristic.

I disagree completely. This has nothing to do with the `type()` of the matrix, but with the mathematical properties of the parent.

With your proposal, `pseudoinverse()` would no longer work for matrices over `RR` or `CC` or for sparse matrices.

Fair enough, but the resulting type of the matrix is determined by the ring that you pass in (and whether or not it's sparse).

You would at least get the exact(conj) implementation in every case. But you would have to override that in every subclass where it makes sense, like the generic_dense ones for RR/CC. If that's difficult or results in code duplication, then it's fine as-is. I just brought it up in case you hadn't considered it.
