For Weyl groups, we have

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['E',7])
sage: %timeit len(W.long_element(as_word=True))
10 loops, best of 3: 98.6 ms per loop
sage: %timeit W.number_of_reflections()
1 loop, best of 3: 208 ms per loop
```
and for Coxeter groups, we have

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['E',7])
sage: %timeit len(W.long_element(as_word=True))
1 loop, best of 3: 206 ms per loop
sage: %timeit W.number_of_reflections()
1 loop, best of 3: 378 ms per loop
```

I think that we should either use the longest element, or, even better, to speed the computations of the degrees (which are used to compute the number of reflections).

Some timings with the branch of #20943

```
sage: sage: W = WeylGroup(['E',7])
sage: sage: %timeit len(W.long_element(as_word=True))
10 loops, best of 3: 41.6 ms per loop
sage: sage: %timeit W.number_of_reflections()
The slowest run took 1047579.52 times longer than the fastest.
This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 57.2 ns per loop
sage: sage: %timeit sum(d-1 for d in W.degrees())
10 loops, best of 3: 41.1 ms per loop
```
