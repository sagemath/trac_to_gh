<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi,

I fixed ambiguity in the documentation of some functions. I also fixed a minor bug in the method `relative_field_representation`.

I added a function which basically invert the relative field embedding (I mean, given an absolute field element `x` which actually lies in the relative field, the function cast `x` into the relative field).

Didn't check the other methods.

Open for review.

Julien

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hi,

I reviewed the rest of the class and modified some names (basically 'degree' instead of 'power'). I also added a function to give the extension degree between the medium and the big field, as we often need it.

Open for review.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Hello,

I made two small changes:

- There was an indentation error in the docstring of `cast_into_relative_field`, which I fixed.
- In Python, it's not necessary to write `if (check):`, `if check:` is enough `:)`. Thus I removed the unnecessary parenthesis.

Otherwise, it's good to go! If you agree with my tiny changes, you can set it to `positive_review`.
Thanks for your fixes.

BTW, the patchbot doctests error due to `guava.py` have been fixed in #20952.

Best,

David
