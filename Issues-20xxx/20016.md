This ticket splits the matrix constructor in two pieces:

1. The generic `matrix(...)` call, which is kept in `sage.matrix.constructor` but compiled with Cython. The `_matrix_constructor` function is moved to the `__call__` method of `MatrixFactory`.

2. Constructors for special matrices (e.g. `column_matrix()`) are moved to `sage.matrix.special`.

In order to make reviewing easy, this ticket implements the above with minimal changes: apart from moving the code, only imports are changed. Any further suggestions to improve the code should be discussed in other tickets.

This breaks a silly sagenb doctest: [https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/362](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/362)

Depends on #20047

**Branch/Commit:** [a93d6da6a5df7bd41f73f1140ada76871b0f6adc](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/a93d6da6a5df7bd41f73f1140ada76871b0f6adc)

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.
