I implemented a function to project affine curves that allows the user to specify coordinates to use in the projection. If the given coordinates yield a projection that doesn't have a curve as its image, an error will be raised. I also implemented a plane_projection function that doesn't take any user input but just tries to find two coordinates that will yield a projection that has a plane curve as its image. I think such a projection should always exist, but right now my approach to finding one is just trying all possible projections to two coordinates.

For projective curves, I added some functionality for working with curves defined over finite fields. Now the projection function will test all of the points of the ambient space of a curve over a finite field until it finds a point not on the curve. An error is returned if the curve contains all of the ambient space points.

A few questions:

- It could make sense in some cases to consider projections even if the image is not a curve (or if it is, but some components could be mapped to points). I think we should allow that, but maybe raising a warning about it.

- In python (and sage), indices start in 0. Shouldn't we follow that approach when selecting the coordinates we project to? MAybe we could also allow a list (or tuple) of variables as input.

- don't modify the input `indices` inside the function. That could have undesired side effects. Instead, create an internal copy.

- I think you go into too much trouble to define the elimination ideal. Just calling `elimination_ideal`on it should give you the ideal defining the image. Something like this:

```
sage: A.<x,y,z> = AffineSpace(QQ,3)
sage: C = Curve([y^7 - x^2 + x^3 - 2*z, z^2 - x^7 - y^2], A)
sage: I = C.defining_ideal()
sage: IE = I.elimination_ideal(z)
sage: IE
Ideal (y^14 + 2*x^3*y^7 - 2*x^2*y^7 - 4*x^7 + x^6 - 2*x^5 + x^4 - 4*y^2) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field
sage: A2 = AffineSpace(QQ, 2, (x,y))
sage: H = C.Hom(A2)
sage: phi = H((x,y))
sage: phi
Scheme morphism:
  From: Affine Curve over Rational Field defined by y^7 + x^3 - x^2 - 2*z, -x^7 - y^2 + z^2
  To:   Affine Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x, y, z) to
        (x, y)
sage: C2 = Curve([A2.coordinate_ring()(i) for i in IE.gens()],A2)
sage: C2
Affine Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by y^14 + 2*x^3*y^7 - 2*x^2*y^7 - 4*x^7 + x^6 - 2*x^5 + x^4 - 4*y^2
```

should be enough to construct both the morphism and the image curve. Something similar could be done for the projective case.

- Do we want to create new coordinates in the case of affine projection? or would it be better to keep the original ones? Maybe have an option for this?

- I think it would me slightly more pythonic to return a tuple instead of a list.

- In the projective case, ¿would it make sense to have an option to project to smaller subspaces?

- In the plane projection method, instead of breaking the loop, just return `L`. Also, you could avoid the double loop by just iterating over the Subsets of the coordinates (maybe this is slower, but I think it would make the code easyer to read).

- I am confused by this part of the code in the projective projection:

```
            l = list(PP.gens())
            for i in range(n+1):
                l[i] = 1
                while(F(l) == 0):
                    l[i] = l[i] + 1
```
 I think that, in general, you could get simpler projections if you start with l[i] = 0 (for instance, most times you will get the projection from point [0:0:...: 0:1].

- In this code, why do you create H in the first time? You redefine it just later without using it:

```
        H = Hom(PP, PP)
        # only need the first n coordinates of the change of coordinates map
        coords = [PP.gens()[i] - Q[i]/Q[n]*PP.gens()[n] for i in range(n)]
        # create the projection map onto the first n coordinates
        PP2 = ProjectiveSpace(self.base_ring(), n - 1)
        H = Hom(self, PP2)
```

All tests currently pass, but in looking through the functionality I don't think the 'newvariables' approach is consistent with other parts of sage. the names of the variables does not specify the space. So even if you have two affine spaces of the same dimension, base_ring and variables, they will be isomorphic, but not the same object in Sage. I think it would be better to have the user give the space to project into.

Similarly for the 'same variables' boolean. They really aren't the same variables. I think this just leads to user confusions since now you have two 'x's that mean different things.

Finally, for plane projection, you don't allow this functionality.

I think in all cases the better solution is to allow the user to specify the space, not the names of the variables. Look, for example, at the affine_patch and projective_embedding functionality for subschemes.

Unrelated: the doc tests do not test the input checks nor do they test the 'newvariables' parameter.
