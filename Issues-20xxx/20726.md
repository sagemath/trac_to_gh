```
In recent tests, using pari is faster than Sage's current default algorithm for computing homology groups of chain complexes. For example:

```
sage: %timeit simplicial_complexes.RandomComplex(12, 4).chain_complex().homology(algorithm='auto')
1 loop, best of 3: 7.84 s per loop
sage: %timeit simplicial_complexes.RandomComplex(12, 4).chain_complex().homology(algorithm='pari')
1 loop, best of 3: 1.11 s per loop
```
So change the default setting for the keyword `algorithm` from `'auto'` to `'pari'`.

It also appears to be faster to compute the entire chain complex rather than compute a contractible subcomplex and use the relative chain complex. So we should use `enlarge=False` as the default in the `_homology_` method for simplicial complexes.

Okay, it looks like sometimes `enlarge=True` is faster, sometimes slower. When it's slower, it's not much slower. So we'll leave it as is.
