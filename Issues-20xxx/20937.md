#20884 isn't merged yet so did this really need an additional ticket?

I didn't add the `-y` switch to `sage` though, but just just `sage-spkg`.  I guess `sage -i` can pass arguments through to it though?

I opened a new ticket to avoid another race with the release manager.

I think it does.

I mostly added it as an internal interface between the two.  But I guess I can see how it might be useful, especially for someone developing an experimental package.

What I meant to say is, there needs to be a documented switch for "sage -i" and "sage -f" that enables installing experimental packages without asking questions. Right now -y seems to work; so that could be documented; however, if there is a different switch, that's also fine if that is documented.
