Follow up on #20884:

The newly added `-y` switch should be added to the help screen obtained by `sage -advanced`.

And perhaps also in the manual (didn't look).

Depends on #20884

#20884 isn't merged yet so did this really need an additional ticket?

I didn't add the `-y` switch to `sage` though, but just just `sage-spkg`.  I guess `sage -i` can pass arguments through to it though?

I opened a new ticket to avoid another race with the release manager.

I think it does.
