@jdemeyer: you already did the upgrade a bunch of time IIRC.
I could try to review the ticket (which should be trivial) while I have some time this week.

Well, I just took the declarations from PARI and they have `const` in them. And it's true that it probably does not matter for Cython anyway.

<div id="comment:11" align="right">Comment 11</div>

FLINT and PARI `ulong` mess...
I guess that `handle_error.pxd` pulls the PARI headers and `parisage.h` which undefs `ulong` and when `handle_error.pyx` is treated and pulls in `paripriv.h` which wants `ulong` we lose...
Not sure what the cleanest solution would be.
Maybe `#define pari_ulong` in `parisage.h` and define/undefine `ulong` in a custom `pariprivsage.h` which pulls `paripriv.h` in (just as `parisage.h` does for `pari.h`).

```
