`@`Jeroen: you already did the upgrade a bunch of time IIRC.
I could try to review the ticket (which should be trivial) while I have some time this week.
(Later than that I can not promise anything.)

FLINT and PARI `ulong` mess...
I guess that `handle_error.pxd` pulls the PARI headers and `parisage.h` which undefs `ulong` and when `handle_error.pyx` is treated and pulls in `paripriv.h` which wants `ulong` we lose...
Not sure what the cleanest solution would be.
Maybe `#define pari_ulong` in `parisage.h` and define/undefine `ulong` in a custom `pariprivsage.h` which pulls `paripriv.h` in (just as `parisage.h` does for `pari.h`).
