Given a curve in affine space, find its projective closure. Conversely, given a projective curve, find its affine patches with respect to the standard affine coordinate charts.

This could be done more efficiently by using the projective_embedding/affine patches functionality for affine/projective subschemes. Currently the projective_embedding function for affine subschemes doesn't always have the right codomain:

```
A.<x,y,z> = AffineSpace(3,QQ)
X = A.subscheme([y-x^2,z-x^3])
X.projective_embedding().codomain()
```

so this should be addressed here, along with creating a projective_closure function for affine subschemes.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Replying to [comment:3 mmarco]:

Thanks for looking at this. I think it's not always the case that a given set of generators is sufficient for finding generators for the ideal of the projective closure. One example I have seen referenced in some texts is the twisted cubic in A3 defined by the ideal `(y-x^2, z-x^3)`. Its projective closure is `(x^2 − wy, xy − wz, y^2 − xz)`, but if the given generators of the first ideal are homogenized we get `(wy-x^2, zw<sup>2-x</sup>3)` instead.

A proof is given in the book ideals, varieties, algorithms that if the generators of a groebner basis (with respect to a graded monomial ordering) for the defining ideal of an affine variety are homogenized, then the result is a set of generators for the ideal of the projective closure, so I tried to emulate that here.

I'll work on getting some flexibility with the variable names.

<a id='comment:10'></a>re: variable names.

The way this is handled for general affine and projective subschemes is to allow the user to specify the space that it will be embedded into (or dehomogenized into). This is better functionality than just specifying the variable names, since you can then embedded different curves into the same space.

re: ambient space

```
A.<x,y,z> = AffineSpace(QQ,3)
C = Curve([y-x^2,z-x^3])
A == C.ambient_space()
```
I haven't looked at the code, but it looks like Curve assumes you are passing in elements from a polynomial ring and doesn't see if they are actually from a particular affine space and hence creates a new affine space. This is a bug. If you pass in elements of the coordinate ring of an affine space, then the curve should be in that space. It may be that you need to include an optional parameter for the space and/or perhaps have an A.curve() function.

one last thought: Should these curve classes inherit from affine and projective subscheme as well? This could save you a fair amount of code duplication (such as for affine_patch and projective_embedding.

`R.ideal([R(f) for f in self.defining_polynomials()])`
could be replaced with
`self.defining_ideal()`

- projective closure should take projective space parameter

```
A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(QQ, 2)
P.<u,v,w>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
C = Curve([y-x^2], A)
D=C.projective_closure(1,P)
```

- Affine patch should take affine space parameter

```
A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(QQ, 2)
P.<u,v,w>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
C = Curve([u^2-v^2], P)
C.affine_patch(1,A)
```

- Affine patch should have a default patch and that default should match up with the projective closure default

```
A.<x,y,z> = AffineSpace(GF(3), 3)
C = Curve([y-x^2,z-x^3], A)
D=C.projective_closure()
D.affine_patch()==C
