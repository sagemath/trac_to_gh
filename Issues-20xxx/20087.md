If `E` is an `Encoder` for a `LinearCode` `C`, one can use `E.encode(message)`, where `message` is in the appropriate space. `E(message)` should default to the same behaviour. So should `C(message)`.

Be aware that the category framework specifies that `C(c) = c` if `c in C`. This needs to be handled.

Indeed, I removed it.

Should it? IMHO, there's nothing elaborate to do for the encoder.

I think he meant if one tries to pass an element of the ambient space of the code which does not belong to the code. I added a check for that: as I cannot picture an encoder whose message space is the ambient space of the code, it makes sense to immediately reject vectors which are in the ambient space but not in the code, as it avoids calling `encode` and thus constructing an encoder for nothing.

You added it to GRS, not to Encoder...

Err yes, because `encode` is overridden in the polynomial encoder for GRS codes.
The alias is already added to `encoder.py`, and `E(m)` encodes `m` if possible.

Ouch, that's a super-nasty trap! All encoders written in the future will fall into this!

I vote for *not* defining `Encoder.__call__` as an alias, then, but instead rely on dynamic dispatch to avoid the trap:

```
    def __call__(self, m):
        return self.encode(m)
```
