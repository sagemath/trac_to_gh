This breaks:

```
sage: import re
sage: p = re.compile('(a)b')
sage: m = p.match('ab')
sage: m.group(0)
IndexError: no such group
```
The reason is that the `re` module does not handle Sage Integers:

```
sage: m.group(int(0))
'ab'
```

Are you really sure about that? I find that very hard to believe. It certainly doesn't work in Sage without the Python patch.

But it is more of a curiosity.
