CC:  @kcrisman @paulmasson

Basic offender:

```
html(plot(sin))
```
spits out TeX wrapped in `<script>`, can't work. Should probably be `<img>` with a data URI.

Related casualties are tables having plots as entries:

```
html(table([[1, plot(sin)]]))
```
is broken graphics and deprecation warnings.
