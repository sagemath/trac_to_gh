Not sure how to minimize the bloat, though, as each function should have doctests...

Note that total consistency is hard to get, as each backend has its own ideas on how, say, to number and order constraints. E.g., IIRC, gurobi does automatic conversions of some particular kinds of constraints.

<a id='comment:4'></a>It looks like you are. Any method that starts with `_test` gets run by `TestSuite`. Although I am not really in favor of any test mutating the object in question.

Also, is there a reason why `GenericBackend` needs to inherit from `SageObject` (as opposed to just the Python `object`)? I am pretty sure this is strictly needed...

`SageObject` provides some of the basic testing infrastructure, such as `._test_not_implemented_methods`.
Well, there's also `sage.misc.sage_unittest.PythonObjectWithTests`, but I can't seem to `cimport` it to make it a base class of `GenericBackend`. So I guess I'll stick with `SageObject`.

Just had a brief look at your TestSuite usage. This sounds very sensible indeed.

Inheriting from PythonObjectWithTests would indeed make sense; however since it's currently a plain Python class, one can't inherit from it in a Cython class. This could be fixed though.

I've translated these from existing doctests (either from `GenericBackend` or some real backend) by hand. `_test_solve` already reveals another bug in the CVXOPT backend. 
The plan is to use #20376 to semi-automatically add new `_test` methods.

As I pointed out in the comment above `_test_add_linear_constraints` in comment 13, these instance methods are written in a way that the order does not matter.

The second example uses a class method and runs its tests on fresh instances, so it does not make modifications.

If it is policy that `_test` methods cannot modify the object, then I can rewrite all tests as class methods like in the second example.

I would rather like to avoid using doctests (in fact I'm trying to replace the superficial, copy-paste-driven testing that is there now); and `TestSuite` seems like exactly the right thing to enforce the API of concrete implementations of an abstract class.

Thanks Nicolas, Vincent, and Travis for your comments. 

I agree, making changes to the object may be surprising to users who are in the habit of running the testsuite on objects.

I have now converted the `_test_*` methods that were previously making changes into methods that create a new instance. 
(This is in line with what Nicolas suggests.)

All `_test_*` methods are now actually marked as classmethods, so these methods don't even get access to the instance, so they can't modify it. Here's an example.

```
    @classmethod
    def _test_add_linear_constraints(cls, tester=None, **options):
        """
        Run tests on the method :meth:`.add_linear_constraints`.

        TEST::

            sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import GenericBackend
            sage: p = GenericBackend()
            sage: p._test_add_linear_constraints()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            NotImplementedError
        """
        p = cls()                         # fresh instance of the backend
        if tester is None:
            tester = p._tester(**options)
        nrows_before = p.nrows()
        nrows_added = 5
        p.add_linear_constraints(nrows_added, None, 2)
        nrows_after = p.nrows()
        # Test correct number of rows
        tester.assertEqual(nrows_after, nrows_before+nrows_added, "Added the wrong number of rows")
        # Test contents of the new rows are correct (sparse zero)
        for i in range(nrows_before, nrows_after):
            tester.assertEqual(p.row(i), ([], []))
            tester.assertEqual(p.row_bounds(i), (None, 2.0))
```

Some of you suggested that the tests should be in a different file; but I don't see how that would help. I would rather like to keep them as close as possible to the definitions of the methods in `GenericBackend`; after all the point of the new tests is to tighten the definition of the API of the backends. 

The nice thing about having these `_test_*` methods automatically inherited by all concrete backends is that they cannot just "forget" running the tests for them when it would be "convenient" to do so.

The idea is that all backends are checked against the same set of tests. (In contrast to the current doctests, in which each backend decides by copy-paste what is convenient to be tested.)
I plan to distill a good set of tests by means of #20376 from the existing doctests of the various backends.

I think now I understand better what you meant. 
Indeed, at least some instance `_test` methods -- such as the `_test` methods for `copy` that I just wrote -- would benefit from being invoked for various examples.
