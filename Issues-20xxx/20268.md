The following cause a memory leak

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', implementation='NTL')
sage: x = R.gen()
sage: p = x**2 - 1
sage: while True: a = p(1)
```

I propose to deal with this in #20192 instead.

In any case, if you want the fix to be applied, you need to increase the Cython version number.

```
sage: p = polygen(ZZ)

sage: mem0 = resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss

If not, do you have a better idea?
