The following cause a memory leak

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', implementation='NTL')
sage: x = R.gen()
sage: p = x**2 - 1
sage: while True: a = p(1)
```

I propose to deal with this in #20192 instead.

In any case, if you want the fix to be applied, you need to increase the Cython version number.

I would like to add a doctest for that. Do you think that the following is strong enough

```
sage: p = polygen(ZZ)
sage: import resource 
sage: mem0 = resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss 
sage: for _ in range(10000):
....:     t = Polynomial.__call__(p, 1)
sage: assert resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss < mem0 + 1000
```
If not, do you have a better idea?

Perhaps staying closer to python's own memory management routines and pick an example that produces stuff that is tracked by gc:

```
sage: import gc
sage: p=polygen(ZZ)
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: N=len(gc.get_objects())
sage: for _ in range(10000): t = Polynomial.__call__(p,p)
sage: assert len(gc.get_objects())-N < 1000
```
