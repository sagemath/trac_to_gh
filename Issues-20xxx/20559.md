This ticket adds `add_constraint` and `add_row` methods. 
Following the suggestion at 
http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18805#comment:27
these methods create new problems / dictionaries, leaving the original ones unmodified.

(Split out from the larger ticket #18805.)

No, no, it's crucial that `add_row` is supported by abstract dictionaries. 
The whole point is to have a method that adds a row to the dictionary, no matter how the dictionary is internally represented. This is the operation needed by tableau cutting plane procedures.
In the revised dictionary, one needs to do this kind of transformation to compute the new row of the problem, which gives the desired tableau row. (This is how tableau cutting planes are actually implemented in numerical solvers.)

"add_relation" wouldn't express the operation well; because we're not just adding a relation but also a new basic variable. 
I've never heard anyone call this operation other than "adding a row" (whether it's a textbook dictionary or a revised dictionary). 
Also note that "row" matches the method `row_coefficients`.

- I thought it is clear that if `new_` prefix is not great for one argument, it is not great for another ;-)
- There were still some data of problems not preserved, I think everything that can be preserved should be.
- `a number of the constant term for the new row`?..
- Explicit hard-coded ring `LPDictionary(matrix(QQ, A)`?!?!?!

<a id='comment:34'></a>With all due respect the old code for `add_row` for revised dictionaries was incomprehensible and extremely unnecessary complicated.

The current code will probably break on a dictionary for an auxiliary problem - is there any point in properly supporting these or there is never a need to add rows there and we can just throw an exception?

Documentation of `add_row` and `row_coefficients` needs some clarification with respect to signs (since I got confused and presumably some poor students may get as well). How about something like `These are the coefficients with which nonbasic variables are subtracted in the relation of this basic variable.` ?
