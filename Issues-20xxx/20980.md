This patch will add a function to get a pentagon sublattice, if it exists.

Interface part of this will be `certificate`-options to functions checking if a lattice is (semi)modular.

But what did I wrong? The patch seems to work, but Branch-field is red.

Ok, I've spent a bit of time convincing myself the math works out with the description, and I think it needs some clarification. 

Strictly speaking, what the description mentions corresponds to Birkhoff's condition for weak semimodularity. Just looking at the definition of semimodularity, it appears one only needs a pair of elements `a` and `b` so that `a` covers the meet and `b` is not covered by the join. It's only because weakly semimodular is equivalent to semimodular for finite lattices* that we can further require that `b` covers the meet and `a` is covered by the join.

*(technically lattices of finite length and upper continuous relatively atomic lattices...whatever that means)

Well, I don't know if it's really meaningful for tickets like this. I have just used to ask confirmation for even `wontfix`es, see #5964 as a trivial example.
