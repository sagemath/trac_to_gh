True, minimal certificate for non-semimodularity would be two elements. They can be extracted from this pentagon.

What about non-modular and non-distributive lattices? Should we return elements `(a, b, x)` violating definition of modularity, and same with distributivity?

After this we could think about best implementation. Maybe `is_distributive(certificate=True)` should first call `is_modular(certificate=True)` which could call `is_upper_semimodular()` and `is_lower(semimodular)`. But if a non-distributive lattice is modular, then `is_distributive()` runs it's own subprogram to find the three elements of `M_3` sublattice.
