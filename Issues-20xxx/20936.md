This adds the method sage_prodstring(), which is similar to sage_polystring, except that it is for properly converting the macaulay2 Product object to a string following python's math programming conventions, so that I could add conversion of Product objects from M2 in the to_sage() function

There were also additions to the to_sage() function. I added an elif statement for converting Product objects, and an elif for converting Divide objects from M2 to Sage. Both of their outputs are as strings. 

**Keywords:** Macaulay2, interface

I don't understand why rationals like that have cls_str == "Divide", instead of having cls_str == "QQ"... The numerator and denomenator don't have properly defined repr_str's. Should I simply make run a search for a variable if it has cls_Str == "Divide", to differentiate between rational polynomials and rational numbers?

<a id='comment:22'>**Comment 22:**</a>
of course a rational function need not be a polynomial. Here is an example:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=GF(5)[]
sage: x^2/y
x^2/y
sage: type(x^2/y)
<type 'sage.rings.fraction_field_element.FractionFieldElement'>
sage: R.fraction_field()
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field of size 5
sage: x^2 in R.fraction_field()
True
sage: x^2/y in R.fraction_field()
True
sage: x^2/y in R
False
```

so you get two polynomials p and q from M2, numerator and denominator of a Divide object, p/q, construct in Sage a polynomial ring R containing p and q, and then p/q is an element of R.fractional_field(). This is the plan.
