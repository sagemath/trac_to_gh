I personally don't think the fix you submitted upstream is any good. You are probably configuring with `-I${some_prefix}/flint/flintxx` when you should use `-I${some_prefix}/flint -I${some_prefix}/flint/flintxx`.

Possibly, depending on your includes it should have been `#include "flint/flint.h"` rather than `#include "../flint.h"`. That fells more correct to me.

It is a complete mystery to me how you get the idea that I submitted anything upstream. I merely reported the issue at https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/issues/217. Consequently your remarks should be added there.
