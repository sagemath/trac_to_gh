Converting a sparse matrix to a dense one should be an easy operation: create the zero matrix and then populate a few entries. But behold:

```
sage: time S = CremonaModularSymbols(400001, sign=+1)
CPU times: user 15 s, sys: 36 ms, total: 15 s
Wall time: 15 s
sage: time T2 = S.hecke_matrix(2) # This matrix has <= 3 nonzero entries per row
CPU times: user 11.6 s, sys: 4.19 s, total: 15.8 s
Wall time: 15.8 s
sage: time sT2 = T2.sage_matrix_over_ZZ()
CPU times: user 1.56 s, sys: 1e+03 Âµs, total: 1.56 s
Wall time: 1.56 s
sage: time sT2F2 = sT2.change_ring(GF(2))
sage: time sT2F2 = sT2.change_ring(GF(2))
CPU times: user 979 ms, sys: 8 ms, total: 987 ms
Wall time: 987 ms
sage: sT2F2
38098 x 38098 sparse matrix over Finite Field of size 2 (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: M2 = MatrixSpace(GF(2), 38098, sparse=False)
sage: time sT2F2a = M2(sT2F2) #unspeakably slow!
CPU times: user 19min 43s, sys: 47.2 s, total: 20min 30s
Wall time: 20min 31s
```
Presumably this is an artifact of the constructor, as internal operations are much faster:

```
sage: time sT2F2a.rank()
CPU times: user 14.4 s, sys: 63 ms, total: 14.5 s
Wall time: 14.5 s
38098
```
By contrast, staying in the sparse realm has a price which I think is at most only partly related (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/l1O82XMC0zo for another contributing factor):

```
sage: time sT2F2.rank()
CPU times: user 24min 54s, sys: 544 ms, total: 24min 55s
Wall time: 24min 56s
38098
```

That is indeed much faster:

```
sage: time sT2F2b = sT2F2.dense_matrix()
CPU times: user 318 ms, sys: 47 ms, total: 365 ms
Wall time: 365 ms
sage: sT2F2a == sT2F2b
True
```

I guess that means this is easy to fix: the constructor for dense matrices (over any base), upon receiving a sparse matrix as input, should simply call the `dense_matrix()` method.

I think the culprit is the `matrix` method for the `MatrixSpace` class: when you do `M2(...)`, it runs the `__call__` method, which does this:

```
        return self.matrix(entries, coerce, copy)
```
Then the `matrix` method does this, if the input `x` is a matrix with the right size:

```
x = x.list()  # this is the slow part
...
x = list_to_dict(x, m, n)
```
So it should instead call `dense_matrix`.
