In #20545 `sage_autodoc.py` has been made a little bit closer to `sphinx` original `autodoc.py` this included this piece of code

```
try:
    import typing
except ImportError:
    typing = None
```
Importing `typing` in python2 will cause failure due to the lack of `kwonlyargcount` in that version of python as reported upstream in [https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/2470](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/2470). Upstream has a fix and we should use it.
