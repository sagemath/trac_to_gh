Thank you for your work on adding the pictures and improving the documentation.

While it is good to be PEP8 compliant, strictly enforcing it can make things less readable, especially for someone who it looking at the doc on the webpages. In particular, when you move one argument to a second line when it only goes over 80 characters by a little bit makes it more difficult on the user (in particular, the new user/student). For example:

```diff
+        sage: contour_plot(f, (0, pi),
+        ....:              (0, pi)).show(axes=True) # These are equivalent
```

```diff
-        sage: contour_plot(x**2-y**2, (x,-2, 2), (y,-2, 2),region=x-y,plot_points=300)
+        sage: contour_plot(x**2-y**2, (x,-2, 2), (y,-2, 2), region=x - y,
+        ....:              plot_points=300)
```

```diff
-        sage: implicit_plot(mandel(7), (-0.3, 0.05), (-1.15, -0.9),plot_points=50)
+        sage: implicit_plot(mandel(7), (-0.3, 0.05), (-1.15, -0.9),
+        ....:               plot_points=50)
```

```diff
-        sage: region_plot([x^2+y^2<1, x<y], (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2), plot_points=400)
+        sage: region_plot([x^2+y^2<1, x<y], (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2),
+        ....:             plot_points=400)
```

```diff
-        sage: region_plot(lambda x,y: x^2+y^2<1 or x<y, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2), plot_points=400)
+        sage: region_plot(lambda x,y: x^2+y^2<1 or x<y, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2),
+        ....:             plot_points=400)
```

```diff
-        sage: region_plot([y>0, x>0, x^2+y^2<1], (x,-1.1, 1.1), (y,-1.1, 1.1), plot_points = 400)
+        sage: region_plot([y>0, x>0, x^2+y^2<1], (x,-1.1, 1.1), (y,-1.1, 1.1),
+        ....:             plot_points = 400)
```

This same philosophy applies to the code itself. Also, you should revert the change to the copyright header. All of these comments apply to the other plotting tickets.

Your alignment is off on these changes:

```diff
-        sage: region_plot(sin(x)*sin(y) >= 1/4, (x,-10,10), (y,-10,10), incol='yellow', bordercol='black', borderstyle='dashed', plot_points=250)
+        sage: region_plot(sin(x)*sin(y) >= 1/4, (x,-10,10), (y,-10,10),
+        ....:            incol='yellow', bordercol='black',
+        ....:            borderstyle='dashed', plot_points=250)
```

```diff
-        sage: P=contour_plot(y^2 + 1 - x^3 - x, (x,-pi,pi), (y,-pi,pi), \
-        ...    fill=False, cmap='hsv', labels=True, label_inline_spacing=1)
+        sage: P = contour_plot(y^2 + 1 - x^3 - x, (x, -pi, pi), (y, -pi, pi),
+        ....:                fill=False, cmap='hsv', labels=True,
+        ....:                label_inline_spacing=1)
```

Since PEP8 is about appearance of code and not meaning, I wouldn't worry about that. For the specific example you ask, I would close the white space both in the tuple and in the xsrange.

When I recommended have a space between arguments of functions, I should have been more specific and said that should apply to the right-hand side with many arguments. I see you changed `f(x,y)` to `f(x, y)` consistently on left-hand sides, but if it's not too much trouble I would ask you to change that back by omitting the space.

You've gotten most of the other things I saw, except there are three cases where `),plot_points` should be `), plot_points` and two cases where `),fill` should be `), fill`.

Also, the one plot with

```
contour_plot(x^2-y^3+10*sin(x*y),
+        ....:              (x,-4,4),
+        ....:              (y,-4,4),
+        ....:              plot_points=121, cmap='hsv')
```

would look better

```
contour_plot(x^2-y^3+10*sin(x*y), (x,-4,4), (y,-4,4),
+        ....:              plot_points=121, cmap='hsv')

```

With those changes I'll stop being so picky! Thanks for the patience.
