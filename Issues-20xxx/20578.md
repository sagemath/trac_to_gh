`print("")` seems unnecessary, as `print()` would be enought. Line

```
B = A.quotient(y^2 + y + 1, 'y2'); print(B)
```

could be just

```
B = A.quotient(y^2 + y + 1, 'y2'); B
```

and same in two other places in `polynomial_quotient_ring.py` and once in `polynomial_ring.py`.

But these are minor things, so feel free to either modify them or just put this to *positive_review* behalf of me.
