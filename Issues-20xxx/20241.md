<a id='comment:2'></a>I'm pushing a failed attempt at splitting `PariInstance` into a generic `PariInstance` cython type, and a Sage-specific `SagePariInstance`.

This is problematic because of the global `sage.libs.pari.pari_instance.pari` variable: it is not clear where this variable should go.

Some concrete suggestions: `PariInstance` serves three main purposes:

- As a wrapper around the pari stack,
- As a collection of conversion methods to and from pari types,
- As a namespace for a handful of functions, for lack of a better place (e.g. `primes`, `genus2_reduction`, ...)

Of these, only the first one really needs a Cython type. I suggest:

- To make a proper abstraction `PariStack` around the pari stack. This should not be handled as a global variable, but rather as a singleton class (we cannot have more than one pari stack, because of global variables).
- Move conversion functions to a separate namespace, as #20226 started doing.
- Have `PariInstance` hold a pointer to a `PariStack`. Have `gen`'s hold a pointer to a `PariInstance`. (Maybe this double wrapping is superfluous?)

I don't know quite well what to do with utility functions such as `primes`. They may stay as methods of `PariInstance`, or maybe go to a different namespace as pure functions (they should take a `PariInstance` or `PariStack` as parameter, then).

You have to understand how the compiler works: the compiler for a different module only sees the `.pxd` file, so it cannot possibly inline the function `new_gen` since it doesn't know what `new_gen` does.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Ok, fixed the startup bug, and tests (mostly) pass. Next step is to move all those conversion functions out of the way.

I'm scratching my head about `allocatemem` and companions, though. `allocatemem` is a gp function, but it's tied to `gen` by `auto_gen.pxi`, so that you can do

```
sage: size = pari('10^8')
sage: size.allocatemem()
```

which feels very bad. Wouldn't it make sense to blacklist this one?

On the other hand there is a manually coded `allocatemem` method in `PariInstance` which gives a much more sensible

```
sage: pari.allocatemem(10^8)
```

and also has an additional `silent` parameter to behave more like gp. There are also methods `stacksize` and `stacksizemax` to read the stack sizes. It seems more logical to put these three functions in `stack.pyx`, but if we want the user to call them from the command line, it is better to leave methods in `PariInstance`.

Question: given the current handling of PARI's stack, do we still want the user to easily call these functions?

<a id='comment:25'></a>Ok, so I managed to move all Sage-specific conversion functions from `PariInstance` to a separate file. We're getting closer to the goal: the only imports left in `pari_instance.p??` from the sage library are

```
from sage.ext.memory import init_memory_functions
from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation, deprecated_function_alias
```

There's a couple of conversion functions left in `PariInstance` which are not specific to Sage:

```
cdef gen new_gen_from_int(self, int value)
cdef gen new_t_POL_from_int_star(self, int *vals, int length, long varnum)
cdef gen double_to_gen_c(self, double)
cdef GEN double_to_GEN(self, double)
```

plus a python method `PariInstance.double_to_gen`. Should we put these in `convert.pyx`, or maybe another file?

Note that `new_gen_from_int` is only called once in `padic_capped_relative_element.pyx`, and just to create 0.

It is also not very clear to me what the purpose of `double_to_gen` and `double_to_gen_c` is. `double_to_gen_c` is called only in line 1585 of `real_double.pyx`, and that's in a `def`ed function. Is this really faster than calling `double_to_gen`?

And what's the meaning of this, anyway:

```
sage: pari(0.1) == pari.double_to_gen(0.1)
False
sage: pari(0.1) == pari(0.1)
True
sage: pari.double_to_gen(0.1) == pari.double_to_gen(0.1)

`double_to_gen` seems unused and untested. I do not mind removing it.

That's a "feature" because of `RealLiteral`:

```
sage: x = RR(0.1); y = RR(float(0.1))
sage: x == y
True
sage: parent(x) is parent(y)
True
sage: RR64 = RealField(64)
sage: RR64(x) == RR64(y)
False
sage: pari(x) == pari(y)
False
```

Good. Thx.

If they where in CyPari, then CyPari would need GMP/Flint in order to compile, wouldn't it?

It's not exactly that. I consider the Cython API also public (unless there are underscores). But when there is duplication of functionality (e.g., any `def`ed or `cpdef`ed method of `pari_instance`), I give priority to the Python API.

I mean, if all you want is to get PARI's zero, just do like any common mortal and call `pari.zero()`. Shorter, more readable, easier to understand.

Of course, it's not a big deal.

I haven't profiled, but I would guess at least an order of magnitude. Python methods are slow.

But that doesn't matter, the point is that `pari_instance` and the `zero()` method are part of the public Cython API.

I have. The overhead is ~50ns. `pari_instance.zero()` itself takes ~50ns.

As you say. Who cares about 50ns? So we agree that speed is not an argument here. In my opinion readability is, instead.

I already replied to this point saying that `pari.zero()` is "more public". You haven't given an explanation of why my point is not good, other than `pari_instance.zero()` is "public enough".

I do not want to hold this ticket on this very minor detail. If we cannot convince each other, commit minimality wins, so the code stays as it is now.

My other two comments are more serious, though.

Could you be convinced by

Ok, this addresses one of my concerns. But I'm curious: what's the rationale behind writing

```
def ...(self, ...):
    cdef PariInstance pari_instance = <PariInstance>self
```

instead of simply writing

```
def ...(pari_instance, ...):
```

The only reason is the usual convention that the "self" argument of a method should be called `self`.

And ideally, maybe we can get rid of the `pari_instance.get_series_precision()` call to avoid the `pari_instance` argument completely.
