As discussed in Sage Days 71, I tried to implement this method using the construction functor but it seems that the latter is only defined for Zp or Qp but not for extensions.
So, what should I do? Implement the methods `construction` as well? Something else?

Implementing `construction` is a good idea anyway, since they're used in coercion.  And until we change extensions to be defined by exact polynomials, you'll need to raise the precision of the base ring as well, so it's probably necessary.

I'm a bit sceptical about the possibility of changing `p` (and even `q`). Can you show me a situation where this can be needed?

Adding `show_prec` is nice but is it really the subject of this ticket?

Doctests implying the keyword `base` are missing. The same is true for `show_prec`. More generally, I suggest to add many more doctests ensuring that your code works in a wide range of situations (for ramified, unramified extensions, for extensions constructing via `CompletionFunction` and `AlgebraicExtensionFunctor`, etc.)

Well, I'm still not that convinced by changing `p`. You say that "it is mostly interesting in general extensions where you want to see how a certain polynomial behaves wrt to different primes" but I guess that the modulus is just stored modulo `p^prec`, so converting it in others `Z_p`'s may lead to very unexpected behaviours, no?
I nevertheless agree that changing `q` (keeping the same `p`) makes more sense.

Anyway, changing `p` actually does not work in many cases:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^3)
sage: R.change(p=7)
...
NotImplementedError: conversion between padic extensions not implemented
```

For ramified extensions, something very stange happens:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zp(5).extension(x^3 + 5)
sage: R
Eisenstein Extension of 5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by  (1 + O(5^20))*x^3 + (O(5^21))*x^2 + (O(5^21))*x + (5 + O(5^21))

sage: S = R.change(p=7)
sage: S
Unramified Extension of 7-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(5^20))*x^3 + (O(5^20))*x^2 + (O(5^20))*x + (5 + O(5^20))
```

Look at the modulus, it is still written with some `O(5^20)`'s (whereas we are supposed to be on a 7-adic ring). Even more stranger:

```
sage: c = S.modulus()[0]; c
5 + O(5^20)
sage: c.parent()
7-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20

sage: c.parent() is Zp(7)
False
```

As a conclusion, I would be in favour to remove this feature.

Other issues with the change of precision:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^3)
sage: S = R.change(prec=50)
sage: S
Unramified Extension of 5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 50 in a defined by (1 + O(5^20))*x^3 + (O(5^20))*x^2 + (3 + O(5^20))*x + (3 + O(5^20))
```

The defining polynomial has not been lifted to precision 50.

In fact, it seems that we cannot compute at all at precision 50 is `S`:

```
sage: S.gen()
a + O(5^20)
sage: S.precision_cap()
20
```

For ramified extensions, the precision on the modulus decreases:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zp(5).extension(x^3 + 5)
sage: R
Eisenstein Extension of 5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(5^20))*x^3 + (O(5^21))*x^2 + (O(5^21))*x + (5 + O(5^21))
sage: S = R.change(prec=50)
sage: S
Eisenstein Extension of 5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(5^18))*x^3 + (O(5^18))*x^2 + (O(5^18))*x + (5 + O(5^18))
```

but (unexpectedly) computations in `S` seem to be fine.

Not a complete review, but I noticed the following:

In the doctest of the method `change`, some items are introduced by `--` instead of `-`.

When creating an unramified extension, we cannot specify the variable name using the keyword `unram_name`:

```
sage: R = Zp(5)
sage: R.change(q=25, unram_name='a')
...
TypeError: You must specify the name of the generator

sage: R2.<a> = Zq(5^2)
sage: R2.change(q=125,unram_name='b')
Unramified Extension of 5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(5^20))*x^3 + (O(5^20))*x^2 + (3 + O(5^20))*x + (3 + O(5^20))
```

(Note nevertheless than using `names` instead of `unram_name` works fine.)

I am a bit lost with exact VS inexact defining polynomials. For instance:

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R.change(p=11)
Unramified Extension of 11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(11^20))*x^2 + (2 + O(11^20))*x + (4 + O(11^20))

sage: ZX.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R.change(p=11)
...
NotImplementedError: conversion between padic extensions not implemented
```

By the way, even when the defining polynomial is exact, the methods `modulus` and `defining_polynomial` return an inexact polynomial. Is there a method that returns the exact defining polynomial (i.e. the content of the attribute `_pre_poly` as far as I understand)?

I get that both of these work.  It's possible that your cache has been poisoned by trying to first create R using a p-adic modulus, and then later with a modulus over Z?  This is the kind of thing that might be alleviated by #23331.

> By the way, even when the defining polynomial is exact, the methods `modulus` and `defining_polynomial` return an inexact polynomial. Is there a method that returns the exact defining polynomial (i.e. the content of the attribute `_pre_poly` as far as I understand)?

I don't think there's currently a method to get `_pre_poly`. I would suggest holding off on that change until #23331.

> I get that both of these work. It's possible that your cache has been poisoned by trying to first create R using a p-adic modulus, and then later with a modulus over Z? This is the kind of thing that might be alleviated by #23331. 

Good point. With a fresh session of sage, I have:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R.change(p=11)
Unramified Extension of 11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(11^20))*x^2 + (2 + O(11^20))*x + (4 + O(11^20))
sage: 
sage: ZX.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R.change(p=11)
Unramified Extension of 11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(11^20))*x^2 + (2 + O(11^20))*x + (4 + O(11^20))
```

but:

```
sage: ZpX.<x> = Zp(5)[]
sage: R1.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R1.change(p=11)
...
NotImplementedError: conversion between padic extensions not implemented

sage: ZX.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R2.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R2.change(p=11)
...
NotImplementedError: conversion between padic extensions not implemented
```

and conversely:

```
sage: ZX.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R2.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R2.change(p=11)
Unramified Extension of 11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(11^20))*x^2 + (2 + O(11^20))*x + (4 + O(11^20))

sage: ZpX.<x> = Zp(5)[]
sage: R1.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R1.change(p=11)
Unramified Extension of 11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(11^20))*x^2 + (2 + O(11^20))*x + (4 + O(11^20))
```

I guess that the problem comes from the factory because, in the above examples, `R1` is the same as `R2` (i.e. `R1 is R2` answers `True`).

I don't see how this is related to this ticket really. This is just a bug in the factory that has always been there. The same problem at least happens on a stable sage

```
sage: ZpX.<x> = Zp(5)[]
sage: R1.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: ZX.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R2.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R1 is R2
True
```

I guess my point is that you could use this to construct problems with many methods in Sage. I do not see why we should have `change()` be blocked by this now. (We should of course fix this, neverthelessâ¦)
