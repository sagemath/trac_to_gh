<a id='comment:1'></a>As discussed in Sage Days 71, I tried to implement this method using the construction functor but it seems that the latter is only defined for Zp or Qp but not for extensions.
So, what should I do? Implement the methods `construction` as well? Something else?

Adding `show_prec` is nice but is it really the subject of this ticket?

Doctests implying the keyword `base` are missing. The same is true for `show_prec`.

<a id='comment:20'></a>By the way, I guess that your changes is not compatible with ticket #22103. 

It's of course not that annoying (and, as I've already said, I'm fine with adding the keyword `show_prec`) but maybe we could have a discussion about the "right way" to print p-adic numbers.

<a id='comment:23'></a>Well, I'm still not that convinced by changing `p`. You say that "it is mostly interesting in general extensions where you want to see how a certain polynomial behaves wrt to different primes" but I guess that the modulus is just stored modulo `p^prec`, so converting it in others `Z_p`'s may lead to very unexpected behaviours, no?
I nevertheless agree that changing `q` (keeping the same `p`) makes more sense.

Anyway, changing `p` actually does not work in many cases:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^3)
sage: R.change(p=7)
...
NotImplementedError: conversion between padic extensions not implemented
```

For ramified extensions, something very stange happens:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zp(5).extension(x^3 + 5)
sage: R
Eisenstein Extension of 5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by  (1 + O(5^20))*x^3 + (O(5^21))*x^2 + (O(5^21))*x + (5 + O(5^21))

sage: S = R.change(p=7)
sage: S
Unramified Extension of 7-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(5^20))*x^3 + (O(5^20))*x^2 + (O(5^20))*x + (5 + O(5^20))
```

Look at the modulus, it is still written with some `O(5^20)`'s (whereas we are supposed to be on a 7-adic ring). Even more stranger:

```
sage: c = S.modulus()[0]; c
5 + O(5^20)
sage: c.parent()
7-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20

sage: c.parent() is Zp(7)
False
```

As a conclusion, I would be in favour to remove this feature.

<a id='comment:24'></a>Other issues with the change of precision:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^3)
sage: S = R.change(prec=50)
sage: S
Unramified Extension of 5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 50 in a defined by (1 + O(5^20))*x^3 + (O(5^20))*x^2 + (3 + O(5^20))*x + (3 + O(5^20))
```

The defining polynomial has not been lifted to precision 50.

In fact, it seems that we cannot compute at all at precision 50 is `S`:

```
sage: S.gen()
a + O(5^20)
sage: S.precision_cap()
20
```

For ramified extensions, the precision on the modulus decreases:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zp(5).extension(x^3 + 5)
sage: R
Eisenstein Extension of 5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(5^20))*x^3 + (O(5^21))*x^2 + (O(5^21))*x + (5 + O(5^21))

```

but (unexpectedly) computations in `S` seem to be fine.

<a id='comment:32'></a>Not a complete review, but I noticed the following:

In the doctest of the method `change`, some items are introduced by `--` instead of `-`.

When creating an unramified extension, we cannot specify the variable name using the keyword `unram_name`:

```
sage: R = Zp(5)
sage: R.change(q=25, unram_name='a')
...
TypeError: You must specify the name of the generator

sage: R2.<a> = Zq(5^2)

```

(Note nevertheless than using `names` instead of `unram_name` works fine.)

I am a bit lost with exact VS inexact defining polynomials. For instance:

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R.change(p=11)
Unramified Extension of 11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(11^20))*x^2 + (2 + O(11^20))*x + (4 + O(11^20))

sage: ZX.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R.change(p=11)
...
NotImplementedError: conversion between padic extensions not implemented
```

By the way, even when the defining polynomial is exact, the methods `modulus` and `defining_polynomial` return an inexact polynomial. Is there a method that returns the exact defining polynomial (i.e. the content of the attribute `_pre_poly` as far as I understand)?

I get that both of these work.  It's possible that your cache has been poisoned by trying to first create R using a p-adic modulus, and then later with a modulus over Z?  This is the kind of thing that might be alleviated by #23331.

> By the way, even when the defining polynomial is exact, the methods `modulus` and `defining_polynomial` return an inexact polynomial. Is there a method that returns the exact defining polynomial (i.e. the content of the attribute `_pre_poly` as far as I understand)?


I don't think there's currently a method to get `_pre_poly`. I would suggest holding off on that change until #23331.

Good point. With a fresh session of sage, I have:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R.change(p=11)
Unramified Extension of 11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(11^20))*x^2 + (2 + O(11^20))*x + (4 + O(11^20))
sage: 
sage: ZX.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R.change(p=11)
Unramified Extension of 11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(11^20))*x^2 + (2 + O(11^20))*x + (4 + O(11^20))
```

but:

```
sage: ZpX.<x> = Zp(5)[]
sage: R1.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R1.change(p=11)
...
NotImplementedError: conversion between padic extensions not implemented

sage: ZX.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R2.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R2.change(p=11)
...
NotImplementedError: conversion between padic extensions not implemented
```

and conversely:

```
sage: ZX.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R2.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R2.change(p=11)
Unramified Extension of 11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(11^20))*x^2 + (2 + O(11^20))*x + (4 + O(11^20))

sage: ZpX.<x> = Zp(5)[]
sage: R1.<a> = Zq(5^2, modulus=x^2+2*x+4)
sage: R1.change(p=11)
Unramified Extension of 11-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20 in a defined by (1 + O(11^20))*x^2 + (2 + O(11^20))*x + (4 + O(11^20))
```

I guess that the problem comes from the factory because, in the above examples, `R1` is the same as `R2` (i.e. `R1 is R2` answers `True`).
