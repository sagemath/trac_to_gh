The `Unknown` class currently evaluates to `False` when converted to a boolean. This also leads to wrong results when using the logical operators, as explained in `unknown.py`:

```
         ..warning:: Unless PEP 335 is accepted, in the following cases,
         ``and``, ``not`` and ``or`` return a somewhat wrong value::

             sage: not Unknown         # should return Unknown
             True
```

This ticket makes evaluating the truth value of `Unknown` with `__nonzero__` an error, meaning that logical operations must be done only with the bitwise operators (since the logical operators cannot be overridden). It also adapts the `UnknownClass` to add support for an `Undecidable` object, which is similar to `Unknown` but intended specifically for cases when an answer is known to be formally undecidable. This is useful for #17700.

Adding a preliminary patch. Some tests fail in `orthogonal_arrays.py` and `difference_family.py` due to #20919.

I changed many instances of code like:

```
if orthogonal_array(k, n, existence=True):
...
```

to

```
if orthogonal_array(k, n, existence=True) == True:
...
```

since the former fails with the new `Unknown` implementation.

What is the point of an `Undecidable` class? To my mind this is completely useless.

- either you have an algorithm that works sometimes (because the problem is undecidable). If an instance of this algorithm fails, then you should raise an error or possibly returns `Unknown`.
- or you have no algorithm for a given problem and it makes no sense to write an empty Python function for that.

`Undeciable` indicates that there is a stronger statement being made, e.g., trying to determine if two finitely presented groups are isomorphic, whereas `Unknown` simply says the algorithm (currently) cannot determine a solution.

Suggestion for the implementation, did you consider using `misc.fast_methods.Singleton`, and having two classes (with a common base class). (More of a technical note, you cannot inherit `Singleton` in the base class, just the "final" class.)

Let me try to make clearer my point. When you ask the question `are_isomorphic(G1, G2)` this has an answer: either `True` or `False`. As you said, despite the 1001 heuristics implemented, it might be that the algorithm you have does not have anything relevant to say. However, returning `Undecidable` is a complete nonsense. The problem `are_isomorphic` (**without parameters**) is undecidable but the instance `are_isomorphic(G1, G2)` is always decidable.
