Hi,

I think you mixed codeword and code in your script. Both `decode_to_code` and `decode_to_message` are methods of the code's class. So the good syntax is:

```python
sage: C.decode_to_code(c) == c
sage: C.decode_to_message(c) == msg
```

Hi again,

My mistake, I didn't run the most recent version of Sage. Your typo fooled me, but you're completely right, there's indeed an issue with these methods.

Hello,

Just a few remarks:

- when you push a fix on a ticket, don't forget to change its state to `needs_review`
- you can also put your (full) name on the `Authors` field
- and when it's a bug fix, you can add a new doctest which shows the bug has been fixed, e.g.


```
EXAMPLES:

The bug detailed in trac #20340 has been fixed::

    sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(59).list()[:40], 12)
    sage: c = C.random_element()
    sage: D = C.decoder("BerlekampWelch")
    sage: D.decode_to_code(c) == c
    True
```

Otherwise, it seems all good to me!

Best,

David

Hello,

I copied your doctest in every method which was previously impacted by the bug.
If you agree with my changes, set it to `positive_review`, on my side, I'm fine with your fix.
