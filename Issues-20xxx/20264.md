We add a new method to compute the zeta function of a cyclic cover of `P^1`, this is the result of a forthcoming paper generalizing the work of Kedlaya, Harvey, Minzlaff and Gonçalves. 
In particular, we add two classes for cyclic covers, one over a generic ring and a specialized one over finite fields. 
This requires wrapping David Harvey's code for computing products of matrices already in Sage but not accessible to Sage, see #25366

Here is a quick example:

```
sage: p = 4999;
sage: x = PolynomialRing(GF(p),"x").gen();
sage: C = CyclicCover(5, x^5 + 1)
sage: C
Cyclic Cover of P^1 over Finite Field of size 4999 defined by y^5 = x^5 + 1
sage: C.frobenius_polynomial()
x^12 + 29994*x^10 + 374850015*x^8 + 2498500299980*x^6 + 9367502249700015*x^4 + 18731257498500149994*x^2 + 15606259372500374970001

sage: %time CyclicCover(11, PolynomialRing(GF(1129), 'x')([-1] + [0]*(5-1) + [1])).frobenius_polynomial()
CPU times: user 16.1 s, sys: 124 ms, total: 16.3 s
Wall time: 16.5 s

```
So the discrepancy is in the `t^20` coefficient -- Minzlaff's code says it is

```
20187877911930897108199045855206 = 6 * 1129^10
```
while the current code says it is

```
3818873571673594702967652840943135 = 6 * 1129^10 + 1129^11.
```
the difference is exactly 1129^11. So it does look like some kind of precision error...

My bet is that error is either in working precision or the code to lift characteristic polynomial to ZZ


Another bug, that seems to be related with precision when using the slow method

It looks like the frobenius polynomial for GF(1009) is correct, but it is not correct for `GF(1009**2)`. Comparing with Minzlaff's code, the right frobenius polynomial for `GF(1009**2)` should be 

```
x^8 + 532*x^7 - 2877542*x^6 - 242628176*x^5 + 4390163797795*x^4 - 247015136050256*x^3 - 2982540407204025062*x^2 + 561382189105547134612*x + 1074309286591662654798721

Most of these are fine and I am happy to do, but I wonder if you know an automatic tool to fix these things, if not perhaps we should make one, it would save time fixing annoying single character changes.
As for ` k %2 ` I don't know why I would do that, to save keystrokes? It makes it less readable IMO and doesn't seem to have benefit.

As for the change to `src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hypellfrob.pyx` I'm not sure how that appeared there, maybe a merge issue, if they don't break anything I'll remove them I suppose.

<a id='comment:32'></a>Not so amused by your commit titles, sorry to say. Your code has to meet Sage's standards, that's just the way it goes. I am really trying to help.

More fixes:

* Typo "instegral"

* Is there some reference article, either as preprint or published ? If yes, should be added.

* One spurious empty line here

```
+        r"""
+
+        Return if this curve is singular or not.
```

* INPUT: and OUTPUT: must be followed by empty lines

* Typo in the sentence `Return the polynomial of defining the cyclic cover.` : remove "of"

* Remain some traces of copy-paste:

```
Return this HyperellipticCurve over a new base ring R.
```
and

```
String representation of hyperelliptic curves.

* you should probably use the existing "is_squarefree" method of polynomials and not re-invent it in "check_squarefree":

```

sage: g.is_squarefree()

sage: x = polygen(QQ)
sage: g=(x-1)^2
sage: g.is_squarefree()
False
sage: x = polygen(Qp(5))
sage: g = x^2 + 5
sage: g.is_squarefree()
True
sage: x = polygen(GF(2))
sage: g = x^2 + x + 1
sage: g.is_squarefree()
True

<a id='comment:35'></a>> Not so amused by your commit titles, sorry to say. Your code has to meet Sage's standards, that's just the way it goes. I am really trying to help.

Sorry that's more me being lazy than making a point! I appreciate the comments.

<a id='comment:37'></a>Thanks for your comments.

ok. That would be slightly faster.

> * Is there some reference article, either as preprint or published ? If yes, should be added. 


as the answer is yes, and I need to figure out how to add the reference properly.

The reference itself should be added in the master reference file:

src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst

and called in your files somewhere using the usual syntax `[Who2019]_ `

* long tests
How do we determine what is long?

using

```
./sage -bt --long --warn-long src/sage/schemes/cyclic_covers/
```

Well, your machine may be too quick. Mine is slow. I will launch this command and report.

I also have an honest question, do you know the reason for not using the 3rd person in the documentation, e.g., return instead of returns? I know it is pep8 stuff, but I am confused about how should I be reading docstrings for this to make sense grammatically, as I always read them as the function F does something...

This is not pep8 stuff, but sage's own decision. The first line of the documentation is supposed to be in imperative mode (like when giving an order) as explained here:

```
the first sentence should be followed by an empty line.

* In this sentence

```
+    - ``charpoly_prec`` -- a vector ai, such that, `frob_matrix.change_ring(ZZ).charpoly()[i]`

```

by

```
from sage.schemes.curves.affine_curve import AffinePlaneCurve

and then use that directly

* In src/sage/schemes/cyclic_covers/charpoly_frobenius.py, there are many divisions by 2. I would suggest to add `from __future__ import division` in order to make sure that the python3  behaviour will remain the same.

* do not use range(0, something) but range(something)

* still an empty line to be removed here:
