In this example, both schemes are empty, so they should be equal as subschemes of P^2. However...

```
sage: P2.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(2, QQ)
sage: P2.subscheme([x,y^2,z]) == P2.subscheme([x,y,z])
False
```
While I'm at it, an `is_empty` method would be nice. It could be defined as follows:

```
def self.is_empty():
   return (len(self.irreducible_components() == 0)
```

Depends on #21297

Keywords: **schemes, empty**

Projective scheme comparison should compare ideals saturated with respect to the irrelevant ideal:

```
sage: U=P2.subscheme([x,y,z])
sage: V=P2.subscheme([x,y^2,z])
sage: J=U.defining_ideal()
sage: U.defining_ideal().saturation(J)[0] == V.defining_ideal().saturation(J)[0] 
True
```

Similarly, the `is_empty` should do:

```
sage: one_ideal= J^0 #just get the ideal generated by 1
sage: U.defining_ideal().saturation(J)[0] == one_ideal
```
decomposing in irreducible components is a more expensive operation.

Agreed. I guess we don't want to transform the generating set at creation, so we can recover the generators as specified, but maybe we want to cache the saturation?

Agreed again.

It might be that dealing with hashing will help with this. But hashing ideals itself need to be fixed; see #21297 (which itself has dependencies on hashing for polynomials).
