Some doctests in grs.py are quite unhelpful, and some classes description do not explain at all how
the class works (especially for the encoders).

This ticket fixes that.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi David,

typos:

- scalaers

remarks and suggestions:

- `minimum_distance` the new doc string is less clear than previous one. The notion of minimum distance is clear in coding theory, no need to be explicit. If you really want to explicit it, change the sentence of the new docstring to `Returns the minimum distance between any two words in ``self``.`

- `column_multipliers`, `parity_column_multipliers`:  the new doc strings speaks about positions scalars, while these methods deal with multipliers.

- `weight_enumerator`: it would be better to say "the polynomial whose coefficient of degree is [...]" to avoid naming the variable 'x'

- (several places) the framework for describing the encoding could be made a bit more clear, using the terms "message" and "encoding" more explicitly. Instead of

```
Let `m = (m_1, \dots, m_k)` a vector over F.
[...]
The corresponding codeword is the following vector:
```
what about 

```
let `m=[...]` a vector over F be the message:
[...]
the encoding of `m` will be the following codeword:
```
- `class GRSErrorErasureDecoder(Decoder)` it would be better to say : floor((d-1)/2 instead of "decoding radius". Also the input to the decode method should be a `word_and_erasure` vector, not a vector `y`.

<a id='comment:22'></a>Travis. Thanks for your follow-up corrections. Please push your branch to this ticket, as it is based on the latest commit of mine.
I am willing to positive review all of your changes except the following ones:
- in several place, you added a line break before a \textnormal{ Reed Solomon Code over }...
  there is an extra space identation in each of these which I think should be removed.
- You replaced `a new GRS code of length `n-hamming\_weight(e)`` by 
`a new GRS code of length equal to the `n`-hamming weight of `e``.
This sentence does not make sense. Maybe change it to `a new GRS code of length equal to `n` minus the Hamming weight of `e`` (move `the` and capitalize `Hamming`)


Hence I put the ticket in needs-work status again.

At the risk of bikeshedding, the spaces are there in order to show that the line came from a line break in the output. This is used in a number of other places in Sage too. IMO it builds a better association to the line above it, but I don't have a strong opinion on this.

Ah, I mis-parsed that sentence. I was wondering what the `n`-Hamming weight was and why I couldn't find a definition. Fixed.
