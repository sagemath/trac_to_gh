The reason is that I want to use library calls when available. Some of them does not support arbitrary precision exponent. I used the type from flint.

I don't know. I do not think of `power_trunc` as a convenience function. I want to use it in algorithms (like `nth_root`). We might propose `_power_trunc_` (or `_power_trunc` or any other names) with restricted types. And on the other hand `power_trunc` with arbitrary precision and possibly negative input... Library calls would just override the specialized function `_power_trunc_`. What do you think?

I will change it.

And on the other hand `power_trunc` with arbitrary precision and possibly negative input... Library calls would just override the specialized function `_power_trunc_`. What do you think?\n\nThere are two things: About negative powers, I mostly don't care though it may be handy to have the possibility. About large powers, I think that public methods with integer inputs should be able to handle any element of `ZZ`. So there are two solutions that I prefer against the current situation: Either remove the static types, or manually catch the exception for large powers. I suspect that the second solution cannot be implemented while keeping the static types...\n\nI find your solution of having both `power_mod` as public interface and `_power_mod` is a good trade-off.",

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A6):
> I don't know. I do not think of `power_trunc` as a convenience function. I want to use it in algorithms (like `nth_root`). We might propose `_power_trunc_` (or `_power_trunc` or any other names) with restricted types. And on the other hand `power_trunc` with arbitrary precision and possibly negative input... Library calls would just override the specialized function `_power_trunc_`. What do you think?

There are two things: About negative powers, I mostly don't care though it may be handy to have the possibility. About large powers, I think that public methods with integer inputs should be able to handle any element of `ZZ`. So there are two solutions that I prefer against the current situation: Either remove the static types, or manually catch the exception for large powers. I suspect that the second solution cannot be implemented while keeping the static types...

I find your solution of having both `power_mod` as public interface and `_power_mod` is a good trade-off.
