The reason is that I want to use library calls when available. Some of them does not support arbitrary precision exponent. I used the type from flint.

I find your solution of having both `power_mod` as public interface and `_power_mod` is a good trade-off.

I did not have any other option. As you said we could have checked whether the method `_power_trunc` is implemented in subclasses but this is not as simple as it seems with `cpdef` methods.

For dense polynomials, this makes sense because of the size of the representation.
