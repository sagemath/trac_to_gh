The reason is that I want to use library calls when available. Some of them does not support arbitrary precision exponent. I used the type from flint.

I don't know. I do not think of `power_trunc` as a convenience function. I want to use it in algorithms (like `nth_root`).

I find your solution of having both `power_mod` as public interface and `_power_mod` is a good trade-off.

For dense polynomials, this makes sense because of the size of the representation.
