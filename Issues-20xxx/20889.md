The reason is that I want to use library calls when available. Some of them does not support arbitrary precision exponent. I used the type from flint.

I find your solution of having both `power_mod` as public interface and `_power_mod` is a good trade-off.

I did not have any other option. As you said we could have checked whether the method `_power_trunc` is implemented in subclasses but this is not as simple as it seems with `cpdef` methods.

> I see. You mean for `prec`. As in your example, this would only be interesting for sparse polynomials. Note that it will not work at all for dense polynomials because `truncate` is defined as `cpdef Polynomial truncate(self, long prec)`. I don't mind changing the generic method to handle this case.


>  I can not change `long -> Integer` for `prec`. The reason is that `truncate` (for both dense and sparse polynomials) is declared as `cpdef truncate(self, long n)`.


For dense polynomials, this makes sense because of the size of the representation. For sparse polynomials, I think this is a problem and I encountered it several times: For sparse polynomials to have an interest, one should not bound their degree. But anyway, this is not the purpose of this ticket.
