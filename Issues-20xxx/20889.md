* How much does it gain to statically type the arguments of the method? One drawback is that you cannot do the following (though the computation would be fast):

    ```python
    sage: p = 7
    sage: R.<x> = GF(p)[]
    sage: f = x^2 + x + 1
    sage: f.power_trunc(2^100, 1000)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    OverflowError: long int too large to convert

* On a related note, do you think it may be useful to allow for a negative power? The code could be as follows:

    ```python
    if n < 0:
        return self.inverse_series_trunc(prec).power_trunc(-n, prec)

The reason is that I want to use library calls when available. Some of them does not support arbitrary precision exponent. I used the type from flint.

I find your solution of having both `power_mod` as public interface and `_power_mod` is a good trade-off.
