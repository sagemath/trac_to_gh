The doc explicitly says that to create a new class of linear codes, you must override `_repr_` and `_latex_`. However, if the user forgets, a bizarre error seems to be thrown when trying to print an instance of the new code class:

```
%cpaste
from sage.coding.linear_code import AbstractLinearCode
from sage.coding.encoder import Encoder

class MyCode(AbstractLinearCode):
    _registered_encoders = {}
    _registered_decoders = {}
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyCode, self).__init__(GF(5), 10, "Monkey", "Syndrome")
        self._dimension = 2

class MonkeyEncoder(Encoder):
    def __init__(self, C):    
        super(MonkeyEncoder, self).__init__(C)
    @cached_method
    def generator_matrix(self): 
        return matrix(GF(5), 2, 10, [ [1]*5 + [0]*5, [0]*5 + [1]*5 ])
MyCode._registered_encoders["Monkey"] = MonkeyEncoder
MyCode._registered_decoders["Syndrome"] = codes.decoders.LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder
--
sage: C = MyCode()
sage: C
<BOOM with bizarre error>
```

If `AbstractLinearCode` had a `_repr_` and a `_latex_` method which both threw sensible error messages, this would be much more helpful to the user.

Hello,

I pushed a fix for this ticket.

Two remarks:

- I used `RuntimeError` instead of `NotImplementedError` because using `NotImplementedError` prints a poorly formatted error message (you don't get any traceback).

- Because `_repr_` to always returns a string, it returns a string message including the hexadecimal address of the objects which raised the error after the usual error traceback... Because this address changes everytime, I had to set a flag `#random` to the related doctest.

Best,

David

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

Two changes and a comment/question in `_repr_` and `_latex_` of `AbstractLinearCode`:

* `Returns` should be `Return` (in both docstrings)
* It would be better to use Python3's print for the future: Please replace `"Please override `_repr_` in the implementation of %s" % self.parent()` by `"Please override `_repr_` in the implementation of {}".format(self.parent())`, and similarly in `_latex_`.
* Is it possible to get the error

  ```python
  RuntimeError: Please override _repr_ in the implementation of MyCode
  ```
  instead of 

  ```python
  RuntimeError: Please override _repr_ in the implementation of <class __main__.MyCode_with_category'>
  ```

I fixed what you asked, except for your third comment, as I'm not sure it's possible to do that.
