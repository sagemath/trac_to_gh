```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="glpk")
sage: bar = p.new_variable(name="bar")
sage: bar
MIPVariable of dimension 1
sage: bar[0]
x_0
sage: bar
MIPVariable of dimension 1
sage: bar[1]
x_1
sage: bar
MIPVariable of dimension 1
sage: p.solve()
0.0
sage: bar.values()
[x_0, x_1]
sage: p.get_values(bar)
{0: 0.0, 1: 0.0}
``` 

I think the print method should instead of "dimension 1" (which apparently means tensor order 1, rather than dimension 1 -- see #17643) print some useful information, such as the name of the variable and the dimension (number of components).

`MIPVariable bar with 7 binary components`

`MIPVariable bar with 5 real components, >= 0, <= 17`
