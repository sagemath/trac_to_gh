At #20940 Kevin Dilks suggested a `certificate`-option, which I did. For consistency I guess that other functions should have the same option too. This patch adds it to `is_relatively_complemented()`.

```
- ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) whether to return a certificate if
  ``self`` is not relatively complemented
```
and then put the description of the certificate/output in an `OUTPUT:` block. Similar for #20940.

Can be done, of course, but I guess that then at least `is_dismantlable()` should be changed too. What about `breadth()` of a lattice? See also `is_chordal()` and `is_circulant()` in generic graphs.

Is it possible to accept this and #20940, and then later change docstrings for those? Also we should think if `certify` at `canonical_label()` of graphs should be changed to `certificate`.
