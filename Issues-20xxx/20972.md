At #20940 Kevin Dilks suggested a `certificate`-option, which I did. For consistency I guess that other functions should have the same option too. This patch adds it to `is_relatively_complemented()`.

  ``self`` is not relatively complemented

and then put the description of the certificate/output in an `OUTPUT:` block. Similar for #20940.

Is it possible to accept this and #20940, and then later change docstrings for those? Also we should think if `certify` at `canonical_label()` of graphs should be changed to `certificate`.
