Some comments:

- I don't see the point of having attributes `_smoothing` and `_enhanced_states`, these should be separated out into `@cached_method`. Although it seems like `_enhanced_states` is all you really need.
- Instead of `type(_) == tuple`, use `isinstance(_, tuple)`.
- Instead of

  ```python
difs = [_ for _ in range(len(V1[0])) if V1[0][_] != V2[0][_] ]
  ```
  you can do

  ```python
V20 = V2[0]
difs = [index for index,value in enumerate(V1[0]) if value != V20[index] ]
  ```
- The output of `khovanov_homology` is mutable, so it should not be cached.

I made the suggested changes. I am not entirely happy with the format of the output, but i guess it is the price to pay for caching it.

Also, I would like to have a smarter way to take advantage of caching (for instance, if the whole homology has been computed, don't compute again the smaller pieces, and vice-versa: don't compute the pieces already computed when we compute the whole picture).

Is there a way to get which input values have already been cached?

In this case, I would say that is okay because user does not see it (but we should put a big warning to any developers to not mutate nor expose it).

It is probably worthwhile to see what `%prun` tells us.

However, [John's suggestion](#comment%3A8) of creating a dedicated class for Khovanov homology is probably best because this allows us to (potentially) give it a module structure, have full control over output, better localization of code/caching, and make it more functor-like.
