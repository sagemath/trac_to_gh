This branch implements khovanov homology for links.

```
sage: K = Link([[[1, -2, 3, -1, 2, -3]],[-1, -1, -1]])
sage: K.khovanov_homology()
{-9: {-3: Z},
-7: {-3: 0, -2: C2},

-3: {-3: 0, -2: 0, -1: 0, 0: Z},
-1: {0: Z}}
```

It is computed by following the definition.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

Some comments:

- I don't see the point of having attributes `_smoothing` and `_enhanced_states`, these should be separated out into `@cached_method`. Although it seems like `_enhanced_states` is all you really need.
- Instead of `type(_) == tuple`, use `isinstance(_, tuple)`.
- Instead of

  ```python
  difs = [_ for _ in range(len(V1[0])) if V1[0][_] != V2[0][_] ]
  ```
  you can do

  ```python
  V20 = V2[0]
  difs = [index for index,value in enumerate(V1[0]) if value != V20[index] ]
  ```
- The output of `khovanov_homology` is mutable, so it should not be cached.

Also, I would like to have a smarter way to take advantage of caching (for instance, if the whole homology has been computed, don't compute again the smaller pieces, and vice-versa: don't compute the pieces already computed when we compute the whole picture).

Is there a way to get which input values have already been cached?

Indeed, it is the value of "bases" what we reuse, but that is a dictionary, and hence mutable. Again, we could have it in a tuple format and convert it to dictionary each time we recover it.

Replying to [@miguelmarco](#comment%3A7):
> Indeed, it is the value of "bases" what we reuse, but that is a dictionary, and hence mutable. Again, we could have it in a tuple format and convert it to dictionary each time we recover it.

In this case, I would say that is okay because user does not see it (but we should put a big warning to any developers to not mutate nor expose it).

> In general, what to compute and cache each time is quite tricky here. Now we are computing all the bases of the chain complexes once and caching it. So if the user just asks for a given height, we compute a lot that we don't need. Anyways, my experience is that the biggest part of the computation is taken by computing the cohomology of the complexes, so it is not so bad.

It is probably worthwhile to see what `%prun` tells us.

However, [John's suggestion](#comment%3A8) of creating a dedicated class for Khovanov homology is probably best because this allows us to (potentially) give it a module structure, have full control over output, better localization of code/caching, and make it more functor-like.
