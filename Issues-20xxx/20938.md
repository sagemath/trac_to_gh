 This ticket proposes a implementation of Reed Muller Codes. It contains:
* A code class, BinaryReedMullerMajorityDecoder, for decoding binary reed muller codes using majority voting algorithm.
* A code class, QAryReedMullerRSDecoder, for decoding q-ary reed muller codes by embedding it in a reed solomon supercode.

Hello,

I pushed a new version of your branched merged with latest version (there was a conflict and I
allowed me to fix it myself).
I know this ticket was ready for review because you told me so by email, but would you please
use ticket states from now on? It makes the process smoother for everyone.  


Here are my comments on reviewing your work:

- a lot of lines are not in PEP8-compliance: for instance, you write `a=b` where it should be `a = b`. You can check the rules regarding whitespaces and operators [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style).

- There are some very long lines (95+ characters) in your file. See lines 1212-1215 for instance.
While I'm not adamant that the 80 characters rule should be followed everywhere (I tend to accept 85 characters), I think 95+ is too much.

- In RSDecoder's constructor (line 1241), you copy-pasted the sentence illustrating your `TESTS` block from the class above. It should not mention Binary Reed-Muller code, but RM code, as it works for any RM code.

- While I'm at it, you wrote ` if not isinstance(code, QAryReedMullerCode)`, but this works with any `q`, even `2`, doesn't it? Because if you try to build a RSDecoder with a binary RM code, it fails...

- Same decoder: is there a reason to enforce the use of Gao decoder? I might be wrong,
  but I think  that as long as you manage to build your GRS code, you can use any decoder over it.  
  Hence, I suggest to use the same kind of mechanism I used with `PuncturedCode`, `SubfieldSubcode`,
  `ExtendedCode` etc:
  allow the user to pass an instance of a decoder over the GRS code as input to RM code's decoder.
  Then use this decoder to perform decoding. This triggers some changes in your design: first, you
  have to implement a function to get the GRS code from a RM code, instead of computing it inplace
  in `decode_to_code`. I think it's nice to have such a feature anyway. 
  Then, you have to add some input sanitization checks at construction time (which will ensure the 
  decoder provided by the user is a decoder over the GRS code). You will also have to change
  `decoding_radius`, which now returns the result of `GRS's decoder.decoding_radius()`. And it also
  means `decoder_type` is now `{dynamic}`.

I still need to read carefully your implementation of the majority vote decoder.
Otherwise, it looks quite good. Your documentation, especially, is well written and explains
very well to the user how each decoder works.

Best,

David

What are ticket states? Is there a way to automate the merging with latest version?

I will edit and apply the pep8 protocols..

As far as i remember the reed solomon super code method is apllicable only for q-ary reed muller codes with order<field_size. It is applicable for binary reed muller code only if the order<=1. I guess i can allow for such binary reed muller codes.

Yeah i will add the option for using a reed solomon decoder. I had arbitrarily picked Gao.

Oh, no, you have to merge it by hand. What I meant by ticket states is to switch from `new` to `needs_review` when you finish working on it, etc. 

>As far as i remember the reed solomon super code method is apllicable only for q-ary reed muller codes with order<field_size. It is applicable for binary reed muller code only if the order<=1. I guess i can allow for such binary reed muller codes.

Yes, that would be great!

> Yeah i will add the option for using a reed solomon decoder. I had arbitrarily picked Gao. 

Ok, perfect.

Sorry for delay. Internet problems.

So i added the option for taking in decoders by the user. I added a function `ReedSolomonSupercode` that computes the super code of a reed muller code which is available to a user. I also added some extra functions to the decoder to access the supercode and its associated decoder.

Took care of formatting. Let me know if i missed few spots.

I have started my full-time employment. So i will not be able to work as quickly.

Hello,

> Sorry for delay. Internet problems. 

No worries, it's fine :)

I have a few remarks:

- I'd prefer to have `ReedSolomonSupercode` as a class method and not a global method. I think it's a a bit more intuitive to write `C.ReedSolomonSupercode()`. Also, the user will be able to find this method by typing `C.<tab>` in a terminal, which is nice. But this raises an issue: as we have *two* classes for Reed-Muller codes, there will be code duplication... Thus I suggest to make the method you wrote a private method for this module only. And then, in both `QAry` and `Binary` you add a new method, let's say `reed_solomon_supercode(self, p = None)` which returns `ReedSolomonSupercode(self, p)`. You still have some duplication, but it's a bit better as you don't copy-paste the whole method twice.

- Still talking about `ReedSolomonSupercode`, I find its documentation rather uninformative: could you please add a few more lines to explain how this Reed-Solomon code is built, and what it is wrt. the Reed-Muller code? Also, for `code`, you wrote `A Reed-Muller code of appropiate order.`. What does `appropriate order` mean?

- And last one on `ReedSolomonSupercode`: you forgot to add `::` at the end of you sentence in the `EXAMPLES` block.

- In the Supercode decoder, two methods (`reed_solomon_supercode` and `reed_solomon_decoder`) are not documented. 

- The Supercode decoder should change its types at construction time for the types of the RS decoder.
  You can copy-paste lines 347-349 from `extended_code.py` if you want `:)`.

- `decoding_radius` in the Supercode decoder should take both `*args` and `**kwargs` as input and pass these to the RS decoder's `decoding_radius`. For example, RS error-erasure decoder requires to pass the number of erasures as an argument of `decoding_radius`, so for now, calling `decoding_radius` from the supercode decoder with error-erasure as RS decoder fails.

- Since #20840, it's no longer necessary to manually add generic decoders to the list of `_registered_decoders`. So you can remove the registration lines related to Syndrome decoder.

- As it can be long to compute, and it might be called quite often, I suggest to make  `_list_polynomial` a cached method.

- Can you write a few more lines of documentation to `_set_to_mask`? I think it's a bit hard to understand what it does just by reading the doc for now.

- In `_list_polynomial`, I'd write `Return the list of all polynomials of degree etc` instead of `Lists all polynomials of degree etc` to be consistent with the usual way of writing these sentences.

Sure, don't worry! Take all the time you need.

So the canges in this commit includes:

1. Adding `reed_solomon_supercode()` function to each reed muller code classes rather that making it a global method.

2. Modified documentation for `reed_solomon_supercode()`

3. Modified `reed_solomon_supercode()` to give the reed solomon supercode for ALL binary reed muller codes (not useful in decoding though)

4. Modified the constructor of `QAryReedMullerRSDecoder` to change it's decoder_type.

5. Modifed `decoding_radius` to allow additional arguments.

6. removed uneccessary registration of syndrome decoders

7. Adding documentation to `reed_solomon_supercode()` and `reed_solomon_decoder()`

8. Made `_list_polynomial` a cached function

9. Modified documentation of `_list_polynomial` and `set_to_mask`

Let me know if i missed out something or have further reviews.

Hi,
it seems this ticket is a bit stalled...

Doctest failures against 7.4:

* DeprecationWarning: codes.RandomLinearCode(n, k, F) is deprecated. Please use codes.random_linear_code(F, n, k) instead

Other comments:

* `_list_polynomial(F, x, d)` already exists as `R.<x>=F[]; R.polynomials(max_degree=d-1)`

* `_set_to_mask` is used only in one function, I would inline it, eventually as the one liner `sum(1<<i for i in s)`

* use `k in d` instead of `d.has_key(k)`

* I wouldn't use `dict` as a variable name: it shadows the built-in type

* Instead of the `while True` loop just iterate over `Subsets` (or `itertools.combinations` see next point)

* you might be interested by this:

```
sage: %time len(list(Subsets(range(20), 5)))
CPU times: user 1.08 s, sys: 24 ms, total: 1.1 s
Wall time: 1.04 s
15504
sage: %time len(list(itertools.combinations(range(20), 5)))
CPU times: user 4 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 4 ms
Wall time: 3.35 ms
15504

sage: %timeit s = Set(range(4)).difference([1,3])
10000 loops, best of 3: 106 µs per loop
sage: %timeit s = set(range(4)).difference([1,3])
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.96 µs per loop
```
