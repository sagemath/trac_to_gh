adding a method to obtain the canonical decomposition
of Tamari interval-posets into new interval-posets

This would be more fun with #20240 available.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Thank you, Travis, for this useful remark. I have streamlined the code.

`@`jmantysalo, I do not expect a full mathematical review here, but maybe just a check that the code is written efficiently enough, does what it is expected to do in the doctests, and can safely enter sage.

The main idea is to use some kind of "canonical drawing" of binary trees, as already implemented in the "to_tilting" method of binary trees. Then one superposes two such drawings, and cut at the superposition points.
