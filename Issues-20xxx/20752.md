As reported in [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/33623/bug-in-cos-function-in-version-72/?answer=33624#post-id-33624), Sage makes wrong simplifications in symbolic trigonometry involving fractions:

```
sage: cos(pi+pi*1/42)
cos(1/42*pi)
```

While it should be `-cos(1/42*pi)`.

I do not have intermediate versions of Sage with me, but i confirm that it is a regression since on Sage 5.12, we have:

```
sage: cos(pi+pi*1/42)
cos(43/42*pi)
sage: sin(pi+pi/42)
sin(43/42*pi)
```

More precisely, on a 7.2.beta4 version of Sage which i can reach by ssh, it works well:

```
sage: cos(pi+pi*1/42)
cos(43/42*pi)
sage: sin(pi+pi*1/42)
sin(43/42*pi)
```

So the regression is very recent, could it be due to the last update of pynac/ginac ?

Almost certainly so.  See e.g. [this bug](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/170), though I assume it is a different particular one.
