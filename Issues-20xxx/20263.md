Add a member function to polynomials that returns the product of all irreducible factors which are cyclotomic polynomials.

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: pol = (x^4+1)^2*(x^4+2)
sage: pol.cyclotomic_part()
x^8 + 2*x^4 + 1
```

hello,

- please, fill the "Authors" field of the ticket with your full name

- avoid the usage of "self" in the docstring. It can be "this polynomial". As it is a method, `self` is not considered as an argument.

- you should add doctests over the rationals

- what the algorithm should do over non exact rings (like the `RR` and `CC` floating points in Sage)? I guess that you might want to raise an error in that case.

Technically, `self` is an argument of every instance method (otherwise it would be a class method). More importantly, many of the docstrings in this file use `self`, so I don't want to change the prevailing format (at least not in this ticket). The Sage Developer's Guide doesn't seem to express an opinion here.

Yes, raising an error seems like the most useful outcome.

Hi Kiran! It's an argument the method receives, but it's not an argument the user supplies explicitly.

> More importantly, many of the docstrings in this file use `self`, so I don't want to change the prevailing format

Your observation piqued my interest and a scanned the file. My impression was that "this polynomial" is a tad more common. Some docstrings refer to two polynomials, without being specific about one that is "this".

The thing that struck me was that the use of `self` was largely (but not exclusively) restricted to "dunder", private, and interfacing methods. These are methods that are hard to look up for users and/or that users will have less interest in looking up.

So when we restrict to "user facing" methods, I think the prevailing style quite solidly favours "this polynomial" over "self".

Instead of dividing by the leading coefficient you can use the `monic` method.

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: p = 3*x**2 + 2*x**3 + 5
sage: p.monic()
x^3 + 3/2*x^2 + 5/2
```

EDIT: this is not a good idea since this method **always** converts the polynomial to a rational one...

Since I only need to refer to the underlying object *once*, I think I can and should get away with calling it "this polynomial". If I needed to refer to it more than once, I'd stick with `self`.

Hello,

When a reviewer complain he/she puts the ticket in "needs work". When you are done with the modifications you should set it back to "needs review". Otherwise it might be forgotten.
