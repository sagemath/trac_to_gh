The purpose of this ticket is to get Sage to build with gcc6 asap; This requires some workarounds since gcc6 defaults to `std=gnu++14` and some of our packages aren't ready.

* BRiAl -- configure issue, see #20741
* eclib -- builds with `-std=c++98`
* LinBox -- builds with `-std=c++98`, see #20929
* PPL -- builds with `-std=c++98`, but can be updated, see #20927
* Singular -- see #20738
* Sage library (because of inclusion of e.g LinBox headers)

I've posted a patch for the Sage library on sage-release.

While Singular builds, the executable and libsingular (hence Sage) crash for me and others (cf. #20738 and sage-release).

I'd prefer if we only add `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` when necessary, as neither GCC 4.9.x nor 5.x are broken w.r.t. this:

```sh
case `$CXX -dumpversion` in

You mean *instead of* `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks`?

(In contrast to the latter, it's disabled with `-O1`, which worked for me, but only in conjunction with the latter, i.e. `-O1 -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks`, IIRC, cf. #20738 comment 6.)

Or did you add some `extra_compile_args` in `src/sage/libs/singular/*.pxd` as well?

With just `-fno-strict-overflow` added to (just) `CXXFLAGS`, `./sage --singular` immediately segfaults for me.

Does this refer to the three segfaults / aborts in ptestlong you reported [above](#comment%3A27)?  How did you get these?

With Sage 7.3.beta7 (plus the branch here) and vanilla FSF GCC 6.1.0, GCC configured to produce native code by default, but otherwise no `*FLAGS` set, ptestlong passes for me (modulo the usual failure in one test due to numeric noise and another GAP-related which nearly always fails in the first place, but passes when rerun) on Linux x86_64 (Haswell-E).

P.S.:  There should be a `2>/dev/null` in <code>\`$CXX -dumpversion\`</code>, and while I don't mind re-exporting CXXFLAGS, I'd move their modification a bit up (to not mix it with changes to`MAKE`):

OT (I think), but did you try downgrading `make` (to 4.1, say)?

After running `./sage -i jmol` and `./sage pip install sympy`, I can build the documentation. It's running now, so far no problems. Assuming that the package problem is orthogonal to the gcc-issue, then it's looking good.

Why was the line

```
# distutils: language = c
```
added to `src/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_sparse.pxd`?

Does that even do something, given that `c` is the default?
