The purpose of this ticket is to get Sage to build with gcc6 asap; This requires some workarounds since gcc6 defaults to `std=gnu++14` and some of our packages aren't ready.

* BRiAl -- configure issue, see #20741
* eclib -- builds with `-std=c++98`
* LinBox -- builds with `-std=c++98`, see #20929
* PPL -- builds with `-std=c++98`, but can be updated, see #20927
* Singular -- see #20738
* Sage library (because of inclusion of e.g LinBox headers)

<a id='comment:13'>Comment 13:</a>
I've posted a patch for the Sage library on sage-release.

While Singular builds, the executable and libsingular (hence Sage) crash for me and others (cf. #20738 and sage-release).

I'd prefer if we only add `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` when necessary, as neither GCC 4.9.x nor 5.x are broken w.r.t. this:

```sh
case `$CXX -dumpversion` in
    6|6.*)
        CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks"
        ;;
esac

(The `6` is necessary for OpenSuSE's GCC IIRC.  `CXXFLAGS` already get exported earlier in Singular's `spkg-install`.)

You mean *instead of* `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks`?

(In contrast to the latter, it's disabled with `-O1`, which worked for me, but only in conjunction with the latter, i.e. `-O1 -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks`, IIRC, cf. #20738 comment 6.)

Besides a lot of other suspicious warnings...

Or did you add some `extra_compile_args` in `src/sage/libs/singular/*.pxd` as well?

With just `-fno-strict-overflow` added to (just) `CXXFLAGS`, `./sage --singular` immediately segfaults for me.

Does this refer to the three segfaults / aborts in ptestlong you reported [above](#comment%3A27)?  How did you get these?

\\

With Sage 7.3.beta7 (plus the branch here) and vanilla FSF GCC 6.1.0, GCC configured to produce native code by default, but otherwise no `*FLAGS` set, ptestlong passes for me (modulo the usual failure in one test due to numeric noise and another GAP-related which nearly always fails in the first place, but passes when rerun) on Linux x86_64 (Haswell-E).

P.S.:  There should be a `2>/dev/null` in <code>\`$CXX -dumpversion\`</code>, and while I don't mind re-exporting CXXFLAGS, I'd move their modification a bit up (to not mix it with changes to`MAKE`):

OT (I think), but did you try downgrading `make` (to 4.1, say)?

(Or debug the Sage build process with your version as suggested on sage-devel, e.g. by starting with `make -n pkg_which_didnt_get_built`, then perhaps successively adding some debug options until you see why the package doesn't get built.)
