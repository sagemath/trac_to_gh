The purpose of this ticket is to get Sage to build with gcc6 asap; This requires some workarounds since gcc6 defaults to `std=gnu++14` and some of our packages aren't ready.

* BRiAl -- configure issue, see #20741
* eclib -- builds with `-std=c++98`
* LinBox -- builds with `-std=c++98`, see #20929
* PPL -- builds with `-std=c++98`, but can be updated, see #20927
* Singular -- see #20738
* Sage library (because of inclusion of e.g LinBox headers)

I'd prefer if we only add `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` when necessary, as neither GCC 4.9.x nor 5.x are broken w.r.t. this:

```sh
case `$CXX -dumpversion` in

        CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks"
        ;;
esac

You mean *instead of* `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks`?

(In contrast to the latter, it's disabled with `-O1`, which worked for me, but only in conjunction with the latter, i.e. `-O1 -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks`, IIRC, cf. #20738 comment 6.)

> This does not surprise too much as there are numerous warnings about conversions between pointers and signed integers.


Besides a lot of other suspicious warnings...

P.S.:  There should be a `2>/dev/null` in ``$CXX -dumpversion``, and while I don't mind re-exporting CXXFLAGS, I'd move their modification a bit up (to not mix it with changes to`MAKE`):

After running `./sage -i jmol` and `./sage pip install sympy`, I can build the documentation. It's running now, so far no problems. Assuming that the package problem is orthogonal to the gcc-issue, then it's looking good.

Does that even do something, given that `c` is the default?
