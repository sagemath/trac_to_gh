I can take a look. At least `c.q(n)*c.p(n-2)for` needs a space before `for` IMO (not an error technically, but...). Also `print(v)` has old-style continuation (which is not an error, this is just a note).

You have forgotten two prints:

```
sage: print 10, 0.5 ; print(10+0.5) ; print 10.0, 5
```

and

```
print 10+0, 5 ; print(str(10)+str(0.5))
```

I am now compiling and testing.

I have **chosen** to leave these two doctests as they are, because they serve (in the french book) to illustrate the behavior of print in python2. This is a difficult case.
I would prefer to postpone changing them to the very end of the process, when we will switch
to python3 print.
