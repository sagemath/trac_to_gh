Only fixed modulus p-adic numbers can implement an obvious hash functions. Currently some other p-adic elements do which causes horrible bugs:

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def is_one(x):
....:     return x==1

sage: R = Zp(3, 70)
sage: is_one(R(1,1))
True
sage: is_one(R(2^64))
True
sage: R(2^64)
1 + 2*3 + 2*3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 2*3^5 + 3^7 + 2*3^8 + 3^10 + 2*3^11 + 2*3^13 + 3^14 + 2*3^16 + 3^18 + 3^19 + 2*3^20 + 3^21 + 3^23 + 2*3^25 + 3^26 + 2*3^27 + 2*3^28 + 3^29 + 2*3^30 + 2*3^31 + 2*3^34 + 2*3^35 + 2*3^36 + 3^37 + 3^38 + 3^39 + 3^40 + O(3^70)
```

The problem here is that `==` has been changed so that two numbers are equal if they are equal to the least common precision. In this example, the two elements are equal to precision one and they have the same hash value (at least on my machine).

The proposal of this ticket is to a global state which indicates whether we are currently using "strict precision", i.e., only considering elements as equal if they are indistinguishable in computations. This is set by wrapping code in `with strict_precision(True):` and should be used when caching takes place. If this is not set, p-adics are unhashable.

Here are some alternatives that we're discussed as part of #11895:

* Keep it the way it is. (I do not think that this is a good idea. If you do intensive p-adic computations then the birthday paradox will eventually hit you.)
* Mark p-adics in a special way so their `==` is not used by `cached_method` and friends. (Not an option, because p-adics may be wrapped inside other objects which will still use their operator `==`.)
* Change `==` for p-adics to say whether two numbers are "really" equal. (Bad idea. Say you are in a p-adic field. Some algorithm wants to know whether `x` is invertible and says `x==0`. Now this will be false for most `p`-adic zeros.)
* Make `__hash__` return a constant. (This would work but will give horrible performance.)
* Make p-adics entirely unhashable but add a special `_cache_key` which the caching framework is aware of. (This is how it is currently implemented for p-adics in unramified extensions.) The problem with this solution is that you have to add these `_cache_key` methods to all classes whose `__hash__` might rely on a `p`-adic number somehow (matrices, polynomials, ...) which is ugly.

Here are some timings. In all these examples, `X = toric_varieties.dP8()` and we consider `%timeit [X.cohomology_basis(1) for i in range(1000)]`.

The current `cachefunc.pyx` (using `_cache_key` in a try-finally-block):

```
1000 loops, best of 3: 419 µs per loop
```
The old version which does not handle unhashable objects at all:

```
1000 loops, best of 3: 387 µs per loop
```
The proposed implementation:

```
1000 loops, best of 3: 395 µs per loop
```

The huge problem with `cache_key` is that any object that can recursively contain an inexact element needs to now define a `cache_key`.  Polynomials, matrices, parents that are defined by polynomials....  It's a nightmare to add all of these `cache_keys`.

And if `strict_equality` is used sparingly, I don't think it's that bad.

I really think making the meaning of equality tests depend on the program state is a very undesirable step to make and compared to that, implementing some `cache_key` routines doesn't seem so bad.

However, most parents get used as cache keys in our factories and `UniqueRepresentation`. And parents may depend on p-adic numbers in some way.

I agree that it is usually a programming error. Therefore, you want to make sure that people explicitly select the right notion of equality to use them. Note that this is also a problem for fraction field elements.

> There's no need to universally announce that any object containing p-adics can be used as a cache key.

No but a lot of our code assumes that everything is usable as a key in a dictionary for the sake of caching. I believe that this is a reasonable assumption: Running a method on indistinguishable inputs should produce the same output. And in some cases it should even produce the exact same object, for example when creating parents; in those cases you can not do without caching.

> And if I understand correctly, the cache_key can be implemented quite high in the hierarchy, so you wouldn't need to so terribly many of them, and their implementations are trivial.

I am not sure what you mean with "high up". For correctness you have to implement it in any class that gets instantiated with a parameter that may depend (in some way) on something unhashable, because essentially you just need to write this as a method that produces the constructor parameters that serve to produce an indistinguishable element.

> I can see how it might seem like a nightmare, but actually doing it for the cases where you need it might not be so bad. The remaining cases will get pretty good error messages because it's just a hashing failure.

Though I originally implemented `_cache_key` what I dislike about it is that you just have to add silly boilerplate to many classes. The new approach is much better in that sense. The changes are where the actual problem arises, namely in the classes that can not define a usual `__hash__`. For everybody else it just works and it is actually correct. The current `_cache_key` is calling for trouble in the long run: People add a constructor parameter but don't add it to `_cache_key`; the doctests pass but caching eventually produces incorrect results.
Of course, if the end user decides to run all its code `with strict_equality(True)` then many things break. But the docstring tries to be clear about this.

I think the "strategic places" is a problem here. What this says it that using p-adics (or fraction field elements) just works in places where there happened to be a doctest that implied p-adics (and usually extension fields to actually trigger `__hash__`.) Why not make it work everywhere?

> I really think making the meaning of equality tests depend on the program state is a very undesirable step to make and compared to that, implementing some `cache_key` routines doesn't seem so bad.

Yes, global state is bad. The implementation is very clear on that and I can elaborate on this further in the docstrings. If you enable strict equality and then call into other code you are calling for trouble. That is why you only enable it very locally and can even disable it again more locally if you need to call out.

And parents may depend on p-adic numbers in some way.\n\nParents that are used as cache-keys are usually not a problem: they are usually `EqualityByID`, so they can basically hash by their ID. If p-adics are part of the construction parameters (e.g., a p-adic extension field, perhaps?) of a `unique` parent structure, a little more is needed, of course. There either we would need `cache_key` or we'd need to transform the construction parameters into something that can be hashed. For extension fields, that's actually not such an unreasonable thing to do: fields defined by a minimal polynomial that is only known to limited precision is a real pain. It's much more convenient to lift it to an exact polynomial.\n\nIn any case, I would be very surprised if there are any structures out there that depend on anything else than sequences, polynomials, and matrices.

Replying to [@saraedum](#comment%3A24):
> However, most parents get used as cache keys in our factories and `UniqueRepresentation`. And parents may depend on p-adic numbers in some way.

Parents that are used as cache-keys are usually not a problem: they are usually `EqualityByID`, so they can basically hash by their ID. If p-adics are part of the construction parameters (e.g., a p-adic extension field, perhaps?) of a `unique` parent structure, a little more is needed, of course. There either we would need `cache_key` or we'd need to transform the construction parameters into something that can be hashed. For extension fields, that's actually not such an unreasonable thing to do: fields defined by a minimal polynomial that is only known to limited precision is a real pain. It's much more convenient to lift it to an exact polynomial.

In any case, I would be very surprised if there are any structures out there that depend on anything else than sequences, polynomials, and matrices. If those have cache_key strategies, we'd be OK.

> No but a lot of our code assumes that everything is usable as a key in a dictionary for the sake of caching. I believe that this is a reasonable assumption: Running a method on indistinguishable inputs should produce the same output. And in some cases it should even produce the exact same object, for example when creating parents; in those cases you can not do without caching.

But I am pretty sure this is limited to polynomials and matrices.

> I am not sure what you mean with "high up". For correctness you have to implement it in any class that gets instantiated with a parameter that may depend (in some way) on something unhashable, because essentially you just need to write this as a method that produces the constructor parameters that serve to produce an indistinguishable element.

I meant: you could start sticking implementations into the more generic classes for polynomials and matrices. I don't think we need to define "correctness" as "p-adic numbers are hashable".

> Though I originally implemented `_cache_key` what I dislike about it is that you just have to add silly boilerplate to many classes. The new approach is much better in that sense. The changes are where the actual problem arises, namely in the classes that can not define a usual `__hash__`. For everybody else it just works and it is actually correct. The current `_cache_key` is calling for trouble in the long run: People add a constructor parameter but don't add it to `_cache_key`; the doctests pass but caching eventually produces incorrect results.

Most parents do not need a `_cache_key`, because they are actually hashable thanks to `EqualityByID`. I'd expect that only some element classes need a `_cache_key`. So the scenario you sketch would only play out if the identity-determining components of an element change.

> Of course, if the end user decides to run all its code `with strict_equality(True)` then many things break. But the docstring tries to be clear about this.

The fundamental point is that you make equality context dependent. It means you now need to know global state in order to reason about code that otherwise looks completely local. I think that's an incredibly big complexification and a major step back in the understandability and maintainability of sage code. Whatever you write in the docstring doesn't change that fact. You can't fix bad design by good documentation.

> I think the "strategic places" is a problem here. What this says it that using p-adics (or fraction field elements) just works in places where there happened to be a doctest that implied p-adics (and usually extension fields to actually trigger `__hash__`.) Why not make it work everywhere?

I think you are too pessimistic about the multitude of ways in which padic numbers can end up being hashed in legitimate ways. I think you can get this covered pretty quickly (polys and matrices). Plus: a lot of places where p-adics aren't initially foreseen will actually break with p-adics, because they are imprecise objects. That usually breaks algorithms that weren't built with that in mind.

Being clear about it doesn't fix a bad design decision (an, I think, justified technical qualification of the proposal which in no way reflects on the proposers)

I'm sympathetic about the problem. The issue is really that equality tests for p-adics are probably bad in all cases. We're finding two interpretations that sort-of work in some circumstances:
- difference is indistinguishable from 0: if you start out with sufficient starting precision, you can sort-of run "precise" algorithms and get a more-or-less correct answer
- equal only if numbers are functionally the same: the safer notion for hashing.

Option 1 at least allows us to do naive linear algebra on small systems, with a ridiculous amount of excess precision. (in a way that works better than with floats, say)

Option 2 is required to sort-of properly handle routines that assume hashability.

We can't have both. Option 1 is what people expect when they start working with p-adics initially. For option 2 we have a work-around in the form of `cache_key` (which I thought was a stroke of brilliance!). So I think the best way forward is to try and make `cache_key` work.

I agree it would be nicer to have another solution, but we're dealing with two different concepts of equality here, and we can't cram them into the same interface.

I meant to define correctness of caching as "indistinguishable input => indistinguishable output".

I did not mean to focus that much on parents.

I don't think it is bad design. It is as much bad design as say a mutex.

Not sure what you are trying to say here…

> [Different notions of equality]

It is unfortunate that sage did not start with many notions of equality. In an "ideal" (but probably unusable) computer algebra system `==` would just throw an exception unless all reasonable notions of equality are the same for both sides of the equation (taking into account precision, properties that are outside of mathematics like printing, coercion, …) and would require you to be precise about what equality should mean here.

OK, finally I've found why making objects only hashable part of the time is a no-go: Regardless of threading, python does have non-synchronous code execution due to handling of signals, weakref callbacks, and deletion finalizers. These can lead to arbitrary code execution, so they will be executing code in an environment where equality testing doesn't have a well-defined meaning anymore (if equality testing semantics depend on a globally settable flag). 

In particular, making hashability depend on a global flag is a no-go, because callback code can trigger key lookup:

```
class T(object):
    def __init__(self,V):
        self.V=V
    def __repr__(self):
        return "<T(%s)>"%V
    def __hash__(self):
        if hashflag:
            return hash(self.V)
        else:
            raise TypeError("T is not hashable at the moment")
    def __eq__(self,other):
        return isinstance(other,T) and self.V == other.V
    def __ne__(self,other):
        return not(self==other)
```
You get this:

```
sage: v=T(0) #this just needs to be a weakreffable object
sage: k=T(1)
sage: D=weakref.WeakValueDictionary()
sage: hashflag=True
sage: D[k]=v
sage: hashflag=False
sage: del v
Exception TypeError: TypeError('T is not hashable at the moment',) in <function remove at 0x7f384da9a0c8> ignored
```
(and yes, particularly the cache for `UniqueRepresetation` is a `WeakValueDictionary`. That particular one is a slightly safer one than what comes bundled with python by default, so this particular issue isn't triggered there, but I think it illustrates that in python it's illegal to have a hashable object that becomes unhashable afterwards).

So it's not even a question of of design preferences: the design is not according to the behaviour that python objects are expected to adhere to, so it's a no-go unless we decide that sage isn't python anymore.

The problem that triggered writing the safer weakvaluedict was that equality testing on *defunct objects in to process of being deleted* is sometimes not supported anymore. This is because some objects depend on circular references to have their equality testing defined and we can't control the state of teardown present when the callback gets executed. It turned out that it was too much to ask that the key object under which the weakref is stored was still in a valid state during callback.\n\nOtherwise these objects have (or at least as supposed to have) well-defined equality tests during their lifetimes, and there is no particular reason to ban equality testing in callbacks.\n\nFor p-adics, the equality testing would change with time during their useful lifetime. That means a new rule would come in place in sage: make sure your callback code does not depend on equality testing state between p-adics, because their equality-testing state is ill-defined.\n\nIt would place a huge burden on callback writing: any callback would need to ensure to enforce the right equality testing regime around any place where it might be possible that p-adics get compared. For most callbacks it would be very hard to know this for certain, so basically any callback would need to have a `with strictequality(False):` around its body. And we'd still be unsafe in the face of threading (in a way we would never be able to fix later).\n\nSo I think the scenario that lead to writing `weak_dict` is quite different from what we're facing here.",

Not quite. The problem that triggered writing the safer weakvaluedict was that equality testing on *defunct objects in to process of being deleted* is sometimes not supported anymore. This is because some objects depend on circular references to have their equality testing defined and we can't control the state of teardown present when the callback gets executed. It turned out that it was too much to ask that the key object under which the weakref is stored was still in a valid state during callback.

Otherwise these objects have (or at least as supposed to have) well-defined equality tests during their lifetimes, and there is no particular reason to ban equality testing in callbacks.

For p-adics, the equality testing would change with time during their useful lifetime. That means a new rule would come in place in sage: make sure your callback code does not depend on equality testing state between p-adics, because their equality-testing state is ill-defined.

It would place a huge burden on callback writing: any callback would need to ensure to enforce the right equality testing regime around any place where it might be possible that p-adics get compared. For most callbacks it would be very hard to know this for certain, so basically any callback would need to have a `with strictequality(False):` around its body. And we'd still be unsafe in the face of threading (in a way we would never be able to fix later).

So I think the scenario that lead to writing `weak_dict` is quite different from what we're facing here.

I don't know which callbacks there are exactly in sage. However, for me it's really an interface design issue. p-adic numbers are very useful and I think we should be able to model them using normal python objects. Introducing `strictequality` state would depart from that.

As an example, we'd end up with objects that somehow can be stuck into a dictionary but then don't behave as one would expect. We'd end up with dictionaries for which things like

```
all(d in D for d in D)
```
doesn't hold. That is unnecessarily complicating the language. TO give some examples of unexpected things: dictionaries (and hence objects containing such dictionaries) won't pickle anymore:

```
loads(dumps(D))
```
requires hash to work. So you'd end up having to inject `with(strictequality):` blocks throughout the (un)pickling code.

More surprisingly,

```
D1.update(D2)
```
will *not* throw an error: dictionary entries do store the hash of their key, so `update` doesn't need to recompute hashes. However, it does need to use equality testing on the keys in case of hash collisions, so `D1.update(D2)` would run without raising an exception outside a `strictequality(True)` block, but would produce results distinct from what would happen otherwise.

We'd furthermore have objects that we can stick into a data structure supplied by the standard library (`weakref.WeakValueDictionary`) but don't behave properly in it.

It's not just a matter of what is in sage now. It's about ensuring that we make sure that the objects we create in sage are relatively easy to reason about.
