The current behaviour of `Parent.list()` is the road to insanity:

```
sage: F = GF(5)
sage: F.list()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
sage: F.list().remove(0)
sage: F.list()
[1, 2, 3, 4] 
```

The reason is that the output of `list` is cached, and a list is mutable, and so the user can permanently modify it. This easily happens without wanting to.

The closest Python concept of an "immutable list" is a tuple.

A quick look at the Python docs (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html) shows that the following are all methods of basic types:

```
math.floor()
math.ceil()
int.bit_length()
float.hex()
list.index()
str.title()
str.upper()
dict.keys()
dict.values()
dict.items()
```
This is definitely a minority of the methods one finds on that page, but it makes the point that insisting that method names be verbs is a good design principle, not an absolute rule; it definitely gets overridden when there is no simple alternative. 

For that matter, sometimes one can't even tell: is `foo.count()` a noun or a verb? It would be pretty un-Pythonic (and perhaps unfair to non-English speakers) to have `list` mean completely different things when interpreted as a noun vs. a verb, in addition to confusing the defined terms `list` and `tuple`.

That is not true:

```
sage: A=([1],[2])
sage: A[0].append(3)
sage: A
([1, 3], [2])
```

That said, I don't think `foo.tuple()` would be discoverable at all, so think that's a very bad name for implementing this functionality.

I think it is essential that `foo.list()` continues to provide a way to indexably access constituents of an object (although it would be interesting to have data on how much code depends on that). If returning a list for that is too dangerous, I'd be fine with a tuple instead.

If it has to be a list then that would be fine with me. If it's too difficult to let people use `copy` when they need to, we may just have to add an option. Something like:

```
sage: foo.list()
<returns a copied list>
sage: foo.list(tuple=true)
<returns the cached/stored tuple>
sage: foo.list(copy=false)
<returns the cached/stored list>
```

Concerning verbs/nouns: English is a pretty flexible language. You can verb any noun in it, so without grammatical context you can't really tell what it is anyway. If we want to remove the ambiguity, we should probably rename the method to `foo.listify()`.

In fact, I always thought that desctructive method would be verbs (and return None) and methods without side effects would be nouns, as in `L.sort()` versus `L.sorted()` (except that python, having a decided preference for routines with side effects, doesn't have the latter)

Note that a common design paradigm in python is "we are all consenting adults here" (an argument I haven't seen brought up against using python for pre-university schooling yet). From that perspective, returning a mutable list (perhaps because it must be mutable internally) that shouldn't be mutated isn't an absolute no-go.

Yes, you're right. The only time it matters whether a member of a tuple is mutable is when the tuple is hashed.

So that means that one could cache a tuple and have `foo.list()` return a list copy of that tuple, as long as there is no actual legitimate reason to modify the cached list (I certainly can't think of one). In a performance-critical situation, one shouldn't be asking for either a list or a tuple anyway, but rather an iterator.

In a performance-critical situation, one shouldn't be asking for either a list or a tuple anyway, but rather an iterator.\n\nNo, an iterator provides a different kind of interface: if you need indexing an iterator will just not do. Even for iteration an iterator might not be the lowest overhead: you're incurring python call overhead on each access. List/tuple items can be retrieved more efficiently than that (provided the entries have to be in memory anyway). This will be a tiny difference, though.",

> So that means that one could cache a tuple and have `foo.list()` return a list copy of that tuple, as long as there is no actual legitimate reason to modify the cached list (I certainly can't think of one). In a performance-critical situation, one shouldn't be asking for either a list or a tuple anyway, but rather an iterator.

No, an iterator provides a different kind of interface: if you need indexing an iterator will just not do. Even for iteration an iterator might not be the lowest overhead: you're incurring python call overhead on each access. List/tuple items can be retrieved more efficiently than that (provided the entries have to be in memory anyway). This will be a tiny difference, though.

On a different point, there is also a Python design principle that "tuples are for heterogeneous data, lists are for homogeneous data". In our context, `Parent.list()` will be the various members of some mathematical structure, which definitely constitute homogeneous data (they will all be of the same class, for one).

That said, all design principles are secondary to having things behave correctly...
