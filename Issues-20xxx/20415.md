This is a follow-up on #20301.
#20296 provides a way to select a suitable solver by its `base_ring`.

`Polyhedron.to_linear_program` should do that. 

Note, for exact polyhedra, this will change the behavior of `to_linear_program` from inexact computation to exact computation, which will be much slower (but note, speed is irrelevant for this method, because when the `Polyhedron` was set up, already the double description has been computed eagerly.)

To restore the old behavior, the user would need to pass an explicit `base_ring=RDF` or `solver=...` argument to `to_linear_program`.
(The patch adds many examples that illustrate this.)
