Here are some benchmarks, first with plain Sage 5.3, then with
Travis's optimizations, and then after the code refactorization of
commit ee10e70daec5704b4f2c8f63c2cf2e3c525e9311. Sorry that's a bit
long; the timings fluctuate quite some which makes it painful to do.

Rough interpretation: with Travis optimization the speed gain
fluctuates between 1 and 3, and the refactorization does no harm, and
could even improve slightly the situation.

# Protocol

For each n=0,1000,2000,4000, we time the addition of two dictionaries
of length n. Three times for overlapping dictionaries, three times for
half overlapping dictionaries, three times for non overlapping
dictionaries.

```
    def Xn(n): return { i:i for i in range(n) }
    def Yn(n): return { i:i for i in range(n,2*n) }
    def Zn(n): return { i:i for i in range(2*n,3*n) }
```

# Sage 5.3

Setup:

```
    sage: blasadd = sage.combinat.dict_addition.dict_addition
```
Running the tests for a given n:

```
    X = Xn(n); Y = Yn(n); Z = Zn(n)
    %timeit blasadd([X,X])
    %timeit blasadd([X,X])
    %timeit blasadd([X,X])
    %timeit blasadd([X,Y])
    %timeit blasadd([X,Y])
    %timeit blasadd([X,Y])

After discussion with Travis:
- We will move it now
- A bit of hesitation between `sage.modules` and `sage.data_structures`; Travis is more in favor of the latter.

Any opinion?

I'll fix some remaining doctest failures in the mean time.

Your comment was about `data_structures` versus `combinat`, when we are hesitating between `modules` and `data_structures` :-)

I'll do the move this afternoon.

Obvious design question: why don't you implement this as a subclass of `dict` such that you could actually write `a * D` instead of `scal(a, D)`?

I understand that it might be more work this way. It does seem the most natural thing to do and it would result in more readable and more efficient code.

More precisely, `_mul_` would not be involved since `D` would not be an `Element`. But the coercion model would be involved. If the coercion model is too slow for these purposes, we *really* should fix that. It makes no sense to make code more complicated just to avoid the coercion model.

I think you're misparsing something. The word `value` is as in key-value pair of a dictionary (because everything we are doing is dictionaries). In some cases, someone might want a basis element that has a coefficient of 0. For instance, it takes longer to remove these coefficients, and if you're doing a lot of additions with full support, you may only want to remove the basis elements with a 0 coefficient after you're all done.

So I was trying to add an element and a list. I implemented an add that looked like this:

```sage
def __add__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, list):
        return self + self.parent()(list[0])
    return super(self, Foo).__add__(other)
```
What I saw happen when it was `list + Foo` was `__add__` was being called with `self` being `list`. If it got to `__radd__`, then it would have been after this call, but I was getting an error trying to make the `super` call that wasn't getting caught.

Right, that is how `__add__` works in a `cdef class`. For this reason, I recommend against using the name `self` in this case. I prefer

```
def __add__(left, right):
```
which shows the more symmetric nature of the arguments.

What do you mean? There is no `__radd__` for a `cdef class`.

> I was getting an error trying to make the `super` call that wasn't getting caught.


Logically, if `self` is not an instance of `Foo`, then `super(self, Foo)` would be an error.

If remove_zeros=True (and the input have no zero values themselves),
then the output is guaranteed to have no zero values. Otherwise the
some zero value may be left in the output. Which ones is voluntarily
left undefined.

The point is that clearing zero values has a cost and there are cases
where the user want to postpone the clearing until the end of a long
series of operations.

Jeroen: does the above clarify the remove_zeros option? If yes, I'll
add it to the documentation.

Hi Jeroen,

Thanks for the feedback!

The current design (compared to a class with methods) has two advantages for such a low level use case:

- following a widely used pattern for basic linear algebra operations (used even in OO languages)
- not requiring to coerce / cast inputs when they are provided as plain dictionaries;
  the same holds for output

(and you know that I am a fan of OO :-) )

This is an interesting (but wrong) argument. It shows that there are a lot of misconceptions about efficiency in !Python/Cython code.

What is correct:

(1) Arithmetic operators (like `+` implemented as `__add__`) are fast.

(2) `isinstance()` in Cython is fast.

(3) Python function calls are slow.

In turns out that (1) + (2) is actually faster than (3).

First of all, I am not going to insist on implementing this as a subclass. You know better than me how this code is actually used.

Still, some comments:

I believe the standard implementation languages of BLAS are Fortran and C and those are not OO languages.

> - not requiring to coerce / cast inputs when they are provided as plain dictionaries;


Sure, this is indeed a potential disadvantage (but also the only one). Wouldn't it work to just keep the attributes `__monomials` or `_monomial_coefficients` an instance of that type?

>   the same holds for output

Not really for output since it would be a `dict` subclass. So anything expecting a `dict` would still work.

Hi,

I checked the patchbot reports. I fixed the non-ascii issue. The startup-module report is normal. There are two python3 issue: one in a speed-critical section which we had discussed and decided to be a necessary evil. The other is a false positive (existing cmp in a line of code that was respaced).

Hence positive review!

That's a non-issue. Cython != Python and Cython does support `.iteritems()` for dicts.
