In the case of Laurent Polynonials, the variables are units. So we cannot enforce the unit to live in the base ring. Consider, for instance, the element `2*L^2 + 2*L` in the LaurentPolynomialRing of 1 variable over the integers. Its factorization is `L * 2 * (L+1)`, where:

- `L` is the unit. It doesn't live in the base ring (which is `ZZ`)
- `2` is a factor that happens to live in the base ring, but is not a unit.
- `L + 1` is a factor that doesn't live in the base ring and is not a unit.

As you say, all these `if/else` wouldn't be necessary if the factorization of polynomials would return the unit as an element of the polynomial ring (and hence, they would have a .dict() method that would prevent this bug. My proposal for #20214 would automatically make this patch unnecessary, but it seems that my opinion is not shared by many people there.
