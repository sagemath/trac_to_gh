- `2` is a factor that happens to live in the base ring, but is not a unit.
- `L + 1` is a factor that doesn't live in the base ring and is not a unit.

As you say, all these `if/else` wouldn't be necessary if the factorization of polynomials would return the unit as an element of the polynomial ring (and hence, they would have a .dict() method that would prevent this bug.
