<a id='comment:2'></a>The semantic of `plot` and `show` are different:
- `plot` should return a graphic object
- `show` does actually shows the object (the way it is shown depends on the Sage mode used, i.e. console, notebook, etc)

You can have a look at graphs

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: P = G.plot()   # a plot object
sage: type(P)
<class 'sage.plot.graphics.Graphics'>
sage: R = P.show()   # returns None
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 26 graphics primitives
sage: R is None
True
```
And note that a graphics object as `P` above as a `plot` method (that return itself) and a `show` method that actually shows the graphics.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Here are my comments:

- You have to deprecate `show` if you are going to outright remove it.
- I'm -1 on using `show(P)` in the doctests; IMO it is better to return the plot as it actually gets doctested in a fashion.
- Why this change:
  {{{#!diff
-            sage: g = HyperbolicPlane().PD().random_geodesic()
+            sage: PD = HyperbolicPlane().PD()
+            sage: g = PD.get_geodesic(-0.3+0.4*I,+0.7-0.1*I)
  }}}
  I think the random test is somewhat better. However, I think you should add an additional test with this specific geodesic and give the commands for the user to reproduce your picture.
- Can you explain this change:
  {{{#!diff
-            sage: h = PD.get_geodesic(4/5*I + 3/5, 9/13*I + 6/13)
+            sage: h = PD.get_geodesic(4/5*I + 3/5, I)
  }}}
- Replace `:math:`x<sup>2+y</sup>2-z^2=-1`` with ``x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = -1``.
- I don't understand the point of the comments in the `.. PLOT::` directives. Moreover, the numbering either has no meaning or it will loose meaning as soon as someone adds another plot.

Agreed. I changed the random_geodesic to make consistent and good-looking into the doc. I think you are right, we better move the random_geodesic to the test directive.

Well, better looking picture I guess.
