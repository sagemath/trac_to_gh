LGTM modulo this change:

```diff
-            sage: v = V.list_attributes(); v.sort(); v               # optional - magma
-            ['Coroots', 'Involution', 'M', 'RootDatum', 'Roots', 'StrLocalData', 'T', 'decomp', 'eisen', 'exthom', 'hSplit', 'ip_form', 'p', 'ssbasis', 'weights']
+            sage: v = V.list_attributes(); v.sort()               # optional - magma
+            sage: print(v)     # optional - magma
+            ['Coroots', 'Involution', ..., 'p', 'ssbasis', 'weights']
```
Is there a reason why we don't keep all of them (I don't have magma so I can't check)? Also, the `print` is vacuous to me.

Yes, this is the core of this ticket, making this precise doctest more robust
by allowing some changes in the list of attributes. I ran the doctest on a machine with the latest magma and it was failing because of the presence of two more attributes. The aim of the test is not to check that we are up-to-date with a precise version of magma, but that we can indeed manage to get the attributes from magma itself.
