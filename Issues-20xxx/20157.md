```
Since we want the choice of blas/lapack to be configurable by `.pc` files we need to have `numpy` and `scipy` obey to `pkg-config`.

This is complicated by the fact that `numpy/scipy`'s build system will look for 
 1) mkl
 2) openblas
 3) threaded atlas 3.10.x (tatlas.so)
 4) single thread atlas 3.10.x (satlas.so)
 5) threaded atlas (any versions)
 6) single thread atlas (any versions)
 7) accelerate on OS X
 8) blas/lapack configuration provided by the user
 9) blas/lapack source provided by the user

In that order from (1) to (9). Note that the user's wishes are ignored unless everything else fails. Getting `numpy/scipy` to obey the user wishes, whatever they are, means using not well documented variables to disable the auto-detections steps 1 to 6.

I think there is a small bug (feature) in `numpy` that causes it to only use a single library. I think I now which part of the Gentoo patch deals with that,
