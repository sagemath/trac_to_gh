There is a problem with the copy of the script directory on the server

```
sage: magma=Magma(...) # custom server config
sage: magma('1')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Can't open package spec file ... for reading (No such file or directory)

The solution might be to create the directory remotely if it does not exist. Something like

os.system("ssh SERVE 'mkdir -p THE_GOOD_DIR'")

Indeed, #20388 is merged in the last beta and I was able to use magma.

However

```

sage: I = K.ideal(5)
sage: I._magma_init_(magma)
