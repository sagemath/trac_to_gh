There is a problem with the copy of the script directory on the server

```
sage: magma=Magma(...) # custom server config
sage: magma('1')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Can't open package spec file ... for reading (No such file or directory)
```

The solution might be to create the directory remotely if it does not exist. Something like

```
os.system("ssh SERVE 'mkdir -p THE_GOOD_DIR'")
```

Indeed, #20388 is merged in the last beta and I was able to use magma.

However
