The ticket #22522 makes available a function `sage.interfaces.latte.integrate` that calls the corresponding LattE function. We make this low level function available as a method of polyhedra.

Moreover, we add a new "engine" to the existent `volume` method of Polyhedron, interfacing with `sage.interfaces.latte.integrate`.

this should be "cone decomposition".

`Polyhedron.integrate` should include tests for lower-dimensional polytopes. Those are not supported by latte's integrate. The result should either be 0 - or a proper error should be raised.

wait a moment, because i may have misunderstood:

1- if the polytope is not full-dimensional, but the polynomial is in low dimension, then latte gives an answer wrt to the relative interior, as in:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,0],[1,1]])
sage: from sage.interfaces.latte import integrate as integrate
sage: x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
sage: integrate(P.cdd_Hrepresentation(), 2*x^2 + x - 1, cdd=True)
1/6
```

and we should keep this behaviour. 

2- however, in the situation of a multivariate polynomial in a low-dim polytope it breaks,

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,0],[1,1]])
sage: from sage.interfaces.latte import integrate as integrate
sage: x, y = polygens(QQ, 'x, y')
sage: integrate(P.cdd_Hrepresentation(), 2*x^2 + x - y, cdd=True)
...
SetLength: can't change this vector's length
```

and we should raise an exception.

can you confirm?

Unfortunately, there is no control over what exact transformation LattE applies; and so the input polynomial is meaningless even though it has the correct number of variables.

ok then; commit ec15897 raises exception in both cases.
