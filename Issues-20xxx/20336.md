Current implementation of mq.SBox is still lack of basic functionality to determine various cryptographic properties of an S-Box such as nonlinearity, differential uniformity, etc. This commit implements some of them such as :
1. Computation of nonlinearity and differential uniformity.
2. Determine if the S-Box is an almost bent (AB) / almost perfect nonlinear function (APN).
3. Determine the balancedness of the S-Box.
4. Compute the maximum and minimum algebraic degree of its component function.
5. Obtain the component function.
6. Compute its the differential and linear branch number.
7. Compute its autocorrelation matrix.
8. Obtain linear structures in its component functions.
9. Obtain all fixed points in the S-Box.
10. For an invertible S-Box, obtain its inverse.
21. Determine if the S-Box is a monomial function.

I can't comment to much on the code itself since it is outside of my expertise. However, I can make some comments on formatting:

- Instead of `$` for latex, you should use ```. (We do support the former, but it is not as well-supported as the latter.)
- Instead of `\mathbb{F}_2`, you should use the macro `\GF{2}` for consistency with the rest of Sage.
- Error statements are not sentences, and as such, should not start with a uppercase letter nor have a period. This is also to be consistent with Python.
- The input block should be formatted like this:
  {{{
        - ``b`` -- either an integer or a tuple of `\GF{2}` elements of
          length ``self.n``
  }}}
- Remove the unnecessary parentheses here: `return (self.differential_uniformity() == 2)`.
- It is better to use `\mathrm{wt}` or `\operatorname{wt}` instead of `\text{wt}` (this is a latex thing having to do with spacing rules).
- You should use `.. MATH::` and have the equation indented on a separate line (with a blank line inbetween).
- Try to keep lines less than 80 characters long
- `autocorrelation_matrix` should be a ``@`cached_method`. Also make sure it returns an immutable matrix.
- All parentheses are extraneous here: `if ((m & 1) == 0):`. At least the outer ones are.
- I prefer `EXAMPLES::` even when there is only one example; more maybe added later and this is for consistency.
- In the doc, do ```TypeError```.

Otherwise the doc and coding style looks good. I could try to review the code if no one else steps forward.

Also is this your first contribution to Sage?

Welcome to Sage! This is a very well-done submission.

Now that you are using ``@`cached_method`, you don't need the `_autocorrelation_matrix` attribute and can remove this code:

```
        try:
            return self._autocorrelation_matrix
        except AttributeError:
            pass
```
(similarly for the `linearly_approximation_matrix`).

Martin, will/can you be doing a review of the math parts?
