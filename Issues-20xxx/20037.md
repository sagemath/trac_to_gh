Keywords: latticeposet

Few problems at finite lattices: 1) Operators `+` and `*` for meet and join are not documented, 2) example of `breadth()` is stupid as it just `BoolenaLattice(4)` and 3) `is_supersolvable()` fails for empty lattice. This patch corrects those.

Duh. Done that. Now it is inconsistent with other functions in the file. We should have a style guide for this kind of things.

There is an on-going debate about whether to refer to ```self``` in any docstring (guess what side I am on :P). However you should remove the comma `,` before the `and` to be (English) grammatically correct (as `otherwise ``False``` is not a complete sentence).
