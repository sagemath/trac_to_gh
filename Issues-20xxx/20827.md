Number fields currently have "partial unique representation": they are created by a `UniqueFactory`, but can still compare equal without being identical.  The goal of this ticket is to make number fields inherit from `WithEqualityById`, so that they fully satisfy unique representation: the conditions of being identical, being equal and having the same defining data are all equivalent.  This can be viewed as a follow-up to #11670; see also the comments there.

Apart from this simplification, this fixes a known bug in pickling relative number fields, where the structure used to be lost (see comment:21:ticket:11670).

One more user-visible change is that equality of number fields now depends on the variable name of the defining polynomial:

```
NumberField(polygen(QQ, 'x')^2 + 2, 'a') == NumberField(polygen(QQ, 'y')^2 + 2, 'a')
```
used to return `True`, after this ticket it returns `False`.  In the future, the polynomial variable can perhaps be normalised (either to `x` or to the name of the generator of the number field), so that only one variable name is part of the defining data of a number field.  The above number field could then simply be printed as `Number Field in a defined by a^2 + 2 = 0`.

A very minor point: It took me a while to understand what you meant by “This allows the UniqueFactory to distinguish embeddings into different fields with "the same" image of the generator“: perhaps something like “...with images of the generator that compare equal” would be clearer.
