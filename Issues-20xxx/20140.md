Maybe you are confusing run-time dependencies with build-time dependencies? The `dependencies` files are really only meant for build-time dependencies.

Anyway, this isn't what this ticket is about...

First of all, keep in mind that a test-suite is also considered "build-time". But it could very well be that packages list dependencies which are not strictly required. Usually, the time to build Python packages is negligible, so it's not so important.
