The only reason `jsonschema` has an spkg is sage is because it's a dependency of `nbformat`, but `nbformat` does not list `jsonschema` in its dependencies.

Maybe you are confusing run-time dependencies with build-time dependencies? The `dependencies` files are really only meant for build-time dependencies.

Anyway, this isn't what this ticket is about...
