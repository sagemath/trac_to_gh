<div id="comment:0"></div>

The following code crashes in Sage v7.2 with a ZeroDivisionError:

```
V = FreeModule(Zmod(3^10), 1)
v = V.gen(0)
x = v * v
x.valuation(3)
```
The variable x is just 1 (mod 3<sup>10</sup>), and if you just do ` Zmod(3^10)(1).valuation(3)` it returns 0 (as it should), but creating it via linear algebra in this way seems to somehow return a "broken" integer mod object.

This error only occurs for moduli in a certain interval: between 46342 (~2<sup>15.5</sup>) and 2147483646 (~2<sup>31</sup>). Investigation suggests that `v * v` is getting returned as an `IntegerMod_int` object where it should be an `IntegerMod_int64`; the culprit seems to be the method `_dot_product_` in ` sage/modules/vector_modn_dense.pyx`.
