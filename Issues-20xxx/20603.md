Why `I.sort(); print I` and not `I.sort(); I`? Same with for example `print N[len(dir):]`.

You have usually changed continuation line markers, but not in `print(kwds)` nor in `print(af.fix_to_pos())`.

Shouldn't `print(" ".join(str(i) for i in f))` be `print("".join(str(i) for i in f))`? Same in `src/sage/misc/misc.py`.

I will now compile and test.
