Here is an update of the patchbot.

It should work just as now.

The changes on the client side are:

- cleanup of treatment of options
- new option to disactivate utf8 banner
- change in GIT dates to avoid a git bug

Some of these are efforts towards having patchbots that can run in a virtual machine or a docker container.

Hmm, the owner option will have no visible effect. This information will be stored in the internal reports, in the patchbot server database, but not displayed in the web pages.

So only people with access to the server will be able to see who own the bots.
