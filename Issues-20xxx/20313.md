Here is an update of the patchbot.

It should work just as now.

The changes on the client side are:

- cleanup of treatment of options
- new option to disactivate utf8 banner
- change in GIT dates to avoid a git bug

Some of these are efforts towards having patchbots that can run in a virtual machine or a docker container.

So only people with access to the server will be able to see who own the bots.
