Indeed same kind of work. Much more sophisticated on your part I must say. Do I understand well that you need an executable class for any external binaries that you want to call?

It could also solve the issue that I was thinking about executables and other files requirement. You should be able to find and use something already installed in a standard location. `theta` being already present in `/usr/local/bin` instead of `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` (which resolves to `/usr/bin` in sage-on-gentoo) or anywhere in the `PATH`. Similarly you can install `gap` packages in `~/.gap/pkg` and there is no reasons why you shouldn't be able to use those.

Handling of `database_gap` will be delicate. The spkg includes bits removed stuff from `gap` that are expected by default (no need to load if present) and one "real" gap package that one would need to load (`tomlib`). 

That may require special consideration.

I think this ticket should replace the other one unless you have a plan. I am making a list of stuff that needs to come from the other ticket and stuff that should use your feature detection. I guess we could split it along those lines.

Going through the files that I have changed in #20377 which this ticket should supersede:
* `sage/databases/cremona.py` we need to check the real presence of a file in a specific location in this case. Adding something to feature may be overkill for that particular case.
* `sage/game_theory/normal_form_game.py` + `sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` look for the `lrs` executable
* `sage/graphs/generators/classical_geometries.py` already covered in this ticket
* `sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` I think my stuff should stay. It is mostly straight `try...expect` whether or not a python module is available.
* `sage/graphs/graph_generators.py` 3 different executables to detect
* `sage/graphs/lovasz_theta.py` covered here
* `sage/groups/generic.py` possibly detect if gap package tomlib is present
* `sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py` again dodgy database_gap detection in one part. The part using the gap `hap` package would need a nice rework not just migration. I'd like to pick the mind of the person who wrote this.
* `sage/misc/all.py` my stuff should stay. It is removal of `import` no one uses.

Hi Julian,

Just some rambling, thinking about use cases for this ticket or some follow up:

While discussing with the Debian people, it was stressed out that we
will eventually want to be able to support simultaneously a stable
version of software X (as provided by distributions), and a devel
version of it (e.g. for our researchers that need the very latest
features). Therefore we probably will want to have code that could
look like:

```
        def latest_feature():
            """
            ...

            EXAMPLES::

                sage: X = ...
                sage: X.latest_feature()    # optional gap >= 3.5
            """
            GAP(min_version=3.5).require()      # or some better syntax
            ...
            return gap.latest_feature()
```

To support this use case we would need:

- support for version checking in the Feature code (probably in a follow up ticket).

  Probably not much can be written generically, except possibly for Executables,
  trying to pass the --version and scanning the output for something that looks
  like a version number

- some updates to the doctesting framework to support version
  annotations (definitely in another ticket)

- mapping feature names appearing in the #optional annotations to actual Feature's
  (it's going in this direction in #20182).


Not directly related to this ticket, but building on the discussion we had while walking in Cernay, we may want to be able to write the annotation as::

```
        def latest_feature():
            """
            ...

            .. REQUIRES:: gap >= 3.5

            EXAMPLES::

                sage: X = ...
                sage: X.latest_feature()
            """
```

Cheers,
                           Nicolas

Sure. A followup ticket could define `gap.require_package` as a call out
to `GapPackage().require`.

The docstring tells you that you might want to cache the result if you think it
is a performance problem. Most of the time you are going to call out to a
binary anyway so I do not see the point of caching it as a default. "Premature
optimization is the root of all evil…"
We could centralize the checks. I do not really have an opinion on that.

That's what `is_present` vs `require` is about. There are places where the default algorithm is chosen depending on the
presence of some feature.

So you have to catch whatever RuntimeError instead of being able to catch
something specific? I do not see the advantage of that. Also, if I understand
your proposal, each caller has to cook up their own error message. I think it
is nice to have a central place where these error messages and resolutions
live.
Finally, with your approach you do not get the granularity between `abc is not
on the path` vs `abc is there but does not work`. That's something that some
people requested.

>  - Are you sure `CSDP` is better inside the file `lovasz_theta.py`? Do we

See above.

GapPackage lives in sage.misc.feature. So it should be clear that this is not
the actual package. We can suffix everything with Feature if that is preferred.
I prefer short class names if possible.

See above. (Sorry if I misunderstood you. It seems you are raising the
centralization vs localization issue several times in your comment.)

The idea is Sage agnostic. The features it checks for are of course relatively Sage specific.

> Would it be possible to move this code out of Sage source code? It would better be in `sage/src/sage_setup/` or whatever appropriate (even possibly an external python module). We might want to use it outside of Sage or before Sage is built to track possible dependencies.

I am not sure about moving it to `sage_setup`. We need this at runtime. Can we (and should we?) access things in `sage_setup` at runtime?
It is an interesting idea to make it a separate package. There seems to be no python package around which does anything similar. I would be happy to pursue such a path but would like to postpone this to a followup ticket.

Sorry, but I am not sure whether I understand your question. Do you mean whether a `Magma` Feature should look at `SAGE_MAGMA_COMMAND` and `SAGE_MAGMA_SERVER`? Yes, absolutely.

`sage/databases/cremona.py` loads the cremona DB from a very specific place, namely `SAGE_SHARE`. This is certainly not ideal. But making that code more flexible should imho go into a followup ticket. Should I create one?

Addressed with the `Lrs` feature.

I am checking this now with a `PythonModule` feature.

I am checking for these executables (and run them on trivial inputs.)

I am checking for the presence of the small groups library. Is that the same somehow?

Sure. But I am not addressing this here.

Actually you need to check for the presence of the fes library. Not only that but also whether the sage interface to that library has been built (which only happens if sage can find the library, i.e., SPKG at build time.)

On the other hand, since this is mostly about doctests at this point, a version information is more useful for the user: \"oh, I need to upgrade to 3.5\" is simpler than \"oh, I need to upgrade to a recent enough version that supports method xxx on object yyy\".

Replying to [nthiery](#comment%3A15):
> Yep there is value in the autoconf approach. On the other hand, since this is mostly about doctests at this point, a version information is more useful for the user: "oh, I need to upgrade to 3.5" is simpler than "oh, I need to upgrade to a recent enough version that supports method xxx on object yyy". We could do both: make a feature check, and provide a version number for user reporting; but that's more work.

That's the approach I would like to follow. Currently there is no code like this in here because I am just replacing `is_package_installed` which also did not do any version checks. But, yes, people should check for a certain feature of a package and then the `reason` of a test failure should say "Your X does not support Y." and the `resolution` should say "You need at least version Z of X. Try sage -i X to fix this." or something along these lines.

Since `is_package_installed` is very sage (the distribution) specific, it causes trouble for package managers which would like to refer to check whether a package is available on the local system instead of whether it has been installed with `sage -i` (or similar.)
This replaces all occurrences of `is_package_installed` (which are not part of sage the distribution) with a "feature" check which is performed much in the spirit of autoconf: check for the presence of the features needed, not for version numbers.
These checks are certainly not perfect yet and will need to evolve over time.

For `OptionalModule`, you should separate the library check from the Python module check. They really are independent things. It just happens that there is essentially a one-to-one correspondence in Sage, but that doesn't have to be the case.

And once you do this, you can use the library check in `src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py` to decide which optional extensions to build.

But I would like to tell people what is the problem here. In that particular case, the module also would not import but that's more obscure than telling people that the required library is missing.

> Well, I meant *really* splitting those it up: get rid of `OptionalModule` altogether and replace it by `Module`. And remove the dependencies: if the dependencies are not satisfied, the module will not import. There is no need for an additional check.

Sure, the check is not necessary. But I would like to tell people what is the problem here. In that particular case, the module also would not import but that's more obscure than telling people that the required library is missing. More generally, an `OptionalModule` checks whether the module imports and is functional. Running some tests to make sure that the underlying library is working properly is a reasonable thing to do imho.

The problem is that they need to install the optional Sage package. That's what you should tell.

> In that particular case, the module also would not import but that's more obscure than telling people that the required library is missing.


But the `OptionalModule` machine checks whether the optional Sage package is installed. Having the library available from the OS would not help.

I don't like to put the same information in different places. That way, you will eventually end up with inconsistencies. The information that the module needs the library should be in exactly one place, namely the build system which decides when the module is compiled.

Indeed. The current build system assumes that if the package is installed it is because I explicitly want it in sage. It is a long standing convention which from where I sit on the outside is called automagic detection. The reality is that it belongs to configuration space (with availability checking - autoconf style). Sure it is possibly more risky to use an outside package but if it satisfy the availability checking, why not?

After all, at least some of us want to push sage down that way. 

Also note that for executables `Features` only cares about availability in the path, from sage or not (as it should as far as I am concerned). So not caring whether it is from sage or not is in spirit. 

I'll admit to have a bias since I want most of `sage/misc/package.py` to be gone with a top priority on `is_package_installed` in particular.

Replying to [fbissey](#comment%3A97):
> I am quite happy to have it for run-time only in the first instance. One issue for building is that we are not quite ready to use non sage installed optional package at this stage (i.e. finding optional package not installed by sage).


I'm not sure what you mean exactly by this.  Why should optional packages be a problem as long as this can be useful for non-optional packages?

> Fixing runtime would remove a burden from sage-on-distro, especially the bits depending on `is_package_installed` that we don't want to use in a distro. Build time can be fixed if the distro decides to support a particular option. But ideally we would want something more fine grained. Ideally it would tie up with a proper configuration phase.


Yes, that work is going on in #21566 and other associated tickets.

To be clear, I think we're in agreement that *this ticket* should not handle any tasks directly related to enabling build-time detection of dependencies.  I agree that's a separate issue.  My point is that we should keep that use-case in mind for this ticket insofar as the checks its provides don't depend on having a fully working Sage install already, and that it exists outside the main Sage package.

In other words, this ticket could remain focused on fixing the `is_package_installed` issue, but just keep in mind the other use case that this code could help resolve.

I've in the meantime started moving in a different direction for build-time feature dependency checks, so to me at least my earlier questions about using this for that purpose are moot.  But I'm still +1 on having it for runtime feature checks.

It looks like the patch does not apply so I think you'll have to set this back to needs_work.  I'd be happy to help rebasing your patch if need be.

It looks really good. There are a few files remaining to migrate to "features" not covered here but that's good for a first iteration and will prove that the concept work. One more file should be migrated in this ticket I think, `databases/cremona.py`  because it is the only file that would use `features/databases.py` as it currently stands.

For info the following files have stuff to convert
* coding/linear_code.py
* coding/guava.py
* coding/databases.py
* graphs/generators/smallgraphs.py
* groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py
All of these are about some gap packages.
