Here's a bug:

```
sage: p.<x,y> = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x[0], y[0]
(x_0, x_1)
sage: p.set_max(x, 42)
sage: p.get_max(y[0])
42.0
```
The bug is in `MIPVariable.set_min`, `.set_max`, which calls back into the problem to change the bounds of *all* variables of the problem rather than just its components.
