After #14485 we have

```
sage: NF.<alpha> = NumberField(x^5 + 7*x + 3)
sage: QQbar(alpha**5 + 7*alpha)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: need a real or complex embedding to convert number field
element to algebraic number
```
but rationals are non ambiguous with respect to their embeddings.

I think that you should still have a `try except` statement with an adapted message.

Otherwise the error message will be:

```
TypeError: Unable to coerce alpha to a rational
```

which might end up as "Uh, i know that it is not a rational, i was asking for an algebraic !".
