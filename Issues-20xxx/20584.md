Fixed a couple little things, one of which predated this ticket.

I don't know if there is an established way of guaranteeing that any function/method that takes a regular partition will still work with a 1-regular partition. Barring that, the only criterion are the doctests, right? Everything else LGTM.

Thanks.

No, I don't think there is such a way other than those functions/methods having explicit checks. This is a degenerate case in terms of my applications (there is not really an [affine] sl<sub>1</sub>), so I'm not really worried.
