Since recently, we are using more of the upstream version of `autodoc`. This also has some code to remove hexadecimal address (see #19858) but the regular expression is too strict. This can easily be fixed, see https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/2534.

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.**
