<a id='comment:1'></a>As far as I can see, this happens in vanilla maxima on SBCL too:

```
Maxima 5.36.1 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
using Lisp SBCL 1.2.11-1.fc22
(%i1) integrate(sin(k*x)/x*erf(x^2),x,0,inf);
Maxima encountered a Lisp error:
Control stack exhausted (no more space for function call frames).
```
This is not the latest version, but it's the kind of bug that, unless it's been specifically addressed, it's probably still there. Might want to report it (why is there no online maxima calculator with an up-to-date maxima? maximacell or something like that?)
