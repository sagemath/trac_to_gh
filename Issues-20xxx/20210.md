This is literally just the upgrade of the package.

This contains all changes to the Sage library (mostly changing include paths), except for renaming `sage_malloc` -> `sig_malloc` and similar.

Because `cysignals/memory.pxi` includes `cysignals/signals.pxi` so it's really by transitivity.

I've been working on ticket #14304 which now depends on this ticket.  Since it's been rebased, it now has doctests failing that aren't touched by the ticket.  So I ran all the doctests with just this ticket applied and the following one fails:

That is still true.

However: most of the time this spkg change is implicit when changing branches. When you move from a branch based on one Sage version to a branch based on a different Sage version, chances are high that some spkg has changed between those branches.

> Should I more generally run make?

At least when changing branches, yes. Once you did this and you then make changes only to the Sage library, then `./sage -b` should be sufficient. But run `make` when in doubt.

Note that you can also use `make build` instead of `make` to skip the documentation build which can take a while.
