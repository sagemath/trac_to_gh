<div id="comment:14" align="right">comment:14</div>

At the moment we have:
* Sebastian C code as an optional package,
* my skinny wrapper as a pip installable package.
So the installation procedure is:
* `./sage -i deformation` to install the former
* `./sage -python pip install pydeformation` for the latter (or maybe `./sage -pip ...`)

I'd say it would be nice to make `pydeformation` a sage optional package so that you can use Sage dependency system to just do
* `./sage -i pydeformation` and that it automagically installs the optional `deformation` C library first.

As `deformation` is a C library (of interest without the wrapper), I don't want to ship it within the wrapper, nor would it be a good idea to make it a pip installable thing (to be able to use pip dependency system).

Would it make sense to create a meta package that depends on both of those packages?

You mean a Sage package?
I don't see the point, can you give further details?

Note that when I say a sage optional package for `pydeformation` I really mean just creating a folder in `build/pkg` with simple `spkg-install` script as for cysignals.

Yes, I meant a Sage package.
It was just a quick (and perhaps dirty) way to get deformation and pydeformation in sage.

Anyhow, I have no experience with sage packages. But let me know if there is anything I can do to help you.
