As of Sage 7.3.beta6, building Sage requires a system Python >= 2.7 because `sage-uncompress-spkg` uses `argparse`.

While we already ship a copy of `argparse.py`, `sage-uncompress-spkg` currently doesn't try to import it from where it's located in the Sage tree.

I've advocated bundling argparse (which is imho a no-brainer) but the 0.1% size increase was deemed unacceptable in #19984.

Yep, but that broke the patch because a change happened within its context.  (While there's no branch here yet anyway, it'll have to depend on #20871 now).

Generally, I don't like the philosophy of "try A and if that didn't work, use B instead". It means two different scenarios which can break. If B is always available and it works, why bother with trying A first?

FWIW, I intentionally did *not* import the whole `sage_bootstrap` package just because `sage-uncompress-spkg` in case of Python 2.6 needs the `argparse` module (and only that) from `.../compat/` in my patch.

---

Could you add a `.contains_garbage()` property in order to not pass the whole list of all files in a tarball to `.extractall()` if it returns `False` (which is the normal case -- it should IMHO error out unless given some option to override that otherwise, or *at least* give a warning).

As is, it essentially does

```sh
tar xf $TARBALL $( tar tf $TARBALL | cat )
```
or, worse (and more explicit),

```sh
gunzip -c $TARBALL | tar xf - $( gunzip -c $TARBALL | tar tf - | cat )
```
in the normal (non-error) case, where `gunzip` will be `bunzip2` if `$TARBALL` ends with `.bz2` instead of `.gz`; since you're also building a dictionary, `cat` here doesn't even properly reflect the no-op processing of all filenames in the archive (it would have to be some more complex identity function).

\\

You could in addition rename `.names()` to `.valid_names()` say, and add another function `.invalid_names()` (or `.names()` returning *all* names) or whatever (such that it is possible to obtain the ones filtered out, or at least see whether any files got filtered out, but if we give an error or warning message, that should contain *which* files are considered garbage).

Sure, but I didn't put `argparse` there, which is unrelated to and independent of all the other stuff there.

\\

> I don't mind beautifying the file handling logic, but that doesn't belong to this ticket.

But completely rewriting it (or changing its structure, and adding tests etc.) does?

That's really completely unrelated to Python 2.6 support; if you're referring to the title, all we need *here* is to pick up the `argparse` module.  And it's currently a blocker ticket.

I'd suggest to put your restructuring etc. on a follow-up, where we can improve other things as well (to not say remove further regressions introduced previously).

If the latter still makes it into Sage 7.3, fine, otherwise it doesn't hurt because the main issue has already been fixed here -- quickly and safe.

At least they're not directly tested by `ptestlong` (which passed for me):

```sh
$ ./sage -t --long build/test/
...

No, they aren't meant to be run with the Sage doctest runner. They are meant to execute under tox, which is also ideally suited to run against multiple python versions (see tox.ini):

```
cd build
tox
```
