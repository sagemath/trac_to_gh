As of Sage 7.3.beta6, building Sage requires a system Python >= 2.7 because `sage-uncompress-spkg` uses `argparse`.

While we already ship a copy of `argparse.py`, `sage-uncompress-spkg` currently doesn't try to import it from where it's located in the Sage tree.

there is demand for Python 2.6 support. It should be easy to set up a VM with one of these LTS Linux systems which are using 2.6 as the default. The question is who will do this, and on what system. There is spare capacity on the UW cluster, I think, to do this.

I rather meant to ask whether it's only the above little change we need, but I've meanwhile built Sage 7.3.beta6 from scratch with that on a system with just Python 2.6, which worked without any issues.  (`argparse.py` already gets shipped in `build/sage_bootstrap/compat/` anyway.)

So now the question is whether I should put a branch *here* or open a separate ticket specifically for `sage-uncompress-spkg` as the ticket's title sounds pretty generic (as if it was meant to be a meta-ticket).

FWIW, I intentionally did *not* import the whole `sage_bootstrap` package just because `sage-uncompress-spkg` in case of Python 2.6 needs the `argparse` module (and only that) from `.../compat/` in my patch.

---

Could you add a `.contains_garbage()` property in order to not pass the whole list of all files in a tarball to `.extractall()` if it returns `False` (which is the normal case -- it should IMHO error out unless given some option to override that otherwise, or *at least* give a warning).

As is, it essentially does

```sh
tar xf $TARBALL $( tar tf $TARBALL | cat )
```
or, worse (and more explicit),

```sh
gunzip -c $TARBALL | tar xf - $( gunzip -c $TARBALL | tar tf - | cat )
```
in the normal (non-error) case, where `gunzip` will be `bunzip2` if `$TARBALL` ends with `.bz2` instead of `.gz`; since you're also building a dictionary, `cat` here doesn't even properly reflect the no-op processing of all filenames in the archive (it would have to be some more complex identity function).

\\

You could in addition rename `.names()` to `.valid_names()` say, and add another function `.invalid_names()` (or `.names()` returning *all* names) or whatever (such that it is possible to obtain the ones filtered out, or at least see whether any files got filtered out, but if we give an error or warning message, that should contain *which* files are considered garbage).

Sure, but I didn't put `argparse` there, which is unrelated to and independent of all the other stuff there.

\\

> I don't mind beautifying the file handling logic, but that doesn't belong to this ticket.


But completely rewriting it (or changing its structure, and adding tests etc.) does?

That's really completely unrelated to Python 2.6 support; if you're referring to the title, all we need *here* is to pick up the `argparse` module.  And it's currently a blocker ticket.

I'd suggest to put your restructuring etc. on a follow-up, where we can improve other things as well (to not say remove further regressions introduced previously).

If the latter still makes it into Sage 7.3, fine, otherwise it doesn't hurt because the main issue has already been fixed here -- quickly and safe.
