Bernadette Perrin-Riou reports two bugs:

One is that this does not work

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("91b")
sage: h = E.padic_height(7,10)
```

The other is that the 2-adic L-series takes gamma to be 1+2 rather than 1+4.

Component: **elliptic curves**

Keywords: **padic BSD, padic height**

Here is first step, for the padic_height.

I am not able to know what to do for gamma.
