This ticket is to take care of a few overlooked minor enhancements for projective morphisms

- quotient rings for dynatomic polynomial overlooks the NotImplementedError, so does not work

- you cannot pass a single point into all_rational_preimages

- the weil restriction for preperiodic points for number fields, was not also implemented for the rational_periodic_points function

- neither rational_preperodic_points nor rational_periodic_points accepts the ncpus kwd
