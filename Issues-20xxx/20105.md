I see. Expansion of the difference does not detect the partial fraction stuff going on there. In that case its probably better to wait for #19040 instead of submitting a fix in pynac.

I think that the more interesting question is whether the partial fraction stuff is also resolved with the ticket.

The pynac pull request and this ticket are then duplicates/wontfixes.

False
sage: (x^2 - 1 - (x+1)*(x-1) != 0).holds()
False
