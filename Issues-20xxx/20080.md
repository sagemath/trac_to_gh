**Overview of Sphinx custom code in Sage's documentation build system**

The goal of this ticket is to write an overview of the various bits and pieces of custom Sphinx code in Sage, with the long term goal to see which pieces could be:
- thrown away, using features that are now in Sphinx
- generalized and submitted upstream
- cleaned up

Here is a list of files with their relative roles:

**src/sage/docs**

- `__init__.py`: empty file

- `conf.py`: standard Sphinx configuration file.

**src/sage_docbuild** (was `src/sage_setup/docbuild`)

- `__init__.py`: top-level docbuilder, contains classes for the various documents (e.g. reference manual).

- `__main__.py`: stub entry point for `sage --docbuild`, calls `main()` from `__init__.py`

- `build_options.py`: Parse the option for building.

- `sphinxbuild.py`: Sage's version of the sphinx-build script

   mainly deals with logging and error reporting.

**src/sage_docbuild/ext** (was `src/sage_setup/docbuild/ext`)


- `inventory_builder.py`:

    A customized HTML builder which only generates intersphinx "object.inv"
    inventory files and pickle files. The documentation files are not written.
    This is supposed to be used with multidocs below.

- `multidocs.py`:

    The goal of this extension is to manage a multi documentation in Sphinx.
    To be able to compile Sage's huge documentation in parallel, the
    documentation is cut into a bunch of independent documentations called
    "subdocs", which are compiled separately. There is a master document which
    points to all the subdocs. The intersphinx extension ensures that the
    cross-link between the subdocs are correctly resolved. However some work
    is needed to build a global index. This is the goal of multidocs.

    More precisely this extension ensures the correct merging of

        1. the todo list if this extension is activated;
        2. the python indexes;
        3. the list of python modules;
        4. the javascript index;
        5. the citations.

- `sage_autodoc.py`

    This is a patched version of sphinx.ext.autodoc, which started to diverge
    before 2011. As far as I (Florent) understand, the role here is to

        1. allows to correctly fetch the Cython doc and argspec
        2. get correctly the argspec of callable (from the `_sage_argspec_`
           attribute) #9976
        3. deals correctly with LazyImport #17455
        4. In particular document CachedFunction as a function and not a class
           instance #9976.
        5. correctly handles classe aliases and nested classed #7448 #5986

    This file probably need to be completely reworked since Sphinx seems to
    have now various plugin and Mixin.

**src/sage/misc**

- `sphinxify.py`

    script which calls Sphinx to format a single docstring for help from the
    command line or the notebook. Has its own configuration.

I would like to mention `sphinxify.py` which is currently part of `sagenb` but should be moved to inside `sage` proper ASAP. `sphinxify` is called from `sage/misc/sagedoc.py` both at doc building time and run time.
