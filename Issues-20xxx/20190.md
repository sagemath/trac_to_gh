I could not build it on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS by applying this on top of `7.1.rc0` and running `make build`. Log is attached.

My guess is it is related to the fuzz from applying the patches.

Compilation on my machine(s) does not follow the same path as on yours. My compilation never reaches the point where yours goes.

I do not (yet) understand qwhy. Different installed software ?

<a id='comment:12'></a>Replying to myself :

This is indeed an upstream bug. See the `r-devel` thread starting at [this posting](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2016-March/072447.html) : it's ultimately a Makefile typo.

However, this thread [says](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2016-March/072449.html) that :

> Notice that in 3.3.x, the included xz & al. will disappear.


This might mean that the prerequisites for `R` may change at 3.3.0 time (which was announced to take place on 2016-04-11 last time I looked...).

Furthermore, `r-devel` also had this announcement (that I missed) :

> The 3.2.4 release had two annoyances which we would rather not have in an "ultra-stable" release, designed to hang around for the duration of the 3.3 series. One was a relatively minor Makefile issue affecting system using R's bundled lzma library. The other, rather more serious, affected printing and formatting of POSIXlt objects, which would unpredictably get the Daylight Savings Time wrong.


A new tarball fixing this issue in 3.2.4 (+ another relevant to Posix time printing) has been released as [http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.2.4-revised.tar.gz](http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.2.4-revised.tar.gz).

So it seems to me that the best "interim" solution is :
* to get the "revised" tarball from CRAN
* to document its renaming in `spkg-src`

and to revise the whole situation at R 3.3.0 release.

Unless I hear contrary opinions before Sun April 3, 2016, I'll do that (and also fix the patches fuzz, which is not incorrect but unaesthetic...).

Your opinions/advice urgently required...

<a id='comment:18'></a>I'm wondering how to do this : upstream has adopted a curious name for this release ; furthermore, it has done it inconsistently :

* the tarball is named `R-3.2.4-revised`, but
* the source tree is named `R-revised`.

Sage's build system chokes on this ; short of renaming the tarball and/or rebuilding it with a sensible source tree name, I don't see how to get Sage's building system accept this.

We can either :

* rename/rebuild this tarball consistently //via// spkg-src, or
* skip this one-week wonder entierely (last time I looked, R 3.3.0 was scheduled in Apr 11, 2016).

Your thoughts ?

Nope : `src` is a subdirectory of the source tree. The point is that the source tree name is nowhere to be seen in `spkg-install` : the current Sage building architecture is supposed to create a build directory for that.

It currently fails to do this in a useable way (see the top of the log).

Nope : the error at the top of the log happens **before** the start of `spkg-install`. `spkg-install` **cannot** intercept it.

And, again, the `src` names designates the directory `src` of the source tree (which should be called `R-3.2.4-revised` and **not** `R-revised`), and **not** the source tree itself.

I tried :
* changing `cd src` to `cd R-revised/src`
* adding (at the top of `spkg-src`) `ln -s R-revised R-3.2.4-revised`
to no avail.

The only way out I'm able to see would be to document in `spkg-src` :
* untar `R-3.2.4-revised.tar.gz`
* in the resulting tree, `mv R-revised R-3.2.4-revised`
* retar the resulting tree

Do you **really** want that ?

I do not know the Sage build system well enough to understand what is really needed to fix it. Short of fixing the (inconsistent) source tree, I see no way.

Since R.3.3.0 release (which may entail significant work) is less tan one week away, I'm a bit reluctant to produce a patch that will become irrelevant so soon...

Huh ! I think that the fix is as trivial (and as mysterious) as the preceding one.

I tried it, but I can't seemingly test it. Whereas in my "develop" (7.2beta2 IIRC) setup, testing (of the current R-3.2.3) goes well, it does not start in this branch, which is based on 7.1rc0 :

After `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES="yes" ./sage -f -c r`, the build system rebuilds the packages, and says it has been built successfully. It does **NOT** attempt to test anything, nor does give an error (see uploaded log).

Nevertheless, I pushed the resulting patch (since it lo longer raises an error in the test suite...) and positioned `needs_review`. Feel free to send me to hell if you think that this cover-up is not acceptable.
