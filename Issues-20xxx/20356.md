Python's builtins such as `str`, `set`, `frozenset` used to be documented as functions instead of as classes. We had a workaround for that which is no longer working for `object`, `str`, and many of the issues have already been solved at Python's level.

See for examples the base classes that are broken for the two following classes:

[WordGenerator](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/words/word_generators.html#sage.combinat.words.word_generators.WordGenerator)
[lazy_format](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/lazy_format.html?highlight=lazy%20format#module-sage.misc.lazy_format)

Unfortunately, it's still needed for tuples:

[shard_order](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/shard_order.html)

The overall situation seems to be unclear from the Python side,
