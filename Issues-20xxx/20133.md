Admittedly, it sounds like a good idea. I guess it should be a new file otherwise `env.py` will end up being a dumping ground. But when you talk about `blas` in particular it is true that we have a straight duplication between `cython.py` and `module_list.py` (even in my original version in sage-on-gentoo). 

On the other hand I am not sure why in your use case you couldn't use the `.pc` files directly. 

Of course that could be more convenient but I have a feeling it is on the slippery slope of putting the kitchen sink into sage.

```
you must put them in the `.pxd` files, not in `module_list.py`. The reason is that there are a lot more extensions than the ones in `sage/gsl/*.pyx` which use the gsl library. If you add those dirs and includes to the gsl `.pxd` files, then all extensions using gsl will automatically have the correct flags added.

This currently applies only to gsl, since all other libraries that you changed are listed directly in `module_list.py`.

In that case, just leave GSL alone in this branch: either do it right or don't do it at all.

Fine it is a bug. But if we are drinking that kool-aid, we'll have to also drink Jeroen's kool-aid about `.pxd` files. Otherwise it would be like "having your cake and eat it too" as the English would say.

And apologies for missing one last bit of my old patch to that doctest.

In the case of GSL, the library declarations are already migrated to `.pxd` files. So, if you want to fine-tune these declarations (by adding `library_dirs` for example), those fine-tuned declarations should also be in `.pxd` files. Otherwise it's a mess and we're worse off than before.

Concretely, this should be reverted:

Jeroen, I can see that some distutils stuff is indeed already present for `sage/libs/gsl/*.pxd` files, but there is nothing for `sage/gsl/*.pxd` should I regularise that as well or is there something I am missing (like why is there `sage/libs/gsl/` and `sage/gsl/`)?
