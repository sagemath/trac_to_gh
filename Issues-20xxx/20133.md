<a id='comment:8'></a>I think there is more to do in `cython.py`. In sage-on-gentoo I added a `libdir` in the output of `pyx_preparse` to take into account potential `blas/lapack` outside of sage.

Which means I had also to add it in `cython`, the extra stuff look like this

<a id='comment:12'></a>Admittedly, it sounds like a good idea. I guess it should be a new file otherwise `env.py` will end up being a dumping ground. But when you talk about `blas` in particular it is true that we have a straight duplication between `cython.py` and `module_list.py` (even in my original version in sage-on-gentoo). 

On the other hand I am not sure why in your use case you couldn't use the `.pc` files directly. 

Of course that could be more convenient but I have a feeling it is on the slippery slope of putting the kitchen sink into sage.

Fine it is a bug. But if we are drinking that kool-aid, we'll have to also drink Jeroen's kool-aid about `.pxd` files. Otherwise it would be like "having your cake and eat it too" as the English would say.

And apologies for missing one last bit of my old patch to that doctest.

In the case of GSL, the library declarations are already migrated to `.pxd` files. So, if you want to fine-tune these declarations (by adding `library_dirs` for example), those fine-tuned declarations should also be in `.pxd` files. Otherwise it's a mess and we're worse off than before.

Concretely, this should be reverted:

```diff
-    Extension('*', ['sage/gsl/*.pyx']),
+    Extension('*', ['sage/gsl/*.pyx'],
+              library_dirs = gsl_library_dirs,
+              include_dirs = gsl_include_dirs),
```

Jeroen, I can see that some distutils stuff is indeed already present for `sage/libs/gsl/*.pxd` files, but there is nothing for `sage/gsl/*.pxd` should I regularise that as well or is there something I am missing (like why is there `sage/libs/gsl/` and `sage/gsl/`)?
