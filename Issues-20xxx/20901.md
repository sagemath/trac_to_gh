New upstream archive: http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/bliss/bliss-0.73.zip (we have 0.72)

Upstream bliss does not have a proper build system (in particular no 'make install').
"spkg-install" installs header files with generic names such as "graph.hh" flat into $SAGE_LOCAL/include/

Debian has https://packages.debian.org/sid/math/bliss
which autotoolizes the package and adjust the include file location.
This matches where Polymake (#20892) expects the header files.

On https://github.com/mkoeppe/bliss in branch `sage_package` I have applied the Debian patches and a few more patches for Sage. The `spkg-src` script clones from there and builds a distribution. The result is available here: 

tarball: https://github.com/mkoeppe/bliss/releases/download/sage_package%2F0.73%2Bdebian-1%2Bsage-2016-08-02/bliss-0.73.debian-1.sage-2016-08-02.tar.gz (rename to `bliss-0.73+debian-1+sage-2016-08-02.tar.gz`)

A shared library, proper include files location, and as a result works as a prerequisite for polymake.
New upstream version -- but upstream is silent about what has changed compared to 0.72.

OK, I've changed it to using upstream + a patch.
Unfortunately our patches cannot be as elegant as Debian's because we cannot rely on the availability of autotools. So my patch has to ship the whole autogenerated build system.

OK, I renamed the tarball, and was able to run `sage -i bliss`, but the following make fails:
