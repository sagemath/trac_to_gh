New upstream archive: http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/bliss/bliss-0.73.zip (we have 0.72)

Upstream bliss does not have a proper build system (in particular no 'make install').
"spkg-install" installs header files with generic names such as "graph.hh" flat into $SAGE_LOCAL/include/

Debian has https://packages.debian.org/sid/math/bliss
which autotoolizes the package and adjust the include file location.
This matches where Polymake (#20892) expects the header files.

On https://github.com/mkoeppe/bliss in branch `sage_package` I have applied the Debian patches and a few more patches for Sage. The `spkg-src` script clones from there and builds a distribution. The result is available here: 

tarball: https://github.com/mkoeppe/bliss/releases/download/sage_package%2F0.73%2Bdebian-1%2Bsage-2016-08-02/bliss-0.73.debian-1.sage-2016-08-02.tar.gz (rename to `bliss-0.73+debian-1+sage-2016-08-02.tar.gz`)

A shared library, proper include files location, and as a result works as a prerequisite for polymake.
New upstream version -- but upstream is silent about what has changed compared to 0.72.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A9):
> The usual way to ship packages in Sage is to start from the original unmodified sources and then apply patches (either at packaging time or at build time). Here, you are instead forking upstream for no clear reason.

OK, I've changed it to using upstream + a patch.
Unfortunately our patches cannot be as elegant as Debian's because we cannot rely on the availability of autotools. So my patch has to ship the whole autogenerated build system.

<div id="comment:22" align="right">Comment 22</div>

there is something funny with tarball name: if I do  sage -i bliss it looks for `bliss-0.73+debian-1+sage-2016-08-02.tar.gz`, while wget with your URL gives `bliss-0.73.debian-1.sage-2016-08-02.tar.gz`.

OK, I renamed the tarball, and was able to run `sage -i bliss`, but the following make fails:

```

It's a limitation of github, it renames `+` to `.`
