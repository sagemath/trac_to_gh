Currently there is a `multiplicity()` function for algebraic curves which computes the multiplicity of a point on a curve as the multiplicity of the maximal ideal in the local ring of the curve corresponding to that point. This definition still works for arbitrary projective/affine subschemes and it would be good to implement it in the more general case.

Also, by using affine patches, it is possible to compute multiplicities and intersection multiplicities of points of subschemes of products of projective spaces, so it would be good to implement that here as well.

These implementations should be made available to both the subscheme classes and corresponding point classes.

I see just a couple minor things here.

In the descriptions: It is the multiplicity of the point, not the subscheme. For example 'Return the multiplicity of the codomain of this point at this point.' would be better as 'Return the multiplicity of this point in its codomain.' This occurs in a number of places.

Also, the example I tried in 20811 which you used here was actually not quite what I had in mind. It is better with

```
G = PP.subscheme([(x^2 - 2*y^2)*v - y^2*u])
```
then you can (and should) describe it as finding the fixed points of `z^2-2`.
