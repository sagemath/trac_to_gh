Currently sage adds two patches on top of cython 0.23.4.p0.  One of them is upstream but not yet in a release, the other one was, as I understand it, rejected by cython upstream.
As far as I can tell, both can be rather cheaply avoided, allowing to build sage with an unpatched release version of cython.
