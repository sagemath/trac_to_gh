Currently sage adds two patches on top of cython 0.23.4.p0.  One of them is upstream but not yet in a release, the other one was, as I understand it, rejected by cython upstream.
As far as I can tell, both can be rather cheaply avoided, allowing to build sage with an unpatched release version of cython.

This Cython patch is needed to support cross-package `include` statements. The current plan is to remove those `include` statements. Then Sage will build without that patch. I have been working on this, the last remaining piece is #23195.
