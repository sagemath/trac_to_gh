Update some patches so that *all* patches to spkgs are applied with `patch -p1` from the root of the upstream source.
    
There were only a handful of oddballs in this regard:

* cddlib
* gfan
* pygments
    
(In the case of pygments the patches were formatted correctly, but were being applied *before* `cd src/` instead of after.)

Standardizing this across all spkgs is a prerequisite to moving forward on #20692, where we decided it would be good to run patch automatically on every spkg by default.
