Currently, `_sage_src_lines_()` is used both to get the source lines of a class (e.g. dynamic classes) and an instance (e.g. cached functions). We change this to always mean the source lines of an instance. This makes things clearer and removes a hack involving `getattr_from_other_class()` (see #20686).
