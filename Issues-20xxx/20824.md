There is no reason why there should be different results:

```
sage: (x*(x*y+y^2)).coefficient(x)
y
sage: (x*(x*y+y^2)).coefficient(x,2)
0
sage: (x*(x*y+y^2)).expand().coefficient(x)
y^2
sage: (x*(x*y+y^2)).expand().coefficient(x,2)
y
```
This would also be unsurprising for Mma users, see [#9505 comment:6](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9505#comment:6)

Maybe add keyword `expand=True`.

I had a look at the patch:

- It looks like `r` is assigned in the `try` block but then not returned or called afterwards. Is this necessary? (I haven't completely digested the pynac interface so I may be missing something, but this looks strange...)
- Should this be added to `coefficients` as well?
- The indentation to `TESTS:` in the docstring was changed accidentally.
