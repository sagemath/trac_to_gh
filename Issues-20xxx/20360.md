The COIN backend needs `sig_on`, `sig_off` throughout so that bounds errors do not crash Sage.

```
sage: p = get_solver(solver = "Coin")
sage: p.is_variable_continuous(1234567)
True
sage: p.add_linear_constraint([(123, 456.7)], None, 0)
... 
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
```

Another one, from #20326:

```
sage: coeffs = ([0, vector([1, 2])], [1, vector([2, 3])])
sage: upper = vector([5, 5])
sage: lower = vector([0, 0])
sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
sage: p = get_solver(solver = "Coin")       # optional - cbc
sage: p.add_linear_constraint_vector(2, coeffs, lower, upper)
```

I don't think this is a matter of adding `sig_on`/`sig_off`. Letting a program segfault and then catching the segfault is not a proper way of handling errors.

You should just check invalid input before calling COIN.

That being said, it might still be a good idea to add the `sig_on`/`sig_off` but not as a substitute for input checking.

IMHO it's rather the backend's task (and that's more pythonic, if you ask me). They should check for such things, and perhaps
they will fix it at some point.
