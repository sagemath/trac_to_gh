It would be nice to have a counter showing how many test has already run, or how many is left. For example changing

```
cmd = "sage -t"
```

to

```
cmd = "Test %s/%s: "%(self.sources_completed+1, len(self.controller.sources))+" sage -t"
```

or something like that in `src/sage/doctest/reporting.py`. Hopefully someone who knows the framework can catch this.
