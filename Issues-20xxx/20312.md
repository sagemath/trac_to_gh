Some Python objects as function arguments lose their parent, i.e. the code in the specific function can no longer access it because the object was coerced into SR. This can result in violation of the rule that function input and output should be of the same type.

```
sage: S.<y> = PolynomialRing(RR)
sage: ex = sin(asin(y)); ex
y
sage: type(ex)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: ex.is_symbol()
True
```
The specific function (here sin) code cannot remedy this because there the damage is already done. The problem is in `symbolic/function.pyx:BuiltinFunction.__call__` where the parent of function arguments is lost.

See also #18832 and maybe #17790.

It looks like the first version here can handle the binomial example of #20060 as well as the symbolic poly functions.

This does not work however with the title example because there the functions are nested. Since it seems we cannot decide where in a nested expression the specific element is whose parent we want to preserve I tend to exclude the nested case.
