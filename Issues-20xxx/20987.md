Fix a bit of slight sloppiness in variable usage.

The `'atlas' in libs` line should really be `'atlas' in libraries`
This was still working due to Python's loop variable leakage, but
from the logic it's clear that the `libraries` variable was intended
to be used here.

I can't remember whether this actually caused a bug or not. I don't think so though.
