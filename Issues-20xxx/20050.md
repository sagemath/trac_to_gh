The asymptotics package should be expanded to include asymptotics of the type `z->z_0` without workarounds (such as setting `T=1/(z-z_0)`).

Then
* singularity analysis should use this format for singular expansions (#19944, #20040)
* Singular expansion for implicitly defined function should use this format (#23872)
