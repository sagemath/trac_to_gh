The asymptotics package should be expanded to include asymptotics of the type `z->z_0` without workarounds (such as setting `T=1/(z-z_0)`).

Then
* singularity analysis should use this format for singular expansions (#19944, #20040)
* Singular expansion for implicitly defined function should use this format (#23872)

I opened this ticket so that we may track issues which may be solve once this here is done. However, this does *not* mean that I plan to work on this in the near future.
