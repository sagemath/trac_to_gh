When building an spkg the upstream tarball is unpacked into the temporary build directory, and then with a 'hack' [here http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/bin/sage-spkg?h=develop&id=769ff190413123f3b0c21a16ea69c63e3f99c43a#n537] to try to figure out what directory the tarball is extracted to, and then rename it to `src`.  This doesn't always work for all packages, and in some packages they get extracted to something else, leading to inconsistencies in `spkg-installs`.  It would be nice if the upstream source can always be found in `src`.

This idea came about in the discussion in #20692 starting around here: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20692#comment:18

This adds one more small step toward more consistency between spkgs.

It might also be worth clarifying in the documentation that (as of this patch) the upstream source should always wind up in `src/`.
