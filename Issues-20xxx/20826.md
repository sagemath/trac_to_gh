```
If a number field is equipped with structural morphisms, these are lost when applying the functorial construction of the number field (via `NumberField.construction()` and `AlgebraicExtensionFunctor`), which happens for example in the construction of push-outs:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 3)
sage: L0.<b> = K.change_names()
sage: L0.structure()
(Isomorphism given by variable name change map:
   From: Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 3
   To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 3,
 Isomorphism given by variable name change map:
   From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 3
   To:   Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 3)
sage: L1 = (b*x).parent().base_ring()
sage: L1.structure()
(Ring Coercion endomorphism of Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 3,
 Ring Coercion endomorphism of Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 3)
```
This currently does not cause too much trouble because the two fields (with and without the structural morphisms) are considered equal, although they are not identical:

```
sage: L1 is L0
False
sage: L1 == L0
True
```
However, this becomes a nuisance when implementing "equality is identity" for number fields on ticket #20827.
