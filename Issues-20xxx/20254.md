There are a few issues about p-adic L-function for elliptic curves. One is that the coefficient ring of supersingular series should be an p-adic Eisenstein field rather than a quotient field.

Oh, there is a lot to do, I discovered. 
The #20244 will be independent as I will call extension directly rather than `root_field`.

The main issue is the normalisation for p-adic L-function involving negative modular symbols. They are used when a quadratic twist is used and that happens even for `E.sha().an_padic(p)`. I am close to resolving this.

The major outstanding issue that I will not change here is #4656 which makes some coefficients (with negative precision sometimes) disappear from the series.

This is ready for review.

Apart from cosmetic changes in documentation and code, this does the following

* The negative modular symbols are now correctly normalised. `[r]^-` is the quotient of the imaginary part of `2 pi i int_oo^0 f(z)dz` by the imaginary part of the period on the imaginary axis with smallest positive imaginary part.

* The output of a `series` for a supersingular p-adic L-function is now an element in the Eisenstein ring generated by the root of the Frobenius polynomial. In particular, they are printed alpha-adically.
