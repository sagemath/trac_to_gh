Update the spkg to upstream 1.2.2-95

The giac tarball built from spkg-src to put in upstream/ is there:

http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/sage/giac-1.2.2.95.tar.bz2

Switch to .bz2 as wished in #18826

add --disable-ao in spkg-install to avoid libao dependency.
remove the --disable-gmpxx in spkg-install. The built seems not broken anymore.

updtate giacpy to 0.6 doctest fix + change of name to giacpy_sage.
The tarball to put in upstream is:
http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/giacpy/sage/giacpy_sage-0.6.tar.gz

The modifications about giacpy are there:
https://gitlab.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/han/giacpy-sage


The 1.2.2.85 version of giac should fix a race condition in icas that could appear during the test suite.

Keywords: giac

its done.

I need to test more. Ex:

```
Failed example:
[giacpy-0.5.6]     f=1/(5+cos(4*x));f.int(x)
[giacpy-0.5.6] Expected:
[giacpy-0.5.6]     1/2/(2*sqrt(6))*(atan(2*tan(4*x/2)/sqrt(6))+pi*floor(4*x/2/pi+1/2))
[giacpy-0.5.6] Got:
[giacpy-0.5.6]     1/2/(2*sqrt(6))*(atan((-sqrt(6)*sin(4*x)+2*sin(4*x))/(sqrt(6)*cos(4*x)+sqrt(6)-2*cos(4*x)+2))+4*x/2)

Yes I can do a simple thing that will work in sage as it works on gentoo since we have .pc files for blas/lapack. Probably won't work for parisse.

Actually the current configuration will work on OS X I think and it is ok not to disable it as the runtime involved comes with the OS.

What is the last bit of `spkg-inst` supposed to do?

```
# create the script_subdirectory for the pexpect giac interface by running a trivial instruction
sage -c "giac(1)"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error running the pexpect interface of giac"
    exit 1
fi
```
Where is the directory supposed to be created? I cannot see anything new when I run `./sage -p giac` with this branch. I was, possibly, expecting something in `local/share/sage/ext` but found nothing there.
Running `./sage -c "giac(1)"` manually afterwards didn't have an impact either.

Indeed It looks obsolete. may by since #17044. Moreover I think that it is the only dependency of SAGE_RUNTIMES cf #19672 comment 6 and jeroen answer. I am trying to remove both.
