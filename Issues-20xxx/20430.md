I am using sage 6.8 and got the following result

```
sage: t = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5], [4], [5]]
sage: s = SemistandardTableau(t)
sage: RSK_inverse( s, s, 'matrix' )
[0 0 2 2 0]
[0 0 0 1 3]
[2 0 0 1 1]
[2 2 0 0 0]
[0 2 2 0 0]
```

This can't be correct as the result must be a symmetric matrix.

sage: t = SemistandardTableau([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2], [2], [3]])
sage: RSK_inverse(t,t, "array")

we see that the array is not in lexicographic order.  Maybe that's part of the problem.
