I propose you to return a `Sequence` with `universe=self`. 

Another (minor) point: If the elements in the sequence do not belong to `self`, the exception is not very clear. For instance:

```python
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: QQ.gcd_free_basis([x+1,x+2])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```

You may catch the exception and raise your own `TypeError: the elements you provided do not belong to QQ` (or something similar). Actually I ran into the exact example I paste above...

Apart from this remarks, this looks good to me!

I would prefer another ticket: As it is, if you remove the commits about `Sequence()`, I am ready to set it to positive review. I am much less confident on the code involving `Sequence` and need more time (or another reviewer...)!

A comment still on the `Sequence()` part: Should'nt the error message explicitly mention that there is a conflict with the universe? Something like 
`unable to convert {} to an element of the universe ({})".format(x[i], universe))`

I don't think so: when `Sequence()` is used internally by another function (e.g. in the present case), it will be clear that the function needs to somehow convert some elements to a given parent, but it doesn't matter that this parent is the universe of some Sequence (and that may even make the error more confusing to casual users)...
