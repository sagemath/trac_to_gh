As you wish.

But now for orthogonality we should add `certificate`s to other functions too. Which is not a bad idea at all, at least for demonstration purposes (really show the pentagon for non-modular lattice etc.). I could start with `complements()`, but then someone should first review #20727 that corrects a trivial bug.

Travis, I reformatted the input-output -blocks like in #20972 (btw, thanks for review).

Doc LGTM.

I would have the certificate be one object. It couples the output together and allows the user to have a more standard API of `result, cert = P.certificate_returning_method()`.

> I would have the certificate be one object. It couples the output together and allows the user to have a more standard API of `result, cert = P.certificate_returning_method()`.


OK, done that.

Warning to reviewer: last patch is blind-coded as I work in a very slow machine now.

(After all these `*complememt*`-function we should think about `SEEALSO`-blocks. But for now we have at least #20817 still in queue.)

It depends. Certificate for the dimension of a poset is a list of linear extensions and for breadth of a lattice a list of elements.

For `is_dismantlable` there is both positive and negative certificate: a dismantling order or a crown subposet.

But I think there are also functions so that they always return a tuple whose first element is a Boolean value.

If it's not particular consistent/canonical, then I'm ok with it the way it is.

Under `OUTPUT`, I think the two possibilities for `certificate` should be separate bullet points, and the default possibility (`certificate=False`) should be listed first.

I also don't especially like the usage of `e` and `e_` as variable names, but don't really have a justifiable reason to make you change it.

Otherwise, it looks good.

Or maybe we are now making the standard. Sometimes there might exists a "yes"-certificate, sometimes "no"-certificate, and sometimes both. Hence we can not have strictly unified interface. Always returning a tuple with Boolean value in first position is most close we can do.

> Under `OUTPUT`, I think the two possibilities for `certificate` should be separate bullet points, and the default possibility (`certificate=False`) should be listed first.


Arghs. Whatever, as long as it is consistent.

If they can't be separate bullet points, can we at least have the default/simpler/more commonly used option listed first? 

It might be a bit more direct to simply combine the information about input and output into the `INPUT` the way `dimension()` does

```
  INPUT:

   * "certificate" (boolean; default:"False") -- whether to return
     an integer (the dimension) or a certificate, i.e. a smallest set
     of linear extensions.
