This ticket adds two thematic tutorials that cover the following topics:

* using (combinatorial) free modules
* constructing and manipulating new modules/vector spaces
* adding more algebraic structure
* defining morphisms
* defining coercions and conversions
* algebraic structures with several realizations

The material was developed at the occasion of a series of tutorials
given during Sage Days.

See also #16810.

Thanks Fr√©d√©ric for the comments.

I have fixed the prints by mostly removing them; it's actually more readable.

I haven't touched the lazy import yet. Sorry Sage is broken on my machine since I upgraded its OS, and I can't test things out. Will do soon!

Done. Andrew: can you throw in your template? I'll then add a few explanations about it, and then this should be ready for final review.

Andrew, as a reader of this tutorial, you'll have the best point of view on what's useful. So please feel free to hack in and improve the explanations whenever needed.

Thanks!

I looked over `tutorial-implementing-algebraic-structures.rst` earlier today (as much for personal knowledge as for reviewing). My three comments are:

* Typo on line 438, (``h`` should be ``Y``).

* The "python fun-fact" is potentially confusing, because it takes some thought to figure out why `~(int(2)=-3` if you're more knowledgeable in mathematics than you are in Python.

* In the example `func_on_basis(g)` giving an algebra morphism, as somebody that doesn't have much familiarity with using algebras in Sage, it's not immediately clear what's going on in the line `if g==1:`. It's not immediately obvious whether `1` should be referring to `1 mod 6Z`, or whether Sage is smart enough to coerce things and know that "1" is referring to `A.one()` for whatever category makes sense in context (0 mod 6Z, in this case). My guess is the latter, based on the output, but I think it merits being mentioned.

Hi Nicolas,

I have been through the tutorial and made a few changes and added the promised realizations template. I also addressed the comments made above by kdilks. If you want to check my template and add some "technical details" then I'll have one more look over it and give it  a positive review.

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A24):
> The commit is not a638d15?


I pushed two commits to trac: 6f1f88d and a638d15. The first one resulted in[comment:20](#comment%3A20), with the branch being changed to `u/andrew.mathas/thematic...` but the commit was not attached. The second push worked fine.

> I'm also interpreting[comment:22](#comment%3A22) as this should be back to needs_review.


No, it is not yet ready for review. Nicolas wanted to add some "technical comments" to my template. Once this is done, or Nicolas says that he does not want to do this, I will finalise my review.

Hi Nicolas.

I have just added a link from the tutorial to the `Categories` page in the reference manual (and removed the corresponding TODO from the tutorial). Did you want to add some more details to this or is it good to go?

Something strange was happening with the links to the "free modules" tutorial. They were giving errors when I was building the documentation, because the files were not there, but I notice that they are included in my patch. I didn't touch this directory so I am not sure what is happening there but perhaps it's OK now.

Andrew

Hi Nicolas,

I made a few more tweaks. If you are happy with my changes then please set this to a positive review once the `lazy_import` question is resolved. As far as I can see this is not possible because `tutorial_free_modules` does not live inside a module.

Andrew

Replying to [nthiery](#comment%3A35):
> The goal of the import is to enable accessing the tutorial with `sage.modules.tutorial_free_module?`.


Honestly, who is going to remember that?

If you really want to enable reading the tutorial from the command line, why not

```
sage: tutorials.free_module?
```
so you could do

```
sage: tutorials.<tab>
```
to find all tutorials.

I did not find a way to lazy import a module with our current lazy_import function.

I see this as a (temporary?) limitation of lazy_import, and for now I suggest to import the module, as we do for the other documentation modules above: it adds value to the user and the overhead is not horrible. That being said, I am taking off for vacations and am not inclined spending time debating this. If you don't want the import, go ahead and remove it :-)

On my side it's a positive review.
