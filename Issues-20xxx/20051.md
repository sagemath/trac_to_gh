#20020 introduced `asymptotic_expansions._SingularityAnalysis_non_normalized_`.
For `zeta != 1`, its results are incorrect due to substitution:

```
sage: asymptotic_expansions._SingularityAnalysis_non_normalized_(
....:     'n', 1/2, alpha=0, beta=1, precision=3)
1/2*2^n*n^(-1) + O(2^n*n^(-2))
```
instead of the correct `2^n * n^(-1) + O(2^n * n^(-2))`.

Furthermore, its performance is poor as it relies on substitution. Speed up is possible by introducing a flag to `asymptotic_expansions.SingularityAnalysis` to ignore the normalization factor.

See #17601 for the asymptotic expansions meta ticket.

I do not like a description like "whether the normalization factor ... is taken into account" because this is not a very clear description. I prefer to clearly state the fact, so that no ambiguities can arise.

If you want me to move this second variant to the top, say "the n-th coefficient of ... (if `normalize=True`, the default) or  of ... (if `normalize=False`), I can do that.

There was one incorrect doctest in the growth group `log(x)^2` where the incorrect result was stated (apparently, nobody checked whether the result there is correct). In any case, I wanted to have a doctest checking the correct behaviour right at the source of the problem.

What about writing something like "determines, whether the normalization factor `z^-(\beta + \delta)` is taken into account"? The detailed description could either go into a `NOTE`-block or just be in the extended method description (before `INPUT`).

I agree that unabiguity is more important than brevity in this case.

Yes, I think that mentioning the parameter in the extended function description too would be a good idea. Could you add such a statement?

I see, I've missed these lines when comparing diffs. The output of the doctest is now mathematically correct.
