The method `_flip_c` currently uses

```
nr_ref = len(W.long_element(as_word=True))
```
which drastically slows down computations (here: the construction of cluster complexes using subword complexes through the greedy flip algorithm).

For Weyl groups, I get

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['E',7])
sage: %timeit len(W.long_element(as_word=True))
10 loops, best of 3: 98.6 ms per loop
sage: %timeit W.number_of_reflections()
1 loop, best of 3: 208 ms per loop
```
and for Coxeter groups, I get

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['E',7])
sage: %timeit len(W.long_element(as_word=True))
1 loop, best of 3: 206 ms per loop
sage: %timeit W.number_of_reflections()
1 loop, best of 3: 378 ms per loop
```
so I leave the current implementation for those (though this is not as clean as it should be).

sage: Q = c+W.w0.coxeter_sorting_word(c)
sage: %time S = SubwordComplex(Q,W.w0,algorithm="greedy")

and without the fix, I get

For types E, it becomes obviously much worse.

Sorry, but I do not understand the logic of your change.

What is this attribute `__number_of_reflections` ? Does it exist only in the complex reflection group implementation ?

One should also replace the default code for `number_of_reflections` by the faster

```
from sage.rings.all import ZZ
return ZZ.sum(self.degrees() - 1)
```
that avoid to use rank.

Okay, I guess you are right. I should and will do it properly:

1. make the method `ReflectionGroup.number_of_reflections` use the attribute `ReflectionGroup._number_of_reflections` instead of recomputing it,

2. make this flip code use the method instead of the attribute for `ReflectionGroup` and also use this attribute for `WeylGroup` and `CoxeterGroup`, and finally

3. make `WeylGroup` and `CoxeterGroup` compute the number of reflections in the fastest possible way.

ok. Looks much better.

Have you re-done the timings to compare the new "number_of_reflections"
with the previously used len of the longest word ?

Why not, we could also do that. Maybe that's even the "right" solution, as the caching doesn't take any memory while avoids recomputing a bigger computation again and again.

Just FYI - calling a `@cached_method` is ~10% slower than a (Python) attribute lookup:

```python
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     def __init__(self, x):
....:         self.x = x
....:         self._y = x
....:     @cached_method
....:     def y(self):
....:         return self._y
....:     
sage: F = Foo(5)
sage: %timeit F.x
The slowest run took 73.41 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 42.2 ns per loop
sage: %timeit F.y()
The slowest run took 2799.35 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 57.1 ns per loop
```
However, it is better code (IMO) to use the cached method mechanism, and it makes it easier to change/override it.
