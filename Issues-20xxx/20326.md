The doctest of `add_linear_constraint_vector` from generic_backend.pyx (which is never run for any real backend!), when applied to COIN or GLPK leads to segfaults:

```
sage: coeffs = ([0, vector([1, 2])], [1, vector([2, 3])])
sage: upper = vector([5, 5])
sage: lower = vector([0, 0])
sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
sage: p = get_solver(solver = "Coin")      # optional - cbc
sage: p.add_linear_constraint_vector(2, coeffs, lower, upper, 'foo')
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0   signals.so                          0x0000000109df05c5 print_backtrace + 37
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segmentation fault: 11

sage: lower = vector([0, 0])

sage: p = get_solver(solver = "Coin")       # optional - cbc
