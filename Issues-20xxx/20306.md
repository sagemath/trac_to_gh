Sure, I understand that one might want to use that in new code for this reason. But if that's important enough to do it even in code that you don't have any other reason to touch, wouldn't it be possible to teach the docbuilder the syntax `#number` instead?

Until you want to have something like "If we do #1, then..." in the doc. IMO, basic doc maintenance is good to do and trivial merge conflicts like this, while annoying, are easy enough to deal with.
