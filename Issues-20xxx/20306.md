I think a better solution to those verbose lines would be

```
verbose -1 (...: dokchitser.py, __call__) Warning: Loss of 2 decimal digits due to cancellation
```
so as to avoid this problem in the future due to the number of lines changing in `dokchitser.py`.

@mezzarobba The reason why this is good is because when the doc is built, it automatically provides an embedded link to the trac ticket.

Until you want to have something like "If we do #1, then..." in the doc. IMO, basic doc maintenance is good to do and trivial merge conflicts like this, while annoying, are easy enough to deal with.
