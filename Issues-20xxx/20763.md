euler numbers currently use the slow maxima pexpect interface

they can be much faster using flint

for a possible follow-up, see #17770

Can you give some reasoning why it is 1000 for the cut-off for `sig_on`/`sig_off`?

Guess they consider that a good cutoff bound for speed for small values. Nor can I fault it:

```
sage: %time euler_number(10000)
CPU times: user 46.3 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 46.3 ms
Wall time: 46.2 ms
# Too long to put here
```
