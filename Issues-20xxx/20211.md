```
There are various inconsistencies in matrix `__init__` methods (details to follow).

1. This should work:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: p = pari('[1, 2; 3, 4]')
sage: M(p)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: entries has the wrong length
```

2.

```
sage: MatrixSpace(ZZ, 1, 1)([1])
[1]
sage: MatrixSpace(ZZ, 1, 1)(vector([1]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-12-d1b8d7e0999e> in <module>()
----> 1 MatrixSpace(ZZ, Integer(1), Integer(1))(vector([Integer(1)]))

/usr/local/src/sage-config/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_space.pyc in __call__(self, entries, coerce, copy, sparse)
    549             [t]
    550         """
--> 551         return self.matrix(entries, coerce, copy)
    552 
    553     def change_ring(self, R):

/usr/local/src/sage-config/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_space.pyc in matrix(self, x, coerce, copy)
   1564                 x = list_to_dict(x, m, n)
   1565                 copy = False
-> 1566         return MC(self, x, copy=copy, coerce=coerce)
   1567 
   1568     def matrix_space(self, nrows=None, ncols=None, sparse=False):

/usr/local/src/sage-config/src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx in sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense.__init__ (build/cythonized/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.c:6848)()
    349                 x = ZZ(entries)
    350             except TypeError:
--> 351                 raise TypeError("unable to coerce entry to an integer")
    352             is_list = False
    353         elif type(entries) is list:

TypeError: unable to coerce entry to an integer
```

3. The error message does not correspond to what is happening with other entries

```
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,0)
[0 0]
[0 0]
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,0.0)
[0 0]
[0 0]
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,'0')
[0 0]
[0 0]
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,'0.0')
...
TypeError: entries must be coercible to a list or integer
```
If the data must be coercible then the last 3 should fail. Though, if the ring is provided I would be less strict and also allow conversion (and make all the above work).

4. The following should either work or not work for all rings

```
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,'3')
[3 0]
[0 3]
sage: matrix(RBF,2,2,'3')
[3.000000000000000                 0]
[                0 3.000000000000000]
sage: matrix(ZZ,2,2,'3')
...
TypeError: entries has the wrong length
sage: matrix(QQbar,2,2,'3')
...
TypeError: entries has the wrong length
```
(there is something weird above since `QQbar('3')` does not work but `ZZ('3')` does)

I noticed that you closed #19700 to move its resolution here, you might want to do the same with #19134.

In #24742, I am disallowing strings. So `0.0` should work but not `"0"`.

I'm removing issue 5 since that's just `QQbar(3.0)` versus `ZZ(3.0)`. That has nothing to do with matrices.

So far, issues 2, 3 and 4 are fixed in #24742. The examples involving strings all become an error and the rest works.

And 1. is subtly wrong with the current version of #24742:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: p = pari('[1, 2; 3, 4]')
sage: M(p)
[1 3]
[2 4]
```
