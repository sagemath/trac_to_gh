```
If
1. you used Sage 6.9 on your machine
2. that Sage directory does no longer exist
3. you open a ipynb File last saved with Sage 6.9 in SageMath 7.0.beta4
then you get a kernel error. Changing the kernel via the menu in this window does **not** help. Changing the kernel, saving the notebook, reopening the notebook helps.

You can probably substitute 6.9 by older versions.

The reason: Until Sage 6.9 (#19371), a kernel specification file was written in the user's home directory. This kernel specification file now has an invalid path and some relevant part of ipython crashes with an OSError.

```
...
      File "/local/sage/sage-7.1.beta4/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/jupyter_client/launcher.py", line 123, in launch_kernel
        proc = Popen(cmd, **kwargs)
      File "/local/sage/sage-7.1.beta4/local/lib/python/subprocess.py", line 710, in __init__
        errread, errwrite)
      File "/local/sage/sage-7.1.beta4/local/lib/python/subprocess.py", line 1335, in _execute_child
        raise child_exception
    OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

This OSError should be caught and the standard dialog for a missing kernel should be invoked.

I have little idea whether this should be considered to be a jupyter issue or a sage issue --- after all, sage put kernel specification files into the users homedirectories without informing them about that.

From jupyter's perspective, the user provided an incorrect specification file, so perhaps there is no reason to react gracefully. Sage should IMHO.

So I'd appreciate if somebody with more knowledge about the jupyter/sage integration could take over here.
