I think I have. In the past (prior to this version) `sympy`'s `setup.py` was importing `sympy` itself. The danger then was to import the previously installed `sympy` rather the new `sympy`. So we add this

```
export PYTHONPATH="."
echo "building sympy"
python -S setup.py build
```
The `-S` is the cause of your trouble, look it up. So you should remove the `PYTHONPATH` stuff, the `-S` and remove the corresponding comments in `spkg-install`.

This can be minimized to

```
sage: import sympy
sage: u = sympy.Function('u'); n = sympy.Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: sympy.sympify(3*u(n), evaluate=False)
NotImplementedError: SymPy function 'u' doesn't exist
```
which disappears when `3*u(n)` is changed to `u(n)*3` or `u(n)`

EDIT: I will just change the order in the muls for the doctest, and open a ticket. The case is rare and can be fixed after the upgrade.

With this branch, we have:

```
sage: import sympy
sage: u = sympy.Function('u'); n = sympy.Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: x = int(3)
sage: x*u(n)
3*u(n)
sage: sympy.sympify(x*u(n))
3*u(n)
sage: sympy.sympify(x*u(n), evaluate=False)
3*u(n)

sage: x = 3._sympy_()
sage: sympy.sympify(x*u(n), evaluate=False)
3*u(n)
```
However, I think this is the problem:

```
sage: type(3*u(n))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(u(n)*3)
<class 'sympy.core.mul.Mul'>

sage: x = int(3)
sage: type(x*u(n))
<class 'sympy.core.mul.Mul'>
sage: type(u(n)*x)
<class 'sympy.core.mul.Mul'>
```
So it is probably something on our end.

Okay, I think I have a better understanding of things. So here's what I think is going on. The coercion system is working fine:

```
sage: import sympy
sage: u = sympy.Function('u'); n = sympy.Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: import operator
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()

sage: cm.common_parent(3, u(n))
Symbolic Ring
sage: cm.common_parent(u(n), 3)
Symbolic Ring
sage: type(cm.bin_op(3, u(n), operator.mul))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(cm.bin_op(u(n), 3, operator.mul))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```
That is now returning something rather than erroring out. This is coming from

```
sage: (u(n))._sage_()
u(n)
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```
We go to the coercion framework because of `__mul__` from integers. Previously, because it was erroring out, the multiplication code then tried `__rmul__` from the SymPy function, which resulted in a SymPy object. Now, we get different behaviors because when the SymPy object is on the left, we call its `__mul__`, which results in a SymPy object.

I'm also retracting the last part of [comment:15](#comment%3A15), and the issue might be in SymPy and how it tries to parse our symbolic expressions:

```
sage: f = function('f')
sage: x = var('x')
sage: sympy.sympify(f(x), evaluate=False)
f(x)
sage: sympy.sympify(3*f(x), evaluate=False)
AttributeError: 'Call' object has no attribute 'id'
```
However, we do seem to have our own troubles of constructing SymPy objects from symbolic expressions. All of these result in errors:

```
sage: f._sympy_()
sage: f(x)._sympy_()
sage: (f(x)+3)._sympy_()
```

I'm okay with your patch. Although we typically set the first patched version to `p0`.
