<a id='comment:5'></a>Here's a fix for the remaining failures with Gurobi.

mip.pyx is no longer testing with the default MIP solver; now always uses GLPK. Testing with the default MIP solver seems like a bad idea. We'll ensure consistency of the backends using the new backend testsuite introduced in #20323, #20424.
