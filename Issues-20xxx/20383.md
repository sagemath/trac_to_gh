This is a bug:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.finite_state_machine import setup_latex_preamble 
sage: setup_latex_preamble()
sage: latex.extra_preamble('') 
sage: setup_latex_preamble()
sage: latex.extra_preamble()
''                                                                        
```

I understand that calling `setup_latex_preamble()` is slow but what is slow is not assigning a string to the preamble, it is whether or not tikz is available. This should be another function (possibly cached) function.
