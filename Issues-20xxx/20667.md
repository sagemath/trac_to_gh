Keywords: property, consistency

Following two long discussions on sage-devel about ``@`property`: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/heavy/sage-devel/tVa8vs_PHH0/60QajUDYBQAJ
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/heavy/sage-devel/b-u-0WqrtcY/SWhdeoO_BgAJ

No consensus was reached, except that mostly everyone agreed that `Matrix.I` was bad (in particular, there was people both for and against Matrix.T and Matrix.H).

So this ticket aims to deprecate just `Matrix.I`, so we can take it out
completely at some point in the future.

I'm setting this for needs_review. Note that I tried to run the doctests but that I'm getting a gazillion errors all over the place, unrelated to this ticket, for some reason, and so it's difficult for me to check whether this ticket causes new failures.

OK, fixed: the bug was due to not properly reinstating warnings in `_test_not_implemented_methods` if that method threw an `AssertionError`.

`@`jdemeyer: the reason is that `_test_not_implemented_methods` accesses every attribute on an object.

A more efficient version of `_test_not_implemented_methods` shouldn't actually call properties, of course, and then I wouldn't have to modify the warnings filter. Do you have a suggestion for an alternative version that would behave like this?
