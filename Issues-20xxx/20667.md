<a id='comment:2'></a>Some warnings that had to be dealt with have surfaces: I fixed all but 2 of them, for which I have added deprecation warnings in doctests:
- weave is now a separate package and should not be used from scipy
- `ShardPosetElement` derives from `tuple`, which is against Sage guidelines

There is some code for matrices that has to be removed together with custom deprecation, I've openened #20665.

And let me correct that inheriting from tuple is **not** against Sage guidelines. Though, not inheriting from `SageObject` is.
