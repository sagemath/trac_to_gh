Using resetwarnings inside Sage code makes it impossible to suppress warnings when desired (e.g. from upstream packages that didn't care about them).

Some warnings that had to be dealt with have surfaces: I fixed all but 2 of them, for which I have added deprecation warnings in doctests:
- weave is now a separate package and should not be used from scipy
- `ShardPosetElement` derives from `tuple`, which is against Sage guidelines

There is some code for matrices that has to be removed together with custom deprecation, I've openened #20665.

The `DeprecationWarning` from `SharedPosetElement` is fixed on the git branch `public/20667`.

And let me correct that inheriting from tuple is **not** against Sage guidelines. Though, not inheriting from `SageObject` is.
