This is the update to #20380 with a new patch mirroring the upstream fix for the same issue.  The patch I added was taking [directly from SVN](https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/viewvc.php/mpfr/trunk/src/mpfr-impl.h?r1=10257&r2=10260&view=patch) and applies to the current version of MPFR in sage with some fuzz (I don't know if this matters or not).

I confirmed that, as expected, like #20380 this fixes building MPFR on Cygwin.

One detail: could you add some comment on the top of the patch file? In particular, a link to the SVN repo and this Sage ticket would be useful.

I cannot test on Cygwin myself, but if you tell me that it works for you, then I'll believe that. I checked that it doesn't break anything on Linux.

When a ticket is closed as "fixed", it means that it's merged in Volker's private branch https://github.com/vbraun/sage/tree/develop
This happens before buildbot testing.

This is really a private branch, which means that you should not use it for development. It is common for git history to be rewritten in that branch.

After buildbot testing, Volker will release a new beta release and Volker's branch will become the "real" `develop` branch.

I'm no so sure how I feel about that. It would be nice to have a branch in the main repo representing what is currently merged, rather than on someone else's fork.  I'm also confused why it would be closed as "fixed" if buildbot testing hasn't run yet--isn't it possible the ticket will be reopened if the testing fails?
