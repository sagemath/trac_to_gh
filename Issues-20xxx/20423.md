This is the update to #20380 with a new patch mirroring the upstream fix for the same issue.  The patch I added was taking [directly from SVN](https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/viewvc.php/mpfr/trunk/src/mpfr-impl.h?r1=10257&r2=10260&view=patch) and applies to the current version of MPFR in sage with some fuzz (I don't know if this matters or not).

I confirmed that, as expected, like #20380 this fixes building MPFR on Cygwin.

Keywords: **windows cygwin days77**

When a ticket is closed as "fixed", it means that it's merged in Volker's private branch https://github.com/vbraun/sage/tree/develop
This happens before buildbot testing.

This is really a private branch, which means that you should not use it for development. It is common for git history to be rewritten in that branch.

After buildbot testing, Volker will release a new beta release and Volker's branch will become the "real" `develop` branch.

I would suggest no additional workflow stage, just to close the ticket as fixed only when it's actually going to be merged. That was how I operated as release manager.

But it's not my decision, you have to convince Volker.
