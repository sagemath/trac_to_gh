```
When building sage-7.2 with `LDFLAGS="--as-needed"` and the gold linker, the result is underlinked:

```
from sage.rings.complex_double import CDF
ImportError: /home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib/libgsl.so.19: undefined symbol: cblas_sdsdot
```

This is because `libgsl.so` itself is underlinked as per upstream design. This doesn't work well when building a python loadable module which needs all its symbols (apart from those provided by python) to be resolved. 

The gold linker in particular as a very strict interpretation of `--as-needed` and will not add library not needed directly by the object being linked. In this particular case sage.rings.complex_double needs gsl but doesn't use cblas and therefore cblas is not added to the list of needed libraries. libgsl.so itself need to import cblas.

The current branch provides a minimal non invasive fix to link libgsl.so to the current cblas. 

Note, that gsl already depends on `$(BLAS)` even so prior to this ticket it was not used.

Or patch LinBox in that way?

FWIW, Sage-on-Gentoo (see:`https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-libs/linbox/linbox-1.3.2-r2.ebuild`) does this by appending `-liml` to the `LIBS` variable and not by patching.

I'm now unable to reproduce any of the issues associated with this ticket. Things implemented:
* export export LDFLAGS="-Wl,--as-needed"
* rebuild (sage -f) `sagelib, gsl, linbox` (`gsl` was probably not necessary)

`sage: from sage.rings.complex_double import CDF`

does not fail and rebuilding `linbox` also rebuilds `iml` and `fflas_ffpack`. I don't know if using `atlas` will be a problem.

Somehow I had another comment that escaped posting :( The gold linker has a more strict interpretation of `--as-needed` and in this case `libgsl` would need to be linked to `cblas` itself.

It could be interesting to try adding `-Wl,--no-allow-shlib-undefined` as an additional `LDFLAGS`.

I didn't notice anything different, with a clean build of 7.5.beta1, it dies when it tries to build the docs at the end of compilation:

```
$ LDFLAGS="-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,--no-allow-shlib-undefined" CFLAGS="${CFLAGS}" make -j4
...
[conway_polynomials-0.4.p0] Finished installing conway_polynomials-0.4.p0.spkg

Makefile:1063: recipe for target 'doc-html' failed
```

I don't see anything unusual in that same spot in the sagelib build log either, but I don't really know what I'm looking for. I think the additional linker flag should have made it fail?

Failure to link would have been my minimal expectation.

So the option we have:
* link `libgsl.so` to the selected cblas (openblas or atlas) when it is built.
* add a `-Wl,--no-as-needed` flag to all files linking to `libgsl.so` in the sage library.

The first one may be achieved by adding

```
LIBS=`pkg-config --libs-only-l cblas`
```
to the configure line of `gsl`'s spkg-install. I think.

The second one may be achievable by alteration of `gsl.pc` by manually adding the flag we want. Possibly by patching `gsl.pc.in` before building `gsl`.

Pick your poison.

It seems to me that altering the `gsl.pc` file is like a SoG build with `USE=cblas-external`. And this approach will require a change in the configure of `gsl` resulting in increased package maintenance on the Sage end. But doing it would remove undefined `cblas` symbols in `libgsl`.

When I first encountered this, I thought the fact that GSL wasn't linked to CBLAS was a bug, but then you pointed out that upstream leaves it that way on purpose. What's the benefit of doing so in Sage, where we know that everything is going to transitively link to the same CBLAS anyway?
