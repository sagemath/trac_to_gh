There are at least *some* [formulas for Bessel derivatives with respect to order](http://dlmf.nist.gov/10.38) (also [here](http://dlmf.nist.gov/10.15)), though [some of their forms](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/4019/derivate-bessel-function-with-respect-to-order) are not particularly [helpful](http://functions.wolfram.com/Bessel-TypeFunctions/BesselK/20/01/01/) without some other things working properly like series of digammas (apparently).
