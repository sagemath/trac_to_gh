# Issue 20801: bug in documentation for p-adic padded_list function

If c is a p-adic integer then c.list() returns its p-adic digits starting at the `p^0` coefficient, while if c is a p-adic number then c.list() returns its digits starting at `p^v` where v is tha valuation.  This is correctly documented.  But there is also the method c.padded_list() which pads with 0s, and the documentation for this explicitly states that it always starts with the `p^0` coefficient; however that is not the case when c's parent is a p-adic field, even if c is integral.  Then, c.padded_list(k) only lists the coefficients from that of `p^v` up to that of `p^(k-1)`.

The reason is that c.padded_list() first calls c.list() but does not use the start_val=0 option.

The documentation of `padded_list` was changed in #14825 so that it now says that it starts at `p^v` for field elements.  At the same time, this function was deprecated in favor of using `expansion`.

Should this ticket be closed as (now) invalid?

I'm happy for this to be closed.  The code I was writing when I came across this now uses the new expansion() method already.
