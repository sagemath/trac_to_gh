I really do not understand what you mean. In fact, it makes me doubt that you understood what I meant:

if you have removed all classic divisions from the `combinat` folder, I recommend to put `from __future__ import division` in the source code of the `sage/combinat/*.py(x)` files. Doing that will ensure that no old-style division can sneak in with future changes. It also makes it very explicit that no further work needs to be done with division in those modules.

What I mean is the following.

With my branch, running `python -Qnew $(which sage-runtests) src/sage/combinat/*.py`
gives no failing doctests.

Bur running `python -Qwarnall $(which sage-runtests) src/sage/combinat/*.py`
still gives many warnings. Most of these warnings are related to classic division
happening in other parts of sage, but there could be some still happening in /combinat
without affecting the doctests.

I could try to add the `from future import` everywhere in all \combinat files and
see if no problem occurs. Would this be a good idea ?

That could only happen if there are divisions which are not executed by any doctest. Let's hope this is not the case... in any case, it is hard to check otherwise.

Yes, that is what I meant.

But many of them do not use division at all !

Wouldn't it be enough to just mark those where I did change something in the divisions ?

Or are we planning to have `from future import division` in **every** single python file in sage ?
