Make [SnapPy](http://www.math.uic.edu/t3m/SnapPy/) an "official" optional package. With the branch apply you just need to run

```
sage -i snappy
```
Sadly, the options such as `--user` are not transmitted to `pip`. So for a user wide installation, one still need to use pip version

```
sage -pip install snappy --user
```
In a follow-up ticket, we could ensure compatibility of the Sage Link class and the `SnapPy` link class via some doctests.

Note: a Docker image for Sage + SnapPy + Regina + PHCPack + more is available:
- Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/computop/sage/
- code repository: https://bitbucket.org/t3m/sagedocker
- dockerfile: https://bitbucket.org/t3m/sagedocker/src/tip/sage/Dockerfile

This ticket is superseded by #31180.

How exactly do you imagine the integration with our Link class?

As a first step, Nathan tought us the `sage_link` method

```
sage: 
sage: import snappy
sage: L = snappy.Link('K10n11')
sage: K = L.sage_link()
sage: K.alexander_polynomial()
-t^-3 + 5*t^-2 - 9*t^-1 + 11 - 9*t + 5*t^2 - t^3
sage: L.alexander_polynomial()
t^6 - 5*t^5 + 9*t^4 - 11*t^3 + 9*t^2 - 5*t + 1
```
And there is a nice conversion from Sage link to SnapPy handled automatically

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(8)
sage: K = Link(B([-1, -1, -1, -2, 1, -2, 3, -2, 3]))
sage: L = snappy.Link(K)
```

This might already help for:
- double checking the outputs (from both sides)
- comparing the implementations

To enhance it further we could make work the natural conversion the other way around

```
sage: L = snappy.Link('K10n11')
sage: Link(L)
```

I just added the `_sage_` method to Spherogram, essentially as an alias for the `sage_link` method mentioned above.
