```
The implementation of the derivative of the zeta function `zetaderiv` is numerically unstable and very slow (for large negative values):

```
sage: zetaderiv(1, CIF(-600))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NoConvergence: zeta: too much cancellation
```

```
sage: timeit('zetaderiv(1, CIF(-500))')
5 loops, best of 3: 3.08 s per loop
```

Could either the current implementation be improved or an alternative numerical implementation be used?

---

This also causes errors when testing relations like

```
sage: bool(gamma(k*pi) * zetaderiv(1, k*pi*I)/log(2)^2 == 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NoConvergence: zeta: too much cancellation
```

Could you try it with the following expression? This is the original one which brought me to this error. If it works (which is rarely; maybe one out of 20 times on my laptop here), it takes several seconds.

```
sage: bool(gamma(2 + k*pi*I/log(2)) * zetaderiv(1, 1+k*pi*I/log(2))/log(2)^10 == 0)

The exception happens when executing `test_relation()`. With `domain='complex'` `test_relation()` is not called at all because then the assumption `(k, 'complex')` has to be taken into account so Maxima is called for proof which, remarkably, is faster here and correct.

However what happens with the original case is that in `test_relation()` random substitutions into the relation are performed to see if the resulting values differ. One substitution that causes the exception is for example `{k: -312.363505734545? + 152.010201758413?*I}` so you can get the exception with the code `(gamma(2 + k*pi*I/log(2)) * zetaderiv(1,1+k*pi*I/log(2))/log(2)^10 == 0).subs({k: CIF(-312.363505734545 + 152.010201758413*I)}).n()` reliably.

Coincidentally, this solves my original problem. However, I still think that the fact that this

```
sage: zetaderiv(1, CIF(-600)).n()
```
is both very slow and raises the `NoConvergence`-error is a problem.

Is it possible to use a numerically more stable version of the derivative of the zeta function? Maybe someone knowing more about this numerical stuff could help with this.

Arb can compute derivatives of the zeta function without difficulty. E.g. with my own python-flint interface, I can do

```
>>> ctx.cap = 10
>>> acb_series([-600,1]).zeta()
([7.82232679749e+928 +/- 8.22e+916])*x + ([-3.56689160315e+929 +/- 4.12e+917])*x^2 + ([7.8112800125e+929 +/- 5.34e+918])*x^3 + ([-1.08969439943e+930 +/- 6.02e+918])*x^4 + ([1.07928682824e+930 +/- 9.55e+918])*x^5 + ([-7.957487571e+929 +/- 4.23e+919])*x^6 + ([4.390792240e+929 +/- 6.15e+919])*x^7 + ([-1.700332217e+929 +/- 6.11e+919])*x^8 + ([3.04336993e+928 +/- 6.00e+919])*x^9 + O(x^10)
```

which takes 0.1 milliseconds.

This would be easier to wrap with a Sage wrapper for Arb power series in place, but it should not be too hard to do directly either: see `acb_poly_zeta_series` and `arb_poly_zeta_series`.

In the left half plane, `mpmath.diff(mpmath.zeta, s, n)` could also be used instead of `mpmath.zeta(s, 1, n)`.

It's a bit worrying that `zetaderiv` currently accepts CIF input and outputs a *nonrigorous* CIF without warning, by going through a plain numerical computation. It is easy to produce examples where the output is plain *wrong*:

```
sage: q = CIF("2.46316186945432128587439505331", "23.2983204927628579020109616266")
sage: zetaderiv(1,q)
-3.8826886735960628?e-17 - 7.4180200774526877?e-17*I
sage: q = ComplexIntervalField(128)("2.46316186945432128587439505331", "23.2983204927628579020109616266")
sage: zetaderiv(1,q)

```

Are there other Sage functions that treat intervals as carelessly?
