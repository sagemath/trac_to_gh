The work on reflection groups is in:
* #11187: main ticket with the first implementation
* #20395: (merged into #11187) preparation for the category framework to demand the method `degrees`.
* #20396: (merged into #11187) Implementation of the invariant form for crg's.
* #20477: Reduced words in crg's.
* #20445: Iteration algorithm using coset decomposition
* #20484: cythonizing has_descent, first_descent, descents. Code is available in #20445
* #20521: left/right actions for real and primal/dual for all reflection groups
* #25467: discriminant up- and downstairs
* #25466: Ambient space transformation
* #25477: iteration through general permutation groups (used for non-real reflection groups)

Other improvements:
* #20440: Field of definition
* #20444: Fake degree polynomial
* #20448: Generators of module of derivations
* #25478: Fix bug in is_regular
* #25483: Implement Coxeter numbers in the sense of Malle 
* #25479: Jacobian and primitive vector field
* #25485: Braid orbit of reduced words in Coxeter group
