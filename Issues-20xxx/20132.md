While Maxima does not know about these domains in its assumption framework they can be emulated by giving the combined assumptions `("integer", ...>0)`, `("complex", "rational")`. This ticket should then also check with `is_abc...()` that Pynac understands them as well.

Keywords: **assumptions, domain**
