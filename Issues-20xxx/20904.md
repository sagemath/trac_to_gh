Following two long discussions on sage-devel about `@property`: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/heavy/sage-devel/tVa8vs_PHH0/60QajUDYBQAJ
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/heavy/sage-devel/b-u-0WqrtcY/SWhdeoO_BgAJ

No consensus was reached, except that mostly everyone agreed that `Matrix.I` was bad (in particular, there was people both for and against Matrix.T and Matrix.H).

So this ticket aims to deprecate just `Matrix.I`, so we can take it out
completely at some point in the future.

OK, fixed: the bug was due to not properly reinstating warnings in `_test_not_implemented_methods` if that method threw an `AssertionError`.

@jdemeyer: the reason is that `_test_not_implemented_methods` accesses every attribute on an object. A gazillion `TESTS`-blocks in `sage.matrix` runs `TestSuite` on matrices, which will run `_test_not_implemented_methods`, which will access every attribute, in particular `Matrix.I`. Since this is a property, accessing it will "call" it, thus triggering the deprecation warning. Since `_test_not_implemented_methods` is not about warnings, I thought that disabling *all* warnings would be OK for the duration of the test.

A more efficient version of `_test_not_implemented_methods` shouldn't actually call properties, of course, and then I wouldn't have to modify the warnings filter. Do you have a suggestion for an alternative version that would behave like this?

Best,
Johan
