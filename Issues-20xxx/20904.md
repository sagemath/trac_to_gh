Following two long discussions on sage-devel about ``@`property`: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/heavy/sage-devel/tVa8vs_PHH0/60QajUDYBQAJ
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/heavy/sage-devel/b-u-0WqrtcY/SWhdeoO_BgAJ

No consensus was reached, except that mostly everyone agreed that `Matrix.I` was bad (in particular, there was people both for and against Matrix.T and Matrix.H).

So this ticket aims to deprecate just `Matrix.I`, so we can take it out
completely at some point in the future.


Keywords: property, consistency
