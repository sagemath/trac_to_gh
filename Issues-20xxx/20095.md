Almost found a way out. Except that Sphinx now complains that all links outside of graph/ are broken. I don't remember if there is a 'first phase' in Sphinx compilation, during which this nitpicky mode should be disabled... What a waste of time. 1 hour....

Something should be done to automatically forbid broken links, or at least to found them easily.

However, I suggest that in this patch we correct those in graphs-directory, and talk more general question at sage-devel. I did that modification.

But I am now compiling and testing, so this is not ready for review yet.
