<a id='comment:5'></a>IMO, I think it would be better to not convert the print to tuples with, e.g.,

```
print((i, g^i, (g^i).value()))
```
but instead

```
print("{} {} {}".format(i, g^i, (g^i).value()))
```
However, I don't hold a very strong opinion on this.

But there is already a large number of tickets, and still more (and larger) to be done. Maybe we can be happy enough with something that works ?
