Maxima combines fractions only on the top level, not recursively:

```
sage: 1/x + 1/x^2 + (x+1)/x
(x + 1)/x + 1/x + 1/x^2
sage: (1/x + 1/x^2 + (x+1)/x).combine()
(x + 2)/x + 1/x^2
sage: (1/x + (1/x+1/x^2+(x+1)/x)/x^2 + (x+1)/x).combine()
(x + 2)/x + ((x + 1)/x + 1/x + 1/x^2)/x^2
```


**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.
