When using squarefree_decomposition on linear polynomials over a finite field, the coefficients are not divided by the unit part, resulting in an incorrect output.

```
sage: K.<x> = GF(7)[]
sage: (6*x+3).squarefree_decomposition()
(6) * (6*x + 3)
sage: (6*x+3).squarefree_decomposition().expand()
x + 4
sage: K.<x> = GF(5)[]
sage: (2*x).squarefree_decomposition()
(2) * 2*x
```

Is this a bug in Flint or does Sage wrap Flint incorrectly in `factor_helper`?

It seems Flint doesn't return a monic factor in case of a linear input. I attached a patch to "fix" it.
