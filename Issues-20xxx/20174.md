Many of rigged configuration operations, such as `e()` and `f()`, needlessly recompute the vacancy numbers. We simply need to tell the constructor to avoid doing these computations.

Also, because the Cartan matrices are sparse and general matrix implementation details, it is relatively expensive to iterate over the row. Instead, it is much fast to get the specific entry by `CM[i,j]`.

Slightly annoying how simple changes these were and resulting in such a large speed gain...
