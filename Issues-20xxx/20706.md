site has not attribute getsitepackages

This is a quick and dirty fallback in that case.

```
sp = os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL, 'lib', 'python', 'site-packages')

I replaced it by `SAGE_LIB` in sage-on-gentoo but never pushed it because it is bundled with a bunch of other stuff.

I am trying to do `from sage.all import *` in an ipython3 session in a python3 virtualenv. This is the first failing point.

Then come problems with importing cython modules, but this is maybe another story.

I don't know that it's you necessarily.  The key words might be "importing sage".  I haven't even tried using sage in a virtualenv, much less on Python 3.  Normally there'd be nothing special to it.
