Docstring of `LatticePoset()` says that `**options` if forwarded to `Poset()`. It is not:

```
sage: P = Poset( ([0, 1,3,2, 10], [[0,1],[0,3],[0,2], [1,10],[3,10],[2,10]]), linear_extension=True)
sage: L = LatticePoset( ([0, 1,3,2, 10], [[0,1],[0,3],[0,2], [1,10],[3,10],[2,10]]), linear_extension=True)
sage: P.list()
[0, 1, 3, 2, 10]
sage: L.list()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 10]
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>This can be seen also with plain posets:

```
P1 = Poset({1:[2]}, linear_extension=False, facade=False)
P2 = Poset(P1)
Q1 = Poset({1:[2]}, linear_extension=True, facade=True)
Q2 = Poset(Q1)
print P1._with_linear_extension, P1._is_facade, "-->", P2._with_linear_extension, P2._is_facade
print Q1._with_linear_extension, Q1._is_facade, "-->", Q2._with_linear_extension, Q2._is_facade
```

outputs

```
False False --> False False
True True --> False True
```

i.e. `linear_extension=True` is not copied along the data and `facade` argument.

I suppose that this relates to #18776.
