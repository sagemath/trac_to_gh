Querying the documentation of an object/class/method `foo` in the Jupyter notebook opens a help window. The goal of this ticket is to include a link to the corresponding Sphinx-compiled static documentation when it exists.

Notes for potential implementation:

The inventory objects obtained as side product of the Sphinx contains
appropriate information to retrieve the relevant html file name from the
name of `foo`:

```
...
sage.combinat.composition.Compositions py:class 1 sage/combinat/composition.html#$ -
...
```

Alternatively, we could just infer the html file name just from the name of the module. This may be less robust though. Also this does not allow for checking that `foo` actually has static documentation attached to it.

The anchor in the html file is again the name.

Remaining question:
- Infering robustly the base url of the static documentation
  (are there cases where we would access documentation outside of the reference manual?)
- How to hook in the Jupyter interactive help to insert the line?
- Could things be generalized to work for other projects using Sphinx?

Bonus feature:
- also handle objects for which we have an intersphinx inventory (e.g. Python's own doc).

Depends on #20599
