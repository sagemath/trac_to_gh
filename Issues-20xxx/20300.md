sage: G = DirichletGroup(-20); G
Group of Dirichlet characters of modulus -20 over Cyclotomic Field of order 4 and degree 2
sage: chi = G.0; chi
Dirichlet character modulo -20 of conductor 4 mapping 11 |--> -1, 17 |--> 1
```

pretends to work, but then most things like `chi.gauss_sum()` etc fail.

Either `DirichletGroup` with a negative modulus should yield an error or return the one with |modulus|
