Two related issues with modular symbols, originally reported by robharron on sage-nt: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-nt/5HYpZKFB2qA/fRXgDkaICAAJ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-nt/5HYpZKFB2qA/fRXgDkaICAAJ).

Issue 1:

```
sage: chi = kronecker_character(3*34603)
sage: M = ModularSymbols(chi, 2, sign=1, base_ring=GF(3))
...
File "/projects/sage/sage-6.10/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/modular/modsym/relation_matrix.py", line 126, in modS_relations
    assert j != -1
AssertionError
```
The underlying problem appears to be:

```
sage: import sage.modular.modsym.p1list as p1list
sage: for (i,j) in p1list.P1List(103809):
sage:    if i != 1 and i != 3: print (i,j)
(0, 1) #should also return (34603, 1), (34603, 2), (34603, 3)
```

Issue 2:

```
sage: chi = kronecker_character(3*61379)
sage: M = ModularSymbols(chi, 2, sign=1, base_ring=GF(3))
...
  File "sage/rings/fast_arith.pyx", line 381, in sage.rings.fast_arith.arith_llong.c_inverse_mod_longlong (/projects/sage/sage-6.10/src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/fast_arith.c:5546)
    raise ArithmeticError("The inverse of %s modulo %s is not defined."%(a,m))
ArithmeticError: The inverse of -2142142713 modulo 184137 is not defined.
```
The underlying issue appears to be:

```
sage: import sage.modular.modsym.p1list as p1list
sage: N = 3*61379
sage: p1 = p1list.P1List(N)
sage: p1.normalize_with_scalar(21, -1) 
...
ArithmeticError: The inverse of -2142142713 modulo 184137 is not defined.

In `p1list`, one finds different code depending on the size of the level. For levels in this range, the relevant subroutine is `p1list_llong`, which contains:

```
    cmax = N/2
    if N%2:   # N odd, max divisor is <= N/3
        if N%5:  # N not a multiple of 3 either, max is N/5
            cmax = N/5
        else:
            cmax = N/3
```
but `N%5` should be `N%3`.

Re issue 2: the offending subroutine in `p1list` appears to be `c_p1_normalize_llong`, in which one finds:

```
    if compute_s:
        ss[0] = <int> (arith_llong.c_inverse_mod_longlong(s*min_t, N) % ll_N)

As written, this creates a 32-bit integer overflow. It should be:

```
    if compute_s:
        ss[0] = <int> (arith_llong.c_inverse_mod_longlong((<llong> s)*(<llong> min_t), N) % ll_N)

This patch addresses both issues in the description. Besides doctesting the isolating code fragments, I added optional doctests for the construction of the spaces of modular symbols; however, these take far too long to be required even as long doctests.

Sadly no, this is precisely a bug that occurs only for large problem sizes (see comment 1), so any doctest that actually tests it will have to deal with large problems. Is it okay if all of the doctests that confirm the resolution of this issue are optional?
