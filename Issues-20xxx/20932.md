Two related issues with modular symbols, originally reported by robharron on sage-nt: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-nt/5HYpZKFB2qA/fRXgDkaICAAJ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-nt/5HYpZKFB2qA/fRXgDkaICAAJ).

Issue 1:

```
sage: chi = kronecker_character(3*34603)
sage: M = ModularSymbols(chi, 2, sign=1, base_ring=GF(3))
...
File "/projects/sage/sage-6.10/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/modular/modsym/relation_matrix.py", line 126, in modS_relations
    assert j != -1
AssertionError
```
The underlying problem appears to be:

```
sage: import sage.modular.modsym.p1list as p1list
sage: for (i,j) in p1list.P1List(103809):
sage:    if i != 1 and i != 3: print (i,j)
(0, 1) #should also return (34603, 1), (34603, 2), (34603, 3)
```

Issue 2:

```
sage: chi = kronecker_character(3*61379)
sage: M = ModularSymbols(chi, 2, sign=1, base_ring=GF(3))
...
  File "sage/rings/fast_arith.pyx", line 381, in sage.rings.fast_arith.arith_llong.c_inverse_mod_longlong (/projects/sage/sage-6.10/src/build/cythonized/sage/rings/fast_arith.c:5546)
    raise ArithmeticError("The inverse of %s modulo %s is not defined."%(a,m))
ArithmeticError: The inverse of -2142142713 modulo 184137 is not defined.
```
The underlying issue appears to be:

```
sage: import sage.modular.modsym.p1list as p1list
sage: N = 3*61379
sage: p1 = p1list.P1List(N)
sage: p1.normalize_with_scalar(21, -1) 
...
ArithmeticError: The inverse of -2142142713 modulo 184137 is not defined.

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
In `p1list`, one finds different code depending on the size of the level. For levels in this range, the relevant subroutine is `p1list_llong`, which contains:

```
    cmax = N/2
    if N%2:   # N odd, max divisor is <= N/3
        if N%5:  # N not a multiple of 3 either, max is N/5
            cmax = N/5
        else:
            cmax = N/3
```
but `N%5` should be `N%3`.

Re issue 2: the offending subroutine in `p1list` appears to be `c_p1_normalize_llong`, in which one finds:

```
    if compute_s:
        ss[0] = <int> (arith_llong.c_inverse_mod_longlong(s*min_t, N) % ll_N)

As written, this creates a 32-bit integer overflow. It should be:

```
