PPL has NNC_Polyhedron.
Should expose using Sage's Polyhedra classes.

In the context of #20877, NNC polyhedra could play the same role as half-open intervals do in the context of the new piecewise functions.

Normaliz also has the feature of "open facets".

A new Sage class somewhere between `ConvexSet_base + ConditionSet` and `Polyhedron` that is able to store convex sets given by finitely many, strict or non-strict linear constraints (not necessarily minimal) would be valuable.
