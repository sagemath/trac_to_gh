This will bring Sage to its knees:

```
assert sin(104*pi/105) == sin(pi/105)
```
because sin symmetry is not implemented and so the `__nonzero__` proof machinery is started which uses `QQbar` on algebraic numbers of high degree.

Sympy immediately verifies the equation because it does:

```
>>> sin(104*pi/105)
   ⎛ π ⎞
sin⎜───⎟
   ⎝105⎠
```

The fix will be made in Pynac and this ticket should doctest it.

**Resolution:** wontfix
