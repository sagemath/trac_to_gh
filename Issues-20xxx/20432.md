There should be an option in `IntegerListsLex` to allow lists with trailing zeros. Currently lists with trailing zeros are considered as being equivalent

```
sage: IntegerListsLex(2, max_length=2, min_part=0).list()
[[2], [1, 1], [0, 2]]
```
This is good in some use case, but it does contradict
- the implementation of `__contains__`
- the equality under union (i.e. `min_length=x, max_length=y` being the union of `length=k` for `k = x, x+1, ..., y`)
- equivariance under translation of parameters

In [ticket:17979#comment:197 #17979 answer in comment 197 (jdemeyer)] it was proposed to add a specific parameter to deal with the last digit.

This is a "feature", read the documentation. Integer lists are considered "up to trailing zeros".

It would be much more "functorial" without this feature. We would have:
- invariance under translation of parameters
- equality under unions (i.e. `min_length=x, max_length=y` would be the union of `length=k` for `k in {x, x+1, ..., y}`)

[ticket:17979#comment:165 #17979 comment 165 (nthiery)]:

```
I agree: 15 years ago, from the use cases I had under hand, I though
that this was a neat feature to identify lists up to trailing
zeroes. However this is non trivial to specify properly, and I am now
convinced that this is just a can of worms. We should seriously
consider dropping this feature.
```
[ticket:17979#comment:197 #17979 answer in comment 197 (jdemeyer)]

```
I do think that, by default, we shouldn't output lists with trailing zeros,
since this will lead in many cases to infinitely many lists satisfying the
constraints. However, I think it's best if the behaviour of __contains__
really matches the iterator.

If you ever allow negative parts, then the convention of having no trailing
zeros becomes very strange, since "non-zero" is no longer a convex condition.

In #17920 I solved this by setting a minimum/maximum value for the last part
of a list, if the list is longer than min_length. By default, this minimum
is 1 with no maximum which gives the same lists as the "identify trailing
zeros" convention.
