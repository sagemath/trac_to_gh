There should be an option in `IntegerListsLex` to allow lists with trailing zeros. Currently lists with trailing zeros are considered as being equivalent

```
sage: IntegerListsLex(2, max_length=2, min_part=0).list()
[[2], [1, 1], [0, 2]]
```
This is good in some use case, but it does contradict
- the implementation of `__contains__`
- the equality under union (i.e. `min_length=x, max_length=y` being the union of `length=k` for `k = x, x+1, ..., y`)
- equivariance under translation of parameters

In [#17979 answer in comment 197 (jdemeyer)](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/17979#comment:197) it was proposed to add a specific parameter to deal with the last digit.

I agree: 15 years ago, from the use cases I had under hand, I though
that this was a neat feature to identify lists up to trailing
zeroes. However this is non trivial to specify properly, and I am now
convinced that this is just a can of worms. We should seriously
consider dropping this feature.
```
[#17979 answer in comment 197 (jdemeyer)](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/17979#comment:197)

```
I do think that, by default, we shouldn't output lists with trailing zeros,
since this will lead in many cases to infinitely many lists satisfying the
constraints. However, I think it's best if the behaviour of __contains__
really matches the iterator.

If you ever allow negative parts, then the convention of having no trailing
zeros becomes very strange, since "non-zero" is no longer a convex condition.

In #17920 I solved this by setting a minimum/maximum value for the last part
of a list, if the list is longer than min_length. By default, this minimum
is 1 with no maximum which gives the same lists as the "identify trailing
zeros" convention.
```
