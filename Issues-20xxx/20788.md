Given a square matrix `M` over a field and an element `t` of the field, it is easy to compute the dimension of the left eigenspace of `M` with eigenvalue `t`, by computing the rank of `M-t` and subtracting it from the dimension of `M`. There should be a method for this.

Computing the multiplicity of the generalized eigenspace is slightly more involved, but also not difficult. There should be a method for this too; I already have it written and will get it onto this ticket soon.

It would also be useful to have methods returning eigenspaces and generalized eigenspaces for individual eigenvalues, without computing all of them.
