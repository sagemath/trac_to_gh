This trivial patch allows `thickness`-option in graph plotting. It seems to have forgotten from the option list.

To test try for example

```
G = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
G.allow_loops(True)
G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
G.set_edge_label(1,3,'foo')
G.set_edge_label(1,0,'foo')
G.add_edge(1,1)
G.add_edge(1,3)
G.show(color_by_label=True, edge_thickness=2.5)
```
