For parents and elements implemented in Cython, category lookup is emulated in `__getattr__` using `getattr_from_other_class`. In this ticket, this is refactored a bit:

1. We should not pick up special attributes from `type`, there is no point in returning the type name of the category here (similarly for `__dict__`, `__mro__`, ...):

```
sage: ZZ(1).__name__
'JoinCategory.element_class'
sage: ZZ.__name__
'JoinCategory.parent_class'
```
This change causes a few failures which need to be fixed.

2. The implementation of `getattr_from_other_class` is not very robust. For example, static methods are not supported. We fix this by using low-level Python functions to get the attribute and we manually call the descriptor `__get__` if needed.

3. We shouldn't do anything special with double-underscore private attributes: in plain Python, this is implemented by the parser and not by `getattr()`. So `__getattr__` would already receive the mangled private name.

4. Some of the changes broke `_sage_src_lines_`, so we also change that: currently, `_sage_src_lines_()` is used both to get the source lines of a class (e.g. dynamic classes) and an instance (e.g. cached functions). We change this to always mean the source lines of an instance, which makes things clearer.

5. The lookup using `getattr_from_other_class` is about 9 times slower than a normal method lookup::

```
sage: def foo(self): return
sage: Sets().element_class.foo = foo
sage: def g(x):
....:     for i in range(1000):
....:          x.foo()

sage: x = Semigroups().example().an_element()
sage: y = 1

sage: %timeit g(x)
10000 loops, best of 3: 115 µs per loop

sage: %timeit g(y)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.18 ms per loop
```
We improve on this by roughly a factor 2 (but even then, it's still a lot slower than usual method lookup).

NOTE: This needs a trivial Cython patch, see #21030 for the Cython upgrade.

You meant 11am-2pm? Given that Santiago is -6h from Paris, it will be hard for me before 2pm (=8am in Santiago).

This ticket causes the category tests to be run (which is good) but then the tests fail.

```
sage: SGA = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: T = SGA.trivial_representation()
sage: H = SGA.hochschild_complex(T)
sage: H in CommutativeAdditiveGroups()
True
sage: H.zero()
...
TypeError: 'HochschildComplex' object is not callable
```

and

```
sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',3,1]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[1]+Lambda[2]+Lambda[3])
sage: V in CommutativeAdditiveGroups()
True
sage: V.zero()
...
TypeError: 'IntegrableRepresentation' object is not callable
```

I think the right thing to do here is to mark those tests as `# known bug`.
