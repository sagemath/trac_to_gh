For parents and elements implemented in Cython, category lookup is emulated in `__getattr__` using `getattr_from_other_class`. In this ticket, this is refactored a bit:

1. We should not pick up special attributes from `type`, there is no point in returning the type name of the category here (similarly for `__dict__`, `__mro__`, ...):

```
sage: ZZ(1).__name__
'JoinCategory.element_class'
sage: ZZ.__name__
'JoinCategory.parent_class'
```
This change causes a few failures which need to be fixed.

2. The implementation of `getattr_from_other_class` is not very robust. For example, static methods are not supported. We fix this by using low-level Python functions to get the attribute and we manually call the descriptor `__get__` if needed.

3. We shouldn't do anything special with double-underscore private attributes: in plain Python, this is implemented by the parser and not by `getattr()`. So `__getattr__` would already receive the mangled private name.

4. Some of the changes broke `_sage_src_lines_`, so we also change that: currently, `_sage_src_lines_()` is used both to get the source lines of a class (e.g. dynamic classes) and an instance (e.g. cached functions). We change this to always mean the source lines of an instance, which makes things clearer.

5. The lookup using `getattr_from_other_class` is about 9 times slower than a normal method lookup::

```
sage: def foo(self): return
sage: Sets().element_class.foo = foo
sage: def g(x):
....:     for i in range(1000):
....:          x.foo()

sage: x = Semigroups().example().an_element()
sage: y = 1

sage: %timeit g(x)
10000 loops, best of 3: 115 Âµs per loop

sage: %timeit g(y)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.18 ms per loop
```
We improve on this by roughly a factor 2 (but even then, it's still a lot slower than usual method lookup).

NOTE: This needs a trivial Cython patch, see #21030 for the Cython upgrade.

Aargh....... this whole "category lookup" mechanism is causing me so much frustration with #20767. It is a very fragile hack which just happens to work correctly in the current setting but when you change anything in the coercion model it breaks.

I am starting to think we should reconsider the whole category approach.

In #20767, I "solved" the category problem (see [comment:47]) in the following way:

- double-underscore methods (e.g. `__add__`) are never taken from the category.

- anything deriving directly from `Element` fully supports single-underscore methods (e.g. `_add_`) from the category.

- anything deriving from `ModuleElement`, `RingElement`,... has only partial support for single-underscore methods from the category.

- nothing changes for non-arithmetic methods (e.g. `base_ring`).

The above rules do not break any existing usage of categories. I hope you can live with this...

Those failures are true bugs in `HochschildComplex` and `IntegrableRepresentation`: they pretend to be in some category but do not actually implement everything needed to be in that category. This ticket causes the category tests to be run (which is good) but then the tests fail.

```
sage: SGA = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: T = SGA.trivial_representation()
sage: H = SGA.hochschild_complex(T)
sage: H in CommutativeAdditiveGroups()
True
sage: H.zero()
...
TypeError: 'HochschildComplex' object is not callable
```

and

```
sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',3,1]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[1]+Lambda[2]+Lambda[3])
sage: V in CommutativeAdditiveGroups()
True
sage: V.zero()
...
TypeError: 'IntegrableRepresentation' object is not callable
```

I think the right thing to do here is to mark those tests as `# known bug`.
