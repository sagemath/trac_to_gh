A `Wrapper_cdf` object is created by `fast_callable(f, vars=[], domain=None)` when the domain is set to `CDF`. The standard method of evaluating the function represented by the resulting object by simple calling it behaves normally.

However, the Cython-accesible method `Wrapper_cdf.call_c(double_complex* out, double_complex* in)` drops the imaginary component of the input and output. A demonstration of this behavior:

```
cython("""
from sage.ext.interpreters.wrapper_cdf cimport Wrapper_cdf

# The following is the self-proclaimed "hack" in the auto-gened file
# ext/interpreters/wrapper_cdf.pyx
cdef extern from "complex.h":
    ctypedef double double_complex "double complex"  # cannot just change "double" to "complex"
    cdef double creal(double_complex)
    cdef double cimag(double_complex)
    cdef double_complex _Complex_I

cdef inline complex call_c(Wrapper_cdf f, complex x, complex y):
    # Quickly evaluates a fast_callable function `f` on domain `CDF`
    # (a Wrapper_cdf tupe) with complex arguments `x`, and `y`.

    cdef double_complex[2] input
    cdef double_complex* output = [0]
    cdef complex value
    input[0] = <double_complex>x
    input[1] = <double_complex>y
    f.call_c(input, output)
    value = <complex>(output[0])
    return value

from sage.all import QQ, CDF, fast_callable

R = QQ['x,y']
x,y = R.gens()
f = y**3 - 2*x**3*y + x**7
f_fast = fast_callable(f, vars=[x,y], domain=CDF)

cdef complex a = 1. + 1.j
cdef complex b = 1. - 2.j

cdef complex value_sage = f_fast(a,b)
cdef complex value_c = call_c(f_fast,a,b)

print 'sage value:  ', value_sage
print 'call_c value:', value_c
""")

sage value:   (-7-18j)
call_c value: (-7+0j)
```

The source code for `Wrapper_cdf` is generated by `sage/src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters.py`. Within, there are some peculiar comments when it comes to defining the custom data type `double_complex`. The following is from [Line 2533](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters.py#L2533) where the Cython header for `Wrapper_cdf` is defined.

```
# We need the type double_complex to work around
#   http://trac.cython.org/ticket/869
# so this is a bit hackish.
cdef extern from "complex.h":
    ctypedef double double_complex "double complex"
```

But this seems to define `double_complex` as a `double`, which explains why the imaginary part is dropped. Since complex externs are not allowed in Cython(?) I tried changing this line to

```
ctypedef double complex double_complex "double complex"
```

but the following compilation error is raised

```

This part of the wrapper code is generated by [interpreters.py:3290](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters.py#L3290). Commenting out this `except?` part resolves the compile issue as well as the missing imaginary part problems. Attached is a patch which makes the appropriate `double_complex` fixes as well as, probably erroneously, comments out the except so that the code compiles.

(*Motivation: I would like to directly call the underlying C function of a `Wrapper_cdf` for performance purposes.*)

Of course! Below is the Cython input.

cdef inline complex call_c(Wrapper_cdf f, complex x, complex y):

R = QQ['x,y']

f = y**3 - 2*x**3*y + x**7
f_fast = fast_callable(f, vars=[x,y], domain=CDF)

cdef complex a = 1. + 1.j
cdef complex b = 1. - 2.j

cdef complex value_sage = f_fast(a,b)
cdef complex value_c = call_c(f_fast,a,b)

print 'sage value:  ', value_sage

And the corresponding output of the last two print statements:

```
sage value:   (-7-18j)

A workaround:

```
cdef inline complex call_c(Wrapper_cdf f, complex x, complex y):
    # Quickly evaluates a fast_callable function `f` on domain `CDF`
    # (a Wrapper_cdf tupe) with complex arguments `x`, and `y`.

    cdef double complex[2] input
    cdef double complex[1] output
    input[0] = x
    input[1] = y
    f.call_c(<double_complex*>input, <double_complex*>output)
    return output[0]
```

Huh. That's interesting. Thank you for the fix. At least, it gives me a way to solve my current problem.

However, I still don't understand why `double_complex` is defined to be a double in the generate code from `interpreters.py`. Would this still be considered something that needed fixing? After all, calls to `fast_callable` are somehow unaffected by this `ctypedef`.

Apologies for the false alarm. Thank you for the fix suggestion.
