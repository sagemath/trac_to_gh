(Observed on Mac OS X.)

As I reported in http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20708#comment:8:

When installing an "experimental" package, Sage warns a lot and then prompts the user. 
Because of line buffering, one does not see the prompt, but Sage just waits indefinitely.

```
sage -f latte_int
...
[latte_int-1.7.3] =========================== WARNING ===========================
[latte_int-1.7.3] You are about to download and install an experimental package.
[latte_int-1.7.3] This probably won't work at all for you! There is no guarantee
[latte_int-1.7.3] that it will build correctly, or behave as expected.
[latte_int-1.7.3] Use at your own risk!
[latte_int-1.7.3] ===============================================================
```
<--- This is where it asks "[latte_int-1.7.3] Are you sure you want to continue [Y/n]?" but this is line-buffered and not visible to the user.

I'm not sure what you suggest differently, other than moving the warning a little earlier?

But if someone doesn't read their build output it will be lost on them anyways.  That's okay, because it's "merely" a warning.

I think `./sage -i PACKAGENAMES...` should display the warning and the prompt before at the very beginning, before installing any package.

As per Volker's initial suggestion, a command-line switch `--experimental` should override the prompt. This would be useful in a script. I didn't know that `make PACKAGENAME` works; but in any case it would be better to be able to use "sage -i" also from a script.

<a id='comment:15'></a>`make <packagename>` is how all packages are built.  `sage -i` is just a thin front-end over that.

It appears the warning/prompt comes from the `sage-spkg` (which is the program responsible for unpacking the package, running `spkg-install`, etc) which is in turn called by make.  

I tried reworking this yesterday in a way that didn't change `sage-spkg`, but to make that prompt happen *right* away it would have to moved either into the makefile itself, or into the `sage` command, though I think it's good to have the warning when running `sage-spkg` too.  So I'd hate to have duplicate copies of the warning.

In other words it's not exactly clear where the best place would be for it.  Jeroen might have some ideas but he's on holiday right now so we won't bug him about it.

    "body": "<a id='comment:24'></a>And here I thought by relying entirely on bash features this would be portable.  Leave it to OSX to \"think different\"!\n\nMysteriously, on my bash `-n` is not quite the same as `-N` even with `IFS` unset.  I think the key is that for `-N` it reads \"Delimiter characters  encountered  in  the input are not treated specially and do not cause `read` to return until `nchars` are read\".  So in other words, hitting \"Enter\" with `-N 1` will cause read to return a newline literal.  Whereas for `-n` the delimiter is still treated specially and is *not* returned.

<a id='comment:24'></a>And here I thought by relying entirely on bash features this would be portable.  Leave it to OSX to "think different"!

Mysteriously, on my bash `-n` is not quite the same as `-N` even with `IFS` unset.  I think the key is that for `-N` it reads "Delimiter characters  encountered  in  the input are not treated specially and do not cause `read` to return until `nchars` are read".  So in other words, hitting "Enter" with `-N 1` will cause read to return a newline literal.  Whereas for `-n` the delimiter is still treated specially and is *not* returned.  Hitting Enter causes `read` to return with no characters read.  It should be made clear that here "delimiter" is referring to the delimiter that `read` should read up to, not the delimiter(s) used to split a line, which is what `IFS` is.

The solution is to use `-n`, but treat an empty string has having received a newline.

<a id='comment:50'></a>That's clearly the wrong solution to the problem.

Did anyone even *think* of performance when replacing `sed` by a character-by-character *shell loop* (in addition with two conditionals in it)?

One should probably try this on a single-, maybe dual-core machine.

Those scripts don't necessarily have any way to know that `sage-logger` is being used, nor should they.

I think the test of just `cat`ting is not quite fair either.  In a real build the overhead of the commands being run far outweighs the overhead of the logger.  For example running `make patch` on current `develop` I got:

```
real    2m14.225s
user    0m29.614s
sys     1m2.397s
```

while on my branch:

```
real    2m18.844s
user    0m38.751s
sys     1m4.341s
```

So maybe possibly a little slower but hard to say from a single data point.

There's no need to emphasize *shell loop* since it's using only shell built-ins, or should be, so that shouldn't be a significant source of overhead.  Ultimately `sed` is looping over one character at a time too.  One thing that might speed this up a bit is to not `printf` for every character, but at least buffer that.

Still, point partly taken.  I might prefer to go with my earlier instinct and just rewrite it in Python.  I think using `sed` just to prepend to a line also feels like a blunt instrument.

- `make build` from a fresh tarball + this branch: 93 minutes. Within that build, it took 29m57s to build `gcc`.

Following that:

While you could set some env var in "non-interactive" mode (or when the sage-logger is used), what's the problem with having a newline after `"... [Y/n]?"`?

\\

> I think the test of just `cat`ting is not quite fair either.  In a real build the overhead of the commands being run far outweighs the overhead of the logger.


The timings I listed are (the lower bound of) *consumed CPU time you get in addition* with every build from scratch (not taking into account a GCC build btw.); on a single-core that's what adds to the wall time (plus presumably the overhead of more context switches), and regardless of whether you build any experimental package (or any other question is asked). 

\\

> There's no need to emphasize *shell loop* since it's using only shell built-ins, or should be,


You were not using bash's built-in test (`[This is the Trac macro *... * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#... -macro)`), but the speed-up with the latter isn't huge either:

But it's not an interpreter, it compiles the regular expressions instead of rereading and interpreting them over and over, and btw. operates on lines of input -- you've seen the difference (orders of magnitude).

Please don't, `sed` is IMHO pretty adequate in lack of other portable tools for this trivial task (prepending something to each line); regarding that we meanwhile have separate log files for each package it's a bit superfluous though, even for parallel builds.  But *as is* (with `sed`), it doesn't hurt much.

(If at all, I'd personally rewrite the whole sage-logger in C.)

I had this discussion with Dima and we agreed that there should be no prompts when running `make` directly, and that there should only be such a prompt when using the high level interface of `./sage -i`.  So that's a large part of what this patch does, before getting mired in all the issues with the prompt itself.

Maybe I should just refactor things further so that `sage-spkg` itself never prompts (and hence the prompt is never raised during `make`, which calls `sage-spkg`), and instead the prompt is `only` issued by the `sage` script itself before any calls to `make`.

Point taken on this--I didn't believe this would happen as I did't think `make` would interleave the output of individual commands but it definitely can if it's waiting for output for some command, as is wont to happen with `configure`.  Though if you `make` is new enough (>=4.0) you can enable this behavior with `-Oline`. 

That said, this isn't just an issue with sage-logger.  This can happen even without it, and also happened with the previous version of the logger before I added the prefixing (and the line-buffering that came with it).

I do agree with Volker and others though that there's no reason for user input prompts in make.  So I'll go with my proposed solution above and move the prompt entirely to the top-level user interface, and that will simplify this whole matter greatly.

I would still propose keeping my Python implementation of sage-logger because why not?  I can change it to be line-based instead of character-based and that should actually make it faster than the current version by a bit, I think.

> +1 for python implementation instead of some untestable bash noise.


The only change I'd perhaps make to the sage-logger (which works and is sufficiently short and simple enough) is to replace `$SED "s/^/$prefix/"` by `cat` if the prefix is empty (i.e., no `-p` given), in order to win a *useless use of cat* award.  (More precisely, also move the argument to `sed` into `SED`, and let `SED=cat` if the prefix is empty.  Otherwise we'd have to nearly duplicate a line in case the prefix is empty.)

Also, it's fast enough with `sed` (see figures above), so reimplementing it in Python would IMHO be just yet another case of *needless use of Python* -- in a script that would be executed by *both* the system's Python and (later) Sage's.

I'd be happy with the current branch if Erik just removed the changes to sage-logger from it.

<a id='comment:79'></a>Replying to [comment:78 mkoeppe]:
> *** Priority** changed from critical to blocker


Could we then postpone beautifying the sage-logger to another ticket?

Or do we want to wait with the next release until Erik had a *"quiet, rainy day"*? ;-)

The one downside I see to this approach is that if you run `./sage -i <pkg>` for an experimental package, while it *will* display the warning prompt for that package, if `<pkg>` has any dependencies that are also experimental packages it will not display the prompt for those packages as well (it will still display a warning message).

I think this is acceptable--if the user is accepting to install one experimental package that can include everything that comes along with it.

In any case, the following is wrong:

```sh

        # Then make / install the package with no prompts
        $MAKE SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg $INSTALL_OPTIONS -y" "$OPT"

Yes, I hope that a follow-up ticket will do a proper solution, which prompts early (or just bails out and requires an extra flag), rather than prompting in the middle of a parallel build.

My simple solution just restores (except for cosmetics) the status quo before #20640, #20708 broke the prompting.
