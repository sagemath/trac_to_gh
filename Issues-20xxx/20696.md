<a id='comment:4'></a>A few changes I'd like you to do. For the `is_circuit_chordal` (and with underscore):

```diff
         INPUT: 
 
         - ``C`` -- a circuit
-        - ``certificate`` -- (optional) boolean, False if not given.
+        - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) boolean
 
         OUTPUT:
+
-        - Boolean,
-        and if certificate, ``(x, Ax, Bx)`` -- a cord ``x`` of ``C``, and circuits ``Ax`` and ``Bx`` showing that ``x`` is a chord, or None if the circuit is not chordal.
+        - boolean and if certificate is ``True``, also return a tuple
+          ``(x, Ax, Bx)``, where ``x`` is a chord and ``Ax`` and ``Bx``
+          are circuits whose union is ``C`` and ``x``, or ``None`` if
+          ``C`` is not chordal
```
For `is_chordal`:

```diff
         - ``k1`` -- (optional) the integer `k_1`
         - ``k2`` -- (optional) the integer `k_2`; if not specified,
           then this method returns if ``self`` is `k_1`-chordal
-        - ``certificate`` -- (optional) Boolean, False if not specified,
-          if true, and matroid is not chordal, returns a circuit which is not chordal.
+        - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) boolean;  if
+          ``True`` and ``self`` is not chordal, return a circuit
+          that is not chordal
```
Also you can specify to cython that `certificate` is a boolean by saying it is a `bint`.
