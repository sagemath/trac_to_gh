This works correctly:

```
sage: n=4;m=10;P = PolynomialRing(QQ,n*m,"x"); x = P.gens(); M = Matrix(n,x)
sage: M
[ x0  x1  x2  x3  x4  x5  x6  x7  x8  x9]
[x10 x11 x12 x13 x14 x15 x16 x17 x18 x19]
[x20 x21 x22 x23 x24 x25 x26 x27 x28 x29]
[x30 x31 x32 x33 x34 x35 x36 x37 x38 x39]
sage: I = P.ideal(M.minors(2))
sage: I.hilbert_series().numerator()
-84*t^3 - 108*t^2 - 27*t - 1
sage: factor(I.hilbert_series().denominator())
(t - 1)^13
```
but if I increase the number of columns by one, I get

```
sage: n=4;m=11;P = PolynomialRing(QQ,n*m,"x"); x = P.gens(); M = Matrix(n,x)

which is clearly not correct, as it can be checked with

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.function import singular_function
sage: hilb = singular_function("hilb")
sage: std = singular_function("std")
sage: hilb(std(I))
// ** _ is no standard basis

//       135 t^2
//       120 t^3
// dimension (proj.)  = 13

```

Where is the error?

44 is the number of generators of P in `n=4;m=11;P = PolynomialRing(QQ,n*m,"x");`, and Sage simply returns `(1-t)^P.ngens()`
as the denominator. Is this wrong mathematically?

The correct answer, as given in the second computation `hilb(std(I))`, is

```
( 120*t^3 + 135*t^2 + 30*t + 1 ) / (t-1)^14
```

well, for m=10 you only get the output above due to the fact that numerator has a factor (t-1)<sup>27</sup> that gets cancelled.

And for m=11 the numerator is irreducible, so no cancellation happens. Does this mean that it's only due to this cancellation accident in the m=10 case you get the same output in Sage as you expect?

Numerator is computed by Singular and so it should not give any bug, I guess...

I am not sure I follow what you mean -- in the m=10 case, the (afaik) correct Hilbert series is

```
( 84*t^3 + 108*t^2 + 27*t + 1 ) / (1 - t)^13

You can read the code of `I.hilbert_series` to see that it takes `I.hilbert_numerator()`, which is computed by Singular (again, read the code), and divides it by (t-1)<sup>P.ngens()</sup>.

So it is a bug in Singular, indeed.

I actually did read the code, but
* I only see "Singular is doing the computation" in `sage.libs.singular.function_factory.ff.hilb`,
* the output is then going to Sage in a way I don't know, and finally
* there is a polynomial division.
So a priori, the bug can be in either of these parts.

Anyway, it seems to be a bug in Singular, so I suggest to leave this ticket open until that is fixed, and then add a doctest for checking...

I would also appreciate if someone knowing how this Hilbert numerator is computed in Singular would send a bug report there (or shows me how to reproduce the bug in Singular).

I think you know that in the output of hilb(std(I)) (the part you omitted and indicated by ...) is the numerator that should be divisible by the appropriate power of t-1, but it is not.

As to writing up the corresponding Singular commands to show this... I can do this for you, although I didn't touch it for 5+ years...

It's all a bit Greek to me now, and https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/latest/sing_310.htm#SEC349 does not help much. 

Perhaps there is more than one way to compute this info, and Singular does something leading to the correct answer, even though the data it supplies to Sage is not correct.

You seem to know a reference for the correct answers to this question for all m, no? This would be handy in the bug report upstream.

This Hilbert series is known (though maybe implicit as some h vector of a simplicial complex), but I don't have a reference at hand. I will try to get one.

The reason it seemed suspicious is that I conjecture a term order for which its initial ideal is the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a simplicial sphere I was studying for completely different reasons. And this example was spit out to contradict that conjecture. But, as often, it was the code that's buggy and and not the conjectural description. That's anyway not yet in a form to be made public.

Note that in the current version 4.1.1p2.p0 of Singular, there is not a wrong result due to integer overflow, but an honest "int overflow error" is raised.

In my computations of group cohomology, I suffered from these overflow errors as well, which is why I opened #26243 and provided an implementation of Hilbert series computations that goes beyond Singular's limitations.

My implementation is not much slower than Singular in the examples in which Singular works. However, in #26243, I do not propose to use my implementation as default way to compute Hilbert series (in particular, I didn't touch the `.hilbert_numerator()` method of multipolynomial ideals). However, if you consider to use it in the `.hilbert_*()` methods by default in order to fix *this* ticket: Go ahead!

EDIT: The failing example from here became doctest for the code from #26243.

If I see that correctly, the following functions need to be taken care of (all in sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal):
- `hilbert_series`: Here we can use what I called `hilbert_poincare_series` in sage.rings.hilbert (name according to both the book of Greuel and Pfister, and to the article of Bigatti).
- `hilbert_numerator`: Here we can use what I called `first_hilbert_series` in sage.rings.hilbert (name according to the book of Greuel and Pfister).
- `hilbert_polynomial`: This needs to be re-implemented.

If I understand correctly, one wouldn't provide degree weights for `hilbert_polynomial`, and I think it is easy enough to follow Definition 5.1.4 in the Greuel-Pfister book.

Thanks. I'll aim for that.

I have done that before, so I should be able to do it for this. :-)

Yes, the Hilbert series is non-polynomial for non-standard weights, and I understand that finding formulas for this is an area of research that no one is actually involved in, unless someone extended the work of Massimo Caboara's Master's student about 4-5 years ago.

With the new commit, the stuff from #26243 is used for all Hilbert series computations. The tests in sage/rings/polynomial pass, so, I guess it is "needs review" (I trust that the patchbot will run full tests).

For the record, here is a timing that comes out of some of my cohomology computations, in a size that Singular can manage:

```

> Impressive speedup! Where does it come from? A better algorithm?

I am not totally sure. We have to distinguish: `hilbert_numerator` and `hilbert_series` on the one hand, and `hilbert_polynomial` on the other hand.

The computation of "first Hilbert series" (also known as "Hilbert numerator") and "Hilbert-Poincaré series" (also known as "Hilbert series") relies on a new implementation introduced at #26243. The original motivation was to allow for really big computations (>70 variables, >2000 ideal generators) that would fail in Singular because of its 32-bit integer limitation. But in the end, it was also about speed: The new implementation beats Singular in medium size examples.

The algorithm for the Hilbert-Poincaré series isn't exactly new, but differs from what is done in Singular as follows. Let `I` be a monomial ideal in a multivariate polynomial Ring `R` and let `m` be a monomial of degree `d`. Then, I think all implementations for the computation of the Hilbert-Poincaré series `HP(R/I)` rely on the equation `HP(R/I) = HP(R/(I+m))+t^d*HP(R/(I:(m)))`. The differences lie in the choice of m. Some systems choose m as one of the generators of I and read the above equation backwards: ` HP(R/(I+m)) = HP(R/I) - t^d*HP(R/(I:(m)))`. Singular chooses m to be a variable that appears in at least one generator of degree >1 of I. I think CoCoA uses the gcd of two randomly chosen generators. My implementation chooses m to be the variable that appears most frequently in the generators of I, to the power of the median of all exponents of that variable in the generators of I.

I was told by John Perry that this choice is known in the literature, but I don't have a reference. Anyway, I think part of the speedup is due to good data structures and careful usage of Cython.

However, all of the above doesn't apply here. With the example of the above timing for `hilbert_polynomial`, the timings for `hilbert_numerator` and `hilbert_series` have hardly changed. With Singular:

```
sage: %timeit I.hilbert_numerator()
The slowest run took 4.14 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000 loops, best of 3: 270 µs per loop
sage: %timeit I.hilbert_series()
The slowest run took 5.27 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000 loops, best of 3: 375 µs per loop
```
With the new implementation:

```
sage: %timeit I.hilbert_numerator()
1000 loops, best of 3: 280 µs per loop
sage: %timeit I.hilbert_series()
The slowest run took 5.73 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000 loops, best of 3: 367 µs per loop
```

So, in *this* example, the change really is in the computation of `hilbert_polynomial`. Since my code is just straight forward, I really don't know why the old code was so much slower.

By playing with a bigger example (where `I` is the ideal defined in the attachment to #26243), I found that I got the sign wrong, meaning that depending on the example I got the correct polynomial or its negative. The new commit fixes it.

With the new commit and the example from #26243, I get consistent results (i.e., the Hilbert polynomial seems to return the coefficients of the Hilbert-Poincaré series for all but finitely many degrees):

```

OK. I was not sure if a factorisation object behaves the same as a list.

This is true in basically every case I've come across:

```
sage: f = factor(123521321)
sage: f
7 * 11 * 997 * 1609
sage: %timeit bool(len(f))
The slowest run took 35.73 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 334 ns per loop
sage: %timeit bool(f)
The slowest run took 34.95 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 314 ns per loop
```

I changed the (old!) error message to lower case and removed the full-stop. And I hope the style is now enough "spacey"...

Moreover, I added an optional parameter `algorithm`.

However, one thing is very very strange now. A doctest that previously worked is now still giving the correct result, but also showing an odd comment; this does NOT happen when running the test interactively:

```
File "src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py", line 2506, in sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal.?.hilbert_series
Failed example:
    I.hilbert_series()
Expected:
    (t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1)/(t^2 - 2*t + 1)
Got:
       skipping text from `parameter`
    (t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1)/(t^2 - 2*t + 1)
```
WTH??

"not tested" might be an option. If I understand correctly, "known bug" would still mean that it is tested, right? That would be bad, because of the side-effect of the error.

In any case, I will open a new ticket so that the side-effect can be fixed. And I would prefer to remove the test for now and introduce it at the new ticket (showing that the side-effect is fixed).

Yes, that is good. I made a few other tweaks to match PEP8 and our coding/doc conventions in Sage. If my changes are good, then positive review.

PEP8 allows you to not write spaces for higher priority operators. So like in the exponentiation, that is higher than the addition, and thus, I don't need the spaces around the `**`. Of course, that is my own stylistic preference showing. :) For this:

```diff
-    def hilbert_series(self, grading = None, algorithm = 'sage'):
+    def hilbert_series(self, grading=None, algorithm='sage'):
```

```diff
-                return self.hilbert_numerator(algorithm = 'singular') / (1 - t)**n
+                return self.hilbert_numerator(algorithm='singular') / (1 - t)**n
```
PEP8 says arguments should not have space around the `=`.

Some of these things are not directly specified in the Sage doc conventions, but done as a general accepted-ish convention. At least, an `optional` to me means it does not have a default value (in some appropriate sense of the term for a user).

My intention (although I quite often do typos) is to put spaces around...
- assignments of variables (but not of optional arguments): `bla = foo(bar)`
- comparisons: `if bla <= foo:`
- `+` and `-`
- after (but not before) a comma or semicolon
and to *not* put spaces around
- `*`, `/` and `**`, because they have higher priority than `+` and `-`: `(2*x - 1)**4)`
- assignments of optional arguments: `foo(bla, bar=4)`

Actually I dislike `(4 * x - 1) ** 3`, I find it difficult to read.

Would the above comply to PEP8?
