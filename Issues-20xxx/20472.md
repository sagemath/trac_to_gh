No idea what you mean. It's broken, anyway:

```
$ sage -p mercurial
Attempting to download package mercurial
Downloading the Sage mirror list
...

Error: could not find a package matching mercurial

       Did you mean: brial?
```

Why are you using `sage -p` to install packages? That's a low-level command that you should only use "if you know what you're doing". With `sage -i mercurial`, it works fine.

given that `sage --pip install blah` is available, you **create** more complexity by adding `sage -i blah`
