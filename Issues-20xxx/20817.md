This patch will add "interface part" to orthocomplementation. Implementation has already been done at #20769.

Code is trivial, so this is just about examples and design: should we have separate `is_uniquely_orthocomplemented()`? Are examples good? How about explanation about what is an orthocomplementation?

Whatever. IIRC `\wedge` and `\\wedge` are OK in any case, but if you start with `"""` instead of `r"""` then you must use `\\vee` and not `\vee`.

And I don't like remembering this kind of things.
