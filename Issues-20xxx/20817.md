This patch will add "interface part" to orthocomplementation. Implementation has already been done at #20769.

Code is trivial, so this is just about examples and design: should we have separate `is_uniquely_orthocomplemented()`? Are examples good? How about explanation about what is an orthocomplementation?

And I don't like remembering this kind of things.

Yes I had, just like we already have `ordinal_summands()`. But that should be done to all digraphs, I think. Sage hase factoring of undirected graphs already. For posets only we should have inverse of ordinal product.
