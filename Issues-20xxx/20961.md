Without this patch (or something like it) pycrypto does not build on Cygwin.  Please see the commit message for more detail.

This patch should almost certainly be applied *only* on Cygwin, as that's the only (common-ish) platform that is likely affected.  The configuration that the patch is removing was claimed to be needed for FreeBSD and NetBSD, and I can't be sure what impact it has on other platforms (though it's probably harmless on Linux).

Keywords: **windows cygwin pycrypto**
