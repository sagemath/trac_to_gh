Currently, the generators of a relative number field (including images of generators of the base field) are computed on initialisation.  This causes a slowdown when applying #20749; see [#20749 comment:5](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/20749#comment:5).

The slow initalisation can be solved using "lazier" implementations of the methods `gen()`, `gens()`, `ngens()` and `_first_ngens()` of `NumberField_relative`.  In combination with #20749, this means that the somewhat expensive method `_nf_nfzk()` will only be called the first time an element from the base field is mapped to the relative field.  This is probably the most reasonable point at which to call `_nf_nfzk()`.
