}
```
The following works:

```
   C = LinearCode(random_matrix(GF(5^2,'a'), 2, 5)); C.minimum_distance()
```

while the following explodes with a GAP error

```
   C = LinearCode(random_matrix(GF(17^2,'a'), 2, 5)); C.minimum_distance()
```

It seems to be conditioned only on the size of the field: All fields with cardinality greater than 256 seem to fail.

The GAP algorithms which sage is calling for minimum_distance() have a (poorly) documented limitation -- field size of at most 256.
I added a check on the field size and raise a "not implemented" exception in that case.   So at least the user will get some explanation 
of the problem rather than an incomprehensible stack dump.

Some minor things:
- I would put the fact that this only works for fields up to 256 in either a `.. NOTE::` or `.. WARNING::` block so it's more prominent in the documentation.
- You should add something just before the added doctest, something like `The field must be size at most 256::`. I would also split the line like this:

  ```
            NotImplementedError: The GAP algorithms that sage is using
             are limited to computing with fields of size at most 256.
  ```
- To be PEP8 compliant, you should align the string start points:

  ```python
            raise NotImplementedError("the GAP algorithm that Sage is using "
                                      "is limited to computing with fields "
                                      "of size at most 256")
  ```
  I've also suggested a few minor changes to the error message. Although I might consider limiting the actual message to something like `the field must have size at most 256` with a more detailed comment just before it saying the issue is in GAP for those looking at the code itself.
