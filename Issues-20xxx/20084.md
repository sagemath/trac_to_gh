```
The complex function `f(s) = 1/(1 - 2^(-s))` has poles of residue `1/log(2)` at `s = 2*k*pi*I/log(2)` for all integers `k`.

Currently sage recognize these poles just at `s=0`:

```
sage: f(s).residue(s==0)
1/log(2)
sage: f(s).residue(s==2*pi*I/log(2))
0
```

In essence, this happens because the `series`-method does not recognize the pole. The priority is critical because mathematically wrong output is produced.

<a id='comment:1'></a>The most elegant solution would of course be the automatic simplification of expressions like `2^(something/log(2)) --> exp(something)`, such that

```
sage: 2^(2*pi*I/log(2))
1
```

However, I'm not sure if that can be achieved so easily.

A second suggestion would be something like

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx b/src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
index 3a5c864..175bcad 100644

```
where there are several ways to refine this approach: 

- introduce an additional keyword that could disable this additional simplification such that performance does not suffer necessarily,
- only try to simplify for complex arguments of `a`

and so on.

Thoughts?

<a id='comment:7'></a>Yes, I have faint memory of improving something with `series` itself some time ago; thanks for reminding me.

Actually, there are more problems with `residue`. Take, for example,

```
sage: (1/sqrt(x^2)).residue(x==0)
0
sage: (1/sqrt(x^2)).canonicalize_radical().residue(x==0)
1
```

(Note that this is, in some sense, a pathological example.)

The ideal fix in this case (IMHO) would be to throw an error that the residue could not be computed as the "correct" branch of the root could not be chosen automatically. I think that just applying `canonicalize_radical` before computing the residue just introduces more grief as the user looses all control over which branch is chosen.

In any case: the original problem reported with this ticket is solved, so this is probably just wontfix. Other opinions?

cool. for what i've been told from other tickets, i suppose this one should should still provide the test (not wontfix): 

```
Check that :trac:`20084` is fixed::

    sage: (1/(1 - 2^-x)).residue(x == 2*pi*I/log(2))
    1/log(2)
```

> Actually, there are more problems with residue.

yes. one could come up with other examples (e.g. examples involving log(z)). i agree that just applying `canonicalize_radical` is not a good idea for the reason you stated. but is there a simple way to identify these cases without much hurdle? does this belong to `series` method or is sth that can be done at the level of `residue`?
