Every file or directory in the upstream tarball for elliptic_curves contains a corresponding `._<filename>` file containing OSX-specific "extended attributes" for the file.  Those should be stripped out when creating the tarball.

Is this just a Sage issue or a problem upstream as well?  It's not always clear to me since I'm not sure if/when we're using unmodified source tarballs.

I have made a new tarball here:

John, are these tarballs actually hosted somewhere? The `SPKG.txt` file doesn't really say how to obtain the tarballs.

I couldn't easily find them on http://johncremona.github.io/ecdata/ nor https://github.com/JohnCremona/ecdata but I might be missing something.

This package has nothing to do with me despite what it says in the SPKG.txt file.

I think the cremona_mini is the standard package which comes for free; again I did not create it and have never touched it.  I only touch the real one called database_cremona_ellcurve*.  The other part of it is something William put in years ago.

Fine. Let's fix the `SPKG.txt` file then...

Still, the question of [comment:1] remains: is this tarball available somewhere or is it created specifically for Sage?

While I've worked on many (if not all) spkgs over the years, I've never seen such garbage in *vanilla* upstream tarballs.  (Occasionally, there had been harmless leftovers like backup files from editors, or cache files from autotools which don't have to get shipped, but IIRC only in tarballs from projects closely related to Sage.)

Note that in the past, the upstream sources were part of the spkgs (now so-called legacy spkgs), and even to that time, it rarely happened that Sage developers accidentally included such files when creating an spkg, and it was part of the review process to make sure that a) the upstream sources are vanilla (modulo removed files we don't need, such as large prepared documentation, redundant sources of prerequisites, or e.g. Microsoft Visual Foo project files), and b) there are no additional files (like those mentioned above, including `.DS_Store` etc.).

I personally would have made *this* ticket a blocker, rather than #20842, in addition to modifications to the release, dist and/or upload scripts.

Ping.

I don't think it's minor if we have to work around that elsewhere.  (In fact, doing so introduced other regressions in `sage-uncompress-spkg`.)

On the other hand, I cannot judge how "dangerous" such files are on MacOS X; they don't hurt elsewhere at least (other than increasing disk usage, transfer times etc.)

When our elliptic_curves package is fixed, we can simply bail out in the future if a tarball contains such files, which is better for reviewing anyway, since we won't ever get that trouble again.

I checked out the branch (from a successful build of 8.8.beta0) and triggered (with make) a totally unnecessarily rebuild of a lot of stuff, since the commit on this ticket was based on 8.7.beta?.  So I killed that and rebased this onto 8.8.beta0 and am now building.

The tarball looks fine to me since the only diffs are the missing underscore files which were the problem in the first place.

I am happy with the changes to SPKG.txt *but* the tarball is called elliptic_curves-0.8.1.tar.bz2  yet unpacks into elliptic_curves-0.9 .  Surely that is not intended?
