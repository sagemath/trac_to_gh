The file `src/sage/finance/stock.py` contains this line

```
def history(self,startdate='Jan+1,+1900',enddate=date.today().strftime("%b+%d,+%Y"), histperiod='daily'):
```
The causes today's date to be hard-coded in the argspec and in the `__doc__`, which makes little sense. It is better to use `None` as default argument and then change `None` to today in the function body.

Note that doctests don't pass neither with or without this branch.
