Even if there are identical generator and variable names there should not be a problem to convert from a univariate polynomial with symbolic coefficients to a symbolic expression, but:

```
sage: S.<y> = PolynomialRing(SR)
sage: p = y^2 + pi*y + 1
sage: p.coefficients()
[1, pi, 1]
sage: ex = SR(p)
...
TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```
See #20453 and #20312 for motivation.

You can get a morphism that does this:

```
sage: H=Hom(S,SR)(SR('y'))
sage: H(p)
(pi + y)*y + 1
```
