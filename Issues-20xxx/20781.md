We currently cannot ctrl-C interrupt the `integral_points()` of a polyhedron:

```
sage: ieqs = [(-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1),
....:         (0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
....:         (0, -1, 0, 2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
....:         (0, 0, -1, -1, 2, -1, 0, 0, 0),
....:         (0, 2, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
....:         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 2),
....:         (1, 0, 2, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
....:         (0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 2, -1, 0, 0),
....:         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1),
....:         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 2, -1, 0),
....:         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 2, -1)]
sage: P = Polyhedron(ieqs=ieqs)
sage: P
A 8-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^8 defined as the convex hull of 43 vertices
sage: P.integral_points() # Cannot ctrl-C out of this
```
Likely some `sig_check()` calls are needed.
