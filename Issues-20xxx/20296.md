If one has to solve a small LP with irrational (say, `AA`) data (and needs access to the exact solution), the only available tool is the didactical implementation of the simplex method in `InteractiveLPProblem` (but see #18735). This ticket implements a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` backend using `InteractiveLPProblem`.

Example:

```
            sage: poly = polytopes.dodecahedron(base_ring=AA)
            sage: lp = poly.to_linear_program(solver='InteractiveLP')
            sage: b = lp.get_backend()
            sage: b.set_objective([1, 1, 1])
            sage: lp.solve()
            2.291796067500631?
```
(This example uses backend functions because of #20301; and the `base_ring=AA` is there because of #13041.)

I think so - the reason they are missing is that they were never needed before. Using guts directly makes sense inside of ILLP itself, but now that you have a dependent module there has to be documented and tested way to access them.

>  - There's should be a way to choose the base ring for the solver (right now I'm using AA -- but ultimately I'd like to use an embedded number field), but I'm not sure about the interface... perhaps  ` MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver=('InteractiveLP', AA)) ` or `MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='InteractiveLP', base_ring=AA`


`base_ring=AA` seems to be more common (and I think it is common to use `ring` even when only field would really make sense).

Two more things regarding `InteractiveLPProblem`:
- I think `InteractiveLPProblem.standard_form` should allow the user to pass names for the slack variables
- It would be nice if `InteractiveLPProblem`would support an additive constant in the objective function (see `obj_constant_term` in my code)

OK, I've changed it. 
For my code, it does not make any difference because I don't construct "-max" or "-min" problems. 
I only have to deal with `is_negative` once, for the standard-form problem that is created while solving.

Yes, I'm hoping that someone on the Cc list could take a look...

Regarding variable names, it is sort of by design that auxiliary variable can be one of the decision ones - that's how auxiliary problems are distinguished. It may not be the best choice but changing it should be done carefully. In all other cases name clashes should throw errors and users are responsible for either adjusting their choices or overriding defaults to avoid conflict.

```

anyway, that `p.get_values(x)` ought to be fixed, perhaps on another ticket. By now you can still make this ticket depend on #20301, and give the above (without `p.get_values(x)`) as a doctest. 
Or perhaps you know a workaround to get the values regardless?
