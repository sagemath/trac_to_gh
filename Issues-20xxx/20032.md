This adds "arb" as an algorithm and makes it the default since it is faster (and provably correct modulo bugs).

Timings:

```
sage: %timeit hilbert_class_polynomial(-103, algorithm="arb");
10000 loops, best of 3: 74.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit hilbert_class_polynomial(-103, algorithm="sage");
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.13 ms per loop

sage: %time a=hilbert_class_polynomial(-10000003, algorithm="arb");
CPU times: user 24.4 s, sys: 43.9 ms, total: 24.4 s
Wall time: 24.4 s
sage: %time b=hilbert_class_polynomial(-10000003, algorithm="sage");
CPU times: user 5min, sys: 509 ms, total: 5min 1s
Wall time: 5min 1s
sage: a == b
True
```
