Change ring for subschemes does not let the user specify an embedding and so fails for QQbar

```
K.<w>=QuadraticField(2)
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
X = P.subscheme(x-y)
X.change_ring(QQbar)
```

```
K.<w>=QuadraticField(2)
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
X = P.subscheme(x-y)
H = End(X)
f = H([6*x^2+2*x*y+16*y^2,-3*x^2-4*x*y-4*y^2])
f.change_ring(QQbar)
```

```
X=Scheme(Q,...)

Then we can have that `X.base_change(GF(3))` can still raise an error (because it's not well-defined), but we can still get an answer.

The problem is that we don't have a channel to reliably report warnings through. If you print them in places where people aren't particularly looking for output, they are easily missed. In fact, STDOUT might be redirected to /dev/null, and messages on STDERR might be hard to match up with the rest of the data (if it gets read at all).

To quote the Zen of Python: "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.". I'm not for following the Zen religiously, but I think it's a good principle. In this case, I think the error is a more honest and ultimately more reliable solution than making some non-canonical guess.

```

just works and 'guesses' what embedding to use.

However, if just raising an error is more in-line with similar other functionality, I can do that instead.
