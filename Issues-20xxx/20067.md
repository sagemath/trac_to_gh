Change ring for subschemes does not let the user specify an embedding and so fails for QQbar

```
K.<w>=QuadraticField(2)
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
X = P.subscheme(x-y)
X.change_ring(QQbar)
```

```
K.<w>=QuadraticField(2)
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
X = P.subscheme(x-y)
H = End(X)
f = H([6*x^2+2*x*y+16*y^2,-3*x^2-4*x*y-4*y^2])
f.change_ring(QQbar)
```

Can't we just make sure that `base_change` or `change_ring` can also be given a ring homomorphism from the base ring, to base extend to the codomain of the homomorphism? Then

```
X=Scheme(Q,...)
k=GF(3)
Xk=X.base_change(k.convert_map_from(QQ))
```
would work (provided we don't check if the map really is a homomorphism).
Then we can have that `X.base_change(GF(3))` can still raise an error (because it's not well-defined), but we can still get an answer.

I understand the concern and definitely didn't want to silently guess, hence the verbose warning. However, there was some precedent since

```
K.<w>=CyclotomicField(3)
CC(w)
```
just works and 'guesses' what embedding to use.

However, if just raising an error is more in-line with similar other functionality, I can do that instead.

I think this new version is cleaner and is ready to be reviewed.

btw, there seems to be a doc failure on 7.1.beta5 which is merged with this ticket that is unrelated.

```
src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx

It fails with and without these changes.
