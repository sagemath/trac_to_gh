Right now, I'm happy with the code except for in basis_exchange_matroid, `M1._is_isomorphic(M2, True)` yields the output `(True, True)` on line 2272, and similarly on line 2278. This doesn't seem to be something that I caused directly, but might be due to the following code found in `_isomorphism()` in basis_matroid.pyx (lines 980-981). 

```
if not isinstance(other, BasisMatroid):
    return BasisExchangeMatroid._is_isomorphic(self, other)
```

I'm not sure exactly how to tell what type of matroid a thing is when it gets instigated. Regardless, is there any reason why we don't want to or are unable to return an isomorphism in the above case?

My question was why we are calling `is_isomorphic` instead of `isomorphism`. For instance, the following comes from an unedited version of sage. But I would expect a dictionary instead of a boolean.

```
sage: from sage.matroids.advanced import *
sage: M1 = BasisMatroid(matroids.Wheel(3))
sage: M2 = matroids.CompleteGraphic(4)
sage: M1.isomorphism(M2)
True
```

So I think that this is a bug in Sage.

A few minor things:

* There's some extraneous whitespace after your commas -- use `git trac review` to see it easily.
* You haven't fully made the `cert` to `certificate` change. The pxd files are causing errors upon compilation because of it.
* In the doctests, you should specify the option, ie: `M.is_isomorphic(N, certificate=True)`
* In the output part of the docstring, you should say what that the dictionary shows the isomorphism, and None is output when the matroids aren't isomorphic.

First, you have a bunch of doubled-up doctests (one with the explicit option, one without).

This happens (it's due to a capital C):

Last doctest in BasisExchangeMatroid is missing the explicit option.

Around line 2694 in `linear_matroid.pyx`, you've removed an extra space. It should be `return True, None`.

You've dropped an I from INPUT around line 355 of `circuit_closures_matroid.pyx`, and lines 3265, 4312, 5941 of `linear_matroid.pyx`
