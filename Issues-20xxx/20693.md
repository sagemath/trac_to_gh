This ticket used to be about a crash that occurred when computing newforms for a certain character of modulus 23 in sage 7.2.
Here's how to reproduce it (you have to wait 10 minutes or so until the crash happens):

```
sage: D=DirichletGroup(23)
sage: c=D.gen()^2
sage: N=Newforms(c,6, names='a')
```

It turned out that this was due to NTL running out of FFT primes when inverting number field elements with humongous denominators. Moreover, it turned out that we only ran into this problem in the example (and other examples in the comments) because the function `_invert_c_()` of a number field element was doing unnecessary work.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Let me add something that might be helpful in finding the bug:
I get the same / a similar crash when doing the following, which is how I discovered it in the first place.
It confirms what the crash looks like above, that the real bug lies somewhere in the linear algebra and/or number field code.

```
sage: D=DirichletGroup(23)
sage: c=D.gen()^2
sage: M=ModularSymbols(c,6,sign=1)
sage: S=M.cuspidal_subspace().new_subspace()
sage: A=D[0]
sage: v  = A.dual_eigenvector(names='a', lift=False)
```

And crash...

```

Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

And let me also add that I tried a binary distribution of sage 7.1 on yet another machine as well with the Newforms(...) function and got the same crash.

<a id='comment:9'></a>To investigate the crash, it may help to add `sig_on()...sig_off()` around the NTL calls in `sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element.NumberFieldElement._invert_c_()`.

For the slowdown, I tried the following with increasing weights:

```
sage: G = DirichletGroup(17)
sage: %prun Newforms(G[2], 8, names='a')
```
Indeed, the method `dual_eigenvector()` takes up more and more of the time; more precisely, most of it is spent in a number of calls to the PARI function `eltreltoabs()`:

<a id='comment:10'></a>`@`jdemeyer

I'm sorry, I guess I misinterpreted the "Author" field. I probably won't write code for this as I think the bugs and performance problems come from relative extensions of number fields and I don't know much about the code (and most of it is pari in some way, I guess).

My example in http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20693#comment:2 was missing lines, sorry again.
I guess what I meant was

```
sage: D=DirichletGroup(23)
sage: c=D.gen()^2
sage: M=ModularSymbols(c,6,sign=1)
sage: S=M.cuspidal_subspace().new_subspace()
sage: Dec = S.decomposition()
sage: A=Dec[0]
sage: v =A.dual_eigenvector(names='a', lift=False)
```

To get a crash you have to let it run quite some time (I don't remember how long exactly it was, maybe 15 minutes, I can restart it and let you know).
I'm not sure if there much simpler/faster examples that crash but I can check.

I can come up with more examples for sure. Indeed you have to wait quite a bit until you see a crash sometimes, I had a computation running for Gamma0(19) and weight 14 for 2 days or so until I saw the crash (but I didn't run out of memory or anything else trivial and it also used to work on the same machine with the same space (and sage should really be able to do it!).

`@`nbruin I'll try to find some time to check out sage 6.1 again and compute some spaces that also run in sage 7.2 and then get back to you with some profiling results. 

I did similar profiling tests as you did, `@`pbruin and discovered that the main reason for this being slow is that elements in the base ring (a cyclotomic field) get coerced into a relative extension (obtained by adjoining the roots of a hecke polynomial). This is damn slow for some reason (note that it is stated in the documentation of relative number fields that doing arithmetic in number field towers is very slow but it seems that it got worse than it used to be). I discovered that such operations can be accelerated by very stupid means. For instance, instead of coercing an element e of K into an extension L directly, write it in terms of a power basis (e.list()), coerce the generator of K into L and create the element corresponding to e in L directly. I can document some examples later.

> I did similar profiling tests as you did, `@`pbruin and discovered that the main reason for this being slow is that elements in the base ring (a cyclotomic field) get coerced into a relative extension (obtained by adjoining the roots of a hecke polynomial). This is damn slow for some reason (note that it is stated in the documentation of relative number fields that doing arithmetic in number field towers is very slow but it seems that it got worse than it used to be). I discovered that such operations can be accelerated by very stupid means. For instance, instead of coercing an element e of K into an extension L directly, write it in terms of a power basis (e.list()), coerce the generator of K into L and create the element corresponding to e in L directly. I can document some examples later.

It turns out that `NumberField_relative.__base_inclusion()` uses a PARI function that is too general (and hence too slow) for this purpose.  I opened #20749 to address this.

After #20749, `dual_eigenvector()` only takes up 28% of the time; before, it was 69%.

<a id='comment:15'></a>My old examples still crash with #20749 applied.
Unfortunately, it does not seem like these were very easy to compute with sage 6.1; everything I tested so far runs in fact much slower in sage 6.1 (which is good, I guess). [Let me mention, although a bit off-topic, that magma computes the newforms in weight 4 in the example above in 0.5s and in weight 6 in 7.5s.]

Now, as for the crash, first of all there is no crash with #20749 when running

```
N=Newforms(DirichletGroup(23).gen()^2,6, names='a')
```
However, I now get the more informative

```
PariError: the PARI stack overflows (current size: 2147483648; maximum size: 2147483648)
You can use pari.allocatemem() to change the stack size and try again.
```
After doing so:

```
sage: pari.allocatemem(2147483648*4)
```
I get a crash again. For some reason this crash is not informative at all on OSX, I will have to run it on Linux to see the backtrace, I guess.

Also, your level 17 example is quite good because by increasing the weight only by one to 9, I the same behaviour (PARI stack overflow, crash when increasing it). Try:

```
sage: c=DirichletGroup(17).gen()
sage: %time Newforms(c,9, names='a')
```

Indeed, after finally managing to get sage run in gdb on OSX, I get

Is this a bug in NTL? Is it documented anywhere that this might fail? Can we know in advance that this will happen so that we don't have to run into _invert_c_c()?

The method `_invert_c()` should be declared `except *` instead of `except +`, and you have to wrap the NTL calls in `sig_on()...sig_off()`.  I made the following changes (not sure if the `except +` on `ZZX_XGCD` is actually necessary):

<a id='comment:24'></a>`@`pbruin: Great! Thanks a lot for your work!

However, the pari alternative seems to be kind of slow (which is much better than crashing, of course).
With the example I gave in #20749, the pari inversion takes about 7 minutes but the code below, which mimics the _invert_c function, runs in about 1.5 minutes for me:

```
d = alpha.polynomial().denominator()
D = alpha.parent().absolute_polynomial().denominator()
r,s,tt = xgcd(alpha.polynomial().numerator()*D,alpha.parent().absolute_polynomial().numerator()*d)
b = s*d/D
F = alpha.parent()
beta = F(F.polynomial_quotient_ring()(b))
```

I don't like the last line of the code and I still have to make sure I understood everything correctly and it works in all cases but then I could submit a patch for the number field element to use a variant of this code as an alternative. What do you think?

    ZZX_mul_ZZ(num[0], num[0], self.__fld_denominator.x )
    ZZX_mul_ZZ(num[0], num[0], self.__denominator )
```

So, I'm not sure if it's worth it to include the flint alternative.
But I found something else that even avoids the NTLError to happen and makes the newforms computations way faster in many cases!
I'm cleaning up my branch now after a lot of testing and will then push the changes, including your pari alternative.

<a id='comment:30'></a>OK, so I really tried a lot of things and I came to the conclusion that what is currently done in `_invert_c_` of `number_field_element.pyx` is too much work, "causes" the NTLError in the cases at hand and inversion can be made much much faster with a minimal change.

The main point is this: Currently, given a number field element of the form x/d, where (if I understood it correctly), x is a polynomial with integer coeffs and d is an integer, modulo a polynomial M/D, where again M is a poly with integer coeffs and M an integer, the code sets

```
a = x*D
b = M*d
```
and computes `r, s, t`, such that

```
  r = s*a + t*b.
```
Thus, `s/r` is the inverse of `a=x*D` modulo  `b=M*d` (with rational coefficients, in Q[X]/(dM)).
Now, I don't really now why this is done and maybe I misunderstand something but I think taking `dM` here is unnecessary and slows everything down. Anyway, the result is that

```
  1 = s/r*D*d*x/d + t*D/(r*d)*d*M/D
```
And so the code returns `s/r*D*d` as the inverse.
 
What I did was to instead set

```
a = x*D
b = M
```
and  then again compute `r,s,t` as above so that now `s/r` is the inverse of `a` modulo `M` with rational coefficients, i.e.
in Q[X]/(M). This means that we get

```
  1 = s/r*D*d*x/d + t*D/r*M/D
```
which shows that modulo M/D, we get that `s/r*D*d` is the inverse.
Now, after I wrote this down, it also seems that multiplying `x` by `D` is not needed.
I will try this out and push the changes immediately.

Btw, all doctests pass.

I also added some doctests to make sure we always test that this issue here is resolved.
However, since the example I had at hand is so large, it adds a lot of junk to the source code which I don't like very much.
Is there any way to add an external test, that's not necessary in the dotstring in sage (no nosetests at all???)?

Yes, it might make sense to have a place for tests that are too long to write down or take too much time to run.  I agree that this is not the place to discuss this further.

I included your commit in my branch and added a reviewer commit (typographical fixes and using `x.__invert__` by the shorter and faster `~x`, which does not require a method name lookup).  I did not try any timings myself, but can imagine that this simplification makes no practical difference (the running time is probably dominated by the extended GCD computation).
> Also, did you check very carefully that removing those additional multiplications that used to be done in `_invert_c()` do not cause any trouble anywhere?

Here is a proof that the simplified code is correct.  Suppose our number field *K*, is **Q**[*X*]/(*f*) where we may assume without loss of generality that *f* is in **Z**[*X*].  We want to invert *x* = (*g* mod *f*)/*d* in *K*, where *g* is in **Z**[*X*] and is coprime to *f*, and where *d* is in **Z** and non-zero.  We call `XGCD(e, h, t, g, f)`; then *e* is the resultant of *g* and *f* (a non-zero integer) and *h*, *t* are in **Z**[*X*] satisfying *e* = *hg + tf*.  Modulo *f*, this becomes (*h* mod *f*)(*g* mod *f*) = *e* in *K*, and hence 1/*x* = *d*/(*g* mod *f*) = ((*h* mod *f*)*d*)/*e*.  The right-hand is precisely what is computed by the simplified version of the code.  I assume that the previous version resulted in an equivalent, but less often reduced, fraction.

Yes, this could very well be; it is surprising how often one runs into code that is much more complicated than necessary...

It now seems to makes more sense to me to be the reviewer instead of an author.  I am now running doctests.  Maybe it is still good if someone else takes a look at this; these number field operations are after all essential and heavily used...

<a id='comment:49'></a>`@`pbruin: I completely agree with the proof and this is essentially what I tried to write in comment:30.
I was only worried I might overlook a detail in the implementation and that my assumptions (for instance the representation of **x** to begin with) are not entirely correct in every case.

And yes, it would be good if someone else could have a look as well although the code is pretty solid now, I think.
But the impact of changing number field code is indeed so great that it can't hurt to double-check.

OK, good to see that we agree on this.  I don't think there are any hidden assumptions that could be violated...

I agree.  By the way, doctests still pass.

<a id='comment:52'></a>I have gone through the proposed patch and everything seems to work as stated. 
* I ran `sage -t --all` and the few doctests which failed seems to not be related to the proposed patch (and in particular  all tests in sage -t src/sage/rings/number_field/ passes).

* The example given above for level 23 crash on Sage 7.2 without the patch and works fine with the patch.
* The new code  introduced in src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx is well-formatted and does what is intended.
* The code which was removed from src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx (i.e. the '_invert_c_' routine) does indeed seem to have been unnecessarily complicated.
* The new code introduce a test which crashes in Sage 7.2 without the patch but passes with the patch.
