In order to more quickly check if two simplicial complexes are not isomorphic, we should check that their (ordered) facet dimension sequences agree.

We also check that edge labels are respected for the isomorphism, so isomorphisms of the fake degree vertex is not part of the isomorphism.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Exactly what is this doctest supposed to test?

```
        We check that :trac:`20751` is fixed::

            sage: C1 = SimplicialComplex([[1,2,3], [1,2,4], [1,3,4]])
            sage: C2 = SimplicialComplex([['j','k','l'], ['j','l','m'], ['j','k','m']])
            sage: C1.is_isomorphic(C2, certificate=True)
            (True, {1: 'j', 2: 'k', 3: 'l', 4: 'm'})
```

I am asking because the output is not unique (one can exchange vertices 2, 3 and 4).
