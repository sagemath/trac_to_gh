```
In order to more quickly check if two simplicial complexes are not isomorphic, we should check that their (ordered) facet dimension sequences agree.

We also check that edge labels are respected for the isomorphism, so isomorphisms of the fake degree vertex is not part of the isomorphism.

Depends on #20720

Exactly what is this doctest supposed to test?

```
        We check that :trac:`20751` is fixed::

            sage: C1 = SimplicialComplex([[1,2,3], [1,2,4], [1,3,4]])
            sage: C2 = SimplicialComplex([['j','k','l'], ['j','l','m'], ['j','k','m']])
            sage: C1.is_isomorphic(C2, certificate=True)
            (True, {1: 'j', 2: 'k', 3: 'l', 4: 'm'})
```

I am asking because the output is not unique (one can exchange vertices 2, 3 and 4).

Thanks for the info. So it shouldn't be a problem to replace that test with a different one.
