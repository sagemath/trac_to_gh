<a id='comment:4'></a>Hello,

I made some changes:

- I removed the code, the encoder, the decoder and the channel from the dictionary `experimental_data`, as this never changes through the tests for a given benchmark.
- I strengthened how empty benchmarks are managed in addition. Consider `B1` and `B2` two benchmarks. If:
    - `B1` and `B2` are empty, an exception is returned,
    - `B1` or `B2` are empty, the empty benchmark is ignored.

This is still under new state as there's some remaining bugs (e.g. "experimental" warning is called everytime a Benchmark is constructed, even inside the same session).

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hello,

Here's a change log for this ticket:

- I removed `encoder` from this class. One cannot pass an encoder to a benchmark anymore, and all related methods have been deleted. Instead, I replaced the old call `Benchmark(E, D, Chan)` by `Benchmark(C, D, Chan)`. 

- Adding two empty benchmarks now returns an empty benchmark and no longer an exception.

- I added better messages in case one tries to manipulate an empty benchmark: for instance. calling `Benchmark.run()` now returns a proper message which explains that nothing will be done.

- I refined the notion of "success rate". It now considers decoding errors (when the decoder fails at returning anything) and decoding failures (when the decoder returns a codeword which is not the expected one). I also enhanced `decoding_success_rate`, which now allows the user to select between success rate wrt. failures or errors.

- I globally improved the documentation.

One problem remains: the experimental warning triggered by the decorator ``@`experimental` activates every time one creates a benchmark, which is annoying and also breaks all my doctests.
This is quite weird as the [documentation for this decorator](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/superseded.html#sage.misc.superseded.experimental) says it will only be triggered once/session.
Still investigating on this...

David

That is, `P(failure) >= P(error) and P(failure) - P(error) = P(not returning anything)`.

Perhaps this implementation should reflect this (non-universally adopted) convention.

Oops, I wanted to do that, but confused the definition of decoding error and decoding failure. Fixed now.
BTW, the exception thrown when something wrong occurs during decoding is called `DecodingError`... Which is actually a bit confusing. But it follows the template to name exceptions.

Hmm, how would you even deprecate this? Issue a deprecation warning only when the error is thrown?

But, thinking more about it, this name is also no good: the exception is used by a decoding algorithm when it realises that something went wrong, e.g. the polynomial division in Berlekamp-Welch doesn't go well. But this is exactly a case of `DecodingFailure\DecodingError` where `\` indicates set difference; that is, it is a decoding failure that is surely not a decoding error (since no codeword is returned).

Justesen and Høholdt do not give a name to this event, but we need such a name for the decoding exception.

`DecodingException`? `DecodeAbortError`? `DecodingAborted`?
