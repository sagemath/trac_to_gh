When running the patchbot inside the sagemath/sagemath-develop docker container of
https://github.com/sagemath/docker-images, we get the following error:

```

```

To reproduce (not double checked; we get that error when building the sagemath-patchot docker image; but that should be equivalent):

- install docker
- `docker run -ti sagemath-develop bash`
- install and run the patchbot as usual

No idea at this point on why this fails in this context, but not otherwise.

@nthiery, do these tests pass in the same docker but not using the bot ?

Wild guess, it could be due to multithreading ?

```
Doctesting entire Sage library.
Sorting sources by runtime so that slower doctests are run first....
Doctesting 3390 files using 3 threads.

Hi!

Those are indeed the only tests failing.

The sagedev tests are not failing when run inside the bot but outside of the container.

The cmdline test is also failing outside of the bot, but that's now analyzed and should be an easy fix
(https://github.com/sagemath/docker-images/issues/11).

No idea about the potential influence of multithreading.

For the sake of completeness, I just started a new sagemath/sagemath-develop docker image, installed the patchbot, and ran the sagedev tests with:

```
    sage -tp 3 src/sage/dev/
```

They passed smoothly. The failing tests only appear when running:

```
    sage -patchbot --count=0
```

Cheers,
                              Nicolas

I did 

```
./sage -patchbot --skip-base --ticket=14974
```

but it still tested ticket 0, see http://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/0/

I'm having an orthogonal issue when I try to test this issue.

When I run `sage -patchbot --count=0` in the docker container to runs the docbuild plugin for patchbot.  It starts building the docs and seems to get a long ways through it and when it gets to:

```
[tensor   ] building [html]: targets for 4 source files that are out of date
[tensor   ] preparing documents... done
[tensor   ] writing output... [ 25%] index
[history_a] building [html]: targets for 1 source files that are out of date

[history_a] copying extra files... done
[history_a] dumping search index... done
[history_a] dumping object inventory... done
[history_a] build succeeded.
Build finished.  The built documents can be found in /opt/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/histor
[tensor   ] writing output... [100%] sage/tensor/differential_forms

[tensor   ] dumping object inventory... done
[tensor   ] build succeeded.
Build finished.  The built documents can be found in /opt/sage/local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/tensor
```

it seems to just hang, with no output, for a very long time.  Is it waiting on something else that's running in parallel?  I can't seem to get past this. (I could disable the docbuild plugin, but it's still a problem)
