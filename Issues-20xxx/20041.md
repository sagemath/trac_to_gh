I have done a fairly major make-over of this code. I have tried to make to more consistent with the rest of the tableaux code by adding options, quite a few new methods as well as some more parent classes:

```sage
ShiftedTableaux_all
ShiftedTableaux_size
ShiftedTableaux_shape
```
I have also created a `StrictPartitions` class, with friends, in `partition.py` because the shape of shifted tableaux is always a strict partition. Currently the `StrictPartitions` class is not in the global namespace, but of course it could be.

Previously, the following worked:

```sage
sage: ShiftedTableau([[1,4,5]])
[[1, 4, 5]]
```
As `Shiftedtabelaux` returns what I would call "standard" shifted tableaux I thought that this was incorrect, so it now raises an error:

```sage
sage: ShiftedTableau([[1,4,5]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: [[1, 4, 5]] is not an element of Shifted tableaux of shape [3].
```
Let me know if this is not what was intended.

Finally, I hope this is OK but I have taken some liberties with the code such as moving some of the helper functions into the `ShiftedTableaux_size` class. Perhaps more significantly, I have renamed the main file `tableau_shifted.py` as I think this is better organisationally (I know, `k_tableau.py` does not follow this pattern). 

Currently there is one failing doc text that I have not had time to sort out. I have also added more documentation, although I haven't checked it because to do this I'd need to do a `make doc-clean` and it's late...

My main motivation for doing this is that I want to implement "shaded shifted tableaux", but I haven't started on this yet.

Sorry, I forgot about this as well. There seems to be a recursion problem now in generating shifted tableaux - which I don't think happened earlier? I will see if I can fix this but I am swamped with teaching at the moment so it won't happen straight away.

So there were a number of things that had changed in the backends that needed to be fixed here.

The first is what caused the infinite loop, which caused by `cardinality` -> `__iter__` -> `__len__` -> `cardinality`. I broke this by having a direct counting in `cardinality` using the faster iterator (which doesn't create an instance of the element class, avoiding extra overhead).

There was also some issues with how the facade parents were handled and there elements are constructed. Now `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets` better handles facade parents, which exposed the issue. This wasn't too hard to clean up.

My other changes were some other small cleanup on the docstrings.

I don't have an idea about the `sage: ShiftedTableau([This is the Trac macro *1,4,5* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,4,5-macro))` change from[comment:9](#comment%3A9). Anne, Zach, Darij, any objections/comments?

Otherwise, I think this is ready for review, so I am setting it as such.

It would be nice to have `ascii_art` and `unicode_art` work, see `Tableau._ascii_art_`.

Observation: `StrictPartitions` is the same as `Partitions(n, max_slope=-1)`, except that `StrictPartitions` is much faster.

Question: `ShiftedTableau` inherits from `ClonableArray`, wheras `Tableau` inherits from `ClonableList`.  Is there a reason to this?

I am not currently able to compile sage due to a skylake issue, but the comments above suggest that the branch does not apply to the current sage beta. This is almost certainly due to some more recent changes to `partition.py`, so it shouldn't be hard to fix but will need to be done...

Secondly, there is the question/comment above about implementing a separate classes for`ShiftedStandardTableau` and `ShiftedStandardTableau`. Currently, the shifted tableaux are really shifted *stanbdard* tableaux, so this probably should be done. zhamaker suggested doing this but no one has done it yet.

This is not something that I feed strongly about but, yes, it would be good to have. I made sure that the `latex` method works.

I can't remember how `Partitions` generates this but as it is generic code it is not surprising that the code here, which from memory uses code from posets, is faster. It is possible that the code in `Partitions` could be made faster by using the same approach, but that should be done in a separate ticket, I think.

Probably `ClonableList` should be used. I used `ClonableArray` because, for me, the entries of such tableaux are always integers but it is probably more sensible to allow the entries to be arbitrary objects, in which case `ClonableList` is better.
