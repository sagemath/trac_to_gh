This is an annoying warning that GCC always outputs on Cygwin either 32-bit or 64-bit.  It's harmless really but it is output for every single compiled source file--C or fortran--and there is no `-Wno-` flag to disable it.

There is a patch now in GCC to remove this outright: https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2015-08/msg00836.html  But I don't know when it will be available.  The default GCC currently in Cygwin is 5.3, and it does not have this patch.

It's not worth putting in a lot of effort over this, but I'm squashing it wherever I see it by just removing the `-fPIC` flag (if possible) on Cygwin.  I will maintain a branch for these changes wherever I come across them.

Went ahead and fixed this for most, if not all packages, while waiting for a build to finish.

Again, the only thing this is fixing as an annoying warning (that will appear for almost every file compiled) on Cygwin where the `-fPIC` flag is enabled.  If future spkgs add this flag it's not a big deal.

Here is a cleaner suggestion: in `sage-env`, define a variable (just a local variable, no need to `export` it) called `fPIC` set to either `"-fPIC"` or `""`. Then you can replace `-fPIC` by `$fPIC` in `spkg-install` files without conditionals.
