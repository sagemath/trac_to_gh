The scripts sage-rebase(all).{sh,bat} are used when developing/building Sage on Windows.

In the long term I'd like to find a way to reduce the need for them, but even then they're still good to have.  It is useful to run these every now and then to ensure that all DLLs in the Sage distribution are configured to load into non-overlapping address ranges by default.  First and foremost this is a performance issue, but also not rebasing can cause failures with Cygwin's fork.

To summarize what this ticket changes:

* In the wrapper batch scripts, it's no longer necessary to manually adjust `CYGWIN_ROOT` and `SAGE_ROOT`.  In fact, `SAGE_ROOT` is not needed by these scripts so much as `SAGE_LOCAL`, the path to which is automatically detected from the location of the script.  `CYGWIN_ROOT` is determined from the registry.  This *may* be incorrect if there are multiple Cygwin installations on the system, but this is unlikely in most cases.  Furthermore, with the changes I'm making for #15423 there will be less need to use the batch script in the first place (I have rarely had to use them in a long time now).
* In the sage-rebase.sh and sage-rebaseall.sh scripts:
  * Now the implementation is all just in `sage-rebase.sh`, which has grown an `--all` flag for performing rebaseall.  So `sage-rebaseall.sh` is just a wrapper around `sage-rebase.sh --all`.  This reduces a lot of code duplication.
  * The script excludes anything under `/var/tmp` so that build artifacts don't take up space in the address space layout.
  * The script *does* now include `.fas` modules for ECL, which were previously not included in the rebase.
  * It is possible to pass the path to `$SAGE_LOCAL` to the scripts as an argument, so it's not necessary for `$SAGE_LOCAL` to be set before running them (useful sometimes during development).
  * It is possible to pass arbitrary additional flags to the underlying `rebase`/`rebaseall` commands.

This is just a small collection of enhancements to these scripts.  Most importantly, this adds support for rebase `.fas` binaries that are part of ECL.  Not doing this potentially caused problems for Maxima (so I'm marking this as a defect).

 In the long term I'd like to find a way to reduce the need for them, but even then they're still good to have.  It is useful to run these every now and then to ensure that all DLLs in the Sage distribution are configured to load into non-overlapping address ranges by default.  First and foremost this is a performance issue, but also not rebasing can cause failures with Cygwin's fork.
 
+To summarize what this ticket changes:
+
+* In the wrapper batch scripts, it's no longer necessary to manually adjust `CYGWIN_ROOT` and `SAGE_ROOT`.  In fact, `SAGE_ROOT` is not needed by these scripts so much as `SAGE_LOCAL`, the path to which is automatically detected from the location of the script.  `CYGWIN_ROOT` is determined from the registry.  This *may* be incorrect if there are multiple Cygwin installations on the system, but this is unlikely in most cases.  Furthermore, with the changes I'm making for #15423 there will be less need to use the batch script in the first place (I have rarely had to use them in a long time now).
+* In the sage-rebase.sh and sage-rebaseall.sh scripts:
+  * Now the implementation is all just in `sage-rebase.sh`, which has grown an `--all` flag for performing rebaseall.  So `sage-rebaseall.sh` is just a wrapper around `sage-rebase.sh --all`.  This reduces a lot of code duplication.
+  * The script excludes anything under `/var/tmp` so that build artifacts don't take up space in the address space layout.
+  * The script *does* now include `.fas` modules for ECL, which were previously not included in the rebase.
+  * It is possible to pass the path to `$SAGE_LOCAL` to the scripts as an argument, so it's not necessary for `$SAGE_LOCAL` to be set before running them (useful sometimes during development).
+  * It is possible to pass arbitrary additional flags to the underlying `rebase`/`rebaseall` commands.
+
 This is just a small collection of enhancements to these scripts.  Most importantly, this adds support for rebase `.fas` binaries that are part of ECL.  Not doing this potentially caused problems for Maxima (so I'm marking this as a defect).
