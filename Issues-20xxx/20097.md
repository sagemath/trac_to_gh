```
sage: n = (1/RIF(0,1)).diameter()
sage: n
NaN
sage: n < 1
True
```
but `n < 1` should return `False`.

Does it make sense to compare Not a Number to number?

Does anything need to be changed?  Should we add doctests?

There is ambiguity because they are of different type.

```
sage: type(oo)
<class 'sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity'>
sage: type(1./0)
<class 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
```

I feel this is useful to be documented with the relevant cases.
