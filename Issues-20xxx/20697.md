Currently there exist classes for generic projective/affine space and plane curves, but the plane curve classes do not inherit from the respective space curve classes. Adding this inheritance will facilitate the implementation of future generic curve functionality.

I do not see anything wrong with the new inheritance structure, but I don't really understand the naming conventions of the classes.  Here is what I see

AffineSpaceCurve, ProjectiveSpaceCurve = the generic curves classes

AffineCurve_generic, ProjectiveCurve_generic - the curves that must lie in the plane (A2 or P2).

That seems somewhat odd to me. If I've understood this correctly doesn't some naming convention like

AffineCurve_generic, ProjectiveCurve_generic -> XXXXCurve_plane

AffineSpaceCurve, ProjectiveSpaceCurve -? XXXXCurve_generic

make more sense. Then the special class inherits from the 'generic' class instead of the other way around.

Also, it seems like some description should be added to the documentation for all of these classes.

Replying to [bhutz](#comment%3A4):

I think that would be a good renaming. I didn't try to implement a name change earlier because changing the ProjectiveCurve_generic class name would require changing it when referenced in the elliptic curve, conic, and hyperelliptic curve classes. I actually don't think that would be so bad; I'll try changing the names and see how much needs to be done.

Perhaps at some point it would be good to change the folder name as well, since the eventually the generic curve classes will have more functionality for general curves.
