Currently there exist classes for generic projective/affine space and plane curves, but the plane curve classes do not inherit from the respective space curve classes. Adding this inheritance will facilitate the implementation of future generic curve functionality.

I do not see anything wrong with the new inheritance structure, but I don't really understand the naming conventions of the classes.  Here is what I see

AffineSpaceCurve, ProjectiveSpaceCurve = the generic curves classes

AffineCurve_generic, ProjectiveCurve_generic - the curves that must lie in the plane (A2 or P2).

That seems somewhat odd to me. If I've understood this correctly doesn't some naming convention like

AffineCurve_generic, ProjectiveCurve_generic -> XXXXCurve_plane

AffineSpaceCurve, ProjectiveSpaceCurve -? XXXXCurve_generic

make more sense. Then the special class inherits from the 'generic' class instead of the other way around.

Also, it seems like some description should be added to the documentation for all of these classes.

Replying to [@bhutz](#comment%3A4):

I think that would be a good renaming. I didn't try to implement a name change earlier because changing the ProjectiveCurve_generic class name would require changing it when referenced in the elliptic curve, conic, and hyperelliptic curve classes. I actually don't think that would be so bad; I'll try changing the names and see how much needs to be done.

Perhaps at some point it would be good to change the folder name as well, since the eventually the generic curve classes will have more functionality for general curves.

functionality seems fine, but I'd like to see a description of the classes and some examples in each of the files

- affine_curve
- projective_curve
- curve

For example look at the beginning of the projective_space.py file.

minor: notice that it is possible to define curves over general rings since the init just calls the suscheme init. So you should remove the "over fields" part of the class title for projective and affine curves.


from src/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx
pickle failure: It looks like you are going to need to do a register_unpickle_override for projective curves.

```
    ImportError: cannot import ProjectiveCurve_generic from sage.schemes.plane_curves.projective_curve, call register_unpickle_override('sage.schemes.plane_curves.projective_curve', 'ProjectiveCurve_generic', ...) to fix this
    Failed:
    _class__sage_schemes_jacobians_abstract_jacobian_Jacobian_generic__.sobj
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ** This error is probably due to an old pickle failing to unpickle.
    ** See sage.structure.sage_object.register_unpickle_override for
    ** how to override the default unpickling methods for (old) pickles.
    ** NOTE: pickles should never be removed from the pickle_jar! 
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Successfully unpickled 585 objects.
    Failed to unpickle 1 objects.
