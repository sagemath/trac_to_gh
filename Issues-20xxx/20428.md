memory limits before executing the program again.
```

Currently Maxima is called with ultraspherical (Gegenbauer) polynomials but already a naive Python implementation is faster:

```
sage: def u(n,a):
    return sum((-1)^k*prod(i for i in srange(a, n-k+a))/factorial(n-2*k)/factorial(k)*(2*x)^(n-2*k) for k in range(floor(n/2)+1))
....:
sage: %time _=u(10000,7/5)
CPU times: user 1min 43s, sys: 128 ms, total: 1min 43s
Wall time: 1min 43s
```
and the Maxima version would be not even expanded. A direct Pynac implementation needs 25 seconds.

Dependencies: **pynac-0.6.5**

Component: **symbolics**
