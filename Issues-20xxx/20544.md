<a id='comment:3'></a>This is OK, and you can set this to *positive_review* without any changes.

Usually you follow PEPs very strictly, so maybe you want to add spaces after commas in

```
[len(x),len(y),len(x_i),len(y_i)]
```

(in two instances). In `src/sage/matroids/lean_matrix.pyx` there is a commented out line

```
# print "row-scale: ", x, ", ", s
```

I suppose it can be just deleted. Grepping will be easier if "print " does not match to a code line.
