```
As reported in [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/33735/finding-number-of-strongly-connected-components/), the document says:

```
   This routine returns a pair "[nscc, scc]", where "nscc" is the
   number of SCCs and "scc" is a dictionary associating to each vertex
   "v" an integer between "0" and "nscc-1", corresponding to the SCC
   containing "v". SCCs are numbered in reverse topological order,
   that is, if "(v,w)" is an edge in the graph, "scc[v] <= scc[w]".
```

while the method returns a list of lists of vertices, see:

```
sage: G = digraphs.DeBruijn(2,2)
sage: G.strongly_connected_components()
[['00', '01', '10', '11']]
sage: G.strongly_connected_components?
```

The documentation itself shows examples of this, so the description should be updated, or the method (and examples) updated.
