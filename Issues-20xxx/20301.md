#18815 introduced `Polyhedron.to_linear_program` -- but there's very little one can do with it.
To 
- set an objective other than the default 0; 
- access an optimal solution vector after solving, 
one needs the MIP variable (`x` in the code of `to_linear_program`). Currently the only way to do anything is by using the MIP backend.

I would propose to return `x` as a second return value, but this of course changes the interface.
