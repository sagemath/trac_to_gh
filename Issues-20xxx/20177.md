Some checks on the output on `decode_to_code` for Gao, Berlekamp-Welch and Key-Equation Syndrome decoders are actually useless.

I also noticed that the nature of the input code of GRS decoders is never checked: one can perform the following:

```
C = codes.RandomLinearCode(10, 4, GF(7))
D = codes.decoders.GRSGaoDecoder(C)
```

and actually construct the decoder... Whose decoding methods will utterly fail with a terrible error message!
