The aim of this ticket is to use the Python 3 `print()` function everywhere in Sage: doctests, command-line, notebook.

**STATUS** (2016-05) after discussions on sage-devel, this ticket is not going to be merged until a complete switch to python3 is effected.

It will be kept open to let the patchbots monitor the possible failing doctests
that would be triggered by enforcing python3 print syntax.

We should only do this if we also change the Sage command line to use Python 3 `print()` syntax. Doctests and the command line should be consistent.

This still seems like a good idea to me?  At some point Sage is going to have to switch to Python 3 (Python 2 support ends 2020).  Good to start now...

Besides, we are not going to force python2 users to use python3-sage. So this ticket is useful only for its branch, that allows from time to time to see that somebody has once again re-introduced a python2 print somewhere.

Volker, what do you mean exactly, please ? Do we just need to add one single line 

```
from __future__ import print_function
```
in the code of the file `src/sage/doctest/sources.py`
or is there something more subtle to do ? ( I have no idea of what is a "virtual doctest")
