Goal: replace

```
def f(blah, **kwds):
```
with

```
def f(blah, kwd1=x, kwd2=y, ...):
```
There are many uses of the former in `sage/homology`, and they make it confusing as to which keywords are passed to subroutines, and they also make it hard to catch typos (`X.homology(algorith='auto')`, for example).
