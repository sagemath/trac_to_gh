This ticket fixes a lot of inconsistencies with factorization (`structure/factorization.py`). For example the unit was not forced to belong to the universe of the factorization

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: parent((x+1).factor().unit())
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: parent(R.one().factor().unit())
Integer Ring
```

Also fixes #20607

**CC:**  @slel

I've fixed this to return the unit as an element of the base ring, as it is done for the rationals or by the factorization with Pari.

Factorization is aimed to be a generic class, not only polynomials. I am a little bit worried about your one line change (and patchbot as well). For example the free group has no base ring and matrix groups (`GL` or `SL`) have no multiplication defined with element of the base ring.

Note that some of the patchbot issue is just because `_repr_` of `Factorization` is bad. I will add a commit for that.

With the changes to the representation string and by fixing a silly error I made earlier (pushed one commit), there's just one failure remaining. It seems that the action from a finite field onto the general linear group is not implemented; I think that should be possible. E.g.:

```
sage: G = GL(3,5); F = G.base_ring()
sage: F(2) * G.one()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Finite Field of size 5' and 'General Linear Group of degree 3 over Finite Field of size 5'
```

Should this be handled on this ticket as well or should we open a separate ticket? (Personally, I'm for a separate ticket...)

I'd propose to implement `_lmul_` and `_rmul_`; I agree that embedding via coercion is not practicable.

Regarding the `base_ring` and the fact that there might not be one: yes, that has to be taken care of. I haven't thought of that because I was implementing the original version with #20086 in mind.

My two cents: factoring makes sense in rings (more precisely, in UFD's), so the factors and the unit should be in the corresponding ring. 

So, I think that the correct behaviour should be the opposite of what you propose. That is, we should have:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: parent((x+1).factor().unit())
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: parent(R.one().factor().unit())
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```

There might be rings (e.g. Laurent polynomials) with units that are not in the rings base ring. So the only possible consistent behaviour is to have the units in the ring (and not in its base ring).

Some questions after a first quick look.

Why in this part of the code, 

```
        elif universe is not None:
            x = [(universe(i),j) for i,j in x]
            if unit is None:
                try:
                    unit = universe(1)
                except (ValueError,TypeError):
                    pass
```

we don't include this first attempt?:

```
                 try:
                    unit = universe.one()
```
.


In the neg method we only allow negation of factorizations with unit (from what I have seen, it could happen in parents with no one method, and that doesn't allow to convert 1, not sure if they exist).

Otherwise it looks ok, but I still have to test it a bit more deeply.

Right. It can be simplified a bit.

Right, there is a problem here. What should we do for `-fac` when there is no unit? Raise an error?
