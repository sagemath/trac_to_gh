When there is an embedding `K -> L` of number fields, it comes with a coercion and Sage knows how to map elements of `K` as elements of `L`. But such embedding also comes with a partial map `L --> K`. In the case of cyclotomic field this partial map is only partially implemented...

```
sage: K12 = CyclotomicField(12)
sage: K6 = CyclotomicField(6)
sage: K12(K6(0))   # coercion K6 -> K12 is fine
0
sage: K6(K12(0))   # partial conversion K12 -> K6 is not
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <class 'sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity'> to an integer
```
More precisely, the partial conversion `L --> K` only works for roots of unity

```
sage: K6(K12.gen()**2)
zeta6
sage: K6(K12.gen()**4)
zeta6 - 1
```
This behavior does not coincide with the fact that Sage knows how to convert rationals between number fields

```
sage: R.<cbrt2> = NumberField(x^3 - 2)
sage: K6(R(1/3))
1/3
sage: R(K6(1/3))
1/3
```

More generally, given two number fields there always are partial maps between them (well defined on the intersection). It would be nice if this would work as expected.

sage: K6(K12.gen()**2)

When there is an embedding `K1 -> K2` the conversions from `K2` to `K1` is unambiguous.

#20513 does fix the first of these: 

```
sage: K12(K6(0))
0
```
but

```
sage: K6(K12(0))

rather amaingly gives

```

I suggest that #20513 is amended to deal with these cases, with extra doctests, rather than starting a new branch for it.

As Travis said `K6 -> K12` is a **coercion** and is working just fine with or without #20513. The latter ticket deals with towers of coercions such as `K6 -> K12 -> K36 -> K64`. 

The (partial) conversion `K12 -> K6` which is the object of this ticket is another story.

-In some cases the element 0 of one cyclotomic field cannot be converted properly to 0
-in another cyclotomic field. For instance in Sage 7.1 and Sage 7.2.rc1:
+When there is an embedding `K -> L` of number fields, it comes with a coercion and Sage knows how to map elements of `K` as elements of `L`. But such embedding also comes with a partial map `L --> K`. In the case of cyclotomic field this partial map is only partially implemented...
 
 ```
 sage: K12 = CyclotomicField(12)
@@ -11,3 +10,22 @@
 ...
 TypeError: unable to coerce <class 'sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity'> to an integer
 ```
+More precisely, the partial conversion `L --> K` only works for roots of unity
+
+```
+sage: K6(K12.gen()**2)
+zeta6
+sage: K6(K12.gen()**4)
+zeta6 - 1
+```
+This behavior does not coincide with the fact that Sage knows how to convert rationals between number fields
+
+```
+sage: R.<cbrt2> = NumberField(x^3 - 2)
+sage: K6(R(1/3))
+1/3
+sage: R(K6(1/3))
+1/3
+```
+
+More generally, given two number fields there always are partial maps between them (well defined on the intersection). It would be nice if this would work as expected.

Some of the BOOMs must have been fixed by #29511. The example at the top of the ticket now works. However, this one persists:

```
sage: K13 = CyclotomicField(13)
sage: K5 = CyclotomicField(5)
sage: K5(K13(0))
# BOOM
```
Another example with roots of unity (which might have been broken by #29511, now that I think of it):

```
sage: K3 = CyclotomicField(3)
sage: K9 = CyclotomicField(9)                                                   
sage: K12 = CyclotomicField(12)     
sage: K12(K3(K9.gen()^3))                                                       
zeta12^2 - 1                           
sage: K12(K9.gen()^3) # should be the same?  
# BOOM
```
But it might be worth creating a new ticket (or more than one) that more precisely identifies the remaining issue(s), and then closing this one as a duplicate.
