The problem is that the flag "-march=native" is now given to the compiler, causing GCC to generate assembly code that is not accepted by the ancient version of "as" that ships with 10.8 and 10.9.  See 

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/FloU3fAgQLM

for a discussion and some potential solutions.  Currently, it seems unknown if this NTL builds on 10.10 but it is known to do so on 10.11.

That would actually be the best solution in my opinion and would mean no changes are needed in other packages. ntl and SnapPy are probably just the tip of the iceberg (linbox and co will want to do that kind of stuff too once we finish their upgrade ticket).

An even easier way would be to install a wrapper script `as` in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/` on MacOS X to call the "right" one, no idea whether its location differs on different systems.  (Or does clang's assembler have a unique alias?)

Sure?  It's usually *not* in `$PATH`, but in some subfolder of clang/LLVM, on Linux for example in /usr/local/clang-X.Y/bin/`.

> but based on the script at https://gist.github.com/xianyi/2957847, it looks like `clang -c -x assembler` is how you invoke it. 


Hmmm, the `-x assembler` should only be necessary if the input comes from a pipe, or the filename doesn't end with `.s`, `.S`, `.asm` or the like.

What version of OS X is this?  On 10.8 and 10.9, the `as` command doesn't even accept the `--help` flag and `as -v` gives (on 10.9)

```
Apple Inc version cctools-862, GNU assembler version 1.38
```
I think Apple switched to a clang-based `as` in either 10.10 or 10.11, which is why this version of NTL has been confirmed to work on 10.11 but fails on 10.8 and 10.9.

Putting one of the following into `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/as` (and of course `chmod +x` it) should work.

```sh

exec /usr/bin/as -q "$@"

\\

```sh

I'm not sure whether the first at all works if `/usr/bin/as` is already LLVM's `as` (e.g. on 10.11; François?), and one could hardcode the path to `as` in the second (perhaps unless it is shipped with a binary distribution of Sage).

Does `clang -print-prog-name=as` give a full pathname on your system?  (If no specific assembler or other program was configured during the build, the "input" just gets echoed verbatim, no matter whether such a program exists at all, and even the return value is zero.)

Does `llvm-as` exist on your system (not necessarily along `$PATH`)?

No, or at least not as far as I can tell.   In particular, there no `llvm-as` (or any renamed version of such) in `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/` which where it should be if it exists. 

On 10.10 and newer, the version of `as` at `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/` becomes clang's assembler.

I realized my replacement script doesn't work either --- I guess we have do something with the `-x assembler` flag

On 10.9 `/usr/bin/as` is a tiny 14K executable, so I guess it must function basically as a shell script.

This has been possible for a while.  On clean 10.9 machine if you type "clang" in Terminal.app, then a dialog pops up to ask if you want to install the command line tools, though there is also a button to install the whole of Xcode. 

>  Does Sage build without having Xcode installed?


I'm about to find out ;-).  It should, I think.  At the very least, it can build everything up to NTL.

Yep, we could create such a script in Sage's `configure` when necessary (i.e., on MacOS X, if the default `as` is still GAS).

I still don't know whether `as -q ...` works on more recent versions (where it shouldn't be necessary).  While we could check that in `configure` for source builds, that doesn't help with binary dists.  If it doesn't break anything on 10.10 and later, we could simply include the script in (all) binary distributions of Sage for MacOS X.

Not sure whether we have to require Apple's "command line tools" **and** Xcode then (at least for builds from source and "developing" with bdists).

\\

All of this is IMHO still orthogonal to fixing NTL's `-march=native` check (which apparently simply tests whether the compiler *accepts the option*, but nothing beyond that -- I haven't looked into the code though).

I checked that on 10.10 and 10.11 that `as` accepts `-q` without complaining.  I haven't yet tried building Sage this way, though.

Definitely just the command-line tools --- I didn't have Xcode installed on the 10.9 system referred to above.

I think it's reasonable on NTL's part to assume that if the compiler accepts the option then it generates working code --- I would argue that the issue here on OS X is a mismatch or if you prefer a misconfiguration between the compiler and the assembler.  

I haven't tested yet, but I think `as -q` might also resolve #20563, so two birds with one stone and all that.

:-)  It *does* generate "working" code in the sense that the assembly output is valid (even in the case of #20563 btw.).

But the test should check whether the whole toolchain works, and -- unless cross-compiling, where `-march=native` wouldn't make sense anyway -- whether such a program can be run on the machine.

Besides hardware bugs, there've also frequently been issues with VMs.  (And note that for example AVX requires *operating system* support, not just an AVX-capable CPU.)

The (newer) LLVM assembler certainly complies with Intel's AVX specification... ;-)

There was one failure in the long doctests, but probably presumably not related to the change at hand:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 24.0 src/sage/parallel/map_reduce.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/parallel/map_reduce.py", line 1082, in sage.parallel.map_reduce.RESetMapReduce.start_workers
Failed example:
    all(w.is_alive() for w in S._workers)
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
```

So assuming we want to add this `as` script, how would we go about it?  I'm completely ignorant about Sage's bootstrap/config process...

From the ticket's title, yes, but the comments here mainly deal with `clang` and MacOS X specifics, so I'd prefer to leave it open for a solution to the latter on *this* ticket (rather than #20563).

<a id='comment:46'></a>Hmmm, still haven't pushed a branch to #21064 (still playing a little with improvements)...

I wonder what `as -q -v </dev/null` gives on older versions of MacOS X where the default `as` is still Apple's GAS.

Does it print its own version, or does it invoke LLVM's `as`, and if so, what does the latter give?

(At least older versions of LLVM's assembler *on Linux*, probably not on MacOS X, don't know/accept `-v`, but `-version` as well as `--version`.)

And does `as -v -q </dev/null` (options swapped) behave the same?

It's LLVM's `as` that's invoked (seen here on 10.9):

```
% as -v -q < /dev/null

```

> And does `as -v -q </dev/null` (options swapped) behave the same?


Yes, it does.  The `-version` flag is not accepted in either order, but `--version` and produces:

```

<a id='comment:49'></a>FYI (in case you don't already know it):

[This nice list](https://gist.github.com/yamaya/2924292#file-xcode-clang-vers) maps Xcode versions to (Apple) clang versions at least.

We could use it to get the Xcode version from `clang --version`, and in conjunction with [data from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#Version_comparison_table), could check whether it is (one of) the most recent version(s) available for MacOS X 10.*N* (aka Darwin *N+4* IIRC).

(I haven't found any information on the assembler versions / when Apple's GAS vanished, though.)

\\

[According to that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#Toolchain_versions), Travis' friend (with `as` being GNU's) was using something between Xcode 6.3 and 6.4 (inclusive; cctools-870) on "El Capitan", while for that, 7.x (and 8.0 beta) are available since about ten months (or e.g. four months for 7.3).

I *guess* it was removed when switching from Xcode 6.x to 7.x; *if that's true*, the

* last version *with* GAS would be 6.4 (with cctools-870, Apple LLVM 6.1.0, clang-602.0.53), the

* first version *without* GAS would be 7.0 (with cctools-877.5, Apple LLVM 7.0.0, clang-700.0.72).

Xcode versions 7.0 - 7.2.1 require at least Yosemite, Xcode 7.3 and later El Capitan.

\\

It seems the Xcode and "Apple LLVM" *major* version numbers are (meanwhile) derived from the *minor* version of upstream LLVM (with some fuzz), while the versions in "clang-*x.y.z*" are more weird (*x* = 100 * Xcode major version + *n* with a "random" *n < 10*, *y* being a small minor version number and *z* being the patchlevel).

According to [this post on sage-support](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.support/39668), my guess was a bit wrong.

Apple's GAS was removed / LLVM's assembler made the default in (still presumably) Xcode 7.**3**, not 7.0 or 7.1 (but perhaps already 7.2, which in contrast to 7.3 is available for MacOS X 10.10).
