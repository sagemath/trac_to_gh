Looks fine to me, though I don't really know how "old style packages" are supposed to work.  Are none of them tested?

Doesn't really matter. The only thing this patch does is to keep whatever behaviour was there before.

> Are none of them tested?

Old-style packages are never tested, they are never automatically installed anyway.

What about a package including C-libraries, databases or executables? As far as I understand, `sage -pip` is the alternative for python (possibly cython) libraries.
