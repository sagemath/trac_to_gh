```
In Sage, there is no general mechanism to manage the embedding of elements of a finite extension field in one of its subfields.

We propose here a class which takes care of that.

Considering a big, non-prime field `Fqm` and one of its subfields `Fq`, this class is able to give either a polynomial or a vectorial representation of an element of `Fqm` in `Fq`.

Just to be precise: Sage already supports embedding a small field `GF(p^s)` into a larger one `GF(p^(sm))` (by using `Fsmall.extension(m, map=True)`). It also supports the inverse map (returned by the `section()` method on the embedding map).

The new functionality of this ticket is to support representing any `GF(p^(sm))` element in a basis over `GF(p^s)`. AFAIK, the current implementation supports this with only one particular choice of bases: if `1, beta, ..., beta^(sm-1)` is the basis of `GF(p^(sm))` that Sage currently uses natively, then it is always the case that `1, beta, ..., beta^(m-1)` is a basis of `GF(p^(sm))` over `GF(p^s)`. This is the basis employed by the current ticket.

More precisely, it gives a function that takes an element `e` in `GF(p^(sm))` and returns a vector `(v[0],...,v[m-1]) in GF(p<sup>s)</sup>m`, such that

```
    e = sum_{i=0}^{m-1} phi(v[i]) * beta^i
```

where `phi` is a given embedding from `GF(p^s)` into `GF(p^(sm))`.

Best,
Johan

Hello,

I made some changes to the class:

- I completely changed its nomenclature, which is now based on the one defined for [relative extensions](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/explicit_methods_in_number_theory/nf_orders.html#relative-extensions).
- I changed the behaviour of some methods.
- I added a method to check if an element of the "big field" is in the relative field under the embedding.

This is still open for review.

Best,

David

Because we did not know where to put it, and we didn't get input from anyone. We need the functionality for several things in sage/coding, so we just wanted to add it. And it's on the agenda for Sage Days 75 to merge it much more sensibly with the rest of Sage.

Incidentally, will you be coming for SD75?

Would make more sense with everything about finite field, no? That is to say `sage/rings/finite_rings/`.

Sadly not. I will be in Chile at that time.

I'll be there at sd75.
And I do agree it would nice to use such functionalities in a more general setting.
We could still put it in `coding` first and move it later.

Hello,

> And I do agree it would nice to use such functionalities in a more general setting.
> We could still put it in `coding` first and move it later.

I would indeed prefer to put it in `coding` first, as it locks several very useful tickets for us (#20039, #20100, #20335) while it's not reviewed. Furthermore, we need it for our GSoC project on rank-metric codes.

I can put an experimental warning in it: this way, we will be able to move it later on without being worried by deprecation warnings.

Best,

David
