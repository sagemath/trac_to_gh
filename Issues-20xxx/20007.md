With the change in 7.0 to jupyter as the default notebook, the Virtualbox client starts by default in the home directory. Which looks messy with the sage and sage-7.0 directories.

Can we create a directory called notebooks,

and change the .xinitrc's last line to:

$HOME/sage/sage --notebook=jupyter --ip='*' --notebook-dir=$HOME/notebooks --port=8000 >& $LOG

This starts jupyter with an empty directory.
