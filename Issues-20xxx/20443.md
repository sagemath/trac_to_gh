The method `decoder_type` for Decoder objects is supposed to work on uninstantiated classes to allow the user to check the types of a decoder without being forced to construct it beforehand.

This ticket proposes a change for `decoder_type` so it now works on both uninstantiated classes and instances.

Hi David,

I tested this for the 11 decoders I found using codes.decoders.<TAB> and it worked fine.

I set the ticket status to positive review.
