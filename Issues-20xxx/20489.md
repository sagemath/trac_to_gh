This patch implements the A and B bases for the Iwahori-Hecke algebras. Every Iwahori-Hecke algebra has a unique algebra automorphism `#`, that Iwahori attributed to Goldman, that sends `T_s` to `-T_s+q_1+q_2=-(q_1q_2)<sup>{-1}T_s</sup>{-1}`. The A and B bases are invariant under this involution, up to sign. If `w` belongs to the underlying Coxeter group then
`A_w = T_w + (-1)<sup>{\ell(w)}T_w</sup>\#`. The element `B_w` is uniquely determined by the property that 

```
B_w^\3 = (-1)^{\ell(w)}B_w  
B_w = T_w+\sum_{v<w, \ell(v)\not\equiv\ell(w)\pmod 2} b_{vw}(q)T_v.
```
This ticket implements both of these bases, together with the Goldman involution.


Note: these bases are only defined if 2 is invertible in the ground ring.

This is almost ready for review. The only issue that remains is that these bases are well-defined only when 2 is invertible in the base ring. In principle, this is catered for because the `__init__` methods in both bases contain lines like

```
    if 1/2 not in IHAlgebra.base_ring():
        raise ValueError('The A-basis is defined only when 2 is invertible ')
```
In practice, this does not seem to get caught when the bases are initialised:

```
sage: R.<v> = LaurentPolynomialRing(GF(2))
sage: H = IwahoriHeckeAlgebra('A3', q1=v)
sage: A=H.A(); B=H.B(); T=H.T()
sage: T(A[2])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
BOOM!
```

Hmm... I'm not sure why offhand, but the test you are doing will yield false positives:

```
sage: 1/2 not in GF(3)
True
sage: 1/2 not in GF(2)
True
```
IMO a better test would be

```python
R = self.base_ring()
try:
    R.one() / R(2)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    raise ValueError("2 must be invertible")
```

Thanks Travis. I realised that this doesn't catch 2 not being invertible in ZZ, for example, but a slight variation catches both cases:

```python
try:
    R(R.one()/2)
except (TypeError, ZeroDivisionError):
    raise TypeError('The A-basis is defined only when 2 is invertible ')
```

To check this I wrote some doc-tests that involve coercions between the KL-bases and the A/B-basis and they work. The way we wrote it `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra_nonstandard` inherits from `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra` so it automatically has the `A` and `B` basis classes. If you agree then I could delete the comment on lines 2266-67 (probably the comment should saythat if you want to change any of the basis classes then their names etc have to match those in `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra`).",

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A11):
> Also, do we need corresponding bases in `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra_nonstandard`?

I know that the code actually says on lines 2266-67 that this is necessary but as far as I can see it isn't. To check this I wrote some doc-tests that involve coercions between the KL-bases and the A/B-basis and they work. The way we wrote it `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra_nonstandard` inherits from `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra` so it automatically has the `A` and `B` basis classes. If you agree then I could delete the comment on lines 2266-67 (probably the comment should saythat if you want to change any of the basis classes then their names etc have to match those in `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra`).
