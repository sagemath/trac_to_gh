<a id='comment:17'></a>-1 to changing all of the examples to *only* using GAP3/reflection groups. Until GAP3 becomes an optional spkg, it means they become completely untested. Moreover, it is good to make sure the functionality works between different implementations.

I think there are a few things in here which need to be abstracted up to the category, root system code, and/or Coxeter type code. For example, `is_crystallographic` should be called on the Coxeter type, of which `ReflectionGroup` does not have and should (or perhaps the Coxeter matrix).

I also do not see the reason why this change is needed:

```diff
-                Lambda = {li: coeff[li] * Lambda[li] for li in Lambda}
+                Lambda = {li: coeff[li] * Lambda[li] for li in Lambda.keys()}
```
as the iteration for a dictionary is over its keys (and the former is faster and more memory efficient). With this change:

```diff
-                V_weights.append(pi * fund_weight)

+                #       for ReflectionGroups and CoxeterGroup

+                if isinstance(pi,PermutationGroupElement):
+                    V_weights.append( sum(fund_weight[j]*Phi[ (~pi)(j+1)-1 ] for j in ran
+                else:
+                    V_weights.append(pi * fund_weight)
```
I think it would be better to have the fundamental weights handle the action of the reflection group element.

The header contains tests that the core functionality works for Coxeter groups, maybe one could add a more elaborate example there, providing examples for more functionality.

But I clearly wrote the code the way I did in close relationshiop to the implementation of reflection groups, and I must confess that I prefer the speed (and indeed I need that speed for my research) over the code being usable by other implementations. I think, it is okay to have the code sort of working for `CoxeterGroup`, but for example the necessity to introduce a method `action_on_root_indices` for those tells that there is actually more work to be done to make the implementation work with both without giving up the speed on one, and not introducing unnecessary function overhead on the other.

This should be done soon in my eyes, but I understand that so far I am the only one being desperate to have it.

> I think there are a few things in here which need to be abstracted up to the category, root system code, and/or Coxeter type code. For example, `is_crystallographic` should be called on the Coxeter type, of which `ReflectionGroup` does not have and should (or perhaps the Coxeter matrix).


A reflection group acting on a real vector space can have the property of being crystallographic or not (whether or not it stabilizes a lattice). I thus think the group itself should have this property.

What do you think of (me) adding this method also to Coxeter groups (in this ticket or another)?

As we have per default that simple reflections are families rather than dicts (so that iterating over them actually iterates over them), the reflection group implementation also have simple roots and fundamental weights as finite families, so iterating goes over the values. That's what the `keys` is there for.

If you mean, one might have a method `act on weight`, one could think about it, but the point here is that the action on fundamental weights can be quickly understood using the action on roots, while the general action on weights is not as simple.

I can implement a method `act_on_fundamental_weight` to factor out the hack, but is that what we actually want?

I gonna for now also use

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['A',3])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().is_crystallographic()
True
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',3])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().is_crystallographic()
True
```

You are right about the issue with `Lambda`.

I am okay with you adding an `is_crystallographic` to the group here, but it might be a little strange if the crystallographic-ness of a Coxeter group is different than its Coxeter type/matrix.

The complete implementation depends on `has_descents` and multiplication of elements to be fast (and this will get another boost for `ReflectionGroup` in #20484), when you `%prun` the code for `CoxeterGroup` you don't see a single bottleneck but that it is too slow in many parts (I am not complaining about this speed issue in general, this implementation is uniform for all Coxeter systems, finite or infinite, so that's great and the speed is what one gets there!)

> If it does, you can separate out the important functionality into a separate method, and then subclass the general class which special cases the methods when you use `ReflectionGroup`.


This implementation of subword complexes is **not** a general implementation that could be moved up the hierarchy, and then a few methods could be replaced for concrete implementations. All the internal core methods are written so that internally it only plays with numbers and permutations of numbers, you only see roots popping out when using the API.

Is is indeed possible to write a toy (in terms of speed) implementation for the category of `CoxeterGroups`, but I am not the one doing that at the moment -- what I provide is a research level implementation for `ReflectionGroup`.

> However, let me be a bit more stern, I will not set this ticket to a positive review when you essentially remove doctest coverage because `gap3` is not an optional package yet (although this argument weakens once it is). Moreover, you can test all of the functionality with standard Sage, which such tests should be localized to each method, not (only) in a class-level test which does the "core" functionality.


Hm -- you see my complaints about that above. On the other hand, I also see your point of getting rotten untested code after a while, and I don't really care if we pollute the documentation with more tests.

> By renaming `action_on_root_indices`, you need to deprecate it.


It was only there for a few months, see #11010, and this method is almost surely not used by anyone so far. You still think it should be deprecated ?

> I am okay with you adding an `is_crystallographic` to the group here, but it might be a little strange if the crystallographic-ness of a Coxeter group is different than its Coxeter type/matrix.


How could crystallographic-ness being different for the group and for its Coxeter type ? See Section 2.8 in Humphreys Coxeter group book for a "proof" that the two are the same. Or am I overseeing something?

Same here; it's nice to have a short hand for actions (and to benefit from coercion!), but I am also uncomfortable giving yet another meaning to the operator '*'.

In any cases, we should keep consistency with Weyl groups. It's currently `w.action(l)` there (not `w.act(l)` btw); if we switch to `_act_on_`, then we should do it consistently everywhere.

Term-wise, I think that `w` acts on `l`, while there is an action of `W` on `l`. But I am equally okay to use `w.action(l)` for consistency.

I don't get your point of switching: what is wrong with having the method `action` and then using this method in the body of `_act_on_`?

That is not answering the question I asked. I asked about having one additional level of indirection to have a specialized function for when the input is an instance of `RealReflectionGroup`.

I'm sure there are only some key parts of it which are written that strongly depend on the input format. These could be abstracted to work in general with a special subclass which has the specialized method or into the implementations of the Coxeter group. This is a standard design pattern for code that I've seen many times over (we even have the former in Sage's matrix code).

In many ways, we are beating a dead horse as you have basically done what I am asking for already (with the specializing being done in the different implementations of a Coxeter group).

Then let's leave those tests in. That is the only thing I am asking for here.

Well, my interpretation of Christian's first comment was this was a property of the realization of the group, not of the group itself. So the group's `is_crystallographic` should just call that of its Coxeter type/matrix.

For `CoxeterMatrixGroup`, it is given as a (faithful) representation, so the basis of a vector space is (implicitly) given, which is the roots.

But what if `w` is an element of the group and `v` is a *Sage vector*. Does it represent an element in the vector space spanned the simple roots, or by the simple coroots, or by the fundamental weights, or by the fundamental coweights? Or does that not matter since the actions are all the same?

<a id='comment:44'></a>> Sage's vectors exists expressed in some canonical basis, and by doing matrix multiplication, there is an implicit assumption that these bases are the same. 


I'd say that multiplying a matrix `M` with a vector `v` (as a tuple in distinction to vector space elements) is well-defined and completely independent on bases. So that's totally fine to do as `M*v`.

Only if the matrix is representing a linear map and the tuple represents a vector space element there is an assumption on both being represented in the same basis. When you now represent a Coxeter group element as a matrix you make a choice of basis (which might be the root basis, its dual, some linearly independent vectors of an "ambient space", or any other) This is now what you stick this matrix to, but when you do `w*v`, one does not specify the matrix that represents `w` in some basis, so this operation is ambiguous, as it didn't specify on which space `w` acts here (i.e., it is not clear in which basis you represent `w` as a matrix for that action.

For `ReflectionGroup` I just thought that the best is to have the method `.action` to take two parameters `side` being `"left"` or `"right"` and `on_space` being `"primal"` or `"dual"`.

Beside that, I am okay with providing the coercion to act on the primal, but am also okay with removing it again (I am slightly in favour of keeping it though).

That is not how a `CoxeterMatrixGroup` or a `WeylGroup` is defined. It is given precisely by that choice of representation/matrix, so in a way, it is a Coxeter system along with a specified representation.

Also, any `v` (implicitly) carries with it a vector space (not up to isomorphism), and we are checking to see if the Coxeter group has a defined action on that vector space. An alternative viewpoint is if `v` is a Sage vector, in a way, we are only considering that element up to isomorphism, so we have lost some information (but again, that is if we don't fix a representation which makes a canonical choice of basis for the vector space).

In case there is any ambiguity, I'm also only really advocating for using `*` in the real reflection group setting. Moreover, I think we should avoid using Sage vectors for the roots (at least in the generic parents) because there is some ambiguity about their basis.

The point I wanted to make is that given a field k, you can define an nxn matrix M over k as a table of entries in k and you can define an n-tuple to be an n-tuple x of entries in k, and you can multiply them Mx by some explicit row-column definition. At this point, there is no basis involved. One can even enrich the set k^n with a vector space structure and then see the multiplication by M at a linear map without ever talking about bases. And this multiplication is defined in Sage, even if k is not a field so there is no as simple concept of bases.

Only if one wants to consider a k-linear map phi : V -> V on a vector space V over k as a matrix, then the basis comes into play.

Of course one could say that k^n has an implicit basis in which the above matrix represents a linear map, but that is not quite adequate since k^n comes with a canonical standard basis, so there is no choice of an implicit basis.

> For example, if `M` is a diagonalizable matrix acting on a vector space `V`,


in your argument, you always assume a general vector space V, there I agree that you play with explicit or implicit bases.

> That is not how a `CoxeterMatrixGroup` or a `WeylGroup` is defined. It is given precisely by that choice of representation/matrix, so in a way, it is a Coxeter system along with a specified representation.


That's right, and I am fine with arguing that this action of the group should be used when doing `w*v`. But there are still other spaces involved on which the group also acts, so if you do not specify which space `v` lives in one has to **implicitly** assume it to be this representation.

> In case there is any ambiguity, I'm also only really advocating for using `*` in the real reflection group setting.


My proposition for reflection groups at the moment is

* have a method `.action(vec, side="left", on_space="primal")` that does the appropriate action, and
* have `._act_on_(vec, self_on_left)` defined as `.action(vec, side=side, on_space="primal")` where the side is set depending on self_on_left being `True` or `False`.

> Moreover, I think we should avoid using Sage vectors for the roots (at least in the generic parents) because there is some ambiguity about their basis.


I agree, but I have not yet implemented root spaces and coroot spaces for crg's. So I don't have anything better to provide for now than vectors. But that's on the todo list...

There is a standard basis, but it is not canonical.

This is no more implicit than the relationship with the chosen basis of a matrix and a vector. I still contend that by fixing a representation, we now have a canonical basis for `V` (and we implicitly assume `v` is an element of `V`). For good reasons, we can't tell if `v` is to be considered an element in the representation or some other (isomorphic) vector space.

That is good with me.

When in doubt, I tend to take the path that is easier to change in the
future in case one change one's mind after gaining more experience. In
this case, it's easier to add the coercion later on than to remove it,
or replace it by something else.

But that's no strong opinion. Proceed as you believe is right.

Cheers,
