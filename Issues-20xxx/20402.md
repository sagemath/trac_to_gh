-1 to changing all of the examples to *only* using GAP3/reflection groups. Until GAP3 becomes an optional spkg, it means they become completely untested. Moreover, it is good to make sure the functionality works between different implementations.

I think there are a few things in here which need to be abstracted up to the category, root system code, and/or Coxeter type code. For example, `is_crystallographic` should be called on the Coxeter type, of which `ReflectionGroup` does not have and should (or perhaps the Coxeter matrix).

I also do not see the reason why this change is needed:

```diff

+                Lambda = {li: coeff[li] * Lambda[li] for li in Lambda.keys()}
```
as the iteration for a dictionary is over its keys (and the former is faster and more memory efficient). With this change:

```diff
-                V_weights.append(pi * fund_weight)
+                # TODO: little hack to distinguish the implementations
+                #       for ReflectionGroups and CoxeterGroup
+                from sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element import PermutationGroupElemen

+                else:
+                    V_weights.append(pi * fund_weight)
```
I think it would be better to have the fundamental weights handle the action of the reflection group element.

The header contains tests that the core functionality works for Coxeter groups, maybe one could add a more elaborate example there, providing examples for more functionality.

But I clearly wrote the code the way I did in close relationshiop to the implementation of reflection groups, and I must confess that I prefer the speed (and indeed I need that speed for my research) over the code being usable by other implementations. I think, it is okay to have the code sort of working for `CoxeterGroup`, but for example the necessity to introduce a method `action_on_root_indices` for those tells that there is actually more work to be done to make the implementation work with both without giving up the speed on one, and not introducing unnecessary function overhead on the other.

> Until GAP3 becomes an optional spkg, it means they become completely untested.


This should be done soon in my eyes, but I understand that so far I am the only one being desperate to have it.

> I think there are a few things in here which need to be abstracted up to the category, root system code, and/or Coxeter type code. For example, `is_crystallographic` should be called on the Coxeter type, of which `ReflectionGroup` does not have and should (or perhaps the Coxeter matrix).


A reflection group acting on a real vector space can have the property of being crystallographic or not (whether or not it stabilizes a lattice). I thus think the group itself should have this property.

What do you think of (me) adding this method also to Coxeter groups (in this ticket or another)?

As we have per default that simple reflections are families rather than dicts (so that iterating over them actually iterates over them), the reflection group implementation also have simple roots and fundamental weights as finite families, so iterating goes over the values. That's what the `keys` is there for.

If you mean, one might have a method `act on weight`, one could think about it, but the point here is that the action on fundamental weights can be quickly understood using the action on roots, while the general action on weights is not as simple.

I can implement a method `act_on_fundamental_weight` to factor out the hack, but is that what we actually want?

I gonna for now also use

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['A',3])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().is_crystallographic()
True
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',3])
sage: W.coxeter_matrix().is_crystallographic()
True
```

It's looking a lot better Christian. Thank you.

However, let me be a bit more stern, I will not set this ticket to a positive review when you essentially remove doctest coverage because `gap3` is not an optional package yet (although this argument weakens once it is). Moreover, you can test all of the functionality with standard Sage, which such tests should be localized to each method, not (only) in a class-level test which does the "core" functionality.

For the speed issues, how much of this is making a difference? If it does, you can separate out the important functionality into a separate method, and then subclass the general class which special cases the methods when you use `ReflectionGroup`.

You are right about the issue with `Lambda`.

By renaming `action_on_root_indices`, you need to deprecate it.

I am okay with you adding an `is_crystallographic` to the group here, but it might be a little strange if the crystallographic-ness of a Coxeter group is different than its Coxeter type/matrix.

Also, instead of `act`, IIRC there is a method, which I believe is `_act_on_` (not to be confused with `_acted_upon_`), that automatically gets checked by the coercion framework. So it gives you `w * la` essentially for free. Although

The complete implementation depends on `has_descents` and multiplication of elements to be fast (and this will get another boost for `ReflectionGroup` in #20484), when you `%prun` the code for `CoxeterGroup` you don't see a single bottleneck but that it is too slow in many parts (I am not complaining about this speed issue in general, this implementation is uniform for all Coxeter systems, finite or infinite, so that's great and the speed is what one gets there!)

> If it does, you can separate out the important functionality into a separate method, and then subclass the general class which special cases the methods when you use `ReflectionGroup`.


This implementation of subword complexes is **not** a general implementation that could be moved up the hierarchy, and then a few methods could be replaced for concrete implementations. All the internal core methods are written so that internally it only plays with numbers and permutations of numbers, you only see roots popping out when using the API.

Is is indeed possible to write a toy (in terms of speed) implementation for the category of `CoxeterGroups`, but I am not the one doing that at the moment -- what I provide is a research level implementation for `ReflectionGroup`.

> However, let me be a bit more stern, I will not set this ticket to a positive review when you essentially remove doctest coverage because `gap3` is not an optional package yet (although this argument weakens once it is). Moreover, you can test all of the functionality with standard Sage, which such tests should be localized to each method, not (only) in a class-level test which does the "core" functionality.


Hm -- you see my complaints about that above. On the other hand, I also see your point of getting rotten untested code after a while, and I don't really care if we pollute the documentation with more tests.

It was only there for a few months, see #11010, and this method is almost surely not used by anyone so far. You still think it should be deprecated ?

> I am okay with you adding an `is_crystallographic` to the group here, but it might be a little strange if the crystallographic-ness of a Coxeter group is different than its Coxeter type/matrix.


How could crystallographic-ness being different for the group and for its Coxeter type ? See Section 2.8 in Humphreys Coxeter group book for a "proof" that the two are the same. Or am I overseeing something?

Done, I must admit that I like that way of having an element w in W act on vectors, while I am nervous about this implicitness in the construction that will likely result in bugs.

Same here; it's nice to have a short hand for actions (and to benefit from coercion!), but I am also uncomfortable giving yet another meaning to the operator '*'.

In any cases, we should keep consistency with Weyl groups. It's currently `w.action(l)` there (not `w.act(l)` btw); if we switch to `_act_on_`, then we should do it consistently everywhere.

Term-wise, I think that `w` acts on `l`, while there is an action of `W` on `l`. But I am equally okay to use `w.action(l)` for consistency.

I don't get your point of switching: what is wrong with having the method `action` and then using this method in the body of `_act_on_`?

Oh, I had not noticed that `CoxeterMatrixGroup` were acting on plain vectors with '*'. As you mention this is very ambiguous. For a Weyl group this is even worst: is the vector interpreted as in the span of the (co)roots? of the (co)weights? in the ambient space?

For now, I'd rather keep the notations as explicit as possible (in particular, it's easier to document a method `.action` than an overloaded operator). And leave us room in the future to overload '*', either by default, or upon explicit request from the user.

Yes, the elements are matrices which act on vectors :-)

I agree.

One could define `_act_on_` in different ways for elements in the root/coroot/weight/coweight space, and not at all for plain vectors. But on the reflection group side there is no class for elements in `V` and in `V^*` yet. I am okay with both: considering the action on vectors for now on elements in `V`, or removing the coercion for now.

I'd say that multiplying a matrix `M` with a vector `v` (as a tuple in distinction to vector space elements) is well-defined and completely independent on bases. So that's totally fine to do as `M*v`.

Only if the matrix is representing a linear map and the tuple represents a vector space element there is an assumption on both being represented in the same basis. When you now represent a Coxeter group element as a matrix you make a choice of basis (which might be the root basis, its dual, some linearly independent vectors of an "ambient space", or any other) This is now what you stick this matrix to, but when you do `w*v`, one does not specify the matrix that represents `w` in some basis, so this operation is ambiguous, as it didn't specify on which space `w` acts here (i.e., it is not clear in which basis you represent `w` as a matrix for that action.

For `ReflectionGroup` I just thought that the best is to have the method `.action` to take two parameters `side` being `"left"` or `"right"` and `on_space` being `"primal"` or `"dual"`.

Beside that, I am okay with providing the coercion to act on the primal, but am also okay with removing it again (I am slightly in favour of keeping it though).

No, that is not true except in the most abstract sense of a linear morphism and an element of a vector space. A matrix comes with an implicit choice of a basis, and when we write vectors as tuples, there is an implicit choice of a basis as well. For example, if `M` is a diagonalizable matrix acting on a vector space `V`, we can find some basis such that `M` can be expressed as acting on scalars on that basis. While the diagonal matrix and `M` are different matrices, they define the *same* linear automorphism on `V`, and hence, have the same action on a vector. Yet, to do the computation, we need to express the vector in terms of our basis.

That is not how a `CoxeterMatrixGroup` or a `WeylGroup` is defined. It is given precisely by that choice of representation/matrix, so in a way, it is a Coxeter system along with a specified representation.

Also, any `v` (implicitly) carries with it a vector space (not up to isomorphism), and we are checking to see if the Coxeter group has a defined action on that vector space. An alternative viewpoint is if `v` is a Sage vector, in a way, we are only considering that element up to isomorphism, so we have lost some information (but again, that is if we don't fix a representation which makes a canonical choice of basis for the vector space).

In case there is any ambiguity, I'm also only really advocating for using `*` in the real reflection group setting. Moreover, I think we should avoid using Sage vectors for the roots (at least in the generic parents) because there is some ambiguity about their basis.

The point I wanted to make is that given a field k, you can define an nxn matrix M over k as a table of entries in k and you can define an n-tuple to be an n-tuple x of entries in k, and you can multiply them Mx by some explicit row-column definition.

And this multiplication is defined in Sage, even if k is not a field so there is no as simple concept of bases.

Only if one wants to consider a k-linear map phi : V -> V on a vector space V over k as a matrix, then the basis comes into play.

Of course one could say that k^n has an implicit basis in which the above matrix represents a linear map, but that is not quite adequate since k^n comes with a canonical standard basis, so there is no choice of an implicit basis.

> For example, if `M` is a diagonalizable matrix acting on a vector space `V`,


in your argument, you always assume a general vector space V, there I agree that you play with explicit or implicit bases.

> That is not how a `CoxeterMatrixGroup` or a `WeylGroup` is defined. It is given precisely by that choice of representation/matrix, so in a way, it is a Coxeter system along with a specified representation.


That's right, and I am fine with arguing that this action of the group should be used when doing `w*v`. But there are still other spaces involved on which the group also acts, so if you do not specify which space `v` lives in one has to **implicitly** assume it to be this representation.

> In case there is any ambiguity, I'm also only really advocating for using `*` in the real reflection group setting.


My proposition for reflection groups at the moment is

* have a method `.action(vec, side="left", on_space="primal")` that does the appropriate action, and
* have `._act_on_(vec, self_on_left)` defined as `.action(vec, side=side, on_space="primal")` where the side is set depending on self_on_left being `True` or `False`.

> Moreover, I think we should avoid using Sage vectors for the roots (at least in the generic parents) because there is some ambiguity about their basis.


I agree, but I have not yet implemented root spaces and coroot spaces for crg's. So I don't have anything better to provide for now than vectors. But that's on the todo list...

There is a standard basis, but it is not canonical.

When in doubt, I tend to take the path that is easier to change in the
future in case one change one's mind after gaining more experience. In
this case, it's easier to add the coercion later on than to remove it,
or replace it by something else.

But that's no strong opinion. Proceed as you believe is right.

I am still struggling with the left/right action -- here, we want left actions (i.e., matrix*vector), but the standard for reflection groups is right action. I know how to turn left to right action for real and for well-generated groups, but still don't get it right to have it for the badly generated groups.

Actually, this shouldn't hold this ticket of, but I haven't resorted things yet...

Instead of

```
print "Caution: the Minkowski summands are build with rational vertices."
```
(which it should be print("foo") to be Python3 compatible) you should use Sage's warning mechanism:

```
from warnings import warn
warn("foo", RuntimeWarning)
```
Otherwise LGTM.
