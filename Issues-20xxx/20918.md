Preliminary doc review:

* In defining the class, I'm not sure what the convention should be, but arbitrarily choosing `A` to be the input seems non-standard. Maybe `PP`, instead ?

* Also, `A` is used as the name of the input, and as the size of the the first element of `box_size`. In case you decide to ignore me and stick with `A`.

* It should be specified how `box_size` is determined by `A` if no parameter is given.

* Nitpicky things, I believe that every doc line needs to be "Return ...", I think even ones where saying "Check ..." or "Plots..." makes more sense. The Latex method has "Returns" instead of "Return", and I think some people think this matters. Also, there's some standard way that arguments in methods are supposed to be spaced out (ie, always a space after a comma). Can't remember off-hand if there's supposed to be spaces around `=`, or only when you're using two of them together to check equality.

* All of the `is_SOMEKINDOFSYMMETRY` methods should have an additional line describing what the symmetry means for somebody that hasn't seen the definition before. Same with the methods like `transpose`.

* The `PlanePartitions` class example mentions something about ASMs of size 3, which seems like something left over from a template.

* In the docstring for `random_element()`, it should be formatted so the HTML documentation will have a hyperlink to the doc string for `random_order_ideal()`

You can always be more explicit, such as `array` too.

> * Nitpicky things, I believe that every doc line needs to be "Return ...", I think even ones where saying "Check ..." or "Plots..." makes more sense. The Latex method has "Returns" instead of "Return", and I think some people think this matters.

You should use the declarative form "Return"/"Plot" instead of "Returns"/"Plots". However, it does not, strictly speaking, have to say "Return" (especially if it does not actually return anything).

> Also, there's some standard way that arguments in methods are supposed to be spaced out (ie, always a space after a comma). Can't remember off-hand if there's supposed to be spaces around `=`, or only when you're using two of them together to check equality.

It depends on where this is done. If it is as input, then no spaces, but it if is an assignment of a variable, then there should be spaces.

> * In the docstring for `random_element()`, it should be formatted so the HTML documentation will have a hyperlink to the doc string for `random_order_ideal()`

What (I think) Kevin is saying, in case it is not clear, is to use <code>:meth:\`~sage.combinat.posets.posets.FinitePoset.random_order_ideal\`</code>.

So what exactly is the status of this? What needs to be added before review?

One thing I noticed that seems to be missing is something to check that the list of lists being put in are actually weakly decreasing along rows and columns.

In the show command, rather than using `[A,B,C]` as the name for the arbitrary colors (the triple [A,B,C] already refers to the size of the box), maybe make them `[xz,xy,yz]` so it's clear which color goes to which face.

Hi Jang Soo,
Jessica asked if I could review the ticket. I didn't check the code yet but I made sure that the html doc would build.
I also think that you may want to make some changes so that when you do 

```
sage: view(PlanePartition([[1]]))
```
