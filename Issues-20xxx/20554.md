This was supposed to be fixed in #15993 but a lot of new instances came up...

This syntax is deprecated, see [PEP 3113](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3113/):

```
def add_constraints(self, cons, (args, opts)):
    ...
```

Similarly for `lambda (i,j): ....`. In many cases, we can actually replace the `lambda` function either with a list comprehension (if `lambda` is used for the `map()` function for example) or with an ordinary Python function.
