We have been trying to have an optional GAP3 package for a while now. Instead of the official GAP3, we instead use a forked package [gap3_jm](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~jean.michel/gap3/) which has regularly been updated.

Previously, this was made a Sage package (#8906) but it contained binaries, so it was removed again (#19164).

I removed all binaries, and prepared a new tarball at ​http://downloads.findstat.org/gap3-jm5-2015-02-01.tar.gz .

I think this is the problem: it doesn't seem to be the "official" GAP3 package, just some random repackaging of GAP3.

The development of GAP3 has stopped a long time ago. But there are several GAP3 packages that have never been ported to GAP4, and which are still developed.

From that webpage:

```
To help people who are just interested in GAP3 because they need a package
which has not been ported to GAP4, I have prepared an easy-to install
minimal GAP3 distribution containing an up-to-date versions of the packages.
```

So this is the only place where we can find up-to-date versions of the GAP3 package *chevie* to work with unitary reflection groups and their representation theory.

I fail to see what might be wrong with adding support for those packages using that "random repackaging" since I and several others need them.

I install the packages myself and then use them from within Sage, but since several things inside Sage are about to depend on that package - see #11187, #11010, #10819 - I think it is worth providing the option for others to automatically install that version of GAP3 with the newest *chevie* package.

All the above doesn't explain why you use the repackaged version and not the official GAP 3 release from [http://www.gap-system.org/Gap3/Download3/download.html](http://www.gap-system.org/Gap3/Download3/download.html)

> So this is the only place where we can find up-to-date versions of the GAP3 package *chevie* to work with unitary reflection groups and their representation theory.


No, the official `gap3r4p4` release also contains chevie.

> I fail to see what might be wrong with adding support for those packages using that "random repackaging" since I and several others need them.


Because the repackaging seems to made in a messy way, see #19164.

Neither this nor the above is up-to-date. Afaik, Jean Michel is the only person still actively developing *chevie* and his website is the only place where these new versions can be found. E.g., I found a small bug in chevie last month (so years after the release of `gap3r4p4`) through my Sage usage -- Jean fixed it within a few hours and posted the new version on his website.

Using any other version of gap3 and chevie will result in running into old mistakes that will slow down my understanding of research problems I compute!

With "new version", I guess you mean a new version of the repackaged GAP3?

It should be possible to just get the up-to-date chevie sources without all the extra clutter.

Well,  yes. There were  patches to the  library loaded when loading Chevie.
Since  I maintain the whole distribution, I  decided it makes more sense to
*do*  these  patches  to  the  library  once  and  for  all (this could fix
undiscovered  bugs in other  packages). So the  correct behaviour of Chevie
depends on having my version of gap3/lib.
```

`@`Jeroen, what do you think how to proceed from here?

First of all, thanks for the clarifications!

I think that somebody (either Jean Michel himself or somebody on this Sage ticket) needs to package a source-only repackaged GAP3.

Further questions to be asked to Jean Michel:

1. Could he state more clearly on his website that his version is not just a repackaged GAP3, it's really a fork of GAP3 with additional fixes which are not in GAP3 proper.

2. Can he provide a clean source-only repackaged GAP3?

3. If no to the previous question: is he willing to host such a source-only repackaged GAP3 on his website, if it is created by some Sage contributor?

I don't understand how this differs from my initial suggestion on this ticket.

Dear Christian,
I cannot post directly on sage-trac so I reply to you.

Further questions to be asked to Jean Michel:

> 1.  Could he state  more clearly on  his website that  his version is not
> just  a repackaged GAP3, it's really a fork of GAP3 with additional fixes
> which are not in GAP3 proper.


OK,  I will try to be clear on my webpages. The fact is I do not distribute
a  complete GAP3 distribution (all packages,  all libraries) to save space.
Perhaps I should distribute a complete distribution and this would obsolete
the St Andrews distribution -- it would go from 15MB to 70MB.

> 2. Can he provide a clean source-only repackaged GAP3?


I  could  try  if  I  understand  exactly  what this means. But this should
certainly  not be the  default distribution since  my distribution contains
Mac  and Windows executables (and executables  for some packages which have
executables  separate from the gap3 executable). We thus have to agree to a
name  for this  for-Sage distribution  which I  will keep separate from the
default distribution.

> 3.  If no to the previous question: is  he willing to host such a source-
> only  repackaged  GAP3  on  his  website,  if  it is created by some Sage
> contributor?


Yes.

It means: delete all binaries (i.e. system-specific) from the package. Make sure that the package has a build system such that it can be built/installed in a standard Unix environment.

> We thus have to agree to a name for this for-Sage distribution which I will keep separate from the default distribution.


Well, I wouldn't call it a "for-Sage distribution". Call it a "source distribution". The actual filename doesn't matter much, most likely we will rename it for Sage anyway.

I prepared a first version by

1. taking the tarball from 2016-02-01 from Jean Michel's website
2. deleting all binaries that were listed using `grep -r -m 1 "^"  . | grep "Binary file"`
3. putting the result into a new tarball with the name `gap3-jm5-2015-02-01.tar.gz`, this can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1POEh8bhq1fLXdfTEZkZjVLOGs/view?usp=sharing
4. preparing an optional package using this upstream tarball. This was basically a blind trip through the documentation for creating packages + looking at the old optional package patch #8906.

@jdemeyer and @tscrim: I would very much appreciate if you could have a look!

If the linked tarball is okay, I would discuss with Jean Michel whether he could provide such a source distribution directly on his website.

gap3_source/src$ make
usage: 'make <target>' where target is one of
'x86linux-gcc64'   for x86linux with gcc
'x86linux-gcc'     for x86linux with gcc in 32bit mode
'macosx-gcc'       for mac os x with gcc

'sun-sparc-solaris-cc'  for SUN under Solaris with cc
'bsd'		       for others under Berkeley UNIX with cc
	
	  additional C compiler and linker flags can be passed with
	  'make <target> COPTS=<compiler-opts> LOPTS=<linker-opts>',
	  i.e., 'make x86linux-gcc COPTS=-g LOPTS=-g for debug'
```
and the GAP3 download page (http://www.gap-system.org/Gap3/Download3/download.html) does not say anything about other hardware.

Can you tell me how to extend that `if ... elif ... fi` statement to also support these other options -- and if that is enough for the package to be `optional` rather than `experimental`?

Many thanks!

Does this `Makefile` come from `gap` upstream or from `gap3_jm`?

To start with, I would remove these: `mv gap ../bin/gap.x86linux`. Then at least the name of the executable won't be system-dependent.

Second, are the `x86linux-gcc` and `x86linux-gcc64` rules really `x86`-specific? At first sight, this doesn't seem to be the case: I think it is just 32-bit Linux and 64-bit Linux.

Okay, no problem.

Is there a way to find that out? I compiled `GAP3` for the first time ever to get this optional package.

Installing (copying) files...

This comes from copying executables of ve package, `me` and `qme` somewhere; probably by the ve installation script.

you need to use the corresponding flag, `-f`, to avoid this trouble.

I was not able to reproduce the error, but I added the `-f` flag to the `cp` command. Does that solve the issue?

there is some weirdness with installation of GAP packages. There are packages that need to be compiled, e.g. ve.
Also, there  some weird dangling symlinks in ve/bin:

```
...pkg/ve/bin$ ls -l
total 48
lrwxr-xr-x  1 dima  admin    2 Mar  9 08:38 me.exe -> me

-rw-r--r--  1 dima  admin  773 Aug  3  2014 zme.sh
```
when I see "building complete" message, only the main GAP system was built, but no packages. Then I see

```
mv gap ../bin/gap3
###########################################################
#  Building complete, you can run GAP3 from './../bin/gap3'

Installing (copying) files...
cp: pkg/ve/bin/me.exe: No such file or directory

Error installing (copying) gap3 files.
```



I also notice that gcc is called with option -m32 on the 64-bit OSX 10.11:

```
...
gcc -m32 -O2   -c -o coding.o coding.c
gcc -m32 -o gap gap.o system.o gasman.o scanner.o idents.o read.o eval.o integer.o rational.o cyclotom.o unknown.o finfield.o polynom.o permutat.o word.o costab.o tietze.o agcollec.o aggroup.o pcpresen.o list.o plist.o set.o vector.o vecffe.o range.o blister.o string.o record.o statemen.o function.o coding.o

```
and this looks wrong.

I updated the `Makefile` and removed all `-m32` options. The two `make`s for linux are now

```
@$(MAKE) system.o   CC=gcc  CFLAGS="$(COPTS) -O -DSYS_IS_64_BIT -DSYS_IS_USG -DSYS_HAS_TIME_PROTO -DSYS_HAS_SIGNAL_PROTO -DSYS_HAS_IOCTL_PROTO"
@$(MAKE) gap CC=gcc CFLAGS="$(COPTS) -O -DSYS_IS_64_BIT " SYS_FILE=system.o LOPTS="$(LOPTS) -static"
```
vs

```
@$(MAKE) system.o   CC=gcc  CFLAGS="$(COPTS) -O2 -DSYS_IS_USG -DSYS_HAS_TIME_PROTO -DSYS_HAS_SIGNAL_PROTO -DSYS_HAS_IOCTL_PROTO"
@$(MAKE) gap CC=gcc CFLAGS="$(COPTS) -O " SYS_FILE=system.o LOPTS="$(LOPTS) -static"
```

Do you know if I can also remove the `-O -DSYS_IS_64_BIT` vs `-O2` option to completely get rid of the distinction between 32 and 64 bit versions ?

Jean Michel wrote about deleting the binaries of the packages:

```
You can get rid of all of them since they are little-used packages, or the
binaries provide additionnal functionality and are not essential.
```
So I decided to not touch that part -- if the functionality is wanted at some point, we can still try to figure how to handle them properly...

while `-O2` is almost harmless (OK, the resulting executable might get slower), `SYS_IS_64_BIT` and other `SYS_` variables are poor man's way to pass system parameters to the source code; if you just blindly remove them, you might easily get broken code, as the default might be, say, 32-bit, and this will break low-level stuff that is not platform-independent in this sense. (Have a look at the source, some of these variables are used very heavily). 

A proper way to handle these flags is to figure out their values in spkg-install; you can certainly find tests for system being 32- or 64-bit in other spkg-install scripts.

Some other `SYS_` things are clearly obsolete, on the other hand, i.e. they specify whether or not system has a feature certainly present on any system supported by Sage...

well, "handle them properly" is not straightforward. Actually, I did port ve and anusq to modern world systems; I do use them in my research; the main issue was the reliance on an very old obsolete version of GMP. See
http://github.com/gap-packages/ve and https://github.com/dimpase/anusq

And Simon King has a lot of experience with meataxe - maybe he can tell you how to deal with it.

Now that's ironic.

In my good old-style group cohomology spkg, I used meataxe-2.2.4, which is identical with version 2.2.3 except for its licence, which is about a decade old.

But old-style spkgs got broken on purpose, hence, I now try to create a new style cohomology spkg, and while I am at it I try to use a more recent version of meataxe. The current release (which is several years old) is version 2.4.24, and the current snapshot (which also includes one of my patches) is 2.5.0. 

> In principle, GAP3 meataxe needs executables, that's all.


What is the difference between 2.2.4 and 2.4.24? Well, the good news is that the executables kept their names, and the storage format has not changed. Hence, if GAP3 merely needs the executables then using the new meataxe should be fine.

I accidentally `tar`'ed the wrong folder when updating the tarball, so it was completely corrupted. I hope it is now the correct one without binaries or broken copies of itself...

If you mean that the package didn't install, this was due to my wrong tarball. Otherwise, I don't know what you mean here.

For example:

```
if [ "x$SAGE_CHECK" = xyes ]; then
    $MAKE check
else
    $MAKE install
fi

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error installing Foo."
    exit 1
fi
```

The check for errors is in the last "if"-clause. Without that text, the install script would report a successful installation of the package, even if building or testing it gave an error.

I think the `spkg-src` file is now working, but I still have two issues:

* I get a different checksum, even though I do not see what I did differently than before.
* The command `grep -r -m 1 "^"  . | grep "^Binary file" | xargs rm` is not very clean because of the error

```
rm: cannot remove ‘Binary’: No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove ‘file’: No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove ‘matches’: No such file or directory
```
  Do you know how to do that better?

Thanks!

I had to fix one more issue (I missed to update the gap3 folder structure in `gap.sh`). I also updated the tarball with several changes in Jean Michel's original tarball from the past few days.

I hope I have not forgot to update anything else, and mark it again as `needs review` -- thanks!

These doctests actually also did not work before either: I installed gap3 myself and made it start on the command-line using the command `gap3`. I then did

```

Alternatively, you could make gap3 an experimental package now and move it to optional in #18971.

One detail I just saw: `spkg-src` still mentions ECL :-)

And don't forget to fix the optional tags referring to chevie.

I would `_really_` like to get this as an optional package before we have a week meeting here in Berlin to work on (and hopefully finalize!) #11187 in two weeks from now.

I asked for a new password, so I can reply myself.
I examined several times over the past 15 years a possible port of Chevie to GAP4.
My conclusions:
-it would be as much work as rewriting everything completely, thus it would take several months of my life.
-I do not see any benefit for me doing that, and I do not see, if I rewrite everything, why GAP4 would be the best target. Maybe sage would be a better target.
-On the other hand, I would benefit from an optional gap3 package in sage, would it be only to use the nice notebook interface to pepare my presentations about chevie. I would do it myself if I knew more about what is needed, and I thank Christian Stump for doing it. I will help him as I can.

Really? What are the crucial features you miss in GAP4 that are used in Chevie?

I use GAP (and hack a bit on it, too) for some 23 years, and I saw transitions of packages like GRAPE from GAP3 to GAP4 without too much pain. You don't need to make use of new GAP4 features, good old records are still there.

I (half)ported ve and anusq to GAP4, it was certainly not very trivial, but quite doable and quick. (they are now useful in GAP4, although not as "proper" packages, but as collections of functions).

First, I should tell you that I looked at the problem of porting chevie with Frank Luebeck, and he agrees with my conclusions. This is not the place/time to give a detailed answer, but roughly:
chevie contains about a hundred different types of mathematical objects, which in gap3 are just records with a certain .operations fields, and methods are just functions which dispatch based

I wanted to thank you for your modifications to the makefile in ve (It seems you did not change anything else?). It also seems that you changed a few lines in one gap function in anusq to translate it to gap4. I am sorry to say that this is completely trivial compared to rewriting the several hundred thousand lines of chevie.

But you don't need this new type of objects!

Wow, I really appreciate the way you talk about my work :-)
If you cared to look at the diff of my changes to ve you could have seen the changes done in full glory, OK? 
https://github.com/gap-packages/ve/commits/master
(the are mostly about switching to modern GMP, if you must know)

Whereas your GAP3 code would just work in GAP4, with very minimal and trivial changes.

Sorry. I went to https://github.com/gap-packages/ve and used the option "download zip"
and did not see that many changes. Either you changes are quite old (several years ago) and I already got them without noticing, or I did something wrong. Anyway, please stick to technical points.

No. But if you think otherwise, just do some non-trivial example and show me.

Earlier releases of GAP4 had GAP3 compatibility modes (a choice of various options).
Did you try any of these?

Jean, it is okay to comment out the lines

```
#RequirePackage("anusq");
#RequirePackage("arep");
#RequirePackage("meataxe");
#RequirePackage("nq");
#RequirePackage("sisyphos");
#RequirePackage("ve");
```
in `init.g` and delete those folders in `gap3/pkg`, without getting into any trouble for `chevie`?

Otherwise, I could also try to build those packages that needs compilation, but already `meataxe` failed on a first try.

You can comment out all of them but arep.g
The function MovedPointsPerm defined in arep/lib/tools.g is used in various places including chevie. 

Generally speaking, arep has some functionality which does not need its binaries. You could delete the subdirectories bin and src of arep if you keep the rest.

In the version I am preparing (complete gap3 distribution), I will make sure all included packages can be compiled
and work on x86 64bits at least.

Of course. They do not deal at all with the operations records which is the crux of the matter.

Dima, thanks for checking!

I deleted all packages that need compilation. This solved your request on this behalf.

I would appreciate if you could retry to build it on OSX (don't forget to download the new tarball first); at least the two broken symlinks

```
cp: gap3/pkg/ve/bin/me.exe: No such file or directory
cp: gap3/pkg/ve/bin/qme.exe: No such file or directory
```
are now gone together with the complete package.
