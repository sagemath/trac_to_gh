In projective morphism the code block for minimal periodic points around line 3003

```
        if not minimal:
            return points
        else:
            rem_indices = []
            for i in range(len(points)-1,-1,-1):
                # iterate points to check if minimal
                P = points[i]
                for j in range(1,n):
                    P = self(P)
                    if P == points[i]:
                        points.pop(i)
                        break
            return points
```
has an unused list and could use some additional comments to explain what this is doing.

In addition to adding the documentation to the minimal section I made three improvements to the function

- allowed the user to pass in a ring where the points should be defined

- extended the functionality to include finite fields

- allowed the user to choose the method used
