The diff is a pain -- I had to interchange the appearance of the classes `SubwordComplex` and `SubwordComplexFacet` in the file in order to write `Element = SubwordComplexFacet` into the `SubwordComplex` class.

So what did I change:

* the the init of subword complex
* added the `__classcall__` method to make parents unique
* tiny changes to make the input a tuple instead of a list (this also forced changes in multiple other places such as `Q.reverse` or in the function definition of the cython file.

Once the above issue is solved, this is ready for review.

Some comments:

- Could you add some doctests to `__classcall__` (good tests include checking the uniqueness against different input types)?
- Could you add a `TestSuite(SC).run()` (possibly skipping tests)?
- The `SubwordComplex.__eq__` is redundant (and slower) than that given by `UniqueRepresentation`.
- Instead of `__call__`, you should be able to use `_element_constructor_`. By doing this, it fits into Sage's coercion framework (although I guess that doesn't quite apply here [yet]) and you shouldn't have to do `hasattr(F,"parent") and F.parent() is self`.

I can also work on this over the weekend.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A7):
> - Could you add a `TestSuite(SC).run()` (possibly skipping tests)?

This is already done in the tests inside `__init__`. Or do you mean something else?

> - Instead of `__call__`, you should be able to use `_element_constructor_`. By doing this, it fits into Sage's coercion framework (although I guess that doesn't quite apply here [yet]) and you shouldn't have to do `hasattr(F,"parent") and F.parent() is self`.

If I do that, the class inherits the `__call__` from simplicial complexes, which then results `SC([0,1])` to not return an element class element but a list. What is appropriate then here?
