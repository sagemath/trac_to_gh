Regarding

```
print("Sage requires Python 2.5 or newer", file=sys.stderr)
```

I'm pretty sure that Sage requires Python 2.7. But honestly, I would just remove that check, I don't see the point of it.

Another point: if you're making changes to the division anyway, you might as well use `//` and add `from `__future__` import division`.

+1, I am fairly sure that when we upgraded to python 2.7 in sage 5.0 a few changes where incompatible with earlier python, and it just pilled on from there.
