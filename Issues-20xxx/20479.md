The documentation of `vertex_boundary` says that *If vertices2 is None, then vertices2 is the complement of vertices1*. However this is not the case, as shown in this example.

```
sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(3)
sage: G.vertex_boundary([0,1], vertices2=None)
[0, 1, 2]
sage: G.vertex_boundary([0,1], vertices2=set(G.vertices()).difference([0,1]))
[2]
sage: D = DiGraph(G)
sage: D.vertex_boundary([0,1])
[0, 1, 2]
sage: D.vertex_boundary([0,1], vertices2=set(D.vertices()).difference([0,1]))
[2]
```
This patch solves this issue.

References to corrected bugss should be in `TESTS` section.

But more importantly, how this *should* work? If I understood correctly (have not compiled yet), then this will change current behaviour when `vertices2=None`. This can surprise users.

This is correct. Actually I did this patch because one of my colleague was surprized that the behavior of the method is different than what it claims to be.
Since it has not been reported before, I suspect that very few people are using this method.
I don't know if we have to follow a particular (and long) procedure for such case.

We have deprecation policy, but it is hard to use in this case. Should we add a note-block? Maybe not.

Thinking more about this... If I ask neighboring states of Finland and Sweden (they are neighbors), I expect the answer to be Norway, Denmark and Russia only. Using that as analogy, I think that this can go on.

I will compile and test this later today.
