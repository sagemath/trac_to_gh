<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello,

I have a question: I noticed `BinaryReedMullerCode` in `guava.py` is basically dead code.
We reimplemented it as a proper class in #20705 and it's no longer imported.
If it's fine with you, can you delete it in this ticket? 
I don't think it's necessary to open another ticket to remove this method.

David
