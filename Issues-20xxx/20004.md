After [flint pull request 213](https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/213) and [flint pull request 221](https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/221) flint will have a native support for going back and forth between an integer polynomial and its power sums series.

We provide generic methods `power_sums` and `power_sums_to_poly` for any polynomial and use direct call to flint when available.

Status: new

Indeed, it uses Newton formula. However, there is #20399 to review first because

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: p = x^2 + 4
sage: c = p._pari_().polsym(5)
sage: c
[2, 0, -8, 0, 32, 0]~
sage: c.sage()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Object (=[2, 0, -8, 0, 32, 0]~) must be of type t_VEC.
```

<a id='comment:5'></a>1. Indeed, the pari way does now work

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: p = x^2 + 4
sage: c = p.__pari__().polsym(5)
sage: c
[2, 0, -8, 0, 32, 0]~
sage: c.sage()
[2, 0, -8, 0, 32, 0]
```

2. Concerning the original goal of the ticket, there is no release of flint yet...
