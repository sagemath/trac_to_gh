While working on #20226, I got hit by a similar problem as #14460, namely [https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56982](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56982)

Since this bug is supposed to be fixed upstream in GCC 4.9.0, I think the time has come to blacklist all GCC versions older than 4.9.

Was this announced in sage-devel?  After rebasing branch I was working in on the current develop sage suddenly wants to compile gcc because of this.  gcc 4.8 is the default version on Ubuntu 14.04 which is the current LTS (not counting 16.04 which hasn't quite yet been released).

It seems extreme to me to blacklist an entire compiler when there's a simple workaround (`-fno-tree-dominator-opts`) that can be applied only for that version.  As a compromise, perhaps issue a loud warning when the workaround is used as it may affect performance, for anyone who cares.  It would only need to be enabled for those modules that need it.

There is no simple workaround. The `-fno-tree-dominator-opts` workaround happens to fix one particular instance of the problem, not the problem in general. In particular, `-fno-tree-dominator-opts` does not fix the similar issue from #20226. I was too lazy to investigate yet another workaround for #20226.

Don't you think dropping support for an entire series of compiler versions that is still relatively commonly in use, without a deprecation process and without warning is a bit of a problem?

I'm sure there's a workaround in the other case too.
