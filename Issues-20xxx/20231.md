While working on #20226, I got hit by a similar problem as #14460, namely [https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56982](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56982)

Since this bug is supposed to be fixed upstream in GCC 4.9.0, I think the time has come to blacklist all GCC versions older than 4.9.

There is no simple workaround. The `-fno-tree-dominator-opts` workaround happens to fix one particular instance of the problem, not the problem in general. In particular, `-fno-tree-dominator-opts` does not fix the similar issue from #20226. I was too lazy to investigate yet another workaround for #20226.

Don't you think dropping support for an entire series of compiler versions that is still relatively commonly in use, without a deprecation process and without warning is a bit of a problem?

I'm sure there's a workaround in the other case too.
