This is a meta-ticket about piecewise functions.

Fractional part, modulo, ...:
- #9935: Make a symbolic mod function
- #21232: Fractional part function {x}
- #21274: frac(x) immediate simplifications
- #21745: Standardize modulo operator % on real numbers (step 1)
- #21747: Standardize modulo operator % on real numbers (step 2)
- #21748: change the mod method of rationals

Piecewise functions of 1 variable:
- #1773: piecewise functions and integration / arithmetic do not play well together
- #8603: Partial sums are off for Fourier series of piecewise functions
- #11225: improve piecewise plotting
- #6895: Detect discontinuities when plotting the ceil function
- #10597: Riemann sums, added trapezoid option
- #21215: Periodic piecewise functions
- #21412: Convert piecewise functions to SymPy
- #21618: plot in piecewise regression (?)
- #21709: Categories for piecewise functions
- #34456: piecewise polynomial in one dimension


`RealSet`s, underlying the current implementation of `piecewise`:
- #16063: Unify the classes `RealSet` and `UnionOfIntervals`
- #21249: `RealSet`s fail their `TestSuite`: `_test_category`, `_test_pickling`
- #21277: `sage_input` for `RealSet` and `piecewise`
- #21243: `RealSet`: add methods `closure`, `interior`, `boundary`, `is_open`, `is_closed`
- #31941: Make empty `RealSet` false
- #31927: `RealSet`: Replace `is_included_in` by `is_subset` / `issubset`
- #31930: Replace `UnionOfIntervals` by `RealSet`
- #31914: `RealSet.contains`: Handle symbolic argument
- #31877: Refine category of `RealSet`
- #32181: `RealSet`: Faster operations by scan-line (merging) techniques
- **#31740: Meta-ticket: Families, posets, complexes of manifold subsets**
- #21242: Allow initializing `RealSet` from `RealInterval` or `RBF` elements (dup: #17791)

As a generalization, this meta-ticket will implement piecewise functions of several real variables. 
The pieces are polyhedral complexes (not necessarily triangulations) or more generally polyhedral dissections (i.e., not necessarily face-to-face).
In my application, the functions will be piecewise linear, possibly discontinuous; but the implementation should be general enough for splines.

- #31748 `PolyhedralComplex`
- #26512 Piecewise linear functions of several variables

Discussion welcome, in particular in regard to how this code should interact with the existing classes for abstract complexes (CW complexes) and `PointConfiguration`.

- #20878: `PointConfiguration`: Add `plot` method
- #20879: Expose PPL's Not-Necessarily-Closed Polyhedra using Sage Polyhedra -- could play the same role as half-open intervals do in the context of the new piecewise functions.
- #22710: Meta-ticket: polymake
- #24943: Interface to polymake's polyhedral complexes
- #21151: Update TOPCOM to 0.17.7, disable outdated libsoplex support
- #26887: Implement `CombinatorialPolyhedron`
- #27063: Transition of combinatorial computations of Polyhedron to Combinatorial Type
- #31842: `CombinatorialPolyhedralComplex`
- #18197: Add CGAL package

General piecewise functions:
- #23923: Interface cases function with `SymPy`'s piecewise
- #20191: implement `SymPy` `Piecewise` equivalent
- #21412: Convert piecewise functions to `SymPy`

I'm interested in implementing piecewise affine functions in one variable with specific methods that are easier to implement in this setting (e.g. `compose`, `is_bijective`, `inverse`, `is_convex`, `convex_hull`, `laplace_transform`, etc.) Mostly, I'm interested in the case where the coefficients of the affine parts are in `QQ` but I might also want to consider the case where they are in a fixed number field.

I'm wondering whether I should derive from the class `sage.functions.piecewise.PiecewiseFunction` (which is mostly concerned with symbolic expressions) or if it is okay if I rewrite my own class from scratch.

I'm familiar with the piecewise linear function code in the above github folder, and I'd love to have that integrated into sage. This has been on my wishlist for a few years, but the integration has never happened, partially because I don't have a clear view on where this new class should be derived from and what methods are useful to general users.

Besides the class hierarchy, I think that the main modification concerns changing the use of close or open or half-open intervals defined in https://github.com/mkoeppe/cutgeneratingfunctionology/blob/master/cutgeneratingfunctionology/igp/intervals.py to `RealSet`.

Regarding the class hierarchy, `class PiecewiseLinearFunction_1d (ModuleElement)` https://github.com/mkoeppe/cutgeneratingfunctionology/blob/master/cutgeneratingfunctionology/igp/fast_piecewise.py#L17 for the element is already good, I think. The corresponding parent is https://github.com/mkoeppe/cutgeneratingfunctionology/blob/master/cutgeneratingfunctionology/igp/fast_piecewise.py#L1221

There are many details so that it works correctly with all operations provided by the category. 

If this is added to Sage, it would be best to put it somewhere that's not `sage.functions` because this package concerns symbolic functions.

If the scope remains piecewise linear functions (or even piecewise polynomial functions where the pieces are polyhedra such as box splines or simplex splines), then somewhere in `sage.geometry` would make sense because of its close ties to https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/discrete_geometry/sage/geometry/polyhedral_complex.html

Another connection: both `indicator_function` and `convex_indicator_function` (proposed to add in #32201) of polyhedra are, of course, piecewise linear functions.
