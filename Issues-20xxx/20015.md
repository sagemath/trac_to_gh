1.

```
sage: Matrix(whatever=53)
[]
```

2. Optimize by avoiding import of `numpy`.

3. Add a lot more doctests (many branches in the constructor are not doctested!).

4. Change exception types and message to be more consistent.

If the data must be coercible then the last 3 should fail. Though, if the ring is provided I would be less strict and also allow conversion (and make all the above work).

The following should either work or not work for all rings

```
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,'3')
[3 0]
[0 3]
sage: matrix(RBF,2,2,'3')
[3.000000000000000                 0]

sage: matrix(ZZ,2,2,'3')
...
TypeError: entries has the wrong length
sage: matrix(QQbar,2,2,'3')
...
TypeError: entries has the wrong length
```
(there is something weird above since `QQbar('3')` does not work but `ZZ('3')` does)

Similarly, some rings are less strict about input conversion/coercion

```
sage: matrix(QQbar,2,2,3.0)
...
TypeError: entries must be coercible to a list or the base ring
sage: matrix(ZZ,2,2,3.0)
[3 0]
[0 3]

This is actually due to Python treating strings as some kind of list. Really, there is very little difference between `"abcd"` and `["a", "b", "c", "d"]`. So we unless we explicitly blacklist strings (which I don't want to do), I think this error is unavoidable.
