1.

```
sage: Matrix(whatever=53)
[]
```

2. Optimize by avoiding import of `numpy`.

3. Add a lot more doctests (many branches in the constructor are not doctested!).

4. Change exception types and message to be more consistent.

The error message does not correspond to what is happening with other entries

```
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,0)
[0 0]
[0 0]
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,0.0)
[0 0]
[0 0]
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,'0')
[0 0]
[0 0]
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,'0.0')
...
TypeError: entries must be coercible to a list or integer
```
If the data must be coercible then the last 3 should fail. Though, if the ring is provided I would be less strict and also allow conversion (and make all the above work).

The following should either work or not work for all rings

```
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,'3')
[3 0]
[0 3]
sage: matrix(RBF,2,2,'3')
[3.000000000000000                 0]
[                0 3.000000000000000]
sage: matrix(ZZ,2,2,'3')
...
TypeError: entries has the wrong length
sage: matrix(QQbar,2,2,'3')
...
TypeError: entries has the wrong length
```
(there is something weird above since `QQbar('3')` does not work but `ZZ('3')` does)

Similarly, some rings are less strict about input conversion/coercion

```
sage: matrix(QQbar,2,2,3.0)
...
TypeError: entries must be coercible to a list or the base ring
sage: matrix(ZZ,2,2,3.0)
[3 0]

This is actually due to Python treating strings as some kind of list. Really, there is very little difference between `"abcd"` and `["a", "b", "c", "d"]`. So we unless we explicitly blacklist strings (which I don't want to do), I think this error is unavoidable.

Fine for me. Could you at least replace "coerce" by "convert" in the error message?

The following should be coherent between various ring as well

```
sage: matrix(ZZ,2,2,'1234')
[1 2]
[3 4]
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,'1234')
[1234    0]
[   0 1234]
```

Can we please leave both of these for #20211? This ticket deals with the higher-level matrix constructor, not with how matrices are initialized from the given entries.
