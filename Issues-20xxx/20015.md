1.

```
sage: Matrix(whatever=53)
[]
```

2. Optimize by avoiding import of `numpy`.

3. Add a lot more doctests (many branches in the constructor are not doctested!).

4. Change exception types and message to be more consistent.

Not really, that was a different issue with `range` vs. `srange`, unrelated to the matrix constructor. But of course you are right that we should use Sage integers.

For some input we get strange error messages

```
sage: matrix(ZZ,2,3,1)
...
TypeError: self must be a space of square matrices
```
And some strange input might actually gives a matrix

```
sage: matrix(RR, 1.5, 2.3)

(there is something weird above since `QQbar('3')` does not work but `ZZ('3')` does)

Similarly, some rings are less strict about input conversion/coercion

```
sage: matrix(QQbar,2,2,3.0)
...
TypeError: entries must be coercible to a list or the base ring
sage: matrix(ZZ,2,2,3.0)
[3 0]
[0 3]
```

This is actually due to Python treating strings as some kind of list. Really, there is very little difference between `"abcd"` and `["a", "b", "c", "d"]`. So we unless we explicitly blacklist strings (which I don't want to do), I think this error is unavoidable.

Fine for me. Could you at least replace "coerce" by "convert" in the error message?

The following should be coherent between various ring as well

```
sage: matrix(ZZ,2,2,'1234')
[1 2]
[3 4]
sage: matrix(QQ,2,2,'1234')
[1234    0]

Can we please leave both of these for #20211? This ticket deals with the higher-level matrix constructor, not with how matrices are initialized from the given entries.
