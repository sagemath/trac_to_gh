On sage 7.1 plot is failing for this simple function:

```
var('t r K')
N = function('N')(t)
diffeq2 = diff(N, t) == r*N*(1-N/K)
sol = desolve(diffeq2,dvar=N, ivar=t)#, ics=(0,10))
plot(sol(r=0.3,K=60, _C=10),(t,0,40))
```

The error message is this:

```
verbose 0 (3517: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting,
failed to evaluate function at 200 points.
verbose 0 (3517: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message:
'unable to simplify to float approximation'
```
