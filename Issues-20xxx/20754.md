I am surprised no one had a look at #17966 first. I would note the following bit that I had to add but you haven't:

```
echo "Bootstraping boost"
# By default this is populated by a system value.
# If boost has been installed system wide it can cause interference.
# The build can fail purely and simply without much of an explanation.
export BOOST_BUILD_PATH="${SAGE_LOCAL}"/share/boost-build
./bootstrap.sh --with-toolset=gcc \
               --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL"
```
