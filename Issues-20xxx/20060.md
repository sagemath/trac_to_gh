This is **very** inconvenient:

```
sage: x=polygen(QQ,'x')
sage: binomial(x,3).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```
The polynomials are converted to the symbolic ring before any computation is done. This is apparently done by the general symbolic function framework.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Note that the function from `sage.arith.misc` is good

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: sage.arith.misc.binomial(x,3)
1/6*x^3 - 1/2*x^2 + 1/3*x
sage: parent(_)
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```
It is the symbolic wrapper which is to blame...

<a id='comment:5'></a>it seems to work now.

is there a doctest for the correction in #20312 ?
