This is **very** inconvenient:

```
sage: x=polygen(QQ,'x')
sage: binomial(x,3).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```
The polynomials are converted to the symbolic ring before any computation is done. This is apparently done by the general symbolic function framework.

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)

It is the symbolic wrapper which is to blame...
