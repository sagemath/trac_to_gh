Since the upgrade to Numpy 1.11, the patch cygwin-lapack_lite-setup.py.patch no longer applies.  This is hardly the first time (#17014, etc. :)

It's not entirely clear whether this patch is even needed anymore.  The first version of it was added 8 years ago: http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=develop&id=f0ef7690e4f601e289608a09fe30df9d242eb3e8

It's not exactly clear what issue this is fixing, and I can't find any obvious reference to what it might have been--not in any of the more recent Cygwin-related documentation or anywhere.  Numpy *compiles* fine without it. 

Keywords: cygwin windows numpy

To elaborate a bit on this: the build system of Sage tracks versions of installed packages. If you change the `spkg-install` script or change patches of a package, Sage will *not* automatically rebuild that package.

If you do want the package to be rebuilt, you need to increase the patchlevel in `package-version.txt`. This means either appending `.p0` or changing `.pN` to `.p(N+1)`.

You should always increase the patchlevel when changing the `spkg-install` script or patches of a package *unless there is a good reason not to*. Typical reasons "not to":

- A completely trivial change, like a typo.

- A change which affects only the **build system** of the package but does **not change the installed package** (not even in a minor way).

- The change affects only a particular platform **and** the package did not **build** on that platform before.

Regardless of the above reasons, a reviewer should always check that the changed package builds and works fine. This means doing a forced rebuild of the package using `sage -f PACKAGE`. Ideally, a build from scratch (`make distclean; make`) should also be tested.
