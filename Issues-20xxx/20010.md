In #19127, the automatic deleting of empty directories was removed, because of the mistaken assumption that it was not needed. While it's not needed in all cases, it is needed in one case:

it can happen that `git checkout` leaves behind an empty directory (since it does not track directories), for example `src/doc/en/reference/manifolds`. These directories should be deleted, otherwise Sphinx complains.
