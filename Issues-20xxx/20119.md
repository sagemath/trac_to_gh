Most Mac applications come in a dmg with an arrow pointing to a symlink of Applications. I have taken one of the dmg's and added the necessary files to make this work:

![](http://unhyperbolic.org/macSage/screenshot.png)

http://unhyperbolic.org/macSage/

Could we change the sage Mac distribution to be like that?

All that is necessary is copying two files (.DT_store and .background/background.png) to the directory from which the dmg is created by hditutil in local/bin/sage-bdist.

I got the background image above from the Apache project, we should probably design one for sage, for some inspiration, here is the FireFox one:

I left out some fine print when I said "all the is necessary". It is not quiet as easy, but solvable!

The problem is that the volume name in the dmg we are creating is changing since it contains the sage version number. And the .DT_store doesn't save a relative path to the background image but a pair (volume name, absolute path within volume), so we need to update the .DT_store for every release.

Luckily, there are pure python tools to update the .DT_store file such as [ds_store](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ds_store) and [mac_alias](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mac_alias) so that we can create a .DT_store file by hand once in finder and then do the update programmatically for subsequent releases or flavors.

dmg-builder for example does that [here](https://bitbucket.org/al45tair/dmgbuild/src/b08746ed79385ccc512cc23342cf698c5ba0bd3e/dmgbuild/core.py?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default#core.py-355)

We can write a little python script invoked by local/bin/sage-bdist to use the above libraries to:
- ds_store.DSStore.open the file
- get the value at the key [ '.' ][ 'icvp' ][ 'backgroundImageAlias' ]
- deserialize to a mac_alias.Alias object
- change the volume name in that object's volume info
- write it all back

mac_alias seems to use Mac OS X specific API, so we might need to use the system's python for that.

One question I have if I were to implement it: this would mean that the dmg build process becomes dependent on the above packages ds_store and mac_alias, where should these be installed?

Unfortunately, it is a binary format and not that easy :( But I got it to work.


> Alternatively make a virtualenv Python package install with the necessary packages somewhere e.g. in `src/mac-app/tools/`.


Just to make sure, you mean in, e.g., the Makefile, creating a virtualenv, installing the needed packages in there and then run it or you mean creating a virtualenv and checking it into the sage repository?

> Note that the mac app is built with the Makefile in #19673 and not with anything in the Sage repo until somebody manages to review that trivial ticket. In particular `sage-bdist` is not used.


Thanks for letting me know.

I think you can just remove $(TARGET)/.DS_store from the non_app_files: target in src/mac-app/Makefile and then build it on 10.7  -without the nice arrangement of the icons and background image :(

I am not sure how you can tell binary_pkg to pick up that change. I would commit that change to a local repository and point binary_pkg's sage_yaml to that local repository.
