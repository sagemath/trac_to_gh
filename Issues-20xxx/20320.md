In short:

```
In file included from tkStubLib.c:15:0:
/usr/include/tk.h:78:23: fatal error: X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory
 # include <X11/Xlib.h>
```

If you add /opt/X11/include/ to its include path, it compiles without an issue.

This is perhaps more a bug of graphviz, but in either case it is easily fixable, e.g.:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11465258/xlib-h-not-found-when-building-graphviz-on-mac-os-x-10-8-mountain-lion

I fixed it in a lazy way by: 

```
 ln -s /opt/X11/include/X11 $SAGE_ROOT/local/include/
```
