```
We should expose PARI's functionality for counting roots of polynomials in a closed interval:

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: pari((x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3)).polsturm(1,2)
2
```
Note that the boundary behavior has changed from PARI 2.7 (which did not include the left endpoint of the interval as a root) to 2.8 (which does do so).

Depends on #20256

Running Patchbot overnight, will play with the code tomorrow. 

Just looking at the source, you're probably going to want to include a check in the code to make sure your polynomial has an appropriate base field, and a test making sure this check behaves properly. Easiest way would to be to check that self.base_field() is RR/QQ/ZZ. There's a potential issue if somebody's polynomial has real coefficients, but is constructed in a complex ring. That is something I may personally do, as testing the Cyclic Sieving Phenomenon involves evaluating polynomials with nonnegative integer coefficients at complex roots of unity. But I suppose the user can just change the base ring appropriately if they want to test for real roots in that case.

Also, there should be the option of having a be -\infty and b being +\infty (the Maxima code for counting number of real roots in an interval allows these options, not sure about pari). My main interest in this code would checking to see if all of a polynomial's roots are real, so I would personally want a simple alias 'is_real_rooted()' that returns 'all_roots_in_interval(-Inf,Inf)'.

Agreed. However, it might be easier to do this check *after* converting to PARI.

That's undocumented in PARI, so I think it's a bad idea to rely on that.

It's in the 2.7 documentation:

```
polsturm(pol, {a}, {b}): Number of real roots of the real squarefree polynomial pol in the interval ]a,b], using Sturm's algorithm. a (resp. b) is taken to be -infinity (resp. +infinity) if omitted.
```
Or have you seen the 2.8 user guide yet (which I haven't found)? There does need to be a change of text to change the interval from ]a,b] (open on the left, closed on the right) to [a,b] (closed both sides).

PARI-2.7 is ancient. In PARI-2.8, the syntax has changed, you are supposed to use `polsturm(pol, [a,b])` instead.

The PARI-2.8 user guide might not be online, but you can access the documentation from Sage: run `./sage --gp` and then type `??polsturm`.

I created #20257 to deprecate `pari(...).polsturm(a, b)` in Sage.

Merged #20256 to do the Infinity conversion.

I don't know what to do about type-checking. If you have a polynomial over C but whose coefficients actually belong to R, then PARI seems to handle this correctly (I added a doctest to this effect). However, we have trouble with inexact polynomials which are (apparently) not squarefree:

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(RR)
sage: pol = (x-1)^2*(x-2)^2*(x-3)
sage: pol.is_squarefree() # Should be False
True
sage: pari(pol).issquarefree # Should be 0
1
sage: pol.count_roots_in_interval()
...
PariError: domain error in polsturm: issquarefree(pol) = 0
```
I created ticket #20282 for this issue, in case we decide not to deal with it here (which would be my preference).

The Sage philosophy is usually that the base ring matters. So, if the polynomial defined over CC happens to have real coefficients, that's an accident. It doens't mean that functions expecting real input should work.

Here is a better solution: make the function work on complex inputs! Now I first attempt a conversion to RR, and if no exception is raised I pass the (unconverted) input directly to PARI; that way, exact inputs stay exact. If that fails, I convert to CC (allowing an exception through if it occurs), and take the GCD of the polynomial with its conjugate (and strip off the leading coefficient) to get a polynomial with real coefficients and all the same real roots as before.

Patchbot doesn't like something about the way errors are raised. I think it would be a bit more straightforward to make the arguments be `(self,lower_bound=None,upper_bound=None)`, and just not allow for the option of specifying the bounds as a two-element list.

In terms of the names of functions, I think `count_roots_in_interval` would make more sense as `number_of_roots_in_interval` (that's the naming convention used for most combinatorial statistics). And `has_all_real_roots` should probably be named `is_real_rooted`. Things that return a boolean almost always start with `is_`, and calling polynomials with all real roots "real rooted" is prevalent, at least in the literature that I read.
