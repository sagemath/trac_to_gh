Are you sure? What kind of numpy integers did you try?

```
sage: import numpy
sage: a = numpy.int8(10)
sage: b = numpy.int(5)
sage: isinstance(a, int)
False
sage: isinstance(b, int)
True
```

Both work:

```
sage: import numpy
sage: a = numpy.int8(4)
sage: rising_factorial(3, a)
360
sage: a = numpy.int(4)
sage: rising_factorial(3, a)
360
