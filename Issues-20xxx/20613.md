This branch implements coercion from LaurentPolynomialRings to Symbolic Ring.

```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = x+1/x
sage: f
x^-1 + x
sage: g = SR(f)
sage: g.fac
g.factor              g.factor_list         g.factorial           g.factorial_simplify  
sage: g.factor()
(x^2 + 1)/x     
sage: g.coefficients()
[[1, -1], [1, 1]]

```
