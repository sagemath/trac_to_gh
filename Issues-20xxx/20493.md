This is reproducible:

```
sage: [random_matrix(GF(2), 25000, 25000).rank() for i in range(5)]
[19937, 19937, 19937, 19937, 19937]
```
A functionally equivalent computation:

```
sage: u = MatrixSpace(GF(2), 25000, 25000)(0)
sage: u.randomize()
sage: u.rank()
19937
```
The docstring of the `randomize` method provides a clue:

```
   TESTS:

   With the libc random number generator random(), we had problems
   where the ranks of all of these matrices would be the same (and
   they would all be far too low).  This verifies that the problem is
   gone, with Mersenne Twister:

      sage: MS2 = MatrixSpace(GF(2), 1000)
      sage: [MS2.random_element().rank() for i in range(5)]
      [999, 998, 1000, 999, 999]

```
So it seems that we simply kicked the can down the road, and now that we can compute ranks at this size easily using m4ri, we have found the can again. Volker Braun observed on sage-devel (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/gDGM6bRle0A) that the 19937 is probably somehow coming from the Mersenne Twister having a period of `2^19937 - 1`.

Note that the linear dependence caused by insufficiently pseudorandom number generation is quite fragile:

```
sage: u = MatrixSpace(GF(2), 25000, 25000)(0)
sage: u.randomize(density=0.99)
sage: u.rank()
25000
sage: u = random_matrix(GF(101), 25000, 25000)
sage: u1 = u.change_ring(ZZ)
sage: u2 = u1.change_ring(GF(2))
sage: u2.rank()
24999
```

The relevant code fragment from `sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense.Matrix_mod2_dense.randomize` appears to be:

```
assert(sizeof(m4ri_word) == 8)
mask = __M4RI_LEFT_BITMASK(self._entries.ncols % m4ri_radix)
for i from 0 <= i < self._nrows:
    for j from 0 <= j < self._entries.width:
        # for portability we get 32-bit twice rather than 64-bit once
        low = gmp_urandomb_ui(rstate.gmp_state, 32)
        high = gmp_urandomb_ui(rstate.gmp_state, 32)
        self._entries.rows[i][j] = m4ri_swap_bits( ((<unsigned long long>high)<<32) | (<unsigned long long>low) )
    self._entries.rows[i][self._entries.width - 1] &= mask

sage: [random_matrix(GF(2), 19937, 19937).rank() for i in range(5)]
[19906, 19906, 19906, 19906, 19906]
sage: [random_matrix(GF(2), 19936, 19936).rank() for i in range(5)]
[19905, 19905, 19905, 19905, 19905]
```
and only 19905 appears for all the tries I did for 19937>n>19905.
So here the rank is off by 2<sup>5</sup>-1.
It seems to get sane for n<19906.

```
sage: [random_matrix(GF(2), 19905, 19905).rank() for i in range(5)]
[19904, 19903, 19904, 19904, 19902]
sage: [random_matrix(GF(2), 19904, 19904).rank() for i in range(5)]
[19903, 19904, 19903, 19903, 19902]
```

Definitely something funny with the Mersenne twister...

If I understand correctly how linear pseudorandom number generators work, the Mersenne twister is computing iterates of a linear operator on `F_2^19937` which acts as a permutation of this space, and the values we see coming out of gmp are the result of applying some fixed linear projection from `F_2^19937` to `F_2^32`. Since we're simply filling those bits directly into the matrix, that limits the rank to 19937.

In order to break out of this, we need to do something nonlinear with the gmp-provided bits...
