This is reproducible:

```
sage: [random_matrix(GF(2), 25000, 25000).rank() for i in range(5)]
[19937, 19937, 19937, 19937, 19937]
```
A functionally equivalent computation:

```
sage: u = MatrixSpace(GF(2), 25000, 25000)(0)
sage: u.randomize()
sage: u.rank()
19937
```
The docstring of the `randomize` method provides a clue:

```
   TESTS:

   With the libc random number generator random(), we had problems
   where the ranks of all of these matrices would be the same (and
   they would all be far too low).  This verifies that the problem is
   gone, with Mersenne Twister:

      sage: MS2 = MatrixSpace(GF(2), 1000)
      sage: [MS2.random_element().rank() for i in range(5)]
      [999, 998, 1000, 999, 999]

```
So it seems that we simply kicked the can down the road, and now that we can compute ranks at this size easily using m4ri, we have found the can again. Volker Braun observed on sage-devel (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/gDGM6bRle0A) that the 19937 is probably somehow coming from the Mersenne Twister having a period of `2^19937 - 1`.

Note that the linear dependence caused by insufficiently pseudorandom number generation is quite fragile:

```
sage: u = MatrixSpace(GF(2), 25000, 25000)(0)
sage: u.randomize(density=0.99)
sage: u.rank()
25000
sage: u = random_matrix(GF(101), 25000, 25000)
sage: u1 = u.change_ring(ZZ)
sage: u2 = u1.change_ring(GF(2))
sage: u2.rank()
24999
```

```
sage: [random_matrix(GF(2), 19937, 19937).rank() for i in range(5)]
[19906, 19906, 19906, 19906, 19906]
sage: [random_matrix(GF(2), 19936, 19936).rank() for i in range(5)]
[19905, 19905, 19905, 19905, 19905]
```
and only 19905 appears for all the tries I did for 19937>n>19905.
So here the rank is off by 2<sup>5</sup>-1.
It seems to get sane for n<19906.

```
sage: [random_matrix(GF(2), 19905, 19905).rank() for i in range(5)]
[19904, 19903, 19904, 19904, 19902]
sage: [random_matrix(GF(2), 19904, 19904).rank() for i in range(5)]
[19903, 19904, 19903, 19903, 19902]
```

Definitely something funny with the Mersenne twister...

In order to break out of this, we need to do something nonlinear with the gmp-provided bits...
