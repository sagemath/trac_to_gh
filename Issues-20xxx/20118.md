The file `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/thematic_tutorials/index.html` contains

```

<h2>Number Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#number-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">

```

Note the reference to the p-adic tutorial which has an absolute path, which used to be relative in sage-7.1.beta2. This breaks the sagenb live documentation.
