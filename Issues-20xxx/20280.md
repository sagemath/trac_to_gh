<a id='comment:5'></a>A few comments:

- Can you put a line break in the `See the docstrings...` sentence?
- Why does `Minimog` need to inherit from `SageObject`? Can't it just inherit from `object` to be a new-style (Python) class?
- Should we (I am willing to do these too) also do the following:
  - Make the error message start with a lowercase letter and not end in a period.
  - Put some of the module level doc into latex/code formatting.
  - Cleanup the code of `print_kitten`.

Sorry about that. Otherwise changes seems to be good, but I don't know about those `import`s. Actually I know quite small part of Sage.

<a id='comment:11'></a>I've done a little bit more cleanup of the file.

In regards to comment:7, this is not imported to the global namespace and having it appear in the doc is not necessarily a bad thing.

If you agree with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
