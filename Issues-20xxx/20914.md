Debian has patches for 4.8.6 update of libgap and gap, see
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-packaging/O2PAsuAELMA/vKCdnu3RBAAJ

so we just should take them. Due to miscommunication with the Debian people, I only found out by chance, as I saw them asking what a GAP-related Sage doctest would output for GAP 4.8.6 in place of 4.8.3 :-)

It is safe to omit this call. In fact,
`gap_reset_workspace()` needs some work. It has not really been touched in 5 years,
and it hangs on me now and then.
I do not want to do it on this ticket - it has been iffy for a while already.

It is not a problem not to have that call in `spkg-install`.
It merely means that  some later GAP startup will be slower, once.
(And yes we will look at it in #22244)
By the way, there is no such call in `spkg-install` of `gap_packages`.

Just 2 cents in case this helps the debugging: this group wraps an
infinite gap matrix group.

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(["A",3,1])
sage: W.generators()
(
[-1  1  0  1]  [ 1  0  0  0]  [ 1  0  0  0]  [ 1  0  0  0]
[ 0  1  0  0]  [ 1 -1  1  0]  [ 0  1  0  0]  [ 0  1  0  0]
[ 0  0  1  0]  [ 0  0  1  0]  [ 0  1 -1  1]  [ 0  0  1  0]
[ 0  0  0  1], [ 0  0  0  1], [ 0  0  0  1], [ 1  0  1 -1]
)
sage: W._gap_()
<matrix group with 4 generators>
sage: W._gap_().GeneratorsOfGroup()
[ [ [ -1, 1, 0, 1 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ], [ [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 1, -1, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ], [ [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, -1, 1 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ], [ [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0, 1, -1 ] ] ]
```

The gap matrix group can be constructed with:

```
gap> G := Group([ [ [ -1, 1, 0, 1 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ], [ [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 1, -1, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ], [ [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, -1, 1 ], [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ], [ [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ], [ 1, 0, 1, -1 ] ] ])
```

I am a bit confused by the call of the "Enumerator" gap function,
since the Sage sources seem to contain no reference to it (although I
do not have the very latest develop under hand).

But what exactly is `TestSuite()` calling?
Is there a way to trace this up? In the log above there is `line 949, in _test_enumerated_set_contains` so it looks as if some kind of enumeration is attempted.

anyways, GAP's `Enumerator` does not apply to infinite objects, and it was never possible.

I am trying to run 

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(["A",3,1])
sage: sage: W._test_enumerated_set_contains()
```
but it just never finishes (other `._test_`-things seem to run fine). Is it the real bug here?
How does one find out what actually is called here?

My guess is there is not a way for iterating through infinite matrix groups by using a finite set of specified generators using GAP. This does not work in 7.6.beta1:

```sage
sage: G = GL(6, ZZ)
sage: it = iter(G)
sage: [it.next() for _ in range(6)]
```
although it should because

```sage
sage: G.gens()
(
[0 1 0 0 0 0]  [0 1 0 0 0 0]  [-1  0  0  0  0  0]  [1 1 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 1 0 0 0]  [1 0 0 0 0 0]  [ 0  1  0  0  0  0]  [0 1 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 1 0 0]  [0 0 1 0 0 0]  [ 0  0  1  0  0  0]  [0 0 1 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 1 0]  [0 0 0 1 0 0]  [ 0  0  0  1  0  0]  [0 0 0 1 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 1]  [0 0 0 0 1 0]  [ 0  0  0  0  1  0]  [0 0 0 0 1 0]
[1 0 0 0 0 0], [0 0 0 0 0 1], [ 0  0  0  0  0  1], [0 0 0 0 0 1]
)
```
Does that work here?
However, we have the category `FinitelyGeneratedSemigroups`, which contains a default implementation of such an iterator using `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`.

In the case at hand `WeylGroups` is a subcategory of `FinitelyGeneratedSemigroups` (which is a subcategory of `EnumeratedSets`), so I suspect what is missing is for the generic (GAP) group iterator to lift the iteration up to the category if it doesn't know how to iterate directly in GAP.

In this case, I believe it is calling `_test_enumerated_set_contains` as defined in `categories/enumerated_sets.py`. That method has a loop which starts with `for w in self:`. For the group in question, the iterator can't be constructed.

I believe this invokes `W.__iter__`, right?
And the latter is in `sage/groups/libgap_mixin.py` (cf. `W.__iter__??`)
So this is merely calling `self.gap().Iterator()`. And the latter does not actually work in Sage 7.5; one gets 

```
ValueError: libGAP: Error, no method found! Error, no 3rd choice method found for `Enumerator' on 1 arguments
```
whereas with the branch here it does "work" - it runs out of memory...

That is, I believe that the category framework (or something like this) does try to call that `W.__iter__`, and upon failing (with the old GAP) actually does something that makes sense, namely `sage/groups/matrix_gps/matrix_group.py` has the lines

```
if not self.is_finite():
    # use implementation from category framework
    for g in super(Group, self).__iter__():
          yield g
    return
```
where the code in `sage/categories/coxeter_group.py` is called to do the right thing.


Whereas with the new GAP one does not get a `ValueError` and proceeds with running out of memory (actual running done  by GAP).

So, somewhere, something must forbid this execution path, but I don't know where and how. All help is welcome. If the fix is not going to happen in GAP-related
code, I'd be inclined to press ahead with this ticket, declaring this issue a known (Sage) bug.

I would suspect this is a GAP problem by trying to put the entire (matrix) group into memory as a list under an assumption that it is a finite group. Well, our `RecursiveEnumeratedSet` iterator runs into the same problem, but it will at least output things along the way...

It's actually the reverse that happens: code in the categories is the last called in the MRO. In particular, the first call is to the lines copied above, and for non-finite groups (or at least those not known to be finite), then call up to the corresponding `__iter__` implemented in the category (if there is one).

See [comment:29](#comment:29) for why it used to work for Weyl groups.

> Whereas with the new GAP one does not get a `ValueError` and proceeds with running out of memory (actual running done  by GAP).

You deleted the code above that would call up to the category framework, where it was not using GAP to do the iteration.

You probably need to restore part of the `__iter__`, specifically the code quoted above.

TL;DR - As [John said](#comment:34), the problem is removing `__iter__` from `sage/groups/matrix_groups/matrix_group.py`.

The category iterator is not just for Coxeter groups, but any group with a finite generating set. Have you run timings (and memory usage) comparing the GAP iterator with the one from the category?

At least for Coxeter groups, we can do a check on the rank if there is some cutoff point.

As far as I am concerned, this is not a bug, but a decision we made at some point to ship only the very minimal default GAP configuration.
As you most probably know, GAP assumes quite a few packages to be installed and autoloaded by default; this is patched away by 
​`ba1e2ae` "we don't have these packages installed by default"


Sage's GAP does not install `autpgrp` by default, and does not autoload it if it is available. Suppose it is available (i.e. `gap_packages` is installed); then
before running `GAP_ROOT/tst/testinstall.g` one has to load `autpgrp` manually.
I.e.

```
gap> LoadPackage("autpgrp");;
gap> Read("testinstall.g");
```
will make everything pass (on my system at least).
