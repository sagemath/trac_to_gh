```
R.<x> = QQ[]
W = DifferentialWeylAlgebra(R)
W.inject_variables()
latex(x*dx)
```

produces 

```
Defining x, dx
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}

Replying to [@vit-tucek](#comment%3A3):

IIRC, it had to do with the spacing. The `repr_from_monomials` was more of a clone of how polynomial rings printed their elements (of which, they do not currently outsource to a separate function), which had more spacing than `repr_lincomb`.

From looking at the code, your fix looks good. However I want to try to see if I can do some slight cleanup so it is easier to read before I set it to a positive review. (I will need a few days to do so.)
