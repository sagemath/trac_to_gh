<a id='comment:8'></a>The problem is that there are many equivalent definitions of the homfly polynomial. All of them are related by a change of variables.

The homfly program, which we adapted to libhomfly, uses the one where the variables are called `L` and `M`. There are at least other two definitions that use the variables `\alpha` and `z` and `x`, `y` and `z` respectively.

In particular, the first two variables are related by multiplying the variables by `I`, as you said.

It is true that we should clarify which are the coordinates we take.

<a id='comment:13'></a>According to [1], the isolated components case is a bit more complicated than just the sum of them. 

The formula is the product of the homfly polynomials times `-(L + L ^(-1)) * M^(-1)` raised to the number of components minus one.

Now I have to check which is the right change of variables for the other normalization.
