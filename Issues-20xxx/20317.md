This seems to be a problem of it inheriting the `cardinality` from `Permutations_mset`. The simple fix is to just have

```python
def cardinality(self):
    return len(self.list())
```
Or does anyone know of a easy-ish formula?

I don't understand why there are two classes at all. `Permutations_mset(ms)` is a shortcut for `Permutations_msetk(ms, len(ms))`.

Me neither. Replace shortcut by "the same mathematical set".

On the other hand `P_msetk` is a union of `P_mset` over the submultiset of fixed size.

> Or do you mean there should be? I think there should be 2 classes, as the general `Permutations_mset` can have faster iteration, a dedicated `cardinality` method, and easier/faster containment checking.

Adding a third class to "simplify" the inheritance!?

The `_k` suffix in the name of classes is very confusing:
- `Subsets_s(s)` is the union of the `Subsets_sk(s, k)`
- `Permutations_n(n)` is the same thing as `Permutations_nk(n, n)`
