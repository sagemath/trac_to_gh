<a id='comment:2'></a>I pushed a first version of my patch.

Known issues & remarks:

- Verbosity option is completely broken
- Scheduling in `task_master` method can be improved
- Code duplication (`_perform_experiments_for_single_id` and `_perform_parallel_experiments_for_single_id`. 
- Some names can probably be improved.

I'm leaving this in `new` state for now.
