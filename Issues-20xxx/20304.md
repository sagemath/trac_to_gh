<a id='comment:4'></a>Please use new style error `ValueError(msg)` instead of `ValueError, msg` (Python 3 compatibility).

Would be better to use repr rather than str. The output of `"{!r}".format(l)` is nicer than `str(l)`. As you can see

```
sage: l = 1
sage: str(l)
'1'
sage: "{!r}".format(l)
'1'
sage: l = '1'
sage: str(l)
'1'
sage: "{!r}".format(l)
"'1'"
```

The following are not caught correctly

```
sage: M1 = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: M2 = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = M1.new_variable()
sage: y = M1.new_variable()
sage: z = M2.new_variable()
sage: M2.add_constraint(z[0] <= 5)
sage: M2.solve()
0.0
sage: M2.get_values(x)              # should be a ValueError
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: x_0
sage: M2.get_values(y)              # should be a ValueError
{}
```
