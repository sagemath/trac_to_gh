The GLPK exact solver ignores `msg_lev` 
and prints a lot of things on the screen while solving (see tests in #20424). 

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="GLPK/exact")
sage: p.get_backend().set_verbosity(0)
sage: TestSuite(p.get_backend()).run(skip="_test_pickling")
glp_exact: 5 rows, 1 columns, 4 non-zeros
GNU MP bignum library is being used

another example.

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="GLPK/exact")

However, it's not the only issue with this solver:

```
sage: for solver in ['Cplex', 'Gurobi', 'Coin', 'PPL', 'GLPK']:
....:     p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver=solver)
....:     _ = p.solve()
....:     
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="GLPK/exact")
sage: p.solve()
glp_exact: problem has no rows/columns
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MIPSolverException                        Traceback (most recent call last)
...
MIPSolverException: GLPK: Solver failure
```

We also have this with another solver...

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="CVXOPT")
sage: p.solve()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

I think it is an upstream bug that should be fixed.

The problem is not in our sage code.
