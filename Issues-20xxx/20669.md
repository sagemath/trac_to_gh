Maximun recursion limit is 999 by default, and that is too small only if we have a `ChainPoset(n)` with `n > 999`; recursion stack will have at most as many steps as the lattice has elements. And it will have `2^999` sublattices anyway, so this is not valid argument.

People could want to do some partial tests on some really big example of a lattice or wanted to run a month-long-type computation on a big lattice (of which, there are a number of examples of finite exceptional cases that I come across in my research where the easiest way to prove things can be to do long computations).

I have no inherent objects to this, but does the static sparse digraph code have the capacity to do the meet and joins?

However, meet and join doesn't quite make sense to have it there mathematically AFAIK. Although by cythonizing `hasse_diagram.py`, we should get most of possible speed without doing really much in the way of changes.

I don't see anything that would prevent a cythonization; the `HasseDiagram` class only has single inheritance (and cython probably has improved since when you discussed this).

I don't think we are in an open-ended discussion because I am proposing a (single) concrete/explicit alternative implementation. While I am not strictly opposed to the current implementation, I think there is a relatively easy way to improve it. I might have some time to change the algorithm today, if you're okay with it (I'm on French time for this week and the next).
