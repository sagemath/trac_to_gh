I think you should use a backtracking algorithm instead of a recursion. It will be faster (and you don't have to constantly get things like `self.cardinality()`), never run up against the Python maximum recursion limit, and have better input (which `set()` and `0` should be defaults anyways).

People could want to do some partial tests on some really big example of a lattice or wanted to run a month-long-type computation on a big lattice (of which, there are a number of examples of finite exceptional cases that I come across in my research where the easiest way to prove things can be to do long computations).

I have no inherent objects to this, but does the static sparse digraph code have the capacity to do the meet and joins?

True, but I think that there was obstackle for cythonizing. Something with inheritance, I think; I discussed about this with Nathann Cohen maybe a two years ago.

Sorry. I don't intend to insult. (But also I does not so much english words to make my expressions smoother.)

I was just trying to say what developer guide says: "Please refrain from additional feature requests or open-ended discussion about alternative implementations."

I know you didn't, but it first seemed like you were trying to tell me how to review this. My reply was condescending, to which I apologize as well.

> I was just trying to say what developer guide says: "Please refrain from additional feature requests or open-ended discussion about alternative implementations."

I don't think we are in an open-ended discussion because I am proposing a (single) concrete/explicit alternative implementation. While I am not strictly opposed to the current implementation, I think there is a relatively easy way to improve it. I might have some time to change the algorithm today, if you're okay with it (I'm on French time for this week and the next).

Of course. I can review it then, and hopefully you can check docstrings I wrote.

Btw, I plan to add `lattice_of_sublattices()`. Hence the function in `hasse_diagram.py` should return something like sets, tuples etc.
