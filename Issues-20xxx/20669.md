I think you should use a backtracking algorithm instead of a recursion. It will be faster (and you don't have to constantly get things like `self.cardinality()`), never run up against the Python maximum recursion limit, and have better input (which `set()` and `0` should be defaults anyways).

Maximun recursion limit is 999 by default, and that is too small only if we have a `ChainPoset(n)` with `n > 999`; recursion stack will have at most as many steps as the lattice has elements. And it will have `2^999` sublattices anyway, so this is not valid argument.

People could want to do some partial tests on some really big example of a lattice or wanted to run a month-long-type computation on a big lattice (of which, there are a number of examples of finite exceptional cases that I come across in my research where the easiest way to prove things can be to do long computations).

I have no inherent objects to this, but does the static sparse digraph code have the capacity to do the meet and joins?

No, but that could be added. Or actually copied from current file. For Frattini sublattices that would actually make sense.

However, meet and join doesn't quite make sense to have it there mathematically AFAIK. Although by cythonizing `hasse_diagram.py`, we should get most of possible speed without doing really much in the way of changes.

I am going to treat this as you telling me *your* process for reviewing. Otherwise I would take that a very insulting comment to me which you are telling me how to do *my* review.

True, but I think that there was obstackle for cythonizing. Something with inheritance, I think; I discussed about this with Nathann Cohen maybe a two years ago.

Sorry. I don't intend to insult. (But also I does not so much english words to make my expressions smoother.)

I was just trying to say what developer guide says: "Please refrain from additional feature requests or open-ended discussion about alternative implementations."

I don't see anything that would prevent a cythonization; the `HasseDiagram` class only has single inheritance (and cython probably has improved since when you discussed this).

I know you didn't, but it first seemed like you were trying to tell me how to review this. My reply was condescending, to which I apologize as well.

I don't think we are in an open-ended discussion because I am proposing a (single) concrete/explicit alternative implementation. While I am not strictly opposed to the current implementation, I think there is a relatively easy way to improve it. I might have some time to change the algorithm today, if you're okay with it (I'm on French time for this week and the next).

Of course. I can review it then, and hopefully you can check docstrings I wrote.

Btw, I plan to add `lattice_of_sublattices()`. Hence the function in `hasse_diagram.py` should return something like sets, tuples etc.
