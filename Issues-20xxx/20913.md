This fixes a long-standing issue where if Sage is built on a system without OpenSSL support, doing anything with pip will result in it crashing.

This allows pip to work without SSL support.  Its functionality is *limited*--i.e. it can't download anything from PyPI without SSL.  But it does have appropriate error-handling in this case, an can still be used to install local packages fine.

This was originally part of #20218 but I am breaking it out to a separate ticket as requested.
