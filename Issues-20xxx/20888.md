Defining a LaTeX print function (instead of just a latex name) is only possible for `GinacFunction`s by changing Pynac.

I think it would be more consistent to simply allow the same mechanism as with `BuiltinFunction`s. This should pose no problem, since there it is already channeled through Pynac. Effectively, if there is not a LaTeX print function defined in Pynac then the Python `_print_latex_` member should be tried.
