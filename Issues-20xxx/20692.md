This adds a new script to `build/bin` called `sage-apply-patches` which implements the same code that is copy/pasted through many of the `spkg-install` scripts (albeit often inconsistently). The patches in `build/pkgs/PKGNAME/patches` are now applied automatically.

I'm not attached to any of the details of how the script works--the implementation was designed mostly to make it easiest to automatically replace the existing repeated code snippet with minimal effort.

Seems I have to undust my `bash` scripting skills...

Why is it an error if there are no patches to apply? I would remove

```
if [[ -r "${patches[0]}" ]]; then
else
    >&2 echo "No patch files found in $patchdir"
    exit 1
fi
```
and just apply all patches, which may be the empty set.

I figured maybe there was a reason to prefer to keep backups in general.  Would be fine with me to apply in general though.  Previously there was one other case where additional arguments had to be passed to `patch`, but then I realized that package had no patches anymore.

> I don't get this:

Meaning the patches are applied after `cd`-ing into the upstream source, hence the default path to search for patches being `../patches`.  No reason it has to be that way but it was the most minimal change from the existing code.

Well, that's essentially what I wrote in [comment:7].

And yes, I feel strongly about because I don't want to always add/remove the call to `spkg-apply-patches` depending on whether or not the number of patches to apply equals zero.

Detail: for consistency, I would prefer the script to be called `spkg-apply-patches` instead of `sage-apply-patches`.

P.S.:  The main problem to that time was that (legacy) spkgs didn't depend on the Sage version, so we would have had to add fall-backs first (if the script to source from wasn't available).

Error-handling (i.e., the messages) is another thing that should be standardized.

I think earlier, before #20837, it was more necessary to have separate arguments.  But I still kind of like it as is.

The assumption here is that there is a standard root for patches to a package with *may* have subdirectories.  The reason it's useful to have separate arguments is that `spkg-install` scripts don't need to care where the patch root is, but sometimes it's useful to select subdirectories within it from which to apply other patches.

I'm open to other ideas though.

(FWIW if I were to choose one to remove it would be `patch-dir` since now it's not used.)

I fixed a minor bikeshed: I prefer no newline after `./configure` in

```
./configure ...

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    ...
fi
```
It makes it more clear that the `if` really belongs with the `./configure`.

I don't know if you intentionally added a newline there in `build/pkgs/cysignals/spkg-install`, but I removed it now. I also squashed the commits together.
