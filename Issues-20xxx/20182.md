Many doctests depend on softwares external to Sage (including "internet") available on the system, such as latex, magma, mathematica, maple, etc. This patch allows to run the optional doctests for the softwares available.

With the patch,

"sage -t --optional=PKGS": only run doctests including one of the "# optional - xxx" tags where xxx is listed in         PKGS; 
    if "sage" is listed, will also run the standard doctests;
    if "optional" is listed, will also run tests for installed optional (new-style) packages;
    if "external" is listed, will also run tests for available external softwares;
    if set to "all", then all tests will be run

This is a rewrite of #18904 and #13540.

Currently doctests for Sage optional packages, if installed on the system, are automatically run only if "--optional" is given. Doctests for nonpackages are run only if "--optional=nonpackages" is given. Perhaps we should keep this ability because of the performance issues that you mention...

The behavior "--optional" tag has changed after the merged ticket: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18558, but the developer's manual seems not updated completely to reflect the changes. The following is from experiments and the documentation. So would you verify my understanding?

(1) "-t" : tests all ordinary doctests and also doctests about installed optional packages, in effect equivalent to "-t --optional=optional".
(2) "-t --optional": no-op
(3) "-t --optional=PKGS":   only run doctests including one of the "# optional - xxx" tags where xxx is listed in PKGS; 
                                     if "sage" is listed will also test the standard doctests; 
                                     if "optional" is listed will also test all available(installed) optional packages; 
                                     if set to "all", then all tests will be run; 
If this is correct, then

(A)  Via this ticket I want to add one more line to (3):

                                    if "external" is listed, then also include all doctests  with "# optional - xxx" where xxx is an available external softwares and resources like "magma", "matlab", "internet", "latex", etc (basically everything that is not a Sage standard or optional package).

(B) Also we can change (1) to equate "-t" to "-t --optional=optional,external".

Do you agree?

Agree. We definitely need to implement a lazy mechanism like that in #13540. I am reading the related codes in Sage.

Once we implement "external", "all" will mean "sage"+"optional"+"external". Then we may set "-t --optional" to mean "-t --optional=all".

For this ticket, I will stop at providing the framework for tests requiring external softwares.  Thus

(1) Any expert is cordially invited to contribute commits for better and new `has_xxx` tester for the software `xxx`.

(2) Turning on `external` by default should be dealt with in another ticket.

(3) Fixing all doctest failures that result from changing the default should be dealt with separate tickets.

What should happen with failing doctests? klee's opinion is that they should be fixed on another ticket. I guess that's okay as long as they are not run by default. Anyone else have opinions? 

For example:

```
sage -t src/sage/plot/graphics.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/plot/graphics.py", line 1624, in sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.show
Failed example:
    plot(x, typeset='latex') # optional - latex
Expected nothing
Got:
    Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/plot/graphics.py", line 1630, in sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.show
Failed example:
    plot(x, typeset='type1') # optional - latex
Expected nothing
Got:
    Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   2 of  87 in sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.show
```
I get this at the end of `make ptestall`:

```
