Many doctests depend on softwares external to Sage (including "internet") available on the system, such as latex, magma, mathematica, maple, etc. This patch allows to run the optional doctests for the softwares available.

With the patch,

"sage -t --optional=PKGS": only run doctests including one of the "# optional - xxx" tags where xxx is listed in         PKGS; 
    if "sage" is listed, will also run the standard doctests;
    if "optional" is listed, will also run tests for installed optional (new-style) packages;
    if "external" is listed, will also run tests for available external softwares;
    if set to "all", then all tests will be run

This is a rewrite of #18904 and #13540.

Currently doctests for Sage optional packages, if installed on the system, are automatically run only if "--optional" is given. Doctests for nonpackages are run only if "--optional=nonpackages" is given. Perhaps we should keep this ability because of the performance issues that you mention...

<a id='comment:17'></a>The behavior "--optional" tag has changed after the merged ticket: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18558, but the developer's manual seems not updated completely to reflect the changes. The following is from experiments and the documentation. So would you verify my understanding?

(1) "-t" : tests all ordinary doctests and also doctests about installed optional packages, in effect equivalent to "-t --optional=optional".
(2) "-t --optional": no-op
(3) "-t --optional=PKGS":   only run doctests including one of the "# optional - xxx" tags where xxx is listed in PKGS; 
                                     if "sage" is listed will also test the standard doctests; 
                                     if "optional" is listed will also test all available(installed) optional packages; 
                                     if set to "all", then all tests will be run; 
If this is correct, then

(A)  Via this ticket I want to add one more line to (3):

                                    if "external" is listed, then also include all doctests  with "# optional - xxx" where xxx is an available external softwares and resources like "magma", "matlab", "internet", "latex", etc (basically everything that is not a Sage standard or optional package).

(B) Also we can change (1) to equate "-t" to "-t --optional=optional,external".

Do you agree?

Agree. We definitely need to implement a lazy mechanism like that in #13540. I am reading the related codes in Sage.

Once we implement "external", "all" will mean "sage"+"optional"+"external". Then we may set "-t --optional" to mean "-t --optional=all".

Hmmm. It seems possible... But what do you think it means that "maple" appears in the list? Does it mean that maple is available and tests depending on it will be tested. This behavior defeats the lazy mechanism. Does it simply mean that any doctests depending on maple will run if maple turns out to be available lazily and not otherwise? Then this is very different from an optional package, say gcc or mpir, appearing in the list.

I agree. Perhaps we can list the detected softwares at the end of doctesting as you suggested.

<a id='comment:45'></a>> Also, I'm getting a lot of failed `internet` doctests, and some for `latex`, too. If we enable testing those by default, Sage won't pass doctests anymore. They need to be fixed: on separate tickets?


Yes.  Like #16302.  Are the ones (OEIS) in #16252 at least still fixed?

For this ticket, I will stop at providing the framework for tests requiring external softwares.  Thus

(1) Any expert is cordially invited to contribute commits for better and new `has_xxx` tester for the software `xxx`.

(2) Turning on `external` by default should be dealt with in another ticket.

(3) Fixing all doctest failures that result from changing the default should be dealt with separate tickets.
