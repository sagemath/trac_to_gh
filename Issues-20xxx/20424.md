Split out from #20323.

This patch adds new _test methods for `add_col`, `solve`, and for #18572 (but disabled for CVXOPT, where it fails). 
To make the new test methods happy, 
- implement `add_col` for Gurobi;
- fix the implementation of `add_col` for COIN;
- fix Gurobi's treatment of unbounded variables; 
- fix CPLEX unboundedness detection.

If anyone at all cares about the CVXOPT backend, perhaps they could fix it?


From dimpase:
 I recall asking how one deals with different backends producing different, albeit equivalent, outputs. E.g. some of  them would even introduce extra variables for some constraints (see e.g. ​   http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13148#comment:2). Some backends assign names to constraints automatically.

+If anyone at all cares about the CVXOPT backend, perhaps they could fix it?
+
+
+From dimpase:
+ I recall asking how one deals with different backends producing different, albeit equivalent, outputs. E.g. some of  them would even introduce extra variables for some constraints (see e.g. ​   http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13148#comment:2). Some backends assign names to constraints automatically.

Are there any plans to support this for other backends? I noticed that it's not even documented in `add_variable.__doc__` for the Gurobi backend.

The interface between backends should be consistent, so even just `raise NotImplementedError("the foo backend does not support the 'coefficients' argument")` in other backends would be good to have. What do you think?

Yes, there is a plan, see #20324.
