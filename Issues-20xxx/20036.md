<a id='comment:3'></a>Helloooooooo !

Looks good.

Could you add a link toward the wikipedia page (using the `:wikipedia:` role), which provides a longer description of this polytope? 

Could you also add a reference toward the place where you obtained the coordinates of the vertices?

In all other constructors of the file, it seems that 'exact=True' is the default. Here, building the polytope on an exact ring takes around 11s on my computer. Vincent, what do you think? Break the 'exact=True' standard or make it slow by default, and fast upon request?

Finally, it's probably a question of style but you could first import 'product' from itertools, then only call 'product'. But well, that's style, do whatever you prefer.

Thanks,

Nathann

<a id='comment:9'></a>Helloooooo Nico,

My apologies for having been rather slow to answer during the last days. I was on the moves with only my phone to read emails, and it was hard to do anything Sage-related.

Thank you for the modifications you made to the code. I would say that a doctest that takes 15 seconds to run is too long, especially if we can "almost test it" by other means, i.e. with non-exact coordinates. So it is fine for me to not test the `exact=True` branch.

About the default value: it is true that the 600-cells is already by default in `exact=False` so, well, as this polytope is related to it I guess that it is fine if you prefer to keep an `exact=False` there. There is certainly some sense to it.

My last remark is about the reference you added: it looks odd, as a 'reference' entry usually contains additional details like title/author or something. You can either improve the entry you added or, if you only want to link toward some web page, merely add a link in the documentation.

Note that you can turn any text into a link with Sphinx, in case you do not want the URL to appear in the doc:

    http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/sage_manuals.html#hyperlinks

Good evening,

Nathann

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hi Nathann

I have absolutely no complaint about the speed with which you reply. :-)

I will fix the reference later today (Currently also in transit). The last two years I have had little time, and have only contributed to Sage intermittently and only when I needed something for myself (like this grand antiprism). Unfortunately this has meant that I keep having a bad mental picture of the style of code and documentation.

Cheers
