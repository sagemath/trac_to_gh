<a id='comment:2'></a>A few remarks/questions:

* In the docstrings of `dispersion_set` and `dispersion` you have an inconsistency between  `p,q` and `f,g`:

```     
The dispersion set of `p` and `q` is the set of nonnegative integers
`n` such that `f(x + n)` and `g(x)` have a nonconstant common factor.
```

* It may be useful to mention that when the dispersion set is empty, the dispersion you return is `-Infinity`. There is an example of the behavior, but you may add it in the text.

* You use `assert` twice: Is there an example where the assertion does not hold? If this is the case, it may be interesting to have a more meaningful error message.

* In the first line of dispersion_set, you use a possibly useless coercion. You may change this line to (I was not sure about the syntax but it seems to work):

```python
other = self if other is None else other if other in self._parent else self._parent.coerce(other)

Thanks, I will fix that.

Since there is nothing really surprising about that return value, I'd prefer keeping just the example. But please feel free to insist if you disagree.

> * You use `assert` twice: Is there an example where the assertion does not hold? If this is the case, it may be interesting to have a more meaningful error message.

I don't know if there is such an example. Since this is a generic implementation, I'd rather be on the safe side. And if you are concerned with the performance penalty, you can always run python with assertions disabled...

As far as I understand, your version is not equivalent to mine (`QQ(1) in ZZ` holds), and actually does more work: `in` alone will perform a conversion and a coercion, or something like that.

You only fixed the first typo...

It was more a matter of clarity. Again, I do not have a strong opinion...

Right, I did not write it correctly. What I meant:

```python
other = self if other is None else other if other._parent is self._parent else self._parent.coerce(other)
```
That way, I guess that my version is completely equivalent to yours and (slightly) faster. I may be stuttering but I still don't have a strong opinion on whether you should change your code...
