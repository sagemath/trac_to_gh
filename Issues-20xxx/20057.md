I just realize the oneliner for `__iter__` is

```
    return self.root_to_elements_dict().itervalues()
```
and not

```
    return self.root_to_elements_dict().iterkeys()
```
Indeed, we also need to decide what to iterate on...

I want to make a function computing congruence of a (finite) lattice generated by some element sets. The result is splitting of elements to sets, i.e. exactly disjoint union. Hence `DisjointUnion` feels natural choise. The code basically iterates "elements `a` and `b` must belong to same equivalnce class, so combine set containing `a` and set containing `b`."

If I understood right, there is no way to make a fast iteration of values possible; the whole idea of this data structure is to avoid moving data in memory so that iterating would become fast.

I think that `itervalues()` and not `iterkeys()` is the right solution, if we are going to make this. There is basically no "roots" in mathematical sense in disjoint union. So the question is about "expected to be efficient". I would vote against it: we can make a slow iterator.

Thanks for allowing the discussion.

You are right. I agree. Also `iterkeys()` is not well defined as the chosen roots might be different depending on the computer.

Ok. So, let `__iter__()` return `self.root_to_elements_dict().itervalues()` then. I don't think there is much improvement we can do by avoiding the creation of the root to elements dict.

Positive review then :)
