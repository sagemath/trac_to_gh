brial doesn't build on Cygwin due to some inconsistency of how `__STRICT_ANSI__` is handled by C++ on Cygwin.  Changing `-std=c++98` to `-std=gnu++98` works around this behavior--I don't think there's any reason brial *must* be build with strict ANSI C++.

Nevertheless this is an issue more with Cygwin than anything else.
I don't know if this has been reported upstream to Cygwin but it seems to be a very old issue.  Likewise it would be good if a workaround were upstreamed to brial.

Copy/pasted from jpflori's comment at #17622:

The patches in build_system directory are those you need to apply to the brial build system before autotools automatically generate the full build system.
Once these patches are applied, one can invoke autotools to update the build system and deduce the full patches in the patches directory which don't need autotools invokation anymore and can be applied at build time.


To summarize it's good to ship two set of patches because:

* we can't rely on invoking autotools at build time because it is not a prerequisite and would not be manageable anyway, it's kind of impossible to make sure that the build system will be correctly regenarated with one of the random versions of autotools programs in the wild, therefore the build system has to be regenerated on a dev machine and full patches have to be distributed,
  
* the patches only touching the input to autotools are still of interest as these are the ones to be updated manually if we want to introduce further changes in the build system, and the ones to submit upstream for inclusion (and when upstream makes new releases it will regenerate the full build system)

In general, to compile a program from source, you don't need autotools, just run `./configure` and `make`. This means its release manager will run autotools before releasing an official source tarball. 

Then this (official, already autotoolified) source tarball will be the sage source package, downloaded in the `upstream`directory. If some patches to this source package are needed for sage, they will be added just before build: the usual package installation process uncompresses the official source, incorporates the patches, then runs `./configure`, `make` and `make install`, with additional flags if necessary.

Which this patch, one created a dependence on automake. 
See https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/6Xg1RXXw-S0/nKaaeLdrDAAJ

This should not have happened!

No, I don't believe so.  

What I mean to say is, I don't think it has to do with this ticket.  If you scrutinize the patch it's just making some trivial modifications to some lines that already exist.

It's possible that if a new package for brial was built it wasn't done properly, but I don't know who does that.

The mere fact of applying a patch (whether or not it makes trivial modifications) is an important change. It affects timestamps of the patched files which can certainly influence whether automake is needed.

This is exactly what the patch does. The version in `/patches/build/` indicates the manual modification to configuration files (only `common.mk` needs to be changed), and the version in `/patches/` (the one that gets applied) includes both this manual modification and the subsequent changes to autogenerated files following from an autotools application.
