This patch will add an iterator over orthocomplements of the Hasse diagram of a lattice. (Part 2 will be interface in `lattices.py`.)

This was somewhat untrivial to do, hence so much tests.

More logical place would be in "interface part" in `lattices.py`, I think.

> * Correction to corner cases has a typo (ortohocomplement).


OK, I'll correct that.

> * This seems to be assuming that the elements of your poset are the integers 1...n . Even if constructing the Hasse diagram ends up assigning a labeling to the elements so the code works, it won't be clear to the user what the output has to do with their original lattice.


Again, this should be on interface part (#20817). I think that we must assume that a user reading docs for internal class like `HasseDiagram` mostly knows what to do.

> * Orthocomplementations are only defined on complemented lattices. I'm not sure if `is_complemented_lattice()` exists or is computationally feasible (TODO?).


We do have `is_complemented` at `lattices.py`, and it is just `O(n^2)` after computing the meets and joins (which is `O(n^2.5)`. But this function detects non-complemented lattices indirectly. (Btw, the code for complements is broken at corner case, see #20727.)
