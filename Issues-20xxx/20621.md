Calling `Sequence(elts, universe=...)` can be a good way to typecheck and normalize a list of elements passed to a Sage function, but this sometimes leads to hard to understand errors when one of the conversion fails. We try to provide a better default error message (at the cost of losing part of the backtrace until we have exception chaining).
