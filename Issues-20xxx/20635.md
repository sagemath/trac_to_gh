<a id='comment:5'></a>Please check `modabvar.rst`:

```
-    sage: for x in R.gens(): print x.matrix(),'\n'
+    sage: for x in R.gens():
+    ....:     print(x.matrix())
```

I think that you missed one `\n`. It is OK, if you did that on purpose.

Also are these equivalent:

```
-                print u,v,find_reflection(u,v)
+                print((u,v,find_reflection(u,v)))
```

I think that the latter one will print a tuple, first one noe.

This has no error but I don't like mixing explicit print and implicit printing of last return value in

```
print("An order two subgroup:"); sg[1].list()
```
