Replace

```
cpdef ModuleElement _add_(left, ModuleElement right)
```
by

```
cpdef _add_(left, ModuleElement right)
```
and similar. The return type serves no purpose:
1. if you really do need any information of the return type, then something like `ModuleElement` is too generic anyway.
2. it forces Cython to add some checks that the returned value is of the correct type, so it might actually slow down things.

Also remove the superfluous declarations of these methods in other `.pxd` files.

I'm not surprised. The overhead of these checks should be small compared to the actual operation.

Thanks for the review of this and related tickets.
