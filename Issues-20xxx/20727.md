There is a slight corner-case -error:

```
LatticePoset({1: []}).complements()
```

will give `{1: [1, 1]}`.

(I guess you mean lattice and not poset, even if it is easy to extend the definition to every bounded poset.)

It is said in `lattices.py` at function `complements()` already: Elements `x` and `y` are complements if their meet and join are respectively the bottom and the top element of the lattice.

In how many places should it be said? In `hasse_diagram.py`? In `is_complemented()`, `is_relatively_complemented()`, and maybe later in `is_sectionally_complemented()`? This is a real question, and I can see arguments for both directions.

This patch will do that. Althought I must admit that now `lattices.py` copies code from `hasse_diagram.py`, and that is not needed.

> For the other ones, I would include a line at the end of each linking to similar/relevant methods (ie, `is_complemented()` would have a line at the end saying `see: complements(), is_relatively_complemented(), etc.`.


True. I guess that #20940 will be last of this serie, so it is propably right place to add seealso-links. Before that I wait comment from Travis at #20972.

OK, I added the definition of complement directly to this function in `hasse_diagram.py`.

It feels good design to have "internals" in `hasse_diagram.py` and have "interface" at `posets.py` and `lattices.py`. But it means that some definitions and tests must be written twise, maybe with collisions (definitions of graded vs. ranked). Also some functions at `hasse_diagram.py` are only meaningfull for lattices.

Now we have `certificate`-option in `is_relatively_complemented()` and `is_sectionally_complemented()`. I think we should add the same to `is_complemented()`. But that's a task for another ticket.

You're forgetting the fact that by working in `HasseDiagram`, you can assume the vertices are `(0, 1, ..., n-1)` and that is a linear extension. I agree that we loose a small bit of clarity (and an extra Python function call) for the indirection, but we often gain much more speed and code simplicity by utilizing these assumptions. One way you can think of `Poset` is that it adds the extra layer of the element labels.

I think we can remove all references to the deprecation because this function is no longer broken AFAIK.

Hmm... There were no deprecations left in my code.

But anyway, I guess this can be thinked later. I changed this patch to only correct the corner case error and added tests for that.
