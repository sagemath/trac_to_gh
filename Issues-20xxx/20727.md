There is a slight corner-case -error:

```
LatticePoset({1: []}).complements()
```

will give `{1: [1, 1]}`.

(I guess you mean lattice and not poset, even if it is easy to extend the definition to every bounded poset.)

It is said in `lattices.py` at function `complements()` already: Elements `x` and `y` are complements if their meet and join are respectively the bottom and the top element of the lattice.

In how many places should it be said? In `hasse_diagram.py`? In `is_complemented()`, `is_relatively_complemented()`, and maybe later in `is_sectionally_complemented()`? This is a real question, and I can see arguments for both directions.

This patch will do that. Althought I must admit that now `lattices.py` copies code from `hasse_diagram.py`, and that is not needed.

> For the other ones, I would include a line at the end of each linking to similar/relevant methods (ie, `is_complemented()` would have a line at the end saying `see: complements(), is_relatively_complemented(), etc.`.


True. I guess that #20940 will be last of this serie, so it is propably right place to add seealso-links. Before that I wait comment from Travis at #20972.

<a id='comment:9'></a>OK, I added the definition of complement directly to this function in `hasse_diagram.py`.

It feels good design to have "internals" in `hasse_diagram.py` and have "interface" at `posets.py` and `lattices.py`. But it means that some definitions and tests must be written twise, maybe with collisions (definitions of graded vs. ranked). Also some functions at `hasse_diagram.py` are only meaningfull for lattices.

Now we have `certificate`-option in `is_relatively_complemented()` and `is_sectionally_complemented()`. I think we should add the same to `is_complemented()`. But that's a task for another ticket.
