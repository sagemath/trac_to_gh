What is the procedure to properly reinstall the sage notebook?

For reference I did

```
$ git checkout -b sagenb
$ git fetch trac u/jdemeyer/live_documentation_in_sage_notebook_is_broken
$ git merge FETCH_HEAD
$ make build
```
Doing the above the package is **not** reinstalled. It seems that the script is actually stopped after "cunningham_tables"

```
checking package versions...
