Residue sequences of tableaux are an important statistic, particularly in the non-semisimple and graded representation theories. This ticket implements two classes `ResidueSequence` and its parent class `ResidueSequences` for these sequences, In addition, it implements the Brundan-Kleshchev-Wang degree function on tableaux and tableaux tuples. In practice, these are all implemented as methods on tableaux and tableaux tuples:

```python
sage: StandardTableau([[1,2,3],[4,5]]).residue_sequence(3).standard_tableaux()
Standard tableaux of residue (0,1,2,2,0)
Tableau([[1,2,5],[3,4]]).degree(3)
0
sage: StandardTableauTuple([[[5]],[[1,2],[3,4]]]).residue_sequence(3,[0,0])
3-residue sequence (0,1,2,0,0) with multicharge (0,0)
sage: StandardTableauTuple([[[2,8],[7]],[[1,4,6],[3,5]]]).degree(0,(0,1))
1
```
As an added bonus, we convert `TableauTuples` to use `ClonableArray`.

**New classes**
- ResidueSequence: a residue sequence
- ResidueSequences: parent class for residue sequence
- StandardTableaux_residue: residue class standard tableaux (tuples) of given residue
- StandardTableaux_residue_shape: residue class of given residue and shape

** New partition (tuple) methods**
- defect: the Lie theoretic defect of the partition considered as a weight
- degree: the exponent of the e-th cyclotomic polynomial in the Gram determinant of the corresponding q-Specht module
- p_Degree: the exponent of p in the Gram determinant of the corresponding Specht module
- standard_tableaux: returns the parent for the standard tableaux of this shape

** New tableau (tuple) methods**
- codegree: The BKW codegree function
- content: returns the content of an integer in a tableau
- degree:   The BKW degree function
- first_column_descent: first descent in tableau using row reading
- first_row_descent: first descent in tableau using column reading
- residue: returns the residue of an integer in a tableau
- residue_sequence: the residue sequence of the tableau
- reduced_row_word: lexicographically minimal reduced expression for 

**Main residue sequence methods**
- block: returns an invariant that determines the block associated to a residue sequence
- negative: returns the "negative" residue sequence, corresponding to Mullineux conjugation
- restrict: returns a restriction of the residue sequence
- standard_tableaux: a generator for the standard tabelau with this residue sequence
- swap_residues: returns the residue sequence obtained by swapping two residues


**Keywords:** days78, tableaux, residue sequences, tableaux degrees

I've made my way through most of this ticket in some detail, but there are a number of issues.

- The first is that the `degree` and `p_Degree` methods need better documentation. I tried to change it to what I interpreted them as, but I realized I have no idea what it should say.
- There are a number of places with incorrectly formatting docstrings, such as the first sentence not being "short"/"one-line", a few run-on sentences, and unclear `INPUT:` blocks.

However, the code looks good; so getting this finalized is just a matter of putting on some polish.

Thanks Travis! I'll fix these and look through all of the documentation. 

There were some comments on sage-dev about some source files becoming overly large so I was wondering also whether it would be better to put the residue sequence code into its' own file. I think that `StandardTableaux_residue` and `StandardTableaux_residue_shape` need to stay in tableau_tuple but  the other classes could go into a tableau_residue file. On the other hand, tableau_tuple is already quite specialised so perhaps it doesn't matter. What do you think?
