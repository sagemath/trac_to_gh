Residue sequences of tableaux are an important statistic, particularly in the non-semisimple and graded representation theories. This ticket implements two classes `ResidueSequence` and its parent class `ResidueSequences` for these sequences, In addition, it implements the Brundan-Kleshchev-Wang degree function on tableaux and tableaux tuples. In practice, these are all implemented as methods on tableaux and tableaux tuples:

```python
sage: StandardTableau([[1,2,3],[4,5]]).residue_sequence(3).standard_tableaux()
Standard tableaux of residue (0,1,2,2,0)
Tableau([[1,2,5],[3,4]]).degree(3)
0
sage: StandardTableauTuple([[[5]],[[1,2],[3,4]]]).residue_sequence(3,[0,0])
3-residue sequence (0,1,2,0,0) with multicharge (0,0)
sage: StandardTableauTuple([[[2,8],[7]],[[1,4,6],[3,5]]]).degree(0,(0,1))
1
```
As an added bonus, we convert `TableauTuples` to use `ClonableArray`.

**New classes**
- ResidueSequence: a residue sequence
- ResidueSequences: parent class for residue sequence
- StandardTableaux_residue: residue class standard tableaux (tuples) of given residue
- StandardTableaux_residue_shape: residue class of given residue and shape

** New partition (tuple) methods**
- defect: the Lie theoretic defect of the partition considered as a weight
- degree: the exponent of the e-th cyclotomic polynomial in the Gram determinant of the corresponding q-Specht module
- p_Degree: the exponent of p in the Gram determinant of the corresponding Specht module
- standard_tableaux: returns the parent for the standard tableaux of this shape

** New tableau (tuple) methods**
- codegree: The BKW codegree function
- content: returns the content of an integer in a tableau
- degree:   The BKW degree function
- first_column_descent: first descent in tableau using row reading
- first_row_descent: first descent in tableau using column reading
- residue: returns the residue of an integer in a tableau
- residue_sequence: the residue sequence of the tableau
- reduced_row_word: lexicographically minimal reduced expression for 

**Main residue sequence methods**
- block: returns an invariant that determines the block associated to a residue sequence
- negative: returns the "negative" residue sequence, corresponding to Mullineux conjugation
- restrict: returns a restriction of the residue sequence
- standard_tableaux: a generator for the standard tabelau with this residue sequence
- swap_residues: returns the residue sequence obtained by swapping two residues


Keywords: days78, tableaux, residue sequences, tableaux degrees

> However, you have (likely inadvertently) based this off #20618, so I think it would be a good idea to separate those out rather than make #20618 a dependency.


Damn! It looks like I have somehow hooked #20618 into my version of the develop branch. Will have to figure out how to get rid of it...

I've made my way through most of this ticket in some detail, but there are a number of issues.

- The first is that the `degree` and `p_Degree` methods need better documentation. I tried to change it to what I interpreted them as, but I realized I have no idea what it should say.
- There are a number of places with incorrectly formatting docstrings, such as the first sentence not being "short"/"one-line", a few run-on sentences, and unclear `INPUT:` blocks.

However, the code looks good; so getting this finalized is just a matter of putting on some polish.

Thanks Travis! I'll fix these and look through all of the documentation. 

There were some comments on sage-dev about some source files becoming overly large so I was wondering also whether it would be better to put the residue sequence code into its' own file. I think that `StandardTableaux_residue` and `StandardTableaux_residue_shape` need to stay in tableau_tuple but  the other classes could go into a tableau_residue file. On the other hand, tableau_tuple is already quite specialised so perhaps it doesn't matter. What do you think?
