Residue sequences of tableaux are an important statistic, particularly in the non-semisimple and graded representation theories. This ticket implements two classes `ResidueSequence` and its parent class `ResidueSequences` for these sequences, In addition, it implements the Brundan-Kleshchev-Wang degree function on tableaux and tableaux tuples. In practice, these are all implemented as methods on tableaux and tableaux tuples:

```python
sage: StandardTableau([[1,2,3],[4,5]]).residue_sequence(3).standard_tableaux()
Standard tableaux of residue (0,1,2,2,0)
Tableau([[1,2,5],[3,4]]).degree(3)
0
sage: StandardTableauTuple([[[5]],[[1,2],[3,4]]]).residue_sequence(3,[0,0])
3-residue sequence (0,1,2,0,0) with multicharge (0,0)
sage: StandardTableauTuple([[[2,8],[7]],[[1,4,6],[3,5]]]).degree(0,(0,1))
1
```
As an added bonus, we convert `TableauTuples` to use `ClonableArray`.

**New classes**
- ResidueSequence: a residue sequence
- ResidueSequences: parent class for residue sequence
- StandardTableaux_residue: residue class standard tableaux (tuples) of given residue
- StandardTableaux_residue_shape: residue class of given residue and shape

** New partition (tuple) methods**
- defect: the Lie theoretic defect of the partition considered as a weight
- degree: the exponent of the e-th cyclotomic polynomial in the Gram determinant of the corresponding q-Specht module
- p_Degree: the exponent of p in the Gram determinant of the corresponding Specht module
- standard_tableaux: returns the parent for the standard tableaux of this shape

** New tableau (tuple) methods**
- codegree: The BKW codegree function
- content: returns the content of an integer in a tableau
- degree:   The BKW degree function
- first_column_descent: first descent in tableau using row reading
- first_row_descent: first descent in tableau using column reading
- residue: returns the residue of an integer in a tableau
- residue_sequence: the residue sequence of the tableau
- reduced_row_word: lexicographically minimal reduced expression for 

**Main residue sequence methods**
- block: returns an invariant that determines the block associated to a residue sequence
- negative: returns the "negative" residue sequence, corresponding to Mullineux conjugation
- restrict: returns a restriction of the residue sequence
- standard_tableaux: a generator for the standard tabelau with this residue sequence
- swap_residues: returns the residue sequence obtained by swapping two residues


Keywords: days78, tableaux, residue sequences, tableaux degrees

+Residue sequences of tableaux are an important statistic, particularly in the non-semisimple and graded representation theories. This ticket implements two classes `ResidueSequence` and its parent class `ResidueSequences` for these sequences, In addition, it implements the Brundan-Kleshchev-Wang degree function on tableaux and tableaux tuples. In practice, these are all implemented as methods on tableaux and tableaux tuples:
+
+```python
+sage: StandardTableau([[1,2,3],[4,5]]).residue_sequence(3).standard_tableaux()
+Standard tableaux of residue (0,1,2,2,0)
+Tableau([[1,2,5],[3,4]]).degree(3)
+0
+sage: StandardTableauTuple([[[5]],[[1,2],[3,4]]]).residue_sequence(3,[0,0])
+3-residue sequence (0,1,2,0,0) with multicharge (0,0)
+sage: StandardTableauTuple([[[2,8],[7]],[[1,4,6],[3,5]]]).degree(0,(0,1))
+1
+```
+As an added bonus, we convert `TableauTuples` to use `ClonableArray`.
+
+**New classes**
+- ResidueSequence: a residue sequence
+- ResidueSequences: parent class for residue sequence
+- StandardTableaux_residue: residue class standard tableaux (tuples) of given residue
+- StandardTableaux_residue_shape: residue class of given residue and shape
+
+** New partition (tuple) methods**
+- defect: the Lie theoretic defect of the partition considered as a weight
+- degree: the exponent of the e-th cyclotomic polynomial in the Gram determinant of the corresponding q-Specht module
+- p_Degree: the exponent of p in the Gram determinant of the corresponding Specht module
+- standard_tableaux: returns the parent for the standard tableaux of this shape
+
+** New tableau (tuple) methods**
+- codegree: The BKW codegree function
+- content: returns the content of an integer in a tableau
+- degree:   The BKW degree function
+- first_column_descent: first descent in tableau using row reading
+- first_row_descent: first descent in tableau using column reading
+- residue: returns the residue of an integer in a tableau
+- residue_sequence: the residue sequence of the tableau
+- reduced_row_word: lexicographically minimal reduced expression for 
+
+**Main residue sequence methods**
+- block: returns an invariant that determines the block associated to a residue sequence
+- negative: returns the "negative" residue sequence, corresponding to Mullineux conjugation
+- restrict: returns a restriction of the residue sequence
+- standard_tableaux: a generator for the standard tabelau with this residue sequence
+- swap_residues: returns the residue sequence obtained by swapping two residues

<a id='comment:17'></a>I've made my way through most of this ticket in some detail, but there are a number of issues.

- The first is that the `degree` and `p_Degree` methods need better documentation. I tried to change it to what I interpreted them as, but I realized I have no idea what it should say.
- There are a number of places with incorrectly formatting docstrings, such as the first sentence not being "short"/"one-line", a few run-on sentences, and unclear `INPUT:` blocks.

However, the code looks good; so getting this finalized is just a matter of putting on some polish.

Thanks Travis! I'll fix these and look through all of the documentation. 

There were some comments on sage-dev about some source files becoming overly large so I was wondering also whether it would be better to put the residue sequence code into its' own file. I think that `StandardTableaux_residue` and `StandardTableaux_residue_shape` need to stay in tableau_tuple but  the other classes could go into a tableau_residue file. On the other hand, tableau_tuple is already quite specialised so perhaps it doesn't matter. What do you think?

I think `tableau_tuple.py` is nowhere near as long as a number of other files, but it would be easier to find documentation/code-wise if it was in a separate file, as well as avoid one import loop between `partition_tuple.py` and `tableau_tuple.py`. So, I think it would be good to move it.

I also realized I did not properly indent the tests I moved into `ResidueSequence.__init__`. Moreover, one other doc note is `blocks` has a partial sentence.
