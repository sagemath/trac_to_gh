The patch seems good (and doctest of modified files passed), but is there some error in branches? The title says "in combinat", but none of the files are at combinat-folder.

After "In Python3, the division of Python integers returns a float instead." there could be something like "In both Python2 and Python3 will `//` give an euclidean division." or something like that.
