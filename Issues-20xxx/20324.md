`add_col` and `add_variable` both add a variable to the problem; but `add_col` only allows to add a column with no name; whereas `add_variable` only allows to add a column with no coefficients. 
There should be one function (`add_variable`, probably - see #20296 for a possible interface) that can do both; should then deprecate `add_col`. 
Note that `add_col` is not used by `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`; it is only used in doctests of the backends.  
Also, `GurobiBackend` does not implement `add_col` (this is fixed in #20424).
(Also compare with `add_linear_constraint`, which takes a zipped index/coefficient list, whereas `add_col` takes two parallel lists.)

While making this change, should also clarify the defaulting behavior of the `binary`, `continuous`, `integer` arguments of `add_variable`. The argument list is:

```
cpdef int add_variable(self, lower_bound=0.0, upper_bound=None, binary=False, continuous=False, integer=False, obj=0.0, name=None)
```
Whereas the documentation says:
- `binary` - `True` if the variable is binary (default: `False`).
- `continuous` - `True` if the variable is binary [SIC!] (default: `True`).
- `integer` - `True` if the variable is binary [SIC!] (default: `False`).
Probably the defaults in the arglist should be `None`, and defaulting to creating continuous variables should be explained separately.
(See #20362 for a discussion of a possible better interface and the mismatch with `set_variable_type`.)

Also #23600 should be fixed: the signatures of the `cpdef` functions should be the same in all implementations to fix Cython vtable warnings.
