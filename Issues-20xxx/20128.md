sage: x, y = var('x,y')
sage: ellipse = 3*x^2 + 2*x*y + y^2 - x + y - 7
sage: circle = x^2 + y^2 - 3
sage: for i in range(1000): qe = qepcad([ellipse < 0, circle < 0])

One gets the following similar error if `interact=True` option is used.

What OS do you have this error on? This loop completes on Linux Ubunty 14.10 every time I try (even if I change the range to 2000).

If I start this loop and watch at the same time the output of `top` I see a lot of python and qepcad processes start. It's not as synchronous as you might think, for some reason; I don't know if it is a bug, I will ask on sage-devel.

not sure about the latter, but it looks it's by design that the interface is meant to solve one formula in qepcad and quit.This is very much different from e.g. pexpect interface to GAP or Maxima.

> What is the bug in QEPCAD you found?


I'm not sure anymore that there is a bug, but there is something which makes the QEPCAD interface "special" since other interfaces do not have this bug. It's just all very unclear to me.
