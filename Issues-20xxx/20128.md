sage: x, y = var('x,y')
sage: ellipse = 3*x^2 + 2*x*y + y^2 - x + y - 7
sage: circle = x^2 + y^2 - 3
sage: for i in range(1000): qe = qepcad([ellipse < 0, circle < 0])
OSError: [Errno 35] Resource temporarily unavailable

One gets the following similar error if `interact=True` option is used.

```
RuntimeError: unable to start QEPCAD because the command 
'env qe=/Users/yzh/sage/local qepcad' failed:

not sure about the latter, but it looks it's by design that the interface is meant to solve one formula in qepcad and quit.This is very much different from e.g. pexpect interface to GAP or Maxima.

I'm not sure anymore that there is a bug, but there is something which makes the QEPCAD interface "special" since other interfaces do not have this bug. It's just all very unclear to me.
