```
File "src/sage/libs/coxeter3/coxeter_group.py", line 44, in sage.libs.coxeter3.coxeter_group.CoxeterGroup.__init__
Failed example:
    TestSuite(CoxeterGroup(['A',2])).run()                    # optional - coxeter3
Expected nothing
...
The following tests failed: _test_codegrees, _test_degrees

Am I correct that this is tested since it goes into the category `FiniteCoxeterGroups`?

Frédéric, could you remind me where your generic code for the degrees go - couldn't we use that here as well (and for finite Coxeter groups, the codegrees are just two less than the degrees).
