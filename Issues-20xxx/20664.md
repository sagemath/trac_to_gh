Follow-up on #20462:

- #31791 `MIPVariable`: Better names for backend variables

- #31750 `MIPVariable`: Change to a subclass of `FiniteFamily`

- #31749 `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`: New generator method `variables`

- #20331 A `MIPVariable`'s repr should include some useful information

- #20656 `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`: Remove `_variables` dictionary

- #26302 `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` should provide a way to get the variables in the order they are provided to the `polyhedron` method

- #7790 Setting a default max/min bound when calling `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.new_variable`

- #20657: More fixes for copying a `MIP` and the `MIPVariables` created by `new_variable`

- Why does a `MIPVariable` only have `set_max`, but no `get_max`? 

- Why does `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.set_max` delegate to a `MIPVariable` method of the same name, when  other `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` methods such as `set_integer` etc. just do everything directly, and no corresponding `MIPVariable` methods exist?

- Actually these things should properly be referred to as `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` rather than `min` and `max`. Some deprecation fun to be had.

- Why is there no way to query the values of the components of the `_default_mipvariable`?
