<a id='comment:2'></a>I think it would be better to change the tests of the form

```
sage: for i in range(2):
....:     print w[i] == sum( phi.matrix()[i,j]*v[j] for j in range(3) ),
....:
True True
```
to

```
sage: all(w[i] == sum(phi.matrix()[i,j]*v[j] for j in range(3)) for i in range(2))
True
```
Also, could you add one more space in front of the lists with line breaks:

```diff
 sage: list(c.index_generator())
 [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0),
-(2, 1), (2, 2)]
+ (2, 1), (2, 2)]
```
Otherwise LGTM. Thanks.
