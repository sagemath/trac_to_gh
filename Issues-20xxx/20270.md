“test shells” created using `sage.repl.interpreter.get_test_shell()` load `~/.sage/init.sage`, making the doctests that use `get_test_shell()` fragile.

```
$ echo "x = 'x'" > ~/.sage/init.sage
$ ./sage -t src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py
[...]
sage -t src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py  # 2 doctests failed
```
