In a general manner I think doctests should be run with `DOT_SAGE=$temp` where `$temp` is a temporary directory in `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` , preferably created with `mktemp` or similar process. There may be a couple of tests for which that would cause problem, but overall it would be much more robust.

Even better, why not `HOME=$tempdir`?

That certainly would achieve it too. As far as I know `$HOME` is only involved in the determination of `DOT_SAGE` but there could be other stuff (dot directories not inside .sage by default for example), so that's extra safe.
