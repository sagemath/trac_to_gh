“test shells” created using `sage.repl.interpreter.get_test_shell()` load `~/.sage/init.sage`, making the doctests that use `get_test_shell()` fragile.

```
$ echo "x = 'x'" > ~/.sage/init.sage
$ ./sage -t src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py
[...]
sage -t src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py  # 2 doctests failed
```

In a general manner I think doctests should be run with `DOT_SAGE=$temp` where `$temp` is a temporary directory in `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` , preferably created with `mktemp` or similar process. There may be a couple of tests for which that would cause problem, but overall it would be much more robust.
