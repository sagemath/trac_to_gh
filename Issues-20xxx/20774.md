Compute the set of singular points of a generic algebraic curve and determine their multiplicities.

For plane curves, implement functionality to compute the tangents of the curve at a point, and to determine whether a singular point is ordinary or not.

some comments in no particular order

- the values I've checked agree with Magma.

- I would rather see a while loop than a for/break since you are using the loop variable later when you are getting an appropriate affine patch

- examples are all QQ or number field. I'd like to see some other fields (assuming they work)

- in multiplicity: why don't you change ring first to get the ordering, and then use R.ideal to create the ideal. That way you only have to change_ring once instead of twice.

- OUTPUT: an integer.   You don't have to make a list when it is a simple output

- multiplicity = 0: do you really want to allow this? I think returning an error that the point is not on the curve may be more intuitive. If you change it: in tangents: if r < 1 isn't needed. Either way, this should be described in the doc

- in is_ordinary: OUTPUT: Boolean. You should document that an error is returned for a non-singular point

- in singular_points: I think putting F=F is better than adding the 0 as the first parameter.

- do you want to add C.singular_subscheme()?

- I see many places you are restricting to fields. Should there be a field subclass?

- Things like Q.is_ordinary_singularity(), Q.tangents(), Q.multiplicity() don't work when Q is the curve point.

- Q.is_singular() and C.is_singular(Q) would be nice to have.

Thanks. I added some examples with different fields. It looks like multiplicity works with RR and CC, and with finite fields. I think only number fields work with the tangents functions though, since they use the function factor().

I implemented an is_singular function which just uses the is_smooth functions of affine/projective subschemes. If given a point it returns whether it's singular or not, otherwise it returns whether the curve is singular or not. I added a singular_subscheme function as well.

Currently, only plane curves over general rings can be defined. In the space curve initialization, dimension is checked. Could we get around this by checking the dimension of the new curve created by embedding the defining polynomials of the original curve into the polynomial ring with coefficients from the field of fractions of the base ring (assuming it's an integral domain)?

If we add classes for curves over rings, would the naming scheme AffineCurve_ring, ProjectiveCurve_ring for generic curves over rings, and renaming
AffineCurve --> AffineCurve_field
ProjectiveCurve --> ProjectiveCurve_field
be okay?

I haven't yet implemented the corresponding singularity analysis functions for points on curves; do you think it might be good for me to create classes for points on  general curves first? Maybe similar to what's done in ell_point.py for points on elliptic curves?

Merging with beta4 broke the example in the singular_points function at line 260 of curve.py; too few points seem to be returned now.

It looks like this is due to the point search changes for 0 dimensional subschemes from #20780. Replacing the new point search with the old one from before the merge resolves the problem. Here's the failed example modified a bit:

```
R.<a> = QQ[]
K.<b> = NumberField(a^8 - a^4 + 1)
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 2)
C = Curve([359/12*x*y^2*z^2 + 2*y*z^4 + 187/12*y^3*z^2 + x*z^4\
+ 67/3*x^2*y*z^2 + 117/4*y^5 + 9*x^5 + 6*x^3*z^2 + 393/4*x*y^4\
+ 145*x^2*y^3 + 115*x^3*y^2 + 49*x^4*y], P)
X = C.singular_subscheme()
Q = P([1/2*b^5 + 1/2*b^3 - 1/2*b - 1,1,0])
X(Q)
(1/2*b^5 + 1/2*b^3 - 1/2*b - 1 : 1 : 0)
X.rational_points() # Q is on X, but not in set of rational points anymore
[(2/3*b^4 - 1/3 : 0 : 1), (b^6 : -b^6 : 1), (-b^6 : b^6 : 1), (-2/3*b^4 + 1/3 : 0 : 1)]
```

I thought the point search method in #20780 looked good when I reviewed it, and I think this issue might just be from a weird special case. For this example, during the part of the algorithm using the affine patch corresponding to y = 1, the Groebner basis used is `[x^2 + 2*x + 1/2*z^2 + 3/2, x*z + z, z^3 + z]`. The rightmost polynomial has z = 0 among its roots, but substituting z = 0 and y = 1 into the next polynomial `x*z + z` yields 0, and I think this causes the algorithm to skip any points with z = 0, y = 1. But if those values had been kept for the last polynomial `x^2 + 2*x + 1/2*z^2 + 3/2`, substituting them in would give `x^2 + 2*x + 3/2` which would give the x values of the missing points.

I think a way to resolve this might be to just add something like

```
else:
    new_points.append(P)
    good = 1
```
after the if statement `if L != 0:` in line 159 of projective_homset.py. Doing this doesn't seem to break any examples, but does it mess up the algorithm at all?
