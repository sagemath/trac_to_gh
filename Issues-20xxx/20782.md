When cythonizing Sage, the following shows up:

```
[sagelib-7.3.beta3] missing cimport in module '.': ./sage/rings/rational.pxd
[sagelib-7.3.beta3] missing cimport in module '.': sage/rings/rational.pxd
```

This is because Cython does not fully support the syntax

```
from <path> cimport <module>
```

The whole "rings" folder is an horrible mess of circular imports, see #20629

I haven't really looked at that. But in any case, it has nothing to do with the Cython issue on this ticket.
