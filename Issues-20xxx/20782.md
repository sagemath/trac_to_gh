```
When cythonizing Sage, the following shows up:

```
[sagelib-7.3.beta3] missing cimport in module '.': ./sage/rings/rational.pxd
[sagelib-7.3.beta3] missing cimport in module '.': sage/rings/rational.pxd
```

This is because Cython does not fully support the syntax

```
from <path> cimport <module>
```
