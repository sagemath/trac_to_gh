no, I mean the output result: sage.app vs. sage console vs. sage console packaged as dmg

How is it specified?

Agreed that the current readme is cryptic, and that Sage 7.1 or whatever shouldn't be released until that's fixed.  Reading [the sage-osx-makefile](https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg/blob/master/sage-osx-makefile) didn't make me wiser in comparison to the detailed explanation of the 'old' env vars, and I really don't think one should have to know what a `yaml` file is in order to use these.  I'll try making a PR for that 'upstream' but will likely fail miserably at expressing what is going on...

BTW, will `binary-pkg` ever become part of Sage (is it already)?
