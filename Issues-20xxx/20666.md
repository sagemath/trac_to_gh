In #20086 a `nth_root` method was proposed to be able to take fractional powers of polynomials. Though this was not implemented for all polynomial rings. On sage-7.3.beta0 we have

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: (x**2)**(1/2)
x
sage: x = polygen(GF(4))
sage: (x**2)**(1/2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Only integral powers defined.
```

Depends on #22329
