Before:

```
sage: QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: %timeit CBF(i)
The slowest run took 5.04 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100 loops, best of 3: 2.45 ms per loop
sage: NF.<a> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: RBF((a-1)^100)
[+/- 3.78e+22]
```
After:

```
sage: QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: %timeit CBF(i)
The slowest run took 1175.13 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 791 ns per loop
sage: NF.<a> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: RBF((a-1)^100)
