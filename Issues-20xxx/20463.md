Due to a Cygwin bug https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-05/msg00140.html there is a segmentation fault when the PARI maximum stack size is larger than 4GB.

The issue has also been reported to PARI: http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-1605/threads.html

I have discovered what I think is the cause of this issue, and have reported it upstream--I believe it to be an issue in Cygwin: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-05/msg00140.html

I've attached a workaround for the issue from the Sage end.  I'm not terribly happy with it, because if I understand correctly PARI will automatically grow its stack size as needed, and if it grows beyond 4GB this bug *could* still occur (though I haven't tested this yet--anyone want to suggest to me a good way to test it?)

I'm not sure how best to work around that though without completely taking over PARI's stack management.  Probably fine just to leave it as a known issue until there's a fix in Cygwin. It's more important that we don't immediately segfault as soon as the first PARI number is created.

Replying to [@embray](#comment%3A1):
> if I understand correctly PARI will automatically grow its stack size as needed

PARI will automatically grow its stack up to some user-provided maximum. The function is

```
paristack_setsize(size, vsize)       
```
where `size` is the actual size and `vsize` the maximum size.

I was under the assumption that it would grow automatically as needed, but maybe I shouldn't assume that it works nicely....

I have an update to this patch somewhere, I just haven't gotten around to pushing it yet.

In the meantime Cygwin has acknowledged the bug and pushed the fix.  I just confirmed that the fix seems to work (there's no segfault, at least): https://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-05/msg00240.html

Not sure yet when the fix will be in a release.  I may update this to include a version check on Cygwin once it makes sense to.

Now always calls `paristack_setsize()`, but to a smaller value on platforms with this issue.

Also added an explicit check on the cygwin version, and does not invoke the workaround for Cygwin v2.5.2 where this is fixed.

Yes, this is better.

I just don't understand why you talk of a limit of 4GB but then use 1GB (actually0x3fffffff) in the code?

That division by 4 is simply to determine how much memory should be used. It is a totally arbitrary number and it should be unrelated to the limit on Cygwin.

Did you run full doctests (`make ptestlong`) on Cygwin with this patch?

This comment does not really makes sense, I suggest to delete these 2 lines:

```
            # So we will just let the pari stack size grow as needed; if
            # it grows beyond 4GB this issue could still be triggered

The stack will only grow "as needed" up to the virtual stack size, which is at most `0xf0000000`.
