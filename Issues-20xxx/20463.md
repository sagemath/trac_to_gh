Due to a Cygwin bug https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-05/msg00140.html there is a segmentation fault when the PARI maximum stack size is larger than 4GB.

The issue has also been reported to PARI: http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-1605/threads.html

Keywords: cygwin windows

Branch/Commit: 856f128777c04a88e4efe6295e98292a2f0cc7e2

I've attached a workaround for the issue from the Sage end.  I'm not terribly happy with it, because if I understand correctly PARI will automatically grow its stack size as needed, and if it grows beyond 4GB this bug *could* still occur (though I haven't tested this yet--anyone want to suggest to me a good way to test it?)

I'm not sure how best to work around that though without completely taking over PARI's stack management.  Probably fine just to leave it as a known issue until there's a fix in Cygwin. It's more important that we don't immediately segfault as soon as the first PARI number is created.

PARI will automatically grow its stack up to some user-provided maximum. The function is

```
paristack_setsize(size, vsize)       
```
where `size` is the actual size and `vsize` the maximum size.
