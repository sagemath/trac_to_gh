I have discovered what I think is the cause of this issue, and have reported it upstream--I believe it to be an issue in Cygwin: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-05/msg00140.html

I've attached a workaround for the issue from the Sage end.  I'm not terribly happy with it, because if I understand correctly PARI will automatically grow its stack size as needed, and if it grows beyond 4GB this bug *could* still occur (though I haven't tested this yet--anyone want to suggest to me a good way to test it?)

I'm not sure how best to work around that though without completely taking over PARI's stack management.  Probably fine just to leave it as a known issue until there's a fix in Cygwin. It's more important that we don't immediately segfault as soon as the first PARI number is created.

Replying to [embray](#comment%3A1):
> if I understand correctly PARI will automatically grow its stack size as needed


PARI will automatically grow its stack up to some user-provided maximum. The function is

```
paristack_setsize(size, vsize)       
```
where `size` is the actual size and `vsize` the maximum size.

I have an update to this patch somewhere, I just haven't gotten around to pushing it yet.

In the meantime Cygwin has acknowledged the bug and pushed the fix.  I just confirmed that the fix seems to work (there's no segfault, at least): https://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-05/msg00240.html

Not sure yet when the fix will be in a release.  I may update this to include a version check on Cygwin once it makes sense to.

Yes, this is better.

I just don't understand why you talk of a limit of 4GB but then use 1GB (actually0x3fffffff) in the code?

That division by 4 is simply to determine how much memory should be used. It is a totally arbitrary number and it should be unrelated to the limit on Cygwin.

Did you run full doctests (`make ptestlong`) on Cygwin with this patch?
