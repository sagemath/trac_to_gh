Due to a Cygwin bug https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-05/msg00140.html there is a segmentation fault when the PARI maximum stack size is larger than 4GB.

The issue has also been reported to PARI: http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-1605/threads.html

Keywords: **cygwin windows**

I have discovered what I think is the cause of this issue, and have reported it upstream--I believe it to be an issue in Cygwin: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-05/msg00140.html

I've attached a workaround for the issue from the Sage end.  I'm not terribly happy with it, because if I understand correctly PARI will automatically grow its stack size as needed, and if it grows beyond 4GB this bug *could* still occur (though I haven't tested this yet--anyone want to suggest to me a good way to test it?)

I'm not sure how best to work around that though without completely taking over PARI's stack management.  Probably fine just to leave it as a known issue until there's a fix in Cygwin. It's more important that we don't immediately segfault as soon as the first PARI number is created.

PARI will automatically grow its stack up to some user-provided maximum. The function is

```
paristack_setsize(size, vsize)       
```
where `size` is the actual size and `vsize` the maximum size.

The code has changed a little bit since then too.  Most notably as of [ade4f752](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/compare/ade4f7521ad77c03e9791bc3768d9a9e3a2daca4...develop) there are no longer `bot`, `top` and `avma` global variables in `paridecl.pxi` (then `decl.pxi`).  Now there is a single struct `pari_mainstack` with these pointers as elements.  I don't think that makes an enormous difference though, but it does change the discussion somewhat.\n-\n-Otherwise the !Python/Cython level stacktrace is almost the same as before.  The segfault occurs on [this line](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx?h=976c0f3d0f9f0ac744e535ea734dadf2e7918991#n3138) which I guess happens to be reached the first time any PARI object is created during import.  I haven't debugged deeper than that yet but I'm guessing it's the same issue as in the original ticket--that the PARI stack somehow hasn't been initialized yet.\n-\n-[Incidentally, one thing that did seem to work is cysignals--it caught the segfault and raised a Python exception for it. So I don't *think* cysignals is related here but I wouldn't necessarily rule it out either.]\n+Due to a Cygwin bug https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-05/msg00140.html there is a segmentation fault when the PARI maximum stack size is larger than 4GB.\n``````\n",

-This is the same issue as #11551, but as that issue was closed several years ago (with no satisfying resolution) it was suggested I open a new ticket.  The code has changed a little bit since then too.  Most notably as of [ade4f752](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/compare/ade4f7521ad77c03e9791bc3768d9a9e3a2daca4...develop) there are no longer `bot`, `top` and `avma` global variables in `paridecl.pxi` (then `decl.pxi`).  Now there is a single struct `pari_mainstack` with these pointers as elements.  I don't think that makes an enormous difference though, but it does change the discussion somewhat.
-
-Otherwise the !Python/Cython level stacktrace is almost the same as before.  The segfault occurs on [this line](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx?h=976c0f3d0f9f0ac744e535ea734dadf2e7918991#n3138) which I guess happens to be reached the first time any PARI object is created during import.  I haven't debugged deeper than that yet but I'm guessing it's the same issue as in the original ticket--that the PARI stack somehow hasn't been initialized yet.
-
-[Incidentally, one thing that did seem to work is cysignals--it caught the segfault and raised a Python exception for it. So I don't *think* cysignals is related here but I wouldn't necessarily rule it out either.]

I have an update to this patch somewhere, I just haven't gotten around to pushing it yet.

In the meantime Cygwin has acknowledged the bug and pushed the fix.  I just confirmed that the fix seems to work (there's no segfault, at least): https://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-05/msg00240.html

Not sure yet when the fix will be in a release.  I may update this to include a version check on Cygwin once it makes sense to.

That division by 4 is simply to determine how much memory should be used. It is a totally arbitrary number and it should be unrelated to the limit on Cygwin.

Did you run full doctests (`make ptestlong`) on Cygwin with this patch?

This comment does not really makes sense, I suggest to delete these 2 lines:

```
            # So we will just let the pari stack size grow as needed; if
            # it grows beyond 4GB this issue could still be triggered

The stack will only grow "as needed" up to the virtual stack size, which is at most `0xf0000000`.
