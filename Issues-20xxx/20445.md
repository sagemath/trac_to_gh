```
The algorithm in chevie is very different from the algorithm we currently have:

```
ForEachElement:=function(W,f)local l,g;
  if not IsFinite(W) then Error("only for finite Coxeter groups");
  elif W.nbGeneratingReflections=0 then f(W.identity);return;
  fi;
  l:=List([0..W.nbGeneratingReflections],i->
        ReflectionSubgroup(W,W.reflectionsLabels{[1..i]}));
  l:=List([1..Length(l)-1],i->ReducedRightCosetRepresentatives(l[i+1],l[i]));
  g:=function(x,v)local y;
    if Length(v)=0 then f(x);
    else for y in v[1] do g(x*y,v{[2..Length(v)]});od;
    fi;
  end;
  g(W.identity,l);
end;
```

We should also implement that algorithm (maybe even with hard-coded coset representatives in the finite case) so that we can see if this is indeed faster.

The two needed methods are

```

I locally reimplemented the multiplication of `PermutationGroupElement`. This resulted in

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['E',7])                                                
sage: from sage.combinat.root_system.reflection_group_c import parabolic_iteration
sage: timeit("for w in parabolic_iteration(W): pass",number=5)                    
5 loops, best of 3: 2.4 s per loop
```
If we provide a very restricted implementation of permutations ourselves, we might get down further quite a bit. Remark: the algorithm without the multiplication and creation of new permutation group elements only takes `.5sec`, so there is a lot to improve still.

I just redid the computations and it seems to be about twice as fast as in gap3:

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['E',7])
sage: from sage.combinat.root_system.reflection_group_c import parabolic_iteration
sage: timeit("for w in parabolic_iteration(W): pass",number=5)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.56 s per loop
sage: timeit("for w in parabolic_iteration(W): pass",number=5)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.43 s per loop
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['E',8])
sage: %time for w in parabolic_iteration(W): pass

CPU times: user 9min 12s, sys: 3.81 s, total: 9min 16s
Wall time: 9min 16s
```
So we are slowly approaching the 5min...

Travis, could you also now run

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['E',8])
sage: %time for w in W.iteration("depth",False): pass
```
It now also uses the local multiplication, so it should also speed quite a bit. On my machine, it's only 1.5 times as slow.

Replying to [stumpc5](#comment%3A17):
> 1. I would really like to see how to implement our own permutation group elements with only what we need. I would hope that to again result in some speedup. One question there: we have w(-\beta) = -w(\beta), so we would not need to record the complete permutation on all roots, but on the positive roots would be enough. That would speed several computations such as creating new elements and testing for equality), but it would have the drawback that we constantly need to work mod N (N=nr of positive roots), e.g., we would have such checks and mod's when multiplying two permutations.

This business sounds of the same nature as what we have for affine
permutations (in window notation). Would there be a way to use the
same implementation behind the scene?

Cheers,
                               Nicolas

And also with colored permutations, isn't it? The main difference is that here (and also in signed permutations) one works mod N, for colored permutations one works "+N mod kN", and for affine permutation one does not work mod anything.

I would propose to first work out the implementation here and then see if we can use it also in the other places. I only don't see how to actually do the implementation in an optimal way, so some support of yours and/or Travis is appreciated.

Some concrete questions:

1. It seems that we should use the same data structure as for `PermutationGroupElement`:

   ```
       self.perm = <int *>sig_malloc(sizeof(int) * self.N)
   ```
   Do you agree? Can we even get anything significantly better than sticking to `PermutationGroupElement` if we do it ourselves? This also asks whether we can do better when multiplying elements, I do not see what

   ```
    cdef PermutationGroupElement prod = PermutationGroupElement.__new__(PermutationGroupElement)
   ```
   does or how long it takes, see the method `_new_mul_` in `reflection_group_c.pyx`.

3. It seems that we are using `PermutationGroupElement` in a few places (when talking to `GAP3`}), but this might just be that we need the cycle string representation for that.

Let me quickly ask: by "create our own separate project where we write all of this independently (in, say, C/C++)" you mean implementing this permutation group element there and then use it from our sage implementation, right?

I'd be happy to follow and help with than whenever you find the time, but at first I will likely only be watching you doing it...

We can discuss this in Meudon.

For the record: I just checked, and the data structure for permutation
group elements is just a reference to the parent and a C-list of ints;
plus a few slots which are unused by default (e.g. a reference to a
gap element). So the only overhead is copying over the reference to
the parent, and a bit of extra memory allocation

Of course, the parent itself has stuff about GAP and categories, but
that's initialized once for all, and does not influence arithmetic on
elements.

I am partially worried about how much these extra copy operations cost on the E<sub>8</sub> iteration scale, as well as the inherent overhead of the generated code from Cython. Plus I like having code where we completely control the memory allocations. It might end up that we really don't see much of an improvement, but I think it is worth trying.
