<a id='comment:9'></a>This does not work. As such it returns the second element of the alphabet, as an element of the string monoid:

```
sage: b = BinaryStrings()
sage: b.one()
1
sage: b.one() * b('001')
1001

sage: b = AlphabeticStrings()
sage: b.one()
B
```


What we are looking here is the neutral element for the multiplication, which you can get as `StringMonoidElement(self, '')`.

You still need to add some doctests.

Also, why creating a `_identity_element` attribute while it is used only once, why not directly define the identity element in the `one` method ?
