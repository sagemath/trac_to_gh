This should do the work.

This does not work. As such it returns the second element of the alphabet, as an element of the string monoid:

```
sage: b = BinaryStrings()
sage: b.one()
1
sage: b.one() * b('001')
1001

sage: b = AlphabeticStrings()
sage: b.one()
B
```


What we are looking here is the neutral element for the multiplication, which you can get as `StringMonoidElement(self, '')`.

You still need to add some doctests.

Also, why creating a `_identity_element` attribute while it is used only once, why not directly define the identity element in the `one` method ?

Let me suggest not doing things unless you actually need it, since this make some noise in the source code. Also, since no other monoid has such an attribute, it is likely that if someone once needs something like that, she will create an attribute with another name higher in the hierarchy, and the information will be stored twice.
