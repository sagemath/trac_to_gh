The recent changes to `sage-uncompress-spkg` have made it *a lot* slower than before. In particular uncompressing the GCC tarball takes 15 to 30 minutes. I haven't analysed in detail yet.

The script though *silently* drops them; no warning, no error message.

Furthermore, there's absolutely no reason to sort the files by their names, then extracting them in their original order, not only but especially when there aren't any "OS-specific" files in the tarball (which is the common case -- as you said, there shouldn't be any in the first place).

While already the Python library's function name is "funny" (extract**all**()), it's not necessary to pass an *unmodified* list of all tarball entries to it in the "non-error" case.

I would be fine with adding a warning message--it would be good to know when invalid files are in some tarball.  I have been advised that "nobody" reads the output from sage builds, but I do so...

I don't understand the rest.  There's no sorting for example.  As for the common case there's no way to detect that's the case without checking for files that shouldn't be extracted so that's a moot point.
