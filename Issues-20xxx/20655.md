When running a `make` of Sage on Cygwin the build fails upon installation of R.  I will attach the full log, but the relevant error is:

```
make[4]: Entering directory '/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/r-3.2.4-revised.p0/R-revised/src/library/Recommended'
begin installing recommended package MASS
INSTALL: unknown option -- pkglock
Try 'INSTALL --help' for more information.
Makefile:51: recipe for target 'MASS.ts' failed
make[4]: *** [MASS.ts] Error 1
make[4]: Leaving directory '/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/r-3.2.4-revised.p0/R-revised/src/library/Recommended'
Makefile:39: recipe for target 'recommended-packages' failed
```

`--pkglock` is an argument to the `INSTALL` script for installing R packages.  But it seems it's been passed in as literally `-- pkglock` (with a space).  Not sure why.

This issue also raises the question again about whether to make R an optional package (as well as whether to allow Sage to use a system install of R).

Ahahahahah  I at least slightly understand better.  I was losing my mind because I could not for the life of me find where this error message could be coming from.

Turns out it's coming from the GNU `install` command, which gets confused for R's `INSTALL` command on Windows because case-insensitivity.

Okay, I think this is a bug in R IMO.

R installs a bunch of "scripts" particular to R with names like `BUILD` and `INSTALL`.  R's install mistakenly marks these "scripts" as executable even though they do not contain a shebang line, so they are technically not executable in that sense.  Instead it runs those scripts from a main script (called `Rcmd`) using `exec`.

The problem here is that `Rcmd` only run these R-specific scripts *if* they are executable, and exist in `$R_HOME/bin`.  Realistically just whether they exist and are files in `$R_HOME/bin` should be good enough, since there shouldn't be any non-executable files in there.   If nothing else it should try to exec and if that fails it will return a permission error.  On Cygwin `exec` doesn't care if the file is marked executable or not, for this reason.  It will just try to execute it.

I still think the patch is worth keeping for the sake of least resistance on trying to build Sage on Cygwin.  This was a very mysterious and hard to track down problem.

Also built okay without this patch on cygwin64. Should we close this as wont-fix?

This issue only impacts if you're building in a directory mounted with `noacl` or with a messed up ACL which happens not infrequently if you have non-Cygwin processes messing with the permissions on files.

The end result is that setting executable flags may not always work.

Yes and no.  I think the real bug is that it requires them to be executable, because the way those particular scripts are invoked, IIRC, is by sourcing them from an actual executable.  In other words, they shouldn't be considered executables in their own right in the first place.

Otherwise yes, I agree they should have a shebang line.
