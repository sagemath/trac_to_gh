When running a `make` of Sage on Cygwin the build fails upon installation of R.  I will attach the full log, but the relevant error is:

```
make[4]: Entering directory '/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/r-3.2.4-revised.p0/R-revised/src/library/Recommended'
begin installing recommended package MASS
INSTALL: unknown option -- pkglock
Try 'INSTALL --help' for more information.
Makefile:51: recipe for target 'MASS.ts' failed
make[4]: *** [MASS.ts] Error 1
make[4]: Leaving directory '/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/r-3.2.4-revised.p0/R-revised/src/library/Recommended'
Makefile:39: recipe for target 'recommended-packages' failed
```

`--pkglock` is an argument to the `INSTALL` script for installing R packages.  But it seems it's been passed in as literally `-- pkglock` (with a space).  Not sure why.

This issue also raises the question again about whether to make R an optional package (as well as whether to allow Sage to use a system install of R).

Ahahahahah  I at least slightly understand better.  I was losing my mind because I could not for the life of me find where this error message could be coming from.

Turns out it's coming from the GNU `install` command, which gets confused for R's `INSTALL` command on Windows because case-insensitivity.

Okay, I think this is a bug in R IMO.

R installs a bunch of "scripts" particular to R with names like `BUILD` and `INSTALL`.  R's install mistakenly marks these "scripts" as executable even though they do not contain a shebang line, so they are technically not executable in that sense.  Instead it runs those scripts from a main script (called `Rcmd`) using `exec`.

The problem here is that `Rcmd` only run these R-specific scripts *if* they are executable, and exist in `$R_HOME/bin`.  Realistically just whether they exist and are files in `$R_HOME/bin` should be good enough, since there shouldn't be any non-executable files in there.   If nothing else it should try to exec and if that fails it will return a permission error.  On Cygwin `exec` doesn't care if the file is marked executable or not, for this reason.  It will just try to execute it.

I still think the patch is worth keeping for the sake of least resistance on trying to build Sage on Cygwin.  This was a very mysterious and hard to track down problem.

This issue only impacts if you're building in a directory mounted with `noacl` or with a messed up ACL which happens not infrequently if you have non-Cygwin processes messing with the permissions on files.

The end result is that setting executable flags may not always work.
