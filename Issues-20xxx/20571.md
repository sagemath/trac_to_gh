In #20086 a `nth_root` method for polynomial was implemented using factorization. But we can use Newton method for that!

It is faster than factorization even over ZZ where factor is highly optimized:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: p = x**14 + x**3 - 12

sage: q = p**13
sage: %timeit _ = q.nth_root(13)
1000 loops, best of 3: 416 µs per loop
sage: %timeit _ = q.factor()
1000 loops, best of 3: 895 µs per loop

sage: q = p**37
sage: %timeit _ = q.nth_root(37)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.17 µs per loop
sage: %timeit _ = q.factor()
100 loops, best of 3: 3.92 ms per loop
```
And the Newton method also works over polynomial when factorization is not implemented

```
sage: R1.<x> = QQ[]
sage: R2.<y> = R1[]
sage: R3.<z> = R2[]
sage: q = (x+y+z)**3
sage: q.factor()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: 
sage: q.nth_root(3)
z + y + x
```

<a id='comment:11'></a>Hi Vincent,

1. For the Newton method, your loop ranges over `newton_method_sizes(p.degree()+1)`: if you are computing an `n`-th root, isn't it sufficient to loop up to `p.degree()//n + 1`? It would fasten the case when `p.nth_root(n)` raises an `Exception`.

2. Instead of the following code, you may use `i = self.valuation()`. The code would gain in legibility, and it is slightly faster if I ran my tests correctly:

```python
            i = 1
            while self[i].is_zero():
                i += 1
```

3. Two typos:

```diff
        This is computed using Newton method in the ring of power series. This
        method works only when the base ring is an integral domain. Morever, for
        polynomial whose coefficient of lower degree is different from 1, the
-        elemehts of the base ring should have a method ``nth_root`` implemented.
+        elements of the base ring should have a method ``nth_root`` implemented.
```

```diff
-            # begining of Newton method
+            # beginning of Newton method
            Sorig = p.parent()
```
