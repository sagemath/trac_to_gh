This should be shown as an error

```
P = Posets.PentagonPoset()
P.is_chain_of_poset([1, 2, 4, 'junk'], ordered=True)
```

Also keyword `saturated` was asked to be added some time ago.

Two things:

```diff
-        - ``saturated`` -- a Boolean. If ``True``, then return ``True``
-          only if `elms` is a saturated chain. A chain `C` is saturated
-          when `a < b < c` and `a, c \in C` implies `b \in C`.
+        - ``saturated`` -- boolean; if ``True``, then return ``True``
+          only if `elms` is a saturated chain
```
and put

```
A chain `C` is saturated when `a < b < c` and `a, c \in C` implies `b \in C`.
```
in with the body of the docstring.

The other thing is I would also have the code be this like this:

```python
# _element_to_vertex can be assumed to be a linear extension
# of the poset according to the documentation of class
# HasseDiagram.
H = self._hasse_diagram

if ordered:
    elms = [self._element_to_vertex(e) for e in elms]
else:
    elms = sorted(set([self._element_to_vertex(e) for e in elms]))

if saturated:
    return all(H.covers(a, b) for a, b in zip(elms, elms[1:]))
else:
    return all(H.is_lequal(a, b) for a, b in zip(elms, elms[1:]))
```

It's my understanding that if repeated elements are allowed, then it's a multichain, and if repeated elements aren't allowed then it's just a chain.

True. But currently

```
P = Posets.PentagonPoset()
P.is_chain_of_poset([2, 2, 3])
```

returns `True`. With suggested code it would still return `True`, but `P.is_chain_of_poset([2,2,3], saturated=True)` would return `False`.

How about third parameter `allow_multichain` with default value `True` to maintain current behaviour?

Forget. Already ``ordered`` makes difference between multichain and chain.

Arghs. What to do? It sounds natural to have three different boolean options, as all `2^3` combinations are usable.

I did #20934 for that.
