RuntimeError: ECL says: Memory limit reached. Please jump to an outer pointer, quit program and enlarge the
memory limits before executing the program again.
```
There is no reason for this because coefficients can be computed directly using big integers:

```
sage: %time _= [factorial(10000)/(factorial(k)*factorial(10000-2*k)) for k in range(1,5000)]
CPU times: user 4.33 s, sys: 24 ms, total: 4.35 s
Wall time: 4.32 s
```
A Pynac prototype is about 50x faster than Maxima for expression creation and creates `H_10000` in 670ms.

Dependencies: #20312

Resolution: fixed
