There are three main issues with the `wtdist_gap` method namely:
1) Name of the method
2) Poor documentation
3) It should be a private function

Hello Arpit,

A few remarks:

- in Sage, you cannot delete/change the signature of a method silently, you have to support the old method for a year. To do that, you need to use [deprecation warnings](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html#deprecation) to notify users about the new functionality (and warn them the old one will be deleted soon). You can use the following line:
`wtdist_gap = deprecated_function_alias(20565, _weight_distribution)`.
Then, call the old `wtdist_gap` and you should see a warning.

- I'm not sure the weight distribution should be a private method: it's an interesting "property" to compute, and I'm sure some users expect to see it here (maybe Johan can confirm what I'm saying).
In any case, I have a specific method `weight_distribution` in `grs.py` (as you have a faster algorithm to compute it on MDS codes) and it's not private. So, for consistency, it should be private everywhere or nowhere (I vote for nowhere).

- Also, I think we can completely remove the input of this method: as you're making it a method of `AbstractLinearCode`, it's no longer needed to pass `n` and `F` (as `self.length()` and `self.base_ring()` will recover `n` and `F`) and I think having to pass the generator matrix in it's GAP string format is very annoying...
One should just call `C.weight_distribution()` and get the list.
It's possible to get the GAP format of a matrix by typing `M._gap_()`.

Otherwise, I agree with other changes, the documentation and the new names.

Best,

David

Perhaps it should therefore be named `AbstractLinearCode._spectrum_from_gap`. Its signature could still be changed to not take any arguments if one just changes how it is called in `spectrum`. That would make sense.

1. Deprecation warnings:
Understood. I'm adding the line now.

2. Name and Private:
`AbstractLinearCode.spectrum` computes the spectrum using three algorithms "binary", "gap" and "leon" each of which is implemented differently. "binary" imports a function from another file and then calls the "weight_dist" function from it while "leon" is implemented within `spectrum`. I think the entire method needs to be refactored so that the code is more modular.
And so perhaps, the name `weight_distribution` is a misnomer. Like Johan suggests, it should be titled `_spectrum_from_gap` (and so on for the other two as well).

3. Input to the method:
Agreed. I'll make changes accordingly.

Hello,

There's still a few problems:

- You deleted some lines from `spectrum`, especially the ones defining the local variables (like `F = self.base_ring()`)... Which results in several failures in this method (l. 3306, for instance, returns `global name F not known`) because it tries to use variables that are no longer defined.

- (this is quite my fault), the deprecation warning does not work. As you put
  `wtdist_gap = deprecated_function_alias(20565, _spectrum_from_gap)` in `AbstractLinearCode`, it does not respect the old signature anymore. With the deprecation mechanism working as expected, one should be able to call

```
sage: Gstr = 'Z(2)*[[1,1,1,0,0,0,0], [1,0,0,1,1,0,0], [0,1,0,1,0,1,0], [1,1,0,1,0,0,1]]'
sage: F = GF(2)
sage: sage.coding.linear_code.wtdist_gap(Gstr, 7, F)
```
 get a warning and the expected result.
 Plus, as I suggested you to remove the input from `_spectrum_from_gap`, if one calls `C.wtdist_gap(Gstr, 7, F)` because `C._spectrum_from_gap(Gstr, 7, F)` does not exist...

 So, I propose to reinstate `wtdist_gap` where it was and as it was, but to change its code: now it will send a deprecation warning and call `_spectrum_from_gap`. It should look like this:

```
 def wtdist_gap(Gmat, n, F):
    from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
    deprecation(20565, "wtdist_gap is now deprecated. Please use AbstractLinearCode._spectrum_from_gap instead.")
    #create a linear code C
    return C._spectrum_from_gap()
```

 It's kind of an idiotic behaviour but it will work.

Best,

David

I've added back the definitions of the local variables such as `F = self.base_ring()`. 

The reason to put back `wtdist_gap` as it was, is to allow for users to get accustomed to the changes, right? That's why we need all the redirects. 
1. Do we want that `spectrum` also call wtdist_gap() which then calls _spectrum_from_gap()? Or can `spectrum` directly call the latter?
2. The original wtdist_gap took the generator matrix in a gap string format. Is it possible to reconvert this representation into a regular generator matrix from which a linear code can be constructed?

Ok, good!

> The reason to put back `wtdist_gap` as it was, is to allow for users to get accustomed to the changes, right? That's why we need all the redirects. 

Exactly. In Sage, whenever you change something, you have to be retrocompatible with the old feature for a year.

> Do we want that `spectrum` also call `wtdist_gap()` which then calls `_spectrum_from_gap()`? Or can `spectrum` directly call the latter? 

`spectrum` can directly call `_spectrum_from_gap`. With all these deprecation warnings, the general rule is to allow the user to access the old feature for a year. So, as long as you still provide the old method/signature/output, replacing the old stuff everywhere else is fine.


> The original wtdist_gap took the generator matrix in a gap string format. Is it possible to reconvert this representation into a regular generator matrix from which a linear code can be constructed? 

Yup, for instance:

```
sage: M = matrix(GF(7), [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
sage: Mg = M._gap_()
sage: Ms = Mg._matrix_(GF(7))
sage: Ms == M
True
```

Usually, I just delete the old documentation and leave only the code of the old method.
See for instance what I did with `ReedSolomonCode` in `code_constructions.py`.

My argument is the following: as it's an old feature we keep only for retrocompatibility purposes, I don't see the point of keeping its documentation. Indeed, users which have old code using the deprecated feature already know how the old method works and are using it correctly, so they don't need the documentation. On any other case, people are not supposed to use the old feature, and maintaining proper documentation for an old feature might confuse them and lead them to use it - while we don't want them to do that!

That's fine, don't worry!

Hello,

One last tweak: l. 530 in `linear_code.py`, `references := ...` became `:3references := ...` I assume it's a typo.
Can you fix it please?
Otherwise, tests passes and I agree with your changes, so as soon as this typo is fix, I'll give this ticket a `positive_review`.

Well done!

David

If you're using vim, it might be a `:w` which ended up as a `:3`
This kind of stuff happens quite often :)

Sorry, done now.

BTW, the patchbot says "tests failed" but it's in a completely unrelated file (`intefaces/qepcad.py`) so I don't think it's because of this ticket. I'm resetting it to `needs_review`.
