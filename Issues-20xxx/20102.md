```
Currently we have the following behavior:

```
sage: (gamma(x)^2).series(x==0, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: psi_eval(): simple pole
sage: (zeta(x)^2).series(x==1, 2)
(Infinity) + (Infinity)*(x - 1) + Order((x - 1)^2)
sage: (tan(x)^2).series(x==pi/2, 2)
(Infinity) + (Infinity)*(-1/2*pi + x) + Order(1/4*(pi - 2*x)^2)
```

This is fixed in the current development version of pynac, see https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/135. This ticket shall add corresponding doctests.

Well, this took quite some time: I just saw that I never finished the work on this ticket, but I'd like to have these series expansions documented and tested.

Here is a new branch adding these particular doctests.
