Failures are pretty bad. We'll need a lot of fixing (and these things are basically all bugs!)

One of the doctest failures is actually just documenting that comparison is bogus: [numberfield.py:394](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py?id=7aca11920ce4e5f5b02f6c89adc0ae59213940fd#n394) so that one is not so bad.

Isn't the whole idea that there is *no* default sorting function? If you mean making convenient key functions readily available, then: yes. I expect we'll need them to fix doctests.

Comparing strings is not cheap at all because constructing the string representation is slow. It's better to stick with binary objects. Coefficient lists are much faster:

```
sage: L=[a^j for j in [1..100]]
sage: %timeit [str(l) for l in L]
100 loops, best of 3: 5.89 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [l.list() for l in L]
1000 loops, best of 3: 386 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [list(l) for l in L]
100 loops, best of 3: 9.92 ms per loop
sage: k=lambda l:l.list()
sage: %timeit [k(l) for l in L]
1000 loops, best of 3: 398 µs per loop
```

unfortunately, using "list(l)" is slow: it might construct an iterator out of l first, which would have much more overhead to get the whole list of coefficients than getting the list immediately. So either we optimize "list" so that `sorted(L,key=list)` works or we make `k` above available (possibly in a lower overhead version). Note that coefficient lists already come in the right order for power basis rep: integers look like `[*,0,...,0]`.

<div id="comment:11" align="right">Comment 11</div>

Question:  when doing something like sorted(v,key=list) where v is a list of nf elements in a *relative* number field, I suppose that the coefficient list elements are themselves nf elements which must be sorted somehow?  What is happening then?

As you know from the original thread, one of my aims in starting this was to get the isogenies in a fixed order.  Partly that is just so that we can doctest, since there is no intrinsic mathematical ordering on the set of isogenies from a given curve.  For this it would suffice to arrange for the doctest outputs not to be order-sensitive which would be rather tedious but a Godd Thing in the long run (as I think Volker would agree).

In situations were I do care about the order of the curves in an isogeny class, that is something which can be achieved elsewhere, in the code for the isogeny class itself;  the class could have one or more methods for sorting the curves in it, to be use by people who care (such as me).

I will do some work on this right now, just in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves, building on commit 77618de1e986c

I finished with the elliptic curves section, and uploaded the modified branch as u/cremona/20028.  

The principles I followed are:

1. Where there was sorting within the code, it is now always wrapped in a try/except block which result in no sorting when a NotImplementedError is raised.  For cases where sorting is available there will be no change.

   2. For the doctest outputs relating to isogenies, the outputs are now sorted using key=str except when the base field is Q, or where the list has at most one entry anyway.  This required changing some doctest outputs, mostly just the same but in a different order.  I may have overdone this in that over a finite prime field there was possibly sorting already in place making the sort with key=str unnecessary, but this is only doctest output anyway.

   3. A couple of other places requred additions of the try/except wrapping around sort operations.  This includes a place in the isogeny class code, on which I will do further work;  interestingly the only doctests which fail without that particular change is the one which caused this in the first place (CM curves w.r.t an order of class number 6).

Hi!

I think the failure in projective_morphism.py comes from projective_homset.py, where a set is now unexpectedly returned instead of a list in the points function for fields. The try block that was added in projective_homset.py prevents `sorted(points)` from executing in line 138 and `sorted` changes the type of points from a set to a list. Changing `return points` to `return list(points)` in line 141 seems to address the problem.

For the code in projective_morphism.py (lines 3003-3011) in the first line a list is declared but is never used (I think it is an artifact from a previous implementation attempt that wasn't caught). As far as I can tell, the rest of the code is working properly. Is there a problem with its functionality that I've missed?

OK, we'll do that.  (It is odd to me that sorted(X) has the side effect of changing a set to a list, but now that we know that we just make it into a list regardless of whether we are able to sort it.)

I'll update the branch on this ticket accordingly.

I agree that these are ugly.  We can either try to get the current patch reviewed, or look to see how bad things would be if we were to remove those.  I will start on that for elliptic curves, but do not want to delay progress.

After removing these try/except blocks in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves:

```
sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/cm.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_torsion.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/isogeny_small_degree.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_modular_symbols.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_field.py  # 8 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py  # 5 doctests failed

sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_number_field.py  # 32 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py  # 6 doctests failed
```
which I hope can be resolved easily....nearly done... the files with lots of failures are becuase I deleted one line too many (forgot to set self.curves in the isogeny class code over number fields) so in fact it is not so bad at all).

The wonders of python's ducktyping: "sorted" accepts an iterable and returns the contents of the iterable as a sorted list. A finite set is an iterable. It would certainly be useless if it returned a set, since then the sorting work was all for naught (sets are hash tables underneath in python, so they really don't preserve any kind of order).

> but now that we know that we just make it into a list regardless of whether we are able to sort it.

Uhm. I don't have a problem returning things in a list in no particular order, but actively turning something that comes naturally in a set into a list just for the sake of it sounds wrong. If the routine you're getting your data from returns a set, perhaps you should too? or perhaps that routine benefits from returning a list instead? This doesn't necessarily need to be resolved here, but bear in mind that postponing a cleaner resolution is the process through which cruft builds up in sage.

**EDIT:** OK, I see now what's going on. There's a lot unnecessary work: Once you've found the points on one affine patch, you should determine the points on the hyperplane at infinity (and repeat the process there). Then there's no reason for "points" to be a set in the first place, because you'll be finding them without duplication.

Do you want me to give my interpretation of the traceback that shows where the failure occurs?

The relevant branches are:\n\n```\n        try:\n            if K.is_integral_domain():\n                ...\n                return self._roots_from_factorization(self.factor(), multiplicities)\n            else:\n                raise NotImplementedError\n        except NotImplementedError:\n            ...\n            raise NotImplementedError(\"root finding for this polynomial not implemented\")\n```\nWith the change, \"self.factor()\" indirectly raises `NotImplementedError` from the `sort`.

I am not quite sure what you mean by "explain". Do you want me to give my interpretation of the traceback that shows where the failure occurs? In that case:

The error happens in `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.pyx:6533`, in `Polynomial.roots`. The relevant branches are:

```
        try:
            if K.is_integral_domain():
                ...
                return self._roots_from_factorization(self.factor(), multiplicities)
            else:
                raise NotImplementedError
        except NotImplementedError:
            ...
            raise NotImplementedError("root finding for this polynomial not implemented")
```
With the change, "self.factor()" indirectly raises `NotImplementedError` from the `sort`. The really appropriate solution would be to just not sort in `self.factor` at all, because in general there's no way to sort. But I suspect the number of doctests that need to be adjusted would be very unpleasant. So I'd go with the "best effort sorting attempt" of a `try` here.

You can see two things here:
- Python's try/except invites a rather coarse-grained error selection here. Python advocates EAFP over LBYL (ask forgiveness rather than look before you leap) and it has advantages in systems programming, where error conditions can be transient, but I think it's a poor match for mathematics programming, exactly for this kind of poorly matched interactions.
- If you raise an error in an except, you should use a bare `raise` unless you have a very good reason not to. Getting the original error here is way more informative (and cheaper!) than this newly constructed error.

One option for `factor` would be to make the `sort` keyword tri-state: `True/False/Try`, where False is no sort, True is sort (and error if that doesn't work) and Try (which would be the default for backwards compatibility) to try and be quiet about failure to sort. Then people can ask for `sort=True` if they want to rely on the answer being in a particular order. The `sort=Try` option would have no value other than giving a little nicer output in some cases. This may well be overengineering and it's clear what would happen: everybody would just use the default "Try" and rely on the order being the same every time (and be surprised if it's not).
