There are no current way to compute the spectral radius of a graph (the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix). We provide a method `spectral_radius` that provides an interval of floating approximations.

It is much faster than previously available methods (where the exact methods are unusable because of characteristic polynomial computation)

```
sage: G = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNM(10,40)
sage: %timeit max(G.adjacency_matrix().charpoly().roots(AA, multiplicities=False))
100 loops, best of 3: 6.23 ms per loop
sage: %timeit G.spectral_radius()
1000 loops, best of 3: 178 Âµs per loop
```
And for a larger graph

```
sage: G = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNM(400, 6000)
sage: %timeit max(G.adjacency_matrix().charpoly().roots(AA, multiplicities=False))
1 loop, best of 3: 4.63 s per loop
sage: %timeit G.spectral_radius()
10 loops, best of 3: 13 ms per loop
```
The new method `spectral_radius` can be used for much larger graph as soon as the spectral gap is large enough to ensure the convergence.

Is there a reason for not using Sage's interval arithmetic?
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings_numerical/sage/rings/real_mpfi.html
Sage's interval library is already taking care of lowlevel floating point rounding problems, and could remove complexity from the function.
Apart from this everything looks fine.

Hello Maurizio,

Thanks for having a look!

Interval arithmetic does not use machine floating point but [mpfr](http://www.mpfr.org/). It would be much slower than the version I wrote. This would only be a constant time slower which on my computer seems to be a factor `x8`. The intended application of this method is for huge sparse graphs (let say with `~1000000` vertices) and a `x8` speedup is not negligible. Similarly, I could have used ball arithmetic [arb](http://fredrikj.net/arb/) which is also shipped with Sage (and should be faster than interval arithmetic).

Moreover, it is a certain amount of work to write `matrix/vector` code using either `mpir` or `arb`. Using `mpir` or `arb` would also decrease readability since multiplying numbers with `mpfr` is done via `mpfr_mul(x, a, b, MPFR_RNDN)` which is much less readable than `x = a*b`. Though the approach using either mpir or arb would have the advantage of making available higher precision. This would indeed be interesting for small graphs.

On the other hand, the function I made is written in C. It is not reasonable to use the Cython wrapper we have in Sage as allocating/deallocating million of Python classes is expensive.

The only thing that can easily be done would be to return an element in `RIF` instead of a tuple of Python float.

What I wrote is not the "best and fastest algorithm" to get the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue. For example, it suffers from slow convergence in absence of spectral gap. But it was very helpful to me and might as well be helpful for others. I consider than having an arbitrary precision version using `mpfr`, `mpir` or `arb` would be indeed good for another ticket.

Moreover, it is not immediate to determine what is the precision needed for the computation to obtain a given precision for the answer.

I need to fix a mistake (the condition in the loop should be `(e_max - e_min) > e_max * c_prec` instead of `e_max * (e_max - e_min) > c_prec`). I would also like to move the `sage_free` inside the `finally` block (to avoid unfreed memory). I am waiting for your comments before submitting the commit.
