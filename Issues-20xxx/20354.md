```
PPL's solver is a rational *MIP* solver. 
Its support for integer variables should be exposed in Sage.
#20351 does this for the PPL wrapper classes.

This ticket updates the `PPLBackend` class.

This idiosyncratic interface (including the documentation that says that the default value of 'continuous' is True) matches that of the other backends. 
I would probably express this by making all arglist-default `None` to indicate complicated defaulting semantics. But it's not the job of this ticket to make changes throughout all backends.

but this is a line from your update, why do you set `continuous=False`?

<a id='comment:8'></a>
No, `continuous=True` in the arglist cannot work
because then one cannot distinguish 
- `add_variable(..., binary=True)` (which should create a binary variable)
- `add_variable(..., binary=True, continuous=True)` (which should raise an error).
All backends implement the defaulting to continuous variables imperatively.

Previously it did not matter because the PPL backend was simply ignoring these parameters altogether.

(I've added a dicussion of this interface to ticket #20324.)

I agree; at least it matches `is_variable_continuous` etc.; but see `set_variable_type`, which expresses the same thing using 1, 0, -1. 
It's one of several idiosyncrasies of the backend interface.

Sounds good; I have created ticket #20362 for this. Let's move further discussion of backend interface redesign there.

In the meantime, this ticket still needs review.
