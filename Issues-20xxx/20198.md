```
With the recent sub-classing framework for linear codes, it is now often useful to recast a code from some family as a generic linear code, thus forgetting its structure, e.g.

```
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(23).list(), 12)
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(GF(23)^7, 2)
sage: %timeit C.decode(Chan(C.random_element()))
<some short time>
sage: C_dumb = LinearCode(C)
sage: %timeit C_dumb.decode(Chan(C_dumb.random_element()))
<loong time>
```

Except the above code doesn't work, since `LinearCode` expects a matrix, and can't understand a code as input.

Note that the provided example (ignoring the part relating to the requested functionality) never worked. We have:

```
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(23).list(), 12)
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(GF(23)^7, 2)
sage: C.decode(Chan(C.random_element()))
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: Message must be an element of the input space for the given channel
```

Perhaps you meant something more like this?

```
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(23).list(), 12)
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(GF(23)^23, 2)
sage: C.decode_to_code(Chan(C.random_element())) # using the superseding decode_to_code function
(10, 17, 5, 20, 9, 1, 3, 18, 8, 20, 13, 5, 20, 16, 12, 22, 18, 3, 13, 17, 11, 11, 4) # random
```

This doesn't affect my patch, unless you were to use this example to test it.

Awesome, thanks for the patch! I'll look at it momentarily.

You're right about my typo: it should have been `^23` and not `^7`. What do you mean "superseding `decode_to_code`" -- that method is not superseded (contrarily, that and `decode_to_message` both supersede `decode`).

Sorry I was unclear. I meant that ``decode_to_code`` supersedes ``decode``.

You still needlessly recomputed `basis` so I removed that, and also removed some other minor recomputations (which are probably cached anyway, but still). Other than that your code looks good and I accept it. I've run tests on `src/sage/coding` and it's currently testing the rest of the Sage lib, but I'm not expecting any problems. If you can accept my changes, just set to positive_review :-)

Best,
Johan

Ah sorry that slipped my mind! I looked over the changes you made and they're fine, I also re-ran the doctests on the updated file just to make sure everything's okay as a third-party. I'll set the ticket to positive_review :)

Thanks,
Charlie

P.S. Do we need to change the milestone to sage-7.2? I branched from sage-7.2.beta1 so we shouldn't need to merge anything in.
