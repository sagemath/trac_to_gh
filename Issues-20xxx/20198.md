```
With the recent sub-classing framework for linear codes, it is now often useful to recast a code from some family as a generic linear code, thus forgetting its structure, e.g.

```
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(23).list(), 12)
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(GF(23)^7, 2)
sage: %timeit C.decode(Chan(C.random_element()))
<some short time>
sage: C_dumb = LinearCode(C)
sage: %timeit C_dumb.decode(Chan(C_dumb.random_element()))
<loong time>
```

Except the above code doesn't work, since `LinearCode` expects a matrix, and can't understand a code as input.

Perhaps you meant something more like this?

```
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(GF(23).list(), 12)
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(GF(23)^23, 2)
sage: C.decode_to_code(Chan(C.random_element())) # using the superseding decode_to_code function

This doesn't affect my patch, unless you were to use this example to test it.

You're right about my typo: it should have been `^23` and not `^7`. What do you mean "superseding `decode_to_code`" -- that method is not superseded (contrarily, that and `decode_to_message` both supersede `decode`).
