There is an unneeded spaces after `=` at

```
print("Q = ", Q, ": Order(Q) = ", Q.order())
```

To other direction for example

```
if debug: print("n1a=", n1a)
```

has "missing" space. They were there before you, so I don't count them for reviewing, just a note.

I think that

```
print([z.quadratic_form() for z in y.conjugates_over_K()])
```

has unnecessary `print`. This is just a matter of taste.

Everything seems to be good. However, I am on slow machine now, so *positive_review* will be delayed until I got this compiled and tested.
