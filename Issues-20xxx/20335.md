This ticket proposes a new implementation for BCH codes.

It contains:

- a new code class, `BCHCode`,
- a decoder for BCH codes using the underlying GRS code of a BCH code
- an decoder for Cyclic codes using the surrounding BCH code of a Cyclic Code

<a id='comment:11'></a>Hi all,

For our review day, I push a cleaned version on this BCH code ticket. It's been modified according to the cyclic code ticket, I also fixed some merge issues and made doctests pass.

Yet I didn't check David's code in depth so I think it still need a review. Of course I can do that.
