The documentation of `restricted_automorphism_group()` of a polyhedron states:

```
   First, let the linear automorphism group be the subgroup of the
   Euclidean group E(d) = GL(d,RR) ltimes RR^d preserving the
   d-dimensional polyhedron. The Euclidean group acts in the usual way
   vec{x} |-->  Avec{x}+b on the ambient space.
```
However, this group is usually called the [affine group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_group). The [Euclidean group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group) is something else, containing the *orthogonal* transformations and translations.

We also fix caching of the method.

Of course the linear automorphism group of a full-dimensional polytope is contained in the Euclidean subgroup of the affine group. And the restricted automorphism group is just a trick to really talk about the full-dimenisonal polytope case, so the definition works with either ambient group. Still, the wording should be consistent.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A4):
> Of course the linear automorphism group of a full-dimensional polytope is contained in the Euclidean subgroup of the affine group.


No, it is not! This method really looks for affine transformations, not just Euclidean transformations.

Ok I forgot the "up to conjugation": the linear automorphism group of a full-dimensional polytope is conjugate to a subgroup of the Euclidean group.
