It seems as though when using plot() we are forced to have an aspect ratio of automatic whether we want that or not. Example:

If we define a class

```
class something:
    def plot(self):
        G = Graphics()
        G.set_aspect_ratio(1)
        return G
```

when we do something.plot() the aspect ratio is correctly set to 1. But when we do plot(something) the aspect ratio gets converted to automatic. This is due to the native way that plot is handled:

file: src/sage/plot/plot.py

```
@options(alpha=1, thickness=1, fill=False, fillcolor='automatic', fillalpha=0.5, rgbcolor=(0,0,1), plot_points=200, adaptive_tolerance=0.01, adaptive_recursion=5, detect_poles = False, exclude = None, legend_label=None, __original_opts=True, aspect_ratio='automatic')
def plot(funcs, *args, **kwds):
      G_kwds = Graphics._extract_kwds_for_show(kwds, ignore=['xmin', 'xmax'])
  
      original_opts = kwds.pop('__original_opts', {})
      do_show = kwds.pop('show',False)
  
      from sage.structure.element import is_Vector
      if kwds.get('parametric',False) and is_Vector(funcs):
          funcs = tuple(funcs)
  
  
      if hasattr(funcs, 'plot'):
          G = funcs.plot(*args, **original_opts)
      # if we are using the generic plotting method
      else:
          # Other things - deleted for clarity
  
      G._set_extra_kwds(G_kwds)
      if do_show:
          G.show()
      return G
```

Notice how the last option in `@`options is aspect_ratio='automatic'. The reason that this is the only one with an issue is the comination of Graphics._extract_kwds_for_show and G._set_extra_kwds.

When using Graphics._extract_kwds_for_show we are doing the following:
file: src/sage/plot/graphics.py

```
    SHOW_OPTIONS = dict(# axes options
                        axes=None, axes_labels=None, axes_labels_size=None,
                        axes_pad=None, base=None, scale=None,
                        xmin=None, xmax=None, ymin=None, ymax=None,
                        # Figure options
                        aspect_ratio=None, dpi=DEFAULT_DPI, fig_tight=True,
                        figsize=None, fontsize=None, frame=False,
                        title=None, title_pos=None, transparent=False,
                        # Grid options
                        gridlines=None, gridlinesstyle=None,
                        hgridlinesstyle=None, vgridlinesstyle=None,
                        # Legend options
                        legend_options={}, show_legend=None,
                        # Ticks options
                        ticks=None, tick_formatter=None, ticks_integer=False,
                        # Text options
                        typeset='default')

    def _extract_kwds_for_show(cls, kwds, ignore=[]):
        result = {} 
        for option in cls.SHOW_OPTIONS:
            if option not in ignore:
                try:
                    result[option] = kwds.pop(option)
                except KeyError:
                    pass
        return result
```

As you can see, we always grab these additional kwds, in particular we grab the 'aspect_ratio' kwd. This means that when G._set_extra_kwds gets called, the aspect ratio is changing AFTER we have already set it in our something.plot() method.

It seems as though this is not working as expected and/or there is some non-intuitive way to get around this issue.

Recommendations:
- We should only be doing _set_extra_kwds if we are NOT using the plot method of an object
- Or we should have some way to override this property so that if we are setting an aspect ratio, then it does not get forcibly overwritten as is happening now.


I'm thinking of doing the second one, where I do something of the following nature:

```
      if hasattr(funcs, 'plot'):
          G = funcs.plot(*args, **original_opts)
          for ext in G._extra_kwds 
              if ext in G_kwds:
                   delete G_kwds[ext]
```

Like this, if we are ever setting something beforehand, we are not unintentionally removing it as we are now.
Thoughts would be beneficial on this ticket as plot is a fairly common tool that is used in multiple places and so I don't want to alter something that might break other things especially if there does actually exist something that would get around this issue that I don't know about and/or if someone has a different idea of how to approach it.

Thank you.
