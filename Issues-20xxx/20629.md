One of the reasons why you might have started to see the import hell is that you imported a few things directly from the modules, rather than importing the entire module. In order to do the former, Python needs to evaluate the module at the moment you call the `from foo import bar`, whereas the latter is done when first calling `foo.bar` (not at `import foo`). This is why the "Pythonic" way is to `import foo` and then do `foo.bar`, but IMO, it just means we have to do more reading and/or work for maintenance.

Hmm, not sure I understand your conclusion. Did I do something "wrong" ? Should we try to use `import foo` as much as possible, or the contrary ?

I just started wanting to convert to python3-compatible imports, and then had to resolve
a whole lot of circular imports. I did that by moving some imports inside functions, instead
of being on top of the files.
