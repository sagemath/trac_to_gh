Hum, it seems that there is a problem with the **correct** python3 syntax

Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A24):
> Hmm, not sure I understand your conclusion. Did I do something "wrong" ? Should we try to use `import foo` as much as possible, or the contrary ?

I think you did the right thing. Moreover, this is in agreement with what we normally do in Sage. Does that clarify things?
