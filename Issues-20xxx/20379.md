At the moment the show method for matroids makes the visualization in the same way for every kind of matroid. This sometimes result in a real mess of lines, where it is hard to identify which lines actually belong to a certain point.

A way to help you figure this out would be to insert an option to identify a point of which the lines you would like to be in different colors. This would help you identify the the direction of the lines and if they actually go through this point.
