```
The method `minimum_distance` (and related method `min_wt_vec_gap`) can be improved in several ways, by:

- rewriting its documentation
- changing some names
- adding explicit error messages when the user uses the `Guava` option without
Guava installed on his system.

This ticket takes care of the above improvements.

I pushed the branch, which contains the following changes:

- renamed `min_wt_vec_gap` as `_minimum_weight_codeword`, moved it inside `AbstractLinearCode` (was a global method) and made it a private method.
- Rewrote documentation of `_minimum_weight_codeword` and `minimum_distance`, removed useless doctests.
- Removed a useless variable, factored some code.
- Added a proper check when the user calls `algorithm="guava"`. If the user does not have Guava installed, it will fail with a proper error message instead of some random GAP error.

This is open for review.

Best,

David

Hi David,

I merged what you've done previously and I checked that doctests pass. Everything seems ok to me. I give a positive review.
