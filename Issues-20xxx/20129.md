> Porting to said architecture shouldn't be mashed into every other ticket just because you are interested in it.


I obviously disagree with this... if a trivial accepted-by-upstream patch can be added, I don't see the problem.

And I don't see how it's relevant if Sage currently works or not on said architecture. Shouldn't we try to support as much architectures as possible?

Yes, but ideally by having one ticket per issue. And not delaying unrelated tickets until we can also stuff some porting effort in there.
