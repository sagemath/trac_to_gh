I never understood why you wanted a follow-up ticket for this...

I think it's completely normal to review a ticket by saying "X doesn't work, but after applying patch Y it does work, so please apply patch Y".

I obviously disagree with this... if a trivial accepted-by-upstream patch can be added, I don't see the problem.

And I don't see how it's relevant if Sage currently works or not on said architecture. Shouldn't we try to support as much architectures as possible?
