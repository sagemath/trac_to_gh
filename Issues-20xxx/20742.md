pynac-0.6.7 has:
* fix trig function arg reflection (#20752)
* fix Hermite / Gegenbauer evalf
* fix Py3 compile
* fix clang compile errors
* install pynac-config.h instead of config.h to prevent duplicate defines
* fix internal binomial of noninteger
* optionally use giac for GCD:
   * fixes rare GCD bug (#10284)
   * allow full symbolic GCD
   * increase performance by one order of magnitude (see https://github.com/pynac/pynac/wiki/Symbench-and-other-benchmarks#gcd-benchmarks

https://github.com/pynac/pynac/releases/download/pynac-0.6.7/pynac-0.6.7.tar.bz2

A minor hypothetical issue is that, although people with giac can switch off compilation of this code using the `--with-giac=no` configure option, the resulting binary will fail the one giac-specific GCD doctest because the doctests by default will still have the giac option turned on (because giac is still installed in Sage). You can work around this by giving explicit `optional` options to `sage -t`.
