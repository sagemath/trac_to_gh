<a id='comment:11'></a>I just thought about the following very simple algorithm for the multiplication (division is analogous):

To compute `(A/B) * C`, you initialize the result as `C/B`, canonicalize it and then multiply the numerator by `A`.

You don't need to canonicalize the final result, since `gcd(A,B) = 1` by assumption.
