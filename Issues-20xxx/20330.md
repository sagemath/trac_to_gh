sage: g.midpoint()'
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in __instancecheck__
```

It seems that the matrix is sufficiently complicated that it just runs up against the Python function call limit. If I run `simplify_full` on the matrix first, then it works (and I can even run in again to simplify it further). So this would be one way to hack around this.

Although we might benefit from having a special case for inverting 2x2 matrices using the explicit form:

```
[A B]^-1 = __1__ [ D -B]
[C D]      AD-BC [-C  A]
```
This would give another way around this (it should be faster and in some ways, more robust) as this code only deals with 2x2 matrices.

I had tried `simplify_full` (although I hadn't thought of applying it multiple times) but I am somehow disappointed with the solution even that it gets since the result is still too complicated (in the motivating example should have Re(z)=1/2 instead of the monster that it shows.
I am trying to understand the code to see how to get a simpler expression, if possible without resorting to `simplify_full` the result.
The transformation  S it uses to carry the geodesic to the imaginary axis it is not even recognized as an isometry by the model, fails the test `self._model.isometry_in_model(S)` (although the double 'full_simplified' expression successes)
Obviously works flawlessly with 

```
h=HyperbolicPlane().UHP().get_geodesic(2.0*I,2.0*I+1.0)
h.midpoint()
```

The matrix of the isometry that sends the geodesic to the imaginary axis is a symbolic array, when this matrix is numeric the algorithm evaluates efficiently but when is purely symbolic it is necessary a double full_simplify() operation so that the posterior operation of inverting the matrix does not get a runtime error. After profiling the code, I do not see (surprisingly) any speed advantage in coding explicitly the inverse matrix, so I decided to left that unchanged.

Hello,

Why in all this code the type of number is not preserved

```
sage: g = HyperbolicPlane().UHP().get_geodesic(CC(0,2),CC(1,2))
sage: type(g.endpoints()[0].coordinates())
<type 'sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber'>
sage: type(g.midpoint().coordinates())
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```
If I am using floating point number it is likely that I want to do floating point computations.

Since I was trying to fix a bug, I did not question the way the module was implemented in the beginning (I assumed it was discussed, and reached a consensus).
Taking a closer look, the effect you mention is caused by `_crossratio_matrix()` as in

```
sage: (p1, p2, p3) = [UHP.random_point().coordinates() for k in range(3)]
sage: A = HyperbolicGeodesicUHP._crossratio_matrix(p1, p2, p3)
sage: type(A)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_symbolic_dense.Matrix_symbolic_dense'>
```
even

```
sage: B = HyperbolicGeodesicUHP._crossratio_matrix(CC(1,1), CC(3,2), CC(2,2))
sage: type(B)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>
```
One thing we can try is to check the type of p1,p2,p3 and construct the matrix in CDF if we have `isinstance(p1,numbers.Complex)` using

```
return matrix(CDF,[[p1 - p2, (p1 - p2)*(-p0)],[p1 - p0, (p1 - p0)*(-p2)]])
```
What do you think of this approach? Any pitfalls ahead I am not aware of?

I correct myself the crossratio matrix is 
`<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>` 
it gets converted to symbolic when multiplied by 
`B = matrix([[1, 0], [0,I]])` 
so if we change it to 
`matrix([[1r,0r],[0r,CC(0,1)]])` 
we mantain the type to 
`<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>`
It is what you are requesting or it you require to get a 
`<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_complex_double_dense.Matrix_complex_double_dense'>`

In that case, will we have to construct

```
return matrix(CDF,[[p1 - p2, (p1 - p2)*(-p0)],[p1 - p0, (p1 - p0)*(-p2)]])
```
as mentioned before when the points p1,p2,p3 are instances of [ComplexNumber](../wiki/ComplexNumber) and leaving as it is in the rest of cases?

Which version of Sage are you using? On sage-7.2.beta6 complex numbers are perfectly recognized by Python `numbers.Complex`:

```
sage: import numbers
sage: isinstance(CC(0,1), numbers.Complex)
True
sage: isinstance(CDF(0,1), numbers.Complex)
True

It would be bad to use `CC(0,1)` by default for the complex imaginary unit. The only viable solution is to use the base ring of the coordinates

```
def get_I(a):
    from sage.structure.element import Element
    if isinstance(a, complex):
        return complex("j")
    elif isinstance(a, Expression):
        return SR("I")
    elif isinstance(a, Element):
        return a.parent().gen()
    else:
        raise ValueError("not a complex number")
```
It seems to work in most cases

```
sage: get_I(SR(1))
I
sage: parent(_)
Symbolic Ring

sage: get_I(QQbar(1+I))
I
sage: parent(_)
Algebraic Field

sage: get_I(CDF.an_element())
1.0*I
sage: parent(_)
Complex Double Field

sage: get_I(ComplexField(256).an_element())
1.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000*I
sage: parent(_)
Complex Field with 256 bits of precision
```

1. The following syntax is wrong

```
TESTS::

bla bla.

    sage: one_test()
```
  It should be

```
TESTS:

bla bla.::

    sage: one_test()   
```

2. You should get rid of trailing whitespaces, that is line that only contains spaces.

3. The `.is_numeric()` method only applies to symbolic expressions. There is something weird with your code `if S[0,0].is_numeric()` since you might also want to manipulate floating point objects.

Thanks for incorporing some (unrelated) changes for floating point testing.

There are still some issues with documentation

- The code in the tests/examples must be indented

```
TESTS:

This is a test::

    sage: 1+1
    2
```
  or

```
TESTS::

    sage: 1+1
    2
```
  (the same holds for EXAMPLES)

    if I.is_one() or (I*I).is_one() or not (-I*I).is_one():

Just as getting 0, 1, -1 into P is to construct them in the simplest parent (ZZ in this case) and converting them into P via `P(0),P(1),P(-1)`, constructing `I` in P should be a similar procedure. There is one solution that works most of the time via cyclotomic fields: `P(CyclotomicField(4).0)`\nIn a way, if that fails for `P` then `P` is probably not a good parent for this kind of computations.\n\nThere are some numerical noise problems with `CC(CyclotomicField(4),0)` which mightbe worth fixing.\n\nCurrently, `GF(5)(CyclotomicField(4).0)` doesn't work.\n\nCode along these lines could be a lot more robust for new parents than the special-casing approach taken now. I'm not quite sure we have suitable infrastructure for it to use it now, but perhaps we should (the main issue is of course that the choice of I isn't unique, whereas the integers convert uniquely into any integral domain)",

Once you've established which parent P to work over, you need a way to find `I` in there. Just as getting 0, 1, -1 into P is to construct them in the simplest parent (ZZ in this case) and converting them into P via `P(0),P(1),P(-1)`, constructing `I` in P should be a similar procedure. There is one solution that works most of the time via cyclotomic fields: `P(CyclotomicField(4).0)`
In a way, if that fails for `P` then `P` is probably not a good parent for this kind of computations.

There are some numerical noise problems with `CC(CyclotomicField(4),0)` which mightbe worth fixing.

Currently, `GF(5)(CyclotomicField(4).0)` doesn't work.

Code along these lines could be a lot more robust for new parents than the special-casing approach taken now. I'm not quite sure we have suitable infrastructure for it to use it now, but perhaps we should (the main issue is of course that the choice of I isn't unique, whereas the integers convert uniquely into any integral domain)

I am out of my field here, but if I understand you right, are you proposing to replace the elif block proposed by Vincent by something based on the CyclotomicField? Why is it more robust? aside of the problems you mention of `CC(CyclotomicField(4).0)` which may be should be accomplished on a different ticket

One way to check the sign would be to check the embedding in `CC` as `CC(custom_I) == CC.gen()`.

And an other way to find `I` would be `(-P.one()).sqrt()`... but currently there is no specification of this `sqrt` operation and sometimes you get a symbolic element where you do not want to.

```
sage: (-QQ.one()).sqrt().parent()
Symbolic Ring
sage: (-RR.one()).sqrt().parent()
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: (-AA.one()).sqrt().parent()
Algebraic Field
sage: K = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: (-K.one()).sqrt().parent()
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: K = QuadraticField(2)
sage: (-K.one()).sqrt().parent()
Symbolic Ring
```

I guess it is reasonable to have a temporary function in `sage/rings/`

```
def imaginary_unit(ring):
    r"""
    Return the imaginary unit in ``ring`` or in its algebraic closure if
    `-1` has no square root.

    If ``ring`` has a defined embedding in some complex field, then the
    imaginary unit is normalized so that its image in this complex field
    is its canonical imaginary unit.
    """
    ...
```
We could make it better later on and possibly remove if we find some other way. At the same time I would advocate that `.sqrt()` should return an element in the same ring or, if it is not possible, in its algebraic closure.

        else:
            raise ValueError("not a complex number")

        return matrix(P, 2, [one, zero, zero, -I])
```
fails when `a = QQbar(1+I)` resulting in

```
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

```
The offending code being the `matrix(P, 2 [one, zero, zero, -I])` 

```
sage: P = QQbar(1+I).parent()
sage: zero = P(0); one = P(1)
sage: matrix(P, 2, [one, zero, zero, -P(CyclotomicField(4).gen())])
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    TypeError: Illegal initializer for algebraic number
sage: matrix(P,2,[one,zero,zero,-P.gen()])

<class 'sage.rings.qqbar.AlgebraicNumber'>
I
sage: type(P.gen());P.gen()
<class 'sage.rings.qqbar.AlgebraicNumber'>
I
```
Do we have to open a ticket for that and leave this stopped or we leave the code as it is in the latest commit make it to the release and wait until the problems with CyclotomicField (numerical noise, and this particular matrix generation) get solved to open a new ticket on this module?
IMHO , the commit as it is solves the bug of the ticket (not introducing any new one) while both of your ideas go into the direction of a improvement of the code.
