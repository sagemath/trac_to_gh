Although we might benefit from having a special case for inverting 2x2 matrices using the explicit form:

```
[A B]^-1 = __1__ [ D -B]
[C D]      AD-BC [-C  A]
```
This would give another way around this (it should be faster and in some ways, more robust) as this code only deals with 2x2 matrices.

<a id='comment:6'></a>I had tried `simplify_full` (although I hadn't thought of applying it multiple times) but I am somehow disappointed with the solution even that it gets since the result is still too complicated (in the motivating example should have Re(z)=1/2 instead of the monster that it shows.
I am trying to understand the code to see how to get a simpler expression, if possible without resorting to `simplify_full` the result.
The transformation  S it uses to carry the geodesic to the imaginary axis it is not even recognized as an isometry by the model, fails the test `self._model.isometry_in_model(S)` (although the double 'full_simplified' expression successes)
Obviously works flawlessly with 

```
h=HyperbolicPlane().UHP().get_geodesic(2.0*I,2.0*I+1.0)
h.midpoint()
```

Why in all this code the type of number is not preserved

```

sage: type(g.endpoints()[0].coordinates())

If I am using floating point number it is likely that I want to do floating point computations.

Since I was trying to fix a bug, I did not question the way the module was implemented in the beginning (I assumed it was discussed, and reached a consensus).
Taking a closer look, the effect you mention is caused by `_crossratio_matrix()` as in

```
sage: (p1, p2, p3) = [UHP.random_point().coordinates() for k in range(3)]
sage: A = HyperbolicGeodesicUHP._crossratio_matrix(p1, p2, p3)
sage: type(A)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_symbolic_dense.Matrix_symbolic_dense'>
```
even

```
sage: B = HyperbolicGeodesicUHP._crossratio_matrix(CC(1,1), CC(3,2), CC(2,2))
sage: type(B)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>
```
One thing we can try is to check the type of p1,p2,p3 and construct the matrix in CDF if we have `isinstance(p1,numbers.Complex)` using

```
return matrix(CDF,[[p1 - p2, (p1 - p2)*(-p0)],[p1 - p0, (p1 - p0)*(-p2)]])
```
What do you think of this approach? Any pitfalls ahead I am not aware of?

<a id='comment:15'></a>I correct myself the crossratio matrix is 
`<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>` 
it gets converted to symbolic when multiplied by 
`B = matrix([[1, 0], [0,I]])` 
so if we change it to 
`matrix([[1r,0r],[0r,CC(0,1)]])` 
we mantain the type to 
`<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>`
It is what you are requesting or it you require to get a 
`<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_complex_double_dense.Matrix_complex_double_dense'>`

In that case, will we have to construct

```
return matrix(CDF,[[p1 - p2, (p1 - p2)*(-p0)],[p1 - p0, (p1 - p0)*(-p2)]])
```
as mentioned before when the points p1,p2,p3 are instances of [ComplexNumber](ComplexNumber) and leaving as it is in the rest of cases?

Which version of Sage are you using? On sage-7.2.beta6 complex numbers are perfectly recognized by Python `numbers.Complex`:

```
sage: import numbers
sage: isinstance(CC(0,1), numbers.Complex)
True
sage: isinstance(CDF(0,1), numbers.Complex)
True
```

It would be bad to use `CC(0,1)` by default for the complex imaginary unit. The only viable solution is to use the base ring of the coordinates

```
def get_I(a):
    from sage.structure.element import Element
    if isinstance(a, complex):
        return complex("j")
    elif isinstance(a, Expression):
        return SR("I")
    elif isinstance(a, Element):
        return a.parent().gen()
    else:
        raise ValueError("not a complex number")
```
It seems to work in most cases

```
sage: get_I(SR(1))
I
sage: parent(_)
Symbolic Ring

sage: get_I(QQbar(1+I))
I
sage: parent(_)
Algebraic Field

sage: get_I(CDF.an_element())
1.0*I
sage: parent(_)
Complex Double Field

sage: get_I(ComplexField(256).an_element())
1.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000*I
sage: parent(_)
Complex Field with 256 bits of precision
```

I am not at my installation right now (I'll check later). I tried the previous code in cloud.sagemath.com

```
sage: import numbers
sage: isinstance(CC(0,1), numbers.Complex)
False
sage: isinstance(CDF(0,1), numbers.Complex)

```
But then, maybe cloud.sagemath.com is not in the appropiate version. As I said I'll check later

I am out of my field here, but if I understand you right, are you proposing to replace the elif block proposed by Vincent by something based on the CyclotomicField? Why is it more robust? aside of the problems you mention of `CC(CyclotomicField(4).0)` which may be should be accomplished on a different ticket

<a id='comment:47'></a>One way to check the sign would be to check the embedding in `CC` as `CC(custom_I) == CC.gen()`.

And an other way to find `I` would be `(-P.one()).sqrt()`... but currently there is no specification of this `sqrt` operation and sometimes you get a symbolic element where you do not want to.

```
sage: (-QQ.one()).sqrt().parent()
Symbolic Ring
sage: (-RR.one()).sqrt().parent()
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: (-AA.one()).sqrt().parent()
Algebraic Field
sage: K = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: (-K.one()).sqrt().parent()
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: K = QuadraticField(2)
sage: (-K.one()).sqrt().parent()
Symbolic Ring
```

I guess it is reasonable to have a temporary function in `sage/rings/`

```
def imaginary_unit(ring):
    r"""
    Return the imaginary unit in ``ring`` or in its algebraic closure if
    `-1` has no square root.

    If ``ring`` has a defined embedding in some complex field, then the
    imaginary unit is normalized so that its image in this complex field
    is its canonical imaginary unit.
    """
    ...
```
We could make it better later on and possibly remove if we find some other way. At the same time I would advocate that `.sqrt()` should return an element in the same ring or, if it is not possible, in its algebraic closure.

Do we have to open a ticket for that and leave this stopped or we leave the code as it is in the latest commit make it to the release and wait until the problems with CyclotomicField (numerical noise, and this particular matrix generation) get solved to open a new ticket on this module?
IMHO , the commit as it is solves the bug of the ticket (not introducing any new one) while both of your ideas go into the direction of a improvement of the code.
