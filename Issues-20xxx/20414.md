```
The COIN, CPLEX, GLPK, and Gurobi backends supply a `copy` method. 
But it's not documented as a backend interface method in `GenericBackend`, and the CVXOPT, PPL, InteractiveLP backends do not implement it. 
It is used by `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.__copy__`.

The backend method should actually probably be called `__copy__` as well -- see https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html

The branch on the ticket does this.

We also add `__deepcopy__` methods to `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` and the backends. 
This fixes #15159, though the semantics of `copy` and `deepcopy` of a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` remains questionable due to its interaction with `MIPVariable`; see #15159 and #19523.

See also #20323 (in which copying a backend could be the basis for more diverse tests).

The branch is on top of #20323 (Common `TestSuite` for MIP backends).
The `_test_copy_some_mips` method exposed a bug in `CoinBackend`, which I have fixed on the way.

Before this patch, deepcopy didn't even copy the backend of a MIP. 
Now it does, simply by doing the same as copy.

Both copy and deepcopy have weird semantics in relation to the MIPVariables in a problems -- because a MIP does not have an API to gain access to its variables; and trying to use the old MIPVariables with the copy is questionable and definitely broken if one creates new components of this variable, see #15159, #19523. Fixing this would require a redesign; a possible stopgap would be to stop all MIPVariables from creating new components when they have been subjected to copy().
