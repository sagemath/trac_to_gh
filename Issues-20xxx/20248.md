```
This should work:

```
sage: R = Zp(5); K.<a> = R.ext(x^2 - 5)
sage: ((1+a)^2).polynomial()
(1 + O(5^20))*x + (1 + 5 + O(5^20))
```

Also, `_poly` in `sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.padic_lseries` should be updated to use this code.

A primitive version of this is the method `_poly` in `sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.padic_lseries` as introduced in #20254. When this ticket becomes available it makes sense to delete that function there and to replace its only use with the new function here.
