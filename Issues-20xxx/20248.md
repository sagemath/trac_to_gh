This should work:

```
sage: R = Zp(5); K.<a> = R.ext(x^2 - 5)
sage: ((1+a)^2).polynomial()
(1 + O(5^20))*x + (1 + 5 + O(5^20))
```

Also, `_poly` in `sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.padic_lseries` should be updated to use this code.

<a id='comment:4'></a>As of #14825,

```
sage: R = Zp(5); K.<a> = R.ext(x^2 - 5)
sage: ((1+a)^2).polynomial()
(1 + O(5^20))*x + (1 + 5 + O(5^20))
```
works.  But we should still make the changes to `padic_lseries`.
