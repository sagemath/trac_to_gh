#20837 tried to bring all spkgs into a uniform format for patches to the upstream sources.  In particular it ensures that all patches are applied from within the root of the upstream sources.

In the process I missed a few more packages that were a bit unusual.

The following packages were patching from a different directory than `src`:

* atlas
* mathjax
* ntl
* singular

The following packages were copying complete files instead of using patches:

* jmol
* tachyon
* rubiks: not in this ticket, see #21103

I have updated these packages to use the new "standard" patch format, so this can be considered a followup to #20837.  Fixing this is needed for #20692 to be completed.

With tachyon and jmol, the installed version with this branch is the same before this branch (as far as I can tell). So this is fine too.

Rubiks on the other hand has substantial changes, probably because of a different `Makefile`. I cannot immediately tell whether they are fine.
