#20837 tried to bring all spkgs into a uniform format for patches to the upstream sources.  In particular it ensures that all patches are applied from within the root of the upstream sources.

In the process I missed a few more packages that were a bit unusual.

The following packages were patching from a different directory than `src`:

* atlas
* mathjax
* ntl
* singular

The following packages were copying complete files instead of using patches:

* jmol
* tachyon
* rubiks: not in this ticket, see #21103

I have updated these packages to use the new "standard" patch format, so this can be considered a followup to #20837.  Fixing this is needed for #20692 to be completed.

The four packages which just have their directories changed are fine.

With tachyon and jmol, the installed version with this branch is the same before this branch (as far as I can tell). So this is fine too.

Rubiks on the other hand has substantial changes, probably because of a different `Makefile`. I cannot immediately tell whether they are fine.
