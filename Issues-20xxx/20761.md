When trying to compile sage with py3, the first failing point
is currently caused by the use of "cmp" in some pyx files.

This tickets aims to make a few more pyx files compile correctly
by removing cmp in them. This can be considered as en experiment,
as this will have to be done on a larger scale later.

First of all, the following are 4 different independent things:

1. Getting rid of `cmp=` arguments to `sort()` for example.

2. Getting rid of the `cmp()` function.

3. Getting rid of `__cmp__` methods.

4. Getting rid of `_cmp_` methods.

The last is not needed because `__richcmp__` will call `_cmp_` if needed.

For the first 3, I really prefer to consider them as different issues and fix them in the order listed above.

sorry, but I am a bit perplexed here. My initial aim was to try to make more pyx files compile correctly. My idea was that one should get rid of using cmp(a, b).

But I feel I do not understand enough the cmp mechanisms to do so properly.

Do you have useful concrete suggestions ? For example

```
git grep -P -c "cmp\(type" *.pyx
```
return something like 25 instances. What to do with them ?

1. **free_algebra_element_letterplace.pyx**, **semigroups_cython.pyx** and **map.pyx**:

`__richcmp__` bypasses the coercion model which is usually not what you want for `Element` classes. The rule of thumb is that any comparison/arithmetic of Sage `Element`s should use the coercion model unless there is a reason not to. Maybe for `FormalCompositeMap`, there is not much point in using the coercion model. But `FreeAlgebraElement_letterplace` and `LeftZeroSemigroupElement` really are elements where coercion looks useful.

The `_cmp_` and `_richcmp_` methods come from the coercion model, so you are guaranteed equal parents, which likely implies that both arguments are instances of `FreeAlgebraElement_letterplace`, `LeftZeroSemigroupElement` or `FormalCompositeMap`. In that case, you can just drop the type comparison.

2. The function **richcmp_shortcut**:

This should be removed and replaced by the standard Python function `PyObject_RichCompare`. For an example on how to use it, see `src/sage/structure/coerce.pyx`.

Thanks.

I have tried to make changes for your point 2.

I am not quite sure to understand your point 1. Do you suggest that in these 3 files I should replace double-underscored `__richcmp__` methods by single-underscored `_richcmp_` methods, and at the same time remove the check for type equality ?

Looks good.
