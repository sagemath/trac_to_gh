We have

```
sage: next(xsrange(0, 2^63-2^10+2^9))
...
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
```
This is because the internally used variable `count` is too large. We solve this problem by avoiding `xrange()`.

Besides this, we also move `xsrange()` and related functions to a new Cython module `src/sage/arith/srange.pyx` and do some clean-up.

An easy fix would be to bound this variable `count` (currently, it seems to be unlikely that more than `2^63-...` iterations occur...).
