Yes indeed.
`SAGE64` was used on strange archs where kernel is 64 bits but userspace is 32 bits by default, e.g. old OS X or Solaris.

Then we should make the `spkg` dependent on `python`.
Note that `ATLAS` install script also used `python` so there is no regression here.

That's quite lucky :)
Adding

```
from __future__ import print_function
```
turns `print` into a real function.
With your code it calls the magic `print` on `("...")` which turns out to have the same behavior in this specific case.

<a id='comment:52'></a>Isn't there a previous issue with the static archive in the log?
`touch` is maybe just here to update the timestamp...

We could/should also disable building a static archive.

This is a bug.  Sage meanwhile *requires* a system Python (>= 2.6) to build / bootstrap anyway.

And while ATLAS' `spkg-install` in some files at least claims to aim at compatibility to Python 2.4(!), I have some patches to make it work with Python 2.6 (in order to drop the dependency on *Sage's* Python, such that it is built **early**, almost first)...
