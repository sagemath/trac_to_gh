OpenBLAS should replace ATLAS as the **by default** installed BLAS since it is 
* (much) faster to install
* faster to run (on some platforms)

This replacement is mentionned in #17635 (upgrade fflas-ffpack) and is related to #19719 (upgrade ATLAS), and #17630 (clean up the BLAS).

That's quite lucky :)
Adding

```
from __future__ import print_function
```
turns `print` into a real function.
With your code it calls the magic `print` on `("...")` which turns out to have the same behavior in this specific case.

Nope, please don't do so.

`touch` is maybe just here to update the timestamp...

We could/should also disable building a static archive.

This is a bug.  Sage meanwhile *requires* a system Python (>= 2.6) to build / bootstrap anyway.

And while ATLAS' `spkg-install` in some files at least claims to aim at compatibility to Python 2.4(!), I have some patches to make it work with Python 2.6 (in order to drop the dependency on *Sage's* Python, such that it is built **early**, almost first)...
