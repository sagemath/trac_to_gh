OpenBLAS should replace ATLAS as the **by default** installed BLAS since it is 
* (much) faster to install
* faster to run (on some platforms)

This replacement is mentionned in #17635 (upgrade fflas-ffpack) and is related to #19719 (upgrade ATLAS), and #17630 (clean up the BLAS).

Sure. I should have been clearer: the idea is to
- change the default BLAS installed by [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) from ATLAS to OpenBLAS
- let the user the option to specify which BLAS to link against.
- simplify the current BLAS, BLAS2 variable mess

Very surprising.
Could you give the details on the host architecture where the numerical noise issues appeared (`uname -a` and `cat /proc/cpuinfo`)?
I could not reproduce them on my x86_64 sandibridge running linux-mint 14. 

Similarly for the 32 bit linking errors (it never saw it fail to compile on 32 bits ubuntu's). I could then try to find a similar arch and investigate it and/or report the problem upstream.

The buildbot machine with the link failure is Ubuntu 16.04 32-bit (in a VM).

As far as the numerical noise goes, the tolerance just needs to be incremented a a tiny bit.

Damn, this patch doesn't work as SAGE64 is not necessarily set to yes when compiling on a 64 bits machine.
After reading about the uselessness of SAGE64 on sage-devel, and browsing through MPIR's and M4RI's spkg's I don't find  any environment variable that would tell us whether the target architecture is 32 or 64 bits.

An option could be to copy/paste MPIR's long case switch setting ABI=32/64. Does anybody have a better solution?

Yes indeed.
`SAGE64` was used on strange archs where kernel is 64 bits but userspace is 32 bits by default, e.g. old OS X or Solaris.

Then we should make the `spkg` dependent on `python`.
Note that `ATLAS` install script also used `python` so there is no regression here.

I've just fixed the `print` so it would work on a system python v3 as well as v2.

As for [comment:39](#comment:39) : a solution using calls to `uname` is being used in mpir/spkg-install. It would be a good starting point to write a `testabi.sh`, but I do not feel confident enough with sage's build system to write myself.
I also find this solution rather complicated, compared to calling python's `plateform.architecture()`

If required, I'll rewrite the `spkg-install` in python, but as I noticed many other `spkg-install`s are in bash and make a one line call to python, I thought it would be ok like this.

That's quite lucky :)
Adding

```
from __future__ import print_function
```
turns `print` into a real function.
With your code it calls the magic `print` on `("...")` which turns out to have the same behavior in this specific case.

Isn't there a previous issue with the static archive in the log?
`touch` is maybe just here to update the timestamp...

We could/should also disable building a static archive.

And update openblas to 0.2.19 and hope the problem disappear...

Indeed on my machine, running `make tests` starts by touching the static archive.
No we have to devise why passing `BINARY=32` somehow prevents the required archive to be produced.

This is a bug.  Sage meanwhile *requires* a system Python (>= 2.6) to build / bootstrap anyway.

And while ATLAS' `spkg-install` in some files at least claims to aim at compatibility to Python 2.4(!), I have some patches to make it work with Python 2.6 (in order to drop the dependency on *Sage's* Python, such that it is built **early**, almost first)...
