We propose to implement in Sage the train-tracks package developed by Thierry Coulbois:

The main feature and the main achievement of the program is to compute train-track representative for (outer) automorphisms of free groups. phi.train track() computes a train-track representative for the (outer) automorphism phi. This train-track can be either an absolute train-track or a relative train-track. The celebrated theorem of Bestvina and Feighn assures that if phi is fully irreducible (iwip), then there exists an absolute train-track representing phi.
The train-track(relative=False) method will terminate with either an absolute train-track or with a topological representative with a reduction: an invariant strict subgraph with non-trivial fundamental group.
One more feature of train-tracks (absolute or relative) is to lower the number of Nielsen paths. Setting the stable=True option will return a train-track with at most one indivisible Nielsen path (per exponential stratum if it is a relative train-track).

I could be interested in this. Specially to add it as a functionality for Braid groups.

I have taken a quick look at Coulbois code, and it seems that it was writen before we had free groups in sage (or at least, he writes his own implementation of free groups).

So my impression is that we would need to heavily adapt his code in order to fit our current infrastructure. 

If you are ok with it, we can start discussing which should be the right structure to follow.

Hi,

Thanks for your comment. We are still working on train-track adaptation for sage, format code, checked test , that takes more time that I expected were I opened the ticket ... Indeed our main issue is the FreeGroup implementation (we have already do some change comparing to the train-track code of Thierry) but we have still a reduced FreeGroup, and the compatibility  with the FreeGroup is Sage is not easy (same use functionality). 
We of course ok to start discussing about this issue and we wish to find a light solution. The easiest  way would be to rename our FreeGroup but may be we can make something better. So we are open to any suggestion.
Dominique

Hello the Sage community,

I finally got a trac.sagemath account to reply !

Of course we need to use (and adapt) the existing FreeGroup in Sage. 

The main difference is my use of alphabets with inverse letters (AlphabetWithInverses in my program). There have been some discussions with Vincent Delecroix on my choices. I hope my code is not too poorly written and I can adapt easily. 

The point is that my free groups are to be used as domain of WordMorphisms and as such they should have alphabets (and not only generators)... The elements should be words.

May be we could discuss that by mail with Vincent, Thierry M. and Marco ?

Yes of course we can also adapt the existing FreeGroup to my code. For that I need to know how much it is used. In particular as it seems to be only a wrapper of GAP.

Apparently there are two different approaches:

1/ The present FreeGroup (from GAP) focuses on the fact that free groups are algebraic objects (they have generators and the elements are somehow abstract group elements)

2/ Whereas my approach is closer to that of Words: free group are combinatorial objects and their elements are words on an alphabet.

I don't know how much these two approaches are compatible. And how much we can merge or converge to a common approach. The differences are probably similar to that between FreeMonoid and Words.

Marco can you tell us how much your FreeGroup is used, how much it is important that its elements are from a GAP wrap class (ElementLibGAP) ?

Yes, I begin to understand, that I will need to use (and add functionalities) to the current FreeGroup.

The main difficulty is that I rely heavily on WordMorphism, in particular for parsing: 

FreeGroupAutomorphism("a->ab,b->aC,c->a")

And for applying or compose morphisms. These are heavily used in my program.

This suggest that I would like that my elements of FreeGroup are Word. Do you have any objection to FreeGroup also inheriting from Words ? And FreeGroupElement from Word ?

I guess that it is not too complicated to add Words and Word methods to your FreeGroup and FreeGroupElement. But will that interfere with deeper GAP implementations (I am completly new to GAP)?

Would that be satisfactory to Sage gurus that FreeGroup are both an algebraic object and a symbolic one ?

Finally there is also a IndexedFreeGroup class which is not a wrapper of GAP, how does it fit in this discussion ?

Hi all,

As Thierry says previously we decided to make the compatibilyty with the sage FreeGroup through the hard way,  used it and add functionnalities. Three or more module need to be rewrited,  when we obtain a first draft version I am pushing in in the sage ticket. So there no need for you to worry about a external branche.

Dominique

The doc is not yet up-to-date. 

I am currently working further. But please stop me if you believe my choices are stupid.

You will probably want to create a `FreeGroupHomset` (which you will need to add a `_hom_` method to `FreeGroup` to create this), whose elements are your `FreeGroupMorphism`, which can be constructed directly from the `hom` method.

A question: does your framework handle morphisms to free groups with different generator labels? If not, would it be easy to support this (and do you want to)? If also no, then don't worry about it.

Hello Dominique, Thierry,

There are two current problems (see the failing doctests of patchbot):

- the comparison between elements of the free group changed. Before we had the following order on generators `x_0^-1`, `x_0`, `x_1^-1`, `x_1`, ... But with your branch, because you use direct comparison on the Tietze generators, it became `x_n^-1`, `x_{n-1}^-1`, ..., `x_0^-1`, `x_0`, `x_1`, ..., I think the former was preferable. What do you think?

- there are a lot of failure related to the `free_group.py` being moved. You just need to change the occurrence of `sage.groups.free_group` by `sage.groups.free_groups.free_group` everywhere.

Hello All,

My last commits do not appear in the ticket comments:

- I did my best to remove failures that appear in the patchchboot log (the make worked on my computer strange behavior?), and improve tests coverage, that seems to be a blocked point.

- For the order generators in my sens the remark from Vincent was about the previous version of free_group but the train_track version because a lot of order changed with the use of free_ group generators of Gap. But maybe, I confuse and the re-writting of _cmp method also change the orther.

Best regards
Dominique

It was...

```
sage: F = FreeGroup(['a','b'])
sage: a,b = F.gens()
sage: l = [a,b,~a,~b,a*b,~a*b,F.one()]
sage: sorted(l)
[1, a^-1, a, b^-1, b, a^-1*b, a*b]
sage: F.one() < a
True
sage: a < F.one()
False
```
What is wrong with the above? It is first sorted by length and then (almost) lexicographically. This is indeed different from order on lists which is straight lexicographic.

> I do not know how the previous order was implemented (deep inside GAP ?)

 
It indeed used the gap comparison which seems reasonable to me.

We revert the doc-tests (that we had previously modified) from sage/groups/finitely_presented.py which use this order.

All doc-tests pass.

Hi Thierry, Hi Dominique,

The behavior is certainly documented in GAP. It might be worth to also have it (and test it) inside Sage. I am looking at the other pieces of your code now.

I sent a question to https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35988/patchboot-coverage-failure-and-review/
because I do not know what to do to fix it.


Hi sage team, My ticket #20154: train-tracks in public/train-track, is in need-work status, I guess the issue comes from coverage. But I do not see the fie ext/interpreters/wrapper_cc.pyx in my distribution , and for me this file doesn't belong to the ticket (that was true previously whent the patchboot works). I have absolutly no idea how to fix it, could you please tell me what to do to fix it and succes the review.

Thanks Dominique

The problem now is that you need to rebase your branch on the latest beta, because there is a conflict (this make the branch red at top of the present page)

Because you are not yet trusted, I have to launch my personal bot manually. 

Result:

* some failing doctests
* some bad unicode character (maybe add uft8 declaration at top of file ?)
* need to replace <type 'str'> by <... 'str'> for python3 compatibility

Hi,

Thanks for your update for  the new version 8, Unfortunately my version obtained by  pull is not working, I do not understand what happens.

Otherwise I would like  to succes the  review, and I would know what is missing, and I can do.


Thanks for help

Dominique

Hi,

I done the rebase and the correction for INPUT intems end with . only where there are long.
Tell me if it is ok for a need review now

Still a lot of doc issues (see also[comment:19](#comment%3A19)):

- You need to replace `$` with ```.
- What does `\index{Nielsen path}` do? I think it will not do what you want with the build documentation.
- Are the macros `\CVN` and `\FN` defined? If not, you probably want to replace them with the corresponding true Latex code (rather than add to the macro list).
- Use `\ZZ` instead of `\mathbb Z`.
- References should go in the master reference file `doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` and have more descriptive names.
- Format like:
  {{{
  def foo(self):
      """
      Short description.

      ...
      """
  }}}
- Your ascii art square for `ConvexCore` should be `is of the form::` (with a double colon). Although having spaces here will be better than the `.`. The doc should not have any trouble getting this to look nice.
- There are a number of variables that should be either formatted for latex (``x``) or code (```x```). In particular, things like ```False``` should be code formatted.
- It is better to put inputs for `__init__` in the class-level docstring so it will be visible.

Some code issue I noticed on a quick readthrough:

- It would be good to provide some sort of deprecation warnings for all non-hidden functions/classes (i.e., not `_lexi_gen`). See the deprecation option of `lazy_import`.
- Use new-style Python clases: `class ConvexCore(object):`. Although can the user ever see it? If so, perhaps it should inherit from `SageObject`.
- Never check things like `if x is True:` (resp. `False:`); simply do `if x:` (resp. `if not x:`).
- It is faster to check `if todo:` instead of `if len(todo) > 0`.
- Instead of `__str__`, if it is a SageObject subclass, you should use `_repr_` (e.g., subclasses of `DiGraph`). Otherwise, we prefer to use `__repr__`.
- `groups/free_groups/test_train_track.py` might be better as `tests/train_tracks.py`.
