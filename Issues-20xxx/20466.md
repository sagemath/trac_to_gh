There has been some reimplementation on here, so maybe this is no longer true, but [this ask.sagemath post](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/33131/coercion-on-continued-fractions/) anyway points out

```
sage: x = continued_fraction(pi)
sage: y = 3*x
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Integer Ring' and '<class 'sage.rings.continued_fraction.ContinuedFraction_real'>'
```

**CC:**  @videlec @slel tmonteil

**Keywords:** continued_fraction
