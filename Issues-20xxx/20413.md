Follow-up on #20296, #20311, #20301. 
Updating `InteractiveLPBackend` to:
- use the standard-form transformation,
- simplify its code slightly by making use of the new `objective_constant_term` handling in `InteractiveLPProblem`
- make the example of optimizing over the dodecahedron more natural and remove use of backend methods.
- change default `base_ring` to QQ -- a much saner default because it's so much faster

I have not done any benchmarking, neither with real solvers, nor between your two dictionary implementations. This could be a nice class project. 
I have chosen the revised dictionary because that's what one "should" do. I suppose if one does the benchmarking, one will see the expected result that the revised method is faster when the number of nonbasics is large enough.

I wrote `InteractiveLPBackend` because I needed a solver for some very small LPs with irrational algebraic data (unrelated to the example in the doctest!), for which there is simply no alternative solver available.

At the moment, `InteractiveLPBackend` chooses `AA` as the default base ring, that's probably a bad idea (I'll change it).
If I change it to `QQ`, I get the following comparison:
