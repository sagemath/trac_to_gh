I solved the problem on Mac OS X with the following patch for Polymake, which gets rid of various "-arch" options. The "-arch" options caused the above errors "register %rbp is only available in 64-bit mode" etc.

Yes, I also get a few of those, but the polymake install goes through after that. Details of the 'bundled extensions' can be found in the package build directory (`$SAGE_LOCAL/var/tmp/sage/build/polymake-3.0r1/src/build.darwin.x86_64/bundled.log`):

```
Configuration of the following bundled extensions failed, proceeding without them.
If you really need them, please carefully read the following explanations,
take the suggested actions, and repeat the configuration.

---- bliss ----

Could not compile a test program checking for bliss library.
The most probable reasons are that the library is installed at a non-standard location,
is not configured to build a shared module, or missing at all.
The complete error log follows:

/var/folders/38/wnh4gf1552g_crsjnv2vmmww0000gn/T//polymake_25377_configure.cc:1:26: fatal error: bliss/graph.hh: No such file or directory
 #include "bliss/graph.hh"
                          ^
compilation terminated.

Please install the library and specify its location using --with-bliss option, if needed.
Please remember to enable shared modules when configuring the bliss library!

If you are running a Debian system and now see some missing GMP functions in the error message,
then you've got an old broken bliss package;  please upgrade it to the latest version.

```

I don't know what bliss is but I tried to install it -- but it gave me an error. Reported on #20871.

```
---- lrs ----

Could not compile a test program checking for lrs library.
The most probable reasons are that the library is installed at a non-standard location,
is not configured to build a shared module, or missing at all.
The complete error log follows:

Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "_lrs_ifp", referenced from:
      _readrat in liblrsgmp.a(lrsgmp-GMP.o)
      _readmp in liblrsgmp.a(lrsgmp-GMP.o)

  "_lrs_ofp", referenced from:

      _lrs_mp_init in liblrsgmp.a(lrsgmp-GMP.o)
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Please install the library and specify its location using --with-lrs option, if needed.
Please remember to enable shared modules when configuring the lrs library!
```

I do have lrslib installed. This needs investigating.

```
---- singular ----

Could not find 'libsingular-config' in path at bundled/singular/configure.pl line 36.
```

I think singular is standard, but there seems to be no `libsingular-config`.


```
---- soplex ----

Could not compile a test program checking for SoPlex.
Please make sure SoPlex was compiled with 'GMP=true' and 'SHARED=true'
and specify its location using --with-soplex=PATH.
The complete error log follows:

/var/folders/38/wnh4gf1552g_crsjnv2vmmww0000gn/T//polymake_25377_configure.cc:3:20: fatal error: soplex.h: No such file or directory
 #include "soplex.h"
                    ^
compilation terminated.

```
OK, yes, we don't have SoPlex. This is part of the SCIP Optimization Suite. (#10879)

Various of these packages do not come bundled with at least the minimal polymake distribution that the patch uses.
On your system, are they coming from the Linux distribution?

They might. I do have them installed on my Linux system. From the log, it is impossible to tell how polymake configure script actually finds bliss. I have one from the system and one in Sage. And with the very same version

```
$ bliss -version
bliss version 0.72
$ sage -sh -c "bliss -version"
bliss version 0.72
```

Oh yeah, fair enough!

I would say that having a sensible message when installing this package that says "here is what you will miss out on" would be worthwhile, but this shouldn't hold up getting this in so people have at least some polymake functionality.

I have committed the changes from [mkoeppe](#comment%3A17) for Mac OS X.
I have merged the branch for #20894, because polymake won't build without it on Mac OS X.

Didn't merge #20886 -- reviewers are asked to test this too.

this appears to contradict the need for Perl 5 package, at #20894.

Not really. #20894 adds the one missing bit that is not standard on OS X and which is "tricky to install".

That's too bad about the bliss package on Sage.  How easy is it to install some of those non-Sage package things on OS X?   (I'm  not planning to test this, just asking in case that will be useful to users.)

Also,

```
+Also this old-style Sage package can be installed for a more
+featureful Polymake installation:
+ sage -p qhull
+
+Software that would need to be installed manually (no Sage package
+ available) for a more featureful Polymake installation:
+ azove,
+ porta,
+ vinci,
+ SplitsTree4,
+ bliss 
```
Should this information be in a place beyond the SPKG.txt, which after all no one except developers will read?  (And then could be put in a md or rst format...)  Sorry for the interloping.

It is a word in more featureful versions of the English language ;)

It depends. Ideally we should probably have Sage packages -- this is now task ticket #20977.

Well, 

```
sage -info polymake
```
would display this information. 

I guess it would make sense to generate some documentation from it automatically. I'm not sure if the existence of packages is advertised anywhere except in the source tree. I always just try "sage -i PACKAGENAME" and when it starts looking for old-style stuff, I hit C-c.

<a id='comment:76'>Comment 76:</a>
1 - [pypolymake](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypolymake) is not ready to be considered as an optional package!

2 - the following is not allowed in `spkg-install` as it needs internet access

```
pip install --verbose --ignore-installed --no-deps pypolymake
```

I would rather stick to ship `polymake`.
