Couldn't we deprecate more? For example this works fine.

```
sage: CFF
QQ as continued fractions
sage: CFF.cardinality()
+Infinity
```
I would at least change the import for a lazy_import with deprecation in `all.py`.

That doesn't work because of #19628. The current branch gives a deprecation warning whenever an element of `CFF` is constructed. I think this is sufficient: you cannot really do anything useful with `CFF` without creating elements.
