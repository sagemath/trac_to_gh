I don't like these mindless mass-upgrade tickets since it gives a false impression that we can just upgrade without thinking about the consequences.

Especially for Jupyter-related packages, we really need to actually run Jupyter and check that stuff still works. It's not clear whether the author and/or reviewer of this ticket did that. Doctests are not sufficient for this.

Touché !

Last time I didn't insist on a dependency we had to add it later. 

Volker works on the assumptions that I may have add contact with most of those in sage-on-gentoo. Which used to be the case but since Volker has accelerated the rate it's a mixed bag.

We are now in a situation where Volker has just merged `ipython-4.2.0` and I don't have it. On the other hand I have `notebook` and `nbconvert` 4.2.0 and it is nowhere to be seen here.

As to `flask_babel` it has been in portage since the 11th of May but no user on ~arch complained about the problem Volker sees (may be not enough people running the doctests on ~arch).

To go back to properly testing `jupyter` do you have something in mind? A set of notebooks that would have to be tested or something?

A good start would be actually running the testsuites of those Python packages. Related: #19680.

In any case, as long as we do not have automated testing, those "nebulous manual incantations" will need to be performed.
