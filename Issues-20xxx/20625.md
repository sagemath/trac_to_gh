I don't like these mindless mass-upgrade tickets since it gives a false impression that we can just upgrade without thinking about the consequences.

Especially for Jupyter-related packages, we really need to actually run Jupyter and check that stuff still works. It's not clear whether the author and/or reviewer of this ticket did that. Doctests are not sufficient for this.

Touché !

Last time I didn't insist on a dependency we had to add it later. 

Volker works on the assumptions that I may have add contact with most of those in sage-on-gentoo. Which used to be the case but since Volker has accelerated the rate it's a mixed bag.

We are now in a situation where Volker has just merged `ipython-4.2.0` and I don't have it. On the other hand I have `notebook` and `nbconvert` 4.2.0 and it is nowhere to be seen here.

As to `flask_babel` it has been in portage since the 11th of May but no user on ~arch complained about the problem Volker sees (may be not enough people running the doctests on ~arch).

To go back to properly testing `jupyter` do you have something in mind? A set of notebooks that would have to be tested or something?

In any case, as long as we do not have automated testing, those "nebulous manual incantations" will need to be performed.
