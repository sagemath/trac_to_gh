It took a while to found commands for doing "eigendecomposition", also called "spectral decomposition", to a matrix. Hence I suggest adding those words to documentation of `jordan_form()`, so that next one will found them more easy.

Also "`Matrix.random(GF(3), 2)` never generates `[[2,0],[0,2]]`" must be changed to have `Matrix.random(GF(3), 2), algorithm='unimodular')`.

`matrix2.pyx`, `rref()` has error in link to "echelon_form".

I am not an expert, got this as a comment from a teahcer. Any expert of are here?

Numerical instability is another issue, and does not count if we do not use `RR` on other inexact base rign.

The page says "If `A` is not defective, then the JCF is the same as the eigenvalue decomposition." So yes, this should be rephrased.

I'm no expert, but afaik the terms “eigendecomposition” and “spectral decomposition” are used for diagonalizable matrices only, while the Jordan form is defined for all matrices (and coincides with the eigendecomposition when the matrix is diagonalizable).
