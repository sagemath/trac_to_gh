```
sage -i python3
sage -sh
python3
```
fails with

```
Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding
  File "/.../sage/7.1.rc0/local/lib/python/encodings/__init__.py", line 123
    raise CodecRegistryError,\
                            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

It seems the wrong path is used: the symlink `local/lib/python` instead of `local/lib/python3`. Changing this symlink to `local/lib/python3` makes python3 work, but prevents python2 from working.

Component: **packages: optional**
