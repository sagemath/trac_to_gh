The attached adds a patch to mpfr required for it to build successfully on Cygwin (no other guarantees beyond that it builds).  I have tested that this resolves the problem.  The original discussion where this came up is here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/c6mj0MxEovI/zl_7H7-fDgAJ

The patch came from:
https://github.com/Alexpux/MSYS2-packages/blob/master/mpfr/mpfr-3.1.4-1.src.patch

Upstream applied a slightly different patch.
Please report if it works.

I'm a little confused as to the outcome of this.  zimmerma proposed a slight different patch above, but then suggested that it's no longer needed?

Why was this ticket closed? Even if the issue has been fixed (somehow--it's not clear) upstream that doesn't mean it's fixed in Sage. A patch is still needed for now in Sage in order for it to build on Cygwin.

What happened here is as follow:
* this ticket proposed to integrate the Cygwin-folk patch, was positively reviewed and integrated to Sage git version (that's more or less what closed mean).
* in the meantime Paul was CC'ed to be aware of the need of a patch to build on Cygwin and ended up with a different solution.

So I think the next steps would be:
* check that upstream patch works well,
* open a new ticket to replace the Cygwin patch we currently ship by the upstream patch.

It may have been cleaner to wait for upstream decision to positively review this ticket, but the situation we are in now is still better than before: MPFR builds on Cygwin (and should still after replacing our/Cygwin patch with the upstream one).

jpflori,

Thanks for the overview.  What you wrote more or less matches my understanding, but where I was confused was that it wasn't obvious that my patch was merged into the main branch.  I guess that was was going on [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/20380#comment:12) where it reads "Branch changed from u/embray/mpfr-cygwin-patch to 76cb01574b70f6df2cb2b427bb57272f7c4605c8"?

FWIW the upstream patch in question is here: https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/viewvc.php/mpfr/trunk/src/mpfr-impl.h?r1=10257&r2=10260

It looks like it should work since it ended up removing the problem code entirely.  But I will still test and open a new ticket.
