The attached adds a patch to mpfr required for it to build successfully on Cygwin (no other guarantees beyond that it builds).  I have tested that this resolves the problem.  The original discussion where this came up is here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/c6mj0MxEovI/zl_7H7-fDgAJ

The patch came from:
https://github.com/Alexpux/MSYS2-packages/blob/master/mpfr/mpfr-3.1.4-1.src.patch

Upstream applied a slightly different patch.
Please report if it works.

<a id='comment:15'></a>What happened here is as follow:
* this ticket proposed to integrate the Cygwin-folk patch, was positively reviewed and integrated to Sage git version (that's more or less what closed mean).
* in the meantime Paul was CC'ed to be aware of the need of a patch to build on Cygwin and ended up with a different solution.

So I think the next steps would be:
* check that upstream patch works well,
* open a new ticket to replace the Cygwin patch we currently ship by the upstream patch.

It may have been cleaner to wait for upstream decision to positively review this ticket, but the situation we are in now is still better than before: MPFR builds on Cygwin (and should still after replacing our/Cygwin patch with the upstream one).
