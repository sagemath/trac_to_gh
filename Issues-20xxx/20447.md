How come you never run into trouble with the floating-point based solvers with this kind of code?

It is certainly ironic that the exact solver has more floating-point fuzz than the floating-point solvers. But your code cannot be correct if solver is a floating-point solver.

And there is an apparent upstream issue with GLPK. I wouldn't call it a bug, but given the design decision to return the exact values as double-floats, it should at least be improved to return all integers that have an exact representation in double-float as such.

- solver – the LP/ILP solver to be used. Defaults to PPL. It is arbitrary precision, thus there will be no rounding errors. With other solvers (see MixedIntegerLinearProgram for the list), you are on your own!

I don't think there is an API to check whether a solver is exact, and so I never bothered to check this in the code.

well, `is_exact` is a bit too much to ask, one merely needs extra precision.
(one can figure out how much, in fact). 
So you can use a backend that allows you to set the base ring to e.g. `RealField(2000)`.

Besides, I don't think there are places in Sage that forbid doing things cause they are "risky".

Perhaps you mean a `RealIntervalField` here, because certainly `RealField(2000)` does not guarantee that the result of some unspecified numerical algorithm such as the implementation of the simplex method in the solver leads to results with 2000 correct bits, just like double-floats don't guarantee 53 correct bits.

I think there more places should forbid things like that, or at least display a warning. For example, the polyhedral code in Sage is written in a way that it assumes exact arithmetic -- and if fed with floating point numbers, leads to mysterious errors. One would usually assume from algorithms that accept floating point numbers that they have some (however naive) accommodation for floating point fuzz, in the form of some epsilons.

The relevant code is in GLPK's glpapi07.c; it's using `mpq_get_d` to store the rational results in a double.

Actually, storing the rational results as doubles is fine, in fact I have a test in `glpk_backend` for that.
The error is happening when the big coefficients are converted into doubles, and then reconstructed by GLPK's exact simplex.

So there's no upstream bug to be reported -- except that we still really want GLPK to make the interface to glpssx.h public (#18765).

Guarding your code against floating-point fuzz is a wishlist item -- I'm marking this ticket as such.

No, #18765 is about making a "proper" rational GLPK API available.

I've changed the description of the present ticket to say what should be done.
