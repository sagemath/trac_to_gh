Keywords: lp

This is preparation for the cutting plane method (#18805 ), which needs to read out a row of the dictionary.
(Seems cleaner than having to do "leave(i), get leaving_coefficients(), leave(None)".)

The patch is also adding `@`abstract_method stubs for the methods that the concrete dictionaries need to implement.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20500

I am not convinced there is much point in abstract methods, which leads to duplication of examples and tests, but in any way:

- `leaving_coefficients` has wrong documentation
- `column_coefficients` has wrong documentation twice

Replying to [comment:5 novoselt]:
> I am not convinced there is much point in abstract methods, which leads to duplication of examples and tests,


I think it's quite nice in combination with `_test_not_implemented_methods` and as a documentation of the interface.

Fixed.

It would be nice if documentation of abstract methods somehow "propagated" to concrete implementations so that there were no copy-pasted duplication. But that's of course orthogonal to this ticket.
