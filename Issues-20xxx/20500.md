This is preparation for the cutting plane method (#18805 ), which needs to read out a row of the dictionary.
(Seems cleaner than having to do "leave(i), get leaving_coefficients(), leave(None)".)

The patch is also adding `@`abstract_method stubs for the methods that the concrete dictionaries need to implement.

It would be nice if documentation of abstract methods somehow "propagated" to concrete implementations so that there were no copy-pasted duplication. But that's of course orthogonal to this ticket.

I suppose one could copy `__doc__` from the abstract method to the concrete one, but I'm not sure whether the patchbot that watches over code coverage would be happy.
