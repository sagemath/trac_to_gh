This is preparation for the cutting plane method (#18805 ), which needs to read out a row of the dictionary.
(Seems cleaner than having to do "leave(i), get leaving_coefficients(), leave(None)".)

The patch is also adding `@`abstract_method stubs for the methods that the concrete dictionaries need to implement.

I think it's quite nice in combination with `_test_not_implemented_methods` and as a documentation of the interface.
