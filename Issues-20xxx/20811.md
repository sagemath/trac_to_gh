Implement classes for points on generic algebraic curves. Then implement singularity analysis functionality at the point level, such as `Q.is_singular()` and `Q.multiplicity()` for a point Q on a curve.

The implementations of the basic singularity analysis functionality at the curve level can be found in #20774.

These classes seem fine in how they are structured. Also, since the functionality is calling the curve functionality, that all should be ok. However, I did come across of few things I would like some clarification on. First some minor issues.

- no '.' for file title (first line)

- curve() function - I don't see the point for creating this function. That is what codomain() does.

- Return whether this point is or is not a singular point of the projective curve it is on.

Remove the 'or is not' since the boolean it returns is in relation to 'is'


---

Now for the more interesting questions:

- Does multiplicity() work for higher dimensional varieties? Or perhaps 'should' multiplicity work for higher dimensional varieties (just for points? or also higher dim subvarieties?) Maybe this is a candidate for a separate ticket.

- I was trying to test this with a less standard example, the multiplicities of periodic points: graph intersect diagonal in the product space.

```
PP.<x,y,u,v>=ProductProjectiveSpaces(QQ,[1,1])
G = PP.subscheme([(x^2-2*y^2)*u - y^2*v])
D = PP.subscheme([x*v-y*u])
Z=G.intersection(D)
Z.dimension()
```

What do you think, should intersection_multiplicity() work here? Since we're working locally in an affine patch, this should be reasonably doable. This may be a candidate for a separate ticket since it is also unrelated to the class structure.

Thanks, made the minor changes.

I think multiplicity() can be made to work for arbitrary varieties without much modification. It didn't occur to me before, but I don't think there's anything curve-specific about the definition of multiplicity that's currently used. Should I make a ticket to implement multiplicity() for higher dimensional varieties and points?

For intersection_multiplicity(), I was wondering if we might be able to make the current implementations a bit more general as well. Right now, we consider the varieties to intersect as subvarieties of their ambient space, but if I understand correctly, computing intersection multiplicity can also work if we replace the ambient space by a large variety that contains the two given subvarieties (though besides having the right dimension, I'm not sure what other conditions this variety would need to satisfy).

To implement this, maybe we could have an optional parameter to pass in a large variety, and then adapt the Tor formula computation by creating the needed ideals in the coordinate ring of the large variety (which could be an actual quotient ring) instead of in that of the ambient space. I tried implementing some of these modifications and so far they appear to be working.

I think if this generalization makes sense it could give another way to define intersection multiplicity for products. In the example you gave, `PP` embeds into projective space of dimension 3 via the Segre embedding, but the space is too big to apply the current projective intersection multiplicity implementation to the images of `G` and `D` since they each have dimension 1.

Do you think it makes sense to try generalizing intersection_multiplicity() this way?
