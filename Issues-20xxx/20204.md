In the Sympy-1.0 upgrade the `AppliedUndef._sage_` method is patched away to enable the important upgrade. This function was planned to resolve part of #14723 but uncovers problems with symbolics. The following doctest in french_book fails if `AppliedUndef._sage_` is defined:

```
sage: from sympy import Function, Symbol
sage: u = Function('u'); n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: f = u(n+2)-(3/2)*u(n+1)+(1/2)*u(n)
NotImplementedError
```

tscrim found the minimal cases:
> 
> ```
> sage: f = function('f')
> sage: x = var('x')
> sage: sympy.sympify(f(x), evaluate=False)
> f(x)
> sage: sympy.sympify(3*f(x), evaluate=False)
> AttributeError: 'Call' object has no attribute 'id'
> ```
> However, we do seem to have our own troubles of constructing SymPy objects from symbolic expressions. All of these result in errors:
> 
> ```
> sage: f._sympy_()
> sage: f(x)._sympy_()
> sage: (f(x)+3)._sympy_()
> ```


This means that Sympy-1.0 probably only uncovered already existing problems in expression conversion. This ticket should remove the patch in `build/pkgs/sympy` and resolve all mentioned problems.

See #20185 for all previous discussion on this.

Hi, any progress on this? We are currently NOT carrying Sage's sympy patch in Debian, so our Sage is running *without* this patch (and a few french book doctests break but we just ignore this).

In fact applying the patch, breaks some of sympy's own tests relating to Sage integration: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11858#issuecomment-308207891

BTW you do not need to rebuild Sympy to apply or unapply this patch, just edit /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sympy/core/function.py or wherever the file is installed to. Then restart sage (if you're testing Sage) or python (if you're testing sympy).

You mean how to delete a file from a git branch? use `git rm`.

no; i didn't know what are these `*.patch` files, how they are generated, how they are incorporated into sage.. Anyway, I'll `git rm 01_undeffun_sage.patch` later today!

OK and those patches get automatically applied into `/local/lib/...` upon rebuilding.

I've tested the patch in question. It solves one out of the two cases from [comment:5](#comment%3A5) :

```
sage: function('f')(x)._sympy_()._sage_()  # ok
f(x)
sage: function('f')._sympy_()._sage_()  # problem
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-7d5000a51aaa> in <module>()
----> 1 function('f')._sympy_()._sage_()

TypeError: unbound method _sage_() must be called with f instance as first argument (got nothing instead)
```

If we also want to transform from `UndefinedFunction` back to `NewSymbolicFunction`, then, that case should be addressed upstream in [sympy to sage conversion : Abstract function](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12826) too?

essentially there is this problem:

```
sage: from sympy import Function, Symbol
sage:  u = Function('u') ; n = Symbol('n', integer=True);
sage: type(2+u(2))  # wrong
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(u(2)+2)
<class 'sympy.core.add.Add'>
```

it gets fixed with the code in this comment: ticket:23496#comment:65

do you agree?

To document what happens in SymPy:

When `F=Function('abc')` is called the constructor of `Function` uses the metaclass `UndefFunction` to create a new class with parent `AppliedUndef` named `abc`. Calling `F._sage_()` will NOT call the `_sage_()` member of `AppliedUndef` but tries to call `abc._sage_()` which does not exist at installation time. This, however, is not a problem because we can dynamically add a `_sage_()` method to `abc` on creation of `abc` inside `UndefFunction.__new__`. So converting abstract functions works.

The problem is that now `F(x)._sage_()` will call the same `abc._sage_()` while previously it was referred to the superclass, i.e. `AppliedUndef._sage_()`. But `_sage_` as class method does not know about the specific instance and its argument `x`.

looks good to me. doctests in `src/sage/interfaces/sympy.py` pass and all (yes, all!) the issues in this ticket's description are solved. htmldoc is ok. let's wait that the patchbot changes the status..

the only oddity that i get (but maybe we shouldn't care?) is:

```
sage: from sympy import Function, Symbol
sage: u = Function('u'); n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: type(u(2)+2)
<class 'sympy.core.add.Add'>
sage: type(2+u(2))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```
