NOTE: This ticket is about changing the internal configure/install logic, not about changing behaviour.

"gcc" is a special Sage package because it's currently the only package which is either installed in Sage or used from the system if it's available.

In the future, we probably want more packages like this. It makes sense to mark all these packages as "standard" with some logic in `configure.ac` to skip the installation of certain standard packages.

I propose to define a *standard package* as a package which will always be available in Sage, either installed by Sage or taken from the system. The logic which is introduced in this ticket for gcc could be used for all those packages.

The following sentence in the developer guide is not understood (by me) conforming to the definition of the standard package:

**standard** packages are built by default unless ``configure`` determines that they are not needed.

Shouldn't this be like this:

**standard** packages are built by default unless ``configure`` determines that they are available from the system.

or something close?

Exactly, I don't really see the point. Moreover, I don't want to assume that this information is constant: it could very well be that Sage is installed and then the system is updated.

When I'm trying on the same machine, it works as it should.

Can you please keep the build directory (i.e. do not do a new build on that buildbot).

Normally, this `make` rule should have caused `bootstrap` to run, but it didn't:

```

Does the buildbot somehow mess with timestamps?
