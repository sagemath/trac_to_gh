Implements the invariant form for complex, non-real reflection groups.

The implementation currently uses the Reynolds operator in Lemma 1.3 in Lehrer-Taylor, but I am asking to follow the Cartan matrix in Chapter 1.6, as we have the Cartan matrix already available.

<a id='comment:6'></a>I merged the implementation as is into #11187 since it does work properly in the real case (using the Cartan matrix) and in the complex case (using brute force).

I would then use this ticket to figure how to do the Cartan matrix version in the complex case.
