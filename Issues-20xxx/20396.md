Implements the invariant form for complex, non-real reflection groups.

The implementation currently uses the Reynolds operator in Lemma 1.3 in Lehrer-Taylor, but I am asking to follow the Cartan matrix in Chapter 1.6, as we have the Cartan matrix already available.

I would then use this ticket to figure how to do the Cartan matrix version in the complex case.
