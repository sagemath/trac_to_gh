The reason for blacklisting GCC 4.8 in #20231 was to support #20226, but that's not going to be merged in Sage 7.2. So maybe it's best to still support GCC 4.8 in Sage 7.2 (maybe with a deprecation warning in `configure.ac`).

When #20226 gets merged in some later beta, we can then either re-merge #20231 or find a work-around to make it work with GCC 4.8.

I think the message should state more explicitly that GCC 4.8 support is *deprecated* and will be dropped on the next release.  Just saying it's "quite old" doesn't really say anything informative :)
