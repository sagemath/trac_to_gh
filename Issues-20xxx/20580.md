Instead of supporting a custom `_sage_doc_()` method, we should just use standard Python tricks to change `__doc__`.

This actually breaks in Cython due to some Cython bug(?) with decorators. While trying to fix that bug, I broke `@staticmethod` because of an unrelated bug http://trac.cython.org/ticket/880
