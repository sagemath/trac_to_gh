ok, let it be. The file partition_algebras is clearly in a "needs care" state, but
this is not for this ticket.

Yes, but it corresponds to the `PartitionAlgebra_ak` (with a different implementation of indexing set of the basis). Likewise with `BrauerAlgebra` and `PartitionAlgebra_bk` (although I'm not sure about the half version of the latter), along with `PlanarAlgebra` and `PartitionAlgebra_pk`.
