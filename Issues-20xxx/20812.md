If I try to take the derivative of an integer (or nonzero rational, or integer mod n), then the result is an element of the symbolic ring:

```
sage: R.<x>=ZZ[]
sage: derivative(0,x).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```
It seems like it would be more natural for the returned value to belong to the ring containing x instead.

This may seem kind of pedantic, but it did trip me up when I was working with a list of polynomials, some of which were constant, and things were getting cast to Expression unexpectedly.

I am not particularly familiar with the Sage codebase, but I am attaching a patch that seems to fix the issue.

If you take care to use the correct zero, this just works:

```
sage: R.zero().derivative(x).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring

But there is room for improvement, for sure.

<a id='comment:2'></a>The derivative of a symbolic expression is a symbolic expression :

```
sage: R1.<t>=ZZ[]
sage: derivative(x^2+x+1,t).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```


Therefore this :

```
sage: derivative(0,t).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```

is a special case, indicating that 0 is cast to a symbolic expression (probably by `diff`...).

However :

```
sage: derivative(R1(0),t).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring
```

conforms to the requirement that the derivative of an object belongs its parent ring.

Pedantism works both ways...

In order 

* to avoid introducing a //lot// of special-casing...

* to keep (at least an appearance of) reason : the differential of a "constant" does not make sense, whereas the differential of a function, expression or polynomial being respectively a function, expression or polynomial does...

...even when this function, expression or polynomial happens to be a "constant" or degree-0 monomial, in which case the derivative can be taken to be the null "constant" or degree-0 monomial.

Your remark may be more relevant in the reverse case:

```
sage: R1.<t>=QQbar[]
sage: foo=t^2
sage: integral(foo,t).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Algebraic Field
```

So far, so good. But

```
sage: integral(0,t).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```

is nonsensical, unless we mean to do implicitly :

```
sage: integral(R1(0),t).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Algebraic Field
```

In other words, take note that

```
sage: R1(0) is 0
False
```

even if

```
sage: R1(0).is_zero()
True
```

[ Snip... ]

> The patch that I submitted should significantly reduce  these types of errors.


Which patch ? I find no patch in the ticket.

More generally, I think that the problem is to //define// and //compute// "the smallest ring containing f and g".

To illustrate :

```
sage: R1.<t>=QQ[]
sage: t.derivative(t)
1
sage: t.derivative(t).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
sage: 1.derivative(t).parent()
## [ Snip... ]
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'derivative'
sage: t.parent()(1).derivative(t).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
```

This cast is reasonable and might be expected (i. e. one can reasonably expect `1.differential(t)` to return `R1`'s `0`.

Harder :

```
sage: R2.<u>=QQ[]
sage: t.derivative(u)
## [ Snip... ]
ValueError: cannot differentiate with respect to u
```

One might expect the `0` with : 
* this zero belonging to `PolynomialRing(QQ,"v1,v2")`, //and//
* some "automagic glue" realizing `v1==t, v2==u`.

I'm not sure that this can be expressed in Sage...

For the integrals :

```
sage: 1.integral(t)
## [ Snip]
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'integral'
sage: t.parent()(1).integral(t)
t
```

Again, a "reasonable" cast.

The case `t.integral(u)` leads to the same conclusion as for `t.differentiate(u)`.

And we might have worse difficulties : what should be the "smallest ring" containing `Zmod(3)['v']` and `QQbar['w']` ? Ditto for ring of matrices...

Casting to SR is, indeed, far from ideal, but it seems tome that the possible enhancements are fraught with more difficulties than they solve.

Your thoughts ?

It should be an error, because the integer zero is not a function.

But I guess that behavior is consistent with the usual abuse of notation. We convert constants to symbolic expressions so that they can be evaluated like a function. In this case, we convert `ZZ(0)` to `SR(0)`, and if you think of that as being the const-zero function, its derivative is itself with respect to whatever you call the implicit argument.

If this is your answer, then you should arguethat the derivative of **any** element of `Integer Ring` should result in an error.

> But I guess that behavior is consistent with the usual abuse of notation. We convert constants to symbolic expressions so that they can be evaluated like a function. In this case, we convert `ZZ(0)` to `SR(0)`, and if you think of that as being the const-zero function, its derivative is itself with respect to whatever you call the implicit argument.


Precisely, this ticket is changing that behaviour as it also make sense to take derivatives of polynomials, Laurent polynomials, power series, etc. If you find this behaviour consistent, then this ticket should not be merged at all.

<a id='comment:21'></a>I suspect the behaviour on the integers was installed to deal with some edge cases that happened interactively or perhaps internally in SR.

As far as I can see, `x.derivative(...)` is meant as an application of an operator to a ring element `x` and the argument `...` is taken as an indication what operator is meant. In particular, I don't think there is normally any effort to coerce the element `x` into a ring derived from the arguments `...`.

For instance:

```
sage: R.<a>=QQ[]
sage: S.<b>=QQ[]
sage: a.derivative(b)
ValueError: cannot differentiate with respect to b
sage: (a^3).derivative(2) #  2 means a repeat count here
6*a
```
In fact,

```
sage: 0.derivative(a)
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'derivative'
```
so the functionality here is just part of the top-level `derivative` convenience function. Indeed, it's behaviour is: first try method application. If that fails, try if coercing into SR works. I think the current behaviour is as intended: convenience for the casual user who isn't bothered by SR. Anyone who is worried about parents should be using method calls here, since they dispatch much better among types.

These convenience functions are just not a good way of dispatching on type data. You'd have to move to a different language then, that has full signature dispatch rather than python's "first argument" dispatch through method calls.

That's right.

These top-level convenience functions that take any sage or python object are always a mess. The principled approach is to use `x.derivative()`, and if that method isn't there, then you can't differentiate the thing. We only run into a problem trying to teach the top-level function how to differentiate things that can't be differentiated. In that regard, asking for consistency from the result when our goals weren't consistent to begin with is too optimistic.

So I think `derivative(ZZ(0)) = SR(0)` is as good as any answer for the derivative of an integer. But I also think that having special cases for polynomials and series is fine too. Since polynomials overlap partially (but not completely) with things that can be coerced into `SR`, I don't think we'll get a nice solution that is consistent in all cases.
