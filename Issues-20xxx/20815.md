braiding[1] is a C++ program writen by Juan Gonzalez-Meneses to compute several properties of braids. Specially related to the conjugacy problem in the braid group.

I did a fork of it[2] to convert it into a shared library[2].

The cython interface, and the methods in the braid groups are being worked on.
