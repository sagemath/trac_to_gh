Hmm, this could be caused by a directory being removed, or by a filesystem problem.
In which dir are you when launching the patchbot ? Have you removed this dir ?

I could wrap that with a `try except` clause. But I am using the variable `cwd` to get back to the original directory at the end of the function (by using os.chdir(cwd)). This is because I need to be in the sage_root directory when performing git operations.

EDIT: or maybe I could try to use `os.getenv('PWD')` instead ?

Is this really needed? I don't know the code exactly, but why can't you just `chdir()` to `SAGE_ROOT` and stay there?

If you *really* need to go back to the potentially-removed directory, you should use `os.fchdir()` instead of `os.chdir()` which will work even on deleted or moved directories.

I don't think that I specified `"skip_base=True"`, because I remember it breaking on other errors before (like the `coxeter3` failure).

However, it seems that this test of ticket 0 was not the initial test, but some later test (maybe because a new release came out?). It seems that these later tests of ticket 0 do not cause the patchbot to abort.

I think it's best if you try to get started and then see if and where you get stuck.

It doesn't look so bad to me.
