Add functions that computes 1) congruence generated by lists of elements, 2) lattice of congruences and 3) quotient lattice. Add functions to check if a lattice is 4) simple and 5) uniform.

This is part one, and only contains function to generate congruence. However, the function in `hasse_diagram.py` is made with above goals in mind.

Part two is #21861.

Good! See https://sage.sis.uta.fi/home/pub/130/ for a "preview".

E: This can be optimized: Move `congruence()` to `hasse_diagram.py` and add an option to "add" a congruence, i.e. a parameter to give already computed congruence.

Well, not really hard to make it work, but hard to make it fast (and my draft version if fast but incorrect...). I have thinked this, and propably we need a list of upper and lower covers, and should delete those to avoid unnecessary re-computation.

Also there seems to be no published algorithms for this.

For the `INPUT:` block, you should format the inputs as:

```
- ``parts`` -- a list of lists; congruences to add
```
Also, you should add the reference to the master list and link to it with `[Foo42]_`.

Good point, done.

OK. I guess this must be first made working, build something more on top of this and then see if we want to optimize or not.

There is not that horry, of course.

I just started playing with your code, and now tried the following:

```
[P for P in posets(r) if P.is_lattice() and all(len(set([len(b) for b in LatticePoset(P).congruence(p)]))==1 for p in SetPartitions(P))]
```
for r smaller than 8.  If I'm not mistaken, these should be precisely the uniform lattices, right?  (Very likely generated in the most stupid way possible :-)

I was a bit surprised to get so few of them: for r equal to 3,4,5 and 6 I get just one, for 7 I get four.  Does this match your experience - or is my code wrong?

1) Fill given blocks to convex sublattices, i.e. to intervals, 2) unify those blocks that have common element, and 3) go back to 1, if there was some change done during 2.

I am sure that there is a better way for this, but haven't invented it yet.

E: Think about `L = Posets.DivisorLattice(100000)` and `L.congruence([[4,10],[40,100]])`. It will 1) fill `[4, 10]` to `[2, 4, 10, 20]` and fill `[40, 100]` to `[20, 40, 100, 200]`, then 2) combine them to `[2, 4, 10, 20, 40, 100, 200]` and last 1) fill that to `[2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 40, 50, 100, 200]`. This kind of fill-combine -process can continue for several rounds.

Only after this we will use the quadrilateral argument, which is our "main compute part".
