```
Add functions that computes 1) congruence generated by lists of elements, 2) lattice of congruences and 3) quotient lattice. Add functions to check if a lattice is 4) simple and 5) uniform.

This is part one, and only contains function to generate congruence. However, the function in `hasse_diagram.py` is made with above goals in mind.

Part two is #21861.

Depends on #20057

Good! See https://sage.sis.uta.fi/home/pub/130/ for a "preview".

E: This can be optimized: Move `congruence()` to `hasse_diagram.py` and add an option to "add" a congruence, i.e. a parameter to give already computed congruence.

Status update: This is hard.

Well, not really hard to make it work, but hard to make it fast (and my draft version if fast but incorrect...). I have thinked this, and propably we need a list of upper and lower covers, and should delete those to avoid unnecessary re-computation.

Also there seems to be no published algorithms for this.

For speed, you might want to consider converting things into Cython code, but really it involves doing a bunch of profiling beforehand.

For the `INPUT:` block, you should format the inputs as:

```
- ``parts`` -- a list of lists; congruences to add
```
Also, you should add the reference to the master list and link to it with `[Foo42]_`.

It seems that actually this is fast enought, after meets and joins are computed. I did some tests, and for example principal congruences for all join-irreducibles (with their lower covers) on 1430-element Tamari lattice takes about 20 seconds on notebook, i.e. on not-compiled code.

I don't think that cythonizing can be done, as this needs `DisjointSet`s.

But now, does someone understand this code? If so, does it work?

Hi Jori!

I just started playing with your code, and now tried the following:

```
[P for P in posets(r) if P.is_lattice() and all(len(set([len(b) for b in LatticePoset(P).congruence(p)]))==1 for p in SetPartitions(P))]
```
for r smaller than 8.  If I'm not mistaken, these should be precisely the uniform lattices, right?  (Very likely generated in the most stupid way possible :-)

I was a bit surprised to get so few of them: for r equal to 3,4,5 and 6 I get just one, for 7 I get four.  Does this match your experience - or is my code wrong?

```
def uniform(self):

Jori, I'm confused.

I would have thought that the following two would yield the same result:

```
sage: L = LatticePoset(DiGraph('G?QO@@?O@u??')); L
Finite lattice containing 8 elements
sage: L.congruence([(2, 1), (4, 6), (3, 6)])
[[6, 4, 3, 1, 2, 5], [0, 7]]
sage: L.congruence([(2, 1), (3, 4, 6)])
[[6, 4, 3, 1, 2, 5, 0, 7]]
```

1) Fill given blocks to convex sublattices, i.e. to intervals, 2) unify those blocks that have common element, and 3) go back to 1, if there was some change done during 2.

I am sure that there is a better way for this, but haven't invented it yet.

E: Think about `L = Posets.DivisorLattice(100000)` and `L.congruence([[4,10],[40,100]])`. It will 1) fill `[4, 10]` to `[2, 4, 10, 20]` and fill `[40, 100]` to `[20, 40, 100, 200]`, then 2) combine them to `[2, 4, 10, 20, 40, 100, 200]` and last 1) fill that to `[2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 40, 50, 100, 200]`. This kind of fill-combine -process can continue for several rounds.

Only after this we will use the quadrilateral argument, which is our "main compute part".

Never before heard "smallest interval decomposition", but yes, I think that this is it. Can be separated, but maybe later?
