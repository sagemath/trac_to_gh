The new commit shows up in the log for this ticket but no notification seems to have been generated (I think because of the trac server change).

<a id='comment:8'></a>- Just checking the number of components for is_irreducible is not good enough. You're better off checking if the defining ideal is prime.

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
X=P.subscheme([x^2])
X.is_irreducible(),X.defining_ideal().is_prime()
```

- since the degree is just the dim! times the leading coefficient of HP, why not do it for projective subschemes instead of just curves?

- Adding an actual REF for Hartshorne would be nice.
