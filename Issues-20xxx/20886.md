This ticket upgrades lrslib to version 6.2. This version, according to http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html, has the following new features:
- (new in 6.0) mplrs: C wrapper for lrs that allows for parallelization on clusters of machines and uses the MPI library   quickstart
- (major revision in 6.1) lrsnash, 2nash:  Computes all Nash equlibria of a two person non-cooperative game.  2nash is a 2-processor parallel version

Since Polymake (#20892) seems to need the shared library of lrslib, but lrslib uses a hand-written makefile that does not work on Mac OS X, I have added an autotools build system. It is available here: https://github.com/mkoeppe/lrslib/tree/autoconfiscation

"Upstream" URL: https://github.com/mkoeppe/lrslib/releases/download/lrslib-062%2Bautotools-2016-07-05/lrslib-062.autotools-2016-07-05.tar.gz
Download and put into upstream under the name "lrslib-062+autotools-2016-07-05.tar.gz"

Thanks (though the tarball have a `.` instead of a `+` in the name). However, this failed to build for me with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS due to it not finding boost:

```
[lrslib-062+autotools-2016-06-28a] /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_thread
[lrslib-062+autotools-2016-06-28a] /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_system
```
Does this need the full version of boost or is Sage's stripped down version sufficient? FYI - I don't have a system-wide install of boost.
