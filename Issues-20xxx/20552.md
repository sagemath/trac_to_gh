The createDSStore I wrote is pure python and should be self-contained without any other dependencies than the system's python.
What does "python --version" report on your 10.7 system, Karl?

From comment 3, I gather we close this ticket with my change which makes building under 10.7 with binary_pkg possible again - even though the icons won't be arranged and have a background image for .app.dmg built under 10.7.

I can't test this again now (lest my computer become unusable for another full day while binary-pkg does its magic) but the change looks good.  If Volker agrees you should set it to positive review.
