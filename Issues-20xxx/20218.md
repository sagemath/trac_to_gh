Work has already been done--for example in #19187--on using `pip` for `sage -i` where appropriate.  However, a normal build of sage does not use `pip` for installing any Python spkgs; rather, they run `python setup.py install` which until recently has always been *the* way to install Python packages.

I can suggest several reasons why `pip` should be used instead of this method.  To be clear--as many people think of `pip` as a tool for installing packages from the internet--this is not strictly the case.  `pip` can be used to install an already downloaded tarball, or even straight from a source tree unpacked from a tarball or checked out from VCS.  The typical way to do this is to change directories to the directory containing the `setup.py` script and running `pip install .`.  This still ultimately calls `setup.py install`, among other `setup.py` commands, but with the right incantations to perform a pip-style flat install.  Now, why is this preferable?

1. Future-compatibility.  One of the goals that the Python packaging community has been working toward over the past several years has been to decouple Python package installation from build system.  Traditionally `setup.py` provided both a build program and an installation program.  At best it will still stick around as a build program, but its use for installation is being discouraged.  There is now finally a PEP (http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0516/), still very much in draft state, specifically concerning this decoupling.  Under this new regime `pip` will not likely be the *only* software for installing Python packages, but the assumption can no longer be that there is a `setup.py` script at all.

2. `pip` avoids using `easy_install`.  `easy_install` is an older installation program for Python packages that was bundled with setuptools--when a Python project uses setuptools in its `setup.py`, the `setup.py install` command invokes `easy_install` *by default*.

```
     With the flat install style used by `pip`, and now more generally favored, the `sys.path`, with no eggs, would be simply:

```python
>>> pprint(sys.path)
['',
 '/home/iguananaut/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python',
 '/home/iguananaut/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python27.zip',

 '/home/iguananaut/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload',
 '/home/iguananaut/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages']
```
     which is certainly easier to read and reason about.


b. The egg import mechanism requires writing to a common file during egg installation--easy-install.pth.  This causes problems in parallel installations, requiring patches to setuptools.  The flat install style used by pip has no such problems--there is a no single common file written to by pip during installation of packages (other than maybe the log file, which is only for debugging purposes).

As I explained in [this comment](http://trac.sagemath.org/timeline?from=2016-02-25T10%3A23%3A37-08%3A00&precision=second), when a Python package is installed with `pip`, `pip` actually slips setuptools into the installation process, whether the package uses it explicitly or not.  There are reasons for this not worth going into now.  This is no problem for the vast majority of cases.  The only exception I know of is that setuptools doesn't handle the `data_files` option well when `--prefix` is changed.  As far as I can tell this is only a problem for sage itself and possibly for sagetex, but these don't even use `setuptools` in the first place, so until we have a workaround for that it does no harm if we keep using `setup.py install` for those packages, if nothing else works.

Most of the rest of the Python packages included by default in a Sage build (I haven't checked all of -optional yet) already use setuptools.  I checked the setup.py of all the rest that don't explicitly use setuptools--these include `docutils`, `mpmath`, `pexpect`, `ptyprocess`, `Pycrypto`, `pyparsing`, `pyzmq`, `scipy`, and all packages from the Jupyter team (`ip*`, `jupyter*`, `np*`, `notebook`, `traitlets`).

Most of these packages are known by me (from personal experience) to work fine with pip.  Looking at the setup.py scripts of the rest of them, most of them are fairly trivial and should work fine.

TL;DR, with the exceptions of sage and sagetex (pending work like #20108), as well as pip itself the `spkg-install` scripts for Python packages should change `setup.py install` commands to `pip install .`.  Their dependencies would also have to be updated to require pip to be installed first.

At the same time the "uninstall" commands in those scripts can be changed to use `pip uninstall`.

Result: pyparsing's source is extracted with permissions 777 and is then copied into a directory in `/tmp` with unrestricted access, from which pip installs it.  My previous comments aside these are all bad and all three should be addressed.

<a id='comment:22'></a>I made a project with the following files:

`zzz.py`:

```
print("zzz")
```

`setup.py`:

```
from setuptools import setup   # setuptools or distutils does not matter

setup(

I changed the permissions of both these files to `0666` and then ran `python setup.py sdist`. The result:

Okay, that's fair.  I can break this up.

Not exactly clear how to break up 2 and 3 though.  If optional packages are going to be installed with pip, they *have* to have dependency files listing at least pip first.  But if I do that *before* making them installed with pip then they would have an unnecessary dependency on pip.

Unless I made a separate ticket that only adds the dependency files with no pip, and then later adds the pip dependency as part of 2).  But that would be a little more annoying.

The buildbot is not allowed to download packages. 

The nbconvert package lists entrypoints in `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nbconvert-4.2.0-py2.7.egg-info/requires.txt`, but only with this ticket. Without this ticket, the depenency is not picked up.

Not really. I want dependency *checking*, not dependency *resolution*.

It is completely normal for a package to check its dependencies upon installation: GNU `configure` scripts usually do this.

The flag `--no-index` does exactly that: it will not install dependencies but it will still check for dependencies.

`pip install --upgrade --force --no-deps` does it.  I've used that in the past.

`--upgrade` does recursion:

```
  -U, --upgrade               Upgrade all specified packages to the newest available version. This process is recursive regardless of whether a dependency is already
                              satisfied.
```

Edit: I see you added `--no-deps` but I don't want that since I do want dependency checking.

I would argue that the bug is in Jupyter's requirements list: it lists a dependency which in practice is not a dependency at all, but more like an optional add-on.

I just want to get on with this and this is a simple solution which is known to work.

The reason you get this

```
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'terminado>=0.3.3' distribution was not found and is required by notebook
```

is that installing with setuptools also installs the autogenerated console script wrappers which do dependency checking when you run them, so it's right to say that it won't run without some dependency installed.
