Work has already been done--for example in #19187--on using `pip` for `sage -i` where appropriate.  However, a normal build of sage does not use `pip` for installing any Python spkgs; rather, they run `python setup.py install` which until recently has always been *the* way to install Python packages.

I can suggest several reasons why `pip` should be used instead of this method.  To be clear--as many people think of `pip` as a tool for installing packages from the internet--this is not strictly the case.  `pip` can be used to install an already downloaded tarball, or even straight from a source tree unpacked from a tarball or checked out from VCS.  The typical way to do this is to change directories to the directory containing the `setup.py` script and running `pip install .`.  This still ultimately calls `setup.py install`, among other `setup.py` commands, but with the right incantations to perform a pip-style flat install.  Now, why is this preferable?

1. Future-compatibility.  One of the goals that the Python packaging community has been working toward over the past several years has been to decouple Python package installation from build system.  Traditionally `setup.py` provided both a build program and an installation program.  At best it will still stick around as a build program, but its use for installation is being discouraged.  There is now finally a PEP (http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0516/), still very much in draft state, specifically concerning this decoupling.  Under this new regime `pip` will not likely be the *only* software for installing Python packages, but the assumption can no longer be that there is a `setup.py` script at all.

2. `pip` avoids using `easy_install`.  `easy_install` is an older installation program for Python packages that was bundled with setuptools--when a Python project uses setuptools in its `setup.py`, the `setup.py install` command invokes `easy_install` *by default*.  The behavior of `easy_install` is to install the package as an egg archive/directory.  `easy_install` has several disadvantages, of which this is just one, but there are a couple reasons that this alone is a problem:


   a. Every .egg requires a `sys.path` entry, hence difficult to debug paths that look like this:

```
     With the flat install style used by `pip`, and now more generally favored, the `sys.path`, with no eggs, would be simply:

```python
>>> pprint(sys.path)
['',
 '/home/iguananaut/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python',
 '/home/iguananaut/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python27.zip',

 '/home/iguananaut/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload',
 '/home/iguananaut/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages']
```
     which is certainly easier to read and reason about.


b. The egg import mechanism requires writing to a common file during egg installation--easy-install.pth.  This causes problems in parallel installations, requiring patches to setuptools.  The flat install style used by pip has no such problems--there is a no single common file written to by pip during installation of packages (other than maybe the log file, which is only for debugging purposes).

As I explained in [this comment](http://trac.sagemath.org/timeline?from=2016-02-25T10%3A23%3A37-08%3A00&precision=second), when a Python package is installed with `pip`, `pip` actually slips setuptools into the installation process, whether the package uses it explicitly or not.  There are reasons for this not worth going into now.  This is no problem for the vast majority of cases.  The only exception I know of is that setuptools doesn't handle the `data_files` option well when `--prefix` is changed.  As far as I can tell this is only a problem for sage itself and possibly for sagetex, but these don't even use `setuptools` in the first place, so until we have a workaround for that it does no harm if we keep using `setup.py install` for those packages, if nothing else works.

Most of the rest of the Python packages included by default in a Sage build (I haven't checked all of -optional yet) already use setuptools.  I checked the setup.py of all the rest that don't explicitly use setuptools--these include `docutils`, `mpmath`, `pexpect`, `ptyprocess`, `Pycrypto`, `pyparsing`, `pyzmq`, `scipy`, and all packages from the Jupyter team (`ip*`, `jupyter*`, `np*`, `notebook`, `traitlets`).

Most of these packages are known by me (from personal experience) to work fine with pip.  Looking at the setup.py scripts of the rest of them, most of them are fairly trivial and should work fine.

TL;DR, with the exceptions of sage and sagetex (pending work like #20108), as well as pip itself the `spkg-install` scripts for Python packages should change `setup.py install` commands to `pip install .`.  Their dependencies would also have to be updated to require pip to be installed first.

At the same time the "uninstall" commands in those scripts can be changed to use `pip uninstall`.

I've attached a branch containing the beginnings of this work. I've already put it through several rounds of testing locally including installing, reinstalling packages, uninstalling and reinstalling, etc.

But I'm interested to find out what happens in the patchbot.

I haven't addressed the SSL issue yet but I will.  I wanted to start getting some test / review feedback on the main work in the meantime.

This isn't correct:

```
Sage's Python unconditionally removes . from sys.path
which can break several packages' installation
```

Sage's Python only removes `.` from `sys.path` if having `.` in `sys.path` might be insecure. If packages break because of this, those packages should be fixed instead of working around the security check.

Nevermind--I traced this to a bug in pip, combined with a possible minor defect in `sage-uncompress-spkg` (or Python's `tarfile` module depending on your perspective), along with strange packaging for pyparsing, which is the package where this came up originally.

1) It's true that pip creates a temp dir (under `/tmp`, typically) in which to build a package.  This directory is created with `mkdtemp` and normally has safe permissions on it.  However, when installing a package from a source directory (a la `pip install .`), pip then deletes that temp directory, and copies the source directory using `shutil.copytree` to the same path as the just-deleted temp dir.  There are a couple problems with this:
 a) Deleting and recreating the temp dir of the same name involves a possible race condition.
 b) More importantly, while `mkdtemp` will create a directory with safe permissions, `shutil.copytree` copies the original permissions of the source files, which may be arbitrary.  Instead, pip should be copying the *contents* of the source directory *into* the directory created with `mkdtemp`.

2) `sage-uncompress-spkg` just calls `TarFile.extractall()` which preserves the original permissions of all files/directories in the tar file, and doesn't provide a clear way to enable or disable this.  This is different from the GNU `tar` command which by default (for normal users) applies the user's umask to all extracted files, which is generally safer depending on the user's umask.  It would probably be best if `sage-uncompress-spkg` did this as well.

3) The top-level directory in pyparsing's source package has permissions set to 777.  Of all the upstream source tarballs I have pyparsing is the *only* one like this.  All the rest have 775 or 755.  

Result: pyparsing's source is extracted with permissions 777 and is then copied into a directory in `/tmp` with unrestricted access, from which pip installs it.  My previous comments aside these are all bad and all three should be addressed.

Agreed.... is what I was about to write. But I tested it and `./setup.py sdist` does actually use sane permissions.  So either the maintainer of pyparsing is not using `./setup.py sdist` or is using a buggy version of Python or something.

I made a project with the following files:

`zzz.py`:

```
print("zzz")
```

`setup.py`:

```
from setuptools import setup   # setuptools or distutils does not matter

setup(
    name="zzz",
    py_modules=["zzz"],
)
```

I changed the permissions of both these files to `0666` and then ran `python setup.py sdist`. The result:

Okay, that's fair.  I can break this up.

Not exactly clear how to break up 2 and 3 though.  If optional packages are going to be installed with pip, they *have* to have dependency files listing at least pip first.  But if I do that *before* making them installed with pip then they would have an unnecessary dependency on pip.

Unless I made a separate ticket that only adds the dependency files with no pip, and then later adds the pip dependency as part of 2).  But that would be a little more annoying.

Rebased, and simplified to no longer depend on #20692, and also removed the patch to pip for SSL, which has been broken out to #20913.

This doesn't have a strict dependence on #20913, but #20913 should still be merged first since otherwise this patch will break the sage build on platforms with no OpenSSL support.

Rebased on recent develop branch.

It would be great to get this moving--I just a build fail on trying to install `flask_babel` (though it could have been any number of packages) because they all use setuptools, and hence running `./setup.py install` makes them use `easy_install` by default and check online for the package's dependencies even though it shouldn't have to.

This patch ensures that Python packages are installed without dependency on PyPI.

Apart from that, I see no obvious issue with this ticket. It mostly needs testing. I will try to do that in the following days.

I actually need to modify this slightly.  The `$PIP_INSTALL` variable that's set in `build/make/install` is now needed for running the `spkg-install` for all the Python packages that use it.  This means `spkg-install` can't be run directly and *must* go through the `build/make/install` script.

Instead, `$PIP_INSTALL` should probably be set in `sage-env`.

`sagenb_export` isn't even a sage package in this branch.  It must have been added since I last rebased.  I mean, until the commit I just pushed it wasn't even being installed with pip so I don't know what the relation would be.

Except that whoever added `sagenb_export` as an spkg did not also add all its dependencies which unfortunately you have to do.

Not really. I want dependency *checking*, not dependency *resolution*.

It is completely normal for a package to check its dependencies upon installation: GNU `configure` scripts usually do this.

The flag `--no-index` does exactly that: it will not install dependencies but it will still check for dependencies.

Hmm, removing `--no-deps` breaks a lot of Jupyter stuff since they have `setup.py` containing stuff like

```
setuptools_args = {}
install_requires = setuptools_args['install_requires'] = [
    'ipython>=4.0.0',
    'traitlets',
    'jupyter_client',
    'tornado>=4.0',
]

if 'setuptools' in sys.modules:
    setup_args.update(setuptools_args)
```

These dependencies are not seen when installing using `python setup.py install`.

A relevant ticket in pip: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3261

It's mentioned there that there's also a new `pip check` command that will do a sanity-check on the system, so running that could also be policy (without necessarily requiring the check on every package install).

`--upgrade` does recursion:

```
  -U, --upgrade               Upgrade all specified packages to the newest available version. This process is recursive regardless of whether a dependency is already
                              satisfied.
```

Edit: I see you added `--no-deps` but I don't want that since I do want dependency checking.

I would argue that the bug is in Jupyter's requirements list: it lists a dependency which in practice is not a dependency at all, but more like an optional add-on.

So what we should then? I see two options:

1. Patch `notebook/setup.py` to remove `terminado` from the dependencies.

2. Add a `terminado` package to Sage as dependency of this ticket.

I suggest option 2.  As it is, for the Docker image for Sage I'm also installing terminado separately.  I don't see why it shouldn't be included.

If it helps, looking at the setup.py for notebook, it seems terminado *is* being considered a requirement on any non-Windows platform.  Probably because even though they've been careful to make it so that the notebook can work without it, not having it means missing functionality==a defect.  I don't think we should say that "Sage includes the Jupyter notebook" and then ship a defective product.

The reason you get this

```
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'terminado>=0.3.3' distribution was not found and is required by notebook
```

is that installing with setuptools also installs the autogenerated console script wrappers which do dependency checking when you run them, so it's right to say that it won't run without some dependency installed.

To be clear--as many people think of `pip` as a tool for installing packages from the internet--this is not strictly the case.  `pip` can be used to install an already downloaded tarball, or even straight from a source tree unpacked from a tarball or checked out from VCS.  The typical way to do this is to change directories to the directory containing the `setup.py` script and running `pip install .`.  This still ultimately calls `setup.py install`, among other `setup.py` commands, but with the right incantations to perform a pip-style flat install.  Now, why is this preferable?\n``````\n",

 I can suggest several reasons why `pip` should be used instead of this method.  To be clear--as many people think of `pip` as a tool for installing packages from the internet--this is not strictly the case.  `pip` can be used to install an already downloaded tarball, or even straight from a source tree unpacked from a tarball or checked out from VCS.  The typical way to do this is to change directories to the directory containing the `setup.py` script and running `pip install .`.  This still ultimately calls `setup.py install`, among other `setup.py` commands, but with the right incantations to perform a pip-style flat install.  Now, why is this preferable?
