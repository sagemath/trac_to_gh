True

However, I'm not sure about the segmentation fault in `expression.pyx`, calling

```
sage: (Mod(2,7)*x^2 + Mod(2,7))^7
```
from `sage -gdb` prints the line

```
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

It seems that something requires the expression to be a real in order for the power to work. This is bad.

Maybe I'll investigate later; have to go now.

This is because if in doubt `py_is_real` asks `py_imag` whether the imaginary part is 0---which is the case for these elements, because if in doubt, `py_imag` assumes that the imaginary part is 0. ;-)

This might be an approach worth pursuing.
