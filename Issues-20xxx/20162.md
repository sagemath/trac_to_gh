This should not happen:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9)
sage: SR(a).is_real()
True
sage: SR(a).is_positive()
True

Ah, yes. Maybe I need another way of finding out whether a parent is a finite field; `is_finite` seems to throw `NotImplementedError`s here. That would fix the failures in `schemes/elliptic_curves/heigth.py`.

However, I'm not sure about the segmentation fault in `expression.pyx`, calling

```
sage: (Mod(2,7)*x^2 + Mod(2,7))^7
```
from `sage -gdb` prints the line

```
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
GiNaC::add::integer_content (this=0x3019c20) at normal.cpp:325
```
It seems that something requires the expression to be a real in order for the power to work. This is bad.

Maybe I'll investigate later; have to go now.

This is because if in doubt `py_is_real` asks `py_imag` whether the imaginary part is 0---which is the case for these elements, because if in doubt, `py_imag` assumes that the imaginary part is 0. ;-)

This might be an approach worth pursuing.
