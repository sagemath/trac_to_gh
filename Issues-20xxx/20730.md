`sage_setup.autogen.interpreters` was getting a bit long (over 4000 lines) and it was hard to understand how some of it was organized.  So I split it up into several logical modules.  This seemed to have [some support](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/RB4-A-p5pRI/0T8ZtGpzCwAJ).

How exactly I chose to break it up is certainly up for debate, but I thought this was fairly logical to start.  In the `__init__.py` I still import all from all submodules so that the API for the `sage_setup.autogen.interpreters` module is unchanged.

I would like to get some version of this accepted soon, as I have a few tasks to work on in this module and it would be easier (though not necessary) to work on it on top of this change.

Funny, I actually did that at first but then took it out since it wasn't strictly needed.  No problem adding them back in though.

That can be done with a single wildcard like we already do for the PARI stuff:

```
sage/libs/pari/auto_gen.pxi: $(SAGE_LOCAL)/share/pari/pari.desc \
        sage/libs/pari/decl.pxi sage_setup/autogen/pari/*.py
    python -c "from sage_setup.autogen.pari import rebuild; rebuild()"
```

The current layout I came up with has a `sage_setup.autogen.interpreters.specs` subpackage, so a single wildcard would not work.

I could do away with the subpackage and that's arguable.  I think it makes it easier to find the implementations for the individual interpreter specs, rather than intermingling them with support modules.

Even with the subdirectory you could still use wildcards...

Anyway, there should be a solution which doesn't involve 20 new lines added to `src/Makefile`.

What's the point of this:

# nodoctest -- __main__ modules are just for running the module from the

It doesn't matter since the file doesn't have doctests anyway.

If it didn't matter I wouldn't have even thought to put such a thing.  The doctest runner still imports a module to determine if there are any doctests in the module.  Since everything in a `__main__` module is is executed upon import, we don't want the doctest runner to even import it (there is no `if __name__ == '__main__'` equivalent since it's a tautology in this case).

Just the list the few files that are there one by one in the Makefile.

This looks like a good addition and will allow to close #21459 as a temporary but quick solution for Cygwin.

What about the dependency on #20238?
Can we make the dependency the other way around?
Or will #20238 be finished soon?
