`sage_setup.autogen.interpreters` was getting a bit long (over 4000 lines) and it was hard to understand how some of it was organized.  So I split it up into several logical modules.  This seemed to have [some support](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/RB4-A-p5pRI/0T8ZtGpzCwAJ).

How exactly I chose to break it up is certainly up for debate, but I thought this was fairly logical to start.  In the `__init__.py` I still import all from all submodules so that the API for the `sage_setup.autogen.interpreters` module is unchanged.

I would like to get some version of this accepted soon, as I have a few tasks to work on in this module and it would be easier (though not necessary) to work on it on top of this change.

Funny, I actually did that at first but then took it out since it wasn't strictly needed.  No problem adding them back in though.

Thanks. I don't run `make` that often for building sagelib (as opposed to just running `setup.py ` directly) so I didn't catch this.

That can be done with a single wildcard like we already do for the PARI stuff:

```
sage/libs/pari/auto_gen.pxi: $(SAGE_LOCAL)/share/pari/pari.desc \
        sage/libs/pari/decl.pxi sage_setup/autogen/pari/*.py
    python -c "from sage_setup.autogen.pari import rebuild; rebuild()"

I understand but it's not just bikeshedding. It's also about readability. Every time I look at that `src/Makefile` I really have to think hard to understand what is going on. And usually, that is a bad sign.

<a id='comment:38'></a>However the doctester determines the doctests, the fact remains that at some point it *imports* the module.  That happens here: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/doctest/sources.py#n670

The reason that isn't a problem for `src/sage_setup/docbuild/__main__.py` (and believe me, this had me pulling my hair out) is that it is listed in this insidious [`in_lib`](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/doctest/sources.py#n575) attribute.  I described more problems with this in #20729.

But if you don't believe me try removing it yourself and see.  Like I said, I wouldn't have even thought to add such a thing in the first place if I didn't have a good reason.
