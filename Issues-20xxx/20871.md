Fixes 2 issues:

1. An outright bug following from #20721: If the files in a tarball are not all under a top-level directory (shouldn't be the case, but possible), the `-d` flag did not work as advertised.

2. Always unset setuid and setgid flags.  There's no reason they should be set in a source tarball (I don't think?) and it will mitigate issues like #20870

There is still an issue with zip files.

`sage -i bliss` gives:

Was this reported before?

Might as well fix it as part of this ticket too while I'm fixing bugs.

It looks like the `ZipFile` class is inconsistent with the `TarFile` class, where `open` is a classmethod.  I think I knew that but forgot this time.

I didn't see a report; but zip files did work in the past. Perhaps introduced in #20721? I didn't catch it at this time.
