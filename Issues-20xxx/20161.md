pytz is included in Sage, but only in the sagenb package. Not sure what to do here...

Due to wrong logic in `build/pkgs/matplotlib/spkg-install`, this error doesn't actually cause the build to fail, which is a bug in itself.

Its only needed if you ask matplotlib to do stuff with time zones, i.e. create axis date labels with timezones. Its not a build-time dependency.

It is because `setuptools` make any dependency into a build-time dependency. After installing matplotlib, you see something like
