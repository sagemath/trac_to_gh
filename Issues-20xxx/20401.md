We pull many things from Chevie that are hard-coded. We should rather hardcode those ourselves, plus other stuff that is either hard to compute, or easy to hard-code.

We currently think of hard-coding:
* degrees/codegrees
* fake degree polynomials
* fundamental invariants
* roots, coroots, fundamental weights
* representatives of conjugacy classes
* field of definition
* cartan matrix

* tba

At Days93.51, we have been porting all hard-coded data files from chevie to python (untested and probably containing tons of errors still), these can be found at

    https://github.com/jmichel7/gap3-jm/tree/master/sage/cheviedata

and will be updated when we find issues.
