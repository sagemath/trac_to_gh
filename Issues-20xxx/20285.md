OSX binary installs do not allow installing extra packages (breaking after make is run).

To reproduce (as described in the posts linked):

download binary distro (to an OSX machine with Sage dev environment ready), install it by untarring and running ./sage once.

Then do 
   ./sage -i gap_packages 
   make

get an error and ./sage that crashes

I did not say "integrating into Sage". I meant "make it less weird to use, and easier to install properly". (Same applies to git trac, by the way).
They are parts of a wider "Sage dev/release tools" project, and I only have arguments for it to be less loose than it is now, so that just one or two git commands in the Sage repo is all you need to get them installed/updated; less strictly necessary reading to do to configure them properly
(e.g. currently we have an unwritten requirement that binary-pkg must not be installed via git to be useful, cf https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg/issues/6)

They would remain quite independent from Sage, with their own requirements etc.

Having binary-pkg in Sage would mean that its dependencies would also become packaged in binary tarballs.
