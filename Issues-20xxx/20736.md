The patchbot is currently installing in a very not kosher way, as explained in

https://github.com/robertwb/sage-patchbot/issues/79

This ticket will change completely the installation mode. The patchbot will become a python package, to be installed using pip in
the system python as explained below.

This ticket also updates the patchbot, in particular to cope with the new https trac.

New tarball for patchbot: http://www-irma.u-strasbg.fr/~chapoton/sage-patchbot-2.6.1.tar.gz

installation (two equivalent methods at your disposal):
1. Download the tarball and then

```
pip install --user sage-patchbot-2.6.1.tar.gz
```

2. (recommended)

```
pip install --user git+https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot.git@2.6.1
```

There are now two possible ways to launch the patchbot:
1.

```
python -m sage_patchbot.patchbot --sage-root=XXXX
```
or
2. Checkout the branch here and run

```
make && ./sage --patchbot
```

Depends on #22473

Not related to installation problem, but in the `dependencies` file you should put

```
$(PYTHON) | setuptools
```

That is, if `setuptools` is reinstalled it's not necessary to reinstall a Python package that happens to use it.  But it is a prerequisite to installing.

There is a fundamental problem here, mentioned also at https://github.com/robertwb/sage-patchbot/issues/79

We cannot use the Sage Python for the patchbot, since the patchbot might reinstall Python. So I don't know what the best solution is, but installing it "the usual way" is **not** the right thing to do here.

"build dep" is probably the wrong description--but I just meant a developer tool for development of Sage, outside the sage distribution.

To be clear, this is a case where the term "package" is often overloaded in Python:

* Here the package, as in the name of what you import in Python is `patchbot`

* The name in the `setup.py` is different from the package name, and as sometimes referred to as the "distribution name" or the "PyPI name" to reduce confusion.  Often the package name and the distribution name are the same, but they don't have to be.  Either way it shouldn't be relevant here.

I think the main takeaway here is that the patchbot should not be a Sage spkg at all.  It's not a part of sage, the distribution.  It's a tool for testing sage the distribution and as such should be entirely external to it.

So to install the patchbot on say a Linux system one would use `sudo pip install <path/to/tarball>` or even just `sudo pip install sage-patchbot` if the latest version is uploaded to PyPI.

Alternatively this can be done within a virtualenv if we prefer to avoid the system install.

I am doing what I can, but this is a bit too complicated for me to handle easily.

I changed all the imports in such a way that patchbot must now be used a a python package. The simpplest way (and it works) is what I suggest above.

Why do you so strongly object to pip installation in the system python ?

Now if you have better suggestions, I would appreciate help.

It should be possible to install and run the patchbot without `sudo` access.

Relative imports are not allowed when a python file is run as a script, it seems.

How is it compatible with not installing in the sage python ?

Is there any way to install somewhere inside sage a python package using the system python ? Is there any existing case ? Where should it go ? How should I do that ?

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment:35):
> The 2.6.0 seems to work well enough on sage4, although at some point it tested closed tickets.

I did have to manually change `PYTHONPATH` for it to work in a user install.

I think you should be able to do

```
./sage --pip install --user patchbot
```

However, since Sage sets `PYTHONUSERBASE` (no idea why), this patchbot is installed in a directory different from what the system Python expects. To get it working, I had to set `PYTHONPATH` to the `site-packages` directory in `~/.sage/local`. Because of confusion between `lib` and `lib64`, just setting `PYTHONUSERBASE` system-wide was not sufficient.

For this reason, I believe that `./sage --patchbot` should set `PYTHONPATH` before running the patchbot.

I propose the following "modus operandi" for patchbot installation and use

* get the latest tarball.tar.gz from somewhere (git or my web page?)
* pip install --user tarball.tar.gz
* sage -patchbot --options (1) OR python -m sage_patchbot.patchbot --options (2)

Everything (pip and python) should take place in the system python. I do not see any reason to involve the inner python of sage.

I am not completely sure if this already works with this branch, but it was my vision of things. I think that I did (1) or (2) on my own patchbot client, which seems to be running well.

Now Jeroen and Eric do not seem to agree on what to do. Please consider that I have not a lot of time to spend on that.

Why not put it on PyPI, and put out some proper releases?

Alternatively, pip allows download direct from a git repository, including specific tags.

> pip install --user tarball.tar.gz

Whatever; people can `pip install` however they're comfortable with.

> I am not completely sure if this already works with this branch, but it was my vision of things. I think that I did (1) or (2) on my own patchbot client, which seems to be running well.

I don't know.  Is there anything in the patchbot that tries to import `sage`?  I don't *think* there is--as far as I can tell the patchbot can run entirely outside of the sage environment, as it should.

> Now Jeroen and Eric do not seem to agree on what to do. Please consider that I have not a lot of time to spend on that.

AFAICT the only disagreement is over whether or not running `sudo pip install` is ever appropriate.  My point is that it doesn't really matter--as long as the user is installing into a Python outside of the Sage distribution (be it a virtualenv, a `--user` install, or whatever) it should work fine.  It doesn't really matter and the most appropriate choice depends on the context.

For that matter, there's probably nothing wrong with installing the patchbot package into Sage's Python too, again just using `pip install`.  But in general it should not be necessary to.

Let us try to move forward, please. This works, as far as I can tell.

The patchbot package is installed in the system python, not as root but as user.

I would prefer not to use pypi for the moment.

Could somebody try to follow exactly the instructions and see if everything runs smoothly ?

Thanks for the feedback.

These are not the instructions on how to run the patchbot given in the ticket description.

But this will be another possible way.

Librae is meeting a whole bunch of doctest failure with lrslib. Maybe it should be checked that the bot is not causing them.

Concerning pypi, it may be simpler once done, but I am not really ready to add yet another layer of complexity.

Concerning the log, I would prefer to postpone the problem, once the new setting is in place.

I don't think it's deeply necessary--`pip` can install fine from a git repository for example (including specific tags).  But it's not a big deal either way.

And like I also wrote earlier it shouldn't matter where `pathbot` is installed either as long as it's installed correctly and running `patchbot` from the command-line works.

You've already fixed up the patchbot to use distutils properly, so this is a matter of making an account on PyPI, setting up your credentials, and running `./setup.py register upload`.  There's no additional layer of complexity.

Indeed. If the patchbot is a Python package it is much more natural to use it without the Sage environment variables set.

> Librae is meeting a whole bunch of doctest failure with lrslib. Maybe it should be checked that the bot is not causing them.

Not the bot: #21012

> Concerning pypi, it may be simpler once done, but I am not really ready to add yet another layer of complexity.

It is not a new layer. It is simply a way to distribute the module. Instead of having a tarball on your webpage there is a tarball on PyPI. It is just simpler because for installation you would just have to do `pip install sage-patchbot --user` (downloading would be automatic). And for upgrade `pip install sage-patchbot --upgrade`.

Of course this was not intended to be for this ticket. Still it is a question.

The patchbot librae is hanging on #19092 since more than a day

The current date is `Fri Jul 22 21:25:47 CEST 2016`. The end of `logs/patchbot/patchbot.log`

Mainly just for convenience. It's easier to type `./sage --patchbot` than `python -m sage_patchbot.patchbot --sage-root=SAGE_ROOT`.

Second reason: on most systems, `python` is installed system-wide. But `pip` often is not.

It is just the command `sage -patchbot` which is half broken. So I would vote for (1) that is much cleaner and solve the issue.

EDIT: in my initial post I wrote (2) instead of (1)... sorry

As I understand it the purpose of `./sage -foo` is to run the `foo` program that's installed in the sage environment.  I don't see why it should be doing anything else.  At most if `./sage -patchbot` is meant to do *something* it can raise an error if `patchbot` does not happen to be installed in the Sage environment.  Then if one wants they can `./sage -pip install sage-patchbot` and get it in their Sage environment, at which point `./sage -patchbot` is the equivalent of `. sage-env; patchbot`, etc...

Otherwise all one needs to do to run the patchbot is to run `patchbot` however it happens to be installed on a (correctly configured) system.

That's easy: I just need to check both the Python-in-Sage and the system Python.

However, there seems to be disagreement (see @videlec and @embray) about what `./sage --patchbot` **should** actually do. There is no point in fixing the branch if I have to throw it away anyway.

Proposed solution:

- do not allow `sage -patchbot` for running the bot
- make so that `sage -patchbot` just prints:

```
The patchbot can no longer be run in this way.
Please see https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot/details for up-to-date instructions.
```

I would accept this solution.

So that people have no choice to make. And this is still only two command lines.

3. Download `sage_patchbot`

It effectively is.  `pip` is the official installer for Python packages and comes with modern distributions of Python (including most system distributions).  While you can have a "working" Python installation *without* pip, a Python installation with a non-working pip installation is not a working Python installation.

Well, I want to run the pacthbot installed **within Sage** using the **system** Python. You seem to agree with the first part but not the second.

You cannot use the Python-in-Sage to run the patchbot because that one might be reinstalled: the patchbot builds Sage so it might rebuild the Python-in-Sage too. And reinstalling a program that you are running is a recipe for trouble.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:0\" align=\"right\">comment:0</div>\n\nOkay, but when we say \"the patchbot installed within Sage\" you mean there's a copy of the `sage_patchbot` package in `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`, right?\n\nWhat is the advantage to doing that?  `site-packages` is a special path as far as Python is concerned.

Okay, but when we say "the patchbot installed within Sage" you mean there's a copy of the `sage_patchbot` package in `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`, right?

What is the advantage to doing that?  `site-packages` is a special path as far as Python is concerned.  A typical Python executable knows where to find its `site-packages` (well, it gets it from `site.py` which it knows how to find), and that `site-packages` in a sense "belongs" to that Python.  So it's very atypical to use one Python installation to run a package that happens to be in another Python's `site-packages`.  One exception is virtualenvs that make use of the "system site-packages" feature.

Not saying it won't work--of course ultimately it's just another directory full of Python modules one is adding to `sys.path` (assuming they are for the same Python version at least, which they might not be--your patch tries `python2.7`, followed by `python2`, followed by `python`, where the latter might be Python 2.6, or Python 3.4 or something).

TL;DR I don't see what you gain from that.

I haven't followed the full discussion, nor have I ever run a patchbot, but here's my 2 cents.

+1 on using the system Python.

-1 on including the patchbot as part of the sage distribution in any way.

-1 on supporting `sage --patchbot`. 

I think it's inviting trouble to have the testing framework depend in any way on scripts of the software to be tested.

>`--sage-root=`

1. the parameter should be called `--sage-testing-root=` (or similar) rather than `sage-root`: several sage installations may exists on a system. Especially sage-root might be menthally associated with the production-sage root directory.

2. The option `sage-testing-root` should be added as a config file parameter.

If supporting `'sage -patchbot'` works as expected (starts the user-local or system installation of the patchbot and also uses the system python) and does not cause any serious harm (including maintenance issues) I would not insist on the complete removal of 'sage -patchbot'.
A compromise between the two different opinions here could be to print a message that running `'sage -patchbot'` is no longer the preferred way to run the patchbot and point to the buildbot wiki.

what is exactly the issue of the script by Jeroen?

> is the Sage installation that you want to test.

If I want to test a sage installation I just type './sage -t --all ' 

Of course you mean that 'sage-root' is here the folder where patchbot will test various tickets (and thus various sage versions)

> IMHO, it's obvious that the `--sage-root` when running the patchbot is the Sage installation that you want to test.  

Since you formally failed to correcly explain what `--sage-root` means, I do not buy that 'it is obvious', at least not for a new patchbot user.  So I find the 'sage-root' patchbot option should be at lieast documented (what it does) on the wiki and in the software and the inconsistency between 'sage_root' and 'sage-root' should be removed (underscore vs dash) 

By the way; it is well known that naming is one important part of software development and it may create mental blockades or misunderstandings.

In summary: 
I expect as minimal action to gain positive review that 'sage_root' gets documented in the software and in the wiki
(https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot/details) and the inconsistency between 'sage_root' and 'sage-root' is removed (underscore in config file vs dash in command line option)

Doesn't "deprecate the related `sage -patchbot` command" relate more to the second point instead of the first?

1. remove patchbot optional spkg
