The patchbot is currently installing in a very not kosher way, as explained in

https://github.com/robertwb/sage-patchbot/issues/79

This ticket will change completely the installation mode. The patchbot will become a python package, to be installed using pip in
the system python as explained below.

This ticket also updates the patchbot, in particular to cope with the new https trac.

New tarball for patchbot: http://www-irma.u-strasbg.fr/~chapoton/sage-patchbot-2.6.1.tar.gz

installation (two equivalent methods at your disposal):
1. Download the tarball and then

```
pip install --user sage-patchbot-2.6.1.tar.gz
```

2. (recommended)

```
pip install --user git+https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot.git@2.6.1
```

There are now two possible ways to launch the patchbot:
1.

```
python -m sage_patchbot.patchbot --sage-root=XXXX
```
or
2. Checkout the branch here and run

```
make && ./sage --patchbot
```

Depends on #22473

Not related to installation problem, but in the `dependencies` file you should put

```
$(PYTHON) | setuptools
```

That is, if `setuptools` is reinstalled it's not necessary to reinstall a Python package that happens to use it.  But it is a prerequisite to installing.

There is a fundamental problem here, mentioned also at https://github.com/robertwb/sage-patchbot/issues/79

We cannot use the Sage Python for the patchbot, since the patchbot might reinstall Python. So I don't know what the best solution is, but installing it "the usual way" is **not** the right thing to do here.

So it's a build dep for Sage and should be installed "the usual way" using the system Python.

I changed the name of the package back to sage-patchbot. But I am little bit stuck here.

It kind of worked with the package name "patchbot", but it was installed in SAGE_LOCAL.

"build dep" is probably the wrong description--but I just meant a developer tool for development of Sage, outside the sage distribution.

To be clear, this is a case where the term "package" is often overloaded in Python:

* Here the package, as in the name of what you import in Python is `patchbot`

* The name in the `setup.py` is different from the package name, and as sometimes referred to as the "distribution name" or the "PyPI name" to reduce confusion.  Often the package name and the distribution name are the same, but they don't have to be.  Either way it shouldn't be relevant here.

I think the main takeaway here is that the patchbot should not be a Sage spkg at all.  It's not a part of sage, the distribution.  It's a tool for testing sage the distribution and as such should be entirely external to it.

So to install the patchbot on say a Linux system one would use `sudo pip install <path/to/tarball>` or even just `sudo pip install sage-patchbot` if the latest version is uploaded to PyPI.

Alternatively this can be done within a virtualenv if we prefer to avoid the system install.

I am doing what I can, but this is a bit too complicated for me to handle easily.

I changed all the imports in such a way that patchbot must now be used a a python package. The simpplest way (and it works) is what I suggest above.

Why do you so strongly object to pip installation in the system python ?

Now if you have better suggestions, I would appreciate help.

I don't understand how the imports should be related to how the package is installed.

> Why do you so strongly object to pip installation in the system python ?


It should be possible to install and run the patchbot without `sudo` access.

Relative imports are not allowed when a python file is run as a script, it seems.

How is it compatible with not installing in the sage python ?

Is there any way to install somewhere inside sage a python package using the system python ? Is there any existing case ? Where should it go ? How should I do that ?

I did have to manually change `PYTHONPATH` for it to work in a user install.

I think you should be able to do

```
./sage --pip install --user patchbot
```

However, since Sage sets `PYTHONUSERBASE` (no idea why), this patchbot is installed in a directory different from what the system Python expects. To get it working, I had to set `PYTHONPATH` to the `site-packages` directory in `~/.sage/local`. Because of confusion between `lib` and `lib64`, just setting `PYTHONUSERBASE` system-wide was not sufficient.

For this reason, I believe that `./sage --patchbot` should set `PYTHONPATH` before running the patchbot.

I propose the following "modus operandi" for patchbot installation and use

* get the latest tarball.tar.gz from somewhere (git or my web page?)
* pip install --user tarball.tar.gz
* sage -patchbot --options (1) OR python -m sage_patchbot.patchbot --options (2)

Everything (pip and python) should take place in the system python. I do not see any reason to involve the inner python of sage.

I am not completely sure if this already works with this branch, but it was my vision of things. I think that I did (1) or (2) on my own patchbot client, which seems to be running well.

Now Jeroen and Eric do not seem to agree on what to do. Please consider that I have not a lot of time to spend on that.

Why not put it on PyPI, and put out some proper releases?

Alternatively, pip allows download direct from a git repository, including specific tags.

> pip install --user tarball.tar.gz


Whatever; people can `pip install` however they're comfortable with.

> Everything (pip and python) should take place in the system python. I do not see any reason to involve the inner python of sage.

> I am not completely sure if this already works with this branch, but it was my vision of things. I think that I did (1) or (2) on my own patchbot client, which seems to be running well.


I don't know.  Is there anything in the patchbot that tries to import `sage`?  I don't *think* there is--as far as I can tell the patchbot can run entirely outside of the sage environment, as it should.

> Now Jeroen and Eric do not seem to agree on what to do. Please consider that I have not a lot of time to spend on that.


AFAICT the only disagreement is over whether or not running `sudo pip install` is ever appropriate.  My point is that it doesn't really matter--as long as the user is installing into a Python outside of the Sage distribution (be it a virtualenv, a `--user` install, or whatever) it should work fine.  It doesn't really matter and the most appropriate choice depends on the context.

For that matter, there's probably nothing wrong with installing the patchbot package into Sage's Python too, again just using `pip install`.  But in general it should not be necessary to.

Let us try to move forward, please. This works, as far as I can tell.

The patchbot package is installed in the system python, not as root but as user.

I would prefer not to use pypi for the moment.

Could somebody try to follow exactly the instructions and see if everything runs smoothly ?

Thanks for the feedback.

These are not the instructions on how to run the patchbot given in the ticket description.

But this will be another possible way.

Librae is meeting a whole bunch of doctest failure with lrslib. Maybe it should be checked that the bot is not causing them.

Concerning pypi, it may be simpler once done, but I am not really ready to add yet another layer of complexity.

Concerning the log, I would prefer to postpone the problem, once the new setting is in place.

You've already fixed up the patchbot to use distutils properly, so this is a matter of making an account on PyPI, setting up your credentials, and running `./setup.py register upload`.  There's no additional layer of complexity.

Indeed. If the patchbot is a Python package it is much more natural to use it without the Sage environment variables set.

> Librae is meeting a whole bunch of doctest failure with lrslib. Maybe it should be checked that the bot is not causing them.


Not the bot: #21012

> Concerning pypi, it may be simpler once done, but I am not really ready to add yet another layer of complexity.


It is not a new layer. It is simply a way to distribute the module. Instead of having a tarball on your webpage there is a tarball on PyPI.

Mainly just for convenience. It's easier to type `./sage --patchbot` than `python -m sage_patchbot.patchbot --sage-root=SAGE_ROOT`.

Second reason: on most systems, `python` is installed system-wide. But `pip` often is not.

I have tried to enhance the description of the ticket.

I am not willing to avoid the dependency to pip.

I think one can reasonably expect anybody wanting to run a patchbot to be able to install pip first. There is no need to call "sage -pip".

I propose the following alternative:

(1) disable completely "sage --patchbot"

(2) use "sage --patchbot" as a convenient way to launch the patchbot installed in the system python.

I vote for (2), which is the current situation with the branch. I have just added some explanation text to appear when "sage --patchbot" is called.

+1

As I understand it the purpose of `./sage -foo` is to run the `foo` program that's installed in the sage environment.  I don't see why it should be doing anything else.  At most if `./sage -patchbot` is meant to do *something* it can raise an error if `patchbot` does not happen to be installed in the Sage environment.  Then if one wants they can `./sage -pip install sage-patchbot` and get it in their Sage environment, at which point `./sage -patchbot` is the equivalent of `. sage-env; patchbot`, etc...

Otherwise all one needs to do to run the patchbot is to run `patchbot` however it happens to be installed on a (correctly configured) system.

That's easy: I just need to check both the Python-in-Sage and the system Python.

However, there seems to be disagreement (see @videlec and @embray) about what `./sage --patchbot` **should** actually do. There is no point in fixing the branch if I have to throw it away anyway.

- make so that `sage -patchbot` just prints:

```
The patchbot can no longer be run in this way.
Please see https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot/details for up-to-date instructions.

I would accept this solution.

A working Python installation is not the same as a working `pip` installation.

The fact that `./sage --patchbot` does not require the user to change his `$PATH`.

It effectively is.  `pip` is the official installer for Python packages and comes with modern distributions of Python (including most system distributions).  While you can have a "working" Python installation *without* pip, a Python installation with a non-working pip installation is not a working Python installation.

Why would a user need to change their path?

Then pip becomes an additional requirement for running the Sage patchbot. Many systems come with Python installed system-wide, but without pip.

I agree.  I think "invoking sage" here should be read as "activating the sage environment" which is true.  There's no more reason to run `sage --patchbot` than there is to run `sage --make` (which is not a thing, but offers the same "convenience").

That option is actually called `sage -i` :-)

In all seriousness: I really want to support a `sage_patchbot` installed within Sage itself.

You may argue that this is weird. But on the other hand: why not support it? You need good arguments to *explicitly not support* something. I never said that this should be the only way.

You cannot use the Python-in-Sage to run the patchbot because that one might be reinstalled: the patchbot builds Sage so it might rebuild the Python-in-Sage too. And reinstalling a program that you are running is a recipe for trouble.

+1 on using the system Python.

-1 on including the patchbot as part of the sage distribution in any way.

-1 on supporting `sage --patchbot`. 

I think it's inviting trouble to have the testing framework depend in any way on scripts of the software to be tested.

This ticket seems stalled because jdemeyer insists to support running patchbot installed inside Sage by the system python using Sage interface, whose idea is objected by some others.

The main objective of the ticket is to make it official to install the patchbot only as a package to the system python. This objective is in direct conflict with the jdemeyer's idea.

So my suggestion is to separate the script implementing jdemeyer's idea from the present ticket, and he opens a ticket for his script. This will facilitate closing this ticket.

Absolutely not, there is no conflict! I just want one *additional* way to run the patchbot which does not harm other ways of running the patchbot.

I don't see why people are so much against an additional feature. I'm not forcing anybody to run the patchbot "my way", I just want to keep the possibility.

>`--sage-root=`
1. the parameter should be called `--sage-testing-root=` (or similar) rather than `sage-root`: several sage installations may exists on a system. Especially sage-root might be menthally associated with the production-sage root directory.

2. The option `sage-testing-root` should be added as a config file parameter.

If supporting `'sage -patchbot'` works as expected (starts the user-local or system installation of the patchbot and also uses the system python) and does not cause any serious harm (including maintenance issues) I would not insist on the complete removal of 'sage -patchbot'.
A compromise between the two different opinions here could be to print a message that running `'sage -patchbot'` is no longer the preferred way to run the patchbot and point to the buildbot wiki.


> sloppy script 

what is exactly the issue of the script by Jeroen?

I just discovered that it is, but in the config file the parameter name has to `be sage_root` (underscore instead of a dash), so here is an inconsistency. Also please update the wiki instructions `https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot/details` accordingly.

> is the Sage installation that you want to test.


If I want to test a sage installation I just type './sage -t --all ' 

Of course you mean that 'sage-root' is here the folder where patchbot will test various tickets (and thus various sage versions)

> IMHO, it's obvious that the `--sage-root` when running the patchbot is the Sage installation that you want to test.  


Since you formally failed to correcly explain what `--sage-root` means, I do not buy that 'it is obvious', at least not for a new patchbot user.  So I find the 'sage-root' patchbot option should be at lieast documented (what it does) on the wiki and in the software and the inconsistency between 'sage_root' and 'sage-root' should be removed (underscore vs dash) 

By the way; it is well known that naming is one important part of software development and it may create mental blockades or misunderstandings.

In summary: 
I expect as minimal action to gain positive review that 'sage_root' gets documented in the software and in the wiki
(https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot/details) and the inconsistency between 'sage_root' and 'sage-root' is removed (underscore in config file vs dash in command line option)

Since this ticket seems not to reach a consensus, what about splitting it into two part:

* remove patchbot optional spkg, and deprecate the related `sage -patchbot` command (this can be done for next beta)
* discuss and write a convenient alternative command or documentation to run the patchbot (this seems the blocking point and might require more time)

I can volonteer to implement the first point on top of the latest beta ;)

Doesn't "deprecate the related `sage -patchbot` command" relate more to the second point instead of the first?

So I would rather split up as

1. remove patchbot optional spkg
2. discuss how to run the patchbot and what to do with `sage --patchbot`

OK, I did not deprecate the command, but since the current `sage -patchbot` command does not work anyway, i replaced it with a short sentence pointing to https://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot#Installing_the_patchbot (which are the most up-to-date instructions).

That would imply someone has their `~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` on `sys.path`, but not `~/.local/bin` in their `$PATH`.  That can certainly happen (I think it is the default in most cases) but I would consider it a slight misconfiguration.  It is also not a problem at all if using virtualenvs instead.

My feeling at this point is along the lines of "I'm not going to use it, but if it suits your needs then fine." :)
