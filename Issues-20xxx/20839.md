Implement basic intersection analysis, such as when given two curves and a point, determine if the point is in the intersection of the two curves, and if so, compute the intersection multiplicity of the curves at that point if defined. Also, given a projective curve, determine if it is a complete intersection.

- intersects_at(): why not but both attempts in the same try block?


- is_complete_intersection: Boolean can go on the same line at OUTPUT
not the radical ideal per our discussion today

here is another noncomplete intersection example

```
P.<x,y,z,w>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,3)
X= Curve([x*z-y^2,z*(y*w-z^2) - w*(x*w-y*z)])
X.is_complete_intersection()
```

- intersection_multiplicity: an integer can go on the same line as OUTPUT

good these add up to 4 as bezout's theorem implies

```
K.<i>=QuadraticField(-1)
A.<x,y>=AffineSpace(K,2)
C = Curve([x^2-y])
D = Curve([x^2+y^2])
for t in C.intersection(D).rational_points():
    C.intersection_multiplicity(D,t)
```

also good

```
K.<i>=QuadraticField(-1)
A.<x,y>=AffineSpace(K,2)
C = Curve([y^2-x^3])
D = Curve([(x^2+y^2)^2 - 4*x^2*y^2])
for t in C.intersection(D).rational_points():
    C.intersection_multiplicity(D,t)
```

so for plane curves this looks ok. Does this really work in dimension greater than 2? I don't think it does, I think the intersection number possibly has lower order terms.  Regardless, in looking at this, the following  example died

```
K.<i>=QuadraticField(-1)
A.<x,y,z>=AffineSpace(K,3)
C = Curve([x^2-y,z^2+x^2])
D = Curve([x^2+y^2,x^2+z])
for t in C.intersection(D).rational_points():
    C.intersection_multiplicity(D,p)
```



- I think an transverse check would be nice too:

is_transverse() - Returns true if and only if the point p is a nonsingular point of both plane curves C and D and the curves have distinct tangents there.

Thanks, I made most of the changes, but haven't yet addressed the intersection_multiplicity issue. Is there a good way to generalize the intersection multiplicity computations to work for space curves, or would it be best to make them specific to plane curves?

I really don't have much homological algebra background, but if I understand correctly, I think a general definition of intersection multiplicity is given by Serre's Tor formula. I think Singular has some functionality for working with the needed constructions, but I'm not sure whether it's enough to be able to do multiplicity computations.
