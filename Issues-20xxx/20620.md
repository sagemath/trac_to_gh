May I dare ask for more explanations ? Do you expect this to work and pass doctests ?

By the way, your changes to the license banners are not pep8 compliant.

That `del` is very important since it won't cause doctests to pick up the `__future__` imports.
The doctesting framework checks the imports from `__future__` and applies those when testing. Because we do `from sage.all import *`, the `__future__` imports from `sage.all` would appear in the globals. But this is not the case if we delete those variables.

ok, then. Thanks for the explanations.

My aim is now therefore to remove the del for the print_function.

Pep8 now apparently requires that the comment sign `#` be followed by a space.
