That `del` is very important since it won't cause doctests to pick up the `__future__` imports.
The doctesting framework checks the imports from `__future__` and applies those when testing. Because we do `from sage.all import *`, the `__future__` imports from `sage.all` would appear in the globals. But this is not the case if we delete those variables.

<a id='comment:8'></a>ok, then. Thanks for the explanations.

My aim is now therefore to remove the del for the print_function.

Pep8 now apparently requires that the comment sign `#` be followed by a space.
