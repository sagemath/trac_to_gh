That `del` is very important since it won't cause doctests to pick up the `__future__` imports.
The doctesting framework checks the imports from `__future__` and applies those when testing. Because we do `from sage.all import *`, the `__future__` imports from `sage.all` would appear in the globals. But this is not the case if we delete those variables.
