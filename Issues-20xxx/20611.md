This ticket adds some more functions to check the following cryptographic properties of an S-Box
1. Determine whether this S-Box is plateaued function
2. Determine whether the S-Box is bent.
3. Determine whether the S-Box is an involution.

Plus, I have provided two helper functions for S-Box construction based on Feistel and MISTY structure. This is quite common to see in some recent lightweight S-Boxes (see http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/711.pdf).

Hi,\\
You might want to use more pythonic syntax e.g.


```python
def substitute(x):
    mask = (1 << b) - 1
    xl = (x >> b) & mask
    xr = x & mask
    for sb in sboxes:
        xl, xr = sb(xl) ^ xr, xl
    return (xl << b) | xr
```

also in my opinion `is_bent` should return `False` instead of raising `ValueError`.
