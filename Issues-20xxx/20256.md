I can try to work on this, since it's only a couple of lines, but I don't know where in the code this is supposed to happen?

For conversion from Sage to PARI: add a `_pari_()` method to the object that you want to convert.

For conversion from PARI to Sage: see `gentoobj()` in `src/sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx`.

From Sage to PARI, there was already a dummy method returning a `NotImplementedError`, so I changed that.

From PARI to SAGE, in addition to `gentoobj()`, I also touched `gen.type()`.

A few details:

In `infinity.py`:

1. Remove the commented-out line `#from sage.libs.all import pari, pari_gen` (I don't know why the import does not work, but that's not so important)

2. Is there a possibility that `self._sign` is not 1 or -1? It might be safer to use `if self._sign >= 0: .... else: .....` and remove the `raise TypeError`.

3. Replace `TESTS::` by `EXAMPLES::` in the `_pari_()` documentation.

In `gen.pyx`:

4. Add doctests for both pieces of added code.
