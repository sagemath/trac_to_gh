As far as I can tell this builds fine.  I think at the time this `spkg-install` was written Cygwin-64 just wasn't supported yet.

I don't know whether or not there are any specific runtime issues with this.  I don't have any reason to believe there are but I've still barely begun to crack into the failing tests on Cygwin.

Do we really need to hardcode the `ABI` value? Doesn't GMP auto-detect this?

Maybe at that time Cygwin64 was not officialy supported and some "*cygwin*" regexp forced 32 bits builds.
It might be the case things have changed...
