Currently, a plot of the identity matrix yields a mostly black square, with white squares on the diagonal. Don't we all expect the opposite?

In particular, the current choice of color map attributes the background color (white) to the maximum intensity, while we usually expect the maximum intensity to 'stand out', and not be invisible.

This branch fixes it.

IMO this can't be said as a clear bug, so I changed this to enhancement.

E.g., what is matplotlib's actual default for `imshow()` in this situation?

The default behaviour seems to be what you get by setting 'cmap' to None:

```
sage: matrix.random(IntegerModRing(5),5,5).plot(cmap=None)
```

It also matches the examples given there:

If you see a smart way to do it, you are welcome to add a commit. I'm 100% sure that none of those who call this method will read the docstring *before* they notice the change. And if they do read the doc afterwards, all they can learn there is "Yeah, there has been a change".

This ticket seems unrelated to the color scale.

Do you have any question that would force us to keep this in `needs_info`? Do you want to start a sage-devel thread?

Alternatively, and to prove some intellectual honesty:

Can you show the two pictures to any colleague of yours, and ask them which one they feel is the most natural to represent the identity matrix?

```
sage: matrix.identity(15).plot(cmap='gray')
sage: matrix.identity(15).plot(cmap='Greys')
```

I did it with two colleagues of mine, both of which gave the same answer. I was very careful to not give them any hint of what I was thinking. The second even said that "it's even better to have a lot of white for sparse matrices, as having mostly black uses more ink when printed".

None of then had any hesitation.

Correct, the much-maligned `jet`.  Apparently there is not default grayscale, though as I say above `gray` seems to be the most-used.

So there are a few questions here.
* Do we want to change the scale
* Do we want to keep it grayscale
* What is the "most popular" way to deal with grayscale in mpl and matlab
* If we change, how to alert users to this change in an efficient manner.

I would have agreed with your colleagues, personally, before getting used to Sage's way of doing it.

Shall we take this to sage-devel?  I'm emailing Jason Grout about it since his perspective from mostly doing IPython stuff nowadays will be valuable, having also worked on this stuff in the past.

The fact that this information may not have ever appeared on a public forum is a sufficient reason to not require of a ticket's author to produce it: otherwise every non-explained design decision becomes impossible to fix.

I don't think you should be allowed to revert `positive_review` status because of such a request. If you find it, however, and if the reason you find there is compelling, then of course that would not be a problem as it reopens the discussion.

> Especially if it can be done by emailing a few people.  Rather than just up and deciding.

You are overlooking that this patch was reviewed by a Free Man. I'm not being overly 
authoritarian here.

Ok, here is a question.  What should we expect about these?

```
sage: matrix([[0,0,],[1,1]]).plot()
sage: matrix([[-1,-1],[1,1]]).plot()
sage: matrix([[-10,-10],[0,0]]).plot()
sage: matrix([[0,0],[0,0]]).plot()
sage: matrix([[-100,0],[100,0]]).plot()
```

As to modifying documentation, I think it would be good to be more specific about the default here (writing for the current)

```
    If the matrix is dense, each matrix element is given a different
    color value depending on its relative size compared to the other
    elements in the matrix. 
+   The default is for the lowest number to be black and the highest
+   number to be white in a greyscale pattern; see the information about
+   normalizing below.
```
One could add

```
+   To achieve the lowest number to be white and the highest black, use
+   `cmap='Greys'` (see below for syntax).
```
or whatever is appropriate.  Similarly, with the sparse matrices it would be super-helpful to say why the "unexpected" is done - compatibility with matplotlib/matlab.

I can document whatever we do once we agree on something, since it appears that no one on sage-devel cares about this, so hopefully we can find a consensus here.  But I am not really sure there is an "obvious" answer for the last matrix.  See also the `norm` and `vmin` and `vmax`, e.g.

```
sage: matrix([[-100,0],[100,0]]).plot(norm='value')
<three black squares, currently>
```

Or even compare

```
sage: matrix([[-10,0],[0,10]],sparse=True).plot()
sage: matrix([[-10,0],[0,10]],sparse=False).plot() # current default
sage: matrix([[-10,0],[0,10]],sparse=False).plot(cmap='Greys') # your suggestion
```
So I'm not really sure what to do about this, as the whole point of a scale is that it goes negative to positive.

```
sage: identity_matrix(10).plot() # agreed, not ideal
sage: (-1*identity_matrix(10)).plot() # ?!#$$!
```
There is a fundamental discord between wanting things to behave like the sparse where zero is white, and wanting to be able to do a whole range from negative to positive.

---

Also annoying but probably not worth doing on this ticket: `matrix_plot?` is helpful but `matrix().plot?` is not.

Nathann, you have to recognize that some people's lives and jobs simply cannot revolve around Trac.  As you often point out, no one is paid to do this, so it is unreasonable to expect that everyone has the ability or time to respond quickly, for any definition of quickly.  There certainly is no malice in my delay.

You said in a previous comment that the type of doc proposed is fine by you.  There was no response on sage-devel, so by a 2-1 vote I am okay with changing to this color scheme.  I will update it.  But I cannot do it at anyone's beck and call, and I simply have had no time.   I haven't even had time to finish releasing a new sagenb package, which is now considered a blocker for the next Sage release.  Please have patience; it *will* get done.

I can hear that you have other things to do.

Please hear that I work with matrices, that I created a ticket to fix a bug I meet, and that by making this work wait you create more work for me, because I have to keep reapplying this branch over and over, while I juggle between what I need to work and other tickets I review.

So this 'waiting to get this merged', which you may think has a zero cost, actually has a cost for me.

I will bear that cost a bit longer as you ask me to. On the other hand, if you don't think you will have time soon, you can also let this ticket pass: I will be quite happy to (quickly) review a doc addition in another ticket when you will find the time you need.
