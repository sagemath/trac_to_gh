You really should use new-style classes. Old-style classes exist only for backwards compatibility and will be gone in Python 3.

Fun: from the same premises, we arrive at opposite conclusions :-)

Here is my logical chain:

In Python 3 we won't make the inheritance from object explicit: it would be
redundant to write:

```
        class XXXMethods(object):
```

Furthermore, for our XXXMethods classes, it does not matter whether
they are old style or new style classes (they just are bags of
methods). Thus it feels natural to use right away the Python 3
idiom. That's what we have been doing in all the categories.

That's on purpose, for consistency with what we do in categories: the `XXXMethods` are meant to be pure mixins / bags of methods; they are not supposed to inherit from anything.

How is a random Sage developer supposed to know that?

It might matter in more places than you think. There will be some porting effort needed to transition from old-style classes to new-style classes (some issues came up in #20686). It would be better to do this now to avoid unexpected issues with Python 3.

For this reason, I am very against this change:

```diff
-    class EvaluationMethods(object):
+    class EvaluationMethods:
```

I already did tests with inheriting from object in some XXXMethods,
and the category framework kept working the exact same way. I am
therefore convinced there won't be anything to change for that
specific aspect for Python 3.

Furthermore, the more consistent things will be across the library,
the easier the porting will be.

So you did some limited testing now and it worked. That's a good thing, but it doesn't guarantee that it will work in all cases now and in the future. As a general principle, we should try to move Sage as close to Python 3 as possible. Python 3 has only new-style classes, so we should use new-style classes.

True, but besides the point.

And of course, this just means that we should use new-style classes everywhere in Sage.

Using a metaclass would mean one more piece of purely technical
syntax, which is one more chance for the programmer to forget
something. Still you have a good point here: the infrastructure should
check that XXXMethods inherits from nothing, and raise an explanatory
error message if not.

That's the problem with every framework: a Django programmer needs to
learn some about Django, etc, either from example by looking at
existing code, or by reading the documentation.

Now does Sage really need such a framework? I am convinced enough
about it to have invested altogether one solid year of work into
it. Which does not mean I am not completely wrong :-)

I also believe in concise syntax with minimal boilerplate. Of course
the price is additional complexity for those developers like you that
not only use, but also work on the infrastructure itself.

Cheers,

Everywhere, unless we have a good reason to be convinced this does not make a difference.

Would we really gain something worth the trouble by adding an explicit inheritance from object in all 292 XXXMethods classes in Sage, and then removing them after the switch to Python3, with all the risks of induced syntactical conflicts, when we know that they are treated uniformly?

There are real issues in the switch to Python 3, and I believe this is not one.

Cheers,

I'm not saying a metaclass is the right solution, it was just some proposal. That being said, you could think if there are other ways in which your "bag-of-methods" classes differ from "real" classes. Such differences might be handled cleanly by such metaclass.

I know :-) but sometimes that concise syntax just hides all kinds of stuff which is better made explicit. Like I said before: if I see a `class`, I expect it to behave like a `class`.

The hypothetical metaclass would also serve as entry point to documentation. If I see

```
class ElementMethods(BagOfStuff):
    ....
```
somewhere and want to understand what it does, I could do

```
sage: BagOfStuff?
```
which will hopefully explain that this class isn't really a class, but just some syntax to define a dict.

I don't know those `XXXMethods` classes well enough to say whether it's the right solution, but it's certainly something you should consider.

And this `BagOfStuff` would of course be a new-style class, rendering the other discussion obsolete :-)

I know I am repeating myself, but just to clear, I think there are two possible ways:

1. Either you use a plain `class XXXMethods` but then it should behave like a class.

2. Or it's something else, say `class XXXMethods(BagOfStuff)` and then you can have all kinds of strange behaviour that you document in `BagOfStuff?`.
