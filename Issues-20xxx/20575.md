`G.random_edge()` will raise an exception if the graph `G` has no edges at all. (Not a good exception, but at least something.) I suggest this one also to raise something instead of returning nothing.

First of all you would better use `choice(my_list)` rather than `my_list[randint(0,length-1)]`.

And in the case of an empty graph I would either:
- raise an `EmptySetError` (from `sage.categories.sets_cat`)
- return an empty iterator, for example `return iter([])`

But anyway, you would better document the behavior of this special case.

I was not aware of the `choice()` method. Thanks.

For empty graphs, I checked what is done for `edge_iterator` and I propose to follow it, that is do nothing. I have added appropriate tests.

When the test involves some randomness it is better to put a `#random` flag

```
sage: give_me_a_random_stuff()  # random
haha
```
That way the method is checked but not the actual matching with the output.

If you forward all arguments, it might be better to have both arguments and named arguments forwarded as in

```
def f(*args, **kwds):
    whatever(*args, **kwds)
```
