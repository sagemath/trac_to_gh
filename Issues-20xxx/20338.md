The code (schemes/generic/scheme.py) does this:

 ```
   return self(self.coordinate_ring().zero_ideal())
```
if the scheme's coordinate ring is not the integers.  The coordinate ring need not be a domain, in which case the zero ideal is not prime (hence not a point in the prime spectrum).

I am not clear on the proper fix.  I suspect for random rings, it's not easy to cobble up a prime ideal.  At a minimum, the above could be called when the ring is a domain.

**Keywords:** spec, coordinate ring

You might want to do

```
def _an_element_(self):
    from sage.categories.domains import Domains
    if self.coordinate_ring() in Domains():
          return self(self.coordinate_ring().zero_ideal())
    else:

Is an_element() always supposed to return "0" in some guise?  In any case, if the ring is "known", we can handle it (PID, UFD, domain, ...), no?

Replying to [justin](#comment%3A2):

Not at all. This method is intended to be used in testing suites (i.e. when you perform `TestSuite(my_object).run()`). The less trivial the answer is, the best it is.

Sure. I was just proposing the laziest solution. You might even want to implement a method `some_elements` that is also used in the test suites.
