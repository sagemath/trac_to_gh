```
The code (schemes/generic/scheme.py) does this:

 ```
   return self(self.coordinate_ring().zero_ideal())
```
if the scheme's coordinate ring is not the integers.  The coordinate ring need not be a domain, in which case the zero ideal is not prime (hence not a point in the prime spectrum).

I am not clear on the proper fix.  I suspect for random rings, it's not easy to cobble up a prime ideal.  At a minimum, the above could be called when the ring is a domain.

Keywords: **spec, coordinate ring**

Component: **PLEASE CHANGE**

Is an_element() always supposed to return "0" in some guise?  In any case, if the ring is "known", we can handle it (PID, UFD, domain, ...), no?
