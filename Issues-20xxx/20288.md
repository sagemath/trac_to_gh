When doing arithmetic with a `QQbar` element, operations subtly mutate the elements which should be constant.

In the example below, we see that `M^2` is displayed differently after we compute the rank of `M`:

```
sage: M = matrix(QQbar, 2, 2, [1, sqrt(-3), -sqrt(-3), 3])
sage: M^2
[   4.000000000000000?  6.928203230275509?*I]
[-6.928203230275509?*I    12.00000000000000?]
sage: rank(M)
1
sage: M^2
[                    4  6.928203230275509?*I]
[-6.928203230275509?*I                    12]
```
One can easily see the difference in the `__dict__` of the upper right element:

```
sage: M = matrix(QQbar, 2, 2, [1, sqrt(-3), -sqrt(-3), 3])
sage: M[0,1].__dict__
{'_descr': Root 1.7320508075688772935?*I of x^2 + 3,
 '_value': 1.7320508075688772935?*I}
sage: rank(M)
1
sage: M[0,1].__dict__
{'_descr': -2*a + 1 where a^2 - a + 1 = 0 and a in 0.50000000000000000? - 0.866025403784439?*I,
 '_value': 1.73205080756887729352744634150587236694?*I}
```

That would of course be better, but I don't know how feasible that is.

Look at the method `interval_exact`: exactification will occur only when the number looks like an exact float. Though, using this approach will change representations of elements in `QQ`. And without exactification, we have no way to detect rationality...
