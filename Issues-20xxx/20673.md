#4967 -- to completely disallow users to install Gap packages or configure anything in order to make the Sage build more isolated -- was short sighted and should be reverted.

Just revert it.  Sage can't and shouldn't protect its build against all possible user-level configuration on their system -- VM's or containers are better for doing that.

Also #4967 makes it completely impossible for a user to install their own package and use a system-wide install of sage.

Not sure if installing out of GAP tree works for GAP packages building "GAP kernel extensions", some sort of dynamic libraries runtime linked by GAP.
One such package is called io, see http://gap-system.org/Packages/io.html

I actually use the IO package compiled this way. Everything seems to work fine, though my usage is not really extensive (pickling, writing, reading, un-pickling).

Of course there might be problems when sage-used version of GAP changes -- but this becomes users responsibility to keep their locally installed packages up-to-date.

This is with io, right? So it loads, right? Could you test that it *works* in libgap, too? In fact I am about to start creating Sage package with io, json, and perhaps few other packages, too.

Downloading io-4.4.6.tar.bz2\\
./configure (with the appropriate --with-gaproot=)\\
copying folder to ./.gap/pkg as io\\
and then

```
