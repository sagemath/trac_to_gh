<a id='comment:11'></a>I have rewritten this ticket. It was not checked if the reduction at p is good ordinary. Also the condition at the auxiliary prime was exactly the opposite of what it should be. 

Anyway, this is now ready.

To avoid the possibility of conflicts, I have put this on top of #20254 and set that as a dependency.
