But trac does not seem to accept two words keyphrase. Trying to put "foo bar, xyzzy" as keywords does just what "foo, bar, xyzzy" would do. lattice_poset maybe?

> However, you're free to build here upon #20669 before it gets released in a beta.


True, but Volker releases betas so often that it makes no big delay.

I would write the input section as:

```
        - ``element_constructor`` -- string; can be one of the following:

          * ``'lattice'`` - (the default) elements of the lattice will
            be lattices that correspond to sublattices of ``self``
          * ``'tuple'`` - elements are tuples of elements of the
            sublattices of ``self``
          * ``'integer'`` - the elements are plain integers
```
Also, it looks like you have an unneeded import of `DiGraph`. Otherwise LGTM.
