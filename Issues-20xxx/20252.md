This script is written with the assumption that it doesn't get run on its own but instead via `sage-spkg`. Any errors in this script will result in an error message from `sage-spkg`. So while we could add more error-checking, I don't think it's really necessary.

Are sure you are fixing the right bug (that is to say, did you reproduce this on your python 2.6?)
