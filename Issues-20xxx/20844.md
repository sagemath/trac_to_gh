No -- but I did not test it, I only looked at the code changes.
Am I right in thinking that with the old code 3/2 rounded down to 0, while with the new Z(3)/2 is is an exact rational?  Or a float 1.5?  In all three places, a float would be sufficient, in case that is better.

3/2 was previously rounded to 1, and is now the rational 3/2.

I think everything will become a float at some point, but there should be no need to
do that too early.

`@`cremona, do you want to test more thoroughly before saying ok ? The bot is green, which
means that all our doctests pass. Now you may want to check against a larger test set of your own, maybe ?
