I regularly get this. I'm not sure whether it is a random failure or not, it might be because of doing `make distclean` first:

```

Not the right place to discuss it. But yes I know, and I have been burned a couple of times. But it is very handy for what I do. However it happens on a special branch of the sage-on-gentoo overlay which normal user are not supposed to touch and very few know about.
