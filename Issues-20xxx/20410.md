The units library lacks tab completion. This would help discovering units, and typing them it more quickly.

Current:

```
sage: units
Collection of units: acceleration amount_of_substance ... volume
sage: units.mass
Collection of units of mass: amu assay_ton ... tonne wey
sage: units.m<tab>
*does nothing*
```

This implements:

```
sage: units.m<tab>
mass ...
sage: units.mass.p<tab>
units.mass.pennyweight  units.mass.pondus       units.mass.pound        units.mass.pound_troy   
```

(feature request from seing a friend using it).

You should remove the method `trait_names` that was used for that before (see #19951).

Your solution break the completion of other methods

```
sage: units.__cmp__
<bound method Units.__cmp__ of ...>
sage: units.__<tab>
* nothing *
```
One solution would be to use the class `sage.interfaces.tab_completion.ExtraTabCompletion` (from #19923).
