In Sage 7.2, the file `src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_g2_finite_field.py` has a class whose entire definition is the following:

```
import hyperelliptic_g2_generic, hyperelliptic_rational_field

class HyperellipticCurve_g2_rational_field(
    hyperelliptic_g2_generic.HyperellipticCurve_g2_generic,
    hyperelliptic_rational_field.HyperellipticCurve_rational_field):
    pass
```
This appears to be a placeholder awaiting a method calling `pari.genus2red` (formerly the separate package `genus2reduction`). Let's make that happen!

Update:
- using `pari.genus2red` happened in #15808
- the file `src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_g2_finite_field.py` was removed in #27633

This ticket thus becomes `duplicate/invalid/wontfix`.

**Keywords:** hyperelliptic curve, genus 2, reduction

**Resolution:** duplicate

Seems that was done in #15808.

File `src/sage/interfaces/genus2reduction.py`, lines 13--14 and line 439:

```
- Jeroen Demeyer (2014-09-17): replace genus2reduction program by PARI
  library call (:trac:`15808`)
```

```
        res = pari.genus2red([P, Q])
```

Setting as invalid/duplicate/wontfix. To confirm,
fill in reviewer field and give positive review.

This ticket actually postdates #15808. However, I can no longer find the class in question; it may have been removed by some other ticket. So for that reason, I agree to declare this a duplicate/wontfix.
