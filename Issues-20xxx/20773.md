Currently, `new_variable` allocates backend indices to MIP variable component indices very dynamically.

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = p.new_variable()
sage: x[7]
x_0
sage: x[2]
x_1
```

Sometimes it could be nice to have a predictable order in the backend; for example, when `.polyhedron()` is to be called. And sometimes it could be nice to declare ahead of time which component indices are valid, making accesses to other indices an error (rather than creating a new backend variable); this could help debug MIP models.

This could look like this:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = p.new_variable(indices=range(7))
sage: p.number_of_variables()
7
sage: x[3]
x_3
sage: x[11]
IndexError: 11 does not index a component of MIPVariable of dimension 1
```
(This is optional; if no `indices` argument is passed, it keeps the fully dynamic current behavior.)

While it might be a little less verbose, it is more conceptually an optional argument if the default was `None`. Then you could also write the doc as

```
        - ``indices`` -- (optional) an iterable of keys; components
          corresponding to these keys are created in order,
          and access to components with other keys will raise an
          error; otherwise components of this variable can be
          indexed by arbitrary keys and are created dynamically
          on access
```
However, I don't care strongly either way. So if you want to keep the current version, then you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Right, but I definitely want to distinguish `[]` from the default argument (and from a discussion on `Polyhedron` I remember that one developer (Volker?) seems to hold the opinion that `None` and `[]` should never (?) be distinguished by Python methods). 

(`indices = []` must give a static-index MIP variable for which any component access is an error.)

That is not a good rule IMO:

```
sage: Partition([])
[]
sage: Partition(None)  # This makes no sense and rightly raises an error.
```
The only thing you have to be careful about is `if foo:` just needs to be `if foo is None:`. It seems like you having such a non-`False`-bool default value is more likely to cause issues given how Python code usually can be written, and it can mean a more arbitrary default that has less meaning for the code. It also does not mesh well with Cython either. I would be curious to hearing what the argument for this is, but I think `None` and `[]` should be considered as distinguishable. Unless you also want `False`, `()`, and `0` to not be distinguishable either? At least, that is what I think the logic of this rule leads me to conclude.
