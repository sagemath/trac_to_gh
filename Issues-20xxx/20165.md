The code for computing the crystal of LS paths takes a significant amount of time reconstructing the family returned by `alphacheck` in the corresponding root system. The proposal is to cache this (which is consistent with what we do for other such functions for root systems, e.g., `simple_roots`). This branch also does some other micro-optimizations which results in about an additional ~5% speedup.

I have pushed to `public/combinat/backend_LS_paths-20165` another branch which does a much more extensive rewrite of the Littelmann path model by implementing a Cython backend which uses lists to represent dense vectors. Doing this brings this example:

```
sage: La = RootSystem(['B',4]).weight_space().fundamental_weights()
sage: B = crystals.LSPaths(La[1]+La[2]+La[3])
sage: B.cardinality()
9009
sage: %time len(list(B))
CPU times: user 3.34 s, sys: 49.6 ms, total: 3.39 s
Wall time: 3.31 s
9009
```
down from around ~21 seconds. Compare this to some other models:

```
sage: La = RootSystem(['B',4]).weight_lattice().fundamental_weights()
sage: B = crystals.NakajimaMonomials('B4', La[1]+La[2]+La[3])
sage: %time len(list(B))
CPU times: user 16 s, sys: 44.2 ms, total: 16 s
Wall time: 16 s
9009
sage: B = crystals.RiggedConfigurations('B4', La[1]+La[2]+La[3])
sage: %time len(list(B))
CPU times: user 57 s, sys: 68.1 ms, total: 57.1 s
Wall time: 57 s
9009
sage: B = crystals.Tableaux('B4', shape=[3,2,1])
sage: %time len(list(B))
CPU times: user 1.7 s, sys: 16.1 ms, total: 1.72 s
Wall time: 1.7 s
9009
sage: B = crystals.AlcovePaths(La[1]+La[2]+La[3])
sage: %time len(list(B))
CPU times: user 2min 12s, sys: 364 ms, total: 2min 13s
Wall time: 2min 13s
9009
```

The drawback of this alternative implementation is that the only works when the weight is given in the weight space. I think, in principle, it should be possible to support other weight lattice realizations (e.g., the ambient spaces), but I'm not sure we want to support that. Another option would be to keep the old implementation around for when we are using another weight lattice realization. The last option would be to push the necessary data to the backend, but this would likely lead to code duplication and a performance penality compared to the current version.

Before I finish this alternative implementation (including doc(tests), looking for code cleanup, making sure it works for the projected level-zero crystal, and/or further optimization), I wanted to get some feedback.

For the record, my opinion is option 1: drop support for non-weight-space input.
