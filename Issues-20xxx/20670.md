Sage does not allow Fq to be defined with a user-supplied polynomial together with a user-supplied primitive element. However, recent (4.0.2 or newer) givaro is able to accept such input and use it.

> Givaro does not allow Fq to be defined with a user-supplied polynomial.


Why do you think that?

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9, modulus=x^2+1)
sage: k
Finite Field in a of size 3^2
sage: k.modulus()
x^2 + 1
sage: type(k)
<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_givaro.FiniteField_givaro_with_category'>
```

my hope is to implement a possibility to supply a primitive element to `GF()`, using this patch as a backend. But I got lost trying to figure out how the current implementation uses givaro.

Could anyone point me to the right place in the code?
