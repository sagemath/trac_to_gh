Sage does not allow Fq to be defined with a user-supplied polynomial together with a user-supplied primitive element. However, recent (4.0.2 or newer) givaro is able to accept such input and use it.

Why do you think that?

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9, modulus=x^2+1)
sage: k
Finite Field in a of size 3^2
sage: k.modulus()
x^2 + 1
sage: type(k)
<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_givaro.FiniteField_givaro_with_category'>

Do you know how to do this on C++ level?

At least, that's what Macaulay2 people came up with, that patch in the ticket branch.
Perhaps they should have done this differently?

In `givgfq.h`, there is

```

GFqDom(const UTT P, const UTT e, const Vector& modPoly);
```
right above the line added by Macaulay2.

Note the subtle difference: it does not take a `generatorPoly` argument in case that matters.

Given a modulus (or not), it can certainly compute a primitive element, although it does have an [option to supply a custom primitive element](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.7/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/___Primitive__Element.html).

my hope is to implement a possibility to supply a primitive element to `GF()`, using this patch as a backend. But I got lost trying to figure out how the current implementation uses givaro.

Could anyone point me to the right place in the code?
