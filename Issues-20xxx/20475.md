Because we should look for a solution which would work generally for all polynomial symbolic functions.

For this ticket, I suggest to remove the changes to the hermite function since that's probably not easily fixed.

The problem has nothing to do with just polynomial symbolic functions. See the example in #20312 or #20060.

I intend to try to fix this (EDIT: I mean #20312), so any hints from you would be welcome.
