That Pynac version has:
* fix for: `assume(x>0)` sets integer flag (#20456)
* fix Maxima crashes by implementing fast Hermite (#20297) and Gegenbauer (#20428) polynomials in Pynac
* some fixes to handling of elements of rings with positive characteristics (#20162)
* Python 3 build fix
* automatic trigonometric and log simplifications
