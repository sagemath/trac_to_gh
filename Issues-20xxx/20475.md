That Pynac version has:
* fix for: `assume(x>0)` sets integer flag (#20456)
* fix Maxima crashes by implementing fast Hermite (#20297) and Gegenbauer (#20428) polynomials in Pynac
* some fixes to handling of elements of rings with positive characteristics (#20162)
* Python 3 build fix
* automatic trigonometric and log simplifications

Because we should look for a solution which would work generally for all polynomial symbolic functions.

For this ticket, I suggest to remove the changes to the hermite function since that's probably not easily fixed.

The problem has nothing to do with just polynomial symbolic functions. See the example in #20312 or #20060.

I intend to try to fix this (EDIT: I mean #20312), so any hints from you would be welcome.
