We further simplify QQbar code by:
- using python operator to indentify binary operators instead of strings. In other words we replace `'+'` by `operator.add`, `'-'` by `operator.sub`, etc
- writing only one function `binop` instead of `addsub` and `muldiv`.
- removing the methods `kind`,  `is_exact`, `is_rational`, `is_field_element` of descriptors and instead use the class themselves
- removing the method `rational_value` and directly access the `_value` attribute
- detect unions earlier in the code to avoid constructing `ANBinaryExpr`

As a consequence of the last items, we have exactification detected earlier

```
sage: sqrt17 = QQbar(17).sqrt()
sage: sqrt19 = QQbar(19).sqrt()
sage: (sqrt17 + sqrt19).exactify()
sage: sqrt17 * sqrt19 + sqrt17 - sqrt19 * sqrt17 - sqrt17
0
```
Instead of `0.?e-17` on the current beta. See also the better output in doctests from the commit `7fa8ed4`.
