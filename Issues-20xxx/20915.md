Keywords: set partition, days78

We would like to implement ways to plot set partitions as chord diagrams. For example, the partition `{{1,2,4},{3}}` should display the McDonald logo<sup>(R)</sup> with a dot below the second arc.

We are thinking to do it in two different ways:

- implement it as a graphic object to display it directly in Sage;
- giving a tikz code to be directly plugged in a latex document;

This is a work in progress, started during the Sage Days 78.

I tried the example

`SP=SetPartitions(4).random_element().plot()` 

and it looked weird.

Everything seems to work fine, but there are a few things that need some polish before this can get into Sage.

- You should have a blankline between methods.
- You should state all types of inputs for the various options in `set_latex_options`. I had to look at the code to figure out what valid inputs are. You might also want to do some validation and/or standardization of the inputs in this method too.
- Remove the sentence `The default values are set in the ``__init__`` function.`. This is actually false with your current implementation, but I do think all default options should be set in the `__init__` for code simplicity.
- The default plot should be ```''```.
- The `INPUT` items should not start with a capital letter.
- `set_latex_options` should take keyword arguments, so `**opts`, that way you can do inputs of the form `SP.set_latex_options(color='blue')`.
- Add some line breaks to try to keep around 80 chars per line.
- Add more examples with the various plot options and use the `.. PLOT::` directive in the `plot` method too.

Just a few more things. Once these are done, then I think this should be at a positive review.

- Thinking a bit, I probably would have `plot = None` (or maybe `False`) instead of `''` to better indicate that it is using set notation, as it different than a type of plot.
- You can link methods by using `:meth:`set_latex_options``.
- Remove the base `else` in `_latex_` as the return as the return in `if latex_options["plot"] == "":` makes the `else` statement vacuous. That way the large block of code is not as indented.
- The example plot in `plot` should be connected to an actual example in order to illustrate what is being plotted.
- Could you break the long line `diag += arc(center=...`.
- Extra blank line in `set_latex_options` before the `color` option.

I've gone ahead and did a sorting as well for the partitions and did a test run and it seems to work again. `@`tscrim wanna try it on your end to double check and then we can do another postive review? I don't see anything else that can be sorted for orderings.

Yep, that works for me, but I am only testing on Ubuntu. I've added a linear plot latex example to make sure we have full test coverage.

From looking at the code, there is no way to have non-deterministic doctests now. Thinking for another second, before it should have been clear that we needed to also sort `self`.
