Thebe is a Jupyter javascript plugin for static sites that allows for
rendering selected divs of the HTML as live cells connected to a
Jupyter server:

  https://oreillymedia.github.io/thebe/

The goal of this ticket is to use this technology to implement live
documentation in the Jupyter notebook as we had in the legacy Sage
notebook.

Kudos to Rob Beezer for pointing us to Thebe in his presentation of
MathBookXML at Sage Days 77.

Steps:
- [X] Configure Sphinx to add the Thebe javascript library in the static page
- [X] Configure Sphinx to add a small header to our html page with:
  - [X] Inclusion of the Thebe javascript
  - [X] Thebe configuration: which divs to make live

    Currently, we include all <pre> tags that contain the "sage:" prompt.

    TODO: shall we change to <pre> tags that start with the "sage:" prompt?

TODO:
- [X] Only activate Thebe if the page is served by a Jupyter instance

  Currently we check that the protocol is http
- [X] A button to activate live cells
- [X] Configure the Jupyter notebook in Sage to somehow provide the
  server configuration to Thebe (not needed in fact)
- [X] Preparse or customize/configure Thebe to support Sage's doctest syntax:
  - [X] Strip out the "sage: " prompts and "....:" and "...  " continuation prompts
  - [X] Strip out the outputs

    Bonus: show the included outputs below the cell until the new output is computed

    What's been done here is: output is show until the "activate" button is clicked.

- [X] Support doctests with several commands by spliting into several cells
- [X] Ship Thebe from a dedicated spkg (#21309).

This ticket solves #17269. Follow-up ticket for possible improvements: #20893.

-- [ ] Add support in Thebe for customizable (continuation) prompts, with
-      striping and splitting as above, and automatic setting of the kernel.
-      The customization option could look like:
-
-      {{{
-         prompts = {
-            "sage: ": {continuations=["....:", "...  "], kernel="sagemath"},
-            ">>>> ": {continuation="...  ", kernel="python"}
-         }
-      }}}
-
-- [ ] Contribute support for Thebe upstream in Sphinx, with:
-
-      - [ ] Explicit markup to specify which code blocks are editable
-            and with which kernel, or setup kernel auto-detection from
-            the prompt.
-
-      - [ ] The possibility for setting a default value for the above
-
-- [ ] Refactor the Sage sphinx configuration to use the above
-
-- [ ] Add support in Thebe for basic export to Jupyter notebooks. A
-      quality loss (in particular in terms of the hierarchical
-      structure) is acceptable.

<a id='comment:25'></a>Hi Thierry,

Thanks for looking at this!

It was Volker's suggestion to just raw copy thebe.js in the sources.

One part of the rationale is simplicity. The other is that, once jupyterlab will have matured out, thebe.js is likely to become a thin layer on top of it, if not just a part of it. So it's not that crucial to take the efforts of a super clean long term solution.

But I don't have a strong opinion either.

Ça c'est gentil!

For the record, I had Florent Cayré on the phone this morning. He started looking at this, but somehow he has a technical issue posting messages on trac which we did not manage to debug. Anyway, we should be able to review this shortly (e.g. tomorrow during the Sage Days).

For this, i had to merge with sage.7.3 because the exact same line in `build/make/deps` changed there. Let us test the build like this (it might take some time). Again, if you plan to do some modifications, do not forget to undo the very last merge (with #21309) before.

<a id='comment:53'></a>Here is some feedback after real-life testing. I am currently teaching for a 3-week Sage tutorial, and there is a workflow issue, somehow `thebe.js` miss the main point of the sagenb live documentation.

On sagenb notebook, say the students work on some thematic tutorial, they do some tests, copy some lecturer's examples and want to keep their changes. What they can do is to click on `File` (top left) and then `Copy worksheet` so that the live documentation becomes a true sagenb worksheet they can save to come back on it later.

In the current case, we can do some tests and modifications (which is great), but all the work is lost when we close the webpage.
