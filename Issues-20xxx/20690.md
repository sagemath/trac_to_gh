Thebe is a Jupyter javascript plugin for static sites that allows for
rendering selected divs of the HTML as live cells connected to a
Jupyter server:

  https://oreillymedia.github.io/thebe/

The goal of this ticket is to use this technology to implement live
documentation in the Jupyter notebook as we had in the legacy Sage
notebook.

Kudos to Rob Beezer for pointing us to Thebe in his presentation of
MathBookXML at Sage Days 77.

Steps:
- [X] Configure Sphinx to add the Thebe javascript library in the static page
- [X] Configure Sphinx to add a small header to our html page with:
  - [X] Inclusion of the Thebe javascript
  - [X] Thebe configuration: which divs to make live

    Currently, we include all <pre> tags that contain the "sage:" prompt.

    TODO: shall we change to <pre> tags that start with the "sage:" prompt?

TODO:
- [X] Only activate Thebe if the page is served by a Jupyter instance

  Currently we check that the protocol is http
- [X] A button to activate live cells
- [X] Configure the Jupyter notebook in Sage to somehow provide the
  server configuration to Thebe (not needed in fact)
- [X] Preparse or customize/configure Thebe to support Sage's doctest syntax:
  - [X] Strip out the "sage: " prompts and "....:" and "...  " continuation prompts
  - [X] Strip out the outputs

    Bonus: show the included outputs below the cell until the new output is computed

    What's been done here is: output is show until the "activate" button is clicked.

- [X] Support doctests with several commands by spliting into several cells
- [X] Ship Thebe from a dedicated spkg (#21309).

This ticket solves #17269. Follow-up ticket for possible improvements: #20893.


Depends on #21309

Everything seems to work (nice!). Some naive questions from a user point of view:

- would it be possible to remove the "sage: " string in the cells? It would be convenient since it perturb the editor. It would even be worse with the continuation "....:" since these are not ignored by the sage preparser...

Less importantly:

- why did you decide to have this "Run" and "Run Again" buttons? These do not exist in the standard Jupyter notebook. Would it be possible to simply remove them?

- the cells are properly executed when pressing "Shift + Enter" but, contrarily to the case of the notebook, after pressing "Shift + Enter" the focus is kept in the same cell. Not sure that it is desirable to move the focus (since the next cell might be very far).

With the current version, the button `activate` does not appear in all situation. It does for the reference manual but not for `Help -> Thematic Tutorials -> Tutorial: Sage Introductory Programming (PREP)`.

Hi Thierry,

Thanks for looking at this!

It was Volker's suggestion to just raw copy thebe.js in the sources.

One part of the rationale is simplicity. The other is that, once jupyterlab will have matured out, thebe.js is likely to become a thin layer on top of it, if not just a part of it. So it's not that crucial to take the efforts of a super clean long term solution.

But I don't have a strong opinion either.

Hi Vincent, Thierry,
Besides merging the latest #21309 when it's polished, do you consider this as ready to go?
It would be nice to be done with this!

I changed the symlink from `local/share/thebejs/thebe.js` to `local/share/thebe/thebe.js` according to the renaming done in #21309. Since the two branches were completely entangled (lot of merges), i went back to the last Florent's commit, fixed the symlink and added (and updated) Nicola's comment in `thebe-sage.js` header. Now the two branches are completely independant, apart from the very last merge.

If you plan to modify something in the current ticket or in #21309, please undo the last merge before, or it will start to knit again.

I did not inspect `thebe-sage.js` as i would have done for Python files. But its behaviour corresponds to the claimed feature and the code seem not malicious. So i guess it will be OK for me once the dependencies will be satisfied.

Thanks Thierry for the final version of #21309 (Jeroen is double checking it right now) and for cleaning the history.

Here is some feedback after real-life testing. I am currently teaching for a 3-week Sage tutorial, and there is a workflow issue, somehow `thebe.js` miss the main point of the sagenb live documentation.

On sagenb notebook, say the students work on some thematic tutorial, they do some tests, copy some lecturer's examples and want to keep their changes. What they can do is to click on `File` (top left) and then `Copy worksheet` so that the live documentation becomes a true sagenb worksheet they can save to come back on it later.

In the current case, we can do some tests and modifications (which is great), but all the work is lost when we close the webpage. We should have a button to export the current state into a (possibly degradated, we do not really care about the subtle html structure) `.ipynb` file that can then be saved.
