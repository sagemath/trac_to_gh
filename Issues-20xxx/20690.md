Thebe is a Jupyter javascript plugin for static sites that allows for
rendering selected divs of the HTML as live cells connected to a
Jupyter server:

  https://oreillymedia.github.io/thebe/

The goal of this ticket is to use this technology to implement live
documentation in the Jupyter notebook as we had in the legacy Sage
notebook.

Kudos to Rob Beezer for pointing us to Thebe in his presentation of
MathBookXML at Sage Days 77.

Steps:
- [X] Configure Sphinx to add the Thebe javascript library in the static page
- [X] Configure Sphinx to add a small header to our html page with:
  - [X] Inclusion of the Thebe javascript
  - [X] Thebe configuration: which divs to make live

    Currently, we include all <pre> tags that contain the "sage:" prompt.

    TODO: shall we change to <pre> tags that start with the "sage:" prompt?

TODO:
- [X] Only activate Thebe if the page is served by a Jupyter instance

  Currently we check that the protocol is http
- [X] A button to activate live cells
- [X] Configure the Jupyter notebook in Sage to somehow provide the
  server configuration to Thebe (not needed in fact)
- [X] Preparse or customize/configure Thebe to support Sage's doctest syntax:
  - [X] Strip out the "sage: " prompts and "....:" and "...  " continuation prompts
  - [X] Strip out the outputs

    Bonus: show the included outputs below the cell until the new output is computed

    What's been done here is: output is show until the "activate" button is clicked.

- [X] Support doctests with several commands by spliting into several cells
- [X] Ship Thebe from a dedicated spkg (#21309).

This ticket solves #17269. Follow-up ticket for possible improvements: #20893.

+- [  ] Configure Sphinx to add a small header to our html page with Thebe configuration: use the Jupyter instance serving the page. We currently use `window.location.origin`; is this the right thing?
+
+- [ ] Currently it takes 10s for 100 prompts while some sage files
+      contain up to 1000 prompts. Profile Thebe and optimize it or use
+      a separate thread to properly support large files.
+
+- [ ] Expand the activate button with a menu or other widgets for user
+      customization of the Jupyter server. This typically would
+      let the user choose between:
+      - tmpnb (will only be useful for Sage when tmpnb will include a
+        Sage kernel)
+      - A local Jupyter server
+      - Whichever Jupyter server the browser is currently connected to?
+      - a user specified server
+
+- [ ] Check whether Jupyter could be configured to dynamically
+      negotiate incoming connections that don't fall within the
+      `-NotebookApp.allow_origin pattern`, by opening a user dialog such
+      as "Page xxx requests starting a new kernel on this server; do
+      you accept? yes/no/always for this site"
+
+- [ ] Add support in Thebe for customizable (continuation) prompts, with
+      striping and splitting as above, and automatic setting of the kernel.
+      The customization option could look like:
+
+      {{{
+         prompts = {
+            "sage: ": {continuations=["....:", "...  "], kernel="sagemath"},
+            ">>>> ": {continuation="...  ", kernel="python"}
+         }
+      }}}
+
+- [ ] Contribute support for Thebe upstream in Sphinx, with:
+
+      - [ ] Explicit markup to specify which code blocks are editable
+            and with which kernel, or setup kernel auto-detection from
+            the prompt.
+
+      - [ ] The possibility for setting a default value for the above
+
+- [ ] Refactor the Sage sphinx configuration to use the above
+
+- [ ] Add support in Thebe for basic export to Jupyter notebooks. A
+      quality loss (in particular in terms of the hierarchical
+      structure) is acceptable.

<a id='comment:25'></a>Hi Thierry,

Thanks for looking at this!

It was Volker's suggestion to just raw copy thebe.js in the sources.

One part of the rationale is simplicity. The other is that, once jupyterlab will have matured out, thebe.js is likely to become a thin layer on top of it, if not just a part of it. So it's not that crucial to take the efforts of a super clean long term solution.

But I don't have a strong opinion either.

+Thebe is a Jupyter javascript plugin for static sites that allows for

I double checked this. Actually, the button does not appear when the pages do  not have cells (the first pages of the PREP are just pictures, no computations), but it does otherwise (see e.g. the "Calculus 1" page), so it is somehow a good feature.

For this, i had to merge with sage.7.3 because the exact same line in `build/make/deps` changed there. Let us test the build like this (it might take some time). Again, if you plan to do some modifications, do not forget to undo the very last merge (with #21309) before.

Do you mind merging this item with the new one you added there?
