This ticket proposes a implementation of Reed Muller Codes. It contains:
    two new code classes, QAryReedMullerCode and BinaryReedMullerCode, which implements the two classes of reed muller codes
    two encoder classes, ReedMullerVectorEncoder and ReedMullerPolynomialEncoder which are used by both the code classes
    some additional functions to assist in computations related to the polynomials.

NOTE: Both the classes are implemented separately since they would have different decoders

I used the following code snippets to test them,

```
#for q>2
code=ReedMullerCode(3, 2, 2)
print code.dimension()
E1=ReedMullerVectorEncoder(code)
E2=ReedMullerPolynomialEncoder(code)
R=PolynomialRing(code.base_field(),code.numberOfVariable,"x")
x0=R.gen(0)
x1=R.gen(1)
c1=E1.encode(vector(GF(3),[1,1,1,1,1,1]))
print c1
c2=E2.encode(1+x0+x1+x1^2+x1*x0)
print c2
D=LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(code)
c=D.decode_to_code(vector(GF(3),[1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1]))
print c
print E2.unencode_nocheck(c)
print D.decode_to_message(vector(GF(3),[1,2,1,0,0,2,1,2,2]))
```
The output of which was,

```
6
(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2)
(1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1)
x0*x1 + x1^2 + x0 + x1 + 1
(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
```

```
#for q=2
code=ReedMullerCode(2, 2, 4)
print code.dimension()
E1=ReedMullerVectorEncoder(code)
E2=ReedMullerPolynomialEncoder(code)
R=PolynomialRing(code.base_field(),code.numberOfVariable,"x")
x0=R.gen(0)
x1=R.gen(1)
x2=R.gen(2)
x3=R.gen(3)
c1=E1.encode(vector(GF(2),[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]))
print c1
c2=E2.encode(1+x0+x1+x2+x3*x2)
print c2
D=LinearCodeSyndromeDecoder(code)
c=D.decode_to_code(vector(GF(2),[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]))
print c
print E2.unencode_nocheck(c)
print D.decode_to_message(vector(GF(2),[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]))
```
This gave the output as:

```
11
(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)
(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1)
(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1)
x2*x3 + x0 + x1 + x2 + 1
(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
```

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

Hello,

I started reading your code.
Before giving actual comments on the code itself, here are some general comments:

- there is certain conventions to respect while writing Python code. You can find a summary of these conventions [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style).

- lines are supposed to be less than 80 characters long. As I think it's an old rule, I'm completely ok if some lines are around 100 characters, especially in the doctests block which might be hard to break. However, some lines in your code are just too long: e.g. l. 58 is 161 characters long, l.92 is 144 characters long...). A general tip: in Python, as long as you are in the same parenthesis block, you can jump to the next line without any special character. For instance, this:

```
poly=poly+z*multivariatePolynomialInterpolation([evaluation2[i][k] for i in range(nq)], numberOfVariable-1, order-k, q, finiteField, _R)
```

can be written like this:

```
poly=poly+z*multivariatePolynomialInterpolation([evaluation2[i][k] for i in range(nq)],
        numberOfVariable-1, order-k, q, finiteField, _R)
```

- on names: in python, methods and variables names are written like this `function_name` and `variable_name` (and not `functionName` and `variableName`). Module names should follow the same convention (`reed_muller_code.py` instead of `ReedMullerCode.py`).

- You wrote the documentation for a few methods like this:

```
r"""
DOC
"""
def my_func:
    code
```

but it should *always* be like this:

```
def my_func:
    r"""
    DOC
    """
    code
```

- More of the same, this DOC block should always be formatted like this:

```
def my_func(i1, i2):
    r"""
    Short description of my_func return value 
    (Should be something like "Returns ....")

    [optional] more details

    INPUT:

    - ``i1`` -- description of i1

    - ``i2`` -- description of i2

    [optional] OUTPUT

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: ...

    [optional] TESTS::

        sage: ...
``` 

- you should always put one whitespace before and after operators (exception: precedence), e.g:
  - `a = b + c`
  - `a = (b+c) * (b-c)`

- you used full names for variables everywhere but for `_R`. I think it would be better to rename it `polynomial_ring` or something like that.

I'll run tests this afternoon and probably come back with more comments on the code itself.
Don't worry about all my comments in formatting, it's your first big ticket for Sage, so it's perfectly normal to use wrong coding conventions. It takes some time to get used to it `;)` 

Best,

David

So, we should just keep what you did :)\n\n*multivariate_polynomial_interpolation*\n\nI'd make it a private method as it's only used internally as a helper.\nI would also change the name `_R` to `polynomial_ring`. It's probably something\nyou copied from my poor naming choice in grs.py... I changed it in #20744 in the meanwhile ;)\n\nI'd also rename some variables: `evaluation2` might be `multipoint_evaluation_list` or something like that. I would also change the name `nq`, but I don't have any idea here. I would also rename `finiteField` as `base_field` for consistency.\nYou should be careful with `0`s and `1`s: the `0` l. 87 is not the same as the one on line 89: the former is the zero of the base field while the latter is the zero of the multivariate polynomial ring where `poly` lives.\nI recommend using specific variables for these zeroes/ones, which you can define as follows: `base_field_zero = base_field.zero()`.\n\n*ReedMullerCode*\n\n- you need to add `::` in the end of your second example's descriptive sentence.\n\n*General remark on classes*\n\n- Most of your class parameters are public variables that one has to call directly (e.g. `C.numberOfVariable`) to access. I would change this: make all these variables private (prefix them by an underscore) and write getter methods.\nOne should call `C.number_of_variables()` to the number of variables used.\n\n*QAry/BinaryReedMullerCode*\n\n- You could add a method to compute the minimum distance, as we know a closed formula to compute it, it's quite a shame to call the exhaustive search algortihm if one types `My_rm_code.minimum_distance()`.\nIf `q` is 2, `D = 2^(m-d)`, otherwise it's `q^m - d*q^(m-1)`, with `m` the number of variables and `d` the order.\n''\nQAryReedMullerCode''\n\n- I would add a `WARNING::` block which states that the order has to be less than `q` to be sure users know about it. Of course, it will be removed later on, but the more informative the better.\n\n*Vectorial encoder*\n\n- I noticed you compute the generator matrix at construction time. I strongly disagree with this behaviour: as the generator matrix computation can be heavy, I advise you to only compute it when the needed (i.e. in the method `generator_matrix`). The method `generator_matrix` should also be cached (use the decorator `@cached_method`).\n\n- On the generator matrix computation. I think you should use iterators when possible. Especially, the lines\n\n```\nbaseFieldTuple=Tuples(baseField.list(),numberOfVariable)\n[...] for x in baseFieldTuple.list()\n```\n\n\nwill kill you. For example, over `GF(31)`, with only 4 variables, it takes more than 3 minutes to compute the list of all tuples on my laptop (16 GB RAM).\nUsing an iterator will not compute the full list of tuples, which saves time and memory for larger codes.\n\nSame for `exponents`: over GF(23), 4 variables and dimension 6, it takes circa 30 seconds to execute this on my laptop:\n\n```\nexponents=Subsets(range(numberOfVariable)*(q-1), submultiset=True)[0:code.dimension()]\n```\n\nBest,\n\nDavid",

<div id="comment:10" align="right">comment:10</div>

Disclaimer: the following remarks are only related to the code in itsef. I did not run (yet) extensive tests on border cases and larger cases than the ones covered by doctests.

General remark on exceptions: don't need to write "Incorrect data-type ..." every time, as `ValueError` will be printed on the screen and it means there is something wrong with the input.

Another remark on documentation: you have to add this module to `src/doc/en/reference/coding/index.rst` to make it appear in the online documentation. For now, this module is never considered when compiling documentation - which means, even if you run `sage --docbuild reference/coding`, you won't be able to know if there are some bugs in your doc.

*binomial_sum*

I think it might be better to make it a private method (which can be done by calling it _binomial_sum).

You could have used already implemented methods, ending up with something like:

`return sum(binomial(n, i) for i in range(k+1))` or `for i in range(k+1): s += binomial(n, i)`

BUT it's much slower than you implementation (up to a factor of 10 according to `timeit`). So, we should just keep what you did :)

*multivariate_polynomial_interpolation*

I'd make it a private method as it's only used internally as a helper.
I would also change the name `_R` to `polynomial_ring`. It's probably something
you copied from my poor naming choice in grs.py... I changed it in #20744 in the meanwhile ;)

I'd also rename some variables: `evaluation2` might be `multipoint_evaluation_list` or something like that. I would also change the name `nq`, but I don't have any idea here. I would also rename `finiteField` as `base_field` for consistency.
You should be careful with `0`s and `1`s: the `0` l. 87 is not the same as the one on line 89: the former is the zero of the base field while the latter is the zero of the multivariate polynomial ring where `poly` lives.
I recommend using specific variables for these zeroes/ones, which you can define as follows: `base_field_zero = base_field.zero()`.

*ReedMullerCode*

- you need to add `::` in the end of your second example's descriptive sentence.

*General remark on classes*

- Most of your class parameters are public variables that one has to call directly (e.g. `C.numberOfVariable`) to access. I would change this: make all these variables private (prefix them by an underscore) and write getter methods.
One should call `C.number_of_variables()` to the number of variables used.

*QAry/BinaryReedMullerCode*

- You could add a method to compute the minimum distance, as we know a closed formula to compute it, it's quite a shame to call the exhaustive search algortihm if one types `My_rm_code.minimum_distance()`.
If `q` is 2, `D = 2^(m-d)`, otherwise it's `q^m - d*q^(m-1)`, with `m` the number of variables and `d` the order.
''
QAryReedMullerCode''

- I would add a `WARNING::` block which states that the order has to be less than `q` to be sure users know about it. Of course, it will be removed later on, but the more informative the better.

*Vectorial encoder*

- I noticed you compute the generator matrix at construction time. I strongly disagree with this behaviour: as the generator matrix computation can be heavy, I advise you to only compute it when the needed (i.e. in the method `generator_matrix`). The method `generator_matrix` should also be cached (use the decorator `@cached_method`).

- On the generator matrix computation. I think you should use iterators when possible. Especially, the lines

```
baseFieldTuple=Tuples(baseField.list(),numberOfVariable)
[...] for x in baseFieldTuple.list()
```


will kill you. For example, over `GF(31)`, with only 4 variables, it takes more than 3 minutes to compute the list of all tuples on my laptop (16 GB RAM).
Using an iterator will not compute the full list of tuples, which saves time and memory for larger codes.

Same for `exponents`: over GF(23), 4 variables and dimension 6, it takes circa 30 seconds to execute this on my laptop:

```
exponents=Subsets(range(numberOfVariable)*(q-1), submultiset=True)[0:code.dimension()]
```

Best,

David

Thanks. I have started implementing some of the changes you have suggested.
Regarding formatting, is there any format code or something that i can plug in a ide interface and automatically implement them? It will be tedious to go through the code and manually do them.

Regarding private functions. I had not added examples for them because doctest would not be able to execute them since i had not listed them anywhere. Will writing them as _<private functions> solve that?

Not that I know, I'm afraid. I'm not using any IDE but vim, so I can't be sure though.
But if it's just to change `MyVariable` to `my_variable`, any text editor has a search and replace feature which will do the job. Of course, you will have to feed it with the target name everytime...

> Regarding private functions. I had not added examples for them because doctest would not be able to execute them since i had not listed them anywhere. Will writing them as _<private functions> solve that?

Actually, doctests will be executed. Making these methods private with `_name` will make them disappear from the online doc, but the doctesting framework will run them as well. See `_punctured_form` in `grs.py` for an example.

Hey, so correct me if i am wrong, [x for x in base_field_tuple] is implicitly implemented using iterator. If that's so i think the following implementation should get rid all the redundant iterations through the sets.

exponent=exponents.first()
for i in range(dimension):

  matrix_list.append([reduce(mul, [x[i] for i in exponent],1) for x in base_field_tuple])
  exponent=exponents.next(exponent)

Yes, absolutely.

I'm reading your modified code, I'll come back with more comments later on.

Hello,

Some more comments:

- I noticed you add both `ReedMullerCode`, `BinaryReedMullerCode` and `QAryReedMullerCode` to `codes_catalog.py`. But with our design, only `ReedMullerCode` should be in this file, as the user should never access the classes themselves.


## `_multivariate_polynomial_interpolation`

- You left a reference to `_R` in the docstring while it no longer exists
- Is the base field (and the cardinality) really needed? I would rather remove them from the list of inputs and recover them from `evaluation`. This way, one has to provide `evaluation` as a vector over a finite field, you get this finite field by doing `F = evaluation.base_ring()`, you check that `F` is the base ring of `polynomial_ring` and that's it. You can get `q` with the appropriate call on `F`.
- As my previous comment implies, I would only allow `evaluation` to be a vector (and not a list). After all, it's a private method you only use to recover the original message as a polynomial from a codeword, and the latter is necessarily a vector, isn't it? 
- l. 105: is there a way to avoid a call to `base_field.list()`? I know that in most cases, this list will be rather small, but it's not really efficient to build a full list (especially in a recursive pattern, because you will build it a lot of times...). This time again, I'd suggest an iterator over the finite field.

## `ReedMullerCode`

- the `WARNING` block should be added in the module documentation as well. The syntax on this block is the following 

 ```
 .. WARNING:: 
     body of the block
  ```
  See `linear_code.py`, line 682 for an example. 
  I would also change the message. I propose `For now, this implementation only supports Reed-Muller codes whose order is less than q`. Such a message implies it will be extended later, I think it's more positive this way ;)

## Q-ary and Binary classes

- I think it's not necessary to save `q` as a class parameter. The user can access it by typing `C.base_field().cardinality()`, it's not something specific to the class (or something hard to "compute"), so it should not be saved.

- I prefer full names for user-accessed methods. I'm okay with `num_var` as an internal variable, but its getter should be called `number_of_variables` instead.

## Vectorial encoder

- In `generator_matrix`, you're calling `self.code()` a lot of times. I think you should store it in a local variable which will reduce the amount of calls to this method.

Best,

David

Hi, 

So should we keep BinaryReedMullerCode in codes_catalog.py in keeping with the BinaryReedMullerCode() function from guava.py? Or should i just keep the guava.py implementation with a warning regarding it's depreciation?

Hello,

Some other remarks (the last ones from me):

- in the input sanitization, you test integer parameters using this statement: `if not isinstance(param, Integer)`. Actually, as in Sage you can have both Sage Integers and Python ints, you need to write `if not isinstance(param, (int, Integer))` otherwise if the user passes a Python int for `param` it will be rejected by the check.

- in your `minimum_distance` method for `QAryReedMullerCode`, you should use integer division `//` instead of `/`. I agree the result will always be an integer because of the parameters, but using `/` returns a Rational while `//` returns an Integer, and I think it's better to return an Integer.

- method `generator_matrix` does not work if order is 0:

```
sage: sage: F = GF(3)
sage: C = codes.ReedMullerCode(F, 0, 2)
sage: sage: E = codes.encoders.ReedMullerVectorEncoder(C)
sage: sage: E.generator_matrix()

BOOM (StopIteration)
```

In case of order 0, just return a matrix which has only one line of `1` (it is a repetition code in that case).

- Still on generator matrix, you're using `exponents.first()` and `exponents.next()`. Why not using a "true" iterator instead? As you take the elements in `Subsets` one by one following the order they've been sorted, an Iterator has a better complexity in that case, because `next(obj)`'s complexity is `O(r)` where `r` is the rank of `obj`.

- Also, `generator_matrix` method is quite slow: with a RM code over `GF(16)`, order 14, 3 variables, it takes around 30s to compute its generator matrix (while with a GRS code over GF(4096), dimension 680, it takes around 3 seconds). It's just a remark so we keep it in mind, and I do not request any changes for this ticket. I'm completely fine with your implementation as is for a first ticket, and we can work on efficiency later on if we want to!

- Same with `encode` in `PolynomialEncoder`: some algorithms for fast multipoint evaluation exist, and we can use them to speed up this encoding. But once again, your implementation is definitely good enough for a first ticket!

Otherwise, it sounds good. It's quite an impressive work for your first ticket, well done!
You will be the first one to have his implementation of an "advanced" linear code family in Sage. I'm jealous `;)`

the error with order 0 was because '.next()' function was not computing in the last element of the subsets (a problem if the dimension becomes equal to the total number of possible exponents) anyways replaced with iterator so that problem is gone.
I was under the impression that .next() works like iterator. Anyways i used the python's iterator hopefully it will speed it up.
Speed does seem to be a big issue with this implementation. I am unable to lay a finger on the exact problem causing that.

Hello,

I made some minor changes to the documentation:

- There was some syntax error which prevented it to compile properly, which I fixed
- I removed duplicated warning blocks
- I changed some line breaks
- I removed trailing whitespaces in the process
- I simplified a few methods' docstring.

I did not change the code at all, just made some changes to the doc because it was faster to do it myself `:)`.

If you agree with my changes, we can give this ticket a positive review!
Don't forget to write your full name in the `Authors` field in this ticket.

Best,

David

I know I'm late to the scene, but I have a few questions/comments:

1. Why are lines 249--255 in reed_muller_code.py formatted so badly? Similarly for line 70--75. This type of formatting is not PEP8, I believe.
2. The patch in `linear_code.py` adding `Integer` around `n-k` shouldn't be necessary: `n` is `C.length()` and `k` is `C.dimension()`. Both should *always* return `Integer`. You should find the example that led you to make this patch and instead fix the root cause that made either `n` or `k` rational. Incidentally, I think I know where the bug is: your `_binomial_sum` returns a rational since you have a division that you don't cast to `Integer`. Amusingly, that cast seems to speed up `_binomial_sum` by a factor 3 or so.
3. Could you please improve the docstring of `order()` with a second sentence explaining what the order is? The current docstring is the type of infuriatingly unhelpful docstrings that are way too common ;-)
4. Same for `number_of_variables` and `minimum_distance`. Yes, I am aware that there are code classes with similarly unhelpful docstrings, but let's try to improve Sage :-)
5. For `__repr__` etc., perhaps it be more consistent with Reed--Solomon codes to write something like "Reed-Muller of order X in Y variables over `self.base_field()`".

No problem with comments :) . Will work on them. Some doubts/explanation. 

1. Well i guess they are so because of the length of line restrictions and the automated formatter did everything 'strictly'. 249--255 is indeed ugly will change that. 70--75 seems fine though.

2. Oh. I guess i will remove the linear_code.py path and use '//' instead of '/' in binomial sum. Might be faster too because of integer divisions instead of rational numbers.

21. Isn't it sum upto 'k' that we need? 

22. Directly iterating involves enumeration over the subset redundantly if i am not mistaken. Used the iterator to do the generation in one scan.

24. So given the term prod!^m_{i=1} x!^(d_i)_i, exponent is the set {!{1}*d_1 {2}*d_2 ...{m}*d_m}. In which case i believe that the generator matrix is correct (it matches with polynomial evaluation).

Ah, yes now I see!

You should probably use `exponents = Subsets(..., k=order)`. Your current code
depends in a fragile, undocumented manner on the order that `Subsets` iterates
over its elements. When using `k=order` you get only subsets of size exactly
`k`, but you could get around this by adding a dummy element `order` times to
the list.

> Well everything else makes sense. Will implement them :)

Cool!

Regarding '17.' Is there any way one can pass a sub ring of a multivariate polynomial ring consisting of polynomials over a subset of the variables? Like F[x_1,x_2,x_3] is to F[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4]? The num_of_var parameter used in the function sort of does that.

You can write: `:class:<backquote>BinaryReedMullerCode<backquote>`, it will create an hyperlink to `BinaryReedMullerCode`.

If you want to refer a class in another file in coding, you can use: 
`:class:<backquote>sage.coding.file.ClassName<backquote>`

And to hyperlink a method, use `:meth:` instead of `:class:`.

If you don't want to check manually if the links work, you can
use the command `./sage --docbuild --warn-links reference/coding` which will rebuild the documentation and tell you if some links are broken.

            z = z * x
        return poly
    return _interpolate(evaluations, order, len(polynomial_ring.gens()))

Hello,

It seems that my comment did not appear - sorry about that.

I fixed some small doc issues, rewrote a few docstrings, and removed a duplicated `WARNING` block.

If you're fine with my changes, you can give a positive review, everything is fine on my side.

Once again, well done with these codes :)

David
