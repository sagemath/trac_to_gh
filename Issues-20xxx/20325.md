```
The backend methods `add_variables` and `add_linear_constraints` should have a default implementation in `GenericBackend`, like `add_linear_constraint_vector`.

`add_variables` can be taken from Gurobi and also removed from CVXOPT and InteractiveLP.
`add_linear_constraints` can be taken from COIN and also removed from CVXOPT and InteractiveLP.
(The other backends have specific implementations of these methods; one supposes that they are faster, though this probably has not been tested.)

Since the removal of the copy-pasted functions from the backends would remove doctests, I mark this ticket as dependent on #20323.

* * *

The new tests revealed a bug in the PPL backend, which has been fixed.
Also, the CPLEX backend used to add variables in reverse order for no good reason; changed that.
