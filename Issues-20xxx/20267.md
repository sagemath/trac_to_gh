We currently have:

```
sage: C = crystals.Letters(['C',4])
sage: C(2) < C('E')
False
sage: C('E') < C(2)
# Boom
```
This is because we do not have a `_richcmp_` for `EmptyLetter`. This prevents the digraph code from drawing crystals with the empty letter (specifically KR tableaux).

Thanks. Could you please post the code for KR crystals that currently fails? I drew a KR crystals of type C and it worked fine.
