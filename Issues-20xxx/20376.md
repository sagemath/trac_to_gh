This is a debugging tool. It logs calls to the methods of MIP backends.

There are three output formats:
- on-screen comments
- doctests, suitable for cut and paste
- `_test_*` methods for the backends (#20323). 

I have already used this code to translate the testcase using the `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` reported in #18572 to a testcase in the style of the `_test_*` methods for the backends. The result has been committed on #20424 .

`compute_something` is being typeset in the doc as a maths expression. I guess it needs `:func:` prefix.

As well, after EXAMPLES there is a long list

```
add_col(*args, **kwdargs)
add_linear_constraint(*args, **kwdargs)
...
write_mps(*args, **kwdargs)
```
Is it how it is meant to look?

You can place `.. auto***` directives in the docstrings of classes; although I don't exactly know how to achieve what we want. See the doc here:
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autodoc.html#confval-autoclass_content

and there are examples in src/sage/ doing something like this: `grep -R "\.\. auto" *` will show a lot...


> I also don't know how to remove the strange stuff at the very bottom of that page. 

no idea either...
