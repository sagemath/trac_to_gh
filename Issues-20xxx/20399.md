For some reason, PARI internally has lists, row vectors, column vectors, and matrices all as separate types. This patch amounts to treating PARI row and column vectors like lists, but I think that's reasonable for a user-level conversion.

Anyway, patchbot is happy, and so am I. Positive review.

Thanks for the review!

Note that in Sage there is no distinction between row and column vectors 

```
sage: v = vector((1,2))
sage: m = matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: m*v
(5, 11)
sage: v*m
(7, 10)
```
