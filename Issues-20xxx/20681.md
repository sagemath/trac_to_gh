Recall that the Sage categories provide implementations for Python's
special methods for the basic arithmetic operations (e.g. `__mul__`,
`__add__`), that dispatch to the coercion model or call Sage's special
methods (e.g. `_mul_`, `_add_`) for the internal
operations. Furthermore, the default implementation for `_mul_` is to
delegate the work to the `product` method of the parent.

Before this ticket, those indirections induced an overhead of roughly
100ns for `*`, 480ns for `__mul__` and 340ns for `_mul_`:

```
    sage: S = Semigroups().example()
    sage: x = S.an_element()
    sage: x*x
    42
    sage: sage: %timeit [x*x for i in range(1000)]
    1000 loops, best of 3: 1.21 ms per loop
    sage: sage: %timeit [x.__mul__(x) for i in range(1000)]
    1000 loops, best of 3: 1.12 ms per loop
    sage: sage: %timeit [x._mul_(x) for i in range(1000)]
    1000 loops, best of 3: 643 µs per loop
    sage: %timeit [S.product(x,x) for i in range(1000)]
    1000 loops, best of 3: 300 µs per loop
```

After this ticket, which Cythonize those methods, the overhead is
reduced to roughly 20ns for `*`, 100ns for `__mul__` and 160ms for
`_mul_`, which is a speedup by a factor of 3 on the accumulated
overhead, and an overall speedup by a factor of 2 for this particular
parent:

```
    sage: %timeit [x*x for i in range(1000)]
    1000 loops, best of 3: 596 µs per loop
    sage: %timeit [x.__mul__(x) for i in range(1000)]
    1000 loops, best of 3: 572 µs per loop
    sage: %timeit [x._mul_(x) for i in range(1000)]
    1000 loops, best of 3: 467 µs per loop
    sage: %timeit [S.product(x,x) for i in range(1000)]
    1000 loops, best of 3: 300 µs per loop
```

=Notes=

The average timings vary by about 5-10% from one run to the other.

In this parent, the product is trivial, and implemented as a plain
Python `product` method in the parent. For a parent with a non trivial
Python product, the overhead of the indirections is now of 20%, which
is getting closer to acceptable::

```
    sage: S = Semigroups().Finite().example()
    sage: x = S.an_element()
    sage: %timeit [S.product(x,x) for i in range(1000)]
    100 loops, best of 3: 4.39 ms per loop
    sage: %timeit [x*x for i in range(1000)]
    100 loops, best of 3: 5.28 ms per loop
```

For comparison, here is the cost of the product of two (Sage)
integers::

```
    sage: x = 3
    sage: %timeit [x*x for i in range(1000)]
    1000 loops, best of 3: 162 µs per loop
    sage: x = int(3)
    sage: %timeit [x*x for i in range(1000)]
    10000 loops, best of 3: 63.9 µs per loop
```

So the 120ns overhead when using coercion methods `__mul__` provided
by categories (rather than from a Cython super class) is of the same
order of magnitude as the cost of a trivial multiplication.

+Notes
+##### The average timings vary by about 5-10% from one run to the other.
+
+In this parent, the product is trivial, and implemented as a plain
+Python `product` method in the parent. For a parent with a non trivial
+Python product, the overhead of the indirections is now of 20%, which
+is getting closer to acceptable::
+
+```
+    sage: S = Semigroups().Finite().example()
+    sage: x = S.an_element()
+    sage: %timeit [S.product(x,x) for i in range(1000)]
+    100 loops, best of 3: 4.39 ms per loop
+    sage: %timeit [x*x for i in range(1000)]
+    100 loops, best of 3: 5.28 ms per loop
+```
+
+For comparison, here is the cost of the product of two (Sage)
+integers::
+
+```
+    sage: x = 3
+    sage: %timeit [x*x for i in range(1000)]
+    1000 loops, best of 3: 162 µs per loop
+    sage: x = int(3)
+    sage: %timeit [x*x for i in range(1000)]
+    10000 loops, best of 3: 63.9 µs per loop
+```
+
+So the 120ns overhead when using coercion methods `__mul__` provided
+by categories (rather than from a Cython super class) is of the same
+order of magnitude as the cost of a trivial multiplication.
+

(for the record: I just moved that comment which was already there).

Yes, I pondered about that, since we had this parallel discussion
about moving all the coercion methods up to Element. If we do the
move, we should do it for all coercion methods at once. However, given
that this moving is a non trivial API change and still under
discussion, I prefer to postpone it to a later ticket.
