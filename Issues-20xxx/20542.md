Well, the ATLAS options are documented in http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#environment-variables

I agree that it's not very clear, but I was hoping that this ticket could be reviewed anyway with further work for a follow-up ticket.

Ideally we should move some of the configuration logic of the ATLAS spkg either to a generic BLAS meta-package or the top-level `configure` script. I haven't completely thought out the details of this, but I don't see much point in documenting something which I plan to change soon anyway.

`./configure` ?

`./configure` is not mentioned in the official manual.
cf http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#step-by-step-installation-procedure

or your locally built manual for the latest 7.5.beta
