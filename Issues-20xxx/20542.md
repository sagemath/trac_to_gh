The mechanics looks alright but I want to have a few hours to digest it. Since we are not changing the current spkg, things are not as informative as they could be. How do you know from `configure --help` that
 1) --with-blas=atlas (or nothing) allows you to use a system ATLAS via an environment variable.
 2) that the same option will give use the accelerate framework on OS X by default (there is a way to force ATLAS build but that's a real expert case).

The first one may qualify as an expert use case where we don't want to make the suggestion in configuration's help message. I think the second one should deserve a mention, one way or another.

Well, the ATLAS options are documented in http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#environment-variables

I agree that it's not very clear, but I was hoping that this ticket could be reviewed anyway with further work for a follow-up ticket.

Ideally we should move some of the configuration logic of the ATLAS spkg either to a generic BLAS meta-package or the top-level `configure` script. I haven't completely thought out the details of this, but I don't see much point in documenting something which I plan to change soon anyway.

> Ideally we should move some of the configuration logic of the ATLAS spkg either to a generic BLAS meta-package or the top-level configure script.

This is partly why I suggested the former, earlier.  But I agree further work could be in a follow-up.  This is a good move in the right direction.

`./configure` ?

`./configure` is not mentioned in the official manual.
cf http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#step-by-step-installation-procedure

or your locally built manual for the latest 7.5.beta
