 2) that the same option will give use the accelerate framework on OS X by default (there is a way to force ATLAS build but that's a real expert case).

The first one may qualify as an expert use case where we don't want to make the suggestion in configuration's help message. I think the second one should deserve a mention, one way or another.

Well, the ATLAS options are documented in http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#environment-variables

I agree that it's not very clear, but I was hoping that this ticket could be reviewed anyway with further work for a follow-up ticket.

Ideally we should move some of the configuration logic of the ATLAS spkg either to a generic BLAS meta-package or the top-level `configure` script. I haven't completely thought out the details of this, but I don't see much point in documenting something which I plan to change soon anyway.

With all respect, this ticket should have been changing that docs, too. Do you expect that people would read configure source just to figure out how to switch between Atlas and OpenBlas? E.g., how does one build with Atlas?!

Besides, `with-blas` is misleading. Surely, in both bases [BLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms) is used, just different ones...

No, but I would expect them to read `./configure --help`.  If the help docs are broken then yeah I agree.

`./configure` ?

`./configure` is not mentioned in the official manual.
cf http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#step-by-step-installation-procedure

or your locally built manual for the latest 7.5.beta
