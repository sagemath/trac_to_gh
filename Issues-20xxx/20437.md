I've encountered yet another problem in my quest to get sage building on Cygwin.  I'm surprised this hasn't come up before though which makes me wonder if I'm doing something wrong.

The DLL loader library, libpython2.7.dll.a, gets installed to `$(SAGE_LOCAL)/lib/python2.7/config/` which is not normally on the ld search path (similar on Python 3 I think).

This means that when building extension modules `-lpython2.7` is actually linking against my system Python (in this case the Python that came with cygwin--also Python 2.7.10).  This is of course wrong, but isn't a problem for the majority of modules, including sage itself (at least it wasn't a problem for compiling).  It was actually PIL(low) where this fell apart because it used some `PyUnicode_` functions that were not found in my system libpython because it was compiled with `--enable-unicode=ucs2`, whereas Sage builds Python with `--enable-unicode=ucs4`.

When installing Python, Sage should be making a symlink to `$(SAGE_LOCAL)/lib/python2.7/config/libpython2.7.dll.a` in `$(SAGE_LOCAL)/lib`.

I'm leaning toward calling this an upstream bug--I don't understand why this isn't done automatically by Python's Makefile.  The relevant portion begins [here](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/v2.7.10/Makefile.pre.in#l916).  It seems that if a DLL is built it *does not* install a symlink to the loader library in lib/.  I've brought this up here: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2016-April/144315.html

For reference, Cygwin's own system package for Python installs this symlink manually...  It seems odd not to do it by default.

only sided notes (as I am not a Cygwin guy):

- in the ticket, you should always fill the "Authors" field (with your full name). The reason is that patchbots completely ignore tickets where it is not set.

- in a commit it is standard to have one short line description, a linebreak and then an optional description. That way the history is much more readable (e.g. with `git log --oneline`).
