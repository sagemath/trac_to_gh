PPL's solver is a rational *MIP* solver. 
Its support for integer variables should be exposed in Sage.

Reference: http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/documentation/user/ppl-user-1.2-html/classParma__Polyhedra__Library_1_1MIP__Problem.html

For `sage.libs.ppl.MIP_Problem`, I think one just needs to add a wrapper for this method:

```
void Parma_Polyhedra_Library::MIP_Problem::add_to_integer_space_dimensions(const Variables_Set &i_vars)	
```
and then a wrapper class for [`Variables_Set`](http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/documentation/user/ppl-user-1.2-html/classParma__Polyhedra__Library_1_1Variables__Set.html).

On another ticket (#20354), `PPLBackend` will be updated accordingly.

This is already documented in the class docstring of `Variable`. (It's 0-based.)

> Can one use this to generate integer hull of a polytope defined by inequalities (perhaps after adjusting the corresponding Polyhedron code)?
> Or is this optimisation-only thing?


No, PPL does not have code for computing integer hulls. 
The closest that there is in the polyhedron code is the following interesting function:

```
void Parma_Polyhedra_Library::Polyhedron::drop_some_non_integer_points(Complexity_Class complexity = ANY_COMPLEXITY)	
Possibly tightens *this by dropping some points with non-integer coordinates.
```

I would be quite interested in having code in Sage that computes a polyhedron given only by a linear optimization oracle [for example, implemented by a MIP solver], see for example http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3987.pdf. But this has nothing to do with this ticket.

Alternatively, you can use try/finally which will also catch exceptions raised by subroutines inside the try:

def try_finally_example():
    sig_on()
    try:
        # (some long computation, potentially raising exceptions)
    finally:
        sig_off()
    return something
