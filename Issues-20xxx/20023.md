* Apparently sage-bootstrap-python using python 2.6 is broken already - https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/GniJKQ0MaMY/m/DugFUprJAwAJ
* Platforms such as RHEL 6 and Centos 6 reached their EOL at the end of 2020; and Docker-based testing of `centos-6` no longer works

In this ticket, we 

* delete `sage_bootstrap/compat/argparse.py`
* Change ​http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#checksums and any other related documentation (last modified in #31192)

This is on top of #31419 so that we have to change `README` only once.

I changed the directory to `SAGE_ROOT/build/sage_bootstrap` and checked out contents :
