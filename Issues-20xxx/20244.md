Currently it creates a quotient of a polynomial ring over the p-adics. It should call `extension()` to create a proper extension instead.

```
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3)[]
sage: (x^3+3).root_field('a')
Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in a over 3-adic Field with capped relative precision 20 with modulus (1 + O(3^20))*x^3 + (3 + O(3^21))
```

Also the documentation is somewhat confusing. It should be made clear that this is not the same as `splitting_field()`.

Depends on #20254
