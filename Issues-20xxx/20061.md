Keywords: perfect matching, graph

Add a method for finding all perfect matchings to `Graph` using the following algorithm:
Choose a vertex v, then recurse through all edges incident to v, removing one edge at a time whenever an edge is added to a matching.

Hello,

Some remarks:

- You will notice that all methods in graph.py are decorated with `doc_index`, which makes them appear in the index of functions of that file. As it is missing in your branch, I expect that your function appears in the 'uncategorized' section of this table.

- The function will appear in this index of function, and the style of its description is a bit at odds with others: we usually have something like 'returns an interator over the perfect matchings of the graph'. Note that in the context of this table, 'self' does not appear anywhere.

- In order to test whether a graph is empty, you can do `if G`. What you do is build the list of vertices and throw it away at every call of the function, uselessly.

- You build the list a second time to pick `v`, to throw everything away except its first element. You would achieve the same with `v = next(self.vertex_iterator())`.

Hello again,

- You chose 'basic methods' for your new method but counting matchings is not basic at all. The `.matching` method, in particular, is in the 'leftovers' section.

- You can write a check of your method using the `matching_polynomial` methods which counts the number of matchings. It will also give you the number of perfect matchings.

- Your method probably fails on a graph like `graphs.PetersenGraph().copy(immutable=True)`.

- I discussed with Travis the advantages of checking (with `.matching()`) that the graph actually contains a perfect matching before recursing. Is there a reason why you decided against it ?

- If you want to, you can optionally add SEEALSO sections to/from the other matching-related methods:
  http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings

- Please set your ticket to `needs_review` when you are done with your changes and want somebody to look at your code.

`copy(a_graph)` does what you want, though it is less explicit. Volker insisted that `copy(something)` should always be mutable, while I insisted that `copy(a_graph)` should not take 3Gig in memory if `a_graph` only takes 100Mo.

"Depends on the graphs", but truth is that I don't know. Give it a try, see how bad it is, and if you really don't know this can become another optional test. Well, do the smart/responsible thing, as always.

Hello again,

Several comments:

- You *can* (if you prefer) exchange a '\' character at the end of the line against parentheses, e.g.

```
sage: (1+
....: 1)
2
```

- Instead of `if labels` you can simplify your code by doing this:

```diff
-for e in self.edges_incident(v):
+for e in self.edges_incident(v,labels=labels):
```

- Did you reach a decision about the subcall to `.matching()`?

The `.matching()` function returns a largest matching, not necessarily perfect matching. Just test the size of the matching it returns.

Unfortunately, I decided to stop contributing to Sage a couple of hours ago. I wish you good luck.
