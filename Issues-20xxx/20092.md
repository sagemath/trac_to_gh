In the method Graph.matching(), the doc says:

```
- ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)
```
But in fact `use_edge_labels` is set to `True` by default. This ticket changes the default behavior to `False` to match the documentation.

We also fix a bug with Edmonds algorithm always using edge labels:

```
sage: gw = Graph([(0,1,1),(1,2,99),(2,3,1)])
sage: gw.matching(use_edge_labels=False)
[(1, 2, 99)]
```

Can you explain what the bug was (including the code which resulted in the bug)? Also could you explain this change to me? I don't see the point in creating a new graph and if this is necessary, why don't you cal `copy`?

```diff
-                g = self.networkx_graph(copy=False)
+                g = Graph(self.edges(labels=False))
+                g = g.networkx_graph(copy=False)
```
Also I don't think this change is good

```diff
-                    return Integer(len(d)/2)
+                    return len(d)/2
```
as now the output is not guaranteed to be a Sage integer. We try to make sure python `int`s don't escape to the user.

This is the bug: currently the method takes into account the weights of the edges, if `use_edge_labels=False`:

```
sage: g=Graph([(0,1),(1,2),(2,3)])
sage: g.matching()
[(0, 1, None), (2, 3, None)]

sage: gw=Graph([(0,1,1),(1,2,99),(2,3,1)])
sage: gw.matching(use_edge_labels=False)
[(1, 2, 99)]
```
