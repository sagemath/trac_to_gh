In the method Graph.matching(), the doc says:

```
- ``use_edge_labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``)
```
But in fact `use_edge_labels` is set to `True` by default. This ticket changes the default behavior to `False` to match the documentation.

We also fix a bug with Edmonds algorithm always using edge labels:

```
sage: gw = Graph([(0,1,1),(1,2,99),(2,3,1)])
sage: gw.matching(use_edge_labels=False)
[(1, 2, 99)]
```

To me, having it fixed in any way is good for as long as it is fixed. I would personally enforce in the code what the doc says, for I expect graph functions to not try to understand the labels unless I explicitly want it to.

Though that's only me.

Can you explain what the bug was (including the code which resulted in the bug)? Also could you explain this change to me? I don't see the point in creating a new graph and if this is necessary, why don't you cal `copy`?

```diff
-                g = self.networkx_graph(copy=False)
+                g = Graph(self.edges(labels=False))
+                g = g.networkx_graph(copy=False)
```
Also I don't think this change is good

```diff
-                    return Integer(len(d)/2)
+                    return len(d)/2
```
as now the output is not guaranteed to be a Sage integer. We try to make sure python `int`s don't escape to the user.

This is the bug: currently the method takes into account the weights of the edges, if `use_edge_labels=False`:

```
sage: g=Graph([(0,1),(1,2),(2,3)])
sage: g.matching()
[(0, 1, None), (2, 3, None)]

sage: gw=Graph([(0,1,1),(1,2,99),(2,3,1)])
sage: gw.matching(use_edge_labels=False)
[(1, 2, 99)]
```
