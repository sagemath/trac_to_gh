Yeah, the update is non trivial, that's a reason to get #17184 (and so #16882) inbetween.

I wonder if we even have a Sage developer who is familiar enough with Singular to do this (for the record: not me, I know nothing about Singular).

Of course, I'm not arguing with that.

Maybe Burcin would do...
IIRC the update was proposed as a GSoC project.

Q: where to get the singular tarball for this commit? 
I get a failure at 

{{{ 
Trying to download http://www.sagemath.org/packages/upstream/singular/singular-4.0.1p1.tar.bz2
}}}

Could the update to 4.0.1. be done by at least two or three persons to spread the knownledge
about Singular internals?

You have to put a tarball repackaged by the `spkg-src` script in the `upstream` folder directly.
Once the ticket is merged, the tarball will be put on the official mirror and could be downloaded automatically but not at the moment.

I've put a repackaged tarball at:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/upstream/singular-4.0.1.tar.bz2

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-11-03 12:35:18

(I'm not sure the checksums will the same as what Jeroen branch expect, run `./sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums` after you have downloaded the tarball to fix this.)


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-11-03 12:36:03

And I'd be happy to work on the upgrade and learn more about Singular's internals, but please also review the "easy" #17184 (where I've already learnt some stuff) firsT.

Singular 4.0.1. compiles now in sage but sage does not yet -
I just pushed a branch 'u/jakobkroeker/ticket/17254'.
You have to correct the 'singular-4.0.1p1.tar.bz2' tarball to get it work ( the 'm4' folder is missing). 

For the moment I removed some patches; we probably will have to adjust them later on. For example there is meanwhile no such thing like 'lomalloc_ndebug' so if we want to disable some debug functionality or output for omalloc we have to do that by passing appropriate flags to omalloc/configure, e,g
'--enable-optimizationflags --disable-debug --without-debug' ?

Also I disabled the currently broken
'--enable-debugoutput' configure flag for the standalone 'factory'
and informed Oleksander Motsak about the issue.

Could someone of you take care of the sage compile errors and figure out what is going wrong and/or ask for help in the Singular forum? I can't do that easily, because within the Singular-team I'm out-of-favor because I constantly  criticise their software and thus I will likely get little or no support.

first hint: for example the interface of 'naIsZero'
seems changed from 

```
BOOLEAN naIsZero(number a)
```

to 

```
BOOLEAN naIsZero(number a, const coeffs cf)
```

That's an older version than the one that I put in the ticket description, any reason...?

My tarball compiled fine, so what is the problem?

You should never run `./autogen.sh`, that is supposed to be run at packaging-time, not build-time.

Confirm; cannot reproduce the issue.
So likely I didn't use the recent tarball, or I screwed something up.

I'm guilty ;-)

Comment by jakobkroeker created at 2015-02-02 12:06:43

After a little more tweaking and temporarily disabling the extension fields/rings, 
I was able to build some parts of sage with Singular 4.0.1  on a 'fc18 system' and
then.. sage crashes at start! That happens because I didn't update ring creation right - I only  recently discovered examples at './libpolys/tests/rings_test.h'.  And some sage packages create common rings at loading time.

remaining riddles:
- during build one sage file tried to link to -lsingular (I have no idea why), instead to the   libSingular* files (that changed!), so I worked around by manually creating links to libSingular* files.

- on a ScientificLinux system I get errors like "ImportError: /home/kroeker/Projects/sage-singular-4.0.1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.so: undefined symbol: wFunctionalBuch". This symbol is in libSingular*

- fix ring creation. See examples at './libpolys/tests/rings_test.h'

- the extension fields will need some more love. See 'algext.h' and 'transext.h'. `@`Martin: could you take a look?

- some mapping functions (e.g. nr2mMapZp) now require a source and dst (coefficient) parameter. Not sure if I did it right (source: currentRing, dest: _ring or vice versa?)

- I didn't fix unused interface definitions in singular-cdefs.pxi. TODO
 
See branch u/jakobkroeker/ticket/17254
and some notes at https://github.com/jakobkroeker/jk_test_sage/issues/13

If a build get stuck before errors described above, then maybe a 'make distclean' is necessary.
And of course, the Singular tarball http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/singular-4.0.1p1.tar.bz2 is required.


Any help appreciated.

I'm busy and can't work on the ticket currently and expect to have time for the ticket at end of June,
not earlier...

with the state as is, sage should build and start (using the Singular tarball from above), but extension fields and transcendental fields are not functional yet and also a cython Singular-interface cleanup has to be done.

I'm at SD64.25 and am willing to work on this, but I'll need some hand-holding since I haven't worked on a package like this before. Do you have any suggestions for ways to test extension and transcendental fields?

I just applied this to 6.4.1 and encountered the message,

    fatal error: Singular/libsingular.h: No such file or directory

while compiling

    build/cythonized/sage/algebras/letterplace/free_algebra_element_letterplace.cpp

Any ideas what causes this?

I haven't looked yet at the new singular 4.0.x but the first port of call would be to check if the header is indeed installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL/include`.

Shortly after, that installation of Sage fell completely apart (not sure why) so now I'm working on Sage-6.7.

On 6.7, git identifies some issues with merging in singular.pyx and ring.pyx, but they're fairly clear to fix, so I did. (Unless they _weren't_ easy.) Things went much further this time, until I encountered this error:


```
****************************************************

```

Here's what the file in question suggests:

```

Indeed, I do not find `run.c` in `local/var/tmp/sage/build/singular-4.0.1p1.p0/src/latest/Singular/`, which I am guessing is where this is supposed to be; instead, I find only run.h.

In my local distribution of Singular, I find a `run.c`. If I copy it over & try to make, I get the same complaint, & it looks as if the file is actually deleted. Suggestions?

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-05-24 22:56:13

Did you mean `local/var/tmp/sage/build/singular-4.0.1p1.p0/src/Singular/` the `latest` bit should be stripped by the `-p1` option to patch.


---

Comment by john_perry created at 2015-05-24 23:20:12

The patch has `latest` in it; that's why I wrote that in there, so that is what I mean. Is your meaning that `latest` should not be there? That directory doesn't exist when I look through the paths.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-05-24 23:30:05

It is expected for that directory not to exist for you. Whoever wrote the patch was working in a folder named `latest` but it is their own naming. It doesn't matter anyway. Let me explain to you how the `-p` option of patch works. 

Your patch has a header that helps you locate the file to patch:

```
--- latest/Singular/run.c       2014-11-19 14:06:05.000000000 +0100
+++ latest/Singular/run.c       2015-01-16 09:32:45.771298300 +0100
```

`patch < mypatch.patch` or equivalently `patch -p0< mypatch.patch` will look for the file
`latest/Singular/run.c` relative to where patch is executed. `-pN` will strip the `N` first folders in front of the file name so 

`patch -p1< mypatch.patch` will look for `Singular/run.c`. In `spkg-install` for singular, patches are applied with `patch -p1 <"$patch"` so you shouldn't care about `latest` it is discarded. Look for `local/var/tmp/sage/build/singular-4.0.1p1.p0/src/Singular/run.c` OK?


---

Comment by john_perry created at 2015-05-24 23:37:51

I think you misunderstand.

Replying to [comment:39 fbissey]:
> It is expected for that directory not to exist for you.

Why not? That directory _does_ exist for me. The problem is that the _file_ `run.c` does not exist _in_ it.

>Look for `local/var/tmp/sage/build/singular-4.0.1p1.p0/src/Singular/run.c` OK?

There is no such directory. I can get to `local/var/tmp/sage/build/singular-4.0.1p1.p0/src/` but the only directories in there are `latest` and `shared`.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-05-24 23:43:13

OK you seem to be right. The tarball has been packaged strangely and I am not sure I have the right `spkg-install`. It is a cygwin patch and cygwin support in singular seems to have changed considerably. I would just remove the patch for now, it doesn't/cannot apply anywway any new fix for cygwin would have to be done from scratch by someone with a cygwin system.


---

Comment by john_perry created at 2015-05-24 23:49:02

How do I remove it? If I move it & `make` anew, the file reappears.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-05-24 23:52:11

`git rm build/pkgs/singular/patches/stricmp.patch`?


---

Comment by john_perry created at 2015-05-25 00:55:55

Thanks, that worked. Now I get failure on a line in ring.pyx,

```
    if is_64_bit:
```

Namely, Cython (?) claims this is undefined. I guess this is a change in Cython, since that isn't introduced by this patch. I found online another way to test this (`sys.maxsize > 2**32`) so I'm trying with that. Found another issue, but that was easy. Proceeding with fingers crossed... it's still compiling, which is already an progress...!

It seems to have built, but Sage doesn't run. Here's the last few lines of the compilation (sorry for so much, but I wanted to show what it was saying at the end of what looks like a successful build, too):

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-05-25 02:19:59

It appears that it should be generated by `initCanonicalForm` but no functions of that name is to be found in the source code I have for singular 4.0.2 here and I am expecting it to be the same for you. I think you may have old singular headers on your system that are interfering (`factory.h`) we'll have to develop a proper upgrade procedure to remove singular 3.1.x stuff before installing 4.x. That or the singular 4.x headers have not been installed properly. `local/include/factory/factory/factory.h` and `local/include/factory/factory.h` both have this function in singular 3.1.7 but it shouldn't be present in the equivalent headers from singular 4.x.


---

Comment by john_perry created at 2015-05-25 05:08:50

I don't seem to have a `local/include/factory` at all...


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-05-25 06:41:17

I really have to inspect the spkg. I think I went overboard with the `factory` in the path. Should have been `local/include/factory.h` and `local/include/factory/factory.h`. Do you have a `factory.h` and does it contains `initCanonicalForm`?


---

Comment by john_perry created at 2015-05-25 15:55:09

`make distclean` then `make` seems to have fixed my problems. I am apparently running Singular 4, albeit with the changes I mentioned earlier. At startup, I see the following:

```
ring with rational coefficient field created
_ring.ShortOut 1
_ring.N 2
polynomial ring over integers created
_ring.ShortOut 1
_ring.N 2
ring with rational coefficient field created
_ring.ShortOut 1
_ring.N 2
```

I found that in the source code, so I'm guessing this was put in to test.

For what it's worth, lots of other things work.: I can, for instance, compute an ideal's GrÃ¶bner basis, its Hilbert [numerator, series, polynomial], and so forth.

Comment by john_perry created at 2015-05-25 17:00:56

Indeed, there is no Singular binary in local/bin. I presume this is the problem, though I have no idea what became of it.


---

Comment by john_perry created at 2015-05-25 17:54:25

I'm guessing that failure to install the singular binary is because of a symlink: `local/bin/singular' points to `local/bin/Singular` and removing the old (3.x) `Singular` wasn't enough to allow the new one in. I removed `local/bin/singular` and it's now working.

This may be an issue with Apple's file system, because after installing the new `Singular` I wasn't allowed to create the symlink.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-05-25 18:25:19

`is_64_bit` is deprecated. In Cython, check `sizeof(the_type_that_you_care_about)` instead.

Do not use `sys.maxsize`, that's much slower.

Yes you may have seen another ticket in which I demonstrated that something like `Singular` was really `singular`. OS X file system is not case sensitive but it gives the impression of being one.

It's now certain that this, too, was caused by the failure to install `Singular` because `singular` exists in the directory (what can I say, it's a Mac). Removing that link and reinstalling the spkg fixed all these problems. 

*Meanwhile*, I discovered some memory-related bugs in the patch. For instance, ring.pyx has the line

```
assert( exponent == base_ring.degree() )
```

which causes a failure. I'm not sure why those should be equal (the test I used had `Zmod(2^3)` where `exponent==3` and `base_ring.degree()==1`), but commenting it out leads to a failure on these lines:

```
_param.GFChar     = ch;
_param.GFDegree   = base_ring.degree();
_param.GFPar_name = omStrDup(base_ring.gen());   
```

because `_param` has not been initialized. Adding

```
_param = <GFInfo *>omAlloc(sizeof(GFInfo));
```

*before* the access gives me a ring. However,

    1. I'm not sure whether `omAlloc` or one of the other `omAlloc*` commands is more appropriate (e.g., `omAlloc0`). Anyone know?
    1. I suppose this has to be freed somewhere... I know there's an obvious-sounding place, so I'll find it.

There are other places this change has to occur. One more question:

    * A few lines before the ones I cited above is the test for 64-bits. I've switched to jdemeyer's test (`sizeof(long)>4`). However, the code in the patch is exactly the same for both 32- and 64-bit. Is there a recommendation for what to do here? I'm not sufficiently familiar with this to know what to do.

To wit, the source code for `base_ring.degree()` is, in total,

```
    def degree(self):
        """
        Return 1.

        EXAMPLE::

            sage: R = Integers(12345678900)
            sage: R.degree()
            1
        """
        return integer.Integer(1)
```

I don't know what is meant by the degree of a ring here, so I'll need guidance. For now I've commented it out.

Comment by john_perry created at 2015-05-25 23:53:12

Pushed code should build on 6.7. Mac users may have problems; if so, delete `local/bin/singular` and then `sage-spkg singular`; it should work after that. (In fact, I have to do it again myself now.) I have to run to the train (leaving SD) or I'd do it before leaving.

Forgot to remove that bad patch; that will come in a subsequent push. Still have the problem with `local/bin/Singular` because of the local symlink; it's a problem with the package itself, because I deleted both symlink and local copy before running the install. I don't know how to fix that, so advice would be appreciated.

Look at the diff for the old corresponding code: this doesn't have the branch.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-05-26 06:00:05

I would also recommend you to keep the logic of the old code where applicable. For example, the old code started with

```
if ch.is_power_of(2):
exponent = ch.nbits() -1
    # it seems Singular uses ints somewhere
    # internally, cf. #6051 (Sage) and #138 (Singular)
    if exponent <= 30:
```

and I see no reason to change this.

except for the issue with `src/sage/libs/singular/singular-cdefs.pxi`, how did you do the rebase? 
Did you a rebase by hand, or did you create a patch after merge and then apply the patch to 6.9.b0?

while the basic data structure idea is sketched in

I'm willing to collaborate on it, but I've had a more pressing project which has consumed my attention/free time. I thought I'd be done with it months ago :-) so I can't promise to be very helpful and/or focus on this at the moment, but I do hope to be available from time to time, until the current project passes in which case I could focus on this a little bit.

while upgrading to Singular 4 I'm currently hit a segfault in Singular for 

```
sage: x = var('x')
sage: K.<z> = QQ.extension(x^2 + 1)
sage: P.<v,w> = K[]
sage: P._singular_()

Since I neither familiar enough with the sage interface to Singular nor 
with Singular internals, I'm currently stuck. Could you take a look?

Yes. These are clearly artifacts from singular 3.1.7.
In Singular 4  is no 'initCanonicalForm'. 

Either this is a caching issue, incorrect dependency issue(in sage/cython)
or somewhere are files from 3.1.7 left. 
On which OS do you build singular( See also comment 55 )?
Did you try 'make distclean'? ( If you have a better solution for this, please share it)

Do you know in detail what happens or should happen in sage for 


```
sage: P.<v,w> = K[]
sage: P(1)

behind the scenes? 
With that information we could ask Singular's developers if we use `libSingular` correctly.

It'll construct a ring for the extension and then a ring in in v, w. I'll try to investigate further what's going wrong there (sorry, I'm being slow on this)

Indeed. With printouts I tracked down the issue to ring creation in 
`src/sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx`
I guess that I incorrectly assembly the minpoly in ring construction
(omalloc magic or whatever)
Or there is an issue with the `AlgExtInfo` declaration or in `nInitChar()` call.

Could you take a look or even fix it?
See the corresponding Singular example `test_Q_Ext_a()` in 
`latest/libpolys/tests/polys_test.h`

Comment by jpflori created at 2015-10-08 16:22:02

I looked a little bit into the problem and from what I see when the multivariate gets created the first thing done is to create the number field in Singular.
Just after the number field creation, the first memory error Singular complains about is related to the polynomial defining the number field, so I would say the number field creation already went wrong (or the number field is wrongly used once created).

> I still get a bunch of crashes/errors when testing sage/libs/singular, working on it.

I was able to fix the issue with `naSetMap()` and `nlInit2gmp()` usage in `sa2si_NF()`)
and this reduces the number of segfaults significantly
The example 

```
sage: x = var('x')
sage: K.<z> = QQ.extension(x^2 + 1)
sage: P.<v,w> = K[]
sage: P._singular_() 
sage: P(2/3) 
```

does not crash any more!

A remaining task is to reuse the plain polynomial ring `qqr = QQ['x']` over Q in 
`sa2si_NF()` instead of rebuilding it everytime. (variable name is irrelevant)


.
.
Next interesting riddle in `sa2si_ZZmod()`; simple failing example:

```
sage: sage: R.<a> = Zmod(5)['a', 'b']  
sage: R(1) #crash
```

The segfault is due to a division by zero (happening in gmp which aborts I guess):

```
#0  0x00003fffadbeaf28 in __gmpz_mod (rem=0x3fffa03ce230,
    dividend=0x3fffa03ce220, divisor=0x0) at mod.c:29

#2  0x00003fffa0d1561c in nrnMapZ (from=0x3fffa03ce220, src=0x3fffa03bc680,

    __pyx_v_d=0x3fff986212e0, __pyx_v__ring=0x3fffa03d43a8)
```


I guess the ring is wrongly initialized.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2015-11-10 22:59:16

Note that the same thing works when `5` is replaced by anything non-prime.
And indeed during ring creation the former is caught at the beginning of the method in `sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx` as `field`, `finite` and `prime` whereas the latter is caught as `integer_mod_ring`.

Comment by jpflori created at 2015-11-11 00:40:41

Ok the issue is indeed a mix between `Zmod` and `GF`.
The ring was initially created in singular as a "finite field" but then for some reason the conversion is made as for a "modular integer".
The former one uses `int`s whereas the second one uses `mpz`s.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2015-11-11 00:43:21

I've not checked but I guess the reason is as follow:
* to create the singular ring we ask if the base ring is a prime finite field, not if it's a class derived from `FiniteField`, so classes derived from `IntegerModRing` are caught,
* when sending something into the ring we follow the "classes" logic, boom.

Note for myself: the issue is that at some point r->pFDeg gets replaced from p_WTotalDegree by p_TotalDegree. Don't know why yet.

This is triggered here:

```

    r->pFDeg = p_Totaldegree;
```

line 3837/8 of `ring.cc`.

I rebased the branch (as best as I could), and I did get an error with letterplace:

```
sage: F.<x> = FreeAlgebra(ZZ, implementation='letterplace')
sage: x**2
0
```

I am also getting a variety of failures in testing the `rings/polynomial` folder, but most of them seem to be related to constructing ideals. I haven't run tests elsewhere.

when I compile the recent 'u/jpflori/ticket/17254' or 'u/tscrim/upgrade_singular-17254' with SAGE_DEBUG=yes on my 32 bit fedora22

```
  export SAGE_DEBUG=yes
  ./sage -f singular
```

I get an printout from Singular:

```
  pmLPshift: too big shift requested
```


the corresponding Singular source snippet is (look at 'shiftgb.cc')

```
 if (L+sh-1 > uptodeg)
  {
#ifdef PDEBUG
    PrintS("pmLPshift: too big shift requested\n");
#endif

This seems to be a bug, but the next question is, why do we get there and is this 
an error caused by a previous one or not.

`@`jpflori

when using 'r.pLDeg()' instead of 'p_Deg()' in 'singular_polynomial_deg()'  (src/sage/libs/singular/polynomial.pyx)


some test from above pass, for example:

```
./sage -t src/sage/schemes/affine/affine_point.py 
./sage -t src/sage/schemes/affine/affine_morphism.py 
./sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx  
./sage -t  src/sage/rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_element.py
```

especially some segfaults disappear but then probably other passing tests get broken?

Which example did you have in mind when you changed 'r.pLDeg()' to 'p_Deg()' in 
'singular_polynomial_deg()'  (src/sage/libs/singular/polynomial.pyx)?

Maybe we should discuss with Hans his commit in case it breaks something

---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-05-12 07:55:58

The `plDeg` function is a Singular internal function, made for ecart, and has some restrictions regarding the ordering it can be applied to (no negative weights or things like that).
It gets constructed by Singular at initialization of the object from `p_Deg`.

What we want in Sage is the "usual" degree which is `p_Deg`.

Maybe the doctests were just wrong, i have no idea.

A rebase on recent develop branch was too hard for me so I squashed everything in a new commit.

`@`jdemeyer I had to revert some of your changes in `src/module_list.py` 
(removing singular from include path)
because I failed to do the same for Singular 4.

Is it based off `develop` or `master`? These are different as `develop` is the (released today) 7.3.beta2, whereas `master` is `7.2`.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-05-29 10:11:55

I've seen some errors somewhat similar to that before. It is as if something in the doctesting output gets read with an offset to what it should. I forget exactly what I've done in the past to fix this, but I think it came from a specific type of doctest failure...

are you able to reproduce some of these (false-positive) doctest failures?

The automerging that is used on trac is not as good as what local versions of git can do.

As for comment:170, I haven't testing this branch yet.

I think it's best to discuss with upstream about the crazy `#include` directory structure. It was already bad in Singular 3 and it seems to have gotten worse with Singular 4.

Are these the unacceptable parts? (e.g  in src/sage/rings/polynomial/polydict.pyx)

```

The 1*x output stems from Singular4 and that seems the new behaviour for that ring, for whatever reasons.

also floats are now put in braces,

It's not because Singular prints something in a certain way that Sage has to print it that way. The correct fix is changing the way how Sage prints Singular objects then.

At least we should understand the reasons 
- for ` 1*x `
- and for braces around floats 

I do not know whether it is safe to remove the `1*` and the braces around floats.
I don't know what Sage does for example with `_repr_()`, (which calls `singular_polynomial_str()` which in turn calls `p_String`

And if it' safe, how we should do that? 
regexping each polynomial string on the fly?

I did not fix that one because I have no idea what FreeAlgebra is neither I know something about letterplace implementation, so I did not even try.

for the example

```
sage: F.<x> = FreeAlgebra(ZZ, implementation='letterplace')
sage: x**2
```

in `free_algebra_element_letterplace.pyx`, `__pow__()` routine
after copying the polynomial from one ring to another (with `prCopyR`) something seems broken
(look at the polynomial degree!)

and for the 

```
sage: A.<x> = AffineSpace(GF(3^2, 't'), 1) ## line 299 ##
Ideal(x).weil_restriction()
```


after the `subs()`  command in the `weil_restriction()`-Routine something is screwed up
(look at the polynomial degree!)

p_Deg seems to have problems with lex ordering:

a.degree() # 65536

k = QQ
S.<a,b>=PolynomialRing(k, 2, {"a","b"}, order='degrevlex')
a.degree() #1

```

Comment by jakobkroeker created at 2016-06-13 01:03:09

`@`jpflori

Singulars degree function calls `pLDeg` and not `p_Deg`, 
(grep for '`jjDEG`' in Singular sources), so we should do the same/similar by default.
one of the reasons: `p_Deg` seems returning garbage for lexicographic orderings
(see comment 195)


Question: is the behaviour described in the documentation of the 'degree' function in sage 

```
Note that a matrix term ordering alters the grading of the generators
          of the ring; see the tests below.  To avoid this behavior, use either
          ``exponents()`` for the exponents themselves, or the optional
          argument ``std_grading=False``.
```


natural and is it what a user would expect? Then we could(?) fix it using a different appropriate call:

```
sage: sage: tord = TermOrder(matrix([3,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0]))
sage: sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',3,order=tord)
sage: sage: (x^3*y+x*z^4).degree() # 9
('p_Totaldegree', 4)
('p_WTotaldegree', 9)
('p_WDegree', 9)
('pFDeg', 4)
('pLDeg', 5)
```

I bumped into this a long time ago. It shocked me then, but I adapted & now my code depends on it. If this is true of me, it is probably true of others.

This, for example, is from Sage 6.7:

```
sage: T = TermOrder(matrix(3,3,[1,2,3,3,4,5,0,0,1]))
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',3,order=T)
sage: y.degree()
2
sage: version()
'SageMath Version 6.7, Release Date: 2015-05-17'
```

So IMHO we should mimic Singular for compatibility reasons (i.e., we're mimicking Sage itself).

As the person who introduced the matrix term ordering into Sage, I think that it was just due to the Singular behavior that a matrix term ordering changes the grading of the generators according to the first row of the matrix in Sage. It shocked everyone including John, and was regarded as a bug. So if we can make the grading and the matrix term ordering independent, switching to Singular 4, then I would be happy. Of course it should go with an appropriate deprecation warning.

Comment by jakobkroeker created at 2016-07-04 22:42:40

Currently I implemented `singular_polynomial_deg` as follows
to mimic its behaviour as it was with Singular 3.1.7(and older)

```
    ...
    cdef long _deg, deg
    
    deg = -1
    _deg = -1 
    if x == NULL:
        while p:  
            _deg = p_WTotaldegree(p,r)
          
            if _deg > deg:
                deg = _deg
            p = pNext(p)

        return deg
    ...
```


The degree-related tests seem to pass now.

Remakr: pDeg() seems not usable/has different behaviour; see 
https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=topic/libsingular-devel/dulzKFTF3g8#!topic/libsingular-devel/dulzKFTF3g8 for details.

Further changes: added some missing rComplete() calls (
otherwise prCopyR cannot be used, for instance, see https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=topic/libsingular-devel/4JRHxVXIF70#!topic/libsingular-devel/4JRHxVXIF70 )

could someone please look what goes wrong with

```
./sage -t --long src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/graded_ring_element.py
```

?

I've removed a bunch of very old hackish stuff in `spkg-install`, especially regarding Solaris and sparc.
Maybe too much, but the Singular build system changed so much and it does not seem we have real support for such systems anymore that we should only reintroduce removed hacks if found that are still needed.

It also seems this upgrade to git version rebroke some stuff...

In particular, in `function.pyx`, in `__init__` after calling

```
        if currRingHdl == NULL:
            currRingHdl = ggetid("my_awesome_sage_ring")
            if currRingHdl == NULL:
                currRingHdl = enterid("my_awesome_sage_ring", 0, RING_CMD, &IDROOT, 1)
            currRingHdl.data.uring.ref += 1
```

the last line segfaults because:

```
(gdb) print currRingHdl.data
$2 = {
  i = 0, 
  uring = 0x0, 
  p = 0x0, 
  n = 0x0, 
  uideal = 0x0, 
  umap = 0x0, 
  umatrix = 0x0, 
  ustring = 0x0, 
  iv = 0x0, 
  bim = 0x0, 
  l = 0x0, 
  li = 0x0, 
  pack = 0x0, 
  pinf = 0x0
}
```


I guess some additional funciton should be used to initialize properly `currRingHdl`.

So everyone's always using the _latest_ git version in `spkg-src`?

FWIW, `sed -i` isn't portable, e.g. won't work on Oraclis.

`SPKG.txt` now says "Patches: None" whereas there is `upgrade.patch`.

Sure.  So you'll (by default) check out a specific commit once you know which one is suited best?


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-17 11:42:52

Just for the record:

`make_tar.sh` checks out `HEAD`, and calls `autogen.sh` (without checking for errors) which in turn runs (some random version of) `autoreconf`.

Sure!
Hopefully it should be 4.1 upstream version though I don't know when it's planned.
4.0.3p1 seems to be a poorer choice as a bunch of bugs reported here where fixed in Singular after that release and the fixes would have to be backported...

I was just about to ask you that, as there are many recent commits mentioning 4.1.

I'll probably add something to `spkg-src` regarding checkout and `autogen.sh` / `make_tar.sh` unless you're going to as well.

I just stumbled upon

```sh
cp /tmp/wawa-i/share/singular/LIB/all.lib  singular-$VERSION/Singular/LIB/.
```


Did you mean that, or is there more?

After all, it's `spielwiese`  (~= playground).

Is the repo on GitHub their "master" one, or do they (occasionally) just sync from elsewhere?

I would say the `spielwiese` branch on github is the real master one.

I assume many of them are unrelated to Singular, and due to the POWER7 arch, especially the plots ones.

The singular related ones seem to be:
* schemes/elliptic_curves/isogeny_small_degree.py: segfault.
* modular/modform_hecketriangle/graded_ring_element.py: lots of singular stuff, including coercion.
* schemes/projective/projective_morphism.py: not sure... something about mpfr!
* arith/misc.py: representation of finite fields changed, easy to fix.
* structure/element.pyx: new limitation in max exponent?
* tests/french_book/mpoly.py: different result, might be just as good as the previous one.
* rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py: some different results, surely just as good and even better
* interfaces/singular.py: different Singular printing.
* rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx: printing and squarefree stuff.
* schemes/affine/affine_rational_point.py: bad abort.
* src/sage/libs/singular/function.pyx: hopefully mostly random values changed in internal singular functions.
* rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py: printing of power series changed.
* rings/polynomial/polynomial_singular_interface.py: printing changed.
* rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal_libsingular.pyx: different result, might be just as good.
* schemes/jacobians/abstract_jacobian.py: coercion error?
* rings/polynomial/polydict.pyx: printing of polys changed (x -> 1*x).

As a sidenote, if we really want to stick to a finite ring structure rather than a finite field structure for Z/2Z and Z/pZ, we could do so.
Hans fixed the "1*" disturbing behavior.

For the segfault in `schemes/elliptic_curves/isogeny_small_degree.py` it seems that the following commit now triggers a double free or invalid free (use MALLOC_CHECK_=3 or it will just fails somewhere else randomly):

Kind of painfuly got it:
* nlNormalize(x) can free whatever is in x and change x from a struct to a disqguised int.
* when calling sa2si on a polynomial we call nlGetDenom or such functions on pointers returned by p_GetCoeff for the coeffs, which in turn call nlNormalize and free the underlying memory and modify our pointer, but not the original pointers in the polynomial
* we call p_Delete on the polynomial which call nlDelete on the coeff which gives no indication the underlying memory is freed
* bang


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-08-20 20:15:51

The solution would be something like calling p_SetCoeff whenever we call p_GetCoeff to be sure any hackish modification gets transmitted back to the original place.

In fact the grwalk and brnoeth issues were caused by old `lib` files in `local/share/singular`.
Already fixed upstream.

We're almost good now:
* the "skipping text from `parameter`" text only appears when an error previously happened in Singular, so we it now only appears when testing `libs/singular/function.pyx` becasuse of the `GTZmod` error.
* hopefully the `GTZmod` error will be fixed upstream soon and we can fix a commit to incule here (which should be more or less official Singular `4.0.3`).

Can someone else please test the current branch?
You'll need to build your own tarball first using `spkg-src`.

(There will still be some polishing to do about the Singular C++ function we use, see the comments Hans added in some header files, but that can wait for another ticket.)

Setting `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, debug mode with `xalloc` should be ok although:
* I did not wait for the build to finish,
* it seems auto* wants to reconfigure everything,
* you get a alot of unsued stuff warnings but that's surely normal.

I removed a bunch of hacks from `spkg-install`.

Please test!

I don't follow the ticket very closely, but that makes me jump: what about taking an upstream tarball instead of hacking something?

Minor thing:  All error messages in `spkg-install` should start with `"Error`[`:`]` ..."`.

`spkg-src` could be beautified a bit as well (e.g. not unconditionally deleting `singular.git`, and recording what we checked out, error checking), besides that `curl` is non-standard... ;-)

I did make the tarball using `spkg-src`, as described.
I guess it's an upstream bug: they don't detect presence of aclocal-1.14, even though they don't need it, and bail out, even though it's meant to be a warning. 

Any, why `1.14` only? Won't they be happy with `1.14` or newer?

+1; I'm trying to get cygwin testing ASAP, but first I have to get cygwin builds working against the current `develop` (since my cygwin branch is from a couple months' old `develop`).  Should be close to that, but I'd be fine if this is merged in the meantime, and I can open a ticket for any issue I discover later.

Sure but `curl` was already used in the script anyway and that's only to make the tarball, not for end-users.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-08-31 10:17:30

In `build/pkgs/singular/spkg-install`, if you use `set -e`, it is pointless to do manual error checking like

```
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error applying '$patch'"
        return 1
    fi
```

More generally, better remove all commented-out code unless there is a clear purpose.

        n_Q=2   #/**< rational (GMP) numbers */
        [...]

I would remove the values (like `=0`) because that is only confusing. And please either properly format the comments there or remove them.

This is also silly:

                # it seems Singular uses ints somewhere
                # internally, cf. #6051 (Sage) and #138 (Singular)

                if exponent <= 30:  ringtype = n_Z2m
                else:               ringtype = n_Znm
            else:
                if exponent <= 30: ringtype = n_Z2m
                else:              ringtype = n_Znm
```


You can change code of the form

```
if condition:
    A
else:
    A
```

to

```
A
```

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-08-31 10:31:49

I think this regression is not acceptable:

```
             sage: P.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
             sage: f= x^2 + 2*x*y + 1/2*z
             sage: f.is_squarefree()
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             NotImplementedError: is_squarefree of multivariate polynomials over rings is not implemented.
```


Asking whether a multivariate polynomial is squarefree seems like a very natural thing to do and not something you should just break.

Sorry to say this, but the code is really ugly and certainly uglier than it was before. I see lots of annoying things, like unneeded comments, indentation not a multiple of 4 spaces, needlessly complicated code.

I think this requires somebody to go over all the code and clean it up.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-08-31 11:29:18

Another example:

```
    libSingularFound = False

    for extension in ["so", "dylib", "dll"]:
        lib = os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL']+"/lib/libSingular."+extension # libsingular renamed to libSingular
        if os.path.exists(lib):
            libSingularFound = True
            handle = dlopen(lib, RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_LAZY)
            if not handle:
                err = dlerror()
                if err:
                    print(err)
            break

    if not libSingularFound :
        raise OSError("did not find libsingular file")


    if handle == NULL:
        dlerrormsg = dlerror()
        if dlerrormsg == NULL:
            dlerrormsg = ""
        raise ImportError("failed to dlopen {} ({})".format(lib, dlerrormsg))
```


The `handle == NULL` cannot be reached since we would error out before. The old code is simpler and better:

```
    for extension in ["so", "dylib", "dll"]:
        lib = os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL']+"/lib/libsingular."+extension
        if os.path.exists(lib):
            handle = dlopen(lib, RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_LAZY)
            if not handle:
                err = dlerror()
                if err:
                    print(err)
            break

    if handle == NULL:
        raise ImportError("cannot load libSINGULAR library")
```


There was no reason to make the code more complicated, why was it done???

To be clear: I am very happy with the work done on this ticket, really. I just feel that it's not ready to merge yet. I also feel that not much effort was done to re-use the existing code, that code was rewritten without reason. That makes it hard to review because the diff is huge.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-08-31 16:08:40

No worry Jeroen, that's exactly the point of making a proper review.
To this point this ticket is just a heap of changes, hacks, commits by different people to get the new singular working and at least on my side I did not really look at what the other did, especially given the huge diff.
I'll try to polish the points you mentioned this week.

surely Singular 4.0.3 still has the squarefree test, so it's matter of digging up how it is implemented:

```
> ring r=0,(x,y),dp;
> poly p=x^2+2*x*y+y^2;
>> ring r=0,(x,y),dp;
> poly p=x^2+2*x*y+y^2;
> sqrfree(p);
[1]:
   _[1]=1
   _[2]=x+y
[2]:
   1,2

with the new tarball, it complains about absent aclocal-1.13...

Something needs to be done with this. Normally speaking, you want to make tarballs using `make dist`, after running `./configure`, and not by hand. I'll try to go this route now, and see if this works. By right, it should not require any autotools then (of course one can remove stuff from the tarball, after it's done).

Probably one just needs to run `automake --add-missing --copy` before making tarball.

Is this using the autotools package from #21047?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-09-01 14:44:21

it should not use any autotools while installing, at all. It's clearly something is not done properly while making tarball (by spkg-src).

>There was no reason to make the code more complicated, why was it done??? 

I changed the library loading code to annoy everyone ( just kidding ;-) ) 

``


> Revert simpler old code to load Singular

I disagree. 


Please read my arguments first and reply to the arguments (or disprove them). `@`Jeroen, If it was your code I changed and it hurts you. I'm sorry for that. Still, try to understand the arguments for the change and accept the change if you agree with the arguments.


The old (and current) failing message is 

```
raise ImportError("cannot load libSINGULAR library")
```


In some situations this message gives no clue about the error caused a failing and even worse, is misleading:

The issue I ran into was while working on this upgrade, the loading of libSINGULAR failed, but I could for hours not figure out the cause. The library file was there,
I was able to open it manually. The error message did mislead my thoughts in the wrong direction. The issue was that Singular changed the naming of `'libsingular.so'` to `'libSingular.so' ` (did you note the difference? ('s' vs 'S') and dlopen failed because sage tried to open a non-existing file!

Also, if we reach 

```
if handle == NULL
```


it is legitimate to print for _which_ file we failed to dlopen, because we try several different extensions (`"so", "dylib", "dll"`) in a loop!  Otherwise, by just looking at the error message we would have NO CLUE, for _which_ file `dlopen` failed.  And they may exist all three of them in the same place.

> Remove print debug statement in singular lib

If I recall correctly, if Singular ring creation fails (with exception), 
there is a fallback creating a sage ring, (sage catches the exception,
and no exception is printed)

So my question is, how a developer should properly and easily detect, that 
Singular ring creation ended with an exception?

`spkg-src` just calls `autoreconf` which is the usual way to generate `configure` and `Makefile.in`.
Not sure why running `configure` or `make` decides to rerun `autotools`.
Maybe some timestamps issues after patching but we don't patch a lot, especially we do nothing to `configure` and `Makefile.in`, so...
And IIRC I had no trace of `autotools` getting rerun on my setup, except when using `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` (which was already strange enough).

It's fine to have `print` statement during development, but I would say it should not be there in "production" code.

Comments are available here:

I took the easy solution of removing them form the Cython wrapper.

And rather than trying three different extensions, just try the one corresponding to the underlying system.

Thats fine to remove the (outcommented) debug statements. 

My question is just about if there is a better way to detect a failed singular ring creation  than printouts?.

Sure, there are some comments in `spielwiese/libpolys/coeffs/coeffs.h`,
but then the reader has to investigate (how did _you_ find the `coeffs.h`?)

At least I would add in `decl.pxd` before the line `cdef enum n_coeffType:` something like 

```
# see libpolys/coeffs/coeffs.h for reference
```

What do you think?

Not that I did a better job, but do you agree, that several comments in `coeffs.h` related to  the `enum n_coeffType` are not really helpful? (=> we should improve them?)

I give up, I don't understand quite what's going on. There is a `missing` script in `build-aux/`
that is called on `aclocal-<VERSION>`, where `<VERSION>` is the autotools version the tarball is made with.
But I don't know why it is there and how to disable it.

Not quite sure, since I 'm not a Mac OS user, but it might be (or might be not) a problem on Mac OS. Are you familiar with Mac OS? 

If I recall correctly, on Mac OS we might have both (".so" and ".dylib") or only one of (".so" and ".dylib")? Is that true??

We could ask Jeroen or Jean-Pierre for help to package recent Singular,

...or ask Hans Schoenemann(Singular head developer) for the Singular release timetable...

the following hack appears to stop that aclocal nonsense:

```
--- a/build/pkgs/singular/spkg-install
+++ b/build/pkgs/singular/spkg-install
`@``@` -65,6 +65,9 `@``@` remove_old_version()
     rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular"
 }
 
+touch configure.ac aclocal.m4 configure Makefile.am Makefile.in
+touch */configure.ac */aclocal.m4 */configure */Makefile.am */Makefile.in
+
 config()
 {
     # configure notes (dates from Singular 3.x, maybe outdated for 4.x):
```


will do more tests on it, before pushing this change...

I can tell you if you confirm for me where I should look. When I look in `/Applications/sage-6.7/src/build/lib.macosx-10.9-x86_64-2.7/sage/libs/singular/` I find only `singular.so`. Do you know anywhere else we might put a library? (And is it likely anything would have changed since 6.7?

I guess this one corresponds to the commit I usd:
* http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/ftp/pub/Math/Singular/SOURCES/4-0-3/singular-4.0.3p3.tar.gz

I repackaged it, but now it also fails on my system complaining about `aclocal-1.15`...


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-02 07:42:45

And the upstream tarball is not autoreconfed in the `xalloc` directory so `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` won't work.

---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-02 08:17:56

On my system, `aclocal` first gets called in `resources` seemingly because it thinks that files generated by `libtool` in `../m4/` are older than `aclocal.m4`.

I don't care whose code it was. Probably not mine.

Improving an error message is very good, but I don't see why you needed to complicate the whole code structure for that.

It wasn't clear to me whether it was even possible to reach that line.

Anyway, this has been improved now (although the now-unused variables `dlerrormsg` and `libSingularFound` should still be removed).

I don't know whether it's related to `touch` applied, or not.

I can install the requested aclocal version and see whether without `touch` I get the same error...

Both exist for a different purpose. On OS X:

- `.dylib` = dynamic library (needed for the usual case of linking libraries at build-time).

- `.so` = loadable module (needed for run-time linking, for example Python extension modules).

On most other OSes, there is no difference between these.

Thats not necessary, we cannot get away with only a `touch` anyway because of `xalloc`.
I'll rerun autoreconf on my side to get proper timestamps in all folders...

It might be that gcc is too old, it uses gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.3).

Should I rather build Sage's gcc?

I do touch stuff in `*/` too, not only in top level.
(probably `*` is an overkill, but it works).
 
Indeed, I first tried to touch the top level only, it went a bit further, entered `resources/`, and complained from there instead.

One also needs to `touch [*/]_config.h.in` in order to prevent autoheader` invokation...
I'll modify the `spkg-src` script to:
* use the upstream tarball,
* autoreconf in xalloc,
* touch all files.

Ok reuploaded a new tarball (same address).
Please test.
Note that I finally did:
* use upstream 4.0.3p3
* autoreconf
* autoreconf in xalloc
* touch files

If I only autoreconfed xalloc, then libtool complained about different versions so I autoreconfed evrything then xalloc.
(Yes, I know I could build my own autotools to get matching versions but thats more time consuming.)

this is even after `make distclean`.
No idea what it is and where it really comes from. `make build` completes, but Sage crashes on startup. (in crash report libSINGULAR is also mentioned). I'll attach it in a moment here.

When you get an error during building the Sage library, please do

```sh
env SAGE_NUM_THREADS=1 ./sage -b
```

and post the log of _that_.

Just in case anybody wonders why Singular suddenly builds that fast:


```

-    ENABLE_DEBUGOUTPUT="--disable-debugoutput"

-    # By default, parts of Singular are compiled with -O2 and parts

-    OPTIMIZATION_FLAGS="-O2"
-

```

and

```

Looks like Singular was currently using `-O3` in many (if not all?) places though, despite the warning(s).  Anyway, I've restored the old `[ "$SAGE_DEBUG" != yes ]` branch, for the moment at least.

There's been some change to that file in 7.4.beta3, haven't checked yet where / whether it's related.

In `spkg-install`, there's no error checking done in `install_docs()` and `fix_includes()`, haven't touched these though.

P.S.:  FSF GCC 4.8.5 works for me on _64-bit_ Linux.  (Just the doctest failure above.)

Apparently not.  I'm getting the same with the branch _pulled into_ Sage 7.4.beta3 (as opposed to fetching it, since it's based on beta2 with the Linbox upgrade manually merged in by Dima IIRC).

Presumably unrelated, with GCC 6.2:

```

        res

(Passes when rerun separately though.)

Right, sorry for the multithread mess. With singular built with SAGE_DEBUG=yes I get

I've installed gcc-6.1.1 on my 32-bit system and am rebuilding Sage with it now. Hopefully it will fix the C++ madness...

Not really GCC-related I'd say, but rather 32-bit vs. 64-bit.

Does the following work for you?

OK, long tests pass too, modulo already reported here affine_curves test, and some unrelated numerical noise in gsl (see #21417, needs review).

I guess we should only deal with `dylib` on OS X as far as Singular is concerned.
Can someone confirm this?

I cannot think of another platform producing `dylib` so it's fair.

True.

I just thought it was more readable for a human being.
And was in line with the if clause.
But I might be wrong.

Well, it's more likely we add things to `OPTIMIZATION_FLAGS` than to / past `-O0`.

Got it: `omConfig.h` is needed at build time to define this...
So the easiest solution would be not to modify `xalloc/omalloc.h` and to ship `omConfig.h` jsut as `omalloc` does.
Can you modify `xalloc/configure.ac` by adding 

```
nodist_libomalloc_include_HEADERS = omConfig.h
```

then autoreconf and retest?

I have started working in earnest on a ebuild for sage-on-gentoo. I based on it on stuff in the maintree for 4.0.2. 

Anyway I believe that by default `--enable-gfanlib` is on. libgfan needs `cddlib` to be installed to build. Since `cddlib` is not currently a dependency of `singular`, but is a standard package, we could get different `singular` installs depending on build order.

Since `cddlib` is a standard package I propose we make it a dependency of `singular` - unless there are reasons to have `gfanlib` to be completely disabled.

P.S.: `cddlib` just depends on GMP/MPIR, which is built (nearly) first anyway, so adding the dependency wouldn't slow down anything either.

AFAICS they're only accessible through the Singular binary, and/but we already also have `gfan`.

Indeed, but there is a `libgfan.so` installed (linking may need improvement, I'll look into that) and could be used directly instead of going through a pexpect interface. Of course functionality and performance are also a consideration.

And I am in. There are several other stuff I want to raise or do related to packaging:
1) drop the separate (re-)building of libfactory. Historically this was done to build maccauley2 (anyone else remember that?). My understanding is that upstream maccauley2 includes its own internal copy now. And there is no new style spkg for it currently. Any objections to ditching it?
2) singular install `.pc` files we should use them

I'm guessing you're talking about dropping libfactory since Macaulay2 is an experimental spkg, so I have no objections..


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-09-07 02:32:33

It is not really dropping it since it is naturally produced and installed when building singular. But in singular 3.x it was a static library only and libsingular had its own copy inside. In singular 4, libfactory is dynamic and libsingular depends on it...

In the past we were rebuilding libfactory.a with a slightly different configuration to satisfy Macauley2 and it had no impact on libsingular. This is potentially not the case anymore. I haven't checked but the rebuilding may just be costing us time with no final difference.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-09-07 04:47:32

I am almost done with my first pass at using `Singular.pc`. Once it is done there may be simplifications that can be done in `module_list.py`. But I need to clear the view and be sure that it works as it is first.

well, AFAIK Macaulay2 uses an unpatched version of libfactory.
(more precisely they apply [this](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/blob/master/M2/libraries/factory/patch-4.0.2), but it's just documentation, right?)

I recently spent some time trying to resurrect M2 Sage package, so I'd prefer libfactory as it is now, a separate one.

I will look into this further. But rebuilding libfactory is a risk. I would be OK if libfactory was a separate package and singular and M2 would build on top of it but that's not what it looks like now.

I see `libomalloc`'s in my `loca/lib` but no `libSingomalloc`'s.
Is the latter one what `3.x` used to install?
Whatsoever we could still remove the former one as well.

Maybe we could also use some more wildcards in `module_list.py`, especially for `sage/libs/singular`?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-09-07 09:15:42

Yes that's why I said it was a first pass. Once you have done that, we have a better idea about potential wildcards. `sage/libs/singular` and `sage/algebras/letterplace` both look like they could be reduced to wildcards.

Rebuilding `libfactory` as we do at the moment is nothing but redundant, so we can safely remove the step.

Yes, that helps, since this ticket doesn't build for me for some reason.

This looks to me like a change of coordinates (x to -x) at the first blow-up that is then carried through the rest of the stages. The connecting maps and the new curves are changed consistently so I see nothing incorrect about the new output, it is just a change of variables from the original blow-ups.

Ok, I think we're good now.
Some details are suboptimal, but most of them are documented in the source code (e.g. reuse singular rings).

Ok, I just randomly added reviewers such that Volker or some scripts won't complain.

And we should open (a) follow-up(s) for the mentioned further improvements.

But this really needs to get into Sage, hopefully already beta4.

Seems to work on all buildbots except OSX:

```

Note that OSX is wonky with filename upper/lower case: Case is preserved but ignored when looking up files.

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-09-09 23:09:14

Anyone knows why we deliberately create the link `singular` -> `Singular`? Is it for cygwin. Otherwise let's just drop it and correct the sage internals to use `Singular`. That shouldn't create any problem on OS X.

I just wish I had done a build on my OS X laptop before that came up.


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-09-10 00:10:08

Hmmm, I didn't like

```sh
    # Lower case version is convenient (this can fail on
    # case-insensitive systems, we ignore the error).
    ln -sf Singular singular 2> /dev/null
```

from the beginning... ;-)

So this actually creates a symlink to itself on MacOS X.  Nice.

Just skip symlinking on Darwin?


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-09-10 00:19:41

... or remove the `-s`, making it a hard link, which is less dangerous.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-09-10 00:52:39

If no one can explain why we need `singular` on case sensitive system I think we should just drop it. There is no reason for keeping that kind of useless baggage.

Well, uppercase Singular is just as ugly and inconvenient as libSingular (and their dash-versions); we'd just have to make further changes like you did for the library name.

I personally don't care, but if it doesn't work on MacOS X while it's at the same time not necessary there either, why "disable" it for all other systems, having to make lots(?) of changes elsewhere?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-09-10 02:45:37

I think you are just pulling my leg because of #21430 :) In any case KISS principle dictate that we shouldn't mess up with what we install unless we need to. Someone did it in the past and the cost is either to keep carrying forward and keep paying, or just fix it once for all and pay a final bill. I also happen to have a fairly good idea of what needs to be fixed - because I used to do it in sage-on-gentoo.

My OS X laptop is ready for action before I push a fix.

To my surprise there was only one spot with a call to `singular` instead of `Singular` left. Someone has done some cleaning. I also added a small clean up I had hanging up for ages. `singular.py` and `singular.pyx` where the two last files where `SAGE_LOCAL` is obtained through `os.environ` rather than `sage/env.py`.

I'd like to see this go through the bot again now.

Minor things:

`sage.env` also defines `SAGE_SHARE`.

We generally use `os.path.join()` rather than `+` and `'/'`.

I meant the `yes no` (more results than `checking`; above you have to scroll to the right to see the third), which appears twice in cddlib context, and just noticed the `polymake-config` result.

(There are a few other instances where a result is shown without apparent matching `checking`.)

Thanks Leif :) as for those messages `m4/ax_gfan_check.m4` (I think it is called) is littered with `AC_MSG_RESULT` commands that will have that effect - I am guessing other files may be too. In sage-on-gentoo I decided to disable `polymake` checking until further notice. It looks like `polymake` may need to be built a certain way or something.

Ok, looking at the test (and the referenced Singular trac ticket), that's perhaps not too surprising, *of course* related to `pexpect`, and of course on MacOS X... 8-)

Can you reproduce the issue directly in Singular?  (I.e., that a previously defined variable "vanishes" after pressing Ctrl-C on a following, incomplete line.) 

(And when did it last pass?)


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-09-11 12:04:24

I'll need instruction as I am only familiar with `singular` syntax for a few hours every other year :P when some debugging like this one seems necessary.

And of course I won't be able to apply it before sometime after getting up - likely after I dealt with my backlog of official work.

You could also try running the test in verbose mode (I'm not sure if your Singular got restarted), and playing with the parameters in the test and `_send_interrupt()` (alarm delay, delay before sending `^C`, time waiting for a prompt, and the number of times Sage tries to get the prompt, resending `;`).

W.r.t. Singular syntax, compared to me you're presumably an expert. :-)

Otherwise commands have to be terminated with a `;` (newline alone isn't sufficient), variable definitions look like `def foo=42;`, `foo;` evaluates the expression / prints the value of `foo`.

Hopefully Jeroen has a suited MacOS X box to investigate...

OK, at least that one I think I can understand. A `-D...` is probably incorrect in `Singular.pc` or the whole build system, when you build it with debugging. I have fought for a long time with `-DNDEBUG` in singular 3 because I don't add it by default in sage-on-gentoo.

You get exactly the same kind of error (in reverse).

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-09-12 00:30:43

OK, `omalloc.pc` is not produced with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` and it didn't fail for me because the system one was eventually found (it is part of the require line in `Singular.pc`).

So this is a very real problem.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-09-12 02:10:27

The long term solution would be to have xalloc to produce its own `omalloc.pc` and ship it. This will have to go in `spkg-src` I am surprised at the fact that there is no apparent patching in `spkg-src`, and where is the stuff from `patches/conditional` applied?

Nope, I prefered to produce a patch for the autotools input and output files and apply it just before configuring.
While we're at it, we could also update the `xalloc` patch part about `omConfig.h` to include upstream solution:
* https://github.com/Singular/Sources/commit/bebd5a0361ed499fa0769cad9424e1bb193acd7c

Can you also report the pkgconfig thing to upstream?

In this instance because the tarball that Volker uploaded on the mirror for testing doesn't match the one I linked to in the description. It is not so much the "in place" I am guessing as it is "same name" (which arguably are the same from the point of view of the computer). If it helps I'll change the tarball name at the first opportunity.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-20 06:51:57

That's also why I did not patch in `spkg-src`: you can keep the same tarball.
Sure, then you have to include the autogenerated part of the patches into the patches...
But all that we currently do is in upstream git so should be removed for the next upgrade.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-09-20 13:55:54

Could we try the latest snapshot from upstream to make a tarball so we don't have to worry about the patches?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-09-20 21:15:18

That would be a nice idea but I guess there may still be a need for running autoconf at some point. Actually upstream instruction on using `xalloc` are

```
README for xalloc: a debug helper and alternative to omalloc

- substitute in <topdir>/configure.ac and <topdir>/Makefile.am
   omalloc by xalloc
- in <topdir> run ./autogen.sh
- run <topdir>/configure .....   in <builddir>
- in <builddir> and <topdir>: save omalloc to omalloc.org, ln -s xalloc omalloc
- run make in <builddir>
```

So running autoconf before using `xalloc` is expected. Should we make a conditional patch to follow those instructions more closely. i.e. only apply the patch to configure{,.ac}/Makefile.{am,in} when DEBUG is enabled.

Sure there is.

These instructions are buggy :)
It is enough to `cd` to the `xalloc` dir, then `autoreconf` and if you want debug mode, then you delete the `omalloc` dir and `mv xalloc omalloc`.

To only use patch on top of the upstream `4.0.3p3` what you need to do is to autoreconf everything on your machine on a pristine tree and on a patched one and produce the patch.
Then you ship the pristine tarball (or not so so pristine as we autoreconf it and indeed as you and I may use different autotools version the final autoreconfed dirs and patches may be different) and the patch to autotools input and output files. 
That's what I did before.
And even if we use different autotools version it's not that hard to pick up the useful part of the patches produced by `diff` by hand and remove all the crap only due to different autotools versions.

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-09-20 22:49:55

It is quite obvious to me that I shouldn't be making the next tarball. I just don't work that way. Jean-Pierre, do you mind to regenerate a new tarball and set of patches?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2016-09-22 18:57:36

I have no intentions to work on this ticket, but I am curious how people manage these sets of patches? I know Debian has a clear infrastructure and workflow for this, but we don't seem to have any in Sage. Lately, for packages `scipoptsuite` and `gc` (#21474), I found it to be most convenient to just make a fork and then do `git format-patch` to get a set of patches to put into `patches/`.

> I have no intentions to work on this ticket, but I am curious how people manage these sets of patches? I know Debian has a clear infrastructure and workflow for this, but we don't seem to have any in Sage. Lately, for packages `scipoptsuite` and `gc` (#21474), I found it to be most convenient to just make a fork and then do `git format-patch` to get a set of patches to put into `patches/`.

yes, that's how I (roughly) do this, too. I just use `git diff` rather than `git format-patch`. Is the latter any better?.

It creates the patch file names from the summary lines of the git commits; and it includes a serial number.

The pexpect issue seems to be:
* www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/729
Maybe we should pass the new 'r' value to 'cntrlc' to abort immediately.
`@`Jeroen: any thought about this?

It seems Singular just decides to die:

```

Auf Wiedersehen.^M
```

Running `./sage -sh -c "Singular --cntrlc=a"` seems completely broken for `^C`.

I have not been following the whole discussion (this is comment 506 after all). Which issue are you talking about?


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-29 15:15:38

That on the OS X buildbot the following test fails:

```
        The following works without restarting Singular::
            sage: a = singular(1)
            sage: _ = singular._expect.sendline('1+')  # unfinished input
            sage: try:
            ....:     alarm(0.5)
            ....:     singular._expect_expr('>')  # interrupt this
            ....: except KeyboardInterrupt:
            ....:     pass
            Control-C pressed.  Interrupting Singular. Please wait a few seconds...
        We can still access a::
            sage: 2*a
            2
```


Logging singular output into a file, I see that when it gets interrupted, it decides to quit without further explanation (apart from auf wiedersehen).

And on a machine where the tests passes:

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-30 08:53:18

And I cannot run Singular built in debug mode on that OS X machine.
It complains about not finding `[_]om_Info` wich I see in `libomalloc.dylib` in the `S` section.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-30 09:07:07

During linking some Sage files I see
`-lomalloc -lSingular -lpolys -lfactory -lresources`
which does not look that right.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-30 09:26:35

Anyway, that's not the issue.
My executable has

```
bash-3.2$ nm local/bin/Singular |grep _Info
                 U _om_Info
```

whereas on a debug build on POWER7 it's in the `B` section.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-30 13:16:43

Wahtsoever, it seems Singular behaves better if I don't pass the `-t` (`--no-tty`) option...


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-09-30 13:22:44

Unfortunately, OS X makes it *very hard* to debug your own programs when you don't have root access:

```
dtrace: failed to initialize dtrace: DTrace requires additional privileges
```



---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-09-30 13:43:21

On OS X, when changing the Signal handler to do nothing at all:

```c
void sigint_handler(int sig)
{
  return;
}
```

the problem still remains.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-30 13:45:19

The only difference made by the `-t` option stems from:

```
latest/Singular/feOpt.cc:      case FE_OPT_NO_TTY:
latest/Singular/feOpt.cc-#if defined(HAVE_FEREAD) || defined(HAVE_READLINE)
latest/Singular/feOpt.cc:        if (feOptSpec[FE_OPT_NO_TTY].value)
latest/Singular/feOpt.cc-          fe_fgets_stdin=fe_fgets;
latest/Singular/feOpt.cc-#endif
latest/Singular/feOpt.cc-        return NULL;
```


Anyway, I cannot digup why this option is used.
Let's try to discard it and live without it at first.

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-30 13:47:41

Oops, it just does not work:

```

```



---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-09-30 13:50:01

OK, some progress: in `si_set_signal`, there is this part:

```
  if (sig==SIGINT)
    sigemptyset (&new_action.sa_mask);
  else
    new_action.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;
```

Unconditionally executing the last line (i.e. removing the `else`) fixes the problem.

The man page of `fgets()` reports:

```
RETURN VALUE

       fgets() returns s on success, and NULL on error or when end of file occurs while no characters have been read.
```


This is the problem: an error condition (such as an interrupt) and an EOF both give a `NULL` result for `fgets()` and Singular confuses these.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-30 14:11:17

For the `sa_flags` part, it comes from this upstream commit:

I've reported the fgets issue upstream.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-30 17:23:01

What could be improved later:
* debug (with `xalloc`) build on OS X (`om_Info` gets undefined (`U`) in `Singular`, note that it is ok on linux (`B`), maybe depends on ocmpiler, linker vesions)
* failing test in debug mode,
* strange linking order (`omalloc` comes before `singular`!)
* update to a further version including all patches (everything was reported upstream).


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2016-10-01 12:21:24

About interrupts: my patch is a big improvement but still not 100% robust. The problem is that `fgets()` is too high-level and doesn't give enough control. To do this really properly would involve the `pselect()` system call. I don't know to what extent upstream would accept this, since `pselect()` is POSIX-only.

Let us use a robust interrupt handling in case `pselect()` is supported by the target OS and the flaky one only in remaining cases. 

=> Open a new ticket or change to `needs_work`?

New ticket obviously since the interrupt handling on this ticket is not worse than what we currently have in Singular-3-1-7.

I don't think they care too much about this issue,

but I also think they will accept a patch/pull request if we do all the work.

Is it possible to change the upstream source in a way that we do not need an autoreconf for xalloc? For example, would it be sufficient to add 

```
AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([xalloc])
```


to the `configure.ac` at upstream?

Whatever is required to get rid of repackaging/autoreconf, we should do that.

There is already a different .p3 tarball on the mirrors, so we first have to propagate an updated tarball. And the master fileserver is currently down.
