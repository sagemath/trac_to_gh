The two Cython modules depend on NTL in a very minor way that could be eliminated:

- `sage.rings.integer.Integer` depends on `sage.libs.ntl` to provide method `_to_ZZ`. 

- `sage.rings.integer_ring._coerce_ZZ` depends on `sage.libs.ntl` to provide the method `_coerce_ZZ`.

These methods are only used in `sage.libs.ntl` and in `sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element` and `rings.polynomial.polynomial_zz_pex`.
