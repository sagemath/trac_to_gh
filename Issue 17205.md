We might need to make these changes:

```diff
 Algebra di base e Analisi
-
 =========================
```


```diff
-::
+.. CODE-BLOCK:: text
 
     |------\/\/\/\/\---|massa1|----\/\/\/\/\/----|massa2|
              molla1                  molla2
```


There are also a few other things that have changed (compared to the English version) as it is based off a slightly older version. However, it does not differ by too much.

We should be almost there. Now it just doesn't like:

```diff
-* :ref:`cerca`
+* :ref:`search`
```

(likely due to some overly ambition translating).

That is because we don't have a translation of `tour_plotting` yet. I would just remove those two parenthetical lines.
