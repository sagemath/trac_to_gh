Turns out that at least some progress was made at http://wiki.sagemath.org/i18n/Italian toward this goal.  Maybe it can get in eventually?

Maybe one should merge, and keep the fixes for later ?

I am good with that, but first we need to do the analogous change to #32006.

Looks like we were not getting a docbuild run on this file before:

```
[dochtml] [tutorial ] dumping search index in Italian (code: it)... done

[dochtml] OSError: /home/sagemath/sage-9.1/src/doc/it/tutorial/tour_algebra.rst:292: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
```

We might need to make these changes:

```diff
 Algebra di base e Analisi
-
 =========================
```


```diff
-::
+.. CODE-BLOCK:: text
 
     |------\/\/\/\/\---|massa1|----\/\/\/\/\/----|massa2|
              molla1                  molla2
```


There are also a few other things that have changed (compared to the English version) as it is based off a slightly older version. However, it does not differ by too much.

We should be almost there. Now it just doesn't like:

```diff
-* :ref:`cerca`
+* :ref:`search`
```

(likely due to some overly ambition translating).

now we meet

That is because we don't have a translation of `tour_plotting` yet. I would just remove those two parenthetical lines.
