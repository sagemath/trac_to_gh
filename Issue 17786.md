# Issue 17786: Method to check if a given order of facets is a shelling order. If so, also a method for computing the restricted sets and the h vector. This should coincide with the the usual h-vector.

Federico, I rewrote your algorithm to reflect the mathematics more closely. I think the next step after this would be to implement a new class `ShellableSimplicialComplex` to take advantage of specialized implementations (such as your `h_vector` code).

John, do you think you could do a (second) review of this?

First, I'm not an expert on shellability; my background is algebraic topology, not combinatorics. The basic code looks fine, but I'm worried that this method for testing for shellability is going to be very slow for even modestly sized simplicial complexes. If I naively do

```
sage: T = simplicial_complexes.Torus()
sage: T
Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and 14 facets
sage: T.is_shellable()
```

I'm going to be in for a long wait. Part of the problem is that `T` isn't shellable, so it tries all 87 billion permutations of the facets to see if any ordering works.

At least add a warning in the documentation that it is likely to be slow, maybe even mention that it is a brute force method. A "to do" pointing to some possible improvements would be a good idea, too. An internet search led me to the page http://mathoverflow.net/questions/121371/testing-simplicial-complexes-for-shellability. Maybe implement some ideas from there?
