Keywords: sum, number field, root of unity

The following problem was reported to me by Volker Ziegler:

```
sage: PZ.<X>=PolynomialRing(ZZ) 
sage: Cyclic3.<z>=NumberField(X^2+3) 
sage: zi=Cyclic3.primitive_root_of_unity()
sage: sum([zi^i for i in range(5)]) 
1/2*z - 1/2
sage: sum(zi^i,i,0,5) 
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1288, 0))

Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: An embedding into RR or CC must be specified.
```
The function ``sum`` works in the first case, but fails in the second.

Not a bug. Conversion of number field elements to `SR` requires an embedding, like the error message tries to make clear.

```
sage: Cyclic3.<z> = QuadraticField(-3)    # comes with embedding
sage: zi = Cyclic3.primitive_root_of_unity()
sage: var('i')
i
sage: sum(zi^i,i,0,5)
