Two small remarks on this patch:
1. "is the one roduced by this method." -> "is the one produced by this method."
1. edges are added twice: (x, bar(x)) and later (bar(x), bar(bar(x))=x ). I don't know how to prevent this with simple tests without increasing current running time, but if you have some nice idea...

Also, thanks to patch #11353, the compact version of the complement function is `str(~FrozenBitset(x))`, but it is slightly slower for small values of n.

For me the patch is good to go (install, test, doc, etc.).

Just a reminder of something I already said on #13306: you cannot keep adding stuff forever to the file sage/graphs/graph_generators.py.

At some point, I will have to refuse such patches before that file gets really too big.

Now that we have the generators directory, we can split the graph_generators.py file into dedicated files. Nathann will make such a patch.
