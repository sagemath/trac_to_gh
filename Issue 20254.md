Keywords: steenrod algebra

The following regression seems to be new in Sage7.2.beta5:


```
sage: A=SteenrodAlgebra(2)
sage: for x in A.basis(d=1): print x,x*x
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'int' and 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'
```


Source of the problem seems to be that `steenrod_algebra_basis` returns Rational as entries:


```
sage: ((x,),) = steenrod_algebra_basis(1)
sage: print x,type(x)
1 <type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>
```

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to algebraic topology.

I think this happens in `WeightedIntegerVectors`. I've changed the ticket description accordingly.

Changing component from algebraic topology to combinatorics.

I think that this is caused by #20166.

It is probably this line

```
yield [n / l[0]]
```

in `iterator_fast()`; should be

```
yield [n // l[0]]
```
