I might be slightly inclined to wrapping the doctests with `sorted` instead, but I don't have a very strong opinion. So if you feel this is the better fix, then you can set a positive review once the patchbot comes back green.

Patchbot is green.

The ultimate aim is to make all doctests pass for lie algebras. This is a small positive step, so let us move on.
