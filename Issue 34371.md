Since PARI 2.15, the computation of the rank of rational elliptic curves is available in the `ellrank` function. It is supposedly much faster than what is available in Denis Simon script that sage is using.

Though, the output is not compatible: pari returns a quadruple `[r, s, XXX, v]` where Denis Simon version returns a triple `[r, s, v]`.The `XXX` is related to the Tate-Shafarevich group.
