Isn't "lattice" an ambiguous keyword? It refers to two different things, try to click it and see.

In and of itself, yes, "lattice" is ambiguous. However, "latticeposet" is not a word (in English), but having the "lattice poset" together makes it clear. (More of a random note, there are also 2 other distinct non-mathematical uses of the word lattice that comes to mind as well.)

But trac does not seem to accept two words keyphrase. Trying to put "foo bar, xyzzy" as keywords does just what "foo, bar, xyzzy" would do. lattice_poset maybe?

> However, you're free to build here upon #20669 before it gets released in a beta.

True, but Volker releases betas so often that it makes no big delay.

I would write the input section as:

```
        - ``element_constructor`` -- string; can be one of the following:

          * ``'lattice'`` - (the default) elements of the lattice will
            be lattices that correspond to sublattices of ``self``
          * ``'tuple'`` - elements are tuples of elements of the
            sublattices of ``self``
          * ``'integer'`` - the elements are plain integers
```

Also, it looks like you have an unneeded import of `DiGraph`. Otherwise LGTM.

Formally (i.e., if a English professor looked at it), I'm not sure if the "the" is necessary here because it is plural and the structure of the sentence is declarative. Feel free to add it as it is not wrong. Also, I missed this above, it should just be `(default)`, i.e., no "the" there. Thanks.
