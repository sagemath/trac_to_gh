Thanks for updating the help. I just followed the instructions and came up with the following detailed step-by-step procedure to get sage running under Windows using WLS (which is the updated version from #28549). I think it would be worthwhile to add it to the documentation to make it easier for Windows-folks to contribute. However, I'm not sure which files to edit (in fact, I'm not even able to find the readme edited in this PR).

## Prerequisites
* [Install WSL 2 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
* Activate OpenSSH as described in https://stackoverflow.com/a/40720527/873661

## Git (run everything in the Windows command line / Powershell console)
* Clone repository (preserving symlinks)
  {{{
  git clone -c core.symlinks=true git://github.com/sagemath/sage.git
  cd sage
}}}

* Correct line endings (necessary if global core.autocrlf is set to true; this should be obsolete with #29733):
  {{{
git config --local core.autocrlf false 
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
}}}
* Setup remote trac (nessary if you want to contribute)
  
  Follow the instructions to set-up the ssh key https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent and then follow http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/trac.html#trac-authentication-through-ssh and http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/manual_git.html#chapter-manual-git

```
git remote add trac git://trac.sagemath.org/sage.git -t master
git remote set-url --push trac git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git
```

* Switch to development branch
  {{{
git checkout develop
}}}

## Build sage (run everything from Ubuntu bash)
* Switch to Ubuntu: ` wsl `
* Install prerequisites as described in [corresponding script for Linux](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#linux-recommended-installation). (Without the Python 3.7 dependencies, which apt-get couldn't find.)
   {{{
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ***as in the link***
}}}
* Make sure you are still in the sage folder
* Set how many cores you want to use for building (important, otherwise it will take ages)
  {{{
export MAKE="make -j4"
}}}

* Build
  {{{ 
make
}}}
* Test sage
  {{{
./sage
2+2
}}}
* Register git credentials (necessary if you want to commit from WSL)
  {{{
git config --global user.name "<your name>"
git config --global user.email <your email>
}}}

## Develop (using VS Code)
* Start Visual Studio Code.
* Install "Remote-WSL" extension.
* Press F1, enter Remote-WSL: New Window, and hit enter.
* Use the File menu to open your folder.
* For running & debuging, follow https://code.visualstudio.com/remote-tutorials/wsl/edit-and-debug
* Use `./sage -br` to trigger a rebuild of sage.

I was about to note in the wiki page that by default when you install the `ccache` package on Cygwin it does not configure the system to use ccache.  Of course it's possible to install the Sage `ccache` package but this is unnecessary.  So the documentation should be updated to explain how to configure ccache on Cygwin.  Should I open a new ticket for that?
