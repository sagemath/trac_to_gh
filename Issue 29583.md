Keywords: Tensor product

With this ticket we *SageMath* through the methods :meth:`~sage.tensor.modules.free_module_tensor.FreeModuleTensor.display` and :meth:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield.TensorField.display` is now able to compact the display of the tensor product in the form `dx^2`. In the case the variable is something like `x^2`, to avoid any misunderstanding in `dx<sup>2</sup>2`, one can set ``compact_product=False`` in display to get the old displaying style `dx<sup>2*dx</sup>2`.

We have also defined the rasing to power, for tensors.
