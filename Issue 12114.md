# Issue 12114: docstring for factorial function mentions unsupported algorithm keyword

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12286

Keywords: factorial function symbolics sd35.5

The docstring for the global `factorial` function claims that an optional keyword `algorithm` can be specified, but currently this raises an error. 


```

sage: factorial(4, algorithm='pari')
...
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
```



```
sage: factorial(10, algorithm='gmp')
...
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
```

Changing keywords from "factorial function symbolics sd35.5" to "factorial function symbolics sd35.5 beginner".

I removed all mention of the algorithm argument, and better defined what 'n' value can be provided (with the help of Benjamin Jones).

This probably needs to be formatted so that the line isn't so long.  You can do it exactly like the ones you deleted, in terms of the spacing.

Yeah, this hasn't been used since before the Pynac switch.    Anyway, looks good!
