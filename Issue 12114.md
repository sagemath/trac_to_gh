Keywords: factorial function symbolics sd35.5

The docstring for the global `factorial` function claims that an optional keyword `algorithm` can be specified, but currently this raises an error. 


```

sage: factorial(4, algorithm='pari')
...
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
```



```
sage: factorial(10, algorithm='gmp')
...
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
```
