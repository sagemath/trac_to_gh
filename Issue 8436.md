# Issue 8436: Automatic LaTeX output is broken in notebook

Clicking on the left of a cell output in the notebook used to cycle wrapped-unwrapped-hidden for text output and typeset-LaTeX_code-hidden for typeset output.

After upgrade to 4.3.3 in the second case I get typeset-typeset-hidden cycle.

The previous behaviour is very convenient for inserting a bunch of expressions generated by some cycle into papers.

Just to check:  Did you first notice this problem in 4.3.3?

Yes. I am pretty sure that 4.3.1 was fine, although I can't guarantee it.

We made the change at #3083.  I think I did this for the sake of new Sage users, who might evaluate `sage.algebras.steenrod_algebra?` (via shift-enter), when the cell is in the "unwrapped" mode.

Just in case: You can also double-click on typeset output to see the source.

If it's not otherwise "essential," should we revert this change?

Don't run jsMath on wrapped output.  sagenb repo.

Replying to [comment:3 mpatel]:

This is not the same. Double-click shows a gray window with the source of ONE typeset output and if you have used several show(...) in one cell (or in a cycle), you need to do if for each of them separately.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

It seems that reverting the change doesn't affect printing and publishing docstrings.
