CC:  klee

With Python 3, the HTML documentation for `GlobalOptions` does not show the docstring, but something else. For example in the case of `QQbar.options`, this is what gets displayed:

```
options = Current options for AlgebraicField - display_format: decimal
```

This is what is called "String form" in the introspection `QQbar.options?`.

With Python 2, the HTML documentation shows the "Docstring" as desired:

```
options(*get_value, **set_value)
OPTIONS:

* "display_format" -- (default: "decimal")

  * "decimal" -- Always display a decimal approximation

  * "radical" -- Display using radicals (if possible)

See "GlobalOptions" for more features of these options.
```


This is not unique to `QQbar`, but can also be seen with `Tableaux.options`, for instance.

Can you provide more details? From the Sage command line or from the Jupyter notebook, if I type `QQbar.options?`, I see the same thing in Python 2 or Python 3.

The problem is that `sage_autodoc` determines that `QQbar.options` should be documented as an attribute rather than a function, in Python 3, because the expression in the last return statement is true.

Note that `class options(GlobalOptions)` does not create a subclass, but an instance of `GlobalOptions` by some magic, so it acually is an attribute, which nevertheless should not be documented as such.

Also note that `sage_autodoc` is a modified copy of [Sphinx' autodoc](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/v1.8.5/sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py#L1383-L1396). The problematic expression has not been added by Sage, but is part of the upstream version. The PY2-check was added in #26949 when `sage_autodoc` was updated to be more in line with the upstream version (which is Python-3-only I assume).

Any ideas how to solve this? It would be good if we could avoid adding a special case for `GlobalOptions` and also avoid deviating from upstream too much.

The problem is that `GlobalOptions` attribute get documented by `AttributeDocumenter` unlike by `FunctionDocumenter` in python 2. This  is because of the extra check for "obscure case" in python 3.

I don't clearly understand what the "obscure case" is. Anyway, the extra check is apparently doing more harm than good to sage documentation. In the patch, I turned off that check, as you originally suggested. I expect the generated documentation is more close to the version in python 2. 

We need to examine the generated documentation to see if there is any regression from the version in python 2.

```

I ran a diff on the generated html files before and after the patch using Python 3. The change mainly affects all the `options` classes that are now documented as function rather than attribute.

Besides `options`, there are two or three cases where the documentation also switched from attribute to function, for example

[FiniteStateMachine.default_format_letter](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/graphics_inset/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.html#sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FiniteStateMachine.default_format_letter)

which is just an alias to an imported function

```
    default_format_letter = latex
```

so `default_format_letter` now shows the documentation from `latex`, which seems correct.

However, this patch also affects a number of attributes that completely disappear from the documentation after the patch, for example:

[AbstractGrowthGroupFunctor.rank](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/graphics_inset/reference/asymptotic/sage/rings/asymptotic/growth_group.html#sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group.AbstractGrowthGroupFunctor.rank),
[GenericGrowthGroup.CartesianProduct](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/graphics_inset/reference/asymptotic/sage/rings/asymptotic/growth_group.html#sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group.GenericGrowthGroup.CartesianProduct),
[GenericSymbolicSubringFunctor.coercion_reversed](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/graphics_inset/reference/calculus/sage/symbolic/subring.html#sage.symbolic.subring.GenericSymbolicSubringFunctor.coercion_reversed),

[CNFEncoder.permutations](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/graphics_inset/reference/sat/sage/sat/converters/polybori.html#sage.sat.converters.polybori.CNFEncoder.permutations)

Are these supposed to appear in the documentation or not? Most of them do not have documentation strings attached to them, but some do (possibly unintentionally), for example:

[FSMState.initial_probability](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/graphics_inset/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.html#sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FSMState.initial_probability)

They did not appear in python 2 documentation, but started to appear in python 3 documentation by #26949, perhaps because of the extra check in `AttributeDocumenter`. So I think they should not appear in the documentation. I regard this as an improvement.

This example is interesting. 

The attribute `initial_probability` did have docstring, but as of sage 9.0.beta4, the docstring is removed, or rather moved into the class (`FSMState`) docstring. This is why `initial_probability` (and `is_initial`) disappeared from the python 3 documentation. 

Then why the docstring was moved to class docstring? Perhaps because the attribute docstrings do not get doctested. I think this is a defect of sage doctesting -- the original docstring was nice!

To summarize, I see no regression from your report.
