```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')
sage: R = E.padic_regulator(7)
sage: len(R.list())
37
sage: s = str(R)
sage: len(R.list())
19
```


Similarly:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')
sage: R = E.padic_regulator(7)
sage: len(R.list())
37
sage: R.precision_absolute()
20
sage: len(R.list())
37
sage: R.precision_relative()
19
sage: len(R.list())
19
```


This is likely due to `_normalize` not getting called when necessary at object creation.

Looks good to me.  I should look over the Sphinx documentation to see when `..` is advisable.  The lack of `::` was just an oversight.
