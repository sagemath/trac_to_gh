Hi Andrew,

Overall, this looks good! It's a bit frustrating to have to write so many methods that are very similar to existing ones, but I did not quite see a good way to factor stuff out either.

One thing that could be done is to add a class `CartanType_standard` in cartan_type.py (and inherit from it in the `CartanType_standard_*` classes. At least, the inheritance from `UniqueRep` and `SageObject` would be written out only once.

Plugin failures:
- startup: I guess we can ignore that one
- trac: in cartan_type.py, the second quote in `trac:`20973'` should be a backquote

Some comments and suggestions:

The method description in the docstrings is not rather inconsistent. I can see the origin: the rest of the root system code that you took inspiration from is not very consistent either (mostly by my fault :-)). Still it would be good to make it more uniform.


```
    r"""
    Return ... .

    This implements :meth:`` by returning True.

    EXAMPLES::

    """
```


I would move most of the doctests from `type_A_infinity.CartanType.__init__` in the class docstring, as this is useful documentation. Maybe with a bit of text interspersed explaining what this type is about (if this feels natural to you).

While you are at it, it should be easy to implement the `index_set` method.

Cheers,
                              Nicolas

Thinking twice about it, Travis is probably right: once `dynkin_diagram` will be implemented (which should boil down to returning some object such that `t[i][j]` returns the right thing), there is a non trivial chance that the rest of the root system code would work with just minor glitches here and there.

But if you don't need it yourself, that's for a later ticket.

Another direction for relatively easy generalisation is `B_oo` etc.

I have addressed all of the comments above. Given the ambiguity between `oo` and `+oo` I have used `NN` and `ZZ` throughout, although `oo` is a synonym for `ZZ`:

```sage
    sage: CartanType(['A', NN])
    ['A', NN]
    sage: print(CartanType(['A', NN]).ascii_art())
    O---O---O---O---O---O---O---..
    0   1   2   3
    sage: CartanType(['A', ZZ])
    ['A', ZZ]
    sage: print(CartanType(['A', ZZ]).ascii_art())
    ..---O---O---O---O---O---O---O---..
        -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3

```

There is now a `CartanType_standard` class in `cartan_type.py` but, to be honest, it does not save a great deal. I played round a little to try and rationalise the code but everything seems very tangled because small changes in one place cause errors elsewhere. I think that if the code is to the cleaned up then it needs to be done by some one who is more familiar with it and its' applications in sage.

The code works with 7.3.beta7 but it will almost certainly not merge on the next release on the develop branch given trac:18555.

> I have addressed all of the comments above. Given the ambiguity between `oo` and `+oo` I have used `NN` and `ZZ` throughout, although `oo` is a synonym for `ZZ`:

That is exactly what I was just going to suggest this morning. :P I think this is the best way forward.

> There is now a `CartanType_standard` class in `cartan_type.py` but, to be honest, it does not save a great deal. I played round a little to try and rationalise the code but everything seems very tangled because small changes in one place cause errors elsewhere. I think that if the code is to the cleaned up then it needs to be done by some one who is more familiar with it and its' applications in sage.

Yea, I remember them being fairly interconnected, sometimes in subtle ways. I remember fighting some things when I was trying to implement hyperbolic types (which I don't know when I will get back to this).

> The code works with 7.3.beta7 but it will almost certainly not merge on the next release on the develop branch given trac:18555.

If #18555 really does cause a conflict, which I agree it probably does, then let's have a preemptive strike and base this over #18555.

Also, this sentence is vague:

```
    In sage `oo` is the same as `+Infinity` so `NN` and `ZZ` are used to
    differentiate between the `A_{+\infty}` and `A_{\infty}` root systems.
```

In particular, what does `oo` do? I would write the entire docstring as:

```python
class CartanType(CartanType_standard, CartanType_simple):
    r"""
    Define the Cartan type `A_{\infty}`.

    We use `NN` and `ZZ` to explicitly differentiate between the
    `A_{+\infty}` and `A_{\infty}` root systems. While `oo` is
    the same as `+Infinity` in Sage, it is used as an alias
    for `ZZ`.
    """
```

I would also move all of the `EXAMPLES::` from the `__init__` into the class-level doc above (but leave the ones in `TESTS::` in `__init__`).
