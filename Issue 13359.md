Thanks, Nicolas, for the review patch. I folded it (after some edits in the docs). The patch is ready for review!

Hi Dan,

I fixed the issue that the Demazure operators were not idempotent (one of the inequalities
was wrong). Also, I removed the truncated option from demazure_operator since it was not really used anywhere anymore.
