In the documentation, http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/matrix/constructor.html,

it states that matrices can pass in callable objects, though there is no example or test of this here.  Is there documentation at least showing a test of this functionality?  If not, it probably should be added, if not for the end user, at least to ensure it doesn't break.

In the meanwhile, any tip on getting a matrix like:

['apple', 'frog']
[[3,2]   , 3      ]

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13570

Yes, there is:

```
sage: m = matrix(QQ, 3, 3, lambda i, j: i+j); m
[0 1 2]
[1 2 3]
[2 3 4]
```

I don't think there is special support for matrices *of* callable objects on which multiplication would act as function application, if that is what you are looking for.

Thanks.  I ended up solving what I needed to solve and ultimately defined class on which there exists multiplication and addition, and that multiplication is cartesian product and addition is disjoint unions, and it works well.
