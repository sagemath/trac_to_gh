# Issue 23142: LatticePoset: add adjunct()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This patch will add the adjunct operation defined in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02489.pdf. The definition is not lattice-specific, i.e. could be defined to all posets. However this is implementation for lattices only; it is possible to extend it later.

Travis, how should one say this: "Adjunct [with|by] L [on|by] pair (a, b)."?

(No prepositions in my native language, these are hard for me.)

Just pinging for this language question.

Sorry, I missed your initial question. In this case, I would say you have it right: `...adjunct by ``other`` on the pair ``(a, b)```. The first should not be `with` because that usually has an "equal status" nuance. Let me put it like this, I do not think anyone would say `A with B` if you could write notation like f<sub>A</sub>(B).

Can you add an example that explains the labeling change in more detail (and to show it works correctly)?

Also, typo:

```diff
-`(a, b)` of `L` if defined such that `x < y` if
+`(a, b)` of `L` is defined such that `x < y` if
```
