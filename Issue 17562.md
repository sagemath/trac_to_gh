# Issue 17562: refactor real_set.RealInterval

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17799

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2015-02-18 08:27:51

The class `sage.sets.real_set.RealInterval` is badly named. Despite being private it can be easily confused with `RealInterval=sage.rings.real_mpfi.RealIntervalFieldElement`. The ticket will rename `real_set.py:RealInterval` and add code such that `RealSet`s can be created from it. The reason the latter is needed is, although the class is private, its instances can be exposed and users may at least want to create new `RealSet`s from them.

You missed this on in the docstring of `__init__`:

```
You are not supposed to create :class:`RealInterval` objects
```

Also could you also move the docstring (except the example block) up to the class level? Thanks.

You haven't read the description: The reason the latter is needed is, although the class is private, its instances can be exposed and users may at least want to create new RealSets from them.

Okay, it's no longer needed by #14801.

I made some trivial documentation tweaks. If you're happy them, then positive review.
