The modified test in `src/sage/calculus/functional.py` seems to have the variables reversed. It seems to me that it's meant to compute the inverse of the previous result, or am I missing something? Currently it computes the ilt of a constant, which is kind of pointless.

Replying to [comment:3 arojas]:

You are right, but actually the example itself is fishy since the variable of the Laplace transform (`a` in this case) already appears in the function being transformed.  I would suggest simplifying the example as follows (also fixing whitespace):

```diff
--- a/src/sage/calculus/functional.py
+++ b/src/sage/calculus/functional.py
@@ -22,12 +22,12 @@ EXAMPLES: We illustrate each of the calculus functional functions.
     a
     sage: taylor(a*sin(x)/x, x, 0, 4)
     1/120*a*x^4 - 1/6*a*x^2 + a
-    sage: expand( (x-a)^3 )
+    sage: expand((x - a)^3)
     -a^3 + 3*a^2*x - 3*a*x^2 + x^3
-    sage: laplace( e^(x+a), x, a)
-    e^a/(a - 1)
-    sage: inverse_laplace( e^a/(a-1), x, a)
-    ilt(e^a/(a - 1), x, a)
+    sage: laplace(e^x, x, a)
+    1/(a - 1)
+    sage: inverse_laplace(1/(a - 1), a, x)
+    e^x
 """

 from .calculus import SR
```

This already succeeds with the current Maxima version.

Apart from that, it would be nice to have a doctest in `src/sage/calculus/calculus.py` showing that taking the inverse Laplace transform of a constant now returns a delta function.
