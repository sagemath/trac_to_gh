The modified test in `src/sage/calculus/functional.py` seems to have the variables reversed. It seems to me that it's meant to compute the inverse of the previous result, or am I missing something? Currently it computes the ilt of a constant, which is kind of pointless.

You are right, but actually the example itself is fishy since the variable of the Laplace transform (`a` in this case) already appears in the function being transformed.  I would suggest simplifying the example as follows (also fixing whitespace):

This already succeeds with the current Maxima version.

Apart from that, it would be nice to have a doctest in `src/sage/calculus/calculus.py` showing that taking the inverse Laplace transform of a constant now returns a delta function.
