Am I correct in that adding an small hyphen/dash `-` for each box would not make the resulting boxes look more square? Also, how difficult would it be to handle the cases of empty row/column for skew partitions?

I do not think its a good idea to add something in the boxes. They look square enough for me.

Handling empty columns seems not too hard, but empty lines will be a pain.

I did not mean something in the boxes, just a little more to the top and bottom of each box. Anyways, this will work for now, but this suggests having something more generic in `combinat/output.py` similar to what we have for latex. If you don't want to do that now, then you can set this to a positive review.
