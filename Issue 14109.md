# Issue 14109: spkg containing precomputed data for exceptional finite and affine mutation types of quiver

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14313

Original creator: stumpc5

Original creation time: 2013-03-19 18:10:23

Assignee: tbd

CC:  gmoose05

Keywords: quiver, cluster, mutation type

This spkg is an addition to #13425.

It contains data of exceptional mutation classes that are precomputed. The package is found at

http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/cluster_seed-1.0.spkg

This package is not necessary for the features in #13425 to work but speed things quite a bit (up to minutes down to less than a second to compute a quiver mutation type).

Is this package standard, optional or experimental?

```
## Dependencies

 * Sage library
```

should be

```
## Dependencies

 * None
```

(I don't see why it depends on the Sage library, it's just data)

And could you document where this data comes from? This completely undocumented set of data is impossible to maintain.

I never wrote a package before, so I don't know the procedure to get it in Sage as a standard package. If that's okay, I'd like to make it standard.

I updated the documentation - could some please recheck if this is right now?

Thanks!

Added a new _standard_ package at least requires a discussion/vote on sage-devel. Let's go for optional first.

Changing component from packages to optional packages.

The documentation looks much better now.
