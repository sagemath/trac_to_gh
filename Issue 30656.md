Replaces sage's custom autodoc extension by the built-in one. 

For some reason, my local installation only wants to build the documentation for the manifold package. For this, I verified that the newly generated documentation is on par with the old one. This was the case except for parameters added with the ``@`output` decorator. This should be fixed with #30884.
Please let me know if there are other customization in the sage autodoc file except for the `sage_wraps` decorator support.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30893

Building the docs fails immediately for me, because text roles like `:arxiv:`, `:trac:`, etc. are no longer defined.

I think it would be better, at least as a first step, to update `sage_autodoc` to incorporate the recent changes in Sphinx's `autodoc`.

My understanding is that one of the main reasons for using our own version of `autodoc` is to be able to include Cython files in the documentation, and this requires customization of the introspection code. So that is something you should test when experimenting with this: how is autodoc working on Cython files?

That should be fixed now.

I tried rebasing first, but there were quite a few changes which made it rather difficult. So I thought replacing it completely, and then implement the necessary changes elsewhere would be easier.

I will do so! I just figured out how to convince sage to produce the documentation for something else then the manifold package. After playing around a bit, I realized that there might be quite some changes necessary (e.g. `instancedoc` doesn't play nicely with Python's `inspect`). Will keep you updated.
