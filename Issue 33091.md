Incidentally, `Permutation` doesn't have `order` either, `PermutationGroupElement` does.  I don't see a good reason for that, though.

It is a big unfair to call these fixes because they are not bugs. However, thank you for these improvements.

I think the `__getitem__` could be made more efficient by directly accessing the underlying information:

```
def __getitem__(self, i):
    return (self._perm[i], self._colors[i])
```

A similar change should be done for `SignedPermutations` as the iteration has a different behavior (which is natural and by design even though it is a behavior change when going to the subclass). I think we should try and optimize this method a bit.

Please also add a doctest for `to_cycles(singletons=False, use_min=False)`.

Can you switch to Python variable lower_case_var_anmes?

It would be good to not call the variable `next` to not conflict with the iterator advancement function.

I am wondering if it might be better to use the underlying permutions `to_cycle()` and then add in the computation based on the “colors”. This might not necessarily be faster, but it would reduce some of the code duplication. Although it would obfuscate the code a bit. Your thoughts on this? One advantage of this implementation is that it could easily be modified for general colored permutations, where the `order()` could then be lifted.

I decided to just go with the current method with some slight modifications. It could be refactored, but I figure the extra overhead to make it work for permutations is not worth it.

I added also a `__call__` for signed permutations.

Here is a comparison with your comment:9 code (slightly tweaked to optimize it):

```
sage: pi = SignedPermutation([-4, 5, -1, 2, -3])
sage: pi.to_cycles2()
[(-1, -4, -2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 2, -5, -3)]
sage: %timeit pi.to_cycles()
7.58 µs ± 51.4 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit pi.to_cycles2()  # comment:9 code
9.53 µs ± 65.3 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```

versus my pushed code:

```
sage: %timeit pi.to_cycles()  # pushed commit
7.55 µs ± 109 ns per loop per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```


Comparison of my commit:

```
sage: pi = SignedPermutations(7)([2,-1,4,-6,-5,-3,7])
sage: %timeit pi.to_cycles()
10.9 µs ± 303 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit pi.to_cycles(singletons=False)
11.2 µs ± 223 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```

versus your version:

```
sage: %timeit pi.to_cycles()
12.4 µs ± 3.27 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit pi.to_cycles(singletons=False)
13.5 µs ± 3.96 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```


With the branch I pushed, slices are faster for colored and signed permutations:

```
sage: C = ColoredPermutations(4, 3)
sage: s1,s2,t = C.gens()
sage: x = s1*s2*t
sage: %timeit x[:]
1.19 µs ± 2.14 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)

pi = SignedPermutation([-4, 5, -1, 2, -3])
sage: %timeit pi[:]
1.31 µs ± 18.3 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
sage: %timeit pi[1::2]
1.42 µs ± 15.5 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
```

versus before

```
2.23 µs ± 30.4 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)

6.07 µs ± 40.4 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
3.62 µs ± 22.2 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```
