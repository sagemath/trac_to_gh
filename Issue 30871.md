We propose an implement of lazy p-adic numbers relaying on relaxed arithmetics proposed by van der Hoeven and al.

Here is a small demo:


```
This module provides basic support for lazy p-adic integers.

    sage: R = ZpL(5)
    sage: R
    Lazy 5-adic Ring

One creates elements as usual::

    sage: a = R(17/42)
    sage: a
    ...00244200244200244201

    sage: R.random_element()  # random
    ...21013213133412431402

By default, 20 digits of precision are computed (and printed).
If more (or less) digits are needed, one can specify it as follows::

    sage: b = R(42/17, prec=30)
    sage: b
    ...104201213402432310420121340301

Alternatively, one can increase the precision using the method meth:`jump`::

    sage: a.jump(30)
    sage: a
    ...244200244200244200244200244201

Standard operations are implemented::

    sage: a + b
    ...03232011214322140002
    sage: a - b
    ...42311334324023403400

    sage: a * b
    ...00000000000000000001
    sage: a / b
    ...12442142113021233401

We observe again that only 20 digits are computed.
If we need more, we have to create a new variable::

    sage: c = a / b
    sage: c.jump(40)
    sage: c
    ...4230030104200433321312442142113021233401

Note that this automatically increases the precision on `a` and `b`::

    sage: a
    ...4200244200244200244200244200244200244201
    sage: b
    ...2134024323104201213402432310420121340301

Equality test works but equality is only checked up to the
*minimal* current precision of the elements::

    sage: c == R(289/1764, prec=100)
    True
    sage: c == R(289/1764 + 5^50, prec=100)
    True

    sage: c.jump(100)
    sage: c == R(289/1764 + 5^50, prec=100)
    False
    sage: c == R(289/1764 + 5^50)
    True

A quite interesting feature with lazy p-adics is the possibility to
create (in somes cases) self-referrent numbers. Here is an example.
We first declare a new variable as follows::

    sage: x = R()
    sage: x
    O(1)

We then write down an equation satisfied by `x`::

    sage: x == 1 + 5*x^2
    True

The variable `x` now contains the unique solution of the above equation::

    sage: x
    ...04222412141121000211

This works because the `n`-th digit of the right hand size of the
defining equation only involves the `i`-th digits of `x` with `i < n`
(this is due to the factor `5`).

As a comparison, the following produces an error::
    sage: y = R()
    sage: y == 1 + 3*y^2
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RecursionError: definition looks circular

Previous self-referrent definitions also work with system of equations::

    sage: u = R(); v = R(); w = R()

    sage: u == 1 + 2*v + 3*w^2 + 5*u*v*w
    True
    sage: v == 2 + 4/w^3 + 10*(u + v + w)^2
    True
    sage: w == 3 + 25*(u*v + v*w + u*w)
    True

    sage: u
    ...21111231040212114001
    sage: v
    ...04313122332303332234
    sage: w
    ...30020001022124410403
```

I'm a bit disappointed but I note your argument for ``@`` and will probably disallow this construction.

About performances, it's of course not as fast as other types of p-adics but I would say that it's already reasonable (although optimizations are still possible):


```
    sage: R = ZpL(5)
    sage: a = R.random_element()
    sage: b = R.random_element()
    sage: c = 1 + 5*R.random_element()
    sage: %timeit _ = (a + b)@10000
    848 µs ± 614 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = (a * b)@10000
    9.59 ms ± 116 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = (a / b)@10000
    11.7 ms ± 215 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = c.sqrt()@10000
    13.7 ms ± 240 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```


Compare with:


```
    sage: R = Zp(5, prec=10000)
    sage: a = R.random_element()
    sage: b = R.random_element()
    sage: c = 1 + 5*R.random_element()
    sage: %timeit _ = a + b
    1.21 µs ± 9.2 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000000 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = a * b
    87.8 µs ± 130 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = a / b
    667 µs ± 4.08 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = c.sqrt()
    27.4 ms ± 125 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```


EDIT: use `%timeit` instead of `%time`

Maybe some comments on the timings.
The "bad" performances of lazy p-adic come from two different sources:
- the underlying arithmetics looses a factor log(precision) in the complexity
- I'm working on digits, which means that I basically only manipulate integers between 0 and p (here p=5) and encode them on longs.

Although I cannot do much to get rid of the first problem, I can certainly do something for the second one: instead of working with digits, I can work with blocks of digits (limbs) of the correct size. Actually, I want to do this but this requires many changes in my current code and I planned to delay this for another ticket.

In any case, when p becomes larger, the differences of performances between lazy p-adics and classical p-adics tend to get smaller.


```
    sage: p = next_prime(2^63)
    sage: R = ZpL(p)

    sage: a = R.random_element()
    sage: b = R.random_element()
    sage: c = 1 + p*R.random_element()
    sage: %timeit _ = (a + b)@10000
    3.51 ms ± 407 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = (a * b)@10000
    73.7 ms ± 189 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = (a / b)@10000
    83.4 ms ± 471 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = c.sqrt()@10000
    160 ms ± 3.31 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```


and:


```
    sage: p = next_prime(2^63)
    sage: R = Zp(p, prec=10000)

    sage: a = R.random_element()
    sage: b = R.random_element()
    sage: c = 1 + p*R.random_element()
    sage: %timeit _ = a + b
    86.4 µs ± 578 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = a * b
    9.04 ms ± 63.9 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = a / b
    78.8 ms ± 415 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
    sage: %timeit _ = c.sqrt()

Fixed.

> * In `_repr_` it looks like some print modes aren't included (e.g. `terse` and `val-unit`).  I would guess it to be easier to use code from `padic_printing.pyx` here.

They are included.
I agree that we should include this code in `padic_printing.pyx` but it does not sounds easy.

> * When converting an element between a lazy p-adic ring and its field of fractions it looks in `_element_constructor_` that you create a bounded element.  Why is this necessary?  It also looks like you don't check that the primes are the same....

It's true than I call `LazyElement_bound` but I pass in `boundprec=maxordp` so that the resulting element remains unbounded. It's a convenient way to do copies. (I cannot return the same element because the parent changes.)

> * In `next_c()` for `LazyElement_div`, if `definition is None` and you set it, don't you still want to execute the `else` clause?  If not, you can just `return self._bootstrap_c()` rather than `if error: return error`.  Same for `LazyElement_sqrt`.

Well, `_bootstrap_c` already computes the first significant digit, so I think it's fine like this. I changed `if error: return error` to `return self._bootstrap_c()`.

> * In the `__init__` method for `LazyElement_sqrt`, shouldn't you check that the valuation is even?

It's checked in the bootstrap function.
I think we cannot check it in the `__init__` method because the valuation might be not known for self-referent numbers.
