According to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/extdev/index.html#extension-metadata on should specify parallel_read_safe if the builder is able to read source files in parallel.
> 'parallel_read_safe': a boolean that specifies if parallel reading of source files can be used when the extension is loaded. It defaults to False, i.e. you have to explicitly specify your extension to be parallel-read-safe after checking that it is.

This is done in this ticket. I didn't had any problems with it, but I'm also not completely sure the builders are indeed able to read source files in parallel.

Is there a reason for doing this? It didn't speed up docbuilding for me. Why change from the default setting?

You have to run `sphinx-build -jNUM` for this to be activated. This ticket is a first step to use this during sage's docbuild. My aim was actually to already implement this as part of this ticket, but I don't have the time right now.

On second thought, this may not be related, although `./sage --docbuild ...` is much slower on my Mac than `make doc` is, probably because of this issue.

I think we should at some point replace our custom docbuilder with what's provided by Sphinxn -- as it's a hack no current Sage dev fully understands, and is thus very hard to maintain. 

It would be great to have a ticket where the task to do this replacement is set out in steps.
