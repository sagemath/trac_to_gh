# Issue 21333: Move non-scripts of src/bin/ elsewhere (and also move their install location)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21570

Original creator: mkoeppe

`src/bin` contains some stuff that is not an executable script, such as `sage-README-osx.txt`.
It should be moved elsewhere; and also be installed in a place other than `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.

See also:
 - #21569: Install `src/bin/*` scripts via `setup.py` (`scripts`, `console_scripts`)
 - #21559: Move sage-the-distribution scripts from src/bin to build/bin

As for the OS X readme, note this was already essentially done in #25995 (a year and a half ago) so probably you could just delete it without further problems - see comment:30:ticket:25995.

Thanks for the pointer! I've noted this in #21559.
