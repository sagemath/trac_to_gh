`src/bin` contains some stuff that is not an executable script, such as `sage-README-osx.txt`.
It should be moved elsewhere; and also be installed in a place other than `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.

See also:
- #21569: Install `src/bin/*` scripts via `setup.py` (`scripts`, `console_scripts`)
- #21559: Move sage-the-distribution scripts from src/bin to build/bin
