Keywords: Kazhdan-Lusztig R-polynomial

KL_R_tilde polynomial is equivalent to KL_R polynomial. It has a combinatorial interpretation by the theory of reflection ordering. I think a KL_R_tilde method in class Kazhdan_Lusztig polynomial class may lead some convenience.

One can have more information by reading:

Hi,
    I should have kept the code style in mind. Thanks for your comment.
    
    Best wishes.
