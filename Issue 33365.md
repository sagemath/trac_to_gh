This tickets aims to remove some element classes from the global namespace. Example:

```
sage: PowerSeries?
Docstring:
   A power series. Base class of univariate and multivariate power
   series. The following methods are available with both types of
   objects.
Init docstring:
   Initialize a power series. Not for public use. It gets called by
   the "PowerSeries_poly" and "MPowerSeries" constructors.
[...]

That test from #23928 is not right. The parent is wrong for instance. I think we should correct it by

```diff
-             sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, implementation='pari')
-             sage: f = LaurentSeries(R, x).add_bigoh(7)
+             sage: R.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ, implementation='pari')
+             sage: f = x.add_bigoh(7)
              sage: f(x)
```

Everything else LGTM.
