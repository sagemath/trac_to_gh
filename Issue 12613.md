We need to update the Sage FAQ (`SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/faq/faq-usage.rst`) to take into account #12369 and #12112.  For example, we should remove the reference to m4 and gfortran. We should also add a reference to Sage building its own gcc if necessary.

There is already a patch at #12369 to change the installation guide.

Related is also #12782, which would make a C++ compiler no longer needed for Sage.
