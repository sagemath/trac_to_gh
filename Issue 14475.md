The following behaviour has been reported on [ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1610/):


```
sage: hurwitz_zeta(-3,1,32)
  File "<string>", line 0
    
    ^
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
```


Note that the documentation allows the first two arguments of the to ``hurwitz_zeta()`` function be real numbers. I put it to the "combinatorics" component since this function is defined in ``/sage/combinat/combinat.py``
