# Issue 14475: hurwitz_zeta() function does not handles negative inputs correctly

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tmonteil

Original creation time: 2013-06-03 15:34:03

Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: maxima

The following behaviour has been reported on [ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1610/):


```
sage: hurwitz_zeta(-3,1,32)
  File "<string>", line 0
    
    ^
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
```


Note that the documentation allows the first two arguments of the to ``hurwitz_zeta()`` function be real numbers. I put it to the "combinatorics" component since this function is defined in ``/sage/combinat/combinat.py``

#15095 implements a symbolic version of `hurwitz_zeta`, with numeric evaluation handled by mpmath instead of Maxima. When that's merged this patch would be unnecessary. Frédéric, maybe you can help with reviewing #15095?

Should this be closed as a duplicate then ?

Ok, now that #15095 is done, I propose to close this as duplicate.

Nathann, Eviatar or Jeroen, if you agree, please set this to positive review.
