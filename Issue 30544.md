In the current implementation of connections, it is not possible to take the covariant derivative along a map. But this is especially useful when the maps are curves, most prominently geodesics.

Since this construction is simply taking the pull-back of a connection along a map in terms of bundles, I'd suggest to utilize the implementation for general vector bundles, which already support the desired action (see #30209). The covariant derivative along a curve would then correspond to the pull-back connection on the corresponding pulled-back vectorfield module. Different approaches are most welcome.
