why not adding spaces around the `+` here ?

```
+            self._recurrents = [SandpileConfig(self, [1]*(n-1))] + [SandpileConfig(self, one[:i]+[0]+one[i:]) for i in range(n - 1)]
```


For this part

```diff
     from sage.combinat.combination import Combinations
     g = Graph()
     g.add_vertices([tuple(i) for i in p])
-    for u,v in Combinations(g.vertices(), 2):
+    for u, v in Combinations(g.vertices(), 2):
```

It could be better to do:

```diff
-     from sage.combinat.combination import Combinations
+     from itertools import combinations
      g = Graph()
-     g.add_vertices([tuple(i) for i in p])
-     for u,v in Combinations(g.vertices(), 2):
+     g.add_vertices(tuple(i) for i in p)
+     for u, v in combinations(g, 2):
```
