# Issue 20822: Change WithRealizations._an_element_ to use a_realization

As noticed on #21054, there is a discrepancy between `one` and `_an_element_` for parents that are in the category `*.WithRealizations`, in that the former uses `a_realization`, whereas the latter uses `realizations()[0]`. While on #21054, this did uncover an error, this cases problems with the test suite when a realization does not get created before `an_element` gets called (which I have noticed before).

Thus, I propose to have `_an_element_` use `a_realization()`, which is a required implementation and `_an_element_` will also have consistent output no matter which basis is created first.

There are two failing doc-tests in `sage/combinat/kazhdan_lusztig` when the optional coxeter3 package is installed.

```
1 item had failures:
   2 of   8 in sage.combinat.kazhdan_lusztig.KazhdanLusztigPolynomial
    [26 tests, 2 failures, 2.76 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t kazhdan_lusztig.py  # 2 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

and more failures in `sage/libs/coxeter3/`.

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t coxeter3/coxeter.pyx  # 256 doctests failed
sage -t coxeter3/coxeter_group.py  # 120 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Not entirely sure what the policy is on doc-tests in optional packages...

Are these are all fixed by #21077?

Except for rebasing and doctests this looks good to me. I'll handle the rebasing shortly and put a positive review.
