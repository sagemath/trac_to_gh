After #15185, the following changes are made in this ticket:

- The `gen` class currently contains duplicates of various methods of
`PariInstance` (such as `new_gen`) for no obvious reason.  These methods
will be deleted.

- Remove obsolete code (e.g. `add_unsafe`, which currently is not used,
and probably never should be).

This branch only deletes obsolete stuff and makes the minimal changes necessary to keep everything working.  I think further (non-trivial) changes should probably wait until a different ticket.

I think you should also remove the global variable `prec` from `gen.pyx` and replace `prec` by calls to `prec_bits_to_words()` (without argument).
