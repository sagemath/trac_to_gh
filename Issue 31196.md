sage: E.real_components()

The number of real components is 1 or 2 when the discriminant is negaive or positive respectively.  The current code does a lot of unneceesary work:

```
       invs = self.short_weierstrass_model().ainvs()
        x = rings.polygen(self.base_ring())
        f = x**3 + invs[3]*x + invs[4]
        if f.discriminant() > 0:
            return 2
        else:
            return 1
```

It is unnecessary to compute a short Weierstrass model, take its coefficients, construct a polynomial, and compute its discriminant, since `E.discriminant()` has the same sign as the discriminant computed here.

As well as fixing this I'll add a `real_components()` method for elliptic curves over number fields, which will take as a parameter a real embedding of the base field.
