# Issue 11988: Fix inconsistent comparison of Python and Sage floats with "nan".

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12160

Original creator: SimonKing

Original creation time: 2011-12-15 21:31:50

Assignee: AlexGhitza

Keywords: nan float comparison

We have

```
sage: float(1.1) < float('nan')
False
sage: 1.1 < float('nan')
True
```


The topic is related with #12149, but the code is independent.
