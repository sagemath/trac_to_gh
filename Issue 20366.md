Why `I.sort(); print I` and not `I.sort(); I`? Same with for example `print N[len(dir):]`.

You have usually changed continuation line markers, but not in `print(kwds)` nor in `print(af.fix_to_pos())`.

Shouldn't `print(" ".join(str(i) for i in f))` be `print("".join(str(i) for i in f))`? Same in `src/sage/misc/misc.py`.

I will now compile and test.

The one in `misc/nested_class.pyx`. But from `sageinspect.py` I got "RuntimeError: unable to start r". I am quite sure that your two line change works, but anyways would be nice to have someone else to check those. Might be that I won't do that for following three days.
