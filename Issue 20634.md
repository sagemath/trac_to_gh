Was this reported before?

Might as well fix it as part of this ticket too while I'm fixing bugs.

It looks like the `ZipFile` class is inconsistent with the `TarFile` class, where `open` is a classmethod.  I think I knew that but forgot this time.

I didn't see a report; but zip files did work in the past. Perhaps introduced in #20721? I didn't catch it at this time.
