# Issue 32622: Wrong display from type() with %display latex

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32859

Original creator: egourgoulhon

Original creation time: 2021-11-12 12:23:06

CC:  klee

Keywords: jupyter display latex

In Sage 9.4 and 9.5.beta5, the following cell of a Jupyter notebook

```
%display latex
type(x)
```

results in 

```
\[\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}\verb||\]
```

instead of 

```
<𝚌𝚕𝚊𝚜𝚜'𝚜𝚊𝚐𝚎.𝚜𝚢𝚖𝚋𝚘𝚕𝚒𝚌.𝚎𝚡𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗.𝙴𝚡𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗'>
```

Everything is OK with Sage <= 9.3.

But I merged the branch of #32208 to the present branch, in order to also fix pdf export problem of the example

```
%display latex
type(x)
```

of this ticket.

Thank you very much for the prompt fix! I am setting #32208 as a dependency because of comment:6 and I am going to test both tickets.

As for #32208, I've tested the fix with these notebooks: [test_display_latex](https://nbviewer.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Notebooks/test_display_latex.ipynb), [SM_Kerr_surfaces](https://nbviewer.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_Kerr_surfaces.ipynb) and [SM_spheres_S2](https://nbviewer.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_sphere_S2.ipynb). Everything seems OK. Thank you very much.

This is an off-topic, but your notebooks show latex expressions flush left. As far as I know, latex expressions are displayed centered by default. I don't know how you did it. Anyway, I think latex expressions should be shown flush left by default. What do you think?

I did nothing special. Latex expressions have always been flushed left on my notebooks since the introduction of Jupyter in Sage. Are they centered on your computer? The only thing I've noticed is that when run on CoCalc, the very same notebook has latex expression centered, see e.g. this [example](https://cocalc.com/share/public_paths/6850015be0320058cadba1ce63e7a3eedf4eef89).
>Anyway, I think latex expressions should be shown flush left by default. What do you think?
I don't have any strong opinion on that, but I agree with you: flush left is usually what we have in published articles.

Yes. It is mysterious to me since I know that latex expressions are centered because they are enclosed by `\[...\]`.

Okay. Thank you.

This is strange indeed... Maybe it's a matter of OS? What is yours? Mine is Ubuntu 20.04. I've always had flushed left expressions on all the computers I've used (all running various versions of Ubuntu). It could also be related to the locale (fr_FR in my case). The centered rendering on CoCalc does not surprise me further because their Jupyter is somehow customized.

I guess we have to wait for 9.5.beta7 to solve that one.

Mine is Mac OS.

Possibly. I don't know. If you open the notebook in editor (by right-clicking it), then you can see the raw data. Mine shows

```
    {
     "data": {
      "text/html": [
       "<html>\\[\\newcommand{\\Bold}[1]{\\mathbf{#1}}\\verb|&lt;class|\\verb| |\\verb|'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>|\\]</html>"
      ],
      "text/latex": [
       "$$\\newcommand{\\Bold}[1]{\\mathbf{#1}}\\verb|<class|\\verb| |\\verb|'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>|$$"
      ],
      "text/plain": [
       "<class 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>"
      ]
     }
```

for `type(x)` cell. You see `\\[` and `$$`. How about yours?


---

Comment by klee created at 2021-11-15 01:22:12

I directly checked your notebooks. They are the same, the same `\\[` and `$$`.

I downloaded your notebook to open it in my jupyterlab. Now latex expressions are centered. In nbviewer, they are rendered by mathjax 2.7.1. My jupyterlab uses mathjax 2.7.9. It might be a bug of mathjax 2.7.1...

My Jupyter notebook uses Mathjax 2.7.9 as well. However, if I right-click on a displayed expression to open the Mathjax contextual menu and choose `Math Settings -> Math Redender`, I see that `HTML-CSS` is selected; if I select `MathML` instead, I get a warning:

```
Your browser's native MathML does not implement all the features used by MathJax, 
so some expressions may not render properly.
```

but then all the formulas in the notebook become centered! Moreover, the Rubik's cube is then correctly displayed. 

The above is for Firefox (my default browser). If I do the same thing with Chrome (where initially all LaTeX expressions are left-flushed as well), I got the same warning when switching from `HTML-CSS` to `MathML`, but then, instead of LaTeX rendering, the literal code is displayed,
e.g. 

```
\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}\sin\left(x^{2}\right)
```

for the first formula.

I experience all the same except that with HTML-CSS renderer, latex expressions are still centered.

With Firefox on my mac, all the same (centered displays).

Another data point: when running Jupyterlab on my computer (via `sage -n jupyterlab`), latex expressions are centered. So there is a difference of behavior between the Jupyter notebook and Jupyterlab.

Right. Me too. So it is a difference between jupyter notebook and jupyterlab!

Another thing: you might have noticed on Cell [7] of the notebook [test_display_latex](https://nbviewer.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Notebooks/test_display_latex.ipynb) that in `%display latex` mode, `matplotlib.pyplot.show()` displays `Figure(432x288)` instead of the actual figure. This issue certainly does not pertain to the current ticket. Is there already a ticket for it?

#32882 is the new ticket for it.

Regarding the above discussion about centered math formulas, a relevant [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/59775/display-latex-makes-output-centered-in-exported-tex-file/) has been posted recently, complaining about centered outputs in LaTeX exports of Jupyter notebooks.  Apparently `\begin{math}...\end{math}` has been replaced by `$$...$$` somewhere between Sage 9.3 and 9.4.

I don't know how that happened. But it is likely that the behavior was introduced by one of the tickets that I authored.  

Anyway that "centered" behavior is consistent with what we see in the jupyterlab. So the question is what behavior we want.

Exactly. As I said before (comment:13), I am kind of neutral on that.

I prefer flush left. Well, I think users would be divided. A solution would be to introduce an option to control the behavior.

This is now implemented in #32942. Please review.
