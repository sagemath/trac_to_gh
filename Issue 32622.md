CC:  @kwankyu

Keywords: jupyter display latex

In Sage 9.4 and 9.5.beta5, the following cell of a Jupyter notebook

```
%display latex
type(x)
```

results in 

```
\[\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}\verb||\]
```

instead of 

```
<𝚌𝚕𝚊𝚜𝚜'𝚜𝚊𝚐𝚎.𝚜𝚢𝚖𝚋𝚘𝚕𝚒𝚌.𝚎𝚡𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗.𝙴𝚡𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗'>
```

Everything is OK with Sage <= 9.3.

Possibly. I don't know. If you open the notebook in editor (by right-clicking it), then you can see the raw data. Mine shows

```
