CC:  @vbraun

Sometimes a "bad exit 2" happens on ppc64le due to this:

```c
/* src/saveload.c:127 */
libGAP_UInt1 libGAP_LOAD_BYTE_BUF( void )
{
  libGAP_Int ret;
  ret = read(libGAP_syBuf[libGAP_LoadFile].fp, libGAP_LoadBuffer, 100000);
  if (ret <= 0)
    { 
      libGAP_Pr(libGAP_LoadByteErrorMessage, 0L, 0L );
      libGAP_SyExit(2);  /* <------------------------- EXIT HERE */
    }
  libGAP_LBEnd = libGAP_LoadBuffer + ret;
  libGAP_LBPointer = libGAP_LoadBuffer;
  return *libGAP_LBPointer++;
}
```
(I know it's this call to `libGAP_SyExit()` because I changed the exit codes to debug this)

This happens for example like this:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 92.8 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py
    Bad exit: 2
**********************************************************************

I regularly get `Bad exit: 2` (in different GAP-related doctests) on Intel Haswells as well when running `ptestlong`; they pass when rerun.  And, not too surprising, by the way independent of the GCC version (4.8.5, 4.9.4, 5.4.0, 6.2.0).
