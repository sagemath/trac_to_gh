Keywords: notebook jupyter

A system Jupyter installation where Sage specific files have been symlinked as discussed [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/hRR5rpv1u7U) recently ceased to be able to use the R kernel.

Relevant lines seen in console :

```

[I 14:47:25.113 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels

[ etc... a dozen times ]
```


The `restarting` loop stops when an error messagebox appears and I select not to restart...

Workaround :

```
charpent@SAP5057241:~$ SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/sage jupyter notebook
[I 14:49:04.818 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/charpent
[I 14:49:04.818 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels

[I 14:49:04.818 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).

[I 14:49:10.499 NotebookApp] Creating new notebook in 
[I 14:49:11.770 NotebookApp] Kernel started: 808ec2be-d2ae-40c5-a518-3747ea1c36dd
Warning: overwriting SAGE_ROOT environment variable:
Old SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/sage
New SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/sage-7

```


Note that on my system, `/usr/local/sage` is a symlink to `/usr/local/sage-7`.

This is but a minor annoyance inmy case, but might be a symptom ome something more serious, possibly hampering other uses.
