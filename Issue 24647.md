Hi Travis, I was just looking to the ticket, at the same time as you apparently! The change in the doctest of `src/sage/manifold/differentiable/metric.py` (point 3 in the ticket description) is not desirable: it results from a forced conversion of SymPy to `SR` due to the change in `src/sage/tensor/modules/comp.py` (point 2). Jeroen, the line 

```
return matrix(SR, resu)
```
forces the conversion of elements of the list `resu` to `SR` elements, while they can actually belong to something else, like SymPy. Is there a good reason for this? Do we have now to explicitly specify the ring as the first argument of `matrix`? Since SymPy elements do not constitute a ring in Sage, one cannot construct a matrix for them. I plan to improve this in the short future, by implementing a ring of SymPy coordinate functions. But for the time being, I would say it is preferable to return a list of SymPy elements instead of a  matrix of `SR` elements.

I just did that to be consistent with the documentation. The documentation never said "return a matrix, except when using the SymPy backend". I did make an exception for the `str` formatter, because that was documented (not in this method but elsewhere).

No, that won't be required. But again, it's good for consistency that you always get the same kind of object back (a symbolic matrix).

> I would say it is preferable to return a list of SymPy elements instead of a  matrix of `SR` elements.


That is fine for me, but then SymPy elements should *always* return a list. The main thing that I do not like about the current code is this `try`/`except` block:

```python
            try:
                for i in range(self._dim):
                    for j in range(self._dim):
                        a = resu[i][j]
                        if hasattr(a, '_express'):
                            resu[i][j] = a.expr()
                resu = matrix(resu)  # for a nicer output
            except TypeError:
                pass
```
With this code, you really have no idea whether a matrix or a list will be returned. And if it's a matrix, you don't know over which base ring.

Travis, what do you think?

I agree, this piece of code was not very good.

            from sage.structure.element import parent

            if parent(resu[0][0]) in Rings():

In this way, there is no special treatment for strings or whatever else that is not a ring, since the test `if parent(resu[0][0]) in Rings()` will return false in this case.

What if the different elements have different parents? Is there a guarantee that the parent of `resu[0][0]` is the same as the parent of `resu[0][1]`? So `matrix(resu)` will auto-detect the correct parent (using the coercion model) and that looks better.

Of course the same argument could be made for the `isinstance(resu[0][0], Element)` check. But it seems less likely to mix Elements and non-Elements than to mix different parents.

Actually, with the latest version, it works with SymPy, i.e. it does generate a matrix, the elements of which are chart functions, which are displayed as SymPy objects when SymPy is used as the symbolic engine (see the matrix containing `x**2` and `y**2` instead of `x^2` and `y^2` in the doctest in `metric.py`).
The `Rings` check is then for other possible cases, not involving chart functions (I don't have any precise use case at the moment, except for the `str` output formatter used as illustration in the doctests). SymPy was a problem in the previous version of the code, where the matrix construction was attempted directly at the level of symbolic representations, either `SR` or SymPy. Now the matrix construction is at the (higher) level of chart functions, and, thanks to you IIRC ;-), chart functions now forms a ring, so that the matrix construction always succeeds.

OK.

A priori, all elements of `resu` should have the same parent: this is guaranted if no  output formatter is used: the parent is nothing but the ring on which the `Components` object is constructed. If some output formatter is used, it is likely that its output is of a fixed type, hence giving rise to the same parent (in the extended sense, i.e. the parent default to the Python type if the object has no Sage Parent), like for instance the `str` output formatter. My concern with the `Element` check is that it does not guarantee that the parent is a ring. If it is not, then the matrix construction will fail.

I didn't know that, but you are right. If you ask me, that's a silly artificial restriction.

In that case, maybe Eric's code is fine. Travis, what do you think?

Yes, I think it's pretty safe to leave the code in the current state.
