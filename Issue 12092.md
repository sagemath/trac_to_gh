Three years ago Alex Ghitza introduced a patch in #5102 (that wstein positively reviewed) that said:

```
        # this is a temporary fix due to a change in the
        # polynomial constructor over finite fields; this
        # is a notable speed regression, to be fixed soon.
        return a0fac*R(eisenstein_series_poly(k, prec).list(), prec=prec, check=True)
```

in the file `modular/modform/eis_series.py`.  At the time, no ticket was opened, and now it's over three years later and this has not "been fixed soon".  It should be!

I noticed this when working on the closely related #11375.
