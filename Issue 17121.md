CC:  @vbraun

The `install` scripts checks whether `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc` exists and if so will at some point trigger the build of Sage's GCC.
This cannot be prevented by using `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17358

Do you mean removing only the `-f "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc"` of the test?
(I think the `touch` part can also be removed)

If the user or Sage decided to install Sage's GCC, there should be some files in `$SAGE_INST`, and in that case we still need to put the necessary stuff into the `Makefile` so that GCC will get rebuilt if its dependencies were.

I agree with that.
So the only problem left is what if MPIR or another GCC dependency gets updated to a binary incompatible version (or let's say the symlinks ends up with different names)?
