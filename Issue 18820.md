#13336 introduced a fix to let `farey_symbol` compile on cygwin. This fix was inadvertedly removed in #18853. We add the fix again.

Well if you don't document it in the code it will be replaced again by the header by someone else. So I think so you should add a comment that we have to declare it explicitly rather than including the header because it breaks on cygwin otherwise.
