# Issue 30133: add Jupyter extension skip-traceback to hide stack traces

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30370

Keywords: jupyter

In order to improve the user experience, we should consider installing the Jupyter extension `skip-traceback` which hides error tracebacks, displaying instead a summary of the error name and type. Clicking the summary displays the whole traceback:

Like in the SageNB notebook... That's one of the things I miss about it!
