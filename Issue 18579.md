Hi,

I'm having trouble upgrading from Sage-6.4 to Sage-6.7 on my Macbook Pro. The installation aborts at the libgd-2.1.1.p0 stage with the following error:

```
libtool: compile:  gcc -std=gnu99 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I/Applications/Sage-6.2.app/Contents/Resources/sage/local/include/libpng12 -I/Users/buildbot/build/sage/bsd-1/sage_git/build/local/include/freetype2 -g -fvisibility=hidden -MT gdft.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/gdft.Tpo -c gdft.c  -fno-common -DPIC -o .libs/gdft.o
gdft.c:153:22: fatal error: ft2build.h: No such file or directory
 #include <ft2build.h>
                      ^
compilation terminated.
make[5]: *** [gdft.lo] Error 1
make[4]: *** [all] Error 2
make[3]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
Error building gd.
```


The *ft2build.h* file is in the local/include/freetype2 subdirectory.
I think the problem is in the *-I/Users/buildbot/build/sage/bsd-1/sage_git/build/local/include/freetype2* part, which seems incorrectly copy-pasted from someone else's computer (I don't have the *buildbot* directory on my computer!). I'm too much of a newbie to fiddle with it, so could someone tell me what to do? I tried to do

```
make -I/Applications/Sage-6.2.app/Contents/Resources/sage/local/include/freetype2 start
```

from the root directory, but that failed too.

Here is the link to the log file if it helps: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/hal4fp0p3rb2hrw/libgd-2.1.1.p0?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hal4fp0p3rb2hrw/libgd-2.1.1.p0?dl=0)

Thanks for your help.

PS: Sage-6.7 installed perfectly well on my linux desktop. I'm surprised that other people are not having this issue.

> I'm having trouble upgrading from Sage-6.4 to Sage-6.7 on my Macbook Pro.
Could you please explain more in detail what you mean with this? Which commands did you execute?

There are two things you could try:

1. Force `sage-location`:

```
$ ./sage --python local/bin/sage-location
$ make
```


2. If that doesn't work, a more drastic solution:

```
$ rm -rf local/var/lib/sage/installed/
$ make
```

This will force rebuilding of every package. With some luck, it will solve your problem.

That has been solved for a long time, but that is not what I meant. The destination directory in Conda and the Hashdist proposal is not tied to the build directory.

I am afraid that you are then doing something different from what you *think* you are doing.

The path you are seeing refers to the OS X buildbot. The only way how that can appear in your install is if you downloaded a binary build of Sage. It's impossible for that path to appear if you're building from the git sources.

I am sorry, but I don't see how that is possible. This is exactly what I did in this order.

```
$ git fetch origin
$ git reset --hard master    
$ git clean -d -f            
$ git checkout master        
$ git pull --ff-only

*make distclean* followed by *make start* did the trick. Thanks everyone. How do I mark that this ticket is solved?

Oops! Question-mark help does not work within *sage* anymore. Could you help me fix this? I find this feature extremely useful. Thanks. If you like, I can open this as a separate ticket. *search_src()* works properly though.
