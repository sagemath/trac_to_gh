# Issue 313: Slideshow doesn't update when cell deleted.

Slideshow doesn't update when first cell deleted. If the first cell is deleted then the second cell should become the first and the slideshow should show that.

There is too a slideshow mode.  Select Action-->One Cell Mode.

Somehow the number for the open tickets were off, so I finally found this assigned to the wrong milestone. More to 3.0.1 again ;)

Cheers,
