I fixed this issue and addressed at the same time #23234.

I've extended the set of possible values allowed for the keyword `show_prec`: it can now either `none` (no precision is printed), `bigoh` or `dots`. A boolean is still possible: `False` always means `none` while `True` means `bigoh` or `dots` depending on the printing mode.
