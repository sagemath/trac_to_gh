Assignee: bhutz

Keywords: height, canonical, projective, dynamics

This patch implements height functionality from the initial dynamics functionality problems proposed at the 2012 ICERM semester in Complex and Arithmetic dynamics.

Builds on Trac #13130 and Trac #14217

Implements height functionality:

* height of points
* height of morphisms
* local green's functions
* canonical heights

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14218

This actually shows a bigger problem: it shows that some computations depend on machine floats and therefore are done only to 53 bits precision. In the code I see:

```
RealField(prec)(log(m))
```

this should be

```
RealField(prec)(m).log()
```

(the best solution to avoid this is simply removing `from math import log`)

Also, I recommend you to write *once*

```
R = RealField(prec)
```

and then use `R(a)` every where.

Also, comparisons to `None` should be done with `is`: `a is None` or `a is not None`.

Hello,

I have added a patch which mainly cleans the doc a little bit.

for the patchbot:

apply trac_14218_heights.patch trac_14218_remove_imports.patch trac_14218_addon1.patch

By the way, did you know that you could run your own patchbot on your own tickets instead of waiting for the bot of someone else ?
