# Issue 10745: by default build HTML doc without PDF links

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10811

Original creator: mvngu

Original creation time: 2011-02-21 09:33:52

Assignee: mvngu

The `Makefile` currently (Sage 4.6.2.rc0) builds the HTML document with links to the PDF version. But if only the HTML document is built, then the generated links would be broken links. This can be fixed by getting `Makefile` to by default build the HTML documentation without linking to the PDF version. Also, the `Makefile` should contain instructions on how to build both the HTML and PDF versions and have the HTML version link to the PDF version.

See this [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/04c3d373d5451a96) thread for background information.

Only apply `Makefile`; i.e. replace the current `Makefile` with the updated `Makefile` on this ticket. The file `Makefile.diff` serves only to show the proposed changes.

Hmm, but who reads Makefiles for documentation?  Maybe adding something elsewhere in the documentation to specifically mention this - and the (apparently?) change in default behavior - would make it more effective.

Done. See the additional patch.

sage-4.7.rc2 built with this ticket's Makefile correctly causes HTML documentation to be built without PDF links. Documentation patch looks good.  Positive review.

Please add a proper hg changeset for the Makefile instead of a simple diff.
