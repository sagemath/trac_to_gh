The `Makefile` currently (Sage 4.6.2.rc0) builds the HTML document with links to the PDF version. But if only the HTML document is built, then the generated links would be broken links. This can be fixed by getting `Makefile` to by default build the HTML documentation without linking to the PDF version. Also, the `Makefile` should contain instructions on how to build both the HTML and PDF versions and have the HTML version link to the PDF version.

See this [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/04c3d373d5451a96) thread for background information.

Hmm, but who reads Makefiles for documentation?  Maybe adding something elsewhere in the documentation to specifically mention this - and the (apparently?) change in default behavior - would make it more effective.
