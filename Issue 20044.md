# Issue 20044: fix flintxx development

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20281

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2016-03-24 14:24:13

Current flint-2.5.2 is from last year and lacks a recent fix from git master addressing compile errors of flintxx headers. This ticket patches Sage's flint to enable Pynac development with flintxx, the C++ API of flint.

I personally don't think the fix you submitted upstream is any good. You are probably configuring with `-I${some_prefix}/flint/flintxx` when you should use `-I${some_prefix}/flint -I${some_prefix}/flint/flintxx`. In fact it would be better, I think, to only have `${some_prefx}/flint` and have the `flintxx` headers prefixed with `flintxx`.

Possibly, depending on your includes it should have been `#include "flint/flint.h"` rather than `#include "../flint.h"`. That fells more correct to me.

It is a complete mystery to me how you get the idea that I submitted anything upstream. I merely reported the issue at https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/issues/217. Consequently your remarks should be added there.

Right I saw "reported by Ralph Stephan and fixed by ..." and I have conflated things a little bit. I guess I thought you worked together. But right it is just that I don't think it is a good solution in my opinion.
