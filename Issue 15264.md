From google spreadsheet which no one reads `X-(`

It happens that an algebraic number minus itself `(b-b)` is not printed as 0, but something like `0.?e-18`. Usually it is not a big problem, because `b - b == 0` evaluates to `True`. But interestingly `floor(b-b)` is sometimes 0, sometimes a symbolic expression, so weird things can happen.


```

I am not really familiar with the implementation or concepts involved in the `Algebraic Reals`. Anyone familiar with the concepts is free to review this ticket (efficiency of implementation, etc).

I can confirm, however, that the patch works very well.

If you are referring to my statement in comment:3, then let me clarify that I definitely did not review this ticket. The patch looked good to me and it worked well for me. But I am unfamiliar with the `AA` code, so I did not perform a full review.

If the patch looks ok to you, then please feel free to set it to positive review.
