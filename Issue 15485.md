# Issue 15485: Some documentation errata in numerical module

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: equaeghe

Original creation time: 2014-01-24 14:42:34

There are some errata (small, usually formatting) mistakes in the documentation of the numerical formula. The linked branch fixes them. (Or at least the ones I spotted.)

The space before the -1 was meant to align it with the values above, but it does not matter. Thanks for this fix `:-)`

Replying to [comment:3 ncohen]:

FYI: that was not a source-code cosmetic change, it broke the RST parsing, the content in a list needs to be aligned, it doesn't care whether that content is positive or negative, or even a number.

You're welcome. (Thank *you* for your work on the whole numerical module.)

Done
