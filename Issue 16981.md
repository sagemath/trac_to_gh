Keywords: arb, Acb, complex intervals

As a follow-up to #17194, where the `arb` type of the Arb library has been wrapped, this wraps the `acb` type for complex balls.

As in #17194, the bindings are very minimal, just to have the type and conversions. Again, the precision is stored in `Acb` directly as this does not yet live in sage's coercion world and therefore having a parent seems to be overkill for now.

Hello,

1. In the constructor

```
super(ComplexBall, self).__init__(parent)
```

  is much slower than

```
Element.__init__(self, parent)
```


2. Do you really need to make a subtraction to check if two complex balls are different?!

3. Why did you changed the convention for equality? We have

```
sage: a = RIF(1,2)
sage: a == a
False
```

See #17194 (and #17186) for the rationale.

As for this ticket, I'd like to suggest marking the whole module as experimental (cf. `sage.misc.deprecated`) until the bindings are a bit less minimal, in order to be able to make backward-incompatible changes without deprecation while extending them.

I am fine with the rationale to be changed but I just want them to be the same for interval field and ball field.

Hi Vincent, Hi Marc,

thanks for pointing this out, `!=` is now the negation of `overlaps`.

Replying to [comment:15 mmezzarobba]:

good point, done.

Replying to [comment:16 vdelecroix]:
> I am fine with the rationale to be changed but I just want them to be the same for interval field and ball field.

I'd also prefer to have the interval field with this behaviour (`a is b => a == b`) but how should that be done?
Won't it need a deprecation and possibly break lots of code?

The current status is that `RealIntervalField` and `RealBallField` (intentionally) differ in their behaviour.

IMHO changing RIF is outside the scope of this ticket.
