Homebrew is the most popular "missing package manager" for macOS, and I really do not understand why you are sceptical about. Sage on x86_64 Homebrew mostly works, with many, many packages used rather than built from source. (Besides, do you have any idea how much effort went into this, supporting Sage using Homebrew packages? No, well, you many be "sceptical" about it, but it does work.)

Macports doesn't work with Sage, and Fink is mostly dead, IMHO

Homebrew surely does have ready Apple M1 GMP, cf. 
https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gmp#default

Maintaining the Sage status quo - porting patches from Hombrew back to Sage, etc, it's such a waste of time if you ask me.

I played with creating Homebrew formulae a while ago, see https://github.com/sagemath/homebrew-science/commits/master

It's not that hard - and in fact e.g. arb and flint made it into mainline Homebrew since I touched this last time. It's more annoying that we sometimes need a variation of what's in Homebrew, e.g. it ships single-threaded Pari, but we need multi-threaded (as that's what giac requires).

no, no Rosetta, just pure, unfiltered, Homebrew.

Wish I hadn't destroyed my working install :( but I think I have a few old binaries I can use if under duress.  That's why I waited for the semester to finish!

----

I'll post on devel if I achieve anything interesting.  One note in prereqs: With respect to BLAS (mentioned in one of the threads) I get

```
==> Pouring openblas--0.3.15_1.big_sur.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
openblas is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides BLAS in Accelerate.framework.

For compilers to find openblas you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openblas/include"

For pkg-config to find openblas you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig"

==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/openblas/0.3.15_1: 23 files, 120MB
```

so hopefully accelerate will continue to work here for Sage as an option.

yes. They have a setup for this now (IIRC they use /opt/local for native M1, and /usr/local for Rosetta)

it's not an option if you want to use more external Homebrew packages, which depend on (open)blas.
Anyhow, sourcing `.homebrew-build-env` should take care of setting everything, including Homebrew's OpenBLAS,
to be used by Sage.

> We may also need to add `openjpeg` to the list [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#macos-recommended-installation).

I see no need for this. `openjpeg` is an optional dep of Pillow, and thus a problem may arise from a broken install of openjpeg - or no problem arises if `openjpeg` is not installed. But it's not Sage's job to do quality control of every package on a user box...

Just in case, things I think can be taken into account (besides #33191 and #33195):
1. Install everything `./configure` (or `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url`) recommends with `brew install [...]`.
   * Be aware of the 2 versions of `homebrew`: the new `arm64` should be used.
   * In particular, to install `polymake` do
   {{{
   cd /usr/local
   sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib lib
   brew install apaffenholz/polymake/polymake
   }}}
   (see https://github.com/apaffenholz/homebrew-polymake/issues/3)
   * Do not forget `source .homebrew-build-env` afterwards.
2. Before `make`, do:
   {{{
   eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl`@`3/bin:$PATH"
   export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl`@`3/lib -L/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib"
   export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl`@`3/include -I/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/include"
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl`@`3/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig"
   }}}
   (recommended by `brew`, but can be overlooked; perhaps to be put in `.homebrew-build-env`?)
3. `export MAKE="make -j16"` works fine on Apple M1 (all 8 cores at 100% most of the time).
