Does GitHub Actions provide that kind of machines for CI?

gFortran is now working natively on Apple Silicon (ARM64) `GNU Fortran (Homebrew GCC 10.2.0_2) 10.2.1 20201220`

as part of GCC.

`gcc: stable 10.2.0 (bottled), HEAD GNU compiler collection https://gcc.gnu.org/`

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2021-05-28 12:29:15

If I wanted to help test this, what could I do?  I tried upgrading my Sage yesterday (finally!) but ran into problems with pari and some other packages; then I did `make distclean` and now it won't even install gmp, wonderful lines

```
[gmp-6.2.0] configure: error: Oops, mp_limb_t is 64 bits, but the assembler code
[gmp-6.2.0] in this configuration expects 32 bits.
```

that look scary.  Anyway, I'd be quite interested in testing anything directly from source that does _not_ use Homebrew, which after all the warnings many years ago about Macports and Fink conflicts I'm skeptical of.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-05-28 14:37:01

Homebrew is the most popular "missing package manager" for macOS, and I really do not understand why you are sceptical about. Sage on x86_64 Homebrew mostly works, with many, many packages used rather than built from source. (Besides, do you have any idea how much effort went into this, supporting Sage using Homebrew packages? No, well, you many be "sceptical" about it, but it does work.)

Macports doesn't work with Sage, and Fink is mostly dead, IMHO

Homebrew surely does have ready Apple M1 GMP, cf. 
https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gmp#default

Maintaining the Sage status quo - porting patches from Hombrew back to Sage, etc, it's such a waste of time if you ask me.

I guess bad experiences in the past with the other "managers" we will not name again - and, separately, liking to maintain ability for Mac users to download source and just type `make`.  But I will give it a try.

----

However, as to the main topic of this ticket, is this simply "use Homebrew/Rosetta" or is there presumably some other testing I can do to help?

Just curious -- is there work underway to make sagemath itself a homebrew package, so one could do "brew install sagemath"?  That would be pretty awesome.


---

Comment by @DaveWitteMorris created at 2021-05-28 16:14:10

Making sage into a homebrew package is on the wishlist. (I don't think anyone is doing anything about it.) I think further discussion of this should go to #29395.

I played with creating Homebrew formulae a while ago, see https://github.com/sagemath/homebrew-science/commits/master

It's not that hard - and in fact e.g. arb and flint made it into mainline Homebrew since I touched this last time. It's more annoying that we sometimes need a variation of what's in Homebrew, e.g. it ships single-threaded Pari, but we need multi-threaded (as that's what giac requires).

no, no Rosetta, just pure, unfiltered, Homebrew.
(Rosetta is an x86_64 emulator, as you might recall)

Give it a try please, I'd like to know how far we are there.

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-05-28 17:12:55

by the way, this ticket says "need gfortran first" (for M1), but it's already there.
https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gcc (it's gcc/gfortran 11)

Exactly; so homebrew will be using ARM stuff natively in this case?
> Give it a try please, I'd like to know how far we are there.
Wish I hadn't destroyed my working install :( but I think I have a few old binaries I can use if under duress.  That's why I waited for the semester to finish!

----

I'll post on devel if I achieve anything interesting.  One note in prereqs: With respect to BLAS (mentioned in one of the threads) I get

```
==> Pouring openblas--0.3.15_1.big_sur.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
openblas is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides BLAS in Accelerate.framework.

For compilers to find openblas you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openblas/include"

For pkg-config to find openblas you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig"

==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/openblas/0.3.15_1: 23 files, 120MB
```

so hopefully accelerate will continue to work here for Sage as an option.

yes. They have a setup for this now (IIRC they use /opt/local for native M1, and /usr/local for Rosetta)

it's not an option if you want to use more external Homebrew packages, which depend on (open)blas.
Anyhow, sourcing `.homebrew-build-env` should take care of setting everything, including Homebrew's OpenBLAS,
to be used by Sage.

We may also need to add `openjpeg` to the list [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#macos-recommended-installation).

I see no need for this. `openjpeg` is an optional dep of Pillow, and thus a problem may arise from a broken install of openjpeg - or no problem arises if `openjpeg` is not installed. But it's not Sage's job to do quality control of every package on a user box...

Comment by culler created at 2021-08-10 21:28:59

While we have had a bit of trouble getting complete information, it appears that the current version of the [SageMath](SageMath) app (based on rc0) for macOS works fine in the Intel emulation mode on M1 macs.  This was not always the case, but we are now taking care to avoid AVX, AVX2 and BMI instructions unless they are enabled at runtime by the "fat" version of gmp.  This appears to eliminate the crashes that were seen before in emulation mode.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-12-09 10:16:39

Apparently our Openblas build fails on M1, see
https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/XwGF584P7EY/m/MsN6mfWkAQAJ


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-12-27 18:05:44

It would probably be a good idea if people who have access to M1 hardware test the current beta, as we are getting closer to the 9.5 release.


---

Comment by @johnalanwoods created at 2021-12-27 18:18:45

Keen to test. Any build instructions for M1/Pro/Max?

Or is the a binary?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-12-27 18:31:50

Follow the instructions for build from source in README.md, using homebrew; just mildly updated in #29784


---

Comment by @johnalanwoods created at 2021-12-28 08:41:18

`@`mkoeppe - apologies can’t seem to find the brew instructions. Do I just build from src with —HEAD?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-12-28 11:06:25

have homebrew installed, then

```
source .homebrew-build-env
./bootstrap
./configure
```

pay attention to last pages of output of two latter commands, install packages they recommend, in the latter case, 
rerun

```
./bootstrap && ./configure
```

then

```
make build
```

Do you mean sage `primesieve` and `primecount` rather than "system".

Build failure `libhomfly`

```

From top-level config.log:

```

configure:19779: $? = 0
configure:19819: result: yes

This appears to be another case of our `configure` forgetting to tell packages where the stuff is that it found.

I do not know if this can be related:

After
`sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib lib`
in `/usr/local` (see https://github.com/apaffenholz/homebrew-polymake/issues/3)
this works

`brew install apaffenholz/polymake/polymake`

(suggested by `./configure`).


---

Comment by @GMS103 created at 2022-01-17 04:44:43

I have restarted the whole process, with the fix #33191.

`iml` was still failing, so I have done

`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.2 make`

as indicated in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/6LldEeJu3ZA/m/BpNMpD-yAAAJ and there is no error about installing packages, but the building fails.  Logs attached as soon as I find how to do it.

Next it would be worth checking if #33194 (branch `u/mkoeppe/openblas__update_to_0_3_19`) fixes the build of `openblas` when `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url --without-system-openblas` is in use.

Great! So the issue with `ntl` from comment:51 didn't show up in this build.

`make` running.

No, everything went smoothly.

After

```
git fetch trac u/mkoeppe/openblas__update_to_0_3_19
git merge -m "Merge #33194" FETCH_HEAD
./bootstrap 
./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url --without-system-openblas
```

`make` gives an error for `openblas`:

```
[openblas-0.3.19]   make[6]: *** No rule to make target `../kernel/arm64/amin.S', needed by `samin_k.o'.  Stop.
```

This looks similar to https://trac.macports.org/ticket/61700; it sounds like we would have to configure openblas differently. We can probably get this from homebrew's build script. This won't make it into Sage 9.5.

Thanks again for testing!

And `make ptestlong` (after `make` with #33191 and #33195 but wihtout #33194) gives

Just in case, things I think can be taken into account (besides #33191 and #33195):
1. Install everything `./configure` (or `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url`) recommends with `brew install [...]`.
 * Be aware of the 2 versions of `homebrew`: the new `arm64` should be used.
 * In particular, to install `polymake` do
   {{{
   cd /usr/local
   sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib lib
   brew install apaffenholz/polymake/polymake
   }}}
   (see https://github.com/apaffenholz/homebrew-polymake/issues/3)
 * Do not forget `source .homebrew-build-env` afterwards.
2. Before `make`, do:
   {{{
   eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl`@`3/bin:$PATH"
   export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl`@`3/lib -L/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib"
   export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl`@`3/include -I/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/include"
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl`@`3/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig"
   }}}
   (recommended by `brew`, but can be overlooked; perhaps to be put in `.homebrew-build-env`?)
3. `export MAKE="make -j16"` works fine on Apple M1 (all 8 cores at 100% most of the time).

The `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` addition for `openssl` is already taken care of by `.homebrew-build-env`. I don't think we need the changes to the other variables

Thanks for writing this summary - it will be helpful for those who find their way here from https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.5#Sources

Maybe we can close this.

how about #31905 ?

> how about #31905 ?

I think we now agree that's not an issue. I don't know what to do with #30494, but maybe we don't need both this ticket and that one. So I propose closing this one and thinking about what to do with #30494 separately.
