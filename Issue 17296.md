Hello Jeroen,

1) Why moving "parent_c" and "have_same_parent_c"?

2) Instead of

```
cdef inline parent_c(x):
    if isinstance(x, Element):
        return (<Element>x)._parent
    elif hasattr(x, 'parent'):
        return x.parent()
    else:
        return type(x)
```

wouldn't it be faster to do

```
cdef inline parent_c(x):
    if isinstance(x, Element):
        return (<Element>x)._parent
    else:
        try:
            return x.parent()
        except AttributeError:
            return type(x)
```


3) In `element.pyx`, the "seealso" should be a "SEEALSO".

Vincent
