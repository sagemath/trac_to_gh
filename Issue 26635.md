Keywords: UniversalCyclotomicField

Reported by Ask Sage user Assombrance:

- [Ask Sage question 44623: Norm in UniversalCyclotomicField](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/44623)

It should be enough to implement `__abs__` for elements of the universal
cyclotomic field, computed as the square root of `z * z.conjugate()` or of
`z.real()**2 + z.imag()**2`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26872
