It should be enough to implement `__abs__` for elements of the universal
cyclotomic field, computed as the square root of `z * z.conjugate()` or of
`z.real()**2 + z.imag()**2`.

This will work well as a first implementation. If we need to optimize either of these operations later on, then we can do it then.

Oops. The method should have been called `__abs__` rather than `abs`.

Follow-up at #27201.
