This patch is working well for 2.2, but have you been able to test networkx 2.3 with Sagemath ?

Like the patchbot I'm getting:

```
    DeprecationWarning: G.fresh_copy is deprecated. Use G.__class__ instead
```

Great, so networkx is using its own deprecated API... this seems fixed in 2.3, for now let's avoid using networkx's reverse()
