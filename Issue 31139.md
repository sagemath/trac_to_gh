Just like a polytope can be written as the finite disjoint union of relative interiors of its faces, we can write the feasible set of (well-behaved...) nonlinear optimization problems as the finite disjoint union of differentiable manifolds of different dimensions. Their closures are manifolds with corners (#30080...), which together form a CW complex.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
