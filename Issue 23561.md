I suspect that we need to change `if M.solve(log = verbose) <= 1:` to `if M.solve(log = verbose) <= 1 + tol:`, where `tol = 0 if solver=='PPL' else 1e-6`. I don't like this solution, but I don't know what else we can do. 

I don't have access to a 32-bit machine and so cannot test.

I don’t  like this approach. Without explicit guarantees that these tolerances are correct, it is replacing correct algorithms with heuristics.

I don’t see how one can make the oracle (the inner LP) inexact, without potentially returning a very wrong answer. 

The oracle checks that there is no maximum weight matching of weight >1. Say, we let it error by epsilon, i.e we terminate with oracle returning 1+epsilon. Potentially, there could be K maximum matchings with this weight, if they are disjoint this means that the final error is K times epsilon, oops…

The oracle implementation here is naive, and bound to get very slow; it's integer LP without Edmonds' constraints,
instead of a "normal" LP over the matching polytope with Edmonds' constraints (aka blossom inequalities).
So this would need yet another oracle (as there are too exponentially many inequalities there), but well, it's polynomial time then.
The generated constraints can stay, so this should be fast.

I took a quick look at the function now. I would suggest the following changes:

1. Before adding a new constraint to the master problem, verify that `matching` is indeed a matching. In this way, the master problem will always be a correct relaxation, even if an inexact oracle is used.

2. When the numerical solver that is used for solving the separation problem does not find a matching of value greater than 1 + epsilon, you can switch to PPL - then, with a bit of luck, it can prove the bound <= 1.

3. It will make sense to have separate parameters for the solver used for the master problem and the one(s) used for the separation problem.

I tried the ideas from #comment:35. I have let some code for debugging as the code may loop forever when using `GLPK` for both master and separation problems. The patchbot will complain...

We should search for another method not relying on LP solvers, if any...
