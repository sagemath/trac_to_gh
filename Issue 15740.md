# Issue 15740: Fix formatting for symbolic summation algorithms

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15977

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2014-03-20 03:00:57

The formatting for the algorithm options for symbolic summation, e.g.
[here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/calculus/sage/calculus/calculus.html#sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_sum),
is wrong.

I haven't been able to actually try this because I've destroyed my Sage install somehow... but hopefully this will be good.

This looks good to me. I have taken the opportunity to correct a few links to trac using the `:trac:`1234`` syntax. If you agree with my changes, you can set this to positive review.

I like everything about your changes except the following.  (I had actually thought about doing this but figured I'd not want to cause merge issues and also save for another ticket - but hey, here you've done it!)

```
-            # verify that this operation does not modify the passed dictionary (#6622)
+            Verify that this operation does not modify the passed dictionary (:trac:`6622`)::
+
```

This is fine, but needs to be dedented.  Note how it's exactly at the same indentation level as the immediately following doctest.

Damn, this is going to conflict with #11840, which should probably go in first.

ok, I have solved the conflicts with #11840, and it seems to be good to go. Please double check and put into positive review if you want.

Not sure why this has conflicts (branch is red), but I think this should be okay now other than that.
