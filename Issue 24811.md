Probably not. I does worry me that we need an explicit list of OSes in the `spkg-install` file. I mean, tachyon is a ray tracer. So it mostly does computations, not syscalls. Why would the OS even matter?

Beats me. I've never looked at its source code.  Fact is it does not use `configure` or `CMake` to handle platform differences and instead has different make targets.   Obviously it works, so I'm not going to bother with it beyond that for now.
