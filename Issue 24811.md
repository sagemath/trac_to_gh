# Issue 24811: Add DESTDIR support for tachyon, and other cleanup

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-03-28 10:20:31

Keywords: destdir tachyon

This implements #24024 and #23733 for tachyon, and also cleans up its `spkg-install` in general.

Open question in this ticket: Do we care about retaining explicit support AIX and HP-UX?

Probably not. I does worry me that we need an explicit list of OSes in the `spkg-install` file. I mean, tachyon is a ray tracer. So it mostly does computations, not syscalls. Why would the OS even matter?

Beats me. I've never looked at its source code.  Fact is it does not use `configure` or `CMake` to handle platform differences and instead has different make targets.   Obviously it works, so I'm not going to bother with it beyond that for now.

I see. I should be `"Darwin"` not `"DARWIN"`.
