Except for the example in `programming.rst`, I would just use `range()` everywhere.

in doc/en/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-comprehensions.rst:

I think the context make it necessary to keep xrange for python2

in src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-programming-python.rst:

I agree that one can just use range
