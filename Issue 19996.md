# Issue 19996: `AbstractLinearCode.minimum_distance` fails with GAP message for large fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20233

Original creator: jsrn

CC:  dlucas djoyner

The following works:


```
   C = LinearCode(random_matrix(GF(5^2,'a'), 2, 5)); C.minimum_distance()
```


while the following explodes with a GAP error


```
   C = LinearCode(random_matrix(GF(17^2,'a'), 2, 5)); C.minimum_distance()
```


It seems to be conditioned only on the size of the field: All fields with cardinality greater than 256 seem to fail.

The GAP algorithms which sage is calling for minimum_distance() have a (poorly) documented limitation -- field size of at most 256.
I added a check on the field size and raise a "not implemented" exception in that case.   So at least the user will get some explanation 
of the problem rather than an incomprehensible stack dump.

Some minor things:
- I would put the fact that this only works for fields up to 256 in either a `.. NOTE::` or `.. WARNING::` block so it's more prominent in the documentation.
- You should add something just before the added doctest, something like `The field must be size at most 256::`. I would also split the line like this:
  {{{
            NotImplementedError: The GAP algorithms that sage is using
             are limited to computing with fields of size at most 256.
  }}}
- To be PEP8 compliant, you should align the string start points:
  {{{#!python
            raise NotImplementedError("the GAP algorithm that Sage is using "
                                      "is limited to computing with fields "
                                      "of size at most 256")
  }}}
  I've also suggested a few minor changes to the error message. Although I might consider limiting the actual message to something like `the field must have size at most 256` with a more detailed comment just before it saying the issue is in GAP for those looking at the code itself.

Not sure if I did what you intended regarding adding the sentence before the doctest.

I made some small tweaks. If you're good with my changes, then you can set a positive review (and don't forget to add your real name to the authors field).

Thanks Travis, your changes are definitely fine. I've switched the status to "positive review."  Please forgive a noob question: do I need to do anything git-wise about merging your changes?  It looks like I don't but I'd rather be safe than sorry...

Added the keyword sd75 to the ticket as this is work that began during the Sage Days 75 at INRIA Saclay.

Changing keywords from "" to "sd75".

No, there's nothing you need to do (in fact, mine are based on a later version of Sage than your previous push, so you might not want to pull them at this point).
