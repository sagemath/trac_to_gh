A minor point:

```diff
+        - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) whether to return
+          a certificate if the lattice is not simple
-        - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) Whether to return
-          a certificate if the lattice is not simple.
```

Once that is changed, you can set a positive review.
