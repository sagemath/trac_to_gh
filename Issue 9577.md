The change in fonts in [comment:51:ticket:12559 this comment] seems to work as well, so whatever solution we get there should work here.  Obviously we could just have two different conf things by messing with that file, but that is not particularly elegant.   There are still a few bugs with the LaTeX macros but on the way to happiness.

Also, the author confirms this is simplified Chinese in private communication.

Yikes!  Luckily, I didn't need any of them, just

```
\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}
\newcommand{\ZZ}{\Bold{Z}}
\newcommand{\QQ}{\Bold{Q}}
\newcommand{\GF}[1]{\Bold{F}_{#1}}
```
As it turns out, the problem is that `xelatex` doesn't recognize `\DeclareUnicodeCharacter`, and so one never gets to this stuff in the first place.  Of course, I didn't check whether some fairly important math characters for Sage such as

```
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{0428}{cyrillic Sha}
```
appeared correctly, but from a little browsing I think most of those declarations are just to make things look "nice", e.g.

```
\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{221A}{\sqrt}
```

Just as an fyi slight updates are pending in tutorial for sagenb becoming legacy - no need to fix this though.  It would be nice to figure out how to get this to work, or maybe we just give up on pdf?
