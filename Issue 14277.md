The new git based workflow has been more or less figured out, now it just needs to be documented.

(repost from sage-git)

I started some work on the new developer guide covering the git workflow. I created a repository at https://github.com/vbraun/sage-developer-git with a self-contained copy of the docbuild steps, so you can make changes without an extra Sage tree. Once this is in good shape, I'm planning to replace the current developer guide with it. If you want to help let me know and I'll add you to the collaborators. I think this is the quickest way to get off the ground while having all of the usual sphinx extensions at our disposal.

The result is also served as github page at http://vbraun.github.io/sage-developer-git

If we want to transfer it to the sagemath account, there is already a group set up with most of the people who have contributed to the git transition.

I'd be happy to, but I don't have sufficient permissions to transfer ownership to (or create repos in) the sagemath github org.

I moved the repo to the sagemath org and added the sage-git group to the collaborators

* Repository: https://github.com/sagemath/git-developer-guide
* Current version of the developer guide: http://sagemath.github.io/git-developer-guide/

Remove circular dependency.

Changing keywords from "" to "sd51".

The branch is identical to http://sagemath.github.io/git-developer-guide if that helps to review it...

Could you split that into thematic changes ? It looks that you write a lot of doc, but you also move some, and you also fix semicolumns, and you also fix typoes, and you also fix doctests... `O_o`

You can see the individual commits here: https://github.com/vbraun/sage-developer-git. I don't think that'll make it easier to follow, though. I also don't think that we need a lot of discussion here, this is just documenting what we have. There can't be any questions of mathematical correctness. If your English is better than mine then please go ahead and make the docs easier to understand, but in a future ticket.

YOooooooo Volker !

I would like to review the new doc, but this is really too large. It would really help if you could split that for each section or something like that, for keeping trac of everything that happens in [`@`67a7603](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=67a7603) without any explanation is scary `O_o`

By the way, there are some warnings when I build the developper's doc with.

I've fixed the warnings. 

I moved sections around to have a coherent document, so it can't be "split into sections". Just read one section at a time. If you want to know how a single file changed then just run, e.g., `git diff master HEAD doctesting.rst`.

I just reviewed "General Conventions" and started on "Cython" but it feels like there's nothing new there. What sections are new that actually need to be reviewed (other than vetting the new general layout, which looks fine to me so far, though I think the table of contents is a bit deep on the landing page).

A minor note on `walk_through.rst`: `sage -dev pull` is used (as part of "going through the above steps") before being introduced.

* In the "Writing Code for Sage" chapter the only thing that is really new are the packaging sections. I removed all mercurial stuff and references to the old file system layout, of course.

* The "Sage Notebook Developer Guide" is unchanged except that I moved general tips&tricks for using git (not specific to the notebook) elsewhere.

The rest is new.

The github repo is old, current work is done on the branch on this ticket. Can you rebase your patches?


---

Comment by mmezzarobba created at 2013-12-12 14:23:53

I've reviewed the first three chapters (not including possible English language issues, given my English level!) and pushed a patch with minor changes to `u/mmezzarobba/dev_guide`. These are only suggestions, I leave it to you to merge them or not.

I agree with Volker's comment that we should get this merged as soon as possible and keep improvements to future tickets.

I just finished a quick review of the "Git and Sage Development" part. Please cherry-pick those of my commits you judge relevant! 

On a different note, and somewhat ironically, there are test failures in `doctesting.rst`.

There was already a checked-in svg version and the doctests fixed, see comment:19. You should rebase your branch onto the latest version of mine.

That's not my point. What is going on with this ticket ? Has it been reviewed ? Do you merge it ? I mean, I don't get it `O_o`

Commit 67a76032fda3ee140c3bc52422020ef722cbee52 on this ticket *reverted* the documentation changes introduced by #13311. You might want to investigate what happened, I hope that there aren't a lot of tickets from Sage 5.13 which are accidentally reverted in Sage 6.0.
