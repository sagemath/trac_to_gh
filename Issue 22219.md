Replying to [comment:4 tscrim]:


```
C[e] = congs[max(e, key=cong_ji._element_to_vertex)]
```


Good point, I didn't notice this one.


```
elif low:  # "extending" congruence to avoid re-computation
```


Well, OK. Not sure if minimal speedup is worth slightly harder code to understand, `len(x) == 1` and `len(x) > 1` is cleaner solution.

Compiling and testing, so not ready for review just now.
