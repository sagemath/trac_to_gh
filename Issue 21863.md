OK, so `spkg-install` ran ok but no `spkg-check` is failing. For exactly the same reason and I should say at exactly the same point. This is because we already run the test suite of openblas in `spkg-install` as it seems to be part of the default target. And we have a failure in `spkg-check` because `make` was not run with the same arguments as in `spkg-install` - notably `USE_THREAD=0`. There are three things we could do at this stage:
 * fix `spkg-install` so the test suite is not run and make sure `spkg-check` is run with same options. Because there is no configuration as such the settings are not preserved from one run to another.
 * remove `spkg-check` and make a note that the test suite is run during `spkg-install`. By far the easiest solution.
 * status quo, fix `spkg-check` to use the same options as `spkg-install` and keep running the test suite in both `spkg-install` and `spkg-check`.

Other notes: this output means that the last patch I didn't forward upstream is what is needed to fix the build in #22021. A problem with `ifdef`, I cannot really forward that patch upstream without knowing precisely what shell was making it fail. I also would have to make the fix comprehensive over other makefile and possibly other use of `ifdef`.

FWIW I'm using the default shell on OSX, i.e. an ancient bash (version 3.2.57)

OK when I make a PR upstream, I can say something about the environment. In the mean time, out of the three options, what do you favor?

Is there an easy way to not run the testsuite in spkg-install? then that would be nice to minimise install time. If not then I'd just remove spkg-check since its redundant...

The main makefile has 

```
all :: libs netlib tests shared
```

so I am guessing we could call make on `libs netlib shared`. I'll put something together to try.

OK there it is. It obviously depends on #22021.
