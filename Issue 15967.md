Hi,

1. Please remove trailing whitespaces.

2. Is it pep8 to have paranthesis after opening paranthesis and before closing ones? (like `( a )`)

3. In

```
Return the number of left nodes number is ``direction``
```

the `is` should be `if`.

4. Using recursive function is a bad idea. Python is not designed to support smartly recursive function calls. You would better use depth first search.

Vincent

Hello Adrien,
in my humble opinion, merging the other way round is better..
Anyway..


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-10-21 12:21:30

in `binary tree`, please add *just one function*

the other two are just alias, and not needed. (avoid namespace pollution)

and please define what you mean by right and left node, as this is not clear at all !

You have not answered my last comment, where I suggest to add just one function instead of three in the `binary_tree` file.

The command `get_node` is already available as:

```
sage: sage: T = OrderedTree([[[], [[], [[]]]], [], [[[], []]], [], []])
sage: T[()]
     ______o_______
    /    /   /  / /
  _o__  o   o  o o
 /   /      |   
o   o_      o_  
   / /     / /  
  o o     o o   
    |           
    o           
sage: T
     ______o_______
    /    /   /  / /
  _o__  o   o  o o
 /   /      |   
o   o_      o_  
   / /     / /  
  o o     o o   
    |           
    o           
sage: T[(0,1)]
  o_
 / /
o o
  |
  o
```

So please remove it.

Good. But could you please also answer with sentences explaining what you did and what you did not (and why) ?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-11-14 08:19:52

could you please take care of comment:13, namely introduce only one new method in binary_trees.py ?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-11-19 16:30:15

`bt.left_node_number` and `bt.right_node_number` are already easily available as

```
bt[0].node_number()
```

and

```
bt[1].node_number()
```

so please remove the 3 not-so-useful new functions in `binary_trees.py` from your branch.


---

Comment by boussica created at 2015-11-19 16:55:45

Hi,

No, it is not the same function.

`bt.right_node_number` gives the number of right vertices inside the tree.
It is not the number of vertices inside the right sub-tree.

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-11-19 16:56:45

What is then a right vertex ? You should explain that in the doc, as precisely as possible.


---

Comment by boussica created at 2015-11-19 17:03:11

In a binary tree, there are right children and left children.
I use also the term of right vertices and left vertices.
Perhaps, it is better i use bt.right_child_number() and left_child_number() ?

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-04-15 07:05:18

Changing keywords from "" to "tree".


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-06-03 12:45:45

`node_paths` is already available under the name `paths`


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-06-03 15:59:26

I have started the job, not yet done.

`@`boussica, do you need all these methods in ordered_trees ? Some of them seem not to be of general use, and I would prefer to avoid them.

ok, this is ready for review.

I used the opportunity to do a few pep8 changes in binary_trees.

Adrien, please confirm that you are ok with the code and doc.
