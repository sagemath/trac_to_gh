Yes. Most probably, in the case I've considered the computation time is dominated by the `gam_gam` term, which involves multiplication of connection coefficients and which is computed for the full range of indices, irrespective of the Bianchi identity.

Well after 2 weeks, the patchbot has not shown up... I am setting the ticket to positive review without waiting any further, since all doctests are passed on my computer and the doc builds (both html and pdf).
