Because of a bug in R's installation, Sage won't install (at least on sage.math and on OS X) if the path name for `SAGE_ROOT` contains '+'.

I think this is a pretty trivial problem, so perhaps we can wait until it's fixed upstream.  I just reported it to the [R bug tracking website](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/), and I'll report back when I hear anything interesting.

Looks like this is now fixed. At least Sage is able to install R if the path name contains '+', on both OS X and linux.

Positive review, won't fix? (Or "works for me" or some other suitable conclusion.)
