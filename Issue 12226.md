# Issue 12226: Sage doesn't install if SAGE_ROOT has a "+" in it (because of R)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12398

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2012-01-31 02:07:18

Assignee: tbd

Keywords: R r-project

Because of a bug in R's installation, Sage won't install (at least on sage.math and on OS X) if the path name for `SAGE_ROOT` contains '+'.

I think this is a pretty trivial problem, so perhaps we can wait until it's fixed upstream.  I just reported it to the [R bug tracking website](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/), and I'll report back when I hear anything interesting.

John: could you post a link to the exact R bug instead of the bug tracking portal page?

Okay, done.

This is now [claimed to be fixed](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14798), although I can't tell from the link what the fix actually is or when or where it will appear.  I've changed the status here to "Fixed upstream, in a later stable release", hoping that this is accurate.

Can you reproduce this issue with recent R 3.2?

Changing status from new to needs_info.

Looks like this is now fixed. At least Sage is able to install R if the path name contains '+', on both OS X and linux.

Positive review, won't fix? (Or "works for me" or some other suitable conclusion.)
