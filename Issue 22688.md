# Issue 22688: Fix Cython interface to Pynac's find_function

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22925

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-05-02 07:01:19

There is ancient code in `pynac.pxd` that causes failures with Pynac dev versions. Especially the construct `except +ValueError` doesn't work as apparently assumed.
