# Issue 27279: groebner_basis(algorithm="magma", prot="sage") broken

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27516

Original creator: malb

Original creation time: 2019-03-20 13:25:47

This used to work:


```python
sage: P.<x,y,z> = GF(32003)[]
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(P)
sage: _ = I.groebner_basis('magma',prot='sage')
```


but now it doesn't, i.e. the "sage" filter isn't applied to the output.
