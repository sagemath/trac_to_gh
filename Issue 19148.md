CC:  borassi dcoudert dimpase vdelecroix simonking

As was done earlier with #19381, this branch strips some code out of digraph.py and stores it in `graph_input.py`.

Fortunately, most of `graph_input.py` can be reused for digraphs, so that's a net decrease in code volume in general.

Nathann

P.S.: I cannot believe all that this code does in order to guess what the user meants when he provides bad/incomplete/crazy input.

Simon: sorry to disturb, but I think I will need your help for this branch. All doctests pass in graph/ except for a test in `DiGraph.path_semigroup` that I absolutely do not understand `:-/`

Here is a trace, though it will appear soon on the patchbot (and I expect other related doctests to fail in combinat/).

I'll have a look. Obviously, we should either use an immutable version of a digraph, or (something which seems to be new) implement _cache_key.

I tried to make `Q` immutable but the result was the same. And anyway, this branch shouldn't have any effect on that `:-/`

Somehow you're breaking this behavior:

```
Q = Q.copy(immutable=True, weighted=True)
```

and the result is a mutable digraph.

This LGTM except for this change:

```diff
-            sage: G = DiGraph(M,sparse=True); G
+            sage: G = DiGraph(M,sparse=True,weighted=True); G
```

I'm worried that this change of behavior of how you handle weighted graphs could break other people's code. Unfortunately I can't comment on the correctness of either behavior, but it might have been a "feature" that others were using.

If you build a graph from a matrix in which all weights are 1 it is not considered as weighted. If any weight is different from 1 then it is considered to be weighted.

To me, this looks like a dangerous behaviour.

Do you insist on my adding a heuristic which you admit you do not use, which will set this unreliable behaviour to what it was? This way everybody will be able to create weighted graphs without knowing exactly how, and have bugs once in a while when all weights happen to be one.

It just takes one line, and it will be dedicated.

Of course, if the matrix has weights different from +1-1 BUT the graph is considered to have multiple edges, then those weights will be considered as multiple edges.

This constructor is full of corner cases like that. Where we try to guess what exactly the user did not know he wanted.

Half of the code sets flags depending on the values of others. And I am sick of trying to analyse corner-cases where you are really not sure of what should happen.
