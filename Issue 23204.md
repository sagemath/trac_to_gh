It takes me a little bit to adjust to the fact that they are rotated slightly from the usual way we draw, but it does make the drawing a little easier to look at. I will wait to see if anyone else who probably uses this code more frequently than I says before setting to a positive review.

Thanks, Travis. Bot is green, so we now need the approval of somebody else.

Looks nice to me. If people prefer the usual orientation, they may still instead look at the tikz image rather than the ascii.

Thanks, Jessica. Anybody else ? If there is no objection, maybe we can set to positive?

Same opinion as the others, takes a little bit of adjusting, but still works well if you happen to be in a terminal environment with no other options.

Positive review set.
