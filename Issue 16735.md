# Issue 16735: Factor out common code in fullerenes and fusenes

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: nvcleemp

At the moment the methods fullerenes and the method fusenes in graph_generators have common code to read the input planar_code format. If plantri is added, then even more methods will use this code, so this ticket moves that code to a separate method.

I'm not sure whether this really is the correct place for this method, but I'm sure somebody will enlighten me.

This method will also be used by the new methods introduced in #16970.
