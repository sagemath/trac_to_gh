So...don't do that?  The proper way to "clean" a previous package installation is to run `make clean-pkgconf`.  Just deleting the stamp file doesn't mean the previous installation is removed.

Replying to [comment:1 embray]:
> So...don't do that?


So what if

(1) the wrong data is written to `local/var/lib/sage/installed/pkgconf` due to a bug?

(2) the uninstaller didn't work due to a bug?

(3) something crashed and the filesystem state is no longer consistent with `local/var/lib/sage/installed/pkgconf`

As shown on #25731, (1) has happened already and (3) is certainly possible.

I do think maybe `sdh_install` should be more forgiving.  Originally, I made it error when trying to overwrite an existing file since under normal circumstances that would be a problem (e.g. multiple packages trying to write the same file).  But perhaps just a warning would suffice.

I think there are (at least) two valid issues here:

1. `sdh_install` should allow overwriting an existing file when the `-T` flag is used (consistent with GNU install).  The error we're getting here only make sense when trying to install files into a file into a path that is not a directory.

2. The patch level on the pkgconf spkg should be bumped (I'll fix that in another ticket).
