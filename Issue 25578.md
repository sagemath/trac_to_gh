# Issue 25578: Floating point accuracy fail in sage.symbolic.expression on Cygwin

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-07-10 14:15:40

Started getting this test failure on Cygwin:


```
sage -t src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 6843, in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.polynomial
Failed example:
    f.polynomial(CDF)
Expected:
    (-2.718281828459045)*y^2 + 31.006276680299827*x - 1.0*I
Got:
    (-2.7182818284590455)*y^2 + 31.006276680299827*x - 1.0*I
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 6957, in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression._polynomial_
Failed example:
    R(f)
Expected:
    2.718281828459045*x^3 + 3.141592653589793*y^3 + 1.414213562373095 + 1.0*I
Got:
    2.7182818284590455*x^3 + 3.141592653589793*y^3 + 1.414213562373095 + 1.0*I
```


probably as a result of #25247, probably only on Cygwin due to a slight rounding difference in some libc math function.

Changing priority from critical to blocker.

Setting as blocker since it's the only way, apparently, to communicate priorities following a "release candidate 0" release even though I mentioned on sage-devel that it would be very helpful to have it merged.
