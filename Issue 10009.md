# Issue 10009: PyCUDA package (optional)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10010

Original creator: maldun

Original creation time: 2010-09-24 21:26:10

Assignee: maldun

Keywords: cuda gpu programming

The PyCuda Package from Andreas Kloeckner (a useful GPU Programming tool for NVIDIA Graphic cards). See http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda for more Info

The package can be downloaded from: http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/downloads/detail?name=pycuda-0.94.1.spkg (direct link: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pycuda-0.94.1.spkg)

Installation Notes:
 * Install CUDA on your machine: http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_3_2_toolkit_rc.html
 * set the SAGE_CUDA variable in your shell with:
  ` export SAGE_CUDA =/where/you/have/installed/cuda`
  (i set in .bashrc)
 * install package. (Download it from the links above)
 * IMPORTANT: After installation the setuptools package has to be reinstalled!! Because the installer uses the distributed egg package. This messes somehow with setuptools and will be removed after the installation. But this destroys setup tools! 
 * enjoy!

This is only tested in ubuntu 10.04 with nvidia devel drivers (260.40) on an NVIDIA GeForce 9500 GT, with CUDA toolkit 3.2.

So more testing is neeeded!

See also #10009 for an optional OpenCL (PyOpenCL) spkg.

*Remark:*
I changed 


```
cd $SAGE_LOCAL/LIB/python/site-packages
```


to


```
cd $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages
```


to make it possible to install this package on FEMhub also. The same applies for #10009

I suspect the problem with setuptools breaking after the use of distribute can be solved by upgrading the current default version of setuptools 0.6c9 in Sage to 0.6c11, see also https://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/4153d6a8135c921d

After #10361 lands, the setuptools corruption should be gone. Also, there's an update upstream (pycuda-0.94.2), which fixes some kind of corruption bug for Fermi devices. It would be good to have this update.

I uploaded a package with the new PyCuda version, which holds the change with respect to the update.
There was only one small problem, which could be fixed rather easily: the PyCuda folder contained a folder named src, which leaded to name problems during the installation. Creation of some symbolic links did the trick.

Here thelink of the new package: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pycuda-0.94.2.spkg

Setting spkg proposals that have not seen recent activity to "sage-wishlist".
