The PyCuda Package from Andreas Kloeckner (a useful GPU Programming tool for NVIDIA Graphic cards). See http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda for more Info

The package can be downloaded from: http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/downloads/detail?name=pycuda-0.94.1.spkg (direct link: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pycuda-0.94.1.spkg)

Installation Notes:
* Install CUDA on your machine: http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_3_2_toolkit_rc.html
* set the SAGE_CUDA variable in your shell with:
  ` export SAGE_CUDA =/where/you/have/installed/cuda`
  (i set in .bashrc)
* install package. (Download it from the links above)
* IMPORTANT: After installation the setuptools package has to be reinstalled!! Because the installer uses the distributed egg package. This messes somehow with setuptools and will be removed after the installation. But this destroys setup tools! 
* enjoy!

I uploaded a package with the new PyCuda version, which holds the change with respect to the update.
There was only one small problem, which could be fixed rather easily: the PyCuda folder contained a folder named src, which leaded to name problems during the installation. Creation of some symbolic links did the trick.

Here thelink of the new package: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pycuda-0.94.2.spkg
