CC:  @zimmermann6

This fixes in particular the following issue, found thanks to a question
of Paul Zimmermann:

```
sage: QQ[I](I.pyobject())
...
TypeError: No compatible natural embeddings found for Number Field in I
with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 and Complex Lazy Field
```

Also fix the conversion of elements of ℚ[i] to CIF to correctly take into account the choice of embedding.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23117

Some comments:

- I don't see the point of the internal `embedding` function. IMO, it makes things more complicated.
- This is ugly:

Otherwise everything seems to be good.

Having an internal function makes it easy to exit at any point of the chain of `try`s using `return`, that's all.

>   but it might be an necessary evil.

That's what I thought, but I had another look thanks to your comment, and it turns out it was a weakness in my code (or perhaps in `NumberField`/`NumberFieldElement_quadratic`, which are not clever enough to recognize the standard embedding of a real number field when given as an embedding into ℂ).

At least right now you don't really have a chain (and your current order is suboptimal when it fails for `CIF`). I would just do

```python
from sage.rings.all import CIF, CLF, RIF, RLF
try:
    iv = CIF(elt)
except (TypeError, ValueError):
    emb = None
else:
    try:
        RIF(elt) # There is a better check for realness, correct?
        LF = RLF
    except (TypeError, ValueError):
        LF = CLF
    # First try creating an ANRoot manually, because extension(...,
    # embedding=CLF(expr)) (or ...QQbar(expr)) would normalize the
    # expression in QQbar, which currently is VERY slow in many
    # cases. This may fail when minpoly has close roots or elt is a
    # complicated symbolic expression.
    # TODO: Rewrite using #19362 and/or #17886 and/or #15600 once
    # those issues are solved.
    from sage.rings.qqbar import AlgebraicNumber, ANRoot
    try:
        elt = AlgebraicNumber(ANRoot(minpoly, iv))
    except ValueError:
        pass
    emb = LF(elt)
```

So it is a necessary evil at present until another part of code is improved? Am I understanding your comment correctly?

Why not—I changed the implementation to something like that.

> {{{

I don't know. I'm now testing

```
if iv.imag().is_zero() or iv.imag().contains_zero() and elt.imag().is_zero())
```

but I don't think it makes a significant difference.

No, sorry if I was not clear: it was a weakness of my initial implementation, fixed in a469c70 (itself now squashed into 742c8a4).
