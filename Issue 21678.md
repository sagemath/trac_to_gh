# Issue 21678: Math in docstrings compiles badly in docs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: pelegm

Original creation time: 2016-11-21 13:45:50

See [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/probability/sage/probability/random_variable.html#sage.probability.random_variable.RandomVariable_generic](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/probability/sage/probability/random_variable.html#sage.probability.random_variable.RandomVariable_generic) for example.

A single `*` should be replaced with `\cdot`, and a double `**` should be replaced with `^`.

I don't understand the problem because `RandomVariable_generic` has almost nothing in its docstring.

This is an issue with the documentation itself. It should be done using latex, but instead the person who originally wrote the doc used Python code.

Sure, then I am going to fix this sometime today probably (at least in this module).
