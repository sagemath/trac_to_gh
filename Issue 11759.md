Taken from Sets.ParentMethods._element_constructor_from_element_class:


```
            Caveat: ``self`` is passed to the constructor of the
            element class as a keyword argument ``parent``. Many
            element classes in Sage, in particular those implemented
            by mean of extension types, take ``parent`` as first
            mandatory argument instead.

            This incompatibility will be fixed soon (Fall 2009?) by
            having all element classes take ``parent`` as first
            mandatory argument, and updating this default
            implementation of :meth:`_element_constructor_`.
```


Fall 2009 is long over ...
