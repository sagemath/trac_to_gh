# Issue 18039: is_squarefree() should work over UFD, not just PID

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18276

The implementation of `is_squarefree()` for univariate polynomials requires that the base ring is a PID. However, the algorithm relies on `gcd()` computations, for which an UFD is sufficient. Therefore, the condition on the input can be relaxed.
