# Issue 22588: Symbolic constant's interactive docs are unhelpful

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22825

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-04-18 13:07:05

Symbolic constants become expressions. That's probably why this happens:

```
sage: NaN?
Type:           Expression
String form:    NaN
Length:         0
File:           ~/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
Docstring:     
   Nearly all expressions are created by calling
...
```

It should be possible to get the docstring for the embedded Pyobject.
