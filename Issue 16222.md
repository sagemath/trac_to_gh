Close as won't fix? `polar_plot` never gets its argument, since `fibonacci` isn't symbolic:

```
sage: fibonacci(floor(tan((abs(alpha+pi/2)^0.22))))
TypeError: unable to convert x (=floor(tan(abs(1/2*pi + alpha)^0.220000000000000))) to an integer
```

Apart from hobbling sage by equipping every conceivable function in sage with a symbolic equivalent, we can't really do something about this (perhaps document somewhere where newbies will look?)

Could be worth adding examples of how to use lambda functions for precisely this contingency in several place in the docs.  Though see #8383 for some actual use cases (and how do other systems handle this?) suggesting to make symbolic versions of everything.
