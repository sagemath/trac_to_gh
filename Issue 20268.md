With your modifications there is a lot of line break which makes the doctest output unreadable. There must be a Python3 equivalent to

```
print "a",
print "b"
```

I did enhance things in the manifold file. Is this what you wanted ? or is there something else ?

Could you simplify the print like

```
print("{} : {}".format(ind1, list(M.index_generator(2))))
```

into more readable format like

```
print(ind1, ":", list(M.index_generator(2)))
```

No, because I need something that gives the same result in py2 and py3.

Your proposal in py2

```
In [1]: print('a', ":", 'b')
('a', ':', 'b')
```

and in py3

```
In [1]: print('a', ":", 'b')
a : b
```

Vincent, are you planning to finish this review ?

CC'ing myself as a possible reviewer.

I guess that removing a space in


```
- print "hilbert_conductor_inverse failed for d =", d
+ print("hilbert_conductor_inverse failed for d ={}".format(d))
```


is an error. Or then it should be `d=`, not `d =`.

I read this, ran long tests for modified files, and tested files that had failed tests in a pathcbot. Everything seems to be good.

So feel free to mark this as _positive_review_ on behalf of me. Or correct the missing space I mentioned in previous comment before that if you want.

oh, shoot. I hope that this will not happen for all of my 20 or so tickets on python3 print.

What should I do to re-review this (and other similar tickets)? From your push â€‹573e76a I can not see what you really did in this merge.

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-05-17 07:30:36

I did nothing. There was no conflict. I think one will have to wait for 7.3.b0 to see the conflict.

ok, patchbot is green, except for the 4 doctests due to #20529

I allow myself to put this back to positive review
