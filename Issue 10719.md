D.S. McNeil posted several ideas for enhancing sage. This ticket is for the enhancements proposed for the primes function.


```
(3) primes(10, infinity) should work. 
Since we're just calling next_prime, there's no reason to require the 
upper limit to be an integer. 
Wouldn't mind a proof=False option which calls next_probable_prime 
instead, either. 
```
