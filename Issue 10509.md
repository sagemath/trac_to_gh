It doesn't look like you're using anything specific to Cython, any reason why this isn't a simple .py file? 

> [remark: in case I don't import all functions to the global namespace, the error check ".\sage -t <path to file>" says that all those functions which I haven't imported don't pass the error check any more !?]

You don't want to do a "from ecpp import *" as that will put every name in your module into the global namespace--if everyone did this there would be a very cluttered namespace not to mention thousands of collisions. For testing anything but the top-level functions, you should have an explicit "from sage.rings.ecpp import X" in your doctest before using it. 

In terms of code organization, I think it would be better if a certificate was a Python class with a verify method (that returned True or False), and perhaps a nice __repr__ method as well.

In general, classes are preferred in Sage, as a list is rather meaningless without context. For example, [1,0,1,0,35] could be an elliptic curve, polynomial, point counts, or whatever. It also is a good place to put a method for verification (as verify_certificate is more likely to invoke recollections of ssl than primality proving).

Also, it'd probably be more Pythonic to return None or raise an exception if the number is not prime. 

> I'll prepare a class for ecpp... Is it possible to include the class in a Cython file (and thus to make it run fast again)?

Yes, classes work just fine in Cython.

Hi,

ecpp.pyx has now been changed into a class ECPP() which stores a certificate and provides primality proving by one of the following commands:
ECPP(<number>) [constructor], ECPP().goldwasser_kilian(<number>), ECPP().atkin_morain(<number>) and ECPP().ecpp(<number>).

For composite numbers, a StandardError is raised (and a RuntimeError in case the primality proof fails during the "downrun").

Certificates can be verified as follows:
e = ECPP(<number>)
e.verify_certificate()

The file is added to sage/rings as .pyx again. It contains a latex() and repr() function. Reviews are appreciated!

Hi,

I have been implementing an ECPP certificate verification sage script in the latest days as well. I am pleased to see that such a procedure is being incorporated in Sage.

During my work I noticed an issue that seems to be still present in the current code base. (I have been using an older sage install...) When creating an elliptic curve over Z_N using the Elliptic Curve constructor, the primality of N is proven through calls to the is_prime function. Several such calls are performed in the `EllipticCurve` constructor, the `EllipticCurve_generic` constructor...

In Sage, it doesn't seem possible for the time being to build an `EllipticCurve` object without proving/disproving the primality of the characteristic of the underlying Ring. This slows down the ECPP certificate verification, and makes it pointless since another proven method is used behind the scenes on the integer we want to prove the primality of.

Is this an issue for your code? When profiling your (verification) code, does the computation spend a significant amount of its running time in method 'is_prime' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'. (profile with %prun e.verify_certificate())

As a side comment, the is_prime method of the Integer class is probably also a good place to call your code from.

I apologize for not being able to perform more in depth tests before reporting this potential issue (I am not able to set up a sage development environment at short notice).

Best wishes,

Jean-RenÃ©

I only perform verification of certificates obtained by other means. My code spends more than 90% of its running time in is_prime, which is called several times from `EllipticCurve` constructor. The behaviour of this constructor has an huge impact on the performance.

> Isn't it the case that is_prime() switches over to a pseudoprimality test as soon as the input number exceeds a certain bound (which will be probably the case for numbers tested via ECPP) and is thus very fast again? If not, it would indeed make the code pointless somehow

is_prime doesn't perform the switch from proven behaviour to probable behaviour unless asked for. (cf sage: ?is_prime )

> (as computations on elliptic curves are vital for ECPP and it wouldn't make that much sense to me to re-implement EllipticCurve, Schoof-Elkies-Atkin etc just for this single file ecpp.pyx)

I think the best option would be to add a flag to the `EllipticCurve` and `EllipticCurve_generic` constructors determining whether primality tests are performed or not. This should enable to continue using the existing codebase on elliptic curves.

Finally, I have been working on an old version of Sage (4.0.2), my claims may be false in the latest versions, although reading the elliptic curve constructor code in the sage repository leads me to believe that the issue is still there.

Hi Jean-RenÃ©,

in case that is_prime doesn't switch its behaviour, I totally agree that the best way to solve this problem would be adding a flag to EllipticCurve for disabling the primality test. Then, all existing code would still be usable and everyone could decide for himself whether he/she wants to do possibly undefined computations (at own risk).
I posted the question on sage-devel yesterday
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/c9fcfba8f222644f
and hope that such a flag could be included as this would solve the ECPP problem.
Best,
Georg

Hi,
may this ticket be closed? Further changes (if any) will affect the "Elliptic Curve" class, not the class ECPP itself.
Best, Georg
