One can currently iterate over the elements of a `FrozenBitset`, but only in the forward direction. This ticket fixes that.

This will work for now, although both this and the iterator would be better to not create the whole list and then iterate over it (more important for large bitsets). Although for the reversed, this would be much harder to do than the forward iterator.
