This can fail when the vertices do not define `<`


```
~/s/sage/sage-rebasing/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/graphs/digraph.py in <listcomp>(.0)
   3323                 raise ValueError("`self` should be an acyclic graph")
   3324             levels = self.level_sets()
-> 3325             levels = [sorted(z) for z in levels]
   3326             if rankdir=='down' or rankdir=='left':
   3327                 levels.reverse()
