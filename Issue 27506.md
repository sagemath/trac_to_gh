`@`chapoton the pyflakes warning in patchbot didn't really help, so I downloaded pyflakes and tested the file myself and fixed all the warnings. On my end I'm no longer getting any errors. Hopefully patchbot comes back positive on here as well for pyflakes.

* What was not clear in the patchbot pyflakes message ? Maybe you looked at the wrong one.. The correct one said

```
src/sage/geometry/hyperplane_arrangement/arrangement.py:1589: local variable 'n' is assigned to but never used
```


* typo "simplical" is still there

* in "is_simplicial", you do not need n when doing essentialization, only after

* then you can just use `all(R.n_facets() == n for R in self.regions())`

* `B = None` should be `B=None` in the def line of poset_of_regions

* next line, Returns should be Return

* The explanation paragraphs (in both functions) are not written in very good English.

* move the import of Poset to the import section near the beginning of the file

* poset_of_regions lacks an INPUT section, and examples using the parameters

* while len(R) can be replaced by while R

I had assumed that all the pyflakes logs would be the same, but apparently not. Going back I was able to find the log you are talking about.

I've gone through and updated the document with the corrections you wanted, with some additional things that I noticed in the correction process.

Yes, there is a rogue patchbot, with no owner and spitting out wrong pyflakes reports...

I would suggest to remove the full sentence

```
In an essential arrangement, this equates to
+        a region having a rank number of facets/bounding hyperplanes.
```

which is not needed, and still a bit clunky.

Ah that works. In the future I'll double check multiple pyflake reports if there is an error.

I've gone ahead and removed the sentence you wanted.

(Also, I wanted to say thank you for being patient with me. It's been a while since I last submitted to sage)
