`src/bin/sage-env-config` must get updated after, say, `sage -i mpir` (or any other dummy package that sets anything in the build environment). Currently this does not happen. This is a bug introduced in #27212 that leads to `sage -i mpir` breaking stuff. 

Possible fix:

 `sage -i blah` should run ./configure which (somehow) must ignore whatever one has in `blah/spkg-configure.m4`. E.g. `./configure` must get `--with-blah=` parameter which is by default `system`, but may be changed to `install` or `sage` or something like this.

We can also merely document that `./sage -i blah` must be run after `./configure --with-blah=install`, perhaps also insert some warning print somewhere...

I looked a bit into how `./sage -i blah` may trigger a run of `./configure --with-blah=install` - this is not hard, assuming `--with-blah` is a parameter known to configure. E.g. it can grep for it in the output of `./configure -h`, and 
run, if found.

This will require having each package `blah` for which such a configure run is needed to implement the corresponding `--with-blah=`, (or, perhaps, something like
`--install-blah`, to make it even clearer)

An alternative might be to do this via special Makefile targets, something I am much less keen on.

On further reflection, it won't fly yet, as it would need to remember the exact parameters used to call `./configure`...

An easier hack would be to set a flag in the call of `sage -i blah` which would be tested by the spkg-install of `blah` and if it's on, rewrite the corresponding part of
`src/bin/sage-env-config`. A relatively ugly hack, but looks relatively easy to implement.

If you change `src/bin/sage-env-config`, you'll have to re-install it. The one used at runtime is `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env-config`. The real way to do that is to have individual packages install the environment variable they need and then `sage-env` to read them. Like Erik suggested before. Such variables not being handled by the package themselves just lead to madness just as you are experiencing now.

Erik, could you please look at the new ("frozen") targets I'm trying to add to `build/make/Makefile.in` (see the latest commits on this branch, the loop that populates them is commented out and marked by TODO). I cannot make them work for a reason I don't understand.

The idea is that FROZEN_PACKAGES, a list that has at most mpir and gmp on, has its NORMAL_PACKAGES targets replaced by `$(error...)`, to provide an intelligent error reporting at `sage -i` attempts on them.

But it does not work (if uncommented), they always get invoked, at normal `make` runs too, and the build does not go forward. 

I don't see what is wrong there (not the least, perhaps, as I still don't quite understand the dummy targets hack, IMHO it deserves more comments in that Makefile.in...)

But that's a feature. It's the same for other optionally-from-the-system packages.

The command `sage -i mpir` means "build the Sage package `mpir`". I think it's good to have an override for system packages: if I really want the Sage `mpir` package, I would be able to install it with `sage -i mpir`.

I don't understand - unless after running ./configure you do make once again.
But then what's the point of running ./configure after make, if you can run in before make, and run make just once?

It might help to look at exactly what `sage -i` does (from `src/bin/sage`):


```
    for PKG in $PACKAGES; do
        echo
        # First check that $PKG is actually a Makefile target
        # See https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25078
        if ! echo "$ALL_TARGETS" | grep "^${PKG}$" >/dev/null; then
            echo >&2 "Error: package '$PKG' not found"
            echo >&2 "Note: if it is an old-style package, use -p instead of -i to install it"
            exit 1
        fi
        $MAKE SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg $INSTALL_OPTIONS" "$PKG"
    done
```


There are some bits here that obscure things, but ultimately the meat of the command that it's running to install the package is


```
make <pkgname>
```


or to use a real example


```
make mpir
```


In this case the Makefile target that's *just* the package name itself is a "phony target": It does not correspond to a file that is expected to exist (e.g. same as `all` or `clean`).  The thing about phony targets is that when you run them their rules are just followed no matter what (there's no output file to check whether it's already up-to-date).

However, phony targets can still have prerequisites, and when running a phony target it will still follow the usual rules of ensuring that all the prerequisites exist and are up-to-date.

In `build/make/Makefile` the recipes for <pkgname> phony targets are simple and boil down to (in the case of mpir):


```
mpir: local/var/lib/sage/installed/mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868.p0
```


i.e. the "stamp file" that is normally created when an SPKG is installed, indicating that that SPKG is installed and up-to-date.

However, if the mpir SPKG was *not* installed (or same for any other package that was not installed by default, such as git), then this file does not exist.  That's because the "stamp file" for mpir as far as the rest of the Makefile is concerned is `local/var/lib/sage/installed/.dummy`--just an empty file that is created once (if it doesn't exist) and is otherwise always "up-to-date".

Meanwhile, the make recipe for building the real stamp file at `local/var/lib/sage/installed/mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868.p0` boils down to (when you strip away some of the noise like `sage-logger`)


```
sage-spkg mpir
```


which *actually* installs the Sage SPKG, and which also create the "stamp file" at `local/var/lib/sage/installed/mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868.p0` indicating that now the actual mpir SPKG is installed.

This is why, as Jeroen pointed out, it's not strictly necessary to re-run `./configure` *first*, because even if mpir is a "dummy package" in the Makefile, running `make mpir` will forcibly install the SPKG anyways.

We still would need to re-run `./configure` afterwards and ensure that when `build/make/Makefile` is re-generated it no longer includes mpir in its list of `DUMMY_PACKAGES`.  If it does, then that's a bug that we need to correct.

It might be easier to understand the whole thing if `DUMMY_PACKAGES` were called something else like `DEPENDENCIES_THAT_ARE_NOT_NEEDED_OR_ARE_OTHERWISE_SATISFIED_BY_THE_SYSTEM`.

I think I have explained this once already. The reason for this ticket is that the branch of #27212 introduces a breakage into `./sage -i mpir/gmp`, ASSUMING Sage is configured to use an external `$MP_LIBRARY`. So I am fixing this here.
And it's not really "disallowed", it's "do this and this, then `./sage -i mpir/gmp`".

If Sage is configured with its own gmp/mpir then `./sage -i gmp/mpir` will continue to work as before, also with this branch.

your proposal, running ./configure after `sage -i mpir`, does not really fly, as `sage -i mpir` triggers a rebuild of its dependencies without proper changes in the environment,
so the dependencies will get rebuild against the external "mpir/gmp".

Running ./configure before `sage -i mpir`, as Erik proposed, is safer, but needs more of these `--with-foo=` than we currently have.  

>

Yes, but there are not too many packages that modify (or will need to modify) `sage-env-config`.

These are packages (say, gmp) that for historical or other reasons spawned a cottage industry of custom-installated headers and libraries, so that packages that use then do `--with-gmp=`, or/and `--with-gmp-headers=`...

A list may be compiled by looking at the output of `grep \\-with\\- $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/*/spkg-install`. I get 
blas/lapack/openblas, cdd(lib), flint, glpk, gmp, mpfr, mpir, isl, ntl, pari, polylib, readline, zlib.

However this can be further pruned, as e.g. --with-zlib=$SAGE_LOCAL is harmless, in the sense that if extrenal zlib is used, this option does not break anything.
In this sense, despite already allowing several external libraries replacements for the Sage-vendored ones (see #27330, we already can have external bzip2, libffi, lzma, zlib, gf2x, no problems it seems) gmp/mpir are the 1st that really need this special treatment.

In general, these two variables SAGE_GMP_PREFIX, SAGE_GMP_INCLUDE, can be non-empty. Indeed, their values can be overridden by your check. OK, I have to think about it.

I'm confused what you mean here: are you talking about dependencies of mpir or packages depending on mpir? `sage -i mpir` installs dependencies of mpir (which is only yasm) but for the dependencies, it doesn't matter how mpir is configured.

While I expect this to work, this means living with an inconsistency between the configuration as given by `./config.status --config` and the real one, which takes precedence once this patch above is applied.
A run of ./configure, either with the proper parameters, or allowing it look into `$SAGE_LOCAL`, is needed to fix this inconsistency.

I am uneasy about letting `./configure` look into `$SAGE_LOCAL`, as there could be stale or broken packages there in need of a rebuild, which can trick `./configure`.

Although the latter seems attractive going forward, as it would allow pointing not only at `$SAGE_LOCAL`, but at other non-standard locations with goodies ready to be used, too (useful for . This will require adjusting a number of `spkg-configure.m4` files.

OK, so this is what I'd like to do

* set up a new ./configure parameter `--installed-packages=` that can be empty, or point to `$SAGE_LOCAL`, or to another Sage build tree (maybe outside of $SAGE_ROOT tree). 
* this parameter is checked by `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`, which needs to be modified. If it's empty, skip to the current behaviour.
* otherwise, assume the parameter equals DIR. Check that DIR/local/var/lib/sage/installed/SPKG_NAME-SPKG_VERSION exists, if not, skip to the current behaviour.
* otherwise, ignore all the `--with-SPKG_NAME=` and similar (such as `--with-mp=`) parameters, and use SPKG_NAME from DIR.
* individual `spkg-configure.m4` typically won't need to do anything new here (but perhaps not always).

The call to `./sage -i/f SPKG_NAME` will first install `SPKG_NAME` as it currently does, and then call `./configure $(./config.status --config) --installed-packages=$SAGE_LOCAL`.

The whole thing would have the same effect as `./configure $(./config.status --config) --with-SPKG_NAME=install` (assuming `--with-SPKG_NAME=install` is implemented - it need not be the case) followed by `sage -i/f SPKG_NAME`.

What worries me here a bit are the timestamps that will be backwards, as normally `make` is run after `./configure`, not before?

What's the opinion of the other kitchen chefs on this grand design?

TLDR; one needs to reconcile the results of manual running `./sage -i` with the results of `./configure`. At the same time, it would provide a handy way to use Sage packages build out of the tree in a "trusted" location, without going through macros checking them (such macros might not work for non-standard locations).
 

> Nevertheless, first impressions:

sure, how about `--installed-packages_prefix=`?

> * Once you get to the fact that it is a directory, I notice you don't mention the possibility to point it to `/usr` or `/usr/local`. You imply a separate prefix where you install a bunch of packages. That's part of the second limitation, you pass only one directory.

The standard directories are already taken care of by the spkg-configure.m4 macros, but yes, having more then one "trusted" $SAGE_LOCAL might be useful.

This all sounds way overcomplicated to me in order to solve, what, as I've explained, is not a complicated issue.  Now you're throwing into the mix the idea of having multiple arbitrary package installation prefixes.  While I'm not opposed to that necessarily in principle, it's a huge can of worms at not all needed in order to solve this problem.

I haven't really had time to work on this the last couple weeks as I've had higher priorities, but perhaps I can take a crack at solving this issue soon.  I'm certain it doesn't need to get that complicated or difficult.

There is a different but related bug with `sage -i` that is independent of any of the `spkg-configure` stuff.

There is a list in `build/make/Makefile` (that is generated at configure-time) called `OPTIONAL_INSTALLED_PACKAGES`.  This lists packages of type=optional that happen to be installed at the time `configure` is run (which it checks, slightly sloppily, by checking of `local/var/lib/sage/installed/<pkgname>-*` exists; I don't have a better way in mind at the moment).  In a default install built from this ticket it has:


```
# All optional installed packages (triggers the auto-update)
OPTIONAL_INSTALLED_PACKAGES = \
    python2 \
```


(I'm not fond of the fact that python2 is considered an "optional" package but that's a different issue.)


This list is used primarily in the `all-sage` target, which ensures that all packges are up-to-date when running `make`--this is usually run as part of the default make target:


```
all-sage: \
                sagelib \
                $(STANDARD_PACKAGE_INSTS) \
                $(OPTIONAL_INSTALLED_PACKAGE_INSTS) \
                $(EXTCODE) \
                $(SCRIPTS)
```


This ensures that if some package is updated, all of its dependent packages are also updated, including *optional* packages that are not normally part of the `sagelib` dependencies.

However, when running `sage -i` on some optional package (for example, I ran `sage -i fricas`) this list is *not* immediately updated.  I can run `make build` all day after `sage -i` and it still won't update.  This is because, of course, `./configure` needs to be re-run.  And after `configure` it should make sense to re-run `make build` as well, since some packages' dependencies might have been updated.

The other problem is that re-running `configure` after installing, say, `mpir`, doesn't move it from `DUMMY_PACKAGES` to `BUILT_PACKAGES`.

This should be done in `configure` by checking of the `spkg` is installed (again, if nothing else, by looking for some `local/var/lib/sage/installed/mpir-*`) and forcing `sage_spkg_install_mpir=yes`, skipping all other checks.
