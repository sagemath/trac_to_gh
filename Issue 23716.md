# Issue 23716: Iterator for hypergeometric motives

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23953

Original creator: kedlaya

Ticket #23671 provides the function `possible_hypergeometric_data` which returns a list of all hypergeometric data with prescribed degree (and optionally weight). It would be better to also provide an iterator, so that one can do a list comprehension to further filter the results without instantiating the entire list.
