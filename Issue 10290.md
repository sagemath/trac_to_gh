Assignee: jason, was

Run the following in Sage-4.6 Notebook:

```
p = polygon2d([(1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (0,0)])
for i in range(10):
    p
```

Every time the rectangle gets smaller and smaller.

It looks to me like `axes_pad` is computed again and again and adding `axes_pad=0` indeed solves the problem. But I don't know much about plotting framework, so I will be happy is someone else fixes it.

Tiny technical pick - can we cancel removal of the empty line 1716? Otherwise this patch and the fresh one at #7981 become conflicting/interdependent for no real reason.
