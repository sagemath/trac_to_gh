Keywords: PARI/GP qfminim

There's a very simple bug in Sagemath's PARI/GP 2.11.4, currently fixed in PARI/GP master, such that e.g. gp('qfminim(Mat([1.]),,,2)') will error with the message

***   at top-level: qfminim(Mat([1.]),,,2)
  ***                 ^----------------------
  *** qfminim: precision too low in qfminim.

Unfortunately, the same bug is also affecting some of the number theory code I've written, as it uses the Fincke-Post algorithm via qfminim() to fetch lattice points for a grid search.

This is PARI/GP bug #2262:

https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=2262

A missing mandatory flag when calling lllfp in fincke_pohst() was
causing internal confusion (same error on qfminit(Mat(1),,,2)).
