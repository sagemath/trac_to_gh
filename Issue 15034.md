Calling pretty_print_default in a terminal fails:

```

```


Perhaps calling pretty_print_default doesn't make much sense in the terminal, but it's used in the emacs interface to be able to display typeset output.

I think doctests pass because the doctesting framework sets sys.displayhook to something else, namely `sage.misc.displayhook.DisplayHook(sys.displayhook)`.  I think the regression was introduced in #15168, and so I have cc'ed the people involved there in case they want to weigh in on how this should be fixed.

As commented in the function, this should probably be removed from the global namespace. It is really not useful in the terminal.

Correct, the terminal uses IPython's machinery instead of `sys.displayhook`. The doctests and the notebook run commands in non-ipython sessions, so our displayhook is used. IMHO the best way to switch IPython's behavior is with the `%display` magic, that is,

```
sage: %display typeset
sage: 1+1
<html><script type="math/tex">\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}2</script></html>
```

I see that we don't actually doctest that, this ought to be added to `sage/misc/sage_extension.py`

If we want to fix this function, can this be made to call whatever the magic `%display typeset` runs?

Maybe run the current code inside a `try: except:` construct?

However, this is needed in [all_notebook.py](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/all_notebook.py), so don't just remove it completely!
