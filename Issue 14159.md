As noted in #14246, the SageTeX spkg has grown a bit crufty. Some bits of the SPKG.txt refer to now vastly outdated scripts and should be fixed up.

This is addressed by the new version of SageTeX. If #19072 is closed, this ticket should be closed too.

You could just close this in any case, as duplicate of that ticket.
