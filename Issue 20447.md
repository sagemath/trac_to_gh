This ticket adds a new feature to the benchmarking tool introduced in #20526 which allows the user
to interrupt an run (with Ctrl+C) and resume it afterwards by typing `Benchmark.run()` again.
It will resume the run at the exact place it was stopped before.
If triggered in verbose mode, the current progress status will be kept (e.g. if stopped at 25%, the first message of the new run in verbose mode will be `25% complete`).

This will probably be superseded by the [BleacherMark project](https://github.com/miguelmarco/bleachermark).
