If we are plotting a circle or sphere with circle.show(), we ought to see a circle and not have to manually specify the aspect ratio.  The aspect ratio should have sensible defaults that depend on the thing that is being plotted.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/2100

For reference, in Mathematica (see http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/AspectRatio.html?q=AspectRatio&lang=en )

* Graphics objects use Automatic aspect ratio
* plot and listplot use 1/golden ratio
* parametric plot uses automatic
* contour plot uses aspect ratio of 1

Automatic is an aspect ratio determined by the pixels in the plot.  It does not distort the plot (i.e., circles are still circles).

#9813 takes care of two cases of these.

Interestingly, from the above list, it seems like the golden ratio is only used for a minority of functions (i.e., "plot" and "list_plot").  So maybe we ought to change the global default to aspect_ratio=1 and just set plot and list_plot to have default golden ratio aspect ratios.

| 'auto' | doesn't seem to matter | Full | Make the current data limits fill the available sized box |
| 'equal' or 1 | 'box' | Automatic | Make each pixel be square (aspect ratio 1) |
| | | | |
It appears that specifying a number in matplotlib ('box' adjustable) makes the *pixels* have a certain height-to-width ratio (e.g., a circle in the picture will appear to have the given aspect ratio), but in Mathematica, a number specifies the overall ratio of the *image* height-to-width.Â  Thus the numbers are not directly comparable.

Plus, in matplotlib, you can have the 'datalim' be adjustable, which changes the data limits on your plot to make the pixels have a certain aspect ratio.

We have two concepts of "aspect ratio" that we'd like to expose to the user.

* Figure aspect ratio -- controls the final image size, including any text labels, etc.Â  This will be set using the following options:
  * fig_aspect_ratio
    * number - make an image with the specified aspect ratio (within reason) using the figaspect matplotlib function (which tries to be marginally smart, which actually may be a dumb thing to do...)
    * 'auto' (default) - use bbox_inches='tight' to create a figure that holds the drawn objects
  * figsize
    * single number - use this as a base size for fig_aspect_ratio calculations (i.e., bigger numbers = bigger figures)
    * two numbers - an actual figure size in inches
* Pixel aspect ratio
  * aspect_ratio -- the aspect ratio of a pixel in the image (or of a unit square in data coordinates, for example).Â  The default here will change depending on the type of plot
    * 'equal' or 1 -- square pixels.Â  This will be the default for most things
    * 'auto' -- plot the given data limits in the given (or computed) figsize, filling the figure
    * number -- ratio of width to height (or height to width; I can't remember).Â  For plot() and list_plot(), this will default to giving a golden ratio aspect ratio
  * aspect_ratio_adjust -- what should we adjust to achieve the desired aspect ratio for the items drawn?Â  Note that by default, the axes limits are enlarged slightly; to eliminate this, set axes_pad=0
    * 'box' (default) -- the frame axes
    * 'datalim' -- the data limits

What do people think?

This ticket is still needs_work.Â  Remaining items include:

* Updating docs to reflect changes, including
  * Most aspect ratios now default to 1
  * new/changed options:
    * Â fig_tight 
    * the new definition of aspect_ratio (= 1/old definition)
    * aspect_ratio_adjustable
* Make [GraphicsArray](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/search/opensearch?q=wiki%3AGraphicsArray) work (likely using the nice features of matplotlib in 1.0 for doing multiple subplots!)

Warning: this patch changes the definition of aspect_ratio.Â  Before, it was width/height, but now it is height/width.Â  The new meaning is consistent with matplotlib and Mathematica.

Since the patch now changes a very fundamental thing about Sage (the meaning of aspect ratio), it probably should be put off until a major release.

Apparently this statement isn't true.  The old aspect_ratio and new aspect_ratio mean the same thing.  I was basing the statement on reading the docs.  Either the current docs are backwards, or I was misreading them.

So, in short, things are good to go for finishing this patch and getting it into Sage as soon as possible.

It seems to me that `set_aspect` ratio only accepts "auto" as a string input, while the proposal also lists "equal" as an option.

Would it be possible to extend the functionality so that it is possible to specify either only width or only height of the final figure? I am thinking of using it in conjunction with SageTeX, where it would be natural to ask either for `width=\textwidth` or `height=0.5\texthight` and have the second dimension determined automatically based on the actual plot and aspect ratio.

The problem with the `plot_field3d` turns out to be the following very bad behavior of plotting vectors after this patch 

```
sage: v = vector([1.,2.,3.])
sage: v.plot() # all is well
sage: plot(v) # passes in aspect_ratio to a 3d graphics, which already has such a thing, and get nasty traceback
```

The culprit was telling `plot_vector_field3d` to do `plot(v)` for each vector instead of `v.plot()` as it should have.  However, this exposes something else really dumb - namely, that `plot.py` turns vectors into tuples before it plots them

```
    from sage.structure.element import is_Vector
    if kwds.get('parametric',False) and is_Vector(funcs):
        funcs = tuple(funcs)


    if hasattr(funcs, 'plot'):
        G = funcs.plot(*args, **original_opts)
    # if we are using the generic plotting method
    else:
```

this presumably avoids the fact that

```
sage: w = vector([x^2,3,x^3])
sage: plot(w,(x,0,1))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                   
```

but still this is a problem.  So after fixing this issue, I'm opening a ticket for making vector plotting more sensible. 

I think this change might need review (?) so I'm setting to 'needs review'.

To buildbot and reviewer: apply trac_2100-aspect-ratio-rebase.patch and trac_2100-3d-vector.patch.  Depends on #7981, #8632, #10244, and #10143.

I am fine with the reviewer patch and I did take a look at a few (although definitely not all) plots in the documentation. Circles are finally circles!!!

I have also discovered the following behaviour which may be a bug:

sage: f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2 
sage: implicit_plot(f, (-3, 3), (-3, 3),fill=True).show(aspect_ratio=1)

```

The first line (with `fill=True`) completely fills the plot, not just the disk.

These are the only errors on the whole library. I guess they should be fixed in the same way as in the reviewer patch. Or maybe there should be a better fix?..

The correct fix is to remove that kwd from the plot when 

```

        if plot_type == 'arrow' or plot_type == 'point':
            dimension = len(coords)
            if dimension == 3:
                from sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2 import line3d, point3d
                
                if plot_type == 'arrow':
                    return line3d([(0,0,0), coords], arrow_head=True, **kwds)
                else:
                    return point3d(coords, **kwds)
```

that should do it.  I will try this later.

The problem is that this was never doctesting the thing in question in the first place because of the issues raised in #10638.  \n\nI *think* the issue is that `_extract_kwds_for_show` keeps the ``@`options` value of `aspect_ratio='auto') in play; when this gets passed to the `show()` method of `Line` (which is what `line3d` creates in this case), it refers to the one in `base.PrimitiveObject`, which unfortunately then puts this value of `aspect_ratio` in:\n\n```\n        opts = {}\n        opts.update(SHOW_DEFAULTS)\n        if self._extra_kwds is not None:\n            opts.update(self._extra_kwds)\n        opts.update(kwds)\n```\n\nand then doesn't realize it's a problem in\n\n```\n        if opts['frame_aspect_ratio'] == 'automatic':\n            if opts['aspect_ratio'] != 'automatic':\n                # Set the aspect_ratio of the frame to be the same as that of\n                # the object we are rendering given the aspect_ratio we'll use\n                # for it.\n                opts['frame_aspect_ratio'] = \\\n                    self._determine_frame_aspect_ratio(opts['aspect_ratio'])\n```\n\nWhich is where the problem happens.\n\nAlthough fixing this in the vector plotting didn't seem to work immediately.\n\nUnless we wanted to change all the 'auto' in this patch to 'automatic'.  I don't know if that is desirable either, though.  What do others think?",

I *think* the issue is that `_extract_kwds_for_show` keeps the ``@`options` value of `aspect_ratio='auto') in play; when this gets passed to the `show()` method of `Line` (which is what `line3d` creates in this case), it refers to the one in `base.PrimitiveObject`, which unfortunately then puts this value of `aspect_ratio` in:

```
        opts = {}
        opts.update(SHOW_DEFAULTS)
        if self._extra_kwds is not None:
            opts.update(self._extra_kwds)
        opts.update(kwds)
```

and then doesn't realize it's a problem in

```
        if opts['frame_aspect_ratio'] == 'automatic':
            if opts['aspect_ratio'] != 'automatic':
                # Set the aspect_ratio of the frame to be the same as that of
                # the object we are rendering given the aspect_ratio we'll use
                # for it.
                opts['frame_aspect_ratio'] = \
                    self._determine_frame_aspect_ratio(opts['aspect_ratio'])
```

Which is where the problem happens.

Although fixing this in the vector plotting didn't seem to work immediately.

Unless we wanted to change all the 'auto' in this patch to 'automatic'.  I don't know if that is desirable either, though.  What do others think?

Especially since in this case #11491 is so clearly much more trivial than this one, and also much older.    I'm sure Ryan and I would have agreed that this one was higher priority.

It is not easy for me to determine a priori which patches conflict with eachother, so what you propose isn't really possible.  It's not that I looked at both patches and decided which one to merge.  What happened is that I already decided to merge #11491 before I even considered the patch here.

Since the sage-devel discussion I mentioned, there is an agreement that once a patch is merged (even in a future alpha version), it should stay merged if possible.

Understood.

Yes, that definitely makes sense, as I hope I make clear above.  :)
