OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
```

This arises because `GEN` is by definition a (signed) `long *`.  It can be fixed by adding a function `set_uel(GEN x, long n, ulong z)` to the PARI interface, implemented as `uel(x, n) = z` in C (`uel` is an existing PARI macro, similar to `gel`).

It seems unlikely to be caused by this ticket. Are you merging any other PARI-related tickets?
