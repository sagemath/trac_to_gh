A lot of the important files are in the examples/js directory, for example, the Controls that we use for mouse interaction are in https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples/js/controls.  Device detection is in https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/Detector.js.  Perhaps we can save just the examples/js folder and delete everything else.

Actually, what I typically use is just the build/three.min.js, the OrbitControls from examples/js/controls, and the Detector.js from examples/js/Detector.js.

The wavefront obj loader will surely be useful, too. No need to go too barebones, just want to avoid 200 of megabytes of samples.

I don't see the harm in getting that in. No apparent hook anywhere for it yet either.
