I'm not sure that wrapping the `pi=...` option is useful, but if you want to do it, then I guess it should be tested...

This would have been inconvenient as the incomplete function has an extra argument (the point up to which you integrate).

I don't understand. I was thinking of something similar to

```
    def gamma(self, z=None):
        """
        Return the image of this ball by the Euler Gamma function (if
        ``z = None``) or the incomplete Gamma function (otherwise).

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: CBF(1, 1).gamma()
            [0.498015668118356 +/- 9.16e-16] + [-0.154949828301811 +/- 7.08e-16]*I
            sage: CBF(-1).gamma()
            nan
            sage: CBF(1, 1).gamma(0)
            [0.498015668118356 +/- 9.16e-16] + [-0.154949828301811 +/- 7.08e-16]*I
            sage: CBF(1, 1).gamma(100)

            sage: CBF(1, 1).gamma(CLF(i))

Indeed, that would have been a solution. On the plus side: less methods. On the minus side: less consistent with arb names... I don't have a strong opinion.
