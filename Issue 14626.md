# Issue 14626: Convergent series on ultrametric discs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: caruso

Original creation time: 2013-06-26 16:51:54

Assignee: roed

Keywords: padics series

This patch implements various rings of convergent series on discs over ultrametric fields (that is padics fields or Laurent series fields).

The documentation is not written yet (it's why I leave the status of this ticket as need_works); if somebody wants to collaborate and help me to write this documentation, he is of course welcome!

An inline demo of the functionalities provided by this patch is available here: https://cethop.math.cnrs.fr:8443/home/pub/6/
