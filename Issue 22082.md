CC:  @jdemeyer @videlec

Keywords: PARI, coercion, rd3

Pari integers cannot be used to index lists:

```
sage: [1,2][pari(1)]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-f2823fec0752> in <module>()
----> 1 [Integer(1),Integer(2)][pari(Integer(1))]

TypeError: list indices must be integers, not sage.libs.cypari2.gen.Gen
```

With this ticket

```
sage: [1,2][pari(1)]
2
```

Incidentally, this also fixes `pow`

```
sage: 1^pari(1)
1
```
