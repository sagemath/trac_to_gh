CC:  @jdemeyer @tscrim

For instances of Cython classes, the inheritance from categories is
emulated by a manual lookup in
`sage.structure.element.Element.__getattr__`. This lookup is about 10
times slower than a normal method lookup::


```
sage: def foo(self): return
sage: Sets().element_class.foo = foo

sage: def g(x):
....:     for i in range(1000):
....:          x.foo()

sage: x = Semigroups().example().an_element()
sage: %timeit g(x)
10000 loops, best of 3: 115 Âµs per loop

sage: x = 1
sage: %timeit g(x)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.18 ms per loop
```


So there should be room for optimization (or using a different
approach for emulating this inheritance).

First step: profiling ...

Aargh....... this whole "category lookup" mechanism is causing me so much frustration with #20767. It is a very fragile hack which just happens to work correctly in the current setting but when you change anything in the coercion model it breaks.

I am starting to think we should reconsider the whole category approach.

In #20767, I "solved" the category problem (see [comment:47]) in the following way:

- double-underscore methods (e.g. `__add__`) are never taken from the category.

- anything deriving directly from `Element` fully supports single-underscore methods (e.g. `_add_`) from the category.

- anything deriving from `ModuleElement`, `RingElement`,... has only partial support for single-underscore methods from the category.

- nothing changes for non-arithmetic methods (e.g. `base_ring`).

The above rules do not break any existing usage of categories. I hope you can live with this...

The last patchbot report was green, so this must be a recently-introduced problem.

Interestingly, these failures are for classes inheriting from `CategoryObject` but not `Parent`.

Those failures are true bugs in `HochschildComplex` and `IntegrableRepresentation`: they pretend to be in some category but do not actually implement everything needed to be in that category. This ticket causes the category tests to be run (which is good) but then the tests fail.


```
sage: SGA = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: T = SGA.trivial_representation()
sage: H = SGA.hochschild_complex(T)
sage: H in CommutativeAdditiveGroups()
True
sage: H.zero()
...
TypeError: 'HochschildComplex' object is not callable
```


and


```
sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',3,1]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[1]+Lambda[2]+Lambda[3])
sage: V in CommutativeAdditiveGroups()
True
sage: V.zero()
...
TypeError: 'IntegrableRepresentation' object is not callable
```


I think the right thing to do here is to mark those tests as `# known bug`.
