The indices method of the KBoundedSubspace class is done wrong. The code is:

```
self.indices = ConstantFunction(Partitions(NonNegativeIntegers(), max_part=k))
```

Partitions is not meant to take a set. It will usually complain if you input something like NonNegativeIntegers but due to a bug in partitions, it allows it if you have optional arguments.

This creates the following bugs when playing around with k-Schur functions:

```
sage: ks = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).kBoundedSubspace(3,1).kschur()
sage: f = ks[2,1]
sage: f.coefficient(f.support()[0])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    482         if hasattr(C, "element_class") and not isinstance(m, C.element_class):
    483             m = C(m)

As far as I can tell, Travis' changes to Partitions may fix this bug.  I am adding him as cc on this ticket. There are currently still conflicts between the symmetric functions and Partitions.  Perhaps they are resolved it is possible that they will fix this problem so he can take this into account as he writes his patch.  So for instance after I apply Travis' patch trac_13605-partition_options-ts.patch I have:

```
    sage: ks = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).kBoundedSubspace(3,1).kschur()
    sage: f = ks([2,1])
    sage: f.coefficient(f.support()[0])
    1
```

However the same patch currently causes a different problem with symmetric functions:

```

sage: ks[2,1]

    301                 assert len(rest) == 0
    302             else:

TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a class, type, or tuple of classes and types
```

Travis, was it your intention to allow `Partitions( NonNegativeIntegers(), max_part=k )` to represent the set of all Partitions with max_part=k?

I'll go through now and scrub all instances of `Partition_class` from the sage code so you can adequately test to see if the patch (unintentionally) fixes this problem.

> Travis, was it your intention to allow `Partition( NonNegativeInteger(), max_part=k )` to represent the set of all Partitions with max_part=k?


Do you mean `Partitions(NonNegativeIntegers(), max_part=k)` with the `s`'s? If so, this has some quirks noted in the wierdness page. However, if you mean exactly what you wrote, then I believe that should raise an exception since `Partition()` should return a single partition, although maybe with that input, one should get a random partition with max part `k`...

Second, your set

Found another bug which is really related to this one. If we give an input to a kSchur function which isn't k-bounded, then it should return an error:

```
ks = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).kBoundedSubspace(3,1).kschur()
ks([4,1])

TypeError: do not know how to make x (= [4, 1]) an element of self

```
