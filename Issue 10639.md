# Issue 10639: Use execv() instead of Subprocess.call() in sage-run

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2011-01-26 14:38:46

Keywords: sage-run interrupt execve

`sage-run` runs `.sage` files from the command line.  The problem is that pressing `CTRL-C` interrupts the `sage-run` process, but the child process (doing the actual computation) might still continue.  This is very annoying because after this, there is absolutely no way to interrupt the still-running `sage`.

Jeroen clarified by email that this happens if the called script catches KeyboardInterrupt and doesn't quit.

Looks good, and fixes the problem. Positive review.
