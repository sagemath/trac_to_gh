1. Generic stuff like processing the `parent` should be done by the base class (matrix0.Matrix in this case) instead of by each derived class individually.

2. In some cases, `__cinit__` calls `__init__` of the base class. That is really backwards and should never be needed!

This is a requirement for #23719.

Does this also imply a positive review of the dependency #25511?

Only in the sense that #25511 works as it is suppose to by the doctests and the code looks okay. Hmm...I guess I am saying that aren't I?
