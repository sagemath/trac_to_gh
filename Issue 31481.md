This ticket proposes to change some methods that currently return lists to generators - like the method `open_supersets` added in #31677. This is in line with the changes in the Python standard library when we moved from Python 2 to 3.

`ManifoldSubset`:
- `open_covers()` currently returns a list of lists
  - change to generator of `FiniteManifoldSubsetFamily` instances 

- `subsets()` currently returns a `frozenset`
  - change to generator of `ManifoldSubset` instances

`Manifold`:
- `top_charts()` currently returns a list
  - change to generator of charts
- `coord_changes()` currently returns a copy
  - change to generator of pairs `((from, to), map)` ... so that `dict(M.coord_changes())` will create the copy

I assume it has a purpose, but just out of curiosity: why do you make a difference between families of manifold objects and families of manifold subsets? Do you have a further usage in mind other than just subsets? Because all the examples you provide are still with subsets.

Yes, in #31732 I use `ManifoldObjectFiniteFamily` directly for the family of open covers. Its elements are `ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily` instances.

I agree that charts/frames are likely to benefit from becoming finite families too. This will also need a separate subclass because they are indexed not by names but by coordinate tuples.

Right. But don't you think it should rather be a new common parent class both inherit from?

In any case, this is something definitely need, indeed!

Sure, let's do that when we introduce some more applications to families.

Let's take this discussion to #31720 (Manifold: Change some methods to generators), which introduces generators for charts. Families could be introduced in the same ticket -- but I will need some guidance there what the keys should be.
