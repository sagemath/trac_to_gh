In `sage/libs/linbox/linbox.pxd` we currently have two classes that gives an interface for dense integer matrix (`Linbox_integer_dense`) and sparse matrix over Z/nZ (`Linbox_modn_sparse`). These interfaces are then used in different matrix implementations in `sage/matrix/`.

This task ticket stands for improvement of the linbox interface

- moving the implementation directly in `sage/matrix` without the intermediate Cython classes
- more documentation and testing
- support for other matrix types (e.g. sparse integer matrix)
- expose more algorithms (e.g. solving)

I just noticed that there was a previous attempt to clean the interface in #21327 by C. Bouillaguet.
