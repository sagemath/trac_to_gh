# Issue 10425: line() does not accept iterators

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10478

Original creator: ddrake

Original creation time: 2010-12-15 02:44:48

Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: line plot iterator

The `line()` function fails when given an iterator:

```
sage: line(iter([(0,0), (1,0), (2,2)]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
[...]
/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/plot/plot.pyc in xydata_from_point_list(points)
   2529             pass
   2530     
-> 2531     if len(points)>0 and len(list(points[0]))!=2:
   2532         raise ValueError, "points must have 2 coordinates in a 2d line"
   2533 

TypeError: object of type 'listiterator' has no len()
```

Here's a patch which corrects the problem, but on my test machine, I'm getting doctest errors in `shapes2.py` just like those reported at #9088:

```

That ticket got merged and it doesn't look like anyone fixed those doctests, but they haven't been failing...so I'm not sure what's going on.

I'm marking this as "needs review" because it is ready for review -- I hope someone can explain the above test failures so I can fix them.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

The doctest failures are due to an internal counter used for uniqification. You can just change them to the new output, or "texture..."

New patch up; I just used the new values for the textures to fix the doctests. Please review.
