Keywords: line plot iterator

The `line()` function fails when given an iterator:

```
sage: line(iter([(0,0), (1,0), (2,2)]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

   2532         raise ValueError, "points must have 2 coordinates in a 2d line"

Here's a patch which corrects the problem, but on my test machine, I'm getting doctest errors in `shapes2.py` just like those reported at #9088:

```

That ticket got merged and it doesn't look like anyone fixed those doctests, but they haven't been failing...so I'm not sure what's going on.
