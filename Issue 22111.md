CC:  @jm58660

This violates the `Poset()` constructor: there is no `1` element:

```
L=LatticePoset({0:['a','b','c'], 'a':[1], 'b':[1], 'c':[1]})
```

(example from `src/sage/combinat/posets/lattices.py` line 1593)

Example could be better, but I can't see a real bug. It will test that `'a'` and `'b'` really are complements.

Before there was bug on `LatticePoset({'a':'b'}).complements()`, see #17138.

This is not at all about complements. It's about the meaning of the constructor

```
LatticePoset({0:['a','b','c'], 'a':[1], 'b':[1], 'c':[1]})
```


Where does the `1` come from? Is this just an abbreviation of

```
LatticePoset({0:['a','b','c'], 'a':[1], 'b':[1], 'c':[1], 1:[]})
```


I was getting doctest failures (in a different ticket #22029) with this doctest and the missing `1` is confusing me.

Yes. More interesting example is converting


```
Poset( ([1,2,3], [[2,3],[3,4]]) )
```


to


```
Poset( ([3], [[2,3],[3,4]]) )
```


Removing `2` does nothing. but removing `1` does, as only elements uncomparable to all others need to be specified at the element list. Sometimes I think if we should change this.

DiGraph constructor has an example

`DiGraph({1:[2,3,4],3:[4]})` -- return a digraph by associating to each vertex the list of its out-neighbors.

It is not `DiGraph({1:[2,3,4],3:[4],2:[],3:[]})`. Should we change that too? I think that nothing needs to be change. Isn't it clear that list of upper covers `{1:[2],2:[3]}` means that `3` has no upper covers?

But in both cases I think that the documentation needs no clarification. I think it is natural and clear not to excplicitly say that an element has no upper covers.

Hence I suggest this to be closed as wontfix.

It is not necessary, we could have a more complicated wrapper for that. And actually we already can create a digraph from a dig6 string, but it is not possible for poset.

I think it does need clarification. Maybe you are so used to it that it is obvious to you, but that doesn't mean that it's obvious to everybody.
