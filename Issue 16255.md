Keywords: unital nonassociative algebras, coercion

In #16055, I was trying to create a unital "magmatic" algebra `A` and pass a base ring to `Parent`. This then tries to setup the default coercion from the base ring to `A`, which fails because `A` is not in `Rings()`.

```
sage: from sage.categories.magmatic_algebras import MagmaticAlgebras
sage: class A(Parent):
....:     def __init__(self, R):
....:         Parent.__init__(self, base=R, category=MagmaticAlgebras(R).Unital())
....:         
sage: A(QQ)

So I'm thinking we should have a new category for unital associative algebras which sets up this coercion and the non-associative variety not. Comments?

Ah, interesting: there can be situations where it's perfectly legitimate to want to define a morphism in a category C with a codomain that does not belong to C. Maybe we just want to add a "force=True" argument to reduce the sanity checks in those cases where the caller knows what he is doing. And reciprocally, we should better take into account the axioms of the domain in the case at hand.

Fun topic for an upcoming brainstorm in any cases!

It looks like this may be solved by #19225.

I do not think #19225 is the solution. I think the problem is the lack of a proper category for nonassociative rings and rngs for the corresponding `Hom`, which is still a problem even with #19225.

Why is it a problem?  The change in #19225 that fixes this particular error is replacing `Rings()` by `Sets()`; this doesn't break anything as far as I can see.  

Of course, if you really want you can use something like `MagmasAndAdditiveMagmas().Distributive().AdditiveAssociative().AdditiveCommutative().AdditiveUnital().AdditiveInverse().Unital()` for the `Hom` set, but then perhaps the next type of object someone wants to create may not have additive inverses, for example.
