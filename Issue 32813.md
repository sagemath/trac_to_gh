This could have something to do with the version if giac. It doesn't hang for me with 1.7.0.13 (not the latest, but newer than the SPKG).

That's perfectly possible, i'm on 1.7.0-45 currently. Unfortunately older versions no longer build here so I can't verify.

This is being investigated in #33161
