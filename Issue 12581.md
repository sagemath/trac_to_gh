Assignee: bhutz

Keywords: is_PrimeField import

K.<t>=GF(13)

is_PrimeField(K) 

causes:

ImportError: No module named finite_field.constructor 


There is already a function is_PrimeFiniteField.

Also, the module should be: sage.rings.finite_rings.constructor

I'll fix this.

Fixed the import error.

Added documentation and examples to the function.

Also, noticed that is_PrimeField() returned TRUE for QQ. This is not correct. Updated the function to return TRUE only when the field is a prime field (GF(p))

I'm sorry, but "prime field" does *not* mean "field of finite prime order". That's why there's a separate function ` is_PrimeFiniteField()`. A prime field is a field that is equal to its own prime subfield, i.e. **either** a finite prime field or QQ.

I agree that the function should not return an ImportError -- this is a consequence of rearrangements in the finite fields code since the function was written -- but it should be kept as originally designed, returning True when the input field is equal to its own prime subfield.

From your patch:

```
	    INPUT: 
	        - R - a ring or field 
	 
	    OUTPUT: 
	        - TRUE - if R is QQ or a finite field GF(p) for p prime. 
	        - FALSE - otherwise 
```


This isn't correct ReST formatting (building this will give a warning about "unexpected indent"). Moreover Python's booleans are ` True / False `, not ` TRUE / FALSE ` (it's rude to shout :-) So it would be better as

```
    INPUT:
 
    - R - a ring or field 
 
    OUTPUT: 

    - True - if R is `\QQ` or a finite field `GF(p)` for p prime. 
    - False - otherwise 
```

Note the blank line after the list headings, no extra indentation (not needed for bulleted lists), and the backticks for LaTeX formulae (``\QQ`` is a predefined macro).

Sorry to torture you so much over one tiny (and deprecated!) function...

Attachment

No problem. I figured the first thing I tried to fix in Sage should be something simple so I can learn the devel process and the trac system, etc.

For example, when I uploaded the new patch this time I neglected to check the overwrite box and now I can't delete the old patch.

trac_12753_is_PrimeField.2.patch  - is the correct patch, ignore the first one.

Looks good to me. I'll bump up the priority to "major" -- it may be a tiny fix, but if the priority is low the patchbot will ignore it. If patchbot says it passes doctests, then we can set it to positive review.

It's better to set positive_review directly, otherwise you'll forget about it...
