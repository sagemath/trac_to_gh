CC:  dicolevrai

Keywords: manifold, coordinate chart

This is OK:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart("x y:(0,1)")
sage: assumptions()
[x is real, y is real, y > 0, y < 1]
```
while this is bad:

```
sage: forget()
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: a = var('a'); assume(a>0)
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart("x y:(0,a)")
sage: assumptions()
[a > 0, x is real, y is real, y > 0]
```
The constraint `y < a` is not included in the assumption list, contrary to `y < 1` in the first example. The origin of the bug is 

```
sage: bool(a != Infinity)
False
```
This is corrected by changing the tests `xmin != -Infinity` and `xmax != Infinity` to respectively `not (xmin == -Infinity)` and `not (xmax == Infinity)` in `sage.manifolds.chart.RealChart._init_coordinates`.
