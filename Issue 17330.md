For some operations it's useful to write a cross product between two vectors as a matrix times vector (or vector times matrix) linear transformation. Of course, this is most useful in those situations where the cross product isn't multiplied straight away, but the matrix is used on its own.

One application that I know of is when intersecting a conic with a line using projective geometry. There, conjugating the matrix of the conic with the cross product matrix of the line results in a degenerate conic which factors into the points of intersection. But I've heard that there are applications in 3D computer graphics as well, where this is known as the [hat operator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat_operator#Cross_product).

The simplest implementation would be something like this:


```
def cross_product_matrix(v):
    return matrix([e.cross_product(v) for e in v.parent().basis()])
```


It satisfies these conditions:


```
cross_product_matrix(v)*w == v.cross_product(w)
w*cross_product_matrix(v) == w.cross_product(v)
```


But I guess it would be better to implement this as a method of `FreeModuleElement`. I'm not sure whether it would be better to access the basis as I did above, or whether it would be preferable to hard-code the matrix layout, both for the sake of performance and because it ensures we don't depend on the basis.

A few comments. Please remove the `self` as input, it's not considered as such. I would also consider using the `:wikipedia:`Hat_operator#Cross_product`` in the documentation.

A bit more substantial, I would instead check the rank by `self.parent().rank()` and define `s` inside of each of the 2 cases. This is a slight speed penalty in the general ring case, but for `ZZ`, which always copies the list, this could result in a big speedup:

```
sage: m = (ZZ^4).random_element()
sage: %timeit len(m.list(copy=False))
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.39 µs per loop
sage: %timeit m.parent().rank()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 955 ns per loop
sage: m = (QQ['t']^4).random_element()
sage: %timeit len(m.list(copy=False))
1000000 loops, best of 3: 791 ns per loop
sage: m = (ZZ^20).random_element()
sage: %timeit len(m.list(copy=False))
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.03 µs per loop
```

Plus this is more robust if the behavior is changed to mimic `ZZ` (i.e., it always copies the elements). I might also consider adding the definition of `R` and `zero` inside of the 2 cases as well, but that is a definite micro-optimization.

Somewhat of a side note, constructing the basis might be an expensive operation. So if you don't really need it, then let's stay away from using it.

Nice little patch; looks good otherwise.

I was copying the approach from `cross_product`. The case where the operation is not defined will be rarely used, so I see no point optimizing for that.

In that case, we might want to consider avoiding that list `s` altogether, and using `self[i]` directly instead. Not sure how that compares performance-wise. Whatever choice we make, there is little reason to handle `cross_product_matrix` different from `cross_product`. Should I adapt my patch to avoid the list for both cases?

While I agree that one can gain little from a description like “`self` is any object of the class we're talking about here”, the case at hand is somewhat different, since there are extra requirements for that object.

Considered it, and tried it out. But in the HTML text the hash (anchor separator) looks ugly, and if I try to use it in the link target annotation it doesn't work at all.

> A bit more substantial, I would instead check the rank by `self.parent().rank()` and define `s` inside of each of the 2 cases.

As I said, I'm not optimizing for the case where the operation is not defined, and in the other two cases we need the `s` array sooner or later, so it might as well be sooner.

> for `ZZ`, which always copies the list, this could result in a big speedup

The only way to avoid this list copy for the cases of rank 3 or 7 is by doing element access on `self` instead of a (possibly copied) list of entries. I did some comparison, my implementation against one (called `cross_product_matrix2`) which replaces every occurrence of `s[i]` by `self[i]`, does not set `s` at all, and uses `self.parent().rank()` (cached to a variable) instead of `len(s)` for case distinction. The difference is neglible, but slightly in favor of my code as it is here, with the array copy.


```
sage: m = (ZZ^3).random_element()
sage: %timeit m.cross_product_matrix()
10000 loops, best of 3: 166 µs per loop
sage: %timeit m.cross_product_matrix2()
10000 loops, best of 3: 169 µs per loop
sage: m = (ZZ^7).random_element()
sage: %timeit m.cross_product_matrix2()
1000 loops, best of 3: 187 µs per loop
sage: %timeit m.cross_product_matrix()
10000 loops, best of 3: 182 µs per loop
```


> Plus this is more robust if the behavior is changed to mimic `ZZ` (i.e., it always copies the elements). I might also consider adding the definition of `R` and `zero` inside of the 2 cases as well, but that is a definite micro-optimization.

Same argument as above: we'll need them in either of the defined cases, so let's share.

> Somewhat of a side note, constructing the basis might be an expensive operation. So if you don't really need it, then let's stay away from using it.

Glad you see it this way as well.

Could I convince you? Will you give this a positive review even if I don't change anything?

Most (all?) of that is in legacy code, and unfortunately, I recall this discussion happening on a trac ticket and I don't remember which one. To me, the requirements are clear both from the preceding paragraph and the error message.

> The only way to avoid this list copy for the cases of rank 3 or 7 is by doing element access on `self` instead of a (possibly copied) list of entries. I did some comparison, my implementation against one (called `cross_product_matrix2`) which replaces every occurrence of `s[i]` by `self[i]`, does not set `s` at all, and uses `self.parent().rank()` (cached to a variable) instead of `len(s)` for case distinction. The difference is neglible, but slightly in favor of my code as it is here, with the array copy.

It's slightly interesting to me that the copy of the list is slower than the overhead of the `__getitem__`. However for sparse vectors, I noticed a clear slowdown by not using the list.

I ended up getting ~10% speedup by using a direct call to `MatrixSpace`:

```
sage: m = (ZZ^7).random_element()
sage: %timeit m.cross_product_matrix()
1000 loops, best of 3: 507 µs per loop
```

Before:

```
sage: %timeit m.cross_product_matrix()
1000 loops, best of 3: 552 µs per loop
```

I also used the `self.parent().rank()` and put the creation of both the matrix space and getting the list inside each of the 2 statements because creating a parent can be a (relatively) expensive operation and same for the list. It's an extra 2 lines of (simple) code that could result in a major speedup in case someone was trying to call this method on a long vector and was catching the thrown error.

I would argue for `TypeError` actually. In Sage, `TypeError` is usually given for objects from the wrong parent. For example

```
sage: vector([1,2]) + vector([1,2,3])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': 'Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring' and 'Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring'
```
