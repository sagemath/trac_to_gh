Should we really? We had those conversations in the last few weeks. Do we really want to add tests to sage about bugs in upstream packages? No, if anything the test belongs to the upstream package. This is a case in point and adding a test to sage is scope creep.

For what it's worth, with this branch I get two failures when I do `sage -f -c igraph` on OS X Mojave:

```
...
124: Merging layouts 2 (igraph_i_layout_merge):      FAILED (layout.at:62)
...
241: SCG of a graph, stochastic matrix (igraph_scg) : FAILED (scg.at:73)

2 tests were skipped.

```

The previous version of `igraph` failed two other (?) tests, so I don't think the new failures should necessarily be an obstacle for a positive review. Failures from old version:

```
...
 25: Sparse matrix, solvers (igraph_sparsemat_t):    FAILED (types.at:148)
...
