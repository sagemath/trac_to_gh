The preferred style in Sage documentation is for Sphinx directives to be in upper case: `.. NOTE::` rather than `.. note::`, for example. We should document this.

This may conflict with #22178. That's easy enough to fix once we're sure #22178 has stabilized.

I doubt #22178 will change any more, but it will be a trivial fix if git doesn't automatically handle the merge.

PDF docs don't build:

Oops, there was a missing backquote. Should be fixed now.

See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5464627/how-to-have-same-text-in-two-links-with-restructured-text 

Apparently you need two underscores instead of one in 

```
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/rest.html#citations>`_
```

I am guessing in both occurrence of that particular string.

Both citations should point to the same place, so I've changed their targets instead.
