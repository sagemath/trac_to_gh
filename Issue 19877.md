`algebraic_topological_model.py` contains help classes and functions for computing (co)homology of simplicial complexes; in particular, the cup product for the cohomology ring. As such, it contains the main bottlenecks for these computations and should be cythonized.

Okay, here is the cythonized version. However, from some testing, I did not get any speedup. I'm posting this here if it might have been from my lack of cython skills. The other thing to do would be to do some heavy-duty profiling, but I don't know how much we will get from cythonization of ATM.

I agree, I don't see much if any speedup. Maybe in our previous work, we already pushed the main bottlenecks into matrix code?

At least 60% of the time for RP4 is taken up in the vector/matrix multiplications (I love %lprun). So I don't think it is worth the extra compile time by cythonizing this and setting this to invalid.
