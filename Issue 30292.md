# Issue 30292: Use reference instead of pointer to simplify code

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30529

By using a reference to a structure the code is much better to read.

Instead of `structptr[0].newfaces[structptr[0].current_dimension-1]` we now have `structure.newfaces[structure.current_dimension-1]`.

If you could just rebase the branch to clean up the history a bit, then you can set a positive review.
