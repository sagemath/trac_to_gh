Several files should be linked with `gmp`, but are not since Linux is very forgiving about this. Cygwin is much more picky...

Given #15410 and #17767, it seems that it is better to specify the libraries directly in the `pyx` files instead of `module_list.py`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17962
