# Issue 17725: Fix sublinking issues

Several files should be linked with `gmp`, but are not since Linux is very forgiving about this. Cygwin is much more picky...

Given #15410 and #17767, it seems that it is better to specify the libraries directly in the `pyx` files instead of `module_list.py`.

I didn't test on Cygwin, but the changes look sensible.
