The master branch of Normaliz has just been upgraded to Flint 2.7.0 and e-antic 0.1.9.

There are additional improvements in Normaliz, originally made to sped up the use of e-antic 1.0.0. But they also speed up the use of 0.1.9.

LGTM.

However, I can't install flint 2.7.1. to actually test whether this works.

The upgrade itself works smoothly and normaliz is still running fine with it.
