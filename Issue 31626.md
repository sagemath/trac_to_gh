This builds for me but it doesn't seem to work:

```
sage: integral(sin(x), x, algorithm='fricas')
```

hangs. `fricas` does start when I use the Sage shell, or when I explicitly run `local/bin/fricas`.

this works for me. Perhaps you need to run `source .homebrew-build-env` before starting Sage?

I quit Sage and restarted, and now things are working. The `src/sage/interfaces/fricas.py` doctests pass, too. Maybe the first time the FriCAS process got hung up once and then never recovered, so every call to `fricas("1+1")` hung.

Things aren't perfect, but no need to hold up this ticket. If I start Sage and run `integral(sin(x), x, algorithm='fricas')`, and then immediately hit ctrl-C, then running `integral(sin(x), x, algorithm='fricas')` again fails:
