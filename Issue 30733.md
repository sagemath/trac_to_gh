Keywords: plot, point

In Sage 9.2.beta3, the following code

```
sage: f(x) = x + 1                                                                                  
sage: point((0, f(0)), size=60)                                                                     
```

results in a plot with two points located at (0,0) and (1,0), instead of a single point at (0,1).
Both

```
sage: point([(0, f(0))], size=60)
```

and 

```
sage: point([(0, RR(f(0)))], size=60)
```

give the correct result.

Sage 9.2 is free from this bug; it might have been introduced in #16804, which has been merged in Sage 9.3.beta2.

This is failue of the code

```
    elif l == 2:  # special case for a single 2D point
        if all(isinstance(z, numbers.Real) for z in points):
            points = [points]  
```

Specifically, for `l = (0, f(0))` and `z = f(0)`, `isinstance(z, numbers.Real)` gives `False`. Is the condition `z in RR` better alternative?

`z in RR` would seem more natural. On the other hand, we have

```
sage: f(x) = x + 1

This is only superficial. The code behind `z in RR` (see `RR.__contains__??`) does not do much for expressions.

Right. Even `not bool(complex(z).imag)` is slightly faster.
