Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Still needs review. Matthias, I'm happy with your changes - if that is sufficient, feel free to set it to positive review.

does not work with #31577 and #32036 - not sure which one to blame.

With this plus #32036, the Sage library fails to build for me:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/sage-9.4.beta3/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/setup.py", line 79, in <module>

    from sage.misc.lazy_attribute import lazy_attribute
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sage.misc.lazy_attribute'
```

(I don't think that #31577 is involved.)

Or maybe it is, on another machine I'm seeing the same error with #31577 + #31385, but not #32036.

Maybe these previous posts are red herrings, and the problem is this ticket doesn't work with the latest beta.

Thanks for testing it -- I'll revisit it after the next beta

The following seems to fix it for me, but I don't know if it's a good and/or safe change:

They are fine with me. Setting this to positive review as it seems that everyone reviewed everyone else's changes.

Yes, looks good to me. Thanks!

`sage --standard`, `sage --optional` and `sage --experimental` are broken in 9.5.beta6 (9 doctests failing in cmdline.py with `--optional=sage,internet`). Maybe this was caused by the changes made here. I created ticket #32885.
