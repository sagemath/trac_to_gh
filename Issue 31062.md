CC:  slelievre tscrim

Keywords: hypergeometric

as follows

```
sage: var('a,b,n')
( a, b, n )
sage: A=hypergeometric([-n,a],[b],1)
sage: assume(n, 'integer')
sage: assume(n > 0)
sage: A.simplify_hypergeometric()
    n
(-1) ⋅RisingFactorial(a - b - n + 1, n)
───────────────────────────────────────
	    pochhammer(b, n)
```

Note that sage does neither have symbolic functions `RisingFactorial` nor `pochhammer`. It does have a function "rising_factorial".

There is a sub-problem:

```
sage: jacobi_P(n, b, a, 1)
RisingFactorial(b + 1, n)
─────────────────────────
	    n!
```

We need to register something somewhere...

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.expression import register_symbol
sage: register_symbol(rising_factorial, {'maxima': 'pochhammer'})
sage: d=maxima('pochhammer(x,y)')
sage: SR(d)
gamma(x + y)/gamma(x)
```


And then one stumbles on the fact that `rising_factorial` is not a symbolic function:

```
sage: var('n')
sage: assume(n, 'integer')
sage: assume(n > 0)
sage: rising_factorial(6,n)
BOOM
```


Maybe this should not test `a.is_integer()` but `a in ZZ` ?

I feel like it would be better to represent it as a ratio of Gamma functions considering how they appear in hypergeometric functions. Granted, it is a bit more computationally intensive for real x and integer n, but it allows the most general input. Plus it is consistent with Maxima in comment:4.
