I don't have a problem with removing - just curious why it's obsolete, since presumably it was to detect things like Mac `.DS_Store` files or upstream binary files or something.  Does the git transition and reorganization of the files make this unnecessary?

Essentially yes. The Sage tarball is made in a much better way than it used to be, using `git` indeed.
