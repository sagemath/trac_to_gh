I don't have a problem with removing - just curious why it's obsolete, since presumably it was to detect things like Mac `.DS_Store` files or upstream binary files or something.  Does the git transition and reorganization of the files make this unnecessary?

Essentially yes. The Sage tarball is made in a much better way than it used to be, using `git` indeed.

I'm happy with this, but I'd feel more comfortable if William said "go for it", since I think he's one of the only people who ever really used it...

That should even be an extra indication that it can be removed...

Go for it!  The project that required this functionality is over.

Awesome.  Let me just check this merges, though given the author I have no doubts :)
