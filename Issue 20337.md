Since recently, we are using more of the upstream version of `autodoc`. This also has some code to remove hexadecimal address (see #19858) but the regular expression is too strict. This can easily be fixed, see https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/2534.

If it is good enough for upstream it is good enough for sage.

For the record - no `sphinx` update to 1.4.2 or 1.4.3, some changes have been made to latex generation upstream and it is a bit of a mess. I and someone from scikit-learn are involved in trying to fix it. On the positive side we should be able to drop a patch after the next release.

Wouldn't that imply positive_review? :-)
