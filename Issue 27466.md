Keywords: vector calculus, Euclidean space

This ticket adds a new tutorial regarding vector calculus in Euclidean planes, in the *Thematic Tutorials* section of the documentation. 

The tutorial is divived in six parts. The first three ones regard vector calculus in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space **E**<sup>3</sup> in a given coordinate system (respectively Cartesian, spherical and cylindrical coordinates). The fourth part is devoted to changes between the above three coordinate systems. The fifth part presents some advanced aspects, namely the treatment of  **E**<sup>3</sup> as a Riemannian manifold. Finally, the last part is devoted to 2-dimensional vector calculus, using both Cartesian and polar coordinates in the Euclidean plane  **E**<sup>2</sup> , and combines various features of the first five parts. 

A preview of the tutorial is available [here](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/thematic_tutorials/vector_calculus.html).

So I would say the "What's next" sections are unnecessary considering the table of contents and the next links.

I think it would be good to have some more pictures in part 4, in particular, showing how the two coordinate systems interact.

Do you want to talk at all about integration along curves or determining geodesics?

How difficult would it be to add another tutorial discussing things on a (2D) torus? I think a slightly more non-trivial example than **R**<sup>3</sup> would be beneficial.

Actually, overall I felt that there was no message being conveyed. Just the tutorial outlining what things you can do, rather than, say, trying to answer a particular question. I do think it is useful to have one tutorial about the things you can do on a particular object, but I think  given the code samples already in the docstrings, this is not currently saying much more. Perhaps what I am suggesting is to think of this as something you would point a new student/researcher to who did not know the theory as a way to give them a starting point.

OK, I'll remove them.

OK.

I think this is out of the scope of this tutorial, which is *elementary* vector calculus, in the meaning of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus

This would certainly be interesting but in a separate tutorial. Again, the present one is devoted to elementary vector calculus (probably this should be stressed in the introduction to the tutorial), for which the arena is **E**<sup>3</sup>.

> Actually, overall I felt that there was no message being conveyed. Just the tutorial outlining what things you can do, rather than, say, trying to answer a particular question. 

Agreed. This tutorial presents some tools and is not answering to any precise mathematical question. 

>I do think it is useful to have one tutorial about the things you can do on a particular object, but I think  given the code samples already in the docstrings, this is not currently saying much more. 

Agreed. All the information in the tutorial is already in the reference manual, but scattered over various places. For instance, many methods are described in the manifold section or in the tensor field one, not in the vector field section. I have the feeling that a newcomer to Sage will first jump on tutorials rather than explore the reference manual.

>Perhaps what I am suggesting is to think of this as something you would point a new student/researcher to who did not know the theory as a way to give them a starting point.

Indeed, this tutorial assumes the reader knows already about Euclidean spaces and elementary vector calculus. It is not an introduction to the subject, but to the vector calculus tools available in Sage.

Thank you. I think it is looking much better. There are just a few minor points below to address:

A point on linking. Anything that is in the global namespace can be linked, so you can do :func:`EuclideanSpace()`. For other things you want to have explicitly linked, you can use the `:foo:`~sage.path.to.object.Bar`. However, I would not do this for the methods like `display()`.

You do not need the `:math:` here either. (In fact, I am not sure there are any of these left in the library codebase.)

You can compactify the source a little, which IMO is easier to read:

```diff
-Let us denote by ``cartesian`` the chart of Cartesian coordinates:
-
-::
+Let us denote by ``cartesian`` the chart of Cartesian coordinates::
```


A minor grammatical point: The topic names are good, but they are not strictly questions. It is more of they are answering a question, and subsequently should not have a question mark `?`. (I know that it is correct to ask questions in this way, but it comes across as very awkward to me as a native (American) English speaker.)

Yes I know. Actually, these `:math:` have been automatically generated by the export to `reST` of the Jupyter notebooks from which I started. I've suppressed them in the commit above.

Again, this placement of `::` was generated by the `reST` export of Jupyter. I've replaced it with the standard end-of-text version.

Done in the above commit. 

I've also made some minor corrections and have updated the [preview](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/thematic_tutorials/vector_calculus.html).
