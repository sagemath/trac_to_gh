As the title says ! Another one of Julian R. Abel's tricks `;-)`

This one was... Painful to implement `:-P`

Just comments about my commit (at `u/vdelecroix/16528`)

Why if it is precomputed you do the extra check

```
for B in BIBD:
    len_trace = sum(x in hyperoval for x in B)
    assert len_trace == 0 or len_trace == 2
```

(commented in my commit)

I replaced the ugly `Matrix[x].dict().keys()` by `M.nonzero_positions_in_row(x)`.

In two places it is not needed to build a list, Python iterator are useful for that

```
- len_trace = len([x for x in B if x in hyperoval])
+ len_trace = sum(x in hyperoval for x in B)
-    r = {v:i for i,v in enumerate([x for x in range(n) if x not in hyperoval])}
+    r = {v:i for i,v in enumerate(x for x in range(n) if x not in hyperoval)}
```


That's all before the positive review.

Yo !

Because it costs nothing, and because, given that the constructions are not always obvious, it is good to explain what is happening all along. It works the same way if it is commented.

Thanks ! I did not know this function before you used it in another ticket.

If you believe that it makes any difference ... `:-P`

Okayyyyyy ! Thanks, then `:-)`

P.S. : Something weird is happening. That's the last construction in `needs_review` ! I will fix that as soon as I get Julian's next mail `;-)`
