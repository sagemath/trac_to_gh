# Issue 16916: Print the git branch when doctesting

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Every now and then, I see a disagreement about whether certain changes caused doctest failures, and these disagreements are sometimes settled when someone says, "Oh, I was testing the wrong branch." So let's print the branch when doctesting.

`./sage --git-branch` prints the branch and then does other stuff. Is this intentional?

I also wouldn't use `check_output()`: if `git` fails for whatever reason, that shouldn't be a reason to abort doctesting.

And I would also replace `os.path.exists` by `os.path.isdir`

I would also remove the extra newline by using `self.log(..., end="")`

To be more precise, do use `check_output()` but wrap it in a

```
try:
    ...
except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
    pass
```

No, that was a mistake. I'm adding an `exec` to the beginning.

I've made the other changes. My only question is, if `git` fails, should we print the error message? That's what happens with the latest branch: it gets printed but not recorded in the log. For example, if I replace `$SAGE_ROOT/.git` with an empty directory, I get

```
Running doctests with ID 2014-10-20-13-02-47-ec16085e.
fatal: Not a git repository: '/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/git/sage/.git'
Doctesting entire Sage library.
```

Should we suppress the error message altogether, or keep it?

I would leave it as it is. It's not that important anyway...

Patch looks good, I just need to test it sometime (not now).
