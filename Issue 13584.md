# Issue 13584: FiniteSetMaps Map Comparison

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13788

Original creator: startakovsky

Assignee: tbd

Given two maps f and g, why would it be the case that `f == g` returns `False`, when the maps are identical, and when comparing the `set(f.domain())` == `set (g.domain())` and the same for `codomain`, we get `True`?

Is there a functional reason why comparing domains of functions we can't wrap them as sets before comparing them?  Are FiniteEnumeratedSets supposed to function in such a way that they may not be considered equal unless converting them to a set first?

Please advise.

I believe this would be better asked on sage-devel since it is a question rather than a bug or feature request.

Nevertheless, the biggest problem as I see it is how do you compare infinite enumerated sets, much less uncountable ones. Additionally you can encode additional information into the (co)domain which the function reflects. For example, if I define a map from `f: {0, 1, 2} -> {0, 1, 2}`, there's no way to tell what kind of map do I want, a set map, or perhaps a field homomorphism (although I think this is encoded more in the class of the morphism)? Furthermore, by using the base objects rather than generic sets, equality comparisons can be done significantly faster (ex. take Z mod 1000, you only need to know the class and n rather than having to do a set comparison [which is at least O(n)]).
