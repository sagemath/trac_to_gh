Keywords: doctest failure

We missed a doctest that needs to be fixed:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['B', 3], implementation='coxeter3') # optional - coxeter3
sage: W.kazhdan_lusztig_polynomial([2], [3,2,3,1,2])        # optional - coxeter3
1 + q
```

outputs

```
q + 1
```

Trivial fixes only relevant for optional packages aren't really blocker material...
