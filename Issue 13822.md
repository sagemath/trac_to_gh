`PolyBoRi` contains an `IPython`-based shell (`ipbori`).  `spkg/standard/deps` should reflect this.  This might be the cause of the upgrade failure of `IPython` (mentioned at #14024), where `local/bin/ipython` was not installed correctly.

Indeed, it's not needed, since ipbori can fall back to a plain python shell at runtime. But it won't hurt and ensures that the best shell is used. So positively reviewed.
