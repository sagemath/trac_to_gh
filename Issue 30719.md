This is so that `sage -pip freeze` shows the wheels in their persistent directory rather than the temporary build locations:

```
$ ./sage -pip freeze
alabaster @ file:///Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local/var/tmp/sage/build/alabaster-0.7.12/src
appdirs==1.4.4
appnope @ file:///Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local/var/tmp/sage/build/appnope-0.1.0.p0/src
argon2-cffi==20.1.0
attrs @ file:///Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local/var/tmp/sage/build/attrs-19.3.0/src
Babel @ file:///Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local/var/tmp/sage/build/babel-2.6.0/src
```

This will have to wait until we get rid of using DESTDIR for Python packages
