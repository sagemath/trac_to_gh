Keywords: SI2019

The following code does not work, and gives an unhelpful error message.

sage: R.<t>=QQ[]
sage: K.<v>=QuadraticField(2)
sage: K2.<w>=NumberField(t^4-2)
sage: P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
sage: phi=K.embeddings(K2)[0]
sage: f=DynamicalSystem_projective([x<sup>2+3*y</sup>2,y^2])
sage: f.change_ring(phi)

Since phi is an embedding of K into K2, and f has coefficients defined over QQ, phi cannot change the base ring of f. We add functionality to change_ring on morphisms so it uses the canonical embedding of the base ring of f into the domain of phi when such a canonical embedding exists. When such a canonical embedding does not exist, we add an error to change_ring noting the mismatch between the base ring of f and the domain of phi.
