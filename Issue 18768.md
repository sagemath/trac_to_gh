CC:  pernici @mezzarobba

The polynomials in Sage lack many series operation (see #18356 for some motivation). We implement a generic `cpdef Polynomial inverse_series(self, long prec)` method and specialized ones for polynomials using flint backends.

Hi Vincent,

Could you please explain why you'd like to have these features as methods of polynomial objects rather than power series objects? Thanks!

The docstring of `inverse_series` claims that it works over any ring, but after patching `matrix0.pyx` to make `is_unit` synonymous with `is_invertible`, I get:

```
sage: R.<x> = MatrixSpace(QQ, 2)[]
sage: pol = R.random_element()
sage: list(pol)
[
[   2    0]  [2 1]  [-1  0]
[-1/2 -1/2], [0 2], [ 2 -2]
]
sage: inv = pol.inverse_series(5)
sage: (inv*pol).truncate(5).degree()
4
sage: (pol*inv).truncate(5).degree()
4
```

Did you intend it to work over non-commutative rings?

Though I am not definitive on this, I find it weird to have the two distinct methods `inverse_mod` and `inverse_series` with `p.inverse_series(10) == p.inverse_mod(x^10)`. Wouldn't it be possible to make your code a special case of `inverse_mod`, or to make it a hidden function (`_inverse_series`) which is called as a special case of `inverse_mod`? Actually, these are two distinct changes I propose, with two distinct reasons:

1. It would be make `inverse_mod` faster for monomials:
   {{{#!python
sage: %timeit p.inverse_series(10)
The slowest run took 24.39 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.96 µs per loop
sage: %timeit p.inverse_mod(x^10)
The slowest run took 6.16 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
10000 loops, best of 3: 26.2 µs per loop
      }}}

2. The name `inverse_series` make me think that the result will be a series, so if I want a truncated series (that is a polynomial), I am more naturally inclined to try the `inverse_mod` method. And I suspect other users may have the same behavior.

Ore perhaps `inverse_mod_xk`? I thought about suggesting a different name when I wrote my comments above, but I didn't find anything that I really liked better than `inverse_series`...

Well, a `SEEALSO` looks like a good solution to me also.

My preferred choice goes to `inverse_series_trunc` (or `inverse_series_truncated` if you do not find it too long) since it will easily be found using tabulation and describes well the behavior.

* The generic version fails when the truncation order is negative (inconsistency with the others versions) or zero (which is a problem by itself):

```
sage: (1 + polygen(GF(2))).inverse_series_trunc(0)
...
ValueError: N (=0) must be a positive integer

sage: (1 + polygen(ZZ)).inverse_series_trunc(-1)
0
```

* I believe the doctest in `rings.py` that you fixed was meant to test the code path resulting in a `NotImplementedError`.
* You may want to change `two*current` to `current + current` in the generic implementation? (Not sure if this is a good idea, but it could be much faster for some rings.)
* Why the blank line in `matrix0.py`?
* “The method works *over* any polynomial ring”?

Otherwise looks good to me.

Of course. I will not create a dummy ring just for checking this code path anyway.

Fair enough. But I was wondering why you didn't just remove the test...
