The class MultichooseNK still uses the old `CombinatorialClass` and is used nowhere. So we just deprecate it and use `CartesionProduct` instead.

see also: #16472 and #10534

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16473

Hi!

Note that `Multichoose_NK` is about multisets, not cartesian powers:

```
sage: list(CartesianProduct(range(3), range(3)))
[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]]
sage: list(MultichooseNK(3, 2))
[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2]]
```

But as long as we have a replacement, I am fine deprecating it.

Yup. But let's first finish improving `cartesian_product` so that it can finally replace `CartesianProduct`.

Hi,

> Note that `Multichoose_NK` is about multisets, not cartesian powers:

Yes. I realized that and stopped working on it.

The `Subsets` can replace `Multichoose_NK`. But then, output will be set of sets. I think this is fine. As #10534 modifies subsets I put it as a dependency and will come back to that one as soon as it is positively reviewed.
