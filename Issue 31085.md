If no metric is specified for `DiffForm#hodge_dual` then now the ambient metric is used by default.

Moreover, I took the opportunity to let DiffFormParal derive from DiffForm, so that the former doesn't need to reimplement `hodge_dual`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31322
