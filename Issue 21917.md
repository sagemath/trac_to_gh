# Issue 21917: allow custom log function for asymptotic rings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22154

Original creator: dkrenn

To avoid slipping into the symbolic ring, extend the existing log method of the asymptotic ring to allow a parameter `log_function` which is used instead of SageMath's log.

Do the same for rpow and exp.

Depends on #26498 as both change the classcall/init of the asymptotic ring

At some point the same should be done for rpow and exp, but not here.

This extension to support custom log-functions looks good to me.

The keyword `log` should also be documented in the docstring of the `AsymptoticRing` (`asymptotic_ring.py`, L3322), please add a short explanation.
