CC:  @behackl @cheuberg

To avoid slipping into the symbolic ring, extend the existing log method of the asymptotic ring to allow a parameter `log_function` which is used instead of SageMath's log.

Do the same for rpow and exp.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22154
