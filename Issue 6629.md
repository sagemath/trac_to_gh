Yes, sorry for taking such a long time but this is a big implementation and I work on it only when I have time (which is not so often). 
My plan is to finish a first version of it on the upcoming Sage days in Paris and find someone to work on the review.
In the meantime, the patch is working already and some people use it.

Just pushed my latest code. 
Mostly everything is working but the tests and examples are all messed up (and, for some reason, I still cannot run any tests). 

I have simplified many things, removing useless classes and so on. Now, I consider the monomial basis to be a "generator", I call it x and write:

 

```
sage: A.<x> = MultivariatePolynomialAlgebra(QQ)
sage: x[1,2,3] + x[2,3]
x[2, 3, 0] + x[1, 2, 3]
```


I think it makes more sense and it is more natural to use. The goal is to hide the inner mechanics as much as possible. "New example" are written in this manner, old ones still use the m notation.

All basis are combinatorial free module using a common "key wrapper" class that handles lists and ambient space basis elements.

In terms of mathematical meaning, remember that all bases are indexed by **vectors**, for Grothendieck and Schubert, they correspond to the Lehmer code of the permutation.

The only part that is not working is the "Double polynomial" one, but it's quite independent from the rest. 

I let you have a look at it, it's not finished yet. Feel free to change it if you feel like it. I will be on holidays for the next 2 weeks.
