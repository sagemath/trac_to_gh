Adds some other graphs. I did not find any interesting embedding for Tutte's 12-cage, and I really tried `:-/`

Another review patch for you! This time your patch needed to be rebased on my earlier review patches too...

Other than reformatting, I changed some doctests which seem to be copied and pasted from earlier graphs you made - they are retesting the default value of `embedding`, when they should be testing the non-default one. I also reused a previously generated graph instead of regenerating it, in line 4642 of `graph_generators.py`.

If you agree with the review patch, we can set the ticket to positive review.
