Assignee: tba

Keywords: malloc sage_malloc

In the light of potential future changes to `sage_malloc()`, we should use `sage_malloc()` instead of `malloc()`.

Volker, did you enable specific debugging flags? It looks like `malloc` is just verbosely saying that the allocation failed, it that the default on OS X?

Hello,

Why not using this ?

```
cdef inline void* check_allocarray(size_t nmemb, size_t size) except? NULL:
   """
   Allocate memory for ``nmemb`` elements of size ``size``.
   """
   return check_malloc( mul_overflowcheck(nmemb, size) )


cdef inline void* check_malloc(size_t n) except? NULL:
   """
   Allocate ``n`` bytes of memory.
   """
   if n == 0:
      return NULL
   if n == <size_t>(-1):
      raise MemoryError("cannot allocate %s bytes" % n)
   cdef void* ret = sage_malloc(n)
   if ret == NULL:
      raise MemoryError("failed to allocate %s bytes" % n)
   return ret
```

At least, `check_malloc` should have the test `if n==<size_t>-1` (if not already in `sage_malloc`), and other methods as well.

David.

One reason is that the error message would be less clear this way: any overflow would lead to the same error message. With my code, the error message mentions exactly which allocation failed.

> At least, `check_malloc` should have the test if `n==<size_t>-1` (if not already in `sage_malloc`)
Why? The argument to `malloc()` is a number of bytes. Allocating `<size_t>(-1)` bytes will very likely fail anyway.

Hello,

After a long compilation, I did a doc build and a `sage -t --long src/sage/` (very very long...).

All tests pass on my MBA with OSX 10.10.
