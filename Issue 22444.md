`sage/src/sage/rings/number_field` contains the following loop:


```
   7292             if both_maps and K.degree() == self.degree():
   7293                 g = K['x'](self.polynomial())
   7294                 v = g.roots()
   7295                 a = from_K(K.gen())
   7296                 for i in range(len(v)):
   7297                     r = g.roots()[i][0]
   7298                     to_K = self.hom([r])    # check=False here ??
   7299                     if to_K(a) == K.gen():
   7300                         break
```


Line 7297 should read `r = v[i][0]` .

This actually leads to a huge speed-up.

Salut Frédéric,

If you don't care about multiplicity you can use

```
for root in g.roots(multiplicity=False):
    ...
```

(which would be cleaner than calling `root[0]`)

You can for example replace with

```

sage: len(r)
24
sage: a*b in r and b^2*(a-1) in r
True
```


(however it would be interesting to investigate why it is different each time now...)
