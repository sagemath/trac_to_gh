CC:  @kiwifb

Broken off of #18437.

Reasoning: PolyBoRi is no longer being actively developed, moving the python bindings into the sage library distributes the burden of maintenance across the sage community.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18506

And about the scons dependency?

And, are you volunteering to maintain the separate package? (The point of moving the python bindings to the sage library is to distribute the maintenance, but if you are willing to maintain the separate package, then I'm not opposed to keeping it as a separate package.)

I meant package your github polybori-with-autotools repo as a separate package.

> And, are you volunteering to maintain the separate package?
This is not a relevant question. It has to be maintained anyway, inside or outside of Sage. I volunteer for neither.
