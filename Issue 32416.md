Is this correct?

No, I'll have to fix this one - a lapse of concentration

There is one example in `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/base.pyx` that should have went into #32652.

You can either fix it or leave it as it is. Either way, you can put it on positive review on my behalf.
