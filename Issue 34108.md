# Issue 34108: Method to get cells in horizontal/vertical border strip

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34345

CC:  tscrim tkarn

Keywords: gsoc2022 partition cell border-strip

The methods `Partition.add_*_border_strip` where `*` is `horizontal` or `vertical` return new partitions. This ticket proposes a method that returns the indices of the cells of these new partitions which are not in the original partition.

For these methods, since we are adding them, it would be better if they were generators that iterated through the different strips. (I wanted to do this for the other methods, but I didn't want to deal with the backwards incompatibility.) So instead of `res.append(foo)`, it would be `yield foo`.

Why the change in order (`horizontal` then `vertical`)? It would be better to be consistent.

In the vertical strip, you can move the creation of `tmp` outside of the `for` loop.
