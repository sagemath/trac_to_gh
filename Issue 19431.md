Martin Raum has [posted on sage-nt](https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/sage-nt/EkBWOogY8yw) code for computing the symmetric square L-functions of (level 1) modular forms. The goal of this ticket is to get Martin's code into Sage.

Oops, I forgot to run long doctests, and one of them is failing on the patchbot.

That's better. This is now ready for review. (The code should work for certain higher-level forms -- trivial character and squarefree level should be OK -- but that can come in a subsequent ticket; for now it just raises NotImplementedError if the level isn't 1.)

One of the patchbot plugins spotted that I had used the old-style, deprecated ` raise Exception, "message"` syntax rather than ` raise Exception("message")`, so here's a tiny patch fixing this.

I noticed that one of the commits had the wrong ticket number in the docstring, so I rewrote the history using "git rebase". The new branch has a single commit, with the correct ticket number; the code is identical to the previously-uploaded branch.

The implementation looks clean and correct.

I checked that some output was consistent with what is returned from Magma.

It would be worth having a more general implementation (including arbitrary powers, too?). But it's better than nothing, so I'm giving a positive review.
