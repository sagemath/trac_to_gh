Following #29338, the proposed branch adds 2 new methods which allows what follows:


```
sage: from sage.combinat.matrices.dancing_links import dlx_solver
sage: rows = [[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [0,1], [2,3,4,5], [0], [1,2,3,4,5]]
sage: d = dlx_solver(rows)
sage: d.one_solution()
[1, 0]
sage: d.one_solution_using_milp_solver()
[0, 1]
sage: d.one_solution_using_milp_solver('Gurobi')
[2, 3]
sage: d.one_solution_using_milp_solver('CLPEX')
[2, 3]
etc.
```


This is based on the new method:

```
sage: p,x = d.to_milp_solver()
sage: p
Boolean Program (no objective, 6 variables, 6 constraints)
sage: x
MIPVariable of dimension 1 
```

I found two issues with the doctests. I'll post them as two separate comments.

First, there is a doctest error (all the variables in the constraints are named `x_` instead of `x_0`, `x_1`, etc.).

Second, the answer I get from the following doctest does not agree with the answer specified in the doctest.

```
sage: from sage.combinat.matrices.dancing_links import dlx_solver
sage: rows = [[0,1,2], [0,2], [1], [3]]
sage: d = dlx_solver(rows)
sage: d.to_milp_solver("gurobi")
(Boolean Program (no objective, 4 variables, 4 constraints),
 MIPVariable of dimension 1)
```

The doctest says the above should be:

```
sage: d.to_milp_solver('gurobi')   # optional gurobi sage_numerical_backends_gurobi
Boolean Program (no objective, 4 variables, 4 constraints)
```

I'm not sure why this error is not caught by the doctest system.

I just learned about the `--show-skipped` option for `sage -t`. Since `gurobi` is not a sage optional package, I had to specify it explicitly with the `---optional` command. If I run 

```
sage -t --optional=sage,gurobi,sage_numerical_backends_gurobi dancing_links.pyx
```

then I see two doctest failures.

Yes indeed, I wanted to write

sage: p
Boolean Program (no objective, 6 variables, 6 constraints)
sage: x
MIPVariable of dimension 1 
```

...as you fixed it is okay as well.

On another machine running a more recent version of Sage, with the current public branch, I get:

```
$ sage -version
SageMath version 9.2.beta1, Release Date: 2020-06-13
$ sage -bt --optional=sage,optional,external --show-skipped src/sage/combinat/matrices/dancing_links.pyx

sage -t src/sage/combinat/matrices/dancing_links.pyx
    3 gurobi tests not run
    0 tests not run because we ran out of time
    [250 tests, 2.26 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
External software detected for doctesting: 
```


(The licence of my Gurobi licence just expired. I need to renew it.)

So the error with the `x_` in the `p.show()` is weird. Are you able to reproduce it on another machine?
