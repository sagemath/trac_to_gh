# Issue 11516: graded modules and graded algebras

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11688

Keywords: graded modules, graded algebras

Currently some properties of graded modules are implemented in graded algebras. It is necessary to put them in their proper place.

One precise reason is that one can them use these properties for operads. One would like to have something like that:


```
sage: PL=PreLieOperad(QQ)
sage: a=PL.one()
sage: a.is_homogeneous()
True
sage: a.homogeneous_component(2)
0
```


For this, one needs the "homogeneous_component" method for elements and not for modules. Maybe "restrict_degree" would be more adequate, like for power series.

It would be nice to implement the Koszul sign convention for tensor products, also.

Changing keywords from "graded modules, graded algebras" to "graded module, graded algebra".

See rather #9280

ok, I have cut out and cleaned the relevant part of #9280

the present patch is independant of algebras and concerned only with modules

needs review !

Same comment here as at #9280: I should not be listed as an author of the file "sage/categories/examples/graded_modules_with_basis.py". Furthermore, I don't think my name should be at the top of the patch file.

You are right. I have taken care of that here, as well as I could. I hope I have not broken the patch.

Hey Frederic,

Here's a review patch which just tweaks the indentations. If you agree with my changes, you can set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis
