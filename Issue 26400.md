# Issue 26400: clean generic_graph.py (part 6)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

CC:  tscrim chapoton slabbe

Keywords: py3, graph

Done here:
- correct method `eulerian_orientation` for graphs without edge (was not using the right set of vertices)
 - Should we move this method to `orientation.py` ?

- some care in `min_spanning_tree`, but we have remaining issues:
 - algorithm `"Prim_fringe"` compare vertex labels. I added `hash(..)` around, but this is certainly not enough.
 - the output of min spanning tree methods is sorted. As said in #26547, there is no reason for that.

- avoid a call to .edges in `cycle_basis`

Is there a metaticket for files in `graphs`? I'm particularly interested in more on `generic_graph.py`, especially `is_isomorphic`, and also `base/sparse_graph.pyx`, especially `iterator_edges`. Both of these try to sort vertices, which cause Python 3 doctest failures in `homology/simplicial_complexes.py` and `homology/examples.py`.

Let us use #26640 as meta ticket. Should have been opened earlier. Feel free to modify it as I don't know how to organize it.
