4ti2 version 1.6.3 was just released (http://www.4ti2.de/). Should update the package to get some minor build fixes and improved test-suite coverage. 
Also the manual has been updated and all examples from the manual checked; the updated manual should make it easier to support 4ti2's features in Sage.

Looks good to me.

I have taken the opportunity to correct a few doc details in the interface.

If you agree, you can set to positive review.
