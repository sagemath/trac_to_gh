Currently, the method `Polyhedron.restricted_automorphism_group()` returns an abstract permutation on the vertices. In this ticket, we optionally allow returning a concrete affine matrix group on the ambient space.

Nice!

Can we rename `kind` to `output`, `representation`, or something like that? It always returns the same abstract group, not different kinds of automorphism groups.

There should be some discussion about what the returned matrix groups are. Something like:

If the polyhedron is not full dimensional, the linear automorphism group is infinite as it can act arbitrarily in the orthogonal directions. Nevertheless, as a permutation group, the restricted automorphism group is finite. It has a natural representation as the subset of linear automorphisms that act trivially in the orthogonal directions. Use the `output='matrix'` option to return it.
