From the starting point provided in the ticket description:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.integration.external import mma_free_integrator
sage: mma_free_integrator(sin(x), x)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-9d83ac0f1d23> in <module>()
----> 1 mma_free_integrator(sin(x), x)

.../local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/symbolic/integration/external.pyc in mma_free_integrator(expression, v, a, b)
     95     params = urlencode({'expr': expression._mathematica_init_(), 'random': 'false'})
     96     page = urlopen("http://integrals.wolfram.com/home.jsp", params).read()
---> 97     page = page[page.index('"inputForm"'):page.index('"outputForm"')]
     98     page = re.sub(r"\s", "", page)
     99     mexpr = re.match(r".*Integrate.*==</em><br/>(.*)</p>", page).groups()[0]

ValueError: substring not found
```

one can check what this function is doing:

```
sage: mma_free_integrator??
```

and follow its content step by step to trace the error:

```
sage: expression = sin(x)
sage: v = x
sage: import re
sage: from six.moves.urllib.request import urlopen
sage: from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlencode
sage: vars = [str(x) for x in expression.variables()]
sage: any(len(x)>1 for x in vars)
False
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: repr(v) != 'x'
False
sage: params = urlencode({'expr': expression._mathematica_init_(), 'random': 'false'})
sage: params
'expr=Sin%5Bx%5D&random=false'
sage: page = urlopen("http://integrals.wolfram.com/home.jsp", params).read()
```

Since the next line is the one that gives the error:

```
sage: page = page[page.index('"inputForm"'):page.index('"outputForm"')]
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: substring not found
```

we can explore `page` in search of a possible reason; the last few lines
indicate that the integral calculator has moved to Wolfram|Alpha.

```
sage: print(page)
...
    <!-- we inline this because of handlebars -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        if (getURLParam("redirected") == "true") {
          $('#input-wrapper').before(
              '<div id="redirectBanner"><div id="bannerContent"><div id="bannerText">The integral calculator has moved to Wolfram|Alpha. &nbsp;'
              + '</div><a id="redirectLink" href="http://integrals.wolfram.com/home.jsp">Visit the old one &raquo;</a></div></div>'
          );
        }

        $('form#input-form').submit(function() {
        var submittedData = $(this).find('input#calc-input').val();
        if (!submittedData) {
          $(this).find('input#calc-input').val('integrate x sin(x^2)');
        }
      });

    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```


Now if we use Wolfram|Alpha to collect the page describing the integral:

```
sage: page = urlopen("https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+x+sin(x%5E2)").read()
sage: print(page)
```

we see that the display of the solution happens in JavaScript.

I see no way to parse the html page for the computed integral.
