Why? I think this should be done as early as possible in the build process. It is convenient if all other scripts in Sage can assume the existence of the basic directory structure.

And given that this basic directory structure is created by `configure`, it is most natural to create also the `lib64` symlink there.

Configure does IMHO already too many things that it has no place to do; Why create install directories there? Its also testing package configuration for correctness (as opposed to during testing). Neither of these are typically done by configure. 

Besides being the wrong place, putting stuff into configure makes it also unnecessarily difficult to work on that in the future as it is an additional layer of inception (script writing shell script) and requires an arcane process of creating a new confball.

That's standard `configure` stuff, it don't see why it is a complication.

That's purely a "release management" thing. There is no fundamental reason for it, it's only because of your workflow.

How many Sage developers are comfortable working with configure.ac? Maybe 5%?

There is a fundamental reason, OSX doesn't come with autotools so we can't do the configure.ac -> configure at the client. Any change to configure.ac necessarily entails further release steps, which is why I really don't like stuff thats absolutely not configureable in there.

`sage-env` shouldn't do anythning besides setting up the environment, it certainly shouldn't do anyhing different depending on how far along we are in the install process.

I'm running into trouble related to this, I think.  I upgraded a Linux (Ubuntu  Bionic Beaver) version of Sage from something like 6.8, ran into a problem, followed the message to do `make distclean` first.  I made it to `gfortran` and that seems to compile fine, but then at the very end

I can report this on sage-devel as well (I doubt it is a particular release thing unless this was indeed a very recent change) if it would be found useful.  Otherwise I don't have a way to proceed.
