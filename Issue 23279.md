# Issue 23279: Use LLL to reduce bounds for S-unit solutions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23516

Original creator: mwest

Original creation time: 2017-07-22 12:18:20

CC:  malmskog

Keywords: S-unit equation, LLL, sd87

In an earlier ticket, #23515, we produce very large bounds for the solutions to the S-unit equation.  This patch reduces these bounds significantly using LLL.

As the plugin notes, you should change "EXAMPLE" to "EXAMPLES"

Doctests are no longer working, precision increase algorithms getting too large.

The branch on this ticket builds on #22148, deleting some features in order to break the review up into pieces.  Since #22148 is positively reviewed, this ticket should be closed.  The branch shouldn't be merged, since doing so would delete parts of #22148.
