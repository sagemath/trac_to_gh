# Issue 24305: Binary relations in Sage implemented

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: porton

Original creation time: 2018-01-14 23:41:50

I have implemented binary relations (including composition of relations, set theoretic operations, conversion back/forth to graphs and to posets, etc.)

The patch is attached.

This could be quite useful.  It looks like you need quite a bit of documentation/examples for the many methods involved.    Especially the back/forth with posets, if robust, would be great - see e.g. [this stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48198902/how-to-compose-two-partial-orders-in-sage).

I'm surprised something like this isn't already in Sage though that's not something I'm really qualified to comment on.  I suspect there's also probably a better place to put this than starting a new top-level package.

I can make some minor nitpicks on the code itself if you think that would be helpful.

`@`embray I don't know if your nitpicks are good. After all, I know nothing about you. You decide if you do the work.

I am going to add yet one feature: Converting a function into a binary relation. However I will be busy today. I have not yet dived into details of this feature.

There is interest for this, see

Replying to [comment:11 embray]:
> I suspect there's also probably a better place to put this than starting a new top-level package.

I agree. A top-level package is supposed to contain many modules and/or packages. 

I suggest to put this module into `sage.combinat.relations`. 

On the other hand, `sage.sets.relations` would be a bad choice as `sage.sets` is concerned with generic sets.
