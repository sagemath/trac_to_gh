Should it be "an element without the pseudocomplement" or "an element without a pseudocomplement", as an element can have at most one pseudocomplemet?

I would say "a pseudocomplement" both in case one does not exist and so it makes it seem less like there is one pseudocomplement for all lattices (which you could get around by saying "the pseudocomplement of the lattice").

Travis, can you also review this? Should be trivial.

Is there a reason why you have one as 3 lines `if-return` and the other as a 1 line `return foo if bar else True`? I think it would be good to be consistent. Once addressed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
