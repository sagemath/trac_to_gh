# Issue 21268: LatticePoset: certificate for is_pseudocomplemented()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21505

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-09-16 12:30:29

Add an option to get an element without the pseudocomplement. (Compare to `.is_complemented(certificate=True)`.

Should it be "an element without the pseudocomplement" or "an element without a pseudocomplement", as an element can have at most one pseudocomplemet?

I would say "a pseudocomplement" both in case one does not exist and so it makes it seem less like there is one pseudocomplement for all lattices (which you could get around by saying "the pseudocomplement of the lattice").

Travis, can you also review this? Should be trivial.

(Not that important, but kind of nice to have unified format of `is_*` -functions when possbile.)

Is there a reason why you have one as 3 lines `if-return` and the other as a 1 line `return foo if bar else True`? I think it would be good to be consistent. Once addressed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Done that. Thanks.

??? I can not get that error message. It seems that the code has been tested before compiling.

I agree with Jori's assessment.
