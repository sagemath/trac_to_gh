Part of #29199.

Before:


```
sage: P = polytopes.cross_polytope(6)
sage: %timeit P.join(P)
5.77 ms ± 44.7 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(6)
sage: %timeit P.join(P)
8.7 ms ± 5.83 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)
sage: %timeit P.join(P)
183 ms ± 83.2 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```


After:


```
sage: P = polytopes.cross_polytope(6)
sage: %timeit P.join(P)
5.7 ms ± 21.6 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(6)
sage: %timeit P.join(P)
4.74 ms ± 4.27 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)
sage: %timeit P.join(P)
686 ms ± 4.63 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(6, backend='field')
sage: %timeit P.join(P)
18.5 ms ± 137 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```
