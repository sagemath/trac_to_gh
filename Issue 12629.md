Works correctly:

```
sage: f=function('f')
sage: g=function('g')
sage: (f(g(x))+g(x)).substitute_function(g,sin)
sin(x) + f(sin(x))
```

but

```
sage: f(g(x)).diff(x).substitute_function(g,sin)
cos(x)*D[0](f)(g(x))
sage: sage.symbolic.operators.FDerivativeOperator(f,[0])(g(x)).substitute_function(g,sin)
D[0](f)(g(x))
```

so I suspect it forgets to descend into the arguments of an FDerivativeOperator

With #12796 done, the example works and I can add a doctest. My own code needs to substitute functions that aren't built in, though:


```
sage: f = function('f')                     
sage: g = 2*x*sin(x)

  return operator.change_function(self.new)(*map(self,ex.operands()))
2*x*cos(x) + 2*sin(x)
```


It does do the right thing, I just haven't been able to figure out how to avoid the warning. Is there some way to get a real function out of the expression `g`? Or a way to trick the substitution into doing e.g. `x=x`, `y=y`?

Replying to [comment:5 mjo]:
> Is there some way to get a real function out of the expression `g`?
Yes there is:

```
sage: f = function('f')
sage: gexpr = 2*x*sin(x)
sage: g = gexpr.function(x)
sage: g
x |--> 2*x*sin(x)
```

evil shorthand (do `preparse('g(x)=2*x*sin(x)')` or google sage-devel to see what's evil about it):

```
sage: g(x)=2*x*sin(x)
sage: g
x |--> 2*x*sin(x)
```

but then it works:

```
sage: f_prime = f(x).diff(x)
sage: f_prime
2*x*cos(x) + 2*sin(x)
```

or, if you really want to stick with functions, things get a little hairier:

```
sage: f_prime=sage.symbolic.operators.FDerivativeOperator(f,[0])
sage: f_prime.substitute_function(f,g)
AttributeError
sage: f_prime.change_function(g)
D[0](x |--> 2*x*sin(x))
sage: f_prime.change_function(g)(x)
2*x*cos(x) + 2*sin(x)
sage: f_prime.change_function(g)(x).function(x)
x |--> 2*x*cos(x) + 2*sin(x)
```

This basically shows you that arithmetic on functions themselves isn't really supported yet. Given that functions can have an unspecified arity that might be a good thing. If we want to make "symbolic functions" into a (differential) ring, some serious design choices would have to be considered.


In fact, that trick was used in #12796 in `FDerivativeOperator.__call__`. I don't know which of

```
expr.subs({x: x0, y: y0})
expr.function(x,y)(x0,y0)
```

is preferable.

> I'd like to look for a way to make it work for both `substitute_function(g, sin)` and `substitute_function(g, 2*x)`,

Unfortunately, there is not enough information to make this work reliably. If you do

```
expr=(c+1)*(y-1)
sin(x).substitute_function(sin,expr)
```

it needs to turn `(c+1)*(y-1)` into a function. Any of the following are reasonable:

```
expr.function(y)
expr.function(c)
expr.function(y,c)
expr.function(c,y)
```

and all of them have a different result. This is actually the same reason why "calling" expressions with positional arguments is deprecated.

If you're still doubting, try and figure out what

```
(f(x,z)+f(z,y)).substitute_function(f,cos(x)*sin(y+1))
```

should do.

Thanks for the doctest. Positive review it is.
