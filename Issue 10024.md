Hello !!!

Here is another patch to add to yours... The doctests did not pass, as the sloane_sequence method always outputs "Searching Sloane's online database...". I tried to find ways around, then thought the best was to just let it forward a verbose parameter to find_sloane... Anyway, I made this modification, and I also moved most of the documentation written in the __init__ method of class A109814 just after the class definition. This way, it appears in the documentation when it is built. 

The same should be done for the other methods, as currently very few of them appear : http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/combinat/sloane_functions.html

Only my patch needs done to be reviewed before this ticket can be set as positively reviewed ! `:-)`

Yes, i missed the first patch needed to be applied first. 

Should this not return an error, rather than waste bandwidth looking on the database?

```
sage: sloane_find(32.23)
Searching Sloane's online database...
[]
```


I's also puzzled that


```
sage: sloane_find(sin(x)) # where I have not defined x
Searching Sloane's online database...
```


should actually produce any output, but it does. 

I'm not really into OEIS, so perhaps I'm mistaken.

Well, by default x is a symbolic variable, so "sin(x)" has some meaning already... Later on, I think the argument gets translated into a string, which still has meaning, and there shouldn't be anything wrong until the website answers that there is no sequence corresponding to this non-integer.

To be honest I had used this method once or twice only since I know Sage, and I already did not like the fact that it could not be told to stay mute (and also that verbosity is the default behaviour). Well, it's getting slowly fixed `:-)`

Hi,
Here, the primary goal is to correct the fact that sloane.A111776 is in fact the sequence A109814.
I also added a test to check that be sure this doesn't happen again, which test every sequences against the online version.
With respect to this, I'm happy with the changes made by Nathann and would give a positive review.

I do agree that it's a bad thing not to test the input for correctness, but it's not the point of this ticket. David, please feel free to open another one to adress this issue. I also let you make the decision about giving a positive review or not, as I'm a little bit biased as an author.

cheers,

I think it is better that you and Nathan review each others patches, as I don't consider myself qualified to check this - my pthon skills are not good. There is no problem in having two authors and two reviewers, as long as they review each others work, and not their own. 

I guess I should open a ticket for the fact the code does not check its input, but there are more serious cases. Try


```
