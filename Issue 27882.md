CC:  chapoton

This will provide a fast almost uniform random generator for triangulations of polygons.

This will extend the functionality of `graphs.RandomTriangulation()` to choosing the degree of the outer face of the triangulation. Currently, only outer faces of degree 3 are provided.

As the current implementation, this will use the algorithm via a bijection with blossoming trees due to Schaeffer and Poulalhon (Optimal Coding and Sampling of Triangulations, Algorithmica 2006).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28119

In the former implementation of `RandomTriangulation()` the resulting graph always had an edge `(-1,-2)`. Since this had not been part of the documentation of `RandomTriangulation()`, I did not recover this behavior but fixed the two places where this behavior was expected.

This

```
k = (len(pendant_word)+4) / 2
```

should rather use `//`, no ?

I am getting 16 failures when testing with python3-built sage. Maybe all caused by the line above creating a float. 

Please add before the line 

```
from six.moves import range
```

another line containing

```
from __future__ import print_function, division
```

so that the behaviour of division becomes py3-like.

Sorry, but this is breaking the following code (randomly, maybe once every 5 calls)

```
sage: T = TamariIntervalPosets(40)
sage: T.random_element()
