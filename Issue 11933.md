The bug is in line 4708 of sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx:

```
        if algorithm == 0 and fld.__prec * n < 10000:
```

The result of that multiplication as a signed int may become negative and actually does so in your example.

On Mac I don't get an error, but it hangs and eventually consumes all resources, so fair enough!  

This patch gives

```
sage: timeit("RealField(53)(0.05).nth_root(7 * 10^8)")
625 loops, best of 3: 69.2 Âµs per loop
```


One question I have is whether this is the most appropriate test with this precision.

```
sage: RealField(53)(0.05).nth_root(7 * 10^8) 
0.999999995720382
sage: _^(7*10^8)
0.0499999991341384
```

Is that good enough?  

Otherwise this is fine, passes tests, etc. on 5.0.beta1.

Well, that's what I figured, but I'm not a numerical analysis expert.  Thanks.
