This works and can be reviewed independently on machines with gcc>=4.6, but please wait with setting positive for the build system changes (i.e., #19298).

There are two failing doctests: one only happens on doctesting and needs the associated environment; the other is the "pi in RIF" doctest which presented a philosophical problem to Sage developers (see #17984) and thus cannot be resolved in my lifetime.

I will be happy to work on it if there is a problem with #19040.

I'm guessing changes of this type:

```
-        sage: x,y = var('x,y')
+        sage: _ = var('x,y')
```

are because you're thinking towards #17958.

There still is

```
e^{\sqrt{x}}^{x}
```

in `functions/log.py`.

Also, for the test in `hyperbolic_isometry.py`, if we add

```
sage: assume(a*d != b*c)
```

then would that avoid issues with #19040?

Other than that, I'm okay with the current state up to Jeroen's comments that haven't been addressed.
