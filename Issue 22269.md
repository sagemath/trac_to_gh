There is a tutorial on how to get tikz code to draw polytopes available [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/polytope_tikz.html).

When it was written, it was not possible to include pictures in the documentation. This ticket adds the pictures that belong to the tutorial.

It seems that this is not yet possible to include tikz code inside the documentation using the `sphinx_plot` method.

I sent an email to sage-devel [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/JgS1wnNFI9g) to get some information on this topic.

I did some tests and it seems that if sage could take a `LatexExpr` and output a .png of .svg in a similar way as a plot, then since sphinx_plot eats a .png... that could be a simple hack..

SÃ©bas, didn't you do something related to this recently?

In the package slabbe.spkg (see [here](https://github.com/seblabbe/slabbe)), the TikzPicture class does almost all the work needed. The step missing would be to have a .plot() method returning a Sage Graphics object and then sphinx_plot could take that.

I added a dependency to a ticket that add the class needed to have a try at this.
