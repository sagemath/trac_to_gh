Split from #25825. This moves the remaining instances of `is_package_installed` for gap packages to `Feature`s.

You will also want to include #22623 (looking at this ticket, I think I did a poor job of actually testing if GAP could load the `QuaGroup` package on #22623 as I just let it fail).

You probably know your code best. Could you maybe make that addition? Feel free to base off my branch and rebase as you like.

Let me know if I did this correctly. If so, then you can set this to a positive review.

LGTM (I'm assuming you ran the doctest?) :)

Just as an FYI: My one nitpick would be the commit message. It [should](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) be in imperative and a bit more abstract, maybe "Use features to detect QuaGroup support" or something. But that's not a blocker.
