Hi SÃ©bastien,

From the diff two files disappeared: `src/sage/functions/exp_integral.py` and `src/sage/functions/hyperbolic.py`. Is that normal?

Replying to [comment:7 vdelecroix]:

No, it is definitely not normal. I am confused since none of the commits in the branch deletes those files. Any idea of what I might have done wrong, or is it trac diff that gets something wrong?

In any case, I can prepare a new clean branch in a few days.

No need to rebase, everything is back to normal: trac diff does not show any more that the files should be deleted.

Merge conflicts need to be fixed.
