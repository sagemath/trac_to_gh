We add `_sympy_` methods to matrix and vector classes, converting to `sympy.matrices.Matrix`.

Do you also want to handle the case when there is no common parent? In particular, I get

```
sage: coercion_model.common_parent(ZZ, QQ, ZZ^5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
[snip]
TypeError: no common canonical parent for objects with parents: ...
```

Although I am not sure this can happen...
