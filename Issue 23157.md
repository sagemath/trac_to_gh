In http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/programming.html#standalone-python-sage-scripts the second command doesn't actually work:

```
$ ./factor "32*x^5-1"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./factor", line 11, in <module>
    print(factor(sage_eval(sys.argv[1])))
  File "/usr/local/src/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/sage_eval.py", line 201, in sage_eval
    return eval(source, sage.all.__dict__, locals)
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```


Since I see no reason why it *should* work, the easiest solution is just to remove that example. It's about writing scripts and that part works.
