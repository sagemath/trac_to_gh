CC:  @paulmasson jepperlein

Keywords: ipython, latex, tikz


```
view(latex(transducers.GrayCode()))
```

shows the transducer inplace in sagenb but it is a pitty that this does not work in the ipython notebook.

`latex(transducers.GrayCode())` writes tikz-code.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18116

Launching an external viewer from the notebook server process equals NOT working in my book. So `show(T)` never worked in the ipython notebook, and this ticket doesn't change that.

The correct way to get graphical output is `T.plot()`. The fact that this cannot produce the graphics that you want is a bug in the finite state machine code.

The show docstring is correct, it'll show a Graphics object if you provide one. If you don't give it a graphics object then you won't get a picture.

On my installations the command

```
T = transducers.GrayCode()
show(T)
```

does the following:

- 6.6.rc1 ipython-notebook: open and show the LaTeX-formatted output in external viewer (as pdf).

- 6.6.rc1 sagenb: show LaTeX-formatted output inline.

- 6.6.rc2+#18116 ipython-notebook: does nothing.

Hi Daniel,

Replying to [ticket:18116 dkrenn]:
> I also want to discourage the `view()` command, right now it is just spaghetti code that does different things depending on the time of the day. 
> So I propose to use `latex(...).compile()` as an idiom to typeset LaTeX code.

First, to me the following facts are all completely independent:
A. discourage the use of `view()`
B. `view()` is spaghetti code
C. propose `latex(...).compile()` 
So one can't use A or B to suggest C.

Second, I have never liked in Sage the fact that there plenty of ways of drawing things. For an outside person, it is tough to understand the difference `plot`, `show` and `view` ? To me there should be one fonction to do them all. For that reason, I do not like the idea of proposing a fourth one being `latex(...).compile()` or anything else.

That being said, I really like the idea of being able to show tikz pictures in the ipython notebook.

Making `view` an alias for `show(latex(..).compile())` doesn't make it one bit more self-explanatory.

The only real alternative is make latex objects display graphically by default, i.e.

```
sage: latex(1/2)
```

would use the displayhook to show mathjax or pdf. Thats possible, but I think many people use latex to generate latex code to paste into their articles and not to get cute pictures in the notebook.

+1, there should be a method of `LatexExpr` that shows it pretty like `LatexExpr.__pprint__` that is used by the displayhook thing.

> Thats possible, but I think many people use latex to generate latex code to paste into their articles and not to get cute pictures in the notebook.

Well, they could still do:


```
sage: latex(1/2) # shows graphically
sage: print latex(1/2) # prints the source
```

What if plot would actually work in the first place (i.e. have a proper tikz backend for Graphics objects)\n\n1. Through the years, I have been used in Sage for the `plot()` method to return a `Graphics()` object (and not anything else). If it can be made more general, why not?\n\n2. I have used cases where I use both : `plot()` method for returning a Graphics or a Graphics3D sage object *and* `_latex_()` method for returning the tikz code. This is the case for instance for polyhedron in Sage where you can first use jmol to choose a nice projection and then create the tikz code using a chosen projection. Therefore, if `plot()` can now return output generated by latex, I still want it to draw my other Graphics sage object output maybe using some other arguments.\n\n3. I think we don't have to hide the object `LatexExpr` to the user. I mean `view` or `plot` or `show` could just return the compiled default latex expression. But sometimes (graph for instance), there are many latex output (depending on which graphviz program I use). So, to me it is not the object that I draw, it is a latex expression. Therefore, there should be still a way to obtain the latex expression of an object and then draw it.",

Replying to [comment:22 vbraun]:
> You say that because the objects that you are interested in have a broken `plot()` method, so you prefer graphical output generated by compiling latex. What if plot would actually work in the first place (i.e. have a proper tikz backend for Graphics objects)

1. Through the years, I have been used in Sage for the `plot()` method to return a `Graphics()` object (and not anything else). If it can be made more general, why not?

2. I have used cases where I use both : `plot()` method for returning a Graphics or a Graphics3D sage object *and* `_latex_()` method for returning the tikz code. This is the case for instance for polyhedron in Sage where you can first use jmol to choose a nice projection and then create the tikz code using a chosen projection. Therefore, if `plot()` can now return output generated by latex, I still want it to draw my other Graphics sage object output maybe using some other arguments.

3. I think we don't have to hide the object `LatexExpr` to the user. I mean `view` or `plot` or `show` could just return the compiled default latex expression. But sometimes (graph for instance), there are many latex output (depending on which graphviz program I use). So, to me it is not the object that I draw, it is a latex expression. Therefore, there should be still a way to obtain the latex expression of an object and then draw it.

Plot should still return a graphics object. I'm saying that graphics objects should support tikz (next to matplotlib) to draw graph-type graphics objects. Just like 3-d graphcs objects can be rendered in different ways.

There is some kind of solution to the original problem of this ticket at #19515. The original problem was:

```
view(latex(transducers.GrayCode())) 
```
 
shows the transducer inplace in sagenb but it is a pitty that this does not work in the ipython notebook.

```
latex(transducers.GrayCode())
```

writes tikz-code.
