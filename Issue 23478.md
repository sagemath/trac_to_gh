Related: the documentation for `rref` (reduced row-echelon form) claims that

> All arguments are passed on to :meth:`echelon_form`.


but it is not the case; in particular `transformation=True` is not passed on!

```
sage: a = matrix(ZZ, [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1], [0, 1, 0]])
sage: a.rref(transformation=True)
[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
sage: a.echelon_form(transformation=True)
(
[1 0 3]  [ 1  0 -2]
[0 1 0]  [ 0  0  1]
[0 0 8], [ 3 -1 -4]
)
```

Is it maybe the case that `transformation=True` is honored by `echelon_form` only if the base ring is not a field?
