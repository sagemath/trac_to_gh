Python 3.9 deprecates using `math.factorial` with floats with integral values.

- ​https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/math.html#math.factorial

    "Deprecated since version 3.9: Accepting floats with integral values (like 5.0) is deprecated."

This gives a doctest failure in Sage 9.2.rc0 with Python 3.9.0:

```
File "src/sage/functions/other.py", line 1629, in sage.functions.other.Function_factorial._eval_
Failed example:
    factorial(float(3.2))        # abs tol 1e-14
      File "<doctest sage.functions.other.Function_factorial._eval_[8]>", line 1, in <module>
        factorial(float(RealNumber('3.2')))        # abs tol 1e-14
      File "/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-py39/local/lib/python3.9/warnings.py", line 109, in _showwarnmsg
        sw(msg.message, msg.category, msg.filename, msg.lineno,
    :
    DeprecationWarning: Using factorial() with floats is deprecated
    7.756689535793181
```

First discussed in #30184 (comments 25, 33, 40, 41, 42, 43).

Is this a pynac issue? I've been trying to understand how factorials work in Sage, and it looks like in the case of floats, it just passes it on to pynac. That is, `factorial(float(3.2))` calls the `__call__` method for `Function` in `symbolic/function.pyx`, and in this case it executes this code:

```
        if not symbolic_input and is_a_numeric(res):
            return py_object_from_numeric(res)
```
`py_object_from_numeric` comes from `libs/pynac/pynac.pxd`.

<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
In python3.9, the code used depends on whether the float is integer-like or not:

For `float(5.0)`, the `__call__` method uses `math.factorial` that warns but works.

For `float(5.1)`, the `__call__` method uses `math.factorial` that raises an Error.
This error is catched, but what happens next is not very clear. Apparently, it uses another `__call_`, namely

```
                res = super(BuiltinFunction, self).__call__(
                        *args, coerce=coerce, hold=hold)
```
This then turns again to the module `math`, but for gamma, which works.

<a id='comment:10'>**Comment 10:**</a>
This will work, but I think it would be better to have a little more detailed comment as the current one is lacking context. Perhaps something like:

```
# We do not include the factorial here as it is deprecated in Python 3.9.
# This case will be delegated to the gamma function.
```
