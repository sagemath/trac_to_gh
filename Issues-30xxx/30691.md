I sometimes get wrong results when computing large coefficients in the cycle index series for graphs, and then also for the isotype generating series:

```
sage: F = species.SimpleGraphSpecies().cycle_index_series()
sage: F.isotype_generating_series().coefficients(9)
[1, 1, 2, 4, 11, 34, 156, 1044, 1044]
```

Unfortunately, I cannot quite reproduce this yet.

It always happens if I interrupt the computation and then ask for the coefficients again, but sometimes it happens otherwise, too.

**Keywords:** species, LazyPowerSeries

**Status:** new
