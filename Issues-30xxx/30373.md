We unify the use of the methods `tensor` vs. `tensor_product` in parent classes.

Current situation:

Category `ModulesWithBasis` provides a parent method `tensor` to construct a tensor product of modules.

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['x', 'y'])                                                                                                                
sage: C.tensor(C)                                                                                                                                                
Free module generated by {'x', 'y'} over Rational Field # Free module generated by {'x', 'y'} over Rational Field
```
It is not implemented completely for `FreeModule`

```
sage: V = FreeModule(QQ, 2)                                                                                                                                      
sage: V.tensor(V)                                                                                                                                                
AttributeError: type object 'FreeModule_ambient_field_with_category' has no attribute 'Tensor'
sage: 
```

In contrast, `FiniteRankFreeModule` (which is not in `ModulesWithBasis`) uses a parent method `tensor` to construct elements.

```
sage: F = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 2)
sage: F.tensor((2, 2))                                                                                                                                           
Type-(2,2) tensor on the 2-dimensional vector space over the Rational Field
```

`FilteredVectorSpace` has both `tensor` (from `ModulesWithBasis`) and `tensor_product`, but only the latter works.

```
sage: FV = FilteredVectorSpace(2)                                                                                                                                
sage: FV.tensor_product(FV)                                                                                                                                      
QQ^4
sage: FV.tensor(FV)                                                                                                                                              
AttributeError: type object 'FilteredVectorSpace_class_with_category' has no attribute 'Tensor'
```
The same is true for `FreeQuadraticModule_integer_symmetric`:

```
sage: L = IntegralLattice(Matrix(ZZ, 2, [2,1,1,-2]))                                                                                                             
sage: L.tensor_product(L)

AttributeError: type object 'FreeQuadraticModule_integer_symmetric_with_categor' has no attribute 'Tensor'
```


**The proposed solution in this ticket** is to standardize on the method `tensor_product`, making `tensor` a deprecated alias.  

`Modules` already has a `tensor_square` method, which `tensor_product` complements well.

We also add `tensor_power`.

No changes are made to the global `tensor` (unique instance of `TensorProductFunctor`).

Tickets:
- #31276 Tensor Product Method for `FiniteRankFreeModule`
- #34448 Put tensor modules of `FiniteRankFreeModule` in `Modules().TensorProducts()`
- #34589 `VectorFieldModule`, `TensorFieldModule`, `DiffFormModule`: Add methods `tensor_product`, `tensor_power`, update category of `TensorFieldModule`

+1. I don't have a strong opinion which one we choose. Multiple inputs feels more flexible (and doesn't need an additional bracket).

> - What about tensoring elements together? Right now the `tensor` function works on elements, although the documentation doesn't make this clear. I am happy for this to continue, but again, the syntax is different for `tensor([a,b,c])` vs. `a.tensor(b,c)`.


I like that behavior, too. However, it feels to me like this behavior was not intended and just works because the element provides a `tensor` method (that's probably why it's not mentioned in the documentation). From a mathematical-categorial viewpoint this behavior is anyway unexpected (functors usually do not act on objects of objects).

If we want to promote this, which I would agree with, the syntax should indeed be the same.

This might also be a good opportunity to introduce the ``@`` notation you have proposed in [here](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30244#comment:3) which I really like (so +1 from my side, too).

As for `FiniteRankFreeModule`, introducing methods like `tensor_product` and `tensor_power` is readily done (I already finished the former).

So, should we split the task into several pieces, and I provide the `FiniteRankFreeModule` add-on? You just have to tell me which syntax you prefer.

But the idea in principle remains, doesn't it? What about `#` instead? That's already the symbol for tensor products as in `categories/tensor.py`.

It feels rather uncanonical. But tensor products seem to be used quite frequently, so if there's no better bet...

What's your opinion on the syntax?

We should make people use the unicode `⊗` for tensor product.

More seriously, if we can switch the syntax to `tensor(a,b,c,...)` with no extra brackets, that would be nice. I don't know if any of the tensor constructors take optional arguments, so I don't know how hard that would be to implement.

So far, the `^` is not supported for exterior algebras:

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 3)
sage: AM = M.dual_exterior_power(2)
sage: a = AM.an_element()
sage: a^2
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for ^: '2nd exterior power of the dual of the 3-dimensional vector space over the Rational Field' and 'Integer Ring'

But I agree. One would rather expect `a^3 == a.wedge(a).wedge(a)` if supported.

How do we treat `^` with integers then? As a wedge product, this is the simple multiplication. And I still agree, that this case can easily be confused with the exponential since exponentiation is the standard behavior of Sage anywhere else.

FWIW, in `FiniteRankFreeModule`'s, the element tensor product is implemented via the operator `*`, i.e. via the method `__mul__`.

The branch of #34448 shows the necessary workarounds in `sage.tensors` if we wanted to keep `tensor` (not `tensor_product`) as the name of the method that implements the action of `TensorProductFunctor`: The method `FiniteRankFreeModule.tensor` would have to double both as that and as the method that construct an element.

Any thoughts which of the 2 ways to go?

I see. It wasn’t entirely clear that was the proposal.

I am maybe marginally in favor of `tensor` since we say “A tensor B” and it would create slightly tension with the functor being called `tensor` In the global namespace. For the middle example, another way out of this would be to check the types of the input.

IMO, the last two examples in the ticket description perhaps should fail because the result doesn’t know about its tensor product construction. Yes, `QQ^2 (x) QQ^2 = QQ^2 (+) QQ^2 = QQ^4`, where `=` means isomorphic as `QQ`-vector spaces here, but there are two separate canonical projections onto `QQ^2` in the middle case and a functoral way to lift up `QQ^2` endomorphisms in the first case.

The problem is that we have the clash with `FiniteRankFreeModule.tensor`.

Indeed, it is not the most clean solution, but it is a side effect of English (and Python) that we cannot easily distinguish between “a tensor in” and “the tensor with” in such a concise way.

If we rename it to `tensor_product`, then it starts working in a way that is incompatible with the tensor functor. It’s not a really big problem, but it could run into subtleties with `tensor([C, FV])` versus `tensor([FV, C])` with one of them working (and returning a wrong answer depending on the implementation that I haven’t checked) and the other not.

That is the problem. If I build an object as a tensor product (via the `tensor` functor), then it should know that because I wanted it to know that explicitly. It should advertise itself as a tensor product.

The class needs to have its own hook separate from the hook that the functor uses.

How so? The result does not know it is a tensor product of modules, and there is no canonical way to deconstruct a vector space into a tensor product. For example, a 1-dimensional module could be a `n`-fold tensor product of itself `n` times. There are no canonical isomorphisms between these spaces.

Mathematically an object *is* a tensor product if there *exists* a construction of it using the tensor functor.

In an implementation, we generally cannot know if something exists. An object is marked *as* a tensor product when the implementation has marked it as such. Like everything, this is subject to the implementation restrictions.

No, as a user. Suppose there is no such specific implementation. What should the user do?

If we wanted to talk in that level of generality, there is no category of tensor products, Cartesean products, etc.\n\n> In an implementation, we generally cannot know if something exists. An object is marked *as* a tensor product when the implementation has marked it as such. Like everything, this is subject to the implementation restrictions.\n\n\nIndeed, the category also contains some implementation requirements.

Replying to [Matthias Köppe](#comment%3A68):
> Mathematically an object *is* a tensor product if there *exists* a construction of it using the tensor functor.


Then every object is a tensor product since we can always tensor with a 1-dimensional module. If we wanted to talk in that level of generality, there is no category of tensor products, Cartesean products, etc.

> In an implementation, we generally cannot know if something exists. An object is marked *as* a tensor product when the implementation has marked it as such. Like everything, this is subject to the implementation restrictions.


Indeed, the category also contains some implementation requirements. (I would argue the tensor products category is the category with a distinguished tensor product construction, parallel to `ModulesWithBasis`.) Consequently, the result of the functor is promising certain implementation details with its codomain: such objects have methods via the category’s `ParentMethods` and provide an implementation of the corresponding ``@`abstract_methods`.

More concretely, if I had code that does:

```python
T = tensor([V,W])
for F in T.tensor_factors():
     print(F)
```
This should work whenever `T` is constructed because the codomain is `Cat.TensorProducts()`, where `Cat` is the meet of the categories of `V` and `W`. However, with changing the name, the functor now would work but the code would fail with `FilteredVectorSpace`s.

My guess is stop wishing for magical coding fairies and implement it. There is no generic way to give a tensor product the structure of a specific type of module. This essentially amounts to saying there is a canonical isomorphism between, e.g., **R**<sup>2</sup> (x) **R**<sup>3</sup> = **R**<sup>6</sup>. (Another version: How do you build a matrix from a tensor product of two matrices? There are two main ways to do this that are equivalent as they amount to choosing a different order of the isomorphism.) If a class `Foo` wants to know that a tensor product of two of itself can again be realized as an object `Foo`, then it needs to implement that and chose a specific isomorphism.

That an object in the codomain of a functor (or any morphism) must support what is required by that codomain (and should be an object such that `X in Cat` returns `True`)? I find this to actually be quite useful as I can expect certain properties to be there.

Consider the equivalent scenario: I have a function `f: ZZ -> QQ[‘s’]` that returned `0` as an integer and all non-zero elements as polynomials. You now have to write special checks for `0` rather than have it behave uniformly.

Of course I wouldn’t necessarily tell them in that way. However, unless somebody actually writes the code, then it doesn’t magically come into existence. Unfortunately, this is not the Dire Straights song “Money for Nothing”; Also Hell is full of 10 year olds who wished for exactly the same thing with the holophonor.

In this case, I believe it is impossible to implement in the level of generality you want because it amounts to making a canonical choice where there is not one.

I agree that they are useful, but you need a canonical way to do it in general. The point is that you are making an identification based upon a specific choice of isomorphism.

No, I don't think this resembles anything what I'm asking for. I think we've lost the context somewhere on the way here.

Wait, you are concerned about the identification of a module M with its 1-fold tensor product not being canonical?

Sorry, that was a bad phrasing on my part. You are asking for returning **R**<sup>6</sup> to be okay, which you have had to make a (non-canonical) choice of a isomorphism that they user has no control over. The tensor product category has a special distinguished choice of construction as a tensor product, analogous to `ModulesWithBasis` being modules with a distinguished choice of a basis.

Not specifically for the 1-fold tensor products, but more generally. This code is expected to work for arbitrary tensor products with no special cases, right? (I can also tell you about the troubles I’ve had with `PartitionTuples` of length 1 versus `Partitions`, which motivates my desire for uniformity.)

Then if you rename the functor hook to `tensor_product`, then `FilteredVectorSpace`'s method of that name would have a bug.
