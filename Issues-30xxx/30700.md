- According to the Maple docs, `fraction` as a type means “`rational` but not `integer`”, so I think this case is useless;
- numbers of type `float` can have arbitrary precision in Maple, they shouldn't blindly be converted to `RR`;
- as for `complex(extended_numeric)`, it not only recognizes arbitrary-precision complex floating-point numbers, but also exact expressions like `I/3`;
- I don't understand why you convert equations (equalities) to pairs--they are indeeed used as such in Maple, but only occasionally.

More generally, if we want a more powerful and robust Maple interface, I suspect we should use the OpenMaple C API instead of talking to the Maple shell.

Que faire pour "float" et pour "complex" ?

If you want to recognize complex floating-point numbers, use `complex(float)` instead of `complex(extended_numeric)`. You could also keep `complex(extended_numeric)` and do recursive calls on the real and imaginary parts.

Regarding the precision issue, I'm not sure what to do. Maybe decompose the number with `SFloatMantissa()` and `SFloatExponent()`, convert to integers, and look at the length of the mantissa to set the precision of the parent...

(I agree that the goal is not to have a perfect interface. The issue I have with things that “almost work” but are incorrect in general is that people start using them, and that leads to backward compatibility issues when someone tries to do them right!)

```
#! /bin/bash

if [ "$#" -lt 1 ]; then
 quoted_args=""
else
 quoted_args="$(printf " %q" "${@}")"
fi
ssh -t $HOST_WITH_MAPLE maple "$quoted_args"
