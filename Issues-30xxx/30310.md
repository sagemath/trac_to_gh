<a id='comment:12'></a>I tried to remove the redundant code and inherit from `Mutability` after #30281. For some reason, I still get a pickling error during doctest.

Furthermore, the code seems broken: `is_immutable` does not return anything:

```python
    def is_immutable(self):
        """
        ...
        """
        self._is_immutable
```

When did that happen?
