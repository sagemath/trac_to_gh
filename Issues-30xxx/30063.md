The first one needs a readjustment of the number of removed lines in https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py#n183

The ones in `integration/integral.py` are a known upstream issue since 5.43. The corresponding tests in maxima are disabled as known to fail, so maybe they can be tagged as known bug here.

The other two seem harmless.

M(1,3,x) = 1F1(1,3,x) - a.k.a Kummer function, whereas lower incomplete gamma is
gamma(a,x)=x<sup>a</sup>/a 1F1(a,a+1,-x), a=2, i.e.
the claim is that 1F1(1,3,x)=-exp(x) 1F1(2,3,-x).
So this seems to be Kummer transform from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluent_hypergeometric_function#Kummer's_transformation 

but with a wrong sign (modulo typos...)

From the maxima 5.43 change log:

* series expansion for expintegral_si and gamma_incomplete; breaks
  some existing tests, see commit 47a6afd.

From the maxima 5.44 change log:

* gamma_incomplete_lower is now returned in the noun form in many places
* Taylor expansion for gamma_incomplete_lower(1/2,z) now works
* gamma_incomplete_lower now respects gamma_expand

I note the following:

```
sage: hypergeometric_M(1, 3, 1).n()
1.43656365691809
sage: hypergeometric_M(1, 3, 1).simplify_hypergeometric()
2*e*gamma_incomplete_lower(2, 1)
sage: hypergeometric_M(1, 3, 1).simplify_hypergeometric().n()
TypeError: cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically
```

I believe `simplify_hypergeometric` is a Maxima command wrapper, so it should be completely replicated in Maxima.  By the way, in diagnosing this, a a few things to note.

```
sage: hypergeometric_M(1, 3, x)
hypergeometric_M(1, 3, x)
sage: maxima_calculus(hypergeometric_M(1,3,x))

sage: B.generalized()
hypergeometric((1,), (3,), x)
sage: maxima_calculus(B.generalized())
hypergeometric([1],[3],_SAGE_VAR_x)
```
and also don't forget

```
sage: B.simplify_hypergeometric(algorithm='sage')

```
Unfortunately I don't have a chance to check out this update in order to diagnose the problem further.  I do note that the `hgfred` uses `maxima` and not `maxima_calculus`, though perhaps it is imported as such earlier in the file.

I was working on upgrading Maxima too (as i did not see that ticket), so while i am not a symbolics expert, i fixed the `gamma_incomplete_lower` issue: that function was called `gamma_greek` by Maxima before.

I also marked the intergration regression as known bug.

I think it is ready for review now.

That was merged three months ago. I have rebuild and|or ipgraded my `sage` installation a few times since, and this never happened.

Furthermore, I tried reconfiguring with `./configure CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9 FC=gfortran-9 --enable-download-from-upstream-url` ; `configure` now wants to install a bunch of system packages that *were* accepted before. Its answers :

```
configure: notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages: cbc coxeter3 fflas_ffpack gfortran gsl iml openblas r suitesparse
checking for the package system in use... debian
configure: hint: installing the following system packages is recommended and may avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
configure:   $ sudo apt-get update 
  $ sudo apt-get install coinor-cbc coinor-libcbc-dev fflas-ffpack gfortran libgsl-dev libiml-dev libopenblas-dev r-base-dev r-cran-lattice libsuitesparse-dev
configure: After installation, re-run configure using:
configure:   $ ./config.status --recheck && ./config.status
```

Attempting a (simulated) installation tells me that all those packages are already at their latest versions... and the check fails again.

I'm afraid to be stuck...

Okay. `ptestlong` gives me the same (unrelated) failures as what I have already reported since `9.2.beta3` (IIRC).

Concerning comment 23 :

```
sage: hypergeometric_M(1, 3, x).simplify_hypergeometric()                       
-2*((x + 1)*e^(-x) - 1)*e^x/x^2
sage: hypergeometric_M(1, 3, x).simplify_hypergeometric().factor()              
-2*(x - e^x + 1)/x^2
```

which seems kosher :

```
sage: mathematica.FullSimplify(hypergeometric_M(1, 3, x)).sage().factor()       
-2*(x - e^x + 1)/x^2
```

==> (tentative) `positive_review`.

As always, cross-checks on various platforms are more than useful.

[ Only incidentally related... ] : I **//sternuously//** object to have to retain obsolete versions of the compilers in order to be able to compile *without being told so*. This problem, which appears only in *some* platforms, should be documented in the `README.md` ; furthermore, `./configure` should :
* suggest the installation of the relevant packages for older versions (recompiling the `gcc` smalah takes a geological age or two...), **and**
* suggest reconfiguring with the relevant arguments.

Where should this rant be *usefully* posted ? I am aware of too much tickets related to system configuration and options, and am a bit lost...

It goes far beyond my skills, as i never wrote a single line of lisp.

The best i can do is to [report the regression upstream](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3649/) and follow its evolution to untag the corresponding doctest once it is fixed. I am not sure this regression should prevent us to update Maxima.

You can also open a new ticket for tracking that upstream report so we don't lose it (as opposed to only noticing the doctest change if Maxima fixes this, if anyone even tests the "known bug" doctests much).  I agree that if there is significant improvement introduced, then in practice we have often upgraded on a utilitarian view of things.
