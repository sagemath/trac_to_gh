(split out from #29013)

As of #32442, `./configure --with-sage-venv=no` just means: Keep SAGE_VENV the same as SAGE_LOCAL.

In this ticket we add support for a new option, perhaps `./configure --with-sage-venv=none`, which would suppress making any Python venv and suppress building any Python packages.
(Using the mechanism of disablable installation trees from #31356, #32759.)

In this configuration, `sage_conf` cannot be built as a wheel, so we only build an sdist (using `sage-bootstrap-python`!) and store that in `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/wheels`.

Also, the default target `all-start` makes no sense, and also the docbuild cannot be done. Instead, the default would be to build only the target `all-sage` (which would be modified to remove the unnecessary special case `sagelib`).

This is for users who prefer to install Python packages into their own virtual environments using standard Python tools.

To disable building Python packages, the make targets would be replaced by dummy targets in the same way as it is done for packages found by spkg-configure.

In addition, this could go through #30383 ("configure --disable-SPKG" for standard packages) so that `configure` already shows that the build is disabled for Python packages.
