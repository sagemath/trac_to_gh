(split out from #29013)

As of #32442, `./configure --with-sage-venv=no` just means: Keep SAGE_VENV the same as SAGE_LOCAL.

In this ticket we add support for a new option, perhaps `./configure --with-sage-venv=none`, which would suppress making any Python venv and suppress building any Python packages.
(Using the mechanism of disablable installation trees from #31356, #32759.)

In this configuration, `sage_conf` cannot be built as a wheel, so we only build an sdist (using `sage-bootstrap-python`!) and store that in `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/wheels`.

Also, the default target `all-start` makes no sense, and also the docbuild cannot be done. Instead, the default would be to build only the target `all-sage` (which would be modified to remove the unnecessary special case `sagelib`).

This is for users who prefer to install Python packages into their own virtual environments using standard Python tools.
