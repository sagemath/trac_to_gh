```
We handle a new optional argument to `sage-spkg`, which sets the installation tree - the new variable `SAGE_INST_LOCAL` (default:  `$SAGE_LOCAL`) for the package installation scripts.  (The script `sage-spkg-uninstall` already accepts this optional argument.)

We also move the definition of `SAGE_SPKG_INST` and `SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS` out of `build/bin/install` into `sage-spkg` (and into `Makefile.in` for script packages). This is so that they can depend on `SAGE_INST_LOCAL`.

Thus, the installation location of the installation records now depends on the installation tree - it is `$SAGE_INST_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/{installed,scripts,wheels}`.

This is preparation for #29013 - which proposes to install Python packages in `$SAGE_VENV` instead of `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

<a id='comment:30'></a>There is two small things that could be fixed along the way:
- `make dist` does not appear in `make --help`.
- `local/bin/sage-sdist` claims it should be called by `spkg/bin/sage`, but it is really run by `local/bin/sage`.

The error message `This Makefile needs to be invoked by build/make/install` seems strange, as there is at least one other legal way to call the Makefile, as we discovered here. If it is not included in the message, I think the comment should be more verbose.
