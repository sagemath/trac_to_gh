In general you can use ``@`overload` for methods to provide a more refined typing information depending on the type of the arguments, in particular, also of self.
For example,

```
    @overload
    def method(self: 'MyClass', other: 'OtherClass') -> 'ReturnClass':
        pass

    def method(self: Any, other: Any) -> Any:
        ....
```

The category framework probably needs further work to be able to provide meaningful typing information. One way path would be to use generics. For example, [sage.categories.action.Action](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/coercion/sage/categories/action.html) could be declared as

```
G = TypeVar('G') # possibly with some constraints
S = TypeVar('S')

class Action(Generic[G, S]):

   def __init__(G: G, S: S):
       ....
   
   def actor(self) -> G:
       ....

   def codomain(self) -> S:
       ...
```

I'm in favor of using the future import, since this can easily be migrated once only >= python 3.9 is supported (by simply removing the import).

I think it's a good idea to specify the complete typing information, so also specify the type of the list items, i.e. `List[str]` instead of only `List`. Same for the iterator.
