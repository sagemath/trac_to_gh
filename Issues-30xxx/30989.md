I think it would be slightly premature to add more typing here, without thinking in general about the relationship with the Parent/Element framework.

Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A8):
> I was wondering how to add typing information explaining that the output type has the same "Parent" as self.


In general you can use `@overload` for methods to provide a more refined typing information depending on the type of the arguments, in particular, also of self.
For example,

```
    @overload
    def method(self: 'MyClass', other: 'OtherClass') -> 'ReturnClass':
        pass

    def method(self: Any, other: Any) -> Any:
        ....
```

The category framework probably needs further work to be able to provide meaningful typing information. One way path would be to use generics. For example, [sage.categories.action.Action](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/coercion/sage/categories/action.html) could be declared as

```
G = TypeVar('G') # possibly with some constraints
S = TypeVar('S')

class Action(Generic[G, S]):

   def __init__(G: G, S: S):
       ....
   
   def actor(self) -> G:
       ....

   def codomain(self) -> S:
       ...
```

To my understanding, type annotations themselves are supported in Python 3.6. 
`from `__future__` import annotations` is for "postponed evaluation of annotations" (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/) 

I think the annotations added on this ticket do not need `from `__future__` import annotations` - so this line can be removed and the dependency can be dropped

If you don't want to use `__future__`, then you have to use `List[Tuple[...]]` from `typing`, and also sometimes wrap typing information in strings (e.g. so that you don't run into issues with forward references).
I'm in favor of using the future import, since this can easily be migrated once only >= python 3.9 is supported (by simply removing the import).

I think it's a good idea to specify the complete typing information, so also specify the type of the list items, i.e. `List[str]` instead of only `List`. Same for the iterator.
