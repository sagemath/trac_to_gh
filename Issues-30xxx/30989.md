One suggestion for improvement: for lists, tuple and iterators there are special typing annotation that allow to specify also the type of elements in these lists, e.g. https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Iterator
After `from __future__ import annotations`, you can simply write `list[str]` for a list of strings.

Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A8):
> I was wondering how to add typing information explaining that the output type has the same "Parent" as self.


In general you can use ``@`overload` for methods to provide a more refined typing information depending on the type of the arguments, in particular, also of self.
For example,

```
    @overload
    def method(self: 'MyClass', other: 'OtherClass') -> 'ReturnClass':
        pass

    def method(self: Any, other: Any) -> Any:
        ....
```

The category framework probably needs further work to be able to provide meaningful typing information. One way path would be to use generics. For example, [sage.categories.action.Action](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/coercion/sage/categories/action.html) could be declared as

```
G = TypeVar('G') # possibly with some constraints
S = TypeVar('S')

class Action(Generic[G, S]):

   def __init__(G: G, S: S):
       ....
   
   def actor(self) -> G:
       ....

   def codomain(self) -> S:
       ...
```

To my understanding, type annotations themselves are supported in Python 3.6. 
`from __future__ import annotations` is for "postponed evaluation of annotations" (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/) 

I think the annotations added on this ticket do not need `from __future__ import annotations` - so this line can be removed and the dependency can be dropped

If you don't want to use `__future__`, then you have to use `List[Tuple[...]]` from `typing`, and also sometimes wrap typing information in strings (e.g. so that you don't run into issues with forward references).
I'm in favor of using the future import, since this can easily be migrated once only >= python 3.9 is supported (by simply removing the import).

I think it's a good idea to specify the complete typing information, so also specify the type of the list items, i.e. `List[str]` instead of only `List`. Same for the iterator.
