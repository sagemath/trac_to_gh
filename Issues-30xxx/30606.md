Currently, if a `Feature` is keyed to an `spkg`, a `FeatureNotPresentError` recommends to use `sage -i` to install the package.

When `SAGE_ROOT` (or `sage_bootstrap`, see #29039) is available, we can do better: 

1. We can recommend equivalent system packages for package systems available on the present system.

2. Moreover, if `SAGE_ROOT/bin/sage-spkg` is not available, then we remove the recommendation to use `sage -i`. This is for the benefit of distribution packaging.

   (Distribution packages would typically not install `sage-spkg`, so this information is automatically suppressed -- no more patching is necessary.)

3. Finally, for Python packages that have a `requirements.txt` (see #30024), we also show a `pip` invocation.
 
(1. and 3. depend on a few scripts from `SAGE_ROOT/build/bin` to be available in the `PATH`. Distribution packages could consider to install these scripts; perhaps, in some libexec-style directory.  Also, `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/*/requirements.txt` and `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/*/distros/` need to be made available at runtime.)


We also add the names of the detected package systems to the default optional tags in use by doctests.

IMHO it's better to put "noise" here - you can edit later on - than on a list with a much larger readership.

Anyhow, changing Python needs a big rebuild (of everything depending on Python), so the error looks unsurprising.

I did few tests, I get:

```
sage: from sage.features import package_systems
sage: package_systems()
[Feature('debian'), Feature('sage_spkg'), Feature('pip')]
```

So this looks good:

```
sage: from sage.features import PackageSystem
sage: PackageSystem('condaa').is_present()
FeatureTestResult('condaa', False)
sage: PackageSystem('conda').is_present()
FeatureTestResult('conda', False)
sage: PackageSystem('debian').is_present()
FeatureTestResult('debian', True)
```

It seems one needs to avoid `PackageSystem('sage_spkg')`:

```
sage: from sage.features import SagePackageSystem
sage: A = PackageSystem('sage_spkg')
sage: B = SagePackageSystem()
sage: A
Feature('sage_spkg')
sage: B
Feature('sage_spkg')
sage: A.is_present()        # expecting True
FeatureTestResult('sage_spkg', False)
sage: B.is_present()
FeatureTestResult('sage_spkg', True)
```

Similarly, 

```
sage: PackageSystem('pip').is_present()   # I was expecting True here
FeatureTestResult('pip', False)
```

The following looks good:

```
sage: PackageSystem('pip').spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'To install jupyterlab using the pip package manager, you can try to run:\n!sage -pip install jupyterlab~=2.2.5'
sage: from sage.features import PipPackageSystem
sage: PipPackageSystem().is_present()
FeatureTestResult('pip', True)
sage: PipPackageSystem().spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'To install jupyterlab using the pip package manager, you can try to run:\n!sage -pip install jupyterlab~=2.2.5'
sage: SagePackageSystem().spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'To install jupyterlab using the Sage package manager, you can try to run:\n  !sage -i jupyterlab'
```

The following does not look good (or maybe it is?):

```
sage: PackageSystem('debian').spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'No equivalent system packages for debian are known to Sage.'
```

I didn't implement delegation to the correct class by name -- note that also `Feature` does not do that even though the default repr seems to suggest unique representation behavior of this kind:

It is correct because so far there is no system package information for this package -- `build/pkgs/jupyterlab/distros` does not exist.
