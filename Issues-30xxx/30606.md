Currently, if a `Feature` is keyed to an `spkg`, a `FeatureNotPresentError` recommends to use `sage -i` to install the package.

When `SAGE_ROOT` (or `sage_bootstrap`, see #29039) is available, we can do better: 

1. We can recommend equivalent system packages for package systems available on the present system.

2. Moreover, if `SAGE_ROOT/bin/sage-spkg` is not available, then we remove the recommendation to use `sage -i`. This is for the benefit of distribution packaging.

   (Distribution packages would typically not install `sage-spkg`, so this information is automatically suppressed -- no more patching is necessary.)

3. Finally, for Python packages that have a `requirements.txt` (see #30024), we also show a `pip` invocation.
 
(1. and 3. depend on a few scripts from `SAGE_ROOT/build/bin` to be available in the `PATH`. Distribution packages could consider to install these scripts; perhaps, in some libexec-style directory.  Also, `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/*/requirements.txt` and `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/*/distros/` need to be made available at runtime.)


We also add the names of the detected package systems to the default optional tags in use by doctests.

<a id='comment:28'></a>I did few tests, I get:

```
sage: from sage.features import package_systems
sage: package_systems()
[Feature('debian'), Feature('sage_spkg'), Feature('pip')]
```

So this looks good:

```
sage: from sage.features import PackageSystem
sage: PackageSystem('condaa').is_present()
FeatureTestResult('condaa', False)
sage: PackageSystem('conda').is_present()
FeatureTestResult('conda', False)
sage: PackageSystem('debian').is_present()
FeatureTestResult('debian', True)
```

It seems one needs to avoid `PackageSystem('sage_spkg')`:

```
sage: from sage.features import SagePackageSystem
sage: A = PackageSystem('sage_spkg')
sage: B = SagePackageSystem()
sage: A
Feature('sage_spkg')
sage: B
Feature('sage_spkg')
sage: A.is_present()        # expecting True
FeatureTestResult('sage_spkg', False)
sage: B.is_present()
FeatureTestResult('sage_spkg', True)
```

Similarly, 

```
sage: PackageSystem('pip').is_present()   # I was expecting True here
FeatureTestResult('pip', False)
```

The following looks good:

```
sage: PackageSystem('pip').spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'To install jupyterlab using the pip package manager, you can try to run:\n!sage -pip install jupyterlab~=2.2.5'
sage: from sage.features import PipPackageSystem
sage: PipPackageSystem().is_present()
FeatureTestResult('pip', True)
sage: PipPackageSystem().spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'To install jupyterlab using the pip package manager, you can try to run:\n!sage -pip install jupyterlab~=2.2.5'
sage: SagePackageSystem().spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'To install jupyterlab using the Sage package manager, you can try to run:\n  !sage -i jupyterlab'
```

The following does not look good (or maybe it is?):

```
sage: PackageSystem('debian').spkg_installation_hint('jupyterlab')
'No equivalent system packages for debian are known to Sage.'
```

I didn't implement delegation to the correct class by name -- note that also `Feature` does not do that even though the default repr seems to suggest unique representation behavior of this kind:

```
sage: from sage.features.bliss import Bliss

It is correct because so far there is no system package information for this package -- `build/pkgs/jupyterlab/distros` does not exist.
