I know.

#30549 is a patchbomb already and I'm trying to make it as easy as possible.
Everything is used in there.
The idea was to outsource stuff that can be easily reviewed.

One could of course add a `pyx` file solely that tries to test things.

Thank you.

Btw, at some point soon, I will have to move this file again, as there is at least two other places in sage that can use this algorithm. This might involve some renaming.

Maybe it might be a good idea to do this now and reopen this ticket. What do you think?
