<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

I would like to review this ticket. But I have few questions before.

I had in mind to test if I can build cryptominisat using that updated version of cmake. But, I am surprised to see that I have cryptominisat installed, but not cmake in my recent build of sage:

```
$ sage -version
SageMath version 9.2.beta9, Release Date: 2020-08-18
$ sage -optional
...
cmake...................................3.11.0 (not_installed)
coxeter3................................8ac9c71723c8ca5...
cryptominisat...........................5.6.8 (5.6.8)
...
```

But cmake is a dependency of cryptominisat:

```
$ cat build/pkgs/cryptominisat/dependencies 
$(PYTHON) m4ri zlib libpng | cmake sqlite boost_cropped

----------
All lines of this file are ignored except the first.
It is copied by SAGE_ROOT/build/make/install into SAGE_ROOT/build/make/Makefile.
```

Is cmake really used/installed when I compile cryptominisat?

Is it because I wrote `--enable-cryptominisat` but not `--enable-cmake` in my `./configure`? I thought that `cmake` would be automatically enabled?

```
$ head config.log 
This file contains any messages produced by compilers while
running configure, to aid debugging if configure makes a mistake.

It was created by Sage configure 9.2.beta9, which was
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.69.  Invocation command line was

  $ ./configure --enable-experimental-packages --enable-download-from-upstream-url --enable-ccache --enable-dot2tex --enable-rst2ipynb --enable-openssl --enable-cbc --enable-cryptominisat --enable-pycosat --enable-glucose --enable-sage_numerical_backends_coin --enable-pynormaliz --enable-latte_int --enable-awali --enable-fricas

## --------- ##
## Platform. ##

Is `.configure --enable-cmake` enough?

I managed to install cmake 3.17.3 correctly. I tested that cryptominisat which depends on cmake installs correctly. The following part of the log of cryptominisat install confirms me that it used the version cmake 3.17.3 I just installed:

```
CMake Warning (dev) at /home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/local/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:272 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (VALGRIND)
  does not match the name of the calling package (Valgrind).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
```

For me it is a positive review. I let Matthias change the status of this ticket to positive review  OR update the branch to 3.17.4 and keep it as needs review.
