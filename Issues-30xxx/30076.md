<a id='comment:15'></a>This could be better for french in `src/doc/fr/tutorial/introduction.rst`

```diff
--  **Interface graphique (« notebook ») :** démarrer `sage -n jupyter`; lire 
-   `Jupyter documentation on-line <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html>`_ ;
+-  **Interface graphique (« notebook ») :** démarrer `sage -n jupyter`; lire la
+   `documentation en ligne de Jupyter <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html>`_ ;
```
But it's true that the current form clearly indicates that the on-line documentation of jupyter is in english.

<a id='comment:26'></a>Sorry I didn't pay attention to this ticket in the past month
and only realise now...

I would have suggested to keep the "sws to other formats"
converters for a year.

This would give time to migrate legacy worksheets, matching
our one-year deprecation period.

Of course, people can always download Sage 9.1, or find it on CoCalc...
for a while.
