Should `sage-explorer` be made an optional or standard package?



Also, does it work with jupyterlab?

I like the idea :-) We are indeed reaching the time where sage-explorer
could reach prime time. It has little dependencies and is unlikely
to break anything except itself, so it does not  add much technical debt
to Sage. Also it's the kind of tool that is useful if you have it right
under hand. So yeah, standard package makes sense. Maybe after a test
period as optional if this is still the standard practice.

As far as I remember it's supposed to work with JupyterLab. I just made
a quick test, and things seem to be fine.
