We gather and clean up compiler flags. Also we

- add `--enable-fat-binary` to `configure` (as an alternative to setting `SAGE_FAT_BINARY`)
- add `--enable_debug={no|symbols|yes}` as alternative to setting `SAGE_DEBUG`
- compile with `-Og -g` if `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`
- compile with `-O2` if `SAGE_DEBUG=no` (some packages with `O3` instead)
- compile with `-O2 -g` otherwise (some packages with `O3` instead)

During the build of Sage there are now flags that can be exported
in `spkg_install.in` with one line, instead of checking `SAGE_DEBUG`
etc. for each individual package, e.g. by

- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS` (redundant, use flags as above)
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3` (`O3` instead of `O2`, but only if not in debug mode)
- `export CFLAGS=$ORIGINAL_CFLAGS` (use `$CFLAGS` as set before `configure`)

Likewise we do with `CXXFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, `F77FLAGS`.

We try to respect the user's choice and do not overwrite the flags if already
set by the user, but only add compile flags if necessary for packages to work.

Inidividual packages can still be compiled with specified flags or in debug mode using

```
make CFLAGS=-O2 some-package
```
or

```
make SAGE_DEBUG="yes" some-package
```
This ticket prepares #27122, which adds `-march=native` to the defaults.

One point that probably needs discussion is the following.

When an spkg is built, the current design of `sage-spkg` is to create a self-contained script `spkg-install` that sets all necessary environment variables (by sourcing `sage-env` etc.). (This makes it relatively easy to debug the installation process.)

Making package installs depend on exported environment variables in `Makefile.in` breaks this design.

It would probably be better to create a new script `sage-build-env` (to complement `sage-build-env-config`) to take care of these environment variable settings.

Ok, I think I'm beginning to understand.

Create a new file `build/bin/sage-build-env.in` and move the stuff that I added to the makefile there?

Then make sure `build/bin/sage-build-env` is added to the correct places?

Why should I not add the things to `build/bin/sage-build-env-config` directly?

Yes

Just a suggestion, to keep the analogy to `src/bin/sage-env` (which implements some logic) and `src/bin/sage-env-config` (which purely sets some variables).  Not very important.

But it seems that this is no longer applied. If I configure with some `CFLAGS`, it seems that when making still the standard `CFLAGS` are applied. It is consistent with the `CFLAGS` in `sage -sh` at least.

I don't understand anything at this point anymore.

- 

```
$ export CFLAGS='-march=native'
$ export CXXFLAGS='-O1'
$ ./configure
$ sage --buildsh
echo $CFLAGS
-march=native
echo $CXXFLAGS
-O1
```
  Okay, this is exactly what we want. But 

```
export CFLAGS='-march=native'
./configure CXXFLAGS='-O1'
sage --buildsh
echo $CFLAGS
-march=native
echo $CXXFLAGS
-march=native
```
  Why? `build/bin/sage-build-env-config` was configured exactly the same. However, if you `echo $CXXFLAGS` at the start of `build/bin/sage-build-env/config`, you see that `CXXFLAGS` was already set to `-march=native`. Were does this come from?

A suggestion: 

Set similar shell variables in `build/bin/sage-build-env-config.in` that are set in `src/bin/sage-env-config.in`:

```
CONFIGURED_CC="@CC@"
CONFIGURED_CXX="@CXX@"
CONFIGURED_FC="@FC@"
CONFIGURED_OBJC="@OBJC@"
CONFIGURED_OBJCXX="@OBJCXX@"
```
and move all code for modifying environment variables such as CFLAGS to one place, `build/bin/sage-build-env`...

Should I remove the printing of things in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4`.

The only thing that really needs to done there, is to check whether `-march=native` is supported in general (not this ticket). Everything else we redo later anyway.

Ok, I just went ahead an did this. It's a lot simpler now. Almost everything is at one place.
`configure.ac` needs to save the flags and `build/bin/sage-build-env-config.in` picks them up again as `CONFIGURED_CFLAGS` etc.

One thing is actually strange.

I guess the `gfortran` or something else sets the default `FCFLAGS` to ` -ffree-form`.

I didn't consider this, so efficiently `-O2 -g` isn't added anymore.

It works. But it's probably not perfect.

It appears that this is set by the gfortran configure. It is definitely in the compiled configure 

```
for ac_flag in none -ffree-form -FR -free -qfree -Mfree -Mfreeform
```

I suppose that is enforced by `AC_FC_FREEFORM` and will end up adding something to `FCFLAGS`.

Actually, replacing `AC_SUBST(FCFLAGS, "$FCFLAGS")` by `AC_SUBST(CONFIGURED_FCFLAGS, "$FCFLAGS")`, does the job.

Apparently this is somewhat split into two. First we set `FCFLAGS=$FLAGS` and later the substitution is triggered. So any changes that are applied later to `FCFLAGS` will still have an effect, but not if we change the name.

Now that apparently the `gfortran` configure changes `FCLFAGS` is a different story.

So, `AC_FC_FREEFORM` has added ` -ffree-form` to my flags, because it feels that this is needed. So I think, we should either respect that or not call `AC_FC_FREEFORM`.

If we want to respect this (starting with this ticket), what do you think would be the best way? Somehow I must store that `FCFLAGS` wasn't set by the user and I may add our defaults to this.

We run this to find out whether the configured Fortran compiler has a free form mode.

We do this for our decision whether we have to install gfortran or not.

But it must be up to the individual packages how they invoke the Fortran compiler.

Your proposed change does not work. `AC_PROG_CC()` changes the value of `CFLAGS` if not set. `AC_SUBST(CFLAGS, "$CFLAGS")` will implicitly set `CFLAGS` (even though possibly to the empty value), but prevents `AC_PROG_CC` from messing with it.

I could deal with it the same way, I did with the `FCFLAGS` and save all of those flags beforehand. Maybe that is cleaner.
