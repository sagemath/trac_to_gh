In Sage 9.2.beta3, the following code

```
sage: f(x) = x + 1                                                                                  
sage: point((0, f(0)), size=60)                                                                     
```
results in a plot with two points located at (0,0) and (1,0), instead of a single point at (0,1).
Both

```
sage: point([(0, f(0))], size=60)
```
and 

```
sage: point([(0, RR(f(0)))], size=60)
```
give the correct result.

Sage 9.2 is free from this bug; it might have been introduced in #16804, which has been merged in Sage 9.3.beta2.

`z in RR` would seem more natural. On the other hand, we have

```
sage: f(x) = x + 1                                                                                  
sage: z = f(0)                                                                                      
sage: %timeit z in RR                                                                               
5.96 µs ± 31.1 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
sage: %timeit complex(z).imag == 0

Right. Even `not bool(complex(z).imag)` is slightly faster.
