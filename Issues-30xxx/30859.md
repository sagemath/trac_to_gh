... including for packages that we cannot use (yet)

This is for several purposes:
- Test proper isolation of our build (i.e., the presence of unused system packages do not break our build) using `tox -e ...-maximal`
- Testing sagelib without Sage-the-distribution (similar to #28745/#30845 for conda)
- Preparation for tickets that will add `spkg-configure.m4`

(from #30371)
