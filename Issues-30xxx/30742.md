Hi frederic, if I am right you are using libgiac to compute the limit so I don't think that it is natural that 

```
(exp(-x)/(2+sin(x))).limit(x=oo, algorithm='giac')
```
also starts the external giac program. The guilty are the 3 lines with ._giac_()

```
from sage.libs.giac.giac import libgiac
        f = ex._giac_()
        v = v._giac_()
        a = a._giac_()
```
I guess you wanted to use the keywords convertions defined for the giac interface?
libgiac uses this filter automatically when the following condition is satisfied (line902 of giac.pyx)

```
if isinstance(s,Expression):
```
so it is nearly useless except that the Pb here is that `oo` is not an Expression, so `a` will not be converted by libgiac. Is there a better way to test all the instances that need convertions?


On the other hand, for the moment we can do as you did but without starting the external giac.
I think that

```
        from sage.libs.giac.giac import libgiac
        f = ex._giac_init_()
        v = v._giac_init_()
        a = a._giac_init_()
        if dir is None:
            l = libgiac.limit(f, v, a).sage()
```
}}}
does the convertion without starting the external giac program.

about the string that appear the first time you load the giac library I can't remove it from giacpy its from the c++ library. So in doctests I usually add a line to load the library before the actual doctests with a random flag

```
    sage: from sage.libs.giac.giac import libgiac     # random
```
