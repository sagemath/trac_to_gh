The `volume` and `triangulate` methods for polytopes
over inexact rings can fail with `ZeroDivisionError`.

For example, define the following polytope:

```
sage: pts = [(-0.1113445378, -0.55567226889999999, 1),
....:        (1.0063025210000001, -0.49684873950000003, 0),
....:        (1, 0, 1),
....:        (2, 0, 0),
....:        (-0.56836734690000001, -0.13673469390000001, 1),
....:        (-0.53979591839999996, 0.92040816329999997, 0),
....:        (0, 1, 1),
....:        (0, 2, 0)]
sage: P = Polyhedron(backend='cdd', base_ring=RDF, vertices=pts)
```

Trying to triangulate it or to compute its volume,
we get a zero division error:

```
sage: P.volume()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ZeroDivisionError: input matrix must be nonsingular
```

```
sage: P.triangulate()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ZeroDivisionError: input matrix must be nonsingular
```

The problem happens inside the method `placing_triangulation` of `PointConfiguration`. Specifically, in the following line:

```
        simplices = [frozenset(P.contained_simplex(large=True))]
```
This line produces a list with different ordering in different sage sessions. So you may need to run the above code more than one time to reproduce the problem.

(The bug was reported by Günter Rote. It appeared when he was trying to compute the volume of the polytope P given above.)

Original discussion:

- [sage-devel, 2020-10-02, Polytope triangulation fails sometimes on polytopes with non-precise vertices](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/EADGEnBPftA/discussion)

To get the volume, a workaround is suggested by [comment:3](#comment%3A3) below:

```
sage: P.change_ring(QQ).volume().n()
1.98224843509406
```

This ticket proposes to catch the `ZeroDivisionError` and
fail with in informative error message and a suggestion
to work over the rationals.

Ok. Traced it back:

```
2044                 v = point.reduced_affine_vector() - origin.reduced_affine_vector()
2045                 if v*normal>0:
2046                     visible_facets.append(facet)
```

in `geometry/triangulation/point_triangulation.py`. I'm not sure, what is the best alternative. I replaced `0` by `0.000001` and it works just fine.

How is one supposed to check this? Is there a good way to check whether the scalar product of two vectors is positive, which considers their norm etc. in case of inexactness?

Ok. I agree with you that if we really want to support triangulation for reals, then we should do via some other package. I also don't think this is a priority. (Note that I solved #29176 by using `cdd`s incidence matrix, because our way of figuring when a scalar is zero, is just not as good as theirs.) 

In the meantime: How about changing backend to `field` (inexpensive) for computing the volume as you suggested?

I really don't like the traceback and it is not documented that we do not expect this to work. So naturally people will file a bug report.

More on the thin simplices in [comment:3](#comment%3A3).

Start with the points from the initial report:

```
sage: pts = [(-0.1113445378, -0.55567226889999999, 1),
....:        (1.0063025210000001, -0.49684873950000003, 0),
....:        (1, 0, 1),
....:        (2, 0, 0),
....:        (-0.56836734690000001, -0.13673469390000001, 1),
....:        (-0.53979591839999996, 0.92040816329999997, 0),
....:        (0, 1, 1),
....:        (0, 2, 0)]
```

Construct the corresponding polytope over `RDF`:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(backend='cdd', base_ring=RDF, vertices=pts)
```

Plotting it reveals a polyhedron with six quadrilateral faces:

```
sage: p = P.plot(threejs_flat_shading=True)
sage: p.show(frame=False)
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object
```

Changing the base ring to the rationals splits some of the faces:

```
sage: Q = P.change_ring(QQ)
sage: q = Q.plot(threejs_flat_shading=True)
sage: q.show(frame=False)
```

The simplex from [comment:3](#comment%3A3) corresponds to one of those split faces:

```
sage: S = Polyhedron(Q.vertices()[0:4])
sage: S.volume().n()
1.62487829158265e-17
sage: s = S.plot(threejs_flat_shading=True)
sage: s.show(frame=False)
```

To see all the simplices, first triangulate:

```
sage: T = Q.triangulate()
sage: T
(<0,1,2,3>, <0,1,3,4>, <0,2,3,6>, <0,3,4,6>,
 <1,3,4,7>, <1,4,5,7>, <3,4,6,7>, <4,5,6,7>)
```

Plot all the simplices together:

```
sage: simplices = [Polyhedron([Q.Vrepresentation(i) for i in t]) for t in T]
sage: opts = {'threejs_flat_shading': True, 'alpha': 0.2}
sage: plot_simplex = lambda s: s.plot(fill=(random(), random(), random()), **opts)
sage: simplex_plots = [plot_simplex(s) for s in simplices]
sage: sum(simplex_plots).show(frame=False)
```

Or individually; two of them are very flat and correspond to faces of P:

```
sage: skeleton = Q.plot(fill=False)
sage: _ = any((skeleton + s).show() for s in simplex_plots)
```

I propose to repurpose this ticket to:

- Improve `triangulate` and `volume` for polytopes over inexact rings

The improvement could consist in

- catching any `ZeroDivisionError` and fail with a more helpful error message
- for volume computations, suggest trying `P.change_ring(QQ).volume().n()`

The combinatorics are fine. As mentioned earlier ‘cdd‘ computes the incidence matrix just fine (in many scenarios) and we now use this instead of recomputing. Faces should just be set up with the correct dimension from the combinatorics. That is a two line fix, which should be done.

Of course we cannot beat the backend. If the backend fails, we can't do anything (which is not the case here).

No, my point is that you can't really talk about combinatorics here - as you need a new definition of what an "approximate facet" is.

That the backend thinks that there 4 vectors with RDF coordinates are coplanar only makes sense if your affine hyperplanes are actually pairs of sufficiently close parallel hyperplanes. There are no real facets in the RDF world, only these "thick" facets.
(Needless to say, vertices are also not points, they are balls of radius depending on the precision of your RDF).

‘cdd‘ takes care of those things and figures out an incidence matrix for it.
 I think we should just use it and e.g. set up faces with the dimension determined by the indices.

As for the volume, center or center of mass, it does not make a difference wether vertices are are coplanar or not.

Anyway, I don't exactly get your point. Do you disagree with the direction the ticket goes? Do you want to point out that no matter how much we work, inexact polyhedra will remain inperfect?

I doubt that `cdd` uses the needed extra precision etc to get a robust answer.
One can potentially end up with an incidence matrix that just cannot correspond to a polytope.

I am not sure. I'd rather be on  a safe side and error out if the dimension is wrong.

IMHO the volume is computed by triangulating first, and this step may fail.

This is why we compute everything twice with `cdd`. If we start from the vertices, we check that feeding in the output (facets), we get somewhat the original vertices back. So we check whether the computation of `cdd` is at least consistent (this step already fails for many non-trivial polyhedra).

Of course the answer is wrong, if we require that points are exactly coplanar.
If you don't like the answer that `cdd` is giving you, you just should not use it.
You are free to use exact arithmetic anytime you want.

As explained above for the volume you can just change to `QQ` and get an answer which is approximately correct. That in `QQ` some of the faces break, won't matter for the volume.

Does the consistency of cdd output guarantees that the answer mathematically makes sense, e.g. does not violate Euler formula?

My point is that Sage should not silently lead the user up the garden path into a place with facets of  wrong dimension and all that.

I would personally never work with inexact polyhedra, but I can see that they sometimes arise and sometimes you want a good guess, what this polyhedron actually is.

What is it, you are suggesting?

- Completely ban inexact polyhedra?
- Always raise a warning, no matter if we detected inconsistency or not? Something as: "inexact polyhedra may fail dramatically"
- Something else?
