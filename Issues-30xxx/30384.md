The NEP 29 policy (https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html) aims to "standardiz[e] a recommendation for project support of minimum Python and NumPy versions [to] improve downstream project planning."
With this ticket, we adopt this deprecation policy of old Python versions for the Sage library.

According to NEP 29 support for Python 3.7 should be dropped in December 2021. Actually doing this will be subject of a new ticket that should be merged at the beginning of the 9.6 release cycle.

https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.2#Support_for_Python_3.6.2C_3.8.2C_and_3.9_added
already declares the Sage 9.2 conforms to NEP 29.

I think the only thing missing is to add some sentences to the developer manual.

I don't think we need a vote. In general there seems to be limited interest in discussing release policies.

NEP 29 is actually quite explicit about that one should drop support after the 42 months, e.g "On Jun 23, 2020 drop support for Python 3.6 (initially released on Dec 23, 2016)".

Should I initiate a discussion on the mailing list, or do you want to do this?

But I agree that this wasn't clear from the formulation so far. Changed the text and ticket description to hopefully clear up this confusion.
