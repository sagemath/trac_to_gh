In #30563 one particular setting of `MAXIMA` used in sage-on-gentoo (`maximax -l ecl`) was extensively tested when applied to `bin/sage`. It unfortunately hadn't been so thoroughly tested in `interfaces/maxima.py`.

The `__init__` method in `maxima.py` quote the variable `MAXIMA` when building the command for `pexpect`

```
                        command = '"{0}" -p "{1}"'.format(MAXIMA, STARTUP),
```
this leads the whole expression `maxima -l ecl`, with spaces, to be considered a command by pexpect. Removing the double quotes fix the problem and doesn't introduce any issue with more conventional values of `MAXIMA`.

OK, I guess someone would have complained already if putting double quote there broke things.

I'll add that in fact sage-on-broken was potentially broken if you had maxima with sbcl and ecl installed - from the day `interfaces/maxima.py` started to use `MAXIMA`. So those improvements were really needed.

If `maxima` lies in `/path with spaces/`, then
`MAXIMA` could be set to `'"/path with spaces/maxima" -l ecl'` and that would work with the current version on the branch.

Unrelated, but perhaps an improvement:

```diff
- command = '{0} -p "{1}"'.format(MAXIMA, STARTUP)
+ command = '{0} -p {1}'.format(MAXIMA, shlex.quote(STARTUP))
```
