This is a followup to #6100, and was reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/54070/generators-of-simplicial-homology/). If `K` is a simplicial complex, the `generators` argument to `K.homology(...)` does nothing: `K.homology(...)` calls the `homology` method for generic cell complexes, which in turn calls `_homology_` for simplicial complexes, and that method ignores the `generators` keyword.

There is an easy solution: in the generic `homology` method, if `generators` is True, then don't call `_homology_`, just continue in that method. This will give information about chain complex generators. It is possible, although obscure, to extract the simplicial complex information from that.

A better solution: actually do the obscure work, don't force the users to figure it out. That is:
- call `K.chain_complex(generators=True)`, and
- use `K._n_cells_sorted()` to convert the chain complex generators (which are just vectors in the corresponding free module over the base ring) to actual chains in the simplicial complex.

Before this branch:

```
sage: simplicial_complexes.Sphere(2).homology(generators=True)

sage: cubical_complexes.Sphere(2).homology(generators=True)                                                        
{0: [], 1: [], 2: [(Z, Chain(2:(1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1)))]}
sage: simplicial_sets.Sphere(2).homology(generators=True)                                 
{0: [], 1: 0, 2: [(Z, Chain(2:(1)))]}
```

Note that no generators are given at all in the simplicial complex case. In the other cases, the answers are given in terms of the chain groups.

After:

```
sage: simplicial_complexes.Sphere(2).homology(generators=True)                            
{0: [], 1: [], 2: [(Z, (0, 1, 2) - (0, 1, 3) + (0, 2, 3) - (1, 2, 3))]}
