You don't have to install pyright manually for use in vscode, its done via the pylance extension (providing such a seamless integration with vs code was one of the reasons why pyright is written in ts).

<a id='comment:30'></a>Thanks for the update.

With the current config, `tox -e pyright` still uses the `venv` symlink to resolve imports etc. Wouldn't it be more in the spirit of tox to install sagelib in the tox env and use that as a reference for imports? 

For example, without a properly setup `venv`, `tox -e pyright` for example complains

```
  /workspace/sagetrac-mirror/src/sage/manifolds/subsets/pullback.py:302:22 - warning: Import "ppl" could not be resolved (reportMissingImports)
  /workspace/sagetrac-mirror/src/sage/manifolds/subsets/pullback.py:827:26 - warning: Import "ppl" could not be resolved (reportMissingImports)
```
These are not displayed if `venv` is setup correctly.

Also, why do you need `SAGE_LOCAL` for pyright/in the tox env?

<a id='comment:32'></a>That config is also highly confusing, and took me quite some time to understand.

`venvPath` is the path where all venv's are supposed to be, and `venv` is then a path relative to this path selecting a certain venv.
So with `venvPath = /home/venvs` and `venv = ./a`, the venv is supposed to be in `/home/venvs/a`.

The code explains this better then the docs:
https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/fa4194fd8b0e6d9fb970468e50a974e0d4eeee5c/packages/pyright-internal/src/analyzer/pythonPathUtils.ts#L72-L73

So I guess you only have to set venvPath in the cli to the tox venv, and everything should work.
