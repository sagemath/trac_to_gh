This helps with the modularization of sagelib.

We demonstrate its use by simplifying:
- `sage.groups.braid` (which depends on the optional library `libbraiding` via `sage.libs.libbraiding`). Actually a standard package
- `sage.sat.solvers.cryptominisat`, `.picosat`
- `sage.matrix.matrix_space` (`meataxe`)
- `sage.graphs.graph` (`tdlib`, `mcqd`)

This simplification helps eliminate the use of `sage.misc.package.PackageNotFoundError`.  See #30607.

Yes, see `build/pkgs/libbraiding/type` which you can either
check with this command:

```
$ cat build/pkgs/libbraiding/type
standard
```
or by viewing that file online:
- https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/pkgs/libbraiding/type

This happened in

- #25705 Make libhomfly and libbraiding standard packages

which was merged in Sage 8.4.beta0.
