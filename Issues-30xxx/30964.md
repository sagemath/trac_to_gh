<a id='comment:3'></a>Below some "since-we-are-editing-these-lines" optional changes.

Clearly out of scope for this reformatting ticket,
so feel free to make them or not.

With all or some or none of these in,
you can set to `positive_review` on my behalf.

Optionally fix these comments:

```diff
-# TODO: This global variable do_preparse should be associated with an
+# TODO: This global variable _do_preparse should be associated with an
 # IPython InteractiveShell as opposed to a global variable in this
 # module.
 _do_preparse = True
```

```diff
-    If the file is not a Cython, Python, or a Sage file, a ``ValueError``
+    If the file is not a Cython, Python, or Sage file, a ``ValueError``
```

```diff
-    # Note: On Python 3 b64encode only accepts bytes, and returns bytes (yet
-    # b64decode does accept str, but always returns bytes)
+    # Note: In Python 3, b64encode only accepts bytes, and returns bytes.
     b64 = base64.b64encode(str_to_bytes(filename, FS_ENCODING,
                                         "surrogateescape"))
     return 'sage.repl.load.load(sage.repl.load.base64.b64decode("{}"),globals(),{})'.format(bytes_to_str(b64, 'ascii'), attach)
```

Optionally split a long line and pep8 its output:

```diff
-    return 'sage.repl.load.load(sage.repl.load.base64.b64decode("{}"),globals(),{})'.format(bytes_to_str(b64, 'ascii'), attach)
+    return ('sage.repl.load.load(sage.repl.load.base64.b64decode'
+            '("{}"), globals(), {})'.format(bytes_to_str(b64, 'ascii'), attach))
```

Optionally shrink two lines into one
(unless it decreases readability):

```diff
-        i = s.find('\n')
-        s = s[i + 1:]
+        s = s[s.find('\n') + 1:]
```

<a id='comment:6'></a>Regarding the two flake8 complaints of patchbots.

One says

```
src/sage/repl/interface_magic.py:127:21 undefined name 'get_ipython'
```
but that seems unrelated to the changes here.

One says

```
src/sage/repl/interpreter.py:788:13 'line_profiler' imported but unused
```
but that is as intended: it is imported
in a try-except-else, only to ascertain
and record whether it is available:

```
        # Load the %lprun extension if available
        try:
            import line_profiler
        except ImportError:
            pass
        else:
            self.extensions.append('line_profiler')
```
