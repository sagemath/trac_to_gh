<a id='comment:40'></a>Sure, but in a modularized setting you probably don't need this check since it's only purpose right now is to make sure that lazy imports are indeed lazy and not already resolved during startup. If that's the case for sage.all, then it's also the case for sub-modules.

In either case, the startup context manager will make it easy to define also other parts as startup in a modularized setting in case this is necessary.

I've now introduced a third "startup state" (Uninitialized) that represents that sage is used without `sage.all` (or before `sage.all` is imported), e.g. in a modularized environment. This makes it possible to fix #32619 in a more ergonomic way.

From my point of view this is ready for review.

I'm not sure, but what output would you expect from

```
with startup_guard.startup():
   print(startup_guard.startup_state)

print(startup_guard.startup_state)

with startup_guard.startup():
   print(startup_guard.startup_state)
```
Since this is now a proper guard, for me "RUNNING, FINISHED, RUNNING" feels correctly.

That feels like an abstract answer (a bit of pun intended). Of course the startup guard signals that sage is starting (or if you want that lazy imports are lazy). So with that, what is the expected behavior of

```
with startup_guard.startup():
   lazy_import(xyz1)

lazy_import(xyz2)

with startup_guard.startup():
   lazy_import(xyz3)
```

I would say only xyz2 should be imported directly, while 1 and 3 are only imported lazily.

As written in the ticket description, the ticket fixes a bug with importing (using importlib) the sage all module.

There is a doctest describing the behavior of two sequential locks, the behavior of nested locks is not further specified as we don't need it yet (but as with this simplest implementation the both locks share the global "lock" variable, the state is in "locked" until the nested lock exits and then switches to "unlocked").

I'm open for suggestions for how to improve the terminology. I thought that "locked" is pretty standard for a "guard", e.g. file locks. "Started"/"Not started" or "Initialized/Not initialized" is confusing with how sequential locks work.

Yes, file locks are locks. They protect against concurrent operations.

The start-up guard has nothing to do with concurrency. It just makes no sense to work with this analogy.

OK, that's not quite where I wanted to take the discussion. 

Let's please ignore the old doctesting-only helper functions - they have no relevance for discussing the semantics. 

In `develop`, `finish_startup` can only be called once, and an error is raised otherwise; and then there is `ensure_startup_finished`, which can be called multiple times and which is a no-op if it was called before.

> [...] I think it may be handy also in the `all` script to have more freedom on how to order/group imports there without being constrained by the lazy import guard.


Yes, I am interested in this -- which is why I brought up the scenarios of sequences of such startup-guarded blocks and also nested startup-guarded blocks in[comment:87](#comment%3A87). 

So with the changes on this ticket, it becomes possible to have a sequence of two startup-guarded blocks:

```
with ...:
    Block 1
with ...:
    Block 2
```
I think we both agree on what the first block should do. Now, why should the second one behave as you implemented?

<a id='comment:117'></a>Replying to [gh-tobiasdiez](#comment%3A116):

Yes, a kind of no-op is what I had in mind.

In the current code, this structure does not appear lexically (and I don't have a use case for it in modularization):

```
with ...:
    Block 1
with ...:
    Block 2
```
However, this sequence will be executed when a user reloads the `sage.all` module using `importlib.reload`.
(Currently this is an error. And of course it is unclear if reloading actually can be made to work properly, given that we have so much complicated global state.)

So in this situation, in the second block, it would makes no sense to do any of the tracking of resolved lazy imports and emitting warnings. The startup was done already.

In this use case the current implementation is almost noop, since now the guard is only checked in the doctests and no warnings are issued.

In my opinion, the submodules shouldn't have their own startup scripts. The all script is one of the things that make sage so hard to use as a library. But if the nested structure does arise in the future, then the implementation of the guard can easily be changed to accommodate of this.

The `all` scripts have two purposes: (1) To orchestrate startup, and I agree with you that the library should be changed to make it unnecessary - that's #33580. (2) To fill the top-level namespace that is available at the `sage:` prompt. And this is not going away.

Well, it will, as I said in[comment:118](#comment%3A118).

> then the implementation of the guard can easily be changed to accommodate of this. 


In your current branch you are introducing a public interface (including new terminology) for the `GuardState`. That's not a good way forward when we already know that it does not capture what is needed.

The test would still only fail if there are already resolved lazy imports in the first load.

Nope. See https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging_sage_library.html#testing-distribution-packages

Not the module, the distribution.

There are two types warnings, right? Let's break the analysis down by type.
