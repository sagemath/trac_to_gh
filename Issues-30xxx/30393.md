Thank you. I'm not setting that ticket as a dependency though, since these methods are experimental anyway.

Few comments:

- `"unable to certify the eigenvalues of this interval matrix"`, I would avoid the usage of the word `interval` which reminds of the `CIF` since the matrix belongs rather to the `CBF`.
- the `other` input should be documented as related to the generalized eigenvalue problem in the input block and/or in the raise `NotImplementedError`.

What should happen when the parent is `RealBallField`?

```
sage: M = matrix(3, [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0])                                                       
sage: MRBF = M.change_ring(RBF)                                                                        
sage: MRBF.eigenvalues() 
KeyError: '_PolynomialRing_singular_repr__singular'
...
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
...
AttributeError: 'PolynomialRing_field_with_category' object has no attribute '_PolynomialRing_singular_repr__singular'
...
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
...
TypeError: no conversion of this ring to a Singular ring defined
...
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
...

```

Can this benefits from your current branch?

In principle yes (and matrices over RR and CC can benefit too), but at the moment we don't even have a dedicated class for matrices over RBF. I think we should keep that for another ticket, and probably wait until the methods are no longer marked experimental.

Thanks.

What we need IMHO is for each method's documentation to include or link to that of the methods it overrides, and to change the way we write docstrings to take advantage of that.

I agree with your point (out of sync). But, I do hate the documentation of `G.plot(**kwds)` which does not say which options are available.

That being said, I think my point in comment 2 was mostly to avoid using the `extend` option as a positional argument like:

```
sage: M = M.change_ring(CBF)
sage: M.eigenvalues(True)
```
since it will not be the 1st argument anymore after #29243. If you can force the `extend` to be a keyword argument like `def eigenvalues(self, *, extend=False)`, then for me it is okay, even without the `other` argument. Do you mind to remove the `other` argument? Sorry for my slow convergence on clarifying my point of view.

> I think we should keep that for another ticket, and probably wait until the methods are no longer marked experimental.


I agree.

While following the examples in the documentation in order to prepare something for the release tours, I noticed that the computed right eigenvectors are wrong. They do not satisfy the eigenvector equation. In fact, it seems to be a problem of transposition. The computed vectors are the rows of the eigenmatrix, but the eigenvectors would be the columns.
