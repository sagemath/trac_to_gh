Belongs to #30189.

I propose to add a new folder for manifold examples:

`src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/examples`

Furthermore, I suggest we move `euclidean.py` and `real_line.py` to that folder and make it, besides the global availability, accessible from the catalog, too. The idea is that any manifold example can be accessed via the catalog, and the corresponding files are stored in the `examples` folder.

For manifolds with non-smooth structure (or non-diffeomorphic structures), we can add such a folder in `manifolds`, too. But I don't see the need yet.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

There are now two way that I see (not related to this ticket directly):

1) The methods in `catalog.py` operate as a factory method for each model.

2) Each model manages its own factory in its corresponding file (as in `EuclideanSpace` right now).

Namely, some dimensions have peculiarities that we may want to consider (e.g. S<sup>3</sup> is parallelizable).

Thanks for this ticket. A folder dedicated to standard manifolds sounds like a good idea. Regarding the name, I would lean to `catalog` as suggested in [comment:9](#comment:9), with an import statement of the form

```
from sage.manifolds.catalog import Torus   
```
instead of 

```
from sage.manifolds.differentiable.catalog import Torus   
```
which looks unnecessarily longer and probably more difficult to find via introspection. 

Apparently, there is no `catalog` folder in all `src/sage`, only `catalog.py` files. I don't know if there is any reason for this...

Btw, in addition to that, the examples can currently be invoked by

```
manifolds.Torus()
```

This comes from the fact that `all.py` imports

```
import sage.manifolds.catalog as manifolds
```

I think this is very nice, too.

The import pattern is currently

```
S2 = manifolds.Sphere(2)
```

and

```
from sage.manifolds.catalog import Sphere

S2 = Sphere(2)
```

I think this is what we should promote. As Eric pointed out in [comment:10](#comment:10),

```
from sage.manifolds.differentiable.catalog...
```

is something that should not be promoted, and I agree with him.

However, even if the import pattern is the same, the suggested folder structure is nice because it indicates what examples are differentiable manifolds and what not.

I would solve this using the façade pattern. So, if dimension 2 would be special for the sphere, you have a class `Sphere` for every dimension that delegates its work to `Sphere2Dim` and `SphereHigherDim` where the actual implementation is taking place.

You got a point. The most simple examples, Euclidean space and open intervals, are already complex enough to occupy whole files. On the other hand, some examples might stay primitive and are too short to occupy an own file.

OK, to be consistent with the rest of Sage code, it's probably wise to keep the `catalog.py` file and rename the folder(s) by something else than `catalog`.

Yes factory approach might be better in this respect. It avoids to invoke  `__classcall_private__`, as currently done in `EuclideanSpace`.

Allow me to summarize the accumulated discussion. Unfortunately, we can't start polls here (a feature I completely miss).

- For consistency, to keep the documentation, and to obtain a more comprehensible factory pattern, it is better to keep the `catalog.py`.
- In conclusion, we have to choose another name for the folders. Possible suggestions:
  1. `models`
  2. `examples`
  3. `realizations`
- Which pattern?
  1. Special dimensions of the same implementation could be treated via facade pattern as it has been done for `EuclideanSpace`, whereas more deviating realizations could be treated via factory method pattern in `catalog.py`.
  2. Everything is regulated via facade.
  3. Everything is regulated via factory method in `catalog.py`.

---

With respect to the last point, I suggest that *every* cataloged manifold should have it's own method in `catalog.py` for documentation and unification reasons. This also avoids duplicated or circular imports.

---

Please let me know if I caught something wrong.

Ok, I'm convinced: +1 for `examples`. I would also tend to put every example in its own file. It's more consistent and I don't see any disadvantages of having "small" classes. 

For the pattern, it probably depends on the concrete example and how much the implementations differ. In general, the factory pattern is good when you have completely independent implementations of some interface (e.g. getting infos from a file vs from an web api) whereas the façade pattern excels at hiding the implementation details. You can also combine them easily.
For example, for the sphere one could imagine the following:
- A general class `Sphere` that acts as a façade for `Sphere2Dim` and `SphereHigherDim` (e.g. because you might have more effective ways to calculate in 2d).
- Classes for `d=1,3,7` deriving from `Sphere` and adding the parallelizable aspect.
- Factory method in `catalog.py` that based on the dimension invokes the constructor of `Sphere` or one of its subclasses for `d=1,3,7`

To elaborate: each manifold constructed from the global namespace, i.e. via the factory method, obtains a unique tag. That means, each invokation constructs a new object.

For consistency, this should hold for `OpenInterval` and `RealLine`, too. And for more consistency, it is good to manage this behavior via factory methods.

No, `OpenInterval` and `RealLine` are truely `UniqueRepresentation` objects. The unique tag trick shall not apply to them.

Anyway, the unique tag issue is beyond the scope of this ticket, I believe. 
At some point, we should get rid of `UniqueRepresentation` inheritance for generic manifolds. It is a workaround to have a correct pickling, which is necessary for parallelized computations.

What is the intention behind it?

`RealLine()` or `OpenInterval(0,1)` fully defines the mathematical object, `Manifold(2, 'M')` does not.

Mh, I see. And `EuclideanSpace(2)` could still yield two different but isomorphic mathematical entities.

But what about `OpenInterval(0,1)` and `OpenInterval(0,1, name='I')`. Or `OpenInterval(-oo,oo)` and `RealLine()`. Same mathematical object, but different instances.

I think, this should be catched via `__classcall_private__` then. However, that's definitely beyond the scope of this ticket.

Like Eric pointed out correctly, some things discussed here go beyond the scope of this ticket. I reverted the branch to an older version, where I used lazy imports into `catalog.py`.

Lazy import should prevent circular and unneccessary imports.
