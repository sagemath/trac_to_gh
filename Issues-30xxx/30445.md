We merge some duplications of obtaining edges, ridges and f-vector.

There was an entire copy of getting edges/ridges that also obtained the f-vector. But it is much simpler doing this directly in the f-vector code.

Also getting the edges/ridges is almost the same thing. We can let the `FaceIterator` worry about the details.

Depends on #30443
