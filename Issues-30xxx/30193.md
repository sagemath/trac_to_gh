(`COMEFROM` #30170 #30092)

We add the following axioms, and corresponding mixin categories providing `_test_...` methods, for use with maps:

- `subadditive`, `additive`, `superadditive`
- `submultiplicative`, `multiplicative`, `supermultiplicative`
- `homogeneous`, `positive_homogeneous`
- `contractive`, `metric`, `lipschitz`
- `convex`, `concave`
