Leap does not receive new packages until the next release (15.3 / somewhere in 2021).

>pari is missing some of its database packages


Like, which ones? From the name alone, shipping seadata-small seems unnecessary when seadata is present.

>"notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages: [...] cmake [...]"


Gotta wonder how it can miss these. How does one debug that? docker being docker, the state is gone after tox is aborted.

Somehow, cmake is not even listed, tho:

by the way, on tumbleweed I still get a request to install

```
cddlib-tools "pkgconfig(cddlib)" coxeter edge-addition-planarity-suite sympow
```
even though they are installed. 

In fact, `sympow` is buggy - the 1st test from spkg-configure fails.

`cddlib` is not picked up as `cdd.h` is expected in `/usr/include`, but is installed in `/usr/include/cddlib`.

`coxeter` has as upstream an old https://github.com/tscrim/coxeter - and does not install headers, oops...

And `edge-addition-planarity-suite-devel` is missing, and `edge-addition-planarity-suite` does not install headers.

The latter should be fixed.

This is how cddlib 0.94l installs itself. Since cddlib.pc does not specify any `-I` other than the default `-I${includedir}`, the developers mean that cdd.h is now to be included through a `#include <cddlib/cdd.h>` line, rather than { `#include <cdd.h>` plus some forced -I injection in the project making use of cdd}.

Surely this is an upstream problem, is it not?

let's open another ticket to fix lcalc on gcc-10.
Basically, the problem is that the function
`template <class ttype> Complex L_function <ttype>::value_via_gamma_sum(..)`
does a bunch of conditional returns, but there is no "final" `else`, so compiler
is right to be unhappy.
