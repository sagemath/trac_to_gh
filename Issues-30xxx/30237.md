This patch fixes all of the following, which currently throw errors:

```python
W = CoxeterGroup(['B', 3], implementation='coxeter3')
W.coxeter_type()
# AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense' object has no attribute 'coxeter_type'
W([1,2,1]).reduced_words()
# IndexError: matrix index out of range
R.<v> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
IwahoriHeckeAlgebra(W, v, -1/v)
# AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense' object has no attribute 'coxeter_type'
```

The underlying problem in all cases is that `W.coxeter_matrix()` does not return a `CoxeterMatrix`; I've altered this to return the (correctly indexed) coxeter matrix and added a test.

This also removes a completely unused function `CoxeterGroup.m(i, j)` which seemingly existed only to workaround the fact that `.coxeter_matrix()` was incorrectly indexed (and in fact is ill-founded, it would cause an error on a group with affine Cartan type). This removal breaks no tests in `libs/coxeter3`.

Keywords: **CoxeterGroup, CoxeterMatrix, coxeter, coxeter3**

The `m()` method might not be used in the code, but some user might be using it in their personal code. You should issue a deprecation instead with the appropriate redirect:

```python
from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
deprecation(30237, "the .m(i, j) method has been deprecated; instead use .coxeter_matrix()[i,j]")
```
or whatever message is appropriate.

Other than that, LGTM.
