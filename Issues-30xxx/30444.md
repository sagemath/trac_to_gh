```
In the documentation of a sage file, writing

```
see `this page <http://www.example1.com>`_
or `this page <http://www.example2.com>`_
```

creates an error while building the documentation saying `WARNING: Duplicate explicit target name: "this page"`.

One solution is to use anonymous hyperlinks with double underscores as in:

```
see `this page <http://www.example1.com>`__
or `this page <http://www.example2.com>`__
```

See: [Restructured text (rst) http links underscore ('__' vs '_' use)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27420317/) on stackoverflow. 

This ticket aims to add documentation about that solution in the [section on Hyperlinks](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/sage_manuals.html#chapter-sage-manuals-links) of the sage manual.

The issue was raised in #30393, in particular see [comment:22](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30393#comment:22).

```
If you want a specific link name, use ```link name <http://www.example.com>`__`` (with two underscores at the end)
```
but I'm okay with your version too.

Also, I'm not sure how idiomatic “creates an error” is, but your English is likely better than mine!
