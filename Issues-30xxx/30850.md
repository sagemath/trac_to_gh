The `__future__` import statements were part of the Python2-to-Python3 migration scaffolding. Since it is unlikely we will move back to supporting Python 2, we should remove those.

This ticket only deals with files within `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage`.

Description of commits:
- the first commit is a raw removal of the `__future__` import statements
- the second commit removes the `del absolute_import,...` statements that were here to avoid those to appear in the tab completion
- the third commit fixes a doctest
- the fourth commit removes the automatic addition of `__future__` complieflags from the doctest framework

After applying the branch, you might have to rebuild `psutil` and `sympy`.
