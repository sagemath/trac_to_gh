The `__future__` import statements were part of the Python2-to-Python3 migration scaffolding. Since it is unlikely we will move back to supporting Python 2, we should remove those.

This ticket only deals with files within `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage`.

Description of commits:
- the first commit is a raw removal of the `__future__` import statements
- the second commit removes the `del absolute_import,...` statements that were here to avoid those to appear in the tab completion
- the third commit fixes a doctest
- the fourth commit removes the automatic addition of `__future__` complieflags from the doctest framework

After applying the branch, you might have to rebuild `psutil` and `sympy`.

 The `__future__` import statements were part of the Python2-to-Python3 migration scaffolding. Since it is unlikely we will move back to supporting Python 2, we should remove those.
 
-In order not to interfere with #30627, the `__future__` import statements of `SAGE_ROOT/build/` are not removed.
+This ticket only deals with files within `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage`.
 
 Description of commits:
 - the first commit is a raw removal of the `__future__` import statements
 - the second commit removes the `del absolute_import,...` statements that were here to avoid those to appear in the tab completion
-- the third commit is about preparsing (reverts #27719)
-- the fourth commit fixes a doctest
+- the third commit fixes a doctest
+- the fourth commit removes the automatic addition of `__future__` complieflags from the doctest framework
 
 After applying the branch, you might have to rebuild `psutil` and `sympy`.
 
-Reviewers have to run the doctests by themselves since the patchbot will not.
