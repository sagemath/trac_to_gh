Follow-up from #30106, where the following was observed:

```
sage: var('ξ')._maxima_()
....: 
<repr(<sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.MaximaLibElement at 0x32c1d4828>) failed: RuntimeError: ECL says: Cannot coerce string $_SAGE_VAR_ξ to a base-string>
```
The above error is due to a bug in ECL 16.1.2 and 20.4.24:

```
> (princ-to-string 'ξ)
"Ξ"
> (setf local-table (copy-readtable nil))
> (setf (readtable-case local-table) :invert)
:INVERT
> (let ((*readtable* local-table) (*print-case* :upcase)) (princ-to-string 'ξ))
Cannot coerce string Ξ to a base-string
```
The above code is from Maxima's `PRINT-INVERT-CASE` function in commac.lisp.

<a id='comment:9'></a>This is great. As far as I can tell, this works correctly now. We should add a doctest, but otherwise this looks good to me.

Somewhat surprisingly, this also seems to fix the conversion to Giac:

```
sage: var('α')._giac_()
N1     # before
α      # after
```
but there is another issue with the Giac interface, for which I have opened #30133.
