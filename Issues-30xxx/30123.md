```
As a follow-up to #30972, we provide a pip-installable package (nbextension) that makes (all supported versions of) the `threejs-sage` offline script available to a Jupyter notebook:

- https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-threejs-sage/#description
- https://github.com/sagemath/threejs-sage/pull/1

This allows users to set up a system Jupyter notebook in which Sage is fully functional (including offline 3d graphics), without having to manually create symlinks from a Sage installation to the system's nbextensions directory.

My guess is that the new install script `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install` poisons environment variables too aggressively. 

The code that installs the Jupyter kernel has moved recently to `src/sage_setup/command/sage_install.py`.

This should be investigated by someone who knows about the notebook.

According to [Dima Pasechnik](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/YbmWbOStP_4/osMbpWxPBwAJ), this can be fixed by `sage -b`

Indeed...

That is neverthelass a bug that should be fixed.

As of Sage 9.2.beta7 (which includes #30153), `sage -b` does no longer work to fix the Jupyter issue.

FWIW, here is the content of `SAGE_ROOT/local/share/jupyter/nbextensions` with Sage 9.2.beta7:

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 eric eric   19 août   3 15:12 jsmol -> /doesnotexist/jsmol
drwxr-xr-x 2 eric eric 4096 mai   30 17:52 jupyter-js-widgets

lrwxrwxrwx 1 eric eric   21 août   3 15:12 threejs -> /doesnotexist/threejs
```
The `doesnotexist` directory does not look good...
Changing manually the symbolic links to

```

lrwxrwxrwx 1 eric eric   48 août   3 17:40 threejs -> /home/eric/sage/9.2.develop/local/share/threejs/
```
fixes the Jupyter notebook issue reported in this ticket.

Thanks for investigating this. 

This is, as I thought, due to the poisoning of environment variables in the script `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install`.

The links that created here seem to assume that `jsmol`, `mathjax`, and `threejs` are installed in `SAGE_LOCAL`. 

The correct fix is to create `spkg-configure.m4` scripts for these packages so that equivalent system packages can be used -- and to use specific directory variables for determining the targets for these symlinks.

The mangling happens during install, not during testing.

If you look at the upgrade tickets, like #29809, I always attach a zip file containing a small portion of the full library. I've been doing that since I started the viewer, at first just to avoid downloading the full library. There is however a change coming in the new year, in which one of the two critical files we use will officially be removed from the library. That will necessitate either continuing the current process or modifying a local copy of the full library, a process over which we would not be guaranteed control.

Volker has been moving my zip files to the mirrors manually. Do you know if that is also the process for libraries with upstream links?

Thanks. I am looking at `build/pkgs/threejs`. Is the `spkg-src` script current? Is this what you actually use to generate archives?

You can search for  a REVISION string as is done [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py#L750). This code was written to ditch `installed_packages` to help package managers.

Thanks. So this looks at a local installation (located via the `THREEJS_DIR` variable)
and then picks specific versions of remote URLs.

When you make updates, do you make simultaneous changes to both sagelib and to the threejs spkg?

The `spkg-configure` mechanism of the Sage distribution inspects installed system packages.  We either test for particular features of a library/program, or for a range of versions.

In many ways `jupyter nbextension` is for personal install - which I guess is OK for vanilla sage. But I don't really know if it is designed well enough to be handled properly by a bona fide package management system.

The only real example I have on top of my head is `widgetsnbextension` and it uses regular distutils to install the extension.

OK. To summarize, `THREEJS_DIR` is used at least twice:
(1) during installation of sagelib, to determine symlinks that will be placed in the `nbextensions` folder.
(2) during runtime of sagelib, to determine the threejs version to get certain remote URLs right.
Do both of them have to point to the same installation (same version) for things to work, or are they two separate, independent uses?

 
Also, suppose we develop a way so that users can install sagelib using `pip`, instead of going through the sage distribution. Would it make sense to provide a copy of whatever parts of threejs that sagelib needs as a pip-installable Python package?
Is https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs of any relevance in this direction?

Since there is only one Three.js template, they must both point to the same version.

pythreejs is just a port of Three.js to python, so not relevant: one needs to get the actual JavaScript files. I don't know much about pip, but if you just mean taking my small portion of the Three.js library and delivering it some way other than through Sage, then that is certainly possible.

In Gentoo I disable `instance._symlink_resources()` in the `update` method (this is all in `sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py` so it is not run. I do these manually from the ebuild.  

This bit only creates links to three things, two icons and the documentation. I mainly do them manually because I want relative links instead of absolute links and it is quite possible that at the time it is normally executed things would end up pointing to the wrong places - which would be the real killer out of the two.

It is quite an achievement that we have come down to these three little things, it used to be much more complex.

Yes, that's what I mean. Basically making it available on https://pypi.org/ so that users can install it with `pip`. (The Sage distribution would still ship a copy of it.)

https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Distributing%20Jupyter%20Extensions%20as%20Python%20Packages.html

I'll be happy to help with the packaging.


This would be a good step in the direction of plugging Sage (which is installed into its own venv) into a system Jupyter installation.

Fortunately we can use a Jupyter notebook option to serve /static from arbitrary directory that contains jsmol, threejs, and mathjax:

`c.NotebookApp.extra_static_paths = ["/path/to/extra/static/files"]`

I guess that with some changes mainly replacing "/nbextensions" to "/static",  sage 3d and interact outputs all would work fine.

Can't quite believe how that little bit just destroy the ebuild file format. Just 'b' would pass, but 'b1' with a meaning of 'beta 1', I technically should transform that into `_beta1` and then retransform it inside the ebuild. If it is standard python versioning someone needs to do something Gentoo side to allow those names (other than argue that they are wrong or stupid).

As it turns out, it is very relevant; and it would probably be best to redo the Python packaging (`jupyter-threejs-sage`) as a fork of `pythreejs`. They already have support for JupyterLab 3
