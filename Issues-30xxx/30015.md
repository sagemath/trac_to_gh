The documentation string of `.schlegel_projection` reads:

```
   Return the Schlegel projection.

   * The polyhedron is translated such that its "center()" is at the
     origin.

   * The vertices are then normalized to the unit sphere

   * The normalized points are stereographically projected from a
     point slightly outside of the sphere.
```

When normalizing to the unit sphere this (potentially) completely breaks the convexity of the object. 

Minimal example:

```
sage: fcube = polytopes.hypercube(4)
sage: tfcube = fcube.face_truncation(fcube.faces(0)[0])
sage: sp = tfcube.schlegel_projection()
sage: sp.plot()
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object
```

The pentagons are not planar although they should in a schlegel diagram.

The scaling to the unit sphere should be removed to preserve convexity.

This ticket fixes the projection while de-duplicating some code.

FOLLOW-UP: Fix .plot() and .show() to have a better behaviour of smaller dimensional objects.

No, that one had to do with plotting in 3d and having missing faces or so. This one is really different: it was providing a wrong output.

Further, the method is improved and made more user-friendly, one just needs to be fed a facet and a positive number to get a schlegel diagram. Close to 0, the projection point is very close to the barycenter of the facet, otherwise, getting away in the direction of the representative point of the locus of points that see that facet.

Given these 2 things, this provides a projection of the polyhedron (think typically of something in 4d) into the affine hull of the facet, and that image is then transformed orthonormally into 3d and then the picture is drawn.

That line is an overkill... I should probably change it to something a bit simpler than taking the intersection.

The problem occurs prior to this, this is an artefact from the older version, somehow it is already converted to RDF before and then no intersection is found.

This example is likely to be one the extreme side, but it is good to fix this now.

In Ziegler's book (Lectures on Polytopes) page 133, there is a nice formula for computing the intersection point.

Thanks for the pointer, that will do. There is still the issue that at that moment, one deals already with `RDF`, but having a direct formula should improve it. (There is still the danger of dividing by 0...)

- The biggest trouble with schlegel is that the default position now seems to be much too close !(?)

  Take a look at at

  `polytopes.six_hundred_cell().plot()` etc.

  The default position that works good for stacking, seems to be too close for schlegel projection.

- Even worse: `polytopes.permutahedron(4).show()` isn't orthonormally projected anymore.

Defaulting behavior will never be perfect.

It was a mere coincidence that it was orthonormally projected by the method show (!).
This indicates that if one has a lower dimensional object (<=3) in an ambient dimension which is strictly larger than 3, one would prefer to visualize (by default) the object in its affine hull, and that, orthonormally projected. This is what you mean?

In this case, this is a different ticket fixing the `.show()/.plot()` methods. This ticket fixes the schlegel projection which it does...

Thank you for exposing the `position` argument.

Of course default behavior will never be perfect, but it is stupid to be stuck with an awful default and don't know how to change it.

If I'm now unhappy with the default, I can inspect the `plot` method to find the option I need.

`polytopes.permutehdron(4).show()` was orthonormally projected because the default for ambient dimension `4` is (previous to this ticket) schlegel projection. So it was orthonormal for the wrong reasons. Nevertheless, it worked.

How about adding

But you have introduced a change in this ticket, this is why I propose to "fix" it here. At least some temporary solution we can live with.

The default plotting method before this ticket for `polytopes.permutahedron(4)` was schlegel projection. You changed this to just projection.

Ok sure.

But again: it was not doing an orthonormal projection, otherwise the minimal non-working example in the ticket description would not occur. It was a mere accident because the permutahedron realization given there is inscribed.

The above addition looks good to me. I would even prioritize it over `polyhedron.dimension() == 4`, because... I guess that whenever you have an object that is at most dimension 3, you would like to see "it" exactly how it is, and I actually would give an option to turn off the orthonormal if the user wants to.
Then, if the object has dimension 4, it will do the schlegel projection (without respect at all to the ambient dimension, which make more sense to me).

I'll have another round of look at it.

It should be all fixed now. I changed the default behavior for when the locus polyhedron is compact, to take the midpoint of the line segment. The rest is unchanged. Further, I exposed the option to remove orthonormality in the plotting...

Have a look at:

```
sage: p = polytopes.six_hundred_cell()

```

```diff

I propose the following doctest to show that this has been fixed::

```
sage: fcube = polytopes.hypercube(4)                                                                                                                                                
sage: tfcube = fcube.face_truncation(fcube.faces(0)[0])                                                                                                                             
sage: sp = tfcube.schlegel_projection()                                                                                                                                             
sage: for face in tfcube.faces(2): 
....:     vertices = face.ambient_Vrepresentation() 
....:     indices = [sp.coord_index_of(vector(x)) for x in vertices] 
....:     projected_vertices = [sp.transformed_coords[i] for i in indices] 
....:     assert Polyhedron(projected_vertices).dim() == 2 
```

This line here is hard to read due to the underscore. I would exchange it for something else:

```
ineq = [_ for _ in facet.ambient_Hrepresentation() if _.is_inequality()][0]
```

```diff
+        A, b = self.facet.as_polyhedron().affine_hull_projection(as_affine_map=True, orthonormal=True,extend=True)
-        A,b = self.facet.as_polyhedron().affine_hull_projection(as_affine_map=True, orthonormal=True, extend=True)
```

```diff
-        self.projection_point = vector(RDF,projection_point)

There isn't really any good choice of parameters to get "a nice picture" of the cyclic polytope on the moment curve.

A better choice would be to essentially add the cyclic polytope construction on the trigonometric curve so that the coordinates all have the same "scale". ... another nice thing that would be easy to implement and that's not too hard.
