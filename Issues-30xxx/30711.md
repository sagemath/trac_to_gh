In this list, `cmake`, `r`, `python3` all depend on `liblzma`. 
The others are merely build-time dependencies on the `xz` binary (for unpacking the tarball in `sage_bootstrap.uncompress.tar_file` - when `sage-bootstrap-python` is < 3.3 - see https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html) and have nothing to do with the shared library.

The new `liblzma` package is a script package without installation steps; it delegates the actual installation to the `xz` spkg. This follows the same approach as the `libnauty`/`nauty` packages.

If `r` is coming from the system or `--disable-r` (#31409) is used, then we can drop the SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK for `xz` in `python3/spkg-configure.m4`
because then there is no package depending on `liblzma` that will run in the same process as `python3`.
(`cmake` depends on `liblzma` but it does not run in the same process.)
