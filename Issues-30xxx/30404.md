Currently, the linters (pycodestyle, pyflakes, ...) run as plugins of patchbot. This has a few disadvantages: a) the lint results depend on the version of the tools installed by the owner of the patchbot b) it takes quite some time until the results are available and c) you need people to run the patchbot.

This ticket adds pyright, relint and pycodestyle checks as Github actions. They run really fast (about 2min), have reliable results as the version of the linters can be controlled and uses Github server instead of people's machines.

Although only those rules are activated that are also run by the patchbot, the pycodestyle and relint checks currently fail with a lot of errors. See https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/actions/runs/352364668. Thus, making these tests pass requires more work by the sage community.

What is left to do is to add the integration of the github action output to trac - #30877

Giving something similar to

![](https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/workflows/Lint/badge.svg?branch=patch-2&event=push)

with a link to https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/actions?query=workflow%3ALint+branch%3Apatch-2
(its sadly not possible to directly link to the workflow output)

This leaves the following todo list:
- Restrict current github actions to master and develop branch
- Activate gitub actions in sagetrac-mirror
- Add the link to the badge to trac

I can do the first task. Could somebody else then do point 2 and 3?

I've now changed the workflow to use tox, which is enabled by #30408. Moreover, I realized based on the above comment by mkoeppe that the other Github actions are already restricted to only run on pushes with tags.

> They are configured to run on every push to a tag and on every pull request. That's I think also the right granularity for the new workflow


I think the lint workflow should run on every push and pull request. In this way, the developer gets immediate feedback, and this is similar to the patchbot that also runs on every "push".
Moreover, they run very quickly so there is no problem in running them on every push.

So this leaves the following todo's.
- Peer-review this ticket
- Activate gitub actions in sagetrac-mirror
- Merge the dependencies #30408, #30361
- Double check that the workflow runs successful on sagetrac-mirror
- Merge
- Add the link to the badge to trac as described above

Afterwards, the workflow can be extended to include further linters. It might also be good to later add a basic build & doctest workflow that runs on every push.

Yes, but even with the configuration files added the github workflow fails as there is no typing information yet(and the one added in #29775 is not complete) and pycodestyle reports over 600 errors as well.

Fixing these points requires more effort from the whole sage community.

The aim of this ticket is to add the github actions so that one has a consistent check, which at some point in the future hopefully turns green.
