Replaces sage's custom autodoc extension by the built-in one. The motivation is to add support for typing information in the documentation in #30894.

The following customizations need to be removed for this:

- providing argspecs for decorators (sage_wraps): #30884
- using argspecs instead of signature 
- dealing with cached function(methods) callers
- dealing with nested classes
- dealing with classcall metaclass
- dealing with class aliases
- skipping lazy imports to avoid deprecation warnings








Depends on #30884

Building the docs fails immediately for me, because text roles like `:arxiv:`, `:trac:`, etc. are no longer defined.

I think it would be better, at least as a first step, to update `sage_autodoc` to incorporate the recent changes in Sphinx's `autodoc`.

 Replaces sage's custom autodoc extension by the built-in one. The motivation is to add support for typing information in the documentation in #30894.

-Please let me know if there are other customization in the sage autodoc file except for the `sage_wraps` decorator support. 
+The following customizations need to be removed for this:
+- skipping lazy imports to avoid deprecation warnings
+- providing argspecs for decorators (sage_wraps): #30884
+- dealing with nested classes
+- dealing with cached function(methods) callers
+- dealing with classcall metaclass
+- dealing with class aliases
