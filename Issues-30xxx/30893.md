Replaces sage's custom autodoc extension by the built-in one. The motivation is to add support for typing information in the documentation in #30894.

The following customizations need to be removed for this:

- providing argspecs for decorators (sage_wraps): #30884
- using argspecs instead of signature 
- dealing with cached function(methods) callers
- dealing with nested classes
- dealing with classcall metaclass
- dealing with class aliases
- skipping lazy imports to avoid deprecation warnings

Building the docs fails immediately for me, because text roles like `:arxiv:`, `:trac:`, etc. are no longer defined.

I think it would be better, at least as a first step, to update `sage_autodoc` to incorporate the recent changes in Sphinx's `autodoc`.

My understanding is that one of the main reasons for using our own version of `autodoc` is to be able to include Cython files in the documentation, and this requires customization of the introspection code. So that is something you should test when experimenting with this: how is autodoc working on Cython files?

That should be fixed now.

I tried rebasing first, but there were quite a few changes which made it rather difficult. So I thought replacing it completely, and then implement the necessary changes elsewhere would be easier.

I will do so! I just figured out how to convince sage to produce the documentation for something else then the manifold package. After playing around a bit, I realized that there might be quite some changes necessary (e.g. `instancedoc` doesn't play nicely with Python's `inspect`). Will keep you updated.

 Replaces sage's custom autodoc extension by the built-in one. The motivation is to add support for typing information in the documentation in #30894.
 
-For some reason, my local installation only wants to build the documentation for the manifold package. For this, I verified that the newly generated documentation is on par with the old one. This was the case except for parameters added with the ``@`output` decorator. This should be fixed with #30884.
-Please let me know if there are other customization in the sage autodoc file except for the `sage_wraps` decorator support. 
+The following customizations need to be removed for this:
+- skipping lazy imports to avoid deprecation warnings
+- providing argspecs for decorators (sage_wraps): #30884
+- dealing with nested classes
+- dealing with cached function(methods) callers
+- dealing with classcall metaclass
+- dealing with class aliases
+- using argspecs instead of signature
