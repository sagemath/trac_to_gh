<a id='comment:2'></a>Hello,

can you move the file `distance_regular.pyx` to the subdirectory `generators/`. This is certainly a better place for generators.

Also, what's the added value of using python instead of python here ? Do you have any plan for further improvements ? I'm not against python here, I just want to understand the motivation.

The patchbot reports an issue with gap during the construction `G = graphs.graph_3O73()`.

Sure!

> Also, what's the added value of using python instead of python here ? Do you have any plan for further improvements ? 

I'm using Cython mainly to speed things up a bit. I have quite a lot of graphs that will end up here, but I thought that many small tickets are better than a huge one.

Should be fixed now.

(Also rebased branch on 9.2.beta6)

<a id='comment:5'></a>I fully agree that small tickets are better ;)
In the future, i suggest to name branch like `public/graphs/30240` so that I can directly push a review commit for minor corrections.

A few comments:

- ensure that comments are formatted in 80 columns mode. Not sure it is the case now

- typos

```diff
-Dabase of distance regular graphs
+Database of distance regular graphs
```
- several times

```diff
-    This is a distance-regular graph with intersecion array
+    This is a distance-regular graph with intersection array
```

- wha's the reason for choosing 100 ?
- PEP8

```diff
-        for j in range(i+1,100):
+        for j in range(i + 1, 100):
```

```diff
-                sC2 = frozenset(cocliques[j])
-                edges.append( (sC,sC2) )
+                edges.append((sC, rozenset(cocliques[j])))
```

```diff
-    G = Graph(edges,format="list_of_edges")
+    G = Graph(edges, format="list_of_edges")
```

```diff
-    H = libgap.AtlasGroup("3^2.U4(3).D8",libgap.NrMovedPoints,756)
+    H = libgap.AtlasGroup("3^2.U4(3).D8", libgap.NrMovedPoints, 756)
```

```diff
-    G = Graph(libgap.Orbit(N,[1,9],libgap.OnSets), format='list_of_edges')
+    G = Graph(libgap.Orbit(N, [1, 9], libgap.OnSets), format='list_of_edges')
```


- `if x == 0` -> `if not x`
- `x == z2+1` -> `x == z2 + 1`  this is to improve readability (PEP8)
- `#create e_i` -> `# create e_i`   this is to avoid confusion with compilers macros
- `ei = [0]*6` -> `ei = [0] * 6`  or directly `ei = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` ?

- possibly simpler code

```diff
-    def has_edge(u,v):
-        com = 0
-        for i in range(6):
-            com += u[i].conjugate() * v[i]
-
-        if com == 2:
-            return True
-        return False
+    def has_edge(u, v):
+        return sum(u[i].conjugate() * v[i] for i in range(6)) == 2
```

- you could add a loop so set all `K[i]` to immutable first. I think you do that many times.

Unless my editor is wrong, there are only 2 lines that reach (and don't exceed) column 80 (line 40 and 243).

> - wha's the reason for choosing 100 ?
 
There are only 100 cocliques, so to iterate over the list I use `range(100)`.

> - `if x == 0` -> `if not x`
 
Personally I find the rhs more confusing as I read it as `if x is not None` (especially since `x` is not an `int`).
I changed it to `if  x.is_zero()`. If PEP8 or Sage insist with `if not x`, I'll change it right away.

<a id='comment:8'></a>I'm not insisting for the `not x` ;)

may be you can do:

```
cocliques = [frozenset(c) for c in DC.cliques_maximum()]

edges = []
import itertools
for sC, sC2 in itertools.combinations(cocliques, 2):
    if len(sC.intersection(sC2)) == 8:
        edges.append((sC, sC2))
```

similarly

```
-    for i in range(length):
-        for j in range(i + 1, length):
+    for Ki, Kj in itertools.combinations(K, 2):
```

I agree it's minor changes.

<a id='comment:13'></a>The name of the graph function `locally_GQ42_graph()` is not good. There are more locally GQ42 graphs (I even found one myself many years ago, see https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1357771 :-))

Probably `locally_GQ42_distance_transitive_graph()` is better.
(There is also the 3-fold quotient of this graph - but it is strongly regular, so no confusion should arise).

Also the docstring for this graph should be improved; it says

```
 Return the unique amply regular graph which is locally a generalised
 quadrangle.
```
but this is not unique such a graph, as it's 3-fold quotient is also amply regular
(all strongly regular graphs are)

Please also add `REFERENCES:` sectuion to all the graphs in this branch.

I looked closer at what is written in BCN and they say the graph is the unique amply regular graph with `\mu = 6`.
I'm not sure that's true, tough.

I've added them and I think the construction of `locally_GQ42_distance_transitive_graph` is actually due to you as is not the one given in BCN.

yes, that's correct - you do need mu=6, though.
There is a locally GQ(4,2) graph with mu=18 (an s.r.g)
`graphs.strongly_regular_graph(126,45,12,18)`
 
> I'm not sure that's true, tough.

so, add that mu=6 there then.

huh? see [BCN], 13.2.C and p.397 for references. It seems that [688] is the earliest - but why don't you just refer to [BCN], 13.2.C ?

I get the following:

```

```
Maybe we have different versions of GAP installed?

Just to be sure, only the tests for `graph_7073` or does `locally_GQ42_distance_transitive_graph` need it too?

Is there a way to check what optional packages are really needed without having another sage installation?
