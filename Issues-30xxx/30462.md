This ticket proposes introducing a dark theme to the Three.js viewer. The new `theme` viewer option will be used to control whether the original (and default) 'light' theme or the new 'dark' theme is used.

Aside from appeasing users -- myself included -- who generally prefer dark UIs, the main justification for this feature is that JupyterLab, unlike the Jupyter notebook, allows you to use a dark theme for its UI. When using that theme, however, the contrast between the dark UI and the bright background of Three.js plots can be quite harsh.

Keywords: threejs dark theme colors background jupyterlab

I don't quite like the code inside `addLabel` that tests for the color black, since you haven't captured all possible ways to create that color via CSS.

Also, why are the lines for testing viewpoint values highlighted? Can't see any changes...

Although `'black'` is the default in the javascript, I was seeing `'#000000'` coming in from `text3d` when not specifying a color, so that's why that's there. The `'#000'` was a "hey why not?" addition.

I'm not particularly happy with it either in hindsight. I think that if the user explicitly sets the color to black, we should respect that. Same if they set it to white in the normal theme.

Maybe it would make more sense then to default the `text3d` and javascript colors to `None`/`null` and then choose whether to turn that into black/white based on the theme?

I don't think we want to change defaults in the Python code: might affect the current user experience in other viewers. Perhaps we should just check for the defaults we know are being set, 'black' and '!#000000', and let the other formats exist as a way to override this behavior.
