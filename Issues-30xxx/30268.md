This is to modify output of tests in the case where
`SAGE_ROOT` exists and tests are ran from `SAGE_ROOT`.

For example when running `make test` when building
Sage in an extracted source tarball or a git clone.

Before this ticket, failures and timeouts show with `sage -t`:

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/latex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/plot/animate.py  # Timed out
```

After this ticket, failures and timeouts show with `./sage -t`:

```
./sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/misc/latex.py  # 1 doctest failed
./sage -t --random-seed=0 src/sage/plot/animate.py  # Timed out
```

This makes the testing process less error-prone.

Indeed, the natural next action is to run each test
again by itself, typically by copying and pasting the
lines from the above report. A developer might have
several versions of Sage installed, and the `sage`
in their `PATH` might not be the one currently being
tested, so one could easy inadvertently retest with
the wrong Sage and draw wrong conclusions. Since the
paths to tested files in the report are local, the
copy-pasted line must be run from the `SAGE_ROOT`
directory, so using `./sage` is perfectly sensible.

`sage -t` is perfectly normal and natural for sage-on-distros. In fact `./sage` doesn't make any sense there since `SAGE_ROOT` doesn't exist.

If you want to display this, make it dependent on `SAGE_ROOT` not being undefined please.
