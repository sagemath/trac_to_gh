Could you check your sympows as follows:

```
$ sympow -curve [1,-1,0,-79,289] -analrank
$ sympow -curve [0,1,1,-2,0] -analrank
```

I believe the 2nd test, but not the 1st, should crash on your system sympow 1.023.

If so, we can add this test to the one we already do on #30147.

you cannot in general just cut and paste from an m4 file into a shell. m4 files are preprocessed by autoconf, into ./configure (in m4 `[` and `]` have special meanining,
so they have to replaced by `@<:@` and `@:>@`, respectively). In the latter you can see

```
      { $as_echo "$as_me:${as_lineno-$LINENO}: checking whether sympow works well (cf. :trac:30147)" >&5
$as_echo_n "checking whether sympow works well (cf. :trac:30147)... " >&6; }
      sympow_rank_test=`echo "[1,-1,0,-79,289]" | sympow -analrank | grep ^"Analytic Rank is 4"`
      if test x"$sympow_rank_test" = x; then :

          { $as_echo "$as_me:${as_lineno-$LINENO}: result: no; cannot use system sympow" >&5
$as_echo "no; cannot use system sympow" >&6; }
          sage_spkg_install_sympow=yes

```

Could you check the output of this in `config.log`. If the test succeeds, one should get something like

```
configure:32210: checking whether sympow works well (cf. :trac:30147)
configure:32221: result: yes; use system sympow
```
there (line numbers might differ)

oups, ok, I see.

On the machine running Ubuntu 18.04, I did
`make sympow-clean`
to remove the sage spkg I installed earlier. Then, I did `./configure`. Then

```
$ grep sympow config.log
## Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG sympow... ##
configure:32515: checking for sympow
configure:32533: found /usr/bin/sympow

configure:32569: result: yes; use system sympow
configure:32579: will use system package and not install SPKG sympow
configure:38100: result: sympow-2.023.6:                              using system package; SPKG will not be installed
ac_cv_path_SYMPOW=/usr/bin/sympow
    sympow \
    sympow \

deps_sympow = | pari
vers_sympow = 2.023.6

$ /usr/bin/sympow -version
1.023 RELEASE (Debian 1.023-8)
```

so it seems that sympow version 1.023 is passing the test, whereas it should not.

In fact, sympow 1.023 does pass the test written with the "echo" way:

```
$ echo "[1,-1,0,-79,289]" | sympow -analrank

But, it does not work with the following syntax:

configure:32558: checking whether sympow works well (cf. :trac:30147 and :trac:30633)
configure:32565: result: no; cannot use system sympow
configure:32592: no suitable system package found for SPKG sympow
configure:38102: result: sympow-2.023.6:                              no suitable system package; will be installed as an SPKG
configure:39587: notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages: _recommended boost coxeter3 gp2c isl libsemigroups pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata sympow tox
  $ sudo apt-get install texlive-generic-extra texlive-xetex latexmk pandoc dvipng default-jdk ffmpeg libavdevice-dev libboost-dev pari-gp2c libisl-dev sympow
```

(I wonder if the sentence "the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages" should be improved, because it is not clear what is meant by "equivalent". Does it mean that the system `sympow` was not there at all in which case the user will think to install it or that `sympow` from the system was too old and there is nothing to do?)

see #12858, more precisely 
ticket:12858#comment:16
I gather this is Debian "upstream", with this bug still in.
 
I agree that this is an upstream bug, and the problem is to identify the upstream...
