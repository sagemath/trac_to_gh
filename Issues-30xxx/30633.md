That issue was already reported at #25856.

A recent upgrade of sympow was made at #3360.

Could you check your sympows as follows:

```
$ sympow -curve [1,-1,0,-79,289] -analrank
$ sympow -curve [0,1,1,-2,0] -analrank
```

I believe the 2nd test, but not the 1st, should crash on your system sympow 1.023.

If so, we can add this test to the one we already do on #30147.

you cannot in general just cut and paste from an m4 file into a shell. m4 files are preprocessed by autoconf, into ./configure (in m4 `[` and `]` have special meanining,
so they have to replaced by ``@`<:`@`` and ``@`:>`@``, respectively). In the latter you can see

```
      { $as_echo "$as_me:${as_lineno-$LINENO}: checking whether sympow works well (cf. :trac:30147)" >&5
$as_echo_n "checking whether sympow works well (cf. :trac:30147)... " >&6; }
      sympow_rank_test=`echo "[1,-1,0,-79,289]" | sympow -analrank | grep ^"Analytic Rank is 4"`
      if test x"$sympow_rank_test" = x; then :

          { $as_echo "$as_me:${as_lineno-$LINENO}: result: no; cannot use system sympow" >&5
$as_echo "no; cannot use system sympow" >&6; }
          sage_spkg_install_sympow=yes

```

Could you check the output of this in `config.log`. If the test succeeds, one should get something like

```
configure:32210: checking whether sympow works well (cf. :trac:30147)
configure:32221: result: yes; use system sympow
```
there (line numbers might differ)

oups, ok, I see.

On the machine running Ubuntu 18.04, I did
`make sympow-clean`
to remove the sage spkg I installed earlier. Then, I did `./configure`. Then

```
$ grep sympow config.log
## Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG sympow... ##
configure:32515: checking for sympow
configure:32533: found /usr/bin/sympow
configure:32545: result: /usr/bin/sympow
configure:32558: checking whether sympow works well (cf. :trac:30147)
configure:32569: result: yes; use system sympow
configure:32579: will use system package and not install SPKG sympow
configure:38100: result: sympow-2.023.6:                              using system package; SPKG will not be installed
ac_cv_path_SYMPOW=/usr/bin/sympow
    sympow \
    sympow \
    sympow \
    sympow \

deps_sympow = | pari
vers_sympow = 2.023.6

$ /usr/bin/sympow -version
1.023 RELEASE (Debian 1.023-8)
```

so it seems that sympow version 1.023 is passing the test, whereas it should not.

In fact, sympow 1.023 does pass the test written with the "echo" way:

```
$ echo "[1,-1,0,-79,289]" | sympow -analrank

But, it does not work with the following syntax:
