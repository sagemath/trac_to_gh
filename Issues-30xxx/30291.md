```
**Setup:**

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological') # the 2-dimensional sphere S^2
sage: U = M.open_subset('U') # complement of the North pole
sage: c_xy.<x,y> = U.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the North pole
sage: V = M.open_subset('V') # complement of the South pole
sage: c_uv.<u,v> = V.chart() # stereographic coordinates from the South pole
sage: M.declare_union(U,V)   # S^2 is the union of U and V
sage: xy_to_uv = c_xy.transition_map(c_uv, (x/(x^2+y^2), y/(x^2+y^2)),
....:                                intersection_name='W',
....:                                restrictions1= x^2+y^2!=0,
....:                                restrictions2= u^2+v^2!=0)
sage: uv_to_xy = xy_to_uv.inverse()
sage: f = M.scalar_field({c_xy: 1/(1+x^2+y^2), c_uv: (u^2+v^2)/(1+u^2+v^2)},
....:                    name='f')
```


*Current state:*

```
sage: %timeit M.one_scalar_field()*f
10 loops, best of 5: 47.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit f*M.one_scalar_field()
10 loops, best of 5: 48 ms per loop
```

*This ticket:*

```
sage: %timeit M.one_scalar_field()*f
The slowest run took 4.05 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 5: 21.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit f*M.one_scalar_field()
10000 loops, best of 5: 26.5 µs per loop
```

But the generic multiplication seems not affected:

*Current state:*

```
sage: %timeit f*f
10 loops, best of 5: 77.8 ms per loop
```

*This ticket:*

```
sage: %timeit f*f
10 loops, best of 5: 77.4 ms per loop
```

The output is improved, too:

*Current state:*

```
sage: M.one_scalar_field()*M.one_scalar_field()
Scalar field 1*1 on the 2-dimensional topological manifold M
```

*This ticket:*

```
sage: M.one_scalar_field()*M.one_scalar_field()
Scalar field 1 on the 2-dimensional topological manifold M
```
