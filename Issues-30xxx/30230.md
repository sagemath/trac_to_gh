```
We fix a few docstring issues in the file `sage/coding/linear_rank_metric.py`:

- use raw strings where needed: `""" ... """` -> `r""" ... """`
- fix latex typos: `beta` -> `\beta`; `F_q{q^m}` -> `F_{q^m}`
- add missing `::` to introduce example blocks or test blocks
- fix verb forms in docstring first sentence: "Returns" -> "Return"

As reported in [sage-on-gentoo github issue 593](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/593), the lack of raw strings caused errors when building the pdf docs when there were backslashes in LaTeX formulas:

```
! Package inputenc Error: Unicode character ^^H (U+0008)
(inputenc)                not set up for use with LaTeX.

See the inputenc package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Thanks for fixing this. I consider all docstrings should be raw!

While we're at it would you

- add the missing `::` at lines 396, 418, 426, 433, 464, 521
- remove the empty line at line 316

Or you can leave that for a different ticket and set to positive review on my behalf.

There would also be a few docstring first lines to change:
- "Returns" -> "Return"
- "Constructs" -> "Construct"
- "Initializes" -> "Initialize"
- "Tests" -> "Test"
but that's cosmetic and might even more belong to a different ticket.

The happy patchbots still have pyflakes warnings about unused imports,

Well, it created the file as far as I see it. And was included in the latest beta. In other word, We are truly fixing something introduced in the latest beta.

But may there is another ticket addressing some of the points we are looking in this ticket.

You're right. It was closed 3 days ago. I only looked at that. This then explains the pdf docs failing.

what's wrong with unicode beta? They're displayed quite well in 21st century setups.

By the way, did you check that pdf docs build with your changes? I spent some time trying to fix that pdf failing problem without resorting to unicode, gave up and added unicode, which made them work. The reason it ever popped up is that something went wrong in the release process and the commit which fixed that issue didn't make it in.
