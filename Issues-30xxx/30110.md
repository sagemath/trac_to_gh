This looks good to me.

Replying to [@dcoudert](#comment%3A3):
> a `#py2` tag remains in `graph_database.py`. I don't know what to do with this tool anyway since it uses `sagenb`...

Eventually, the `interactive_query` method should be changed to work with Python 3 or it should be removed. Until that is done, I think it is fine to keep the py2 test for clarity.
