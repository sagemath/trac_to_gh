This goal of this ticket is to use `data_structures/biteset.pxi` for the bitset stuff in combinatorial polyhedron and cleanly seperate algorithm and data structure.

This ticket is mostly resolved in smaller tickets:
- #30596: Outsource functions in bitset.pxi that can be optimized by intrinsics 
- #30597: Define a sparse bitset structure 
- #30601: Move bitset.pxi to bitset_base.pxd
- #30598: Define a new data structure for a combinatorial face 
- #30599: Define a new data structure for a list of combinatorial faces   - 

Changes are:

1. Move functions optimizable by intrinsics to a seperate file (`	src/sage/data_structures/bitset_intrinsics.h`). (See #27103 and #27122.)
2. Allow most functions in `bitset.pxi` for fuzed types [fuzed types](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/fusedtypes.html,), such that an (yet to be enriched) bitset data structure specialized for combinatorial faces can use it.
3. Move `bitset.pxi` to `bitset_base.pxd`.
4. Define a data structure `face_s` that gathers properties of a face and corresponding functions.
5. Define a data structure `face_list_s` that gathers properties of a list of faces and corresponding functions.
6. The two flavors of the algorithm (simple and standard) are set up as templates by abusing fuzed types. This makes the code much easier to read. Only the changes will be seperated in the code while the compiler compiles two seperate branches for both flavors.

The features of those changes are mainly:

- Less involved signatures of functions.
- Removing duplications of code.
- New flavors of the algorithm can be implemented without messing up all the files.
- We may enrich `face_s` without changing all our code.
- Intrinsics can easily applied to bitsets in general.

Depends on #30529

It's a patch bomb, I know. If anyone knows a reasonable way around it, I'll do it.

Currently, this is working again and I'm happy. And it's so much easier to do some something from then on.

Most of the changes in the cython files are trivial (took me a while to figure out everything though).

The current branch is a bit of regression with non-simple-non-simplicial polyhedra. It can take much longer. One thing is the unnecessary union of coatoms. Also the branch prediction seems to be bad, because one could know much earlier that the coatom check is useless. I'll think about a solution that works well.

We waste a bit of memory by also allocating enough space for the coatoms in each case, but I wouldn't worry about it for now. In a worst case scenario this needs twice as much memory and much less in many scenarios that have less equal number of vertices/facets. Memory was never an issue for me, it was always time.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

I'm happy with the ticket as it is.

Using templates for the two algorithmic variants, the branch prediction has improved significantly. For extreme cases (see below), things got a bit slower. I don't know why.

In a future ticket one can spare allocating the memory for the coatoms in case we are not using the simple/simplicial algorithm. It doesn't seem to make a difference in runtime.

This is an example of slight slowdown:

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)                                                                                                                                  
sage: Q = P.base_extend(QQ).polar(in_affine_span=True)                                                                                                                
sage: R = P.join(Q)                                                                                                                                                   
sage: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(R)                                                                                                                                  
sage: %time _ = C.f_vector()                                                                                                                                              
CPU times: user 1min 12s, sys: 28.8 ms, total: 1min 12s
Wall time: 1min 12s
```
This is 10 seconds faster on #30040.

I could also play around with constants etc.

This could also all be because the compiler ignores my `inline` instructions in places.

Anyway, I can live with the slight slowdown for now, because the structure is so much better for further improvements.

Any suggestions on how to improve things are welcome.

https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/fusedtypes.html

If this is better, I could move almost everything back to cython again.

The only thing that really needs to be in C/C++ are those 4 functions that I want to optimize with intrinsics later on (there are going to be a few more, but they are all tiny).
To my knowledge you cannot do something like

```
#if __AVX__
def foo(): return 1
#elif __SSE4_1__
def foo(): return 2
#else
def foo(): return 3
#endif
```
in cython.

However I don't know how the performance is, when you include critical `C/C++` function via `cdef extern from` that will be called a huge number of times.

I like it much better now.

Timings with this ticket (branch `u/gh-kliem/use_face_structure`):

(Note that I didn't apply new tricks to the algorithm. Only the data structure has changed.)

```

So I would say that there is no performance-wise reason to reject the changes.

The branch indicates a bit, how this could be split into seperate tickets that are doable to review.
