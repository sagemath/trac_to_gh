Empirically, `maxima_calculus.eval()` is 5-7 times faster than `maxima.eval()`, cf. e.g.

```
sage: timeit("L = [(i/100.0, maxima_calculus.eval('jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)'%i)) for i in range(-300,300)]")
5 loops, best of 3: 110 ms per loop
sage: timeit("L = [(i/100.0, maxima.eval('jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)'%i)) for i in range(-300,300)]")
5 loops, best of 3: 556 ms per loop
```

For some reason, there are dozens of `maxima.eval` calls in sage/[src,doc] - and none of `maxima_calculus.eval`. Just going and changing these will be an improvement (in particular, on Cygwin, where pexpect is very flaky, cf #22191).

`maxima.jacobi_sn()` is also much slower than 
`maxima_calculus.jacobi_sn()`

This should be a part of #17753.

I really want to understand why `maxima_calculus.foo()` is as slow as `maxima.foo()` - this look more like a bug than anything else.

I can't seem to find the code responsible for this, though.

In src/sage/calculus/calculus.py one reads

```rst 
The symbolic calculus package uses its own copy of Maxima for
simplification, etc., which is separate from the default
system-wide version::

    sage: maxima.eval('[x,y]: [1,2]')
    '[1,2]'
    sage: maxima.eval('expand((x+y)^3)')
    '27'

If the copy of maxima used by the symbolic calculus package were
the same as the default one, then the following would return 27,
which would be very confusing indeed!

::

    sage: x, y = var('x,y')
    sage: expand((x+y)^3)
    x^3 + 3*x^2*y + 3*x*y^2 + y^3
```

Is this the only issue (variable binding in SR done via `maxima`, not `maxima_lib`) that
prevents Sage from fully switching to `maxima_lib` backend?
