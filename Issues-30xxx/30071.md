Empirically, `maxima_calculus.eval()` is 5-7 times faster than `maxima.eval()`, cf. e.g.

```
sage: timeit("L = [(i/100.0, maxima_calculus.eval('jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)'%i)) for i in range(-300,300)]")
5 loops, best of 3: 110 ms per loop
sage: timeit("L = [(i/100.0, maxima.eval('jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)'%i)) for i in range(-300,300)]")
5 loops, best of 3: 556 ms per loop
```

For some reason, there are dozens of `maxima.eval` calls in sage/[src,doc] - and none of `maxima_calculus.eval`. Just going and changing these will be an improvement (in particular, on Cygwin, where pexpect is very flaky, cf #22191).

`maxima.jacobi_sn()` is also much slower than 
`maxima_calculus.jacobi_sn()`

This should be a part of #17753.

I really want to understand why `maxima_calculus.foo()` is as slow as `maxima.foo()` - this look more like a bug than anything else.

I can't seem to find the code responsible for this, though.

I think this example is showing that maxima's string parser is faster than our to/from binary data conversion for ecllib. I can believe that: there's still a lot of work and memory allocation to do to translate python objects to lisp objects and back. I can imagine that parsing such a small string is easier (the construction of the lisp float objects etc. needs to happen in both cases, so it's really just parsing against the python object constructions). You could try and profile the code to see if anything bad is happening.

For the results via the expect interface: since the python-to-maxima translation now needs to happen through parsing anyway, it's bound to be slower: there's no upside compared to the "eval" at all. The fact that it actually times out: I'd suspect there's an io buffer that gets flooded or an expect interface that gets out of sync due to the high data flow. Note that the timeout happens in the expect interface.

<div id="comment:7" align="right">comment:7</div>

In src/sage/calculus/calculus.py one reads

```rst 
The symbolic calculus package uses its own copy of Maxima for
simplification, etc., which is separate from the default
system-wide version::

    sage: maxima.eval('[x,y]: [1,2]')
    '[1,2]'
    sage: maxima.eval('expand((x+y)^3)')
    '27'

If the copy of maxima used by the symbolic calculus package were
the same as the default one, then the following would return 27,
which would be very confusing indeed!

::

    sage: x, y = var('x,y')
    sage: expand((x+y)^3)
    x^3 + 3*x^2*y + 3*x*y^2 + y^3
```

Is this the only issue (variable binding in SR done via `maxima`, not `maxima_lib`) that
prevents Sage from fully switching to `maxima_lib` backend?
