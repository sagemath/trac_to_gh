The following produces an AssertionError:

```
sage: R.<T> = QQ[]
sage: K.<zeta> = NumberField(T^2+T+1)
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: v0 = GaussValuation(R, valuations.TrivialValuation(K))
sage: v = v0.augmentation(x^2+x+2, 1)
sage: v.lift(v.reduce(x))
```

The problem only seems to occur for an augmented valuation on a polynomial ring K[x] over a number field. In this case, the residue field often is a relative number field L/K, and for elements of L the method `polynomial()` does not work as expected.

I am not sure what to do about the pyflakes error from the patchbot. This is related to the augmented valuation code.
I don't even understand what 'import 'islice' from line 1803 shadowed by loop variable' means.
