The following produces an AssertionError:

```
sage: R.<T> = QQ[]
sage: K.<zeta> = NumberField(T^2+T+1)
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: v0 = GaussValuation(R, valuations.TrivialValuation(K))
sage: v = v0.augmentation(x^2+x+2, 1)
sage: v.lift(v.reduce(x))
```

The problem only seems to occur for an augmented valuation on a polynomial ring K[x] over a number field. In this case, the residue field often is a relative number field L/K, and for elements of L the method `polynomial()` does not work as expected.

It seems to me that this is caused by a bug in the method `polynomial()` for elements of relative number fields:

```
sage: R.<T> = QQ[]
sage: K.<zeta> = NumberField(T^2+T+1)
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: L.<alpha> = K.extension(x^2+x+2)
sage: alpha.polynomial()
1/2*x^3 + 3*x - 1/2
sage: alpha.polynomial()(L.gen()) == alpha
False
```

The changes made to the doctest are fine.

I am not sure what to do about the pyflakes error from the patchbot. This is related to the augmented valuation code.
I don't even understand what 'import 'islice' from line 1803 shadowed by loop variable' means.
