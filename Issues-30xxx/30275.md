Turns out that an `AssertionError` is inapropriate to raise when immutable elements are tried to be changed (see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AssertionError)):

> exception AssertionError
>    Raised when an assert statement fails.

since no `assert` statements are involved. A better choice would be a `ValueError`.
