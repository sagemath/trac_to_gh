We modify `src/setup.py` to support editable installs via pipenv (`pipenv install -e .`, which invokes `pip install --editable`).  Since distribution continues using build/pkgs/sagelib/src/setup.py, the changes to src/setup.py made in this ticket do not affect the existing build process of the Sage library.

With this ticket, the following code works:

```
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-editable
make build-local
cd src
mkdir .venv
pipenv install --dev --ignore-pipfile
pipenv run pip install -e . --upgrade --exists-action=i --no-build-isolation
pipenv run sage-runtests --all
```
Instead of the first three commands, one can of course also use `tox -e local-sudo-standard build-local`.
It generates a virtual env in `src/.venv` that contains all necessary Python packages, and an editable install of sage.
Moreover, the installation of some packages might fail (depending on your system configuration). In this case one can manually build it using sage and then install the sage-built wheel in the pipenv. For example,

```
make fpylll
cd src && pipenv run pip install <sage>/local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.8/var/lib/sage/wheels/fpylll-0.5.6-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
```


The output of the added GH workflow is available here: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+%26+Test+using+pipenv%22+branch%3Apublic%2Fbuild%2Finplace
Most tests are working, but a few are failing. Only a few tests are failing:

```
sage -t --random-seed=0 sage/misc/sagedoc.py  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 sage/docs/conf.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 sage/cpython/dict_del_by_value.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --random-seed=0 sage/tests/cmdline.py  # 8 doctests failed
```

TODO (as followup tickets):
- Expand on the added documentation on how to set up the virtual environment, using either plain `python -m venv`, `virtualenv` (20.x), or `pipenv`. This is #31342.
- Consider not commit pipfile.lock but instead generate it as build artifact on ci (so that build errors can be easily reproduced by downloading the lock file, and re-creating the exact venv locally): https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1911#issuecomment-378989597. However, normally you want to put the lock file under version control for the reasons described in https://trac.sagemath.org/timeline?from=2021-02-03T13%3A15%3A22Z. The official statement is "always include in version control", see https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/598.
- Replace manual definition of build variables (PKG_CONFIG_PATH, LIBRARY_PATH etc) by `sage-env`.
- Fix failing doctests.

I've worked a bit on it. The current commit is a semi-working prototype, in the sense that all cython files are successfully compiled to C files if invoked via `python src/setup.py build_ext --inplace`. The second compilation of the c files does not yet work.

I had problems that none of the source cython files were correctly found on my system (wsl) and that a few dependencies in the current build files were not met (`'linbox', 'Singular', 'm4ri', 'zlib', 'cblas'`). For this reason, I started from scratch and only included what was needed so far. Any pointers to how to install these dependencies (I think they are needed for the second compilation).

These changes: 

```
-# distutils: sources = sage/libs/ppl_shim.cc
+# distutils: sources = src/sage/libs/ppl_shim.cc
```
are not good. The root of the sagelib source tree is `src`, and paths are relative to this - this is where `setup.py` lives, after all.

As a way forward, I would suggest to actually work on #29864 instead of the present ticket. #29864 is a step in the modularization task (#29705), creating two new distributions - `sage-core` and `sage-tdlib`. `sage-core` is like `sagelib` minus `sage-tdlib` and without the fancy incremental installation tricks.

Thanks for the feedback. I'll try to find a way to specify the paths relative to `src`. I think my problem there was that `setup.py` is invoked from the central `sage` script, which sits in the root and not in the src folder.

Package `sage-core` created in #29864 will be a version of sagelib with a plain setuptools build system, intended for (modular) deployment of the Sage library on PyPI.  Since setuptools supports `setup.py develop`, this has synergy with your goal. 

And we will be able to work on the build system of `sage-core`, across several tickets, without having to worry about breaking `sagelib` builds - or what current users/developers are expecting of it.

The only thing that I still don't understand is how the modularization will help with the compilation of cython files. If if everything is modularized, I guess the setup.py will still be used for this. And the point of this ticket is to improve the cyhonization...

-After removing the sagelib installation (e.g. using `make sagelib-clean`), one can try to do an editable install (aka `setup.py develop`) to make development more convenient.
+After #30527, it is possible to install Python packages built by the Sage distribution into user-defined venvs.  
 
-This currently fails as follows:
+In this ticket, we create `src/requirements.txt` and modify `src/setup.py` to facilitate this, including editable installs (`pip install --editable`).

"Semi" because not all pyx files could be compiled successfully since  they rely on external dependencies (e.g. singular, giac, ecl, ratpoints, ...).

For now, I've excluded the relevant pyx files from the compilation. Any ideas how to handle these dependencies are welcome! One approach would be to treat them similar to the the optional packages by putting a "sage_setup distribution" tag to the pyx file.

I also tried to run `pipenv install` directly under Windows, but that's not possible at the moment as some of the dependencies cannot be installed on Windows currently:

Thanks for the quick feedback.

I agree the modularization is a good way to approach these problems. Sadly, I feel like this requires too much in-depth knowledge of sage for me to contribute directly. But after skimming the tickets, I suggest you have a look at my changes here to the way distributions are excluded. This seems to be somewhat opposite to say #29864 where this is handled by adding a new setup-tdlib/setup.py. For the in-place installation it is important that the src/setup.py results in a working installation.

What do you suggest as the way forward to align this ticket with the modularization effort?

As for #30578, my motivation here is a bit different: I wanted to have a prototype for sagelib with pipenv that works without ever invoking `sage/make` and directly uses the versions of the dependencies found on pypi instead of (re)building them locally.

> I suggest you have a look at my changes here to the way distributions are excluded. 

Well, it's the same as before in sagelib's setup.py, filtering by distributions, plus some hardcoded ones.

Sounds like a bad PYTHONPATH. `src/sage` should not be in it.

Hm, that's still happening? Sorry I lost track of this since various other things seemed to break on WSL. Have you tried with downgrading/upgrading the pip package?

-After #30527 and #30578, it is possible to install Python packages built by the Sage distribution into user-defined venvs.  
+We modify `src/setup.py` to support editable installs via pipenv (`pipenv install -e .`, which invokes `pip install --editable`).

+```
+cd src

+It generates a virtual env in `src/.venv` that contains all necessary libraries, and an editable install of sage.
+Note: This probably doesn't work out of the box, and a few manual steps are necessary to install the required libraries (see below for instructions for WSL).

Some comments on items in the ticket description:
> TODO (as followup tickets):
> - Automatically generate the `apt-get install` command with the necessary libraries (add them as `distros/debian.txt`?)

`./configure` takes care of all of this. Do you plan to do system interface configuration and system package advice without using `./configure` (or, more generally, Unix shell scripts)?  

A way forward is to reimplement (cleaner version of) some of the simple shell code for system package advice as Python code in `sage_bootstrap`. See #29146.

> - Remove `ARB_LIBRARY` env variable, and move check from `arb/config.m4` to `env.py`

My suggestion:  Instead of discussing to remove this variable (or other configuration variables that are set by `./configure`), rather discuss different ways of generating the `sage_conf` module / or providing different implementations of the interface defined by the `sage_conf` module for different use cases (such as supporting a platform that does not have a Unix shell).

> - Move package dependencies from pipfile to install_requires in `src/setup.py`. 

Best to put them in `src/setup.cfg` instead of `src/setup.py` (see #30578)

Something is generating a `pyproject.toml` in `src/` and then it dies with

I had a closer look at this, and it turns out that the first time pip is correctly called without any `--no-use-pep517` argument, only on the retry this argument is used. Thus, the error actually shadows another error that occurs during the initial `pip install`.

Can you thus run the following `pipenv run pip install -e . --no-build-isolation` after `pipenv install`. This should point to the real issue why the editable install fails. 

I've created a github workflow because I don't have a mac. https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/blob/public/build/inplace/.github/workflows/ci-pipenv.yml It shows the same problem, the `pipenv install` fails apparently due to a pep517 issue, but the editable install actually fails due to missing interpreters and other dependencies (which requires manual installations as in the ticket description).

Well, the virtual environment has a `bin/sage` script, so `sage -t` "should" work. If it does not, this needs to be fixed. Likely some work in the direction of #22731 is necessary.

Yeah, `sage -t` still uses the python in `sage/local`. So this does not work, and a mechanism is needed to use the python of the activated virtual env (without changing env variables which is too inflexible in my opinion).

Directly running `bin/sage-runtests --all` also leads to errors:

```

ValueError: unknown file extension ''
```

(I guess some files are not found.)


Anyway, that's probably a topic for another ticket.

Replying to [@tobiasdiez](#comment%3A133):
> Is there a reason why `LIBDIR` is used in `env.py` instead of the approach using `pkgconfig` as during compilation time?

pkgconfig does not really reveal the libname directly, so one would need to parse `pkgconfig --libs`. 

Another reason is that the .pc files are usually only available in "dev" packages. So the runtime of Sage should not depend on it. 

#29024 intends to make the location configurable (at build time!) via `sage_conf`.

Thanks for the input. I had a closer look at `_get_shared_lib_filename` and the problem was that `libsingular-Singular.so` is in the subfolder `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/` while `_get_shared_lib_filename` only searched the top folder `/usr/lib`. I've now changed it to also look in subfolders. That should be reasonable fix until #29024 is implemented.

It's nice to see that it only takes about 1 hour to have a fully workable sage environment.

This is now really ready for review.

TODOs (for further tickets):
- Investigate what needs to be installed on macOS to have a successful build, and add these steps to the github action. (I don't have a mac, so I'll not work on this.)
- Run doctests in the github action as soon as they no longer rely on `SAGE_LOCAL` (#22731)

It has been reported that the current `src/setup.py` (in Sage 9.2) is able to install a working sagelib on top of conda (see #28745). 

I'll create a test for this in #30845, and then we can test the present ticket to make sure it does not break anything.

 TODO (as followup tickets):
 - Add documentation on how to set up the virtual environment, using either plain `python -m venv`, `virtualenv` (20.x), or `pipenv`. Below are a few pointers on how to do this, but they are overly complicated at the moment and we should work on the following issues to make the process smoother.
-- A few libraries are not contained in `distros/debian.txt` files. Should they be added? In particular, this concerns libsingular4-dev, liblinbox-dev, libratpoints-dev, libgap-dev, ecl, libpynac-dev.
+- A few libraries are not contained in `distros/debian.txt` files. Should they be added? In particular, this concerns libsingular4-dev, liblinbox-dev, libratpoints-dev, libgap-dev, ecl, libpynac-dev. Tracked at #30859.
 - Remove `ARB_LIBRARY` env variable, and move check from `arb/config.m4` to `env.py`
 - Fix cysignals, see https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals/issues/111.
 - Move package dependencies from pipfile to install_requires in `src/setup.py`. See https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/967a05bfffcb68f97296eda197b062221c2ebc0d/Pipfile#L25 and "Problem: Hiding broken setup.py defined dependencies" in https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1911.

Thanks for the pointer! I've now added these packages also to the pipfile. However, it is way beyond the scope of this ticket to make the doctest pass in the GH pipenv workflow. There are just so many things that need to be changed in order for the doctests to find the correct dependencies. For example, here are a few relevant error messages:

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/mnt/d/Programming/Projects/sage/src/.venv/bin/gap'

RuntimeError: unable to start singular because the command 'Singular -t --ticks-per-sec 1000 --cntrlc=a' failed: The command was not found or was not executable: Singular.

RuntimeError: In order to initialize the database, /__w/sage/sage/src/.venv/share/conway_polynomials/conway_polynomials.p must exist.
```

I know that some of these errors would disappear if one use your recent progress towards installation of sage-build wheels.

Anyway, the aim of this ticket is to create a mostly-working editable install of sagelib. Making the doctests pass relative to this editable install in a venv should be subject of a follow-up ticket.

Yes, it's still not working. In a few weeks I'll get a new PC and then will try again afresh using WSL 2.0.

There are still a few hundreds that fail (see below for details), most of which are related to issues with maxima (TypeError: unable to start maxima: End Of File (EOF). Exception style platform.) or fpylll (blocked due to https://github.com/fplll/fpylll/issues/185). Since most test pass and there are many subpackages for which all tests pass, I'd say that's enough \"proof of concept\" for this ticket and would leave the rest for follow-up tickets.\n\n```\n2020-11-17T19:31:00.7800025Z sage -t --random-seed=0 /__w/sage/sage/src/sage/interacts/debugger.py  #

After playing around with it further I was able to make most of the tests pass. There are still a few hundreds that fail (see below for details), most of which are related to issues with maxima (TypeError: unable to start maxima: End Of File (EOF). Exception style platform.) or fpylll (blocked due to https://github.com/fplll/fpylll/issues/185). Since most test pass and there are many subpackages for which all tests pass, I'd say that's enough "proof of concept" for this ticket and would leave the rest for follow-up tickets.

Ensuring that the feature of installing sagelib on top of conda is not broken is a prerequisite for merging this ticket.

To move this ticket forward, could you help me with this GH Actions test?  (This should be on top of #30944, which still needs review)

I think there should be one new workflow for all tests that do not build the Sage distribution (no `build/pkgs`).

Well, it will be testing something that currently happens to work but is not automatically tested.

All workflows test from-scratch builds of the Sage distribution. 
Two workflows separately test optional / experimental packages. That's really all.

> But I am skeptical about checking in the `Pipfile.lock`. Stuff for nightmare merge conflicts for everyone. I think it would be better if this was an ignored file.

Without the lock file you wouldn't get a reproducible virtual environment, since pipenv would always use the latest versions (that are compatible with each other). Moreover, the lock file is normally not changed, except if you call `pipenv update`. 
The workflow to update Python packages would then look as follows:
- Run `pipenv update`
- Test
- If everything is fine, create ticket updating pipfile.lock and create a ticket for each updated dependency that is also listed in sage's build/pgks folder.

Will have a look at the other todo's you mention.

I guess the current github workflows don't see this as everything is invoked in one tox command and not in multiple steps (and enviroment variables are only active in each step).

OK, I see. 

There are two ways to fix this:

- as described in #30818 ("Set environment for subprocesses invoked by Sage").  Currently subprocesses (such as the gap process invoked by the pexpect-based gap interface) rely on `sage-env` being sourced
- using `pipenv run sage -t` instead of `pipenv run sage-runtests`, which uses `sage-env`.

Replying to [@tobiasdiez](#comment%3A318):
> Is it actually desired that tox local-homebrew installs a fresh homebrew in the tox folder

Yes, that's by design

> Is there a way to use the system's homebrew?

From tox.ini comments:

```
    # The variant "local-homebrew-macos-usrlocal" uses the global installation in /usr/local
    # instead.  It may install packages or update packages.  It will not remove packages.
    # Use at your own risk.

Thanks! That is working nicely.

I think I've now addressed all your comments and suggestions.

The only thing is that since merging the latest develop branch the sage packages (installed via tox) are no longer found when running `pipenv install`. At the commit https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/4bdfef1b21da9f376cfd3c096cb9932fe5334e4e this was working, but stopped after I've merged the develop branch.

I've also tried your suggestion with `sage -sh pipenv` but run into several issues. I guess the problem is that pipenv is trying to reuse sages virtual environment.

Thanks for making all the changes. 

Right now it's hard for me to test anything from this ticket because the homebrew changes in #31335 conflict.

I would propose to do the following: 
- Rebasing/squashing this branch on top of #31362, current #30770, and #30912.
- Merging the rebase back into the current branch -- by this trick you won't get merge conflicts in your other branches that depend on this ticket (if any)

You could have course build every package in the sage distribution, but the point is that with pipenv only a couple of them are actually needed.\n\nSo `build-local = sagelib-build-deps + maxima conway_polynomials jmol conway_polynomials elliptic_curves combinatorial_designs polytopes_db graphs threejs` ?",

More in the sense, that it was a bit of try-and-error to find the minimal set of make targets that make the build pass. You could have course build every package in the sage distribution, but the point is that with pipenv only a couple of them are actually needed.

So `build-local = sagelib-build-deps + maxima conway_polynomials jmol conway_polynomials elliptic_curves combinatorial_designs polytopes_db graphs threejs` ?

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:363\" align=\"right\">comment:363</div>\n\nHi Vincent, thanks for joining the discussion.\n\nFor a discussion of possible distribution strategies using wheels, let's use #31251 (Meta-ticket: Distribution as wheels), which also has a link to a recent post by Gommers on packaging. I agree with you that it is a hard problem.\n\nFor Sage 9.3, I have a much more modest goal regarding wheels that is already fully implemented and is only waiting for review (see ticket list in #29705 for tickets by milestone).

Hi Vincent, thanks for joining the discussion.

For a discussion of possible distribution strategies using wheels, let's use #31251 (Meta-ticket: Distribution as wheels), which also has a link to a recent post by Gommers on packaging. I agree with you that it is a hard problem.

For Sage 9.3, I have a much more modest goal regarding wheels that is already fully implemented and is only waiting for review (see ticket list in #29705 for tickets by milestone). Since #29500 (already in Sage 9.2), we generate wheels in `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/wheels`. These wheels are not distributable as they do not bundle their shared library dependencies but rather rpath into `$SAGE_LOCAL`. Users can make their own venvs for development purposes where they install the prebuilt wheels from this directory. #31045 and #31279 add some missing wheels. #30913 generates dependency metadata that makes it easier to set up the venv; and adds tests using `tox`.

For editable install of sagelib as part of the normal build system (no extra venv) using Tobias' new `setup.py` from this ticket, see #31377.

I don't know which problem you are trying to solve with the big try/except. I don't think reducing `ImportError` is the correct solution.

If you are trying to make `setup.py sdist` work when libs are missing, consider using the code from `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/setup.py` line 61

Also the documentation on Pipenv added in `src/doc/en/developer/coding_basics.rst` is not sufficiently specific about the steps needed before pipenv is installed and used.

I was not aware of the sage-env script. How does one uses it to set the environment for the following steps and replace the manual exports I've added? I couldn't find any documentation about that script.

Replying to [@tobiasdiez](#comment%3A415):
> ... can be easily updated by running `pipenv lock` so it's not a lot of overhead. Please also note that it doesn't need to be updated every time a sage dependency is updated since pipenv uses the `install_requires` information to determine the admissible versions. I would suggest to run `pipenv lock` after every release for now and see how this goes.

Could you add the precise process to the documentation please? This would be a task for the release manager, who would need to be briefed about this in detail

> The point of the lock file is also to ensure that the python environment is the same for everyone (which makes it easier to reproduce issues and test failures etc)

I understand that for general Python projects it has the benefit that you describe (although the benefit over plain `requirements.txt` is still not clear to me, but let's not elaborate on this now).

The problem is that in our case, adding the lock file locks versions that (1) are *not the same* as the ones in the Sage distribution, (2) it will be out of date next week because we have no established process to update it. So it reduces clarity for users and creates a maintenance burden for Sage development.

I think it would be a good idea to work on a process (= script/documentation) based on pipenv that actually helps Sage developers to make Python package upgrades. Currently this is a manual process based on guesswork and testing. So this could be a key added value that Pipenv provides.

I was not able to make it work locally nor on github (where it fails with exit code 127 without giving any details). That's mostly because of my missing experience with bash and linux things.

Sagelib (things in `src`) declares its dependencies in form of `install_requires`. Currently, sage-the-distrubition is one way to provide a certain set of packages that satisfy the version constraints. The newly added pipfile.lock specifies another set of packages that also satisfy the constraints. If sagelib is indeed configured correctly, then it should work with both sets. So you can see the added github workflow as a test that the install_requires constraints are correct.\n\n> (2) it will be out of date next week because we have no established process to update it. So it reduces clarity for users and creates a maintenance burden for Sage development.\n\ndependabot or rennovate are the modern approaches to not worry about manually updating dependencies. But they don't support trac...\nBut updating the pipfile lock manually is easy, automated and only needs to be done rarely. Its definitively more convenient then updating the versions in sage-the-distro.\n \n> I think it would be a good idea to work on a process (= script/documentation) based on pipenv that actually helps Sage developers to make Python package upgrades.

Maybe a shift in viewpoint might be helpful to see how pipenv helps. Sagelib (things in `src`) declares its dependencies in form of `install_requires`. Currently, sage-the-distrubition is one way to provide a certain set of packages that satisfy the version constraints. The newly added pipfile.lock specifies another set of packages that also satisfy the constraints. If sagelib is indeed configured correctly, then it should work with both sets. So you can see the added github workflow as a test that the install_requires constraints are correct.

> (2) it will be out of date next week because we have no established process to update it. So it reduces clarity for users and creates a maintenance burden for Sage development.

dependabot or rennovate are the modern approaches to not worry about manually updating dependencies. But they don't support trac...
But updating the pipfile lock manually is easy, automated and only needs to be done rarely. Its definitively more convenient then updating the versions in sage-the-distro.

I don't find this convincing. A checked-in `Pipfile.lock` is just the result of resolving the declared version constraints (as of some point in the past) against what was available on the index at some some point in the past.

When the workflow fails, it will mean just one thing: Constraints were updated and Pipfile.lock was not updated (-> maintenance burden).

It's more valuable to test on GH Actions whether the declared version constraints resolve *at the current time* to a set of versions that work correctly. If this fails, it is clear that the constraints declared in `install_requires` are not correct.

It was actually something strange going on on my system. After make distclean I could run sage-env locally and then also in the github action. Sorry for the confusion and thanks for your help.

The update mode was a bit more work than I'd liked but its running now. See https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/runs/3926515272?check_suite_focus=true for an example output. It can be activated by running the workflow manually from the github interface (after it is merged into the default branch).

Sorry for not testing it after my last merge of the develop branch.

It turned out there is a problem (only reported by pipenv using the `--verbose` flag) during the installation of sage in the virtual environment. In fact, it turns out that this is not related at all to pipenv but a general issue with the installation using build isolution, so I've opened #32904 for this.

For pipenv this can be fixed by running 

```
pipenv run pip install -e . --upgrade --exists-action=i --no-build-isolation
``` 
after the initial build of the venv. I've changed the ticket description accordingly.

Thanks for testing!

Some failing tests are to be expected since pipenv is rather different to the existing way to use sage (as part of sage-the-distribution). But I think for the modularization effort this ticket gives a helpful testcase how sage performs in a "pip-installable" environment.

I also had problems with gap (for the github action) and fixed it by manually setting the SAEG_LOCAL env variable. I guess there is potential for improvement as follow-up tickets but I'm not the right person to work on this as I'm not familiar with these parts of sage.
