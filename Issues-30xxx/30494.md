It seems that when configuring `gf2x` and `ecl`, at least, something like `-Wall` is being used. I see this kind of thing in the `config.log` files for those:

```
conftest.c:4:3: error: implicitly declaring library function 'exit' with type 'void (int) __attribute__((noreturn))' [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  exit(0);
  ^
conftest.c:4:3: note: include the header <stdlib.h> or explicitly provide a declaration for 'exit'

```
Is there some setting in Xcode's command-line tools that has changed, causing these errors?

Hi,

I just learned about this ticket. (me = upstream gf2x)

I don't have access to a box of this kind, so I can't test. (all I have is macOS 10.15.5 + XCode 11.6).

It looks like latest xcode doesn't like the tests that are generated by autotools, right ? If yes, does a autoreconf with fresh autotools fix the problem ?

The Sage build log for `symmetrica` contains:

```
hiccup.c:478:3: error: implicit declaration of function 'set_multiplier' is invalid in C99 [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
                set_multiplier(S_MO_K(S_L_S(a)));

I'm seeing this on OS X 10.15.6 after an upgrade to Xcode 12. You could try upgrading to Xcode 12, if you're willing to take that risk.

I'm not an expert in this sort of thing, but I don't think this will work. `autoreconf` would help if Sage's top-level `configure` script were running into problems, but the problems are coming from Sage packages. Those are just tarballs, and running `autoreconf` once won't help with those. For what it's worth, I unpacked the `gf2x` tarball and ran `autoreconf` on it, but I got the same error.

(This is with `autoreconf` 2.69 installed via homebrew. I did `brew upgrade` first. I'm not sure how to get a "fresh autotools".)

I think errors like this are usually from code incorrectly assuming that some header pulls in some other header.  Adding the correct includes should fix this.

Not light-heartedly for sure. It's a mac mini that has been living in an office of (very) mac-averse researchers for years and years, crawling under the ram demands of the latest macOS (and actually last it can support).

I didn't make myself clear. Of course I mean autoreconf for gf2x.

ok.

doesn't say much. 2.69 is the banner under which all autoconf version have been presenting themselves for 8 years. IDK about the others, but I suspect autoconf is at fault here anyway.

The `gf2x` configure script says

Try the patch above. This will fix both the autoconf input (just in case) and output (so that you don't have to rerun autoconf, a plain ./configure would do).
These bits of the config checks are created by m4 code that sits in gf2x, so it's really a gf2x bug.

I think that -Wall is not the problem. We're witnessing a -Werror behaviour here. That is odd. -Werror in config checks is a bit extreme, and easily counter-productive. config checks that battle the -Werror reports might well defeat the grand portability goal of autoconf

The catch with my patch above is that because of this -Werror behaviour, I think that more failures are likely to show up down the line. (well, you seem to say that it works fine. good!)

I cannot reproduce the breakade you are talking about. It all works for me with Xcode 12.0 on macOS 10.15.6. 
The latest Xcode 12 beta is in fact 12.2.beta. I'll check with it shortly.

Downgraded to critical, as this is about a beta, which should not stop the release.

Volker, what is your take on this? This is all about betaOS/beta tools. Would be nice to have in 9.2 fixed, but not strictly necessary.

sorry for noise - it turns out that to properly reinstall command line tools, one needs to `sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`
Once I did the latter, and reinstalled, I got clang 12 there, too.

That is, XCode 12 (stable) also suffers from these ailments.

```
(This is the only `config.log` file around, so I'm not sure what it's talking about.) Maybe the homebrew installations of `openblas` and `gsl` are confusing it. To be honest, I'm not sure that Sage's `gsl` built with the homebrew `openblas` before.

There is a problem with another package, but I can't figure out which. If I run

```
$ ./configure --with-system-boost_cropped=no --with-system-curl=yes --with-system-freetype=no --with-system-glpk=no --with-system-gmp=no --with-system-libffi=no --with-system-libgd=no --with-system-libpng=no --with-system-mpc=no --with-system-mpfi=no --with-system-mpfr=no --with-system-ninja_build=no --with-system-ntl=no --with-system-pkgconf=no --with-system-ppl=no --with-system-python3=no --with-system-sqlite=no --with-system-suitesparse=no --with-system-yasm=no --with-system-zeromq=no --with-system-zlib
```
then Sage builds, but the docs fail with this:

Did you try with Sage's GMP 6.1.2?
It's old. I tried building and testing GMP 6.2.0, all its tests pass.
For the record, it's on `kabylake-apple-darwin19.6.0`, clang version 1200.0.32.4

This is the same GMP version as on Homebrew, so it should be OK to use the latter.

Yes: using Sage's gmp, glpk, and ppl leads to failures when building the documentation (and also doctest failures along the same lines): see [comment:69](#comment%3A69). I was trying to see if the packages passed their test suites after seeming to install correctly.

Sorry, our Trac server does not offer that option.

That could be solved by updating Trac or adding
some Trac plugin or moving to a different issue
tracker, such as the GitLab one. None of these
seems likely to happen very soon.

So far all you can do is filter emails on your
side to send such updates to the trash.

Sorry about that.

> `scipoptsuite` is broken because the tarball can't be found.

Maybe this is intentional, given `SPKG.rst`: 

```
We do not have permission to redistribute SCIP or SoPlex. Hence, you
must download it yourself from http://scip.zib.de and put the tarball
``scipoptsuite-VERSION.tgz`` in ``$SAGE_ROOT/upstream``, renaming
it to ``scipoptsuite-VERSION-do-not-distribute.tgz``.
```
If anyone cares about this package, they should create a better error message: maybe create `spkg-preinst.in` that tests for the presence of the tarball in `upstream` and exit with an appropriate message if it's not there. I don't know if that would actually work, or if the tarball is attempted to be downloaded before anything else happens. Anyway, I don't care about this package, so I am not likely to work on it.
