the interface needed tweaking to let Sage inetegers to be used.

Without this tweak, it caused some test failures in `sage/repl/image.py` because Sage integers are not allowed for the `color` property. Until now, one could bypass the type check by putting the integer in a 1-tuple, but that no longer works in 8.0

This also fixes an issue with header names (present pillow has Zip.h, which may [clash](https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/sage-devel/a681be07-112f-4e98-abc0-37f1c7896ae3n%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer) on macOS with zip.h) - this is fixed in 8.0.
