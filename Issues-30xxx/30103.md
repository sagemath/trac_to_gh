I don't see how this is in analogy to #29448

With zlib we don't use pkg-config - so something really goes bad in pillow.

Pillow's build system is a half-baked reimplementation of autotools in python. It tries and fails to guess the system library location, whereas `AC_CHECK_LIB` actually compiles and links something, so it doesn't need to guess.

The first thing we should do is upgrade to the latest version of pillow so that we aren't completely wasting our time.

Well, pillow uses pkg-config to find zlib, as you can see in the bug report:

```
[pillow-5.3.0.p0] Looking for `zlib` using pkg-config.
[pillow-5.3.0.p0] Looking for zlib
```

7.2.0 still uses the same approach for finding its libraries.

Since it checks each library using pkgconfig first, Dima's approach of generating fake pkgconfig files (from the abandoned ticket #28906) could be a solution that would not require patching pillow.
