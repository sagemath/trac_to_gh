Nice simplification! To secure it, one should probably perform

```diff
- self._degree = degree
+ self._degree = ZZ(degree)
```
in the `__init__` method of `ExtPowerFreeModule` and `ExtPowerDualFreeModule`.

Sure - we notice performance regressions sometimes when doctests suddenly time out. But obviously doctests are not very well suited as benchmarks.

Yes, this is an important point - and one for which Sage unfortunately does not have a very good solution. Sure - we notice performance regressions sometimes when doctests suddenly time out. But obviously doctests are not very well suited as benchmarks. (One might think about "# optional - benchmark" annotations though...)

(By the way, some of the doctests in sage.manifolds probably should be marked "long" -- I frequently see them time out in the automated tests on [GitHub](GitHub) actions - see for example https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/910575697?check_suite_focus=true)
