Nice simplification! To secure it, one should probably perform

```diff
- self._degree = degree
+ self._degree = ZZ(degree)
```
in the `__init__` method of `ExtPowerFreeModule` and `ExtPowerDualFreeModule`.

Absolutely. I'll hope to do that when I have learned more about the manifolds code (I hope to be using this code soon for some of my research), or when it becomes necessary because of changes in the tensor modules code. Do feel free to make these changes if you would like them earlier.

Please be aware of that fact. I don't think it will go so far, but it would be very sad if the `manifolds` module would be unusable in the upcoming version of Sage.\n\n\nThanks for expressing your concern. However, as Matthias pointed out in his reply (comment:9), doctests shall prevent breakage in the manifold part. It remains true that doctests are not exhaustive and it will be more satisfactory to have a more comprehensive test suite, albeit more CPU consuming. Such a suite could be derived from the [manifold examples page](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples.html). I guess one shall first turn these Jupyter notebooks into rst files, via the export menu. When there is a significant change in the manifold/tensor code, I usually run by hand some selected examples from the above page, typically, the [S2 sphere](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_sphere_S2.ipynb), the [S3 one](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_sphere_S3_Hopf.ipynb), the [Kerr spacetime](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_Kerr.ipynb) (good test of parallel computation of the Riemann tensor) and the [anti-de Sitter space](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_anti_de_Sitter.ipynb). An automated test suite would be of great help in this respect. \n\nAnother concern one might have is performance, which is not tracked by doctests, but could be in the test suite (note that there is a total CPU time measurement in the Kerr notebook mentioned above). \n\nThat being said, I think the changes in the `tensor` modules proposed by Matthias are great improvements. In particular, they shall make `FiniteRankFreeModule` usable for other purposes than tensor field computations on smooth manifolds. \n\n> Furthermore, since the `manifolds` module is similarly structured, it is very likely that analogous improvements can be applied there, too.\n\nIndeed!",

Replying to [@mjungmath](#comment%3A8):
> This is just a general comment not only related to this ticket (I picked this ticket randomly), but worth to emphasize once again: the deeper you dig and the more comprehensive your modifications are in the `tensor` module, the more likely it may corrupt the manifolds code, as there is a *very* strong dependence. Please be aware of that fact. I don't think it will go so far, but it would be very sad if the `manifolds` module would be unusable in the upcoming version of Sage.


Thanks for expressing your concern. However, as Matthias pointed out in his reply (comment:9), doctests shall prevent breakage in the manifold part. It remains true that doctests are not exhaustive and it will be more satisfactory to have a more comprehensive test suite, albeit more CPU consuming. Such a suite could be derived from the [manifold examples page](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/examples.html). I guess one shall first turn these Jupyter notebooks into rst files, via the export menu. When there is a significant change in the manifold/tensor code, I usually run by hand some selected examples from the above page, typically, the [S2 sphere](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_sphere_S2.ipynb), the [S3 one](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_sphere_S3_Hopf.ipynb), the [Kerr spacetime](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_Kerr.ipynb) (good test of parallel computation of the Riemann tensor) and the [anti-de Sitter space](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_anti_de_Sitter.ipynb). An automated test suite would be of great help in this respect. 

Another concern one might have is performance, which is not tracked by doctests, but could be in the test suite (note that there is a total CPU time measurement in the Kerr notebook mentioned above). 

That being said, I think the changes in the `tensor` modules proposed by Matthias are great improvements. In particular, they shall make `FiniteRankFreeModule` usable for other purposes than tensor field computations on smooth manifolds. 

> Furthermore, since the `manifolds` module is similarly structured, it is very likely that analogous improvements can be applied there, too.

Indeed!
