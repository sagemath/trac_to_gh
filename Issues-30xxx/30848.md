For a long time now, the Makefile ensures that packages are automatically reinstalled when the version in `build/pkgs/SPKG/package-version.txt` changes. 

Thus we now remove the check whether the installed package version is current from `sage.doctest.control` and `sage_setup` (ex `OptionalExtension` code).

This simplifies the code, and in particular removes the direct reading of `build/pkgs/` from sagelib.
