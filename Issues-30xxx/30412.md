Since `gf2x-1.3.0` does not provide a `configure` script anymore (only `configure.ac`) i called autotools (and removed touching files that was related to some patch that does not exist anymore). Tell me if it is the correct way to do.

Self-tests work well for me.

That's right. See https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#when-to-patch-when-to-repackage-when-to-autoconfiscate -- it falls in the case as "If you have to make changes to configure.ac or other source files of the autotools build system..."

It's an unfortunate trend that upstream maintainers don't prepare actual release tarballs any more...

After the autoreconf as suggested by Dima, run `./configure && make distcheck`.

Put these instructions into an `spkg-src` script.
The tarball can be put as an attachment on the ticket.

I am about to do the same (by direct email). For me, they forgot to produce the file since the `README` still speaks about running `./configure`.

thanks for the heads up.

yes of course you're right.

when ditching gforge in favor of gitlab a few weeks ago, I accidentally forgot the implication that the tarballs that are attached to git tags no longer contain the autotools-generated configure scripts.

I'll try to fix that (and first, find out what is "the right way" to do it).

unlike [GitHub](GitHub), gitlab does not seem to allow attaching binary blobs to releases, only links can be added.
Thus you can create a tarball and post it somewhere. E.g. clone the gitlab repo to a public [GitHub](GitHub), and post the tarball there in a release.
Then you could make a link to it in [GitLab](GitLab).
Or just put it somewhere else on the web.

As a matter of fact, you can add file attachments to the release notes. While this is a manual process that has some some obvious shortcomings, it will do for the time being. I searched a bit for a process that would ship a "make dist"-generated tarball as part of gitlab's ci/cd pipelines, but that does not seem to be possible as of now. Maybe in the future.

For the time being, I did just that, and attached tar.gz for the existing releases (exactly the same tarballs as the ones that used to exist on gforge).

I'm not entirely satisfied, and at this point the url to download these files is too long. Hopefully I'll figure out a way to do that better. But the tar.gz files themselves won't change.
