Hello,

Thank you for contributing new graphs with nice embeddings.

Several improvements are needed in your code (which contains errors). I'm putting below a nicer and corrected version of method `IGraph`.
Use it to improve the code of the other methods.

```
def IGraph(n, j, k):
    r"""
    Return an I-graph with `2n` nodes.

    The variables `n`, `j`, `k` are integers such that `n > 2` and
    `0 < j, k \leq \lfloor (n - 1) / 2 \rfloor`.
    When `j = 1` the resulting graph is isomorphic to the generalized Petersen
    graph with the same `n` and `k`.

    INPUT:

    - ``n`` -- the number of nodes is `2 * n`

    - ``j`` -- integer `0 < j \leq \lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor`. Decides how outer
      vertices are connected.

    - ``k`` -- integer `0 < k \leq \lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor`. Decides how inner
      vertices are connected.

    PLOTTING: Upon construction, the position dictionary is filled to override
    the spring-layout algorithm. By convention, the I-graphs are displayed as an
    inner and outer cycle pair, with the first n nodes drawn on the outer
    circle.  The first (0) node is drawn at the top of the outer-circle, moving
    counterclockwise after that. The inner circle is drawn with the (n)th node
    at the top, then counterclockwise as well.

    EXAMPLES:

    When `j = 1` the resulting graph will be isomorphic to a generalized
    Petersen graph::

        sage: g = graphs.IGraph(7,1,2)
        sage: g2 = GeneralizedPetersenGraph(7,2)
        sage: g.is_isomorphic(g2)
        True
    """
    if n < 3:
        raise ValueError("n must be larger than 2")
    if j < 1 or j > (n - 1) // 2:
        raise ValueError("j must be in 1 <= j <= floor((n - 1) / 2)")
    if k < 1 or k > (n - 1) // 2:
        raise ValueError("k must be in 1 <= k <= floor((n - 1) / 2)")

    G = Graph(2 * n, name="I-graph (n={}, j={}, k={})".format(n, j, k))
    for i in range(n):
        G.add_edge(i, (i + j) % n)
        G.add_edge(i, i + n)
        G.add_edge(i + n, n + (i + k) % n)
    G._circle_embedding(list(range(n)), radius=1, angle=pi/2)
    G._circle_embedding(list(range(n, 2*n)), radius=.5, angle=pi/2)
    return G
```
Could you also explain what is a `IGraph` ? For me this name is confusing since there is a graph library called `igraph`. Is it the most appropriate name ?
