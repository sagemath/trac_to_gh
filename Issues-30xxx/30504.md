configure:

    hint: installing the following system packages, if not
    already present, is recommended and may avoid having to
    build them (though some may have to be built anyway):

      $ sudo port  install ffmpeg imagemagick texinfo graphviz igraph nauty pandoc p5-term-readline-gnu py-tox
    
    MacPorts does not provide unversioned gcc and gfortran executables by default
    To make gfortran available (and build with gcc from XCode), use:
    
      $ export FC=gfortran-mp-10
    
    Alternatively, to use gcc and gfortran from Macports, use:
    
      $ sudo  port select --set gcc mp-gcc10

    After installation, re-run configure using:

      $ ./config.status --recheck && ./config.status
                
make: `config.status' is up to date.
