Mathematica uses "phased permutations" to express tensor symmetries.

A cycle of length k is labeled with a kth root of unity.


http://reference.wolframcloud.com/language/tutorial/TensorSymmetries.html


This generalizes the symmetries that `sage.tensor` can currently express, which are products of full symmetric groups (where the transpositions in the antisymmetries are labeled with -1).

We represent it as a matrix group in GL_n,
and also provide a method that computes its representation as a subgroup of `GL(T^{k,l)M)`.

this seems to generalise to cyclic groups only, no?

Yes, it's a Wolfram-ism, I think

Would these be a generalization of `ColoredPermutations`, where each element of `{1, ..., n}` can have its own distinct cycle length?

yes, but with some kind of compatibility relation, I guess.
