Since #29766 I cannot build Numpy 1.19.1 on Cygwin, specifically with AVX enabled, due to this issue in Numpy (actually caused by a bug in GCC < 8.4): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/16290


I've been meaning to work on this issue anyways, so I'll see if I can find a clean workaround.  If not, it also works to pass some CFLAGS to the Numpy build as noted on the upstream issues.

Yes, this is important to fix. Unfortunately the CI infrastructure does not catch this because we cannot control the processor variant that will run the job. For example, ~~https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/969113336?check_suite_focus=true~~ https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1002630008 has built numpy successfully.

With which compiler are you observing this failure?

It is a problem with GCC<8.4.

I started on a patch to Numpy the week before last but hit a snag before I was able to finish it.  Then I went on vacation :P

An ugly but acceptable workaround is also to set

```
CFLAGS=-ffixed-xmm16 -ffixed-xmm17 -ffixed-xmm18 -ffixed-xmm19 -ffixed-xmm20 -ffixed-xmm21 -ffixed-xmm22 -ffixed-xmm23 -ffixed-xmm24 -ffixed-xmm25 -ffixed-xmm26 -ffixed-xmm27 -ffixed-xmm28 -ffixed-xmm29 -ffixed-xmm30 -ffixed-xmm31
```

when compiling Numpy.

Current cygwin has gcc 10.2. 

I would suggest to limit support of a from-source build of Sage on Cygwin to the latest Cygwin version and encourage users to update Cygwin.

(Does cygwin even have a supported way to install an older version of the distribution?)
