Currently, Sage code contains `_test_xyz` methods that are invoked via doctests and discovered via a custom `TestSuite` class. This ticket is to replace this custom test discovery by the use of the established **pytest** framework https://docs.pytest.org/ (this is in line with #28936 - using mainstream Python test infrastructure).

Advantages of this approach:
- Reuse standard test infrastructure instead of a custom test discovery interface (this is a big maintenance relief, especially given the large list of todos in the `TestSuite` code).
- Better error messages in case a test fails.
- Easier onboarding of new Python developers.
- Clear separation of test methods vs production code. For example, the `*_test.py` files can easily be excluded from distribution.
- Good support by IDEs (auto completion, test discovery and easier invocation). For example, VSCode automatically discovers all pytest tests, provides a convenient interface to run them (all, a selection, only failed ones) and allows to directly start a debug session for a failing test. See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing
- Less and clearer code (no hidden assumptions).

Disadvantages of this approach:
- Current developers have to learn pytest and its conventions (files must be named `*_test.py` and test methods must start with `test_`).
- Tests no longer live in the same file as the code (I would call this an advantage, but some people may prefer to have them really close together).

In order to migrate, the following changes are necessary:
- Move `_test_xyz` from a category `module` to new file `<module>_test.py` (e.g. `finite_semigroups_test.py`).
- Rewrite tests using pytest (which is straightforward and more or less only amounts to removing all the custom code involving `self_tester`).
- Create a new test class for the parent class under test (e.g `TestFiniteSemigroup`).
- Create a static method `category_instances()` in this test class returning a list of instances to test.

For the moment, I did this only for a few test methods in `sets_cat` using finite semigroups as example to illustrate the process.

The new implementation is as follows:
- The test class for the category (e.g. in `sets_cat_test.py`) defines generic tests that should pass for every object in that category. Moreover, the test class may provides instances (objects) to test via the method `category_instances`.
- Running pytest finds the test file `finite_semigroups_test.py`, then determines the categories of the objects (returned from `category_instances`) and adds all generic test methods for that category to the test class (this happens in `conftest.py`).
- Each test method can have the parameter `category_instance` which is bound to the return value of the `category_instances` method.

Running `cd src && pytest --verbose` (from a virtual env with sage and pytest installed), the output is as follows:

As one can see, each general test method is invoked for the three examples.


TODO (in follow-up tickets):
- Complete migration to pytest.
- Once that is done, stop invoking `TestSuite` in doctests and remove the `TestSuite` class.

I've extended the ticket description. Does this clarify your questions?

The test `test_element_eq_reflexive` (and other similar tests to be added) are invoked for each element of `test_elements`. Thus, by adding all the instances currently covered by the unit tests we make sure that the test coverage stays the same.

If you run `pytest` on this branch, it invokes `test_elements_eq_reflexive` with the arguments `['a', 'b', 'c', 'ab', 'ac', 'ba', 'bc', 'ca', 'cb', 'abc']`. 
This is the same as the doctest for `finite_semigroups`:

```
Now, let us look at the structure of the semigroup::

        sage: S = FiniteSemigroups().example(alphabet = ('a','b','c'))
        sage: S.cayley_graph(side="left", simple=True).plot()
        Graphics object consisting of 60 graphics primitives
        sage: S.j_transversal_of_idempotents() # random (arbitrary choice)
        ['acb', 'ac', 'ab', 'bc', 'a', 'c', 'b']

    We conclude by running systematic tests on this semigroup::

        sage: TestSuite(S).run(verbose = True)
        running ._test_an_element() . . . pass
        running ._test_associativity() . . . pass
        running ._test_cardinality() . . . pass
        running ._test_category() . . . pass
        running ._test_construction() . . . pass
        running ._test_elements() . . .
          Running the test suite of self.an_element()
          running ._test_category() . . . pass
          running ._test_eq() . . . pass
          running ._test_new() . . . pass
          running ._test_not_implemented_methods() . . . pass
          running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
          pass
        running ._test_elements_eq_reflexive() . . . pass
        running ._test_elements_eq_symmetric() . . . pass
        running ._test_elements_eq_transitive() . . . pass
        running ._test_elements_neq() . . . pass
        running ._test_enumerated_set_contains() . . . pass
        running ._test_enumerated_set_iter_cardinality() . . . pass
        running ._test_enumerated_set_iter_list() . . . pass
        running ._test_eq() . . . pass
        running ._test_new() . . . pass
        running ._test_not_implemented_methods() . . . pass
        running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
        running ._test_some_elements() . . . pass
```
So the idea would be to replace this doctest by `pytest`. There are a few more doctests of this form that can be replaced in a similar vain by adding the corresponding elements to the `test_elements` list.

A few? Currently `_test_elements_eq_reflexive` is invoked by `TestSuite(object).run()` whenever `object` happens to be in the category of sets. This is a huge, dynamically determined list.

Thanks for this clarification. I'm setting this ticket to "needs_work" because the branch in this form is not complete -- it effectively removes existing tests for  `_test_elements_eq_reflexive`. Without a much more complete branch that reaches test parity, this idea is difficult to evaluate.

It's really hard to see from this ticket how this is intended to go.

The previous version that I reviewed was removing existing doctests and reimplementing a small subset of them using pytest.

Now the new version is only adding some new tests using pytest that seem to duplicate some existing tests run by the doctest framework.

But even for the test function that you already added, it is only testing a few objects.

So to get parity even for this one test function, `category_instances` would have to be extended vastly -- if I understand the design correctly.

It is unclear who should do this work and why.

I've now vastly extended the tests, and replaced some of the TestSuite calls by pytest. A handful of test methods are still missing to get full feature parity (will do this later), but I hope the idea and design get clearer now (at the cost that there are bigger changes).

The following change is characteristic for the aim of migrating from Sage's custom TestSuite framework to pytest:

```
-        sage: TestSuite(C).run()
+        sage: import pytest
+        sage: pytest.main(["-r", "test_finite_semigroups.py"])
```
(calling pytest from the doctests is only a temporary work-around until it's properly integrated into the build chain)

I guess there are two ways for migration:
- Replace one test in the category framework by a pytest, and then make sure that this test is invoked for every example. Do this again for every test.
- Duplicate all tests in the category framework using pytest, and then replace one `TestSuite(...).run` statement by its pytest equivalent. Do this again for every test invocation.

Since there are only a small number of tests (order of 10) but way more examples (order of 1000), my idea was follow the second approach since this can be done easier in steps.

Of course, the complete migration is quite a huge project. This ticket was meant to as a starting point.

The advantages I see of pytest over a custom testsuite implementation are in the ticket description.

The design is as follows. Say you have a category `LieGroups` combining the categories `Manifolds` and `Groups`.
Then you:
1. Create `manifolds_test` and `groups_test` files, specifying the category tests that should hold for all objects of this category.
2. Create a `liegroups_test` file, specifying in `category_instances` the examples of Lie groups you want to test, say `SO(3)` and `SU(2)`. Moreover, add test methods that are particular for the cateogory of Lie groups.

When run, the code then looks at these examples, determines that they are objects of the categories Manifolds, Groups and Lie Groups and collects all tests from `manifolds_test`, `groups_test` and `liegroups_test`.

This can already be seen in action in the code, where the finite semigroups inhert tests from the category of sets and of finite sets.

Hello!

Thanks for bringing me in the conversation. It's been
ten years since I designed TestSuite (with the help
from many). Since that time, Python and the available
testing tools have evolved a lot. I am
glad to see efforts going into rethinking the design
in this new context, questioning the implementation,
and studying alternatives that would reach the
same design goals but better suit the context.
Especially toward using
now standard infrastructure and practice to reduce
both the technical debt and the entry barrier for
new devs and/or for integration with other software.

<div id="comment:51" align="right">comment:51</div>

(the rant may be a bit long, so I am splitting this into several comments).

So, what were these design goals:

(I) Hardening library and user defined algebraic structures, and beyond

The tests are there for checking the internal consistency
of category code and for checking that parents (and their
elements, morphisms, ...) satisfy the specifications of their
categories (e.g. axioms). Supporting user defined algebraic structures is
a must. In my research area we routinely create new algebraic
structures, and when doing so TestSuite is a daily tool:
practice has told me that, once the implementation of
that algebraic structure pass the testsuite, most of the time
it's actually correct (certainly something that is research
area dependent!).

In some cases, it even becomes a research tool: I am not
sure whether the newly defined algebraic structure actually
satisfy the axioms I want it to satisfy, and I use TestSuite
to actually run checks. And use post-mortem instrospection
with the debugger to actually recover the counter examples ot
my conjectures.

The next step in this direction is to work toward merging
the `_test_xxx` methods and `_is_xxx` methods: most of the time,
the code is mostly the same: checking whether axiom xxx is
satisfied. What changes is how thorough the test is, and
how failures are reported. I have toyed around with the idea
with prototypes in sage-semigroups. Alas I never got to actually
converge to a proposal for Sage. But this is something we want
to keep in mind.

(II) Categories as bookshelves of code, documentation and tests

Each category models some algebraic realm. 
Like the bookshelf about Group Theory in a library,
the category of groups in GAP or Sage ties together
everything that applies to all groups: code, documentation,
and tests. In a perfect world where the same system would
be used for computations and proofs, I would include here
mathematical statements (e.g. formulae for the axioms)
and proofs! Then, there are subshelves for group elements,
group morphisms, ... Subshelves for particular types of
groups, and so on.

There are several ways to implement that tying together.
In GAP, categories are a mere filters; each method is
tied to a category through an individual declaration.
And the language uses a bespoke method resolution that
data. In [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) instead, we decided to rely on
standard OO method resolution, grouping together methods
in classes. Both approaches have their advantages notably
in terms of flexibility left to organize the code, and
enable user extensions to existing categories.


Two features are required for testing purposes:

(a) Recovering all the tests that one wants to run to check an object in category A

(b) For each of them, resolving which test method is to be called. Indeed, a subcategory may overload a _test_xxx method when, for example, it has a more efficient way to check xxx.


Note that (b) is of the same nature as when resolving a usual method call. It thus seems highly desirable to use the exact same resolution mechanism as for code.

Nothing much to say here: whatever design is chosen should scale to

A critical bit is to satisfy as much as possible the Single Source

I should only need to update a single location in the code.

Sorry for the rant; I am trying to clarify for myself what
guided -- implicitly or explicitly -- the design back then :-)
Hopefully this is useful food for thought for a redesign.

Oh, one piece of information in case it would be relevant: for the longest time
it's been on my pile to instrument TestSuite so that, by running the Sage
tests, one would get a relatively thorough list of all Sage parents together
with their categories.

A typical applications would be to enable inverse lookup: given a category, suggest to the user a relatively thorough list of parents implementing that category; e.g. for documentation purposes.

Oh, that's wonderful feedback! This kind of deep insight is hard to get if you only read the existing code and don't know the story behind it's origin. Thanks a lot for your detailed account.

Please don't take this proposal as a critics of your work on the TestSuite. I was actually amazed when I discovered that Sage has it's own testing framework. The main idea behind this ticket was to outsource the cost of maintenance of such a framework to the broader Python community, so that we can focus on the math-related elements.

Concerning your points, I'm happy to report that the proposed design should fit all the points you mentioned. In short:

(I): It is flexible enough to accommodate new user-defined categories and examples.

(II): It relies on pytest's discovery mechanism, which makes it very transparent which tests are run for a given category object.

(III): Scalability is a bit hard to judge for me, since I'm not that familiar with all the possible edge cases. But so far I had no problems migrating the existing code.
In particular, the "single source of truth principle" applies, since the testing code only relies on the calculated super categories.


Hence, I would like to invite you to play around with the new design and see if it's works for your use cases. Basic documentation about pytest is added in #31003. Let me know if you encounter any problems.

Merry Christmas!

 - Reuse standard test infrastructure instead of a custom test discovery interface (this is a big plus as we do not have to maintain it ourself, especially given the large list of todo's in the TestSuite code)
 - With this there also comes better error messages in case a test fails.
 - Easier onboarding of new Python developers
-- Clear separation of test methods vs production code. For example, the `test_*.py` files can easily be excluded from distribution.

See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing
 - Less and clearer code (no hidden assumptions)
 
 Disadvantages of this approach:
-- Current developer have to learn the new conventions (files need to be named `test_*.py` and tests methods need to start with `test_`) and pytest
+- Current developer have to learn the new conventions (files need to be named `*_test.py` and tests methods need to start with `test_`) and pytest
 - Tests no longer live in the same file as the code (I would say this is an advantage, but some people may prefer to have them really close together).
 
 In order to migrate the following changes are necessary:
-- Move `_test_xyz` from a category `module` to new file `test_module` (e.g. `test_sets_cat`)
+- Move `_test_xyz` from a category `module` to new file `<module>_test.py` (e.g. `finite_semigroups_test.py`)
 - Rewrite test using pytest (which is straightforward and more or less only amounts to removing all the custom code involving `self_tester`)
-- Create a new test class for the parent class under test (e.g `test_finite_semigroups`)
+- Create a new test class for the parent class under test (e.g `TestFiniteSemigroup`)
 - Create a static method `category_instances()` in this test class returning a list of instances to test.
 
 For the moment, I did this only for two test methods in `sets_cat` to illustrate the process.
 
 The new implementation is as follows:
-- The test class for the category (e.g. `test_sets_cat`) defines generic tests that should pass for every object in that category.
-- For every object in the category there is a test class (e.g. `test_finite_semigroups`) that provides instances to test via the method `category_instances`
-- Running pytest finds the test class `test_finite_semigroups`, then determines the categories of the object and adds all generic test methods for that category to the test class (this happens in `conftest.py`).
+- The test class for the category (e.g. in `sets_cat_test.py`) defines generic tests that should pass for every object in that category. Moreover, the test class may provides instances (objects) to test via the method `category_instances`.

 - Each test method can have the parameter `category_instance` which is bound to the return value of the `category_instances` method.

+As one can see, each general test method is invoked for the three examples.
 
 
 TOOD (as follow-up tickets):
 - Complete migration of tests to pytest
 - After the migration is done, remove invoking the `TestSuite` in the doctests and remove the `TestSuite` class.
 
----
 
-By default, pytest implements the following standard test discovery:
-
-- Search for `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` files (I would stick to the `test` prefix).
-- From those files, collect test items:
-   - Functions or methods with prefix `test`
-   - If the functions are inside of classes, then the class name has to start with `test` as well.

 Disadvantages of this approach:
-- Current developer have to learn the new conventions (files need to be named `*_test.py` and tests methods need to start with `test_`) and pytest
-- Tests no longer live in the same file as the code (I would say this is an advantage, but some people may prefer to have them really close together).

-In order to migrate the following changes are necessary:

-- Rewrite test using pytest (which is straightforward and more or less only amounts to removing all the custom code involving `self_tester`)
