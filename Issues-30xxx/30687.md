`make python3-clean` does not remove `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python3*` - certainly not if  an external `python3` is used.

We do the uninstallation in an `spkg-legacy-uninstall` script.

(We also repair the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` mechanism - it was broken in #29096.)

Critical for Sage 9.2 because it will help avoid puzzling incremental build behavior, which could include corruption of the installed system python if that is writable for the user.

Not really `make python3-clean`, more like `make python3_venv-clean`; see #29708 ("Fix switching between `--with-system-python3` and `--without-system-python3`"). I had hoped to fix it via #29386, but this won't be ready for Sage 9.2.

We can try a hotfix for this issue by adding `build/pkgs/python3/legacy-uninstall`

So the problem with #29096 is that the uninstall script wasn't being run by `sage-spkg`, so the conversion from `SCRIPT.in` to `SCRIPT` didn't do anything useful?

I also don't understand how the use of the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` script compares to its documentation. R and gap, for example, are modern packages. Why do they need legacy uninstall scripts?

Yes, prior to #29096 there was an inconsistency - the file `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-legacy-uninstall` was transformed to the wrapped script (in the temporary build location) but that was never used. Instead, `sage-spkg-uninstall` was directly invoked `spkg-legacy-uninstall`.

I think it is for cleaning out very old installs in long-lived installation trees. 
Given that #29096 has not led to obvious error reports, it does not seem to be an important function.

If I've built Sage with a system Python 3, I'm not sure what `make python3-clean` should do. Should it really remove all Python site libraries? If it does this, it has to somehow let the build system know to rebuild all of those packages.

If you install `python3` from spkg, then `make clean` already works because it goes through DESTDIR staging.

If you use system python3 (venv), then nothing is installed in `/usr/lib/python3.8`... except for stuff installed into `site-packages`, which have their own uninstallation procedures.

It should be a no-op because `python3` is not installed.

while these files are installed by individual  packages, they "belong" to python. 

Also there should be no difference in what happens to the $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python3*  whether python3 is installed by Sage or not. Isn't it true that cleaning a  Sage-installed Python leads to removal of  $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python3* ?

No.  The files that belong to the package, recorded in `SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed` are removed.  It does not remove the installed site-packages.

When you reinstall the python3 spkg, then dependencies cause all python packages to be rebuilt.
