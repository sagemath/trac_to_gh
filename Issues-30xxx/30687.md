`make python3-clean` does not remove `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python3*` - certainly not if  an external `python3` is used.

We do the uninstallation in an `spkg-legacy-uninstall` script.

(We also repair the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` mechanism - it was broken in #29096.)

Critical for Sage 9.2 because it will help avoid puzzling incremental build behavior, which could include corruption of the installed system python if that is writable for the user.

I think it is for cleaning out very old installs in long-lived installation trees. 
Given that #29096 has not led to obvious error reports, it does not seem to be an important function.

If you install `python3` from spkg, then `make clean` already works because it goes through DESTDIR staging.

If you use system python3 (venv), then nothing is installed in `/usr/lib/python3.8`... except for stuff installed into `site-packages`, which have their own uninstallation procedures.

No.  The files that belong to the package, recorded in `SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed` are removed.  It does not remove the installed site-packages.

When you reinstall the python3 spkg, then dependencies cause all python packages to be rebuilt.
