```
`make python3-clean` does not remove `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python3*` - certainly not if  an external `python3` is used.

We do the uninstallation in an `spkg-legacy-uninstall` script.

(We also repair the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` mechanism - it was broken in #29096.)

Critical for Sage 9.2 because it will help avoid puzzling incremental build behavior, which could include corruption of the installed system python if that is writable for the user.

So the problem with #29096 is that the uninstall script wasn't being run by `sage-spkg`, so the conversion from `SCRIPT.in` to `SCRIPT` didn't do anything useful?

I also don't understand how the use of the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` script compares to its documentation. R and gap, for example, are modern packages. Why do they need legacy uninstall scripts?

Yes, prior to #29096 there was an inconsistency - the file `build/pkgs/SPKG/spkg-legacy-uninstall` was transformed to the wrapped script (in the temporary build location) but that was never used. Instead, `sage-spkg-uninstall` was directly invoked `spkg-legacy-uninstall`.

I unfortunately overlooked this in #29096 and so the renaming broke `spkg-legacy-uninstall` for all packages - this script was no longer getting invoked for any package.

> I also don't understand how the use of the `spkg-legacy-uninstall` script compares to its usage. R and gap, for example, are modern packages. Why do they need legacy uninstall scripts?

I think it is for cleaning out very old installs in long-lived installation trees. 
Given that #29096 has not led to obvious error reports, it does not seem to be an important function.

If you install `python3` from spkg, then `make clean` already works because it goes through DESTDIR staging.

If you use system python3 (venv), then nothing is installed in `/usr/lib/python3.8`... except for stuff installed into `site-packages`, which have their own uninstallation procedures.
