Short of running a single-file docbuild (which needs fixing - #30475), there are several options for validating rst files and docstrings:

- https://pypi.org/project/rstcheck/ 
- https://pypi.org/project/doc8/
- https://pypi.org/project/flake8-rst-docstrings
- ​https://pypi.org/project/flake8-docstrings/ (uses ​https://github.com/pycqa/pydocstyle)

Here we add a tox environment using https://pypi.org/project/flake8-rst-docstrings.

Usage:

```
   ./sage -tox -e rst src/sage/geometry/polyhedra
```

We also run it as part of the Lint workflow on GH Actions (see badge).

Continued in the meta ticket: #34157
