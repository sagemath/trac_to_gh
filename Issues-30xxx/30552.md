As suggested in [This is the Trac macro *ticket:29203* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#ticket:29203-macro), this ticket adds `GlobalOptions` to control the display options of matrices. Currently, this only refactors the options to control the maximum number of rows and columns to display. New options will follow in separate tickets.

```
sage: matrix.options
Current options for Matrix
  - max_cols: 49
  - max_rows: 19
sage: matrix.options.max_cols = 6
sage: matrix.options.max_rows = 3
sage: matrix(ZZ, 3, 6)
[0 0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0 0]
sage: matrix(ZZ, 3, 7)
3 x 7 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
```

This also fixes an off-by-one error and deprecates the setters `set_max_rows`/`set_max_cols`.

The new code is placed in `sage.matrix.constructor`, since that is where `matrix`/`Matrix` is defined. The latter is not actually a class, so the `options` are attached via the ``@`matrix_method` decorator.
