}
```
The use of `use_LJCR=True` in `designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design` give rise to few issues.
1. The returned object has type `IncidenceStructure` instead of `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign`
2. A `ValueError` exception can be raised if the parameters searched are not in the database

Example for 2:

```
sage: designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design(100,10,1,use_LJCR=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: no (100, 10, 2) covering design in database
```

In addition to the above, the docstring tests that are meant to test the use of `use_LJCR=True` are not actually testing the LJCR online database.

Depends on #30131

I tried looking for an entry in the LJCR database that gets used by Sage, but I can't find one.
I run the code

```
sage: for v in range(100):
....:     for k in range(v):
....:         D = designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design(v,k,1,use_LJCR=True, existence=True)
....:         if D == 3:
....:             print(v,k)
```
where I changed the `balanced_incomplete_block_design` function to return 3 instead of `True` if the LJCR database was used.

I didn't obtain any results. So I think that the LJCR database is actually never used.

On a side note, to fix the `URLError` I swapped the url to use http instead of https. I don't think there is a security issue in retrieving values for Sage, yet you never know how Sage might get used. Hence, I believe the issue should be fixed at the level of `urllib` (the python library used for the request).
I don't have the knowledge to fix it myself, though.

I'm not sure where the python software I have comes from.
If it can help I have the following output

```
% sage --python

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```

Actually the full traceback when I get the `URLError` is the following:

```

So it seems the issues lies in the python shipped with sage.

Apart from the above, I would like to substitute the parameters of the docstring test as at the moment they are not testing the LJCR database. However, I can't find any set of parameters for which the LJCR database is actually used by sage.

I use macOS which ships with LibreSSL and sort of "redirect" all OpenSSL commands to LibreSSL, i.e.

```
% openssl version
LibreSSL 2.8.3
```

I looked back at the installation guide (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#prerequisites) and it seems that OpenSSL is recommended but not strictly required.
I personally, would like to avoid the need to install OpenSSL systemwide.

If OpenSSL is actually required (as it seems in this case), then the installation guide should be changed.
Moreover, reading both the "Install from Source Code" and "Install from Pre-built Binaries" sections I have another doubt:
the former states that it is not possible to distribute OpenSSL with Sage, yet the latter doesn't mention OpenSSL under the macOS section, so that section would also need to change.

We have had long discussions on OpenSSL, you can check sage-devel...

Well, thanks to Apple for breaking Python on macOS, what can I say.

You can install Homebrew Python3, so it will live in /usr/local, 
or use something like docker to test on unbroken Python, or build Sage's Python
by configuring with `--with-system-python=no` (and then you'd also need to first install Sage's openssl and pyopenssl packages)

Anyhow, just revert the change https->http, so that I can set this ticket to positive review.

Some more suggestions if you care. Otherwise just set back to positive review.

Remove this commented-out print (debugging leftover?)

```
        #print("LJCR with params {}, {}, 1".format(v,k))
```

Remove space before question mark:

```
-            # Is it a BIBD or just a good covering ?
+            # Is it a BIBD or just a good covering?
```

Add space around `//`:

```
-            expected_n_of_blocks = binomial(v, 2)//binomial(k, 2)
+            expected_n_of_blocks = binomial(v, 2) // binomial(k, 2)
```

Use f-strings and lowercase.

```
-                raise EmptySetError("There exists no ({},{},{})-BIBD".format(v, k, lambd))
+                raise EmptySetError(f"there exists no ({v},{k},{lambd})-BIBD")

Bots are happy. Positive review.

Regarding the minor warnings:
- Pycodestyle complains about "multiple statements on one line".
  Those are not from this ticket, so they could be dealt with elsewhere.
- Pyflakes complains about the f-string, maybe it still wants py2 and py3 compatible code.
