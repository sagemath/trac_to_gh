Building Sage with its own Python 3 can easily produce
a Python 3 missing its `_ssl` module.

Python's `_ssl` module is only built if OpenSSL (with headers)
is available, either via the system or via the `openssl` spkg.

The result is reduced functionality:

- it hinders installing pip packages
- it hinders working with Jupyter

Many builds of the python3 spkg without its `_ssl` module
likely result from an oversight.

Could there be a `configure` flag to explicitly require
building python3 without its `_ssl` module?

Without that flag, consider openssl a dependency of python3,
and let the build fail if it's not there.

Even when configuring with `--enable-openssl`,
I think `openssl` may be built after `python3`.

So currently one really has to separate into two steps:

```
$ make openssl
$ make
```

or later have to repair with

```
$ sage -i openssl
$ sage -f python3
```

Yes, this is a problem. We do not have a mechanism to order "optional dependencies".

Looks like this would be easy to patch out.

Building a Python without ssl module is happening on `ubuntu-trusty` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1553902103) in 9.3.beta4

Our configure finds system openssl; system python3 is too old, so python 3.8 is built from source; but apparently it fails to build the ssl module. (This should be investigated!)

The symptom is that `pytest` (a pip package that is a check-only dependency of some standard package) fails to install:

```
[pytest] installing. Log file: /sage/logs/pkgs/pytest.log
  [pytest] error installing, exit status 1. End of log file:
  [pytest]   WARNING: pip is configured with locations that require TLS/SSL, however the ssl module in Python is not available.
  [pytest]   WARNING: Retrying (Retry(total=4, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'SSLError("Can't connect to HTTPS URL because the SSL module is not available.")': /simple/pytest/
```
It is likely that this problem has actually been around for a while and was only masked by the faulty SAGE_CHECK logic fixed in #31020.
