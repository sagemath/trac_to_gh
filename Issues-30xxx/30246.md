Could this just be a documentation issue? Is it documented somewhere what extensions need to be installed in jupyterlab so that sage works?

I was able to get interacts working in jupyterlab 2.2.5 using the following command:
[ipywidgets install instructions](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets#install)

```
./sage --jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@2.0
```

This requires nodejs >= 10 to be installed though. Looks like jupyterlab's extension ecosystem is all based on npm. Grabbing the extension tarball directly, still need node for bundling. (webpack, if I remember; been awhile since I've done anything with node.)

So unless we want to make nodejs an optional->standard package as well, maybe just leave it to the user to install and make a note in the documentation regarding interact functionality? Similar to how imagemagick and ffmpeg are noted in [animated plots](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/animate.html).

I've pushed a branch for review. It adds 4 new optional packages: nodeenv, nodejs, jupyterlab, and jupyterlab_widgets. The last one, jupyterlab_widgets, gets you everything.

I opted to break them up in this way for (1) convenience in packaging them and (2) flexibility in installing them. For example, if you just want the JupyterLab client and don't care about interacts or other extensions or if you don't want JupyterLab but would like nodejs present in your Sage environment for some other purpose. Please let me know if you'd prefer a different structuring.

Shell scripting isn't my forte, so I welcome any feedback regarding coding conventions and best practices!

We can mark the other ticket as solved by this one.

I would use https in the home page url for JupyterLab.

I'm getting the following with this branch (without installing any packages):

This ticket breaks the patchbots (at least the ones i run). It seems due to some modification in `src/bin/sage-env` that tries to cd into a nonexistent `local/share/nodejs` directory. When the patchbots run:

```
./sage --python --version

They get:

I also came across `sage --notebook --help` which had already mentioned jupyterlab and so didn't need updating, but I found that it also mentions an ipython option:

```
--notebook [NOTEBOOK], -n [NOTEBOOK], -notebook [NOTEBOOK]
                      The notebook to run [one of: default, ipython,
                      jupyter, jupyterlab, export]. Default is jupyter
```

Looking at the code in `src/bin/sage-notebook`, this option is currently just an alias for jupyter. Would it be valuable to mention this option in the basic and/or advanced help messages for sage as well?

This works for me on macOS and is looking great overall.

I have added dependencies to make sure that a parallel build works correctly.

Minor booboo : after (successful) installlation, `jupyterlab_widgets` is still marked as not installed:
