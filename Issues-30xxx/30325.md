yes, the C code there is far from "normal", there are various ugly bits such as `static` functions implemented in `.h` files.
E.g. `gcc 8.3` produces a slew of warnings. OK, it's something doable, to fix these.

Do we assume that we have Flint 2.6 or newer? `nmod_mat_charpoly` appeared in Flint 2.6,
and we can either use it, or rename the one in `deformation`
(both ways work, but of course it's better to use one in Flint)
