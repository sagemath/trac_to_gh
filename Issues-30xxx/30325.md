I pushed a modif on my github repo for the debian issue.
For the homebrew one, I fear that the package is using some MPIR internals and cannot work with GMP, though that is just a very vague souvenir.

yes, the C code there is far from "normal", there are various ugly bits such as `static` functions implemented in `.h` files.
E.g. `gcc 8.3` produces a slew of warnings. OK, it's something doable, to fix these.
