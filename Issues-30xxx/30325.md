Is this package still maintained?

a straightforward modification of using GMP in place MPIR seems to work just fine, at least on 64-bit linux. Please review.

Depends on #31525

yes, the C code there is far from "normal", there are various ugly bits such as `static` functions implemented in `.h` files.
E.g. `gcc 8.3` produces a slew of warnings. OK, it's something doable, to fix these.

and we can either use it, or rename the one in `deformation`
