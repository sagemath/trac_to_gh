<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

This is really impressive. With this ticket, `sage -tp src/sage/graphs/` takes 60s less on my (slow) laptop than with 9.2.rc2 only.

As I said for other tickets, it's not easy to check the code due to the chain of tickets. We will certainly have to do some cleaning when all these tickets will be merged.

LGTM.

There is a merge conflict with #30776 or the previous ticket.

Should I take care of it and make it a long chain of dependencies or wait?
