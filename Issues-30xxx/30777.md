This is really impressive. With this ticket, `sage -tp src/sage/graphs/` takes 60s less on my (slow) laptop than with 9.2.rc2 only.

As I said for other tickets, it's not easy to check the code due to the chain of tickets. We will certainly have to do some cleaning when all these tickets will be merged.

LGTM.

There is a merge conflict with #30776 or the previous ticket.

A trivial one, as both are trying to add something in the same line in `c_graph.pxd`.

Should I take care of it and make it a long chain of dependencies or wait?

I pulled in #30776 and fixed the trivial merge conflict (two new definitions in `.pxd` at same place).

It is not clear to me, why both #30776 and #30777 were marked as merge conflict.

#30776 has been merged. I don't think there is a merge conflict anymore.

I think that #30776 and #30777 were both tried to be merged at once and both of them rejected. With #30777 based on #30776 it should be fine (and it really was only the one desclaration in the header at the same location).
