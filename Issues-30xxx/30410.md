This will run tox using `src/tox.ini`.

Entry point for doctesting and linting: See `./sage -tox -l -v` or `(cd src && tox -l -v)`.

Some projects are indeed using tox also for building, but I think I would like to keep it for testing only. At least for now - we can't make too many changes at the same time so that our developer community is not overwhelmed.

`sage -coverage` and `sage -startuptime`, however, should definitely become tox environments.

> (also I don't see any advantages of `sage -tox pycodestyle` over `tox pycodestyle`)

The difference is that `sage -tox` would also work with `src/tox.ini` when called from SAGE_ROOT. (There's another tox.ini in SAGE_ROOT for a different purpose - testing of the sage distribution.)

And it can give a hint to install tox when it is not available.

It should also be possible to add simple forwards in the `tox.ini` at the root folder of the form


```
[testenv:pycodestyle]
whitelist_externals=tox
commands=tox -c {toxinidir}/src/tox.ini -e pycodestyle
```

Then you can simply call `tox -e pycodestyle`.

Yes, I have been debating this with myself actually, but in the end I think it is important to keep src/tox.ini simple and readable -- the portability testing stuff in the root can be overwhelming to developers.

The purpose of this is to make it easy to run the tests on user code -- in the same way  that `sage -t` is often used.

not sure I  understand the errors from `pycodestyle` and  `startuptime` - do I have everything set up right?

Is it possible to do only, say, `pycodestyle` part?

`pycodestyle` output kind of makes sense (except that `unknown option 'description' ignored` thing)

does `startuptime` only work for modules? (e.g. `sage/graphs/`) ?
