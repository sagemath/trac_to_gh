These are general bdwgc problems, but what sucks for us is that they only appear when the garbage collector is linked with `-Bsymbolic-functions`, and I don't see an easy way to detect that.

Instead we may have to reject the system copy of gc if `dpkg-buildflags --get LDFLAGS` includes `Bsymbolic-functions` and if the system version of gc is before 8.0.5 (which should include the upstream fix).
