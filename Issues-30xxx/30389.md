Upgrading Maxima to 5.44.0 (see #30063) leads to the following regression:

```
sage: a = integral(log(cot(x) - 1), x, 0, pi/4); a
1/4*pi*(I*pi + log(2)) - 1/2*pi*log(2) - 1/2*I*dilog(I + 1) + 1/2*I*dilog(-I + 1) + 1/2*I*dilog(1/2*I + 1/2) - 1/2*I*dilog(-1/2*I + 1/2)
```

Whose numerical value is `2.467401100272339*I+0.2721982612879502` while it should be `0.2721982612879502`.

This integral had previously been wrong for a different reason and had been fixed upstream in [https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2501/](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2501/); the doctest was added in #13733.

The bug is doctested and marked as `# known bug` in `src/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py` (once #30063 is merged).

The bug is reported upstream as https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3649/

I found this commit message in the Maxima Git log; the first integral mentioned is exactly the regression in Sage.

```
commit 47a6afd1d4691b83bedd197dea322dfd64f4f0f9
Author: Dan Gildea <dgildea>
Date:   Fri Dec 28 15:50:26 2018 -0500

    add series expansion for expintegral_si and gamma_incomplete

    remove fallback to unevaluated derivative - this was a mistake

    unfortunately 3 integrals from the test suite now fail, due
    to the singularity at li[2](1):
     integrate(log(cot(x) - 1), x, 0, %pi/4);           /* rtest16  524 */
     integrate(log(cos(x)), x, 0, %pi/2);                   /* rtest16  525 */
     integrate((log((2-x)/2)+log(2))/(1-x), x, 0, 1);   /* rtestint 232 */
    marked as expected failures.

    Fixes #3484
```
