(from #30611)

Released Oct 8, 2020. https://igraph.org/

the previous update was in #27597, where we also disabled blas/lapack inteface; perhaps it can make a comeback here.

This ticket also adds package `texttable` version 1.6.3, a dependency of `python_igraph`.

This version of igraph is also in homebrew https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/igraph. I don't think we are currently checking whether graph is a system package or not.

We also need python_igraph (https://igraph.org/python/), right ?

`python-igraph` has new dependencies that need to be added. `pycairo` and `texttable`

We may be able to do without pycairo (which in turns will require cairo either as a spkg or system package, may be it is already required, that need to be checked).

I don't like these sage-python23 -> python3 changes.
I don't see why this python3 is guaranteed to be the correct python.

In fact, no package at the moment uses `python3` to run `setup.py`, while about a dozen
packages use `sage-python23`.
I really think until #30731 is done, we should continue using `sage-python23`.
Sorry I didn't check earlier.

We will switch over in #30371 - and I agree that it is better for uniformity if we don't do this package by package.

> I don't see why this python3 is guaranteed to be the correct python.

It is actually guaranteed by our installation. 
- When there is a suitable system python3.x, then Sage creates a venv over it and installs a `python3` symlink in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` (which is in `$PATH` and not shadowed by what is in front of it), so `python3` works. 
- When there is no suitable system python3.x, then Sage builds one and installs a binary in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`, so `python3` also works.
(Side note: After #22731/#30013, the above is still true, but with `$SAGE_VENV/bin` instead of `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.)
