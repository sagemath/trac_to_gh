my brain is small, and while I know that `./sage -tp --log --all >logs/ptest.log` is more or less the same (I would still need to look up the correct way to pipe stderr) as `make ptest` - I wish I knew something more useful instead.

this is really akin to "who needs makefiles, you can just type the compiler calls by hand" nonsense.

What I'm missing (as it confused me quite a bit) is a remark about the python (and other packages) used by tox and how/if a new virtual environment is created, especially for `src/tox.ini`. "Normally", you have environments like

```
envlist = py{27,34,36}-django{15,16}-{sqlite,mysql}, docs
```

That is, you run your test command in different configurations and new virtual environments; with additional special commands like documentation or linting. Sage's usage of tox is rather non-standard in this regard, so I think its good to point this out.

Concerning the documentation of pycodestyle, I'm not sure if the output of the various tox commands adds much. Instead, maybe stress that `-minimal` needs to pass for a ticket to be merged, while the other configuration is what sage is striving for in the future, so progress in that direction is welcome.
