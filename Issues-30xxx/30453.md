my brain is small, and while I know that `./sage -tp --log --all >logs/ptest.log` is more or less the same (I would still need to look up the correct way to pipe stderr) as `make ptest` - I wish I knew something more useful instead.

Many shell code blocks are indented by 2 spaces,
aren't 4 required by rst / Sphinx?

Typo (a -> an):

Perhaps split some long lines:

What I'm missing (as it confused me quite a bit) is a remark about the python (and other packages) used by tox and how/if a new virtual environment is created, especially for `src/tox.ini`. "Normally", you have environments like

```
envlist = py{27,34,36}-django{15,16}-{sqlite,mysql}, docs
```

That is, you run your test command in different configurations and new virtual environments; with additional special commands like documentation or linting. Sage's usage of tox is rather non-standard in this regard, so I think its good to point this out.

Concerning the documentation of pycodestyle, I'm not sure if the output of the various tox commands adds much. Instead, maybe stress that `-minimal` needs to pass for a ticket to be merged, while the other configuration is what sage is striving for in the future, so progress in that direction is welcome.
