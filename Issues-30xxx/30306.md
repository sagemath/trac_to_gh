We wish to support all combinations of the following scenarios:

1. Running `notebook` installed in `SAGE_LOCAL` from SPKG
2. Running `notebook` installed in the system python, or in some venv unrelated to Sage
3. Running `notebook` on a different host (which has no Sage installation), connecting to the Sage Jupyter kernel (using ssh, or https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-kernel-gateway, or ...)

A. Sage-the-distribution
B. Distribution packaging of Sage (Debian, Conda, ...)
C. Pip-installed sagelib (#30036)

The following data items are relevant:

i. The kernelspec
iii. threejs, jsmol, mathjax data
iiiii. Built Sage documentation

The following installation locations are relevant:

a. data installed with sagelib within the Sage venv, such as `src/sage/ext_data`
b. data installed within `SAGE_LOCAL` as part of Sage-the-distribution 
c. data installed as "resources" associated with the kernelspec, on the host where notebook runs (see `jupyter kernelspec list`)
d. data installed as Jupyter nbextensions on the host where notebook runs (see `jupyter nbextension list`)

Tickets for Sage 9.2:

- #30299 (Minimal fix for broken Jupyter Notebook)
- #26919 (Upgrade to Jupyter Notebook 5.7.10 or 6.1.0 ....)

Tickets for Sage 9.3:

- #30903 Fix broken symlink to documentation in the Sage Jupyter kernelspec

- #31035 Remove mathjax configuration/symlink from jupyter notebook
- #31279 Add package `argon2-cffi` (dependency of Jupyter notebook)
- #31328 Upgrade `ipywidgets` to 7.6.3
- #31278 `widgetsnbextension` should not depend on `notebook`
- #30383 Add `configure --disable-notebook`
- #31620 Document installing sagemath kernel without copying documentation
- #31156 - Doc: Add instructions how to run Sage + Jupyter notebook in WSL, browser in Windows
- #31157 Doc: Add instructions on how to run the SageMath Jupyter kernel in WSL, add as a kernel to Jupyter running natively in Windows (dup: #25850)
