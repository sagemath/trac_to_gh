We also update the list of builds done for the optional and experimental packages, which was lagging behind the list in `tox.yml`.

We also set `debian-bullseye-standard` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1450540177) to `IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=yes` because of:

```
E: Unable to locate package libgiac-dev
