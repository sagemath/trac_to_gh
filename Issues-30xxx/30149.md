I noticed a problem when trying to run the tests for the latest Sage, that the wrong version of `libR.dll` was being loaded, because I have R installed via Sage, but I also have the R package for Cygwin installed.

My path starts with:

```
/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/R/lib:/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib:/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/build/bin:/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/src/bin:/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin
```

so when importing `rpy2` it should link with the `libR.dll` that's in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/lib`.  Normally this has been the case.

But when using the system Python this is not so.  This is because according to the standard [DLL search path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/7d83bc18(v=vs.140)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) the first place it looks is:

> The directory where the executable module for the current process is located.


Well, when running the system Python that's `/usr/bin` where `python3.7m.exe` lives.  However, that's also where the system's `libR.dll` lives.

This is just an example, but it's a broader problem: For any DLL linked to by a compiled Python module, it will always privilege the one in `/usr/bin` over a copy provided by Sage.

What we might have to do is, at least on Cygwin, when creating the venv it should actually copy the Python executable instead of just symlinking to it.  I believe venv has an option for this.

In `build/bin/sage-venv` there are some lines:

```
if os.name == 'nt':
    # default for Windows
    use_symlinks = False
else:
    # default for posix
    # On macOS, definitely need symlinks=True (which matches what we test in build/pkgs/spkg-configure.m4)
    # or it may fail with 'dyld: Library not loaded: @executable_path/../Python3' on macOS.
    use_symlinks = True
```

But this first check is useless because we currently don't support native Windows.  It should say `if sys.platform == 'cygwin'`, or if we really want to be optimistic `if sys.platform in ['win32', 'cygwin']`.

This seems to have partially fixed the problem, but only partially.  Now there's something *really* bizarre happening, which is that if I run `./sage -python` and do `from sage.all import r; r('"abc"')` it loads the correct `libR.dll`.  But if I do just `./sage` and then `r('"abc"')` in the Sage shell, it reverts back to the bad behavior.

This shouldn't be, since in both cases it's still running the same Python interpreter executable.
