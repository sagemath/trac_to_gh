(follow-up from #30194)

... extending `sage.categories.pushout.VectorFunctor`

for example:

```
            sage: M = FreeModule(ZZ, 4, with_basis=None, name='M')
            sage: latex(M)
            M
            sage: from sage.categories.pushout import VectorFunctor, pushout
            sage: M_QQ = pushout(M, QQ)
            sage: latex(M_QQ)
            M \otimes \Bold{Q}
```

Yes, I see a few dozen testsuite failures (`_test_construction`) in `sage.combinat` now.

Yes
