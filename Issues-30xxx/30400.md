I have added the file finite_topological_spaces.py in ~/sage/src/sage/homology. I think this is a correct place to put it because different methods dealing with homotopy types and weak homotopy types will be added in next commits, but the discussion is open and I accept other suggestions in order to put it in the correct place.

The issue is that these sets may print in different orders, and I think it's more or less random.

By the way, it's better to say `if E is None` instead of `if E == None`.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A10):
> *I'm getting some doctest failures. Also, it would be nice to add this to the reference manual. Here are changes to fix some of these:*

Thanks for the suggestions, I have changed the files in order to include the improvements.

> *The issue is that these sets may print in different orders, and I think it's more or less random.*

I see... I think it depends on the implementation of sets in [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath), do I have to impose an specific order for printing or it is not necessary?

Don¬¥t worry, it is a good question. The term 'matrice', used in Kenzo, comes from French and it means matrix (as you noticed). In Kenzo, the type 'matrice' is used for sparse matrices.

    "body": "<a id='comment:35'>Comment 35:</a>\nMy apologies for the delay, I am going to try working on this ticket. Some style comments:\n- Preferred Sage style is to keep lines under 80 characters when possible. One place that violates this is in the docstrings. Don't work too hard to get the doctests under 80 characters, but the paragraphs of text should satisfy this.\n- I don't know if it's officially a Sage style, but it is in general better to not use `assert` statements for error checking, because they can be ignored when Python is run with optimization flags turned on. The [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement) says that `assert` statements should be used for debugging. (I think these statements are currently used throughout the Sage library, and maybe we should start a campaign to eliminate them. In the meantime, we shouldn't add more.)\n- I'm getting doctest failures of the form `cannot import name '__convertarray__' from ...`. I do not have Kenzo installed; I think those doctests should be marked `optional - kenzo`.

<a id='comment:35'>Comment 35:</a>
My apologies for the delay, I am going to try working on this ticket. Some style comments:
- Preferred Sage style is to keep lines under 80 characters when possible. One place that violates this is in the docstrings. Don't work too hard to get the doctests under 80 characters, but the paragraphs of text should satisfy this.
- I don't know if it's officially a Sage style, but it is in general better to not use `assert` statements for error checking, because they can be ignored when Python is run with optimization flags turned on. The [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement) says that `assert` statements should be used for debugging. (I think these statements are currently used throughout the Sage library, and maybe we should start a campaign to eliminate them. In the meantime, we shouldn't add more.)
- I'm getting doctest failures of the form `cannot import name '__convertarray__' from ...`. I do not have Kenzo installed; I think those doctests should be marked `optional - kenzo`. See below for some fixes, although I may have been too aggressive in applying the tags.
- I'm getting other doctest failures from `E = random.sample(X, k)` with a deprecation warning:

```
    DeprecationWarning: Sampling from a set deprecated
    since Python 3.9 and will be removed in a subsequent version.
```
- The documentation isn't building, but I think I've fixed that. See below.

I tried my best to do it, I have shortened the lines that didn't satisfy the rule.

> - I don't know if it's officially a Sage style, but it is in general better to not use `assert` statements for error checking, because they can be ignored when Python is run with optimization flags turned on.

The `assert` statements have been completely changed to conditional statements.

> - I'm getting doctest failures of the form `cannot import name '__convertarray__' from ...`. I do not have Kenzo installed; I think those doctests should be marked `optional - kenzo`. See below for some fixes, although I may have been too aggressive in applying the tags.

The `optional - kenzo` mark has been added to the required lines. Also, some functions have been added directly to `src/sage/interfaces.kenzo.py`.

I have changed "sampling from a set `X`" by "sampling from a `list(X)`" in order to fix these warnings.

In the example

```
    sage: T = FiniteSpace([{0, 3}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {3}]) ; T
    Finite T0 topological space of 4 points with minimal basis
     {0: {3, 0}, 1: {3, 1}, 2: {3, 2}, 3: {3}}
    sage: T.elements()

```
I would have expected `T.elements()` to be `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, so I found the topogeneous matrix confusing. Even more with the following, I expect the elements to be sorted the way I enter them:

```
    sage: T = FiniteSpace([{0, 3}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {3}], elements=[0,1,2,3])                  
    sage: T.elements()                                                                        
    [3, 0, 1, 2]
```
Should they be sorted in some cases? If the sets of elements are likely to be large, I can understand not wanting to sort by default, but if the user supplies a list of elements, shouldn't we use that?

I think the attribute `T.elements()` has no a good name, I think I should change it to `T.topogenous_sorting()` or something like that. If the user want to obtain the set of elements of the space, the attribute `T.underlying_set()` could be the best option.

This only adds to confusion one gets upon looking at what's in `sage/homology/`.
IMHO this needs a restructuring (not on this ticket), maybe introducing something like `sage/topology` with parts such as `spaces`, `homology`, etc

perhaps this ticket, i.e. #30400, can be a start for `sage/topology` ?

I'm working on #31925, and if it's in good enough shape, it can be a dependency for this ticket, and the file here would get added to `sage/topology`. My understanding is that this ticket requires an upgrade to Kenzo anyway, so this one is not immediately ready for merging. Is there a ticket for the new Kenzo?

The Trac query for [tickets whose summary includes "kenzo"](https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~kenzo)
reveals:

- #29617: Support system installations of ECL and fix the kenzo SPKG build

which upgrades from Kenzo 1.1.9 to Kenzo 1.1.10
and udates the "upstream" info to point to

- https://github.com/miguelmarco/kenzo

It got positive review in early April 2021,
and was rebased on 9.4.beta0 in late May 2021.

Other Kenzo sources seem more outdated, mentioning only Kenzo 1.1.7:

- the [homepage](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Kenzo/)
  and former [Kenzo GitHub repo](https://github.com/gheber/kenzo)
  and its [releases page](https://github.com/gheber/kenzo/releases)
  and [wiki](https://github.com/gheber/kenzo/wiki).

Thankfully,

- the [repology info page for Kenzo](https://repology.org/project/kenzo/information)
  points to Miguel Marco's fork, which Sage is using.
