(from #30846)

We remove the duplication of lines like

```
if [ "$1" = '-optional' -o "$1" = "--optional" ]; then
    shift
    exec sage-list-packages optional $@
fi
```
in `src/bin/sage` and `build/bin/sage-site`.

We keep handling of the option `--installed` in `src/bin/sage` in anticipation of #30940 (`src/bin/sage-list-packages`: Make it work if `SAGE_ROOT` is not available).
