Follow-up from #28925.

We modify `clean_stale_files` so that the incremental install logic of sagelib can work even if we want to install namespace packages in addition to sagelib, such as:

- `sage.numerical.backends.coin_backend`. The package `sage.numerical.backends` is turned into a namespace package. It serves as an example of a module in a namespace package that is maintained outside of the sage source tree (here: https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage-numerical-backends-namespace)
