As preparation for #30371, the gitignore file is extended to ignore compiled cython files (e.g. *.so) as well as the virtual environments (e.g. src/.venv). These changes are more or less copied from https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/python,visualstudiocode.

Finally, I've also taken the opportunity to change to comments to a consistent format (simple single line comments).

This vscode configuration does not make sense without #30371. In a normal Sage build, the venv directory is `local/`.

Best to have two separate tickets for two separate issues.

Also, these ones here are not correct because we do have a few *.c and *.cpp files that should not be `.gitignore`d.

```
+# Generated Cython files
+src/sage/**/*.c
+src/sage/**/*.cpp
