So far, `G.edges()` returns a sorted list of edges. So the test `E == F` is simply a lexicographic comparison of lists, omitting the time to extract and sort the list of edges. The reporting time comparison is therefore not completely fair.

Furthermore, since the switch to Python3, we can no longer rely on sorted list of edges (vertices and edge labels may be of different types, leading to an error when trying to sort the list). One objective is to deprecate this behavior.

I think that the only way to speed up the test `G == H`, is to speed up the test `other.has_edge(...)`.

Here, I don't know how to speed up the method without going deep into the backends...

for your code, it could be better to work with immutable graphs.

```
sage: sage: E = [(i, (i+85)%100) for i in range(100)] + [(i, (i+37)%100) for i in range(100)] + [(i, (i+85)%100) for i in range(100)]     
sage: G = Graph([range(100), E], format='vertices_and_edges', loops=False, multiedges=False, immutable=True)                                  
sage: H = G.copy()                                                                                                                  
sage: %timeit G == H                                                                                                                
131 µs ± 1.78 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
sage: sage: G = Graph(loops=False, multiedges=False) 
....: sage: G.add_edges([(i, (i+85)%100) for i in range(100)]) 
....: sage: G.add_edges([(i, (i+37)%100) for i in range(100)]) 
....: sage: G.add_edges([(i, (i+85)%100) for i in range(100)]) 
....: sage: H = G.copy() 
....: sage: %timeit G == H 
....:                                                                                                                               
241 µs ± 8.24 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
```

But of course it would be better to improve the backends to get faster edge iterator, edge membership tests, equality test, etc.

#30645 and #30665 are a good start I would say.

Things are set up in a way, that we can implement an optimized containment check in `CGraph`.

<div id="comment:18" align="right">Comment 18</div>

Things are improving, I think.

IMO what would still improve things here:
- better heuristics for vertex translation to `int`,
- factor out the backends to standard backends and backends with vertices in `range(n)` (we could still have active vertices or not, but all vertices need to be in `range(n)`, if you add a new vertex that is too large, you will get a memory problem, but that is your problem),
- implement specialized versions of `is_subgraph` and `subgraph_given_vertices` for dense graphs over `range(n)` (we need a good name for this graph backend yet), this should be much faster than the current methods

So instead of just `CGraphBackend` we would have `CGraphBackend`, `CGraphVertices` and `CGraphRangeVertices` (not good names yet). `DenseGraphBackend` as we know it would have to inherit from `CGraphBackend` and `CGraphVertices` and `DenseGraphBackendRangeVertices` would have to inherit from `CGraphBackend` and `CGraphRangeVertices`. Likewise for sparse and static sparse.

Does this sound plausible?

Does anyone have good suggestions for a naming scheme?

This is how `DisjointSet` (union-find data structure) is implemented in Sage.

```
def DisjointSet(arg):
cdef class DisjointSet_class(SageObject):
cdef class DisjointSet_of_integers(DisjointSet_class):
cdef class DisjointSet_of_hashables(DisjointSet_class):
```

in the sense that `DisjointSet_of_integers` uses directly the internal representation and `DisjointSet_of_hashables` uses maps from integers in range(n) to the hashable objects and vice versa. See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/sets/disjoint_set.pyx

I don't know if the naming scheme `_of_integers` and `_of_hashables` I chosen at the time is good or not.
