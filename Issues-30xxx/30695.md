Using version 9.2.beta14 of Sage, the p-adic `slice` method fails on exact zeros, for input of j=None or j=infinity (where j is the 'upper-bound' of the slice). 

For example:

```
sage: F=Qp(3)
sage: a=F(0)                                                                                                                                                                       
sage: a.slice(0,None)

I think the code would be easier to read if you put the `if j is infinity` up, i.e.,

```
        if j is None or j is infinity:
            j = self.precision_absolute()

    "body": "<a id='comment:7'></a>\nHi Julian, thanks! \n\nThe reason why I put those lines down there, was my thinking that if k<=0, the function should (in all cases) reach the part of the code that makes it return `ValueError`. I wasn't sure about it though. Perhaps if j is infinity or None, and self.precision_absolute is infinity, we want to return zero regardless of whether or not k is legal. \n\nHowever, if we want to return `ValueError` for k<=0, we can either preserve the current location of the lines, or change the order in which the arguments are checked, like so: \n\n```\n        if k is None:\n            k = 1\n        if k<=0:\n            raise ValueError(\"slice step must be positive\")\n        if i is None:\n            i = self.valuation()\n        if j is None or j is infinity:\n            j = self.precision_absolute()\n            if j is infinity:\n                return self.parent()(0)\n\n        ...\n```\nWhat would you suggest? \n",

Hi Julian, thanks! 

The reason why I put those lines down there, was my thinking that if k<=0, the function should (in all cases) reach the part of the code that makes it return `ValueError`. I wasn't sure about it though. Perhaps if j is infinity or None, and self.precision_absolute is infinity, we want to return zero regardless of whether or not k is legal. 

However, if we want to return `ValueError` for k<=0, we can either preserve the current location of the lines, or change the order in which the arguments are checked, like so: 

```
        if k is None:
            k = 1
        if k<=0:
            raise ValueError("slice step must be positive")
        if i is None:
            i = self.valuation()
        if j is None or j is infinity:
            j = self.precision_absolute()
            if j is infinity:
                return self.parent()(0)

        ...
```
What would you suggest?

I think that the `k` argument is likely never used, since it's not very useful.  Certainly `k <= 0` doesn't make sense.  I'd be fine with just raising a `NotImplementedError` if the user passes in anything other than `k=1`.

Currently, the slice method that's implemented in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/padics/local_generic_element.pyx receives the arguments: `self`, `i`, `j`, `k = 1`, `lift_mode='simple'`, whereas the slice method implemented in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/rings/padics/relaxed_template.pxi receives: `self`, `start=None`, `stop=None`, `bound=False`.\\

To avoid mistakes and problems, I think perhaps the relaxed implementation should override the general one, right? But this requires that the signature of those methods become identical. What do you think?\\
Thanks.

I think that it's a good thing to fix rapidly the bug you reported and leave the discussion of uniformizing the behaviour of `slice` for another ticket. So I give a positive review to the ticket.
