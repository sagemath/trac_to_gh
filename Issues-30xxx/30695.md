Using version 9.2.beta14 of Sage, the p-adic `slice` method fails on exact zeros, for input of j=None or j=infinity (where j is the 'upper-bound' of the slice). 

For example:

```
sage: F=Qp(3)
sage: a=F(0)                                                                                                                                                                       
sage: a.slice(0,None)

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
I think the code would be easier to read if you put the `if j is infinity` up, i.e.,

```
        if j is None or j is infinity:
            j = self.precision_absolute()
            if j is infinity:
                ...
```

otherwise I found it a bit confusing.

Hi Julian, thanks! 

The reason why I put those lines down there, was my thinking that if k<=0, the function should (in all cases) reach the part of the code that makes it return `ValueError`. I wasn't sure about it though. Perhaps if j is infinity or None, and self.precision_absolute is infinity, we want to return zero regardless of whether or not k is legal. 

However, if we want to return `ValueError` for k<=0, we can either preserve the current location of the lines, or change the order in which the arguments are checked, like so: 

```
        if k is None:
            k = 1
        if k<=0:
            raise ValueError("slice step must be positive")
        if i is None:
            i = self.valuation()
        if j is None or j is infinity:
            j = self.precision_absolute()
            if j is infinity:
                return self.parent()(0)

        ...
```
What would you suggest?

Sorry to set this back to needs work but I think that this is wrong now for lazy p-adics. They report `+Infinity` for `precision_absolute()` even if they are non-zero.

The old code threw an error, now it's silently wrong returning 0.
