Homebrew is the most popular "missing package manager" for macOS, and I really do not understand why you are sceptical about. Sage on x86_64 Homebrew mostly works, with many, many packages used rather than built from source. (Besides, do you have any idea how much effort went into this, supporting Sage using Homebrew packages? No, well, you many be "sceptical" about it, but it does work.)

Macports doesn't work with Sage, and Fink is mostly dead, IMHO

Homebrew surely does have ready Apple M1 GMP, cf. 
https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gmp#default

Maintaining the Sage status quo - porting patches from Hombrew back to Sage, etc, it's such a waste of time if you ask me.

I guess bad experiences in the past with the other "managers" we will not name again - and, separately, liking to maintain ability for Mac users to download source and just type `make`.  But I will give it a try.

However, as to the main topic of this ticket, is this simply "use Homebrew/Rosetta" or is there presumably some other testing I can do to help?

<div id="comment:13" align="right">comment:13</div>

Making sage into a homebrew package is on the wishlist. (I don't think anyone is doing anything about it.) I think further discussion of this should go to #29395.

I played with creating Homebrew formulae a while ago, see https://github.com/sagemath/homebrew-science/commits/master

It's not that hard - and in fact e.g. arb and flint made it into mainline Homebrew since I touched this last time. It's more annoying that we sometimes need a variation of what's in Homebrew, e.g. it ships single-threaded Pari, but we need multi-threaded (as that's what giac requires).

no, no Rosetta, just pure, unfiltered, Homebrew.
(Rosetta is an x86_64 emulator, as you might recall)

Give it a try please, I'd like to know how far we are there.

Wish I hadn't destroyed my working install :( but I think I have a few old binaries I can use if under duress.  That's why I waited for the semester to finish!

I'll post on devel if I achieve anything interesting.  One note in prereqs: With respect to BLAS (mentioned in one of the threads) I get

```
==> Pouring openblas--0.3.15_1.big_sur.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
openblas is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides BLAS in Accelerate.framework.

For compilers to find openblas you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openblas/include"

For pkg-config to find openblas you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig"

==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/openblas/0.3.15_1: 23 files, 120MB
```
so hopefully accelerate will continue to work here for Sage as an option.

it's not an option if you want to use more external Homebrew packages, which depend on (open)blas.
Anyhow, sourcing `.homebrew-build-env` should take care of setting everything, including Homebrew's OpenBLAS,
to be used by Sage.

I do not know if this can be related:

After
`sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib lib`
in `/usr/local` (see https://github.com/apaffenholz/homebrew-polymake/issues/3)
this works

`brew install apaffenholz/polymake/polymake`

(suggested by `./configure`).

I have restarted the whole process, with the fix #33191.

`iml` was still failing, so I have done

`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.2 make`

as indicated in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/6LldEeJu3ZA/m/BpNMpD-yAAAJ and there is no error about installing packages, but the building fails.  Logs attached as soon as I find how to do it.

> If you have a chance, please test if #33195 fixes iml (without setting `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`)

I have cloned the git repository.

Could you please tell me how to apply #33195?

Just in case, things I think can be taken into account (besides #33191 and #33195):
1. Install everything `./configure` (or `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url`) recommends with `brew install [...]`.
   * Be aware of the 2 versions of `homebrew`: the new `arm64` should be used.
   * In particular, to install `polymake` do

   ```
   cd /usr/local
   sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib lib
   brew install apaffenholz/polymake/polymake
   ```
   (see https://github.com/apaffenholz/homebrew-polymake/issues/3)
   * Do not forget `source .homebrew-build-env` afterwards.
2. Before `make`, do:

   ```
   eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/bin:$PATH"
   export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib -L/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib"
   export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/include -I/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/include"
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig"
   ```
   (recommended by `brew`, but can be overlooked; perhaps to be put in `.homebrew-build-env`?)
3. `export MAKE="make -j16"` works fine on Apple M1 (all 8 cores at 100% most of the time).
