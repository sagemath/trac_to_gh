Samll remarks.

Avoid having only TESTS:: in any non-underscored method, because the doc will be empty.

This

```
w.reduced_word()==[]
```

```
+    Lists all words
```
should be

```
+    List all words
```

```
+    while len(queue) > 0:
```
could be

```
while queue:

Looks good. Thank you for this addition.

Some additional comments to Frédéric's:

`fully_commutative_stable_grothendieck.py` is missing the file header information (module-level docstring, copyright, etc.).

You could have `DecreasingHeckeFactorization` inherit from `SageObject` (maybe `tuple`). Also, the inequality probably won't work (perhaps even some of the other inequalities). Using the `_richcmp_` (there is a decorator to add this) would simplify this.

In the `__repr__`, why do you do the `list` cast here: `repr(list(factor))[1:-1]`?

Do you really expect this:

```
            if not isinstance(parent, FullyCommutativeStableGrothendieckCrystal):
                raise ValueError("parent should be an instance of FullyCommutativeStableGrothendieckCrystal")
```
It seems like it would be mostly useless.

It would be good to avoid going through the coercion framework and element constructor and just directly create the element:

```diff
-self.parent()(s)
+P = self.parent()
+P.element_class(P, s)
```
This is good for speed.

Error messages should start with a lowercase:

```diff
-raise ValueError("Each nonempty factor should be a strictly decreasing sequence")
+raise ValueError("each nonempty factor should be a strictly decreasing sequence")
```
This is a Python convention that we try to follow.

You don't need the list here (I think it is actually slightly slower):

```diff
-m = max([cell[0] for cell in cells])+1
+m = max(cell[0] for cell in cells) + 1
```
(and in similar other places).

```diff
-for i in range(m)[::-1]:
+for i in range(m-1,-1,-1):
```

I believe you can do this:

```
-if p not in Permutations(avoiding=[3,2,1]):
+if p.has_pattern([3,2,1]):
```
to avoid the transient parent (and some extra unnecessary containment checks).

```diff
-if m == None or (len(_jumps(w))<=m-1):
+if m is None or len(_jumps(w)) <= m-1:
```

I think it would be good to avoid creating the tableau and then its conjugate in `_is_valid_column_word`:

```python
            T = Tableau(L)
            return T.conjugate().is_semistandard()
```
I would just go through and check everything directly in `L`.

Thanks a lot for looking through the code, Travis. Appreciate the suggestions on syntax, speedups, SageMath-specific infrastructure, etc.

Thank you for the suggestions. I used the following guide for `__richcmp__`, do correct me if the syntax does not look right:
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/structure/sage/structure/richcmp.html

> In the `__repr__`, why do you do the `list` cast here: `repr(list(factor))[1:-1]`?

It was to have the `__repr__` print
`()(2, 1)(2)()(2)`
rather than 
`()(2, 1)(2,)()(2,)`
for factors with single values. That behavior has been changed now. I'm maintaining the list casting for the `_latex_` method though as it looks prettier. =)

That is a good point; I forgot about the singletons. For the `__repr__` it would make sense to do it like how you had before. Also, since `DecreasingHeckeFactorization` now inherits from `SageObject`, you should rename `__repr__` -> `_repr_`.

I have a few more additional comments:

```diff
-return tuple(len(l) for l in self.value)[::-1]
+return tuple([len(l) for l in reversed(self.value)])
```

Yes, having the list here is strangely faster.

```diff
-if len(factor)>0:
+if factor:
```

Instead of using both `Partition, Partitions`, you can just use the global parent of all partitions `_Partitions`. Also, I thought `SkewPartition` would parse its inputs into a pair of partitions?

This is strange to me:

```
class Element(DecreasingHeckeFactorization, ElementWrapper):
```
Why inherit from both? Why not just wrap the `DecreasingHeckeFactorization` or inherit from `Element` instead of `ElementWrapper` since I believe the wrapping is basically done by `DecreasingHeckeFactorization`.

I've added a test in the `__init__` for `DecreasingHeckeFactorization`.

> Instead of using both `Partition, Partitions`, you can just use the global parent of all partitions `_Partitions`. Also, I thought `SkewPartition` would parse its inputs into a pair of partitions?

Both remarks make sense. The code looks better now.

> Why inherit from both? Why not just wrap the `DecreasingHeckeFactorization` or inherit from `Element` instead of `ElementWrapper` since I believe the wrapping is basically done by `DecreasingHeckeFactorization`.

The code was more or less adopted from `affine_factorization.py` in the `combinat/crystal` folder. The original intention is to inherit the methods (eg. `weight`) that come with `DecreasingHeckeFactorization` while having access to `parent` from `ElementWrapper`.

I am not so familiar with the difference between `ElementWrapper` and `Element`, but trying
for example

```
class Element(ElementWrapper):
    def __init__()
        # Do something to validate and process t into 
        # an instance of DecreasingHeckeFactorization u
        ElementWrapper.__init__(self, parent, u)
```

and making minor changes in `e`, `f`, `bracketing` in the same class somehow gives the following unexpected behavior for `weight`:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(3+1)
sage: w = S.from_reduced_word([1, 3, 2])
sage: B = crystals.FullyCommutativeStableGrothendieck(w, 3, 2)
sage: h = B([[3, 1], [3], [3, 2]]); h
(3, 1)(3)(3, 2)
sage: h.weight()
(0, -1, 0) # expected (2, 1, 2)
```

Some little nitpicks with style (it wouldn't stop a positive review, but it is good to follow):

```diff
-    k, D = max(w), {}
+    k = max(w)
+    D = {}
```

```diff
-if all(len(L[i])>=len(L[i+1]) for i in range(len(L)-1)):
+if all(len(L[i]) >= len(L[i+1]) for i in range(len(L)-1)):
```

```diff
-if p==r and q!=p and abs(p-q)==1:
+if p == r and q != p and abs(p-q) == 1:
```

```diff
-t = _apply_relations(v,position,move)
+t = _apply_relations(v, position, move)
```
and similar.

More micro-optimizations: For `_applicable_relations`, I would do:

```python
    def _applicable_relations(word):
        """
        Return all positions where a relation can be applied on ``word``
        along with the type of relation.
        """
        L = []
        for i in range(len(word)-2):
            p, q, r = word[i:(i+2)+1]
            if abs(p-q) > 1:
                L += [[i,"pq=qp"]]
            elif abs(p-q) == 1:
                if p == r:  # p != q by the abs test
                    L += [[i,"pqp=qpq"]]
            elif r != p:  # We must have p == q
                L += [[i,"ppq=pqq"]]
            if q == r and r != p:
                L += [[i,"pqq=ppq"]]
        if abs(word[-2]-word[-1]) > 1:
           L += [[len(word)-2,"pq=qp"]]
        return L
```
The first is removing the unless if statements and pulling the last case outside of the loop. The second is removing redundant checks for the different relations.

I think this can be simplified:

```diff
-w[J[i]:J[i+1]][::-1]
+w[J[i+1]-1:J[i]-1:-1]
```

In `_apply_relations()`, do you need those checks? They are good for when debugging, but the first index errors will be thrown naturally by Python. The other errors checking the relations apply also feel more for debugging than a practical-use.

Your doc is not building because you need to make this change:

```diff
-Remove all bracketed letters between `i`th and `(i+1)`th entry.
+Remove all bracketed letters between `i`-th and `(i+1)`-th entry.
```

You're right that they were there mainly for debugging. I've removed the error handling.

Sorry for the slow response. I could not compile Sage for a while due to Xcode12. 

We need this for the insertion algorithm implemented in #30460 unless the insertion takes as input crystal elements rather than decreasing factorizations.

I don't see why the insertion could not take the crystal elements. So it still feels a little over-engineered, but it is good enough for now as the element class hierarchy doesn't have any duplication.
