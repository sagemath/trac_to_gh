<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
The `None` in the error comes from the generic implementation of `_richcmp_` in `sage.categories.morphism` which performs a computation like this

```
sage: L.gen(0)._lmul_(K.gen(0)) is None
True
```

which looks like `_lmul_` is not implemented. It seems that the implementation of the `_richcmp_` method assumes that the result is

```
sage: L.gen(0) * K.gen(0)
b^3 + O(b^43)
```

so treating `None` as zero here will not correctly resolve this problem.

Another issue with the implementation of `_richcmp_` is that the `<ModuleElement>e`, on which `_lmul_` is called, might be zero if the last generator is 0. For example in this case:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: R.<x,y> = K['x,y'].quotient('y')
sage: id = R.Hom(R).identity()
sage: f = R.hom(R.gens(), R, base_map=K.hom([-a], K))
sage: f == id  # should be False
True
```
As `e=y` is zero, also `y * a` is zero, so that comparing the images `f(y * a)` and `id(y * a)` is not meaningful.
(Currently, this example fails because `_lmul_` returns `None`, though, and therefore also fails for the quotient by `x`.)

So at least the implementation should pick a module element `e` that is non-zero, but I am not sure if that is already a sufficient condition for checking equality.

With the patch from #28617 it no longer raises an error, but the answer is wrong:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
....: K = Qp(19)
....: L.<b> = K.extension(x^2 - 19)
....: a = L.hom([b], codomain=L)
....: id = L.Hom(L).identity()
....: a == id
False
```
The result should be `True`.

This is funny.  The output of `L(K.gen(0))` is correct (since `19 = b^2` in `L`), but the output of `a(K.gen(0))` has a wrong term `18*b^40`...
Same for `a(b^2)` (but not for `a(b)`):

```
sage: b
b + O(b^41)
sage: a(b)
b + O(b^41)
sage: b^2
b^2 + O(b^42)
sage: a(b^2)
b^2 + 18*b^40 + O(b^42)
```

This looks suspicious (the term `18*19^20` should probably not be there):

```
sage: c = b^2
sage: c._polynomial_list()
[19 + 18*19^20 + O(19^21)]
```
And this:

```
sage: f, k = c._ntl_rep_abs(); f
[676619522235827247480400837]
sage: K(ZZ(f[0]))
19 + 18*19^20 + O(19^21)
```

Relevant input for the above example:

```
sage: K = Qp(19)
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(x^2 - 19)
sage: c = b^2
sage: f, k = c._ntl_rep_abs(); f

sage: K(ZZ(f[0]))
19 + 18*19^20 + O(19^21)
```
Maybe David Roe (CC) can say something about this?
