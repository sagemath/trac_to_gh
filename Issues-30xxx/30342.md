Trying to build the sample article in the package is a good place.  See [the upstream readme for instructions](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetex).

I followed the compile instructions and it when well. The dvi file sagetex.dvi is properly generated and displayed.

However, instead of file `sagetex.sage`, I have `sagetex.sagetex.sage`. So instead of running `sage sagetex.sage`, I used `sage  sagetex.sagetex.sage`. I also have files `sagetex.sagetex.sage.py`, `sagetex.sagetex.scmd`, `sagetex.sagetex.sout`.

this is normal, e.g. for the example.tex one gets

```
example.aux              example.out              example.sagetex.sage     example.sagetex.scmd     example.tex

and this used to be the case for several previous versions. The file extension of these temporary files is always `.sagetex.*`.
