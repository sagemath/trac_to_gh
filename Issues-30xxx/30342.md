this is normal, e.g. for the example.tex one gets

```
example.aux              example.out              example.sagetex.sage     example.sagetex.scmd     example.tex              
example.log              example.pdf              example.sagetex.sage.py  example.sagetex.sout 
```
and this used to be the case for several previous versions. The file extension of these temporary files is always `.sagetex.*`.
