See #30189.

The current catalog only provides spheres of dimension two. A comprehensive and faster version will be added here.

Features:

- spherical and stereographic coordinates
- orientation
- radius and barycenter can be stated
- link to minimal triangulation in `homology` module
- initialized embedding such that extrinsic quantities can be derived

Follow-Ups:

- make `S^1`, `S^3` and `S^7` parallelizable
- Hopf coordinates on `S^3`
- link to Lie group structure on `S^1` and `S^3`

Establishing the stereographic projection in more than 3 dimensions is very demanding, even if you know the inverse. I know that you can speed these things up a little by turning off checking and choosing a suitable simplification. But do you know more workarounds?

I also suspect that the Jacobian takes a long time.

A very good reference for the sphere in any dimension is Chapter 18 *The sphere for its own sake* in Marcel Berger: *Geometry*, vol. II, Universitext. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1987.

On general grounds, I don't think we should depart from Wikipedia conventions without a good reason. Moreover, I think it is standard convention to have the periodic coordinate on *S<sup>n</sup>* to be the last one (as in *(theta, phi)* for *S<sup>2</sup>*), not the first one.

We have to deviate from the Wikipedia convention anyway.

This is simply because the slit we take out for spherical coordinates should meet the poles. Currently, the north/south pole is encoded in the last coordinate. We can shift it to the first, and then we can recover the conventions in Wikipedia for spherical coordinates. But that would be another convention we break, namely for the stereographic projection.

Some first few remarks:

- the reference to Berger should be *Geometry II*, not *Geometry I*
- the LaTeX formula in the docstring of `spherical_coordinates` is not correct; in particular, one should have x_n = cos phi_1, not x_n = cos phi_n
- could one have an option for the periodic coordinate phi_n to range in [0, 2*pi] instead of [-pi, pi]? Both conventions exist in the literature. What should be the default? (I would vote for [0, 2*pi])
- for S<sup>3</sup>, could we have customized spher. coordinate names (chi, theta, phi) (I think this is pretty standard for S<sup>3</sup>), instead of (phi_1, phi_2, phi_3)?

I agree. However, I would prefer that the special cases `S^1`, `S^3`, `S^7` are dedicated to a follow up ticket. This ticket already covers all necessary functionalities of general spheres.
