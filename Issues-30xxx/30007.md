Regular partition tuples are common in enumerating bases of infinite dimensional vector spaces coming from representation theory.

This ticket implements that. If one passes to PartitionTuples both a level and a tuple as regular value (instead of just a number) it returns a class "VectorRegularPartitionTuples"

I agree, originally I was trying to touch as little as possible existing code. 

The main issue that drove me to write a separate class is the level 1 case: partition tuples of level 1 return Partitions. This breaks code like VertexAlgebras that rely on having a PartitionTuple. By including this functionality in the existing code and passing a parameter regular as a tuple of length 1, the natural thing to do would be to return a RegularPartition. 

If that is the case I'll need to refactor on vertex algebras to import RegularPartitionTuples_level directly. But I wanted to express here my preference that Partition tuples of level 1 should be Partition Tuples and not Partitions. It makes unnecessarily harder to write generic code that works with partition tuples of a fixed level to try the level 1 case differently. 

On the other hand changing this behaviour could break existing code, hence my choice to add a small separate class.

This is not quite right. Perhaps this:

```diff
     - ``regular`` -- a positive integer or a tuple of non-negative
       integers; if an integer, the highest multiplicity an entry may
-      have in a component plus `1`.
+      have in a component plus `1`
 
     If a level `k` is specified and ``regular`` is a tuple of integers
     `\ell_1, \ldots, \ell_k`, then this specifies partition tuples `\mu`
-    such that `\mu_i` is `\ell_i`-regular. If ``regular`` is an integer
-    `\ell`, then we set `\ell_i = \ell` for all `i`, with `0`
-    representing `\infty`-regular (equivalently, partitions without
-    restrictions)
+    such that `\mu_i` is `\ell_i`-regular, where `0` here
+    represents `\infty`-regular partitions (equivalently, partitions
+    without restrictions). If ``regular`` is an integer `\ell`, then
+    we set `\ell_i = \ell` for all `i`.
```
