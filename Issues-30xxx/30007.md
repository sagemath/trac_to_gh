CC:  @tscrim @egourgoulhon

#22760 added support for `__matmul__` in the coercion model.

We should start using it.

First step: Review the semantics of this operator in major Python software for matrix and tensor computation (NumPy, Numba, TensorFlow, PyTorch, ...) so that we do not paint ourselves into a corner.

Follow-up tickets:
- #32212 `sage.geometry.hyperbolic_space`

I think in most cases we *don't* need it. In a matrix algebra, it's pretty clear that multiplication means matrix multiplication; not Hadamard product.

The first place I'd see a possible application is for self-maps of a ring, where one may want to consider both composition and point-wise products.
