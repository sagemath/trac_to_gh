Regular partition tuples are common in enumerating bases of infinite dimensional vector spaces coming from representation theory. It is often useful to have different \ell values for different components. For example. For example, the basis for the Fock space of two free Bosons and three free Fermions would have a basis parametrized for partition tuples of level 5 where only three components would need to be 2-regular and 2 components would not need to be regular. This ticket implements that. If one passes to PartitionTuples both a level and a tuple as regular value (instead of just a number) it returns a class "VectorRegularPartitionTuples"

I agree, originally I was trying to touch as little as possible existing code. 

The main issue that drove me to write a separate class is the level 1 case: partition tuples of level 1 return Partitions. This breaks code like VertexAlgebras that rely on having a PartitionTuple. By including this functionality in the existing code and passing a parameter regular as a tuple of length 1, the natural thing to do would be to return a RegularPartition. 

If that is the case I'll need to refactor on vertex algebras to import RegularPartitionTuples_level directly. But I wanted to express here my preference that Partition tuples of level 1 should be Partition Tuples and not Partitions. It makes unnecessarily harder to write generic code that works with partition tuples of a fixed level to try the level 1 case differently. 

On the other hand changing this behaviour could break existing code, hence my choice to add a small separate class.

I made some reviewer changes. If my changes are good, then you can set a positive review.

This is not quite right. Perhaps this:

```diff
     - ``regular`` -- a positive integer or a tuple of non-negative
       integers; if an integer, the highest multiplicity an entry may
-      have in a component plus `1`.
+      have in a component plus `1`
 
     If a level `k` is specified and ``regular`` is a tuple of integers
     `\ell_1, \ldots, \ell_k`, then this specifies partition tuples `\mu`
-    such that `\mu_i` is `\ell_i`-regular. If ``regular`` is an integer
-    `\ell`, then we set `\ell_i = \ell` for all `i`, with `0`
-    representing `\infty`-regular (equivalently, partitions without
-    restrictions)
+    such that `\mu_i` is `\ell_i`-regular, where `0` here
+    represents `\infty`-regular partitions (equivalently, partitions
+    without restrictions). If ``regular`` is an integer `\ell`, then
+    we set `\ell_i = \ell` for all `i`.
```
(Note also the periods.)
