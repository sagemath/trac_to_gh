(from #29039)

Make the build more incremental: On installation of **sage-conf** (the version from `pkgs/sage-conf_pypi`), only run `configure` but do not install anything; rather, a Python entry point can be used by Python packages such as `sagemath-standard` to install packages if present.



Depends on #29039
