```
also `scipy` fails with the same error.

`r` system package is not used because prereq `curl` is not accepted:

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG curl...
checking for curl 7.22... /usr/bin/curl
checking for gawk... (cached) gawk
checking for curl-config... /usr/bin/curl-config
checking for the version of libcurl... 7.71.1
checking for libcurl >= version 7.22... yes
checking whether libcurl is usable... no
checking whether programs linking to libcurl can be executed... no
configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG curl
```

and then building `r` also fails:

```
