Several scripts in src/bin execute with bash unnecessarily, for example:

```
$ cat src/bin/sage-python 
#!/usr/bin/env bash
sage -python "$@"
```

That can be trivially changed to `/bin/sh` to speed up execution on systems where `/bin/sh` is a faster (non-bash) shell. Many other scripts in `src/bin` are similarly easy, as we have somehow avoided the bash test syntax in most places.

To my surprise, almost all shell script in sage is already (mostly) POSIX compatible after 15+ years of churn. Empirically we seem to be able to write the stuff.

My motivation for this is twofold:

1. Bash is not a standard language. We don't depend on a particular version of bash, so you get whatever version happens to be installed. The available features change between major versions of bash, so if you write a script using something specific to bash-4.x, it won't run on a machine with bash-3.x, and at best you get an error.
2. Many other shells are much faster than bash. For anyone interested in the startup time of sage, we're wasting precious seconds launching the world's most monstrous shell to call one-liners (that are already POSIX compatible) repeatedly. Changing it is a free lunch.

Dash on debian suffices to test these standalone scripts, but not the build system. Debian disables the POSIX lineno support in dash,

  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=842242

to purposely cripple it during `./configure`. The intended end result is that autoconf decides that `/bin/sh` is broken and uses bash to run `./configure` and thus `make`, since `make` runs with `SHELL` set to whatever `./configure` used.

I, at least, will probably notice if the build system is ever broken, but it would be nice to have it automated anyway. Dash on arch/Gentoo should work normally, and eventually we should have an OpenBSD system too.
