Several scripts in src/bin execute with bash unnecessarily, for example:

```
$ cat src/bin/sage-python 
#!/usr/bin/env bash
sage -python "$@"
```

That can be trivially changed to `/bin/sh` to speed up execution on systems where `/bin/sh` is a faster (non-bash) shell. Many other scripts in `src/bin` are similarly easy, as we have somehow avoided the bash test syntax in most places.

+That can be trivially changed to \`/bin/sh\` to speed up execution on systems where \`/bin/sh\` is a faster (non-bash) shell. Many other scripts in \`src/bin\` are similarly easy, as we have somehow avoided the bash test syntax in most places.

Dash on debian suffices to test these standalone scripts, but not the build system. Debian disables the POSIX lineno support in dash,

  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=842242

to purposely cripple it during `./configure`. The intended end result is that autoconf decides that `/bin/sh` is broken and uses bash to run `./configure` and thus `make`, since `make` runs with `SHELL` set to whatever `./configure` used.

I, at least, will probably notice if the build system is ever broken, but it would be nice to have it automated anyway. Dash on arch/Gentoo should work normally, and eventually we should have an OpenBSD system too.
