Seen in this ask.sagemapt [question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/53947/problem-with-factor-and-imag/), discussed in [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/WSZ55IRWeiI) :

Sage seems to assume that a not otherwise specified symbolic variable is real :

```
sage: var("z")
z
sage: real(z).simplify()
z
sage: imag(z).simplify()
0
sage: with assuming(z,"complex"): real(z).simplify()
realpart(z)
sage: with assuming(z,"complex"): imag(z).simplify()
imagpart(z)
```

As corollaries :

```
sage: var("a, b")
(a, b)
sage: (a*imag(z) + b*imag(z)).factor()
0
sage: (a*z + b*z).factor().imag_part()
imag_part(z)*real_part(a) + imag_part(z)*real_part(b) + imag_part(a)*real_part(z) + imag_part(b)*real_part(z)
sage: (a*z + b*z).factor().imag_part().factor()
0
sage: (a*z + b*z).factor().imag_part().simplify()
0
```

but :

```
sage: with assuming(z,"complex"): (a*z + b*z).factor().imag_part().factor()
(a + b)*imagpart(z)
sage: with assuming(z,"complex"): (a*z + b*z).factor().imag_part().simplify()
a*imagpart(z) + b*imagpart(z)
```

`Maxima` has the same problem : in Sage's `maxima` :

```
sage: %%maxima
....: domain;
....: imagpart(z);
....: imagpart(ratsimp(z));
....: imagpart(factor(z));
....: 
....: 
complex
0
0
0
```

but :

```
sage: %%maxima
....: declare(z,complex);
....: imagpart(z);
....: imagpart(ratsimp(z));
....: imagpart(factor(z));
....: 
....: 
done
'imagpart(z)
'imagpart(z)
'imagpart(z)
```

Filing this as `blocker`, because this problem may lead to Sage *silently* returning mathematical nonsense...

De facto this can't be a blocker if noone is enough invested to work on it. Probably should be fixed on the maxima side first, too.

The maxima developers deny that it is a bug, and I agree with them, because the maxima documentation makes it clear that merely setting `domain:complex` will not make individual variables default to being complex.

However, I tried this a couple of months ago (just by making a minor modification to `SR.symbol`) and got lots of doctest failures. The two main problems were: 

1. Maxima seems to give different (much more complicated) answers for some definite integrals when the integration variable is declared to be complex. 
2. There were also a lot of failures in `manifolds`, so perhaps that code is assuming that the variables are real.

The problem has been around a long time, and I don't think this can be fixed in time for 9.3.  We should try to do something for 9.4, but I think it will require serious work.

Maybe this ticket should be closed as a duplicate of #6862.

That's to be expected. Complex path integrals are generally path-dependent, so just specifying the end points of the path doesn't tell the whole story. Much of the integration machinery will normally be assuming real variables. This is one reason to *not* assume complex variables by default.

The main problem found on #6862 is the present incompatibility between pynac's and maxima's default. With this information, perhaps it would be worth seeing how bad inserting a default `assume(<var>,"real")` so that pynac at least agrees with maxima. If that leads to significantly less doctests, perhaps that's a preferable direction to resolve the mismatch.
