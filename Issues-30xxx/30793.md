Seen in this ask.sagemapt [question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/53947/problem-with-factor-and-imag/), discussed in [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/WSZ55IRWeiI) :

Sage seems to assume that a not otherwise specified symbolic variable is real :

```
sage: var("z")
z
sage: real(z).simplify()
z
sage: imag(z).simplify()
0
sage: with assuming(z,"complex"): real(z).simplify()
realpart(z)
sage: with assuming(z,"complex"): imag(z).simplify()
imagpart(z)
```

As corollaries :

```
sage: var("a, b")
(a, b)
sage: (a*imag(z) + b*imag(z)).factor()
0
sage: (a*z + b*z).factor().imag_part()
imag_part(z)*real_part(a) + imag_part(z)*real_part(b) + imag_part(a)*real_part(z) + imag_part(b)*real_part(z)
sage: (a*z + b*z).factor().imag_part().factor()
0
sage: (a*z + b*z).factor().imag_part().simplify()
0
```

but :

```
sage: with assuming(z,"complex"): (a*z + b*z).factor().imag_part().factor()
(a + b)*imagpart(z)
sage: with assuming(z,"complex"): (a*z + b*z).factor().imag_part().simplify()
a*imagpart(z) + b*imagpart(z)
```

`Maxima` has the same problem : in Sage's `maxima` :

```
sage: %%maxima
....: domain;
....: imagpart(z);
....: imagpart(ratsimp(z));
....: imagpart(factor(z));
....: 
....: 
complex
0
0
0
```

but :

```
sage: %%maxima
....: declare(z,complex);
....: imagpart(z);
....: imagpart(ratsimp(z));
....: imagpart(factor(z));
....: 
....: 
done
'imagpart(z)
'imagpart(z)
'imagpart(z)
```

Filing this as `blocker`, because this problem may lead to Sage *silently* returning mathematical nonsense...
