Currently, the gt() and lt() functions for points of Berkovich space over Cp treat infinity as a minimal Type I point:

```
sage: B = Berkovich_Cp_Projective(3)
sage: infinity = B((1,0))
sage: gauss = B(0,1)
sage: gauss.gt(infinity)
True
```

Infinity, however, is maximal with respect to the standard partial order. We fix this error.
