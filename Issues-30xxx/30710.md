Issue is that somewhere, some code is adding `/usr/include` to include directories and that conflicts with conda's sysroot.

isn't this done by cvxopt's [`setup.py`](https://github.com/cvxopt/cvxopt/blob/master/setup.py) ?
Probably it needs a patch to special-case conda.

Yes, good idea. 

In #31584#comment:10, I wrote:

  We do not need to do this when we use system suitesparse, as we do not want to claim authority that our configure script's suitesparse-finding technique is better than the one in cvxopt's install script.

But as it turns out, our technique (= just relying on standard compiler/linker paths) is better.
