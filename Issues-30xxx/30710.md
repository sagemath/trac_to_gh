isn't this done by cvxopt's [`setup.py`](https://github.com/cvxopt/cvxopt/blob/master/setup.py) ?
Probably it needs a patch to special-case conda.
(Sage does a bit of [patching](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/build/pkgs/cvxopt/patches/libsuitesparse_path.patch) of this file.)

The lines at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/build/pkgs/cvxopt/spkg-install.in#L68-L71
should be changed to

```
export CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR="${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib"
export CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR="${SAGE_LOCAL}/include"
```
even when suitesparse is coming from the system, so that `setup.py` doesn't add its default `/usr/include`.

Yes, good idea. 

In [#31584 comment:10](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31584#comment:10), I wrote:

  We do not need to do this when we use system suitesparse, as we do not want to claim authority that our configure script's suitesparse-finding technique is better than the one in cvxopt's install script.

But as it turns out, our technique (= just relying on standard compiler/linker paths) is better.
