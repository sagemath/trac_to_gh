In the [installation guide](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#command-line-tools), do we need to remove the option to use Python 2.7? Or is that not related to this ticket?

In principle it looks fine to me. How widely has it been tested?

- with Sage's Python 3?
- on systems with Python 3 (linux, OS X, OS X + homebrew)?
- on systems with only Python 2? (Should not be an issue, but should be tested anyway.)
- are there other configurations that need testing?
