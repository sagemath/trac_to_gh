This PR provides a minimal configuration for the static typing checker [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright). In #29775 typing for the manifolds package is added. As this is currently the only place where typing is used, it's the only source folder for pyright.

There are also quite a few other [code check options](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/master/docs/configuration.md). These seem to cover similar rules as pyflakes and pycodestyle. Since these two checker have problems with typings (at least in the versions that they are currently used in the patchbot), it might be worthwhile to investigate if they can be completely replaced by pyright.

Depends on #30408

Pyright is in the first place a static type checker, something that pyflakes does not do (or at least is not designed to do). 

Not that this PR only adds the config file, which aids the developer if he chooses to use pyright locally. It doesn't say that it needs to be used, or is integrated in the build workflow. That can be decided later. Given that pyright relies on node and has superior performance over alternatives as myphy, I could imagine that its good to be used in the build workflow and by developers that use VS code. Python-puristic developers propbably prefer a checker that can be installed via pip.


So I would propose to keep this PR as simple as possible, just add the config file for those people that want to use pyright, and add alternatives / integration with the build workflow later.
