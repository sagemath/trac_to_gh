Introducing a class to represent association schemes.
We represent a scheme with:
* the points of the scheme
* the relations as a matrix

We compute the intersection numbers and the relations lazily and use memoization for later uses.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Dima could you have a look at the class structure?
I would really appreciate your opinion on the implementation of the class before I invest a lot of time writing up all the documentation.

Roughly speaking, I store the set of points given in `self._X` and use the matrix `self._matrix` to represent relations via the abstraction:
`self._matrix[i,j] = k => (self._X[i], self._X[j]) in R_k`.
`self._R` is the list of all relations, i.e. `self._R[k]` represents `R_k` via `R_k = {(self._X[i], self._X[j]) | (i,j) in self._R[k]}` .
`self._P` is a dictionary for the intersection numbers: `p_{ij}^k = self._P[i][j][k]`.
All entries in `self._R` and `self._P` are initialised to `None` and computed only when needed.

<a id='comment:2'></a>There are things to take into account - I do have some code to work with association schemes, mostly written in GAP; some of it went into MSc thesis of my student last year:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02459 (and https://github.com/gap-packages/RepnDecomp)

- which was in turn taken from 
https://bitbucket.org/dimpase/cohcfg/src/default/
described in https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-15582-6_14

These are principally concerned with creating association schemes (or somewhat more general objects, known as coherent configurations) from permutation groups - their orbitals, to be precise.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I don't see where association schemes (or coherent configurations) are used in the package "RepnDecomp".

I got access to the book about the "cohcfg" package and I'll have a look at the implementation.
Interestingly on SOLO I found the a book titled "A GAP/Sage package for computation with coherent configurations" (http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/permalink/f/89vilt/ORAfefb05b0-8274-440d-a222-d8b9aea78344) (authored by you), so I was wondering if you ported the GAP package to Sage already.\\
If this is not the case, could you explain me how do I install the "cohcfg" package in the GAP installation used by Sage?

this is just a conference abstract, 3 pages - page numbers are given there.
Nothing more than in the other publication.

no, it's not in GAP, I didn't have time for it. :-(

for GAP there are actively maintained/developed packages:
 http://www.jesselansdown.com/AssociationSchemes/ (this is mostly to deal with complete enumeration of small associatuion schemes, but not only)

What functionality of association schemes do you need?

Checking if a given association scheme will produce a drg is more complicated.
I need to check that the association scheme is pseudo cyclic (so I need the intersection numbers) and that there is a commutative binary operation `+` s.t. `p_{i+l, j+l}^{k+l} = p_{i,j}^k` for any `i, j, k, l`.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Let me explain my whole plan, so that you can give me your opinion.\\
To build my drg function that generates the graphs from the intersection array, I'd would like a function that checks if Sage can build an association scheme whose graph is distance regular with the given intersection array.

Instead of going case by case, i.e. having checks such as "if array can be done with cyclotomic schemes (which we know are pseudo cyclic etc...), then build graph from cyclotomic scheme; else if ...." I would like a function that groups together all association schemes constructions (I guess it could just wrap the constructions avialable in http://www.jesselansdown.com/AssociationSchemes/).
This means that whenever a new association scheme, whose graph is distance regular, is added to the above function, then the related drgs can be constructed by Sage without any additional code.

As an example, for BIBDs I have the following code

```python
def is_from_square_BIBD(array) 
# function that take an intersection array and returns (v, k)
# if Sage can build a symmetric (v, k) BIBD whose graph has the given intersection array
# otherwise it returns False

def graph_from_square_BIBD(v, k):
lambd = (k*(k-1))//(v-1)
D = designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design(v,k,lambd=lambd)
return D.incidence_graph()

def distance_regular_graph(array):
# this is the function creating the distance regular graphs
...
t = is_from_square_BIBD(array)
if t is not False:
     G = graph_from_square_BIBD(*t)
...
return G
```

That's the pattern I would like to use for association schemes as well.
I don't plan to start adding more association scheme constructions that those available in the 2 gap packages.
Moreover, the function building the association schemes can't rely on the one building distance regular graphs as we will end up with an infinite loop.

Hope this explain my plan clearly. If you consider it to be too ambitious or simply flawed, then I can work on other parts of the project while we find an alternative solution.

Did you realise that quasigroups are basically Latin squares?
Cf. Sage's `LatinSquare_generator`, by the way.

the small cases can just be hardcoded, I guess.

<a id='comment:19'></a>What I understand from [BCN] 12.7 is that an association scheme S with a commutative quasi group I gives a distance regular graph if and only if S and I satisfy proposition 12.7.1.
Let I and I' be two distinct commutative quasi groups. Then we may have that S,I produces a drg but S,I' does not.
For instance, let S be the 4-class cyclotomic scheme. Then with I = C_4 we have a drg, but if I = C_2 x C_2, then we get a graph which is not distance regular.

That's why I have the function `_find_quasigroup` since, given S, I need to find the quasi group (if it exists) that will satisfy 12.7.1.

I looked at `LatinSquare_generator` and I have 2 doubts:
1. will it generate (eventually) all Latin squares of the same order as the input?
2. how can I tell if I've seen all Latin squares?

Trying out some examples, it looks like 2 may be an issue as the sequence generated can repeat before having shown all possible Latin squares. Sadly I don't think it is a possible route, yet I can't see any other way... Unless you have some ideas, we might have to ditch `_find_quasigroup` completely.

perhaps C2xC2 is special - it seems that (b), in the group case, essentially allows only elementary abelian 2-groups, with a the group identify element.

iirc it is known how many Latin squares there are -- check oeis.org

It is PSO extended by the Galois automorphisms - which for q=p<sup>k</sup>, p prime, form a cyclic group of order r, generated by the maps t->t<sup>p</sup> for each t in GF(q). (and the the action on the vectors is coordinatewise).

This notation may be found e.g. in the Altlas of Finite Groups by Conway et al.
