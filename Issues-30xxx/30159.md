Sage will try to use your system Python
if it is >= 3.6 and < 3.9.

Or it can build its own Python which will be 3.8.5.

To make sure it builds its own Python
if you build from scratch:

```
$ make configure
$ ./configure --with-system-python3=no -q
$ make -s V=0
```

where
- you can replace `make configure` by `./bootstrap`
- `-q` is for "quiet", drop it for more verbose output
- `-s V=0" are for "silent" and "lowest verbosity",
  drop them for more verbose output

To force Sage to rebuild Python and everything that
depends on it, after it was built using the ambient
system's Python:

```
$ V=0 sage -f python3
```

where again V=0 is for less verbose output,
drop it if you like more verbose output.

I see. Thanks for the explanation.

These are in the nitpick category: Could the patched tarball name have a slightly more descriptive description (the numbering `p2` also doesn't make sense once it goes into Sage as well). I would leave it also as `.p0` since you are patching that new modified version for the first time.

However, it won't have a good history on the mirrors as it feels arbitrary. Anyways, I don't care that strongly about it, so feel free to set a positive review if you want to keep the name.
