<a id='comment:7'></a>Hello,

please do the following changes to the 3 methods.

- use `Return` instead of `Returns`

```diff
-    Returns a gem graph with 5 nodes.
+    Returns a gem graph with 5 nodes.
```

- this form is more usual. I know other forms are used in `basic.py`, but this will be unified in the future.

```diff
-    EXAMPLES: Construct and show a gem graph
-
-    ::

+    Construct and show a gem graph::

<a id='comment:11'></a>I didn't see that one, sorry

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/graphs/graph_list.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/graphs/graph_list.py", line 321, in sage.graphs.graph_list.show_graphs
Failed example:
    len(glist)
Expected:
    14
Got:
    17
```

Also, I suggest to add `# long time` after `g.show()` like

```diff
-        sage: g.show()
+        sage: g.show()  # long time
```
it's not interesting when running doctests to display these graphs, but it is good for the documentation.
