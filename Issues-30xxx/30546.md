We make the `configure` search for a suitable `python3` more straightforward.

Instead of searching for various names such as `python3.8`, `python3.7` etc., we only look for `python3`. 

As is standard practice, users will set their `PATH` so that the `python3` that is accessible from the `PATH` is the desired Python version.

As an additional mechanism, we add `configure --with-python=/PATH/TO/PYTHON`.  In contrast to the (undocumented) `configure PYTHON3=/PATH/TO/PYTHON`, it runs the usual tests whether this python is actually suitable.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Why is that the case? It's perfectly fine to have different fully-featured python3.x installed.
It works on Homebrew to use its python3.8 in Sage, while python3 still is python3.7
It works on Gentoo, which may have python3.6-9 installed all at the same time.
(Python plays an important role on Linux, one can't easily bump the version)

E.g. that's what I have on a Gentoo box, without doing anything special:

```
# python3 <tab>
python3            python3.7-config   python3.7m-config  python3.8-config   python3.9-config   
python3.7          python3.7m         python3.8          python3.9          python3-config 
```

On Ubuntu 18.04 one can install python3.8 (the system python is 3.6, and I'm not sure if it works well in Sage)

for this, we should revive `--with-python=` option, not this kinds of silly hacks.

Besides, as I said, it's not always safe to prepend stuff to your PATH.

Say, you build under Homebrew, but want to use system Python, in /usr/bin.
Prepending /usr/bin to your PATH will likely break stuff in Hombrew, as some of it depends on /usr/local/bin being first in your PATH.

Same with Conda - it prepends stuff to PATH, and prepending /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin to PATH under active Conda will likely break it. 

In general, many Python-dependent environments have the concept of "main" Python. We discussed on `sage-devel` that Homebrew modifies `~/.zshrc` (if the account's shell is `zsh`)

```
% cat ~/.zshrc
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.7/bin:$PATH"
```
Prepending to the PATH here might open a can of worms.

I understand. Can you prepend your preferred location to `PATH` only during `./configure`? It's a given that you don't want to prepend it *everywhere*. We have a problem either way. If we make your change, then it becomes harder to override a newer python in `/usr/bin` with an older one in e.g. `/usr/local/bin`.

Bringing back `--with-python` could address both concerns... but does `PATH=whatever ./configure` not work?

This is a very fragile solution. There are many things in /usr/bin that might wreak havoc, imagine some `foobar-config` which has to be called by `./configure`

my solution has one advantage - it makes the outcome independent of the order of things in PATH, which is something that users might - and will - screw up.

it is a bit pointless to discuss whether it works on a box at hand, as it is obviously a very fragile solution, and I explained why.

if you want to install Sage into a Python that is in /usr/bin, then under the current scheme of things it might not get picked if /usr/bin is not the 1st in PATH.
