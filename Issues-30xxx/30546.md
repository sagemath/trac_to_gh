We make the `configure` search for a suitable `python3` more straightforward.

Instead of searching for various names such as `python3.8`, `python3.7` etc., we only look for `python3`. 

As is standard practice, users will set their `PATH` so that the `python3` that is accessible from the `PATH` is the desired Python version.

As an additional mechanism, we add `configure --with-python=/PATH/TO/PYTHON`.  In contrast to the (undocumented) `configure PYTHON3=/PATH/TO/PYTHON`, it runs the usual tests whether this python is actually suitable.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Why is that the case? It's perfectly fine to have different fully-featured python3.x installed.
It works on Homebrew to use its python3.8 in Sage, while python3 still is python3.7
It works on Gentoo, which may have python3.6-9 installed all at the same time.
(Python plays an important role on Linux, one can't easily bump the version)

E.g. that's what I have on a Gentoo box, without doing anything special:

```
# python3 <tab>
python3            python3.7-config   python3.7m-config  python3.8-config   python3.9-config   
python3.7          python3.7m         python3.8          python3.9          python3-config 
```

On Ubuntu 18.04 one can install python3.8 (the system python is 3.6, and I'm not sure if it works well in Sage)

Say, you build under Homebrew, but want to use system Python, in /usr/bin.
Prepending /usr/bin to your PATH will likely break stuff in Hombrew, as some of it depends on /usr/local/bin being first in your PATH.

Same with Conda - it prepends stuff to PATH, and prepending /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin to PATH under active Conda will likely break it. 

In general, many Python-dependent environments have the concept of "main" Python. We discussed on `sage-devel` that Homebrew modifies `~/.zshrc` (if the account's shell is `zsh`)

```
% cat ~/.zshrc
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.7/bin:$PATH"
```
Prepending to the PATH here might open a can of worms.

I understand. Can you prepend your preferred location to `PATH` only during `./configure`? It's a given that you don't want to prepend it *everywhere*. We have a problem either way. If we make your change, then it becomes harder to override a newer python in `/usr/bin` with an older one in e.g. `/usr/local/bin`.

Bringing back `--with-python` could address both concerns... but does `PATH=whatever ./configure` not work?

This is a very fragile solution. There are many things in /usr/bin that might wreak havoc, imagine some `foobar-config` which has to be called by `./configure`

my solution has one advantage - it makes the outcome independent of the order of things in PATH, which is something that users might - and will - screw up.

it is a bit pointless to discuss whether it works on a box at hand, as it is obviously a very fragile solution, and I explained why.

if you want to install Sage into a Python that is in /usr/bin, then under the current scheme of things it might not get picked if /usr/bin is not the 1st in PATH.
