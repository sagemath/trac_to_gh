Before this ticket, `count` depends on the representation (list vs str) in a surprising way, see [this question on ask](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/52468):

```
sage: s = 'aaabaaababaaaaabbbbb'
sage: u = Word(list(s))
sage: v = Word(s)
sage: u.count('ab')
0
sage: v.count('ab')
4
```
because

```
sage: type(v)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_str'>
sage: type(u)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
```
The proposed solution is to fix `count` so that it behaves like list.count and tuple.count:

```
sage: list(u).count('ab')
0
sage: list(v).count('ab')
0
```

In the proposed branch, the method `count` is now an alias to the method `number_of_letter_occurrences`.

Doing so, we also deprecate few methods in favor of:

```
_pos_in                    -> first_occurrence
first_pos_in               -> first_occurrence
factor_occurrences_in      -> factor_occurrences_iterator
nb_factor_occurrences_in   -> number_of_factor_occurrences
nb_subword_occurrences_in  -> number_of_subword_occurrences
```

According to the documentation `count` counts the number of letters as in the behavior of the method `count` for python lists (not as the method count for python str which counts factors as well!). In that sense, it is a bad usage from the user. The reason for the different behavior outside of the documented domain is that the implementation depends on the data structure.

```python
sage: W = Words('ab', 20)
sage: u = W.random_element()
sage: v = Word('aaabaaababaaaaabbbbb')

sage: type(u)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
sage: type(v)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_str'>

sage: v.count
<built-in method count of FiniteWord_str object at 0x7f3853f0cc50>
sage: u.count
<built-in method count of FiniteWord_list object at 0x7f3853f12a48>
```

The method `FiniteWord_list.count` and `FiniteWord_str.count` do not do the same thing as both overwrites the generic method `FiniteWord_class.count` (copied below) and delagate their job to `list.count` and `str.count` (faster).

The generic method is:

```python
sage: sage.combinat.words.finite_word.FiniteWord_class.count??
Signature: sage.combinat.words.finite_word.FiniteWord_class.count(self, letter)
Source:   
    def count(self, letter):
        r"""
        Count the number of occurrences of ``letter`` in ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: Word('abbabaab').count('a')
            4
        """
        return Integer(sum(1 for a in self if a == letter))
```

The method `FiniteWord_list.count` is:

```python
sage: sage.combinat.words.word_datatypes.WordDatatype_list.count??
Source:
    def count(self, a):
        r"""
        Returns the number of occurrences of the letter ``a`` in the word
        ``self``.

        INPUT:

        -  ``a`` - a letter

        OUTPUT:

        - integer

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: w = Word([0,1,1,0,1])
            sage: w.count(0)
            2
            sage: w.count(1)
            3
            sage: w.count(2)
            0

        """
        return self._data.count(a)
```

The method `FiniteWord_str.count` is:

```python
sage: sage.combinat.words.word_datatypes.WordDatatype_str.count??
Source:
    def count(self, letter):
        r"""
        Count the number of occurrences of ``letter``.

        INPUT:

        - ``letter`` - a letter

        OUTPUT:

        - integer

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: w = Word("abbabaabababa")
            sage: w.count('a')
            7
            sage: w.count('b')
            6
            sage: w.count('c')
            0

        """
        return self._data.count(letter)
```

But, I agree that it could be more robust (provide an error message if the letter is not in the alphabet? or return zero? or advertise about `nb_factor_occurrences`?). Or should `count` works also for counting occurences of factors?

In principal the change is ok, also I would have expected `count(self, 'ab')` to count the number of times the pattern `'ab'` appears in `self`. Then again 'ab' can also be a letter, so we have to distinguish.

What I don't like is the mess with the names. For `v = Word('ab')` there is:

- `number_of_factors`
- `number_of_inversions`
- `number_of_{left/right}_special_factors`
- `nb_factor_occurs_in`
- `nb_subword_occurs_in`

Could we maybe add aliases
- `number_factor_occurs_in` and `number_of_occurences_of_factor` (the later would cast the other into a word, if it isn't already)

and likewise for `subword`.

This would make it much easier to find and in my opinion would make #30143 obsolete.

Works for me.

What do you think of those aliases?

I missed that you added the `SEEALSO` and this is great. Once you want to count something, you can look into documentation of `count`, which helps you find all the methods related to counting (in particular you see that there are methods `nb_of_...` and `number_of_...`.

Those methods names (`nb_*` and `*_in`) were from my master thesis back in 2007 where I just did not know what good choice to make. Today, I think the `nb_` shoud be replaced by `n_` or `number_of`, let's take `number_of` to be consistent with other methods in the same class. Also, I don't like the `*_in` like `f.factor_occurrences_in(w)` which I think should be better written as `w.factor_occurrences(f)`. Here I think I was mislead by the way the method `__str__.find` is implemented...

Anyway, since the set of `nb_` methods was strongly intersecting the set of `*_in` methods, I decided to deprecate them all at once.

There are still other stuff that I dislike in that module, like `u.is_factor(w)` should be the other way around `w.is_factor(u)`, but let's keep those for another ticket.

+In the proposed branch, the method `count` is now an alias to the method `number_of_letter_occurrences`.
 
-- https://ask.sagemath.org/question/52468
+Doing so, we also deprecate few methods in favor of:

+first_pos_in               -> first_occurrence

Sorry, two more things:

+        Return the position of the first occurrence of ``other`` in ``self``,

``other`` needs no longer be finite. Maybe also a quick comment, about that the function might not terminate for infinite words. I don't think it is a problem. I tried it and one can keyboard interrupt without any problems.
