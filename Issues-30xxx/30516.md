Today, I have encountered the following bug:

```
sage: W = WeightedIntegerVectors([1,2,3])
sage: w = W([1,1,1])
sage: parent(w)
Integer vectors of 0 weighted by [1, 2, 3]
```

This is definitely wrong. The parent should be `Integer vectors of 6 weighted by [1, 2, 3]`.

```
sage: W0 = WeightedIntegerVectors(0, [1,2,3])
sage: W0([1,1,1])

This is a bug, too. As far as I understand the code of `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets`, it checks all subsets until the element is coercible into this subset.

Probably a more direct approach is more useful and faster here, i.e. compute the grading (already there) and coerce into the corresponding weighted integer vector.

Opinions?
