Although we have deferred the Arb upgrade to Sage 9.3, on various platforms (e.g. `ubuntu-groovy-standard`, https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1058929422) we are already getting the doctest failures because system Arb is 2.18.

Hence we need to adjust the doctests (see #28623) already in Sage 9.2 - so that they work with both the older and the newer version.

there are examples of tests that lead to an error on 2.16, while producing 
a meaningful answer on 2.18, so I don't really think this is easy to consolidate - without making doctests dependent on the arb  version (are there facilities for this ?)

this are tags for, and tagging of tests in rings/real_arb, allowing both versions to be tested properly.

is this the right way to get `arb` version that I use?

From the point of view of sage-on-distros the use of something like `package_versions` or anything else from `sage.misc.package` is wrong.

The only clear difference between versions seem to be the soname or equivalent of the library. And that information may be be meaningless on some platforms.
