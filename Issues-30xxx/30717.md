I thought "Software System" is too much. But looking at this

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Software_System_Award

the term seems appropriate.

Sphinx is throwing a warning for me if we have an external link code and don't use it, and in building the html documentation we treat warnings as errors.

Here, <code>\`DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6259615 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6259615>\`_ </code> causes a warning. 

Rewriting this as <code>:doi:\`DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6259615 <10.5281/zenodo.6259615>\`</code> gets rid of the warning. This occurs once again later. In total, I suggest something like
