Clearly the dtor is racing with the sage-cleaner process that is deleting the temporary directory:

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/psage.py", line 114, in sage.interfaces.psage.PSage.__del__
Failed example:
    PSage().__del__()
Expected nothing
Got:
    Exception ignored in: <function ExpectElement.__del__ at 0xd14d6388>
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/interfaces/expect.py", line 1513, in __del__
        P.clear(self._name)
      File "/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/interfaces/sage0.py", line 369, in clear
        self.eval('del %s' % var)
      File "/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/interfaces/psage.py", line 129, in eval
