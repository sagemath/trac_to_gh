Other math software accept input such as `5!` for `factorial(5)`.

Tentatively `!` could be preparsed to `.factorial()`.

Thorny points: strings, f-strings.

```
sage: n = 5
sage: n!
120
sage: "n!"
'n!'
sage: f"{n}! equals {n!}"
'5! equals 120'
```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Regarding `!=`, thankfully,

- equality is `==`
- non-equality is `!=`
- there is no `!==`
- one cannot assign to an expression

Example with `!=`:

- `x+3!=9` must mean `(x + 3) != 9`, i.e.,
  it must mean `x + 3` not equal to `9`
- writing `x + (3!) = 9` would be incorrect,
  as we cannot assign to `x + 6`
- no risk of confusion with `x + (3!) == 9`

Example with `!==`:

- `x+3!==9` must mean `x + (3!) == 9`, i.e.,
  it must mean `x + 6` equal to `9`
- writing `(x + 3) !== 9` would be incorrect
- writing `(x + 3) != = 9` would be incorrect

More concisely: Only preparse "!" in situations where it's a syntax error in python. As far as I can see, the only valid use of "!" in python presently is in "!=" (no space allowed in between). The problem with f-strings is more universally a problem in the preparser. I think our first approximation, which is consistent with an f-string-unaware preparser, is to NOT parse f"{3!}". In fact, f-strings are a general concern for the preparser, not an issue unique to "!". There's probably already a ticket for it.
