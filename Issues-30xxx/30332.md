One thing to keep in mind is the context of the planned modularization of sagelib. 
In Sage 9.3 I would hope to be able to create a separate distribution (distutils package) `sage-brial`, which would then package `sage.rings.polynomial.{brial,pbori}`, `sage.libs.polybori`, `sage.libs.fes`, `sage.crypto.boolean_function` -- everything that has a compile-time dependency on `libbrial`. This will make it possible to separately compile `sagelib` on systems without brial.

<a id='comment:12'></a>This is not ready for review. I am just pushing my work in progress so it is not just on my workstation, it is visible and open to others contribution.

There is a lot to do:
1. update paths
2. convert docstrings and tests to sage framework

This may take some time and I doubt it will be ready in time for 9.2 but we can only try.

Indeed, this is a known problem that needs some attention: #21892, #24748, possibly #27019, #23310, #23312, possibly #23311, #15223.

My idea is to scrap `BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor` and just have `BooleanPolynomialRing` be a `UniqueRepresentation` object, possibly just being a subclass of the monoid algebra parent.
