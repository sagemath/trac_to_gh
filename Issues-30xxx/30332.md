I thought that sage-brial depends on `sage.libs.polybori` but that may not be the case. It imports `sage.all` and specifically `sage.rings.polynomial.pbori` and that's the only sage specific bits it imports.

`sage.rings.polynomial.pbori` itself relies on `sage.libs.polybori` (through `sage.libs.polybori.decl`) and both need the C++ brial library.

Does that answer your question?

One thing to keep in mind is the context of the planned modularization of sagelib. 
In Sage 9.3 I would hope to be able to create a separate distribution (distutils package) `sage-brial`, which would then package `sage.rings.polynomial.{brial,pbori}`, `sage.libs.polybori`, `sage.libs.fes`, `sage.crypto.boolean_function` -- everything that has a compile-time dependency on `libbrial`. This will make it possible to separately compile `sagelib` on systems without brial.

Tests included inside `sage-brial` will have to be moved to sage doctesting. More generally it will have to be documented properly as much as possible. This will be so much fun.

It looks like that will take much more than just drag and drop in place with a few cosmetic changes.

This is not ready for review. I am just pushing my work in progress so it is not just on my workstation, it is visible and open to others contribution.

There is a lot to do:
1. update paths
2. convert docstrings and tests to sage framework

This may take some time and I doubt it will be ready in time for 9.2 but we can only try.

Indeed, this is a known problem that needs some attention: #21892, #24748, possibly #27019, #23310, #23312, possibly #23311, #15223.

My idea is to scrap `BooleanPolynomialRing_constructor` and just have `BooleanPolynomialRing` be a `UniqueRepresentation` object, possibly just being a subclass of the monoid algebra parent.
