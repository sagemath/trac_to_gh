All `sdist` needs is to know SAGE_ROOT and SAGE_SRC - and this info definitely does not need Sage to be built.\nI.e.\n\n```\nmake clean && SAGE_ROOT=`pwd` SAGE_SRC=`pwd`/src ./sage -sdist\n```\nshould work for you.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A10):
> This breaks `make clean && ./sage -sdist`, which is what I'm using to create the source tarballs. One could require to first build Sage before making source tarballs,

no, why? All `sdist` needs is to know SAGE_ROOT and SAGE_SRC - and this info definitely does not need Sage to be built.
I.e.

```
make clean && SAGE_ROOT=`pwd` SAGE_SRC=`pwd`/src ./sage -sdist
```
should work for you. If we really must, we can provide such defaults in `build/bin/sage-sdist`.

Please tell us how we should proceed here.

The problem reported on the original ticket description is fixed in #30841.

But I think it's time to clean up the `-clean` targets - see #21566, #21775.
