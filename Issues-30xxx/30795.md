no, why? All `sdist` needs is to know SAGE_ROOT and SAGE_SRC - and this info definitely does not need Sage to be built.
I.e.

```
make clean && SAGE_ROOT=`pwd` SAGE_SRC=`pwd`/src ./sage -sdist
```
should work for you. If we really must, we can provide such defaults in `build/bin/sage-sdist`.

Please tell us how we should proceed here.
