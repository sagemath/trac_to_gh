On distributions that use the multiarch installation scheme, python provides the `MULTIARCH` sysconfig variable. 

We modify `sage.env._get_shared_lib_filename` to use it.
(Currently it tries to use `MULTILIB` which does not exist.)
Moreover, I took the opportunity to refactor the code in the `_get_shared_lib_filename` method to use `pathlib`.

Why does it change the code for Cygwin? Beyond the scope of the ticket.

And why does it change the doctest to `pattern = "*/lib*Singular-*.so"`? My guess is that this is untested.

That make sense, I was under the impression that you also have CI for cygwin.

I have tested the code manually during development. After `sudo touch /usr/bin/cygSingular-test.dll` the following script

```
import sysconfig
import sys
from sage.env import _get_shared_lib_path

print(sysconfig.get_config_var('BINDIR'))

sys.platform = 'cygwin'
print(_get_shared_lib_path("Singular"))

```

returns, as expected,

```
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/cygSingular-test.dll
```
