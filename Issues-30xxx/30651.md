<a id='comment:3'></a>I'm trying to compile sage-9.2.rc0 on big sur with xcode 12.0.1. 

I ran `sage -f openblas`. Here's the tail of that:

(see the openblas attachment).

After trying lots of things such as

```
$ ./configure \
  --enable-universalsdk=$(xcodebuild -version -sdk macosx Path) \
  --with-universal-archs=intel-64
$ source /Users/wdj/sagefiles/sage-9.2.rc0/.homebrew-build-env
$ ./config.status --recheck && ./config.status
$ ./sage -f gfortran
```
the compilation of `sage -f gfortran` stopped with an error compiling R.

However, Sage did start and crash with this error:

```
wdj@jeeves sage-9.2.rc0 % ./sage

A problem occurred executing Python code.  Here is the sequence of function
calls leading up to the error, with the most recent (innermost) call last.
```
(for the rest, see the error-in-start attachment).

It looks like Sage's Python doesn't work, right? Wrong:

<a id='comment:4'></a>I've actually gotten this to build for me without patching Sage in any way, just building 9.2.rc0. Homebrew setup:

Then I used the command

```

  --with-system-zlib=no \
  --with-system-gfortran=no \
  --with-system-openblas=no \
  --with-system-bzip2=no
```
after which `make` worked but `make ptestlong`
showed a bunch of failures, all like this:

```
Expected nothing
Got:
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmp.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libmpfr.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)
    ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libgmpxx.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)
```
Maybe because `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is being set? I could try building Sage's `mpfr` and `gmp`. But in any case, I got Sage to build, unfortunately by not using a bunch of the system versions of things.

I could try that, but it won't work because our `mpir` is broken when using Xcode 12, with the usual error, and the latest release of `mpir` (`git clone git://github.com/wbhart/mpir.git mpir`) doesn't help.

What is the value of MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET used in this build? I would not be surprised if there is an incompatibility barrier between macOS 10 and macOS 11.

It's a standard package, so I'm confused about what the alternatives are.

Anyway, I hacked the spkg-install.in script for `mpir`, as in #30729, and I got it to build. That eliminated those doctest failures. I'm left with two:

I haven't changed Sage, so it's whatever gets set in sage-env: 10.9, I think.

One can choose between gmp and mpir. Both are standard, but only one is needed.

Use the configure flag `--with-mp=gmp` or `with-mp=mpir` to choose.

Likewise, one can choose between ATLAS and OpenBLAS, and both are standard.

Use `--with-blas=openblas` or `--with-blas=atlas` for that.

In that case #30350 proposes to remove ATLAS.

Just a quick remark - `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` only gets set in builds configured `--without-system-python`.  (See #30724, which makes this code in `sage-env` cleaner.)

They cannot be, and are not, "installed together" - `mpir` uses the "gmp compatibility" mode where it installs gmp-compatible libs etc. You need to run `./configure with `--with-mp=gmp` to select gmp as the package to use for `mp`, (= multiple precision), as the default for `mp` is `mpir`.

Default `mp`  should be changed to `gmp`, I think, as `mpir` is getting bitrotten more and more.
See #30752 (where a lie about mpir/gmp told by `./configure -h` is uncovered, as well)

<a id='comment:42'></a>I can get Sage to build on OS X 11.1 with the following changes:

- #30589
- upgrade setuptools and setuptools_scm (not sure if this is necessary)
- patch cffi and numpy: without patching, I get an error during cffi's `setup.py` when evaluating this:

```
return tuple(map(int, get_config_var("MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET").split('.')))
```
 The problem is that `get_config_var(...)` returns the int 11 rather than the string "11", so I patched it to do `str(get_config_var(...))`. Similar with numpy.
- add `export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0` in the `spkg-install.in` script for `scipy`.

I did not set any global environment variables.

There were some doctest failures, I think all due to gfortran. For example:

```

We will have to backport the fix because numpy 1.20 has dropped support for Python 3.6, which I think we want to continue supporting in Sage 9.3

Actually, this is not correct: this variable is not universally defined anymore, so Sage packages that try to use it end up printing warnings. For example, `r`:

```
./spkg-install: line 90: [: -ge: unary operator expected
./spkg-install: line 94: [: -ge: unary operator expected
```
See #31186.
