Why are lines like

```
if [ "$1" = '-optional' -o "$1" = "--optional" ]; then
    shift
    exec sage-list-packages optional $@
fi
```
in both `src/bin/sage` and `build/bin/sage-site`? In any case, this ticket looks like a good time to delete those from `src/bin/sage`, unless I'm missing something.
