(from #30448)

We add a tox environment that checks all of the static patterns that the patchbot checks - https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/blob/master/sage_patchbot/plugins.py#L601

This is so that developers can check style locally instead of going through endless cycles with the patchbot on trac.

This uses https://pypi.org/project/relint/

Example:

```
   sage -tox -e relint src/sage/plot/
```



Depends on #30410

Right. For now I just wanted to get these on par with the patchbot. I would prefer to make further refinements in follow-up tickets.

Regarding Python 3 - these patterns may still be helpful when reviving ancient branches. Some of these patterns, of course, will be flagged by the Python 3 parser; but other patterns are for syntactically correct but outdated library functions that may be used in parts of code that is not covered by doctests.

> - relint should also be documented #30361 

I'll do this in #30453 (Document "sage -tox")

> and added to the lint action #30404

#30404 should possibly just invoke tox

> Scrolling through the tox documentation, I'm also not sure if the processing of arguments is really in the spirit of tox. For example, the foreach loop for relint makes it impossible to pass further cmd args to relint (since they would end up in the loop). On the other hand, I see that its also convenient to have a systematic interface to apply the command to only one file. Maybe leave this functionality to `sage --tox`?

tox runs all environments by default -- so there needs to be a uniform interface for file/directory arguments

OK. I think I am going to change `sage --coverage` so that it can invoke `sage --coverageall` if necessary.

Then I can get rid of `sh -c` for all "sagedirect" environments.

I like it. It saves you from waiting on the patchbots to do trivial stuff.

As for the python3 style. That is still helpful. Iterator classes will probably still take `.next()`, but you shouldn't use it anymore and at some point, this should be removed.

Works for me.
