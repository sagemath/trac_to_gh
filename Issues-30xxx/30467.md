(from #30448)

We add a tox environment that checks all of the static patterns that the patchbot checks - https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/blob/master/sage_patchbot/plugins.py#L601

This is so that developers can check style locally instead of going through endless cycles with the patchbot on trac.

This uses https://pypi.org/project/relint/

Example:

```
   sage -tox -e relint src/sage/plot/
```

Thanks for the heads-up. Do you have a specific suggestion what to do instead?

Right. For now I just wanted to get these on par with the patchbot. I would prefer to make further refinements in follow-up tickets.

Regarding Python 3 - these patterns may still be helpful when reviving ancient branches. Some of these patterns, of course, will be flagged by the Python 3 parser; but other patterns are for syntactically correct but outdated library functions that may be used in parts of code that is not covered by doctests.

> - relint should also be documented #30361 


I'll do this in #30453 (Document "sage -tox")

> and added to the lint action #30404


#30404 should possibly just invoke tox

OK. I think I am going to change `sage --coverage` so that it can invoke `sage --coverageall` if necessary.

Then I can get rid of `sh -c` for all "sagedirect" environments.

I like it. It saves you from waiting on the patchbots to do trivial stuff.

As for the python3 style. That is still helpful. Iterator classes will probably still take `.next()`, but you shouldn't use it anymore and at some point, this should be removed.

Works for me.

@gh-tobiasdiez: Do you have anything that needs changing yet.
