After #29500, it is possible to install Python packages built by the Sage distribution into user-defined venvs.  

As of Sage 9.3.beta8, `sagelib` is published as a source distribution on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/sagemath-standard), but the package does not have proper dependency information yet. 

As part of `bootstrap`, we now generate (1) the `pyproject.toml` (PEP 517 metadata) and `install_requires` information, (2) `requirements.txt` and (3) `Pipfile` using m4 from the information added in #30719.  These files provide 3 distinct ways of setting up a user-defined venv.

(Adding `pyproject.toml` does not change how the Sage distribution installs sagelib because `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install` uses `setup.py install` directly.)

**To test - use `./bootstrap` and then configure and build the Sage distribution.**  Then follow the instructions in `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/tox.ini`:

```
    #
    # SUPPORTED ENVIRONMENTS:
    #
    # Build dependencies according to requirements.txt (all versions fixed).
    # Use ONLY the wheels built and stored by the Sage distribution (no PyPI):
    #
    #   ./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sagelib/src && tox -v -v -v -e python-sagewheels-nopypi)'
    #
    python-sagewheels-nopypi,
    #
    # Build and test without using the concrete dependencies specified by requirements.txt,
    # using the dependencies declared in pyproject.toml and setup.cfg (install-requires) only:
    # Still use ONLY the wheels built and stored by the Sage distribution (no PyPI).
    #
    #   ./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sagelib/src && tox -v -v -v -e python-sagewheels-nopypi-norequirements)'
    #
    python-sagewheels-nopypi-norequirements,
    #
```

Since the setup.cfg and requirments.txt file are static (do not depend on the developers/users system), I would check them in as normal files instead of auto-generating them as part of the bootstrap. Then one would only need to update them as part of a package update (having a (doc)test to verify that the content of these files is always up-to-date).

A few more observations while scrolling through the code:
- I think the Licence file should be in the root, so that other tools (e.g. github) automatically pick them up.
- Are the symlinks really necessary? I would prefer if instead the path of the original is passed to e.g. setuptools.
- Concerning `sagewheels:      --index-url=file://{env:SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS:{env:SAGE_LOCAL:{toxinidir}/../../../../local}/var/lib/sage/wheels/simple}`, wouldn't it be easier to let `SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS` point to the full location of the wheels (e.g. `local/var/lib/sage/wheels/simple`)?

No, this is preparation for modularization, in which we will have dozens of packages.
Auto-generation is key for maintainability.

Hm... If that is so, then we should generate this information from the version constraints that are in the files `install-requires.txt`.

But what if the user wants to lock the same versions that are defined in the Sage distribution?

And also my guess is that `Pipfile` should then also contain lists of packages that are not actual dependencies of `sagelib` but are present in the Sage distribution.

> Let's investigate if the pipfile.lock file really needs to include hashes or we can get away with automatically generating a weaker version.


The hashes and the complete dependency tree is what makes pipenv special over requirements.txt. For applications (i.e. sage distribution), it should be fine to pin the versions in the pipfile (in the build folder). Normally you don't want to do this because it makes upgrades harder (if the versions are free, you can simply run `pipenv update` for this). But since upgrades are done differently in sage anyway, it should be fine.

So what you think about the following:
- One pipfile in build (pipfile.lock in gitignore) with all packages in the distribution and version information locked (for users to use pipenv to install pip packages)
- One pipfile in src (pipfile.lock in gitignore) with all dependencies of sagelib and version information as free as possible (for developers to generate a dev environment, and for CI as test environment)

Yes, we can do this; except I would put in `SAGE_ROOT`, not `SAGE_ROOT/build`. (We create environment files for conda there already. And `build` is the location of the `setup.py` of `sage_bootstrap` - so that would be confusing.)

OK.

For the files in build/pkgs/sagelib, are they meant for distribution? In this case, it's probably enough to add only the pipfile in the root there (since src/pipfile is for developers only).

Since the pipfile in the root seems to be only for distribution, why not put it directly in `build/pgks/sagelib`?

The version of the pipfile that pins the versions to the sage distribution's versions will need the pinnings of these dependencies.

Pipenv will use the prebuilt wheels anyway, so there is no point in installing build dependencies for these packages, right?

Most dependencies are actually not just build dependencies but runtime dependencies.

Mhh, with this I have no experience, as I've always took the wheel from pypi or had the build dependencies installed. 

Maybe it works if you set `prefer_binary = true`. In general, the selection seems to follow the following criteria:

Thanks, that's something to explore in a follow up.

For this ticket I think I don't want to spend more time on `pipenv`. The other, more elementary, ways of installing things are working fine.

One more point for discussion is if the pipfile should list the dependencies or if it is enough to only put them in the install_requires.
Normally, the advice seems to be to put them only in install_requires, but that's mainly to capture missing dependencies and not bother to keep the files in sync. But since they are now automatically generated, I'm not sure how to precede.
