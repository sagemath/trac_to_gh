After #29500, it is possible to install Python packages built by the Sage distribution into user-defined venvs.  

As of Sage 9.3.beta8, `sagelib` is published as a source distribution on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/sagemath-standard), but the package does not have proper dependency information yet. 

As part of `bootstrap`, we now generate (1) the `pyproject.toml` (PEP 517 metadata) and `install_requires` information, (2) `requirements.txt` and (3) `Pipfile` using m4 from the information added in #30719.  These files provide 3 distinct ways of setting up a user-defined venv.

(Adding `pyproject.toml` does not change how the Sage distribution installs sagelib because `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install` uses `setup.py install` directly.)

**To test - use `./bootstrap` and then configure and build the Sage distribution.**  Then follow the instructions in `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/tox.ini`:

```
    #
    # SUPPORTED ENVIRONMENTS:
    #
    # Build dependencies according to requirements.txt (all versions fixed).
    # Use ONLY the wheels built and stored by the Sage distribution (no PyPI):
    #
    #   ./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sagelib/src && tox -v -v -v -e python-sagewheels-nopypi)'
    #
    python-sagewheels-nopypi,
    #
    # Build and test without using the concrete dependencies specified by requirements.txt,
    # using the dependencies declared in pyproject.toml and setup.cfg (install-requires) only:
    # Still use ONLY the wheels built and stored by the Sage distribution (no PyPI).
    #
    #   ./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sagelib/src && tox -v -v -v -e python-sagewheels-nopypi-norequirements)'
    #
    python-sagewheels-nopypi-norequirements,
    #
```

I don't like to have generated files in the git repository. The only files for which we do that (the release manager does, actually) is to update Sage's own version files, and in the long term I would actually change that.

Well, only specifying known upper and lower bounds for the versions. Maybe it would make sense to add min/max version information in build/pkgs?


> Let's investigate if the pipfile.lock file really needs to include hashes or we can get away with automatically generating a weaker version.


The hashes and the complete dependency tree is what makes pipenv special over requirements.txt. For applications (i.e. sage distribution), it should be fine to pin the versions in the pipfile (in the build folder). Normally you don't want to do this because it makes upgrades harder (if the versions are free, you can simply run `pipenv update` for this). But since upgrades are done differently in sage anyway, it should be fine.

So what you think about the following:
- One pipfile in build (pipfile.lock in gitignore) with all packages in the distribution and version information locked (for users to use pipenv to install pip packages)
- One pipfile in src (pipfile.lock in gitignore) with all dependencies of sagelib and version information as free as possible (for developers to generate a dev environment, and for CI as test environment)

This information was recently added in the files `install-requires.txt`
and this is what we are generating `setup.cfg [install_requires]` from.

The version of the pipfile that pins the versions to the sage distribution's versions will need the pinnings of these dependencies.

Pipenv will use the prebuilt wheels anyway, so there is no point in installing build dependencies for these packages, right?

Most dependencies are actually not just build dependencies but runtime dependencies.

@@ -1,3 +1,39 @@
+After #30527, it is possible to install Python packages built by the Sage distribution into user-defined venvs.  
+
+As part of `bootstrap`, we now generate the `install_requires` information, `requirements.txt` and `Pipfile` using m4 from the information added in #30719.  These files provide 3 distinct ways of setting up a user-defined venv.
+
+**Testing requirements.txt:**
+
+A virtual environment using it can be created and doctested using:
+
+```
+./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sagelib/src && tox -v -v -v)'
+```
+(Reusing wheels built by the Sage distribution requires to do `sage -i pip2pi` first - this is from #30527.)
+
+**Testing install-requires:**
+
+To test - see instructions in `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/tox.ini`.
+In particular, to use `install_requires` only (and not the concrete requirements from `requirements.txt` first added in #30578 and now generated too), use
+
+```
+./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sagelib/src && tox -v -v -v -e python-norequirements)'
+```

+After #30527, it is possible to install Python packages built by the Sage distribution into user-defined venvs.  
+
+As part of `bootstrap`, we now generate the `pyproject.toml` (PEP 517 metadata) and `install_requires` information, `requirements.txt` and `Pipfile` using m4 from the information added in #30719.  These files provide 3 distinct ways of setting up a user-defined venv.
+
+(Adding `pyproject.toml` does not change how the Sage distribution installs sagelib because `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install` uses `setup.py install` directly.)
+
+To test - see instructions in `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/tox.ini`.
+
+**Testing requirements.txt:**
+
+A virtual environment using it can be created and doctested using:
+
+```
+./bootstrap && ./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sagelib/src && tox -v -v -v python-sagewheels)'
+```
+
+
+**Testing pyproject.toml and install-requires:**

+After #29500, it is possible to install Python packages built by the Sage distribution into user-defined venvs.  
+
+As of Sage 9.3.beta8, `sagelib` is published as a source distribution on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/sagemath-standard), but the package does not have proper dependency information yet. 
+
+As part of `bootstrap`, we now generate (1) the `pyproject.toml` (PEP 517 metadata) and `install_requires` information, (2) `requirements.txt` and (3) `Pipfile` using m4 from the information added in #30719.  These files provide 3 distinct ways of setting up a user-defined venv.
+
+(Adding `pyproject.toml` does not change how the Sage distribution installs sagelib because `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install` uses `setup.py install` directly.)
+
+**To test - use `./bootstrap` and then configure and build the Sage distribution.**  Then follow the instructions in `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/tox.ini`:
