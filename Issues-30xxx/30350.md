(from #19719)

Our version of ATLAS is outdated and has not been tested in a long time. Latest upstream version as of 2021-09-21 is 3.11.40, released 2018-10-02, see â€‹https://github.com/math-atlas/math-atlas/releases

We remove this package.

However, we keep the makefile variable `BLAS` (used in packages' `dependencies` files), rather than hardcoding openblas in dependencies. It will make it easier to plug in another BLAS implementation if one comes along in the future, and it is also needed for #29387.

Here is an attempt. I have questions:
- what to do with `openblas/spkg-configure.m4`? Any changes necessary?
- what about the `spkg-install.in` scripts for `scipy` and `numpy`? They refer to an `ATLAS` environment variable. Leave as is or change?
- I don't know anything about cygwin, so I don't know what to do about the installation instructions referring to ATLAS in `src/doc/en/installation/source.rst`.
Anyway, this is a start.
