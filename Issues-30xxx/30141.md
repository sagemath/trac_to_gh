Currently there is no way in Sage to determine if a dynamical system has potential good reduction.

Following the criterion given by Benedetto in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.6695.pdf, we add a potential_good_reduction function which computes if a dynamical system on projective space of dimension 1 over a number field has potential good reduction.
