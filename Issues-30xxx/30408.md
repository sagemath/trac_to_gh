Adds the current configuration of pycodestyle (as taken from the patchbot) to the src/tox.ini file. Thus, it can be run now locally via the cli `pycodestyle`. Moreover, tools like VS Code can pick it up automatically. The corresponding changes for the patchbot are done in https://github.com/sagemath/sage-patchbot/pull/145.

Documentation will be added in #30361.

I've no experience with tox, and thus cannot decide if this makes sense or not. Feel free to hijack this PR and add the necessary config.

This definitely makes sense! However, the last time I tried to point vscode to the local sage python environment, it didn't work. My hope was that with the inplace compilation it will work.
