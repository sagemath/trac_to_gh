> When applying patches with `--ignore-whitespace` this should work automatically, but only if the diff has LF endings (patch is biased towards unix endings)

no, it does not work - on Debian 10 with its patch I get `different line endings` error.
So the current solution is more or less the only way.

I suppose we might not want to apply all our patches with `--binary`. 

But we can also modify `build/bin/sage-apply-patches` to deal with binary patches (say, files with a particular suffix) by treating them as patches that must be applied with `--binary`.

certainly, I tried it on the converted to the LF-endings patch `build/pkgs/zlib/patches/cygwin-windef.diff_bin` in the branch.

It's seriosly platform-dependent. As you might know, e.g. on macOS the original patch just works.
I won't be surprised if it works on some Linuxes, too.
