`sage.symbolic.expression` accesses `_assumptions` from `sage.symbolic.assumptions` directly.

This should be restructured.

Also (see #30086), the maxima-specific code in `sage.symbolic.assumptions` should be moved into the maxima interface.

We will need to investigate how our various symbolic engines manage assumptions (including variable domains):

- sympy
- pynac
- giac
- maxima
- ...?
