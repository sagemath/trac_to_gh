Adam Larat reported this to sage-devel on 2020-11-04:

```
sage: R1x = PolynomialRing(Integers(2**16+1), ["x"])                            
sage: x = R1x.gen()
sage: P = x**3 - 27
sage: set_verbose(2)
sage: P.small_roots(epsilon=0.9)                                                
verbose 2 (<module>) epsilon = 0
...
```

The reported value of epsilon is wrong. The solution is to change `%d` to `%f` in the `small_roots()` function.
