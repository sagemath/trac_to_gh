<a id='comment:6'></a>It turns out that testing what I really want to test is tricky:

* I originally wanted to test that an error is raised when findstat is down.

* using `badurl.example.com` or the like does not test this, because the domain does not exist.  In this case `request` also throws nested errors, which are hard to catch.

Therefore, I test something else, which makes more sense to test anyway.

if I only threw the `JSONDecodeError`, the message would simply be

```
JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
```
which wouldn't be helpful at all.

Thus I want to provide the `response.text`, which in this example would be the html of the frontpage of findstat.  Seeing this, I would immediately know that I forgot `api` in the url, which is a `ValueError`, I think.
