Its recommended to check in some VS Code config files (which makes it easier for new users to start developing).

We configure it to use the Sage venv via the `configure`-generated symlink `SAGE_ROOT/venv` (from #32442)

The `.gitignore` configuration follows  https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/python,visualstudiocode

<a id='comment:19'></a>If you plan to change from the pipenv to the sage venv, please also make sure that all dev-packages are included in the latter enviroment: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/fec55234a00e46d023ad583f8c6284b970141ab0/src/Pipfile#L6-L15
These are needed to use all features of VS code properly (linting, jupyter notebook support, etc). While working on the pipenv enviroment I've added those packages, but didn't double-check if they are included in the sage distribution (since they are meant only for developers, and not for actual distribution). 

Also for clarification: the sage venv can be configured to have an editable install, right?

Well, a `.venv` according to this common convention would lie in `SAGE_ROOT/src/` or perhaps in `SAGE_ROOT/pkgs/sagemath-standard/`, i.e., at the root of a Python distribution tree -- not in `SAGE_ROOT`, so it's not just a matter of renaming.

I know it's hard to explain in text - but I have trouble understanding how to do the
1st 2 items. (we can have a video call via google meet or so, so that I can see the screen and
the cursor...)

By `It should "just work"` - do you mean the jupyter thing?
Well, I can browse (and view, nicely) Sage's jupyter notebooks in vscode, but not run, as I don't see a way to select the right kernel, and it's now shown in the menu.

I sometimes use vscode as an IDE to write markdown or LaTeX (or Lean :-)), but never for other things, so far.

<a id='comment:40'></a>For the virtual env, you should have something like `Pytohn 3.8.10 ('venv': venv)` in the lower left corner 
![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/python/environments/selected-interpreter-status-bar.png)

With this ticket, this is now the default and can be changed as described in https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_select-and-activate-an-environment.


For testing, vscode should now look for pytests instead of the "Configure Python tests" window that you get normally after activating the test icon (with the red border)

![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/python/testing/test-explorer-no-tests.png)

For jupyter, it may work if you have jupter installed in the sage venv and then select it as the kernel as described here https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_create-or-open-a-jupyter-notebook.
There are also config options to do this by default, but I've not yet looked into this.
For basic things, this is working for me, but I'm not sure about e.g. sage syntax etc.

<a id='comment:41'></a>OK, I'm getting somewhere with Jupyter.

This time I started with opening the SAGE_ROOT "folder", clicked on "trust the author", and only after that, opened a Sage Jupyter notebook.

Now, the Sage kernel shows up in the kernel list, and if I choose it, then after a while (~10 sec or more, I thought it just hangs, at first) it loads and everything works.
Opening it next time is a bit faster. (I'm on a slow net now, and maybe it's phoning back?!).

Anyhow, these details (about opening folger and blessing it) should be added to wiki, or docs, something like this.

Otherwise, good!

as vscode is getting dominant, hiding from the public that we have these binding in Sage is kind of silly.

we do have binding for jupyter(lab), and something for emacs too, so it's not setting up a precedent.
