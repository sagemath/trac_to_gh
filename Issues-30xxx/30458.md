We simplify obtaining the inclusion maximal faces in the function
`get_next_level` by outsourcing to new function `is_contained_in_one`.

In addition we implement `contains_one` for #30040.

This ticket merges cleanly with #30435.

Keywords: code duplication, combinatorial polyhedron

<a id='comment:5'></a>The functions `inline int is_contained_in_one` (with or without `skip`)
have this fine description:

```
     Return whether ``face`` is contained in one of ``faces``.
```

Descriptions for the functions `contains_one` (with or without `skip`)
have a problem:

```diff
 inline int contains_one(uint64_t *face, uint64_t **faces, size_t n_faces, size_t face_length){
     /*
-    Return whether ``face`` contains in one of ``faces``.
+    Return whether ``face`` contains one of ``faces``.
     */
```

```diff

     /*
