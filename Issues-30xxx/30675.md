As per #30596#comment:4, #30596 leads to some missing symbols in linking on Gentoo with gcc-10.

The first consequence of it, is failing to build the documentation:

```

```

Only 3 symbols from `bitset_intrinsics.h` are missing

```

```
Declaring those three inline functions as `static` fix the problem. This probably implies that the `inline` keyword semantic from C99+ is involved.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Ok, I think I understand now.

This helped me:

http://gudok.xyz/inline/

It seems that there are three solutions to this:

- declare the function as `static`, as you did
- add a file `bitset_intrinsics.c` and declare the functions in there `extern inline ...`; I don't know how well this plays with cython
- go for C++ and should be fine

I must say, I am still wondering why just those 3. But if we are both in agreement that they should all be made static then I'll do that. I hadn't thought of doing a debug version but yes it should be more revealing.
