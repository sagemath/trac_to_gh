Building the `maxima` documentation requires a newer version of `makeinfo` than the default one on OS X — see #30063. So let's add the version from `homebrew` to the path, if it is available.

This is not the right place for it - the texinfo package does not provide a system ecl.
This should either go to `build/pkgs/homebrew.txt`, or there should be a new script package like `build/pkgs/libnauty` or `build/pkgs/perl_cpan_polymake_prereq/` that is only there for advertising the system package.
