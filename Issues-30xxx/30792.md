This is not the right place for it - the texinfo package does not provide a system ecl.
This should either go to `build/pkgs/homebrew.txt`, or there should be a new script package like `build/pkgs/libnauty` or `build/pkgs/perl_cpan_polymake_prereq/` that is only there for advertising the system package.
