#22760 added support for `__matmul__` in the coercion model.

We should start using it.

First step: Review the semantics of this operator in major Python software for matrix and tensor computation (NumPy, Numba, TensorFlow, PyTorch, ...) so that we do not paint ourselves into a corner.

Follow-up tickets:
- #32212 `sage.geometry.hyperbolic_space`

I think in most cases we *don't* need it. In a matrix algebra, it's pretty clear that multiplication means matrix multiplication; not Hadamard product.

The first place I'd see a possible application is for self-maps of a ring, where one may want to consider both composition and point-wise products.

I also think it's very inefficient for multivariate Kronecker products, because the infix notation necessitates the construction of intermediate results.

For modules, I would expect tensor products and homs to be equally prevalent, so keeping a symmetry in their notation seems like a desirable thing to have.

So, I think "@" is a poor fit for tensor product.

However, I thought the coercion framework was designed to also handle actions. For example, you need coercion for `z * A` when `z` is an integer but `A` only has a `QQ`-action. I also thought the coercion framework was what called the different actions to see what was appropriate too.\n\n\nIndeed, some coercion steps are possible for actions, but not nearly as much as for operations internal to structures. For instance, for addition between `ZZ[x,y]` and `QQ[z]`, the coercion system will construct a common covering structure `QQ[x,y,z]` by combining a sequence of \"construction functors\" according to certain (heuristic!) rules. I don't think the rules for actions are nearly as advanced -- probably no coercions on the acted-upon set are tried at all; and probably shouldn't.\n\nI'd hope there are better tools available for exploring what coercion to take than to query and see \"what works\".

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A15):
> I don't think there is any harm in #22760 by adding the hook for it. However, I thought the coercion framework was designed to also handle actions. For example, you need coercion for `z * A` when `z` is an integer but `A` only has a `QQ`-action. I also thought the coercion framework was what called the different actions to see what was appropriate too.


Indeed, some coercion steps are possible for actions, but not nearly as much as for operations internal to structures. For instance, for addition between `ZZ[x,y]` and `QQ[z]`, the coercion system will construct a common covering structure `QQ[x,y,z]` by combining a sequence of "construction functors" according to certain (heuristic!) rules. I don't think the rules for actions are nearly as advanced -- probably no coercions on the acted-upon set are tried at all; and probably shouldn't.

I'd hope there are better tools available for exploring what coercion to take than to query and see "what works". If that's actually what happens, then applying it to partial operators such as composition is definitely inappropriate.

In general, I'm not so sure coercion will help for `@` if it goes the composition route, and then having the hook in the system is going to be counterproductive, because people will stumble on it and do unhelpful things with it. So I disagree with the idea that putting hooks just in case someone finds a use for it is harmless. Not making a design decision on it now can also mean not making a design mistake now. Avoiding mistakes has benefits.
