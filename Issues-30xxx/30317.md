Tickets with package changes need `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url` until the ticket has been merged into the next beta (which is when the release manager uploads the tarballs to the mirrors).

If you are asking why we bypass proper package management by pip and install things in the most basic way using `pip --ignore-installed --verbose --no-deps --no-index` (see `build/bin/sage-pip-install`)... let's just say that it is the result of design decisions made a long time ago based on implementation constraints that were valid at that time - but no longer bind us now.

I am hoping that we can make the installation of Python packages more straightforward in the Sage 9.3 cycle. #29500 (Install all Python packages via pip wheel) is a step in this direction.

I haven't looked at pipenv in detail; pipfile looks like it is far from a stable version
