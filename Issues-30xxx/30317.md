I tried this as recommended in #30459, but it fails with "Error downloading pip-20.2.2.tar.gz" because this version of pip cannot be found on any of the sage mirrors apparently. Do I have to change something before running this branch?

Just out of interest, what is the reason for this spkg infrastructure over say pipenv + pipfile?

Tickets with package changes need `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url` until the ticket has been merged into the next beta (which is when the release manager uploads the tarballs to the mirrors).

Replying to [@tobiasdiez](#comment:7):
> Just out of interest, what is the reason for this spkg infrastructure over say pipenv + pipfile?

If you are asking why we bypass proper package management by pip and install things in the most basic way using `pip --ignore-installed --verbose --no-deps --no-index` (see `build/bin/sage-pip-install`)... let's just say that it is the result of design decisions made a long time ago based on implementation constraints that were valid at that time - but no longer bind us now.

I am hoping that we can make the installation of Python packages more straightforward in the Sage 9.3 cycle. #29500 (Install all Python packages via pip wheel) is a step in this direction.

I haven't looked at pipenv in detail; pipfile looks like it is far from a stable version
