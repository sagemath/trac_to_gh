Currently the implementation of `mirror_image` doesn't guarantee that it behaves as an involution. Furthermore, it inverts the orientation, as well, if it uses the braid. The following example may explain this:

```
sage: L = Link([[6, 2, 7, 1], [5, 13, 6, 12], [8, 3, 9, 4],
....:           [2, 13, 3, 14], [14, 8, 15, 7], [11, 17, 12, 16],
....:           [9, 18, 10, 11], [17, 10, 18, 5], [4, 16, 1, 15]]) # L9n25{0}{0} from KnotInfo
sage: Lm = L.mirror_image()
sage: bm = Lm.braid()
sage: Lmm = Lm.mirror_image()
sage: L == Lmm
False
sage: b   = L.braid()
sage: bmm = Lmm.braid()
sage: b.is_conjugated(bmm)   # the closure of bmm is L9n25{1}{0}
False
sage: t = list(bmm.Tietze()); t
[-2, 3, -2, 3, -1, 2, -1, 2, -1]
sage: t.reverse(); t
[-1, 2, -1, 2, -1, 3, -2, 3, -2]
sage: bmmr = bmm.parent()(tuple(t))
sage: b.is_conjugated(bmmr)
True
```



I suggest the following:

1. Let the user decide whether `mirror_image` should use the braid or the pd_code for the calculation.
2. Remove the orientation inversion (in the case of the usage of the braid).
3. Introduce a new method `reverse` that just does the inversion of the orientation. This will enable the user to obtain all four symmetry mutants of a link.
4. Implement according methods `mirror_image` and `reverse` for braids on which the link implementation can depend on.
