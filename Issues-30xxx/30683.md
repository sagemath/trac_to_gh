In [https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3787](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3787) the authors define a new generalization to the Tamari lattice which they name the `\nu`-Tamari lattice. These are paths which are weakly above a (fixed given) path (named `\nu`). This ticket aims to add Nu Dyck Words (paths weakly above a given path) in addition to the Nu Tamari Lattice.

I wasn't sure if I wanted to incorporate Dyck words and the generalized Tamari lattice into this or not, so for now I haven't and wanted to get others' opinions before doing that. In addition, that could be a separate ticket potentially as a "future" goal.
