This ticket implements the basics of symplectic structures,
like Poisson brackets and Hamiltonian vector fields.

TODO (as follow-up tickets):
- Extract general coordinate stuff from `EuclideanSpace`
  to new class `VectorSpace`, and let `SymplecticVectorSpace`
  derive from `VectorSpace`

I am still busy with other things, but as soon as I have some free time, I could go through your code. However, it would be good to at least remove unneccessary methods (like e.g. `hodge_star` or `sqrt_abs_det`) to make the code much more readable and seek your new features immediately.

I noticed that you already added typing. I think, this belongs to another ticket, namely #29775, and should be discussed there before we apply it to new things. There is still this issue with pyflakes and it seems there are still different opinions.

The use of `...Paral` is of course necessary since structures on manifolds are "glued together" via parallelizable parts. I agree in so far that there is no explicit need to expose it to the user since this is all managed via methods in `manifold.py`, that's right. Howver, in my opinion, there's also nothing wrong about it. Since this is a general problem not only restricted to symplectic forms, I suggest you open another ticket if you want to discuss it.

I swiftly overviewed your code. It's a nice addition! However, I have some comments:

- I think, this is redundant:

```diff
         PseudoRiemannianMetric._del_derived(self)
+        self._del_inverse()
 
     def _del_inverse(self):
```

    The method `_del_inverse` is already invoked in `PseudoRiemannianMetric._del_derived`.

- I am not sure that `sharp` and `flat` are proper names for lowering/raising the index w.r.t. a symplectic structure, I presume they are reserved for metrics only. `raise` and `lower` sounds more appropriate to me.

- In my opinion this change is not necessary either:

```diff
     """
-    def __init__(self, n, name, field, structure, base_manifold=None,
+    def __init__(self, n, name, field='real', structure=RealDifferentialStructure(), base_manifold=None,
                  diff_degree=infinity, latex_name=None, start_index=0,
                  category=None, unique_tag=None):
```

    The default input is already managed by the factory method `Manifolds`. And in my opinion, it should stay there for maintenance reasons.

- It would be good to add a new category for symplectic manifolds and also a new structure in `manifolds/structure.py`. Besides, I am not sure, is it possible to combine structures? Symplectic and pseudo-Riemannian structures certainly do not exclude each other. If not, I think this is something we should attack at some point. The more structures we allow, the more flexible the framework has to be.

- I still think that starting with Poisson manifolds is a more reasonable approach. Anyway, someone always has to have the time to do it.

Symplectic structures are certainly a nice addition to Sage! Thank you for contributing to this. 

I gave a look to the code, but I have to say that in the current state, it is hardly readable for me, because the docstrings are simply copied from other files, without any cleaning nor adaptation of the doctests to the new features introduced here. Can I suggest that you move forward and provide a first version with some minimal documentation and doctests, cleaning out what does not pertain to this ticket.

`SymplecticFormParal` is not exposed to the user, since the interface should not be via the class names but rather via a method `M.symplectic_form()` of the manifold `M`, which returns a `SymplecticFormParal` if `M` is parallelizable and a `SymplecticForm` otherwise.

Besides, I agree with Michael's remarks in [comment:2](#comment:2).

Agreed! Not sure why I added it in the first place, but I've now reverted this change.

The terminology sharp and flat (as well as musical isomorphisms) is standard in symplectic geometry, too. See for example Abraham Marsden Foundations of Mechanics.

I think, it's strange if the constructor requires more data than actually is required. Although that might be a matter of taste, but I find `M = TopologicalManifold(2, 'M')` more readable than `M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')`.

The more structures we allow, the more flexible the framework has to be.

Agreed! But I would like to leave the categorical questions to a follow-up ticket!

I'm working on it.

 This PR adds symplectic structures. It's not yet completely finished, but the basic things like Poisson brackets and Hamiltonian vector fields already work. 
 
 I would like to get some initial feedback, before I cleanup the code and documentation. One thing that really bugs me is that one has to use `SymplecticFormParal` instead of `SymplecticForm` if the manifold has a global frame (see for example the test.py file, line 88). For me `SymplecticFormParal` is only a implementation detail, so I don't actually want to expose it to the user. Any ideas? (probably needs some modifications in the tensorfield.restrict method).

I agree, but the reason for using the function `Manifold` instead of a direct call to a specific class, like `TopologicalManifold`, is to not clutter Sage's global namespace, which is already very large. Likewise, at the user level, one has to use `Manifold(..., structure='symplectic')` instead of `SymplecticManifold(...)`.

Ok, makes sense!

I've continued working on it, introduced Poisson structures, wrote most of the documentation and introduced a few tests. It's not yet finished, but if you have a spare minute I would like to get feedback.

A few questions:
- I get the following error message. What's the origin, and what do I have to do to make it work?

```
src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/symplectic_form.py:973: in poisson
    if frame not in self._poisson._components:
sage/structure/element.pyx:493: in sage.structure.element.Element.__getattr__
    ???
sage/structure/element.pyx:506: in sage.structure.element.Element.getattr_from_category
    ???
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 

>   ???
E   AttributeError: 'SymplecticVectorSpace_with_category' object has no attribute '__custom_name'
```

- I'm still somewhat confused by the subclasses that handle the structure on a parallelizable manifold. For example, in the symplectic form class I create the Poisson tensor, give it a name etc. 

```
poisson_name = f'poisson_{self._name}'
poisson_latex_name = f'{self._latex_name}^{{-1}}'
self._poisson = PoissonTensorField(self._vmodule, poisson_name, poisson_latex_name)
```
How do I make sure that it derives from `TensorFieldParal` if the manifold is parallelizable? I can of course put the same code in `SymplecticFormParal` and replace `PoissonTensorField` by `PoissonTensorFieldParal` but this appears to be somewhat subopmimal.

Moreover, do I have to copy-paste the documentation from the parent class, or what is the convention?

- How do I obtain a general function on a manifold? On a vector space M, I can do something like

```
q, p = M.cartesian_coordinates()[:]
f = M.scalar_field(function('f')(q,p), name='f')
```
but what would be the version on a sphere (in such a way that the code works for M being a vector space and a sphere)?

- Since the hodge star operator makes sense also with respect to a symplectic form, I would propose to move the current method from `Metric` to `DifferentialForm`: `DifferentialForm.hodge_star(Metric|SymplecticForm)` (with an alias in `Metric` and `SymplecticForm`). Opinions?

- What is the best way to test if two differential forms are equal (including / except of their name)?

Thanks!

You should construct the Poisson tensor from the module of vector fields on the manifold, not by a direct call to `PoissonTensorField`, see the example of `DifferentiableManifold.metric()` in `src/sage/manifods/differentiable/manifold.py`.

I don't understand the question, sorry. Could you rephrase it?

The symbolic functions created by `function(...)` are functions of coordinates on a given chart; so to construct a generic function on a manifold, you have to pass a dictionary with as many charts as necessary to cover the manifold:

```
   f = M.scalar_field({X1: function('f_1')(q1, p1), X2: function('f_2')(q2, p2),...})
```
where `X1` is the chart with coordinates `(q1, p1)`, etc.

The Hodge star is already in `DifferentialForm`: it is called `hodge_dual()` there and its code
is simply `return metric.hodge_star(self)`. 

> 
> - What is the best way to test if two differential forms are equal (including / except of their name)?

I would say simply  `a == b`.
This is actually computing `a - b` (in an efficient way, using the full antisymmetry of `a` and `b`'s components) and tests whether the result is zero.

A question from my side: why is this ticket depending on #30901 and #30748 ? In the ticket description you write *Please ignore the dependencies, these are just there so that I can work locally on my PC.* This looks somewhat odd... 

Maybe this is related, but the ticket branch contains the following modified files:

```
-rw-r--r--	.gitignore	9	
-rw-r--r--	src/sage/all.py	6	
-rw-r--r--	src/sage/all_cmdline.py	1

Do they really pertain to this ticket?

If I implement a method in say `PoissonTensorFieldParal` that overrides a method in `PoissonTensorField`, do I have to add documentation/tests/examples to the method in ``PoissonTensorFieldParal` (given that the signature of the method is exactly the same)? 
I think sphinx normally copies the documentation given in the parent class.

Sorry for these (unnessary) changes. The only way I currently have to work on sage is with the virtual environment created in #30371. The compiled cython however only works correctly if the changes of #30901 and #30748 are included. Thus, until these packages are merged, I have to sadly include them as dependencies on all packages I develop...maybe you or Matthias have a better idea for a workaround.


Now all tests are passing (not sure about the doctests), and the only thing left is to change the documentation a bit.

Indeed, this is not the way to do this.

I would suggest to create a clean branch starting from the latest beta and to push that to the ticket only.  Use `git cherry-pick` to get the commits from your branch (with the dependencies that you say you need for running Sage) onto the clean branch.  Push the clean branch to the ticket.

Thank you for your work on this. I will let someone who is more invested in the manifold code give more feedback about the overall implementation and structure. I will focus here on the more technical aspects.

From the patchbot, you have at least one infinite recursion to take care of:

```

You should write all of the docstrings and doctests for all of your methods.

There are a number of formatting issues with your docstrings:

```diff
-TESTS:
+TESTS::
+
     sage: import pytest
     sage: pytest.main("symplectic_vector_space_test.py")
     TODO: add output
```

```diff
     def hamiltonian_vector_field(self, function: DiffScalarField) -> VectorField:
         r"""
         Return the Hamiltonian vector field `X_f` generated by the given function `f: M \to \RR`.
+
-        It is defined by
+        The Hamiltonian vector field is defined by
+
         .. MATH::
 
             X_f = - \varpi^\sharp (d f),
 
         where `\varpi^\sharp: T^* M \to TM` is given by
         `\beta(\varpi^\sharp(\alpha)) = \varpi(\alpha, \beta)`.
 
         INPUT:
+
         - ```function`` -- the function generating the Hamiltonian vector field
```

```
        - ``coordinates`` -- (default: ``'Cartesian'``) the
          type of coordinates to be initialized at the Euclidean space
          creation; allowed values are

          * ``'Cartesian'`` (canonical coordinates on `\RR^{2n}`)
          * ``'polar'`` for ``dimension=2`` only (see
            :meth:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.examples.euclidean.EuclideanPlane.polar_coordinates`)
        - ``symbols`` -- the coordinate
          text symbols and LaTeX symbols, with the same conventions as the
          argument ``coordinates`` in
          ...
```
among others.

I am not sure I agree with using pytest and a test file as opposed to standard docstrings. We are still experimenting with these features.

`poisson_tensor.py` is missing the initial file header info and docstring.

I don't see the reason for the `TYPE_CHECKING`. There are also other ways to add the type info without importing.

I think this docstring is wrong:

```
    def poisson(self, expansion_symbol: Optional[Expression] = None, order: int = 1) -> TensorFieldParal:
        r"""
        Return the inverse metric.
```

What "other ways" do you mean? These imports are encapsulated by a check for `TYPE_CHECKING`, which is false during runtime and is only set to true by static code analyzers. This is needed to prevent circular inputs or imports from half-initialized modules.

Thanks for the pointer to the multivector fields! I've not  been aware of their existence. The poisson tensor now inherits from MultivectorField instead of TensorField.

Since the PoissonTensor class is relatively short, and most changes intertwine Poisson and symplectic things (e.g. the up/down methods) I would like to keep them together.

The `sage.all` imports are needed due to half-finished module imports otherwise. I plan to address this in forthcoming tickets.

Just underlines my argument. ;)

Short code is much easier to review. Besides, since all the symplectic part relies on the Poisson structure, it's good to review that one first.

> The sage.all imports are needed due to half-finished module imports otherwise. I plan to address this in forthcoming tickets. 

What do you mean?

I'd say we should drop these features such as typing, pytest etc. in this ticket for now, otherwise this ticket will stay on hold as long as #30738, #30551, #31003, #29775 etc. and all their follow ups have not been settled.

Taking a look at the discussions, that could take a while, whereas this ticket seems in principle to be ready for review.

Without these imports I get the following error:

Well, it is not only about testing but also about documenting. Keep in mind that `EXAMPLE` blocks occur in the official reference manual and therefore provide a guideline for the user how to use that method adequately aside from testing.

Having the same examples in different places in the documentation isn't necessarily a bad thing. What I usually do is to change some values, dimensions or expressions instead of blindly copy.

While taking a look to the ticket, I've noticed that the relevant documentation was not generated because there was no entry about symplectic structures in Sage's reference manual. In the above commit, I have therefore added the new file

```
src/doc/en/reference/manifolds/poisson_manifold.rst
```
and inserted a reference to it in `index.rst` in the same directory. Then building the documentation failed due to various errors, mostly 
- `EXAMPLES:` to be replaced by `EXAMPLES::` when immediately followed by `sage: ...`
- `.. MATH::` to be followed by a blank line

I fixed those so that the documentation now builds. Note that at the moment (i.e. until #32946 is merged), one cannot use 
`sage -docbuild reference/manifolds html` to quickly generate the relevant part of the reference manual. One has to use `make` instead, which takes much longer time. 

For the references  `[AM1990]` and  `[RS2007]`, I simply turned them into literal text so that the documentation could build; could you please add them in the bibliographic file

<div id="comment:76" align="right">comment:76</div>

A few comments:
- The file `src/sage/all_cmdline.py` should not be touched by this ticket.
- As stated in [comment:2](#comment:2), the changes in `TopologicalManifold.__init__` and `DifferentiableManifold.__init__` should be reverted.
- In the initialization

  ```
  sage: M.<q, p> = EuclideanSpace(2, "R2", r"\mathbb{R}^2", symbols=r"q:q p:p")
  ```
  the arguments `2` and `symbols` are not necessary. This can be shortened to 

  ```
  sage: M.<q,p> = EuclideanSpace(name="R2", latex_name=r"\mathbb{R}^2")
  ```
  Even better, for the sake of clarity, you could use the default in these doctests, since neither the name nor the LaTeX name of the Euclidean space appears:

  ```
  sage: M.<q,p> = EuclideanSpace()
  ```
  See [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/examples/euclidean.html) for details.
- In the examples, the following two lines

  ```
  sage: from sage.manifolds.differentiable.poisson_tensor import PoissonTensorField
  sage: poisson = PoissonTensorField(M, 'varpi')
  ```
  should be replaced by

  ```
  poisson = M.poisson_tensor(name='varpi')
  ```
  since this is the way the end user should use initialize a Poisson tensor.
- Similarly

  ```
  sage: from sage.manifolds.differentiable.symplectic_form import SymplecticForm
  sage: omega = SymplecticForm(M, 'omega', r'\omega')
  ```
  should be replaced by 

  ```
  sage: omega = M.symplectic_form(name='omega', latex_name=r'\omega')
  ```

On a second thought (after this time) I tend to agree with Tobias, though I also see the point of cluttering Sage's namespace.

What if we use the namespace `manifolds`, i.e. `manifolds.TopologicalManifold`, `manifolds.SymplecticManifold`, ..., instead? We already have `manifolds.Sphere`, `manifolds.RealLine`, ..., and it seems quite natural to me adding the above to this namespace, too. This way, we do not clutter the global namespace but maintain the desired convenience. Eric, what do you think?

Of course, this shouldn't be treated in this ticket, rather in a follow-up.

Still have to check for the docs, since building them takes adges...

I've changed it, but think that it still would be useful to have the examples directly for the constructor. It's similar to what I've mentioned above, but why should `M.poisson_tensor` be superior to `PoissonTensor(M)`? Sure for a normal sage user the first is more convient, as you don't have to import anything. But if you use sage more as a python library, than the latter is maybe your preferred way.

So this ticket here is only using existing infrastructure. Note also that pytest is not essentially used - it only provides consistency and more detailed tests of special cases, every method still has \"normal\" examples in their documentation. The longterm idea is to make pytest a standard package, see #31110. But for this one needs to collect experience with its usage in sage. For example, as you point out the coverage tools needs improvement to be still useful with pytest. I've opened #32994 to keep track of this. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nI thought ticket dependencies are a natural element of the sage workflow. Since you collectively don't liked them, I've now added a few doctests instead of using the proposed `TEST: pytest` syntax proposed in #32975.

Pytest is already an optional package for a long time, and it has been integrated in the usual `sage -t` command in #31003. So this ticket here is only using existing infrastructure. Note also that pytest is not essentially used - it only provides consistency and more detailed tests of special cases, every method still has "normal" examples in their documentation. The longterm idea is to make pytest a standard package, see #31110. But for this one needs to collect experience with its usage in sage. For example, as you point out the coverage tools needs improvement to be still useful with pytest. I've opened #32994 to keep track of this. Thanks for the suggestion.

I thought ticket dependencies are a natural element of the sage workflow. Since you collectively don't liked them, I've now added a few doctests instead of using the proposed `TEST: pytest` syntax proposed in #32975. Once this ticket is merged one could revert to that syntax as a follow-up. The dependency on #32953 can indeed be removed thanks to the fix by Eric.

Thanks for the changes. It seems that we are converging ;-)

A few more points:

- The macro `\contr` in the docstring of `hamiltonian_vector_field` is not recognized by LaTeX: this produces a red literal `\contr` in the html documentation and breaks the pdf documentation, as you can easily check by running `sage -docbuild reference/manifolds pdf` (this works, no need to wait for #32946, which regards only the html documentation).
- The docstring of `SymplecticFormParal` shall not start by `TODO`
- The unnecessary import `from sage.manifolds.structure import RealDifferentialStructure` should be removed from `differentiable/manifold.py`. 
- The line containing `_dim: int` should be removed from `manifolds/manifold.py` (in other words, the file `manifolds/manifold.py` should not be touched by this ticket)
- It seems to me that the files `symplectic_form_test.py` and `symplectic_vector_space_test.py` should be removed from this ticket, until #32975 is settled. They are triggering coverage and puflakes errors and are no used in the current test framework.

Should be fixed now. I cannot test this, as building the PDF also doesn't work for me:
RuntimeError: failed to run $MAKE all-pdf in /home/tobias/sage/local/share/doc/sage/latex/en/reference/manifolds

Nicely spotted!

Done!

It's needed in order to not get typing issues in the new symplectic forms file. I know that there is no check in place (yet?) to verify that all (new) code adheres to typing standards, but I think its good practice to let the typing evolve as one works on the code. Also typing errors are shown as errors for me in VS and as I will be probably the person working on the symplectic code the most in the near future, I would strongly prefer to have such errors as little as possible.

I looked at that reference, and page 128 calls the maps "raising" and "lowering". But other sources do use the terminology "the sharp of ..." and "the flat of ..." for the results of these operations. Other things equal, I think for method names one should prefer verbs. So I would be in favor of `raise()` and `lower()` as well. Just my 2 cents

The documentation was broken due to some indentation issue in the bullet list of some `INPUT` blocks. This is fixed in the above commit. In addition, I've 
- corrrected some cut-and-paste typos 
- added docstests to `__init__` methods, which had no longer any
- changed the doctests of `PoissonTensorField`, `SymplecticForm` and `VectorFieldModule.poisson_tensor` and `VectorFieldModule.symplectic_form` from the Euclidean space to the 2-sphere, since we need here non-parallelizable manifolds (otherwise, the doctest is actually not testing the said method)
- added some hyperlink to the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket

A question: in the definition of a symplectic form given in the docstring of `SymplecticForm`, shouldn't one add that `\omega` must be closed?

Here are some further comments:

- I'd raise an error if the dimension of a symplectic vector space is not even, similarly as you did for symplectic forms.
- Rather a comment than a necessity to change:

```diff
             if latex_name is None:
-                latex_name = "\\omega"
+                latex_name = r"\omega"
```

- Some very minor comments on the documentation:

```diff
         INPUT:

-        - ``f`` -- first function
-        - ``g`` -- second function
+        - ``f`` -- function inserted in the first slot
+        - ``g`` -- function inserted in the second slot
```

```diff
     def volume_form(self, contra: int = 0) -> TensorField:
         r"""
         Liouville volume form `\omega^n` associated with the symplectic form `\omega`,
-        where `2n` is the dimension of the manifold).
+        where `2n` is the dimension of the manifold.
-        TODO: Decide about normalization
```

- I am not sure whether a TODO is supposed to be in the documentation part. I probably would prefer it somewhere in the code. Nevertheless, it'd be nice if you could elaborate a bit more what that is supposed to mean. E.g. if it's a decision, present possible choices. I personally see those snippets as reminder for me and/or as a teaser for other developers who might want to attack this. (As for the former, I tend to forget what I meant by those things if I keep it too vague. :P)

These are just very minor things. If you want to change it, nice. If not, don't worry.

The new class is called `SymplecticVectorSpace` but as far as I can see there is no vector space structure implemented: Elements are points and cannot be added or scaled.

Perhaps, if it's not too late for this change, it should be called just `SymplecticSpace` (similar to `EuclideanSpace`) and we reserve the name `SymplecticVectorSpace` for later.

I was wondering about this too, but in the end decided for the built-in factorial since the numbers for which one calculates this are very small (and are dominated by the n-th wedge product anyway). So I used the factorial from math to not pull-in some dependencies.

We will have to be very careful with the design of this so that we do not add a 4th incompatible implementation of finite-dimensional vector spaces in Sage in this way. (We already have 3, implemented in `sage.modules`, `sage.combinat.free_module`, and `sage.tensor.modules`, respectively, see the constructor in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modules/sage/modules/free_module.html#sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule)

That's why I would urge to set the vector space side of things aside and only focus on the (affine) symplectic space here on this ticket. 

The relation of 
- free modules with a symplectic form to `SymplecticSpace` 
- free modules with a positive definite form to `EuclideanSpace`
should be done in one follow up ticket.

In the current state, `SymplecticVectorSpace` is simply a subclass of `EuclideanSpace`, which is fine at this stage. Maybe, following  Matthias' recommendation, just rename it to `AffineSymplecticSpace` (despite there is no affine structure explicitly implemented). IMHO, `SymplecticSpace` would be too general, sounding like a synonym for `SymplecticManifold`.

Besides, I agree with Michael: import `factorial` as in `diff_form.py`.

To keep the old behavior of `hodge_dual`, I'd suggest to fall back on the metric if no input has been given, otherwise an `AttributeError` will be thrown (which didn't happen before):

```diff
         from sage.functions.other import factorial
         from sage.tensor.modules.format_utilities import format_unop_txt, \
                                                          format_unop_latex

         p = self.tensor_type()[1]
         eps = nondegenerate_tensor.volume_form(p)
```

Accordingly, this behavior should be documented.

has a flat metric `g`. The Euclidean scalar product is then that defined
by the Riemannian metric `g`.
```

From that viewpoint, since you derive from `EuclideanSpace`, it is only natural to view your implementation as an affine symplectic space.

To make it a "proper" affine space, one only needs to implement lines, easy to do.

On the other hand, to make it a vector space, one would need to identify the space with its tangent space -- so that the bilinear form can be applied to elements of the space.

I think, affinness is sufficiently represented by:

Well, you just declare the chart to be a linear isomorphism and your done carrying all the (vector space) structure over from Rn. Also easy ;-)
To be precise, the new "SymplecticVectorSpace" class currently represents  nothing else then R2n with a fixed basis and its canonical symplectic form, with addition and scalar multiplation forgotten/not yet implemented. You could view this as an abstract affine symplectic space with a chart; but in order to define a chart on an affine space one needs to choose a base point and a basis.

For these reasons I really like the idea

Should I go ahead and rename everything?

The documentation is at least claiming this, but EuclideanSpace is also not a proper affine space either. You cannot subtract elements (at least I couldn't figure out how) and there is only one chart - but on an affine space you don't have a canonical chart; and once you fix a base point you have a vector space. Moreover, what are "polar coordinates" on an affine space? I think "EuclideanSpace" is also just Rn with its Euclidean metric, so maybe it should be renamed to StandardEuclideanSpace in a follow-up ticket?

Actually, the documentation is not claiming that `EuclideanSpace` is an affine space, because the sentence just after the quoted one in [comment:134](#comment:134) is 

```
The current implementation of Euclidean spaces is based on the second point 
of view.
```
This second point of view is that of a Riemannian manifold, not of an affine space.

Otherwise, we have to rename `Euclidean space` to `Euclidean vector space`, too. Which wouldn't make sense to me due to the aforementioned reasons.

Well, the Euclidean space is abbreviated with `E^n` and not `R^n`. Perhaps we should do the same here, too?

At least until we have the vector space structure on Euclidean space (though, I'd personally prefer an affine structure).

In my head, these things make perfect sense for me:

- Euclidean space in Sage is an affine vector space.
- The symplectic space above is an affine space, too, endowed with a symplectic structure.
- As for the vector space structure, I think we should link the Euclidean space to preexisting vector spaces endowed with bilinear forms.

I am open to suggestions, different opinions and arguments. :)

But that's not for this ticket.

To do this, simply add

to the file `src/sage/manifolds/catalog.py` (see e.g. the example of `Sphere` in that file).

The "canonical" example of this is the real numbers. In implementations, we run up against things that are not quite mathematical, but we have to deal with the realities of finite and explicit computations.
