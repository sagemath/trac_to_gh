CC:  @tscrim @nthiery @mjungmath @egourgoulhon @mkoeppe

This ticket implements the basics of symplectic structures,
like Poisson brackets and Hamiltonian vector fields.

TODO (as follow-up tickets):
- Extract general coordinate stuff from `EuclideanSpace`
  to new class `VectorSpace`, and let `SymplecticVectorSpace`
  derive from `VectorSpace`

In my humble opinion, I think the very first step should be to establish a *Poisson manifold*. This is much more general, i.e. symplectic structures / manifolds are special cases of them. Since none of these are implemented yet, it is much easier to start with the more general setup.

I am still busy with other things, but as soon as I have some free time, I could go through your code. However, it would be good to at least remove unneccessary methods (like e.g. `hodge_star` or `sqrt_abs_det`) to make the code much more readable and seek your new features immediately.

I noticed that you already added typing. I think, this belongs to another ticket, namely #29775, and should be discussed there before we apply it to new things. There is still this issue with pyflakes and it seems there are still different opinions.

The use of `...Paral` is of course necessary since structures on manifolds are "glued together" via parallelizable parts. I agree in so far that there is no explicit need to expose it to the user since this is all managed via methods in `manifold.py`, that's right. Howver, in my opinion, there's also nothing wrong about it. Since this is a general problem not only restricted to symplectic forms, I suggest you open another ticket if you want to discuss it.

I swiftly overviewed your code. It's a nice addition! However, I have some comments:

- I think, this is redundant:

```diff
         PseudoRiemannianMetric._del_derived(self)
+        self._del_inverse()
 
     def _del_inverse(self):
```

    The method `_del_inverse` is already invoked in `PseudoRiemannianMetric._del_derived`.

- I am not sure that `sharp` and `flat` are proper names for lowering/raising the index w.r.t. a symplectic structure, I presume they are reserved for metrics only. `raise` and `lower` sounds more appropriate to me.

- In my opinion this change is not necessary either:

```diff
     """
-    def __init__(self, n, name, field, structure, base_manifold=None,
+    def __init__(self, n, name, field='real', structure=RealDifferentialStructure(), base_manifold=None,
                  diff_degree=infinity, latex_name=None, start_index=0,
                  category=None, unique_tag=None):
```

    The default input is already managed by the factory method `Manifolds`. And in my opinion, it should stay there for maintenance reasons.

- It would be good to add a new category for symplectic manifolds and also a new structure in `manifolds/structure.py`. Besides, I am not sure, is it possible to combine structures? Symplectic and pseudo-Riemannian structures certainly do not exclude each other. If not, I think this is something we should attack at some point. The more structures we allow, the more flexible the framework has to be.

- I still think that starting with Poisson manifolds is a more reasonable approach. Anyway, someone always has to have the time to do it.

Symplectic structures are certainly a nice addition to Sage! Thank you for contributing to this. 

I gave a look to the code, but I have to say that in the current state, it is hardly readable for me, because the docstrings are simply copied from other files, without any cleaning nor adaptation of the doctests to the new features introduced here. Can I suggest that you move forward and provide a first version with some minimal documentation and doctests, cleaning out what does not pertain to this ticket.

`SymplecticFormParal` is not exposed to the user, since the interface should not be via the class names but rather via a method `M.symplectic_form()` of the manifold `M`, which returns a `SymplecticFormParal` if `M` is parallelizable and a `SymplecticForm` otherwise.

Besides, I agree with Michael's remarks in comment:2.

Agreed! Not sure why I added it in the first place, but I've now reverted this change.

The terminology sharp and flat (as well as musical isomorphisms) is standard in symplectic geometry, too. See for example Abraham Marsden Foundations of Mechanics.

I think, it's strange if the constructor requires more data than actually is required. Although that might be a matter of taste, but I find `M = TopologicalManifold(2, 'M')` more readable than `M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')`.

I agree, but the reason for using the function `Manifold` instead of a direct call to a specific class, like `TopologicalManifold`, is to not clutter Sage's global namespace, which is already very large. Likewise, at the user level, one has to use `Manifold(..., structure='symplectic')` instead of `SymplecticManifold(...)`.

I can of course put the same code in `SymplecticFormParal` and replace `PoissonTensorField` by `PoissonTensorFieldParal` but this appears to be somewhat subopmimal.\n\nMoreover, do I have to copy-paste the documentation from the parent class, or what is the convention?\n\n- How do I obtain a general function on a manifold?

Ok, makes sense!

I've continued working on it, introduced Poisson structures, wrote most of the documentation and introduced a few tests. It's not yet finished, but if you have a spare minute I would like to get feedback.

A few questions:
- I get the following error message. What's the origin, and what do I have to do to make it work?

```
src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/symplectic_form.py:973: in poisson
    if frame not in self._poisson._components:
sage/structure/element.pyx:493: in sage.structure.element.Element.__getattr__
    ???
sage/structure/element.pyx:506: in sage.structure.element.Element.getattr_from_category
    ???

>   ???
E   AttributeError: 'SymplecticVectorSpace_with_category' object has no attribute '__custom_name'
```

- I'm still somewhat confused by the subclasses that handle the structure on a parallelizable manifold. For example, in the symplectic form class I create the Poisson tensor, give it a name etc. 

```
poisson_name = f'poisson_{self._name}'
poisson_latex_name = f'{self._latex_name}^{{-1}}'
self._poisson = PoissonTensorField(self._vmodule, poisson_name, poisson_latex_name)
```
How do I make sure that it derives from `TensorFieldParal` if the manifold is parallelizable? I can of course put the same code in `SymplecticFormParal` and replace `PoissonTensorField` by `PoissonTensorFieldParal` but this appears to be somewhat subopmimal.

Moreover, do I have to copy-paste the documentation from the parent class, or what is the convention?

- How do I obtain a general function on a manifold? On a vector space M, I can do something like

```
q, p = M.cartesian_coordinates()[:]
f = M.scalar_field(function('f')(q,p), name='f')
```
but what would be the version on a sphere (in such a way that the code works for M being a vector space and a sphere)?

- Since the hodge star operator makes sense also with respect to a symplectic form, I would propose to move the current method from `Metric` to `DifferentialForm`: `DifferentialForm.hodge_star(Metric|SymplecticForm)` (with an alias in `Metric` and `SymplecticForm`). Opinions?

- What is the best way to test if two differential forms are equal (including / except of their name)?

Thanks!

You should construct the Poisson tensor from the module of vector fields on the manifold, not by a direct call to `PoissonTensorField`, see the example of `DifferentiableManifold.metric()` in `src/sage/manifods/differentiable/manifold.py`.

I don't understand the question, sorry. Could you rephrase it?

The symbolic functions created by `function(...)` are functions of coordinates on a given chart; so to construct a generic function on a manifold, you have to pass a dictionary with as many charts as necessary to cover the manifold:

```
   f = M.scalar_field({X1: function('f_1')(q1, p1), X2: function('f_2')(q2, p2),...})
```
where `X1` is the chart with coordinates `(q1, p1)`, etc.

The Hodge star is already in `DifferentialForm`: it is called `hodge_dual()` there and its code
is simply `return metric.hodge_star(self)`.

I would say simply  `a == b`.
This is actually computing `a - b` (in an efficient way, using the full antisymmetry of `a` and `b`'s components) and tests whether the result is zero.

A question from my side: why is this ticket depending on #30901 and #30748 ? In the ticket description you write *Please ignore the dependencies, these are just there so that I can work locally on my PC.* This looks somewhat odd... 

Maybe this is related, but the ticket branch contains the following modified files:

If I implement a method in say `PoissonTensorFieldParal` that overrides a method in `PoissonTensorField`, do I have to add documentation/tests/examples to the method in ``PoissonTensorFieldParal` (given that the signature of the method is exactly the same)? 
I think sphinx normally copies the documentation given in the parent class.

Sorry for these (unnessary) changes. The only way I currently have to work on sage is with the virtual environment created in #30371. The compiled cython however only works correctly if the changes of #30901 and #30748 are included. Thus, until these packages are merged, I have to sadly include them as dependencies on all packages I develop...maybe you or Matthias have a better idea for a workaround.


Now all tests are passing (not sure about the doctests), and the only thing left is to change the documentation a bit.

So, I think, I'm mostly finished with the implementation. Some of the doctests may still fail and this will be a bit of a tedious procedure since `sage -t` doesn't work for me locally (need to investigate). But it's definitely in a state where I would appreciate feedback!

Thank you for your work on this. I will let someone who is more invested in the manifold code give more feedback about the overall implementation and structure. I will focus here on the more technical aspects.

From the patchbot, you have at least one infinite recursion to take care of:

You should write all of the docstrings and doctests for all of your methods.

There are a number of formatting issues with your docstrings:

```diff

+TESTS::

     sage: import pytest
     sage: pytest.main("symplectic_vector_space_test.py")
     TODO: add output

```diff

         .. MATH::
 
             X_f = - \varpi^\sharp (d f),
 
         where `\varpi^\sharp: T^* M \to TM` is given by
         `\beta(\varpi^\sharp(\alpha)) = \varpi(\alpha, \beta)`.
 
         INPUT:
+
         - ```function`` -- the function generating the Hamiltonian vector field
```

```
        - ``coordinates`` -- (default: ``'Cartesian'``) the
          type of coordinates to be initialized at the Euclidean space
          creation; allowed values are

          * ``'Cartesian'`` (canonical coordinates on `\RR^{2n}`)
          * ``'polar'`` for ``dimension=2`` only (see
            :meth:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.examples.euclidean.EuclideanPlane.polar_coordinates`)
        - ``symbols`` -- the coordinate
          text symbols and LaTeX symbols, with the same conventions as the
          argument ``coordinates`` in
          ...
```
among others.

I am not sure I agree with using pytest and a test file as opposed to standard docstrings. We are still experimenting with these features.

`poisson_tensor.py` is missing the initial file header info and docstring.

I don't see the reason for the `TYPE_CHECKING`. There are also other ways to add the type info without importing.

I think this docstring is wrong:

```
    def poisson(self, expansion_symbol: Optional[Expression] = None, order: int = 1) -> TensorFieldParal:
        r"""
        Return the inverse metric.
```

What "other ways" do you mean? These imports are encapsulated by a check for `TYPE_CHECKING`, which is false during runtime and is only set to true by static code analyzers. This is needed to prevent circular inputs or imports from half-initialized modules.

Since the PoissonTensor class is relatively short, and most changes intertwine Poisson and symplectic things (e.g. the up/down methods) I would like to keep them together.

Just underlines my argument. ;)

Short code is much easier to review. Besides, since all the symplectic part relies on the Poisson structure, it's good to review that one first.

Without these imports I get the following error:

Well, it is not only about testing but also about documenting. Keep in mind that `EXAMPLE` blocks occur in the official reference manual and therefore provide a guideline for the user how to use that method adequately aside from testing.

Having the same examples in different places in the documentation isn't necessarily a bad thing. What I usually do is to change some values, dimensions or expressions instead of blindly copy.

A few comments:
- The file `src/sage/all_cmdline.py` should not be touched by this ticket.
- As stated in comment:2, the changes in `TopologicalManifold.__init__` and `DifferentiableManifold.__init__` should be reverted.
- In the initialization
  {{{
  sage: M.<q, p> = EuclideanSpace(2, "R2", r"\mathbb{R}^2", symbols=r"q:q p:p")
  }}}
  the arguments `2` and `symbols` are not necessary. This can be shortened to 
  {{{
  sage: M.<q,p> = EuclideanSpace(name="R2", latex_name=r"\mathbb{R}^2")
  }}}
  Even better, for the sake of clarity, you could use the default in these doctests, since neither the name nor the LaTeX name of the Euclidean space appears:
  {{{
  sage: M.<q,p> = EuclideanSpace()
  }}}
  See [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/examples/euclidean.html) for details.
- In the examples, the following two lines
  {{{
  sage: from sage.manifolds.differentiable.poisson_tensor import PoissonTensorField
  sage: poisson = PoissonTensorField(M, 'varpi')
  }}}
  should be replaced by
  {{{
  poisson = M.poisson_tensor(name='varpi')
  }}}
  since this is the way the end user should use initialize a Poisson tensor.
- Similarly
  {{{
  sage: from sage.manifolds.differentiable.symplectic_form import SymplecticForm
  sage: omega = SymplecticForm(M, 'omega', r'\omega')
  }}}
  should be replaced by 
  {{{
  sage: omega = M.symplectic_form(name='omega', latex_name=r'\omega')
  }}}

On a second thought (after this time) I tend to agree with Tobias, though I also see the point of cluttering Sage's namespace.

What if we use the namespace `manifolds`, i.e. `manifolds.TopologicalManifold`, `manifolds.SymplecticManifold`, ..., instead? We already have `manifolds.Sphere`, `manifolds.RealLine`, ..., and it seems quite natural to me adding the above to this namespace, too.

But if you use sage more as a python library, than the latter is maybe your preferred way.\n\n\nIt is something that is associated to the manifold, therefore the API should favor the method. (Contrast this to the exterior algebra, which is not associated to its defining base ring.) Plus it means you do not have to care about it being parallelizeable or not.

It's similar to what I've mentioned above, but why should `M.poisson_tensor` be superior to `PoissonTensor(M)`? Sure for a normal sage user the first is more convient, as you don't have to import anything. But if you use sage more as a python library, than the latter is maybe your preferred way.


It is something that is associated to the manifold, therefore the API should favor the method. (Contrast this to the exterior algebra, which is not associated to its defining base ring.) Plus it means you do not have to care about it being parallelizeable or not. Not only for front-end users because of the lack of import, but we also want people using it as a library to use the method. It also helps avoid a bit circular import hell.

Remove the pytest test and replace them with standard tests. The disassociation with the doctests makes it very easy to miss full coverage (to the point where I have to do a lot of very detailed checking), there are no examples right there in the methods for a future developer to quickly look at, it is a heavier maintenance burden to keep things in sync, and it adds clutter. I also do not want to keep a uniform approach to doctests at this point until there is a large consensus to adopt such a change. This also removes the otherwise unnecessary dependency on #32975.

I looked at that reference, and page 128 calls the maps "raising" and "lowering". But other sources do use the terminology "the sharp of ..." and "the flat of ..." for the results of these operations. Other things equal, I think for method names one should prefer verbs. So I would be in favor of `raise()` and `lower()` as well. Just my 2 cents

The documentation was broken due to some indentation issue in the bullet list of some `INPUT` blocks. This is fixed in the above commit. In addition, I've 
- corrrected some cut-and-paste typos 
- added docstests to `__init__` methods, which had no longer any
- changed the doctests of `PoissonTensorField`, `SymplecticForm` and `VectorFieldModule.poisson_tensor` and `VectorFieldModule.symplectic_form` from the Euclidean space to the 2-sphere, since we need here non-parallelizable manifolds (otherwise, the doctest is actually not testing the said method)
- added some hyperlink to the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket

A question: in the definition of a symplectic form given in the docstring of `SymplecticForm`, shouldn't one add that `\omega` must be closed?

Here are some further comments:

- I'd raise an error if the dimension of a symplectic vector space is not even, similarly as you did for symplectic forms.
- Rather a comment than a necessity to change:

```diff
             if latex_name is None:
-                latex_name = "\\omega"
+                latex_name = r"\omega"
```

- Some very minor comments on the documentation:

```diff
         INPUT:

-        - ``f`` -- first function
-        - ``g`` -- second function
+        - ``f`` -- function inserted in the first slot
+        - ``g`` -- function inserted in the second slot
```

```diff
     def volume_form(self, contra: int = 0) -> TensorField:
         r"""
         Liouville volume form `\omega^n` associated with the symplectic form `\omega`,
-        where `2n` is the dimension of the manifold).
+        where `2n` is the dimension of the manifold.
-        TODO: Decide about normalization
```

- I am not sure whether a TODO is supposed to be in the documentation part. I probably would prefer it somewhere in the code. Nevertheless, it'd be nice if you could elaborate a bit more what that is supposed to mean. E.g. if it's a decision, present possible choices.

That's true. As written in the ticket description, the plan is to provide a "vector space as a manifold" example that should be used as the base class for `SymplecticVectorSpace`.

> .. or perhaps AffineSymplecticSpace. 


Not sure if one needs this generalization, and even then one probably wants to say that its an affine space modeled on a symplectic vector space.

I was wondering about this too, but in the end decided for the built-in factorial since the numbers for which one calculates this are very small (and are dominated by the n-th wedge product anyway). So I used the factorial from math to not pull-in some dependencies.
But I can change this of course.

We will have to be very careful with the design of this so that we do not add a 4th incompatible implementation of finite-dimensional vector spaces in Sage in this way. (We already have 3, implemented in `sage.modules`, `sage.combinat.free_module`, and `sage.tensor.modules`, respectively, see the constructor in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/modules/sage/modules/free_module.html#sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule)

That's why I would urge to set the vector space side of things aside and only focus on the (affine) symplectic space here on this ticket. 

The relation of 
- free modules with a symplectic form to `SymplecticSpace` 
- free modules with a positive definite form to `EuclideanSpace`
should be done in one follow up ticket.

In the current state, `SymplecticVectorSpace` is simply a subclass of `EuclideanSpace`, which is fine at this stage. Maybe, following  Matthias' recommendation, just rename it to `AffineSymplecticSpace` (despite there is no affine structure explicitly implemented). IMHO, `SymplecticSpace` would be too general, sounding like a synonym for `SymplecticManifold`.

Besides, I agree with Michael: import `factorial` as in `diff_form.py`.

All points on a manifold are already uniquely determined in terms of charts. In fact, due to the manifold structure, specifying a manifold by its points or by its charts is equivalent.

But its currently neither an affine nor a vector space... so the question would be: should sage (at some point) has a proper implementation of an affine symplectic space or of a symplectic vector space? In my opinion, for practical purposes, the vector version should be sufficient - if you really only have an affine space, then just don't use the fact that you could add vectors. 

Even if we should go with affine symplectic, how would one express the fact that the chart depends on a choice of a base point?

To make it a "proper" affine space, one only needs to implement lines, easy to do.

On the other hand, to make it a vector space, one would need to identify the space with its tangent space -- so that the bilinear form can be applied to elements of the space.

Well, you just declare the chart to be a linear isomorphism and your done carrying all the (vector space) structure over from Rn. Also easy ;-)
To be precise, the new "SymplecticVectorSpace" class currently represents  nothing else then R2n with a fixed basis and its canonical symplectic form, with addition and scalar multiplation forgotten/not yet implemented. You could view this as an abstract affine symplectic space with a chart; but in order to define a chart on an affine space one needs to choose a base point and a basis.

For these reasons I really like the idea

The documentation is at least claiming this, but EuclideanSpace is also not a proper affine space either. You cannot subtract elements (at least I couldn't figure out how) and there is only one chart - but on an affine space you don't have a canonical chart; and once you fix a base point you have a vector space.

Actually, the documentation is not claiming that `EuclideanSpace` is an affine space, because the sentence just after the quoted one in comment:134 is 

```
The current implementation of Euclidean spaces is based on the second point 
of view.
```
This second point of view is that of a Riemannian manifold, not of an affine space.

+        return f"Standard symplectic vector space {self._name}"
```

This looks like cheating to me. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the whole point that this implementation does **not** constitute a vector space? This would still leave the impression to the user that they can add/substract or scale points.

For the sake of consistency, I opt for:

```diff
-        return f"Standard symplectic vector space {self._name}"
+        return f"Standard symplectic space {self._name}"
```

Otherwise, we have to rename `Euclidean space` to `Euclidean vector space`, too. Which wouldn't make sense to me due to the aforementioned reasons.

Well, the Euclidean space is abbreviated with `E^n` and not `R^n`. Perhaps we should do the same here, too?

At least until we have the vector space structure on Euclidean space (though, I'd personally prefer an affine structure).

In my head, these things make perfect sense for me:

- Euclidean space in Sage is an affine vector space.
- The symplectic space above is an affine space, too, endowed with a symplectic structure.
- As for the vector space structure, I think we should link the Euclidean space to preexisting vector spaces endowed with bilinear forms.

I am open to suggestions, different opinions and arguments. :)

But that's not for this ticket.
