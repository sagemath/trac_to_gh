- a basic version using the Cython distance matrix
- a version with space complexity in O(m)

<a id='comment:3'></a>One minor fix in doc 

```diff
- `2^16` vertices.
+ `2^{16}` vertices.
```

Also, I have one question, hasn't this method restricted the `szeged index` to `unweighted undirected graphs only`. Is that what we want? (I guess earlier that wasnt the case) 

And it is raising error for directed graph if that's the wanted case then why dont we move this method to `graph.py`.
