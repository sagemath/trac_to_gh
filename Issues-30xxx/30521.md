In the padics README, which appears here: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/src/sage/rings/padics, 

Any file related to two-step padic extensions is marked as such that does not yet exist.
 But in fact, it is actually possible to achieve a 2-step padic extension (an eisenstein extension over an unramified one):

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: K.<a> = ZqCA(25)
sage: W.<w> = K.extension(x^3-5)
sage: K
5-adic Unramified Extension Ring in a defined by x^2 + 4*x + 2
sage: W
5-adic Eisenstein Extension Ring in w defined by x^3 - 5 over its base ring
```

Keywords: **readme**

Component: **padics**
