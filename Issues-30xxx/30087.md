The following code:

```python
R.<v> = QQ[]
C = HyperellipticCurve(v**3-1)
J = C.jacobian()
D = J(v-1,0)
```

crashes on sage version 9.1 and the current `develop` branch with the exception:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in v over Rational Field' and 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field'
```

The reason is that the code uses `x` internally and doesn't expect the input to come from a "different" univariate polynomial ring, hence the exception. The error does not occur when `v` is replaced by `x` in the example above.

The proposed patch explicitly casts the given polynomials to the parent ring of the curve's defining polynomials.

Thank you for reporting this. It seems the current branch introduces a few test failures, which I do not know how to solve myself. Someone familiar with schemes, please take a look.

You can run the tests on individual files and folders like this:

```
./sage -t -l src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/jacobian_morphism.py
```

Moreover, please add your full name to the Authors field of this ticket. Otherwise, the automatic patchbot does not run the tests for this ticket.

Also, it seems the result of this line is not used anymore with your changes:

```
polys = cantor_reduction(a, b, f, h, genus)
```

The doctest failures are coming from the fact that a Jacobian can be constructed with a different base field than the underlying curve, so taking the base ring from the curve itself is creating errors.

The path of least resistance is to create a `HyperellipticCurve` with custom variables:

```
sage: R.<v> = QQ[]                                                              
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(v**3-1,0, 'v,y')                                   
sage: J = C.jacobian()                                                          
sage: D = J(v-1, 0); D
(v - 1, y)
```
Given this, I'm not even sure this should be considered a bug in the first place. Maybe a better fix would be to edit some docstrings to better document the existing behavior.

Given that a hyperelliptic curve can be constructed from a univariate polynomial, I think the "custom names" option for hyperelliptic curves is problematic: it requires the user to repeat elements, where this wouldn't really be required. The `u` or `x` can be read off from the parent of the passed-in univariate polynomial. If it is required to come up with a name for the other variable (like `y`) we may have a bit of a problem, because the system can't choose itself very well. Particularly, for `HyperellipticCurve(y^5+y+1)` we would have a problem, since you probably do not want to name the other variable `y` as well. So perhaps there should be an option to give the name of the second variable (only) ?

Currently, the interface creates unnecessary ambiguity: what would `HyperellipticCurve(x^5+x+1,'y,x')` be?

This should clearly be (and already is) `x^2 = y^5 + y + 1`: The meaning of `names=` is to forget about the original variables of `f` and `h` and use the given names instead.
