```
Tested with https://sagecell.sagemath.org

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 9.1, Release Date: 2020-05-20'
```
All of these work as expected:

```
sage: exp(-ln(-x))
sage: exp(-3*ln(-x)/3)
sage: exp(-ln(-9*x))
```
However this hangs:

```
sage: exp(-3*ln(-9*x)/3)
```
In case you are curious, this is what I was doing (the expressions were a bit more complex, of course):

```
sage: a=var('a')
sage: y=exp(-3*x)
sage: x0=ln(-9*a)/3
sage: y(x=x0)
```

Depends on #30446
