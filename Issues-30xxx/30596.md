And the bot is green. This is very weird and why just those three? Volker is trying to merge this ticket at the moment and I am suspecting he may be seeing this or a variation.
It is not impossible that there is a bad interaction with another ticket.

Have you tried it together with #30572? Obviously same author and reviewers :)

Which version of gcc do you use? It seems that in C99 which is the default for C of gcc-10 in Gentoo `inline` is not always what you think it is.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16245521/c99-inline-function-in-c-file

If I understand correctly some of these functions should be `static inline`.
