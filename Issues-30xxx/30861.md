Along the same lines as #30859 for Debian, 
this is for several purposes:

- test proper isolation of our build (i.e., the presence of unused system packages does not break our build) using `tox -e ...-maximal`
- reveal errors such as #30745 (homebrew: Errors when homebrew's ntl, flint, or ecl are installed in /usr/local), #31132
- test sagelib without Sage-the-distribution (similar to #28745/#30845 for conda)
- prepare for tickets that will add `spkg-configure.m4`

(see also #29146)

(from #30371)

- #30504: Add MacPorts package information

This ticket does not cover Homebrew packages available via taps.

Interested users can install GAP, Macaulay2 and Polymake as follows:

```
$ brew tap gap-system/gap
$ brew install gap

$ brew tap macaulay2/tap
$ brew install macaulay2

$ brew tap apaffenholz/polymake
$ brew install polymake
```
