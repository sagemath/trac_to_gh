Follow-up from #29557 (Add script package _recommended and generate "recommended system packages" info).


From egourgoulhon #30624 and similar reports by gh-tobiasdiez, jhpalmieri #29557:

  configure ends with the following recommendations:

```
  configure: hint: installing the following system packages is recommended and may 
avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
configure:   $ sudo apt-get update 
  $ sudo apt-get install texlive-generic-extra texlive-xetex latexmk pandoc dvipng 
default-jdk ffmpeg libavdevice-dev libcdd-dev libcdd-tools libec-dev eclib-tools 
libgc-dev libgiac-dev xcas pari-gp2c lcalc liblfunction-dev libnauty-dev nauty 
pari-gp2c libpari-dev pari-doc pari-elldata pari-galdata pari-galpol pari-seadata 
sympow
```

- #30910 replaced `texlive-generic-extra` by a package that exists in modern Debian distributions.
- #31042 addresses `pandoc`.
- #29372 changed the message, showing installation hints for non-enabled optional packages separately.
- #32956 create dummy script packages for ffmpeg and imagemagick 

The message is printed regardless of whether `ffmpeg` et al. are installed because `build/pkgs/_recommended/spkg-configure.m4` does not check anything.

To this end, tests need to be added for the presence of the various recommended packages in the system. 

**We do this by splitting out individual script packages, similar to the existing `build/pkgs/pandoc` and `build/pkgs/graphviz`.**

We see that `pandoc` still appears above. Is this what we want?

Could we update the description of the ticket (which is too large), because I don't know what the branch is suppose to do exactly?

+Follow-up from #29557 (Add script package _recommended and generate "recommended system packages" info).
+
+
+From egourgoulhon #30624 and similar reports by gh-tobiasdiez, jhpalmieri #29557:
+
+  configure ends with the following recommendations:
+
+\`\`\`
+  configure: hint: installing the following system packages is recommended and may 
+avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
+configure:   $ sudo apt-get update 
+  $ sudo apt-get install texlive-generic-extra texlive-xetex latexmk pandoc dvipng 
+default-jdk ffmpeg libavdevice-dev libcdd-dev libcdd-tools libec-dev eclib-tools 
+libgc-dev libgiac-dev xcas pari-gp2c lcalc liblfunction-dev libnauty-dev nauty 
+pari-gp2c libpari-dev pari-doc pari-elldata pari-galdata pari-galpol pari-seadata 
+sympow
+\`\`\`
+
+- #30910 replaced \`texlive-generic-extra\` by a package that exists in modern Debian distributions.
+- #31042 addresses \`pandoc\`.
+- #29372 changed the message, showing installation hints for non-enabled optional packages separately.
+- #32956 create dummy script packages for ffmpeg and imagemagick 
+
+The message is printed regardless of whether \`ffmpeg\` et al. are installed because \`build/pkgs/_recommended/spkg-configure.m4\` does not check anything.
+
+To this end, tests need to be added for the presence of the various recommended packages in the system. 
+
+**We do this by splitting out individual script packages, similar to the existing \`build/pkgs/pandoc\` and \`build/pkgs/graphviz\`.**
