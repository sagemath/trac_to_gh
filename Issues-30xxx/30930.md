Follow-up from #29557 (Add script package _recommended and generate "recommended system packages" info).


From egourgoulhon #30624 and similar reports by gh-tobiasdiez, jhpalmieri #29557:

  configure ends with the following recommendations:

```
  configure: hint: installing the following system packages is recommended and may 
avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
configure:   $ sudo apt-get update 
  $ sudo apt-get install texlive-generic-extra texlive-xetex latexmk pandoc dvipng 
default-jdk ffmpeg libavdevice-dev libcdd-dev libcdd-tools libec-dev eclib-tools 
libgc-dev libgiac-dev xcas pari-gp2c lcalc liblfunction-dev libnauty-dev nauty 
pari-gp2c libpari-dev pari-doc pari-elldata pari-galdata pari-galpol pari-seadata 
sympow
```

- #30910 replaced `texlive-generic-extra` by a package that exists in modern Debian distributions.
- #31042 addresses `pandoc`.
- #29372 changed the message, showing installation hints for non-enabled optional packages separately.
- #32956 create dummy script packages for ffmpeg and imagemagick 

The message is printed regardless of whether `ffmpeg` et al. are installed because `build/pkgs/_recommended/spkg-configure.m4` does not check anything.

To this end, tests need to be added for the presence of the various recommended packages in the system. 

**We do this by splitting out individual script packages, similar to the existing `build/pkgs/pandoc` and `build/pkgs/graphviz`.**

That `configure` keeps suggesting packages from the `_recommended` dummy package is because `build/pkgs/_recommended/spkg-configure.m4` does not check anything.

To improve this, tests need to be added for the presence of the various recommended packages in the system. Either in `build/pkgs/_recommended/spkg-configure.m4` or in individual "script packages" similar to `build/pkgs/pandoc`.

I tested the branch. make build works.

With the branch, I see the following message on my computer (Ubuntu 20.04):

```
    notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:

        _recommended boost coxeter3 gp2c igraph isl libsemigroups pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata

configure:

    hint: installing the following system packages, if not
    already present, is recommended and may avoid having to
    build them (though some may have to be built anyway):

      $ sudo apt-get install  texlive-latex-extra texlive-xetex latexmk dvipng default-jdk ffmpeg libavdevice-dev libboost-dev pari-gp2c libigraph-dev libisl-dev

    After installation, re-run configure using:

      $ ./config.status --recheck && ./config.status
```

And `tox -e docker-archlinux-minimal -- config.status` gives this:

```

We see that `pandoc` still appears above. Is this what we want?

Could we update the description of the ticket (which is too large), because I don't know what the branch is suppose to do exactly?
