Even with #30489 I still get the following times (with `pynormaliz`):

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 87.1 --random-seed=0 ppl_lattice_polytope.py
    [175 tests, 10.41 s]
sage -t --long --warn-long 86.8 --random-seed=0 library.py
    [409 tests, 118.82 s]
```

This ticket tries to reduce this time somewhat by removing super long doctest.

New timings with this ticket

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 87.1 --random-seed=0 ppl_lattice_polytope.py
    [175 tests, 4.46 s]
sage -t --long --warn-long 86.8 --random-seed=0 library.py
    [409 tests, 73.42 s]
```
