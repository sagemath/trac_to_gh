Thanks Frédéric for fixing those, and Matthias for reviewing.

Some observations for a possible follow-up ticket:

Missing backticks in quite a few places, e.g.:

```diff
-    For each dimension a separate start_index and size can be specified.
+    For each dimension a separate ``start_index`` and ``size`` can be specified.
```

Here, besides doubled word "of" and  missing backticks, I can't parse this sentence:

```diff
-    Return all elements of of monomial_set, which result multiplied by a variable in monomial.
+    Return all elements of ``monomial_set``, which result multiplied by a variable in monomial.
```

Should "Wichmanns" be "Wichmann's" here?

```diff
-    Calculate $m_{k+1}$ from the FGLM algorithm as described in Wichmanns diploma thesis
+    Calculate $m_{k+1}$ from the FGLM algorithm as described in Wichmann's diploma thesis.
```

Here "occurrs" should be "occurs"

```diff
-    contains only a small subset of variables. In each variable that occurrs
+    contains only a small subset of variables. In each variable that occurs
```

Here "Newton method" should be "Newton's method":

```diff
-        This is computed using Newton method in the ring of power
+        This is computed using Newton's method in the ring of power
```

Missing article:

```diff
-        integral domain. Moreover, for polynomial whose coefficient of
+        integral domain. Moreover, for a polynomial whose coefficient of
```

For other instances of "of of":

```diff
$ git grep " of of " .
build/pkgs/cycler/SPKG.rst:Cycler is a small break of of matplotlib to deal with "composable
src/sage/databases/findstat.py:        generating function of of the statistic can be computed from
src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/multivector_module.py:    ``A`` is nothing but the second exterior power of of ``XM``, i.e.
src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori/fglm.py:    Returns all elements of of monomial_set, which result multiplied by a variable in monomial.
```

(the first one should be "break-off of"; the other three just have an extra "of").
