These docker images are built by the portability CI workflows for Linux.

However, refactoring of the workflow had broken the upload to `docker.pkg.github.com`. (Although the login to `docker.pkg.github.com` succeeds, the push fails with `no basic auth credentials` - see https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1414148202?check_suite_focus=true)
