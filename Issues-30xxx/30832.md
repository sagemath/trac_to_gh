Instances of `RealSet` that are finite unions of open intervals should be connected in some way to `sage.manifolds`, in particular to `OpenInterval` and `RealLine` (which are both in the global namespace).

In this ticket, we add functionality to initialize a `RealSet` from instances of `OpenInterval` and `RealLine`, as well as from their topological closures (#31644)

If you create `OpenInterval` instances with the same `ambient_interval` set, then you can take unions.

```
sage: I02 = OpenInterval(0, 2, ambient_interval=RealLine())
sage: I13 = OpenInterval(1, 3, ambient_interval=RealLine())
sage: I02.union(I13)
Open subset (0, 2)_union_(1, 3) of the Real number line R
```

Right, but

```
sage: I02 = OpenInterval(0, 2, ambient_interval=RealLine())
sage: I13 = OpenInterval(1, 3, ambient_interval=RealLine())
sage: U = I02.union(I13)
sage: RealSet(U)
```

won't work, no?
