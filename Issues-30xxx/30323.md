In `degree_iterator()` of generic_graph.py, there are unoptimal usages of lambdas which should be removed. 

As well, we introduce two new functions based on graph degree: `vertex_with_degree(degree)` in generic_graph.py and `is_path()` in graph.py

I believe you could rewrite the `vertices_with_degree()` simply as

```python
return [v for v,d in self.degree_iterator(labels=True) if d == degree]
```

I would write `is_path()` as

```python
        if len(self) == 1:  # Special case
            return not self.has_loops()
        deg_one_counter = 0
        for v in self:
            deg = self._backend.degree(v, False)
            if deg == 1:
                deg_one_counter += 1
                if deg_one_counter > 2:
                    return False

            elif deg != 2:
                return False
        return deg_one_counter == 2
```

For `is_path()`, don't you have to check if it is connected? You have could a disjoint union of a path and a cycle. As it is above, this would return true for that case.

Ah, right. Then please keep that portion. However, note that we only need to check if `deg_one_counter > 2` if it changes.

Please also add tests for the disjoint union of a path and a cycle, a single vertex (with and without a loop), and a tree.

Hello,

this ticket addresses 3 different issues that could each deserve a specific ticket.

1. the use of lambdas in `degree_iterator`. The proposed solution is good.

2. A method to extract the subset of vertices with a given degree. We have several places in the graph module where we use the one line solution of #comment:2 and a unified method could improve the readability of the code. However, I think it would be more interesting to add a filter option to `vertices` and `vertex_iterator` (somehow already suggested in #1048). This would offer more functionalities without the addition of another method.

3. the `is_path` method. This is a special case of `is_tree` that we need (we also need a method for checking if a subgraph is an (induced) path, but this is another story). To improve the current method, you should:
   * fix definitions for the empty graph and the graph of order 1
   * add tests for graphs with 0 or 1 vertex
   * check that `G.order() == G.size() + 1`. A path is a tree. Actually, this also handle the case of 1 vertex graph.
   * select for root of the DFS: `root = next(G.vertex_iterator())`. No need to build first the full list of vertices
   * use an extra variable to store the degree of v
 
We could later add a similar method to check is a digraph is a directed path.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

- instead of parameter `degree`, we could have a more general solution like:

```
        - ``property`` -- function (default: ``None``); a function that inputs
          a vertex and outputs a boolean value, i.e., a vertex ``v`` is kept if
          ``property(v) == True``
...
        if property is not None:
            for v in self._backend.iterator_verts(vertices):
                if property(v):
                    yield v
            return
```


- in `is_path`:

```diff
-        Return true if the graph is a path (has degree sequence of n-2 2's and two 1's).
+        Check whether ``self`` is a path.
+
+        A connected graph of order `n \geq 2` is a path if it is a tree (see :meth:`is_tree`)
+        with `n-2` vertices of degree 2 and two of degree 1.
+        By convention, a graph of order 1 without loops is a path, but the empty graph is not a path.
```
  the link to method `is_tree` might not be correct.

- may be better like that ?

```diff
-            return True if order else False
+            return order == 1
```
