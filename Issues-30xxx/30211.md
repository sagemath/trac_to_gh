To each additive/multiplicative characteristic class corresponds a sequence. Namely, due to the [fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_symmetric_polynomial#Fundamental_theorem_of_symmetric_polynomials), each symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. In our setup, the `k`-th elementary symmetric polynomials corresponds to the `k`-th Chern class. This allows us to express additive/multiplicative characteristic classes in terms of Chern classes (or Pontryagin classes in the real case respectively). This is the sequence.

Do you have an example that gives something that is not a symmetric function over `QQ`?

Also, you are better off using

```python
m = Sym.m()
m._from_dict({p: prod(ring(coeff[i]) for i in p)
              for k in range(len(coeff))
              for p in Partitions(k))
```
which is faster as it more directly creates the symmmetric function you want.

Sure: `x-y` is no symmetric function over `QQ`.

> I know what a symmetric function is (that is basically my main research area). What I want is a symmetric function over some other base ring besides `QQ`. Can you add an example where this happens? In the branch, you say don't assume `QQ`, so I want a doctest where that actually occurs.


General question: do the examples have to be mathematically sensible? For instance, there are plenty of examples where the coefficients of the Taylor expansion are not rationals and `SR` is then a reasonable choice, but such examples are very uncommon in the application of characteristic classes.

Since it something you are supporting, it should be tested, even if it is uncommon.

Thanks. This will be good. Just one comment on the code:

```diff
             from sage.combinat.partition import Partitions
             # Get the multiplicative sequence in the monomial basis:
-            mon_pol = Sym.m().sum(prod(ring(coeff[i]) for i in p) * Sym.m()[p]
+            mon_pol = Sym.m()._from_dict({p: sum(prod(ring(coeff[i]) for i in p)
                                   for k in range(len(coeff))
-                                  for p in Partitions(k))
+                                  for p in Partitions(k)})
```
This will create the element faster with far less temporary objects.
