To each additive/multiplicative characteristic class corresponds a sequence. Namely, due to the [fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_symmetric_polynomial#Fundamental_theorem_of_symmetric_polynomials), each symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. In our setup, the `k`-th elementary symmetric polynomials corresponds to the `k`-th Chern class. This allows us to express additive/multiplicative characteristic classes in terms of Chern classes (or Pontryagin classes in the real case respectively). This is the sequence.

Do you have an example that gives something that is not a symmetric function over `QQ`?

Also, you are better off using

```python
m = Sym.m()
m._from_dict({p: prod(ring(coeff[i]) for i in p)
              for k in range(len(coeff))
              for p in Partitions(k))
```
which is faster as it more directly creates the symmmetric function you want.

Sure: `x-y` is no symmetric function over `QQ`.

I will try another attempt using power series only. I hope this simplifies the code significantly. Furthermore, this could improve the performance since power series compute things faster than symbolic expressions; also the use of power series is mathematically more rigorous. Finally, power series (over the symbolic ring) allow to distinct between parameters and the actual variable.

Thanks. This will be good. Just one comment on the code:

```diff
             from sage.combinat.partition import Partitions
             # Get the multiplicative sequence in the monomial basis:
-            mon_pol = Sym.m().sum(prod(ring(coeff[i]) for i in p) * Sym.m()[p]
+            mon_pol = Sym.m()._from_dict({p: sum(prod(ring(coeff[i]) for i in p)
                                   for k in range(len(coeff))
-                                  for p in Partitions(k))
+                                  for p in Partitions(k)})
```
This will create the element faster with far less temporary objects.
