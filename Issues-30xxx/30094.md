(This ticket has been narrowed to the topic mainly discussed in the comments. The topic originally in title and ticket description has been moved to #30174)

There are multiple incompatible protocols for dealing with bases of a free module in Sage (#19346).

One such protocol is defined by the category `ModulesWithBasis`. `CombinatorialFreeModule` is one of the parent classes in this category.

Another such protocol is defined by the parent class `FiniteRankFreeModule`, which is in the category `Modules`.
A `FiniteRankFreeModule` can be equipped with a finite list of bases (each represented by an instance of `FreeModuleBasis`), none of which are considered distinguished. `FiniteRankFreeModule`s are unique parents; the operation of equipping a `FiniteRankFreeModule`  does not change the identity of the parent.

We define a method `FiniteRankFreeModule. isomorphism_with_fixed_basis` that establishes, given a basis, an isomorphism with a `CombinatorialFreeModule` (and thus a parent in the category `ModulesWithBasis`.

In my question above, this would be a method of `FreeModuleBasis` - so there is a particular basis. And `RR^3` also has a distinguished basis.

You were asking for a map from `self.free_module()`, which is the free module without a distinguished basis. If you want to go from a `FreeModuleBasis`, then that might be a good method as there is a canonical isomorphism of the homspace with the endspace and an identity map.

I of course agree that one may implement a method in `FreeModuleBasis` that returns an isomorphism between `Q3` and `QQ^3`, but for which purpose? Such an isomorphism cannot be used for a coercion since a coercion must be unique and cannot depend on a extra parameter such as a
basis-dependent isomorphism.

Coming back to the issue mentioned in the ticket title and description, I would say that the problem arises because "vector spaces" as they are implemented in Sage are not really vector spaces in all their generality but only Cartesian powers `F^n`, where `F` is the base field.

OK, I think we are getting closer. 

When you say, '"vector spaces" as they are implemented in Sage', I assume you mean the ones implemented in `sage.modules.free_module` and constructed by the function `VectorSpace`, and then I agree with what you wrote.

What I was asking for in comment 8 is, given a basis, a map from a `FiniteRankFreeModule` (which is in the category of finite dimensional modules) to a parent that is in the category of finite dimensional modules with basis.

I've pushed a rough implementation of this to the ticket.

Sure, I don't need this to be a coercion. Just a module morphism.

The question is what does this class represent:

1. The basis itself, which is a finite set.
2. The span of the basis elements, which is a vector space where we can represent the points in terms of the chosen basis elements.

These are very different objects. One is finite, one is infinite (well, |R|<sup>n</sup>, where R is the base ring). Since you want to think of it as 1, then you are saying there should not be a morphism. However, most of the points of the free module should not be elements of this parent. The actual implementation is really treating it like 2, and its elements are the points of the free module represented using the chosen basis.

---

I like the proposed method overall. I have some suggestions:

1 - Change the name to something like `morphism_with_fixed_basis` as right now it sounds like it is constructing a map that happens to fix a basis.
2 - Allow the codomain of the map to be passed to the function. Then you can have the map be defined as

```python
        if codomain.dimension() != self.dimension():
            raise ValueError
        B = list(codomain.basis())
        def function(x):
            return codomain.sum(x[basis, i] * B[i] for i in self.irange())
```
This should be implementation independent (if it is not, then it is a bug IMO).

I think it's clear that 1 is intended:

```
sage: V = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 3)
sage: e = V.basis("e")
sage: e[0] in e
True
sage: e[1] in e
True
sage: e[0] + e[1] in e
False

I must agree Eric in[comment:14](#comment%3A14), I don't see the use of such a method `isomorphism_with_fixed_basis`, not even in `FiniteRankFreeModule`.

I see no problem in implementing the coercion on the level of modules right away. There is no need for such method either in this case. The vector space `QQ^3` forgets about the basis we have chosen, anyway (i.e. there is no going back). The important thing is that we are able to choose a basis. But this is ensured due to the definition of a free module.

I have to admit, I am not sure what's the problem is we're still discussing; apart from the error reported in the description. Is it still all about[comment:2](#comment%3A2)? As reported in this ticket, we want to coerce the free modules themselves and not their elements.

Thanks. I will split the ticket into two and clarify the descriptions.

It's still a draft, however I'd like to propose an improvement regarding the docstring:

```diff
         Construct the canonical isomorphism from the free module ``self``
-        to a free module in which ``basis`` of ``self`` is the distinguished basis.
+        to a free module in which ``basis`` of ``self`` is mapped to the
+        distinguished basis of ``codomain``.
```

I think it would also be good to specify input and output in the docstring. In particular, the input `codomain` should be described as an element of `ModulesWithBasis` having the same rank as `self` and over the same base ring. Furthermore, it should be explained that `CombinatorialFreeModule` is chosen by default if the input is `None`.

```diff
-            return codomain.sum(x[basis, i] * codomain_basis[i]
-                                for i in self.irange())

```
The doctest 

```
sage: self = V = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 3); V
```
could be changed to

```
sage: self = V = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 3, start_index=1); V
```
to check that everything is OK with index ranges.

As far as I understand it, the keys correspond to the basis element's name. And I thought that the intention was to name them after the basis we are coming from, wasn't it?

Notice that the names can also differ from the canonical choice, for example `a, b, c`, without labeled indices. In that case, the current implementation is preferrable anyway.

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 3)
sage: e = M.basis(['a', 'b', 'c'], symbol_dual=['d', 'e', 'f'])
sage: phi_e = phi_e = M.isomorphism_with_fixed_basis(e)
sage: phi_e.codomain().basis()
