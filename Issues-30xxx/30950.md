See ticket description of #29418 and the change made in #32527.

When done, we can switch sage-bootstrap-python back to preferring `python3` on macOS.

Is this necessary? I'm not sure how to test, but here's what I did: with #29719 (new flint), I used

```
$ ./configure --with-python=/usr/bin/python3 --enable-download-from-upstream-url --with-system-flint=no
$ make flint
```
`flint` was downloaded properly. Since that worked, I tried a pip package:

```
$ ./sage -i biopython
```
That also worked. What should I be testing?

Edit: hold on, trying again after editing `build/bin/sage-system-python`.

This is affecting upstream URLs that are https.
You can test by replacing `upstream/mirror_list` by something that always fails to force download from the upstream URL.
