... as an alias for `rank` (which is provided by free modules).

Currently it is provided by some but not all implementations of vector spaces:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['x', 'y'])
sage: C.rank()
2
sage: C.dimension()
2

sage: F = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 2)
sage: F.rank()
2
sage: F.dimension()
AttributeError: 'FiniteRankFreeModule_with_category' object has no attribute 'dimension'
```
