It seems that the pexpect interface to Magma does not correctly handle multiprecision integers. A nearly minimal example:

```
sage: P.<t> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: l = [-27563611963/4251528, -48034411/104976, -257/54, 1]
sage: u1 = P(l)
sage: u2 = P(magma(u1).sage())
sage: u1 == u2
False
sage: u1                                                                                                                                      
t^3 - 257/54*t^2 - 48034411/104976*t - 27563611963/4251528
sage: u2                                                                                                                                      
t^3 - 257/54*t^2 - 48034411/104976*t - 8389474481/1294028
```
Note this issue does not arise with the numbers themselves:

```
sage: magma(l).sage() == l                                                                                                                    
True
```

It looks like Magma is a red herring; the issue is in `sage.misc.sage_eval.sage_eval`.
The `sage` method reads as follows:

```
        z, preparse = self.Sage(nvals=2)
        s = str(z)
        preparse = str(preparse) == 'true'
        return sage.misc.sage_eval.sage_eval(s, preparse=preparse)
```
In this case, `preparse` is coming back `false` and this is the trouble:

```
sage: s = magma(u1).Sage(); s                                                   
QQ['t'.replace('$.', 'x').replace('.', '')]([ -27563611963/4251528, -48034411/104976, -257/54, 1 ])
sage: sage.misc.sage_eval.sage_eval(str(s), preparse=False)

t^3 - 257/54*t^2 - 48034411/104976*t - 27563611963/4251528
```
Is there any reason not to just force preparsing in all cases? It doesn't seem to break any doctests in `sage/interfaces/magma.py`.

It does not look like this can work consistently, though. For example, the code for converting polynomials appears to ignore the preparsing flag for the list of coefficients, which leads to the bug.

```
intrinsic Sage(X::RngUPolElt) -> MonStgElt, BoolElt

  return Sprintf("%o(%o)", Sage(Parent(X)), Sage(Coefficients(X))), false;
end intrinsic;
```

Enabling preparsing sounds like a good idea to me if it works for all the intended cases in `basic.m`. This would reduce a lot of complexity.

I'm not sure why preparsing is enabled in some cases but not others.

In this commit I made a minimal change to fix this particular bug: for univariate polynomials, I take the preparse flag from the base ring (which is true except for ordinary integers).

This looks ok to me, as the same approach is used for matrices. Have you tried whether the conversion for multivariate polynomials works as well?

Two small things: the tests need to be tagged with the `optional - magma` tag, and the following syntax is used to refer to trac tickets:

```diff
-        Tests for `trac`:30341::
+        Tests for :trac:`30341`::
```

There was already a doctest in the previous commit about multivariate polynomials. No change was needed for them.

I made the requested changes to the docstring. Adding the optional tags should fix some (all?) of the patchbot errors.
