It seems that the pexpect interface to Magma does not correctly handle multiprecision integers. A nearly minimal example:

```
sage: P.<t> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: l = [-27563611963/4251528, -48034411/104976, -257/54, 1]
sage: u1 = P(l)
sage: u2 = P(magma(u1).sage())
sage: u1 == u2
False
sage: u1                                                                                                                                      
t^3 - 257/54*t^2 - 48034411/104976*t - 27563611963/4251528
sage: u2                                                                                                                                      
t^3 - 257/54*t^2 - 48034411/104976*t - 8389474481/1294028
```
Note this issue does not arise with the numbers themselves:

```
sage: magma(l).sage() == l                                                                                                                    
True
```

It looks like Magma is a red herring; the issue is in `sage.misc.sage_eval.sage_eval`.
The `sage` method reads as follows:

```
        z, preparse = self.Sage(nvals=2)
        s = str(z)
        preparse = str(preparse) == 'true'
        return sage.misc.sage_eval.sage_eval(s, preparse=preparse)
```
In this case, `preparse` is coming back `false` and this is the trouble:

```
sage: s = magma(u1).Sage(); s                                                   
QQ['t'.replace('$.', 'x').replace('.', '')]([ -27563611963/4251528, -48034411/104976, -257/54, 1 ])
sage: sage.misc.sage_eval.sage_eval(str(s), preparse=False)                     
t^3 - 257/54*t^2 - 48034411/104976*t - 8389474481/1294028
sage: sage.misc.sage_eval.sage_eval(str(s), preparse=True)                      
t^3 - 257/54*t^2 - 48034411/104976*t - 27563611963/4251528
```
Is there any reason not to just force preparsing in all cases? It doesn't seem to break any doctests in `sage/interfaces/magma.py`.

I'm not sure why preparsing is enabled in some cases but not others.

In this commit I made a minimal change to fix this particular bug: for univariate polynomials, I take the preparse flag from the base ring (which is true except for ordinary integers).

There was already a doctest in the previous commit about multivariate polynomials. No change was needed for them.

I made the requested changes to the docstring. Adding the optional tags should fix some (all?) of the patchbot errors.

Indeed, I had missed that.

The bots are (morally) green now and the changes look good to me. I trust that you have tried this with Magma, so I am setting this to positive.
