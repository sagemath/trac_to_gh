This is an implementation of the abstract base class PathTableau.
This implementation is for semistandard tableaux, represented as a chain of partitions (essentially, the Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern). This generalises the jeu-de-taquin operations of rectification, promotion, evacuation from
standard tableaux to semistandard tableaux. The local rule is the Bender-Knuth involution.

<a id='comment:22'></a>A few minor comments:

I would rename `SemistandardPath` to be `SemistandardPathTableau` to make the name more explicit. Also `SemistandardPaths` is grammatically wrong as you want `SemistandardPathTableaux`.

You should add more explanation there for the `INPUT:`, mainly stating it "Can be one of the following:". There also needs to be at least one test for each of these input types. Can it also take a skew semistandard tableau? I think it should be able to. How about a skew partition then regular partitions? (This one, I would say it is fine the leave off and if someone does give this, I would be a bit surprised.)

For `check`, it would be good to have actual `EXAMPLES::`.

`local_rule` should have a 1-line description, then the rest of it should be separated in another paragraph with more details.

Error messages should start with lowercase letters (this is a Python convention we try to follow).

In `rectify()`, instead of using `Partition(data)`, it would be faster to use `_Partitions(data)`. Although it would be best to not actually construct partitions, but instead keep them as tuples. Similarly, instead of calling `SemistandardPath`, you can do `P.element_class(P, data)`, where `P = self.parent()`.

```diff
-if inner == None:
+if inner is None:
```

```
-return self[0] != ()
+return bool(self[0])
```

```diff
-        lt = list(self)
-        if lt[0] == ():
-            lt = lt[1:]
-        lt.reverse()
+        if not lt[-1]:
+            lt.pop()
         return GelfandTsetlinPattern([list(a) for a in lt])
```

In `_test_jdt_promotion`, could you make the `try-except` block more local to the line you expect to fail? It looks weird to have it around the actual test run.

General PEP8 stuff such as spaces

```
-def rectify(self,inner=None,verbose=False):
+def rectify(self, inner=None, verbose=False):
```

```diff
-        for i in range(1,len(self)-1):
-            if not all(r>=s for r,s in zip(self[i+1],self[i])):
+        for i in range(1, len(self)-1):
+            if not all(r >= s for r, s in zip(self[i+1], self[i])):
```
(but not necessarily limited to these).
