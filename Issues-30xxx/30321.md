This ticket provides a wrapper of the tikz method of projections of polyhedron to polyhedron directly. Along the way, we clean-up a bit the code and add how to reproduce the picture inside of the output:

```
sage: co = polytopes.cuboctahedron()
sage: Img = co.tikz([0,0,1], 0)
sage: print('\n'.join(Img.splitlines()[:9]))
\begin{tikzpicture}%
    [x={(1.000000cm, 0.000000cm)},
    y={(0.000000cm, 1.000000cm)},
    z={(0.000000cm, 0.000000cm)},
    scale=1.000000,
    back/.style={loosely dotted, thin},
    edge/.style={color=blue!95!black, thick},
    facet/.style={fill=blue!95!black,fill opacity=0.800000},
    vertex/.style={inner sep=1pt,circle,draw=green!25!black,fill=green!75!black,thick}]
sage: print('\n'.join(Img.splitlines()[12:21]))
%% with the command: ._tikz_3d_in_3d and parameters:
%% view = [0, 0, 1]
%% angle = 0
%% scale = 1
%% edge_color = blue!95!black
%% facet_color = blue!95!black
%% opacity = 0.8
%% vertex_color = green
%% axis = False
```

I see. Not even `plot` is in the quickref, because there is a seperate visualization tutorial.

LGTM.
