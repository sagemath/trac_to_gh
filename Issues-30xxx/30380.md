```

I have added an option 'algorithm' to the class `VectorPartitions`.

If invoked as 

```
VectorParitions(vec, algorithm = 'yorgey'),
```
it will use the function `fast_vector_partitions()` internally.

Default value is `None`.

This is the minimally invasive approach. Alternatively, one could make 'yorgey' the default, which would break some old code, but is much faster, so it would be preferred for new code. A middle way would be to add deprecation warnings.

I will update the documentation once the best way forward is apparent.

Cf. Ticket [ticket:29221].

<a id='comment:10'></a>I am done here, up to possible further comments.

I have
- changed the names of options to 'lex' and 'neglex' (the default);
- updated the documentation and ran the doctests;
- changed two doc lines in `fast_vector_partitions.py` so as not to break the doctests there with the new default;
- checked that the class `VectorPartitions` is not referred to anywhere else in the 9.2beta8 source tree;
- added a warning that the default 'lex' has changed to 'neglex' between 9.1 and 9.2;
- ran the source code through yapf3.

Hoping for a positive review now.

For me the comfort afforded by the random-access syntax is the only real advantage of this class, using iterator functions directly is the same as using fast_vector_partitions() directly.

Yes, but I would object to having such an object in Sage because that isn't what we want to model here. You might as well just have a function that calls `list(fast_vector_partitions(input))` for that.

It is not a list, it is a set that we have a chosen (preferred) enumeration order. So changing the enumeration does not mean it is a different object as it is still the same set. !Lists/Tuples also do not have the uniqueness properties that `VectorPartitions` has to contend with.

I am not opposed to changing the enumeration order. In fact, I am proposing something stronger: to remove the option for the `__getitem__` using the lex order (another option might be that we could have the `i < 0` case appeal to the lex iterator).
