```

I have added an option 'algorithm' to the class `VectorPartitions`.

If invoked as 

```
VectorParitions(vec, algorithm = 'yorgey'),
```
it will use the function `fast_vector_partitions()` internally.

Default value is `None`.

This is the minimally invasive approach. Alternatively, one could make 'yorgey' the default, which would break some old code, but is much faster, so it would be preferred for new code. A middle way would be to add deprecation warnings.

I will update the documentation once the best way forward is apparent.

Cf. Ticket [ticket:29221].

I agree in principle that the container class need not know about the algorithm which created the content, so in this sense 'min' and 'algorithm' are qualitatively different options. However, I do not understand how `__iter__` would function with a parameter.

```python
def __iter__(self, algorithm="lex"):
    if algorithm == "lex":
        return self.iter_lex()
    elif algorithm == "yorgey":
        return self.iter_yorgey()
    else:
        raise ValueError("invalid algorithm")
```
(Your current solution is better for the `__iter__`, this is just a proof-of-concept.)

<a id='comment:10'>Comment 10:</a>
I am done here, up to possible further comments.

I have
- changed the names of options to 'lex' and 'neglex' (the default);
- updated the documentation and ran the doctests;
- changed two doc lines in `fast_vector_partitions.py` so as not to break the doctests there with the new default;
- checked that the class `VectorPartitions` is not referred to anywhere else in the 9.2beta8 source tree;
- added a warning that the default 'lex' has changed to 'neglex' between 9.1 and 9.2;
- ran the source code through yapf3.

Hoping for a positive review now.

Let me be very clear, I strongly oppose adding an `algorithm` option to the class. This should be something that the `__iter__` method handles and only that. Right now two sets of vector partitions with the same input except for the iteration order are different objects, which should not be the case.

For the change in iteration order, I would do this:

```python
def __iter__(self, algorithm=None):
    if algorithm is None:
        deprecation(30380, "the default iteration order has changed to neglex")
        algorithm = "neglex"
    ...
```
rather than having a `.. WARNING::` message. That way the user will see it at least once and it will show up in any doctests that use it. You can then supress it in the codebase by making the iterator call explicit (until the deprecation period is over).

Also, your new methods `_iter_type_()` I think are better as public `iter_type()` (if you want them to be private, it should be `_iter_type()` as they are not special Sage methods). They also need docstrings and doctests.

If you want to iterate using another algorithm, you can do `for v in VP.__iter__("lex")`. However, by having the public facing `iter_*` methods, this largely becomes moot because you would do `for v in VP.iter_neglex()`.

Note that the current proposal actually makes the class harder to use because of the subtleties with unique representation (which is something we want to have). By using the method I proposed, the class will remain as easy to use as it is right now. It will also more seamlessly move to the new iterator.

Thanks for the explanation. It raises a question of principle: would your objections disappear if the class were called `VectorPartitionsList`?

To expand a little, a list is a container class with a built-in ordering: [1, 2] and [2, 1] are not the same object. One can think of a list as a pair (content, ordering) where the ordering function is given as a table, fixed at initialization in terms of the content. The present class `VectorPartitions` is designed to give the same functionality with lazy evaluation, so the ordering function is not a table but a function 'algorithm'. Choosing the ordering at initialization is natural for a list.

For me the comfort afforded by the random-access syntax is the only real advantage of this class, using iterator functions directly is the same as using fast_vector_partitions() directly.

It is not a list, it is a set that we have a chosen (preferred) enumeration order. So changing the enumeration does not mean it is a different object as it is still the same set. !Lists/Tuples also do not have the uniqueness properties that `VectorPartitions` has to contend with.

I am not opposed to changing the enumeration order. In fact, I am proposing something stronger: to remove the option for the `__getitem__` using the lex order (another option might be that we could have the `i < 0` case appeal to the lex iterator).
