In an ideal words, this should be implemented. If not, than it should raise a `NotImplementedError` instead of returning wrong things.

```

There is a couple of things here. The way I understand it, the check should be that `y >= t`??

If I'm not mistaking, then checking whether `len(t) == 0` is also redundant.

I also would prefer to return `x + y, y` over adding `y` to `x`. This seems more transparent to me.

With y >= t ((1, 2), 3) would pass as valid since 3 >= 2, but the correct bracketing is (1, (2, 3)). I didn't come up with y <= t myself so I'm not entirely sure why it works, I got it from [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195669805001629), section 4.2, end of second paragraph.

I used `x += y` since extending the list should be slightly faster then creating a new one in some cases, and similar in other. Running:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.words.lyndon_word import standard_bracketing, standard_unbracketing
sage: w1 = standard_bracketing(Word('1222222222'))
sage: %timeit standard_unbracketing(w1)
sage: w2 = standard_bracketing(Word('1111111112'))
sage: %timeit standard_unbracketing(w2)
```

with `x += y; return x, y` prints for example:

```
5.64 µs ± 72.7 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
5.31 µs ± 19.5 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```

while with `return x + y, y` prints for example:

```
5.95 µs ± 16.4 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
5.48 µs ± 5.17 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```

I agree that it is less readable.

Actually, on second thought, I don't really like returning `[]` when the function should have raised an error.

Could you change to something like:

```diff
     def standard_unbracketing_rec(w):
         if not isinstance(w, list):
             return [w], []
         if len(w) != 2:
-            return [], []
+            raise ValueError("not a standard brackening")
         x, t = standard_unbracketing_rec(w[0])
-        if not x:
-            return [], []
         y, _ = standard_unbracketing_rec(w[1])
-        if not y:
-            return [], []
         # If x = st is a standard Lyndon factorization, and y is a Lyndon word
         # such that y <= t, then xy is standard (but not necessarily Lyndon).
         if x < y and (len(t) == 0 or y <= t):
             x += y
             return x, y
         else:
-            return [], []
+            raise ValueError("not a standard brackening")
```
The method `__contains__` then needs to catch this error, but I think an error raising is appropriate here, because `standard_unbracketing` might be used on its own.

I think `standard_unbracketing` should really return a finite word with the correct alphabet and raise an error if this is not a standard_bracketing`.

I don't see the advantage in adding an extra keyword and having various types of ouput. Return the word raise an error if the bracketing is incorrect or the word isn't lyndon should be fine for most purposes.

There is a couple of things to fix yet; probably not in this ticket:

-

- `__contains__` is missing for most classes in this module. It can usually fixed by just `try ... except` calling `__call__`. Maybe not super efficient, but it works.

Replying to [gh-kliem](#comment%3A11):

By correct alphabet you mean something like this?

```
res = ...
return FiniteWords(list(set(res)))(res, datatype=list, check=False)
```

> I don't see the advantage in adding an extra keyword and having various types of ouput. Return the word raise an error if the bracketing is incorrect or the word isn't lyndon should be fine for most purposes.


Alright, I'll change it later.

Definitely. I'll create a ticket for it after this is done, unless you want to do it.

This however, it seems to me there are 4 classes in this file and 3 of them already have `__contains__` (and this branch adds the last one)?

Sorry about being misleading:

There is a problem with the alphabet length. In case of the word `13` you will actually return true for lyndon words over `{1, 2}`.

Maybe we really fix everything here, because it appears to be just small typos:

Around line 416:

```diff
-        if w.length() != self._n:
-            raise ValueError("length is not n={}".format(self._n))
+        if w.length() != self._k:
+            raise ValueError("length is not k={}".format(self._k))
```
and a corresponding doctest.

Around line 428

```diff
         if isinstance(w, list):
             w = self._words(w)
-        return w in self._words and w.length() == self._k and len(set(w)) <= self._n
+        return w in self._words and w.length() == self._k and w.is_lyndon()
```

this is a redundant and confusing thing. It is already taken care of by `w in self._words` and besides the length of the set of the alphabet doesn't mean a lot.
And the actual important thing is completely missed.

And then we treat our case likewise:

```
        try:
            lw = standard_unbracketing(sblw)
        except ValueError:
            return False
        return len(lw) == self._k and lw in self._lyndon._words
```

Does this sound plausible?

Oh wow, I got confused by the `len(set(w)) <= self._n` and thought `LyndonWords(2, 2)` would also accept `word: 13`, so I implemented it the same way, but that is not the case.

The problem with `lw in self._lyndon._words` is that `__contains__` for `FiniteWords` is weird, and only returns true if the alphabets match exactly, so since

```
sage: F = FiniteWords(alphabet=[1, 2, 3])
sage: Word([1, 2, 2]) in F
False
sage: Word([1, 2, 2], alphabet=[1, 2]) in F
False
sage: Word([1, 2, 2], alphabet=[1, 2, 3]) in F
True
```
`[[1, 2], 2] in StandardBracketedLyndonWords(3, 3)` would also return false.

We could fix this by doing for example

```
        try:
            lw = standard_unbracketing(sblw)
        except ValueError:
            return False
        return len(lw) == self._k and all(1 <= x <= self._n for x in lw)
```
but

```
all(standard_unbracketing(standard_bracketing(u)) in LyndonWords(3, 3) for u in LyndonWords(3,3))
```
would still return false (as it does right now). So I think we should revert `standard_unbracketing` and make it return a list again? Or we could similarly modify `__contains__` for `LyndonWords_nk`.

Also I noticed that `[1, 3] in LyndonWords(2, 2)` throws an exception instead of returning false, which is a little weird.

I think that `__contains__` behaves weird is just the next bug.

The problem with `1 <= x <= self._n` is that it might just raise the next error message, if `x` is a letter. However, you can ask `x in range(1, self._n + 1)`, which is exactly what we want.

I fixed the bugs you mentioned above + in the meantime I replaced `w in self._words` with a manual alphabet check in all classes.

Replying to [gh-kliem](#comment%3A20):
> I think that `__contains__` behaves weird is just the next bug.


I think that was done on purpose a long time ago, see #15481. Doesn't mean it can't get changed though.

> The problem with `1 <= x <= self._n` is that it might just raise the next error message, if `x` is a letter. However, you can ask `x in range(1, self._n + 1)`, which is exactly what we want.


Right, in the end I used `x in self._words.alphabet()`.

Maybe something like this:
