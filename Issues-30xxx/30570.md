[Closed as duplicate of #18488.]

Reported by Alexandre Casamayou
(checked with Sage 9.1 and Sage 9.2.beta12):

```
sage: z = SR.var('z')
sage: expr_a = i*z^2 - 2*conjugate(z) + 2 - i
sage: sol_a = solve(expr_a, z, solution_dict=True)
sage: sol_a
[{z: -2*I - 1}, {z: 1}]
```
The first listed solution is wrong:

```
sage: [expr_a.subs(s) for s in sol_a]
[-8*I, 0]
```

The issue is that `solve` ignores `conjugate`. Compare:

```
sage: expr_b = i*z^2 - 2*z + 2 - i
sage: sol_b = solve(expr_b, z, solution_dict=True)
sage: sol_b
[{z: -2*I - 1}, {z: 1}]
sage: [expr_b.subs(s) for s in sol]
[0, 0]
```

No problem, thanks for reporting, better twice than not.
Duplicate tickets are cheap and easy to close.

I found the other ticket using Trac's query engine:

- tickets whose summary contains "solve": https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~solve
- then search for "conjugate" (with ctrl-F) in the page of results

The reverse works too:

- tickets whose summary contains "conjugate": https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~conjugate
- then search for "solve" (with ctrl-F) in the page of results

Otherwise searching for "solv" or "conjugat" would also catch
solving, conjugation...
