At least two patchbots, one Linux and one macOS, meet a failure
related to pexpect interface for Singular, namely:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/interfaces/singular.py  # Killed due to segmentation fault
```
The tested file also fails when run alone, but the copy-pasted test works fine.

See https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/sage-devel/54c8dd1f-5efa-4a9f-b17f-4225ef9c6c91n%40googlegroups.com.

The following test fails:

```
sage: try:
    alarm(0.5)
    singular._expect_expr('>')  # interrupt this
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass ## line 505 ##
Control-C pressed. Interrupting Singular. Please wait a few seconds...
sage: 2*a ## line 514 ##

Perhaps this test failure has nothing to do Singular.

`singular`'s is the only pexpect interface on which this test is carried out. One could also have same for `GAP`, say:

```
sage: a = gap(1)
sage: _ = gap._expect.sendline('1+')  # unfinished input
sage: try:
....:     alarm(0.5)
....:     gap._expect_expr('gap>')  # interrupt this
....: except KeyboardInterrupt:
....:     pass                                                                                                                                                                                
Control-C pressed. Interrupting Gap. Please wait a few seconds...
sage: 2*a                                                                                                                                                                      
2
```

Could someone who has a box where this is reliably reproduced, try adding somewhere the doctest for GAP above, and see if it fails too?

Bug fails with gap too, when running doctests. In the command line, provokes a very bad crash of sage.

running in the doctests:

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/singular.py", line 511, in sage.interfaces.singular.Singular._send_interrupt
Failed example:
    2*a
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    RuntimeError: Gap produced error output
    Error, no method found! For debugging hints type ?Recovery from NoMethodFound
    Error, no 1st choice method found for `*' on 2 arguments

       executing \$sage3:=\$sage2 * \$sage1;;

    During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

etc
```

in the console, one gets

```

OK, actually I should have checked, for me such GAP pexpect test in Sage console also results in
`(invalid Gap object -- The gap session in which this object was defined is no longer running.)`

This makes me wonder why it's important to have such a test in Singular. Only Singular has a custom `_send_interrupt`; GAP
uses the default one, below, and you see it sends `_quit_string`; it kills the GAP session if it lands in the main loop, rather than in the break loop (doing `quit;` in GAP's break loop brings you to the main loop, so in this case it's OK). 

```
    def _send_interrupt(self):
        """
        Send an interrupt to the application.  This is used internally
        by :meth:`interrupt`.

        First CTRL-C to stop the current command, then quit.
        """
        self._expect.sendline(chr(3))
        self._expect.sendline(self._quit_string())
```
Singular custom one was added along with the test in question, and no `_quit_string()` is sent (which is `quit;` for GAP, as
you can see by looking at the value of `gap._quit_string()`).
For Singular one has the following in `_send_interrupt()`:

```
        sleep(0.1)

        E = self._expect
        E.sendline(chr(3))
        for i in range(5):
            try:
                E.expect_upto(self._prompt, timeout=1.0)
                return
            except Exception:
                pass
            E.sendline(";")
```

We can try just to erase Singular's `_send_interrupt()`, set its `_quit_string()` to proper value (it's  `quit` rather than `quit;`, 
as it should be) and be done with.

I am not sure it is safe do interrupt Singular - note the warning at the end

```
^C// ** Interrupt at cmd:`load` in line:';return();'
abort after this command(a), abort immediately(r), print backtrace(b), continue(c) or quit Singular(q) ?// ** Interrupt at cmd:`load` in line:';return();'

```

If we get no more reports on sage-release in a while,
