The optional package `gap_packages` fails to build on various platforms (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/281307759):
`ubuntu-trusty`, `debian-bullseye`, `debian-sid`, `linuxmint-17`.

We add patches extracted from the GAP/libsemigroup update ticket #29314 (which may not be ready for Sage 9.2)

For what it's worth, `gap_packages` fails for me with Xcode 12, with the usual sort of error:

```
gcc -c -O -fno-builtin gpd.c 
gpd.c:37:7: error: implicit declaration of function 'gpprog' is invalid in C99 [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  if (gpprog()== -1) exit(1);
      ^
1 error generated.
```
That happens with or without this branch.
