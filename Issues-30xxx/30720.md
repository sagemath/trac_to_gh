The optional package `gap_packages` fails to build on various platforms (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/281307759):
`ubuntu-trusty`, `debian-bullseye`, `debian-sid`, `linuxmint-17`.

We add patches extracted from the GAP/libsemigroup update ticket #29314 (which may not be ready for Sage 9.2)
