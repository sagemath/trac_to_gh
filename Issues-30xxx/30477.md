When implicit multiplication is enabled, using complex literals does not work.

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(True)
sage: preparse('1jr'), preparse('1rj')
('Integer(1)*jr', 'Integer(1)*rj')
```
Instead, it should behave like when implicit multiplication is disabled.

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(False)
sage: preparse('1jr'), preparse('1rj')
('1J', '1J')
```
