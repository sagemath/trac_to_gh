When implicit multiplication is enabled, using complex literals does not work.

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(True)
sage: preparse('1jr'), preparse('1rj')
('Integer(1)*jr', 'Integer(1)*rj')
```
Instead, it should behave like when implicit multiplication is disabled.

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(False)
sage: preparse('1jr'), preparse('1rj')
('1J', '1J')
```

To signal a complex literal as raw, place the `r` at the very end:

```
sage: 1jr
1j
sage: 1r + 1jr
(1+1j)
```

I suggest to close as invalid or wontfix.

But I will listen to arguments for doing otherwise.

Here is a minimal fix. I have also changed the regular expressions to be case-insensitive, which solves the following problem with scientific notation and implicit multiplication:

```
sage: implicit_multiplication(True)
sage: 1e3
1000.00000000000
sage: 1E3
...
NameError: name 'E3' is not defined
```
