It would 
- try `._is_immutable` first, 
- do an `isinstance` check against `MutableSequence`, `mutableMapping`, `MutableSet` (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html)
- try `.is_immutable()`

We could also add an `is_immutable()` method to `Element`, making them immutable by default, and perhaps also to `UniqueRepresentation`, making unique parents immutable.
