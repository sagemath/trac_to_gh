```
#29766, #29441, and #29497 introduce build dependencies for packages that are only active when `SAGE_CHECK` is not `no`.

But whether a package needs its check-dependencies depends on both `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES` and `SAGE_CHECK`.

In this ticket, we move the handling of `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES` from `sage-spkg` to the Makefile. 

This allows packages to conditionalize dependencies based on the new makefile variables `SAGE_CHECK_symengine_py` (for #29497) etc.
