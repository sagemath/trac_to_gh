Some of my first implementations are worth to improve. This also means that some former features might work differently now or will be completely removed. I will keep them for one version, raise a deprecation warning and remove them in the next. This ticket is devoted to keep track of these features.

- `add_connection_form` in `manifolds.differentiable.bundle_connection` in 9.3 (removed in #31273)
