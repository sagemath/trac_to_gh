OpenBLAS fails to build with Xcode 12 (as can be seen for example in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1141519170). The fix at https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2805, more precisely, 
https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/pull/2808 - and can be backported to 0.3.9 or 0.3.10.

This is marked critical, not a blocker, since there is a workable homebrew package that can be used instead.
