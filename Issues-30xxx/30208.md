Bundle connections were implementet quite superficially (by me). In this ticket, I want to improve the assigment behavior of bundle connections.

First of all, the methods `set_connection_form` and `add_connection_form` now return the corresponding connection 1-form ready for further assignment.

The main improvement in this ticket is to allow list assignments:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', start_index=1)
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: E = M.vector_bundle(2, 'E')
sage: nab = E.bundle_connection('nabla')
sage: e = E.local_frame('e')
sage: nab[e, :] = 0  # set all entries to zero
sage: nab[e, 0, 0].display()
connection (1,1) of bundle connection nabla w.r.t. Local frame (E|_M, (e_1,e_2)) = 0
```

For details see the documentation, which I have also improved.

You should make it a standard deprecation using `from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation`. Also, there will need to be separate deprecations for each of the two methods.

My (not so well informed) opinion is that both approaches seem natural. So I don't really can't make a comparison about which is better.

I will change this. Thank you.

I thought this approach is more natural in terms of the "immutability" discussion we had months ago. The connection forms are now somehow fixed and clearly bound to the connection. Furthermore, it is much closer to the implementation of `AffineConnection`.

Eric, what do you say?

A few months ago seems like a lifetime now. Although I think it was more than a few months, but I don't quite remember the outcome of that conversation...

I have sensed something really odd, and I have no idea where this might come from:

```
sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M', start_index=1)
sage: X.<x,y,z> = M.chart()
sage: E = M.vector_bundle(2, 'E')
sage: e = E.local_frame('e') # standard frame for E
sage: nab = E.bundle_connection('nabla', latex_name=r'\nabla')
sage: nab[e, :] = 0
sage: nab[e, 1, 2][:] = [x*z, y*z, z^2]
sage: nab[e, 2, 1][:] = [x, x^2, x^3]
sage: nab[e, 1, 1][:] = [x+z, y-z, x*y*z]
sage: vframe = X.frame()
sage: e[1][[e, 2]]
0
sage: om = nab[2, 2]
sage: om(vframe[1])
Scalar field connection (2,2) of bundle connection nabla w.r.t. Local frame (E|_M, (e_1,e_2))(d/dx) on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: e[1][[e, 2]]
Scalar field connection (2,2) of bundle connection nabla w.r.t. Local frame (E|_M, (e_1,e_2))(d/dx) on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: e[1][[e, 2]] is om(vframe[1])
True
```

What the...?

**Addendum:** I think the problem comes from the *unique* zero scalar field. Somehow it gets altered via `__call__` of `TensorField`. It has therefore nothing to do with this ticket. I have opened another ticket #30239.

While this was already there, so I am not going to stop a positive review, but I really dislike doctests like this:

```
            sage: nab._new_forms(e)  # random
            dict of forms
```
It is only `# random` because of the print order, but you can easily make it print in a fixed order by

```
sage: d = nab._new_forms(e)
sage: [d[k] for k in sorted(d)]
```
By marking it as `# random`, it can take any output, so it can mask bugs.

If you don't want to change this, you can just ignore and set a positive review. If you do change, you can just set it to a positive review after you run the doctest on the file.

I suggest, we remove the `__setitem__` method again, and encourage the use of `set_connection_form(i, j).copy_from(omega)` instead. If that meets with your approval, I will open a ticket for that and apply the same changes for mixed differential forms.

**Addendum:** Seems it's fine. Even some classes in the Python library admits that behavior. I just improved the documentation regarding that in one of the subsequent tickets.
