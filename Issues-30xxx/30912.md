We update the following items in `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/`:
- Add `README.rst`
- Add `LICENSE.txt` (for sagelib and documentation only - see discussion in #21571)
- `setup.py` metadata (author, license, compatibility, ....)

We switch from distutils to setuptools so we can put the new metadata in the `setup.cfg` format. 

sage-devel post regarding naming:
- https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/3mCIV9LnP9c/m/lQXLEGKcCQAJ

Naming was discussed during https://wiki.sagemath.org/days111 and a decision made to use the `sagemath-...` format and in particular `sagemath-standard`.

Currently, `setup.py` thinks that the name of the distribution is `sage`.
- `sage` is taken - see #28796	Claim "sage" package on PyPI, replace unexplained package "sage 0.0.0"
- `sagemath` is taken - https://pypi.org/project/sagemath/ "This is a dummy package that checks that Sage is installed in the system"
- various other related and unrelated packages are published as sage-* - https://pypi.org/search/?q=sage

I was planning to change it to `sagelib`. But we could also try a systematic approach regarding branding and call it `sagemath-standard` (in anticipation of the modularization project's smaller distributions that could be called `sagemath-core`, `sagemath-ntl`, etc., see #29705).

The dummy package on pypi.org/project/sagemath was created so that other projects could be made to depend on it, and thus allow a user to install a custom package without having to recompile Sage. This has worked well to this day, you can install the darmonpoints package with a one-liner and alongside it checks that the installed version of Sage is the correct one.

At the time (2016 maybe?) we thought that this was a good idea, since it seemed like it was a long time until modularization would be a reality.

The dummy package only has one function (`check_version`) which compares the version passed as parameter with the sage version (via `from sage.all import version`).

I don't mind giving away this package if modularity is happening, since then there would a proper way to check for each of the required packages (there should be a way to check for the "whole sage" being installed, since it may be hard to decide on all the dependencies).

How should we go about it? I would rather have this kind of functionality (and I am assuming that the other two package maintainers that use the dummy package would be with me) available during the transition, specially if it takes more than a week or two...

What's the reason that this new metadata is only in build/.../sagelib and not (also?) under `src`?
Other than that, the changes look good to me.

Moreover, FYI, [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/) for Storing project metadata in pyproject.toml has been provisionally accepted (and will be fully accepted latest on 2021-03-01).

Maybe there could be a package with a more
descriptive name for that use case?

Maybe one of the following names, or something similar?
- `sagemath_installed`
- `sagemath_version`
- `sagemath_checkinstalled`
- `sagemath_checkversion`
- `sagemath_probe`

Some users assume from the name that it actually installs Sage,
and are surprised after installing it that things don't work as
expected; this comes up once in a while on the help and support
channels such as Ask Sage, sage-support, Stack Overflow...

Not an emergency, but something to consider.

```
You can read the PEP in question here [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/). I am currently using the Gentoo stable setuptools which is 50.3.0. sage is shipping 51.1.1 so I am guessing someone had a change of heart about strict enforcement between those two. I'll check by updating my own to the latest in Gentoo's tree (53.0.0).

But if the PEP get enforced the days of naming release .betaN and .rcN are numbered.
