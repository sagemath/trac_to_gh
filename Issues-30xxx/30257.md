The `FusionRing` method captures much of the structure of a modular tensor category. One aspect that it does not capture is the R-matrix, which is implemented in this ticket.

The results may be compared with calculations in Rowell, Stong and Wang (arXiv:0712.1377) and in Bonderson's thesis. Our results agree for several examples in Rowell, Stong and Wang. The reason for an apparent discrepancy in Example 5.4.5 was investigated.  (See[comment:3](#comment%3A3).)

I renamed `rmatrix()` to `r_matrix()` to be consistent with `s_matrix()` and I think this is easier to read.

I renamed `twist` parameter `reduce` to `reduced` to avoid a conflict with the `reduce` builtin Python method.

I also made some minor changes to the docstrings.

If my changes are good, then positive review.
