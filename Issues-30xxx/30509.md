<a id='comment:1'></a>To convert the vertices of `CubeGraph` to integers one can use `G.relabel(perm=int)` as the vertices are strings and `int(str)` will convert `str` to its integer representation.

However, doing so causes an overflow error (not sure why) when we iterate over `G`.
One can simply iterate over `range(2**(n-1))`, but I think the construction in this branch is even faster as everything happens in Cython without calling `CubeGraph`.

<a id='comment:2'></a>It's of course faster to not call `CubeGraph`. The drawback is to lose the placement of vertices done in `CubeGraph` (which is certainly the most expensive part of the method).

a minor improvement:

```diff
-    G = Graph(E, format='list_of_edges')
+    G = Graph([range(2**(n - 1)), E], format='vertices_and_edges')
```
also, may be it's enough to put the `sig_check` before the `for i...` loop ?
