Like the other workflows, it now runs only on tags and pushes to branch having "wsl" in the name (to ease testing if the workflow has to be changed).

Currently it dies if a system package does not exist - even for optional packages.
This is fixed with this ticket.

I'm also not sure, but looking at https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/texlive-generic-extra it looks like `texlive-generic-extra` is a (deprecated) wrapper around `texlive-plain-generic`.

(The dependency might actually be there not for the pdf/latex docs but for the html docs, which requires bibtex to generate the aux.)
