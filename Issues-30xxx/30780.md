Keywords: sd111

For most SPKGs, the `dependencies` file contains more accurate information than what can be found in the "Dependencies" section of `SPKG.rst`.

We simplify the format of the `dependencies` file by introducing new files `dependencies_optional`, `dependencies_order_only`, `dependencies_check`.

We extend the `sage-spkg-info` script so that, by simple heuristic text wrangling, the `dependencies` file is transformed to more human-readable form. When formatting for rst output for the "spkg" chapter of the reference manual, we format the dependencies as hyperlinks.
Example: https://d385f0db7500bdc8168e6f7f18d76741efa3742b--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/spkg/cvxopt.html#dependencies

Then we remove the redundant "dependencies" sections from the `SPKG.rst` files.
