At the moment Sage offers just a small set of 250 named knots (`src/sage/knots/knot_table.py`) taken form the [Rolfsen table](http://katlas.math.toronto.edu/wiki/The_Rolfsen_Knot_Table). Proper named links aren't available at all.

Nowadays, larger databases for knots and links are available at the [Knot Atlas](http://katlas.math.toronto.edu/wiki/Main_Page) pages in RDF-format and at [KnotInfo](https://knotinfo.math.indiana.edu/) as XLS / XLSX -files. Since parsing of CSV files is already supported by Sage, this is a good start to produce a Sage packages from these files containing about 3000 knots and 4000 proper links together with a lot of their properties and invariants.

Such a package has a couple of advantages:

1. Perform cross-checks for about 7000 links of alternative implementations of certain methods.
2. Do cross-checks against results listed in the *KontInfo* database.
3. Provide properties for these links that are not provided by Sage, yet.
4. Implement a link identification method for our link class (like *KnotFinder*).
5. Launch webpages containing additional information for a link or alternate graphical representations.

The aim of this ticket is to have the databases accessible in Sage together with conversion methods for the most important properties and invariants.

Many thanks to Allison Moore and Chuck Livingston for their kind permission to have this interface implemented and their offer to support us.


Having checked out the ticket for the first time, you have to run

```
./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url
sage -i database_knotinfo
```

in order to have the databases installed. If you like to run all relevant doctests on the installation use:

```
sage -i -c database_knotinfo
```

<a id='comment:11'></a>I feel like there should be something added to the `features/databases.py` file to test that the package is installed rather than within the class itself. I think this is how we generally want to do things (but perhaps I am not the best person to ask about this).

I am not entirely convinced by name of the method `identify_knotinfo`. I am thinking `knotinfo` is easier to discover, but I am also not sure this is a good name too. You should add a doctest showing an example that is not covered by the database to show that works (not just when it cannot be uniquely determined).

Now for some minor things:

It would be good to limit things in the docstrings to ~80 characters per line.

Missing blankline:

```
    def __init__(self, crossing_number, is_knot, is_alternating, name_unoriented=None):
        r"""
        Python constructor.

        EXAMPLES::
            sage: from sage.knots.knotinfo import KnotInfoSeries
            sage: L6a = KnotInfoSeries(6, False, True); L6a
            Series of links L6a
            sage: TestSuite(L6a).run()
        """
```

You don't need to apologize `:P`:

```
NotImplementedError: Sorry, this link cannot be uniquely determined
```
Also, error messages should start with a lowercase.

Do you need this import?

```diff
             sage: from sage.databases.knotinfo_db import KnotInfoDataBase
-            sage: from sage.env import SAGE_SHARE
             sage: ki_db = KnotInfoDataBase()
             sage: ki_db.filename.links
             <KnotInfoFilename.links: ['https://linkinfo.sitehost.iu.edu/', 'linkinfo_data_complete']>
```
I don't see where it is used in the doctest.

The bullet points are overindented:

```
Briefly, these differences are:

   - ``pd_notation`` --        KnotInfo: counter clockwise Sage: clockwise, see note in
     :meth:`KnotInfoBase.link`

   - ``homfly_polynomial`` --  KnotInfo: ``v``  Sage: `1/a`, see note in :meth:`KnotInfoBase.homfly_polynomial`.

   - ``braid_notation``    --  This is used accordingly: The crossing of the braid generators are positive
     in both systems. Here it is listed because there could arise confusion from the source where they are
     taken from. There, the braid generators are assumed to have a negative crossing
     (see definition 3  of `Gittings, T., "Minimum Braids: A Complete Invariant of Knots and Links <https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0401051>`__).
```

A trivial thing: `Examples::` -> EXAMPLES::`

What about `to_knotinfo`?

My approach is to keep the sage conventions fixed and do all necessary adaptions in the KnotInfo wrapper. There, I add to some of the conversion methods a keyword argument `sage_convention` which can be used to have the adaption performed.

So, are you suggesting to have `vz` instead of that, or in addition? If you mean *in addition*, I don't see an essential simplification. If not, I think it could be confusing if for one method (`homfly_polynomial`) the adaption is realized in class `Link` whereas for others (`jones_polynomial`, `alexander_polynomial`)  it would remain in `KnotInfo`.

Great! I missed that because I've tried `is_conjugate` (omitting the final `d`) which didn't terminate or results in an error from the Gap wrapper. That made me capitulate! Of course I will include that in the next commit.


BTW: As you predicted I encountered some other instances of the trivial diagram issue (#30346). In two cases you get errors (`is_alternating`, `khovanov_homology`) and in one case a wrong result (`jones_polynomial`). Furthermore, in `is_alternating` shouldn't we change this:

```
        if not self.is_knot():
            return False
```

into a `NotImplementedError`?

Shall I create a ticket for each case, or one for all? This is now #31001!

If this 'vz' normalization is used out there (and it is, as KnotInfo/LinkInfo uses it), it makes sense for Sage to acknowledge it, and provide the option of giving the HOMFLY polynomial in that notation. Users that are used to it might find it useful. And as a side effect, the code you are writing could be simpler.

The case of Alexander Polynomial might be different, since the ambiguity between different possible results comes from an ambiguous definition; instead of coming from different choice of notations.

The ambiguity of definition could be dealt with a synchronization of normalization (which I realized up to sign).

What about my question concerning `is_alternating`?

It is very easy to add a `TestSuite(KnotInfo).run()` test, which then will accidentally take a long time. Granted, it is on subsequent authors to avoid doing this, but a user might also do this, so this is now mostly a me being complete paranoid request.

This danger does not exist in this special case:

```
sage: TestSuite(KnotInfo).run(verbose=True)
running ._test_new() . . . pass
running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
```

This is because `KnotInfo` isn't inherited from `SageObject` which is not possible for `Enum`. Just the `TestSuite` for `KnotInfoSeries` use this method (indirectly). Obviously this `TestSuite` construction causes some confusion. I will try to improve this according to your hints!

BTW: The test that run 1.5 h was this (no way to do that accidentally, but sorry that I didn't make this clear enought):

```
sage: from sage.misc.sage_unittest import instance_tester

What stuff do you mean? Future changes in the real database for the first twenty links? I think changes in the values of the properties used can be ruled out and adding new properties wouldn't hurt.

The great advantage of these demo examples is that the basic functionality of this interface is permanently tested. So if someone introduces something into another library code that is incompatible, he becomes aware of it.

The link with the database somehow becomes broken, such as they change the name of a column. So the code breaks once you install the database. Granted, I think this is unlikely. Looking over the design a bit more, having a future developer should not naturally avoid the methods that differentiate between the two.

I agree that it is an advantage to have it tested. Although I do believe it should not be done locally within Sage's library but with a more robust testing framework. Yet, I believe that the benefits here clearly outweigh the costs.

No, I mean that there is a `_test_database` type method on the database class. The `-c` option is good, but I also think we shouldn't have that take too long.

There are patchbots/buildbots with the database that check that everything still works rather than a group of us with the database installed running tests after each beta release.

Thank you. I think that will help with the testing.

Dima, Miguel, anyone else have any additional comments before I set this to a positive review?

It is possible, but with all the different combinations, it is impossible to maintain as there is some different behavior depending on certain optional (experimental?) packages being installed. Although I would advocate for having at least one buildbot that has all optional (and possibly experimental) packages installed that runs tests.

Amusingly, I did the exact reverse for some people in the school of economics in my university.

Good one. We have identified that as a need for our data packages but I don't think we have done it with any. I cannot think of a python package that is a pure data load either. Possibly because people do not usually bother which is sad.

+At the moment Sage offers just a small set of 250 named knots (\`src/sage/knots/knot_table.py\`) taken form the [Rolfsen table](http://katlas.math.toronto.edu/wiki/The_Rolfsen_Knot_Table). Proper named links aren't available at all.

I've tried it now on my own and at least it is working. But since I needed a lot of trial error cycles I would appreciate it if you could have a look at it.

The current commit here concerns the adaption to the pip-installable package. Furthermore, it contains adaptations to SnapPy 3.0.1 and an addition of some verbose messages to `is_isotopic` (following a suggestion of knot theorists from the University of Regensburg).
