(Note that the iterator treats simplicial polytopes dually).\n\nIf a face is simple, then any intersections of it's facets is one of it's ridges or empty.\n\nAs this helps only sporadically, we cannot afford to compute for each face if it is simple. However, a cheap certificate of a face being simple is that it only contains \"simple vertices\" (with vertex figure a simplex).\n\nNow, at initialization the face iterator computes those \"simple vertices\" and checks inclusion of each face to determine if it is simple (if not at least 10 percent of the vertices we skip this check). If a face is simple, we can skip the costly inclusion checks.\n\nBefore this ticket:\n\n```\nsage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)

#30040 improved the face iterator for simple/simplicial polytopes.

Actually, the same trick can be applied for simple faces. (Note that the iterator treats simplicial polytopes dually).

If a face is simple, then any intersections of it's facets is one of it's ridges or empty.

As this helps only sporadically, we cannot afford to compute for each face if it is simple. However, a cheap certificate of a face being simple is that it only contains "simple vertices" (with vertex figure a simplex).

Now, at initialization the face iterator computes those "simple vertices" and checks inclusion of each face to determine if it is simple (if not at least 10 percent of the vertices we skip this check). If a face is simple, we can skip the costly inclusion checks.

Note that for the last instance, there isn't a significant amount of simple vertices so the old approach is chosen.

<a id='comment:7'></a>A remark to cythonizing and compiling:

- Current version:

```diff
+            foo = self.atoms.data
+            atoms_face_length = self.atoms.face_length
+
+            counter = 0
+            for j in range(self.atoms.n_faces):
+                if count_atoms(foo[j], atoms_face_length) == self.structure.dimension:
+                    counter += 1
+                    self.structure.simple_vertices[j//64] |= vertex_to_bit_dictionary(j % 64)
```
- Much slower:

```diff
+            counter = 0
+            for j in range(self.atoms.n_faces):
+                if count_atoms(self.atoms.data[j], self.atoms.face_length) == self.structure.dimension:
+                    counter += 1
+                    self.structure.simple_vertices[j//64] |= vertex_to_bit_dictionary(j % 64)
```
- As fast as the current version:

```diff
+            counter = 0
+            for j in range(self.atoms.n_faces):
+                if count_atoms(self.atoms.data[j], self.atoms.face_length) == self.structure.dimension:
+                    counter += 1
+                    self.structure.simple_vertices[j//64] |= vertex_to_bit_dictionary(j % 64)
+
+            for j in range(self.atoms.n_faces):
+                if count_atoms(self.atoms.data[j], self.atoms.face_length) == self.structure.dimension:
+                    self.structure.simple_vertices[j//64] |= vertex_to_bit_dictionary(j % 64)
```

I guess looking up `self.atoms` takes significant amount of time. What is suprising is that when you add a useless loop, things speed up. Either by cythonizing or compiling (I didn't check) it is figured, that we need the properties of `self.atoms` more often and this is optimized then.

Perhaps even more suprising. When you add

```
# cython: profile=True
# cython: linetrace=True
# distutils: define_macros=CYTHON_TRACE_NOGIL=1
# distutils: define_macros=CYTHON_TRACE=1
```
to the beginning of `base.pyx` the second version is just as fast. Makes it hard to profile where the difference in performance is, when it goes away when profiling.
