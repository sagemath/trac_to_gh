```
Currently we have `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK([sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi], ...)`, which causes system python3 to be rejected on many systems.

We should review whether this can be made more fine-grained.

`SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK` is specifically for checking whether we are going to install a shared library that may interfere with a system-provided version of the same shared library that the package is linked against.

**Package `sqlite`**....

```
$ grep sqlite build/pkgs/*/dependencies
build/pkgs/cryptominisat/dependencies:$(PYTHON) m4ri zlib libpng | cmake sqlite boost_cropped
build/pkgs/elliptic_curves/dependencies:| sqlite $(PYTHON)
build/pkgs/python3/dependencies:zlib readline sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi
```

`elliptic_curves` only seems to use the Python module sqlite - it does not depend on sqlite itself.

`cryptominisat` does not seem to depend on sqlite at all.

In this ticket, we remove these unnecessary dependencies and the sqlite depcheck for python3; and set `sqlite` as "not required" if system python3 will be used.

---

Follow-up tickets may address the following dependencies:
- #30949 Refine python3's `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK`: libpng, bzip2, xz, libffi 
- #30948 Package `xz` represents both the shared library `liblzma` and the `xz` binary.

<a id='comment:10'></a>The "depcheck" macro is used generally for avoiding a problem with conflicting shared libraries. Here, if we install `sqlite` from SPKG for any reason, then we insist that also `python3` must be built from SPKG. Otherwise, the system python's sqlite module is linked to some other libsqlite3, and then IF we load it together with our libsqlite3, this could lead to trouble.

Now, as the ticket summary explains, ACTUALLY we never use our libsqlite3 for anything other than building python3. 

So because of that, I think that we could, as you say, remove the depcheck for sqlite3 from spkg-configure.m4

However, if we ever add another package (providing a shared library linked into a Python module) that ALSO uses libsqlite3, then we would have to put the depcheck back...
