Reported at [Ask Sage question 53345](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/53345).

The output for this product
has an incorrect leading minus sign:

```
sage: N, q, k = SR.var('N, q, k')
sage: product(1 - q^k, k, 1, N)
-(-1)^N*product(q^k - 1, k, 1, N)
```

Expected:

```
sage: N, q, k = SR.var('N, q, k')
sage: product(1 - q^k, k, 1, N)
(-1)^N*product(q^k - 1, k, 1, N)
```

Fixed in Maxima by this commit:

FWIW, Sympy doesn't seem to be able to pull this one:

```
sage: from sympy import Product                                                 
sage: from sympy.abc import j, p, q                                             
sage: foo=Product(1-q^j, [j,1,p]); foo                                          
Product(1 - q**j, (j, 1, p))
sage: type(foo)                                                                 
<class 'sympy.concrete.products.Product'>
sage: foo.doit()                                                                
Product(1 - q**j, (j, 1, p))
```

Mathematica isn't more helpful:

```
sage: bar=mathematica("Product[1-q^j, {j, 1, p}]"); bar                         
QPochhammer[q, q, p]
```

Giac's answer can't be believed :

```
age: var("j,q,p")                                                              
(j, q, p)
sage: gargs=list(map(giac, [1-q^j,j,1,p,1]))                                    
sage: gargs                                                                     
[-q^j+1, j, 1, p, 1]
sage: libgiac.product(*gargs)                                                   
-q+1
```

HTH, but doubting it...

for what it's worth, it's either in the interface to maxima in `maxima_eval` or in maxima itself, what ultimately gets called is:

```
sage: var('n,q,i')
(n, q, i)
sage: expr = 1 - q**i
sage: from sage.interfaces import maxima_lib
sage: sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.maxima.sr_prod(expr, i, 1, n)
-(-1)^n*product(q^i - 1, i, 1, n)
```
I couldn't reproduce this on pure maxima, but I have never used it before, so it may well be there. 

EDIT: it may also be in the final conversion `max_to_sr`

Hi, thanks for the Maxima problem report.

I was unable to reproduce this in Maxima 5.44.0/SBCL 2.0.0/Windows 10.

Could you please report the details necessary to reproduce the problem:
* The exact version of Maxima/SBCL/OS you're using.
* The exact commands that were passed to Maxima.
* Any non-default global settings that Sage uses when calling Maxima.
* What does max_simplify_product do?
* What the var(...) declaration/statement does in Maxima terms. Does it declare anything special about those variables?
* What does "before this ticket" and "after this ticket" mean? Was it run on different versions of Maxima? If so, which ones?
Thanks,

            -s

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

Apologies for cc-ing you. Rather than in Maxima,
the bug might well be in Sage's interface to it.

In Sage, the bug can lead to wrong results as in

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_product                       
sage: x, n = SR.var('x,n')
sage: symbolic_product(-x**2, x, 1, n)
-(-1)^n*factorial(n)^2
```
or cause an error to be raised as in

```
sage: symbolic_product(-x, x, 1, n)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: factorial: factorial of negative integer -1 not defined.
```

Not sure what exactly gets sent to Maxima in those cases.

I have Maxima 5.44.0, ECL 21.2.1, macOS 10.14.6.

```
sage: pv = installed_packages()  # package versions
sage: print(', '.join(f'{p} {pv[p]}' for p in ['maxima', 'ecl']))
maxima 5.44.0, ecl 21.2.1
```

Sage calls Maxima with [the following global settings](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/9.3.rc0/src/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py#L168-L179):

```
besselexpand : true ;
display2d : false ;
domain : complex ;
keepfloat : true ;
load(to_poly_solve) ;
load(simplify_sum) ;
load(diag) ;
nolabels : true ;
```

"Before this ticket" is the observed bug.
"After this ticket" is the goal (so far not reached).

`"Before this ticket" is the observed bug. "After this ticket" is the goal (so far not reached).` I know this is just a convention, but, um, this is pretty confusing; I don't see how anyone who was not already among the cognoscenti would know what it means. "Observed" and "expected behavior" seems adequate.

I can't be sure about what's going on here, but I speculate the error is coming out of `simplify_product` in the `simplify_sum` code. 

```
simplify_product ('product(1 - f(k), k, 1, N));
 => (-1)^(N-1)*'product(f(k)-1,k,1,N)
```
The leading term is off by 1 (right?) -- I think this is the origin of the stray -1 which was observed.

I located the copy of that file in my Sage installation:

```
$ cd $(sage -c 'print(SAGE_ROOT)')
$ find . -name "solve_rec.mac"
./local/share/maxima/5.44.0/share/solve_rec/solve_rec.mac
```
and changed line 1112 as suggested by Dave.

Now I get the correct product from the ticket description:

```
sage: N, q, k = SR.var('N, q, k')
sage: product(1 - q^k, k, 1, N)
(-1)^N*product(q^k - 1, k, 1, N)
```
and for the sum of `-x^2`:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_product
sage: x, n = SR.var('x, n')
sage: symbolic_product(-x**2, x, 1, n)
(-1)^n*factorial(n)^2
```
but this still gives trouble:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_product
sage: x, n = SR.var('x, n')
sage: symbolic_product(-x, x, 1, n)
#0: simplify_product(product='product(-_SAGE_VAR_x,_SAGE_VAR_x,1,_SAGE_VAR_n))
...
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: factorial: factorial of negative integer -1 not defined.
```
It would be nice to fix that too.

Well, that's a different bug, although it's in the same file; looks like it is in the stanza which begins `if freeof(%n,aa) and freeof(%n,bb)` around line 1096. In the interest of clarity, I would suggest opening a separate bug report about it.

> Well, that's a different bug, although it's in the same file; looks like it is in the stanza which begins `if freeof(%n,aa) and freeof(%n,bb)` around line 1096. In the interest of clarity, I would suggest opening a separate bug report about it.

You are right. This is now tracked at #31557.

For what it's worth, a new Maxima version is on the horizon; it is being discussed on the mailing list, although no work on it has been announced. So my guess is that a new version will appear in, let's say, one to three months. I don't know whether that implies you should wait or not.
