Good catch!

However the proposed fix 

```
            if omega == 0 or vv == 0:
                return self.base_ring().zero()
```
is not acceptable, because the comparison with `0` can be very slow for complicated expressions. 
Also, this does not fix the root of the bug, which results from the `+=` operator acting on the zero element. It should be fixed per se, because it can lead to other errors.
FWIW, this bug was introduced in Sage 9.0 (everything is OK in earlier versions of Sage).

I was afraid that you say that. :D
I haven't found a fast check for components. Is there any?

I suspect the root is #28562. However, the operator `+=` should not be a problem here. When two elements are added from which one is the zero element, the other element is returned. Due to ticket #28562, altering the components of the zero element is not even possible and would result in an error. The only thing happening here is that the zero element is renamed.

You are right, `+=` is not the problem here. A way to fix the issue is then to check whether the computed result is the zero of the base ring (I guess by something like `resu is self._fmodule.base().zero()`), before changing its name at the end of the `__call__` method.

Changing the doctest outputs, especially in `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/vector_calculus/vector_calc_advanced.rst` left my aesthetic devil inside of me rebelling. A uniform output would be indeed nice.

If I remember correctly, our original argument for this behavior was that elements of modules/rings are usually treated immutable and that we should recover this behavior as far as possible. But thanks to Matthias with #30181, and the resulting changes in #30261, our elements are now undoubtfully viewed as mutable elements until they are stated immutable.

So, what about keeping the checks and always returning copies after each operation instead? This has also the great advantage that the results are again mutable (i.e. consistent behavior). Since we use fast checks that don't depend on particular elements now, this should also not affect the performance and would fit into the framework.

If we decide for the "return-copy-behavior", this ticket would become obsolete. Thus, I hope for a quick response so that I can work further on either one.
