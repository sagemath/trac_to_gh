... in particular provide an implementation of the `keys()` method.

We also add a generic method `AbstractFamily.items()` to complement the methods `keys()` and `values()`, mimicking  the `Mapping` protocol. (Split out from #34340.)

It looks that this uses only the method `keys()`, which can be defined without any reference to `AbstractFamily`. However, I understand that the inheritance from `AbstractFamily`  makes the bases of `FiniteRankFreeModule`'s more similar to those of other free modules in Sage, which is certainly a good thing => positive review from my side.
