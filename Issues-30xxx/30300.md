By itself, this change only improves "discoverability": If a user has an instance of `Basis_abstract`, currently they can get an element by calling `__getitem__` and either get an element or an error. (Or they would have to know the detail that the indices accepted by `__getitem__` are the underlying modules's irange.)

It is also preparation for #30229, which makes the standard bases of tensor modules (induced by the bases of their base module) explicit objects (instances of the subclass `TensorFreeSubmoduleBasis_comp`), instead of just being implicit in various algorithms.

It looks that this uses only the method `keys()`, which can be defined without any reference to `AbstractFamily`. However, I understand that the inheritance from `AbstractFamily`  makes the bases of `FiniteRankFreeModule`'s more similar to those of other free modules in Sage, which is certainly a good thing => positive review from my side.
