I tortured myself about this name for hours in order to include a split-second mention of it in a recent paper. The first application of it is to isotone or isotonic regression, where of course "iso" only means "same" and doesn't specify the direction. More recently and in other contexts, "monotone" has become more popular but suffers the same problem. You can find the ambiguous "monotone cone" in recent work on cone projections by NÃ©meth et al., for example.

In any case, I'm forced to add an adjective to either of those, which have the only claim to being "official." I've chosen "downward monotonic" because it's the only option that

* has been used to mean what I'm using it to mean
* has not been used to mean anything else (as far as I know)

So even though there aren't that many mentions of it, the name "downward monotonic" at least appears in a few published papers, and then always to mean the cone that I've implemented. The "cone of nonincreasing sequences" on the other hand, has been used instead to refer to the same cone in a little-ell space. "Isotonic" has likewise been used much more generally.

Finally, at least Gourion and Seeger have defined the "upward monotonic cone" officially, so if in the future we need to add its counterpart we have a reference for that.

This is unsubstantiated.

Note that it is not a "new name" of a cone. It is a description of its elements -- which is immediately accessible to anyone who has taken a calculus class.

Indeed, Niezgoda also calls it the cone of nonincreasing sequences once in "Bifractional inequalities and convex cones," but that's the only paper I was able to find using that name.


> Note that it is not a "new name" of a cone. It is a description of its elements -- which is immediately accessible to anyone who has taken a calculus class.


To match the other adjective-form names I would prefer "nonincreasing sequential," but I still think "downward monotonic" is a more evocative name. If we ever wind up with both, having "nonincreasing sequential" and "nondecreasing sequential" where the "increasing" one is decreasing and the "decreasing" one is increasing is more confusing than it has to be. The notation for the downward monotonic cone also justifies its name; the symbol `x^{\downarrow}` is standard to indicate the vector whose components are the components of `x` but arranged in nonincreasing order. The downward-monotonic cone is thus `(R<sup>{n})</sup>{\downarrow}`, and the upward-monotonic cone is `(R<sup>{n})</sup>{\uparrow}`. Since the downward cone is just `R^n` with a "down" after it and likewise for the upward cone, they're easy to remember.

In any case, I'm not prepared to argue about this forever. I didn't invent the cone, and isotonic/monotonic are the common names for it, with "monotonic" going back at least to Hardy, Littlewood, and Polya. I see no good reason to rename it (beyond the necessary mention of the direction of monotonicity) in sage.
