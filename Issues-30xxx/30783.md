Revert #25218.

Rationale: #25218 makes `a^(p/q)` where a is a number field element attempt to return a solution to `a^p = x^q` in the number field. This makes powering inconsistent with coercions, since number fields often (and, in the case of quadratic fields, automatically) come with a complex embedding and complex numbers of various kinds use the principal branch of the power function.

Among other confusing behaviors, we have

```
sage: I^(2/3)
I^(2/3)
sage: QQbar(I^(2/3))
0.500000000000000? + 0.866025403784439?*I
sage: QQbar(I)^(2/3)
0.500000000000000? + 0.866025403784439?*I
```
but

```
sage: I.pyobject()^(2/3)
-1
```
and

```
sage: QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: i^(2/3)
-1
```
but

```
sage: QQbar(i)^(2/3)
0.500000000000000? + 0.866025403784439?*I
```
as well as

```
sage: CC((i^(1/6))^2)
0.866025403784439 + 0.500000000000000*I
sage: CC((i^(1/3)))
-1.00000000000000*I
sage: i^(1/3)*CC(i)^(1/3)
0.500000000000000 - 0.866025403784439*I
```

Sorry, I didn't have time yesterday. This happens for i ∈ ℚ[i], not i ∈ SR (see the linked ticket). But note that #18036 aims to make the glbal symbol i refer to the generator of ℚ[i]. (In fact, I am currently trying again to make that change, and that's how I discovered the issue.)

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
I confirm with the branch I get this:

```
sage: QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)                                                                   
sage: i^(2/3)                                                                                        
I^(2/3)                                                 
sage: n(_)                                                                                           
0.500000000000000 + 0.866025403784439*I
```

Bot is green (except for startup time which I think we can ignore because this ticket does not change anything regarding to that).
