As reported in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/PByUmh8WuIM/NzB6gNkpAwAJ (and similar)

this leads to "Killed due to abort" for example on `debian-testing`.

Also on `ubuntu-groovy-standard` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1270680095)

We carve out a patch from #29719 to make it work

Blocker for 9.2 because it gives a segfault.
