Also, is it guaranteed that `scalar` is in the correct parent? I am slightly worried about the `inv = ~pivot` going outside of the ring.

Thanks. It's fixed.

I think it is OK because the function `hessenbergize_cdvf` is only called with a matrix defined over a field. I added a sentence in the doctest to underline this point.
