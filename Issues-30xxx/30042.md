the meaning of `#` there is quite unclear. (It actually means that it should be replaced by a number, but hard to figure out).

E.g. to get 8-vertex connected 4-regular graphs, one should do

```
list(graphs.nauty_geng("8 -d4 -D4 -c"))
```
whereas docs speak about `-d#` and `-D#`, temping one into trying
`-d# 4`, etc.
