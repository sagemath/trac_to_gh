As reported in [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/514hUpM7pBY), the intersection of polytopes is sometimes very wrong

```
a = Polyhedron([[0, -1, 1], [1, -1, 1], [1, 1, -1]])
b = Polyhedron([[0.0, -0.5, 1.5], [1.0, -0.5, 1.5], [1.0, 1.5, -0.5]])
c = a.intersection(b)
```
Here `c` should have been empty but is equal to `b`.

We fix it by upgrading to cddlib 0.94m, installing symlinks so that consumers of cddlib that have not been updated to work with the new header file locations (#29413) continue to work.

For some reason `cdd` thinks that row `1` is redundant. If you drop an inequality, everything is fine.

<a id='comment:8'></a>On the other hand, with RDF data and the internal representation used by `cdd`, it is not so hard to come up with (ugly) examples on which it can fail to produce a meaningful answer.

I'd say that computing `c` like in the ticket description should throw an error, 
as `a` is exact and `b` is not.
Or at the very least print a warning like

```

<a id='comment:10'></a>The behavior of coercing base rings is the correct and expected behaviour, I would say.

The failure of `cdd` has nothing to do with inexactness:

```
sage: a = Polyhedron([[0, -1, 1], [1, -1, 1], [1, 1, -1]], backend='cdd')                                                                                                           
sage: b = Polyhedron([[0, -1/2, 3/2], [1, -1/2, 3/2], [1, 3/2, -1/2]], backend='cdd')

<a id='comment:30'></a>We could to that with the symlinks and singular will pull in the correct library then, I think (at least if my assumption that the path is an ordered list and we lock for headers from sage first is correct).

I don't think we have to wait on singular. It's been leaking all along prefering the `cdd` system one over sage's header. It also checks for `cddlib`, so it won't fail.
