In Kerr_Schild.ipynb about input [13] we have the following markup.

```latex

Check of the identity  
  
\frac{x^2 + y^2}{r^2 + a^2} + \frac{z^2}{r^2} = 1    

```

Which should be: 
 {{{#!latex

Check of the identity  

\frac{x^2 + y<sup>2}{R</sup>2 + a^2} + \frac{z<sup>2}{R</sup>2} = 1

}}}

I could submit a revised .inynb but that seems excessive
