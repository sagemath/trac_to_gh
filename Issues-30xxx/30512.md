In Kerr_Schild.ipynb about input [13] we have the following markup.

```latex

Check of the identity  
  
\frac{x^2 + y^2}{r^2 + a^2} + \frac{z^2}{r^2} = 1    

```

Which should be: 

 ```latex
 
 Check of the identity  
 
 \frac{x^2 + y^2}{R^2 + a^2} + \frac{z^2}{R^2} = 1
 
```

I could submit a revised .inynb but that seems excessive
