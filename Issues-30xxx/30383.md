We refactor the code in `sage_spkg_enable.m4` and `sage_spkg_collect.m4` so that it becomes possible to add `configure --disable-SPKG` options to disable standard packages. This also simplifies `build/make/Makefile.in` slightly because it no longer has to make a distinction between standard and optional packages.

We demonstrate this by adding one such option, `configure --disable-notebook`, which disables building the Jupyter `notebook` package ... and all of its exclusive dependencies.  This is useful for people who want to use the system Jupyter notebook -- the Jupyter kernel is still built and can be installed there.

The new option appears before the `--enable...` options for optional packages.

We also make the configure help a bit more informative (by including the 1-line descriptions of the optional packages) and prettier.


```
$ ./configure --help
...
Optional Features:
  --disable-option-checking  ignore unrecognized --enable/--with options
  --disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]
...
  --enable-experimental-packages
                          allow installing experimental packages (default: no
                          = ask for user confirmation for each package)
  --enable-download-from-upstream-url
                          allow downloading packages from their upstream URL
                          if they cannot be found on the Sage mirrors
  --disable-notebook      disable build of the Jupyter notebook and related
                          packages
  --enable-4ti2={no|if_installed (default)|yes}
                          enable build and use of the optional package 4ti2: Algebraic, geometric
                          and combinatorial problems on linear spaces
                          * package info: ./sage -info 4ti2
  --disable-4ti2          disable build and uninstall if previously installed by Sage in PREFIX;
                          same as --enable-4ti2=no
  --enable-atlas={no|if_installed (default)|yes}
                          enable build and use of the optional package atlas: Automatically Tuned
                          Linear Algebra Software (BLAS implementation)
                          * package info: ./sage -info atlas
  --disable-atlas         disable build and uninstall if previously installed by Sage in PREFIX;
                          same as --enable-atlas=no
  --enable-awali={no|if_installed (default)|yes}
                          enable build and use of the experimental package awali: Computation of/with
                          finite state machines
                          * package info: ./sage -info awali
  --disable-awali         disable build and uninstall if previously installed by Sage in PREFIX;
                          same as --enable-awali=no
```


This is also preparation for #30556 (packages that will not work without openssl), and for testing modularized installs (#30778, #29864).

Doesn't this create a bajillion ./configure options that basically do nothing (because the packages are dependencies), and another bajillion that cause sage to function improperly (test suite failures, etc.)?

I think the original approach was more on-track, although I wouldn't have created a separate package type for it (we don't need to proliferate a new package type throughout the build system every time we tweak a bit of metadata). Instead I would have added an "enabled by default" (default: no) feature somewhere to the optional packages. Long-term, a way to control (and depend on) optional features is needed, but that's a much larger undertaking akin to USE flags in Gentoo.

Typo in the comments? In `m4/sage_spkg_collect.m4`, the descriptions for `SAGE_OPTIONAL_INSTALLED_PACKAGES` and `SAGE_OPTIONAL_CLEANED_PACKAGES` are the same. Should `installed` be changed to `uninstalled` as the last word in the description for the `CLEANED` version?

Configuring with `--disable-notebook` does indeed disable the notebook, as advertised. Sage builds, and so does the documentation. I was a little surprised that all doctests passed, too.

I don't know the syntax well enough to be able to thoroughly review this, unfortunately. Anyone else?

Maybe related to the fact that you can't start the notebook once you are running Sage from the command line? With SageNB you could run `notebook()` from within Sage, but this is not possible any more, or at least not in an obvious way, or maybe it just hasn't been implemented by us.
