We refactor the code in `sage_spkg_enable.m4` and `sage_spkg_collect.m4` so that it becomes possible to add `configure --disable-SPKG` options to disable standard packages. This also simplifies `build/make/Makefile.in` slightly because it no longer has to make a distinction between standard and optional packages.

We demonstrate this by adding one such option, `configure --disable-notebook`, which disables building the Jupyter `notebook` package ... and all of its exclusive dependencies.  This is useful for people who want to use the system Jupyter notebook -- the Jupyter kernel is still built and can be installed there.

The new option appears before the `--enable...` options for optional packages.

We also make the configure help a bit more informative (by including the 1-line descriptions of the optional packages) and prettier.


```
$ ./configure --help
...
Optional Features:
  --disable-option-checking  ignore unrecognized --enable/--with options
  --disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]
...
  --enable-experimental-packages
                          allow installing experimental packages (default: no
                          = ask for user confirmation for each package)
  --enable-download-from-upstream-url
                          allow downloading packages from their upstream URL
                          if they cannot be found on the Sage mirrors
  --disable-notebook      disable build of the Jupyter notebook and related
                          packages
  --enable-4ti2={no|if_installed (default)|yes}
                          enable build and use of the optional package 4ti2: Algebraic, geometric
                          and combinatorial problems on linear spaces
                          * package info: ./sage -info 4ti2
  --disable-4ti2          disable build and uninstall if previously installed by Sage in PREFIX;
                          same as --enable-4ti2=no
  --enable-atlas={no|if_installed (default)|yes}
                          enable build and use of the optional package atlas: Automatically Tuned
                          Linear Algebra Software (BLAS implementation)
                          * package info: ./sage -info atlas
  --disable-atlas         disable build and uninstall if previously installed by Sage in PREFIX;
                          same as --enable-atlas=no
  --enable-awali={no|if_installed (default)|yes}
                          enable build and use of the experimental package awali: Computation of/with
                          finite state machines
                          * package info: ./sage -info awali
  --disable-awali         disable build and uninstall if previously installed by Sage in PREFIX;
                          same as --enable-awali=no
```


This is also preparation for #30556 (packages that will not work without openssl), and for testing modularized installs (#30778, #29864).

Alternatively, we could also make it possible to disable any standard package.

Doesn't this create a bajillion ./configure options that basically do nothing (because the packages are dependencies), and another bajillion that cause sage to function improperly (test suite failures, etc.)?

I think the original approach was more on-track, although I wouldn't have created a separate package type for it (we don't need to proliferate a new package type throughout the build system every time we tweak a bit of metadata). Instead I would have added an "enabled by default" (default: no) feature somewhere to the optional packages. Long-term, a way to control (and depend on) optional features is needed, but that's a much larger undertaking akin to USE flags in Gentoo.

-We add `configure --disable-SPKG` options to disable standard packages.  (They will still be installed if they appear as dependencies.)
+We refactor the code in `sage_spkg_enable.m4` and `sage_spkg_collect.m4` so that it becomes possible to add `configure --disable-SPKG` options to disable standard packages. This also simplifies `build/make/Makefile.in` slightly because it no longer has to make a distinction between standard and optional packages.
 
-`./configure --help` shows these options before the `--enable` options for optional/experimental packages; and the help string is deliberately brief.
+We demonstrate this by adding one such option, `configure --disable-notebook`, which disables building the Jupyter `notebook` package ... and all of its exclusive dependencies.  This is useful for people who want to use the system Jupyter notebook -- the Jupyter kernel is still built and can be installed there.

+The new option appears before the `--enable...` options for optional packages.

Typo in the comments? In `m4/sage_spkg_collect.m4`, the descriptions for `SAGE_OPTIONAL_INSTALLED_PACKAGES` and `SAGE_OPTIONAL_CLEANED_PACKAGES` are the same. Should `installed` be changed to `uninstalled` as the last word in the description for the `CLEANED` version?

Configuring with `--disable-notebook` does indeed disable the notebook, as advertised. Sage builds, and so does the documentation. I was a little surprised that all doctests passed, too.

I don't know the syntax well enough to be able to thoroughly review this, unfortunately. Anyone else?

Transforming an existing Python process to a Jupyter kernel just amounts to running `sage.repl.ipython_kernel.__main__`, I think.  But to my understanding no feature in the Jupyter notebook allows to connect to an existing running kernel.  I found some discussions in this direction, for example https://github.com/jupyter/help/issues/298, https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/4066
