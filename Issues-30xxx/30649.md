This option installs a package without its dependencies, enabling experiments by experienced developers.

After #29013 (Support installation of Python packages into separate venvs depending on the python version), `sage-spkg` requires an installation-tree argument. As a result, currently `sage -p` is broken, as reported in #32751.

We remove this direct use of `sage-spkg`.

Making this change also removes the last use of `SAGE_LOGS` from `src/`

Since this now goes through a `make` target instead of using `sage-spkg` directly, after switching to a branch that adds a package, developers may need to manually invoke `bootstrap` and `configure` before using this option.



Depends on #33127

The code looks simple and it works for me. `./sage -p -s ...` and `./sage -p -c ...` work. One possible issue I can see is the one mentioned in the description: users may need to use `./bootstrap` and/or `./configure` first. But I think this is okay.

One real issue: `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py` fails doctests. I think the test is kind of stupid, though (the second one):

```
    Test ``sage --info [packages]`` and the equivalent
    ``sage -p --info --info [packages]`` (the doubling of ``--info``
    is intentional, that option should be idempotent)::
```
Why do we care whether `./sage -p --info --info PKG` works? `./sage --info --info PKG` doesn't work, so why should we care whether it works if we insert `-p`?

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A39):
> should `./sage -i` and `./sage -p` (with no further arguments) behave similarly? `./sage -i` builds some stuff, while `./sage -p` just prints a usage message and exits.

I suppose `sage -p` could be reduced to just saying "Nothing to do." instead of showing usage.

And it's not clear if `sage -i` running `make all-build` is really useful, so we could consider changing this behavior too.

But as you say, that would be a future ticket.

Looks good to me. It has some advantages that I didn't expect. Without this branch:

```
% ./sage -p pytest
Error: Installing old-style SPKGs is no longer supported
```
whereas with this branch, `./sage -p pytest` works fine (although it says "Successfully installed iniconfig-1.1.1 pytest-7.0.1" so it is still doing some dependency checking — probably `pip` or similar, not Sage's build system).
