(from #30061)

Symbolics going through maxima_lib can be made a bit faster by adding a few more methods that can be implemented faster. 

For example, the maxima-specific part of the implementation of `sage.symbolic.assumptions` can be folded into the maxima interface.
Then the maxima_lib implementation of the interface could use ECL objects for handling contexts instead of going through interface objects for this. This would remove the overhead seen in  [#30061 comment:33](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30061#comment:33)

Another direction (on the branch already) is to add a simpler version of `.eval` that only handles a single statement and does not  create an interface object.

I am not sure if this is the right kind of `compile`. ECL manual only mentions `compile-file` etc. Probably `compile` just expands macros.

No, that's full-on compile, which in ECL means: generate C code, run it through a C compiler, and dynamically link the generated object. The normal "interpreter" in fact is a byte code compiler.

I suspect that the gains to be had by compiling interfacing code are rather limited.

You might want to time how much the `ecl_sig_on` and `ecl_sig_off` calls in `ecl.pyx` are costing. I don't think we can get around those.
