(from #30061)

Symbolics going through maxima_lib can be made a bit faster by adding a few more methods that can be implemented faster. 

For example, the maxima-specific part of the implementation of `sage.symbolic.assumptions` can be folded into the maxima interface.
Then the maxima_lib implementation of the interface could use ECL objects for handling contexts instead of going through interface objects for this. This would remove the overhead seen in  [#30061 comment:33](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30061#comment:33)

Another direction (on the branch already) is to add a simpler version of `.eval` that only handles a single statement and does not  create an interface object.

I am not sure if this is the right kind of `compile`. ECL manual only mentions `compile-file` etc. Probably `compile` just expands macros.

You can check that running compile changes the function from byte-compiled to compiled.

No, that's full-on compile, which in ECL means: generate C code, run it through a C compiler, and dynamically link the generated object. The normal "interpreter" in fact is a byte code compiler.

I suspect that the gains to be had by compiling interfacing code are rather limited. I haven't profiled it, but I suspect that the context switching in terms of changing signal handlers (and FP exception settings?) is dwarfing most of that.

Those demands are incompatible in several places, so we end up making expensive switches.
You might want to time how much the `ecl_sig_on` and `ecl_sig_off` calls in `ecl.pyx` are costing. I don't think we can get around those.
