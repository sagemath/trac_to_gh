Pynac has a compile-time dependency on the Python library
but is not installed using Python package infrastructure.
This is problematic because Python users cannot install it
using standard Python tools - for example for testing
different Python versions.

- [Pynac home](http://pynac.org)
- [Pynac repo](https://github.com/pynac/pynac)

It would make sense for `src/sage/libs/pynac/pynac.pxd` and `pynac_wrap.h` to be shipped with this Python package, introducing a dependency on Cython.  (The only thing blocking this is `from sage.libs.gmp.types cimport mpz_t, mpq_t, mpz_ptr, mpq_ptr` - but that can be fixed by some minimal cut&paste.)

(The other parts of `src/sage/libs/pynac`, `constant.pxd`, `constant.pyx`, `pynac.pyx` use various imports from sage and must remain in `sage.libs.pynac`)


Unfortunately, there is an unrelated project that has claimed the name "Pynac" on pypi.org: https://pypi.org/project/Pynac

Collision between

- Pynac = "Py-Dynac" = Python bindings for the Dynac particle tracking code
- Pynac = "Py-GiNaC" = Python derivative of the C++ library GiNaC

Possible solutions:

- rename these projects to Py-Dynac and Py-GiNaC, or Pydynac and Pyginac
- no renaming but use the name pyginac on PyPI for "Py-GiNaC"

Note:

- "Py-Dynac" got the pynac name on PyPI
- "Py-GiNaC" got the pynac.org domain name

Regardless of how we handle getting "Py-GiNaC" on PyPI,
a disambiguation note in both "Pynac" projects would be
nice, with links to each other.

I will propose changes via pull requests or other
to add such a note in relevant places.

Thanks for the pointer.  This appears to be an active project. 
From https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyginac.moebinv.p/: 

  "This is a refresh and maintained version of the previous stalled project https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyginac/ It works with the current version of GiNaC."

The source (git) is at https://sourceforge.net/p/moebinv/pyginac/code/ci/master/tree/

It provides the Python packages `cginac` and `ginac`.

This part in `numeric.cpp` leads to a segmentation fault when importing the module:

```

giac might not be linked correctly, but I don't know. Also `./bootstrap` is missing from `setup.py`. Just running `./configure` isn't working.

Also I would guess that you need to include the header files as `depends=...`.

What is definitely missing is `gmptypes`. Also it seems weird that you name the module `ginac.libpynac` but then you cimport `from ginac.pynac import *` in `pynac.pyx`. This isn't defined.

Anyway, if I know just `./bootstrap; make` `pynac` and then include the folder `ginac`, then I'm back to your orignal problem.

First I got:

```
ImportError: /home/mi/kliem/Applications/pynac/ginac/pynac.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZTVN5GiNaC9containerISt6vectorEE
```

This I made go away by declaring things static in `pynac_wrap.h`. Then I get the original error about `library_init`.

The class `library_init` is defined in `ex.h`. However, the methods are then defined in `utils.cpp`.

But even if I change this, the error doesn't go ayay. By now, I don't understand anything anymore.

I am not currently setup for compiling on OS X, which may have trickier issue at linking.

I did some experiments. Not all changes in this branch are necessary to get things to work. In particular, I did many experiments trying to avoid this segmentation fault, but I couldn't find something. It's ipython specific. Sage just complains about linkage.

As reported above I get a weird segmentation fault, whenever I import `ginac.pynac`.

It goes away magically, if I import `ginac.gmptypes` beforehand. I don't know why.

Getting sage to start still does not work, because

```
ImportError: /srv/public/kliem/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/libs/pynac/pynac.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5GiNaC8py_funcsE
```

I don't know why it would be undefined. It is sage specific. In an Ipython session it is fine even if I add something that uses it to `ginac/pynac.pyx'

```diff
+cdef py_gcd(n, k):
+    return n*k
+
+
+def init_function_table():
+    py_funcs.py_gcd = &py_gcd
+
```

If I pip install this, I can run this function just fine in ipython:

```
(sage-sh) kliem@cofio:pynac$ ipython

In [2]: from ginac.pynac import *                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

In [3]: init_function_table()  
```

What is even more strange about this segementation fault is that in sage on develop branch I can run `import os` beforehand to fix this. This does not work in ipython.

Yes, same error here. `ginac/pynax.pdx` is missing from the configure file now.

After adding it, the build runs fine. Sage doens't start with the same stupid error:

```
ImportError: /srv/public/kliem/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/libs/pynac/pynac.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5GiNaC8py_funcsE
```

The segmentation fault in ipython went away for an `ImportError`:

```
ImportError: /srv/public/kliem/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ginac/pynac.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZN4giac25i_lex_is_strictly_greaterERKNS_7index_mES2_

OK, tried with all the new stuff. Stopped at the documentation again but different symbol than in [comment:23](#comment%3A23)

```
[dochtml] ImportError: /home/fbissey/sandbox/git-fork/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/libs/pynac/pynac.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5GiNaC8py_funcsE
```
which is

```
$ c++filt -n _ZN5GiNaC8py_funcsE
GiNaC::py_funcs
```

But why does

```
sage: cython(''' 
....: from sage.libs.pynac.pynac cimport * 
....: ''')    
```

works just fine on develop? I would say that things should work just fine, once everything is set up correctly. However, I don't know how to resolve the problems as I'm currently not even able to `cimport` from my own little two files project.

I might have found the problem:

In `setup.py`:

```diff
-       package_data = {'ginac': ['*.pxd', '*.h', '*.hpp']},
+       package_data = {'ginac': ['*.pxd', '*.h', '*.hpp', '*.cpp']},
```

This will place the `.cpp` files in the correct directory. We need them, because when we cimport we recompile some of them. When the `.cpp` files are not there, we get the missing symbols.

After doing this, I get a new error:

When you cimport you recompile `.pxd` file. And by this it is trying to recompile everything that was included there. If the corresponding `.cpp` files aren't found, there is a problem with that.

If we don't want to recompile everything, then we should put the `cdef extern from` into `pynac.pyx` and only do the type definitions in `pynax.pxd`.

This class can be used by other modules without recompiling the actual cpp class.\n\nThis is what the picture looks like to me.",

I don't even know if it is possible to import a `cppclass` in the `.pyx` part and to define in in the header then.

This option is definitely not mentioned here: https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/wrapping_CPlusPlus.html

The problem with this entire setup is that ginac was never properly compiled and linked as a C++ module. I have the feeling that you are trying to achieve something that cython doesn't want you to do.

- If you have a C++ library you can create a cython header for this and directly expose the cpp classes via that header (e.g. you can create a pip installable GMP header that uses an existing GMP installation).
- If you have some C++ files and you want to expose them directly by a cython wrapper, but the header of this wrapper will recompile your files and thus every module cimporting from this wrapper needs to be able to recompile this as well.
- You can create a proper wrapper class of a cpp class. This class can be used by other modules without recompiling the actual cpp class.

This is what the picture looks like to me.
