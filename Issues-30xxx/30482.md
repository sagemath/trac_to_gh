<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
Here are (all but one of) the issues that are not marked "done" in the file. I am numbering them, for ease of reference.

```
Todo 1: genuine coercions to real field, etc.
```

```
Todo 2: optimize is_even in numeric.cpp
```

```
Todo 3: Support pickle via the "archive" print mode.
```

```
Todo 4: need to be able to do this (from ginsh):
> collect_common_factors(x/(x^2 + x));
(1+x)^(-1)
```

```
Todo 5: Maybe change Sage's GiNaC to make a call to a Cython gcd function, then use
Singular, since Singular's gcd over QQ is much better than GiNaC's, I think,
and GiNaC *only* does GCD over QQ.  Actually, just make everything in normal.cpp
be implemented via Singular, probably...
```

If there is no discussion, I will open a single ticket that lists all 5 of these.

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
Here is the one issue that is missing from the above list:

```
* print degree order:
Now,
sage: x^2 + x^4 + x^3
x^2 + x^3 + x^4
sage: a^3*x^10 + x^12 - a^15
x^12 + a^3*x^10 - a^15

So it is printing from lowest to highest degree, like mathematica (or power series),
but unlike the standard sage convention (or maple, singular, MATH, etc.):
sage: R.<a,x> = QQ[]
sage: a^3*x^10 + x^12 - a^15
-a^15 + a^3*x^10 + x^12
sage: singular(a^3*x^10 + x^12 - a^15)
-a^15+a^3*x^10+x^12
```
I did not include it because this issue is also done, even though it was not marked that way in the file. With 9.3b6, we have:

```
sage: var("a");                                                                        
sage: x^2 + x^4 + x^3                                                                  
x^4 + x^3 + x^2
sage: a^3*x^10 + x^12 - a^15                                                           
-a^15 + a^3*x^10 + x^12
```
The terms go from highest degree to lowest, as they should.
