The correct way out of the mess with recommending `MAKE='make -j8'` instead of `make -j8` (which we do because of the outdated GNU make 3.81 on macOS - see #21610, #30345) is to use GNU make's POSIX job server protocol - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/POSIX-Jobserver.html

- Create a wrapper script in Python that tries to acquire >= A, <= B jobs from the jobserver within <= T wall clock seconds, sets the environment variable `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` to min(C, NUM_JOBS_RECEIVED), and invokes an arbitrary script.  

- Use this script as a wrapper for the sagelib build and docbuild.

- Replace the recommendation `MAKE='make -j8' make` by the familiar `make -j8`.

- In the top-level `Makefile`, filter out `-j` so that also users who continue to follow the old recommendation `MAKE='make -j8' make` benefit from the improvements, and to get rid of the "disabling jobserver" messages.

Copying my comment from #30345:

We're having trouble here because we're conflating two different things. The sage distribution has a top-level makefile that's used to initiate high-level tasks -- in particular installing SPKGs -- convenient to execute. Many of those high-level tasks themselves have build systems, separate from sage, that involve Make. We're passing the distribution's `make` flags down to the individual build systems and trying to coordinate the two as if it was one large build system, but it really isn't.

When in doubt, copy Gentoo: our package manager has `--jobs` and `--load-average` arguments that control how many package installation jobs get executed at once. We then also have a `MAKEFLAGS` variable that is passed to the individual build systems. (A better name would be something like `BUILDJOBS`, but the name is historical.) Sage's distribution Makefile can likely always be invoked with `-j1` with no performance penalty; it's the individual build systems that need something like `-j8`.

So, my suggestion: we copy Gentoo, and create something like a `SAGE_BUILD_JOBS` variable that defaults to `4` (everyone has at least dual-core by now?). We can then document that the top-level `make` need not be invoked with `-j<anything>`, and within that top-level Makefile, we would pass `-j${SAGE_BUILD_JOBS}` to any Make-based SPKG build systems. If we encounter a non-Make build system, we can then still do what the user asked, and pass whatever flags are necessary to run the build with `${SAGE_BUILD_JOBS}` threads.

I think that's less complicated that trying to coordinate the two levels, and doesn't wed us further to GNU's implementation of Make.

IIRC, Sage cannot be built with a nonGnu make, anyway.

IMHO Gentoo's way looks a bit like a workaround for old buggy Gnu Make.

No, the point of the jobserver is that one does NOT have to distinguish these "two different things". The jobserver manages the load. 

We do not have a problem with the jobserver. We are careful to pass down the make options to sub-makes. This works.

We have a problem with the python-based build systems that do not use the jobserver, and this ticket proposes a specific way to solve it.

The Makefiles generated by autotools are POSIX compatible, it's only the hand-written Makefiles that are a problem. We generate those with a bootstrap script anyway, so at least in theory it would be possible to coerce them into being POSIX compatible.

It's just a way to let users specify how many jobs should be used to build each package in a source-based distribution. The number of packages that will be installed simultaneously is something else. Our situation isn't much different, except that the "package manager" is also Make.

 The correct way out of the mess with recommending `MAKE='make -j8'` instead of `make -j8` (which we do because of the outdated GNU make 3.81 on macOS - see #21610, #30345) is to use GNU make's POSIX job server protocol - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/POSIX-Jobserver.html
 
+- Create a wrapper script in Python that tries to acquire >= A, <= B jobs from the jobserver within <= T wall clock seconds, sets the environment variable `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` to min(C, NUM_JOBS_RECEIVED), and invokes an arbitrary script.  
 
+- Use this script as a wrapper for the sagelib build and docbuild.
+
+- Replace the recommendation `MAKE='make -j8' make` by the familiar `make -j8`.
+
+- In the top-level `Makefile`, filter out `-j` so that also users who continue to follow the old recommendation `MAKE='make -j8' make` benefit from the improvements, and to get rid of the "disabling jobserver" messages.
