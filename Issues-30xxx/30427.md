From https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/g8TLPf61i3A/m/R-SmU68oCAAJ

When canceling obtaining the divisors of a (large) integer, one leaks massive amounts of memory for the following reason:

The following leaks at keyboard interrupt.

```
sage: cython('''
....: from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer
....: from sage.ext.stdsage cimport PY_NEW
....: from cysignals.signals cimport sig_check
....: def foo():
....:     cdef list sorted = []
....:     cdef Integer apn
....:     cdef Py_ssize_t i
....:     for i in range(100000000):
....:         apn = <Integer>PY_NEW(Integer)
....:         sorted.append(apn) 
....:         sig_check()
....: ''')
```

Apparently the elements in the list aren't garbage collected until the list is passed back to python.

The corresponding doctest only fails occasionally:

```

Some fix should be easy. Just use `try ... except ... finally` to properly clean the list at failure.

However, I don't understand entirely how `cdef list` is supposed to behave.

I would expect that cython has a chunk of "exit code" for each function that decrefs all the local variables of python-object types ("list" and "Integer" would be). These are the types that cython manages references for (`<PyObject *>` is not). If `sigcheck` doesn't hook into that code then this memory leak is rather fundamental, and then `sigcheck` for simple things like keyboard interrupts is much more complicated to get right -- you'd basically always need a try...finally around it to explicitly delete all the assigned-to local variables to avoid memory leaks!

In the example code, the `sorted` list probably leaks much more notably but the `apn` Integer should leak just the same (only with much smaller increments).

This seems to be cysignals unrelated. Instead the garbage collection breaks when registering a keyboard interrupt in sage permanently.

Define `foo` as follows:

```
sage: cython(''' 
....: from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer 
....: from sage.ext.stdsage cimport PY_NEW 
....: def foo(): 
....:     cdef list sorted = [] 
....:     cdef Integer apn 
....:     cdef size_t i 
....:     for i in range(100000000): 
....:         apn = <Integer>PY_NEW(Integer) 
....:         sorted.append(apn) 
....:         if i == 10000000: 
....:             raise ValueError() 
....: ''')
```

I can run `foo` many times and it never leaks. So far so good.

Now I keyboard interrupt `foo`. It runs until the end and then raises:

```
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
/srv/public/kliem/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py in run_code(self, code_obj, result, async_)

   3332             finally:

     11         if i == 10000000:
---> 12             raise ValueError()

ValueError: 

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

KeyboardInterrupt                         Traceback (most recent call last)
src/cysignals/signals.pyx in cysignals.signals.python_check_interrupt()

KeyboardInterrupt: 
```

And now things are broken. I can run `foo` once or twice and then lost memory starts piling up. Each run about 300 MB.

Even worse. If I keyboard interrupt for some nonsense reason before even cythonizing, then `foo` leaks right from the start.

From the following I deduce that really registering an interrupt is the issue, not the error raising itself:
- if I change the code above to raise a `KeyboardInterrupt`, it still collects fine (until I actually it ctr c) some time during my sage session
- if I have something as

```
try:
    sig_check
except:
    raise ValueError
```
  it still leaks, even though I never actually raised `KeyboardInterrupt`
