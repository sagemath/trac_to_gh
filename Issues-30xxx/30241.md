(from #30169)

We have the following identifications:

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 3, name='M')
sage: M is M.exterior_power(1)
True
sage: M is M.tensor_module(1, 0)
True
```

In contrast (in 9.7.rc0):

```
sage: M.dual() is M.dual_exterior_power(1)
True
sage: M.dual() is M.tensor_module(0, 1)
False
```

After #34474:

```
sage: M.dual() is M.dual_exterior_power(1)
True
sage: M.dual() is M.tensor_module(0, 1)
True
```

After #34474, the dual is implemented as a special case of `ExtPowerDualFreeModule`.

We create a separate implementation class `FiniteRankDualFreeModule` for it instead. We equip it with a `tensor_type` method, which allows the dual to participate in tensor products (see #34471).

The same is true for `M.exterior_power(1)` and `M.tensor_module(1, 0)`, but we do have this identification.

Fair point. Then I would vote for changing this to the expected outputs rather than creating a whole new class which has no further purpose than everything that is already there. Regarding Travis [comment:10](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30169#comment:10) this would be a convenient solution. Meaning: `M.exterior_power(1)` should return an instance of `ExtPowerFreeModule` and `M.tensor_module(1, 0)` should return an instance of `TensorFreeModule`. Then, one can implement the isomorphisms.

Either way, I agree that consistency is desirable here.

Allow me a side note: please remember that the whole manifold setup is built upon `FiniteRankFreeModule`. Modifying substatial things here might cause problems in the manifold implementation. It would be good to double check and, if absolutely necessary, make changes there, too. Henceforth, I suggest doctesting the manifold part, too.

Note that by creating the new class, both of the `ExtPowerDualFreeModule` and `TensorFreeModule` classes will be simplified because they no longer have to implement the special case.

Strictly speaking, they should return instances of `ExtPowerFreeModule` or `ExtPowerDualFreeModule` respectively, which are isomorphic to the base ring.

You definitely have a good point. And I totally agree that this should be unified, in either way.

But I am strictly against a new class dedicated to just one special case. At least, this is how I understand your proposal.

Thanks. Prompted by your remark, I have taken a look and I noticed that `VectorFieldModule` also has similar code. I have yet to study this code in detail (I am slowly making my way up the stack...), but it looks it has the same inconsistency between primal and dual:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: XM = M.vector_field_module()
sage: XM.tensor_module(1, 0) is XM
True
sage: XM.tensor_module(0, 1) is XM.dual()
False
```

<a id='comment:11'></a>I think I have a solution that could make everyone happy. 

In #30169, I had implemented `FiniteRankDualFreeModule.__classcall_private__` methods that delegate to other classes and implement the identification.

But we could as well take care of all identifications in the `FiniteRankModule.exterior_power`, `dual_power`, `tensor_module` methods.

Then the class constructors `ExtPowerFreeModule` could keep the strict behavior (I would also check that the case of degree 0 is correctly implemented - I don't think it is currently).

<a id='comment:26'></a>Looks good, thanks. There are some minor issues regarding the documentation of class `FiniteRankDualFreeModule`:

It would also be nice to update the `AUTHORS` field of `finite_rank_free_module.py`.

You probably already know it, but just in case: instead of running `make doc` (which is so slow that one always hesitate to run it), a fast way to generate the documentation regarding tensors on finite rank free modules is 

```
sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules html
```
The documentation is then located in `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/tensor_free_modules/index.html` under the Sage root directory. 

Michael, do you have any further comments?
