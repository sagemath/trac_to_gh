The problem is that we should take the saturation instead of the basis of the row space. In the example above the quotient of the ambient lattice with the computed basis was not torsion-free.

```

The volume is probably a usage error, I did not consider the case where a "cube" in the generated lattice has volume not equal to `1`.

Ok, the other issue probably as well.

This raises a simple question in sage: Given rational vectors. How do I calculate integer vectors that generate the induced lattice? Actually the given vectors or integer, but for the mathematical question, I consider them to be rational.

I guess the solution to the second part also solves the first part, because in case of the volume the generated lattice is always the entire lattice (otherwise the "ambient" volume is zero anyway).
