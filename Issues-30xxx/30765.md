Python 3.9 deprecates seeding based on hashing.

- https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/random.html#random.seed

  Deprecated since version 3.9: In the future, the seed must be
  one of the following types: NoneType, int, float, str, bytes,
  or bytearray.

This causes a doctest failure in Sage 9.2.rc0 using Python 3.9:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=0 src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori/randompoly.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori/randompoly.py", line 46, in sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.randompoly.?
Failed example:
    s=sparse_random_system(r, number_of_polynomials = 20, variables_per_polynomial = 3, degree=2, random_seed=123)
    DeprecationWarning: Seeding based on hashing is deprecated
    since Python 3.9 and will be removed in a subsequent version. The only 
    supported seed types are: None, int, float, str, bytes, and bytearray.
```

First discussed at #30184 (comments 25, 33, 40, 55).

Possible workaround: silence the deprecation warning for now,
as we did in other cases.

See for instance:
