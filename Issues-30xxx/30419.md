What do you mean by random_fail?

On the last ticket that touched this code, the test runs fine. I will build the latest sage and try it.

`random_fail` is the tag for tickets with failures that only appear sometimes, but not always. The code is probably doing something different occasionally, picking random primes or depending on iteration orders in dictionaries or some such.

That assert is a pretty stupid one, I added it there for my own sanity, to be sure that I'm getting `det(x - A)` and not `det(I - xA)` (which is how I usually think about characteristic polynomials of Frobenius actions).

Anyhow, the code starts with:

```
try:
        cp = frob_matrix.change_ring(ZZ).charpoly().list()
    except ValueError:
        # the given matrix wasn't integral
        cp = frob_matrix.charpoly().change_ring(ZZ).list()
    assert len(charpoly_prec) == len(cp) - (len(known_factor) - 1)
    assert cp[-1] == 1
```

In this example, the try should have succeeded, but somehow our characteristic polynomial is not monic.
