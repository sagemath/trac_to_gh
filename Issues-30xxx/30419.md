What do you mean by random_fail?

On the last ticket that touched this code, the test runs fine. I will build the latest sage and try it.

That assert is a pretty stupid one, I added it there for my own sanity, to be sure that I'm getting `det(x - A)` and not `det(I - xA)` (which is how I usually think about characteristic polynomials of Frobenius actions).

Anyhow, the code starts with:

```
try:
        cp = frob_matrix.change_ring(ZZ).charpoly().list()
    except ValueError:
        # the given matrix wasn't integral
        cp = frob_matrix.charpoly().change_ring(ZZ).list()
    assert len(charpoly_prec) == len(cp) - (len(known_factor) - 1)
    assert cp[-1] == 1
```

In this example, the try should have succeeded, but somehow our characteristic polynomial is not monic.
