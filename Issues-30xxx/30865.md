(from #29146, #30861)

There are several places where the spkg (`build/pkgs/*/`) and system package information (`build/pkgs/*/distros/*.txt`) is parsed:
- `bootstrap`
- `src/doc/bootstrap`
- `build/bin/write_dockerfile.sh`
- `build/bin/sage-get-system-packages`
- `tox.ini` (for `local-homebrew`, `local-conda`)
- `.github/workflows/ci-wsl.yml` (using powershell)
- `src/bin/sage-download-upstream`
- `m4/sage_spkg_*.m4`

The purpose of this ticket is to prepare refactoring of this code by extending the `sage_bootstrap` package.
- We update `sage_bootstrap.package` so that it understands non-normal packages (i.e., script and pip packages, which do not have `checksums.ini`)
- We change `sage -package list` so it supports the following invocations:
  - `sage -package list :standard: :optional:` (several "classes" (types), not just one)
  - `sage -package list --has-file=spkg-configure.m4 :standard:` (needed for `bootstrap`, `src/doc/bootstrap`)
  - `sage -package list --has-file=spkg-configure.m4 --has-file=distros/debian.txt :standard: :optional:` (needed for `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh`, `tox.ini`)
  - `sage -package list --has-file=SPKG.rst :all:` (needed for `src/doc/bootstrap`)
- We fix and extend `sage -package download` (follow up from #30648) so it supports
  - `sage -package download :all:` (again - was broken)
  - `sage -package download --allow-upstream :all:` (allows retrieving from `upstream_url`)
  and use it for `make download` (#29896), removing `src/bin/sage-download-upstream`

To run the testsuite of `sage_bootstrap`, use

```
  (cd build && tox)
```



Follow-up:
- The actual refactoring of the above scripts (#30947, #30951, #30968, ...)
- Wishlist item: `sage -package list --not-source=pip :optional: :experimental:` (would simplify `bootstrap`)

```
sage: L = list(range(10))                                                       
sage: K = list('abcd')                                                          
sage: id(L)                                                                     
140556349258880
sage: id(L+K)                                                                   
140556349147776
sage: L.extend(K)

140556349258880
```
So using `+=` to append elements to a list uses a quadratic amount of memory until the garbage collector gets called.

So I would suggest the following change:

```diff
- self.names += [package_name_or_class]
+ self.names.append(package_name_or_class)
```

as well as (5 times):

```diff
- self.names += [pkg.name for pkg in Package.all() if predicate(pkg)]
+ self.names.extend(pkg.name for pkg in Package.all() if predicate(pkg))
```

Ok, yes, I agree. Since #30648 is not in sage yet, this is why I don't see it in the diff.

<a id='comment:24'></a>> (cd build && tox)


I did that. It finishes with a big list of typos and says that there were errors while running the tests. When I scroll back, I can't see the errors, because the typos takes all of the lines in the finite history of the terminal. Are the output of tox logged somewhere?

I find it weird to call it `class` of package and use `cls` (which is often use for representing a Python class. Maybe `nature` of the package? Anyway, this is out of topic.

(0) I confirm that `sage --package list` works with inputs such as 
`--has-file=spkg-configure.m4`, `--has-file=distros/debian.txt`, `--has-file=SPKG.rst`. Also `sage --package download` works. Also `make download` works.

Sorry, I still have few more comments listed below.

(1) When I read the documentation of `sage --package`, I don't know what `Sage Bootstrap Library` means. I suggest to add a sentence in the file `sage_bootstrap.cmdline.py` to explain it. Something as follows, but please replace the verb `deal` with any more precise verb:

```diff
 description = \
 """
 Sage Bootstrap Library
+
+It deals with all of the packages in SageMath.
 """
```

(2) I don't like the following error message:

```
$ sage --package list :standardd:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/build/bin/sage-package", line 42, in <module>
    run()
  File "/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/build/bin/../sage_bootstrap/cmdline.py", line 306, in run
    app.list_cls(*args.package_class, has_files=args.has_files)
  File "/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/build/bin/../sage_bootstrap/app.py", line 69, in list_cls
    pc = PackageClass(*package_classes, **filters)
  File "/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/build/bin/../sage_bootstrap/expand_class.py", line 48, in __init__
    raise ValueError('Package name cannot start with ":", got %s', package_name_or_class)
ValueError: ('Package name cannot start with ":", got %s', ':standardd:')
```

It tells me the input cannot start with ":", but this is false, as `:standard:` is accepted.

Thus, I would suggest the following change in `sage_bootstrap/expand_class.py`:

```diff
             else:
-                if package_name_or_class.startswith(':'):
-                    raise ValueError('Package name cannot start with ":", got %s', package_name_or_class)
-                if package_name_or_class.endswith(':'):
-                    raise ValueError('Package name cannot end with ":", got %s', package_name_or_class)
+                if package_name_or_class.startswith(':') or package_name_or_class.endswith(':'):
+                    raise ValueError('Valid package classes are :all:, :standard:, :optional:, :experimental: or :huge:, got %s', package_name_or_class)
                 self.names.append(package_name_or_class)
```

Question: do you confirm that the following is a desirable feature?

```
$ sage --package list pari
pari
```

(3) Finally, in `build/sage_bootstrap/package.py`, I suggest:

```diff
-        if pattern:
-            return self.tarball_pattern.replace('VERSION', self.version)
+        if pattern:
+            return pattern.replace('VERSION', self.version)
```

(4) Question: What is the meaning of the expression `non-normal` in the file `build/sage_bootstrap/tarball.py` ?

I am currently waiting for the report of `make ptestlong`.

If it shows typos, then you probably ran `sage -tox`, not `tox`. If you don't have tox in your global environment, you can use `(cd build && sage -sh -c tox)`.

> Are the output of tox logged somewhere?


Yes, it creates a subdirectory `.tox`, where you'll find logs.

After that it seems tox does the same with other version of Python it finds on the system. With python 3.6, it returns two errors instead of three (the `test_checksum` does not fail).

Let me now check whether this is related to the current ticket or not by rerunning it after a `git checkout develop`.

I don't know how much this is related to the current ticket. From my point of view, I give a positive review to the commits done up to now.

(I also get the additional `test_checksum` failure on this branch. This test only passes on a release tag; this is not specific to this ticket. The other failures, also not specific to this ticket, should be investigated on a separate ticket.)

+(from #29146, #30861)

+There are several places where the spkg (`build/pkgs/*/`) and system package information (`build/pkgs/*/distros/*.txt`) is parsed:
+- `bootstrap`
+- `src/doc/bootstrap`
+- `build/bin/write_dockerfile.sh`
+- `build/bin/sage-get-system-packages`
+- `tox.ini` (for `local-homebrew`, `local-conda`)
+- `.github/workflows/ci-wsl.yml` (using powershell)
+- `src/bin/sage-download-upstream`
+- `m4/sage_spkg_*.m4`
+
+The purpose of this ticket is to prepare refactoring of this code by extending the `sage_bootstrap` package.
+- We update `sage_bootstrap.package` so that it understands non-normal packages (i.e., script and pip packages, which do not have `checksums.ini`)
+- We change `sage -package list` so it supports the following invocations:
+  - `sage -package list :standard: :optional:` (several "classes" (types), not just one)
+  - `sage -package list --has-file=spkg-configure.m4 :standard:` (needed for `bootstrap`, `src/doc/bootstrap`)
+  - `sage -package list --has-file=spkg-configure.m4 --has-file=distros/debian.txt :standard: :optional:` (needed for `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh`, `tox.ini`)
+  - `sage -package list --has-file=SPKG.rst :all:` (needed for `src/doc/bootstrap`)
+- We fix and extend `sage -package download` (follow up from #30648) so it supports
+  - `sage -package download :all:` (again - was broken)
+  - `sage -package download --allow-upstream :all:` (allows retrieving from `upstream_url`)
+  and use it for `make download` (#29896), removing `src/bin/sage-download-upstream`
+
+To run the testsuite of `sage_bootstrap`, use
+
+```
+  (cd build && tox)
+```
+
+
+
+Follow-up:
+- The actual refactoring of the above scripts (#30947, #30951, #30968, ...)
+- Wishlist item: `sage -package list --not-source=pip :optional: :experimental:` (would simplify `bootstrap`)

<a id='comment:45'></a>I tried `make download` and it failed to download scipoptsuite.

Which is expected. Indeed, reading from the last scipoptsuite ticket:

- #24662: Upgrade scipoptsuite to 5.0.1

> Upstream archive: <snip>

How do we deal with that?
