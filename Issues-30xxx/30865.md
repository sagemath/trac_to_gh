(from #29146, #30861)

There are several places where the spkg (`build/pkgs/*/`) and system package information (`build/pkgs/*/distros/*.txt`) is parsed:
- `bootstrap`
- `src/doc/bootstrap`
- `build/bin/write_dockerfile.sh`
- `build/bin/sage-get-system-packages`
- `tox.ini` (for `local-homebrew`, `local-conda`)
- `.github/workflows/ci-wsl.yml` (using powershell)
- `src/bin/sage-download-upstream`
- `m4/sage_spkg_*.m4`

The purpose of this ticket is to prepare refactoring of this code by extending the `sage_bootstrap` package.
- We update `sage_bootstrap.package` so that it understands non-normal packages (i.e., script and pip packages, which do not have `checksums.ini`)
- We change `sage -package list` so it supports the following invocations:
  - `sage -package list :standard: :optional:` (several "classes" (types), not just one)
  - `sage -package list --has-file=spkg-configure.m4 :standard:` (needed for `bootstrap`, `src/doc/bootstrap`)
  - `sage -package list --has-file=spkg-configure.m4 --has-file=distros/debian.txt :standard: :optional:` (needed for `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh`, `tox.ini`)
  - `sage -package list --has-file=SPKG.rst :all:` (needed for `src/doc/bootstrap`)
- We fix and extend `sage -package download` (follow up from #30648) so it supports
  - `sage -package download :all:` (again - was broken)
  - `sage -package download --allow-upstream :all:` (allows retrieving from `upstream_url`)
  and use it for `make download` (#29896), removing `src/bin/sage-download-upstream`

To run the testsuite of `sage_bootstrap`, use

```
  (cd build && tox)
```



Follow-up:
- The actual refactoring of the above scripts (#30947, #30951, #30968, ...)
- Wishlist item: `sage -package list --not-source=pip :optional: :experimental:` (would simplify `bootstrap`)



Depends on #30648

The current branch is doing this:

```diff
-    def download_cls(self, package_name_or_class):
+    def download_cls(self, package_name_or_class, allow_upstream=False):
```

So should the change I made in #30648 be reverted then?

(I recall that the problem fixed in #30648 was that `download_cls` method had no argument `allow_upstream` where `download` method did, so I changed `download_cls` to `download`.

Doing `+=` on lists creates a new list in memory as opposed to `append` or `extend`:

```
sage: L = list(range(10))                                                       
sage: K = list('abcd')                                                          
sage: id(L)                                                                     
140556349258880
sage: id(L+K)                                                                   
140556349147776
sage: L.extend(K)                                                               
sage: id(L)                                                                     
140556349258880
```
So using `+=` to append elements to a list uses a quadratic amount of memory until the garbage collector gets called.

So I would suggest the following change:

```diff
- self.names += [package_name_or_class]
+ self.names.append(package_name_or_class)
```

as well as (5 times):

```diff
- self.names += [pkg.name for pkg in Package.all() if predicate(pkg)]
+ self.names.extend(pkg.name for pkg in Package.all() if predicate(pkg))
```

> (cd build && tox)

I did that. It finishes with a big list of typos and says that there were errors while running the tests. When I scroll back, I can't see the errors, because the typos takes all of the lines in the finite history of the terminal. Are the output of tox logged somewhere?

I find it weird to call it `class` of package and use `cls` (which is often use for representing a Python class. Maybe `nature` of the package? Anyway, this is out of topic.

(0) I confirm that `sage --package list` works with inputs such as 
`--has-file=spkg-configure.m4`, `--has-file=distros/debian.txt`, `--has-file=SPKG.rst`. Also `sage --package download` works. Also `make download` works.

Sorry, I still have few more comments listed below.

(1) When I read the documentation of `sage --package`, I don't know what `Sage Bootstrap Library` means. I suggest to add a sentence in the file `sage_bootstrap.cmdline.py` to explain it. Something as follows, but please replace the verb `deal` with any more precise verb:

```diff
 description = \
 """
 Sage Bootstrap Library
+
+It deals with all of the packages in SageMath.
 """
```

(2) I don't like the following error message:

```
$ sage --package list :standardd:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/build/bin/sage-package", line 42, in <module>
    run()
  File "/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/build/bin/../sage_bootstrap/cmdline.py", line 306, in run
    app.list_cls(*args.package_class, has_files=args.has_files)
  File "/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/build/bin/../sage_bootstrap/app.py", line 69, in list_cls
    pc = PackageClass(*package_classes, **filters)
  File "/home/slabbe/GitBox/sage/build/bin/../sage_bootstrap/expand_class.py", line 48, in __init__
    raise ValueError('Package name cannot start with ":", got %s', package_name_or_class)
ValueError: ('Package name cannot start with ":", got %s', ':standardd:')
```

It tells me the input cannot start with ":", but this is false, as `:standard:` is accepted.

Thus, I would suggest the following change in `sage_bootstrap/expand_class.py`:

```diff
             else:
-                if package_name_or_class.startswith(':'):
-                    raise ValueError('Package name cannot start with ":", got %s', package_name_or_class)
-                if package_name_or_class.endswith(':'):
-                    raise ValueError('Package name cannot end with ":", got %s', package_name_or_class)
+                if package_name_or_class.startswith(':') or package_name_or_class.endswith(':'):
+                    raise ValueError('Valid package classes are :all:, :standard:, :optional:, :experimental: or :huge:, got %s', package_name_or_class)
                 self.names.append(package_name_or_class)
```

Question: do you confirm that the following is a desirable feature?

```
$ sage --package list pari
pari
```

(3) Finally, in `build/sage_bootstrap/package.py`, I suggest:

```diff
-        if pattern:
-            return self.tarball_pattern.replace('VERSION', self.version)
+        if pattern:
+            return pattern.replace('VERSION', self.version)
```

(4) Question: What is the meaning of the expression `non-normal` in the file `build/sage_bootstrap/tarball.py` ?

I am currently waiting for the report of `make ptestlong`.

If it shows typos, then you probably ran `sage -tox`, not `tox`. If you don't have tox in your global environment, you can use `(cd build && sage -sh -c tox)`.

> Are the output of tox logged somewhere?

Yes, it creates a subdirectory `.tox`, where you'll find logs.

Ok, I see. But after `cd build`, the tox command prints few lines and seems to get stuck:

After that it seems tox does the same with other version of Python it finds on the system. With python 3.6, it returns two errors instead of three (the `test_checksum` does not fail).

Let me now check whether this is related to the current ticket or not by rerunning it after a `git checkout develop`.

I don't know how much this is related to the current ticket. From my point of view, I give a positive review to the commits done up to now.

Matthias, I let you change the status to positive review if you think the tox issues are unrelated or if they can be dealt in another ticket.

I tried `make download` and it failed to download scipoptsuite.

Which is expected. Indeed, reading from the last scipoptsuite ticket:

- #24662: Upgrade scipoptsuite to 5.0.1

> Upstream archive: <snip>
> (DO NOT put on sage servers -- we cannot redistribute this archive)

How do we deal with that?
