I've heard that once upon a time there was a bot that created trac issues based on GitHub PRs. Apparently the bot was lost.

I found https://github.com/trac-hacks/trac-github which has the feature to "update the local git mirror used by Trac after each push to GitHub, and notify the new changesets to Trac;". Sounds like this is exactly what would be needed to allow PRs from github.
I couldn't find anything on how to install trac plugins here on sage.

The bot to turn pull requests to the SageMath repo at GitHub
into Trac tickets once existed.

In a [2014-08 sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/5d9NfgZJDmw/m/mrchAwmwB-0J), Robert described:

> All pull requests on github turn into tickets, so this easy web
> interface flow works now.


The bot stopped working around mid 2015.

In a [2016-07 sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/wcqMjrCZHHQ/m/jKOygA-sAgAJ), Paul wrote:

If you really want to do this I would recommend looking at the gitlab hook in the Trac plugin (ironically still hosted on GH though I would prefer to move it): https://github.com/sagemath/sage_trac_plugin/blob/master/sage_trac/gitlab.py

Most of this could be refactored to abstract out the [GitLab](GitLab) and [GitHub](GitHub) API differences.  Personally I am not motivated to do it though.
