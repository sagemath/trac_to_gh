Before this ticket, this crashes Sage:

```
sage: assume(x < 0)
sage: sqrt(-x).expand()
```
See [comment:12](#comment%3A12) for an explanation of the cause.

Original title and description:

**Some algebraic substitutions may crash Sage**

History : see this [sage-release](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/6RLsvBKi84I/m/2grSEQC1CgAJ) post and the following.

TL;DR: Sage crashes reproducibly on some substitutions:

```
f = function("f")
var("k")
Eq = f(x).diff(x, 2)/f(x) == k
with assuming(k > 0):
    Sp = desolve(Eq, f(x), ivar=x)
with assuming(k == 0):
    Sz = desolve(Eq, f(x), ivar=x)
with assuming(k < 0):
    Sn = desolve(Eq, f(x), ivar=x)
var("_K1, _K2")
with assuming(k < 0):
    Sn1 = Sn.subs(sqrt(k) == I*sqrt(abs(k)))
# Crashes Sage
```

This may result from an incorrect backtranslation from Maxima:

```
$ sage
... SageMath version 9.2.beta14, Release Date: 2020-09-30
... Using Python 3.8.6. Type "help()" for help.
...
sage: var("k")
k
sage: assume(k < 0)
sage: f = function("f")
sage: Eq = f(x).diff(x, 2)/f(x) == k
sage: S = desolve(Eq, f(x), ivar=x); S
_K2*cosh(sqrt(k)*x) + I*_K1*sinh(sqrt(k)*x)
sage: SS = maxima.subst([sqrt(k) == I*sqrt(-k)], S); SS
_SAGE_VAR__K2*cos(sqrt(-_SAGE_VAR_k)*_SAGE_VAR_x)-_SAGE_VAR__K1*sin(sqrt(-_SAGE_VAR_k)*_SAGE_VAR_x)
sage: SS.sage()
# CRASH:

# Etc. ad nauseam...
```

I mark this as `blocker` since it crashes Sage on (relatively) trivial algebraic operations.

Interestingly, I can't reproduce the problem in expression coming from another source:

```
$ sage
... SageMath version 9.2.beta14, Release Date: 2020-09-30
... Using Python 3.8.6. Type "help()" for help.
...
sage: k = var("k")
sage: assume(k < 0)
sage: f = function("f")
sage: Eq = f(x).diff(x, 2)/f(x) == k
sage: from sympy import sympify, dsolve
sage: S = dsolve(*map(sympify, (Eq, f(x)))); S
Eq(f(x), C1*exp(-sqrt(k)*x) + C2*exp(sqrt(k)*x))
sage: S._sage_()
f(x) == C2*e^(sqrt(k)*x) + C1*e^(-sqrt(k)*x)
sage: S.subs({sympify(sqrt(k)): sympify(I*sqrt(-k))})
Eq(f(x), C1*exp(-I*x*sqrt(-k)) + C2*exp(I*x*sqrt(-k)))
sage: S.subs({sympify(sqrt(k)): sympify(I*sqrt(-k))})._sage_()
f(x) == C2*e^(I*sqrt(-k)*x) + C1*e^(-I*sqrt(-k)*x)
sage: S._sage_().subs(sqrt(k) == I*sqrt(-k))
f(x) == C2*e^(I*sqrt(-k)*x) + C1*e^(-I*sqrt(-k)*x)
```

Since this problem appears in *compiled* code, I don't (yet) know how to tackle it. Advice welcome...

Depends on #30446

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
The error is trigerred by the existence of the assumption about `k`, which might trigger further transformations (which turn out to be toxic in this case).

This works:

```
f = function("f")
var("k")
Eq = f(x).diff(x, 2)/f(x) == k
with assuming(k > 0):
    Sp = desolve(Eq, f(x), ivar=x)
with assuming(k == 0):
    Sz = desolve(Eq, f(x), ivar=x)
with assuming(k < 0):
    Sn = desolve(Eq, f(x), ivar=x)
Sn1 = Sn.subs(sqrt(k) == I*sqrt(abs(k)))
```

This crashes Sage:

```
assume(k < 0)
Sn2 = Sn.subs(sqrt(k) == I*sqrt(abs(k)))
```

Ditto when using `with assuming...`.

Do you have pointers to an introduction to working on Sage library code ?

It certainly should not be a blocker, though. There are many other ways to crash Sage, after all.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:12'>Comment 12:</a>\nI think I found the bug. The definition of the `power::expand` method in ginac's `power.cpp` file includes the following snippet:\n\n```\n// search for positive/negative factors\n                for (const auto & elem : m.seq) {\n\tconst ex& e = m.recombine_pair_to_ex(elem);\n\tif (e.is_positive())\n\t\tprodseq.push_back(pow(e, exponent).expand(options));\n\telse if (e.info(info_flags::negative)) {\n\t\tprodseq.push_back(pow(-e, exponent).expand(options));\n\t\tpossign = !possign;\n\t} else\n\t\tpowseq.push_back(elem);\n}\n```\nThis is part of the code that calculates the expansion of a power of a product: `(a1 * a2 * ... * an)^c`, when `c` is not an integer.

I think I found the bug. The definition of the `power::expand` method in ginac's `power.cpp` file includes the following snippet:

```
// search for positive/negative factors
                for (const auto & elem : m.seq) {
	const ex& e = m.recombine_pair_to_ex(elem);
	if (e.is_positive())
		prodseq.push_back(pow(e, exponent).expand(options));
	else if (e.info(info_flags::negative)) {
		prodseq.push_back(pow(-e, exponent).expand(options));
		possign = !possign;
	} else
		powseq.push_back(elem);
}
```
This is part of the code that calculates the expansion of a power of a product: `(a1 * a2 * ... * an)^c`, when `c` is not an integer. The `else if` clause says that if some factor `ai` is negative, then we first need to calculate the expansion of `(-ai)^c`. However, suppose `n = 2` and `a1 =  -1`. Then this says that before we calculate `(-a2)^c`, we need to calculate `(-a2)^c`. This is an infinite loop. 

I think it will be easy to fix. I can't do it right now, but I should have time to write a patch in the next couple of days.

I don't know c++ or ginac, but I don't see any meaningful difference, so I don't think the ginac upstream fixed this.

Patching pynac to comment out the `else if` clause does eliminate the errors, so I am confident that this is indeed the bug we were looking for. However, it might be better to fix this `else if` clause, instead of just removing it. For example, with the clause removed, we have

```
sage: var("a b");
sage: assume(a < 0)
sage: assume(b < 0)
sage: sqrt(a*b).expand()
sqrt(a*b)
```
If we fix the clause, then I think the output would instead be `sqrt(-a) * sqrt(-b)`. I don't know whether that's really an improvement, but I think it's what the developers of ginac and pynac intended.

I will think about how to do that, but it's great if someone who knows something about ginac (and/or c++) wants to chime in.

Replying to [@DaveWitteMorris](#comment%3A15):
> I don't know c++ or ginac, but I don't see any meaningful difference, so I don't think the ginac upstream fixed this.

There is a difference in the type of `e` - in the new version it is `ex`, in the old one it is a reference (a kind of smart pointer) of type `ex`.

The way I read this code is that it is forming the product in `prodseq`, which is a stack, into which you push by calling its `push_back()` member function (if you an get the sign, at all).

Then, after the end of this loop, ~10 lines later, `prodseq` is checked for being non-empty, and the terms
are extracted from it.

```c++
	// If positive/negative factors are found, then extract them.
	// In either case we set a flag to avoid the second run on a part
	// which does not have positive/negative terms.
if (!prodseq.empty()) {
	ex newbasis = coef*mul(powseq);
	ex_to<basic>(newbasis).setflag(status_flags::purely_indefinite);
	return ((new mul(prodseq))->setflag(status_flags::dynallocated)*(new power(newbasis, exponent))->setflag(status_flags::dynallocated).expand(options)).expand(options);
} 
ex_to<basic>(basis).setflag(status_flags::purely_indefinite);
```

I don't see where an infinite loop you talk about in [comment:12](#comment%3A12) occurs.
Perhaps the bug is actually in that dreadfully long `return` statement.
This bit in https://ginac.de/reference/power_8cpp_source.html is much less
crazy.

> What I don't understand is why only negative terms are a problem.

The expression `e` (or what I called `ai`) is only one term, so it is definitely shorter than the entire product, so the recursive call `pow(e, exponent).expand(options)` is safe. That is why positive terms do not give an infinite loop. The problem with negative terms is that they call `pow(-e, exponent).expand(options)`. But `-e` (in other words, `-1 * e`) might be the entire product, in which case this is an infinite loop.

Commenting out the whole `else if` codebranch would result in some expressions being left
unexpanded, no?

we can just do a package patch, no need to make a new tarball.
And this patch is just the output of `git diff` in the right repo,
stored as `build/pkgs/pynac/patches/<name>.patch`

Could you put your try somewhere on the github?
It'd save me time to try to get a better test case.

yes, this looks to be the case. A proper way to fix this might be to get the
expression "length" in this case and if it is 2, tag it as "expanded".
(Doing this in C++ is a bit of work - mostly to understand the API)

I tried lots of things, but here is the best one that I could come up with by using my almost nonexistent understanding of ginac and c++:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <ginac/ginac.h>
using namespace std;
using namespace GiNaC;

class negsymbol : public symbol { 
    public:
    bool info(unsigned inf) const
    {
        if (inf == info_flags::negative) {
            return 1;}
        return inherited::info(inf);
    }
};

int main()
{
    realsymbol x("x");
    negsymbol y;
    numeric r(3,5);    
    cout << pow(x * y, r).expand() << endl;
    cout << y.info(info_flags::negative) << endl;
    cout << tree << x * y ;
}
```
After a warning message from `-Wundefined-var-template`, the output is

```
(x*symbol3)^(3/5)
1
mul @0x7fa050c091e0, hash=0x7ece0009, flags=0x3, nops=2
    x (symbol) @0x7fa050c09190, serial=2, hash=0x4d1fe6f1, flags=0xf, domain=1
    1 (numeric) @0x7fa050c06410, hash=0x160af41d, flags=0xf
    -----
     (symbol) @0x7fa050c090b0, serial=3, hash=0x7ecebd84, flags=0xf, domain=0
    1 (numeric) @0x7fa050c06410, hash=0x160af41d, flags=0xf
    =====
```
I think the `else if` clause is not triggered, because `y` is stored as `y^1` in the product, and ginac does not know that `y^1` is negative (even though `y` is negative). I do not know how to get ginac to realize that `y^1` is negative.

If I change `negsymbol y` to `possymbol y`, then the output is

```
symbol3^(3/5)*x^(3/5)
0
mul @0x7fd3add07800, hash=0x693c001c, flags=0x3, nops=2
     (symbol) @0x7fd3add076d0, serial=3, hash=0x693c85bf, flags=0xf, domain=2
    1 (numeric) @0x7fd3add04a30, hash=0x160af41d, flags=0xf
    -----
    x (symbol) @0x7fd3add077b0, serial=2, hash=0x76bbb6f1, flags=0xf, domain=1
    1 (numeric) @0x7fd3add04a30, hash=0x160af41d, flags=0xf
    =====
```
This means that the `if` clause was triggered, as it should be.

OK, I always having trouble doing a rebase, but I think I eventually got it correct.

I changed the package version to 0.7.27.p1 -- is that correct?
