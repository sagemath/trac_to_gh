<a id='comment:1'></a>Available upstream tarballs:

- lz, 2005993 bytes, https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.2.0.tar.lz
- xz, 2012444 bytes, https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.2.0.tar.xz
- zstd, 2103070 bytes, https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.2.0.tar.zst

Do we go for the smallest one, or do we have a preference for .xz?

For gmp 6.1.2 we used .bz2 but I don't see that listed at
