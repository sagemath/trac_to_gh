Consider the family of polyhedra `P_b` given by `A x <= b` for `A` fixed, `b` varying in a polyhedron `Q` (which could be the whole space `R^m`).

Given `b`, we compute the closure of the set of `b'` in `Q` such that `P_b'` is strongly combinatorially equivalent to `P_b`. This is a polyhedron.

By "strongly" combinatorially equivalent, do you mean what could be also refered to: "normally equivalent" (i.e. that the two polytopes have the same normal fan)?

This is very cool (and could help clean-up the method `.minkowski_summands`, which I find a bit weird).

So `Q` is what could be called the "type cone" or "deformation cone" and its rays correspond to the indecomposable Minkowski summands of the input polyhedron.

... this would be a GREAT addition to sage. I'll gladly review it and add some references to the docstring.

Yes, this is the same notion.
