The notion of hyperbolicity in graphs is a tree likeness parameter that measures how far is the distance metric of a graph from a tree metric. This parameter was added in #13808 but not exposed in graphs.
With this ticket, we can now do:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.hyperbolicity()
(1/2, [6, 7, 8, 9], 1/2)
```

Hello! I got the following error:

```python
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()                                                                                                          
sage: g.hyperbolicity()

   1052                   approximation_factor=None,

TypeError: hyperbolicity() takes at least 1 positional argument (0 given)

```

After looking at other cython files it seems that the problem can be fixed by adding `# cython: binding=True` at the beginning of `hyperbolicity.pyx`. Due to my ignorance about cython I don't know if this is the best fix.

In `graph.py` I would put `hyperbolicity` in the category `Distances` rather than `Graph properties` which is essentially used for functions returning a Boolean (like `is_tree`, `is_apex`, etc.).
