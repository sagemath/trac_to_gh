Under normal operation Windows searches for DLLs in the following order:

1. In the same directory as the main executable.
2. In various standard system directories.
3. Search `$PATH`.

On Cygwin, most DLLs are stored under /usr/bin, which is inserted early on the `$PATH`, but when in the Sage environment `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` supersedes it.

However, I discovered that the Cygwin port of sqlite3 contains the following nasty patch, for reasons I can't be sure of:

```diff

```

The function [SetDllDirectoryW](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setdlldirectoryw) is a system function which works a little like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `LD_PRELOAD` allowing an application to insert a non-standard directory into the DLL search path.

Why sqlite3 is doing this I don't know.  It has something to do with loading extensions apparently, but there's no reason it should assume I always want to load extensions from `/usr/bin` (e.g. what if I'm using a custom build of sqlite3 installed in `/usr/local/bin`.

It does this also when the library is first initialized, as opposed to just doing it before loading an extension and then unsetting it.  Thus this change to DLL loading behavior affects the rest of the application for the lifetime of the application.  It does get undone if `sqlite3_shutdown()` is called but this never happens normally.

How does this affect Sage?  It's not even obvious that Sage uses sqlite3, but in fact IPython does to store its history, so a sqlite3 database is connected to when starting up the Sage/IPython REPL.  This in turn impacts DLL search order for all libraries that haven't been loaded yet, and can cause Cygwin's system versions of those libraries to be privileged over any copies in Sage.

I think this might actually explain some related bugs I've seen in the past, but I'm not sure.

It's actually use during Sage start-up, but only when starting in the IPython REPL.  It's used by IPython because it stores the interactive history in a sqlite database.

This is actually how I was able to narrow this down: because the issue didn't occur when I imported `sage` in a normal Python session, or ran something like `sage -c 'print(1 + 1)'`.  It would only happen when starting with the interactive prompt, which was very bizarre.
