In a fresh git clone of Sage 9.2.beta6, `./configure -q`
printed two lines to stdout and one to stderr.

```
$ ./configure -q
11.4.3
1.5.3
(ignoring conda because no environment is active) $
```

To figure out where these come from, I ran `./configure`
in non-quiet mode, redirecting stdout to a file:

```
$ ./configure > dot-slash-configure-out.txt
(ignoring conda because no environment is active) $
```
and again, redirecting both stdout and stderr to a file:

```
$ ./configure > dot-slash-configure-out-err.txt 2>&1
$
```

The corresponding lines when running without `-q` seem to be:

```
...
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG ntl...
...
checking NTL version >= 10.3... 11.4.3
...
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG mpfi...
...
checking MPFI version >= 1.5... 1.5.3
...
checking for the package system in use... (ignoring conda
because no environment is active) homebrew
...
```
The `(ignoring conda ...)` part seems to go to stderr instead of stdout.

I did not know to run `./bootstrap` and don't know much about it.

I thought `./bootstrap` was automatically run by `./configure`.

I guess that is what happens on a fresh clone.

Now I realise `make distclean` does not clean all the way to the fresh clone state.

Thanks to your hint I now ran the following and quiet mode works!

```
$ ./bootstrap
src/doc/bootstrap:52: installing src/doc/en/installation/arch.txt and src/doc/en/installation/arch-optional.txt
src/doc/bootstrap:52: installing src/doc/en/installation/debian.txt and src/doc/en/installation/debian-optional.txt

src/doc/bootstrap:52: installing src/doc/en/installation/homebrew.txt and src/doc/en/installation/homebrew-optional.txt
src/doc/bootstrap:59: installing src/doc/en/reference/spkg/*.rst
src/doc/bootstrap:89: installing src/doc/en/reference/repl/options.txt
bootstrap:69: installing 'config/config.rpath'
configure.ac:314: installing 'config/compile'
configure.ac:89: installing 'config/config.guess'
configure.ac:89: installing 'config/config.sub'
configure.ac:43: installing 'config/install-sh'
configure.ac:43: installing 'config/missing'
$ ./configure -q
$
```

Positive review from me but please anyone more knowledgeable have a look too.

`configure` does not run it, but `make` runs it when the `configure` script does not exist or is older than its sources files (`configure.ac` and various stuff in `m4`, `build/pkgs`).

In that case, we could send them directly to `AS_MESSAGE_FD` or `AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD` instead of passing through `stderr`? I'm not 100% sure what goes on with all of the output/error descriptors in autotools, but some day someone may want to redirect stdout/stderr to separate files and it would be nice if stderr didn't contain normal output from the "checking..." results.

Yes, all messages that should be shown to the user need to be sent to `AS_MESSAGE_FD`. That's what all the autoconf macros for printing do.

`AC_RUN_IFELSE` redirects stderr to `AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD`. This is how compiler warnings/errors end up in `config.log`. I have the test program print to stderr for this reason. Neither compilers nor test programs have any business of printing to stdout. `AC_RUN_IFELSE` does not redirect stdout.

```

but now that I've tried it, it was nonsense to begin with. The file descriptor from the parent shell is meaningless in the newly-compiled program, and we don't have a way to append `>&AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD` to the command-line. So everything's fine here.
