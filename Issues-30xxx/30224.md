```
In a fresh git clone of Sage 9.2.beta6, `./configure -q`
printed two lines to stdout and one to stderr.

```
$ ./configure -q
11.4.3
1.5.3
(ignoring conda because no environment is active) $
```

To figure out where these come from, I ran `./configure`
in non-quiet mode, redirecting stdout to a file:

```
$ ./configure > dot-slash-configure-out.txt
(ignoring conda because no environment is active) $
```
and again, redirecting both stdout and stderr to a file:

```
$ ./configure > dot-slash-configure-out-err.txt 2>&1
$
```

The corresponding lines when running without `-q` seem to be:

```
...
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG ntl...
...
checking NTL version >= 10.3... 11.4.3
...
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG mpfi...
...
checking MPFI version >= 1.5... 1.5.3
...
checking for the package system in use... (ignoring conda
because no environment is active) homebrew
...
```
The `(ignoring conda ...)` part seems to go to stderr instead of stdout.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

I did not know to run `./bootstrap` and don't know much about it.

I thought `./bootstrap` was automatically run by `./configure`.

I guess that is what happens on a fresh clone.

Now I realise `make distclean` does not clean all the way to the fresh clone state.

Thanks to your hint I now ran the following and quiet mode works!

```
$ ./bootstrap
src/doc/bootstrap:52: installing src/doc/en/installation/arch.txt and src/doc/en/installation/arch-optional.txt
src/doc/bootstrap:52: installing src/doc/en/installation/debian.txt and src/doc/en/installation/debian-optional.txt

src/doc/bootstrap:59: installing src/doc/en/reference/spkg/*.rst
src/doc/bootstrap:89: installing src/doc/en/reference/repl/options.txt
bootstrap:69: installing 'config/config.rpath'

configure.ac:89: installing 'config/config.sub'
configure.ac:43: installing 'config/install-sh'
configure.ac:43: installing 'config/missing'
$ ./configure -q
$
```

Positive review from me but please anyone more knowledgeable have a look too.

`configure` does not run it, but `make` runs it when the `configure` script does not exist or is older than its sources files (`configure.ac` and various stuff in `m4`, `build/pkgs`).

In that case, we could send them directly to `AS_MESSAGE_FD` or `AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD` instead of passing through `stderr`?

but now that I've tried it, it was nonsense to begin with. The file descriptor from the parent shell is meaningless in the newly-compiled program, and we don't have a way to append `>&AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD` to the command-line. So everything's fine here.
