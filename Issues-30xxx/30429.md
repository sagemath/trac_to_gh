We standardize the arguments of the intersection to be

```
inline void intersection(uint64_t *dest uint64_t *A uint64_t *B, size_t face_length)
```

corresponding well with `C[i] = A[i] & B[i]` (and with `src/sage/data_structures/bitset.pxi`).

Previously it was

```
inline void intersection(uint64_t *A, uint64_t *B, uint64_t *C, size_t face_length)
```
This is confusing, once you get used to the standard way of doing it (`gmp` also has `mpz_add(mpz_t dest, const mpz_t src1, const mpz_t src2)`)
