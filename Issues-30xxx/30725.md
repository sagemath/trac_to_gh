```
Several packages force the use of `clang` because they cannot be built with a real gcc due to the use of Apple language extensions in system header files. 

For these packages, the use of `-march=native` introduced in #27122 causes build errors because `clang` does not understand these flags (even though `/usr/bin/gcc` does).

Tickets where code setting the compiler was explicitly introduced: #22999 (cmake), ....

```
$ git grep MACOSX_VERSION
build/pkgs/curl/spkg-install.in:        echo "OS X 10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4] Building with clang and --with-darwinssl."
build/pkgs/psutil/spkg-install.in:    echo "OS X 10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4] Building with clang."
build/pkgs/python3/spkg-build.in:        echo "OS X 10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4] Building with clang."
build/pkgs/r/spkg-install.in:        echo "OS X 10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4] Building with clang."
```

To test:

```
tox -e local-homebrew-macos-minimal
tox -e local-homebrew-macos-minimal -- cmake curl gmp
tox -e local-homebrew-macos-minimal -- ptest
```

To test with a real gcc (using a gcc-10 installed from homebrew):

```
tox -e local-direct-gcc_10 -- cmake curl gmp python3 psutil r
```

Those bits should have gone when I "normalised" clang for building sage on OS X. We were probably planing to remove them at a later stage and forgot.

Well, the opportunity is clearly now.

Are you saying that `CC=clang CXX=clang++ ./configure && make` does not work any more on macOS - or it does, but not setting CC and CXX breaks down?

It does work - in this case, these compilers will be tested for what flags they accept.

That's right. The issue arises from the `spkg-install` scripts changing the compiler to `clang` and continuing to use CFLAGS that have been determined by the configure script for a different compiler (`/usr/bin/gcc`).

R does not use `-march=native` anyway.
`python/spkg-build.in` is set up a bit different. `$CFLAGS` contains other stuff and `$EXTRA_CFLAGS` is contains the old `$CFLAGS`, so we need to set `$EXTRA_CFLAGS`.

Anyway, I think the main problem is that we run `testcfags.sh` before setting the compiler.
We might as well run this for `$CFLAGS` as well after possibly changing the compiler.
