I only see warnings from docker 

```
d11b78e03b7824a0bd0129b .ci/push-gitlab.sh sagemath
+ docker login -u gitlab-ci-token -p [MASKED] registry.gitlab.com
WARNING! Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin.
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /root/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store
Login Succeeded
```
so this is about a "credential helper" to be set up.

no idea what it is though. nothing to do with git, I think.
