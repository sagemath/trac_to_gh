Thanks @mkoeppe, it was indeed missing quotes. After a lot of trial and error, it seems to work now (at least the build runs now for almost 2h already).

Let me know if there is something else to do:

Please rename `build.yml` to something more specific - perhaps `ci-wsl.yml`

Also, please replace the hardcoded Ubuntu package lists by using the `debian*.txt` files in `build/pkgs`, following these examples:

```
$ grep  'PACKAGES=`sed' tox.ini
    homebrew:      bash -c 'PACKAGES=`sed "s/#.*//;" build/pkgs/homebrew*.txt`; {env:HOMEBREW}/bin/brew install $PACKAGES; {env:HOMEBREW}/bin/brew upgrade $PACKAGES'

Thanks for the feedback.

Replying to [@mkoeppe](#comment%3A6):
> Please rename `build.yml` to something more specific - perhaps `ci-wsl.yml`

I was thinking about adding basic builds (and doctests) for ubuntu-latest and macos-latest as well, so that this workflow serves as a basic check that the build works on all os. If this is not intended, I'll rename the file.


> Also, please replace the hardcoded Ubuntu package lists by using the `debian*.txt` files in `build/pkgs`, following these examples:

Done!


> BTW, the build errored with 

No idea why. I've read somewhere that there might be a problem parallel make (e.g `make -j8`). I triggered a build now with `j1`, let's see if it works.

> And you could use the steps starting with "Build and test with tox" from the job local-macos-nohomebrew defined in tox.yml

What exactly do you mean? This workflow is about homebrew, and I'm not sure how this translates to WSL.

These steps: 

```
      - name: Build and test with tox
        # We use a high parallelization on purpose in order to catch possible parallelization bugs in the build scripts.
        # For doctesting, we use a lower parallelization to avoid timeouts.
        run: |
          MAKE="make -j12" tox -e $TOX_ENV -- SAGE_NUM_THREADS=4 $TARGETS
```
Set TOX_ENV to just `local`, and it will take care of bootstrap, configure, make

```
      - name: Prepare logs artifact
        run: |
          mkdir -p "artifacts/$LOGS_ARTIFACT_NAME"; cp -r .tox/*/log "artifacts/$LOGS_ARTIFACT_NAME"

        run: |
          .github/workflows/scan-logs.sh "artifacts/$LOGS_ARTIFACT_NAME"
        if: always()
```
These steps package up and print logs.

I see in the github log: `wsl export EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS='--enable-build-as-root'` - that probably will only set it in a shell and then exit immediately.

Try instead `wsl env EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS='--enable-build-as-root' tox -e local -- SAGE_NUM_THREADS=4 build`

That sadly also doesn't wored, but I've now found a way using shared env variables between Windows and WSL.

Let's see what kind of build errors we encounter this time ;-).
The previous build (https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/runs/1062488288?check_suite_focus=true without tox) stopped with

Any ideas what the problem is here?

Moreover, should the following packages be installed via apt-get as recommended? Should I add them to the debian.txt?

Take a look at `tox.ini` and `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh`. We define and test 3 configurations, `minimal`, `standard` and `maximal`. In the `minimal` configuration, only the packages from `debian.txt` and `debian-bootstrap.txt` are installed. The other two configurations also use packages from `build/pkgs/*/distros/debian.txt`.

That doesn't work, as wsl only accept one command as an argument. But I think the current solution with the env statement in the action is cleaner anyway.

The recommendation in Sage currently is to use the environment setting `MAKE="make -j2"`. `tox` passes on `MAKE` (see `passenv` in tox.ini`)

So this is now ready for review.

Sadly it still doesn't build correctly. The current error message is

```

If somebody can explain to me why these cython files need to be copied to the build folder, I'll have a look a this problem in a follow-up ticket.


Moreover, it would be very helpful for further testing if the github actions could be activated for the sagemirror repo as well. Then I wouldn't need to create a PR at github first, but instead can directly test the action via trac.

My workflow is to keep the branch on trac and just push a temporary tag to my personal github fork of the repository.

github Actions on sagemirror are disabled, as it's just a mirror, and not even updated automatically. (I push there once in a while from a private copy of trac git repo, that's how it's supported - ideas how to automate it without running a cron job are welcome).
