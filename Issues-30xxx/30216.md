Thanks @mkoeppe, it was indeed missing quotes. After a lot of trial and error, it seems to work now (at least the build runs now for almost 2h already).

Let me know if there is something else to do:

Please rename `build.yml` to something more specific - perhaps `ci-wsl.yml`

Also, please replace the hardcoded Ubuntu package lists by using the `debian*.txt` files in `build/pkgs`, following these examples:

```
$ grep  'PACKAGES=`sed' tox.ini
    homebrew:      bash -c 'PACKAGES=`sed "s/#.*//;" build/pkgs/homebrew*.txt`; {env:HOMEBREW}/bin/brew install $PACKAGES; {env:HOMEBREW}/bin/brew upgrade $PACKAGES'

Thanks for the feedback.

Replying to [@mkoeppe](#comment:6):
> Please rename `build.yml` to something more specific - perhaps `ci-wsl.yml`

I was thinking about adding basic builds (and doctests) for ubuntu-latest and macos-latest as well, so that this workflow serves as a basic check that the build works on all os. If this is not intended, I'll rename the file.


> Also, please replace the hardcoded Ubuntu package lists by using the `debian*.txt` files in `build/pkgs`, following these examples:

Done!


> BTW, the build errored with 

No idea why. I've read somewhere that there might be a problem parallel make (e.g `make -j8`). I triggered a build now with `j1`, let's see if it works.

> And you could use the steps starting with "Build and test with tox" from the job local-macos-nohomebrew defined in tox.yml

What exactly do you mean? This workflow is about homebrew, and I'm not sure how this translates to WSL.

These steps: 

```
      - name: Build and test with tox
        # We use a high parallelization on purpose in order to catch possible parallelization bugs in the build scripts.
        # For doctesting, we use a lower parallelization to avoid timeouts.
        run: |
          MAKE="make -j12" tox -e $TOX_ENV -- SAGE_NUM_THREADS=4 $TARGETS
```
Set TOX_ENV to just `local`, and it will take care of bootstrap, configure, make

```
      - name: Prepare logs artifact
        run: |
          mkdir -p "artifacts/$LOGS_ARTIFACT_NAME"; cp -r .tox/*/log "artifacts/$LOGS_ARTIFACT_NAME"

        run: |
          .github/workflows/scan-logs.sh "artifacts/$LOGS_ARTIFACT_NAME"
        if: always()
```
These steps package up and print logs.

That sadly also doesn't wored, but I've now found a way using shared env variables between Windows and WSL.

Let's see what kind of build errors we encounter this time ;-).
The previous build (https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/runs/1062488288?check_suite_focus=true without tox) stopped with

Any ideas what the problem is here?

Moreover, should the following packages be installed via apt-get as recommended? Should I add them to the debian.txt?

Take a look at `tox.ini` and `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh`. We define and test 3 configurations, `minimal`, `standard` and `maximal`. In the `minimal` configuration, only the packages from `debian.txt` and `debian-bootstrap.txt` are installed. The other two configurations also use packages from `build/pkgs/*/distros/debian.txt`.

That doesn't work, as wsl only accept one command as an argument. But I think the current solution with the env statement in the action is cleaner anyway.

So this is now ready for review.

Sadly it still doesn't build correctly. The current error message is

```

```

If somebody can explain to me why these cython files need to be copied to the build folder, I'll have a look a this problem in a follow-up ticket.


Moreover, it would be very helpful for further testing if the github actions could be activated for the sagemirror repo as well. Then I wouldn't need to create a PR at github first, but instead can directly test the action via trac.

My workflow is to keep the branch on trac and just push a temporary tag to my personal github fork of the repository.

github Actions on sagemirror are disabled, as it's just a mirror, and not even updated automatically. (I push there once in a while from a private copy of trac git repo, that's how it's supported - ideas how to automate it without running a cron job are welcome).
