```
The `AA.random_element()` method only ever returns integers
among -2, -1, 0, 1, 2:

```
sage: ' '.join(str(AA.random_element()) for i in range(100))
2 0 0 2 1 2 -1 0 -2 -2 -2 0 -2 0 2 -1 1 0 0 1 1 -1 2 -1 0 2 1
0 0 2 1 2 0 -1 -2 -2 -1 2 -2 1 -1 -2 -2 2 -1 0 1 -1 2 2 0 -2
-1 -1 1 -2 2 0 2 -2 0 -2 1 -2 0 -2 -2 -2 -1 -2 -1 2 0 0 1 0 0
-2 0 -1 2 -2 0 -2 2 -1 -1 1 1 -2 -1 0 -2 -2 -1 2 -2 -1 -2 -2
```

That's a bit un-random, even by Sage standards.
A simple improvement would be to return the real part
of `QQbar.random_element()`:

```
sage: [QQbar.random_element().real() for i in range(5) ]
[-5.372281323269015?,
 -0.2000000000000000?,
 0.50000000000000000?,
 -0.50000000000000000?,
 0.1906845620110298?]
```

this would be a welcome improvement.

Seems almost good to go. Please:

- simplify as suggested by `@`mjo

I don't think my suggestion is any simpler; in fact, if I were writing the module from scratch I would probably try to do what Ben did.

The `AlgebraicField_common` class, even though it is technically a superclass of `QQbar`/`AA`, is used more like a "mix-in" than a parent. Its methods don't delegate to subclass implementations; instead, it contains only the few methods that are literally the same in its subclasses. For an example of what I mean, see `polynomial_root()` whose implementations differ only by one word, but are not abstracted into the superclass.

At this point I just don't think we should try to change the design without serious thought (and personally, I'd like this to be an easy ticket). So (re)implementing `random_element()` in `AA` would appear the path of least resistance.

I had this same thought last night, but when I tried it, using `poly_degree=4` took almost 3x as long to generate a number:

```
sage: %timeit AA.random_element(poly_degree=2)
2.67 ms ± 53 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: %timeit AA.random_element(poly_degree=3)
4.24 ms ± 80.1 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: %timeit AA.random_element(poly_degree=4)
7.3 ms ± 1.04 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

~2.5ms is already a horrendous amount of time to generate a number, especially if you plan to e.g. fill a matrix with them. I'd hate to make `matrix.random(AA,5)` take ~175ms more than I hate the slight loss of randomness.

would the following be faster:

- return `(a + b * AA(c).sqrt()) / d`
