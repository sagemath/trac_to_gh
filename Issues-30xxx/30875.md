```
The `AA.random_element()` method only ever returns integers
among -2, -1, 0, 1, 2:

```
sage: ' '.join(str(AA.random_element()) for i in range(100))
2 0 0 2 1 2 -1 0 -2 -2 -2 0 -2 0 2 -1 1 0 0 1 1 -1 2 -1 0 2 1
0 0 2 1 2 0 -1 -2 -2 -1 2 -2 1 -1 -2 -2 2 -1 0 1 -1 2 2 0 -2
-1 -1 1 -2 2 0 2 -2 0 -2 1 -2 0 -2 -2 -2 -1 -2 -1 2 0 0 1 0 0
-2 0 -1 2 -2 0 -2 2 -1 -1 1 1 -2 -1 0 -2 -2 -1 2 -2 -1 -2 -2
```

That's a bit un-random, even by Sage standards.
A simple improvement would be to return the real part
of `QQbar.random_element()`:

```
sage: [QQbar.random_element().real() for i in range(5) ]
[-5.372281323269015?,
 -0.2000000000000000?,
 0.50000000000000000?,
 -0.50000000000000000?,
 0.1906845620110298?]
```

This works, but I'm curious why you wanted to use a superclass method instead of

```python
def random_element(self, poly_degree=2, *args, **kwds):
    r"""
    ...
    """
    return QQbar.random_element(poly_degree, *args, **kwds).real()
```

Either way works, but your version moves some things into the "common" class that aren't common to the two fields (they only work for `QQbar`, and have to be overridden for `AA`). I didn't write these classes, but that seems to go against the design; e.g. nothing else in the "common" class is overridden in the subclasses.

Thanks for working on this ticket,
this would be a welcome improvement.

Seems almost good to go. Please:

- simplify as suggested by @orlitzky
- use raw string for new method's docstring as suggested by @fchapoton
- use `TESTS::` rather than `TESTS:` for test blocks

I don't think my suggestion is any simpler; in fact, if I were writing the module from scratch I would probably try to do what Ben did.

The `AlgebraicField_common` class, even though it is technically a superclass of `QQbar`/`AA`, is used more like a "mix-in" than a parent. Its methods don't delegate to subclass implementations; instead, it contains only the few methods that are literally the same in its subclasses. For an example of what I mean, see `polynomial_root()` whose implementations differ only by one word, but are not abstracted into the superclass.

At this point I just don't think we should try to change the design without serious thought (and personally, I'd like this to be an easy ticket). So (re)implementing `random_element()` in `AA` would appear the path of least resistance.

I had this same thought last night, but when I tried it, using `poly_degree=4` took almost 3x as long to generate a number:

```
sage: %timeit AA.random_element(poly_degree=2)
2.67 ms ± 53 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: %timeit AA.random_element(poly_degree=3)
4.24 ms ± 80.1 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: %timeit AA.random_element(poly_degree=4)
7.3 ms ± 1.04 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```

~2.5ms is already a horrendous amount of time to generate a number, especially if you plan to e.g. fill a matrix with them. I'd hate to make `matrix.random(AA,5)` take ~175ms more than I hate the slight loss of randomness.

If speed matters, for degree bound two,
would the following be faster:

- pick random integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`
  (with nonzero `d `)
- return `(a + b * AA(c).sqrt()) / d`

(with `c > 0` for `AA`, any `c` for `QQbar`)
and if so, is it worth special casing it?

Maybe similar recipes for degree 3 and 4
would have acceptable speeds?

Random expressible-by-radicals algebraics of a
wider range of degrees might be cheap-ish too?

I think so. For example (this is on a faster machine):

```
sage: %timeit QQbar.random_element().real()
1.17 ms ± 7.19 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)

versus

```
sage: def random_AA(degree):
....:     exponents = [0] + [1/k for k in range(1,degree+1)]
....:     return sum( QQ.random_element()*AA(ZZ.random_element(0,10))^k
....:                 for k in exponents )
....:
sage: %timeit random_AA(2)
715 µs ± 15 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
```

That's a subtly different kind of random, but does anyone care?
