A hyperplane arrangement is supposed to be checked for duplicate hyperplanes.
This works well in `QQ`:

```
sage: H1.<x,y> = HyperplaneArrangements(base_ring=QQ)
sage: A = H1([1,1,0],[2,2,0], warn_duplicates=True)
/usr/local/sagemath/dev/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/geometry/hyperplane_arrangement/arrangement.py:3352: UserWarning: Input contained 2 hyperplanes, but only 1 are distinct.
  warn('Input contained {0} hyperplanes, but only {1} are distinct.'.format(n, len(hyperplanes)))
sage: A
Arrangement <x + 1>

sage: A.n_regions()
2
```

In other base rings, this check can fail, resulting in false statements about the arrangement:

```
sage: R = QQ[sqrt(2)]
sage: H2.<x,y> = HyperplaneArrangements(base_ring=R)
sage: B = H2([1,1,0],[2,2,0], warn_duplicates=True)
sage: B
Arrangement <x + 1 | 2*x + 2>

sage: B.n_regions()
3
```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

The error can be tracked down to the `primitive` method for hyperplanes:
It is supposed to rescale linear multiples of hyperplane directions to a canonical "primitive" one.
This is currently not properly implied for every `base_ring`, as it uses `gcd` and `lcm` which for some base rings are just one regardless of the arguments.

Furthermore, the method currently uses `x.denom()` and `x.numer()` instead of `x.denominator()` and `x.numerator()`, two aliases which are only defined for `QQ`.

One solution would be to normalize the hyperplane equations instead of working with `gcd` and `lcm`. But this gives "ugly" equations, contrary to what the `primitive` method is meant to provide.

I kept the existing procedure of `primitive()` for `QQ` (using `numerator`, `denominator`, `gcd` and `lcm`) and introduced a new one for other base rings: The linear expression is scaled such that the first nonzero entry of the normal vector is one or negative one (as before, depending on the original sign and whether the option `signed` is set).

This seems to be compatible with all examples provided in the classes concerned, pass all the existing doctests in the hyperplane_arrangements folder and solve the problem of this ticket. It should also solve ticket #30749. I included suitable tests in the code.

Note however that this does change the coefficients by which hyperplanes are stored in an arrangement not based on `QQ`. This could break user code whenever it relies on a specific scaling of the linear expression. I would argue that fixing the mathematically incorrect statements yielded by the current implementation outweighs this inconvenience.

I am not really sure about what goes through `SR` and what doesn’t. For the tests to be meaningful, the base ring would have to contain some non-rationals. I replaced `QQ[sqrt(2)]` by `AA`. Is that fine?
