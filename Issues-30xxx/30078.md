A hyperplane arrangement is supposed to be checked for duplicate hyperplanes.
This works well in `QQ`:

```
sage: H1.<x,y> = HyperplaneArrangements(base_ring=QQ)
sage: A = H1([1,1,0],[2,2,0], warn_duplicates=True)
/usr/local/sagemath/dev/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/geometry/hyperplane_arrangement/arrangement.py:3352: UserWarning: Input contained 2 hyperplanes, but only 1 are distinct.
  warn('Input contained {0} hyperplanes, but only {1} are distinct.'.format(n, len(hyperplanes)))
sage: A
Arrangement <x + 1>

sage: A.n_regions()
2
```

In other base rings, this check can fail, resulting in false statements about the arrangement:

```
sage: R = QQ[sqrt(2)]
sage: H2.<x,y> = HyperplaneArrangements(base_ring=R)
sage: B = H2([1,1,0],[2,2,0], warn_duplicates=True)
sage: B
Arrangement <x + 1 | 2*x + 2>

sage: B.n_regions()
3
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>The error can be tracked down to the `primitive` method for hyperplanes:
It is supposed to rescale linear multiples of hyperplane directions to a canonical "primitive" one.
This is currently not properly implied for every `base_ring`, as it uses `gcd` and `lcm` which for some base rings are just one regardless of the arguments.

Furthermore, the method currently uses `x.denom()` and `x.numer()` instead of `x.denominator()` and `x.numerator()`, two aliases which are only defined for `QQ`.

One solution would be to normalize the hyperplane equations instead of working with `gcd` and `lcm`. But this gives "ugly" equations, contrary to what the `primitive` method is meant to provide.
