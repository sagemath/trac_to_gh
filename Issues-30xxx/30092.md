```
sage: VectorSpace(QQ, 5, inner_product_matrix=matrix.identity(5)).category()
Category of finite dimensional vector spaces with basis over (number fields and quotient fields and metric spaces)
```

As noted in #30061, it is not in the category `MetricSpaces`, and thus the element methods `dist` and `abs` (?!) are missing... 

The methods `__abs__`, `norm`, and `dot_product` are unrelated to the inner product matrix; only `inner_product` uses `inner_product_matrix`.



We define a category `NormedVectorSpaces` with element method `abs`.

We deprecate the `MetricSpaces` element method `abs`.


Follow-up: #30218: Category `InnerProductSpaces`

I have here a preliminary implementation (trying to learn from `FilteredModules` and `MetricSpaces`) of `NormedSpacesCategory` and `NormedVectorSpaces`.

Travis, if you could take a quick look to see if this seems to be going in the right direction...

However, moving it up one category level higher is a no-cost operation. Plus it means you don't have to deal with distinguishing the two categories (which can be slightly annoying at times).

Right. It looks it's best to start with normed additive groups (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/normed+group) - which use slightly weaker conditions.

It is still lacking a bit in implementation, but here is a proof-of-concept for the normed (additive) monoids and various other subcategories with concrete implementations for `ZZ` and `QQ` (which likely require more trivial doctest changes throughout Sage, but we should get all of the categories that we want done first in case it causes the output to change).

I don't want to do that for the multiplicative test because a ring, which is a monoid, does not satisfy the normed monoid properties because the norm of the multiplicative identity is not `0`. I guess that actually means this is not a regressive functorial construction. We only get a semigroup with a "weak norm," a function `S -> R` that satisfies `|ab| <= |a| + |b|` (do you know if something like this has a name?). Or we just have to acknowledge the abuse somewhere.

Let's see. I think this just means that there should be a separate category/functor for normed multiplicatively written monoids - satisfying `|ab| <= |a| + |b|` (and then multiplicative identities necessarily have norm 0). Call it `MultiplicativeNormed`. Just like `AdditiveCommutative` and `Commutative` are distinguished. 

This has nothing to do with the positive homogeneity property of norms on modules.

I would suggest that we just ignore norms on multiplicative monoids on this ticket. 

Then we can decide later whether we want the shared code to go through axioms on functionals, or through other means. 

Also, norms on multiplicative monoids have a close connection to valuations on fields -- and getting all of that right on one ticket is too large a scope.
