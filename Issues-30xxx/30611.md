Is there already a separate ticket for rpy2 somewhere? I seem to remember there was an issue (apart from py27 compatibility which we don't care about anymore).

python_igraph, can this be done without also upgrading igraph? I am expecting (gut feelings) issues.

Looks like I was thinking of 3.3.5 at #29441 but it is all fixed. I had an issue with it in Gentoo especially during testing that has been solved upstream in 3.3.6. So it is all good.

Thanks for the upgrades!

Just to verbalise the removal of pathpy (our name for path.py).

The commit message for the removal commit says it all:

```
build/pkgs/pathpy: No longer required by pickleshare, remove
```

Indeed: https://github.com/pickleshare/pickleshare/commit/2141463

Side note: on PyPI, `path.py` (which used to provide `os.path`
before the standard library included pathlib), is now `path`,
and there's a different unrelated `pathpy` for "analysis and
visualisation of time series data on complex networks with
higher- and multi-order graphical models".

- https://pypi.org/project/path.py (which we used to ship)
- https://pypi.org/project/path (its new name for newer versions)
- https://pypi.org/project/pathpy (unrelated)

Bye path.py. Sorry everyone for the noise.
