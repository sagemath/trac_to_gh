<a id='comment:19'></a>Thanks for the upgrades!

Just to verbalise the removal of pathpy (our name for path.py).

The commit message for the removal commit says it all:

```
build/pkgs/pathpy: No longer required by pickleshare, remove
```

Indeed: https://github.com/pickleshare/pickleshare/commit/2141463

Side note: on PyPI, `path.py` (which used to provide `os.path`
before the standard library included pathlib), is now `path`,
and there's a different unrelated `pathpy` for "analysis and
visualisation of time series data on complex networks with
higher- and multi-order graphical models".

- https://pypi.org/project/path.py (which we used to ship)
- https://pypi.org/project/path (its new name for newer versions)
- https://pypi.org/project/pathpy (unrelated)

Bye path.py. Sorry everyone for the noise.
