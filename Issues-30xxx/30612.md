When having several browser windows/tabs open with Three.js plots in them, it can be difficult to remember which is which. Since the `title` element in the generated pages is empty, the filename/path is displayed in !Chrome/FireFox, and something like `tmp_e0or9kcy.html` isn't very helpful.

This ticket proposes a new `page_title` viewer option to set the title of the HTML page. Additionally, the page title should be used to suggest a filename when using the "Save as HTML" menu item instead of the generic `graphic.html`.

For example:

```
show(dodecahedron(), page_title="Dodecahedron")
```
...should produce a page titled "Dodecahedron" that suggests the filename `Dodecahedron.html` upon saving.
