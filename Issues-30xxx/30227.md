... to set `include_dirs` and `extra_compile_args` in Cython distutils directives. Do not rely on `extra_compile_args` for that.

Likewise for other libraries.

Otherwise, the include search order is not correct (see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/SdxKEn7CuLM/3ru84S_zAgAJ)

Seems to work for me, thanks! See below. Sorry it took me so long.

```
