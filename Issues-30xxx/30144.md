Currently, there are reliability issues on [GitHub](GitHub) Actions, builds time out or die for no apparent reason, and then no docker images are pushed. 

We integrate this code into `tox.ini` so that the pushing happens after each of the steps defined by `DOCKER_TARGETS`.

Then one can pull an intermediate image and continue some tests locally.

The "password" here is a token specifically created for the GitHub packages repository. I don't have a major concern about storing it in cleartext.
