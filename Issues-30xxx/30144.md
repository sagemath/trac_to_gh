Currently, there are reliability issues on [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) Actions, builds time out or die for no apparent reason, and then no docker images are pushed. 

We integrate this code into `tox.ini` so that the pushing happens after each of the steps defined by `DOCKER_TARGETS`.

Then one can pull an intermediate image and continue some tests locally.

This warning is not new, it used to appear in the "push docker images step".

The "password" here is a token specifically created for the GitHub packages repository. I don't have a major concern about storing it in cleartext.
