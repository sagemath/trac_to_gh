Currently, there are reliability issues on [GitHub](GitHub) Actions, builds time out or die for no apparent reason, and then no docker images are pushed. 

We integrate this code into `tox.ini` so that the pushing happens after each of the steps defined by `DOCKER_TARGETS`.

Then one can pull an intermediate image and continue some tests locally.
