```
The `roots` method for polynomials returns a list of pairs
`(root, multiplicity)`.

Before this ticket, e.g. in Sage 9.2.beta12, this can fail:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(SR, names="x")("x^2").roots()
[0, 2]
```

With this ticket, we get the expected result:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(SR, names="x")("x^2").roots()
[(0, 2)]
```


Keywords: **polynomial, roots**

Thanks for filing this ticket and providing a fix!

You managed!

> I'm also not 100% sure that "algebra" is the right value
> for the "Component:" field.

I use "commutative algebra" for tickets about polynomials and friends.

Please add your full name in the "Authors" field on the ticket.

Please add the example from the ticket description as a doctest,
with the ticket number, as part of the EXAMPLES block in the
docstring for the `roots` method. Something like:

```diff
+        Check that :trac:`30522` is fixed::
+
+            sage: PolynomialRing(SR, names="x")("x^2").roots()
+            [(0, 2)]
+
```

When the ticket is ready for review, please set it to `needs_review`.
