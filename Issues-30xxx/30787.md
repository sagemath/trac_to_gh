As discussed in #28711#comment:64:

We split the current `p_group_cohomology` spkg:

In this ticket, we create the package `modular_resolution`, depending on meataxe-the-C-library, that installs:
- a standalone C library `libmodres.so` in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` 
- some executables in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`, linked against `libmodres`
- database of cohomology rings

This also fixes the build problems of `p_group_cohomology`.

Fixing the doctest failures of `p_group_cohomology` is outside of the scope of this ticket. That's #34333.

New upstream:
- https://github.com/sagemath/modular_resolution

Since Singular has some capabilities of computing non-modular and modular invariant rings of finite group actions, it would somehow make sense to include it in Singular. (EDIT: I think I'll ask the Singular developers).

Concerning the analogous question on the GAP package: In this case I think it makes no sense to make it an upstream package. It calls the executables of `modular_resolution`, writing initial data needed for p_group_cohomology into several files.

An important consideration is the ability to have `spkg-check` - e.g. for instance you can bundle the GAP package with modular_resolution, so that you can easily write some tests (in GAP) for all of them.

Good point!

If one bundles modular_resolution together with the cohomology database (which is currently the case) and with the GAP package, one could add the following self test: Call a function from the GAP package that uses an executable from modular_resolution to create initial data for, say, the cohomology ring of the dihedral group, which is part of the database, i.e., one can verify that the newly created initial data coincides what is found in the data base.

You argued in #28711, comment 58, that "an spkg should either be a pip-installable Python package, or it should be a non-Python package (which can install anywhere in SAGE_LOCAL)."

If I understand correctly, it means that not only the C library libmodres but also the database as well as the helpers for GAP and Singular shouldn't be installed by p_group_cohomology (whose main part IS pip-installable). So, 3.-5. should be split out as well and thus ARE in the scope of this ticket.

Then tell me by what source the database should be provided, if it shouldn't be p_group_cohomology.

I don't understand what you suggest.

Do you suggest to change the title and description of the ticket? Or do you suggest to keep the Singular and Gap helpers in p_group_cohomology and additionally to move the database from modular_cohomology (that's where the database currently is) to p_group_cohomology, even though it is basically a pip installable module?

> additionally to move the database from modular_cohomology (that's where the database currently is) to p_group_cohomology


If the `modular_cohomology` Makefile currently installs this database, there's probably no need to change it.

How can this be done? I mean, I know where the database ends up. Makefile.am is

```
ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4
SUBDIRS = src

dbdir           = $(datadir)/pGroupCohomology
dist_db_DATA    = group_cohomology_database.tar

install-data-hook:
	cd $(DESTDIR)$(dbdir) && tar xf $(dist_db_DATA) && rm $(dist_db_DATA)

uninstall-hook:
	rm -r $(DESTDIR)$(dbdir)

and so the database will be in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/pGroupCohomology`. But I guess a script returning that path (dependent on the value of `SAGE_LOCAL` is not what you suggest.

Is there a standard script in the autotools ecosystem that would provide the correct value of `$(dbdir)` both during and after (staged) installation?

Not depending on `SAGE_LOCAL` - the upstream package should make sense without Sage.
Rather, depending on the configured install prefix.

Like this: Create template file `modres-config.in`

{{{#! /bin/sh
echo "@datadir@/pGroupCohomology"
```
and add to configure.ac:

```
AC_CONFIG_FILES([modres-config], [chmod +x modres-config])
```

No, one would not want to read from DESTDIR.

Do I understand correctly that the syntax ``@`datadir`@`` in `modres-config.in` makes it so that the value `$(datadir)` is inserted during creation of the `modres-config` script, so that calling it later provides the final destination of the database? Well, I simply didn't know how to achieve this and is what I meant by a "standard script in the autotools ecosystem".

To be clear: Do you suggest that this script will be called by the Python/Cython modules to find out the location of the database?

Is this ticket only about creating a new `modular_resolution` spkg, or also to modify `p_group_cohomology` to use the new split-off spkg? Or shall the latter be done on a new ticket?

While we are at it: Is there a recommended way (at least recommended in Sage) to read from the output of system calls in Python? `os.popen`, or `subprocess.Popen` or something else?

I just learned the hard way how to write this portably for Python >= 3.6 (all our currently supported Python versions): Take a look at the most recent version (after #30758) of `src/sage/features/__init.py__` (`package_systems`).

```
        from subprocess import run, CalledProcessError, PIPE

        try:
            proc = run('sage-guess-package-system', shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, universal_newlines=True, check=True)
            _cache_package_systems = [PackageSystem(proc.stdout.strip())]
        except CalledProcessError:
            pass
```

In particular, I have no idea how to make pkgconfig aware of an autotoolized library: `pkgconfig.list_all()` contains neither `libmtx` nor `mtx` nor `meataxe` nor `modres` nor `libmodres` nor `modular_resolution`, although meataxe and modular_resolution are installed.

As an example, have a look at e.g. https://github.com/cddlib/cddlib/pull/40
(It changes a bit more than just adds `cddlib.pc` (adds some GMP-related stuff), so skip these parts)
Namely, 

1. `Makefile.am` needed

``` 
pkgconfigdir       = $(libdir)/pkgconfig
pkgconfig_DATA     = cddlib.pc
```

2. `cddlib.pc.in` (a template) needed to be created

3. `cddlib.pc` had to be added to the list in `AC_CONFIG_FILES`
   
After all this, `./configure` will fill in `cddlib.pc.in` and create `cddlib.pc`, which is then installed by `make install`.
Then Python `pkgconfig` module will be aware of that .pc file, no problem.

By the way, you can have a custom variable in .pc file - in your case, say, the path to the database - and request it using
`pkg-config --variable=... ...` calls (and from Python `pkgconfig` in a similar way)

<a id='comment:25'></a>Thank you, Dima!

I wonder: Should I add pkg-config to SharedMeatAxe as well? After all, meataxe uses arithmetic tables that are of course stored in some default folder, and currently its location is presented by an environment variable. This variable is needed by the meataxe executables (that are also part of the package), whereas libmtx uses a C variable for the same purpose.

I took this design from the original `MeatAxe` from which I forked off `SharedMeatAxe`, but I've never been happy with it.

On the other hand, I'm not sure if pkg-config would be the right tool in this case: The location of the tables is in fact not determined by the autotoolised build system, but it is determined at run time -- and moreover the arithmetic tables are first created by spkg-postinst, not by the makefile of meataxe.

It certainly simplifies things, to be able to use pkg-config to  check the library. E.g. imagine meataxe library available as a Debian package, and then naturally one would want to use it rather than to build Sage's one...

As to location of the tables/databases, naturally, there is no standard. Although I imagine there are defaults set in libmtx and in meataxe executables.

How is this determination happening at runtime? Checking an environment variable? Or there is a default value?

However, the location of the arithmetic tables does not depend on who built it. If the tables can not be found in the location specified by the environment variable MTXLIB resp. the C variable `MtxLibDir`, then it is attempted to read from `pwd`. And if this fails, it is attempted create new tables.

> As to location of the tables/databases, naturally, there is no standard. Although I imagine there are defaults set in libmtx and in meataxe executables.


The default is the current directory (so, better not use the default!).

> How is this determination happening at runtime? Checking an environment variable? Or there is a default value?


Actually I don't recall if there is a default value of the variable. You as a user of meataxe executables on the command line are supposed to assign a value to the environment variable, and you as a programmer of code linked against libmtx are supposed to assign a value to the C variable. Sage does both automatically, if you import from sage.libs.meataxe.

So, the user (Sage, in this case) has full control. If one fails to assign a value, then the current directory is used, or an error results (I don't recall).

Don't worry about this, I'll push a branch upstream with these changes applied.

After that, for the new release we'd also need to sort out packaging of GAP and Singular files, as Matthias
says. But it's certainly most important to fix the maths issues!

Thank you! So, what's the plan now? I suppose I have to pull from the upstream repository to which you posted the new version, and then try to install it on my laptop, so that I can see what is happening on the mathematical side.

Question: Has there been a recent Singular upgrade in Sage? If so: What version of Sage?

You'll get a VM with this branch pulled (but without p_group_cohomology built, so you'd need to do

How? I'm logged in to my github account and visited my profile, but I see no hint how to upload my public ssh key. Also it is a long time since I last created an ssh key. How do I do this? On sage-devel, I saw that some special type of key is now needed.

It's in Settings, not in Profile.

Nothing special, just secure by modern standards. Either a long RSA key (say, 4096 bits), or 
an ed25519 key. The command to run for the latter is `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`

one can make patches against the package tarball, instead of re-creating the tarball

Probably the best thing would be to display a deprecation message when `sage.docs.instancedoc` (maybe also changed to a `.py` file) is imported and the redirect is a normal import.

Well, this still will need to be fixed upstream anyways.

That would come as a surprise. Anyway, I used several worktrees, and I see a .git file (not a folder) whose content is `gitdir: /home/king/Sage/git/sage/.git/worktrees/py3`

Anyway, now I have a new Sage installation, I see not an urgent need to fix the old one, although I won't delete the old installations.

That is very strange.

Indeed, it is not worth the trouble.

That is because Github is not trac. They are different servers and both require your (public) ssh key.

+We split the current `p_group_cohomology` spkg:
+
+In this ticket, we create the package `modular_resolution`, depending on meataxe-the-C-library, that installs:
+- a standalone C library `libmodres.so` in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` 
+- some executables in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`, linked against `libmodres`
+- database of cohomology rings
+
+This also fixes the build problems of `p_group_cohomology`.

Simon (or John or someone else if you know), if you could comment on the correctness of the test output, that would be appreciated.

In the test, an invariant of the group is calculated. So, if there are two different results than either the result computed by the old package version or the result computed by the new package version is wrong (or both). Therefore certainly one of the two versions has a bug.

I could ask Graham Ellis (my co-author in a publication on "persistant group cohomology") if he can compute this example: I know that he has software developed independently of `p_group_cohomology`.

Thank you for your thoughts. Could you please ask him? Independent corroboration would be great.
