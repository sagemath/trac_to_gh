As a follow-up to #29278, #29280: If we use Unicode variable names in `SR`, declaring a domain gives an error:

```
sage: SR.var('π', domain='real')
RuntimeError: ECL says: THROW: The catch MACSYMA-QUIT is undefined.
SystemError: <built-in method var of sage.symbolic.ring.SymbolicRing object at 0x334506908> returned a result with an error set
```

This comes from our ECL interface:

```
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: u_symbol = EclObject('🔥')
sage: u_symbol
<repr(<sage.libs.ecl.EclObject at 0x337e7b3c8>) failed: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x94 in position 2: invalid start byte>
sage: u_symbol.python()
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x94 in position 2: invalid start byte
```

Also note:

```
sage: b_symbol = EclObject(bytes([166]))
sage: b_symbol
<repr(<sage.libs.ecl.EclObject at 0x337e7b058>) failed: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa6 in position 0: invalid start byte>
```

Should our Maxima interface support unicode with this branch now, or do you know what else is needed to make this work? The following used to give an error, but results in a crash now:

```
sage: var('ξ')._maxima_()

Condition of type: SIMPLE-ERROR
Cannot coerce string Cannot coerce string $_SAGE_VAR_ξ to a base-string to a base-string
No restarts available.
...
Excessive debugger depth! Probable infinite recursion!
Quitting.

Also, please add a doctest for the new functionality.

This bug is still present in ECL 20.4.24.  The above code is from Maxima's `PRINT-INVERT-CASE` function in `commac.lisp`.

<a id='comment:28'></a>Ok, thanks for the fix. There is one more place where `ecl_string_to_python` should be used – in `print_objects`:

```
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: u_symbol = EclObject('🔥')
sage: print_objects()  # crashes
```

Moreover, the docstring of `ecl_eval` should be changed into a raw string, as the examples contain backslashes.

Once that is fixed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
