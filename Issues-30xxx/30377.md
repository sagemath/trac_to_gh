Add doctests to reach 100% coverage in
- `graphs/generic_graph.py`: was 99.1% (227 of 229)
- `graphs/graph_decompositions/fast_digraph.pyx`: was 33.3% (1 of 3)
- `graphs/graph_list.py`: was 77.8% (7 of 9)
- `graphs/tutte_polynomial.py`: was 95.2% (20 of 21)

What remains:
- `graphs/graph_database.py`: 93.3% (14 of 15). The missing doctest is in method `_gen_interact_func` which uses `sagenb`. So it will certainly be removed in the future.
- `graphs/graph_generators.py`: 92.9% (13 of 14). The missing doctest is in method `__append_to_doc` used to feed global variable `__doc__` used by sphinx. Don't know how to doctest that.

Sorry, I am a bit annoyed already today.

Whose great idea was is to introduce new calls to `installed_packages` or any other of those functions in `sage/misc/packages.py` that we are desperately trying to purge to make sage more packageable? 

It may be a lesser offence in a doctest than at runtime but it is still objectionable. If Volker keeps this ticket merged in the current state, be assured there will be a follow up ticket to remove those bits.

Sorry for that.

Should I change the doctest to something like that ?

```
sage: igraph_feature().is_present()  # optional - python_igraph 
True
```
or do you have a better suggestion ?

I sincerely have no better suggestion. Playing with automagically discoverable dependency at runtime is always a bit fun. I notice some other python packages usually do a runtime detection at the beginning of the test run and then skip what is not available. sage is taking a very different approach.

And testing the runtime tester is always going to leave you in a funny position.
