```
`_triangulate_normaliz` calls `._cone_generators`, which calls `NmzResult` directly instead of going through `._nmz_result`.

This relies on the persistence of the rational and number field handlers in `PyNormaliz`, which is subject to change in future `PyNormaliz` versions.

I guess normaliz can handle this by now:

```
sage: P._nmz_result(P._normaliz_cone, "Triangulation")

This is exactly what we want.

I have changed the Normaliz code so that triangulations can be computed for arbitrary input (just pushed to GitHub/master; will be part of version 3.8.9). It is clear that this notion must be interpreted with care if the input defines an unbounded polyhedron. A corresponding remark has been added to Normaliz.pdf (p. 121 in the current version).

I am not sure whether the computation in which the triangulations come up, are genuinely inhomogeneous, or the inhomogeneity is due to the implementation of the Sage polyhedron class. As mentioned earlier, it would be really good if the Sage cone class could use Normaliz as a backend.

I would not bet that this impossible with precomputed generators. I stumbled on this problem when the last Travis run of PyNormaliz failed because the triangulation had changed relative to the reference. In the Normaliz workflow the triangulation can be computed at two places, and this place has changed with the last commit in order to make triangulations available also for unbounded polyhedra.

If the triangulation is computed together with the Ehrhart series (==> old place), then we get a different result:


```
>>> D= Cone(vertices = vert)
>>> D.Compute("EhrhartSeries", "Triangulation")
True
>>> D.Generators()
[[2, -1, -1, -2, 1], [2, -1, 0, -2, 1], [2, -1, 1, -2, 1], [2, 0, -1, -2, 1], [2, 0, 0, -2, 1], [2, 0, 1, -2, 1], [2, 1, -1, -2, 1], [2, 1, 0, -2, 1], [2, 1, 1, -2, 1]]
>>> D.Triangulation()
[[[0, 1, 3], 1], [[1, 2, 3], 1], [[2, 3, 4], 1], [[2, 4, 5], 1], [[3, 4, 6], 1], [[4, 5, 6], 1], [[5, 6, 7], 1], [[5, 7, 8], 1]]
>>> D.Generators()
[[2, -1, -1, -2, 1], [2, -1, 0, -2, 1], [2, -1, 1, -2, 1], [2, 0, -1, -2, 1], [2, 0, 0, -2, 1], [2, 0, 1, -2, 1], [2, 1, -1, -2, 1], [2, 1, 0, -2, 1], [2, 1, 1, -2, 1]]
>>>
```

In this case the order has not changed. Both results are correct --- triangulations are not uniquely determined and there is no canonical order of the generators. The next days I will try to find out what is really going on. Nevertheless I think it is really better to introduce TriangulationGenereors that are not defined before the triangulation has been computed.

Thanks. You were faster than me. I just wanted to post that I stumped upon this while trying to get a doctest for algebraic polyhedra (that finding the correct indices also works for them).

The current branch produces:

```
sage: C1 = Polyhedron(rays=[[0,0,1],[1,0,AA(2).sqrt()],[0,1,1],[1,1,1]], backend='normaliz')

  A ray in the direction (0.7071067811865475?, 0, 1),
  A ray in the direction (1, 1, 1)),
 (),
 (A vertex at (0, 0, 0),
  A ray in the direction (0, 0, 1),
  A ray in the direction (0, 1, 1)),
 (A vertex at (0, 0, 0),
  A ray in the direction (0, 0, 1),
  A ray in the direction (0.7071067811865475?, 0, 1)),

 (A vertex at (0, 0, 0),),
 (A vertex at (0, 0, 0), A ray in the direction (0.7071067811865475?, 0, 1)),
 (A vertex at (0, 0, 0), A ray in the direction (1, 1, 1))]
sage: C1.rays()

 A ray in the direction (0.7071067811865475?, 0, 1),
 A ray in the direction (1, 1, 1))
```

This is wrong (this is why I printed all the extra stuff).

Checking the indices I get: `(<0,1,3>, <0,2,3>)`.

So accidentally I stumbled upon an example myself.

But I think this is good enough as a hot fix for Sage 9.2 while we wait for the new Normaliz.

To day I have changed the master branch of Normliz as follows:

-- Generators are no longer accessible from the outside

-- they are replaced by TriangulationGenerators

-- TriangulationGeneretors are set immediately after a triangulation has been computed

It is possible to compute several triangulations successively, for example an ordinary one first and then a unimodular one. I think it is clear that one must pull the TriangulationGenerators again after the second computation.

One could go a step further by bundling the Triangulation and the TriangulationGenerators so that they are returned together. If you think this is necessary, please let me know.

PyNormaliz has not yet been updated. I think only changes in the tests are necessary.
