Currently, jsmol is installed by the jmol spkg and then symlinked into the jupyter notebook directory. 

In this ticket, we switch to https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-jsmol/ (https://github.com/fekad/jupyter-jsmol), which can be installed by standard Python tools.

Ok. I tested this on Ubuntu WSL earlier without any installation issues. If I understand #31002 correctly, the problem was occurring due to mounting Windows folders, which I'm not doing, so that's probably why I didn't run into it.

I've gone ahead and re-verified that JSmol still works in Jupyter and JupyterLab.
