Currently, jsmol is installed by the jmol spkg and then symlinked into the jupyter notebook directory. 

In this ticket, we switch to https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-jsmol/ (https://github.com/fekad/jupyter-jsmol), which can be installed by standard Python tools.

I was able to verify that JSmol still works correctly in both Jupyter and JupyterLab. However, I did notice a test failure in `src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py` due to the new deprecation warning:

```
File "src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py", line 142, in sage.repl.ipython_kernel.install.SageKernelSpec.use_local_jsmol
Failed example:
    spec.use_local_jsmol()
Expected nothing
Got:
    doctest:warning
      File "/home/joshua/sage/src/bin/sage-runtests", line 182, in <module>
        err = DC.run()
    [...]
    :
    DeprecationWarning: Symlinking jsmol is no longer necessary
    See https://trac.sagemath.org/30315 for details.
```

Also, after removing the `local/share/jsmol` folder since it is no longer needed (and wouldn't be present on a clean install), I get a couple more test failures in the same file:

```
File "src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py", line 144, in sage.repl.ipython_kernel.install.SageKernelSpec.use_local_jsmol
Failed example:
    os.path.isdir(jsmol)

    True
Got:
    False
```

and

```

Failed example:
    os.path.isfile(os.path.join(jsmol, "JSmol.min.js"))

Ok. I tested this on Ubuntu WSL earlier without any installation issues. If I understand #31002 correctly, the problem was occurring due to mounting Windows folders, which I'm not doing, so that's probably why I didn't run into it.

I've gone ahead and re-verified that JSmol still works in Jupyter and JupyterLab.
