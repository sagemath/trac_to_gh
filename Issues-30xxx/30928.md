As reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/XD1VtG0TOEk/m/Lo6L8YBGCgAJ, we have currently (Sage 9.2 and 9.3.beta1):

```
sage: f(x) = x \ 
....:        + 1                                                                                    
  File "<ipython-input-1-a5c1e14e19da>", line 1
    __tmp__=var("x"); f = symbolic_expression(x  * BackslashOperator() * ).function(x)
                                                                         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
There was no such issue with Sage 9.1 and lower.

<a id='comment:2'></a>
FWIW, in Sage 9.3.beta1, we have

```
sage: preparse(r"f(x) = x \ + 1")                                                                  
'__tmp__=var("x"); f = symbolic_expression(x  * BackslashOperator() * + Integer(1)).function(x)'
```
which is correct, while in the reported issue the second line is entirely missing after `BackslahOperator() *`, which triggers the syntax error.

Yes probably; moreover `shell.run_cell(r'f(x) = x \ + 1')` yields the same `AttributeError` in Sage 9.1, where everything is fine with backslash line continuation.

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
Note that `preparse` is called from `interpreter` and it is called twice! I don't believe it should be called twice. Furthermore `preparse` treats the input as two separate lines instead of one line separated by the `\` continuation character. This results in `\` being interpreted as the `* BackslashOperator() *`. I'm unable to test for a properly-functioning Sage.

I've pushed a potential fix.

- `preparse` removes backslash+newline combinations, putting such constructions onto the same line. This happens after `strip_string_literals` so we don't have to worry about backslash continuations inside strings, and it happens before `preparse_calculus` so that it can surround the entire thing with a `symbolic_expression` call.

- For the IPython use case, I've just squashed the list of lines into a single string and passed that to `preparse` instead of going line-by-line. The prompts should've already been removed by the `SagePromptTransformer` so I think that's a safe operation. Also, since IPython has already handled the `%` magic commands immediately prior to our `SagePreparseTransformer`, I removed the explicit check for them.

- I've done something similar for the `preparse_file` use case with the complication of supporting `load` and `attach` statements. Basically, just calls `preparse` on batches between such statements and between them and the beginning/end of file.

As predicted: not the most elegant fix, and there's a fair chance I broke another edge case somewhere in the process. I'm not sure how else to fix it without tearing up a bunch of the existing preparser code. Input most welcome! :)

Initial testing indicates that line continuation is now working. However, regardless the input after the `sage: ` prompt, that input is parsed twice. Perhaps this is a separate issue or maybe not an issue? 

Example:

```
sage: f(x) = x \ 
....:        + 1 \ 
....:        + x^2                                                                                                                                                                                   
we are now in sage.repl.interpreter.SagePreparseTransformer
result of L = line.lstrip() in sage.repl.preparse
f(x) = x \
       + 1 \
       + x^2

we are now in sage.repl.interpreter.SagePreparseTransformer
result of L = line.lstrip() in sage.repl.preparse
f(x) = x \
       + 1 \
       + x^2

sage: f(x)                                                                                                                                                                                           
we are now in sage.repl.interpreter.SagePreparseTransformer
result of L = line.lstrip() in sage.repl.preparse
f(x)

we are now in sage.repl.interpreter.SagePreparseTransformer

Replying to [strogdon](#comment%3A13):
> Same here with `Python 3.8.6`. Bug or feature?


Looks like intended behavior:

- Issue: [11714](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/11714#issuecomment-490283360) "Arrow printed twice for autocall"

- Pull request: [12456](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/12456/files#diff-c8a2543c61a63c87847b7aef4884365e6939107d66784aeb3d0c355449967469R65) "Allow to mark transformers as having side effects"

The new `has_side_effects` attribute would only work in IPython >= 7.17.0, and Sage only requires 7.13.0. Besides, the only side effects here *should* be our debugging print outs, so I vote to just let IPython do its thing.

I'll add a bit about that attribute in `SagePreparseTransformer`'s docstring for those that stumble across this in the future.

Good spotting this. I tried to search the ipython git repo bugs for this without success. I never considered that it was related to a closed issue. I have ipython-7.18.1 here on my Gentoo laptop. Your above `ipython` example, after importing `inputtransformer2` from `IPython.core` and then setting `inputtransformer2.has_side_effects = True`, does work

```
In [5]: 2 + 2
['2 + 2\n']
Out[5]: 4
```

I'm satisfied with this, but will wait to see if @egourgoulhon has any comments.

I think this is the same false positive that was identified in [comment:8](#comment%3A8):ticket:30417.

The code is still fresh in my mind, and this seems like a trivial fix, so I'm going to try to knock it out here. If it's not as trivial as I thought, though, I'll spin off a new ticket and put this back into review.

On the bright side, I *was* able to quickly add support for breaking the parameter list onto multiple lines like so:

```python
f(a,
  b,
  c,
  d) = a + b*2 + c*3 + d*4
