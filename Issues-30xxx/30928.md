As reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/XD1VtG0TOEk/m/Lo6L8YBGCgAJ, we have currently (Sage 9.2 and 9.3.beta1):

```
sage: f(x) = x \ 
....:        + 1                                                                                    
  File "<ipython-input-1-a5c1e14e19da>", line 1
    __tmp__=var("x"); f = symbolic_expression(x  * BackslashOperator() * ).function(x)
                                                                         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
There was no such issue with Sage 9.1 and lower.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

FWIW, in Sage 9.3.beta1, we have

```
sage: preparse(r"f(x) = x \ + 1")                                                                  
'__tmp__=var("x"); f = symbolic_expression(x  * BackslashOperator() * + Integer(1)).function(x)'
```
which is correct, while in the reported issue the second line is entirely missing after `BackslahOperator() *`, which triggers the syntax error.

Yes probably; moreover `shell.run_cell(r'f(x) = x \ + 1')` yields the same `AttributeError` in Sage 9.1, where everything is fine with backslash line continuation.

Note that `preparse` is called from `interpreter` and it is called twice! I don't believe it should be called twice. Furthermore `preparse` treats the input as two separate lines instead of one line separated by the `\` continuation character. This results in `\` being interpreted as the `* BackslashOperator() *`. I'm unable to test for a properly-functioning Sage.

<div id="comment:10" align="right">Comment 10</div>

I've pushed a potential fix.

- `preparse` removes backslash+newline combinations, putting such constructions onto the same line. This happens after `strip_string_literals` so we don't have to worry about backslash continuations inside strings, and it happens before `preparse_calculus` so that it can surround the entire thing with a `symbolic_expression` call.

- For the IPython use case, I've just squashed the list of lines into a single string and passed that to `preparse` instead of going line-by-line. The prompts should've already been removed by the `SagePromptTransformer` so I think that's a safe operation. Also, since IPython has already handled the `%` magic commands immediately prior to our `SagePreparseTransformer`, I removed the explicit check for them.

- I've done something similar for the `preparse_file` use case with the complication of supporting `load` and `attach` statements. Basically, just calls `preparse` on batches between such statements and between them and the beginning/end of file.

As predicted: not the most elegant fix, and there's a fair chance I broke another edge case somewhere in the process. I'm not sure how else to fix it without tearing up a bunch of the existing preparser code. Input most welcome! :)

Initial testing indicates that line continuation is now working. However, regardless the input after the `sage: ` prompt, that input is parsed twice. Perhaps this is a separate issue or maybe not an issue? 

Example:

```
sage: f(x) = x \ 
....:        + 1 \ 
....:        + x^2                                                                                                                                                                                   
we are now in sage.repl.interpreter.SagePreparseTransformer
result of L = line.lstrip() in sage.repl.preparse
f(x) = x \
       + 1 \
       + x^2

we are now in sage.repl.interpreter.SagePreparseTransformer
result of L = line.lstrip() in sage.repl.preparse
f(x) = x \
       + 1 \
       + x^2

sage: f(x)                                                                                                                                                                                           
we are now in sage.repl.interpreter.SagePreparseTransformer
result of L = line.lstrip() in sage.repl.preparse
f(x)

we are now in sage.repl.interpreter.SagePreparseTransformer

Same here with `Python 3.8.6`. Bug or feature?

Looks like intended behavior:

- Issue: [11714](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/11714#issuecomment-490283360) "Arrow printed twice for autocall"

- Pull request: [12456](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/12456/files#diff-c8a2543c61a63c87847b7aef4884365e6939107d66784aeb3d0c355449967469R65) "Allow to mark transformers as having side effects"

The new `has_side_effects` attribute would only work in IPython >= 7.17.0, and Sage only requires 7.13.0. Besides, the only side effects here *should* be our debugging print outs, so I vote to just let IPython do its thing.

I'll add a bit about that attribute in `SagePreparseTransformer`'s docstring for those that stumble across this in the future.

Good spotting this. I tried to search the ipython git repo bugs for this without success. I never considered that it was related to a closed issue. I have ipython-7.18.1 here on my Gentoo laptop. Your above `ipython` example, after importing `inputtransformer2` from `IPython.core` and then setting `inputtransformer2.has_side_effects = True`, does work

```
In [5]: 2 + 2
['2 + 2\n']
Out[5]: 4
```

I'm satisfied with this, but will wait to see if @egourgoulhon has any comments.

I think this is the same false positive that was identified in [#30417 comment:8](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30417#comment:8). Trying to ignore it with `# noqa` didn't work, so I will use [an assertion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5033727/how-do-i-get-pyflakes-to-ignore-a-statement/12121404#12121404) to silence pyflakes for good.

The code is still fresh in my mind, and this seems like a trivial fix, so I'm going to try to knock it out here. If it's not as trivial as I thought, though, I'll spin off a new ticket and put this back into review.

Not trivial. Forgot about nested parentheses/braces/brackets. A regular expression is really ill-suited to handling that, so `preparse_calculus` is going to need some work. Can use backslash continuations as a workaround for now.

On the bright side, I *was* able to quickly add support for breaking the parameter list onto multiple lines like so:

```python
f(a,
  b,
  c,
  d) = a + b*2 + c*3 + d*4
```

...and we'll see what pyflakes has to say now. :)

Yea, doesn't look like a very happy patchbot. :) Looking through it's history, I don't see a single green TestsPassed result, so I don't think it's due to anything introduced here.

You are most welcome!

I'm going to spend some time brainstorming ways to make the preparser more robust, potentially including building that proper grammar/parser I mentioned earlier. Might have to be a year-long goal for 2021, though. :)
