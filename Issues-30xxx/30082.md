Looks okay to me. If I create an empty directory `build/pkgs/sage_setup`, `bootstrap` fails as in the description. With the branch here, it works.

It does print the warning message four times, which makes me wonder if the loops should be done in the other order: first `for PKG_SCRIPTS in build/pkgs/*`, then `for SYSTEM in arch debian fedora cygwin homebrew`. As it stands, some commands are executed multiple times (the glob in the for loop, and `PKG_BASE=$(basename $PKG_SCRIPTS)` and `PKG_TYPE=$(cat $PKG_SCRIPTS/type)`), but those won't meaningfully affect the running time. With the loops interchanged, then `SYSTEM_PACKAGES=$(echo $(${STRIP_COMMENTS} build/pkgs/$SYSTEM.txt))` would get executed more times instead.

Thanks! 

I don't think it's worth changing the code so that the warning is printed less often.
