As discussed in #30216, it would be very helpful for further testing if the github actions could be activated for the sagemirror repo as well. 

Moreover, to ensure that all branches are up to date with the mirror, a git post-commit hook should be added to the git repo managed by trac, as e.g. here: â€‹https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3583061/automatically-mirror-a-git-repository.

A lot of branches on this repo are WIP, not ready to test. 

Also, GH actions consume a lot of resources, and I think these are limited per GH account/org, that means they would just clog the queue.

The default configuration for portability testing would not run on the updated branches because it is configured for running on tags only.

I think what Tobias has in mind here is to use it to run the lightweight linting actions.
