```

sage: M.identity_map().display()
Id_M: M → M
   (x, y) ↦ (x, y)
sage: M.zero_scalar_field().display()
zero: M → ℝ
   (x, y) ↦ 0
sage: v = M.vector_field(-y, x, name='v')
sage: v.display()
v = -y ∂/∂x + x ∂/∂y
sage: X.frame()
Coordinate frame (M, (∂/∂x,∂/∂y))
sage: v.wedge(X.frame()[0]).display()

That is not possible in Python, but it could be added to the Sage preparser, as has been done for the [backslash operator](https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/-/blob/13b40902a9a8c7157957cbc61ebc5e3934c331fc/src/sage/repl/preparse.py#L1836). Some people at sd109 voiced an interest in such custom unicode operators.

There is also a [decorator](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/decorators.html#sage.misc.decorators.infix_operator) that turns functions into infix operators which works similarly to the backslash operator, but, as unicode operators are not valid function names, that does not really help.

I'd like that very much, too. Is the preparser also capable of something like

type "\otimes" -> press `TAB` -> unicode character pops up

similarly to Greek letters in Py3 right now?

That is an IPython feature, which does not seem to be implemented for operators like `\otimes`. The preparser is not capable of this.

I gave it a try, by changing line 736 of `src/sage/tensor/modules/free_module_tensor.py`:

```diff

+                basis_term_txt = "\u2297".join(bases_txt)
```
and changing doctests accordingly. Everything seems OK with doctests and the html documentation.
However, generating the pdf documentation by 

```
sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules pdf
```
failed, with the error:

```
! Package inputenc Error: Unicode character ⊗ (U+2297)
(inputenc)                not set up for use with LaTeX.
```
I had to add the following line in `src/sage/docs/conf.py` (after line 407):

```
    \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2297}{\ensuremath{\otimes}}
```
to make the pdf documentation build without any error. The pdf output is fine (the tensor product operator is correctly displayed). However, before to proceed, I would like to know if this the correct way to fix the pdf doc building...

It is U+2A02 (unicode name: *n-ary circled times operator*), while U+2297 is for \u2297 (unicode name: *circled times*). In terms of readability, U+2A02 is much better than U+2297, so we should definitely use U+2A02.",

Thank you for pointing out the existence of ⨂ in `src/sage/categories/tensor.py`. It is U+2A02 (unicode name: *n-ary circled times operator*), while U+2297 is for ⊗ (unicode name: *circled times*). In terms of readability, U+2A02 is much better than U+2297, so we should definitely use U+2A02.

With U+2A02, I had to perform the following change to `src/sage/docs/conf.py` to get the pdf doc built:

```diff
-    \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2A02}{\otimes}
+    \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2A02}{\ensuremath{\otimes}}
```
The output pdf looks OK.

Yes, this is the correct way to add support for unicode characters to the pdf documentation.

My initial preference for U+2A02 came from the appearance in Sage's console in the Ubuntu terminal (font: Monospace Regular 13): 

- for U+2A02: ![](tensor_product-2A02.png)
- for U+2297: ![](tensor_product-2297.png) 

However, when cutting and pasting to gedit (font: Ubuntu Mono 13), we get:

![](tensor_product_Ubuntu_Mono_13.png)

As you said, U+2A02 appears too large. So, unless someone argues against it, I am going to revert to U+2297. It's also more natural since U+2297 is the standard symbol for tensor product as a binary operator, as your pointed out. Thanks for your advice!

Perhaps it might be a good idea to refactor the code in such a way that the symbols can be changed easily? Something like global variables such as `wedge_symbol`?

This might have the following benefits:

- Unification throughout Sage, i.e. tensor products are used not only for free modules.
- It is easier to change if we are not quite satisfied with the result at a later point.

I don't think it's worth to clutter Sage's global variables for such a thing. There aren't actually so many unicode options. For instance, for the tensor product of tensor fields, there are two of them: U+2297 and U+2A02 and the discussion in[comment:17](#comment%3A17) and[comment:18](#comment%3A18) reveals that U+2A02 is not appropriate. Moreover, it is quite easy to spot where the symbols are implemented in Sage's code: from `src/sage`,

```
git grep 'u2297'
```
yields

```
tensor/modules/free_module_tensor.py:                basis_term_txt = "\u2297".join(bases_txt)
tensor/modules/free_module_tensor.py:            result._name = format_mul_txt(self._name, '\u2297', other._name)
```
By the way, this is the reason why I used `basis_term_txt = "\u2297".join(bases_txt)` instead of `basis_term_txt = "⊗".join(bases_txt)`, which would have been equivalent in terms of output.

In any case, I would vote for the discussion about global variables to be deferred to another ticket. To minimize merge conflicts, it would be helpful to have the current ticket merged not too late.

There remains to implement `∂` for coordinate frames.

Having slept on it, I've finally included this in the current ticket ;-)  

I've put the file defining Python identifiers for Unicode characters in `src/sage/typeset` and named it `unicode_characters.py`, cf. 
https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/typeset/unicode_characters.py?id=4e13ffa05615e91d6b266660481516c72c39d25e

I've also included it in the reference manual, in the section "Programming -> Utilities -> Formatted Output -> Unicode characters".

Regarding the last point of :comment:30, there is no (automatic) articulation with `src/sage/docs/conf.py` yet.
