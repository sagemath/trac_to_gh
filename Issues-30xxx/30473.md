That is not possible in Python, but it could be added to the Sage preparser, as has been done for the [backslash operator](https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/-/blob/13b40902a9a8c7157957cbc61ebc5e3934c331fc/src/sage/repl/preparse.py#L1836).

There is also a [decorator](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/decorators.html#sage.misc.decorators.infix_operator) that turns functions into infix operators which works similarly to the backslash operator, but, as unicode operators are not valid function names, that does not really help.

type "\otimes" -> press `TAB` -> unicode character pops up

similarly to Greek letters in Py3 right now?

That is an IPython feature, which does not seem to be implemented for operators like `\otimes`. The preparser is not capable of this.

I gave it a try, by changing line 736 of `src/sage/tensor/modules/free_module_tensor.py`:

```diff
-                basis_term_txt = "*".join(bases_txt)
+                basis_term_txt = "\u2297".join(bases_txt)
```
and changing doctests accordingly. Everything seems OK with doctests and the html documentation.
However, generating the pdf documentation by 

```
sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules pdf
```
failed, with the error:

```
! Package inputenc Error: Unicode character ⊗ (U+2297)
(inputenc)                not set up for use with LaTeX.
```
I had to add the following line in `src/sage/docs/conf.py` (after line 407):

```
    \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2297}{\ensuremath{\otimes}}
```
to make the pdf documentation build without any error. The pdf output is fine (the tensor product operator is correctly displayed). However, before to proceed, I would like to know if this the correct way to fix the pdf doc building...

There is already a tensor product somewhere, with no pdf problem:

Thank you for pointing out the existence of ⨂ in `src/sage/categories/tensor.py`. It is U+2A02 (unicode name: *n-ary circled times operator*), while U+2297 is for ⊗ (unicode name: *circled times*). In terms of readability, U+2A02 is much better than U+2297, so we should definitely use U+2A02.

```diff

I am in favor of U+2297, as it is used as a binary operator. The n-ary operator would correspond to `\bigotimes` in tex instead. At least with the Dejavu Sans Mono font, the binary operator looks good to me, whereas the n-ary operator U+2A02 is too wide for a monospaced font (which could lead to misaligned unicode art).

Yes, this is the correct way to add support for unicode characters to the pdf documentation.

At least with the Dejavu Sans Mono font, the binary operator looks good to me, whereas the n-ary operator U+2A02 is too wide for a monospaced font (which could lead to misaligned unicode art).

My initial preference for U+2A02 came from the appearance in Sage's console in the Ubuntu terminal (font: Monospace Regular 13): 

- for U+2A02: ![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket30473/tensor_product-2A02.png)
- for U+2297: ![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket30473/tensor_product-2297.png) 

However, when cutting and pasting to gedit (font: Ubuntu Mono 13), we get:

![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket30473/tensor_product_Ubuntu_Mono_13.png)

As you said, U+2A02 appears too large. So, unless someone argues against it, I am going to revert to U+2297. It's also more natural since U+2297 is the standard symbol for tensor product as a binary operator, as your pointed out. Thanks for your advice!

Here is a preliminary version, which implements `⊗` and `∧`. There remains to implement `→`, `↦` and `∂` (I shall do it tomorrow).

Perhaps it might be a good idea to refactor the code in such a way that the symbols can be changed easily? Something like global variables such as `wedge_symbol`?

This might have the following benefits:

- Unification throughout Sage, i.e. tensor products are used not only for free modules.
- It is easier to change if we are not quite satisfied with the result at a later point.

I don't think it's worth to clutter Sage's global variables for such a thing. There aren't actually so many unicode options. For instance, for the tensor product of tensor fields, there are two of them: U+2297 and U+2A02 and the discussion in [comment:17](#comment:17) and [comment:18](#comment:18) reveals that U+2A02 is not appropriate. Moreover, it is quite easy to spot where the symbols are implemented in Sage's code: from `src/sage`,

```
git grep 'u2297'
```
yields

```
tensor/modules/free_module_tensor.py:                basis_term_txt = "\u2297".join(bases_txt)
tensor/modules/free_module_tensor.py:            result._name = format_mul_txt(self._name, '\u2297', other._name)
```
By the way, this is the reason why I used `basis_term_txt = "\u2297".join(bases_txt)` instead of `basis_term_txt = "⊗".join(bases_txt)`, which would have been equivalent in terms of output.

In any case, I would vote for the discussion about global variables to be deferred to another ticket. To minimize merge conflicts, it would be helpful to have the current ticket merged not too late.

I just see that all three `display` methods basically contain the same code. I think some common parts should be outsourced for example in `sage.tensor.format_utilities`.

This might also be useful in view of mixed forms, which have their own `display` method as well.

There remains to implement `∂` for coordinate frames.

Having slept on it, I've finally included this in the current ticket ;-)  

I've put the file defining Python identifiers for Unicode characters in `src/sage/typeset` and named it `unicode_characters.py`, cf. 
https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/typeset/unicode_characters.py?id=4e13ffa05615e91d6b266660481516c72c39d25e

I've also included it in the reference manual, in the section "Programming -> Utilities -> Formatted Output -> Unicode characters".

Regarding the last point of :comment:30, there is no (automatic) articulation with `src/sage/docs/conf.py` yet.

No, I don't think so. "Unicode art", in extension of "ASCII art", means to use multiline character art. Merely using non-ASCII characters does not make something unicode art.
