CC:  @egourgoulhon @tscrim @mjungmath

A `FiniteRankFreeModule` instance keeps track of all dependent modules in dictionaries `._tensor_modules`, `._exterior_powers`, `._dual_exterior_powers`.

This is done for two purposes:
- caching / unique representation of the dependent modules
- for updating all dependent modules in `FreeModuleBasis.__init__`

In this ticket, we give these two purposes two separate implementation mechanisms. 

This will make it easier to implement new dependent modules, such as tensor products of several modules.

A set `._all_modules` will now keep track of the dependent modules.
