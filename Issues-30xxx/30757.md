`fedora-33-standard`, https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1235092189

1. `configure` finds system `flint` but not system `arb` (headers are installed by the fedora package in `/usr/include/arb/`, but the arb spkg-configure expects them in `/usr/include`). 


2. Then compiling arb spkg results in: 

```
  [arb-2.16.0.p0]   /sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/arb-2.16.0.p0/src/fmpr.h:25:10: fatal error: flint/config.h: No such file or directory
  [arb-2.16.0.p0]      25 | #include "flint/config.h"
  [arb-2.16.0.p0]         |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  [arb-2.16.0.p0]   compilation terminated.
```
Indeed, `/usr/include/flint/` is present, but `config.h` is missing.

For Sage 9.3, we can do the upgrade to arb 2.18.1 (#28623) and flint  2.6.3 (#29719). But we need a quick fix for Sage 9.2.

(`fedora-33` is expected to be released 2020-10-20.)

Same error also on `homebrew-macos` with flint installed.
