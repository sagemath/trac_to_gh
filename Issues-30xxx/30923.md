These environments would just run `sudo apt-get ...` etc. to install (but not remove!) packages, for use at the user's own risk.

To test (on an Ubuntu system):

```
    tox -e local-sudo-ubuntu-bionic-standard
```
or

```
    tox -e local-sudo-standard
```

Moreover, I was wondering if one should also read the `debian-bootstrap.txt` files.

Finally, there are problems that some of the packages are not found. First, one should probably add `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa` since otherwise `libpython3.7-dev` is not found on ubuntu 20.04. Second, `texlive-generic-extra` doesn't exist on ubuntu 20.04.

Yes, I'll add bootstrap

I don't think we have `libpython3.7-dev` listed in the debian.txt files any more.

But yes, handling `IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES` needs to be done.

For deadsnakes, there's #30217. This would not be the default, but a mix-in flavor.

Sure, but it feels a bit like you are using tox for something it wasn't designed. Normally, in a tox setting, "environment" refers to a virtual python env, but for sage it is the complete system env including the os and system packages. I have the feeling a more general-purpose framework like invoke would be a better solution to manage these things.

> And I definitely do not want to add user-facing scripts to Sage that promises to install all necessary system packages.


I didn't meant it as a user-facing script, but only for developers (i.e don't ship it).

It would be nice if you could try to make it work without sudo.

Edit: Moreover, `DEBIAN_FRONTEND: noninteractive` was/is missing. And it fails with

Finally, `tox -e local-sudo-standard -- config.status` doesn't stop after contigure and continues with `make`, see https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/runs/1438029552?check_suite_focus=true
