These environments would just run `sudo apt-get ...` etc. to install (but not remove!) packages, for use at the user's own risk.

To test (on an Ubuntu system):

```
    tox -e local-sudo-ubuntu-bionic-standard
```
or

```
    tox -e local-sudo-standard
```

Moreover, I was wondering if one should also read the `debian-bootstrap.txt` files.

Finally, there are problems that some of the packages are not found. First, one should probably add `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa` since otherwise `libpython3.7-dev` is not found on ubuntu 20.04. Second, `texlive-generic-extra` doesn't exist on ubuntu 20.04.

Yes, I'll add bootstrap

I don't think we have `libpython3.7-dev` listed in the debian.txt files any more.

But yes, handling `IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES` needs to be done.

For deadsnakes, there's #30217. This would not be the default, but a mix-in flavor.

Sure, but it feels a bit like you are using tox for something it wasn't designed. Normally, in a tox setting, "environment" refers to a virtual python env, but for sage it is the complete system env including the os and system packages. I have the feeling a more general-purpose framework like invoke would be a better solution to manage these things.

> And I definitely do not want to add user-facing scripts to Sage that promises to install all necessary system packages.

I didn't meant it as a user-facing script, but only for developers (i.e don't ship it).

Is it possible to call only the system package install code via tox (i.e. don't run rest of build and tests)? 

That would be handy for #30371.

Replying to [@tobiasdiez](#comment:27):
> Is it possible to call only the system package install code via tox (i.e. don't run rest of build and tests)? 

Yes, you can pass make targets to tox, e.g., `tox -e local-sudo-standard -- configure` will only run `bootstrap`, or `tox -e local-sudo-standard -- config.status` will stop after running `./configure`

Thanks! That kind of worked. I had to install `sudo` manually, since this is not installed by default on github actions and also not necessary.
It would be nice if you could try to make it work without sudo.

```
local-sudo-standard run-test: commands[2] | bash -c 'PACKAGES=`sed "s/#.*//;" build/pkgs/$(build/bin/sage-guess-package-system)*.txt`; $(build/bin/sage-print-system-package-command $(build/bin/sage-guess-package-system) --sudo --yes --no-install-recommends install $PACKAGES) || [ "$IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES" = yes ] && echo "(ignoring errors)" '
/usr/bin/bash: sudo: command not found

ERROR: InvocationError for command /usr/bin/bash -c 'PACKAGES=`sed "s/#.*//;" build/pkgs/$(build/bin/sage-guess-package-system)*.txt`; $(build/bin/sage-print-system-package-command $(build/bin/sage-guess-package-system) --sudo --yes --no-install-recommends install $PACKAGES) || [ "$IGNORE_MISSING_SYSTEM_PACKAGES" = yes ] && echo "(ignoring errors)" ' (exited with code 1)
```

Edit: Moreover, `DEBIAN_FRONTEND: noninteractive` was/is missing. And it fails with 

```
configure: error: You cannot build Sage as root, switch to an unprivileged user.  (If building in a container, use --enable-build-as-root.)
```
Finally, `tox -e local-sudo-standard -- config.status` doesn't stop after contigure and continues with `make`, see https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/runs/1438029552?check_suite_focus=true

Since using this tox command for ci was one of the motivations but doesn't really work at the moment without extra modifications, I'll set the ticket back to needs work.
