```
The graph of a polytope used to be constructed
in the method `graph` using pairs of vertices
satisfying common inequalities of the inequalities
list, which did not work in dimension 1:

In Sage 9.0:

```
sage: polytopes.simplex(1).graph().edges()
[]
```

This has since been fixed.

This ticket adds a doctest.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Cheap ways to check whether something is fixed
in a more recent Sage version than you have:

- the [SageCell server](https://sagecell.sagemath.org)
  usually runs the last stable version of Sage
  (currently Sage 9.1)
  - [SageCell: Edges of 1-dimensional polytope](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJwtzj0OwjAMBeC9p7DUJRlIqKALOyeAC1itSSLyp9hCcHtStavfe588wgMdwbPhAhKWNwlczvN1Hka4r44YygsQptMaEmUOJWOEWuJPSqXe8SKVb9ZK3xvuUkLxpjRnd8zu2FBbyKI-1DZCaX0cdE8OjA2HVCN91aSNa1i90oa2F5T-A2YuNlw=&lang=sage&interacts=eJyLjgUAARUAuQ==)

- The main [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) instance
  has a lot of Sage versions installed, including
  the last few stable versions, and usually
  a recent enough development version.

This can help decide whether to upgrade.
