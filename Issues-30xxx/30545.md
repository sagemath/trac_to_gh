```
The graph of a polytope used to be constructed
in the method `graph` using pairs of vertices
satisfying common inequalities of the inequalities
list, which did not work in dimension 1:

In Sage 9.0:

```
sage: polytopes.simplex(1).graph().edges()
[]
```

This has since been fixed.

This ticket adds a doctest.

- the [SageCell server](https://sagecell.sagemath.org)
