indeed, looks like makeinfo is missing;

can we just add makeinfo to the list of reqs on Linux (typically, it's texinfo, at least on debian/ubuntu package)

alternatively modify spkg-install to configure without makeinfo.

These packages don't supply the scripts; they are equivalent to any system installation of gdb or valgrind.

One thing that our `python3` spkg does do is install some `.supp` files that come from the Python source distribution. Distribution packaging MIGHT install them too for use with system-packaged valgrind, but I am not sure how widespread that is.

So it could make sense to vendor python3's supp files as part of #33074.

What benefit would we get from script packages opposed to removal?

I think the scripts can go, but not before we add some docs. There are a few critical tricks one needs to know:

* Entering a sage-shell
* Passing `-i` to sage-ipython
* The use of both python's and sage's suppression files
* Setting PYTHONMALLOC=malloc in the environment
* Ensuring that your glibc has debug symbols available

The python3 suppression rules generally won't be installed, but instead of vendoring them for the zero people that currently use this, we could probably just link to the rules file in the upstream repo. This is a process that's heavy on manual intervention anyway.

Sorry, I wasn't very clear. By "maybe in addition," I was asking if there should be a new package that supplies the scripts, `valgrind-sage-support` or whatever. The point is to remove those rarely scripts from `src/bin` unless the user specifically requests them.

I don't know how any of this works. If someone uses a system Python without `.supp` files, can they use Sage-distributed `.supp` files instead? For what it's worth, homebrew doesn't seem to provide these:

```
% find /usr/local -name "*.supp" -print 
find: /usr/local/mysql-8.0.23-macos10.15-x86_64/keyring: Permission denied
find: /usr/local/mysql-8.0.23-macos10.15-x86_64/data: Permission denied
/usr/local/Cellar/glib/2.70.3/share/glib-2.0/valgrind/glib.supp
```
`find /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework -name "*.supp" -print` also returns nothing, although I don't know if that's the right place to look for `.supp` files for the default OS X Python installation.

Anyway, if it is possible to mix `.supp` files for different versions of Python, or if we can create new ones using whatever Python is being used by Sage, that could be part of the same valgrind support package.

Yeah, I know, but... do we really need to suggest installing gdb and valgrind to people? Installing them doesn't improve the normal sage experience. And anyone who's actually going to use them is aware of their existence.
