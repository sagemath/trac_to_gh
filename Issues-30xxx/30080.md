(from #30061)

We propose to add manifolds with boundary to `sage.manifolds`.

Simple examples of topological manifolds with boundary include convex polyhedra and semialgebraic sets with non-singular boundary.  These are (except in special cases) not differentiable manifolds, but only "piecewise differentiable" ("manifolds with corners").

<a id='comment:4'></a>https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.3518.pdf (Remark 2.11) has a nice overview over several inequivalent definitions of manifolds with corners.

I haven't checked the details yet but I would be interested in a definition that generalizes all polyhedra, including those with degenerate vertices such as the top of the square pyramid in R<sup>3</sup>. The main definition in this paper, 2.1(iii), does not fit the bill; it would only include simple polyhedra.


A newer article by the same author: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870816307186
on manifolds with "generalized corners" ("g-corners")

<a id='comment:5'></a>hmm, what is "the top of the square pyramid in R<sup>3</sup>" ?

Do you mean to say that you'd like a definition that includes all the non-simple polytopes, at least?

(vertices of non-convex polyhedra are a different story, much more complicated)

More complicated than modeling them locally by a polyhedral fan?

Tbh, I don't know how sensible it is to start with the most general concept of "boundary-like". Manifolds with corners seem fairly doable. The generalization by Joyce looks very interesting, though I reckon it's pretty hard to implement.
