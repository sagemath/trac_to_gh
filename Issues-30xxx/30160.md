Since #16431, `sage -ba` and `sage --ba-force` have done the same thing. Let's deprecate `sage --ba-force`. At the same time, we should correct the help message for `sage -ba`, which currently says

```
  -ba                 -- same as -b, but rebuild *all* Cython
                         code.  This could take a while, so you will be asked
                         if you want to proceed.
```
The last part is inaccurate: there is no query.
