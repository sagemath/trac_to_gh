Instead of sage's python, the installation of conway_polynomials and elliptic_curves now uses the system python. This enables one to call `make conway_polynomials` without a prior compilation of python (which is helpful for #30371). Since the installation of these packages uses python only to convert files into the right format, using the system python should be fine.

Depends on #30731

These packages declare `$(PYTHON)` as a dependency, so they are allowed to use Sage's python.

`sage-system-python` is not the correct choice here. It can be a wide range of Python versions (including 2.x), and certainly existence of the sqlite module in that python, as required in `build/pkgs/elliptic_curves/spkg-install.py`, is not guaranteed.
