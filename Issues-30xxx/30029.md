Implemented a nonexistence check based on the Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem.
Before generating a BIBD for some given parameters, we check if the theorem holds for the parameters. If it does not, then no such BIBD exists.

please mention BRC thm in the relevant docstring, with a link to Wikipedia article.

also, I think a version of BRC for lambda=1 is already used somewhere in designs code, so it would be good to unify these.

This is a so-called Legendre equation, see
https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2003-72-243/S0025-5718-02-01480-1/S0025-5718-02-01480-1.pdf
(note that it talks about rational solutions, but every solution in our case, 
x<sup>2</sup>+ay<sup>2</sup>+bz<sup>2</sup>=0 gives rise to an integer one, as we can clear denominators).

I hope John (one of the authors of this paper) can tell us  how testing that there is no rational solution can be done in Sage quickly (perhaps it would need some programming though).

<a id='comment:9'></a>
actually, this is implemented in Sage:

```
sage: C.<a,b,c> = Conic(QQ, [1, 1, -2]) #  a^2+b^2-2c^2=0
sage: C
Projective Conic Curve over Rational Field defined by a^2 + b^2 - 2*c^2
sage: C.has_rational_point(point=True)
(True, (-1 : -1 : 1))
sage: C.<a,b,c> = Conic(QQ, [1, 1, -3])
sage: C.has_rational_point(point=True)
(False, 3)
sage: v,k,l=(211,15,1)
sage: C.<x,y,z>=Conic(QQ,[1, l-k, (-1 if v%4 == 1 else 1)*l]); C
Projective Conic Curve over Rational Field defined by x^2 - 14*y^2 + z^2
sage: C.has_rational_point(point=True) # no projective plane of order 14
(False, 7)
```

here is a more fun example:

```
sage: n=15; v = 1 + (n + 2)*(n + 1)/2; k=n+2; l=2; (v,k,l) # biplane of order 15?
(137, 17, 2)
sage: C.<x,y,z>=Conic(QQ,[1, l-k, (-1 if v%4 == 1 else 1)*l]); C
Projective Conic Curve over Rational Field defined by x^2 - 15*y^2 - 2*z^2
sage: C.has_rational_point(point=True) # no
(False, 3)
```
