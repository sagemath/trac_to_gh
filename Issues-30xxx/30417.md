As of the IPython 7 upgrade #28197, preparsing multiline strings does not work anymore. The preparser alters multiline strings, even though it should not:

```
sage: """
....: abc-1-2
....: """
'\nabc-Integer(1)-Integer(2)\n'    # expected: '\nabc-1-2\n'
```

Note that this only happens in the sage shell not during doctesting. If you run this during a doctest, you get the following:

```
File "src/sage/__init__.py", line 54, in sage.isfunction
Failed example:
    '''
    abc-1-2
    '''
Expected nothing
Got:
    '\nabc-1-2\n'
```

So this is exactly what we want. #29139 has a doctest that works find during doctesting but not in real life.

I assume that is because `BackendDoctest` does not inherit from `BackendIPython`, so doctesting alone will not in general detect this kind of IPython issues.

Apparently this does the job. Looks fine to me.

We could remove an unused import, while we are touching the file anyway:

```
+src/sage/repl/interpreter.py:780:13 'line_profiler' imported but unused
```

I believe that warning is a false positive. Removing the import breaks over 80% of the doctests in `interpreter.py`. The import is surrounded by a try-catch, so I think the intent is to check that the import *could* be done without actually needing it at the moment.
