As of the IPython 7 upgrade #28197, preparsing multiline strings does not work anymore. The preparser alters multiline strings, even though it should not:

```
sage: """
....: abc-1-2
....: """
'\nabc-Integer(1)-Integer(2)\n'    # expected: '\nabc-1-2\n'
```

File "src/sage/__init__.py", line 54, in sage.isfunction
Failed example:

So this is exactly what we want. #29139 has a doctest that works find during doctesting but not in real life.

I assume that is because `BackendDoctest` does not inherit from `BackendIPython`, so doctesting alone will not in general detect this kind of IPython issues.

We could remove an unused import, while we are touching the file anyway:

I believe that warning is a false positive. Removing the import breaks over 80% of the doctests in `interpreter.py`. The import is surrounded by a try-catch, so I think the intent is to check that the import *could* be done without actually needing it at the moment.

Sorry, sorry. When I commented out the import, I forgot that in Python you need a `pass` statement in an empty block. That's what broke the doctests, not removing the import.

That said, I think my understanding of the import's intent is still correct, and thus it shouldn't be removed. Here's the full block of code for context:

```python
# Load the %lprun extension if available
try:
    import line_profiler
except ImportError:
    pass
else:
    self.extensions.append('line_profiler')
```
