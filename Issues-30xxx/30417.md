As of the IPython 7 upgrade #28197, preparsing multiline strings does not work anymore. The preparser alters multiline strings, even though it should not:

```
sage: """
....: abc-1-2
....: """
'\nabc-Integer(1)-Integer(2)\n'    # expected: '\nabc-1-2\n'
```

Note that this only happens in the sage shell not during doctesting. If you run this during a doctest, you get the following:

```
File "src/sage/__init__.py", line 54, in sage.isfunction
Failed example:
    '''

Got:

```

So this is exactly what we want. #29139 has a doctest that works find during doctesting but not in real life.

I assume that is because `BackendDoctest` does not inherit from `BackendIPython`, so doctesting alone will not in general detect this kind of IPython issues.

We could remove an unused import, while we are touching the file anyway:

I believe that warning is a false positive. Removing the import breaks over 80% of the doctests in `interpreter.py`. The import is surrounded by a try-catch, so I think the intent is to check that the import *could* be done without actually needing it at the moment.
