In `CombinatorialPolyhedron` the same very basic `DiGraph` data structure is used for three different purposes:
- edges,
- ridges,
- incidences.

We collect setting and getting of edges in two methods to reduce code duplication.

Background:

The idea is to collect edges of a graph almost without overhead.
Currently up to `16348` edges are saved in a list of length `2*16348*sizeof(size_t)`. To allow more edges (while avoiding large chunks of continuous memory), we keep the edges in a lists of lists.
