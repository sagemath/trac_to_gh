Follow-up from #30606.

As reported in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/0MnZQYItCYc/yhXDenfMAAAJ:

```
line 376, in package_systems
     proc = run('sage-guess-package-system', shell=True, capture_output=True,
text=True, check=True)
   File "/usr/lib/python3.6/subprocess.py", line 423, in run
     with Popen(*popenargs, **kwargs) as process:
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'capture_output'
Makefile:190: recipe for target 'ptestlong' failed
```

So apparently my system python3 is used which is Python 3.6.9. The option
capture_output has been introduced in python 3.7.



Blocker because this ticket fixes the broken doctest machinery on major supported platforms including `ubuntu-bionic`

`text=True` is still there, in the call to `run()`, and also not supported by Python 3.6.
Cf.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html

```
Changed in version 3.7: Added the text parameter, 
as a more understandable alias of universal_newlines. 
Added the capture_output parameter.
