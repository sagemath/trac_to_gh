We should also remove these from `src/bin/sage` (best to base on top of #29111 or wait until the next beta when it should be merged).

We no longer have SPKGs for them, but still have interfaces to them.

Our interfaces should still work if Sage finds them installed separately.

Macaulay2 and its interface certainly are maintained, not sure about Kash.

I was thinking about removing all references to packages, e.g., commands like `sage -i kash`. Probably remove the doctests in `tests/cmdline.py` about `kash`. Certainly keep the interface files, but with a change in the instructions for how to install `kash`, at least.

I wonder if we should remove `sage --kash` and `sage --M2`. Anyway, here is a first draft. I tried to deal with translations, but I probably messed some up, I did Russian only partly, and I didn't do Japanese at all.

I added a link to the kash web page (http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/kash.html), but that page says it hasn't been changed since 2008. So I'm not very confident that it will work, and the top of our file `interfaces/kash.py` says "It is not enough to just have KASH installed on your computer", whatever that means.
