<a id='comment:7'></a>While there is a bit of ambiguity, considering the output:

```
sage: f
Dual basis (e^0,e^1,e^2) on the Rank-3 free module M over the Integer Ring
```
which is saying that it is a dual basis of M, I think it is fair that `free_module` returns the base module rather than its dual. As such, I am setting this to a positive review.
