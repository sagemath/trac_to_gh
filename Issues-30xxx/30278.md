This coercion is going in the wrong direction and seems quite dangerous.

What do you mean by "this coercion is going in the wrong direction"?
It seems to me that the direction is correct. For instance, we have

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 2, name='M')
sage: T = M.tensor_module(2, 0)
sage: A = M.exterior_power(2)
sage: T.has_coerce_map_from(A)
True
sage: A.has_coerce_map_from(T)
False
```
This is correct because any element of `A` is a tensor of type (2,0) (and the identification is canonical), whereas the reverse is not true.

The coercion direction is clear from the quotient view point, but the opposite direction is also clear from the "tensor with symmetries" view point.

Precisely. That is exactly what I was going to point out as well; but you were faster. :)

There is a canonical isomorphism between anti-symmetric tensors of rank `(k,0)` and the exterior algebra.

I also vote to keep the current behavior, with the same argument you gave above.

Being canonical is a necessary condition for a coerce map, but not a sufficient one.

In #30242 (unfinished), this canonical injection from the exterior module to the tensor module is made available as the "lift" map. But it should not be a coercion.

Why not?

I cannot see any practical use for such a coercion. The current coercion, on the other hand, is needed to perform tensor calculus. This is what the whole piece of software is about.

Furthermore, removing the current coercion could corrupt many notebooks which have already been written with SageManifolds.

Could you point me to a good example where you need this coercion, and where it would not be practical to use the lift map from A to T explicitly? This would be very helpful.

There is nothing really in the doctests of sage manifolds that needs these coercions. Indeed, if I disable these coercions, almost all tests pass.

Basically, because not everything that we call "canonical" is actually canonical in a technical sense. The map from T to the quotient A is actually canonical. "The" lift map from A to T is not -- we are merely picking a preferred choice.

Where's the problem in that?

However, due to my [comment:7](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30095#comment:7) in #30095, the aforementioned map is not necessarily an isomorphism if the field characteristic is not zero. Usually it is given, but we also allow other fields/rings as base. Hence, I tend to agree with you, Matthias.

Anyway, it would be good to keep the from Eric mentioned behavior `a+T` in case of characteristic zero. Is there a compromise, we can go?

By the way: not having a doctest doesn't mean that it is not used in practice, I'd say. Imho, the documention is in general very sparse, even though the manifolds extension has a comparatively comprehensive documentation.

**Suggestion:** What about just renaming `ExtPowerFreeModule` into something like `AltContrTensorFreeModule`, and keep the coercion as it is.

In a next step, we create the class `ExtPowerFreeModule` which behaves similar to quotients of polynomial rings. Namely, applying a tensor to `ExtPowerFreeModule` (i.e. reducing w.r.t. the ideal `<x*x>`) yields an element of `AltContrTensorFreeModule`.

Just as a rough idea. This would make everyone happy and is mathematical rigorous.

**Edit:** Sorry. Wasn't such a good idea. I don't think that is what we want.

I think there should be no problem in implementing a coercion from `FreeModuleTensor` to `ExtPowerFreeModule` (given by the quotient) **and** a coercion from `ExtPowerFreeModule` to `FreeModuleTensor` (given by `1/k! α_(k,V)` in case of zero field characteristic).
