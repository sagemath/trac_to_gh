after #30740, `text=True` is still there, in the call to `run()`, and also not supported by Python 3.6.
Cf.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html

```
Changed in version 3.7: Added the text parameter, 
as a more understandable alias of universal_newlines. 
Added the capture_output parameter.

This solves the problem on my machine, `make ptestlong` passes without errors.

The python3 documentation states that "The `universal_newlines` argument is equivalent to `text` and is provided for backwards compatibility." so I do not think we can introduce any new problems here. I therefore set the ticket to postive.
