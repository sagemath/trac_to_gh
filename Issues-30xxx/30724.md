CC:  @jhpalmieri @dimpase @kiwifb

Instead, define it in `build/make/Makefile.in`.

With this ticket, the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` handling uses a new (unexported) configuration variable defined by `sage-env-config`; see also #30711.

This cleans up the sage runtime environment - one fewer environment variable.

It is also preparation for #29013.
