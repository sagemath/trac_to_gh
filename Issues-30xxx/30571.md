We remove doctests that depend on implementation of the bitsets and exchange those by tests that check that conversion back and forth works correctly.

In addition we remove the deprecation warnings from #28608 in this file. Those functions aren't meant for public use anyway and the old names were exposed for a rather short period (sage 8.9 and sage 9.0).
