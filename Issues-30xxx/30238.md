As a follow up of #16351, we integrate the class `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest` as a subclass of `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_generic` implementing the following change:

```diff
-class RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest(Parent):
+class RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest(RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_generic):
```

and consequential changes.

I was hoping this to be enough to activate few methods like `to_digraph` from the generic class that I like to use but are currently not available for the forest type. But unfortunately, the implementation of breadth first search for forest type does not yet take into account the `max_depth` argument. That will be dealt in another ticket.

<a id='comment:7'></a>I will need help to fix the above issue. Here is how to reproduce the error:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.subsets_pairwise import PairwiseCompatibleSubsets
sage: def predicate(x,y): return gcd(x,y) == 1
sage: P = PairwiseCompatibleSubsets( [4,5,6,8,9], predicate); P
An enumerated set with a forest structure
sage: import __main__; __main__.predicate = predicate
sage: TestSuite(P).run()
Failure in _test_pickling:
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: classname(=PairwiseCompatibleSubsets_with_category) does not start 
with RecursivelyEnumeratedSet but 
isinstance(self, RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_generic) returns True
------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed: _test_pickling
```

This is due to the fact that a `__reduce__` method exists in the class `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_generic` which is now used by `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest`. But the current `__reduce__` method is not able to detect properly that self is an instance of `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest` when the class is a class derivated from `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest`. Testing `classname.startswith('RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest')` just does not work if the class name is `PairwiseCompatibleSubsets_with_category` for instance.

Replacing the code based on the name of the class by `hasattr(self, 'map_reduce')` or more naturally by ` isinstance(self, RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest)` does not work because it gives a `maximum recursion depth exceeded` error:

```diff

```

I guess that code is based on `classname` to avoid that `RecursionError`. But I don't understand where the `RecursionError` comes from. Travis do you know?
