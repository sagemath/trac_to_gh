Since I’m not an active !Python/Sage user, could you clarify the “on its way out” statement? Any public discussions you could reference?

I created a simple optional package with just the requirements.txt for jupyterlab 2.2.5 and spent some time playing around with some of my pre-existing notebooks. Everything seems to work fine except for cells that use `interact`, which I suppose is why that ticket #30246 exists. 

Three.js, JSmol, rendering LaTeX using MathJax, Tachyon, 2D plots, saving plots as PNG/HTML, and tab completion work. Tried a few graphics and non-graphics examples in the console as well without issue. Documentation works as well, though I noticed that it all appears inline instead of going into a separate frame.

It seems like it's already quite usable, with the `interact` caveat. I think I'll start working in it almost exclusively in fact :) Would that be all that's needed for #26059 is that simple requirements.txt package?

Yes, that's the simplest way of creating an optional package.

That's great news already.

Apart from fixing the interacts, what is missing is certainly documentation.

And then the next question would be regarding the Sage kernel in a system JupyterLab (as opposed to jupyterlab installed into Sage's venv) - similar to what is discussed in #30124 (and #30123) for the notebook.

Ok, thank you.

I could push that small commit to #26059 for review if you'd like, but would you prefer the normal SPKG structure instead like those I added in #26919? From what I've been reading in the developer docs, standard packages can't be just pip packages, so that might save some effort later on.
