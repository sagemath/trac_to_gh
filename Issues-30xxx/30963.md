Hello Travis,

failures on darwin patchbot are due to usage of python 3.9

failures on petitbonum are because of a pexpect problem with singular #30945

Here, I have a problem with loads-dumps, because I cannot use `UniqueRepresentation`, the input (a graph) being not compatible with that. Should I make a custom `__eq__` and `__ne__` to be able to restore this doctest ?

Yes, I think that is best. In fact, the lack of equality testing might end up being a backwards incompatible change (although I do see it as being unlikely). Probably also should have a `__hash__` too...
