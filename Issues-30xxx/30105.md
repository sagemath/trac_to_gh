`sage.libs.ecl` exposes no Python function that converts a Python string to a Lisp string as an `EclObject`. 

(`python_to_ecl`, which is used by `EclObject.__init__`, handles strings by `READ`ing from them, so `EclObject("abc")` returns an interned symbol, not a string.)

We add an argument to `python_to_ecl` and `EclObject.__init__` that controls how strings are handled.

This is the opposite direction of conversion, and these functions are already used in `ecl_to_python`.
