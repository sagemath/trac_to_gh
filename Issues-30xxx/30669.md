I tried to be extra clever and messed up:

```
sage: gram = matrix([(0, 0, 0, 2), (0, -2, 0, 0), (0, 0, -2, 0), (2, 0, 0, 0)]) 
sage: L = IntegralLattice(gram)                                                 
sage: D = L.discriminant_group()                                             
sage: G = D.orthogonal_group()                                               
sage: g = G.1                                                                    
[1 1 1 1]
[0 1 0 1]
[0 0 1 1]
[0 0 0 1]
sage: g.matrix()                                                           
[1 1 1 1]
[0 1 0 1]
[0 0 1 1]
[0 0 0 1]
sage: G(g.matrix())                                                        
[1 0 0 0]
[1 1 0 0]
[1 0 1 0]
[1 1 1 1]
```
The reason for this behavior is that
the matrix can be interpreted as an isometry of `D` 
but also as an isometry of `L`.

We should only allow the first interpretation 
since it coincides with the documentation,
and the print representation.
