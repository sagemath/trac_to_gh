The following two snippets demonstrate two bugs when working with `GeneralizedReedSolomonCode`:

```
sage: F = GF(59)
sage: n, k = 40, 12
sage: C = codes.GeneralizedReedSolomonCode(F.list()[:n], k)
sage: D = codes.decoders.GRSErrorErasureDecoder(C)
sage: y = (vector(F, [0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 22, 0, 0, 38, 8, 34, 14, 33, 0, 0, 39, 0, 0, 0, 0, 17, 36, 43, 30, 10, 15, 0, 0, 21, 10, 37, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 42]),
sage:      vector(GF(2), [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]))
sage: D.decode_to_code(y)
<BOOM>
```

Decoding to message works, but produces a vector of incorrect length (should equal the dimension, i.e. 12):

```
sage: m = D.decode_to_message(y)
sage: len(m)
11
```

(The bugs were found by introducing random seeding in #29945)

The second error seems to be due to `GeneralizedReedSolomonCode` having a `decode_to_message` implemented, which incorrectly converts between polynomials and vectors. I don't see why it should have this method implemented - it should be provided in the correct way by `AbstractCode`.
