currently WARNINGs are treated as errors, and we filter out harmless ones. Since Sphinx 3.0, docbuilds are localised, and fail if locale is e.g. French, cf. 

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/7wBxNRbJaaU/hzptnsQpCQAJ

Currently we have the list of these warnings maintained in `src/sage_setup/docbuild/sphinxbuild.py`.

Setting LANG=C provides a workaround.

However, this is far from optimal. At some point sphinx had `ignore_warnings`: https://github.com/cfelder/sphinx/commit/2600eef2a5872216e0cf7341e0e48fc8ba2803df#diff-639ce3a52583644f64e3dce953a93a39 

which then got renamed to `suppress_warnings` (but still only allows to suppress a subset of warnings, it appears)

`LANG=C.UTF-8 make` succeeds.

With qualification : after this (successful) build of the documentation, `make` in an environment where `LANG` is fr_FR.utf-8 //fails//. `LANG=C.UTF-8 make` succeeds.

In other words, any use of `make` entailing an attempt to make/check the domumentation will fail if LANG amounts to french...

<a id='comment:6'></a>this should do the job, but we should have also have a long hard look at the mess of favicon and other warnings. Sphinx people [say](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/4860) that

```

[reference] WARNING: l'entrée html_static_path 'static' n'existe pas

```
is an indication of an incorrect configuraion.

There are also still some apparent leftovers of sagenb, e.g. stuff in `src/sage/ext_data/images/` - all of it added by commit `0f0517c0c90`:

```
commit 0f0517c0c90716340239eb348757449d1e36d194
Author: agc <agc@kubuntu>
Date:   Sun Dec 10 20:39:48 2006 -0800

    Added a dir "images", and put in several static images for the notebook.
```
and never touched ever since.
