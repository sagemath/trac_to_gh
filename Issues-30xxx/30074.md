```
As a follow-up from #30065,  we cache `GenericDeclaration`,
maintain the current assumptions as a dictionary instead of a list,
and rework `GenericDeclaration.assume` so it reuses maxima contexts.

The examples from #30065 become near-instantaneous.

The example from #30061, previously 32.8 s, becomes much faster:

```
sage: %time EuclideanSpace(80)
CPU times: user 1.76 s, sys: 194 ms, total: 1.95 s
Wall time: 1.63 s
80-dimensional Euclidean space E^80
```

Also `./sage -btp src/sage/symbolic/ src/sage/manifolds/ src/sage/calculus/` shows modest improvements.

Depends on #30065

I wonder a little bit if `OrderedDict` is really the best data structure. It feels like it really should be a `set`, but I guess `OrderedDict` has more guaranteed consistency across different sessions. Note that iterating over a `set` is actually faster:

```
sage: from collections import OrderedDict
sage: d = OrderedDict()
sage: for i in range(10):
....:     d[i] = None
sage: x = set(range(10))

sage: def test_iter(X):
....:     for i in X:
....:         pass
....: def test_access(X):
....:     for i in range(20):
....:         if i in X:
....:             pass

sage: %timeit test_iter(d)
1000000 loops, best of 5: 293 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_iter(x)
10000000 loops, best of 5: 173 ns per loop

sage: %timeit test_access(d)
1000000 loops, best of 5: 786 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_access(x)
1000000 loops, best of 5: 761 ns per loop
```
Although this micro-optimization probably doesn't matter too much.

Ordered because I wanted to preserve the behavior of the previous code using lists to reduce the potential for changes from the order of operations. In this untyped symbolics business, it's best to tread very carefully.

The small constant factor between `set` and `OrderDict` does not matter much, I would think.

As of Python 3.6.x, regular dicts preserve the insertion order, so in most cases `OrderedDict` is not needed anymore.

Thanks for the discussion. This is an important point.

I am using `UniqueRepresentation` here in the same way as I would use `INTERN` in Lisp. 

Note that `SR` variable names already have indefinite lifetime: `SR.var` adds them to the dictionary `SR.symbols`; even `reset()` does not remove them. 

Before this ticket, a `GenericDeclaration` is associated with a Maxima context after calling `.assume()` for the first time. The context is never killed or collected. Repeated assumptions as illustrated in the examples in #30065 lead to unbounded growth and slowdown.

In this ticket, by using `UniqueRepresentation` for `GenericDeclaration`, I manage the resource "Maxima context" explicitly; it's not just caching. Effectively I give indefinite lifetime to pairs of an `SR` variable and a declaration - this matches the indefinite lifetime of Maxima contexts that was already present. But now repeated assumptions no longer lead to growth.
