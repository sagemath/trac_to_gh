```
As a follow-up from #30065,  we cache `GenericDeclaration`,
maintain the current assumptions as a dictionary instead of a list,
and rework `GenericDeclaration.assume` so it reuses maxima contexts.

The examples from #30065 become near-instantaneous.

The example from #30061, previously 32.8 s, becomes much faster:

```
sage: %time EuclideanSpace(80)
CPU times: user 1.76 s, sys: 194 ms, total: 1.95 s
Wall time: 1.63 s
80-dimensional Euclidean space E^80
```

Also `./sage -btp src/sage/symbolic/ src/sage/manifolds/ src/sage/calculus/` shows modest improvements.

Although this micro-optimization probably doesn't matter too much.

Right, I actually would have wanted an `OrderedSet` here except that there is no such thing in the standard library. 

Ordered because I wanted to preserve the behavior of the previous code using lists to reduce the potential for changes from the order of operations. In this untyped symbolics business, it's best to tread very carefully.

The small constant factor between `set` and `OrderDict` does not matter much, I would think.

Thanks for the discussion. This is an important point.

I am using `UniqueRepresentation` here in the same way as I would use `INTERN` in Lisp. 

Note that `SR` variable names already have indefinite lifetime: `SR.var` adds them to the dictionary `SR.symbols`; even `reset()` does not remove them. 

Before this ticket, a `GenericDeclaration` is associated with a Maxima context after calling `.assume()` for the first time. The context is never killed or collected. Repeated assumptions as illustrated in the examples in #30065 lead to unbounded growth and slowdown.

In this ticket, by using `UniqueRepresentation` for `GenericDeclaration`, I manage the resource "Maxima context" explicitly; it's not just caching. Effectively I give indefinite lifetime to pairs of an `SR` variable and a declaration - this matches the indefinite lifetime of Maxima contexts that was already present. But now repeated assumptions no longer lead to growth.
