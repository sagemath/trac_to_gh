By design, spkg-install scripts should not directly touch the contents of `$SAGE_LOCAL`.  If some pre-/post-installation steps need to be taken to modify `$SAGE_LOCAL`, it should go in an `spkg-preinst` script.

I understand #30335 is a workaround, but the same workaround can still be implemented without violating this constraint.

In particular, there are numerous instances of removing bits of previous installations that can be found with

```
grep 'rm .*SAGE_LOCAL' build/pkgs/*/spkg-ins*
```
Most of these lines can probably be removed. For all packages that do DESTDIR staging, the lines would only be needed to clear out bits from ancient, pre-DESTDIR installations.
