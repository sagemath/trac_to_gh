Follow-up from #15791, #29033, #30053, the latter of which disabled use of system Python 3.6.

With Python 3.6, there is a failure building the documentation on `ubuntu-bionic-standard` (using `/usr/bin/python3.6`, https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1106251169):

```
  [dochtml]   UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 2661: ordinal not in range(128)
  [dochtml] Full log file: logs/dochtml.log
Makefile:1876: recipe for target 'doc-html' failed
```

This is coming from #30002 "force C locale in docbuild and remove some obsolete stuff", which added this:

```
build/bin/sage-site:    export LANG=C # to ensure it is possible to scrape out non-EN locale warnings
```
In the present ticket, we rework the fix in #30002 so that it works with Python 3.6 too (in which setting the "C" locale sabotages UTF-8 operation.)



Supporting Python 3.6 allows Sage to use the system Python on some older Linux distributions that are still in widespread use in scientific computing, including centos-8 and fedora-{26,27,28} (although Python 3.7.x packages are also available for these). See #29033 for more details.

For the unrelated failures in the Sphinx package installation that #29033 tried to work around, see #30008.  
(#30008 is a dependency of this ticket merely for the convenience of testing.)

Posting my branch containing few changes that need to be done in order to build doc with ubuntu 18.04 bionic and python 3.6.

The changes are not sufficient. Other similar issues arise when sphinx is running...

Two comments here:

- fixing the issues in the posted branch took a while because there are many `try - except` clauses in the doc-building which eat up all of the useful tracebacks.
- I think the remaining issues are just WARNINGS that breaks the docbuild because we decided at some point in the past to consider WARNINGS as errors (which is fine). I base this observation on some hacky modifications I did in the `src/sage_setup/docbuild/sphinxbuild.py`. To confirm this, do you know if there is a way to build sage documentation by considering warnings just as warnings?

error while formatting arguments for sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal.MPolynomialIdeal_singular_repr.complete_primary_decomposition: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc2 in position 4774: ordinal not in range(128)
```

I think the problems come from a new(ish) sphinx which is run as a backend for our custom docbuilder, and anyway the move from Python 3.6 to 3.7 was somewhat big as far as utf-8 support is concerned.

I really think that fully supporting 3.6 is hard, and we have better things to do. Python has solved this problem by moving to 3.7, let's not reinvent the wheel here.

There are 2 things I don't understand here:

- 4774 is an integer which is larger then the length of the string of the doc of `complete_primary_decomposition` method

```
sage: len(sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal.MPolynomialIdeal_singular
....: _repr.complete_primary_decomposition.__doc__)                             
3284
```

- when I look at the html documentation of that method (after building the doc while ignoring the warnings with some hacky changes in `sphinxbuild.py`), I see no problem

With the current branch with no hacky changes, I can build the documentation with the flag `--keep-going`:

```
MAKE='make -j8' make build
MAKE='make -j8' ./sage --docbuild --no-pdf-links --keep-going all html
```

I am now trying to see what is wrong with the output doc...
