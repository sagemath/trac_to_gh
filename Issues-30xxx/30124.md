We currently cannot use Python packages from the system (see #29023) - and `spkg-configure.m4` is not the right tool for changing that.

However, the situation is different for the Jupyter `notebook` package (and its dependencies): 

We do not really need to install it in our venv if a suitable version is available in the system. Rather, we should install our kernel into the system/user's jupyter installation (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/wH7_bru_Q0s/discussion).

Likewise, `rst2ipynb` is a Python package but we only provide it to make a script available, not a Python module. So again, if the system provides a suitable version, we do not need to install it in our venv.

`notebook`'s exclusive dependencies (see #26919, https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/setup.py):
- `terminado`, `prometheus_client`, `send2trash`
- `argon2-cffi` (new dependency)

Shared between `notebook` and optional package `rst2ipynb` (via `nbconvert`):
- `nbconvert`, `nbformat`, `jsonschema`, `mistune`, `entrypoints`, `bleach`, `pandocfilters`, `testpath`, `defusedxml`
- `pyrsistent` (new dependency of `jsonschema`)
- `pandoc`, `pandoc_attributes` (?)

The following dependencies are shared between `notebook` and `sagelib`/`ipython`/`ipykernel`. So we need to install them even if they are present in the system python:
- `pyzmq`, `dateutil`, `tornado`, `jupyter-client`, `jupyter-core`, `jinja2`, `pygments`, `ipython_genutils`

Packages depending on `notebook`:
- `pari_jupyter` (no system packages: https://repology.org/projects/?search=pari_jupyter&maintainer=&category=&inrepo=&notinrepo=&repos=&families=&repos_newest=&families_newest=)
- `r_jupyter` (script package; https://repology.org/project/r:irkernel/versions)
- `widgetsnbextension`

This code from `src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py` of course needs updating so that we can install the kernel outside of the Sage venv:

```

<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
That implies that we will have to ask a `jupyter` that is in the `PATH` to tell us about its installation `PATH`. 

If we just call `jupyter kernelspec install` then it will install in a user location for a system wide jupyter (`~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels` on linux), for a sage jupyter it will probably go to the sage install (`{sys.prefix}/share/jupyter/kernels` on linux/OS X). But for distro it will become problematic straight away since you install in a stage before merging in the system tree. It is possible to pass a `--prefix` but this is not the same as `DESTDIR` which would be the useful thing for distros.

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
I think we will only need the following changes to `sagelib`:
- remove the call to `sage.repl.ipython_kernel.install` from the installation steps done by sagelib's `setup.py` -- it is not compatible with modern python packaging methods anyway
- add a `console_script` that installs a kernel spec (using `sage.repl.ipython_kernel.install`), call it `sage-kernel` (interface similar to: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html)
- Change `sage-notebook` (which implements `sage -n`) to a shell script that invokes the correct jupyter (from system if installed in system, from SAGE_LOCAL if installed there)

Calling `sage-kernel` would be done by sage-the-distribution (perhaps in `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install`), and likewise by distribution packagers' scripts.
