currently we require GNU patch, version at least 2.7  (from 2009).
In particular, BSD patch does not know about `--no-backup-if-mismatch`, something that Sage used. An equivalent, and known to BSD patch as well as GNU patch, option is `--posix`.

So we could use `--posix` and change spkg-configure to accept BSD patch too.
I am not sure what's needed to be checked, besides that `--posix` is accepted. Something to learn from https://savannah.gnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=7361 ?

This will actually only find a non-POSIX patch, since the `--posix` option only exists in non-conforming implementations =)

I think `printf "" | patch --posix` might be a more reliable test of support for the `--posix` flag. And if `--posix` is not supported, we should assume that "patch" conforms, i.e.

1. Find "patch" with AC_PATH_PROG
2. Try `printf "" | ${PATCH} --posix`. If it works, set `SAGE_PATCH_ARGS="--posix"`.
3. Rename `build/bin/sage-apply-patches` with an `.in` suffix and add it to `AC_CONFIG_FILES`
4. Set `patch_args="@SAGE_PATCH_ARGS@"` in `build/bin/sage-apply-patches.in`.

That way, if `--posix` is supported, we use it. Otherwise, we assume POSIX conformance.

What's the problem with file creation?

The `--posix` docs for GNU patch mention that it will become impossible to *remove* files (you can only empty them), but don't say anything about file creation.

It may be important: if we start to accept any "patch", then we have to be prepared for one that follows the POSIX behavior. In other words, if the patches we ship only work with GNU/BSD patch, then we should probably check for one of those and not for any POSIX-compatible patch. (In that case, we can still test for the backup flag with `printf "" | patch --no-backup-if-mismatch`)

I suppose it's due to the way `patch --posix` determines the filename to patch, and gathers it's `/dev/null`, oops.
(this is what GNU `patch` does, I didn't look at what's BSD `patch` does.)

I agree, some more testing is needed.

Replying to [@mkoeppe](#comment%3A8):
> Relaxing the spkg-configure.m4 of patch sounds to me like asking for trouble. Recall the insanity that had to be worked around in #30403? 

I don't think it's so hard, it's just an executable after all.
And as a bonus we can just get rid of Sage's patch spkg, after this is done.

my primary issue with patch is that it's part of the Sage's toolchain, and as such 1st in line to be kicked out.

so far one outcome is that `--no-backup-if-mismatch` may be just dropped (this option is just cosmetic), and in fact native macOS `patch`, which is GNU patch 2.5.8, may be used just as well.

I gather that the fallback is simply not needed, just as it's not needed for `tar` (`tar` used to be a Sage spkg). 

Whether BSD patch should be allowed is another question.

Oh, and iml spkg has a patch for a non-existing file, something I found out using `--posix` option :-)
