currently we require GNU patch, version at least 2.7  (from 2009).
In particular, BSD patch does not know about `--no-backup-if-mismatch`, something that Sage used. An equivalent, and known to BSD patch as well as GNU patch, option is `--posix`.

So we could use `--posix` and change spkg-configure to accept BSD patch too.
I am not sure what's needed to be checked, besides that `--posix` is accepted. Something to learn from https://savannah.gnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=7361 ?

This will actually only find a non-POSIX patch, since the `--posix` option only exists in non-conforming implementations =)

I think `printf "" | patch --posix` might be a more reliable test of support for the `--posix` flag. And if `--posix` is not supported, we should assume that "patch" conforms, i.e.

1. Find "patch" with AC_PATH_PROG
2. Try `printf "" | ${PATCH} --posix`. If it works, set `SAGE_PATCH_ARGS="--posix"`.
3. Rename `build/bin/sage-apply-patches` with an `.in` suffix and add it to `AC_CONFIG_FILES`
4. Set `patch_args="@SAGE_PATCH_ARGS@"` in `build/bin/sage-apply-patches.in`.

That way, if `--posix` is supported, we use it. Otherwise, we assume POSIX conformance.

What's the problem with file creation?

The `--posix` docs for GNU patch mention that it will become impossible to *remove* files (you can only empty them), but don't say anything about file creation.

It may be important: if we start to accept any "patch", then we have to be prepared for one that follows the POSIX behavior. In other words, if the patches we ship only work with GNU/BSD patch, then we should probably check for one of those and not for any POSIX-compatible patch. (In that case, we can still test for the backup flag with `printf "" | patch --no-backup-if-mismatch`)

I suppose it's due to the way `patch --posix` determines the filename to patch, and gathers it's `/dev/null`, oops.
(this is what GNU `patch` does, I didn't look at what's BSD `patch` does.)

I agree, some more testing is needed.

I don't think it's so hard, it's just an executable after all.

Replying to [mkoeppe](#comment%3A14):
> comment 11 covers this.


How? I don't see why we need to keep toolchain components vendored.

so far one outcome is that `--no-backup-if-mismatch` may be just dropped (this option is just cosmetic), and in fact native macOS `patch`, which is GNU patch 2.5.8, may be used just as well.

I gather that the fallback is simply not needed, just as it's not needed for `tar` (`tar` used to be a Sage spkg). 

Whether BSD patch should be allowed is another question.

Oh, and iml spkg has a patch for a non-existing file, something I found out using `--posix` option :-)
