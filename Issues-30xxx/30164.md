There is certainly a subtle line that separates expectations for a category's parent/element methods from those for abstract base classes.

I would think that user-facing methods that expose a mathematical concept/theorem do belong to the category.

Concretely, an implementation detail certainly is how a basis is designated or represented. `FiniteRankFreeModule` uses a custom class for representing a basis and accepts symbols (strings) as designators for a basis. I agree that it would make maintenance harder if on the category level we tried to define this.

However, we can focus on the theorem that in a free module we can choose a basis and that therefore there exists a free module isomorphism with a free module with the same base ring and rank. And this is exactly what is expressed by the method `isomorphism_with_fixed_basis` -- without having to expose the concrete concept of a basis on the category level.

I would generalize the method from #30094, `isomorphism_with_fixed_basis(self, basis, codomain=None)`, so that the parameter `basis` becomes optional - and when not provided uses some basis (such as the default basis if it has been set, or like `some_elements` does, to set the default basis to something arbitrary).

The category's parent method would use the compatible signature
`isomorphism_with_fixed_basis(self, *, codomain=None)`. It would be an optional abstract method.

The maintenance aspect with categories is something that I worry a bit more about. I have gotten a lot of questions asking how the category framework works with its black magic. Most of the times I point to a concrete implementation and the key methods someone needs to implement.

Additionally, abstracting free modules will not lead to a combinatorial explosion of classes involving different combinations of axioms (which is the main reason why we have this framework). We see this with `CombinatorialFreeModule`; many implementations of different objects use that implementation for the underlying module rather than the abstraction in `ModulesWithBasis`.

The difference with `some_elements` would be that those elements are not a defining property of the set. Having a default basis sounds like a concrete implementation detail, and we don't want to impose a fixed semantic for `basis()`. This would lead to a conflict between `FiniteRankFreeModule` and anything in `ModulesWithBasis` (which would naturally be a subcategory of `FreeModules`).

This feels more like code bloat to me right now. At least, I cannot think of a definitive use-case for this over having a common ABC.

In case it did not become clear, in my proposal I do NOT define a semantic for `basis()` at all.

Could you elaborate on the maintenance aspect? This sounds to me just like a documentation problem. Would it not just suffice to add some comments to an implementation class what methods are already provided by the required category?

I have noticed that, but the problem is that we have multiple incomplete and incompatible implementations of linear algebra. `CombinatorialFreeModule` does not know about linear forms, `FiniteRankFreeModule` does not know about triangular morphisms, ...

For someone who doesn't know the code, if you look at an object `X`, how do you find the methods? The problem is that most of the classes in its MRO are dynamically created, so they don't exist as actual code. You also cannot easily point to specific points where to look.

Not all of the features should necessarily be compatible because they are designed for different purposes. Sometimes these unaoidaby require specific implementation details. That being said, there are definitely missing features that could be lifted to an ABC, which can easily handle the generality you want.

Categories are heavier objects than ABCs, which are still effective at modeling the mathematics. There are more assumptions and a bigger ecosystem to worry about. For instance, you have to make sure that you cannot have a category for `FreeModulesWithBasis` as an object in `ModulesWithBasis` is free by definition. You have to make sure there are no possible convention conflicts (cf. metric).

I feel like this method needs to handle a basis parameter. If you use a `default_basis()`, then you need a method that should be named `basis()` to create a basis. Also, something with a set `default_basis()` is in `ModulesWithBasis` essentially as the default basis is a distinguished basis. Not quite, but close. You have to also be a little more careful about what can happen when the default basis changes.

Why would you want a category over an ABC?

I think you're missing that I want the category (or, if you will, ABC) to provide the *abstract* method so that the protocol is specified, but not provide an implementation. Thus no methods `basis()` or `default_basis()` are assumed.
