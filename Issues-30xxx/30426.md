This is essentially a wrapper around pari's `idealchinese` function (https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html/General_number_fields.html#idealchinese) but I allowed arbitrary ideals rather than just primes.

This function is helpful for computing chinese remainder theorem type problems where the moduli are given by ideals in number fields.

Besides that, LGTM.
