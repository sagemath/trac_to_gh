This is essentially a wrapper around pari's `idealchinese` function (https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html/General_number_fields.html#idealchinese) but I allowed arbitrary ideals rather than just primes.

This function is helpful for computing chinese remainder theorem type problems where the moduli are given by ideals in number fields.
