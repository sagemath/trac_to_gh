Since #28012 we correctly import "collections
abstract base classes" from collections.abc.

This ticket is for the next step: unsilence the
corresponding deprecation warnings.

We postponed doing that since some of our dependencies
had not updated their imports yet.

See ticket:28012#comment:23 for the discussion.

EDIT:

but this seems to comes from **urllib3** from inside **requests**

updating **requests** seem to fix a lot of them

requests should be upgraded in #31280
