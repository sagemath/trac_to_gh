Since Three.js has recently gone completely modular, the `examples/js` folder is scheduled for deletion at the end of 2020. This creates problems for the files taken from there for use in SageMath, in particular `OrbitControls.js`.

From [#26410](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26410#comment:12) as asked by Joshua Campbell:

Out of curiosity, do we know how we're going to handle this? As I understand, modules can't be loaded from the filesystem. So...

* just drop support for running it purely locally, i.e. online=False and outside Jupyter?
* spin up a simple server the first time a Three.js plot is shown per session for the sole purpose of serving the Three.js files? Would probably want to print a warning: "Hey! This plot won't work once you exit Sage!"
* maintain our own non-module fork of the example files? I don't really have any interest in trying to keep such a fork up-to-date, even for only one file; heaven forbid the core Three.js ever goes module-only.
* something else?

After some thought, clearly the best way forward is just to build Three.js ourselves from the source code. I've already done that before when contributing a minor fix. That way we can include any features we need, either now or in the future. The only question is where to host the repository for transparency.

Please hold off on working on the upgrade to r120, since this way will save the extra work of modifying the current build process.

So, we could bundle `OrbitControls.js` and the other examples we need directly inside the three.min.js that gets generated? So just one javascript file to include on the page? That would be nice if so!

Would this repository be just for Three.js itself, or would the template's code get moved into there as well?

Also, how does this relate to #30123, the proposed `jupyter-threejs-minimal` pypi package? Is that package what we're talking about here as well?

GitHub seems to be the direction Sage is headed. I think I saw a ticket about replacing patchbot with GitHub actions, for example, and there's already a bunch of repositories under [https://github.com/sagemath](https://github.com/sagemath). Maybe we can get a repository under there, too. If not, something under your profile?

Yup, just one file with whatever we need. I've already got `OrbitControls` included in a custom build, but need to iron out some details of the process. I'm getting files much too large at the end.

I should think the template needs to stay in Sage proper, since it is critical for the viewer. Feel free to elaborate more on what you have in mind. How would moving things out of Sage simplify the development process? Simply because you wouldn't have to run `make build`?

The single file, plus the license, would indeed be the contents of the package.

GitHub of course, but the question is how easy it will be to interface with the SageMath organization.

Upon thinking it over, I retract my suggestion. But to be thorough, my idea was that threejs_template.html would remain in Sage, but it would be extremely minimal. Something like:

```text/html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name=viewport content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sagemath/threejs-viewer@r120/build/threejs-viewer.min.css"/>
</head>
<body>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sagemath/threejs-viewer@r120/build/threejs-viewer.min.js"></script>
<script>
initViewer( {
    options: SAGE_OPTIONS, 
    bounds: SAGE_BOUNDS, 
    lights: SAGE_LIGHTS, 
    ambient: SAGE_AMBIENT,
    texts: SAGE_TEXTS,
    points: SAGE_POINTS,
    lines: SAGE_LINES,
    surfaces: SAGE_SURFACES
} );
</script>
<!-- UI elements to be inserted by initViewer -->
</body>
</html>
```

It would keep the generated files smaller and maybe improve start-up time depending on how the browser caches AST/bytecode. Probably both extremely negligible, but perhaps would be noticeable with Jupyter notebooks containing a bunch of 3d plots. I've had to split such notebooks up in the past due to how long they would take to load. It may also open the door for other projects besides Sage to use the viewer as a front-end, if there's any interest in that.

But... it would mean duplication of tickets/issues for things requiring changes to both the viewer and Sage including updating the SPKG version each time, less visibility to other Sage developers, and yet one more place to have to keep up with besides Trac and sage-devel.

    "body": "<a id='comment:10'></a>\nJoshua, I'm attaching a preliminary version of the minified build to this ticket so you can experiment with it. The build depends on features recently added to r121, so we'll wait for that release before updating things here. The build requires having Node/npm installed and goes like this:\n\n* perform a shallow clone of the target branch with \n\n```\ngit clone --depth=1 --branch master --single-branch https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js.git\n```\n* add the following lines to `src/Three.js` after the other exports\n\n```\nexport { OrbitControls } from '../examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js';\nexport { Line2 } from '../examples/jsm/lines/Line2.js';\nexport { LineGeometry } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineGeometry.js';\nexport { LineMaterial } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineMaterial.js';\nexport { LineSegments2 } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineSegments2.js';\nexport { LineSegmentsGeometry } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineSegmentsGeometry.js';\n```\n* `cd three.js`\n* `npm install`\n* `npm run build`\n\nMatthias, since this requires non-Sage software and manual manipulation, I don't see how to automate it nicely. With the next upgrade we'll need to have a new `threejs-sage` repository in the SageMath organization, since we'll want the custom build to be available in online CDNs. How does one go about requesting this?",

Joshua, I'm attaching a preliminary version of the minified build to this ticket so you can experiment with it. The build depends on features recently added to r121, so we'll wait for that release before updating things here. The build requires having Node/npm installed and goes like this:

* perform a shallow clone of the target branch with 

```
git clone --depth=1 --branch master --single-branch https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js.git
```
* add the following lines to `src/Three.js` after the other exports

```
export { OrbitControls } from '../examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js';
export { Line2 } from '../examples/jsm/lines/Line2.js';
export { LineGeometry } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineGeometry.js';
export { LineMaterial } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineMaterial.js';
export { LineSegments2 } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineSegments2.js';
export { LineSegmentsGeometry } from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineSegmentsGeometry.js';
```
* `cd three.js`
* `npm install`
* `npm run build`

Matthias, since this requires non-Sage software and manual manipulation, I don't see how to automate it nicely. With the next upgrade we'll need to have a new `threejs-sage` repository in the SageMath organization, since we'll want the custom build to be available in online CDNs. How does one go about requesting this?

Attachment [three.min.js](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket30620/three.min.js) by @mkoeppe created at 2020-09-26 00:26:06

From the recipe - adding the 5 lines to `src/Three.js` - does this not just mean that you want to maintain a git branch with these lines added and merge in the new upstream releases when they become available?

The result of `npm run build` - is the idea to just publish it to npmjs.org (under a different name to indicate that it is a fork)?

Thanks Paul. I found that I had to run `npm run build-closure` in order to build `three.min.js` in addition to `three.js` and `three.module.js`. I also added a line to export `Line2`:

Yes, I think whenever source are modified, that should be tracked in a source repository.

I can create one for you in https://github.com/sagemath/ -- what should the repository be named?

If you are concerned about the size of the repository, we could create a shallow clone (omit the history of the upstream repository).

A shallow clone of the repository still ends up with a release of about 650 MB, since it includes all examples, documentation and auxiliary code. All the end user needs is a single 657 kB file. I'm not interested in shoveling excess data at users.

Here is an example of what I'm proposing, since I need it for my own use:

[https://github.com/paulmasson/threejs-with-controls](https://github.com/paulmasson/threejs-with-controls)

This release contains only what the user needs, along with the original license and instructions for performing the build. Anyone who doubts the integrity of the build can reproduce it and compare files.

I have some naive questions.

I for one only use Node when absolutely necessary, as it is in this build process, so I'm not terribly concerned with the npm ecosphere. The whole reason for building this vanilla JavaScript package is to relieve end users of having to deal with Node/npm. I don't see what would be gained by adding an option to install from npm when the zip file is already available on GitHub.

Joshua, the current build of `threejs-sage` contains the string `t.REVISION="122"` along with a string `revision:"122"`. Do these occur in your own custom builds on your machine? If so we can delete the `version` file on the next build.
