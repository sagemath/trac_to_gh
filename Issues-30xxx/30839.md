The relocate-once.py paradigm for installing Sage is annoying, inconvenient and unnecessary.  Why not get rid of it?

Currently the bash script that starts sage checks for the 
script relocate-once.py and if it is found, runs it.  The script deletes itself when it finishes.

What the relocation script does is to replace every instance of a certain  path containing a uuid by a new destination path for a long list of binary and text files.  The substitution looks like this:

SearchAndReplace(ROOT_PATH, '/var/lib/buildbot/slave/binary_pkg/build/source/SageMath/jc4b6yulaujayb9sr94ia88eourzeqip0oidmas391y', DESTINATION)

A simple comnon-sense replacement for this paradigm which would make Sage relocatable is the following.  There are
three parts.

1. For the DESTINATION use '/var/tmp/sage/jc4b6yulaujayb9sr94ia88eourzeqip0oidmas391y

2. Run the relocation script at build time, before packaging Sage, so the user doesn't have to watch the sausage being made.

3. Modify the sage bash script so that it first creates a symlink:

   /var/tmp/sage/jc4b6yulaujayb9sr94ia88eourzeqip0oidmas391y -> $SAGE_ROOT

   when it starts up, before it actually runs sage. The bash script would need to be created at build time from a template, since the command for creating the symlink contains the release uuid.

I am attaching a small patch that implements this suggestion as a proof of concept.
It works - I was able to relocate sage and have it still work.
There is one tiny issue which would need to be addressed to finish this - because of the symlink,
when you start sage it warns that the SAGE_ROOT variable is being overwritten.  Those warnings
should be suppressed, at least in the case where the known symlink is being replaced by its
canonical path.

We could add something like this as a `configure` option such as `./configure --enable-relocatable` (to set `SAGE_LOCAL` to `/var/tmp/sage-$UUID`) - then relocatability would not have to rely on https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg at all.
The UUID would be generated by `configure` and stored in a file in `$prefix/var/lib/sage/`,
and the `sage` script and also the build scripts would regenerate the symlink `$SAGE_LOCAL -> $prefix` whenever needed.

What about multiuser systems, now only a single person can use the binary? Not saying that this use case needs to be 100% supported, just needs to be discussed.

You would also need to check file ownership, otherwise it becomes trivial to trick other users into running your binaries.

Really we should be pushing users towards containers, especially since rootless containers are now possible.

It does not check whether sage is being installed in a user's home directory.  Instead, it simply asks the user whether to make sage relocatable, and warns against doing that for a multi-user installation.  (I actually like to install sage outside of my home directory, in another directory that I own, because installing it in my home directory makes find and locate difficult for me to use.)

If the user answers yes, then the symlink is used as before, but it lives in ~/.sage/locations instead of in /var/tmp/sage.  A user can have more than one sage installation (as I usually do).

If the user answers no, then the relocate-once.py script is run as it currently is, hard-wiring all of the paths to the installation directory, once and for all.

Apple's version of the rpath, which you can see with otool -L, can be made relative to the path of a bundle.  Instead of using the relocate-once.py script when installing sage you could either use the install-name-tool command after the build or you could have the clang linker install a relative path when it does the linking.\n\nIn the case of sage, I think the most natural thing to do would probably be to make sage be a Framework which is intended to be installed in ///Library/Frameworks// from a .pkg file.  If you were to do that then you could use an absolute path like ///Library/Frameworks/Sage.framework/Versions/9.2// as the install library path.

> I don't know, I was interested in the earlier iteration of this idea exactly because it would allow to avoid patching the distributed binaries - which would open a path to codesigned binaries, which is in particular relevant for macOS.


Code signing for macOS basically only makes sense for bundles - either Application bundles or Framework bundles.  Apple's version of the rpath, which you can see with otool -L, can be made relative to the path of a bundle.  Instead of using the relocate-once.py script when installing sage you could either use the install-name-tool command after the build or you could have the clang linker install a relative path when it does the linking.

In the case of sage, I think the most natural thing to do would probably be to make sage be a Framework which is intended to be installed in ///Library/Frameworks// from a .pkg file.  If you were to do that then you could use an absolute path like ///Library/Frameworks/Sage.framework/Versions/9.2// as the install library path.  The current [SageMath](SageMath) directory could be placed in the bundle as a Resources directory or as a subdirectory of one. The .pkg file could also be setup to install a symlink in /usr/local/bin pointing to the sage bash script.

Here is my attempt to summarize what we have learned here.

First, it has been demonstrated that sage can be made relocatable by having relocate-once.py substitute a path to a symlink for the runpath created by the buildbot.  All three attached patches do this successfully.  The remaining issue is to decide what the pathname of the symlink should be.  Should the filename of the symlink include the uuid associated to the build or a new uuid associated to a specific installation?  Should the symlink be in a /var/tmp directory or in a ~/.sage directory?

There were security concerns raised about using /var/tmp but those seem to have disappeared once we remembered that /var/tmp is sticky.  There may be other issues related to using /var/tmp, such as race conditions and the possibility that /var/tmp gets deleted even though it does persist through reboots.

An advantage of putting the symlink in /var/tmp and using the build uuid in the filename is that it allows the runpaths to be created when a sage release is packaged.  But a problem with this is that the first user to install that release of sage on a given system will become the owner of the symlink.  On a single user system that is not a problem.  On a multi-user system it is a problem *unless* the system administrator is the first user to install sage.

Using an installation uuid is a partial solution, since each user who installs a given sage release would have a different uuid associated to their particular installation.  But in that case it would make more sense to put the symlink in the user's $HOME/.sage directory.

Based on this, I suggest the following:
1. Distribute sage with the runpath set to /var/tmp/sage-<build uuid>.

2. If the relocate-once.py install script is run with effective uid 0, it should not change the runpath. It should just create the symlink and make it owned by root. The symlink does not need to change unless the system administrator moves sage, so race conditions are not an issue. If /var/tmp gets deleted or if sage is moved, the system administrator can fix sage by just changing or recreating the symlink, e.g. by running a relocation script provided for that purpose with the sage package.  (This could possibly be the same relocate-once.py script which is preserved by moving, not removing, itself after it runs successfully.  But it could also be written by the relocate-once.py script).  A multi-user sage should refuse to run if the /var/tmp symlink is not owned by root.

3. If the install script is not being run with effective uid 0, assume that sage is being installed for use only by the user who is running the script.  In that case, rewrite the runpaths to be a path in the user's ~/.sage directory, and update the symlink dynamically as is done in relocate3.patch.  The uuid may as well be associated to a specific installation, as is done in that patch, because the user might well be a developer who wants to have more than one installation of the same sage release.

Marc, some comments on your pull request.

1. What really needs the relocation trickery is not `SAGE_ROOT`, but rather `SAGE_LOCAL` (which defaults to `SAGE_ROOT/local` but can be configured to arbitrary paths). Let me call the symlink for that `SAGE_LOCAL_SYMLINK`. `SAGE_ROOT` itself holds very little state and can be easily "relocated" by just rerunning `./configure --prefix=SAGE_LOCAL_SYMLINK`. 

2. Because the `SAGE_LOCAL` prefix hierarchy contains all the files hardcoding `SAGE_LOCAL`, this is also where `runpath.sh` should be put, not `SAGE_ROOT`. I would suggest to use the location `SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/`.

3. In current Sage, after completing the build from source (=installation), `SAGE_LOCAL` is fully self-contained and `SAGE_ROOT` from this point of view is optional.  In particular, invoking `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` should work without having to go through the `SAGE_ROOT/sage` script.  Hence, start up logic ("This sage installation has been moved!") should be done by a script that is installed in `SAGE_LOCAL` - such as `src/bin/sage` or `src/bin/sage-env`.

RE systemd-tempfiles

For an owner of a personal computer running linux this is not an issue because
if the link is missing it will be automatically recreated the next time that sage is started.  It is also not an issue for "private" installations since the symlink is not in /var/tmp.

So this really only matters for true multi-user systems with a real administrator and multiple users who do not have administrator privileges. And in fact it only matters in the subcase when the administrator wants to install a common sage for all users instead of making each user install their own private version.  In that subcase perhaps the best solution is to just install a non-relocatable hard-wired sage as is currently being distributed.

`local` (`SAGE_LOCAL`) is the installation tree.
If you invoke `local/bin/sage` directly, then also `local/bin/sage-env` is used, not `src/bin/sage-env`.
For application deployment, it is best to ignore `SAGE_ROOT` and the `sage` script there
and to use `SAGE_LOCAL` only.  `SAGE_ROOT` is only needed for build tasks such as installing optional packages; and for source introspection.

I think you misunderstood the comments.

Nobody was assuming that systemd would be available and certainly this proposal would not depend on it.  The issue is that the relocation scheme does use a symlink that is located in /var/tmp and that link would periodically get deleted by systemd-tempfiles on those systems which do use systemd.

The only situation where recreating the link would be problematic is when the user does not have admin permissions on the system.  I was suggesting that the current non-relocatable installation would be more appropriate in that case.
