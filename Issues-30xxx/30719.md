These files:

- serve as a marker that an SPKG is a Python package (for #29013)
- may include comments that explain why we reject certain versions
- provide version constraints (lower and upper bounds)
- as such, are preparation for #29023: Meta-ticket: In a python 3 build, optionally use system Python packages
- can be used to generate other metadata such as `src/Pipfile`, `src/setup.cfg [install_requires]` (#29041) in the `bootstrap` phase, to avoid duplicating this information in various places

Yes.

Right; but sagelib also exposes cython at runtime for interactive use.

With modularization, I expect to see dozens of `setup.cfg` files for the various subset distributions. Basically, I don't want to duplicate version ranges between these.

What I want to do is define version ranges in one place for all of the Sage project.

Distinguishing the kinds of dependencies (build, test, ...) should be orthogonal -- and the mechanism in #29041 should be able to put these version ranges into whatever file/format is needed. 

(I don't think it would add sufficient value to Sage to have different version ranges for a given package in different roles, like "we need Cython >= 0.29.21 for build, but any Cython >= 0.27 is fine for runtime.)

I don't like to go into this direction because it would add a big hurdle to our developer community. Having one git repository is key.

Sounds like a valid point.


> Having one git repository is key. 


I agree! What I meant is that it might be helpful to approach it like this, i.e. how would you solve this problem if sage-library would be sitting in a different git repo? I think, this will be helpful e.g for distribution as pipy-installable package where it would be helpful if `src/` works independently of the `make` and `build` scripts. 


One more remark: I would try to make the version range specifications as general as possible, i.e. only add restrictions if its known that that this particular version doesn't work with sage (this in particular applies to the upper limit). Otherwise the sage-library (and its subdistributions) would be harder to use (e.g. if one cannot upgrade/downgrade a dependency because other code relies on it). In this context, it may actually turn out to be helpful if you could could control the dependency versions for each submodule sepereatly, e.g. if ModuleA breaks with a newer version but ModuleB doesn't have these problems.
