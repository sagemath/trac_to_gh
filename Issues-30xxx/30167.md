Currently, one cannot use a relabeled Coxeter group with `implementation=coxeter3`. e.g., this fails:

```python
ctype = CartanType(['B', 3]).relabel({1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1})
W = CoxeterGroup(ctype, implementation='coxeter3')
```

and even if it didn't fail, the relabelling would not be respected.
This addition allows a coxeter3-implemented group to initialize successfully and respect the relabelling if one is present.

New (passing) tests have been added, and all tests in src/sage/libs/coxeter3 pass.

**Keywords:** coxeter, coxeter3, relabel, CoxeterGroup

This will now allow twisted affine types as being valid input, which I am not sure we want.

These changes also need to be done:

In the course of working with coxeter3 groups, I've discovered a few other minor bugs that come from discrepancies in the indexing of the CoxeterMatrix, that prevent coxeter3-implemented Coxeter groups from being used in certain contexts. I'll see about cleaning those up in another ticket.

Thanks for the comments!
