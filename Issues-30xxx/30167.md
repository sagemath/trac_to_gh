```
Currently, one cannot use a relabeled Coxeter group with `implementation=coxeter3`. e.g., this fails:

```python
ctype = CartanType(['B', 3]).relabel({1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1})
W = CoxeterGroup(ctype, implementation='coxeter3')
```

and even if it didn't fail, the relabelling would not be respected.
This addition allows a coxeter3-implemented group to initialize successfully and respect the relabelling if one is present.

New (passing) tests have been added, and all tests in src/sage/libs/coxeter3 pass.

**Keywords:** coxeter, coxeter3, relabel, CoxeterGroup

This will now allow twisted affine types as being valid input, which I am not sure we want.

These changes also need to be done:

and

```diff

             Coxeter group of type ['B', 3] relabelled by {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1} implemented by Coxeter3
```

Other than those things, this looks good.

In the course of working with coxeter3 groups, I've discovered a few other minor bugs that come from discrepancies in the indexing of the CoxeterMatrix, that prevent coxeter3-implemented Coxeter groups from being used in certain contexts. I'll see about cleaning those up in another ticket.

Thanks for the comments!

You are still missing one of the doctests to mark as `# optional`. Also there should not be a bare `except:`; instead use `except AttributeError:`. Also, we follow the Python convention for error messages:

```diff
-raise NotImplementedError('Twisted affine groups are not supported in coxeter3.')
+raise NotImplementedError('twisted affine groups are not supported in coxeter3')
```
Although in some ways twisted types only make sense for root systems and Lie algebras...but a `NotImplementedError` is (still) reasonable here.
