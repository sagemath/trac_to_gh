The purpose of the enhancement is to enumerate and manipulate the fully commutative (FC) elements in a Coxeter group. In particular, it accomplishes the goal of determining if a group element is FC set in Ticket: 25964. 

The enhancement resides in one new file `src/sage/combinat/fully_commutative_elements.py`, with examples and tests included for every class and method. All other changes in this ticket concern only meta information such as bibliography references and documentation.

The file `src/sage/combinat/fully_commutative_elements.py` follows the standard parent-element pattern in Sage and contains two classes `FullyCommutativeElements` and `FullyCommutativeElement`, both introduced into the global namespace. Instances of `FullyCommutativeElements` are implemented in the category of enumerated sets and refined to either finite or infinite enumerated sets for groups associated to Cartan types. Each instance of `FullyCommutativeElement` is realized as a `NormalizedClonableList` via the *Cartier--Foata canonical form* of FC elements. 

Basic usage for enumeration of FC elements in a Coxeter group. 

```python
sage: FCA3 = FullyCommutativeElements(['A', 3]); FCA3
Fully commutative elements in Coxeter system with Cartan type ['A', 3]
sage: FCA3.category()
Category of finite enumerated sets
sage: FCA3.list()
[[],
 [1],
 [2],
 [3],
 [2, 1],
 [1, 3],
 [1, 2],
 [3, 2],
 [2, 3],
 [3, 2, 1],
 [2, 1, 3],
 [1, 3, 2],
 [1, 2, 3],
 [2, 1, 3, 2]]

sage: FCAffineA2 = FullyCommutativeElements(['A', 2, 1])
sage: FCAffineA2.category()
Category of infinite enumerated sets
sage: list(FCAffineA2.iterate_to_length(4))
[[], [0], [1], [2], [1, 0], [2, 0], [0, 1], [2, 1], [0, 2], [1,2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 1, 0], [0, 1, 2, 0], [1, 2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2, 1], [2, 1,0, 2], [2, 0, 1, 2]]
```

```python
sage: FCB8 = FullyCommutativeElements(['B', 8])
sage: len(FCB8)    # long time (7 seconds)
14299
```

Elements are verified to be FC upon construction, and FC element are normalized to Cartier--Foata canonical form:

```python
sage: FCA3([1,2,1])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: The input is not a reduced word of a fully commutative element.

sage: FCA3([2, 3, 1, 2])
[2, 1, 3, 2]
```

In addition to the construction and enumeration of FC elements in a Coxeter group, various methods are developed for each FC element, including tools for studying the *heap* posets of FC elements and for computing Kazhdan and Lusztig's (generalized) star operations on FC elements. For more details, please see the attached documentation page built by Sage.

+This enhancement introduces a new class whose purpose is to enumerate and manipulate the fully commutative elements in a Coxeter system.
 
+The implementation follows the standard parent-element pattern in Sage, with `FullyCommutativeElements` being introduced into the global namespace, and its element class `FullyCommutativeElement`, which is a `NormalizedClonableList` and represents a normalized (i.e., in Cartier--Foata normal form) reduced word of a fully commutative element.

The test for an element of a Coxeter group to be fully commutative should also be available for the elements of a Coxeter group (probably in the category of `CoxeterGroups`).

`FullyCommutativeElements` should also be a `UniqueRepresentation`. So you will also need to implement

```python
@staticmethod
    def __classcall_private__(cls, data):
        if isinstance(data, CoxeterMatrix):
            matrix = data
        else:
            try:
                t = CartanType(data)
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                raise ValueError('input must be a CoxeterMatrix or data describing a Cartan/Coxeter type')
            matrix = t.coxeter_matrix()
        return super(cls, FullyCommutativeElements).__classcall__(cls, matrix)

    def __init__(self, matrix):
        self._matrix = matrix
        # Rest of the initialization
```
I would also avoid the big `try-except` block in the `__init__` to handle more cases more explicitly. (This will make it easier to maintain the code later on.) I think you should also see if the data can be passed to a `CoxeterType`, possibly first before `CartanType`.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:14'></a>\nI like the idea of exposing everything as `CoxeterGroup.fully_commutative_elements()`. And implementing UniqueRepresentation should be fine as well. I'll get this done shortly.\n\nThe reason we differentiated the element class from the elements of a `CoxeterGroup` in the first place is that we're treating all of our operations and manipulations on elements as pure combinatorics on reduced words; depending on the implementation, calling `.(from_)reduced_word()` all the time can be quite expensive. Furthermore, we *replace* methods on `CoxeterGroup` elements such as `has_descent` and co. to provide specialized criterion that work on fully commutative reduced words, and add various other methods as well. This is why we ended up inventing a lightweight element class that simply represents \"a canonical reduced word of a fully commutative element\". \n\nI agree it might be nice to be able to go seamlessly to an element of the ambient `CoxeterGroup` (if we're going to initialize with a `CoxeterGroup` as the \"core data\" instead of a matrix, which I like), but perhaps we could just have something like `.element()` that forgets the full commutivity and gives you a regular element of the `CoxeterGroup`?",

I like the idea of exposing everything as `CoxeterGroup.fully_commutative_elements()`. And implementing UniqueRepresentation should be fine as well. I'll get this done shortly.

The reason we differentiated the element class from the elements of a `CoxeterGroup` in the first place is that we're treating all of our operations and manipulations on elements as pure combinatorics on reduced words; depending on the implementation, calling `.(from_)reduced_word()` all the time can be quite expensive. Furthermore, we *replace* methods on `CoxeterGroup` elements such as `has_descent` and co. to provide specialized criterion that work on fully commutative reduced words, and add various other methods as well. This is why we ended up inventing a lightweight element class that simply represents "a canonical reduced word of a fully commutative element". 

I agree it might be nice to be able to go seamlessly to an element of the ambient `CoxeterGroup` (if we're going to initialize with a `CoxeterGroup` as the "core data" instead of a matrix, which I like), but perhaps we could just have something like `.element()` that forgets the full commutivity and gives you a regular element of the `CoxeterGroup`?

Sorry for the delay in responding; last week was super busy for me.

Hmm.. I that is a fair point with wanting to abstract away the group and just consider reduced words themselves. I like this current implementation that takes the best of both words: the abstraction and the link with a specific implementation of the group.

This is better in terms of the internal structure:

```diff
-class FullyCommutativeElements(Parent, UniqueRepresentation):
+class FullyCommutativeElements(UniqueRepresentation, Parent):
```

This check is not correct:

```python
if not ctype.is_affine() or (family == 'F' and rank == 5) or (family == 'E' and rank == 9):
```
This says an indefinite type will have finitely many FC elements. This does not seem to match what is in the comment. I also don't like relying on `is_affine()` failing to check for indefinite type. That feels fragile.

The `__iter__` can be simplified a bit:

```diff
         # To make the iterator deterministic, use a dictionary rather than a
         # set, for the keys are then ordered by default by Python 3.7+:
         recent_words = {empty_word: True}
         yield empty_word
-        length = 1
-        while True:
+        while recent_words:
             new_words = {}
-            for w in recent_words.keys():
+            for w in recent_words:
                 for s in letters:
                     if w.still_reduced_fc_after_prepending(s):
                         sw = self.element_class(
                             self, [s] + list(w), check=False)
                         # "Add" sw to the "set"
                         new_words[sw] = True
-            if len(new_words) == 0:
                 return
-            for w in new_words.keys():
+            for w in new_words:
                 yield w
             recent_words = new_words
-            length += 1
```
It might also be good to say in the docstring that it iterates by increasing length.

In `iterate_to_length`, I would remove the `assert length >= 0` since it doesn't match your docstring. Also

```diff
         INPUT:
 
-        - ``length`` -- integer; maximum length of element to generate.
+        - ``length`` -- integer; maximum length of element to generate
```

The `.. PLOT::` is causing the docbuild to fail. I think you need to do this

```diff
         .. PLOT::
+            :width: 400 px
 
-            FC = FullyCommutativeElements(['B', 5])
+            FC = CoxeterGroup(['B', 5]).fully_commutative_elements()
             g = FC([3,2,4,3,1]).plot_heap()
             sphinx_plot(g)
```

An indefinite type is something that is not finite nor affine.

However, there are still issues with reducible types:

```
sage: CT = CoxeterType('F4xA2')
sage: CT.is_finite()
True
sage: CT.type()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
```
An `is_reducible` method is missing from `CoxeterType` as well, but the output of `type()` will be `'reducible'`.

You also forgot to fix the copyright statement.

Also, one docstring fix:

```diff
         def fully_commutative_elements(self):
             r"""
-            Return the combinatorial class of fully commutative elements in this
-            Coxeter group. See
-            :class:`~sage.combinat.fully_commutative_elements.FullyCommutativeElements`
-            for details.
+            Return the set of fully commutative elements in this Coxeter group.
+

    "body": "<a id='comment:29'></a>\nI don't see why you cannot handle reducible types. I believe the FC elements in a reducible type is just the product of each of the FC elements in each irreducible component. So a reducible type is finite if and only if all of its irreducible components are finite. So how I would do it would be like this:\n\n```python\nis_finite = True\nif ctype.is_reducible():\n    ctype = ctype.component_types()\nelse:\n    ctype = [ctype]\nfor ct in ctype:\n    if not is_a_finite_FC_type(ct):\n        is_finite = False\n        break\nif is_finite:\n    category = category.Finite()\nelse:\n    category = category.Infinite()\n```\nYou would need to add a few more little features to `CoxeterType` that I should have already added (but didn't think about as I didn't need it for my application at that time). However, they are all basically just redirects.",

I don't see why you cannot handle reducible types. I believe the FC elements in a reducible type is just the product of each of the FC elements in each irreducible component. So a reducible type is finite if and only if all of its irreducible components are finite. So how I would do it would be like this:

```python
is_finite = True
if ctype.is_reducible():
    ctype = ctype.component_types()
else:
    ctype = [ctype]
for ct in ctype:
    if not is_a_finite_FC_type(ct):
        is_finite = False
        break
if is_finite:
    category = category.Finite()
else:
    category = category.Infinite()
```
You would need to add a few more little features to `CoxeterType` that I should have already added (but didn't think about as I didn't need it for my application at that time). However, they are all basically just redirects.

Thank you. The finite detection looks great now. We are almost there.

I would just simply have `normalize = cartier_foata_form` rather than an explicit redirect. This becomes moot, but why is `normalize` even returning something when the `cartier_foata_form` returns nothing? Likewise moot, but you don't need to explicitly state the redirects.

I would hide `still_reduced_fc_after_prepending` by renaming it `_still_reduced_fc_after_prepending` as the user doesn't really need that method.

Instead of `\mathbb{N}`, you can use `\NN`, which is better for standardization within Sage. (This applies to anything similar, such at `\ZZ` and `\QQ`.)

Remove `OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:`; just include them in the `INPUT:` block. Also, input items should not end with a period/full-stop. Additionally, please format as ```'left'```.

You probably want this:

```diff
             (3) `t` is left descent of the word `u_3`  obtained by
             removing the leftmost `s` from `u_2`;
+
             ...
+
             (m-1) the appropriate element in `\{s, t\}` is a left descent
             of the word `u_{m-1}` obtained by removing the leftmost letter
             required to be a descent in Condition (m-2) from `u_{m-2}`.
```

I think this is much more understandable on 1 line (and therefore worth breaking the 80 char/line guideline):

```diff
-            new_string = [other] + \
-                cur_string if side == 'left' else cur_string + [other]
+            new_string = [other] + cur_string if side == 'left' else cur_string + [other]
```

In the `FullyCommutativeElements.__init__`, I would make the doctests:

```python
    def __init__(self, coxeter_group):
        r"""
        Initialize ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: from sage.combinat.fully_commutative_elements import FullyCommutativeElements
            sage: FC = FullyCommutativeElements(CoxeterGroup(['H', 4]))
            sage: TestSuite(FC).run()
        """
```

```
#diff
             sage: list(FCAffineA2.iterate_to_length(4))
-            [[], [0], [1], [2], [1, 0], [2, 0], [0, 1], [2, 1], [0, 2], [1,
-            2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2], [0, 1,

-            0, 2], [2, 0, 1, 2]]

Alright, I believe I've addressed all your concerns. I did take care to fix other instances that were similar to the cases you pointed out when possible, and verified the docs build and look OK.

Per the first suggestion, I eliminated `cartier_foata_form` and simply kept `normalize`; I think we were concerned that "normalize" isn't very descriptive, but given that the docstring says exactly how we are normalizing, I don't think it's a problem.

Thank you. Last tidbits:

The docstring of `normalize` is not correct because you are not returning anything. I would say

```
Mutate ``self`` into Cartier-Foata normal form.
```
(the single hyphen is because this doesn't convert it to latex, sadly).

I missed this when reading the docstring, but in `coset_decomposition`, I would change `l` to `\ell` so there is no possible confusion with `1` or `I` (plus IMO, the latex version is prettier).
