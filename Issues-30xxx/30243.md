The purpose of the enhancement is to enumerate and manipulate the fully commutative (FC) elements in a Coxeter group. In particular, it accomplishes the goal of determining if a group element is FC set in Ticket: 25964. 

The enhancement resides in one new file `src/sage/combinat/fully_commutative_elements.py`, with examples and tests included for every class and method. All other changes in this ticket concern only meta information such as bibliography references and documentation.

The file `src/sage/combinat/fully_commutative_elements.py` follows the standard parent-element pattern in Sage and contains two classes `FullyCommutativeElements` and `FullyCommutativeElement`, both introduced into the global namespace. Instances of `FullyCommutativeElements` are implemented in the category of enumerated sets and refined to either finite or infinite enumerated sets for groups associated to Cartan types. Each instance of `FullyCommutativeElement` is realized as a `NormalizedClonableList` via the *Cartier--Foata canonical form* of FC elements. 

Basic usage for enumeration of FC elements in a Coxeter group. 

```python
sage: FCA3 = FullyCommutativeElements(['A', 3]); FCA3
Fully commutative elements in Coxeter system with Cartan type ['A', 3]
sage: FCA3.category()
Category of finite enumerated sets
sage: FCA3.list()
[[],
 [1],
 [2],
 [3],
 [2, 1],
 [1, 3],
 [1, 2],
 [3, 2],
 [2, 3],
 [3, 2, 1],
 [2, 1, 3],
 [1, 3, 2],
 [1, 2, 3],
 [2, 1, 3, 2]]

sage: FCAffineA2 = FullyCommutativeElements(['A', 2, 1])
sage: FCAffineA2.category()
Category of infinite enumerated sets
sage: list(FCAffineA2.iterate_to_length(4))
[[], [0], [1], [2], [1, 0], [2, 0], [0, 1], [2, 1], [0, 2], [1,2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 1, 0], [0, 1, 2, 0], [1, 2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2, 1], [2, 1,0, 2], [2, 0, 1, 2]]
```

```python
sage: FCB8 = FullyCommutativeElements(['B', 8])
sage: len(FCB8)    # long time (7 seconds)
14299
```

Elements are verified to be FC upon construction, and FC element are normalized to Cartier--Foata canonical form:

```python
sage: FCA3([1,2,1])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: The input is not a reduced word of a fully commutative element.

sage: FCA3([2, 3, 1, 2])
[2, 1, 3, 2]
```

In addition to the construction and enumeration of FC elements in a Coxeter group, various methods are developed for each FC element, including tools for studying the *heap* posets of FC elements and for computing Kazhdan and Lusztig's (generalized) star operations on FC elements. For more details, please see the attached documentation page built by Sage.

The test for an element of a Coxeter group to be fully commutative should also be available for the elements of a Coxeter group (probably in the category of `CoxeterGroups`).

`FullyCommutativeElements` should also be a `UniqueRepresentation`. So you will also need to implement

```python
@staticmethod
    def __classcall_private__(cls, data):
        if isinstance(data, CoxeterMatrix):
            matrix = data
        else:
            try:
                t = CartanType(data)
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                raise ValueError('input must be a CoxeterMatrix or data describing a Cartan/Coxeter type')
            matrix = t.coxeter_matrix()
        return super(cls, FullyCommutativeElements).__classcall__(cls, matrix)

    def __init__(self, matrix):
        self._matrix = matrix
        # Rest of the initialization
```
I would also avoid the big `try-except` block in the `__init__` to handle more cases more explicitly. (This will make it easier to maintain the code later on.) I think you should also see if the data can be passed to a `CoxeterType`, possibly first before `CartanType`.

I'll get this done shortly.\n\nThe reason we differentiated the element class from the elements of a `CoxeterGroup` in the first place is that we're treating all of our operations and manipulations on elements as pure combinatorics on reduced words; depending on the implementation, calling `.(from_)reduced_word()` all the time can be quite expensive. Furthermore, we *replace* methods on `CoxeterGroup` elements such as `has_descent` and co. to provide specialized criterion that work on fully commutative reduced words, and add various other methods as well. This is why we ended up inventing a lightweight element class that simply represents \"a canonical reduced word of a fully commutative element\". \n\nI agree it might be nice to be able to go seamlessly to an element of the ambient `CoxeterGroup` (if we're going to initialize with a `CoxeterGroup` as the \"core data\" instead of a matrix, which I like), but perhaps we could just have something like `.element()` that forgets the full commutivity and gives you a regular element of the `CoxeterGroup`?",

The reason we differentiated the element class from the elements of a `CoxeterGroup` in the first place is that we're treating all of our operations and manipulations on elements as pure combinatorics on reduced words; depending on the implementation, calling `.(from_)reduced_word()` all the time can be quite expensive. Furthermore, we *replace* methods on `CoxeterGroup` elements such as `has_descent` and co. to provide specialized criterion that work on fully commutative reduced words, and add various other methods as well. This is why we ended up inventing a lightweight element class that simply represents "a canonical reduced word of a fully commutative element". 

I agree it might be nice to be able to go seamlessly to an element of the ambient `CoxeterGroup` (if we're going to initialize with a `CoxeterGroup` as the "core data" instead of a matrix, which I like), but perhaps we could just have something like `.element()` that forgets the full commutivity and gives you a regular element of the `CoxeterGroup`?

Sorry for the delay in responding; last week was super busy for me.

Hmm.. I that is a fair point with wanting to abstract away the group and just consider reduced words themselves. I like this current implementation that takes the best of both words: the abstraction and the link with a specific implementation of the group.

Some additional changes:

Minor point, but can you use the standard copyright for Sage:

```
# This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
# it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
# the Free Software Foundation, either version 2 of the License, or
# (at your option) any later version.

# ****************************************************************************
```

This is better in terms of the internal structure:

```diff
-class FullyCommutativeElements(Parent, UniqueRepresentation):
+class FullyCommutativeElements(UniqueRepresentation, Parent):
```

This check is not correct:

```python
if not ctype.is_affine() or (family == 'F' and rank == 5) or (family == 'E' and rank == 9):
```
This says an indefinite type will have finitely many FC elements. This does not seem to match what is in the comment. I also don't like relying on `is_affine()` failing to check for indefinite type. That feels fragile.

The `__iter__` can be simplified a bit:

```diff
         # To make the iterator deterministic, use a dictionary rather than a
         # set, for the keys are then ordered by default by Python 3.7+:
         recent_words = {empty_word: True}
         yield empty_word

             new_words = {}
-            for w in recent_words.keys():
+            for w in recent_words:
                 for s in letters:

                         sw = self.element_class(
                             self, [s] + list(w), check=False)
                         # "Add" sw to the "set"
                         new_words[sw] = True
-            if len(new_words) == 0:
                 return
-            for w in new_words.keys():
+            for w in new_words:
                 yield w
             recent_words = new_words
-            length += 1
```
It might also be good to say in the docstring that it iterates by increasing length.

In `iterate_to_length`, I would remove the `assert length >= 0` since it doesn't match your docstring. Also

```diff
         INPUT:
 
-        - ``length`` -- integer; maximum length of element to generate.
+        - ``length`` -- integer; maximum length of element to generate
```

The `.. PLOT::` is causing the docbuild to fail. I think you need to do this

```diff
         .. PLOT::
+            :width: 400 px
 
-            FC = FullyCommutativeElements(['B', 5])
+            FC = CoxeterGroup(['B', 5]).fully_commutative_elements()
             g = FC([3,2,4,3,1]).plot_heap()
             sphinx_plot(g)
```

<a id='comment:25'></a>
An indefinite type is something that is not finite nor affine.

However, there are still issues with reducible types:

```
sage: CT = CoxeterType('F4xA2')
sage: CT.is_finite()
True
sage: CT.type()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
```
An `is_reducible` method is missing from `CoxeterType` as well, but the output of `type()` will be `'reducible'`.

You also forgot to fix the copyright statement.

Also, one docstring fix:

```diff
         def fully_commutative_elements(self):
             r"""
-            Return the combinatorial class of fully commutative elements in this
-            Coxeter group. See
-            :class:`~sage.combinat.fully_commutative_elements.FullyCommutativeElements`
-            for details.
+            Return the set of fully commutative elements in this Coxeter group.
+
+            .. SEEALSO::
+
+                :class:`~sage.combinat.fully_commutative_elements.FullyCommutativeElements`

I don't see why you cannot handle reducible types. I believe the FC elements in a reducible type is just the product of each of the FC elements in each irreducible component. So a reducible type is finite if and only if all of its irreducible components are finite. So how I would do it would be like this:

```python
is_finite = True
if ctype.is_reducible():
    ctype = ctype.component_types()
else:
    ctype = [ctype]
for ct in ctype:
    if not is_a_finite_FC_type(ct):
        is_finite = False
        break
if is_finite:
    category = category.Finite()
else:
    category = category.Infinite()
```
You would need to add a few more little features to `CoxeterType` that I should have already added (but didn't think about as I didn't need it for my application at that time). However, they are all basically just redirects.

Thank you, it is looking a lot better. Now one last bit is you can simplify the checking for the infinite case by making it a positive statement:

```python
if (not ctype.is_finite() and
    not ((family == 'F' and rank == 5) or (family == 'E' and rank == 9))):
    is_finite = False
    break
```
IMO, this makes the code easier to read.

Thank you. The finite detection looks great now. We are almost there.

I would just simply have `normalize = cartier_foata_form` rather than an explicit redirect. This becomes moot, but why is `normalize` even returning something when the `cartier_foata_form` returns nothing? Likewise moot, but you don't need to explicitly state the redirects.

I would hide `still_reduced_fc_after_prepending` by renaming it `_still_reduced_fc_after_prepending` as the user doesn't really need that method.

Instead of `\mathbb{N}`, you can use `\NN`, which is better for standardization within Sage. (This applies to anything similar, such at `\ZZ` and `\QQ`.)

Remove `OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:`; just include them in the `INPUT:` block. Also, input items should not end with a period/full-stop. Additionally, please format as <code>``'left'``</code>.

You probably want this:

```diff
             (3) `t` is left descent of the word `u_3`  obtained by
             removing the leftmost `s` from `u_2`;
+
             ...
+
             (m-1) the appropriate element in `\{s, t\}` is a left descent
             of the word `u_{m-1}` obtained by removing the leftmost letter
             required to be a descent in Condition (m-2) from `u_{m-2}`.
```

I think this is much more understandable on 1 line (and therefore worth breaking the 80 char/line guideline):

```diff
-            new_string = [other] + \
-                cur_string if side == 'left' else cur_string + [other]
+            new_string = [other] + cur_string if side == 'left' else cur_string + [other]
```

In the `FullyCommutativeElements.__init__`, I would make the doctests:

```python
    def __init__(self, coxeter_group):
        r"""
        Initialize ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: from sage.combinat.fully_commutative_elements import FullyCommutativeElements
            sage: FC = FullyCommutativeElements(CoxeterGroup(['H', 4]))
            sage: TestSuite(FC).run()
        """
```

{{{#diff
             sage: list(FCAffineA2.iterate_to_length(4))
-            [[], [0], [1], [2], [1, 0], [2, 0], [0, 1], [2, 1], [0, 2], [1,

Alright, I believe I've addressed all your concerns. I did take care to fix other instances that were similar to the cases you pointed out when possible, and verified the docs build and look OK.

Per the first suggestion, I eliminated `cartier_foata_form` and simply kept `normalize`; I think we were concerned that "normalize" isn't very descriptive, but given that the docstring says exactly how we are normalizing, I don't think it's a problem.

Thank you. Last tidbits:

The docstring of `normalize` is not correct because you are not returning anything. I would say

```
Mutate ``self`` into Cartier-Foata normal form.
```
(the single hyphen is because this doesn't convert it to latex, sadly).

I missed this when reading the docstring, but in `coset_decomposition`, I would change `l` to `\ell` so there is no possible confusion with `1` or `I` (plus IMO, the latex version is prettier).
