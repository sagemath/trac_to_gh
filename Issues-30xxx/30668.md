Autoconf is finally getting an update after 8 years, and there are some breaking changes. A beta version has been released for testing:

  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2020-09/msg00006.html

We should try to bootstrap sage with the new version to make sure everything works before any end-users get a chance to.

This ticket also unbreaks make targets such as `distclean`, which rely on normal return from `./bootstrap`, for these on autoconf 2.71


Upstream: **Not yet reported upstream; Will do shortly.**

I think that leaves only the obsolete `AC_PROG_CC_C99` in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4`. The new autoconf docs say that we can replace

```
    AC_LANG_PUSH(C)
    if test -z "$CC"; then
        SAGE_MUST_INSTALL_GCC([a C compiler is missing])
    fi

    # Save compiler before checking for C99 support                             
    save_CC=$CC
    # Check that we can compile C99 code                                        
    AC_PROG_CC_C99()
    if test "x$ac_cv_prog_cc_c99" = xno; then
        SAGE_MUST_INSTALL_GCC([your C compiler cannot compile C99 code])
    fi
    # restore original CC                                                       
    CC=$save_CC
    AC_LANG_POP()
```

with

```
    if test -z "$CC"; then
        SAGE_MUST_INSTALL_GCC([a C compiler is missing])
    fi

    if test "x$ac_cv_prog_cc_c99" = xno; then
        SAGE_MUST_INSTALL_GCC([your C compiler cannot compile C99 code])
    fi
```

since we already call `AC_PROG_CC()`, and it now sets `$ac_cv_prog_cc_c99`.

**But** that would skip the C99 check for people using older autoconf. Should we...

1. ignore that problem, or
2. set the minimum version of autoconf required to 2.70, or
3. just leave the `AC_PROG_CC_C99()` alone for now and fix it in the future?

Of course I haven't tested on a system with a brand-new autoconf and a twenty-year-old gcc, but the documentation for >=autoconf-2.70 says that `AC_PROG_CC` can now set it:

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=autoconf-archive.git;a=blob_plain;f=m4/ax_absolute_header.m4 has a newer version.

For other autoconf-archive macros that actually need changing, it would probably be good to prepare a pull request.

I can revert ax_c_check_flag.m4 change. 

How about extra quotes to be put in in
ax_check_compile_flag.m4 ?
Would you object to `2.64` becoming `[2.64]` ?

You can unmask autoconf-2.71 on Gentoo by adding the line `sys-devel/autoconf:2.71` to `/etc/portage/package.unmask`.

I am sceptical of the unreported race condition, but have too many other things to worry about at the moment.

weirdly, `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_BOOST` creeps up in a warning, even though full `boost` package is gone.

```

feels like wrong quoting somewhere?

As well:

```

  --with-system-boost_cropped={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system boost_cropped
  --with-boost[=ARG]      use Boost library from a standard location
