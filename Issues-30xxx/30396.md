Last lines after what appears to be a full compilation of sagelib:

Sage will try to use your system Python
if it is >= 3.6 and < 3.9.

Or it can build its own Python which will be 3.8.5.

To make sure it builds its own Python
if you build from scratch:

```
$ make configure
$ ./configure --with-system-python3=no -q
$ make -s V=0
```

where
- you can replace `make configure` by `./bootstrap`
- `-q` is for "quiet", drop it for more verbose output
- `-s V=0" are for "silent" and "lowest verbosity",
  drop them for more verbose output

To force Sage to rebuild Python and everything that
depends on it, after it was built using the ambient
system's Python:

```
$ V=0 sage -f python3
```

where again V=0 is for less verbose output,
drop it if you like more verbose output.
