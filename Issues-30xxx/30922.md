Various Python packages that we use do not declare their dependencies correctly using python packaging metadata. 

This is not visible in a standard build of the Sage distribution because we manually manage dependencies using Sage-specific dependency information. But it becomes problematic as we move toward using standard Python infrastructure in #29705.

On this ticket we track the upstream issues.
