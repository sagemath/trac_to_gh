Originally Sage was called SAGE (in all-caps).

Many code comments, docstrings or error messages
still have the all-caps version.

This ticket is to fix that.

To locate all-caps `SAGE` not preceded or followed
by underscore, change to the Sage root folder and run:

```bash
$ git grep '\([^_]\|^\)SAGE\([^_]\|$\)' src
```

This leaves alone environment variables
such as `DOT_SAGE` or `SAGE_SRC` etc.

In `src/sage/schemes/plane_conics/all.py` and elsewhere, while we are at it:

```diff
-#   Sage: System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation
+#   Sage: Open Source Mathematical Software
```

In `src/sage/matroids/linear_matroid.pyx` maybe un-all-caps this comment:

```diff
-        # REMNANT OF THE OLD CODE THAT WAS NOT YET TRANSLATED
-        # TO Sage'S GRAPH ISOMORPHISM. POTENTIAL SPEEDUP?
+        # Remnant of the old code that was not yet translated
+        # to Sage's graph isomorphism. Potential speedup?
```

In `src/sage/symbolic/todo.txt`, properly capitalize other software names too?

```diff
-* Maybe change Sage's Ginac to make a call to a cython gcd function, then use
-singular, since singular's gcd over QQ is much better than ginac's, I think,
-and ginac *only* does GCD over QQ.  Actually, just make everything in normal.cpp

+* Maybe change Sage's GiNaC to make a call to a Cython gcd function, then use

+  and GiNaC *only* does gcd over QQ.  Actually, just make everything in

```

That todo file should really go, see #30482.

Marking critical since it's been so long this name change happened.

I really want this to be in Sage 9.2 so we turn that page.
