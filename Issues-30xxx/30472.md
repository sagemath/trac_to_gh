Originally Sage was called SAGE (in all-caps).

Many code comments, docstrings or error messages
still have the all-caps version.

This ticket is to fix that.

To locate all-caps `SAGE` not preceded or followed
by underscore, change to the Sage root folder and run:

```bash
$ git grep '\([^_]\|^\)SAGE\([^_]\|$\)' src
```

This leaves alone environment variables
such as `DOT_SAGE` or `SAGE_SRC` etc.

In `src/sage/schemes/plane_conics/all.py` and elsewhere, while we are at it:

```diff

```

In `src/sage/matroids/linear_matroid.pyx` maybe un-all-caps this comment:

In `src/sage/symbolic/todo.txt`, properly capitalize other software names too?

```diff
-* Maybe change Sage's Ginac to make a call to a cython gcd function, then use

That todo file should really go, see #30482.
