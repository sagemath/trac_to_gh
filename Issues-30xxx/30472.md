Originally Sage was called SAGE (in all-caps).

Many code comments, docstrings or error messages
still have the all-caps version.

This ticket is to fix that.

To locate all-caps `SAGE` not preceded or followed
by underscore, change to the Sage root folder and run:

```bash
$ git grep '\([^_]\|^\)SAGE\([^_]\|$\)' src
```

This leaves alone environment variables
such as `DOT_SAGE` or `SAGE_SRC` etc.

In `src/sage/matroids/linear_matroid.pyx` maybe un-all-caps this comment:

```diff
