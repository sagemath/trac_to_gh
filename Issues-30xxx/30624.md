**Context**

Recent work on Sage's build system enables to use many
system packages as possible when building Sage.
See meta-ticket #27330 for an overview.

Part of that effort is to have `configure` end with
recommendations of extra system packages to install.

Making this recommendation system very precise would not
be sustainable. As a compromise, it recommends installing
packages whenever

- satisfactory versions of these packages
  are not found to be already installed
- some version of that OS has versions of these packages
  that would avoid having to build them

**Problem**

With the wording of the recommendation hint up to
Sage 9.2.beta12, users can be puzzled when it recommends
installing a package that is already installed.

**Solution**

Improve the recommendation message and along the way
make it better stand out.

Before this ticket:

```
configure: hint: installing the following system packages
is recommended and may avoid building some of the above SPKGs
from source:
configure:   $ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libcdd-dev libcdd-tools libnauty-dev
```

After this ticket:

```
configure:

    hint: installing the following system packages, if not
    already present, is recommended and may avoid building
    them from source (some may have to be built anyway):

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install libcdd-dev libcdd-tools libnauty-dev
```

See also #30863 whose aim is the same (e.g., do not suggest to `sudo apt install sympow` if the reason was that the sympow already installed on the system was failing some tests).

Depends on #30606

    The following command is to automatically apply these suggestions.
    Run it once to apply the suggestions for the current session.
    Add it to your shell profile to apply them for all future sessions.

This change is not good. # is the shell comment character.
The idea here is that (if PROMPT is not used) that you get a valid shell script as the output.

```

-        $IF_VERBOSE echo "# keg-only packages for the current shell session:"

If you put this ticket on top of #30606, you could add customization of the comment prefix in the same way that #30606 adds customization of the prompt...

<a id='comment:11'>Comment 11:</a>
Neither of the "notice: ...", "hint: ...",
or "After installation, ..." parts start with "# ".

So I tried to also avoid "# " for the text
on linking Homebrew's keg-only packages.

Thanks for showing me the correct way to do that.

FWIW, I've installed Sage 9.3.beta0 from scratch on Ubuntu 20.04; `configure` ends with the following recommendations:

```
configure: hint: installing the following system packages is recommended and may 
avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
configure:   $ sudo apt-get update 
  $ sudo apt-get install texlive-generic-extra texlive-xetex latexmk pandoc dvipng 
default-jdk ffmpeg libavdevice-dev libcdd-dev libcdd-tools libec-dev eclib-tools

pari-gp2c libpari-dev pari-doc pari-elldata pari-galdata pari-galpol pari-seadata 
sympow
```
Now, as mentioned in [#29557 comment:56](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/29557#comment:56), `texlive-generic-extra` does not exist on Ubuntu 20.04 (there is `texlive-latex-extra`, which is already installed on my system). Moreover the recommended packages `texlive-xetex`,  `latexmk`, `pandoc`, `dvipng`, `default-jdk`, `ffmpeg`, `libavdevice-dev`, `libcdd-dev` and `libcdd-tools` are already installed on my system.

I just tested the branch on Ubuntu 18.04, I obtain:

```
configure:

    notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:

        _recommended boost coxeter3 gp2c igraph isl libsemigroups pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata
        
checking for the package system in use... debian
configure:

    hint: installing the following system packages, if not
    already present, is recommended and may avoid having to
    build them (though some may have to be built anyway):

      $ sudo apt-get update 
      $ sudo apt-get install  texlive-generic-extra texlive-xetex latexmk pandoc dvipng default-jdk ffmpeg libavdevice-dev libboost-dev pari-gp2c libigraph-dev libisl-dev

    After installation, re-run configure using:

      $ ./config.status --recheck && ./config.status
         
```

Should `_recommended` be listed in the first list?
