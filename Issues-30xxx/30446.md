Before this ticket:

```
sage: n((24*sqrt(3))^(100/50))
3.80392047155301e5927962146
sage: n((24*sqrt(3))^(2))
1728.00000000000
```
Clearly, both should be the same, namely the second.

This was on SageMath 9.1 on openSUSE Leap 15.2 (64bit) (reported by a colleague to me).

I've tried to reproduce, but my SageMath, as well as on CoCalc crashes. The error message on my machine was

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 25, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Cython'
Error while executing Python code.
Saved trace to /home/dakrenn/.sage/crash_logs/crash_lqkqgydq.log
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aborted (core dumped)
```
However, my SageMath seems to be fine otherwise, `make ptestlong` passes.
Same on current 9.2.beta9.

There is no need to use big numbers, so the situation is even worse than it first appeared:

```
sage: n((2*sqrt(2))^(2/1))                                                      
1.24131221754531e1292913987
sage: n((2*sqrt(2))^2)                                                          
8.00000000000000
```
This only takes a few seconds with 9.1 on `CoCalc` (but needs more than 1GB of memory) or with 9.2b13 on MacOS 10.15.6.

Okay, I believe I've tracked this down. It is a `pynac` bug. Here's what's happening:

`Sage` eventually calls `pynac`'s `pow` from `sage.symbolic.expression:Expression._pow_`, but before that happens, it simplifies the exponent. Specifically, it simplifies the exponent so that `pynac` thinks it is an integer, but its type is still `MPQ`.

None of that should matter, except that what `pynac` calls to evaluate the expression is `numeric::pow_intexp`. Here is the content of that function:

```
if (not exponent.is_integer())
    throw std::runtime_error("nueric::pow_intexp: exponent not integer");
if (exponent.t == MPZ) {
    if (not mpz_fits_sint_p(exponent.v._bigint))
        throw std::runtime_error("size of exponent exceeds signed long size");
    return power(mpz_get_si(exponent.v._bigint));
}
return power(exponent.v._long);
```

In this function, `exponent.is_integer()` is `True` and `exponent.t` is `MPQ`. So both of the `if` statements are false, and `power(exponent.v._long)` is called. The problem is that `v._long` contains junk (very large junk!). Evaluating that statement takes a long time, and it won't give you the answer you want.

If, on the other hand, the second `if` statement were true, the result would have been exactly what you want. So simply checking whether `exponent.t == MPQ` or `exponent.t == MPZ` should fix this. I haven't tried this, but it's what I would at least try.

I think it may be possible as well to fix this by getting `Sage` to change the type of the exponent when it's cancelled out. I haven't looked into this and I think it sounds like a bad idea.

I'm unassigning this because I can't currently report it upstream.

I can't find any mistake, the patchbots are green, and the html documentation builds for me.

I wonder if maybe this error was posted to the wrong ticket? It is exactly the same error that was reported by a patchbot on ticket #30378 because I goofed up the `WARNING` block there:

```
[dochtml] OSError: docstring of sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.subs:135: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.
