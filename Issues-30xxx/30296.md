After #31035, our `mathjax` spkg is only used in our sphinx documentation.  We currently ship a "stripped" version of mathjax 2.7.4 (see `build/pkgs/mathjax/spkg-src`; #25032, #18596); #25833 proposes an upgrade to 3.x.

We add an `spkg-configure.m4` script for the standard package `mathjax`, as well as corresponding system package information in `build/pkgs/mathjax/distros/` using https://repology.org/projects/?search=mathjax

The commit only indicates where the system directory should be inserted.

I don't plan to work on this ticket. 


Hoping that people knowledgeable about the Jupyter notebook and/or documentation building will be interesting in working on it.

> Also `notebook` bundles mathjax ... why do we install another copy?


See

- [Stack Overflow question 28909747: How do I configure mathjax for iPython notebooks?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/28909747)

and the various answers there, including

- [StackOverflow answer 58866858](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58866858)

which states

> Jupyter ships with its own (smaller) version of MathJax.
> This is why it is not able to find the (Computer Modern)
> 'TeX' font -- there only is the STIX font.


So it's possible that the smaller version of MathJax
shipped by Jupyter Notebook is not enough for our Sphinx use.

Configuring Jupyter Notebook to use Sage's fuller MathJax
might have benefits (ability to typeset more math?)
and/or drawbacks (performance?).

FWIW: On Arch we're unbundling mathjax from Jupyter and using the system one:

https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-community/blob/packages/jupyter-notebook/trunk/PKGBUILD#L40

Everything works fine, even without the /usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions/mathjax symlink installed by sage.

Still no `spkg-configure.m4`?

This script just needs to rewrite `sage.env.MATHJAX_DIR` to the system mathjax2 directory (`/usr/share/mathjax`?) if found in the system.

Perhaps it also needs to decide if it is really mathjax2 or mathjax3...

I am ready to duplicate it to #25833.

This may not be true since the system mathjax2 would have all fonts and be too large to use for sage documentation. Sphinx will copy the whole to each `_static` directory of every documentation (reference, tutorial, ...).

Then the conclusion would be that we should not try to use the system mathjax???

I guess that could be done for sage, independent of this ticket. Then it would reduce the number of times to copy `$SAGE_SHARE/mathjax` to `_static/`.

Nonetheless, `spkg-configure.m4` needs to copy the reduced set of files from the system mathjax to `$SAGE_SHARE/mathjax`.

Well, my point is that once there is just one copy of `_static`, then maybe it's not *that* bad to just copy over the entire contents of the system mathjax dir.

mathjax is a javascript library, and perhaps unique in that among sage spkgs. I doubt if `spkg-configure.m4` script is relevant with mathjax.

I agree. Still as this mathjax package is not big and does not take time to install, I doubt if it would ever be worth while to put necessary efforts for this package.

Hence I suggest closing this ticket as "won't fix".

Sage's mathjax has "never" worked for me. This is probably due to font stripping (https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18596#comment:4), but undoing that would make the package larger.

So I'd quite like the ability to use the unbroken copy my distro provides, regardless of any time/bandwidth savings. Ultimately I can write the spkg-configure if no one else does it. I'll probably wait until the mathjax-3.x upgrade is done though.

Now that mathjax3 is well in place, would you do the work? 

From Matthias: `src/sage/docs/conf.py` expects sage.env.MATHJAX_DIR to be set to the location. This is what we'd have to configure if we take mathjax either from a system installation, or some other source.

Now I'm waiting for my distro package to be upgraded (https://bugs.gentoo.org/837722), but yes, I'll get to it eventually.
