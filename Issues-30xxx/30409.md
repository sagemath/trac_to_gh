In niche use cases, it is helpful to normalize a dynamical system defined over a number field with respect to a p-adic absolute value. By adding an optional ideal parameter, we allow for normalization with respect to a p-adic absolute value. In this context, normalization is scaling so that one coefficient has absolute value 1 while the rest have absolute value less than 1.

Only one complaint here. I think it would be better to use **kwds and allow ideal= or valuation= instead of overloading the ideal parameter.

Otherwise, the functionality works as expected.


I was able to produce some cases where the phrasing of the error messages was not quite aligned with the issue, but these are not cases where the function should be working.

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2 + 2*x*y + 3*y^2, 4*y^2 + 5*x*y+7*x^2])
f.normalize_coordinates(ideal=QQbar(3))
ValueError: ideal was defined over QQ, but the base ring of this morphism is Algebraic Field
```
This is not an ideal defined over QQ, rather it is the ideal (1) in QQbar.


Similarly, this is an ideal contrary to what the error says

```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQbar,1)
f=DynamicalSystem([x^2 + 2*x*y + 3*y^2, 4*y^2 + 5*x*y+7*x^2])
f.normalize_coordinates(ideal=QQbar.ideal(3))
TypeError: ideal must be an ideal or a valuation, not Principal ideal (1) of Algebraic Field
```

I'm not suggesting you special case things like QQbar in your error messages. Rather perhaps make the language somewhat more general. In this second you could say, must be a prime ideal or valuation. The first error may not a bigger language change.

Those errors I think are less confusing.

two things

- **kwds is what should be used

- the kwds should be in a keywords: block of the INPUT section,
