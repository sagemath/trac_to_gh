<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

Thank you. This is much easier to review. This looks pretty good overall. Here are my comments:

In the `examples.py`, those should each be in separate files and simply imported in.

You don't need the `\` to break lines in docstrings.

Rather than importing each of the examples, you should do

```
lazy_import('sage.algebras.lie_conformal_algebras', 'examples', _as='lie_conformal_algebras')
```
That way you can access them all from the command line as `lie_conformal_algebras.Foo`.
Then in the `examples.py` module-level doc you can have a link to each file too.

Instead of putting the docstring in the `__init__`, it is better to put it at the class level.

All methods need doctests. A good one for `__init__` is

```
sage: F = Foo(bar)
sage: TestSuite(F).run()
```
For `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__`, it is good to have a test with different input showing the result is the same object (or delegates to the correct class).

Error messages, per Python conventions, should not start with a capital letter nor end with a period/full-stop.

Don't be afraid to break the 80 char/line limit when it makes the code more readable.

A `LieConformalAlgebra` should also inherit from `Parent`.

You might want to add a _test_jacobi` method to the `LieConfirmalAlgebra` (or maybe to the category) that tests the Jacobi identity.

If you want to try and speed things up, changing `lie_conformal_algebra_element.py` to a Cython file and the elements to `cdef` classes can get you some more speed.

I would avoid `NN` and instead use `ZZ` and checking if the element is positive.

I don't understand why you have `LieConformalAlgebraWithGenerators` and `LieConformalAlgebraWithBasis`. I would just fold the latter into the former (in particular, a basis implies generators).

You can change `@abstract_method(optional=False)` -> `@abstract_method` and remove the `raise` code.

Since the `ConformalLieAlgebras` category inherits from `Modules`, I don't think you need the `SubcategoryMethods:` `WithBasis`, `Graded`, and `Super`.

It might be better to split off some of those stub categories into separate files so they can have room to grow later on (and it has better separation-of-concerns that way too).

I thought I was using that only in the middle of a long sphinx directive like 

```
:class:`this name<\
this.long.class>`
```
To adhere to PEP8... I'll look for those.

This is going to be heavy to change in the whole doctesting framework as I am currently calling those examples directly by their classnames. I thought there wasn't anything bad by lazily importing those classes, is there some performance reduction by importing them individualy?

I had this in previous code, but as soon as I moved to have `LieConformalAlgebra_with_basis` inheriting from `CombinatorialFreeModule` this started raising errors from `UniqueRepresentation`. I'll see if I can reproduce this

I thought perhaps adding the check right after initialization. Skew-symmetry is doable at the dictionary level in the `__classcall_` as it is done now. But Jacobi is a pain. However, right after the call to `CombinatorialFreeModule.__init__` the bracket can be converted to actual vectors and Jacobi should be testable. The problem is that as it is now, just setting the structure constants for E8 takes a while. Testing Jacobi would be minutes!

I'll add the method as you suggest and then perhaps a keyword to the classcall to test it?

That is not necessarily true, a basis is as a basis of `R`-modules while the generators are as LCAs, which in particular is as `R[T]`-modules. But mostly the point is that sometimes you do have generators but there aren't a particularly natural choice, while there is a natural basis. Take the N=2 vertex algebra or LCA where different sets of generators would be called different topological twists, while the basis is the same. 

But I do agree that this will most probably not be ever used, so I don't mind collapsing those two classes together if you think is best.

Ah thanks, perhaps I can get rid of WithBasis, but I think Graded and Super need to be implemented as they are here cause I need them to commute, otherwise they wont. They wont commute even with "FinitelyGenerated". This is in general correct, but I left a note in the category saying that we will never care for gradings that do not preserve the super structure, so Super graded LCA should be the same as graded super LCA.

Sure, perhaps the whole graded tree that has the most methods?

I thought there wasn't anything bad by lazily importing those classes, is there some performance reduction by importing them individualy?\n\nI realize this, but when I make such changes, a big find-replace usually cuts out a lot of the work. While the lazy importing is good, it does add more objects to the global namespace. It might be reasonable to have multiple entry points for some of these classes. However, this reduces the number of potential name conflicts and makes tab completion a little better for the less (or different) specialized user.\n\n> > A `LieConformalAlgebra` should also inherit from `Parent`.\n> > \n\n> I had this in previous code, but as soon as I moved to have `LieConformalAlgebra_with_basis` inheriting from `CombinatorialFreeModule` this started raising errors from `UniqueRepresentation`. I'll see if I can reproduce this \n\nHmm...that is strange. Was it an unable to resolve the MRO error? There might be an issue with having things in the wrong order for the MRO. I would have to actually see the error to know what to do, and I haven't tried to directly change your code yet.\n\n> > You might want to add a `_test_jacobi` method to the `LieConfirmalAlgebra` (or maybe to the category) that tests the Jacobi identity.\n> > \n\n> I thought perhaps adding the check right after initialization.

By having this method, it gets called automatically only when running `TestSuite(foo).run()`, which should have such methods for checking consistency (and can be set to test a limited number of elements). See `ZZ._test_associativity??` or `_test_jacobi_identity` in the `LieAlgebras` category (the former I think is a better implementation).\n\n> > I don't understand why you have `LieConformalAlgebraWithGenerators` and `LieConformalAlgebraWithBasis`.

For those, you can do

```

```
This is used in a number of places. It is good to be close to be PEP8, but even within PEP8, there is some flexibility.

I realize this, but when I make such changes, a big find-replace usually cuts out a lot of the work. While the lazy importing is good, it does add more objects to the global namespace. It might be reasonable to have multiple entry points for some of these classes. However, this reduces the number of potential name conflicts and makes tab completion a little better for the less (or different) specialized user.

Hmm...that is strange. Was it an unable to resolve the MRO error? There might be an issue with having things in the wrong order for the MRO. I would have to actually see the error to know what to do, and I haven't tried to directly change your code yet.

However, right after the call to `CombinatorialFreeModule.__init__` the bracket can be converted to actual vectors and Jacobi should be testable. The problem is that as it is now, just setting the structure constants for E8 takes a while. Testing Jacobi would be minutes!

No, you don't call it from the `__classcall__`. By having this method, it gets called automatically only when running `TestSuite(foo).run()`, which should have such methods for checking consistency (and can be set to test a limited number of elements). See `ZZ._test_associativity??` or `_test_jacobi_identity` in the `LieAlgebras` category (the former I think is a better implementation).

I completely agree that you can have a finitely generated algebra without it having a (distinguished) basis. However, right now you have the class `LieConformalAlgebraWithGenerators` inheriting from the class `LieConformalAlgebraWithBasis`, implying that any subclass of `LieConformalAlgebraWithGenerators` must have a basis.

They wont commute even with "FinitelyGenerated". This is in general correct, but I left a note in the category saying that we will never care for gradings that do not preserve the super structure, so Super graded LCA should be the same as graded super LCA. This forced me to have those calls. 

You have to be a little careful between the `Graded` and `WithBasis` as they should **not** commute. You can have a graded algebra that has a basis that is not graded. For example, `{1, 1 + x}` is a basis for the graded ring `ZZ[x] / (x^2)` that is not graded. For commuting with `FinitelyGenerated`, I am less sure if you can have a finitely generated algebra that has a grading that is not finitely generated as a graded algebra.

Also, I think you shouldn't enforce such things between super and graded artificially like that as a user later on down the road might want a grading that is not necessarily compatible with the super grading (I think the code can do this, although I have never actually tried).

Probably. I leave that decision to you.

But that's the other way around here: these different classes are at the implementation level and not the category level. And by (finitely) generated in the description we mean "central extension of freely (finitely) generated". So any generated algebra by definition acquires a basis, given by the derivatives of all the non-central generators plus the central generators. 

The other way around is that it doesn't work. You can have an LCA with a chosen R-basis and not a chosen generating set.

I understand that, but in this case it does not applies. De definition of graded for vertex algebras is that there exists an actual operator whose eigenvalues are the grading. This is almost always the zero mode of the conformal vector.  This rules out gradings that are not compatible with any super structure. 

For the "with basis", this was an implementation decision. At this point constructing submodules and quotients of infinite dimensional graded modules with finite dimensional graded pieces is not implemented in modules.with_basis.subquotients. I've implemented this for modules where the "basis indexes" provide a `subset(energy=)` method that lists indices with a given grading.

If you have an R-basis, you have a natural distinguished generating set (as an R-algebra): the basis. Although it seems like you are meaning to say finite generating set or having some other condition(s), which I didn't see in the documentation. Is that correct?

Ah, I see. Okay, thanks. Although it already seems like graded and super commute:

```
sage: C1 = Modules(ZZ).Graded().Super()
sage: C2 = Modules(ZZ).Super().Graded()
sage: C1
Category of super modules over Integer Ring
sage: C2
Category of super modules over Integer Ring
sage: C1 is C2
True
sage: C1 = Algebras(ZZ).WithBasis().Graded().Super()
sage: C2 = Algebras(ZZ).WithBasis().Super().Graded()
sage: C1 is C2
True
```

There is #17367 which essentially introduces a category of infinite dimensional algebras with finite-dimensional graded components.

Hello, here's my attempt to cover many of the things you requested. 

> 
> In the `examples.py`, those should each be in separate files and simply imported in.

Done, recovered the original files for each example and added a new ticket #30043 with the missing examples. 

> 
> You don't need the `\` to break lines in docstrings.

I got rid of some by making the line longer than 80 columns, but had to keep others otherwise the links would not appear correctly in the html. 

>

I admit that I hated this idea at first but it took only one sed line and it is way better to have them under the same namespace with TAB-completion, thanks I didn't know that would come for free. 

> Then in the `examples.py` module-level doc you can have a link to each file too.

Done, there's also a catalog in the html refs but that's almost empty in this ticket.

Done, that's what took most of my day. I remember reading an argument of yours regarding this in one of the tickets about Lie algebras. The Development guide should state something about this. It seems to me that it encourages the other way around.

Thanks did this. In this ticket they all pass. In the vertex algebra one I had to cap the max_runs for some tests (going to 100 elements in an ideal of a vertex algebra can be very costly) and some others I commented them out cause they fail pickling, I'll have to deal with that.

I added some of these.

I think I corrected them all, hopefully I didn't miss many.


>

> 

Done, did so too for `VertexAlgebra` and `PoissonVertexAlgebra` in the other ticket. You were right I was puting `Parent` before `UniqueRepresentation` and that raised `__mro__` problems. 

> You might want to add a _test_jacobi` method to the `LieConfirmalAlgebra` (or maybe to the category) that tests the Jacobi identity.

I didn't do this yet for lack of time, I should have this tomorrow.

I was planning on moving all element classes to Cython in a separate ticket if/when they get merged, is that alright?

Done

> I don't understand why you have `LieConformalAlgebraWithGenerators` and `LieConformalAlgebraWithBasis`. I would just fold the latter into the former (in particular, a basis implies generators).

Regarding this issue: I think that was mostly a missuse of the name. I changed the name of the class and file to `FreelyGeneratedLieConformalAlgebra`. Perhaps the "finitely" version should also be called "finitely_freely_generated_lie_conformal_algebra" but seemed too long so I kept it. 

The algebras that those classes cover are central extensions of free `R[T]`-modules. I think it's best to keep the free version separated from the "with basis" version cause eventually I might implement quotients and ideals (although for LCA they are boring). 

> You can change `@abstract_method(optional=False)` -> `@abstract_method` and remove the `raise` code.
> 

Thanks I did so in many places. Kept some with a descriptive message.

> 

Got rid of the calls to WithBasis and nothing broke, thanks.

> It might be better to split off some of those stub categories into separate files so they can have room to grow later on (and it has better separation-of-concerns that way too).

Separated the Graded Tree. 

I am applying everything you say here to the other ticket, and I've rebased everything to this ticket and #30043. As long as the topology is simple it should be fine.

I'll try to make all calls consistent. My approach was to spend some time making sure that all categories where the same so that later I didn't need to worry about this issue. So I may have plenty of calls to different categories if I separate them right away.

Thank you for renaming the class. Now I am happy with the class hierarchy. Perhaps `FinitelyFreelyGeneratedLCA` for the name?

For the patchbot reports:

You can ignore the startup modules because you need the `all.py` and `__init__.py` to be imported.

For the pyflakes in the `examples.py`, you can do what Frédéric did in the `lie_algebras/examples.py` and just have an `assert` statement to silence the warnings.

This will need to be addressed:

```
Missing doctests in algebras/lie_conformal_algebras/lie_conformal_algebra_with_structure_coefs.py: 3 / 4 = 75%
```
(You can check this locally by `sage --coverage filename1.py filename2.py path/to/directory`.)

<div id="comment:22" align="right">comment:22</div>

This is my attempt to fix the categories files without too much cluttering. 

* Super LCAs are not LCAs
* Super.Graded = Graded.Super

There are a couple of methods that are repeated on the non-super and super classes, but I think this is unavoidable. 

I thought of separating the super files into their own files, but since there will be always this overlap, I think it's safer to keep them together, so that it is clear that when you modify a ParentMethod the same method on the super class needs to be modified. 

* (super) LCAs with basis have their own file
* finitely generated (super) LCAs have their own file

Finally I simplified a bit the element classes by using the methods provided from filtered_modules_with_basis and super_modules_with_basis. 

EDIT: I also added your fixes in your branch, didn't want to edit on top of that one.

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:25\" align=\"right\">comment:25</div>\n\nThis new commit moves all repeated methods to implementation classes. The way I see this we have three options:\n\n1. Repeat methods on `LieConformalAlgebras()` and `LieConformalAlgebras().Super()` and \n   their subcategories (this is implemented in `HEAD~`)\n2. Have the repeated methods in some stub class in the implementation files (this is implemented in `HEAD`) or \n3. Have the repeated methods in some stub `Category`. \n\nI would vote against 3. because this approach will require having an entire tree of categories for the combinations of `WithBasis()`, `FinitelyGenerated()` and `Graded()` that have both `ElementMethods` and `ParentMethods`. \n\nThese classes are already in place for 2. so there isn't much cost into having the methods there. The pros are that there is no repetitions while the cons are that we are not enforcing implementation details at the category level. Since this is really a design decision I'll follow what you decide. I leave here my preference for 2. which seems cleaner. Perhaps one can add abstract methods to the categories for the purpose of documentation. \n\nAs a side note: since I think this motif should appear in Sage in almost any algebra for any operad, this would be solved if instead of having `Category_over_base_ring)` we would have `Category_over_monoidal_category`. This way we would pass `LieConformalAlgebras(Modules(QQ))` or `LieConformalAlgebras(Modules(QQ).Super())` and we would obtain the right categories. I see that there is a `Category_over_base` which is a bit too general perhaps. If you think there might be interest on this I think this is easily doable and can open a different ticket.  It does not look like much work. For example `Category_over_tensor_category()` would work here. I could also adapt this to use simply `Category_over_base()`.",

This new commit moves all repeated methods to implementation classes. The way I see this we have three options:

1. Repeat methods on `LieConformalAlgebras()` and `LieConformalAlgebras().Super()` and 
   their subcategories (this is implemented in `HEAD~`)
2. Have the repeated methods in some stub class in the implementation files (this is implemented in `HEAD`) or 
3. Have the repeated methods in some stub `Category`. 

I would vote against 3. because this approach will require having an entire tree of categories for the combinations of `WithBasis()`, `FinitelyGenerated()` and `Graded()` that have both `ElementMethods` and `ParentMethods`. 

These classes are already in place for 2. so there isn't much cost into having the methods there. The pros are that there is no repetitions while the cons are that we are not enforcing implementation details at the category level. Since this is really a design decision I'll follow what you decide. I leave here my preference for 2. which seems cleaner. Perhaps one can add abstract methods to the categories for the purpose of documentation. 

As a side note: since I think this motif should appear in Sage in almost any algebra for any operad, this would be solved if instead of having `Category_over_base_ring)` we would have `Category_over_monoidal_category`. This way we would pass `LieConformalAlgebras(Modules(QQ))` or `LieConformalAlgebras(Modules(QQ).Super())` and we would obtain the right categories. I see that there is a `Category_over_base` which is a bit too general perhaps. If you think there might be interest on this I think this is easily doable and can open a different ticket.  It does not look like much work. For example `Category_over_tensor_category()` would work here. I could also adapt this to use simply `Category_over_base()`.

Here is a new version that has the (H-)graded and super functors commuting. So now the next question is how much overlap will there be between the super and the non-super code? Also, how much overlap is there with the Lie algebra code?

Perhaps there is some misunderstanding with terminology. A stub class is a very short class that has very minimal implementation. A stub class should not have a lot of methods by definition. This kind of abstraction is very common: there is a common ABC that has nearly all of the actual implementation with subclasses that carry meaning through their existence with a few additional methods that are specific to those classes (possibly growing larger than a stub).

Hopefully the convergence is not too slow. Thank you for working with me as we try to figure out what the best practices are. This has been a great test of the system.

My understanding is that this axiom should mean that the operation `[,]` is `R`-linear for a ring `R` and any element can be constructed as linear combination with coefficients in `R` of elements of the form `[a_1,[a_2,[...,[a_{n-1},a_n]...]` for `a_i` in a finite set of generators.

I thought it was doing that. Admittedly, I am not quite sure what you are asking/suggesting here.

The category framework would normally take care of that for you with join categories. The only reason you would specifically implement them that I see is because they would have specific methods you want (which means you would have to implement them anyways) or you wanted the category to print really pretty and it wasn't doing that before (but I think most users won't really care about that, if they even see it).

The way I see it, having more complex class hierarchy does increase the maintenance burden, but not as much as having duplicate methods.

I think what I am suggesting in #30233 comment 10 or even the more radical comment 13 are mathematically correct and easy to implement in Sage. It would also solve this issue here and simplify the `FinitelyGenerated` methods in the other tickets for vertex algebras. 

> 
> I thought it was doing that. Admittedly, I am not quite sure what you are asking/suggesting here.

Ah I apologize perhaps it's doing that. I saw that this patch removes `LieConformalAlgebras.SubcategoryMethods.FinitelyGenerated()` and I don't see how it gets replaced. But I guess now from your comment that it would be calling `BracketConformalAlgebras.FinitelyGenerated()` it this one has one implemented in their subcategory methods.

With this last statement I agree, the worst situation is duplicate methods. But another solution is as it is now to have the methods in the implementation classes instead of the category classes. For example, `GradedLieConformalAlgebraElement` implements `nproduct` both for super algebras or usual LCAs. 

However, I gather from all your messages that you would rather have the extra tree of stub categories. This is fine by me. I can code that quickly and implement the changes you have in this branch. However, I'll wait to see what we agree on the issue of 1. above, if my suggestion in #30233 is fine or if I should keep `FinitelyGeneratedAsLieConformalAlgebra` or similar.

I think this is good to go into Sage. We can continue to make improvements to the code here as things progress in the later tickets. With the current version, it is flexible enough to change without major difficulties IMO.

Thank you for all your hard work and discussions on this ticket.

Great, thanks for your work and time. I'll prepare the other tickets right away. The examples ones should be easy. The vertex algebras one will take me a little bit cause I'll implement the same category changes that you asked in this one. Do you have an idea for the stub category name?
