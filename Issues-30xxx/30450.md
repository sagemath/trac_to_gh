**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/combinat/root_system/reflection_group_element.pyx", line 71, in sage.combinat.root_system.reflection_group_element.ComplexReflectionGroupElement.__hash__
Failed example:
    WB_hash.intersection(WC_hash)                     # optional - gap3
Expected:
    set()
Got:
    {-9223363265629785093,
     ...
```

Perhaps we should change the test to

```
sage: len(WB_hash.intersection(WC_hash)) < WB.cardinality()
True
```
as there is no guarantee that the parents have sufficiently different hashes to lead to them being disjoint:

```
sage: WB = ReflectionGroup(['B',5])
sage: WC = ReflectionGroup(['C',5])
sage: hash(WC)                                                                                                                 
-9223363307533887018
sage: hash(WB)
