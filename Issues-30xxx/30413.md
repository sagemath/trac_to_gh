This works

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2)                                                                                                                                 
sage: I = R.ideal([y - x])                                                                                                                                           
sage: I.plot()
```
but this fails

```           
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2)
sage: I = R.ideal([x - 1])
sage: I.plot()  
```
