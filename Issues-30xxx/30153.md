(from jhpalmieri, #30123)

Note that sage -b doesn't work any more: it tries to do `cd "$SAGE_SRC" && $MAKE`, but `SAGE_SRC/Makefile.in` was removed in #29411. (If you have done an incremental build, the Makefile is still there.)

This should be fixed now.

Yes, it was convenient to go through the Makefile, and I think this change is good as it improves uniformity.

<a id='comment:11'></a>I think this works. The first time I got a file `build/make/sagelib-no-deps`, but maybe I forgot to run `./bootstrap`/`.configure`/etc. It's working now.

- Can we add a comment in `Makefile.in` explaining what `$(1)-no-deps` is and how it should be used? I'm guessing that it tries to build the package but ignores its dependencies. Does that have any uses aside from the Sage library? I've made an attempt.

Could we change the build rules so that

```
$$(INST)/$(1)-$(2)
```
just does `$(1)-build-deps` and `$(1)-no-deps`? It would cut out a tiny bit of code duplication. I guess we can't force the dependencies to be built before the package, so maybe not.

Thanks very much, this is perfect.

Regarding other uses - we could reimplement `sage -p` in terms of this. I just wasn't sure if we want to do this on the same ticket.
