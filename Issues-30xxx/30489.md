This is a follow up from #29934.

```
File "src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/library.py", line 553, in sage.geometry.polyhedron.library.Polytopes.regular_polygon
Warning, slow doctest:
    TestSuite(octagon).run()                                    # long time
Test ran for 154.93 s
    [409 tests, 301.67 s]
```
We shouldn't do large construction with base ring `AA`.

Also here the second line doesn't make any sense and should be like the fourth line:

```diff
+            if AA.has_coerce_map_from(self.base_ring()):
+                P = polytopes.regular_polygon(5, exact=True)
+            if RDF.has_coerce_map_from(self.base_ring()):
+                R = self*polytopes.regular_polygon(5, exact=False)
```
