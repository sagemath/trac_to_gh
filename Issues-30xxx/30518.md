Eigenvectors over QQbar could get incorrectly conjugated. In the following example from [devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/9Ss98-XKR9c), the eigenvectors of a matrix over `QuadraticField(-1)` are computed in two ways, one of which incorrectly returns the conjugate of some eigenvectors.

By converting the matrix to `QQbar` first:

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: m = matrix(K, 4, [2,4*i,-i,0, -4*i,2,-1,0, 2*i,-2,0,0, 4*i+4, 4*i-4,1-i,-2])
sage: sorted([(e, matrix.column(vs)) for e, vs, _ in m.change_ring(QQbar).eigenvectors_right()])
[(
    [  1   0]
    [1*I   0]
    [  0   0]
-2, [  0   1]
),
 (
                      [           1.000000000000000? + 0.?e-16*I]
                      [           0.?e-16 - 1.000000000000000?*I]
                      [           0.?e-16 - 6.605551275463989?*I]
-0.6055512754639893?, [1.000000000000000? + 1.000000000000000?*I]
),
 (
                    [           1.000000000000000? + 0.?e-17*I]
                    [           0.?e-17 - 1.000000000000000?*I]
                    [          0.?e-17 + 0.6055512754639893?*I]
6.605551275463989?, [1.000000000000000? + 1.000000000000000?*I]
)]
```

Supposedly, this result is correct. In contrast, computing the eigenvectors directly, without first converting to `QQbar`, leads to some eigenvectors getting conjugated:

```
sage: sorted([(QQbar(e), matrix.column(QQbar, vs)) for e, vs, _ in m.eigenvectors_right()])
[(
    [1 0]
    [I 0]
    [0 0]
-2, [0 1]
),
 (
                      [                                        1]
                      [           0.?e-54 + 1.000000000000000?*I]
                      [           0.?e-53 + 6.605551275463989?*I]
-0.6055512754639893?, [1.000000000000000? - 1.000000000000000?*I]
),
 (
                    [                                        1]
                    [           0.?e-53 + 1.000000000000000?*I]
                    [          0.?e-52 - 0.6055512754639893?*I]
6.605551275463989?, [1.000000000000000? - 1.000000000000000?*I]
)]
```

Note that the `QuadraticField` constructor automatically sets an embedding.

```
sage: K.coerce_embedding()
Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 with i = 1*I
  To:   Complex Lazy Field
  Defn: i -> 1*I
```

Depends on #31628

Unlike #31551, this happens with Sage 9.2 too. (The root cause may nevertheless be the same.)

The problem somehow comes from line 6638 in `matrix2.pyx`

```
m = hom(eigval.parent(), e.parent(), e)
```
What happens here is that the eigenvalue is quadratic over `QQ` (not over the base field `QQ[i]`) and that the above code does not construct the embedding that preserves the one of the base field. This can be reproduced as follows

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: L = K.extension(x^2 - 6*x - 4, 'a1')
sage: eigval = L.gen()
sage: eigval_conj = eigval.galois_conjugates(QQbar)
sage: f0 = hom(eigval.parent(), QQbar, eigval_conj[0])
sage: f1 = hom(eigval.parent(), QQbar, eigval_conj[1])
sage: f0(i)  # wrong embedding!!
0.?e-54 - 1.000000000000000?*I
sage: f1(i)  # wrong embedding!!
0.?e-54 - 1.000000000000000?*I
```

This is actually only a "partial" fix. It solves the following (that also used to fail)

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1, embedding=QQbar.gen())
sage: m = matrix(K, 4, [2,4*i,-i,0, -4*i,2,-1,0, 2*i,-2,0,0, 4*i+4, 4*i-4,1-i,-2])
sage: for e, vs, _ in m.eigenvectors_right():
....:     for v in vs:
....:         print(m*v == e*v)
True
True
True
True
```
But since

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)                                                   
sage: QQbar.coerce_map_from(K) is None
True
```
the original example of the ticket is not solved.
