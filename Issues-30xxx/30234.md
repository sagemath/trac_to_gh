We create a "subring" of the Symbolic "Ring" that only includes value objects without variables (like SymbolicConstantsRing) and has eager evaluation of relational operators.

Compare:

```
sage: s = SR('x') == 1                                                                                                                                                           
sage: s                                                                                                                                                                          
x == 1
sage: s in SR                                                                                                                                                                    
True
```
with:

```
sage: SymbolicValuesRing(SR('x'))
x
sage: SymbolicValuesRing(SR('x') >= 1)
error - cannot convert
sage: SymbolicValuesRing('x') >= 1
error - cannot decide
sage: assume(x >= 2)
sage: SymbolicValuesRing('x') >= 1
True
```

This could then be used for example with `Polyhedron(..., backend='field')`.


Approach 1 to implement this is to wrap elements of `SR` in some wrapper class. 



Approach 2 is to implement it through refactoring:

- We refactor the Symbolic Ring so that there is a convenient parent class for symbolic expressions with normal Python comparison semantics instead of creating relations. 

- The magic behavior of comparison operators for `SR` elements, creating relations, will be implemented in a wrapper class. 
Ideally, this will be unified with the separate implementation of this functionality in `sage.numerical.linear_functions`.


Here we do Approach 1.
