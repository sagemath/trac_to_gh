Keywords: deepcopy, lift_map

In sage 9.2 & 9.0 deepcopying the lift_map from a residue field at a prime does not finish because of recursion error

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: f = x^2-2
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(f)
sage: P = K(2).factor()[0][0]
sage: F = K.residue_field(P)
sage: m = F.lift_map()
sage: deepcopy(m)
```
gives

```

I don't think the `deepcopy` protocol is implemented for Sage objects. Most Sage objects are immutable.
