Why are you using `const int m` ? any particular reason ?

you must add tests to check the validity of input parameters.

Instead of `for v in G.vertices(sort=False)`, you can simply do `for v in G` which iterates over the unsorted vertices.,
And instead of `G.neighbors(v), you can use `G.neighbor_iterator(v)`.

a few pep8 issues like
- `(2*m-2,q)` -> `(2 * m - 2, q)`
- `({m},{q})` -> `({m}, {q})`
- `(%d,%d,%d)"%(e,m,q)` -> `(%d, %d, %d)"%(e, m, q)`

> Why are you using `const int m` ? any particular reason ?

The idea is that Cython is faster when static typing is used. Not sure how much of a gain is in these python-full functions.
However, I believe that types are great as they give the reader useful info.

> you must add tests to check the validity of input parameters.

Do you mean doctests or checks inside the functions?
For the latter there shouldn't be any need as errors will get raised from the functions used inside.

> Instead of `for v in G.vertices(sort=False)`, you can simply do `for v in G` which iterates over the unsorted vertices.,
> And instead of `G.neighbors(v), you can use `G.neighbor_iterator(v)`.

These are good things to know and I updated the code. Is there any benefit in using them?


> a few pep8 issues

I think I got them all fixed now.

I agree that this way the type of input is checked, but I don't think you can expect any speed up here.

I mean in the function, but if your are sure that functions called inside this method will raise errors in all cases, then it should be ok.

`for v in G` is equivalent to `for v in G.vertex_iterator()`. So it iterates over the vertices without assumption on the order of the vertices.
So far, `G.vertices()` returns a (sorted) list of vertices. So when you call `for v in G.vertices(sort=False):`, you first build the list of vertices and then iterate over it. It's equivalent to `for v in list(G)` or `for v in list(G.vertex_iterator())`. Building this list is a waste of space and time here.

This is different for edges as now `G.edges()` returns an object of type `EdgesView` enabling to iterate over the edges without building the list. So `for e in G.edges(sort=False)` and `for e in G.edge_iterator()` are now similar. In the future, `G.edge_iterator()` will certainly also return a `EdgesView`.
