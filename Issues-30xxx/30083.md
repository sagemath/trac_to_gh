```
sage: C = Modules(QQ)
sage: C.Super().Graded()
Join of Category of super modules over Rational Field and Category of graded vector spaces over Rational Field
sage: C.Graded().Super()
Category of super modules over Rational Field
```
Compare this with

```
sage: C = Modules(ZZ)
sage: C.Super().Graded()
Category of super modules over Integer Ring
sage: C.Graded().Super()
Category of super modules over Integer Ring
sage: _ is __
True
```
and for

```
sage: C = Algebras(QQ)
```

Keywords: **graded super vector spaces**

Component: **categories**
