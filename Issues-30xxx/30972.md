From Matthias Koeppe on #30915:

When we start using Sage with a system jupyter notebook (Meta-ticket #30306), there is an issue involving the installation directory `share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs`, and the fact that there will be several unrelated (and possibly mutually incompatible) copies of that.

Here is an example.

Let's say:
- system jupyter is installed in `/usr`, so the notebook server is accessing `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions`.
- Sage-9.x may be installed in `/home/x/sage-9.x/local/` and may need threejs r122.
- Sage-9.y may be installed in `/home/x/sage-9.y/local/` and may need threejs r155.
- Let's say r122 and r155 are mutually incompatible.

As @enriqueartal has reported in #30915, our offline threejs graphics needs `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs/`. But the system does not provide it -- it is only provided by Sage (and, after #30915 is the result of a custom build (fork) of threejs). 

If we create a symlink `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs` -> `/home/x/sage-9.x/local/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs`, then Sage 9.x will work with the system jupyter notebook; but Sage 9.y will not.

This means that we need a versioned installation scheme so that offline threejs graphics can access the specific version it needs even if the user is accessing Sage through the system notebook.

In this ticket we also rename directories from `threejs` to `threejs-sage` (in `share/` and `share/jupyter/nbextensions/`) to reflect the fact that it is a Sage-specific fork.  This will reduce the need for downstream patching.

(On this ticket we ignore the separate issue that installing such symlinks is not user-friendly -- see #30123 Repackage Sage's cropped `threejs` as a pip-installable package `jupyter-threejs-sage` for a follow-up.)

Why exactly would someone want to do this? I can see a user not wanting to upgrade to the newest version, but why would they use an older version when the newer one will almost certainly be an improvement?

I don't think this can be solved by using environment variables. The issue is that the notebook may access different kernels when the kernelspec is installed, and (apparently) the notebook webserver is expected to serve the local threejs files. Now these files are kernel-specific (because they are tied to the sagelib version).

Francois, how do you currently install these files in gentoo packaging?
(Overall I think we need some input from downstream packaging to make progress here.)

For "sagelib" I disable https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py#L281 because of the way I have to install documentation following Gentoo's guidelines (not everyone in Gentoo is happy with the current way of doing this) and I do the stuff from that line manually. For the rest, sagelib's kernel install is used - it wasn't always the case.

I just change the kernel specs to use the current python directly.

I don't support any versioning of sage whatsoever. Multiple pythons are supported and work thanks to the current Gentoo python infrastructure that supports it. But stuff in `/usr/share/jupyter/` has to be somewhat python independent really.

`sage-9999` is just sage straight from the git develop branch, so right now 9.2.beta3 (but in my case, Volker's develop branch).

Users who want versioning, usually are after reproducibility. In that case system packaging is not part of the solution. containers on the other are an ideal tool for that.

I would also propose to store the version of `threejs` that is required by the scripts / templates in `src/sage/ext_data/threejs/` in a text file in that directory.

From a packaging point of view it makes no sense to read this from the `version` file that is installed in `THREEJS_DIR`.

<a id='comment:20'>Comment 20:</a>
I guess I can accomodate that. I already ship threejs as a sage specific component in `/usr/share/sage`. I have to think if I will allow several versions of threejs on the system at once.

I had to update the path in `sage.repl.rich_output.backend_ipython.BackendIPythonNotebook.threejs_offline_scripts` similar to what you did for `BackendIPythonCommandline` in order to avoid 404s in jupyter/jupyterlab.

Since I already had the fix locally, I hope you don't mind that I've gone ahead and pushed it and pointed the ticket at it.

Ran both `online=True` and `online=False` for the command-line, jupyter, and jupyterlab. I also verified that the CDN fallback works for jupyter and jupyterlab (for the "Save as HTML" feature).

I would rather implement an idea Joshua raised some time ago on a ticket I can't locate: separate the Three.js viewer as a stand-alone package and keep all the versioning issues there. All of the dependencies of Sage on Three.js are in the template. If that were a separate package it would track the correct version of Three.js by default.

Joshua, can you remember which ticket had your thoughts on this? Are you game to take a crack at implementing this?

The problem remains that the Javascript code needs to be accessed by the Jupyter installation (notebook server), whereas the template needs to be accessed by Sage (Python code). These are in general separate installations - as I have explained with the example in the ticket description. So I don't think that this will help unless I misunderstand something there.

I believe this was [#30620 comment:4](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30620#comment:4) and [#30620 comment:7](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30620#comment:7) ("Three.js: future of examples/js files").

I don't think it'd solve the present versioning issue, though. We'd just be worrying about providing multiple offline versions of this new package instead.

I went ahead and re-tested the branch in the command-line, jupyter, and jupyterlab with both `online=True` and `online=False` and checked that plots saved using the `Save as HTML` feature still function.

I don't know how frowned upon it is to positively review a ticket you're listed as one of the authors of, but since this ticket has been in review for awhile without a bite, I'm going to go ahead and do so. Please feel free to change it back if there is any objection.

Apologies. I did not realize there were outstanding questions about the use case's validity, of which I can not personally attest. Just saw that it was in review for awhile yet functioning 'correctly' (to ticket's spec).

<a id='comment:40'>Comment 40:</a>
Let's discuss what the ticket changes step by step.

1) renames directories from `threejs` to `threejs-sage` (in share/ and share/jupyter/nbextensions/) to reflect the fact that it is a Sage-specific fork

for example in this change

```
-THREEJS_DIR = "@prefix@/share/threejs"
+THREEJS_DIR = "@prefix@/share/threejs-sage"
```

Any concerns or objections to that?

Use cases for having several versions of Sage installed

- install new version & keep old one for code you lack time to adapt
- stable release for normal use, beta for development work
- keep several versions around for the sake of bisecting
  breaking changes
- bare version and version with many optional packages installed
