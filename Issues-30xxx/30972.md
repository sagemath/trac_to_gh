From Matthias Koeppe on #30915:

When we start using Sage with a system jupyter notebook (Meta-ticket #30306), there is an issue involving the installation directory `share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs`, and the fact that there will be several unrelated (and possibly mutually incompatible) copies of that.

Here is an example.

Let's say:
- system jupyter is installed in `/usr`, so the notebook server is accessing `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions`.
- Sage-9.x may be installed in `/home/x/sage-9.x/local/` and may need threejs r122.
- Sage-9.y may be installed in `/home/x/sage-9.y/local/` and may need threejs r155.
- Let's say r122 and r155 are mutually incompatible.

As `@`enriqueartal has reported in #30915, our offline threejs graphics needs `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs/`. But the system does not provide it -- it is only provided by Sage (and, after #30915 is the result of a custom build (fork) of threejs). 

If we create a symlink `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs` -> `/home/x/sage-9.x/local/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs`, then Sage 9.x will work with the system jupyter notebook; but Sage 9.y will not.

This means that we need a versioned installation scheme so that offline threejs graphics can access the specific version it needs even if the user is accessing Sage through the system notebook.

In this ticket we also rename directories from `threejs` to `threejs-sage` (in `share/` and `share/jupyter/nbextensions/`) to reflect the fact that it is a Sage-specific fork.  This will reduce the need for downstream patching.

(On this ticket we ignore the separate issue that installing such symlinks is not user-friendly -- see #30123 Repackage Sage's cropped `threejs` as a pip-installable package `jupyter-threejs-sage` for a follow-up.)

Why exactly would someone want to do this? I can see a user not wanting to upgrade to the newest version, but why would they use an older version when the newer one will almost certainly be an improvement?

Considering that I don't even use Sage, I'll need a better answer than this before devoting more time to this issue. We are not required to support every feature desired by end users. We can simply tell them to run only one kernel at a time. Who is making the decision to support this option?

For "sagelib" I disable https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py#L281 because of the way I have to install documentation following Gentoo's guidelines (not everyone in Gentoo is happy with the current way of doing this) and I do the stuff from that line manually. For the rest, sagelib's kernel install is used - it wasn't always the case.

I just change the kernel specs to use the current python directly.

I don't support any versioning of sage whatsoever. Multiple pythons are supported and work thanks to the current Gentoo python infrastructure that supports it. But stuff in `/usr/share/jupyter/` has to be somewhat python independent really.

`sage-9999` is just sage straight from the git develop branch, so right now 9.2.beta3 (but in my case, Volker's develop branch).

Users who want versioning, usually are after reproducibility. In that case system packaging is not part of the solution. containers on the other are an ideal tool for that.

I would propose the following installation scheme in `share/` and (via symlink) `share/jupyter/nbextensions/`:

```
 - threejs-sage        (renamed to indicate that it is a fork)
   - r122/             (subdirectory for the version, replaces meaningless "build")
     - three.min.js

I would also propose to store the version of `threejs` that is required by the scripts / templates in `src/sage/ext_data/threejs/` in a text file in that directory.

From a packaging point of view it makes no sense to read this from the `version` file that is installed in `THREEJS_DIR`.

I had to update the path in `sage.repl.rich_output.backend_ipython.BackendIPythonNotebook.threejs_offline_scripts` similar to what you did for `BackendIPythonCommandline` in order to avoid 404s in jupyter/jupyterlab.

Since I already had the fix locally, I hope you don't mind that I've gone ahead and pushed it and pointed the ticket at it.

Ran both `online=True` and `online=False` for the command-line, jupyter, and jupyterlab. I also verified that the CDN fallback works for jupyter and jupyterlab (for the "Save as HTML" feature).

The problem remains that the Javascript code needs to be accessed by the Jupyter installation (notebook server), whereas the template needs to be accessed by Sage (Python code). These are in general separate installations - as I have explained with the example in the ticket description. So I don't think that this will help unless I misunderstand something there.

I believe this was[comment:4](#comment%3A4):ticket:30620 and[comment:7](#comment%3A7):ticket:30620 ("Three.js: future of examples/js files").

I don't think it'd solve the present versioning issue, though. We'd just be worrying about providing multiple offline versions of this new package instead.

This ticket also needs more input from distribution managers, who may not want to support this behavior. There need to be other voices clearly in favor of the direction this ticket moves, a direction I for one do not support.


Apologies. I did not realize there were outstanding questions about the use case's validity, of which I can not personally attest. Just saw that it was in review for awhile yet functioning 'correctly' (to ticket's spec).

Let's discuss what the ticket changes step by step.

1) renames directories from `threejs` to `threejs-sage` (in share/ and share/jupyter/nbextensions/) to reflect the fact that it is a Sage-specific fork

for example in this change

```
-THREEJS_DIR = "@prefix@/share/threejs"
+THREEJS_DIR = "@prefix@/share/threejs-sage"
```

Any concerns or objections to that?
