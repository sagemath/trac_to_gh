The file `combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py` tries to import the `warn` function from `sage.misc.misc`, but this function is actually in the `warnings` module.

```
sage: I = IncidenceStructure([1,2,3], [[1,2], [2,3]])
sage: view(I)
ImportError                Traceback (most recent call last)
.../site-packages/sage/combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py in _latex_(self)
   2187         from sage.functions.trig import arctan2
   2188 
-> 2189         from sage.misc.misc import warn
   2190         warn("\nThe hypergraph is drawn as a set of closed curves. The curve "
   2191              "representing a set S go **THROUGH** the points contained "
ImportError: cannot import name 'warn' from 'sage.misc.misc' (/ext/sage/sage-9.2/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/misc/misc.py)
```
As far as I can tell, no other source file makes this mistake.
