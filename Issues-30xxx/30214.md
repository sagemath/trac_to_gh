Before this ticket, the `show` method for a permutation

- computes a graph corresponding to that permutation
- displays it
- but does not return it

This ticket adds a `to_digraph` method to return the graph
and changes the `show` method to use it.

This allows the following:

```
sage: p = Permutation([3, 1, 2])
sage: g = p.to_digraph()
sage: g.edges(labels=False)
[(1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2)]
```
