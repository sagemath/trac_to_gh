For finite fields, #27949 added a `subfield` method.

Absolute number fields have a `subfield` method, but it is incompatible with the one added for finite fields.

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: K.subfield(1)
(Number Field in sqrt20 with defining polynomial x - 1 with sqrt20 = 1,
 Ring morphism:
   From: Number Field in sqrt20 with defining polynomial x - 1 with sqrt20 = 1
   To:   Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2 with sqrt2 = 1.414213562373095?
   Defn: 1 |--> 1)
```

#23245 notes that `RationalField` lacks many methods of general number fields, include `subfield`

Assuming that we want them compatible, I am leaning to the version of the finite fields `subfield()` methods, where the ring morphism is not returned as a coercion map is available indirectly. But heavy users of number fields might have different opinions.
