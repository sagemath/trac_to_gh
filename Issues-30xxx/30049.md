We add a class `MatrixSDPBackend`, subclassing `GenericSDPBackend`, which stores the SDP data in Sage matrices.

It will allow users to specify a base ring and thus store exact SDPs. This is similar to what `InteractiveLPBackend` provides for LPs.

Attempting to solve it will give a runtime error.

We change the existing backend class `CVXOPTSDPBackend` to derive from `MatrixSDPBackend`.
