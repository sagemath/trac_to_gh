What Cygwin version is it using?  This might be a newly introduced issue in one of Cygwin's libc headers.

I'm still on an older version that doesn't have this problem:

```

I've seen issues like this before.  The problem is visible in this line from the log:

```
  [scipy-1.5.2]     error: Command "g++ -Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wno-unused -I/cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/local/include/python3.8 -I/cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/numpy/core/include -Iscipy/_lib -Iscipy/_build_utils/src -Iscipy/spatial/ckdtree/src -I/cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/numpy/core/include -I/cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/local/include/python3.8 -c scipy/spatial/ckdtree/src/query.cxx -o build/temp.cygwin-3.1.7-x86_64-3.8/scipy/spatial/ckdtree/src/query.o -MMD -MF build/temp.cygwin-3.1.7-x86_64-3.8/scipy/spatial/ckdtree/src/query.o.d -std=c++14" failed with exit status 1
```

In Cygwin's libc, `__BSD_VISIBLE = 0` by default, because when using `-std=c[++]<nn>` flags it defined `__STRICT_ANSI__` and non-ANSI C extensions are not declared as you can see with the following test program:

```
$ cat bsd_visible.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/features.h>

#if defined(__STRICT_ANSI__)
#define DEFINED__STRICT_ANSI__ 1
#else
#define DEFINED__STRICT_ANSI__ 0
#endif

int main(void) {
    printf("defined(__STRICT_ANSI__) = %d\n", DEFINED__STRICT_ANSI__);
    printf("__BSD_VISIBLE = %d\n", __BSD_VISIBLE);
    return 0;
}
```

```
$ g++ -std=c++14 bsd_visible.c -o bsd_visible
$ ./bsd_visible.exe
defined(__STRICT_ANSI__) = 1
__BSD_VISIBLE = 0
```


However, if you compile with `-std=gnu[++]<nn>` the "kitchen sink" is enabled:

```
$ g++ -std=gnu++14 bsd_visible.c -o bsd_visible
$ ./bsd_visible.exe
defined(__STRICT_ANSI__) = 0
__BSD_VISIBLE = 1
```

You can also work around this by defining the `_GNU_SOURCE` macro e.g. when building SciPy.  This might be the easiest workaround:

```
$ g++ -std=c++14 -D_GNU_SOURCE bsd_visible.c -o bsd_visible
$ ./bsd_visible.exe
defined(__STRICT_ANSI__) = 1
__BSD_VISIBLE = 1
```
