it appears that currently we might accept about any freetype2 coming our way, as our version check is wrong.

```
$ pkg-config --modversion freetype2
outputs not something sane, but e.g. for freetype version 2.9.1 it is
22.1.6, for 2.10.2 it is 23.2.17
(which is probably some insane value produced following libtool
versioning rules)
while we check for it to be at least 2.4, oops...

This is completely batty. The version number is supposed to be the libtool number. There is nothing shipped with that number so what's the use. But `docs/VERSIONS.TXT` has a handy table

As you can see the libtool number is derived from the so number. If the so number is `a.b.c`, the libtool number is `a+b.c.b`. It is somewhere in the libtool manual but I for one, never used that number. I used what they called the so numbers directly which is a bit more pleasant. I also don't see the point in using the libtool number in the .pc file instead of the version. As can be seen there is a one to one correspondence. And you shouldn't ever try to figure the so number from your .pc file, you are not supposed too.

I guess they are committed to the absurd scheme now.
