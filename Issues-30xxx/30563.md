`maxima.py` is already using `MAXIMA` that leaves us with touching `maxima_abstract.py` and a couple of things to help sage-on-debian pass its doctests out of the box.

Not sure how to proceed with `bin/sage` as it is not reading that configuration file, nor should it.

OK, that's another issue, I don't like how sage-config is installed as a separate package but this is kind of orthogonal.

There is a couple more things to do before calling it done.
