Document configuring each common IDE or text editor
for using and/or developing Sage.

- CodeMirror
- [Emacs](https://wiki.sagemath.org/Emacs) with  `sage-shell-mode` or `emacs-jupyter` (Sage wiki)
- JupyterLab text editor
- PyCharm
  - Just open SAGE_ROOT as a project
  - [Ask Sage question 39742: Make PyCharm recognise the Sage Python interpreter](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/39742)
  - [Stack Overflow question 47378147: Use PyCharm (or any Windows IDE) to run SageMath scripts](https://stackoverflow.com/q/47378147)
  - [sage-devel discussion, 2017-12: Running Sage from an IDE like PyCharm on Windows](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/iKQY5Em-QpY/discussion)
  - [Ask Sage question 38750: How to use Sage in PyCharm in Ubuntu](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/38750)
- [Spyder](https://wiki.sagemath.org/SpyderInstructions) (Sage wiki)
- Sublime Text
  - [Stack Overflow question 36436785: Syntax highlighting for .sage in sublime](https://stackoverflow.com/q/36436785)
- vi / [vim](https://wiki.sagemath.org/Tips) (Sage wiki)
- VSCode / vscodium - #30484

and maybe others such as

- Alpha, Alphatk
- ATOM + Hydrogen
- Blender
- Eclipse
- Geany 
  - http://wiki.geany.org/config/sage
  - http://docs.huihoo.com/geany/0.16/index.html#filetype-extensions
- IDLE
- Leo
- [Netbeans](https://wiki.sagemath.org/Netbeans) (Sage wiki, 2010)
- PyDev
- PyScripter
- Wing
- Xcode

What to document:

- setting up syntax highlighting for .py, .pyx, .spyx, .sage files
- telling the editor or IDE to use Sage's Python
- making Sage execute fragments of code

Workflow:

- Collect info here on this Meta-ticket
- Migrate good info to the Sage developer guide in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/doc/en/developer/workspace.rst, one ticket per IDE / text editor

Existing material:
- some answers to questions, or discussions,
  on Ask Sage, sage-devel, sage-support, Stack Overflow

Maybe this is better done on the wiki, and the wiki should have
a summary page pointing to a page for each IDE or text editor.

Maybe the part about vim could mention `:set backupcopy=yes` (see #21739) to avoid issues with the attach command (well, it's in my vimrc since 2015, but I don't know if it is still needed).

-1 for wiki - it's unmaintainable

+1 for extending the developer documentation

I agree with this. There are too many moving targets to keep this in the regular documentation, and crowd-sourcing it on the wiki will allow more flexibility. Anyone who is familiar with a particular editor (even including ~~the losers~~ those who use vi instead of emacs) can chime in as needed.
