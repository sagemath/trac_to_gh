To implement #29169, a fast inverse function for matrices known to be symmetric and positive-definite is used. The body of the function for a matrix `M` amounts to,

```
L_inverse = M.cholesky().inverse()
return L_inverse.transpose()*L_inverse
```

Instead, we can add this directly to the Matrix classes. A general method should use the conjugate-transpose (for complex matrices) instead of the plain transpose.

A few thoughts:

1. In sage, `is_positive_definite()` already requires that the matrix be symmetric, so I guess the new method should be called `inverse_positive_definite()` without mention of symmetry.
2. Currently the function fails with an error in `cholesky()` if it is given an asymmetric or indefinite matrix. Presumably this is acceptable even for a matrix method?
3. Should the method be public, or private to begin with?
4. In a perfect world, we would be able to quickly check if the fast inverse could be used in the generic matrix `inverse()` method, so that end users don't need to know about the custom fast inverse. Is this even possible? (I'm not willing to completely overhaul the `inverse()` method to use partial information obtained from a failed cholesky attempt.) Octave provides a separate `cholinv` function which suggests I'm not missing anything obvious.

I've thought about this for a few days and decided to go with a separate method. The two implementations share no code, so ultimately you still wind up with a separate function, but copy/pasted inside of the `inverse` method and guarded by an "if" statement rather than by the user. It's like using `call_function('foo')` to run `foo()`... aesthetically painful, and a tiny bit slower. It would be nice to share the OUTPUT documentation, but then we'd also have to put a bunch of conditionals like "if `algorithm="positive definite"` and if the matrix is not positive-definite,..." into the docstring for `inverse()`. So altogether I think this is cleaner.

If that seriously bothers anyone down the line, the `inverse_positive_definite` method can be made private, and `if algorithm == "positive definite": return self._inverse_positive_definite()` can be added to the top of `inverse()`.
