We added methods to generate the extended Kasami codes and the Kasami codes.
For a definition of those codes see the book "Distance-Regular Graphs" by Brouwer et. al.

Depends on #21226

Also, IIRC they are used to construct certain d.r.g.'s - could you mention which ones?

A minor merge conflict with #21226 - perhaps base this on top of the branch of #21226.

Would be also nice to have it seen by coding theory people - I CCd two.

Structural comments:

- Please reference (also) Kasami's original paper(s): this is more correct and
  is for many academics more easily obtained than Brouwer's book.

- Please add the definition of Kasami codes in the top of the file. The
  definition is short and compact (at least the one given in Brouwer). In
  particular, it should be explicitly mentioned that these are binary codes. They are in fact subfield subcodes of the code having those three equations as parity checks (see also below), so that could be emphasised.

- According to Brouwer, the minimum distance of (extended) Kasami codes is
  always known. Such cases are exactly the motivation for special classes for a
  code family: please override `minimum_distance` to return this number without
  computation.

- Kasami's 1966 technical report is about "weight distributions" of codes. Is
  the entire weight distribution of (extended) Kasami codes known? In that case,
  it would be much nicer to override `weight_distribution` to return this
  without having to go through the whole code (see `grs_code.py` for an
  example). I won't insist, though.

- Whether it's the extended Kasami code or not should perhaps be stored in a
  local parameter instead of matching on the length all the time.

- I'm concerned that the string epresentation of the code is confusing. Normally
  we say "[n, k] linear code" or "[n, k] Generalized Reed-Solomon code" etc.,
  and printing "(s, t) <Extended> Kasami code" may confuse users. Consider
  e.g. printing "[n, k] <Extended> (s, t)-Kasami code".


Code comments:

There are many lines exceeding 80 chars. Is this not still a convention of
SageMath?

`generator_matrix` is much more complicated than it needs to be: Note that the
Kasami code is a subfield subcode of a code with 3 parity checks over `GF(s)`.
Here is a few lines of code which produces a generator matrix for the Kasami
code:

```
s = 8
t = 4
n = s
F = GF(s)
Cext = codes.from_parity_check_matrix(matrix(F, 3, n,
                                      [[1]*n,
                                       F.list(),
                                       [ a^(t+1) for a in F]]))
G = codes.SubfieldSubcode(Cext, GF(2)).generator_matrix()
```

The main disadvantage is that this currently emits a warning, because
#24279 is still not merged. Perhaps this is a good motivation to finish up that
ticket, and use the shorter, more mathematical code for Kasami codes?

Of course, it would be very nice to close #24279 and subsequent tickets but I would let this for another time since I'm not sure it will be an easy job.
Indeed, notice that #21413 is now ready (and merged!) and that several people (including possibly myself at some point) are working on implementing relative finite fields extensions in #28485, which could be a (better?) alternative to #24279.

<div id="comment:20" align="right">comment:20</div>

Thanks for the feedback, I'm now working on fixing all point raised.
I have little knowledge of coding theory but I need the Kasami codes for a later ticket.

I referenced the Kasami's papers which are quoted by Brouwer and Wikipedia, but I don't see how these relates to these codes.

Brouwer does not provide a proof for the minimum distances stated and I believe they are wrong.
For instance:
1.  the extended Kasami code (4,2) is empty, so I'm not sure how the minimum distance is defined;
2. the extended Kasami code (8,2) has only 2 vectors (zero vector and one vector), so has minimum distance 8 not 6 as stated by Brouwer.

I have no idea if the weight distribution of these codes is known.

As far as the generator matrix is concerned, I'm happy that there is a quicker way to compute it.
I'll try to expand what suggested by @johanrosenkilde to something that doesn't emit any warning.
