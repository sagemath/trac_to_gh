Keywords: polytope, combinatorialpolyhedron, is_pyramid

The method `is_pyramid` of `CombinatorialPolyhedron` returns a wrong certificate:

```
sage: Polyhedron([[0, -1, -1], [0, -1, 1], [0, 1, -1], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0]]).is_pyramid(certificate=True)
(True, A vertex at (0, -1, -1))
```

This bug introduced in #29189; the indexing in `_face_iter(True, 0)` is different from the indexing in `Vrepresentation`.
