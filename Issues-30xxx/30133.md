The Giac interface needs to be more careful when handling symbolic variables that are also mathematical constants:

```
sage: var('I')._giac_()._sage_()^2  # should be I^2
-1
sage: var('e')._giac_()._sage_().n()  # should not evaluate
2.71828182845905
sage: var('π')._giac_()._sage_().n()  # should not evaluate
3.14159265358979
```

```
sage: e, x = var('e,x')
sage: integrate(e^x, x, algorithm='maxima')  # correct
e^x/log(e)
sage: integrate(e^x, x, algorithm='giac')  # wrong
e^x
```

```
sage: y = var('π')
sage: integrate(cos(y), y, algorithm='maxima')  # correct (after ticket 30112)
sin(π)
sage: integrate(cos(y), y, algorithm='giac')  # wrong
-pi
```

This also came up in this [ask-sage question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/57442).

To avoid this conflict, this ticket changes the names of the internal variables in the Giac interface, which mirrors the behavior of the Maxima interface.

```
sage: giac(SR.var('e'))
sageVARe
sage: _.sage()
e
```

In Python 3, utf-8 encoding is [the default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14083111/should-i-use-encoding-declaration-in-python-3), so this line is not needed.

I have fixed the pyflakes warning, though.
