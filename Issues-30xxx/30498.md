```
Libgap object hash function is not compatible with !Python/Sage

```
sage: hash(2)
2
sage: hash(libgap(2))
4749963527729243378
```
As a consequence

```
sage: set([libgap(2)]) == set([2])
False
```

Note that the implementation of `__hash__` is not very subtle `hash(str(self))` and could easily be modified to handle properly
integers and rationals.

Good point! But I would prefer to fix the various interfaces with various tickets. In particular for pari, the hash comes from `cypari2` and is implemented using a C function from the PARI libaray. It is not on Sage side. The specificity of the libgap interface is that it is using `hash(str(self))` which can easily adapted to match Sage on integers/rationals.

The python spec has no such requirement, which means that generally, objects for different class/type should compare unequal.

In sage, our equality is too liberal to combine useful hashes with keeping to this strict rule:

```
sage: 2 == GF(3)(2) == 5
True
```
so we're already forced to be pragmatic about it. Within the same parent, I think we do want it to hold -- otherwise you're better off making the objects not hashable. Outside of that, we can do a reasonable effort, but things will break eventually. People will have to learn that in Sage, you need to normalize your keys prior to putting them in a dictionary, and what that means depends on your application. It will generally mean forcing all the keys into the same parent. It's important to keep hashes cheap too!
