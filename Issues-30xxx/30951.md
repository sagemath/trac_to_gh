On this ticket, we simplify the code for portability testing using the new options of `sage -package list` introduced in #30865.

The simplifications to `build/bin/write-dockerfile.sh` are similar to those done in #30947 for `src/doc/bootstrap`.

The changes to `tox.ini` are to redefine the package configurations `-minimal`, `-standard`, `-maximal` using a variable `SAGE_PACKAGE_LIST_ARGS` - which is passed to `sage -package list` to obtain a list of packages.  (For `-minimal`, we use `SAGE_PACKAGE_LIST_ARGS=_prereq`, which produces the empty package list; `_prereq` is in anticipation of #29124, which creates a script package by this name.)

To test, use for example

```
    tox -e docker-archlinux-minimal -- config.status
    tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-standard -- config.status
    tox -e docker-fedora-32-maximal -- config.status
```

probably it has nothing to do with the current ticket, but the error stays after `make doc-clean`. Is there a new way of cleaning the documentation?
