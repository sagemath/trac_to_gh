Currently we have `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK([sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi], ...)`, which causes system python3 to be rejected on many systems.

We should review whether this can be made more fine-grained.

`SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK` is specifically for checking whether we are going to install a shared library that may interfere with a system-provided version of the same shared library that the package is linked against.

**Package `sqlite`** - done in #30559

**Package `libpng`** is taken care of in #31009

Here we follow up to address the following dependencies:

**Package `bzip2`**......

```
$ grep bzip2 build/pkgs/*/dependencies
build/pkgs/cbc/dependencies:readline zlib bzip2 $(BLAS)
build/pkgs/cmake/dependencies:curl zlib bzip2 xz
build/pkgs/freetype/dependencies:libpng bzip2
build/pkgs/pcre/dependencies:bzip2
build/pkgs/python3/dependencies:zlib readline sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi
build/pkgs/r/dependencies:$(BLAS) gfortran iconv readline bzip2 xz pcre curl | pkgconf
```

**Package `xz`** represents both the shared library `liblzma` and the `xz` binary.  #30948

**Package `libffi`**....

```
$ grep libffi build/pkgs/*/dependencies
build/pkgs/ecl/dependencies:$(MP_LIBRARY) readline gc libffi
build/pkgs/python3/dependencies:zlib readline sqlite libpng bzip2 xz libffi
```
