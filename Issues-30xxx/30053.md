This breaks building sphinx on windows.

https://github.com/kliem/sage/runs/838933940

Same error as #30008.

As far as I understand the problem is that we need some sort of UTF to make the sphinx build work.
It appears that on `cygwin` the default is better than `C` and `C.UTF-8` does not work.
So maybe `C` is not the best alternative for `C.UTF-8`.

Btw, strangely centos 7 appears to work with the current beta. I don't know what happened. (And I don't know yet, if this behavior is stable).

I'm not sure what you mean here.  `C.UTF-8` is supported on Cygwin and is in fact the default locale in absence of any other settings: https://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-locale.html

> The default locale in the absence of the aforementioned locale environment variables is "C.UTF-8".

I am not sure if this is related, but while compiling Cypari on macOS, every file gives a warning of this type:

```
     Colperl: warning: Setting locale failed.
    perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
        LC_ALL = "C.UTF-8",

The fallback that is used seems to work for me, though.

How about only doing this `export LC_...=` on Python3.x with x<7 ?
This should in particular make Arch people (apparently Arch has no C.UTF-8 or a similar locale,
everything UTF-8 there is language-specific) happy, as their Python is new enough.

Better diagnostics for non-compliant systems would be great but imho not a blocker.\n\nThese systems do support UTF-8, but not the (as of yet) non-standard `C.UTF-8` locale.\n\nThe current branch has the right idea, but since python-3.6 and python-3.7 act differently, it can be made a bit more precise. With python-3.7+, we can set `LC_ALL=C` and let python do the guessing. (Maybe it doesn't succeed, but officially Not Our Problem at that point.) With python-3.6, we can check for the `C.UTF-8` locale and set it when found, with a fallback to `LC_ALL=C`.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment:40):
> Sage-the-python-library can't realistically support anything that CPython does not; Its 2020, who in their right mind doesn't support utf-8? Better diagnostics for non-compliant systems would be great but imho not a blocker.

These systems do support UTF-8, but not the (as of yet) non-standard `C.UTF-8` locale.

The current branch has the right idea, but since python-3.6 and python-3.7 act differently, it can be made a bit more precise. With python-3.7+, we can set `LC_ALL=C` and let python do the guessing. (Maybe it doesn't succeed, but officially Not Our Problem at that point.) With python-3.6, we can check for the `C.UTF-8` locale and set it when found, with a fallback to `LC_ALL=C`. The current branch does this unconditionally but, it should only do it for python-3.6 and we should check the other equivalent names `C.utf8` and `UTF-8` too.

I think it's worthwhile to not output a million scary error messages in the sage-9.2 release on these systems that have done nothing wrong.

That is we are opening the `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` file as a `bytes` type, and at some place (where?), we decode the bytes to ascii and then we get `UnicodeDecodeError` because it is not ascii at all. Here is a way to reproduce the same error message:\n\n```\nsage: with open('src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst', 'rb') as f: b = f.read()                \nsage: b.decode('ascii')                                                                              \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnicodeDecodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-13-498050d5a3fb> in <module>\n----> 1 b.decode('ascii')\n\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 2661: ordinal not in range(128)\nsage: s = b.decode('utf-8') \n```\nI am adding Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric in cc since he fixed a lot of those `UnicodeDecodeError` in recent times with the passage to Python 3.\n\nAlso, why this works in Python3.8 and not in Python3.6 ?",

<div id="comment:53" align="right">comment:53</div>

To me, it seems like an error of the following kind. That is we are opening the `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` file as a `bytes` type, and at some place (where?), we decode the bytes to ascii and then we get `UnicodeDecodeError` because it is not ascii at all. Here is a way to reproduce the same error message:

```
sage: with open('src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst', 'rb') as f: b = f.read()                
sage: b.decode('ascii')                                                                              
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
UnicodeDecodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-13-498050d5a3fb> in <module>
----> 1 b.decode('ascii')

UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 2661: ordinal not in range(128)
sage: s = b.decode('utf-8') 
```
I am adding Frédéric in cc since he fixed a lot of those `UnicodeDecodeError` in recent times with the passage to Python 3.

Also, why this works in Python3.8 and not in Python3.6 ?

According to POSIX, a program which has not called setlocale(LC_ALL, '') runs using the 
portable 'C' locale. Calling setlocale(LC_ALL, '') lets it use the default locale as defined by the LANG variable. Since we do not want to interfere with the current locale setting we thus emulate the behavior in the way described above.

there are also many more missing `encoding='utf-8'` in `open()` on source files in the docbuilder.

and perhaps on other text files too. all these lead to these `UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte...`

Should we just abandon the idea to support random system Python 3.6, they are just broken in this way...

I am giving up on this. I think the code is too new for Python 3.6, and I don't think we should invest time in a version that will be EOL by the end of 2021.

On python >= 3.7, `LC_ALL=C` is sufficient, because python itself will attempt to find a UTF-8 version of that locale.

(It may be only a semantic difference, but then the non-existence of `C.UTF-8` on some systems becomes Not Our Problem.)

Yes, if we're going to throw python-3.6 under the bus in this release.

`LC_ALL=C` is the standard choice, and python >= 3.7 already treat `LC_ALL=C` magically. That's what "PEP 538 -- Coercing the legacy C locale to a UTF-8 based locale" is about.

Let's refocus this ticket (blocker for Sage 9.2) on solving the issues for Python 3.7+

To me Python 3.6 support is a "wishlist" item, but not a blocker. I have created a separate ticket for it: #30576

None, but AFAIK there were none before we started messing with the locale, either.

If no one is going to fix the python-3.6 problems, we should just drop it from the list of supported system pythons and revert this to `LC_ALL=C`. That's simpler and leaves us with one fewer locale problem to debug in the future.

The stuff on ticket #30576 isn't what I was referring to...


Replying to [@dimpase](#comment:77):
> there is no harm in adding this, anyway, thus, over to bots.

The harm is that now we have additional locale problems to debug for a change that doesn't solve anything. With python-3.7, there are now three different configurations:

* The `C.UTF-8` locale exists and is used.
* No utf8 locale exists, so `C` is used.
* A utf8 locale is available, but your grep doesn't find it, so we wind up with `C` on a machine that could have a utf8 locale.

Why, when `LC_ALL=C` unconditionally works fine and had been in there for ages?

*If* someone wants to fix python-3.6, we should add these hacks only for python-3.6, and we should try the alternate names `C.utf8` and `UTF-8`, too.
