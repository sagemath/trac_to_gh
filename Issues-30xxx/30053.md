an easy way out is just to check whether the locale change worked, and if not, use `C` locale, not `C.UTF-8`. Perhaps print a warning.

Is this a github issue or have we broken sage?

This breaks building sphinx on windows.

https://github.com/kliem/sage/runs/838933940

Same error as #30008.

As far as I understand the problem is that we need some sort of UTF to make the sphinx build work.
It appears that on `cygwin` the default is better than `C` and `C.UTF-8` does not work.
So maybe `C` is not the best alternative for `C.UTF-8`.

Btw, strangely centos 7 appears to work with the current beta. I don't know what happened. (And I don't know yet, if this behavior is stable).

I'm not sure what you mean here.  `C.UTF-8` is supported on Cygwin and is in fact the default locale in absence of any other settings: https://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-locale.html

> The default locale in the absence of the aforementioned locale environment variables is "C.UTF-8".

could it be that `locale` on Cygwin is not installed by default?

However, https://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-locale.html says:

```

I am not sure if this is related, but while compiling Cypari on macOS, every file gives a warning of this type:

```
     Colperl: warning: Setting locale failed.
    perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
        LC_ALL = "C.UTF-8",

The fallback that is used seems to work for me, though.

How about only doing this `export LC_...=` on Python3.x with x<7 ?
This should in particular make Arch people (apparently Arch has no C.UTF-8 or a similar locale,
everything UTF-8 there is language-specific) happy, as their Python is new enough.

With python-3.7+, we can set `LC_ALL=C` and let python do the guessing. (Maybe it doesn't succeed, but officially Not Our Problem at that point.) With python-3.6, we can check for the `C.UTF-8` locale and set it when found, with a fallback to `LC_ALL=C`. The current branch does this unconditionally but, it should only do it for python-3.6 and we should check the other equivalent names `C.utf8` and `UTF-8` too.\n\nI think it's worthwhile to not output a million scary error messages in the sage-9.2 release on these systems that have done nothing wrong. At the very least, we owe it to the Arch maintainers who do a lot for sage and would have to field the resulting bug reports (or patch this themselves). I'm sure there are BSDs where this is problematic too.",

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A40):
> Sage-the-python-library can't realistically support anything that CPython does not; Its 2020, who in their right mind doesn't support utf-8? Better diagnostics for non-compliant systems would be great but imho not a blocker.

These systems do support UTF-8, but not the (as of yet) non-standard `C.UTF-8` locale.

The current branch has the right idea, but since python-3.6 and python-3.7 act differently, it can be made a bit more precise. With python-3.7+, we can set `LC_ALL=C` and let python do the guessing. (Maybe it doesn't succeed, but officially Not Our Problem at that point.) With python-3.6, we can check for the `C.UTF-8` locale and set it when found, with a fallback to `LC_ALL=C`. The current branch does this unconditionally but, it should only do it for python-3.6 and we should check the other equivalent names `C.utf8` and `UTF-8` too.

I think it's worthwhile to not output a million scary error messages in the sage-9.2 release on these systems that have done nothing wrong. At the very least, we owe it to the Arch maintainers who do a lot for sage and would have to field the resulting bug reports (or patch this themselves). I'm sure there are BSDs where this is problematic too.

The character `–` has many occurrences in that file and is possibly not the only occurrence of a nonascii character (for example names of authors...). So, I am not sure replacing them by `--` is the correct fix. And I don't see how this is related at all with the `C.UTF-8` configuration.

That is we are opening the `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` file as a `bytes` type, and at some place (where?), we decode the bytes to ascii and then we get `UnicodeDecodeError` because it is not ascii at all. Here is a way to reproduce the same error message:

```
sage: with open('src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst', 'rb') as f: b = f.read()                
sage: b.decode('ascii')                                                                              
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
UnicodeDecodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-13-498050d5a3fb> in <module>
----> 1 b.decode('ascii')

UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 2661: ordinal not in range(128)
sage: s = b.decode('utf-8') 
```
I am adding Frédéric in cc since he fixed a lot of those `UnicodeDecodeError` in recent times with the passage to Python 3.

Also, why this works in Python3.8 and not in Python3.6 ?

According to POSIX, a program which has not called setlocale(LC_ALL, '') runs using the 
portable 'C' locale. Calling setlocale(LC_ALL, '') lets it use the default locale as defined by the LANG variable. Since we do not want to interfere with the current locale setting we thus emulate the behavior in the way described above.

there are also many more missing `encoding='utf-8'` in `open()` on source files in the docbuilder.

and perhaps on other text files too. all these lead to these `UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte...`

Should we just abandon the idea to support random system Python 3.6, they are just broken in this way...

I am giving up on this. I think the code is too new for Python 3.6, and I don't think we should invest time in a version that will be EOL by the end of 2021. 

People who only have Python 3.6 can build Python.

On python >= 3.7, `LC_ALL=C` is sufficient, because python itself will attempt to find a UTF-8 version of that locale.

(It may be only a semantic difference, but then the non-existence of `C.UTF-8` on some systems becomes Not Our Problem.)

Yes, if we're going to throw python-3.6 under the bus in this release.

`LC_ALL=C` is the standard choice, and python >= 3.7 already treat `LC_ALL=C` magically. That's what "PEP 538 -- Coercing the legacy C locale to a UTF-8 based locale" is about.

what are the 3.7+ problems left here?
I presume all of them have plain C locale, so it all should work, no?

None, but AFAIK there were none before we started messing with the locale, either.

If no one is going to fix the python-3.6 problems, we should just drop it from the list of supported system pythons and revert this to `LC_ALL=C`. That's simpler and leaves us with one fewer locale problem to debug in the future.

The stuff on ticket #30576 isn't what I was referring to...


Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A77):
> there is no harm in adding this, anyway, thus, over to bots.

The harm is that now we have additional locale problems to debug for a change that doesn't solve anything. With python-3.7, there are now three different configurations:

* The `C.UTF-8` locale exists and is used.
* No utf8 locale exists, so `C` is used.
* A utf8 locale is available, but your grep doesn't find it, so we wind up with `C` on a machine that could have a utf8 locale.

Why, when `LC_ALL=C` unconditionally works fine and had been in there for ages?

*If* someone wants to fix python-3.6, we should add these hacks only for python-3.6, and we should try the alternate names `C.utf8` and `UTF-8`, too.
