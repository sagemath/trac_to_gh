<a id='comment:12'></a>This breaks building sphinx on windows.

https://github.com/kliem/sage/runs/838933940

Same error as #30008.

As far as I understand the problem is that we need some sort of UTF to make the sphinx build work.
It appears that on `cygwin` the default is better than `C` and `C.UTF-8` does not work.
So maybe `C` is not the best alternative for `C.UTF-8`.

Btw, strangely centos 7 appears to work with the current beta. I don't know what happened. (And I don't know yet, if this behavior is stable).

I'm not sure what you mean here.  `C.UTF-8` is supported on Cygwin and is in fact the default locale in absence of any other settings: https://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-locale.html

> The default locale in the absence of the aforementioned locale environment variables is "C.UTF-8".

How about only doing this `export LC_...=` on Python3.x with x<7 ?
This should in particular make Arch people (apparently Arch has no C.UTF-8 or a similar locale,
everything UTF-8 there is language-specific) happy, as their Python is new enough.

I think a combination of this and the current branch is the best we can do. On python-3.6, we should try to set `LC_ALL` to `C.UTF-8`, `C.utf8`, or `UTF-8`. If we can't, then we should leave it alone and pray that the user's locale is compatible with all of our SPKGs. That situation would be unsupported by sage.

On python-3.7+, we can set `LC_ALL=C`, and python itself will try to pick an appropriate UTF-8 version of the locale. What does python on arch do in this situation? It's possible that python itself will fail to find a suitable UTF-8 locale, but there's not a lot we can do if upstream python insists on a nonstandard locale.

<a id='comment:58'></a>there are also many more missing `encoding='utf-8'` in `open()` on source files in the docbuilder.

and perhaps on other text files too. all these lead to these `UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte...`

Should we just abandon the idea to support random system Python 3.6, they are just broken in this way...

But indeed, I see that adding a `encoding='utf-8'` at this place is not sufficient.

Yes, if we're going to throw python-3.6 under the bus in this release.

`LC_ALL=C` is the standard choice, and python >= 3.7 already treat `LC_ALL=C` magically. That's what "PEP 538 -- Coercing the legacy C locale to a UTF-8 based locale" is about.

None, but AFAIK there were none before we started messing with the locale, either.

If no one is going to fix the python-3.6 problems, we should just drop it from the list of supported system pythons and revert this to `LC_ALL=C`. That's simpler and leaves us with one fewer locale problem to debug in the future.

The stuff on ticket #30576 isn't what I was referring to...


Replying to [dimpase](#comment%3A77):
> there is no harm in adding this, anyway, thus, over to bots.


The harm is that now we have additional locale problems to debug for a change that doesn't solve anything. With python-3.7, there are now three different configurations:

* The `C.UTF-8` locale exists and is used.
* No utf8 locale exists, so `C` is used.
* A utf8 locale is available, but your grep doesn't find it, so we wind up with `C` on a machine that could have a utf8 locale.

Why, when `LC_ALL=C` unconditionally works fine and had been in there for ages?

*If* someone wants to fix python-3.6, we should add these hacks only for python-3.6, and we should try the alternate names `C.utf8` and `UTF-8`, too.
