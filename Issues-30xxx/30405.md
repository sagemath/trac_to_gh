Function to efficiently compute the antipodal graph with low memory usage.

Following the discussion in #30394 a sketch algorithm is

```
def antipodal_graph(G):
    """
    Return the antipodal graph of ``G``.
    """
    ecc = G.eccentricity(algorithm="DHV", with_labels=True)
    diam = max(ecc.values())
    # Get the list of antipodal vertices, i.e., with eccentricity = diameter
    V = [u for u, ecc_u in ecc.items() if ecc_u == diam]

    E = set()
    for u in V:
        for v, d in G.breadth_first_search(u, report_distance=True):
            if d == diam:
                E.add(frozenset((u, v)))

    name = f"antipodal graph of {G.name()}"
    return Graph([G, E], format='vertices_and_edges', name=name)
```

Roughly, to be efficient, it must be implemented using `short_digraph` in `distances_all_pairs.pyx`, and call low level methods.

A first task is to modify diameter/radius/eccentricity methods to take as input a `short_digraph`, and so avoid extra conversions from one format to the other. That is, the C level methods should use C only.

I have improved what you did and add method for constructing the antipodal_graph.
So far it is not exposed in `Graph`. To do so, we should rebuild over #30394 and replace the basic method of #30394 by an import from this new method.
