<a id='comment:16'></a>While reviewing #29124, I see an issue, but it seems related to this ticket instead.

When I run `tox -e docker-archlinux-minimal -- config.status`, the command finishes with
` docker-archlinux-minimal: commands succeeded congratulations :)`, but some red lines showing `sage: command not found` related to file `src/doc/bootstrap` are printed in the process:

```

Below is the same part of the log on top of 9.3.beta3 which do not have the `sage command not found` issue:

The trac merger is configured to be a bit pickier than default git, it seems. 
I've merged the beta and pushed it to the ticket.
