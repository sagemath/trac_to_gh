(from #30580):

`src/sage_setup/command/sage_build_cython.py` contains this code:

```
# Work around GCC-4.8 bug which miscompiles some sig_on() statements:
# * http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14460
# * http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/20226
# * http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56982
if subprocess.call("""$CC --version | grep -i 'gcc.* 4[.]8' >/dev/null """, shell=True) == 0:
    extra_compile_args.append('-fno-tree-copyrename')
```
This gives an (ignored) error when `CC` is not set -- which can happen if invoked outside of `sage-env`, for example when building an sdist.

```
$ python3 -u setup.py --no-user-cfg sdist >/tmp/res
/bin/sh: 1: --version: not found
```

We remove this code, which is obsolete after #33316 (Drop support for GCC < 6.3 in Sage 9.7)

What does happen if CC is not set, how is setup.py getting the compilers to use? Via distutils?
Can't CC be set in setup.py if needed?

it looks doable, but ugly as hell:

```python
from distutils.ccompiler import new_compiler, get_default_compiler
new_compiler(get_default_compiler()).compile(["foo.c"])
```
and then 

```bash
$ strings hello.o | grep GCC
GCC: (Gentoo 8.3.1-r2 p4) 8.3.1 20190518
```
allows version extraction.

Wouldn't it be easier to, e.g., parse the banner of Python?

We already reject gcc-4.7 and older in `spkg-configure.m4`. Would anyone notice if we rejected 4.8 (May, 2014) as well?

And if we do want to continue supporting gcc-4.8 from the system, couldn't we append `-fno-tree-copyrename` to `CFLAGS` to fix this? The optimization is buggy in 4.8.x so I don't think it's unjustified.

Yes, this is the compiler on `ubuntu-trusty` and `centos-7`, which are still widely used.

We are dropping support for a platform with gcc 4.9 (`debian-jessie`) in Sage 9.5 (for #25009) because it turns to be more broken than 4.8.

Same story with Ubuntu, more or less.

We can and should drop gcc 4, without dropping OSs.
