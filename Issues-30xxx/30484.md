We already have a basic VS Code configuration; #33103 makes some minor updates.

In this ticket, we add documentation for installing VS Code on Windows and setting up the WSL remote, as the primary way how to use Sage on Windows. This goes to
- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/launching.html

Next task: cross reference it from the developer's guide and add information there on how to develop Sage on Windows.

There is also the possibility to connect to a "remote" jupyter instance. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_connect-to-a-remote-jupyter-server So if you start sage's jupyter server, you should be able to connect to it in this way.

The question is, how does vscode's jupyter discover kernels? Where?
What should be set?

I am new to the Visual Studio Code interface to the sagemath installed in WSL.

I followed the guide of the branch of this ticket. It mostly worked.

But in the first attempt, I could not select [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) kernel in the jupyter notebook. It was simply missing.

I wandered around for some time, and then found Jupyter Extension in the Extensions panel. I installed it, and did the ":Create: New Jupyter Notebook" thing again. Then I could finally select [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) kernel. 

So it seems that there is a missing step in the guide: "Install Jupyter Extension"

Anyway, this VSCode interface to sage is very nice!

Still it was not straightforward for me to setup the working jupyter notebook with sagemath kernel starting from building sage from source in WSL.
