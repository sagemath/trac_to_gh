Currently, taking cartesian products forgets about the category of metric spaces. Example:

```
sage: UHP = HyperbolicPlane().UHP()
sage: UHP
Hyperbolic plane in the Upper Half Plane Model
sage: UHP.categories()
[Category of hyperbolic models of Hyperbolic plane,
 Category of realizations of Hyperbolic plane,
 Category of realizations of sets,
 Category of metric spaces,
 Category of topological spaces,
 Category of sets,
 Category of sets with partial maps,
 Category of objects]

sage: UHP2 = UHP.cartesian_product(UHP)
sage: UHP2.categories()
[Category of Cartesian products of sets,
 Category of sets,
 Category of sets with partial maps,
 Category of objects]
```

In this ticket, we handle Cartesian products of:
- (complete) metric spaces
- (compact, connected) topological spaces
