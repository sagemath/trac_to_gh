This function does not belong into sagelib. If it is still needed at all, it should become a script in sage-the-distribution.

`install_scripts` is also mentioned in one place in the sage installation guide, `src/doc/en/installation/source.rst`. We update it.

Here's a branch. I removed `hg`, `kash`, and `M2` from the scripts to be installed, since those are not connected to Sage packages anymore. Questions:

- should we remove `from .dist import install_scripts` from `sage.misc.all`?
- `install_scripts` is used in `docker/Dockerfile`. Is this necessary?
