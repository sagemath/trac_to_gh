This function does not belong into sagelib. If it is still needed at all, it should become a script in sage-the-distribution.

`install_scripts` is also mentioned in one place in the sage installation guide, `src/doc/en/installation/source.rst`. We update it.

- should we remove `from .dist import install_scripts` from `sage.misc.all`?
- `install_scripts` is used in `docker/Dockerfile`. Is this necessary?
