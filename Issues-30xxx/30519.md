After the introduction of manifold orientation in #30178, attempting
to get the volume form of a metric on a manifold without any predefined orientation yields a weird error message:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='Riemannian')  # the 2-sphere
sage: U = M.open_subset('U'); V = M.open_subset('V')
sage: M.declare_union(U, V)
sage: c_xy.<x,y> = U.chart() # stereographic coord. from the North pole
sage: c_uv.<u,v> = V.chart() # stereographic coord. from the South pole
sage: xy_to_uv = c_xy.transition_map(c_uv, (x/(x^2+y^2), y/(x^2+y^2)),
....:                intersection_name='W', restrictions1= x^2+y^2!=0,
....:                restrictions2= u^2+v^2!=0)
sage: uv_to_xy = xy_to_uv.inverse()
sage: eU = c_xy.frame(); eV = c_uv.frame()
sage: g = M.metric()
sage: g[eU,0,0], g[eU,1,1] = 4/(1+x^2+y^2)^2, 4/(1+x^2+y^2)^2
sage: g.add_comp_by_continuation(eV, U.intersection(V), chart=c_uv)
sage: g.volume_form()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: list index out of range
```
This surprising error message (which list index?) is due to a bad check for an orientation in `PseudoRiemannianMetric.volume_form()`; the fix is 

```diff
-        if orient is None:
+        if not orient:
```
Indeed, the attribute `_orientation` of manifolds is initialized as `[]`, not as `None`. With the fix, the error message is more expressive:

```
ValueError: 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold M must admit an orientation
```
In addition to the above fix, with a new doctest checking it, this ticket corrects some mistake in the documentation illustrating the choice of an orientation on the 2-sphere in the docstring of class `PseudoRiemannianMetric`: 

```
sage: M.set_orientation([c_xy, c_uv])
```
does not define a valid orientation because the stereographic frames from the North and South poles have opposite orientations, the Jacobian of the transition map `c_xy` --> `c_uv` being negative. It is replaced here by

```
sage: f = U.vector_frame('f', (eU[2], eU[1]))
sage: M.set_orientation([eV, f])
```

Of course, the orientation changes when using stereographic projections! I just haven't thought about it in the first place, thank you for catching this, too.

This is indeed a nice improvement of the documentation as well.

You're welcome. Thanks to you for having introduced orientations on manifolds. They were really missing!

No problem. The error was already there, when the volume form took the same shape, with the same sign, in the two stereographic frames. Same thing in the [S^2 example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_sphere_S2.ipynb), which I am going to correct tomorrow.
