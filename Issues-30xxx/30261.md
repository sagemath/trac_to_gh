Tensor fields, scalar fields, sections and (bundle) connections are a priori mutable. However, according to #30181, it should be possible to make them immutable and in conclusion to make them hashable.

Connections and bundle connections are already hashable even though they are not immutable. This will be changed accordingly in this ticket.

I haven't found any active use of the `Mutability` class in the whole Sage library. For the sake of generality, it would be good to have a class which inherits from `SageObject` and represents a mutable element. This would be good for e.g. connections. Either one adds such a class to `sage.structure.mutability` or, since the aforementioned class is not actively used anywhere, rename it accordingly (like `ElementWithMutability`) and adding an inheritance from `SageObject`. Of course, I would open another ticket for that. Probably, the `ModuleElementWithMutability` should be shifted in that file, too?

There is another issue, I have encountered due to the dependence of #30181. I simply changed the following lines in `sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield`:

```diff
-from sage.structure.element import ModuleElement
+from sage.structure.element import ModuleElementWithMutability

-class TensorField(ModuleElement):
+class TensorField(ModuleElementWithMutability):

-        ModuleElement.__init__(self, parent)
+        super().__init__(parent)
```

and I get the following error message:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: U = M.open_subset('U'); V = M.open_subset('V')
sage: c_xy.<x,y> = U.chart(); c_uv.<u,v> = V.chart()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'tensor_type'

Strong -1 This is a mixin class. Just add it to your inheritance. You don't have any Cython classes, so you can use multiple inheritance without any issues. I don't expect too many cases where having Cython is useful for elements with mutabiliy.

You mean

```diff
-class AffineConnection(SageObject):
+class AffineConnection(SageObject, Mutability):
```

Why is it working in this case? `SageObject` and `Mutability` are both Cython classes. I am a little bit confused...sorry.

Alright, that makes sense.

The inheritance above seems to cause some trouble, I think due to the `__reduce__` method in `Mutability`:

```

It is purely an implementation issue trying to keep immutable objects immutable under pickling. I might argue that the `Mutability` should not have a `__reduce__`. Although some part of the issue is that you do not handle pickling in `AffineConnection`.",

No. A Cython class cannot inherit from multiple things, but a Python class (as you have here) can. The classes it inherits from can both be Cython classes.

Yes, but not because it does not inherit from `SageObject`. It is purely an implementation issue trying to keep immutable objects immutable under pickling. I might argue that the `Mutability` should not have a `__reduce__`. Although some part of the issue is that you do not handle pickling in `AffineConnection`.

I'm confused because `SageObject` and `Mutability` both add methods and

```diff
-class FreeModuleTensor(ModuleElement):
+class FreeModuleTensor(ModuleElement, Mutability):
```

won't work. What is the difference? Is it because `ModuleElement` already is inherited?

> Yes, but not because it does not inherit from `SageObject`. It is purely an implementation issue trying to keep immutable objects immutable under pickling.

Mh. Should I then overload `__reduce__` or add `set_immutable()` etc. manually? Unfortunately, I don't know much about pickling.

Won't work how? The difference with what? The pickling/`__reduce__` issue is because of the implementation of `Mutability`, not a Python/Cython issue. I need something more precise here.

You should overload `__reduce__`. Although I am not sure I agree with the `Mutability` having a `__reduce__` method (or at least once like that; seems counterproductive).

Would you agree if I remove `__reduce__` from `Mutability`?

> Won't work how? The difference with what? 


My example above raises a type error while doctesting:

```
TypeError: multiple bases have instance lay-out conflict
```

Wasn't that the original intention to write a dedicated `ModuleElementWithMutability` class? However, due to your argument, at least if I understand it correctly, this should work.

There is a technical reason with incompatible slots in the Cython classes. However, this was not the original intent of this class. The reason is Sage vectors are Cython classes, not Python classes, which only have single inheritance. So they cannot have mixin classes. All of this is done to optimize them because linear algebra needs to be fast.
