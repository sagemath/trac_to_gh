<a id='comment:2'></a>The test never should have been added in #27749 in the first place. It's an upstream bug. Now this test is copy/pasted in THREE places:

* The upstream test suite
* The sage test suite
* spkg-configure.m4 for the affected package

Are we going to do this three times for every bug in every math library?
