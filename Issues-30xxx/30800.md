The test never should have been added in #27749 in the first place. It's an upstream bug. Now this test is copy/pasted in THREE places:

* The upstream test suite
* The sage test suite
* spkg-configure.m4 for the affected package

Are we going to do this three times for every bug in every math library?

We probably could have just as well checked the version of pari...
