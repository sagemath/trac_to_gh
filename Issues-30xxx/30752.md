}
```
currently the default mp library is mpir: the default `--with-mp` is `system`, and in
`build/pkgs/mpir/spkg-configure.m4` we have

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE([mpir], [
dnl Implement cases for what to do on different options here
    case "$with_mp" in
        system)
            AC_CHECK_HEADER(gmp.h, [], [sage_spkg_install_mpir=yes])
...

dnl Set SAGE_MP_LIBRARY depending on the with_mp option
    case "$with_mp" in
    mpir|system)
        SAGE_MP_LIBRARY=mpir
        ;;
    gmp)
        SAGE_MP_LIBRARY=gmp
```

as `mpir` is getting more and more bitrotten, this should be switched to `gmp` as the default.

Also, 

```
  --with-mp=system        use the system GMP as multiprecision library, if
                          possible (default)
```
is a lie, as can be seen from above, the default is `mpir`, not `gmp`.

this round of GH actions looks better, several "minimal" jobs completed successfully.
These that failed (e.g. ubunuty-trusty) seemed to have failed for an unrelated reason.

I don't know where to find  full untruncated logs, such as install.log for e.g. 
docker (ubuntu-trusty, minimal).
"last whatever lines" do not show the real error.

OK, thanks for pointing to the right direction. In this case the error is about a giac header,
as can be seen in `logs/pkgs/sagelib-9.3.beta1.log`

Looks as if `-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include` is missing in CFLAGS, or something like this.
Nothing to do with the branch on this ticket, anyway.
