adjust documentation of Sage and git-trac to use https rather than git.

remove git_trac spkg, as the upstream should be used directly instead, and
as our version is long obsolete.

Sage can install  git-trac as its optional package.
This ticket updates git-trac, so I thought it should update the optional package too.
However, the optional package looks abandoned, last touched in 2016.

Let's remove it here, it seems to be an oversight that it's not done years ago.

If a hacker got control over e.g. the router, he could manipulate the cloned source code to include malware that gets executed once you build sagemath.
This is an unacceptable security vulnerability that needs to be fixed by either using https or ssh.

yes, I know, I have admin rights for the host running trac.sagemath.org, and setting https access seems to be a tricky task. I can't seem to be able to find a guide on how to do this, although I didn't try too hard. The Git Book only talks about http, not https.

I don't see how this could be useful.
A typical bot would be, say, a host running [GitHub](GitHub) Actions task, and the problem of distributing the keys seems to be a rather tricky one. Indeed, we do not have a way to have a read-only access rights, and so uploading an ssh key-pair to a random host does breach our security just as well.

Why does uploading an ssh key to a random host breach your security? Its a public key, its meant to be public. If you don't like hard-coded keys, and you can't manage to activate https on the git server, you could make a https site with the correct public ssh fingerprints. Then we could download the key using https and add them into the known_hosts file. If you don't like editing the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, git clone can pass options to ssh and ssh has an option to use a different known_hosts file.

The only alternative I see is enabling https or switching from trac to a software that supports https.

no, the bot needs a key-pair to be able to pull via ssh, just as a normal user needs a key-pair.
Giving a pre-existing key-pair to the bot is not secure, and certainly a bot cannot generate a key-pair and upload the public key.

If I set the correct public key in my .ssh/known_hosts file, I can just execute git clone git`@`trac.sagemath.org:sage.git
I don't know why the bot should not be able to do that.

isn't it working because you have ssh-agent running, and your public key is already on trac?
IMHO git via ssh always does ssh authentication, even `git clone` - although I might be wrong here.

Now committing to git trac goes to  there, too. E.g. here is what I saw as I pushed the last commit:

```

the only drawback is that it's a bit slow (we can think for doing pushing to [GitHub](GitHub) in the background).

on github we now only have a repo with develop and master branches (and all the tags for betas/rcs, starting from 8.5.beta1)

the gitlab repo used on this ticket is a true push mirror, carrying all the branches, and only behind the git trac server by seconds.
(and as git trac does not allow https access, we use the gitlab repo, which does allow https)

Right now we have:

```
$ git remote -v
origin	https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/tracmirror.git (fetch)
origin	https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/tracmirror.git (push)
```

I agree. It seems that the current active upstream is at https://github.com/freetdi/tdlib
and the old servers are long gone.
(email is obsolete too, the current affiliation of Larisch appears to be KAUST:
https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/cs/people/person/lukas-larisch)

I'll fix this.
