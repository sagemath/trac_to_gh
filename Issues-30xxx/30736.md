Sage can install  git-trac as its optional package.
This ticket updates git-trac, so I thought it should update the optional package too.
However, the optional package looks abandoned, last touched in 2016.

Let's remove it here, it seems to be an oversight that it's not done years ago.

The problem with using git clone git://trac.sagemath.org/sage.git is that it does not check whether the cloned source code actually originates from sagemath.org.
If a hacker got control over e.g. the router, he could manipulate the cloned source code to include malware that gets executed once you build sagemath.
This is an unacceptable security vulnerability that needs to be fixed by either using https or ssh.

I tried https://trac.sagemath.org/sage.git, but this is not supported from server-site.
I don't see the problem with having git clone git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git . A bot could do that, but maybe it would require setting the correct ssh fingerprint like in my other PR:

yes, I know, I have admin rights for the host running trac.sagemath.org, and setting https access seems to be a tricky task. I can't seem to be able to find a guide on how to do this, although I didn't try too hard. The Git Book only talks about http, not https.

A typical bot would be, say, a host running [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) Actions task, and the problem of distributing the keys seems to be a rather tricky one. Indeed, we do not have a way to have a read-only access rights, and so uploading an ssh key-pair to a random host does breach our security just as well.

Why does uploading an ssh key to a random host breach your security? Its a public key, its meant to be public. If you don't like hard-coded keys, and you can't manage to activate https on the git server, you could make a https site with the correct public ssh fingerprints. Then we could download the key using https and add them into the known_hosts file. If you don't like editing the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, git clone can pass options to ssh and ssh has an option to use a different known_hosts file.

The only alternative I see is enabling https or switching from trac to a software that supports https.

no, the bot needs a key-pair to be able to pull via ssh, just as a normal user needs a key-pair.
Giving a pre-existing key-pair to the bot is not secure, and certainly a bot cannot generate a key-pair and upload the public key.

I've set up a post-commit hook on trac so that everything pushed gets immediatelly mirrored to https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror - from which one can pull with https:.
So in the scripts one can replace trac with github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror

If I set the correct public key in my .ssh/known_hosts file, I can just execute git clone git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git
I don't know why the bot should not be able to do that.

isn't it working because you have ssh-agent running, and your public key is already on trac?
IMHO git via ssh always does ssh authentication, even `git clone` - although I might be wrong here.

Oh no, that's not good, I didn't knew that.

I suppose we can get away with github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror.git repo (which does allow https) for all the Docker-related stuff and CI.
Now committing to git trac goes to  there, too. E.g. here is what I saw as I pushed the last commit:

```
$ git push trac HEAD
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 308 bytes | 308.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Trac #30736: Commit changed to b69a57.
remote: To git@github.com:sagemath/sagetrac-mirror.git
remote:    c28adef..b69a573  u/dimpase/replacing_insecure_git____with_secure_https___ -> u/dimpase/replacing_insecure_git____with_secure_https___
To trac.sagemath.org:sage.git
   c28adeff5b..b69a573ec4  HEAD -> u/dimpase/replacing_insecure_git____with_secure_https___
```

the only drawback is that it's a bit slow (we can think for doing pushing to [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) in the background).

I broke the github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror.git while playing with the commit hook, removed it, and for some reason cannot re-create it on github - looks like a github problem, direct pushing from trac server of a 300Mb repo with lots of refs ends with weird

```
...

! [remote failure]  9.2.rc0 -> 9.2.rc0 (remote failed to report status)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:sagemath/sagetrac-mirror.git'
```
If you have time please feel free to play with this (in your own [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) repo, you can always transfer the ownership later): clone the trac repo with --mirror option, then try to push it to [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub).

The ticket is meanwhile good to go, as the affected by it Docker and script things are currently not in use.

Because you said, that the script is currently not in use, I just disabled it and added a link to this ticket.

I had forgotten about this particular one. This one uses `make dist`, which leads to the use of `SAGE_REPO_ANONYMOUS`.

The idea of `make dist` (`sage-clone-source`), by the way, is that the source distribution (like the binary packages) distributes a `.git` directory that has a git remote that is accessible to any user...

Finally I got a push mirror running on https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/tracmirror -
so this should be used whereever possible to reduce the load on our git server, and use `https:` in place of `git:`.

I don't understand how this is different from https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/trac which we already had.

the old one is a pull mirror, so there is a 30+ min delay in updating it, as opposed to the new one, which is a push mirror, updated immediately via push from trac git server (via a post-receive commit hook)

on github we now only have a repo with develop and master branches (and all the tags for betas/rcs, starting from 8.5.beta1)

the gitlab repo used on this ticket is a true push mirror, carrying all the branches, and only behind the git trac server by seconds.
(and as git trac does not allow https access, we use the gitlab repo, which does allow https)

Right now we have:

origin	https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/tracmirror.git (push)

I agree. It seems that the current active upstream is at https://github.com/freetdi/tdlib
and the old servers are long gone.
(email is obsolete too, the current affiliation of Larisch appears to be KAUST:
https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/cs/people/person/lukas-larisch)

I'll fix this.
