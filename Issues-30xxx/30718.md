As noted in #21700, our `pynac` spkg-install script explicitly disables use of giac. So that should not be a dependency.

Removing the dependency allows for greater parallelization of the build.

This is also a step toward allowing to build Sage with `./configure --without-giac` (see #30383 - `configure --disable-SPKG` for standard packages).

See also:
- #29542 spkg-configure.m4 for pynac

This looks okay, but something is wrong with other dependencies. With this branch, `make pynac` works. With the current `develop` branch, `make pynac` fails (on OS X + homebrew) because `giac` fails to build:

```
checking for lapack... no
configure: error: Package requirements (lapack) were not met:

No package 'lapack' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables LAPACK_CFLAGS
and LAPACK_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.
```
Running plain "make" works, I guess because something gets built before `giac` which provides whatever it needs.
