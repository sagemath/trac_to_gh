We make the following change to `sagelib`:
- add a `console_script` that installs a kernel spec (using `sage.repl.ipython_kernel.install`), similar to  `ipykernel.kernelspec` (https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/f2e9895a6217c53c3912a0fdeb306a8316fd62fd/ipykernel/kernelspec.py), using `jupyter_client.kernelspec.KernelSpecManager` for the actual installation.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I think it gets linked in the help menu.

By the looks of it, the standard Python3 kernel populates that help menu with external links to the python website.

I suspect this locally hosted approach was taken to make sagemath more functional in offline settings (which do happen, particularly in more remote places where internet connections aren't so plentiful or are unreliable)

I think the kernelspec is NOT the place to host this doc. Perhaps this was chosen as a spot that's guaranteed to be accessible by the kernel, and possibly a place that's not problematic to serve files from? I'm actually a little surprised: you'd think the kernel config directory is exactly what you DON'T want a web server to serve.

Generally, I'd say serving /usr/local/doc shouldn't be much of a problem, so perhaps just not symlinking and serving SAGE_DOC instead? I guess looking around the jupyter ecosystem a bit to see what solutions other projects come up with ...

isn't copying/building the docs and optionally deleting the installation source the normal way to install software docs?

Sure, installing the docs `.../local/share/docs` is completely reasonable. That's an installed location, not a source or build location.\n\nInstalling the sagemath kernel in jupyter produces a link to it in `.../local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath`.

It's about the location. Sure, installing the docs `.../local/share/docs` is completely reasonable. That's an installed location, not a source or build location.

Installing the sagemath kernel in jupyter produces a link to it in `.../local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath`. That's a different location (and possibly in a different "local" tree: for instance, the first might be in `$SAGE_LOCAL` whereas the latter might be in `$HOME/.local` if someone decides to install the sagemath kernel for the system-jupyter but only for the one user.

Telling the standard jupyter install_kernel machinery to make `doc` available in the relevant `kernels/sagemath` would *copy* it; not symlink. From jupyter's perspective that's probably a reasonable thing and the most reliable, but it's not what we want, because we don't want two copies of the sage doc -- we probably want 0 or 1.

Other kernels do seem to make doclinks available in the help menu, but they are links to the actual documentation hosted by the project; so not a local copy.

It looks like a symlink was an easy solution to make the docs available to jupyter to serve without copying them over. But it seems that having a symlink in the `kernels/sagemath` directory is a little unusual from a jupyter perspective.

  The kernel might also be missing in the wheels. Best to redo the kernelspec generation/installation similar to ​https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/main/setup.py#L108

  When building a wheel, the symlink `doc` must be omitted but the other files should be listed as `data_files`.
