As a follow-up to #29355 (which separated build-time from run-time
determination of the number of threads to use), we get rid of
`src/bin/sage-num-threads.py` completely by implementing the
desired defaulting behavior for the number of threads used in
`src/sage/parallel/ncpus.py` and `src/sage/doctest/control.py`.
