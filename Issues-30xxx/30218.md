(follow-up from #30092)


We define a category `InnerProductSpaces` with 
- parent method `dual` (which returns `self`),
- element method `inner_product`.

**A complication for complex vector spaces:** `FreeModule` defines:
- `dot_product` - which ignores `inner_product_matrix` and does not conjugate
- `hermitian_inner_product` - which ignores `inner_product_matrix` but conjugates the left factor (`self`)
- `inner_product` - which uses `inner_product_matrix` but does not conjugate.

Perhaps we need to add an extra parameter `inner_product_hermitian` to `FreeModule`. For a complex base ring, the module would only be added to the category of `InnerProductSpaces` if this is `True`.


`MatrixSpace` elements currently do not have `inner_product`.

- [numpy.vdot](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.vdot.html#numpy.vdot) conjugates the left factor; and also handles the inner product of matrices in the same way.
- SymPy's [Matrix.dot](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/matrices/matrices.html#sympy.matrices.matrices.MatrixBase.dot) has parameters `hermitian` and `conjugate_convention` that control if and how factors are conjugated.
