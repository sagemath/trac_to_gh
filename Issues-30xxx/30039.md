Hello David, 

I have added weighted version of `2Dsweep` and wrapper method for `diameter` computation similar to in `distances_all_pairs.pyx`. Its not final yet, I just wanted to keep you updated with how I have decided to organize it.

Kindly take a look at it. Any suggestions will be helpful.

I will hopefully complete the weighted version of `DiFUB` by tomorrow.

Vipul

I didnt quite understand what you are saying, are you suggesting to stop 2Dsweep after 2nd step. But i would like to mention that we have followed the same steps in unweighted version of 2Dsweep. 

Sorry to bother you.. But can you please expalin you are saying.

P.S. - I have made the changes in `eccentricity` method in `digraph.py` similar to `graph.py`

```diff

+    
+    This method implements the weighted version of the algorithm proposed

```

This should work and be slightly faster (ok, minor improvement)

```diff
-        order_1.push_back(pair[double, v_index](distances[v], v))
+        order_1.emplace_back(distances[v], v)
```

```diff

+            computed diameter. They also work with negative weight, if there is
```

The documentation you added in `digraph.py` suggests that we don't have a basic method for weighted digraphs, but we do.

In the comparison of methods, you can compare DiFUB with any exact algorithm based on eccentricity.

This threw an error, so I kept the previous version.

I have made changes for that, but i am not sure are those changes sufficient?

That's weird, when ran doctest on my system it passed with no error. I have checked it again. Still no problem.

I have added equality while looking for antipode. So that atleast one vertex will be made antipode and i think it will solve it.

Please check that it works (because i am unable to confirm it).

It will occur only via `DiFUB` and this will occur only when there is an error raised in `2DSweep`.

I am also unable to understand it properly since it is receiving error, instead of terminating right then, it is ignoring it and sending garbage value stored in LB(on my system it is 0.0) without executing remaining part of code.

I am guessing if you run this example on your system you might encounter different value than 0.0(as it has previously happened in case of antipode).

I have added a doctest for `DiFUB` and I think there is nothing more to do.
