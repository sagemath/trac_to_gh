a correct way would be to test makeinfo version in ECL itself.

Anyhow, the old makeinfo on macOS which creates problems can be tested for by

```
makeinfo -c foo 2>&1 | grep invalid
```

this returns something nonempty on makeinfo 4.8, and will be empty on a modern makeinfo - or when there is no makeinfo available.

I suggest that this test is used in spkg-install to test whether the flag `--disable-manual` should be used, or not.
