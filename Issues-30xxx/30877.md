Follow-up from #30404 (Add pyright and pycodestyle checks as Github actions):

What is left to do is to add the integration of the github action output to trac. That can be done as follows:
1. Sync trac branches to sagetrac-mirror (by post-commit hook)
2. Activate github actions in the sagetrac-mirror github repo
3. Add the following code to either the patchbot output or to the trac ticket header (next to the patchbot button)

```
<a href="https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/actions?query=workflow%3ALint+branch%3BRANCH"><img src="https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/workflows/Lint/badge.svg?branch=BRANCH&event=push"/></a>
```
Here BRANCH needs to be replaced by the branch.
Giving something similar to

![](https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/workflows/Lint/badge.svg?branch=patch-2&event=push)

As this requires rights to the github repo and trac config, I cannot do this and have to leave it to somebody else.

I'm trying to re-create a mirror on github atm. Our repo apparently has too many branches for GH to take it in one go. So it has to go branch  by branch, tag by tag...

It would also be great if you could activate the github actions in the sagetrac mirror.

OK, I've finally got around to install the hook to actually do the mirror-pushing, it seems to work now.

All actions? I've done this for the time being, so it's active now, but perhaps we need to look into trimming the list.

sage_trac_plugin is a **client** (mostly a git extension, with various addons to 
deal with trac tickets).

It does have a kind of [GitLab](../wikis/GitLab) integration (used by the release manager, I suppose),
- this integration does autoimatic opening/managing of trac tickets for MRs on [GitLab](../wikis/GitLab).
Anything added there would only affect trac tickets opened via [GitLab](../wikis/GitLab), I guess.


I don't think there is a config for our trac **server** maintained as a git repo anywhere.
(At least I don't know).

Wildcards, tags, and SHAs are allowed. Examples: monalisa/octocat@*, monalisa/octocat@v2, monalisa/*

Could you provide a list of actions to enable this way, in this format?

To my knowledge, that's for specifying which actions are allowed in the workflows (i.e. as steps in the workflow, e.g. checkout), but not the workflows itself.
The trigger for the workflows are specified at the beginning of the workflow file.

Thanks to embray, this is now implemented. 

(Not sure what is the workflow for "resolved but doesn't need merge", so I'll set it simply to positive review.)

Does this mean that now Microsoft knows at what time i connect to trac, from which location, which tickets i am interested in, etc ?

If it is the case, i think this should be made optional and disabled by default, or the plugin should do some caching so that trac serves the picture, not github.

Grains of sand on a beach.  If you're that paranoid about it you can connect through an anonymous VPN and disable tracking cookies which I'm sure you (and I as well) already do.
