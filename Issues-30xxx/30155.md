Right; `git grep scons` doesn't show them. I do see

```
src/mac-app/English.lproj/MainMenu.nib/designable.nib:
   <menuItem title="scons" id="1386">
src/mac-app/English.lproj/MainMenu.nib/designable.nib:
   <menuItem title="scons" id="1604">
```
but I'm not worrying about those.

(Is mac-app actually alive?
I can play around with Xcode to try to update it, we just got a newish MacPB from the office with macOS 10.15 - but I can't promise any timeline on this)
