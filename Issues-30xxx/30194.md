We have a `_random_nonzero_element` method defined in two places,

* src/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py
* src/sage/rings/ring.pyx

The corresponding `random_element` method is "public," in that it doesn't begin with an underscore (underscore means "private" by python convention). The nonzero method should be public as well; as we test more and more examples with random seeds, we are catching corner cases that require nonzero random elements instead of an arbitrary one. These examples are fixed by changing `random_element` to `_random_nonzero_element`, but it's a bad look to be relying on private methods in user-facing code.
