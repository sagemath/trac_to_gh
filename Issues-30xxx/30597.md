This structure is a copy of `bitset_t` for now and at the moment mainly illustrates that the entire setup with a fused type in `biteset.pxi` works.

After combinatorial polyhedron uses this type for its atom-representation it should contain some additional information about which limbs are relevant. So it will increase slightly in memory usage, while still using constant memory (dependent on size). However, access to non-zero limbs will be improved.
