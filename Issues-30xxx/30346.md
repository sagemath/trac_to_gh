Thanks for catching this. It would need a doctest.

Also, the unknot (or rather, the trivial diagram) is such a special case that i wouldn't be surprised if other methods also failed with it. It would be worth checking more carefully.

What further doctest do you mean?

I will pay attention to that during my further development of the KnotInfo package!

I cannot reproduce this error and I completely don't understand how this could be caused by the changes of that ticket which don't use braid groups.

It looks very similar to me as the issue I reported in [ticket:29314#comment:42 this comment] and which I detected on all of my facilities as an interference between the upgrade of the Gap version and the `cysignals` package (see [ticket:29314#comment:76 comment 76] and [ticket:29314#comment:96 96] of #29314)


So lets have a try with that again!
