I will pay attention to that during my further development of the KnotInfo package!

It looks very similar to me as the issue I reported in [this comment](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29314#comment:42) and which I detected on all of my facilities as an interference between the upgrade of the Gap version and the `cysignals` package (see [comment 76](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29314#comment:76) and [96](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29314#comment:96) of #29314)
