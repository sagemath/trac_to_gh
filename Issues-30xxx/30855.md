Currently, `sage.env` contains a huge list of variables that can be set via env vars or `sage_conf`. These are simple string variables. However, in most cases these variables actually have a different type, e.g. they point to files or are booleans. This ticket proposes to convert these stringl variables into the proper class (e.g. `Path` or `bool`).

Since now all paths in `sage.env` are `pathlib.Path`s, some other files had to be changed since they still assumed to be str. I tried to make the changes as minimal as possible, leaving a deeper refactoring to follow-up tickets.

Yes, `sage.features.databases` provides an abstraction on top of `sage.env`.

I would not consider it an improvement to put another, intermediate abstraction inside `sage.env`.

ok, but adding such an abstraction for the ellCurve data directory can be done later (and wasn't my intention).

I agree, it's less uniform because of the special handling of paths.

To make things clear, can we agree that the following is the desired behavior for paths like the ellCurve data directory?
1. If user sets the path via an env variable, and the path exists, take it.
2. If not, but `sage.conf` sets a path that exists, take it.
3. Else, fall back to hard-coded folder relative to `SAGE_SHARE`.

I see the following two approaches:
Option a) is to have all this logic in `sage.env` (maybe with a light wrapper in `sage.features`) and Option b) is to expose the steps 1 and 2 as methods `get_env_variable` and `get_sage_conf_variable` in `sage.env` and put the file check logic in `sage.features`.

These are simple string variables. However, in most cases these variables actually have a different type, e.g. they point to files or are booleans. This ticket proposes to wrap these variables with simple getter methods that convert the string into the proper class (e.g. `Path` or `bool`) and do a bit of after-processing (e.g. check that the path exist).\n \n-This idea is illustrated at the example of the `ellCurve` data directory. Refactoring the other config variables will be done in follow-up tickets.\n+This makes it possible to make the variable resolution more robust.

 Currently, `sage.env` contains a huge list of variables that can be set via env vars or `sage_conf`. These are simple string variables. However, in most cases these variables actually have a different type, e.g. they point to files or are booleans. This ticket proposes to wrap these variables with simple getter methods that convert the string into the proper class (e.g. `Path` or `bool`) and do a bit of after-processing (e.g. check that the path exist).

We use the deprecation mechanism if we have to make incompatible changes.

See comment 4. 
`sage.env` is a low-level interface - a thin wrapper around os.environ, combining environment variables and `sage_conf` and simple fallbacks. It maps string keys to strings. 

Adding complexity there is not an improvement.

`sage.features` was designed to provide a high-level interface to the system environment of sagelib (#20382).

It already does what it seems you are trying to introduce in `sage.env`: It is typed and it implements filesystem lookups.

`sage.features.Executable` uses `PATH`. See #31296 for a proposed improvement.

`sage.features.StaticFile` uses a customizable search path, which defaults to `SAGE_SHARE` - this probably needs a better design, as we are moving away from assumptions related to the installation scheme of the Sage distribution.

That's not how this works. A proposed change needs to be sufficiently motivated - what problem is the ticket trying to solve?  In particular, convincing motivation is necessary when breaking changes to the interface are proposed or the complexity of the code is increased by the change.
