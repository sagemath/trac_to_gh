Let us fix mistaken cases of doubled words in the documentation.

Find a lot of doubled words (some legitimate, some typos) with:

```
$ WORDS="a all an for from if in is it of over that the then to we"
$ for word in $WORDS ; do git grep " $word $word " . ; done
```

Some (not all) instances of "a an" or "an a" also need fixing:

```
$ git grep " a an " .
$ git grep " an a " .
```

Some "The the" should be fixed too:

```
$ git grep "The the " .
```
