}
```
Currently we have:

```
sage: s(t) = t^3; s
t |--> t^3
sage: %display unicode_art
 3
t
```
In this ticket, we add the missing mapsto arrow, using '\u21a6'.

(The longmapsto arrow, '\u27fc' (⟼), does not work well on the macOS terminal, unfortunately)

I would rather vote for `↦` (U+21A6). It's simple and quite readable after all (especially if surrounded by one space on each side). Moreover, it's a single-character symbol, which may avoid some line feed for long expressions (only when the line feed is up to 2 characters).

Not only for the mac guys: in my Ubuntu terminal, I have

So not only U+27FC does not appear longer, but it is even less clear than U+21A6.
