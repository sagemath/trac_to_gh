Too many changes on one ticket - interface, implementation, ... 

This places an unnecessary burden on reviewers.

Also, it seems that this ticket tries to establish a new convention `get_...` for things in `sage.env`, including a new function `get_sage_local`. 

As I said on another ticket - we already have a place for more structured access to system information - that's `sage.feature`.  Please don't create another place in `sage.env`
