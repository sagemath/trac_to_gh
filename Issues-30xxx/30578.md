After #30527, it is possible to install Python packages built by the Sage distribution into user-defined venvs.  

In this ticket, we create `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/requirements.txt -> src/requirements.txt` to facilitate installing sagelib into such a venv. (This file duplicates some information also available in `build/pkgs`; #29041 will rectify this.)

A virtual environment using it can be created and doctested using:

```
./sage -sh -c '(cd build/pkgs/sagelib/src && tox -v -v -v)'
```
(Reusing wheels built by the Sage distribution requires to do `sage -i pip2pi` first - this is from #30527.)

- #28752 Make sagelib pip-installable in a conda environment

- #29041 at `./bootstrap` time, generate `requirements.txt`, `constraints.txt`, `setup.cfg [install_requires]`, `Pipfile` from `build/pkgs`
- add documentation on how to set up the virtual environment, using either plain `python -m venv`, `virtualenv` (20.x), or `pipenv`.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Yes, I started to play a bit with pipenv, and this looks like a possible route.

I would like to keep that for #29041 though.

On the present ticket I would only want to do the most rudimentary thing - basically to try out the adjustments that sagelib will need (see #22731).

+After #30527, it is possible to install Python packages built by the Sage distribution into user-defined venvs.  
 
+In this ticket, we create `build/pkgs/sagelib/src/requirements.txt -> src/requirements.txt` to facilitate installing sagelib into such a venv. (This file duplicates some information also available in `build/pkgs`; #29041 will rectify this.)
