Pari and gmpy2 integers are not accepted in `gcd`/`lcm` method of `Integer`

```
sage: 4.lcm(pari(5))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for lcm: 'Integer Ring' and '<class 'cypari2.gen.Gen'>'
sage: import gmpy2
sage: 3.lcm(gmpy2.mpz(2))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for lcm: 'Integer Ring' and '<class 'mpz'>'
```
(though it works with `numpy.int32` and `numpy.int64`)

LGTM. Some remarks though:
* I wonder if `py_scalar_to_element()` should not handle `cypari2` objects, or even try calling the `sage()` method of its argument before giving up.
* I am not convinced that it is worth doing a type test before calling `py_scalar_to_element()`.
* After your changes, `gcd()` is defined at the level of PID elements, but PID elements other than integers still override it with their own `gcd()` method instead of implementing `_gcd()`. Should more of the existing `gcd()` be changed to `_gcd()`?

Yep, I also hesitated. The reason why I did not do it because coercion works with types (all pari objects are `class Gen`) and the friend `py_scalar_parent` has input is a type. This might create confusion. To my mind, `py_scalar_to_element` is not specified enough on what it tries to achieve.

I believe so. But this project needs more care than what I wanted to fix.
