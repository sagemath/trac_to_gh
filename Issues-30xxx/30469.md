Keywords: polyhedral face, face figure, combinatorial polyhedron

<a id='comment:20'></a>Perhaps rephrase the docstring of `as_combinatorial_polyhedron` so it is clearer what quotient is formed (what is "the" polyhedron).

Also perhaps a doctest could show how the Vrep/Hrep of a quotient is labeled.

(This is relevant for #31803 when we introduce more specific parents, and morphisms)

`Vrepresentation`/vertices is clear. But I also keep the labels of the facets, taking the label of the first representative of each facet, if that makes any sense.

I even know all the equations, but that is a hard one for `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.

I could even introduce a tiny class `InducedRepresentation` that just wrappes around the original Hrepresentation object. I don't know what is best.
