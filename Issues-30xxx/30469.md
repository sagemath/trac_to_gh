We implement a method that obtains a combinatorial face or the quotient.

This is much faster than `as_polyhedron` from polyhedral face and could be used to obtain a polyhedral face geometrically with precomputed double description.

**CC:**  @yuan-zhou @tscrim

**Keywords:** polyhedral face, face figure, combinatorial polyhedron

Perhaps rephrase the docstring of `as_combinatorial_polyhedron` so it is clearer what quotient is formed (what is "the" polyhedron).

Also perhaps a doctest could show how the Vrep/Hrep of a quotient is labeled.

(This is relevant for #31803 when we introduce more specific parents, and morphisms)

This seems to work well but it would be good if a reviewer who knows Cython better than I do could take a look

Not a Cython comment, but in `as_combinatorial_polyhedron`, the `REFERENCES` should not be indented.

Since `__copy__` is a special Python method, I am slightly worried about making it into a `cpdef` method. I think you are better off implementing a `cdef _copy` method and calling that from `__copy__`.

Looks good other than those two things.

You are right. The method in `list_of_faces.pyx` might as well return the relabeling map as well, so that the labels can be used.

`Vrepresentation`/vertices is clear. But I also keep the labels of the facets, taking the label of the first representative of each facet, if that makes any sense.

I even know all the equations, but that is a hard one for `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.

I could even introduce a tiny class `InducedRepresentation` that just wrappes around the original Hrepresentation object. I don't know what is best.
