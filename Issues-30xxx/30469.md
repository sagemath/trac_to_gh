We implement a method that obtains a combinatorial face or the quotient.

This is much faster than `as_polyhedron` from polyhedral face and could be used to obtain a polyhedral face geometrically with precomputed double description.

**CC:**  @yuan-zhou @tscrim

**Keywords:** polyhedral face, face figure, combinatorial polyhedron

Perhaps rephrase the docstring of `as_combinatorial_polyhedron` so it is clearer what quotient is formed (what is "the" polyhedron).

Also perhaps a doctest could show how the Vrep/Hrep of a quotient is labeled.

(This is relevant for #31803 when we introduce more specific parents, and morphisms)

- `:meth:~sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base.meet_of_facets` | largest face contained specified facets` --> contained in the specified facets
- `Polyhedron_base.join_of_Vrep(self, *Vrepresentatives): ... in case of...` --> "in the case of" * 2
- `FaceIterator_base(SageObject).join_of_Vrep(self, *indices): .. NOTE:: ... may not te well defined.` --> "be"
- Why is it `meet_of_facets`, but not `meet_of_Hrep`? If rays/lines are allowed on the primal side, why doesn't it make sense to consider equations on the dual side?

Not a Cython comment, but in `as_combinatorial_polyhedron`, the `REFERENCES` should not be indented.

Since `__copy__` is a special Python method, I am slightly worried about making it into a `cpdef` method. I think you are better off implementing a `cdef _copy` method and calling that from `__copy__`.

Looks good other than those two things.

`Vrepresentation`/vertices is clear. But I also keep the labels of the facets, taking the label of the first representative of each facet, if that makes any sense.

I even know all the equations, but that is a hard one for `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.

I could even introduce a tiny class `InducedRepresentation` that just wrappes around the original Hrepresentation object. I don't know what is best.
