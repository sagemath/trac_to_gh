It would be good if one can state whether a manifold is orientable as some statements only apply for these kind of manifolds. Of course, at the end it will be, except for very trivial cases, the user's responsibility that the conditions are actually satisfied.

**Note:** Compactness follows in a later ticket

**Regarding orientability:**

One could add a method `set_orientation` which takes a list of charts or frames which cover the manifold yielding an orientation. Then it is the user's responsibility to check that this is indeed an orientation. Using this, one can construct things like volume forms etc.

In very easy cases, like if the manifold is covered by only one chart, one can give the orientation right away.

*Remark:* Notice that the volume form returned by [sage.manifolds.differentiable.metric.PseudoRiemannianMetric.volume_form](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/metric.html#sage.manifolds.differentiable.metric.PseudoRiemannianMetric.volume_form) does not necessarily yield a volume form at all. One indeed needs an oriented atlas. Otherwise, the gluing process could be messed up. This can all be prevented and covered by my proposal above.

**Regarding Compactness:**

I think, the best way would be to state compactness right from the beginning. Not stating compactness should, in my opinion, not exclude compactness. Maybe a new manifold class does a suitable job?

In the differentiable setting, things are easy and can be managed by using frames. This is quite convenient because there are manifolds which can be covered by one global frame, and therefore admit an orientation, but need at least two charts.

However, I know that there is a notion of orientability in the topological setting, where the use of charts is mandatory. I look for further literature.

I would prefer the chart version because it is applicable to both, topological and differentiable manifolds. Because the former case is easier and more practical, one could also implement orientations only for differentiable manifolds at first. Further opinions on that?

**Addendum:** If someone has an idea of how both cases, charts and frames, can be managed conveniently, I welcome that pretty much.

In response to your questions/comments from [comment:2](#comment%3A2): I think it should just be the user's responsibility as it would be too costly and annoying to include code to check this. Trusting the usuer is done in a number of places in Sage too. As Matthias said, you can use `Manifolds(R).Compact()` to indicate compactness.

A few stylistic things:

You are saving 1 character here

```
            from sage.manifolds.differentiable.vector_bundle \
                                                            import TensorBundle
```
Just go over the 80 char/line limit; it makes it much more readable.

Similar for these changes:

```diff
             sage: repr(TM) # indirect doctest
-            'Tangent bundle TM over the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M'
+            'Tangent bundle TM over the 2-dimensional differentiable
+             manifold M'
             sage: TM._repr_()
-            'Tangent bundle TM over the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M'
+            'Tangent bundle TM over the 2-dimensional differentiable
+             manifold M'
```

Further indent the last line on this change and all other similar changes:

```diff
             {(Chart (M, (x, y)),
-              Chart (M, (u, v))): Change of coordinates from Chart (M, (x, y)) to Chart (M, (u, v))}
+              Chart (M, (u, v))): Change of coordinates from Chart (M, (x, y))
+              to Chart (M, (u, v))}
```
to make it (more) clear that it is associated to that item.

Right. There are many tickets going on simultaneously. I have to catch them up first.

<a id='comment:34'></a>
Yes, thank you. However, I do have a few other comments from another read-over. However, these should be the last of them.

The `keys()` call here

```
for frame in base_space._get_min_covering(connection._coefficients.keys()):
```
seem like it is not needed.

```diff
         INPUT:
 
-        - an orientation; either a chart / list of charts, or a vector frame /
+        - ``orientation`` -- either a chart / list of charts, or a vector frame /
           list of vector frames, covering ``self``
```
and similar.

This

```
        .. NOTE::

            This assumes that the manifold admits an orientation, see
            :meth:`~sage.manifolds.manifold.DifferentiableManifold.orientation`
            for details.
```
in `volume_form()` (in `differentiable/metric.py`) is wrong. An error is raised if the manifold does not admit an orientation. Subsequently in `hodge_star` as well.

In `set_orientation` is it the default orientation or simply the orientation? I don't think you allow multiple orientations on a manifold. Is that a planned future feature?

`# set a priori no orientation` -> `# default is no orientation` (or `# set no orientation a priori`)

```diff
-        if self.orientation():
-            return True
-        return False
+        return bool(self.orientation())
```

Ah yes. Thank you.

You mean wrong in the sense that we should note that having no orientation means this feature is not available?

I cannot think of a case where a manifold has *the* orientation. Allowing multiple orientations means also allowing multiple volume forms. But which one then to choose for `hodge_star`? I think it is reasonable to fix just one orientation.

I know there are multiple orientations possible for a manifold, but there is a set orientation for the manifold. There is not a default one where a user can arbitrarily choose another as an input. Contrast this with charts. I would think of this like a manifold with a distinguished orientation (which can be changed later on, but the manifold has still indicated the one orientation to rule them all).
