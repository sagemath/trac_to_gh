Importing `complex_mpfr` does currently not work without previously importing `sage.all`. This is because of a couple of cyclic imports (e.g. `complex_number` -> `complex_double` -> `complex_number`).

In this ticket, we break these cyclic imports by narrowing down some of the global module imports to local function-wide imports. This was not possible in the case of the `CCtoCDF` class, since there `ComplexDoubleElement` is cimported, which has to be done on the module level. I've hence extracted this class to a new module `complex_conversion.pyx`.

With these changes, the executing the following code

```
from sage.rings.complex_mpfr import ComplexField
print(ComplexField())
```
using `./venv/bin/python3` works. Previously, it failed with 

```
  File "/home/tobias/sage/src/test.py", line 1, in <module>
    from sage.rings.complex_mpfr import ComplexField
  File "sage/rings/complex_mpfr.pyx", line 1, in init sage.rings.complex_mpfr
  File "sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx", line 1, in init sage.rings.real_mpfr
  File "sage/libs/mpmath/utils.pyx", line 17, in init sage.libs.mpmath.utils
ImportError: cannot import name ComplexField
```

Why don't you add a proper `.pxd` file and does a `cimport` at module level?

`cimport` does **not** trigger the Python module import (the things in the `.pyx`). It is just reading the corresponding `.pxd` file.
