This can be a dependency for other tickets.

For instance tickets updating dependencies to
versions that dropped support for Python 3.6.

I don't think there is anything that says that we "should" drop Python 3.6 support.

Oh good, then let's support it as long as we can.

By the way #15530 and #15980 which started support
for Python 3.6 are almost ready to be closed.

#30053 says that we must drop Python 3.6 - unless you want to have a go at it.

it seems that some of our code related to docbuilding is too new for 3.6, and perhaps our Sphinx is too new too. 

Besides, the EOL for 3.6 is late 2021, which is soon.

??!

This ticket is for **dropping** support for Python 3.6 -- this involves changing what system python versions we accept (`build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4`) and removing python3.6 workarounds from the code.

NEP 29 would already allow us to drop support now -- but I don't think we want to do it now (because of Sage's traditional role of providing a distribution that people can install onto ancient machines) -- hence the milestone is set to "pending".

Sorry, it wasn't clear to me from the ticket description that this is more than a placeholder to mark dependencies on Python 3.6.

NEP 29 is actually quite explicit about that one should drop support after the 42 months, e.g "On Jun 23, 2020 drop support for Python 3.6 (initially released on Dec 23, 2016)". Of course, it could be sage's policy to support also older python versions, but that's then no longer NEP 29 (in it's strict form).

    Partially revert "Allow Sage to work with a system Python 3.6."
    
```

why do we need an implementation for `__len__` ?
(before `abb5607710a` it was just `__len__ = cardinality`)

Sorry, I don't understand your question.
In pseudo-language:

Before abb5607710a: `__len__ = cardinality`

After abb5607710a: `__len__ = int(cardinality)`

After 7d97a56c5a (this ticket): `__len__ = cardinality`

So we are back to the original behavior before abb5607710a "Allow Sage to work with a system Python 3.6."

Maybe this representation of the diff is clearer: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/7d97a56c5aaab99af75de58b71b144a28d4f9dd3

There are two relevant Python minimum versions (see [comment:13](#comment%3A13)):

- the minimum Python version Sage can use as its underlying Python
- the minimum Python version Sage can use to bootstrap,
  building is own Python if necessary

On Ubuntu 18.04, building from source will still work,
but if the system Python is 3.6, Sage will build a more
recent Python to base itself on.

no need to build it on !Debian/Ubuntu, even the old LTS provide modern pythons. E.g.

```
sudo apt-get install python3.8 python3.8-dev python3.8-distutils python3.8-venv
```

and if you don't have root you can use pyenv to get modern python.
