Oh good, then let's support it as long as we can.

By the way #15530 and #15980 which started support
for Python 3.6 are almost ready to be closed.

<a id='comment:4'></a>#30053 says that we must drop Python 3.6 - unless you want to have a go at it.

it seems that some of our code related to docbuilding is too new for 3.6, and perhaps our Sphinx is too new too. 

Besides, the EOL for 3.6 is late 2021, which is soon.

This ticket is for **dropping** support for Python 3.6 -- this involves changing what system python versions we accept (`build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4`) and removing python3.6 workarounds from the code.

NEP 29 would already allow us to drop support now -- but I don't think we want to do it now (because of Sage's traditional role of providing a distribution that people can install onto ancient machines) -- hence the milestone is set to "pending".

<a id='comment:11'></a>Sorry, it wasn't clear to me from the ticket description that this is more than a placeholder to mark dependencies on Python 3.6.

NEP 29 is actually quite explicit about that one should drop support after the 42 months, e.g "On Jun 23, 2020 drop support for Python 3.6 (initially released on Dec 23, 2016)". Of course, it could be sage's policy to support also older python versions, but that's then no longer NEP 29 (in it's strict form).

Also correct me if I'm wrong, but since sage is also installing its own python version, sage can still be used on older systems, right? It is just that the system python is not used.

Anyway, I've tried to locate all workarounds that are in place for Python 3.6 support, and removed them (I've probably missed a few, but maybe its good anyway to pay of the technical debt in follow up tickets). Moreover, I've upgraded the requirements to 3.7 (again, I might have missed something).

Both the original text and the new one are not correct. This part refers to the `sage-bootstrap-python` which has much wider range of supported python versions, including Python >= 2.6 and Python >= 3.4 - according to `build/tox.ini`.

I mean, what's

```
    def __len__....
...
-        return int(self.cardinality())
+        return Integer(1) << self._s.cardinality()
+
+    __len__ = cardinality
```
in 

```
commit 7d97a56c5aaab99af75de58b71b144a28d4f9dd3
Author: Tobias Diez <code@tobiasdiez.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 7 23:52:28 2020 +0100

    Partially revert "Allow Sage to work with a system Python 3.6."
    
```

why do we need an implementation for `__len__` ?
(before `abb5607710a` it was just `__len__ = cardinality`)

<a id='comment:28'></a>Sorry, I don't understand your question.
In pseudo-language:

Before abb5607710a: `__len__ = cardinality`

After abb5607710a: `__len__ = int(cardinality)`

After 7d97a56c5a (this ticket): `__len__ = cardinality`

So we are back to the original behavior before abb5607710a "Allow Sage to work with a system Python 3.6."

Maybe this representation of the diff is clearer: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/7d97a56c5aaab99af75de58b71b144a28d4f9dd3

- the minimum Python version Sage can use as its underlying Python
- the minimum Python version Sage can use to bootstrap,
