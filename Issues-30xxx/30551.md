Oh good, then let's support it as long as we can.

By the way #15530 and #15980 which started support
for Python 3.6 are almost ready to be closed.

#30053 says that we must drop Python 3.6 - unless you want to have a go at it.

it seems that some of our code related to docbuilding is too new for 3.6, and perhaps our Sphinx is too new too. 

Besides, the EOL for 3.6 is late 2021, which is soon.

According to NEP 29, "a project with a major or minor version release in November 2020 should support Python 3.7 and newer." and thus this ticket can be closed in my opinion.

??!

This ticket is for **dropping** support for Python 3.6 -- this involves changing what system python versions we accept (`build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4`) and removing python3.6 workarounds from the code.

NEP 29 would already allow us to drop support now -- but I don't think we want to do it now (because of Sage's traditional role of providing a distribution that people can install onto ancient machines) -- hence the milestone is set to "pending".

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:11\" align=\"right\">comment:11</div>\n\nSorry, it wasn't clear to me from the ticket description that this is more than a placeholder to mark dependencies on Python 3.6.\n\nNEP 29 is actually quite explicit about that one should drop support after the 42 months, e.g \"On Jun 23, 2020 drop support for Python 3.6 (initially released on Dec 23, 2016)\". Of course, it could be sage's policy to support also older python versions, but that's then no longer NEP 29 (in it's strict form). However, one should also keep in mind that supporting old Python versions results in technical debt that might be bigger than the gains from supporting old systems.\n\nAlso correct me if I'm wrong, but since sage is also installing its own python version, sage can still be used on older systems, right? It is just that the system python is not used.\n\nAnyway, I've tried to locate all workarounds that are in place for Python 3.6 support, and removed them (I've probably missed a few, but maybe its good anyway to pay of the technical debt in follow up tickets).

Sorry, it wasn't clear to me from the ticket description that this is more than a placeholder to mark dependencies on Python 3.6.

NEP 29 is actually quite explicit about that one should drop support after the 42 months, e.g "On Jun 23, 2020 drop support for Python 3.6 (initially released on Dec 23, 2016)". Of course, it could be sage's policy to support also older python versions, but that's then no longer NEP 29 (in it's strict form). However, one should also keep in mind that supporting old Python versions results in technical debt that might be bigger than the gains from supporting old systems.

Also correct me if I'm wrong, but since sage is also installing its own python version, sage can still be used on older systems, right? It is just that the system python is not used.

Anyway, I've tried to locate all workarounds that are in place for Python 3.6 support, and removed them (I've probably missed a few, but maybe its good anyway to pay of the technical debt in follow up tickets). Moreover, I've upgraded the requirements to 3.7 (again, I might have missed something).

I mean, what's

```
    def __len__....
...
-        return int(self.cardinality())
+        return Integer(1) << self._s.cardinality()
+
+    __len__ = cardinality
```
in 

```
commit 7d97a56c5aaab99af75de58b71b144a28d4f9dd3
Author: Tobias Diez <code@tobiasdiez.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 7 23:52:28 2020 +0100

    Partially revert "Allow Sage to work with a system Python 3.6."
    
```

why do we need an implementation for `__len__` ?
(before `abb5607710a` it was just `__len__ = cardinality`)

Sorry, I don't understand your question.
In pseudo-language:

Before abb5607710a: `__len__ = cardinality`

After abb5607710a: `__len__ = int(cardinality)`

After 7d97a56c5a (this ticket): `__len__ = cardinality`

So we are back to the original behavior before abb5607710a "Allow Sage to work with a system Python 3.6."

Maybe this representation of the diff is clearer: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/7d97a56c5aaab99af75de58b71b144a28d4f9dd3

Did you take into account that Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS supported until 2028) still uses Python 3.6 (see https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/python3)? I am not sure what they intend to do with Python though.

There are two relevant Python minimum versions (see [comment:13](#comment%3A13)):

- the minimum Python version Sage can use as its underlying Python
- the minimum Python version Sage can use to bootstrap,
  building is own Python if necessary

On Ubuntu 18.04, building from source will still work,
but if the system Python is 3.6, Sage will build a more
recent Python to base itself on.

no need to build it on !Debian/Ubuntu, even the old LTS provide modern pythons. E.g.

```
sudo apt-get install python3.8 python3.8-dev python3.8-distutils python3.8-venv
```

and if you don't have root you can use pyenv to get modern python.

We should be thinking about stopping with shipping CPython sources, we don't patch them, and there are enough ways to get it in binary.
