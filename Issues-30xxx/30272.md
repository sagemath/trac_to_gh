```
In the upcoming changes we want to allow mixed differential forms, among other things, being made immutable (see #30181, #30261).

However, the current implementation would not support that behavior properly, namely:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: A = M.mixed_form()
sage: a = M.diff_form(2)
sage: A[2] = a
sage: A[2] is a
True
```

If `A` would be set immutable and `a` is not, this would contradict the behavior of an immutable element. Even if `a` would automatically be set immutable as soon as `A` had been set immutable, this might happen not on the behalf of the user.

I'd propose a similar approach as I had done in #30208 for bundle connections, and as it is already known for tensor fields, namely by introducing methods `set_comp` and `comp` (`add_comp` would not be necessary). Then each instance representing a homogeneous component is bound only to the mixed differential form.

As always, suggestions and opinions are welcome.

First approach.

**What I did:**

- homogeneous components are bound to mixed form and a priori detached from other instances; in particular

```
sage: A[0] = f
sage: A[0] is f
```
   yields `False` now.

- components are only initialized on demand (not on initialization of the mixed form)
- by default, homogeneous components are named according to the mixed form's name: `A = A_0, A_1, ...`
- `set_comp` method similar to tensor fields

I tried to maintain as much backwards compatibility as possible. For example, even if copies now, the names are still applied if `A[:] = [f, omega, eta]` syntax is used. But the long-term idea is to favor `set_comp(i)[:] = ...` syntax instead of `omega[:] = ...` plus `A[i] = omega` syntax.

Comments are appreciated.
