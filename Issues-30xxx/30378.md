As discussed in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/kYZ4N73oiCM/-iDyQLWyBAAJ, we have currently

```
sage: (x^2).subs({x: sqrt(x)})                                                  
sqrt(x)
```
A consequence of this bug is

```
sage: f(x) = x^2                                                                
sage: f(sqrt(x))                                                                
sqrt(x)
```
Note that the following outputs are correct:

```
sage: (x^2).subs({x: sqrt(pi)})                                                 
pi
sage: (x^2).subs({x: x^(1/3)})                                                  
x^(2/3)
sage: y = var('y')                                                              
sage: (x^2).subs({x: sqrt(y)})                                                  
y
```
Moreover, distinct powers of `x` seem OK:

```
sage: (x^3).subs({x: sqrt(x)})                                                  
x^(3/2)
sage: (x^(-2)).subs({x: sqrt(x)})                                               
1/x
```
But a match is problematic:

```
sage: (x^3).subs({x:x^(1/3)})
x^(1/3)
```

<a id='comment:6'></a>I did some debugging and can report the following: this bug happens in https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/85c43c230e8050a1f71898889a021fec28318502/ginac/power.cpp#L747; in fact the correct power in the case of the substitution `x=sqrt(x)` in `x^2` is constructed in `p`, but then, for a reason I am not quite sure of, the substitution gets applied to the correct output again (L748) and then compared to the original expression, `x^2`, (L749) where it is decided to return the result with the substitution applied once again and thus `sqrt(x)` is obtained.

Changing the code such that `p` from L747 is returned causes one doctest to fail, namely:

```
sage -t src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx", line 5150, in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.substitute
Failed example:
    t.subs(w0 == w0^2)

Got:
    a^4 + b^4 + (x^2 + y^2)^3
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of  68 in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.substitute
    [2871 tests, 1 failure, 34.59 s]
```

(Context: `t = a^2 + b^2 + (x+y)^3` and `w0` is a wildcard.)

I don't really see a good solution right now, maybe someone else has some thoughts?

<a id='comment:7'></a>I am not sure how to fix this either - presumably it was precisely for some sort of wildcard situation that this was in there - but I do note the following in `expression.pyx`:

```
            sage: t = a^2 + b^2 + (x+y)^3

...
            sage: t.subs({w0^2: w0^3})
            a^3 + b^3 + (x + y)^3

        Substitute with one or more relational expressions::

            sage: t.subs(w0^2 == w0^3)
            a^3 + b^3 + (x + y)^3
```
so far, so good

```
            sage: t.subs(w0 == w0^2)
            a^8 + b^8 + (x^2 + y^2)^6
```
Wait, what?  Shouldn't these be fourth powers?  That `x` and `y` get replaced by their squares is fine, as is the sixth power, but I'm not at all sure about the eighth powers.

> Wait, what?  Shouldn't these be fourth powers?  That `x` and `y` get replaced by their squares is fine, as is the sixth power, but I'm not at all sure about the eighth powers.  (Also note that the wildcard only found literal squares in the `{w0^2: w0^3}` case, where the cube was not replaced by 1.5 squares - which is presumably good.)

I can only make sense of the eighth powers in a setting where the substitution acts on a power like `a^2` in such a way that both the base and the exponent get squared. Whether or not this is the intended behavior for a general wildcard substitution like this seems debateable; one could argue that it is actually inconsistent as the exponent of the parenthesis is not treated in the same way.

Unfortunately, `make ptestlong` is currently broken for my system, but as far as I can tell from manual testing, there are no other obvious doctest errors other than this wildcard substitution one.

> Note that the [corresponding Ginac code](https://github.com/AlexeiSheplyakov/GiNaC/blob/master/ginac/power.cpp#L652) *always* returns the `subs_one_level` business in this situation where either the exponent or the base are 'not trivially equal', whatever that means in this context.  Unfortunately I can't find out from the commit history where this changed in Pynac - it seems to go back to Burcin's original rewrite back when we changed to !Pynac/Ginac in the first place for basic symbolics a decade ago.


Interesting! I only saw that something concerning `subs` was mentioned in #24262, and that the particular segment around L747 has been introduced in the upgrade on that ticket.

<a id='comment:32'></a>The bug in my previous PR was that the first substitution could trigger a simplification/evaluation, and this could result in a call to maxima. But maxima does not understand ginac's anonymous temporary variables:

```
sage: a = SR.symbol()
sage: a  # we have a new variable
symbol195
sage: maxima(a)  # it can be sent to maxima
_SAGE_VAR_symbol195
sage: bool(maxima(a).sage() == a)  # but it comes back to sage as a different variable
False
```
The expression came back with a different variable than we expected, so the substitution could not match this unexpected new variable.

A follow up ticket could fix the bug properly, by adding a function to pynac that performs a straightforward substitution, without pattern matching or other complications.

PS This bug fix does not seem to be related to #31137 (which was fixed by the patch to pynac in #30446), and, unfortunately, it also does not seem to help with #30688 (which is still open).

<a id='comment:35'></a>I think this example just illustrates that the comment `# We are not in the problematic case, so we can trust Ginac to do the substitution.` is a little bit too optimistic.

I think the documentation of `subs` should make a clear distinction between the case `variable: substitution` (which is well defined mathematically) and the case `expression: substitution`, warn that the latter case is depends on pattern matching and the subtle semantics of the simplification engine - so it should only be used for interactive manipulations but not in production code.
