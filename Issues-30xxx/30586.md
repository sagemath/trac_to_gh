Perhaps just a misconfigured system, but we should make sure to robustly set a consistent locale in which the doctests are run.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

This doctest is:

```
        sage: sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec(r.lm)
```
It causes the R interface to start up, and then R may complain about bad locales on a misconfigured system.

We could of course force a locale in `sage -t`, but I don't think this is a pressing issue.

But I really have no idea how rpy2 works (that is, if it handles locale issues transparently), so that suggestion would be premature. In any case, the cause of this error is that the R interpreter was launched with an invalid environment. For example,

```
$ LC_ALL=derp R --no-save -q
During startup - Warning messages:
1: Setting LC_CTYPE failed, using "C" 
2: Setting LC_COLLATE failed, using "C" 
3: Setting LC_TIME failed, using "C" 
4: Setting LC_MONETARY failed, using "C" 
5: Setting LC_PAPER failed, using "C" 
6: Setting LC_MEASUREMENT failed, using "C"

```

I'm thinking this is not something we need to fix.
