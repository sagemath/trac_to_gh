The doctests already provide a concrete (but useless) example.

Before spending effort on sage-specific SDP backend development, let's survey what kind of interfacing routes for SDP solvers are available. Either by extending  
Meta-ticket #26511 (Use Python optimization interfaces: PuLP, Pyomo, cylp...), which is currently LP/MILP-centric, or a separate meta ticket for SDP solvers.
