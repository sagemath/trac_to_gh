A few questions: 

- can we accomplish the same thing by installing `twisted` (after having removed it in #29754), and then importing `twisted.persisted.styles`? That is, can we delete `fpickle_setup.py`?
- if not, then should we update that file with the latest version from `twisted`, for py3 compatibility?

To be honest, I don't really know what `fpickle_setup.py` is supposed to do, or where it is tested in the Sage library, or what goes wrong if we remove its functionality.

See #11874 for some information. I certainly don't see the failure there: [comment:46](#comment%3A46), "PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'instancemethod'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.instancemethod failed".

Should we just get rid of `fpickle_setup.py` instead?
