If one has flint-arb installed but not arb as a system package, then compilation currently fails unless one explicitly sets `ARB_LIBRARY = flint-arb`. In this ticket, we also check for the existence of flint-arb making this manual step obsolete. This is similar in spirit to #30706, which does the same for CBLAS.

The config file `build/pgks/arb/spkg-configure.m4` does a similar check (I think) and maybe can/needs to be adapted as well. If that's the case I would like to ask if somebody else can implement the necessary changes, as I've no experience with these config files. Thanks!

Depends on #30901

You would write a class similar to `CythonFeature` (from `src/sage/features/__init__.py`) with a method revealing the library name.  The class would use the information from `sage.env.ARB_LIBRARY` (get rid of the default); but if unset, it would try to link a test program using `acb_mat_eig_simple` against the library. In fact, using `CythonFeature` for doing this test could pretty much work -- except that I'm not sure if `sage.misc.cython` perhaps pulls in too many modules at the moment.
