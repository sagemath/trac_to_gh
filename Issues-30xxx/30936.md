If one has flint-arb installed but not arb as a system package, then compilation currently fails unless one explicitly sets `ARB_LIBRARY = flint-arb`. In this ticket, we also check for the existence of flint-arb making this manual step obsolete. This is similar in spirit to #30706, which does the same for CBLAS.

The config file `build/pgks/arb/spkg-configure.m4` does a similar check (I think) and maybe can/needs to be adapted as well. If that's the case I would like to ask if somebody else can implement the necessary changes, as I've no experience with these config files. Thanks!

Depends on #30901
