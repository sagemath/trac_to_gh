A central hyperplane arrangement must have an even number of regions by central symmetry... yet the one below gets 31 regions(!).

#30078 fixes this and we add another doctest here.

Yes, this is how the number of regions is computed up to sign. The hyperplane arrangement seems to be sane: computing `.regions()` computes the expected (number of) regions.

I asked the number of regions to double-check something and then got this scary answer...

I encountered this problem in some example a long while ago, before I was contributing to Sage myself. A simple workaround is to have `n_regions` output `len(self.regions())`, which was good enough for me. Of course, this is much slower if one doesn’t want to compute the regions anyway. I don’t understand the characteristic polynomial well enough to figure out the error in there.

The characteristic polynomial is obtained through recursive deletions and contractions of hyperplane arrangements. During this process, it may occur that some hyperplane `h` is included in an arrangement multiple times with different scalings of the defining linear expression which are not properly detected as duplicates. This is due to a defect in the method `hyperplane.primitive()` addressed in #30078.

```
sage: A.n_regions()

sage: A.characteristic_polynomial()(-1)

So it is now consistent. We probably just want to add a doctest for this ticket.
