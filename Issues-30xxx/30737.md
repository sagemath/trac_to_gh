zenodo guesses the authors from the github commit data, and has a cutoff in the number of authors. The way to adjust this is to have 
`.zenodo.json` file, cf e.g. https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo/issues/1421

We create a template for it and fill it in in `sage-update-version`.
(We assume that `envsubst` (from gettext) is installed - after all this
is the script for the release manager.

I don't know how much of the data should be in, i.e. would zenodo fill in e.g. version if we omit it in json.
