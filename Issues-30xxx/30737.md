zenodo guesses the authors from the github commit data, and has a cutoff in the number of authors. The way to adjust this is to have 
`.zenodo.json` file, cf e.g. https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo/issues/1421

We create a template for it and fill it in in `sage-update-version`.
(We assume that `envsubst` (from gettext) is installed - after all this
is the script for the release manager.

currently it is https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/repository/sagemath/sage#490dca58-642d-465a-876a-9d6272672b76-metadata
and I propose

    "creators": [

    ], 
    "access_right": "open",

            "relation": "isVersionOf"
        }
    ]
}
```

I don't know how much of the data should be in, i.e. would zenodo fill in e.g. version if we omit it in json.
