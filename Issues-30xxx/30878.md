This seems inconsistent to me:

```diff
-            h_vertices = [ list(v) + [1] for v in vertices ]
+            h_vertices = [list(v) + [1] for v in vertices]
```

```diff
-                dieq = [ ZZ(d*ieq_i) for ieq_i in ieq ]
+                dieq = [ ZZ(d * ieq_i) for ieq_i in ieq ]

well, I was tempted to remove (as suggested by flake8) all superfluous whitespace before or after brackets. But then I decide to try to keep the diff small, so I did that only once.
