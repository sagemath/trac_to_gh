This seems inconsistent to me:

```diff
-            h_vertices = [ list(v) + [1] for v in vertices ]
+            h_vertices = [list(v) + [1] for v in vertices]
```

```diff
-                dieq = [ ZZ(d*ieq_i) for ieq_i in ieq ]
+                dieq = [ ZZ(d * ieq_i) for ieq_i in ieq ]
```

I think `for i,j in enumerate...` is better to read than `for i, j in enumerate`,
but this might also be because I'm used to it and it seems to be against pep8.
