<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

This is actually an issue with the category framework:

```
sage: V = QQ^3
sage: V.category()
Category of finite dimensional vector spaces with basis over (number fields and quotient fields and normed rings)
sage: V in Modules.FiniteDimensional
True
```

So why is the category not over a base ring, that is because we didn't want to have to create a new category when we range over different finite fields. This caused a lot of slowdown. So we shifted to allowing the base ring of the category to instead be the category of the base ring.

What you are seeing here is a limitation of this. This is a little more tricky to work out as there is a bunch of technical issues with the containment checking, but it is something we want to do. It might be possible to hack around it, but I don't see how from a quick look.
