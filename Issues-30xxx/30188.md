This ticket aims to modify `shortest_paths` method in `boost_graph.pyx` to take list of vertices as input. 
This will reduce the current scenario of converting a Sage graph to a Boost graph and then computing shortest paths for each required vertex.

Please add your full name in the "Authors" field.

Please set to `needs_review` when ready for review.

Use one more f-string:

```
-            raise ValueError("the starting vertex " + str(v) + " is not in " +
-                             "the graph")
+            raise ValueError(f"the starting vertex {v} is not in the graph")
```

Maybe wrap long lines, for instance:

```
-                        raise RuntimeError("Dijkstra algorithm does not work with negative weights, use Bellman-Ford instead")
+                        raise RuntimeError("Dijkstra algorithm does not "
+                                           "work with negative weights, "
+                                           "use Bellman-Ford instead")
```

Maybe remove unnecessary parentheses:

```
-    return (distances, predecessors)
+    return distances, predecessors
```

I have one query regarding the documentation of `shortest_path` method in `boost_graph.pyx`. It mentions that

```
    Note that, if the graph is undirected, a negative edge automatically creates
    a negative cycle: for this reason, in this case, Dijkstra algorithm is
    always better.
```

I dont understand since there is already negative weight, then why to use dijkstra. And further, in such graphs shortest path computation may not be possible to negative cycle.

I have added documentation.

One thing, I would like to mention is that when `vertext_list` contains only one vertex, I have returned two dicts, instead of two dicts of dict. I have done so to keep uniformity in output from our method and current `shortest_path` method. So that in future, it will be easy for use to replace `shortest_path` method.

```diff

What I don't like here is that the method returns dict of dicts. A least a matrix would be a better choice. If the graph is large, it's a huge waste of time and space :(

I was hoping maybe we could return dict instead of dict of dict. And in that dict key values will be vertex in vertex list. And item value will be a list or vector storing distances[v] in order of list(g). Meaning distances[v][i] will return shortest distance between v and list(g)[i].

Similarly for predecessor.

Is it ok? 

P.S.- we can do similar thing with matrix. But i just feel that this will be nice way.

I have made the return type as list of lists. Now `for i, v in enumerate(vertex_list): distances[i] and predecessors[i] will give us the shortest path information from v`.

Although, one thing I would like to mention is following scenario - 

```
Current output using list of lists
sage: G = Graph(5)
sage: shortest_paths_from_vertices(G,0)
([[0, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity]],
 [[None, None, None, None, None]])

```

```
when returning dict of dict
sage: shortest_paths(G,0)
({0: 0}, {0: None})
```

Clearly, there is a need of extra memory in list of lists in case of disconnected graphs.

One bug that i encountered is:

```
sage: G = Graph([ (0,1,2), (1,2,0.7)], weighted = True)
sage: shortest_paths_from_vertices(G, 0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> 2314                 dist_v.append(correct_type(result.distances[vert]))
   2315                 pred = result.predecessors[vert]
   2316                 if pred != vert:

    687 
    688             elif isinstance(x, pari_gen):

TypeError: Cannot convert non-integral float to integer

```

I guess, we have to remove code of correct_type.

<div id="comment:25" align="right">Comment 25</div>

Goal of this ticket is avoid format conversion (from sage graph to boost graph) for each vertex during `shortest_path_all_pairs` computation or other such method in `generic_graph.py`.  For e.g, see the following code - 

```
    from sage.graphs.base.boost_graph import shortest_paths
    dist = dict()
    pred = dict()
    for u in self:
        dist[u], pred[u] = shortest_paths(self, u, weight_function, algorithm)
    return dist, pred
```

Here `shortest_paths` of `boost_graph.pyx` is called for each vertex and hence format conversion time for each vertex.

This ticket aims to implement a method in `boost_graph.pyx` and take list of vertices as input and return `shortest_path` information for each vertex. Thus avoid conversion overhead.

Our current method `shortest_path_from_vertices` in `boost_graph.pyx` does that.

I hope it clear your doubt about purpose of the ticket :)

I think we can do it as follows in methods calling this method for retreiving path information -

```
distances , predecessors = shortest_path_from_vertices(G, vertex_list)
for i, v in enumerate(vertex_list):
    dist_v = distances[i]
    pred_v = predecessors[i]
    
    for id, vertex in enumerate(G):
       distance of vertex from v  = dist_v[id]
       predecessor of vertex in shortest_path from v = pred_v[id]
```

Will it work?

+
+    However, Dijkstra algorithm is more efficient: for this reason, we suggest
+    to use Bellman-Ford only if necessary (which is also the default option).
```
- in the inout blocks, when the sentences are short, the convention is to not end with `.`, e.g.,

```diff
-    - ``order`` -- list (default: ``None``); order of vertices of `g`.
+    - ``order`` -- list (default: ``None``); order of vertices of `g`
```
  of course, if you have a paragraph with several sentences, a final `.` is needed
- again avoid `:` in ` Two possible outputs:`. You can write for instead `The type of output depends on the input. More precisely,` 

- this is simpler and more efficient

```diff
-           for vertex in g:
-                if vertex not in order:
-                    raise ValueError("Given ordering is not valid")
+            if any(v not in g for v in order:
+                raise ValueError("Given ordering is not valid")
```
  indeed, since `order` is a list, the test `vertex not in order` has time complexity in `O(n)`, while testing `v not in g` takes constant time (I hope)

Tried this 

```diff
 +            if any(v not in g for v in order:
 +                raise ValueError("Given ordering is not valid")
```

but it gave the following error `closures inside cpdef functions not yet supported`.
