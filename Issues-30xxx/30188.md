This ticket aims to modify `shortest_paths` method in `boost_graph.pyx` to take list of vertices as input. 
This will reduce the current scenario of converting a Sage graph to a Boost graph and then computing shortest paths for each required vertex.

Use one more f-string:

```
-            raise ValueError("the starting vertex " + str(v) + " is not in " +
-                             "the graph")

Maybe wrap long lines, for instance:

```
-                        raise RuntimeError("Dijkstra algorithm does not work with negative weights, use Bellman-Ford instead")
+                        raise RuntimeError("Dijkstra algorithm does not "

+                                           "use Bellman-Ford instead")
```

Maybe remove unnecessary parentheses:

```
-    return (distances, predecessors)
+    return distances, predecessors
```

I have added documentation.

One thing, I would like to mention is that when `vertext_list` contains only one vertex, I have returned two dicts, instead of two dicts of dict. I have done so to keep uniformity in output from our method and current `shortest_path` method. So that in future, it will be easy for use to replace `shortest_path` method.

```diff

```diff

```

* Why this comment ?

```diff

* define types of variables `distances`, `predecessors`, `pred_v`, etc.


What I don't like here is that the method returns dict of dicts. A least a matrix would be a better choice. If the graph is large, it's a huge waste of time and space :(

> What I don't like here is that the method returns dict of dicts. A least a matrix would be a better choice. If the graph is large, it's a huge waste of time and space :(


I was hoping maybe we could return dict instead of dict of dict. And in that dict key values will be vertex in vertex list. And item value will be a list or vector storing distances[v] in order of list(g). Meaning distances[v][i] will return shortest distance between v and list(g)[i].

Similarly for predecessor.

Is it ok? 

P.S.- we can do similar thing with matrix. But i just feel that this will be nice way.

I have made the return type as list of lists. Now `for i, v in enumerate(vertex_list): distances[i] and predecessors[i] will give us the shortest path information from v`.

Although, one thing I would like to mention is following scenario - 

```
Current output using list of lists
sage: G = Graph(5)
sage: shortest_paths_from_vertices(G,0)
([[0, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity, +Infinity]],
 [[None, None, None, None, None]])

```

```
when returning dict of dict
sage: shortest_paths(G,0)
({0: 0}, {0: None})
```

Clearly, there is a need of extra memory in list of lists in case of disconnected graphs.

One bug that i encountered is:

```
sage: G = Graph([ (0,1,2), (1,2,0.7)], weighted = True)
sage: shortest_paths_from_vertices(G, 0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   2315                 pred = result.predecessors[vert]
   2316                 if pred != vert:

    687 
    688             elif isinstance(x, pari_gen):

TypeError: Cannot convert non-integral float to integer

```

I guess, we have to remove code of correct_type.

<a id='comment:24'></a>Honestly, I'm not completely sure of what the method does and it's objective. Can you clarify how you plan to use it and where. I'm not sure it does exactly what is needed.

<a id='comment:25'></a>Goal of this ticket is avoid format conversion (from sage graph to boost graph) for each vertex during `shortest_path_all_pairs` computation or other such method in `generic_graph.py`.  For e.g, see the following code -

```

Here `shortest_paths` of `boost_graph.pyx` is called for each vertex and hence format conversion time for each vertex.

This ticket aims to implement a method in `boost_graph.pyx` and take list of vertices as input and return `shortest_path` information for each vertex. Thus avoid conversion overhead.

Our current method `shortest_path_from_vertices` in `boost_graph.pyx` does that.

I hope it clear your doubt about purpose of the ticket :)

I think we can do it as follows in methods calling this method for retreiving path information -

```
distances , predecessors = shortest_path_from_vertices(G, vertex_list)
for i, v in enumerate(vertex_list):
    dist_v = distances[i]
    pred_v = predecessors[i]
    
    for id, vertex in enumerate(G):
       distance of vertex from v  = dist_v[id]
       predecessor of vertex in shortest_path from v = pred_v[id]
```

Will it work?

If that's the case then, we can return`list of dicts`, although it will be slow, but it will be an overall improvement on current scenario. 

I will add a note about in meta-ticket.

<a id='comment:32'></a>We are almost done

- to avoid potential issues when building the doc, avoid `:` in

```
+    The input graph can be weighted: if the algorithm is Dijkstra, no negative
+    weights are allowed, while if the algorithm is Bellman-Ford, negative
+    weights are allowed, but there must be no negative cycle (otherwise, the
+    shortest paths might not exist).
+
+    However, Dijkstra algorithm is more efficient: for this reason, we suggest
+    to use Bellman-Ford only if necessary (which is also the default option).
```
- in the inout blocks, when the sentences are short, the convention is to not end with `.`, e.g.,

```diff
-    - ``order`` -- list (default: ``None``); order of vertices of `g`.
+    - ``order`` -- list (default: ``None``); order of vertices of `g`
```
  of course, if you have a paragraph with several sentences, a final `.` is needed
- again avoid `:` in ` Two possible outputs:`. You can write for instead `The type of output depends on the input. More precisely,` 

- this is simpler and more efficient

```diff
-           for vertex in g:
-                if vertex not in order:
-                    raise ValueError("Given ordering is not valid")
+            if any(v not in g for v in order:
+                raise ValueError("Given ordering is not valid")
```
  indeed, since `order` is a list, the test `vertex not in order` has time complexity in `O(n)`, while testing `v not in g` takes constant time (I hope)

Tried this 

```diff

```

but it gave the following error `closures inside cpdef functions not yet supported`.
