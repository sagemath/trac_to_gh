From #27103#comment:10

A small improvement that speeds up the current popcount.

Before:

```
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(8, backend='field')                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
sage: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
sage: %time C.is_simple()

With this ticket:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
sage: %time C.is_simple()                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
CPU times: user 334 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 334 µs
Wall time: 336 µs
True
```

Eventually combinatorial polyhedron should use `data_structures/bitset.pxi`, but not before #27122 is merged.
