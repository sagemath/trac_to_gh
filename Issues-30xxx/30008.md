`sage-system-python` is the Python that we use to download and unpack upstream archives.  We allow a very wide range of Python versions.

After #30053 undid the change in #29033, we are again running into locale / encoding problems with early (pre-3.7) versions of Python used as `sage-system-python`.

This is a blocker ticket for Sage 9.2 because it is a severe regression in platform support compared to Sage 9.1.

See e.g. https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/811777719?check_suite_focus=true

But now (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1141520147) we see it for `ubuntu-trusty-minimal` (where `sage-system-python` is python 3.4).

We fix this problem by making locale fixes in the `sage-system-python` script. See e.g. https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1142310012 for a run with the present ticket.

According to this

https://www.noreplied.com/how-to-fixed-cannot-change-locale-utf-8-error-in-centos-7/

one should add `LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"` to `/etc/environment`. Very unsatisfying fix for someone without root privileges.

This appears to be a bug with centos 7, which is merely exposed now.

`build/bin/sage-system-python` finds the Python that we use for downloading and unpacking packages. 

It is unrelated to the python that we try to find in `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4` (which rejects Python 3.6 after #30053).

`build/bin/sage-system-python` can use any of the Pythons listed in `build/tox.ini`. In particular, it can be an early 3.x series Python. For these, `LC_ALL=C` disables UTF-8 operation, which causes the errors described on this ticket. 

Look at the GH Actions links in the ticket description to see it in action.

Why again are we trying to extract a tarball with python?

The problem here isn't really the `C` locale, it's that Sphinx ships files with non-ascii characters in them...

```
$ ls tests/roots/test-images/ | tail -n 1
-rw-r--r-- 1 mjo mjo  65K 2020-08-13 11:46 testimäge.png
```

and we don't specify an encoding, which ultimately leaves it up to the locale.

Ignoring the fact that reimplementing this is absurd, we should be able to set the filename encoding to utf8 here without touching the locale at all.

I'm not willing to install a version of python from 2014 to test it, but setting `tarfile.ENCODING = 'utf-8'` probably solves this in a much better way, since we know what the encoding is.

You don't have to. We have the GH Actions to test it. The link with the runs and results is in the "Reviewer field".

The specific problem is that if someone puts a `LC_ALL=C`, the default encodings are set to ASCII. This is what causes the breakage, and this is what the current ticket fixes.

Needs review.

Setting the locale to `C` causes the default guess to be wrong, but we *know* the correct encoding. And the `utf-8` encoding is available "everywhere," unlike the locales that we're guessing at in your branch.

It is very localized, and it undoes the damage done by #30053's `sage-spkg` doing exactly what you seem to be criticizing here - namely setting the system locale for all its subprocesses.

This is of course a good point. We can just decide that our tarballs have utf-8 pathnames.  I will test the approach with setting `tarfile.ENCODING`.

Nevertheless, removing the `C` locale setting in `sage-system-python` would still be good because there could be other parts that are affected by this unsuitable setting.

Yes, it was a good change for that ticket, which is why I agreed with the change there.

But it affects the Pythons that run below it.
(1) the `sage-system-python` - which the present ticket addresses
(2) the python3 from which we build our venv -- which is yet to be addressed in #30576 if we want to support python 3.6.
