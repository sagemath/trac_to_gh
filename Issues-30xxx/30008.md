`sage-system-python` is the Python that we use to download and unpack upstream archives.  We allow a very wide range of Python versions.

After #30053 undid the change in #29033, we are again running into locale / encoding problems with early (pre-3.7) versions of Python used as `sage-system-python`.

This is a blocker ticket for Sage 9.2 because it is a severe regression in platform support compared to Sage 9.1.

See e.g. https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/811777719?check_suite_focus=true

But now (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1141520147) we see it for `ubuntu-trusty-minimal` (where `sage-system-python` is python 3.4).

We fix this problem by making locale fixes in the `sage-system-python` script. See e.g. https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1142310012 for a run with the present ticket.

According to this

https://www.noreplied.com/how-to-fixed-cannot-change-locale-utf-8-error-in-centos-7/

one should add `LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"` to `/etc/environment`. Very unsatisfying fix for someone without root privileges.

This appears to be a bug with centos 7, which is merely exposed now.

`build/bin/sage-system-python` finds the Python that we use for downloading and unpacking packages. 

It is unrelated to the python that we try to find in `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4` (which rejects Python 3.6 after #30053).

`build/bin/sage-system-python` can use any of the Pythons listed in `build/tox.ini`. In particular, it can be an early 3.x series Python. For these, `LC_ALL=C` disables UTF-8 operation, which causes the errors described on this ticket. 

Look at the GH Actions links in the ticket description to see it in action.

Why again are we trying to extract a tarball with python?

The problem here isn't really the `C` locale, it's that Sphinx ships files with non-ascii characters in them...

```
$ ls tests/roots/test-images/ | tail -n 1
-rw-r--r-- 1 mjo mjo  65K 2020-08-13 11:46 testimäge.png
```

and we don't specify an encoding, which ultimately leaves it up to the locale.

Ignoring the fact that reimplementing this is absurd, we should be able to set the filename encoding to utf8 here without touching the locale at all.

Yes, it was a good change for that ticket, which is why I agreed with the change there.

But it affects the Pythons that run below it.
(1) the `sage-system-python` - which the present ticket addresses
(2) the python3 from which we build our venv -- which is yet to be addressed in #30576 if we want to support python 3.6.

I have:

```
$ build/bin/sage-system-python --version
Python 2.7.17
```

I don't know how to properly review this ticket. With ubuntu-bionic 18.04, I do not have problem. So what I can do is to check that with the branch, I still don't have a problem. Should I do some kind of make distclean? For now, I just pulled that branch on top of freshly built beta13, and I am currently running make ptestlong. Will report later.

tell me how to shadow, I will try that tomorrow. How can I make `sage-system-python` to use:

```

Indeed, the above shadowing method works:

```
$ build/bin/sage-system-python --version
Python 3.6.9
```
I can now reproduce the issue with Ubuntu 18.04 + 9.2.beta13 and I confirm that the current branch fixes it.
