For 9.4, we hope to automate it in #30306; but for Sage 9.3, perhaps we can at least explain to the user what needs to be done.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

Works for me under Linux (locally) :

* `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` is symlinked to `/usr/local/bin`, which is in my default `PATH`.
* FWIW, the "small scripts" (Maxima, GAP, Pari) also live there.
* Some Jupyter kernels (gap and pari) are installed via Sage's `pip`.
* `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath/` has been symlinked (by `root`) to the system's Jupyter kernel directory (ditto for gap and pari).

ISTR that, on another machine, I managed to install Sage's kernel via

```
sudo jupyter kernelspec install [path to the Sage kernel directory]
```
But I can't check that ATM.

Notes:
* I wasn't able to get Singular's jupyter kernel to work (neither in Sages's jupyter nor the systemwide jupyter)..
* This also works with jupyterlab
* A valuable addition would be Maxima's jupyter kernel ; unfortunately, it does not (currently) works with an ECL-based Maxima...

HTH,

Thanks to both of you. 

If you have chance, could you check / comment whether the following work in this configuration:
- interacts (most recently, #30246 added support for them in JupyterLab)
- 3D graphics with `threejs` (in particular with `online=False`) or `jsmol` in the notebook / JupyterLab
- mathjax in the notebook / JupyterLab

What do you mean ? The "standard" use of mathjax in Makdown cells ? That works as smoothly in the systemwide Jupyter as in  Sage's Jupyter.

Or do you mean interpolation in a text cell of a Sage-generated value ?

Great question, I am not actually sure. But `src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py` (`use_local_mathjax`) installs a copy of mathjax in Sage's jupyter - and the `jupyter kernelspec install` command does not copy that over to the system jupyter if I'm not mistaken.

In the **Jupyter** notebook, updating a worksheet created in Sage's notebook :

* Mathjax in markdown cells : OK
* Interacts : the graph is diplayed with the interact's default value, the slider is not displayed (I get a 404 in the console where I launched !Jupyter)
* 3D plot with default viewer : works (threjs)
* 3D plot with lmol : blank space (and a 404 in the console)
* 3D plot with jsmol : warning, and plot displayed with threejs.

I uploaded the sheet and a capture of console output/error (`Essai interact.tar.gz`).

Thanks very much!

Could you repeat the 3D plotting experiment with `online=False`, for example using `sphere(online=False)`?

For the Sage interacts, one needs the pip-installable package `widgetsnbextension`.
It would be best to recommend to users to install it as a system package (see https://repology.org/projects/?search=widgetsnbextension); if not available, it can be installed by pip.

It doesn't : both `jupyter-nbextension-jupyter-js-widgets` and `python3-widgetsnbextension` were already installed :

```

From `apt-cache show python3-widgetsnbextension` :

    This package should *not be necessary* for Debian software to use; instead you
    should directly use the jupyter-nbextension-jupyter-js-widgets package. It is
    provided only for compatibility with non-Debian software.

I am finding that wording a bit convoluted - and not a usual English formulation (yes I know that criticism comes from a French person)

```
For the full functionality of the SageMath kernel in your global
Jupyter installation, additionally some Notebook Extension packages
need to be installed (or linked) into the environment from which the
Jupyter installation runs.
```

I would suggest to replace it by something along the lines of

```
To get the full functionality of the SageMath kernel in your global 
Jupyter installation, the following Notebook Extension packages also 
need to be installed (or linked) in the environment from which the
Jupyter installation runs.
```

A native English speaker may want to polish it a bit.

It is otherwise quite good and would give it a positive review.
