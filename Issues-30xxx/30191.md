At this stage, the conversion

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: M.diff_form_module(1)(1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_domain'
```
fails with an `AttributeError`.

This should rather yield a `NotImplementedError` or `TypeError` with the message that there is no conversion available.

This should be better. When the user inserts a list for `comp`, I guess we can assume that the user knows what he/she is doing.

Furthermore, I have replaced the `isinstance(comp, (int, Integer))` checks with `comp in ZZ` all over the files. This is more appropriate and easier to read, I think.

Please let me know if I have overlooked something.

Two things to be aware:

```diff
-        if comp:
+        if comp != []:
```
This will not only be slower, but more restrictive (it doesn't cover tuples). Is there some explicit reason why you are changing this? If so, you need to insert a comment about this as it is very likely that it will be removed later on.

Checking `x in ZZ` means `x` can be rational numbers like `2/1` and is slower than `isinstance(x, (int, Integer))`. The pollution of your data by rationals (and other others like `SR` elements, polynomial rings, etc.) masquerading as integers is possible, which might result in strange error messages later on, such as an `AttributeError` because it is expecting an `Integer`.

I see. For the conversion itself, I think the `in ZZ` is preferrable. Also, there is nothing to worry about.

One first example that comes to my mind is having a zero in `GF(p)`, or any other incompatible ring. Even though this is a zero, it is *not* an element compatible to a tensor field.

Secondly, I am not sure if all objects outside of the coercion framework, i.e. not even having an algebraic structure, always yield `False` for `comp == 0`.

You could either call it ducktyping or a conversion, but I don't see the point in this test. Also, there is this:

```
sage: GF(5).zero() in ZZ
True
sage: GF(5).zero() == 0
True
```

> Secondly, I am not sure if all objects outside of the coercion framework, i.e. not even having an algebraic structure, always yield `False` for `comp == 0`.

All of the reasonable things (lists, tuples, sets, etc.) compare with `False`. If someone wants to put some garbage in, then they should expect garbage out (or breakage). So I wouldn't worry that.

Interesting. This is not a mathematical rigorous behavior, is it?

Anyway, this seems hold true for the polynomial ring and the rational numbers, too. Then the `in ZZ` check is indeed redundant.

Fair enough. :D

That was quite convincing. I will remove the `in ZZ` check.

What about checking these cases separately then? We could try a fast check with `is_trivial_zero` prior to the usual check. Meaning something like this:

```diff
-        if isinstance(comp, (int, Integer)) and comp == 0:
+        if hasattr(comp, 'is_trivial_zero'):
+            if comp.is_trivial_zero():
+                return self.zero()
+        elif comp == 0:
+            return self.zero()
```

This would cover more potential cases without decreasing the speed. Or is the `hasattr` check slow?

**Addendum:** Since `hasattr` just seems to catch the error, this one might be better:

```diff
-        if isinstance(comp, (int, Integer)) and comp == 0:
+        try:
+            if comp.is_trivial_zero():
+                return self.zero()
+        except AttributeError:
+            if comp == 0:
+                return self.zero()
```

I would vote for the try-except. In any case, using `is_trivial_zero` is a good idea, because if an object is generically slow in comparing to zero, one might expect that it is endowed with a `is_trivial_zero` method. For sure this is the case for `SR` elements.

Apparently, this isn't consistently implemented. For example:

```
sage: GF(5).zero() in SR
False
```

The conversion fails, too:

```
sage: SR(GF(5).zero())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: positive characteristic not allowed in symbolic computations
```


Notice that our setup is closer to the symbolic ring than the ring of integers.

So, should I keep the things like we have discussed, or do we want to overthink the behavior again?

I, personally, have no strong opinion on that. However, I'd prefer a consistent behavior as much as possible.

I think this is good. I might make one additional change in `MixedFormAlgebra`:

```diff
+        if comp is None:
+            return self.element_class(self, name=name, latex_name=latex_name)
         try:
             if comp.is_trivial_zero():
                 return self.zero()
             if (comp - 1).is_trivial_zero():
                 return self.one()
         except AttributeError:
             if comp == 0:
                 return self.zero()
             if comp == 1:
                 return self.one()
         res = self.element_class(self, name=name, latex_name=latex_name)
-        if comp is None:
-            return res
```
That way the `comp` being none gets the priority as I would guess that is the more likely possibility. However, you know what is the more likely inputs, and this is a bit closer to bikeshedding anyways.

I don't think the `None` check is even necessary:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: M.mixed_form_algebra()()
Mixed differential form zero on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

I think, the first input is already mandatory no matter what:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: M.mixed_form_algebra()(comp=None)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: _element_constructor_() got multiple values for argument 'comp'
```

I am not sure what happens here. Probably that is the coercion framework handling the process.

I would say we remove this check. I don't see in which cases it might give a shortcut.

It actually is a slightly annoying issue that has appeared elsewhere in Sage. The problem is the initial `__call__` of the mixed form algebra `A` requires at least one input `x` defaulting to `0`. So what happens here is a call of `A._element_constructor_(x, comp=None)`. Try `A(None)`, `A()`, and `ZZ()`.

There is some reason for this IIRC; I think it has to do with the coercion framework and needing to create a default element to test stuff with. However, things might have evolved enough where this is not a necessity anymore, but that definitely deserves a separate ticket.

> I would say we remove this check. I don't see in which cases it might give a shortcut.

It ensures, also for the user, that the element he/she gets is already completely well-defined and ready for use.

> It actually is a slightly annoying issue that has appeared elsewhere in Sage. The problem is the initial `__call__` of the mixed form algebra `A` requires at least one input `x` defaulting to `0`. So what happens here is a call of `A._element_constructor_(x, comp=None)`. Try `A(None)`, `A()`, and `ZZ()`.

Thinking about it, this behavior is not unreasonable, is it? It ensures, also for the user, that the element he/she gets is already completely well-defined and ready for use. If one needs a "unprepared" element so badly, one can still use `element_class`, as it is performed e.g. in `M.tensor_field`.

Anyways, this should be discussed elsewhere, yes.

At least w.r.t. the behavior we have encountered.

The doctests fail because:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    if (comp - 1).is_trivial_zero():
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'list' and 'int'
```

Not surprising. Any suggestions?
