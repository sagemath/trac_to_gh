fails with an `AttributeError`.

This should rather yield a `NotImplementedError` or `TypeError` with the message that there is no conversion available.

This will not only be slower, but more restrictive (it doesn't cover tuples). Is there some explicit reason why you are changing this? If so, you need to insert a comment about this as it is very likely that it will be removed later on.

Checking `x in ZZ` means `x` can be rational numbers like `2/1` and is slower than `isinstance(x, (int, Integer))`.

I see. For the conversion itself, I think the `in ZZ` is preferrable. Also, there is nothing to worry about.

You could either call it ducktyping or a conversion, but I don't see the point in this test. Also, there is this:

```
sage: GF(5).zero() in ZZ
True
sage: GF(5).zero() == 0
True
```

All of the reasonable things (lists, tuples, sets, etc.) compare with `False`. If someone wants to put some garbage in, then they should expect garbage out (or breakage). So I wouldn't worry that.

Interesting. This is not a mathematical rigorous behavior, is it?

Anyway, this seems hold true for the polynomial ring and the rational numbers, too. Then the `in ZZ` check is indeed redundant.

Fair enough. :D

That was quite convincing. I will remove the `in ZZ` check.

What about checking these cases separately then? We could try a fast check with `is_trivial_zero` prior to the usual check. Meaning something like this:

```diff
-        if isinstance(comp, (int, Integer)) and comp == 0:
+        if hasattr(comp, 'is_trivial_zero'):
+            if comp.is_trivial_zero():
+                return self.zero()
+        elif comp == 0:
+            return self.zero()
```

This would cover more potential cases without decreasing the speed. Or is the `hasattr` check slow?

**Addendum:** Since `hasattr` just seems to catch the error, this one might be better:

```diff
-        if isinstance(comp, (int, Integer)) and comp == 0:
+        try:
+            if comp.is_trivial_zero():
+                return self.zero()
+        except AttributeError:
+            if comp == 0:
+                return self.zero()
```

I would vote for the try-except. In any case, using `is_trivial_zero` is a good idea, because if an object is generically slow in comparing to zero, one might expect that it is endowed with a `is_trivial_zero` method. For sure this is the case for `SR` elements.

Apparently, this isn't consistently implemented. For example:

```
sage: GF(5).zero() in SR
False
```

The conversion fails, too:

```
sage: SR(GF(5).zero())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: positive characteristic not allowed in symbolic computations
```


Notice that our setup is closer to the symbolic ring than the ring of integers.

So, should I keep the things like we have discussed, or do we want to overthink the behavior again?

I, personally, have no strong opinion on that. However, I'd prefer a consistent behavior as much as possible.

<a id='comment:41'></a>I think this is good. I might make one additional change in `MixedFormAlgebra`:

```diff
+        if comp is None:
+            return self.element_class(self, name=name, latex_name=latex_name)
         try:
             if comp.is_trivial_zero():
                 return self.zero()
             if (comp - 1).is_trivial_zero():
                 return self.one()
         except AttributeError:
             if comp == 0:
                 return self.zero()
             if comp == 1:
                 return self.one()
         res = self.element_class(self, name=name, latex_name=latex_name)
-        if comp is None:
-            return res
```
That way the `comp` being none gets the priority as I would guess that is the more likely possibility. However, you know what is the more likely inputs, and this is a bit closer to bikeshedding anyways.

I don't think the `None` check is even necessary:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: M.mixed_form_algebra()()
Mixed differential form zero on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

I think, the first input is already mandatory no matter what:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: M.mixed_form_algebra()(comp=None)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: _element_constructor_() got multiple values for argument 'comp'
```

I am not sure what happens here. Probably that is the coercion framework handling the process.

I would say we remove this check. I don't see in which cases it might give a shortcut.

It actually is a slightly annoying issue that has appeared elsewhere in Sage. The problem is the initial `__call__` of the mixed form algebra `A` requires at least one input `x` defaulting to `0`. So what happens here is a call of `A._element_constructor_(x, comp=None)`. Try `A(None)`, `A()`, and `ZZ()`.

There is some reason for this IIRC; I think it has to do with the coercion framework and needing to create a default element to test stuff with. However, things might have evolved enough where this is not a necessity anymore, but that definitely deserves a separate ticket.

> I would say we remove this check. I don't see in which cases it might give a shortcut.

Thinking about it, this behavior is not unreasonable, is it? It ensures, also for the user, that the element he/she gets is already completely well-defined and ready for use. If one needs a "unprepared" element so badly, one can still use `element_class`, as it is performed e.g. in `M.tensor_field`.

Anyways, this should be discussed elsewhere, yes.

At least w.r.t. the behavior we have encountered.
