We add a method to compute the treelength of a graph. This measure of tree-likeness express how the metric structure of a graph is close to a tree metric.

Some implementation choices:
- Check if the input graph is chordal (treelength 1)
- Use decomposition by clique minimal separators as preprocessing, and so compute only the treelength of the atoms of the graph.
- Use isomorphisms between atoms to avoid computing the treelength of isomorphic atoms.
- Implement a specific class to compute the treelength of an atom (which is working for all graphs but without pre-processing)
- The main algorithm is an adaptation of algorithm `'sage'` for treewidth.

I know Matthias would like the `from sage.functions.other import ceil` import to be in the method that uses it to help him with the Sage modularization.

The text for `OUTPUT:` and `ALGORITHM:` should not be indented.

In `treelength()` and `_treelength()`, do you want to give some of your variables type information? For example, isn't `cc` a `set`?

Shouldn't `__destroy__` be `__dealloc__`?

<a id='comment:21'></a>It is picking up the internal functions:

```
travis@apricot:~/sage-build$ ./sage --coverage src/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/tree_decomposition.pyx 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE src/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/tree_decomposition.pyx: 78.6% (11 of 14)

Missing documentation:
     * line 1077: def rec(cut, cc)
     * line 1172: def good_label(x)
     * line 1175: def good_label(x)
```
so it's fine. My guess is this is a bug in the coverage script by not filtering them out properly because they are within a `cdef` function.
