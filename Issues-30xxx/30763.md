```
The `__call__` method of global options is used as getter and setter. This ticket improves this method to properly handle values of `None`.

For example:

```python
sage: from sage.structure.global_options import GlobalOptions
sage: class config(GlobalOptions):
....:     size = dict(default=42,
....:                 description='integer or None',
....:                 checker=lambda val: val is None or val >= 0)
sage: config.size(None)  # this should set the option to `None`
42
```
(See #30755 for an actual example where `None` is used as a value.)

This can be used as a workaround instead:

```python
sage: config.size = None
sage: config.size() is None
True
```

This ticket makes `config.size(None)` work as a setter. Additionally, a deprecation is added for the keyword-argument syntax `config.size(value=None)`, as it is not usually used and this will simplify the implementation a little.
