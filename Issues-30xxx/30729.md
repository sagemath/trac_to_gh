in GAP 4.10 the cohomolo's Makefile.in does not have a [line](https://github.com/gap-packages/cohomolo/blob/8f7340a5b604fc70db890ca64b68fcfade0c0c21/Makefile.in#L19)

```
EXTRA_CFLAGS += -Wno-implicit-function-declaration
```

which is present in GAP 4.11 - so probably the quickest patch would be to add it in GAP 4.10.
(I started on fixing the code itself, but it's a nontrivial amount of changes).

I've learned about group permissions and did

```
setfacl -m "default:group::rwx" objects
```

Strange that ACL utils were not installed on the box, so I don't know how it worked before I messed it up...
