```
With Sage 9.2.beta9, and some optional pip packages installed, the command

```
$ sage --optional
```

is broken, giving warnings such as:

```
[package]...............................[latest version] ([version])
.../local/lib/python.../site-packages/sage/misc/package.py:120: UserWarning: failed to fetch the version of pkg='pyx' at https://pypi.python.org/pypi
  warnings.warn("failed to fetch the version of pkg={!r} at {}".format(pkg, pypi_url))
...
```

This ticket updates the `DEFAULT_PYPI` url in `src/sage/misc/package.py`. This makes `sage --optional` work properly again.

In passing we update a few more urls and the FAQ
on contributing to Sage: mentions of patches from the
pre-Sage-6.0 Mercurial-based workflow are replaced by
mentions of branches corresponding to our current
Git-based workflow.

Main task here: fix `DEFAULT_PYPI` url in `src/sage/misc/package.py`.

Sorry I failed at that. Please help me figure it out.

I went for fixing PyPI urls in any file that had them,
and for fixing other urls in those files; maybe that
goes to a different ticket. Feel free to simplify here.

Any further documentation updates are welcome but
