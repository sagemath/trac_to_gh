packaging 20.5 throws lots of deprecation warnings

```
/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/packaging/version.py:127: DeprecationWarning: Creating a LegacyVersion has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release
```
when called from setuptools when building the module index (which happens indirectly eg. when calling sage_getdoc). We silence these warnings, since this is really out of sage's control (even if all of sage's python packages were fixed, this could still be triggered by packages installed with sage-pip, or by any other python package in the case of distro packages)
