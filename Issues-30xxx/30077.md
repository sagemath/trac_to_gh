LGTM.

Things are going fairly well. In the middle of finals still, but that is almost over. The state's borders reopened ahead of schedule this past weekend (however Melbourne is not doing so well right now). I am now ready for my poster at FPSAC. Although the big thing I am (still) waiting for is the international border to reopen.

How are things for you?
