In `graphs.OrthogonalDualPolarGraph` if the parameter `q` is an `int`, then python converts the intersection size to a float and GAP complains about it:

```sage
sage: graphs.OrthogonalDualPolarGraph(1, 3, int(2))
...
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute '_libgap_init_'
```

This is fixed by using integer division `//`.
