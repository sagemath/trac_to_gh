1. Try typing `view(2/3)` in a Jupyter notebook.  
2. No visible output appears.

I don't think ever worked in Jupyter, but it did in sagenb.  This is one of those things that got forgotten (?) when switching from sagenb to Jupyter.  

Under the hood what happens looks like this:

```
sage: sage.misc.latex.EMBEDDED_MODE = True
sage: view(2/3)
<html><script type="math/tex">\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}\frac{2}{3}</script></html>
```

I think this <html> thing in the output is something I made up long long ago to signal that the output should be displayed as HTML.  In Jupyter, one instead uses 

```
from IPython.core.display import HTML
HTML(r'<script type="math/tex">\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}\frac{2}{3}</script>')
```

And the above does properly show a fraction.

So a slightly rewrite of view to work with Jupyter (and probably not with sagenb) is the way to go?

It works for me too with Sage 9.3.rc0: `view(2/3)` generates a pdf file, which is automatically opened by the default pdf viewer of my system (evince). This is with Firefox 86.0.1 on Ubuntu 20.04.
