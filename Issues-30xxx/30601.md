We move `bitset.pxi` to `bitset_base.pxd`.

So far `bitset.pxi` contained mostly inline functions for the header but also a few functions that cannot be inlined due to optional arguments.

Modern Cython uses `range`, so

```diff
-    for i from 0 <= i < bits.size:
+    for i in range(bits.size):
         s[i] = one if bitset_in(bits, i) else zero
```
If you could make these changes where appropriate, that would be good. Beyond that, LGTM.

Done.

I figured it was some old style usage.

Thank you.

You're probably right, but it was something I noticed from the diff and I didn't look too closely if it was a hold-over or an addition. (Although I do try and change these things when I do such changes, but that is me.)

Thank you.

I think `range` code is much more readable for a person coming from python, so I will change, when I stumble upon it.
