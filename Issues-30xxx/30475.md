Follow-up from #29651:

The approach of `SingleFileBuilder`, creating a symlink to the source file, is not compatible with `from .module import`.

Example:

```
$ ./sage -docbuild file=src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py html 
[html     ] building [html]: targets for 1 source files that are out of date
[html     ] updating environment: [new config] 1 added, 0 changed, 0 removed
[html     ] WARNING: autodoc: failed to import module 'base'; the following exception was raised:
[html     ] attempted relative import with no known parent package
[html     ] writing additional pages...  searchdone
[html     ] copying static files... ... done
[html     ] dumping search index in English (code: en)... done
[html     ] The HTML pages are in ../../../../.sage/docbuild/base/output/html.
Error building the documentation.
```

Instead, we should infer the fully qualified module name from the file name (see for example #30452) and import this module.

Sorry for a naive question. What is the primary use of the single file doc builder? I didn't have an occasion to use it myself.

If the file is in the sage library, isn't it enough to use `sage -docbuild reference/discrete_geometry html` for `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py`, for instance?
