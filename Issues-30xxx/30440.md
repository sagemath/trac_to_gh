Keywords: sd111

Its recommended to check in some VS Code config files (which makes it easier for new users to start developing).

We configure it to use the Sage venv via the `configure`-generated symlink `SAGE_ROOT/venv` (from #32442)

The `.gitignore` configuration follows  https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/python,visualstudiocode

Well, a `.venv` according to this common convention would lie in `SAGE_ROOT/src/` or perhaps in `SAGE_ROOT/pkgs/sagemath-standard/`, i.e., at the root of a Python distribution tree -- not in `SAGE_ROOT`, so it's not just a matter of renaming.

To expand on this, I think it's better to reserve the common name `.venv` for user-created venvs (of which there can be many); and to use `SAGE_ROOT/venv` for "the" venv (= the one configured and built by the distribution).

Then we can document as "best practices" to work with a user-created venv for example as the target for pip-installing additional packages. This will be more robust than the current status quo, in which the venv is built by our special tooling, and users kind of can install additional stuff if they are careful.

This will be more robust than the current status quo, in which the venv is built by our special tooling, and users kind of can install additional stuff if they are careful.\n\n\nTo be honest, this sounds relatively complicated and confusing (as a 'normal' dev I don't really see the difference between \".venv\" and \"venv\"). Why not treat sage-the-distribution as just one of many ways to create a venv? For example, one could also add a `enable-pipenv` flag to make in which case pipenv is used to create the venv instead.

> Then we can document as "best practices" to work with a user-created venv for example as the target for pip-installing additional packages. This will be more robust than the current status quo, in which the venv is built by our special tooling, and users kind of can install additional stuff if they are careful.


To be honest, this sounds relatively complicated and confusing (as a 'normal' dev I don't really see the difference between ".venv" and "venv"). Why not treat sage-the-distribution as just one of many ways to create a venv? For example, one could also add a `enable-pipenv` flag to make in which case pipenv is used to create the venv instead. It would be strange if this then would create `venv` and `.venv`.

I know it's hard to explain in text - but I have trouble understanding how to do the
1st 2 items. (we can have a video call via google meet or so, so that I can see the screen and
the cursor...)

By `It should "just work"` - do you mean the jupyter thing?
Well, I can browse (and view, nicely) Sage's jupyter notebooks in vscode, but not run, as I don't see a way to select the right kernel, and it's now shown in the menu.

For the virtual env, you should have something like `Pytohn 3.8.10 ('venv': venv)` in the lower left corner 
![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/python/environments/selected-interpreter-status-bar.png)

With this ticket, this is now the default and can be changed as described in https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_select-and-activate-an-environment.


For testing, vscode should now look for pytests instead of the "Configure Python tests" window that you get normally after activating the test icon (with the red border)

![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/python/testing/test-explorer-no-tests.png)

For jupyter, it may work if you have jupter installed in the sage venv and then select it as the kernel as described here https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_create-or-open-a-jupyter-notebook.
There are also config options to do this by default, but I've not yet looked into this.
For basic things, this is working for me, but I'm not sure about e.g. sage syntax etc.

This time I started with opening the SAGE_ROOT "folder", clicked on "trust the author", and only after that, opened a Sage Jupyter notebook.

Now, the Sage kernel shows up in the kernel list, and if I choose it, then after a while (~10 sec or more, I thought it just hangs, at first) it loads and everything works.
Opening it next time is a bit faster. (I'm on a slow net now, and maybe it's phoning back?!).

Anyhow, these details (about opening folger and blessing it) should be added to wiki, or docs, something like this.

as vscode is getting dominant, hiding from the public that we have these binding in Sage is kind of silly.
