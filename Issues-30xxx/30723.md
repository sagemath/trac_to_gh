`giac` and some other packages can fail to build via `make giac` if Sage is using system versions of `openblas` and `gsl`. Doing `make toolchain` first fixes this, so we add `toolchain` to the dependencies.

Affected packages include `giac`, `fflas_ffpack`, `numpy`.

Component: **packages: standard**
