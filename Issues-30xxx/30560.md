As discussed in #30556, if `openssl` is enabled using `--enable-openssl` and neither `openssl` nor `python3` are available as system packages, this makes sure that `openssl` is built before `python3`.

If system openssl is found via #30557, then `--enable-openssl` does NOT trigger building openssl. Use `--enable-openssl --without-system-openssl` if this is desired.

Part of #21700 Meta-ticket: Declare "optional" dependencies of packages (a package manager's suggested/recommended packages)

This looks like it works, and the change makes sense. I couldn't completely test, though, since the `ssl` module for Python always seems to get built.

To test, I did `make distclean`. Then

```
$ ./configure --enable-openssl --with-system-python3=no
$ make
```
built `openssl` first and then `python3`, which is the point, right? Without this branch, these commands just build `python3`, not `openssl`.

Do I need to find a system on which Python's `ssl` module fails to build?

Right.

I think without this branch it should also have built `openssl`, just not necessarily before `python3`.
