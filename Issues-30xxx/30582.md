Importing Fedora patches to make the package compile with modern compilers.

Upstreaming a generalized version of
https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/-/blob/master/debian/patches/d0-rubiks.patch
by providing a configuration variable `RUBIKS_BINS_PREFIX` (in analogy to `NAUTY_BINS_PREFIX`) in `sage_conf`.

This now goes through the `Feature`s already defined for the rubiks executables.
