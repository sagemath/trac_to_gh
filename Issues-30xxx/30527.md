As a follow-up to #29500 (Install all Python packages via `pip wheel`, store wheels in `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/wheels`):

We create a [PEP 503](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/) compliant Simple Repository index in `$SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS`. Then users can create their virtual environment using tools such as `pipenv` `[This is the Trac macro *source* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#source-macro)` or `pip install --index-url`.

We do this using the command `dir2pi` from https://pypi.org/project/pip2pi/


Follow-up:
- #30578 - Add `src/requirements.txt` for installation of `sagelib` in a venv

Sage-the-distribution is a deployment mechanism.  Compiling all packages from source gives us full control and eliminates possible ABI problems from mixing prebuilt wheels that were compiled on different systems. Building from source also has advantages such as generating architecture-specific code (see #27122). 

> Is it because some packages have patches applied?


In some cases, yes, in other cases, just specific configuration.

I feel none of the advantages of wheels outlined in https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/ can really prove effective if wheels are rebuilt from code every time.

In my opinion, the build process of sage would immensely profit from all these advantages.

I prefer to think about this not as a question of improving "the" build process of sage, but to offer more options for building sage. This is for example also the purpose of the modularization plan outlined in #29705 - make modularized parts of the Sage library deployable via PyPI.
