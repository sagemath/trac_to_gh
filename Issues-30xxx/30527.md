As a follow-up to #29500 (Install all Python packages via `pip wheel`, store wheels in `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/wheels`):

We create a [PEP 503](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/) compliant Simple Repository index in `$SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS`. Then users can create their virtual environment using tools such as `pipenv` `[This is the Trac macro *source* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#source-macro)` or `pip install --index-url`.

We do this using the command `dir2pi` from https://pypi.org/project/pip2pi/


Follow-up:
- #30578 - Add `src/requirements.txt` for installation of `sagelib` in a venv

What is the reason that sage needs to build wheels for standard packages, and not just downloads them from pypi?

Is it because some packages have patches applied? In this case, I would propose to migrate these patches to proper forks of the packages which are then published to pypi including their wheel. This has a few advantages, mainly that the build of sage is speedup and simplified, and that the wider python community can profit from these patches.

What do you think?

Sage-the-distribution is a deployment mechanism.  Compiling all packages from source gives us full control and eliminates possible ABI problems from mixing prebuilt wheels that were compiled on different systems. Building from source also has advantages such as generating architecture-specific code (see #27122). 

> Is it because some packages have patches applied?


In some cases, yes, in other cases, just specific configuration.

> In this case, I would propose to migrate these patches to proper forks of the packages which are then published to pypi including their wheel. This has a few advantages, mainly that the build of sage is speedup and simplified, and that the wider python community can profit from these patches.

But isn't the concept of compile-once-reuse-often the main point of wheels? By design, it's the responsibility of the the maintainer (= publisher of the wheel) that the wheel is useable and optimized for the particular platforms they are published. This also make sense since she is the export of the code of the library.

I feel none of the advantages of wheels outlined in https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/ can really prove effective if wheels are rebuilt from code every time.
> The wheel binary package format frees installers from having to know about the build system, saves time by amortizing compile time over many installations, and removes the need to install a build system in the target environment.


In my opinion, the build process of sage would immensely profit from all these advantages.


Anyway, this discussion is somewhat orthogonal to this ticket (sorry!). So concerning the changes, the code looks good to me. I'm only wondering if the pip2 support in the uninstallation script is really necessary (since only python3 is supported now). However, I don't feel familiar enough with the build script to change the status to positive review.

Wheels are a format for deployment. Public distribution of wheels on a package index is one use case. Here on this ticket we use it for local deployment -- users can installs these wheels into their venvs.

I prefer to think about this not as a question of improving "the" build process of sage, but to offer more options for building sage. This is for example also the purpose of the modularization plan outlined in #29705 - make modularized parts of the Sage library deployable via PyPI.
