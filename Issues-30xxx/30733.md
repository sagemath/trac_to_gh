GH Actions has disabled the `::set-env` command (https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-github-actions-deprecating-set-env-and-add-path-commands/)
We adjust the workflows that used this command to use a new method to set environment variables.

I think instead of 

```
echo "name=DOCKER_PUSH_REPOSITORY::docker.pkg.github.com/${{ github.repository }}/" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```
it should be 

```
echo "DOCKER_PUSH_REPOSITORY=docker.pkg.github.com/${{ github.repository }}/" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

It would be good if you could trigger these workflows and see if they still work.
