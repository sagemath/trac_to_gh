```
GH Actions has disabled the `::set-env` command (https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-github-actions-deprecating-set-env-and-add-path-commands/)
We adjust the workflows that used this command to use a new method to set environment variables.

I think instead of 

```

```
it should be 

```
echo "DOCKER_PUSH_REPOSITORY=docker.pkg.github.com/${{ github.repository }}/" >> $GITHUB_ENV

It would be good if you could trigger these workflows and see if they still work.

This now seems to work, as can be seen in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1414148202:

```
Pushing docker.pkg.github.com/mkoeppe/sage/sage-docker-debian-bullseye-standard-configured:9.1.rc4-71302-ga75c9b7518-failed
The push refers to repository [docker.pkg.github.com/mkoeppe/sage/sage-docker-debian-bullseye-standard-configured]

(That the actual docker push is failing with `no basic auth credentials` is a separate issue -- this has already been failing for a while and will be addressed in another ticket.)
