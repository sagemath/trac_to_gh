spkg `sagelib` will no longer conditionally build the Cython extension module.

Instead, the new spkg `sage_meataxe` will build the Cython extension module. It declares both `sagelib` and `meataxe` as a dependency.

So, in order to use it, one has to do `make sage_meataxe`, right? It would automatically install its dependency `meataxe`, would build the corresponding Cython extension module, AND would also build the documentation of the Cython extension module? And `sage -testall` would run the doctests from the corresponding Cython extension module if and only if sage_meataxe is installed, so that there is no need to mark all its tests as "optional"?

If the documentation and test suite would be taken care of, it would indeed be very helpful.

Yes.

Yes, I would hope so. I have just created #30778 for this idea.
