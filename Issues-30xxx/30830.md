```
At the moment, we have the following behavior:

```
sage: I = OpenInterval(0,2)
sage: J = OpenInterval(0,1, ambient_interval=I, coordinate='t')
sage: I.open_interval(0,1)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: the name '(0, 1)' is already used for another subset of the Real interval (0, 2)
```

Even though the use of `OpenInterval(0,1, ambient_interval=I)` is not intended, this is still a blind spot.

The reason for this behavior comes from the `UniqueRepresentation` and how the subintervals are constructed.

I propose a fix using `__classcall_private__`.

This should do, but it doesn't. Adding `__classcall__` to `RealLine` doesn't help either.

This works now.

I think that `OpenInterval` should silently return a `RealLine` instance if `lower == minus_infinity` and `upper == infinity`. As [Eric pointed out](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30799#comment:50), the  Real line is a fully determined mathematical object, and the behaviour here should reflect that.

But this should be part of another ticket.
