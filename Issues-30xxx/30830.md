```
At the moment, we have the following behavior:

```
sage: I = OpenInterval(0,2)
sage: J = OpenInterval(0,1, ambient_interval=I, coordinate='t')
sage: I.open_interval(0,1)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: the name '(0, 1)' is already used for another subset of the Real interval (0, 2)
```

Even though the use of `OpenInterval(0,1, ambient_interval=I)` is not intended, this is still a blind spot.

The reason for this behavior comes from the `UniqueRepresentation` and how the subintervals are constructed.

I propose a fix using `__classcall_private__`.
