`make build` appears to have downloaded and extracted the files successfully. All the right stuff (OrbitControls and the "fat" line classes) seem to appear in the `three.min.js` file extracted into `local/share/threejs/build` and running a diff on it against the script I built from your repo produces no output, so it looks good.

Of course, the HTML plots produced are still looking for `OrbitControls.js` and/or directing to mrdoob's repo on the CDN, but that's going to be a separate ticket?

No, I overlooked that before meeting a friend for dinner. Will fix tomorrow, but my friend pointed out another development: Mr.doob [reversed](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/20455#issuecomment-706954770) himself and won’t be deprecating `examples/js` this year. I think I’m still in favor of this custom build rather than assembling a tarball because the entire process is smoother and the transition will happen at some point anyway. Feedback is welcome.

The new commit updates the link generated internally, both for online and offline use. I changed the name of the internal function to recognize this. Doctests pass on the two modified files.

Matthias, part of the reason I wanted the repository moved to the SageMath organization is that the online links must point to my personal repository on the CDN. If someone creates notebooks with these changes in place for online use, they may fail to work in the future when the repository is moved.

Also, does the offline mode depend at all on the symbolic link `threejs` that is installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/jupyter/nbextensions`?

(My guess is that it does not and we can remove this symbolic link. At least that's what I gather from a comment in #30476 - it seems that threejs offline graphics also works with system jupyter notebook, which does not have that symbolic link.)

The system Jupyter notebook needs to find the local files for our Three.js viewer to work. As far as I know the symbolic link is how that happens. If you have a better idea in mind for letting the notebook know where the files are, then go for it. I'm still not clear on this question.

Hmm... perhaps it would be better to link the offline plots to a specific version.

For example, suppose I generate an offline plot using the template that works for r117. The plot links to `/home/joshua/sage/local/share/threejs/build/three.min.js`.

That's not an issue for the Jupyter notebook since it's a "live" environment and you can always just re-run the cell to get an up-to-date plot. It's also not an issue for the CDN scripts since those are tied to specific versions.

Although even if we fixed this, it'd still be fragile in that moving/deleting [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) would also break old plots. To make a fully self-contained and isolated offline plot would probably require including the content of `three.min.js` inline instead of linking, but I imagine that might run afoul of the license.

Yes, that's a typical operation.

Right.  So let's please do a versioned installation scheme to address this issue. Basically, upgrades should not break operation of older things.

> That's not an issue for the Jupyter notebook since it's a "live" environment and you can always just re-run the cell to get an up-to-date plot.

Well, but isn't it an important part of the point of the notebook format that the outputs are also stored?

Sorry! When I requested the repository, I was planning to do all the work there from the start. Then I went ahead and made my own to get things going. At this point, I could work in your fork and delete mine and [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) should then treat yours as the new master repository.

Joshua, I always envisioned the viewer as being used to share graphics on the web, since that's how I work and that's the future. I have yet to hear of anyone having encountered this problem. While I appreciate your concerns, I think we can let this lie until someone actually complains about it.

Matthias, the viewer was designed from the beginning for use in Sage only, so for me it's part of the kernel. Are you thinking of having us split it off completely? Otherwise the version of Three.js will track with the version of Sage.

The use case I am describing uses one system Jupyter installation ("frontend") that the user uses to access several kernels, including several Sage kernels installed in different directories.  The frontend may not come from Sage at all, but we need to find a way so that each of the Sage kernels fully works, and that includes the 3d graphics.

I tried this time inspecting. Without the symlink and with online=False, it works since it looks for the threejs files locally and fails, and then it tries online successfully. I rechecked with the symlink and it finds the local files. 

BTW, with jupyterhub, it uses internet pages, not local ones even with the symlink

Thanks a lot for investigating!

By "locally", do you mean through the notebook webserver?

Thanks.

Sounds like we would need to install files using `jupyter labextension` to support this.

Unfortunately I am not clear as to what you expect of me regarding this. The Sage files have to be somewhere and the notebook needs to now how to find them. If that is already necessary, why won't the notebook know how to find the Three.js file? Are you planning on eliminating `src/sage/ext_data`?

Maybe this should be a separate ticket. This one is really just to upgrade the version with the existing structure already in place.

> Are you planning on eliminating `src/sage/ext_data`?

No. The issue is about `share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs` and the fact that there will be several unrelated copies of that.

Here is an example.
- Let's say system jupyter is installed in `/usr`, so the notebook server is accessing `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions`.  
- Sage-9.x may be installed in `/home/x/sage-9.x/local/` and may need threejs r122.
- Sage-9.y may be installed in `/home/x/sage-9.y/local/` and may need threejs r155.
- Let's say r122 and r155 are mutually incompatible.

As @enriqueartal has reported above, our offline threejs graphics needs `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs/`. But the system does not provide it -- it must come from Sage.
If we create a symlink `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs -> /home/x/sage-9.x/local/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs`, then Sage 9.x will work with the system jupyter notebook; but Sage 9.y will not.

Do you agree?

So this means that we need a versioned installation scheme. 
The details of this installation scheme is what I am trying to discuss with you, in particular because it is certainly related to that new repository.

Including the `three.min.js` inline for offline use (whether jupyter or command line) seems like it would clear up this headache for three.js at least. No more local file paths.
