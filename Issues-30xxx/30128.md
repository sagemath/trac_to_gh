}
```
The sage-env script is run under `/bin/sh` but contains bashisms:

```
SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
```

This causes a build failure when `/bin/sh` is not bash:

```
cd '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/build/pkgs/sage_conf' && . '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/src/bin/sage-env' && . '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/build/bin/sage-build-env-config' && sage-logger -p '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/build/pkgs/sage_conf/spkg-install' '/home/mjo/src/sage.git/logs/pkgs/sage_conf-none.log'
/bin/sh: 123: /home/mjo/src/sage.git/src/bin/sage-env: Bad substitution
Error: SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR is set to a bad value:
SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR=/home/mjo/src/sage.git/build/pkgs/sage_conf
You must correct it or erase it and rerun this script
make[3]: *** [Makefile:2022: /home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/var/lib/sage/installed/sage_conf-none] Error 1
```

The comment at the top of sage-env about using bash features should be removed afterwards. For bonus points, it would be nice if we could add a non-bash shell to one of the CI runs.

That documentation was wrong after #29345, I just never noticed the comment to remove it.

The "make" process itself is run with `/bin/sh` and attempts to source sage-env,

```
$$(INST)/$(1)-$(2): $(3)
	$(AM_V_at)cd '$$(SAGE_ROOT)/build/pkgs/$(1)' && \
		. '$$(SAGE_ROOT)/src/bin/sage-env' && . '$$(SAGE_ROOT)/build/bin/sage-build-env-config' && \
		sage-logger -p '$$(SAGE_ROOT)/build/pkgs/$(1)/spkg-install' '$$(SAGE_LOGS)/$(1)-$(2).log'
	touch "$$@"
```

in `build/make/Makefile.in`.

I don't think this is a problem because at build time I think (hope) you are sourcing `src/bin/sage-env-config`, not `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env-config`.

1. The build finished with `/bin/sh -> /bin/dash`.
