https://www.pymanopt.org/ provides numerical optimization algorithms over various families of manifolds (`Sphere`, `Stiefel`, `Grassmann`, ...) and their products.

I propose to
- add these manifolds as Sage classes
- each providing a method `_manopt_` that produces the corresponding pymanopt class
- the default implementation of `_manopt_` would create an instance of a subclass of https://www.pymanopt.org/docs/api-reference.html#pymanopt.manifolds.manifold.Manifold that implements the required methods using SageManifold's symbolic computation.
