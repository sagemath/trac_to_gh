This ticket is a spin-off from #29993.

In `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/index.html`, there are supposed to be PDF icons next to each document, as links leading to the PDF builds. Those are missing, because the file `_static/pdf.png` is missing. For some reason, it is not copied from `src/doc/en/website/static` to `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/_static`.

To see the problem, check that:

Running `make doc-clean; sage --docbuild all html` does not install the PDF icon to the right place, that is under `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/website/_static`.

But running `make doc-clean; sage --docbuild website html` does install the PDF icon to the right place.

The code in lines 583--585 has nothing to do with the current issue. It should not be removed.

Your code in lines 1726--1728 is effectively the same with running `sage --docbuild website html`. This just covers the issue.

The issue of this ticket is to see why `sage --docbuild all html` does not install the pdf icon. The pdf icon is not installed because the website builder does not copy its static files folder. I checked this problem is also with the developer manual builder.

I think that code is intended to build the basic website framework for the PDF documentation. It appears to matter when `getattr(get_builder('website'), 'html')()` is executed, as far as installing the appropriate static files. Can you explain why?

> It should not be removed.

Of course I didn't remove it, I moved it.

> Your code in lines 1726--1728 is effectively the same with running `sage --docbuild website html`. This just covers the issue.

I know that. The question is why it works and why running `getattr(get_builder('website'), 'html')()` at a different stage does not.

> The issue of this ticket is to see why `sage --docbuild all html` does not install the pdf icon.

I disagree: you don't want the PDF icon if you haven't built the PDF documentation. So `sage --docbuild all html` should ideally not install the PDF icon.

> The pdf icon is not installed because the website builder does not copy its static files folder. I checked this problem is also with the developer manual builder.
