```
Currently every `Components` object has lots of metadata attributes in addition to the actual data dictionary in `._comp`.  

If one has many different `Components` objects with the same symmetry metadata, we can reduce storage space as follows.

We create new classes `CompParent`, `CompParentWithSym`, ..., which 
store the symmetry attributes and become `UniqueRepresentation`. We make `Components` objects elements of these parents.  

The parents will also have index iterator methods.

Data associated with symmetries and dimensions, computed currently each time for each `CompWithSym` object in methods such as `__init__`, `__add__`, `trace`, ... can be precomputed and cached in the parent using ``@`cached_method` in the parent class).


This will make the code in #30229 (subspaces of tensor with symmetries) more elegant because it no longer needs a dummy `Components` object to represent the symmetry but rather a `CompParent` object.

I think it would be a good idea to cache results from `trace`, `contract`, ... as well.

The most annoying thing with this ticket will most likely be the docstring that has to be adapted...is there a good way to use search&replace?

Yes, this is going in the direction that I had in mind.

Some more of the normalization happening in `CompParentWithSym.__init__` should probably be moved to `__classcall_private__`

Would `cdpef`ing the symmetry related functions cause a speedup btw?

Since this involves only integers, i.e. struct types, one could even try to Cythonize these completely.

Thank you Matthias, Michael and Travis for your replies. I'm convinced now that parent/element is a good approach here (I was bothered by the lack of algebraic structure of the parent), especially for symmetry-based coercions.

I wouldn't do it and just keep it pure Python until you actually decide to make it Cython.\n\nWhy is the ring associated with the element and not the parent?

<a id='comment:47'></a>I don't really like this partial measure. I wouldn't do it and just keep it pure Python until you actually decide to make it Cython.

Why is the ring associated with the element and not the parent? In general, why is all of these attributes copied from the parent? Is the extra level of indirection that slow? You can just call `self._parent` in the Cython code.

A `CompParent` will become a free module over a fixed ring.  

Fixing the ring is necessary because numerical backends (for example for NumPy's `ndarray`) can only work with base ring `RDF`; whereas the symbolic backends (such as the existing dictionary-based implementation) is for `SR` and exact rings.

<a id='comment:93'></a>Okay, I spotted the error. It's caused by these lines:

```diff
+        self._sym = tuple(self._sym)
+        self._antisym = tuple(self._antisym)
```

When a tensor field is displayed, it must be restricted to a parallelizable subset first. If that restriction does not exists, it's constructed from scratch. This is done by the `tensor` method of the corresponding vector field module of this subset. In particular, the parameters `sym` and `antisym` are passed to this method. In our particular case the code will be executed until

```python
        elif tensor_type[0] > 1 and tensor_type[1] == 0 and antisym:
            if isinstance(antisym[0], (int, Integer)):
                # a single antisymmetry is provided as a tuple or a
                # range object; it is converted to a 1-item list:
                antisym = [tuple(antisym)]
            if isinstance(antisym, list):
                antisym0 = antisym[0]
            else:
                antisym0 = antisym
            if len(antisym0) == tensor_type[0]:
                return self.alternating_contravariant_tensor(
                                              tensor_type[0], name=name,
                                              latex_name=latex_name)
```

With the above change, however, `len(antisym0)` returns `1`, but it should be `2` because the code turns `[(0, 1)]` into `((0,1),)`. So, this case will be ignored and a tensor without symmetries will be created instead.

<a id='comment:98'></a>This is likely not the final form of this ticket.

The goals of this ticket -- one-time precomputation of data related to the symmetries -- have not been fully achieved yet because the parent class is now a module over a base ring. This is fine for numerical tensors that are all over the same ring (`QQ` or `RDF`) but for the symbolic tensors that are used in `sage.manifolds`, there are many base rings, so the symmetries will be recomputed for each of them.

But for now it was more important to me to have separate parents for separate base rings, as this will allow us to dispatch to different implementation backends (= element classes) - as part of `@`gh-honglizhaobob's project (#31991).

My solution for allowing more shared precomputation would be to introduce another class, similar to https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/tensor/tensor.html#sympy.tensor.tensor.TensorSymmetry, which only captures the symmetry group (with action).

Apart from this, there is still some code that should be pushed from element to parent, for example the symmetries from tensor contraction. 

And there are branches in the code that can no longer be reached because the coercion system, via `CompParent._element_constructor_`, now guarantees that the inputs of single-underscore methods such as `_add_` have the same symmetry already.

Also, I have not done any time measurements.

The next step into this direction should be to fix/complete the existing code for coercions.

```
sage: cp = CompParentWithSym(QQ, 4, sym=((1, 2), (3, 4)))
sage: cp2 = CompParentWithSym(QQ, 4, sym=((1, 2, 3, 4)))
sage: cp.coerce_map_from(cp2)   # returns None, should return injection to cp
```
Help with this is welcome!
