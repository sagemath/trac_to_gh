Given an elliptic curve E and a prime l, this code outputs the graph or digraph object representing the l-degree isogeny (di)graph containing E with vertices isomorphism classes of curves labelled by either an equation of a representative curve or the associated j-invariant.

This is functionality similar to the ticket #16942

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hi Marc,

Apologies for the dealy. This is excellent quality code, thanks! I'm not sure what chapoton was suggesting to do about `_repr_`, yours looks like the best choice to me (one may take the chance to simplify the printing code, btw, but that's not a necessity).

Some minor remarks:

- You could use `sparse=True`, or even `data_strcture=static_sparse` as parameter for the graph constructor, since users are likely to want to construct large graphs with small degree.
- The two lines
  {{{
  b = self.ainvs()
  a = [z._coeff_repr() for z in b]
  }}}

  in `_repr_` seem unncessary now.
- On my server it takes ~30s to construct a supersingular 2-graph with ~1000 vertices, ~60s for the 3-graph, ~300s for the 5-graph. Maybe you could adjust `curve_max` depending on `l` (e.g., 3-4 increments). Also, the warning message could be more explicit, e.g.: Isogeny graph contains more than x curves.
- Maybe the name `isogeny_graph_prime_degree` or `isogeny_ell_graph` is more easily discoverable than `prime_isogeny_graph`.

Finally, a question: have you thought about the ordering of the outputs in the doctests? I assume `Graph` prints the vertices in the order they appear in the adjacency matrix, but what about edges? Is the ordering explicitly defined, or is there a risk that the doctests break at some future Sage release?

If you can solve these points, I'm happy to give positive review.

I see no problem in making a change to the order of the output of this function, other than the usual one -- some doctests will fail.

Also, it is the case that automorphisms of prime degree, when they exist, will cause some of the isogenies computed by this function to have codomain isomorphic to the domain.  This is entirely correct.  If you don't want them then filter the output of the function, please do not change the function.

In particular, always use ```True```, ```False```, ````None```

- at least 2 spaces before `#` and one after, for instance

```diff
-                m = len(E.automorphisms()) / 2 #multiplicity of out-edges
+                m = len(E.automorphisms()) / 2  # multiplicity of out-edges
```


And finally, there is no need for a loop here

```diff
-                while s in labels: s += "*"
+                s += "*" * len(labels)
```

Uh? No, that's not equivalent. That's only adding as many `*` as necssary to make a unique label.

Arguably, I don't think it's possible to have a j-invariant appear more than twice in any isogeny graph (as usual, one should check for j=0,1728), so

```
    if s in labels: s += "*"
```

would likely suffice, however I see no harm in the `while` loop.

I got this cleaned up as suggested (but left the `while` loop as is).  Let me know if there is any other cleanup necessary.
