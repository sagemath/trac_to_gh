Given an elliptic curve E and a prime l, this code outputs the graph or digraph object representing the l-degree isogeny (di)graph containing E with vertices isomorphism classes of curves labelled by either an equation of a representative curve or the associated j-invariant.

This is functionality similar to the ticket #16942

Hi Marc,

Apologies for the dealy. This is excellent quality code, thanks! I'm not sure what chapoton was suggesting to do about `_repr_`, yours looks like the best choice to me (one may take the chance to simplify the printing code, btw, but that's not a necessity).

Some minor remarks:

- You could use `sparse=True`, or even `data_strcture=static_sparse` as parameter for the graph constructor, since users are likely to want to construct large graphs with small degree.
- The two lines

  ```
  b = self.ainvs()
  a = [z._coeff_repr() for z in b]
  ```

  in `_repr_` seem unncessary now.
- On my server it takes ~30s to construct a supersingular 2-graph with ~1000 vertices, ~60s for the 3-graph, ~300s for the 5-graph. Maybe you could adjust `curve_max` depending on `l` (e.g., 3-4 increments). Also, the warning message could be more explicit, e.g.: Isogeny graph contains more than x curves.
- Maybe the name `isogeny_graph_prime_degree` or `isogeny_ell_graph` is more easily discoverable than `prime_isogeny_graph`.

Finally, a question: have you thought about the ordering of the outputs in the doctests? I assume `Graph` prints the vertices in the order they appear in the adjacency matrix, but what about edges? Is the ordering explicitly defined, or is there a risk that the doctests break at some future Sage release?

If you can solve these points, I'm happy to give positive review.

Hi Luca,

I updated the code as you requested.  A few things:
- I cleaned up those two lines, used `static_sparse` for the graph, and changed the method name to `isogeny_ell_graph`.
- For the multiple `curve_max` values: on my laptop, the warning is generally output after ~20 seconds.  However, when `l` is large, the warning will only fire after `E.isogenies_prime_degree(l)` returns which can take a while for big `l` values.
- It seems like as long as the vertex labels are all comparable (which they are in this case), the edge order will be consistent.
- However, when labelling the vertices with the curve equation (as opposed to the j-invariant) the ordering of the vertices when generating the graph could matter (since multiple isomorphic curve equations exist).  The vertex and edge order depends on the order of the isogenies returned by `isogenies_prime_degree`, the documentation for which does not explicitly specify an ordering.  So, if that method/algorithm is changed in such a way that the order of the returned isogenies changes, there is the chance that the tests for this will fail if walking the graph in one way results in different (but isomorphic) curve equations than walking it in another way.  Similarly, there is also a risk where some change to `isogenies_prime_degree` causes the method to return isogenies to curves isomorphic to what is currently being returned.  I'm not sure if it is appropriate to complicate the code here in order to prevent possible future test failures caused by changes which may or may not ever occur.

Hello,

to avoid some future work to clean the code, I suggest to fix some minor points in the coding style (pep8):
- no dot at the end of the short sentence

```diff
-        - ``l`` -- prime degree of isogenies.
+        - ``l`` -- prime degree of isogenies
```

- the convention for parameters is like:

```diff
-        - ``directed`` (default True) -- return a directed graph if ``True``;
-          otherwise return an undirected graph.  In the undirected case, the
+        - ``directed`` -- boolean (default: ``True``); whether to return
+           a directed or an undirected graph. In the undirected case, the
          in-degrees and out-degrees of the vertices must be balanced and
          therefore the number of out-edges from the vertices corresponding to
          j-invariants 0 and 1728 (if they are part of the graph) are reduced
          to match the number of in-edges.
```
In particular, always use <code>\`\`True\`\`</code>, <code>\`\`False\`\`</code>, <code>\`\`\`None\`\`</code>

- at least 2 spaces before `#` and one after, for instance

```diff
-                m = len(E.automorphisms()) / 2 #multiplicity of out-edges
+                m = len(E.automorphisms()) / 2  # multiplicity of out-edges
```


And finally, there is no need for a loop here

```diff
-                while s in labels: s += "*"
+                s += "*" * len(labels)
```

Arguably, I don't think it's possible to have a j-invariant appear more than twice in any isogeny graph (as usual, one should check for j=0,1728), so

```
    if s in labels: s += "*"
```

would likely suffice, however I see no harm in the `while` loop.
