`pyflakes` does not know about `lazy_import` and may therefore emit distracting warnings - as noted in [#30616 comment:8](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30616#comment:8)

We introduce a new method `PythonModule.lazy_import`, which enables the following new idiom for creating lazy imports that are visible to static checkers:

```
LibBraiding = PythonModule('sage.libs.braiding', spkg='libbraiding')
rightnormalform = LibBraiding.lazy_import(
  'rightnormalform', namespace=None)
centralizer,  supersummitset = LibBraiding.lazy_import(
  ('centralizer', 'supersummitset'), namespace=None)
```

Note that the patchbot "pyflakes plugin" knows about lazy imports.

BUT only with a basic syntax, one-liners.

Thanks for the pointer!

Given that lazy imports are so widely used in sage, we probably don't want to use this workaround unless really necessary. It would add a lot of clutter to lots of files

A simple solution would be to make `lazy_import` return the (tuple of) lazy import objects that it creates, instead of relying on the magical namespace injection as a side effect. Then we could write

```
rightnormalform, centralizer, supersummitset = lazy_import(
  'sage.libs.braiding',
  ['rightnormalform', 'centralizer', 'supersummitset'],
  feature=PythonModule('sage.libs.braiding', spkg='libbraiding'))
```

Of course, we could as well just use `LazyImport` directly:

```
LibBraiding = PythonModule('sage.libs.braiding', spkg='libbraiding')
rightnormalform = LazyImport('sage.libs.braiding', 'rightnormalform', feature=LibBraiding)
centralizer     = LazyImport('sage.libs.braiding', 'centralizer',     feature=LibBraiding)
supersummitset  = LazyImport('sage.libs.braiding', 'supersummitset',  feature=LibBraiding)
```

What do you mean with typed assignment?
In the previous version,

```
try:
    from sage.graphs.mcqd import mcqd
except ImportError:
    from sage.misc.package import PackageNotFoundError
    raise PackageNotFoundError("mcqd")
return mcqd(self)
```
static type checkers can check if `mcqd` is actually a function defined in `sage.graphs.mcqd` and if `self` is allowed as an argument of `mcqd`. I doubt that they are intelligent enough to give the same information for the new version:

```
from sage.features import PythonModule
Mcqd = PythonModule('sage.graphs.mcqd', spkg='mcqd')
mcqd = Mcqd.lazy_import('mcqd', namespace=None)
return mcqd(self)
```

Another option would be to introduce (global) booleans that indicate whether a given library is available. E.g.

```
// e.g. in sage.distribution
def is_mcqd():
   try:
      from sage.graphs.mcqd import mcqd
      return true 
   except ImportError:
      return false
   // or some other way to determine if mcqd is available

// usage in another module:

// at the beginning: global import
if sage.distribution.is_mcqd():
    from sage.graphs.mcqd import mcqd
...
// later in the code
if sage.distribution.is_mcqd():
    return mcqd(self)
else:
    return ...
```

Yet another solution would be the following pattern:

```
try:
    from sage.graphs.mcqd import mcqd as _mcqd 
except ImportError:
    mcqd = None
else:
    mcqd = _mcqd

// later
if mcqd:
    return mcqd(self)
else:
    return ...
```
suggested in https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1297#issuecomment-508593494.
This should work with mypy, not sure about pyright.
