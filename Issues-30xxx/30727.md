In preparation for a long needed overhaul (and a workshop in early 2021 I am planning), let's collect tickets and issues related to combinatorial species here.  An earlier roadmap is #10662.  An earlier attempt to refactor the species code is #20622.

* #16107 is the meta-ticket for lazy lists, refactoring the species code, should cross check with #15673

* improve operations with symmetric functions - it would be particularly nice if a cycle index would just be a symmetric function, so we can immediately use their operations

* implement the notion of polynomial species (that is, species with F[n] = {} for n large enough), so that we can compute the composition of a polynomial species with a species that has non-zero constant term.

* multivariate species, see #13264

* provide isomorphism types for composition (which probably needs multivariate species or quotients)

* establish link to permutation groups, and thus provide the molecular/atomic decomposition of a species of fixed cardinality and thereby also decidable equality

* keep track of symbolic expressions for generating functions

* revive group cycle index #14347 - a big issue is that this code only provides the cycle index series, not the quotient species themselves

* interface to https://gitlab.com/ParComb/usain-boltz for random generation

* allow sets as input for structures, possibly also use `_getitem_` for structures, create a class for bijections between finite sets which we can use to relabel structures

* provide the arithmetic product on the level of structures

* provide the exponential composition of https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0038

* species for other groups, in particular the hyperoctahedral group
