A method for Gauss-Legendre integration of fast-callable
polynomials was added in #23140.

It lives in `src/sage/numerical/gauss_legendre.pyx`.

This ticket is to make it appear in the documentation.

Ideally add examples and do a bit of pep8 formatting.

Looks good! Some comments based on an initial reading of the code:
- I don't think "REC" algorithm is universally accepted terminology. If you want to call it that, I think it needs a literature reference with it. This could be something like:

```
Compute the integration nodes and weights for the Gauss-Legendre quadrature scheme.

We use the recurrence relations for Legendre polynomials to compute their values. This is a version of the algorithm that in [Neurohr ...] is called the REC algorithm.

NOTE:

It may be worth testing if using the Arb algorithm for finding the nodes and weights in `arb/acb_calc/integrate_gl_auto_deg.c` has better performance.
```
- Concerning `range` in cython code: See [Cython doc](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/pyrex_differences.html#automatic-range-conversion). This gets compiled to an actual c-for loop (it's important here that cython has type-information on what `len` returns (an actual c-integer-type) so that it can provide the loop with sufficient type hints so that the C compiler can actually compile it.
The fact that xrange still works indicates that in these situations, cython considers range and xrange as synonyms and that this behaviour has been maintained (at least with the settings that sage uses for its cython library). Moving to `range` if you're touching the code anyway makes sense.

Remember to set the ticket to "needs review" when ready for review.

Some comments on the branch you pushed, in addition to those by @nbruin.

**Split into two tickets?**

I like your proposed change to `integrate_vector`
allowing to specify a number of nodes instead of 
specifying `epsilon`, but for clarity I would
separate that change out to a different ticket,
and stick to documentation and reformatting here.

Now some comments on the changes in the existing branch.

**Addition to the documentation**

Well done adding a line to `src/doc/en/reference/numerical/index.rst`
to make Gauss-Legendre integration appear in the documentation.

**Reformatting**

Good job on the reformatting overall.

Good call adding a double-colon changing `NOTE:` into `NOTE::`,
and indenting its content.

To finish up, I think it needs to become `.. NOTE::`.

Some ways I would push the reformatting a bit further:

```diff
-        sage: L1 = nodes(24,53)
+        sage: L1 = nodes(24, 53)
-        sage: P = RR['x'](sage.functions.orthogonal_polys.legendre_P(24,x))
+        sage: P = RR['x'](sage.functions.orthogonal_polys.legendre_P(24, x))
         sage: Pdif = P.diff()
-        sage: L2 = [((r+1)/2,1/(1-r^2)/Pdif(r)^2) for r,_ in RR['x'](P).roots()]
+        sage: L2 = [((r + 1)/2, 1/(1 - r^2)/Pdif(r)^2)
+        ....:       for r, _ in RR['x'](P).roots()]
-        sage: all((a[0]-b[0]).abs() < 10^-15 and (a[1]-b[1]).abs() < 10^-9 for a,b in zip(L1,L2))

**Changes to `integrate_vector`**

Perhaps the new `N=None` keyword should come after
the existing `N=None` keyword.

Otherwise, this line, which appears twice in the doctests:

```
        sage: I = integrate_vector(f, prec, epsilon)
```
is really executing

```diff
        sage: I = integrate_vector(f, prec, N=epsilon)
```
which is likely not intended, and this change
might similarly break existing user code.

In any case, the examples should be explicit about
which keyword is passed, using one of:

```
        sage: I = integrate_vector(f, prec, epsilon=epsilon)
        sage: I = integrate_vector(f, prec, N=N)
```
and possibly new examples should be added using

```
        sage: I = integrate_vector(f, prec, epsilon=epsilon, N=N)
        sage: I = integrate_vector(f, prec, N=N, epsilon=epsilon)
```
to illustrate that specifying `N` overrides specifying `epsilon`.

There is a typo "specificed" for "specified" in the new line
describing ``N``. Suggested change:

```diff
-     - ``N`` -- integer. Number of nodes to use. If specificed, the target error ``epsilon`` is ignored. 
+     - ``N`` -- integer. Number of nodes to use.
+       If specified, the target error ``epsilon`` is ignored. 
```

This could also be solved by using [keyword-only arguments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/). In order to maintain backward compatibility, it could be implemented like this:

```python

    if epsilon_deprecated is not None:

        deprecation(30698, "positional argument epsilon should be passed as keyword argument")
        if epsilon is None:

        else:

It doesn't remove the [Code smell of boolean parameters](https://medium.com/@amlcurran/clean-code-the-curse-of-a-boolean-parameter-c237a830b7a3), and these code-path-determining signatures have a similar smell.

Thanks, Samuel.

The continuation prompts indeed should be fixed. I'm setting the ticket back to "needs work" because it does, and otherwise it might get missed.

Once Linden has added continuation prompts to those two lines, he can set it back to "positive"; or alert me to do that.
