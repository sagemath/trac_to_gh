```
The `_latex_` method of a graph checks for two LaTeX packages,
tkz-graph and tkz-berge. If not found, it prints a warning referring to
the "Altermundus" website. The LaTeX tutorial also refers to it.

The Altermundus website is gone, its tkz page is archived at:

- https://web.archive.org/web/20181228055702/http://altermundus.com:80/pages/tkz/

The links should be updated to point to the relevant CTAN pages:

- https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-berge
- https://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-graph

<a id='comment:18'></a>The German part looks correct, but difficult to understand.

There was a dash missing between `PGF` and `Bibliothek`. In German you cannot just put to nouns like this in row, but have to combine them (either as new word or with a dash). This might explain funny English spelling of German natives.

Do I see correctly that there is not hint here, how to get the PGF library? (It's probably somewhere else or obvious anyway).

```diff
-Um kombinatorische Graphen darstellen zu können, wird eine aktuelle

I like your simplified version more than mine as well. Would you push it?

You are right. I don't think that it is necessary to give more details here; it is not so difficult to find information about pgf (in my opinion).
