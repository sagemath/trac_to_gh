<a id='comment:24'></a>Here are my comments:

This sentence should be revised since it is defining *-insertion as *-insertion:

```
The `\star`-insertion is similar to the classical RSK algorithm,
but it is defined using the `\star`-insertion in [MPPS2020]_.
```

In `forward_rule()`:

```diff
         - ``obj1, obj2`` -- can be one of the following ways to represent a
           biword (or, equivalently, an increasing 0-Hecke factorization) that
           is fully commutative:
 
-            - two lists ``obj1`` and ``obj2`` of equal length, to be
-              interpreted as the top row and the bottom row of the biword.
+          - two lists ``obj1`` and ``obj2`` of equal length, to be
+            interpreted as the top row and the bottom row of the biword
```
and similar for that documentation.

I think this can be simplified:

```diff
-                obj1 = sum([[h.factors-i]*len(h.value[i]) for i in range(h.factors)],[])
-                obj1.reverse()
-                obj2 = [i for f in h.value for i in f]
-                obj2.reverse()
+                obj1 = sum([[h.factors-i]*len(h.value[i]) for i in reversed(range(h.factors))],[])
+                obj2 = [i for f in reversed(h.value) for i in reversed(f)]
```
although I am not sure that changes the readability/speed of the code. So you might want to ignore this.

```diff
-for j in sorted(row_dict.keys(), reverse=True):
+for j in sorted(row_dict, reverse=True):
```

Can you also include tests for the backwards rule for the empty case (with perhaps the different output types)?

I think there should be at least one systematic test that the round trip is the identity, but both loops would also be good.

This error message is misleading because it is suggests that the conjugate is the input of `p.conjugate()`. I would suggest

```diff
-raise ValueError("p.conjugate(=%s) must be a semistandard tableau" % p.conjugate())
raise ValueError("the conjugate of p(=%s) must be a semistandard tableau" % p.conjugate())
```

Python convention for error messages is they start with a lower case letter:

```
raise ValueError(f"The row reading word of the insertion tableau {p} is not fully-commutative")
```

Nitpick, but since there will be changes: `y -=1` -> `y -= 1`.

<a id='comment:27'></a>Thanks for the comments. Jianping and I have addressed them in the last two commits.

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A24):
> Can you also include tests for the backwards rule for the empty case (with perhaps the different output types)?

Yes, the tests have been included for both `forward_rule` and `backward_rule`. This flags an undetected error for `fully_commutative_stable_grothendieck.py` but that has been rectified.

The tests are included for both loops, but there is no test for output `DecreasingHeckeFactorization` under the composition `RSK_inverse` after `RSK` using `RuleStar`. 
The default is to return the number of factors according to the largest entry in the recording tableau; a warning has been written to highlight this behavior.
