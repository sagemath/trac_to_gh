CC:  @dimpase

Added code that constructs distance-regular graphs from generalised quadrangles with spread.
Also added a function that checks whether an distance-regular graph can be built using the method above.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30337

I still got Memory Error in the longest bilinear forms graphs test, 
so here is an optimisation that reduces memory consumption by packing matrices into `int`, with it all tests pass.

it certainly lowers memory consumption, but I would not worry too much about it.
There are much better ways to handle this, as implemented in GAP package GRAPE.

I cannot reproduce the error.

All my code do is calling `Graph(edges, format='list_of_edges')`.
The `edges` list is **long** (6652854) but I believe the code path (i.e. the full stack of function calls) should not differ from `Graph([(0,1)], format='list_of_edges')`.

I can change the doctest to importing `BilinearFormsGraph` directly from `sage.graphs.generators.distance_regular` if this solves the issue, but I don't know how to test it myself.
