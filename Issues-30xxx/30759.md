I confirm that your commit fixes the issue. Bot is green except for one pycodestyle warning.

So, I added a one-line commit to fix one pycodestyle warning on top of your branch.

I also rebased your commit on top of rc3 to avoid a useless merge in the history.

Feel free to change the status to positive review if bot is totally green.
