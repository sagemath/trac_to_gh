Current version in sage is `2.9.4.p0` from March 30, 2015.

https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc/releases/tag/releases%2F2.10.8 is from 2022-05-05

As `sage_numerical_backends_coin` is incompatible with CBC 2.10.x (#30635), we remove it. The `'Coin'` solver is now provided as an alias of `'CVXPy/CBC'` from #34251.

In particular, the url finishes with `.tgz` but everywhere in sage it is always `.tar.gz`?

No, we want to accept the broadest range of supported cbc versions. CBC is very mature software, and we should be fine with pretty much any system-provided version.
