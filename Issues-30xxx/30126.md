There is the category of `Graphs` and there is an axiom 'Connected' (used in `Manifolds`), but so far there is no category of connected graphs. They would be metric spaces... if edge weights are positive.

The mentioning of manifolds is just an indication of where the axiom is used. So what I believe is being proposing is to allow the axiom to be added to the category of graphs with a default metric function being the usual distance between vertices.

I'm not used to the terminology of `category`, but I understand some relationships between graphs and metric spaces (I did some work on Gromov hyperbolicity).

If I understand well, you want a new class `ConnectedGraphs`, that inherits from `Graphs` and overwrites `delete_edge` and `delete_vertex` to raise an error if the removal of a vertex or an edge disconnects the graph.
The class should also get a `check_weight` method to check that edge weights are positive.

More work would certainly be needed to ensure that a subgraph of a connected graph is of the same type, etc. right?

Right. This can be done by calling `self.__class__` or `self.parent()` rather than `Graph()`.

1. Immutable: a graph can be immutable, but we cannot flip from one state to another. This is done via a copy like `Graph(G, immutable=True)`

2. using `self.__class__` or `self.parent()` is a good idea, but may be not so easy to do. We have to correct/modify many parts of the code...

I think we can at least solve the immediate issue of adding the axiom `Connected` to the graph category. So I did this in the highest place it makes sense: simplicial complexes. With this, we have the natural category for those that want to use it. The later steps of adding the refinement to the graph class can come on a later ticket.
