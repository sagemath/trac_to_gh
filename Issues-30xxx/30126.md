There is the category of `Graphs` and there is an axiom 'Connected' (used in `Manifolds`), but so far there is no category of connected graphs. They would be metric spaces... if edge weights are positive.

I'm not used to the terminology of `category`, but I understand some relationships between graphs and metric spaces (I did some work on Gromov hyperbolicity).

If I understand well, you want a new class `ConnectedGraphs`, that inherits from `Graphs` and overwrites `delete_edge` and `delete_vertex` to raise an error if the removal of a vertex or an edge disconnects the graph.
The class should also get a `check_weight` method to check that edge weights are positive.

More work would certainly be needed to ensure that a subgraph of a connected graph is of the same type, etc. right?

Right. This can be done by calling `self.__class__` or `self.parent()` rather than `Graph()`.

1. Immutable: a graph can be immutable, but we cannot flip from one state to another. This is done via a copy like `Graph(G, immutable=True)`

2. using `self.__class__` or `self.parent()` is a good idea, but may be not so easy to do. We have to correct/modify many parts of the code...

This looks great. In `sage.categories.simplicial_complexes` I see you have already planned for categories to express more general cell complexes.
