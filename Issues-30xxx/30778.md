When a file is marked `# sage.doctest: optional - xyz`, we omit it from doctesting unless `--optional=xyz` is given.

This will save us from having to add lots of `# optional - ...` tags to files in the course of modularization (#29705)

We do this by extending `sage.doctest.control.skipfile`, which already parses files for `# nodoctest` file directives.

There is certainly an open question here. I don't think it's only a matter of marking up the doctests with "optional" tags. With modularization going forward, we need to find a way to inform the user that some Python module is provided by a particular distribution package. I think this information should be attached to the module name instead of cluttering the doctests.

Looks like this topic is showing up every 4-6 years.

What has changed now is that modularization (#29705) would introduce LOTS of new optional tags if we don't find a systematic solution.

Indeed the doctests are one reason why my optional package p_group_cohomology is not part of the sage library, although is is mostly written in Python and Cython and would thus fit well into the Sage library (but should still be an optional package).",

It makes sense for optional extension modules, such as sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense (but I don't know if there are others). Indeed the doctests are one reason why my optional package p_group_cohomology is not part of the sage library, although is is mostly written in Python and Cython and would thus fit well into the Sage library (but should still be an optional package).

Indeed it would be best to test this on files that are in tree but could be made "optional" via the same mechanism that we already use for extensions modules depending on optional packages. Candidates are:
- modules depending on `giac`
- modules depending on `brial`
- modules depending on `ntl`
- more - see #30666

Since this will require modification of `setup.py`, it's best to do this on top of #31377, #30912
