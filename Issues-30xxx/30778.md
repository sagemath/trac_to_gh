When a file is marked `# sage.doctest: optional - xyz`, we omit it from doctesting unless `--optional=xyz` is given.

This will save us from having to add lots of `# optional - ...` tags to files in the course of modularization (#29705)

We do this by extending `sage.doctest.control.skipfile`, which already parses files for `# nodoctest` file directives.

This has been discussed in the past and rejected, on the grounds that the directive is hidden when people look at the reference manual or just do `x.method?`, so they may expect those tests to work all the time.
