When a file is marked `# sage.doctest: optional - xyz`, we omit it from doctesting unless `--optional=xyz` is given.

This will save us from having to add lots of `# optional - ...` tags to files in the course of modularization (#29705)

We do this by extending `sage.doctest.control.skipfile`, which already parses files for `# nodoctest` file directives.

Previous related proposals/discussions: #3260, #20427

This has been discussed in the past and rejected, on the grounds that the directive is hidden when people look at the reference manual or just do `x.method?`, so they may expect those tests to work all the time. For any of these proposed directives, the corresponding page in the reference manual should have a clear warning.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment:36):
> @simon-king-jena: would you object if we skipped all tests in `src/sage/matrix/matrix_gfpn_dense.pyx` unless `meataxe` is installed? I've skimmed through and don't see anything that (I hope) isn't tested elsewhere for other matrix implementations, but you know this file pretty well.

I did not intend to create new tests for other matrix implementations. So, I wouldn't object to make all the module's tests optional. In fact, this is what I asked for since I first created the module.
