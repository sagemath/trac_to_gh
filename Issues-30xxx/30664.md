What error did you see with `./bootstrap`? I tested it with every shell available to me, in a clean tree (after `git clean -x -f -d`).

Probably related: those two occurrences of `source` should be `.` instead. And we should be doing `test -f <file> && . <file>` instead of `2>/dev/null` so that we don't hide other, unexpected errors.
