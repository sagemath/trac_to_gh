What error did you see with `./bootstrap`? I tested it with every shell available to me, in a clean tree (after `git clean -x -f -d`).

Probably related: those two occurrences of `source` should be `.` instead. And we should be doing `test -f <file> && . <file>` instead of `2>/dev/null` so that we don't hide other, unexpected errors.

I can't explain this, but when my `/bin/sh` points to `/bin/zsh` and I run the bootstrap script, it fails. If I run `zsh ./bootstrap -d` instead, it works fine -- so whatever I was doing to test was flawed. At first I thought zsh was looking at the shebang and re-executing the script with `/bin/sh`... but `/bin/sh` is still zsh!

Whatever is happening there, your branch fixes the problem. Look good on your end too?
