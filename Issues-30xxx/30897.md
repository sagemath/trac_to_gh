The current output of `SymmetricGroup(n).irreducible_characters()` is a list of `ClassFunction_libgap` objects. It would be nice to take one of those class functions and instead of passing in a `SymmetricGroup` element, pass in a `Partition` of `n` since those represent the conjugacy classes. 

This could be done by checking if the input to `ClassFunction_libgap` objects are `Partitions`, and if so using the `default_representative` of the partition.

Welcome to Sage development. So I have a few other additional comments for you to address:

- Add your (real) name to the author field.
- Instead of using an `assert` statement to check for valid input, you should instead raise a `ValueError` (or more generally whichever type of error is appropriate). This is a general convention we have taken across Sage (there is still some legacy code that does not do this).
- I think the error message would be better as `f"the size of the partition {g.size()} must equal {len(self._group.domain())}"` as it is more concise and direct about what is needed.
- It would be better to move the `if isinstance(self._group, SymmetricGroup):` first. This makes the code more clean and slightly faster for other groups.
- These changes:

  ```diff
               sage: chi([2,1])
  -            <BLANKLINE>
               Traceback (most recent call last):
  -                ...
  +            ...
               TypeError: Cyclic group of order 3 as a permutation group is not a SymmetricGroup. Give an element of Cyclic group of order 3 as a permutation group.
  ```
