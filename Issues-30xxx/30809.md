After using `enter`, `LPDictionary` tries to use `\color`, which leads to raw latex code to show up in the notebook.

Before this ticket:

```
sage.numerical.interactive_simplex_method.style("Vanderbei")
from sage.numerical.interactive_simplex_method import LPDictionary
K.<x1, x2, x3, x4, x5> = QQ[]
D = LPDictionary(objective_value=5,
                 objective_name="zeta",
                 c=[1, -1],
                 nonbasic_variables=(x3, x1),
                 b=[5, 7, 0],
                 basic_variables=(x2, x4, x5),
                 A=matrix(QQ, [[-2, 3], [0, 4], [0, -1]]))
D  # typesets OK
D.enter(x3)
D  # prints latex code
```

But I seem to have forgotten what to do with an `HTMLFragment` (such as the result of `run_simplex_method`) on the Sage console. If I run `view` on the result of that I just get a PDF viewer that prints out LaTeX code instead of typesetting it...

<a id='comment:20'></a>The fix looks good to me. 
- all tests passed in `interactive_simplex_method.py`
- I can see `view(D)` or `%display typeset`+`run_simplex_method` with colors in Jupyter notebook as claimed.
- `view(D)` also works on the console. `run_simplex_method()` outputs valid latex code.
- It's a pity that `view`/`show` of `run_simplex_method()` does not generate a pdf of the typeset (but only showing the latex code). However, it is beyond this ticket.
