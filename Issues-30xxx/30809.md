After using `enter`, `LPDictionary` tries to use `\color`, which leads to raw latex code to show up in the notebook.

Before this ticket:

```
sage.numerical.interactive_simplex_method.style("Vanderbei")
from sage.numerical.interactive_simplex_method import LPDictionary
K.<x1, x2, x3, x4, x5> = QQ[]
D = LPDictionary(objective_value=5,
                 objective_name="zeta",
                 c=[1, -1],
                 nonbasic_variables=(x3, x1),
                 b=[5, 7, 0],
                 basic_variables=(x2, x4, x5),
                 A=matrix(QQ, [[-2, 3], [0, 4], [0, -1]]))
D  # typesets OK
D.enter(x3)
D  # prints latex code
```

<a id='comment:16'></a>Would you mind adding how to "use typeset mode to see details" somewhere in the docstring? The following two ways work for me, but I can hardly remember them when I need to see the LP.
- `view(P)` in the console or in the Jupyter notebook generates a pdf file of the LP `P`;
- `%display typeset` followed by `P` in the Jupyter notebook shows the LP.
