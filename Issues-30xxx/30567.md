<a id='comment:3'></a>Why adding `0` in the initialization `Nk = 0 + LPC[0]` ? 

This part can be further simplified

```diff
-                for i in range(Nk + 1, Nj + 1):
-                    if not i % 2:
-                        LPS.append(i - j)
-                    Nk = Nj
+                for i in range(Nk + 2 - (Nk % 2), Nj + 1, 2):
+                    LPS.append(i - j)
+                Nk = Nj
```
Since `Nj > Nk`, it ends with `Nk = Nj`. No need to assign the value multiple times
