hamming -> Hamming

Also: we have abstract linear codes, to which you can attach different metrics.
E.g. there are rank codes (on matrices, with distance being the rank of the difference), already implemented in Sage. So it would be good to have this implemented there too.

Provide a definition of the coset graph.

One day we should have additive codes (to have cosets of C, it suffices to have C an additive subgroup), so that we can also implement coset graphs for them, see e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07069

That said, I think the algorithm relies on `C` being a set of vectors. In Sagemath `MatrixSpace` is not a subtype of `VectorSpace` so I think this function will have issues if the vectors are actually matrices.

A definition for the coset graph is provided in the docstring: "the vertices are the cosets and 2 cosets are adjacent if they have representatives that differ in one coordinate". \\
I haven't found any `LinearRankMetricCode` in Sagemath that doesn't use vectors, so I could just move the `cosetGraph` method to
`AbstractLinearCodeNoMetric`. However, if you wish to use a different definition of coset graph that uses a more general metric, then we need a substantially different implementation (still doable).

As far as the dual code is concerned, if I get it right the dual code of `C` is the orthogonal complement of `C` which is not a direct sum complement of `C` if we use a non positive-definite bilinear form. So I don't see many connections when the base field is finite.
For instance:

```
sage: C = codes.GolayCode(GF(3))
sage: U = C.dual_code()
sage: U == C
True
```

I think working in a complement space, as you did, is good.

maybe something like "the vertices are the cosets of C, considered as a subgroup of the additive group of the ambient vector space, and two cosets are adjacent if they have representatives that differ in exactly one coordinate". 


> I haven't found any `LinearRankMetricCode` in Sagemath that doesn't use vectors, so I could just move the `cosetGraph` method to

hmm, no, as there is no metric at all, whereas you do use the Hamming metric.

you're right, sorry for noise at this point.
