Follow-up from #29500.

When an spkg fails to install, Sage advises:

```
[pynormaliz-2.12] If you want to try to fix the problem yourself, *don't* just cd to
[pynormaliz-2.12] /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pynormaliz-2.12 and type 'make' or whatever is appropriate.
[pynormaliz-2.12] Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
[pynormaliz-2.12] correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
[pynormaliz-2.12]   (cd '/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pynormaliz-2.12' && '/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-algebraic-2018-spring/sage' --buildsh)
```

In the shell set up with this command, one used to be able to just type `./spkg-install` to re-run the (wrapped) installation script.

#29500 inadvertently broke this for Python packages because `sdh_pip_install` now depends on an additional environment variable that is set in `sage-spkg`: `SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS`. This leads to the following error:

```
Successfully installed PyNormaliz-2.12
Removed build tracker: '/private/var/folders/38/wnh4gf1552g_crsjnv2vmmww0000gp/T/pip-req-tracker-kweqslvi'
mkdir: : No such file or directory
********************************************************************************
Error storing dist/PyNormaliz-2.12-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl
********************************************************************************
```

We fix it by setting this variable in the wrapped `spkg-install` scripts.


Blocker for 9.2 because this defect interferes with the debugging of spkg scripts; and because the priority "critical" seems to be ignored by the release management scripts.

This unpacks the tarball another time. For debugging, it is useful to make changes to the unpackaged source tree.
