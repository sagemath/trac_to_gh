The current catalog is nice to have but still very limited or incomplete. Constructing some examples in the current catalog also takes a lot of time.

While improving and extend this, it is also a good opportunity to expand the tutorials a little bit. Furthermore, most of our docstring examples are based on the 2-sphere. Hence we can perhaps shorten or simplify some parts of the documentation.

**Step 1:** rearrange folder structure (#30799)

**Step 2:** unification/improvement/extension of preexisting models

- More Flexible Coordinate Treatment for `EuclideanSpace` (#30824)
- Category of connected manifolds will be joined to spheres, Euclidean spaces and open intervals (#31243)
- Add Orientation to `EuclideanSpace`
- Sphere (#30804, #32953)
- Kerr (some inspiration may be found in the class `KerrBH` of the Sage package [kerrgeodesic_gw](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/kerrgeodesic_gw))
- Minkowski
- Torus
- Move examples from `sage.geometry.riemannian_manifolds` to `sage.manifolds` (#32228)

**Step 3:** add new examples

- Real Projective Space / Real Grassmannians (#31249, #33221)
- Complex Projective Space / Complex Grassmannians (#31249)
- Hyperbolic space (a starting point may be this [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_hyperbolic_plane.ipynb))

**Step 4:** improve the tutorial/doctests

- simplify preexisting 2-sphere examples
- add thorough tutorial with old/new models

<a id='comment:1'></a>This sounds like a very good idea!

Note that in order not to clutter the global namespace, one can let access to the sphere and the hyperbolic space via the [manifold catalog](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/catalog.html). The current version of the catalog is very primitive and the function `Sphere()` in it should call the constructor the sphere class, as soon as the latter is ready.

Ah, that is very nice. Actually, I was not aware that something like that exists. This should be populated somewhere more obvious. Probably in a tutorial?

So, the only thing that should be added now is the hyperbolic space, right?

<a id='comment:3'></a>By the way, I noticed that the result coming from `sage.manifolds.catalog.Sphere` is not even correct:

```
sage: S.<th, ph> = manifolds.Sphere()
sage: S
2-dimensional Riemannian submanifold S embedded in the Euclidean
 space E^3
sage: S.atlas()
[Chart (S, (th, ph))]
```

This is not a correct atlas.

No, there remains to introduce a proper sphere class, on the model of `EuclideanSpace`, with methods like `stereographic_coordinates`.

Indeed. As I say in comment:1, the catalog is in a primitive stage.
