The current catalog is nice to have but still very limited or incomplete. Constructing some examples in the current catalog also takes a lot of time.

While improving and extend this, it is also a good opportunity to expand the tutorials a little bit. Furthermore, most of our docstring examples are based on the 2-sphere. Hence we can perhaps shorten or simplify some parts of the documentation.

**Step 1:** rearrange folder structure (#30799)

**Step 2:** unification/improvement/extension of preexisting models

- More Flexible Coordinate Treatment for `EuclideanSpace` (#30824)
- Category of connected manifolds will be joined to spheres, Euclidean spaces and open intervals (#31243)
- Add Orientation to `EuclideanSpace`
- Sphere (#30804, #32953)
- Kerr (some inspiration may be found in the class `KerrBH` of the Sage package [kerrgeodesic_gw](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/kerrgeodesic_gw))
- Minkowski
- Torus
- Move examples from `sage.geometry.riemannian_manifolds` to `sage.manifolds` (#32228)

**Step 3:** add new examples

- Real Projective Space / Real Grassmannians (#31249, #33221)
- Complex Projective Space / Complex Grassmannians (#31249)
- Hyperbolic space (a starting point may be this [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_hyperbolic_plane.ipynb))

**Step 4:** improve the tutorial/doctests

- simplify preexisting 2-sphere examples
- add thorough tutorial with old/new models

This sounds like a very good idea!

Note that in order not to clutter the global namespace, one can let access to the sphere and the hyperbolic space via the [manifold catalog](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/catalog.html). The current version of the catalog is very primitive and the function `Sphere()` in it should call the constructor the sphere class, as soon as the latter is ready.

So, the only thing that should be added now is the hyperbolic space, right?

By the way, I noticed that the result coming from `sage.manifolds.catalog.Sphere` is not even correct:

```
sage: S.<th, ph> = manifolds.Sphere()
sage: S
2-dimensional Riemannian submanifold S embedded in the Euclidean
 space E^3
sage: S.atlas()
[Chart (S, (th, ph))]
```

This is not a correct atlas.

No, there remains to introduce a proper sphere class, on the model of `EuclideanSpace`, with methods like `stereographic_coordinates`.

Indeed. As I say in [comment:1](#comment%3A1), the catalog is in a primitive stage.

Now I see what you mean. I first thought that "primitive" was just referring to the amount of examples.

That's good: there's still work to do. :)
