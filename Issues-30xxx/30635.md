Do you think #30637 is also cbc/coin related?

Something is weird in the configuration, because I did `--enable-cbc`:

```
$ head config.log
This file contains any messages produced by compilers while
running configure, to aid debugging if configure makes a mistake.

It was created by Sage configure 9.2.beta13, which was
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.69.  Invocation command line was

So, I should not need to run `sage -i cbc` after...

I'm not completely sure of what `coin` provides apart from a linear programming solver. If I'm right, `cbc` is the branch and cut / branch and bound engine.

If installing cbc is sufficient to fix the issues, it confirms that we must clarify when we can use `coin` and when we must use `cbc`, or if `cbc` is always needed to with `coin`. 

Concerning configuration / installation, I suggest to ask Dima or Matthias.

`sage_numerical_backends_coin` does have cbc in its list of dependencies. Normal installs either using the `./configure` option  `--enable-sage_numerical_backends_coin` or `sage -i sage_numerical_backends_coin` should install cbc too.

Note, however, that `cbc` knows how to find system packages. So `--enable-cbc` does not install its own copy of `cbc` if you have one in the system.

This seems to come from this code in `vertex_cover`:

```
                b = p.get_values(b)
                cover_g = set(v for v in g if b[v] == 1)
```
which ignores the fact that a numerical solver is used and therefore `b` will include numerical noise.

well, `has_homomorphism_to` does not use `vertex_cover`, but I agree that it might be better to check e.g. `if b[v] >= .5`. Such tests are not unified (at least) in the graph module.

I have  cbc 2.10.5 installed with hombrew, and after `sage -I sage_numerical_backends_coin` I get the correct result.

```
sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(9)

OK, `has_homomorphism_to` also has code like this:

```
            p.solve(log = verbose)
            b = p.get_values(b)
            mapping = dict(x[0] for x in b.items() if x[1])
```

> but I agree that it might be better to check e.g. `if b[v] >= .5`. Such tests are not unified (at least) in the graph module.

In deed, "at least"... this is severely broken code when `solver` is a numerical solver.

Sage only has one solver backend from the COIN-OR project, and that is the CBC solver, which we use both for mixed integer linear programming and linear programming. The string `"coin"` designates the use of this backend -- see `sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend.get_solver`. 

`chc` is the name of the SPKG providing the solver. Sage does not use it directly but only via the SPKG `sage_numerical_backends_coin`, which provides the class `sage_numerical_backends_coin.coin_backend.CoinBackend`.

`g.minor()` is buggy. E.g. with `solver='ppl'` is doesn't seem to terminate on 

```
g = graphs.RandomGNP(20,.5)
g = g.subgraph(edges = g.min_spanning_tree())
g.minor(graphs.CompleteGraph(3), solver='ppl')
```

With 'glpk' instead of 'ppl' it's quick and correct (no such minor).

With Coin/cbc (from #30644, but do not forget to `make sage_numerical_backends_coin`)
it returns nonsense `{0: [], 1: [0], 2: [17]}`.

An interface bug? (both for PPL and Coin/cbc?)
