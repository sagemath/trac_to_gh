What's the value of `SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED` at that point? The only way I can reproduce that error is to put something non-empty and non-integer into that variable in the following script:

```/bin/sh

#SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED=""

if [ "${SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED}" -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "SUCCESS"
else
  echo "FAILURE"
fi
```

When the variable is empty or `1` (the only legal values?), no error is raised.

Could you reproduce the problem? Since I can't, I just wanted to be sure that `SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED` isn't somehow winding up with junk in it. If your branch fixes the problem, it's clearly more correct, so feel free to rubber stamp it on my behalf.

The change makes sense, but I can't reproduce this on OS X:

```
% echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh
% cat junk.sh
export STR1=""

if [ "${STR1}" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "hello"
fi

% source junk.sh
hello
% . ./junk.sh
hello
```
Any ideas how Volker got it?
