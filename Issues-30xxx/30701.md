What's the value of `SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED` at that point? The only way I can reproduce that error is to put something non-empty and non-integer into that variable in the following script:

```
#!/bin/sh

#SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED=""

if [ "${SAGE_ENV_CONFIG_SOURCED}" -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "SUCCESS"
else
  echo "FAILURE"
fi
```

When the variable is empty or `1` (the only legal values?), no error is raised.

The change makes sense, but I can't reproduce this on OS X:

```
% echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh
% cat junk.sh
export STR1=""

if [ "${STR1}" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "hello"
fi

% source junk.sh
hello
% . ./junk.sh
hello
```
Any ideas how Volker got it?
