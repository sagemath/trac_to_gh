The `six` package was part of the Python2-to-Python3 migration scaffolding. Since it is unlikely we will move back to supporting Python 2, we should remove it as a dependency of `sagelib` and `sage_sws2rst`.

According to https://six.readthedocs.io/#six.Iterator, in Python3 `six.Iterator` is an alias for `object`, so i simply removed the `six.Iterator` intermediate class so that `PrependIterator` directly inherits from Python object.

Here is what i have seen regarding packages indicating `six` as a dependency:

- seem not to depend on `six` anymore
  - prompt_toolkit
  - matplotlib

- require an upgrade from our side
  - traitlets
  - packaging (but not yet in a release)
  - cycler (but not in a release, as they did not release since 2016)

- require upstream to adapt
  - notedown
  - dateutil
  - tox
  - sagenb_export

Apparently, some packages depend on six but the dependency is not written in the dependency file (e.g. `sphinxcontrib_websupport`)

Merci.

> Il faudra se debarasser de `iteritems` dans un autre ticket.

It was the plan for #30850, then i noticed that various files from `SAGE_ROOT/build/` were touched by #30627, so in order to avoid useless rebasing and confusion i decided to wait it to be merged before cleaning `__future__` import statements from `SAGE_ROOT/build/`.

I mean that

```
src/sage/categories/finite_dimensional_lie_algebras_with_basis.py:                            for key, coeff in elt.to_vector().iteritems():
src/sage/categories/finite_dimensional_modules_with_basis.py:            return self._from_dict({order[i]: c for i,c in vector.iteritems()})
src/sage/symbolic/relation.py:                    return [[v._sage_() == ex._sage_() for v,ex in d.iteritems()]
```
and this may involve our own `iteritem` defined somewhere in a pyx file.
