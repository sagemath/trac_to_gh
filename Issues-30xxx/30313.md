The title of this ticket seems to suggest a setup where the jupyter server process runs on one machine and the sage kernel runs on another. That's a tricky set-up. I don't think it's one we can expect to support any time soon. It opens a whole new can of worms where the Jupyter server file browser may show entirely different files than the ones that are available to the kernel process, since there might not be a shared filesystem between the two machines.

Another other problem is the added latency: In that set-up you'd have browser <-> jupyter server <-> kernel, with each of the arrows really needing to go over networking protocols. With the guarantee that the server and the kernel process are on the same machine, the server <-> kernel communication should end up being just local pipes, for which the operating system hopefully can figure out nice optimizations.

Third, the sage kernel needs quite a few plug-ins. Keeping those synced across different machines will be even more complicated. Not impossible, but I don't think advisable unless really required.

I think all we need is instructions to connect a browser to a remote server, which isn't really a sage-specific thing (but probably something that's worth helping people with).

That's right.
