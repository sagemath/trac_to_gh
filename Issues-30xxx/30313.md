I think all we need is instructions to connect a browser to a remote server, which isn't really a sage-specific thing (but probably something that's worth helping people with).

That's right.

> Another other problem is the added latency: In that set-up you'd have browser <-> jupyter server <-> kernel, with each of the arrows really needing to go over networking protocols. With the guarantee that the server and the kernel process are on the same machine, the server <-> kernel communication should end up being just local pipes, for which the operating system hopefully can figure out nice optimizations.


Actually, the use case is exactly to improve latency, such as in an HPC environment. The head node of a shared cluster typically has abysmal interactive performance because dozens of users run stuff on it. One does not want to run the user interface on it!

Well, for example #30123 intends to fix exactly this: Replace ad-hoc installation of stuff into the notebook server by a more disciplined installation scheme: nbextensions. These can be managed and inspected in a robust and user friendly way.
