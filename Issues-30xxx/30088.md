The successful test run of the new `dist` workflow job can be seen at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/864159160

It is possible that I may need to make some adjustments to the new `local-macos-nohomebrew-nobootstrap` tests, but I'll do that in #29929 as a follow up.

OK to set it to positive review?
