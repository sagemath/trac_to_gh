Could you leave a comment in there explaining what's going on? It just took me about 20 minutes to figure out that this was failing on sage_conf because it's a standard package (which are usually incuded in SAGE_SDIST_PACKAGES) but not one whose sources need to be downloaded before being included with the source tarball (which is what the misnomer SAGE_SDIST_PACKAGES actually contains a list of). All script/pip packages should be similar, according to this change.

Also, per the description, I think we need a tox thingy.

The successful test run of the new `dist` workflow job can be seen at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/864159160

It is possible that I may need to make some adjustments to the new `local-macos-nohomebrew-nobootstrap` tests, but I'll do that in #29929 as a follow up.

OK to set it to positive review?
