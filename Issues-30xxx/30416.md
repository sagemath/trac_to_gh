Added these dependencies using the new tool described at https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.3#For_developers:_Setting_up_Python_packages_from_PyPI_as_Sage_packages

Untested so far - possibly needs more dependencies

And probably the dependencies that are only needed by `tox` should be marked as not required if system tox is found.

Here's something that will avoid installing 4 packages in this case:

I haven't added the same logic to the other packages:
- `pluggy`, `py`, `toml` -- because they will also be needed as dependencies of `pytest` (see #31110)

I'm getting build failure of sage because of this now. It's not terrible and I guess `py` isn't needed by anything. But I'm also wondering, why it is a dependency of `tox` and `pytest` in the first place. Neither of them lists `py` as a dependency. Where do we use it?

It's an `install_requires` of tox: https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/blob/master/setup.cfg
