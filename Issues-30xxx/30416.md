What was the resolution to this?

I'm getting build failure of sage because of this now. It's not terrible and I guess `py` isn't needed by anything. But I'm also wondering, why it is a dependency of `tox` and `pytest` in the first place. Neither of them lists `py` as a dependency. Where do we use it?

The missing dependency on `setuptools_scm` was added

It's an `install_requires` of tox: https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/blob/master/setup.cfg
