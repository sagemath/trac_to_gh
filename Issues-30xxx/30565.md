Fixing up a change made in #30135:

When bash is invoked as /bin/sh on macOS, `echo -n ...` does not work, leading to this output:

```
checking for the package system in use... -n (ignoring conda because no environment is active) 
homebrew
```

POSIX echo doesn't have an `-n` flag for "no trailing newline," but an easy replacement is to use printf instead.
