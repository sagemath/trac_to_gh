Truncation of polynomials over finite fields are currently implemented by calling on the Euclidean division function of FLINT and NTL. However FLINT and NTL provide special functions for truncation, which are much faster.

In this ticket, we implement an interface to the truncation functions of FLINT ant NTL and use it in the `truncate` method.

Notably, this improvement highly speeds up computations in the ring of formal series.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
Here is an example of speed up.

```
sage: k = GF(7)
sage: S.<x> = k[[]]
sage: M = random_matrix(S, 20, 20, prec=500)
```

Before the patch:

```
sage: %time _ = M.charpoly()
CPU times: user 5.19 s, sys: 3.52 ms, total: 5.2 s
Wall time: 5.2 s
```

After the patch:

```
sage: %time _ = M.charpoly()
CPU times: user 1.71 s, sys: 2.95 ms, total: 1.71 s
Wall time: 1.71 s
```
