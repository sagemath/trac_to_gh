So far the face iterator for polyhedra assumes the diamond property of the lattice only. The special case of simple/simplicial polytopes is not exploited. In this case all intervals not containing zero of the lattice are boolean (for simplicial polytopes we use the dual algorithm).

We alter the algorithm to work for lattices where every interval not containing zero is a boolean sublattice. We may even drop any further conditions on the lattice. So we may apply the algorithm to lattices, where some "edges" have only one atom.
Thus the algorithm can in principle be applied to simplicial complexes now in dual mode ("edges" with a single atom correspond to "ridges" only contained in one maximal face). The key observations are:

- To check whether an intersection of faces is zero, we check whether the atom-representation is zero. Although not unique (in case the diamond property is relaxed), it works to distinguish from zero.
 
- To intersect we now additionally unite the coatom representation. This gives the correct representation of the new face unless the intersection is zero.
 
- An intersection of two facets has always codimension 1, if not empty (they contain a common atom and are thus contained in a common boolean sublattice).

- To mark a face as visited, we save its coatom representation in `visited_all_coatom_rep`.

- To check whether we have seen a face already, we check containment of the coatom representation.

This algorithm performs much better and is also asymptotically better.

Typo: `intervalls` -> `intervals`

Bikeshedding: Personally, I find `sizeof(uint64_t **)` confusing compared to `sizeof(uint64_t**)`, where IMO is more indicative that it is a pointer. Feel free to ignore this comment.

I feel like #29676 and #29681 are more natural as dependencies of this ticket given their changes, but that is not a strong opinion. I am happy to do the review of those tickets as well. Also, beyond these to things above, this ticket LGTM.

- At some point I started doing it like `cdef uint64_t *foo`, hence the `sizeof(uint64_t *)`.

  This works well, because you can legally do `cdef uint64_t *foo, *foo2`, however I quickly stopped that because I got warnings that I'm not supposed to do this.

  Once you start declaring each pointer in its own line, you can go to `cdef uint64_t* foo`, which is more natural, I agree. I just didn't yet. I think I should have a seperate ticket that gets this stuff in order in the entire folder. At the moment everything is one style, which is also desirable, I think.

-  In principal #29676 and #29681 are more natural as dependencies of this ticket than vice versa (both are somewhat nice to review at the moment). I agree. But I don't want them to be in the way (in case they are sitting there without review). I'm happy to rebase whatever makes sense
