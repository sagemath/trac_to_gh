This is for portability testing of the Sage distribution when developing on Windows, as an alternative to using Docker.

`wsl` would be a "technology", like `local` or `docker` -
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/portability_testing.html#automatic-docker-based-build-testing-using-tox

The GH workflow for wsl testing from #30216 could then be simplified and generalized by going through tox.

This ticket is for a different purpose, namely portability testing - where you run Sage against various Linux distributions (and configurations, i.e., what system packages are installed). We do this with Docker, but on a Windows development box it may be more convenient to do it with isolated WSL instances instead.

What exactly do you want to accomplish? Do you want to add a tox command that downloads a given ubuntu distro, installs it as a wsl, installs sage including all dependencies and then run all tests in this wsl?

If that's the case, why do you want to manage the wsl installation from within tox? For integration tests, it would be easier to install wsl with a given linux distro in the github action and then run tox relative to this wsl. For development, it is also easier to let the user setup the initial wsl and reuse it.

Then you can simply install ubuntu in wsl via the Windows store, and run

```
wsl
> tox -e local-ubuntu-standard
```
That's the same amount of characters as `tox -e local-wsl-ubuntu-standard` ;-)

You would need to have a python installed in windows, then install tox via pip. Tox would usually be invoked from the "Windows Command line" or powershell console.
