This is for portability testing of the Sage distribution when developing on Windows, as an alternative to using Docker.

`wsl` would be a "technology", like `local` or `docker` -
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/portability_testing.html#automatic-docker-based-build-testing-using-tox

The GH workflow for wsl testing from #30216 could then be simplified and generalized by going through tox.

What exactly do you want to accomplish? Do you want to add a tox command that downloads a given ubuntu distro, installs it as a wsl, installs sage including all dependencies and then run all tests in this wsl?

If that's the case, why do you want to manage the wsl installation from within tox? For integration tests, it would be easier to install wsl with a given linux distro in the github action and then run tox relative to this wsl. For development, it is also easier to let the user setup the initial wsl and reuse it.

No, the point is that the tox command will automate this step so that one has a reproducible way to set up a (disposable) wsl copy.  In other words, there is not "the" initial wsl but perhaps a dozen wsls with different configurations.  By default, a wsl would be reused but the developer would be able to set it up from scratch using `tox -r`.

Thanks for your explanation. But I still don't really get why you need/want to manage the wsl installation via tox. If tox is able to configure a normal linux install, then it's only one additional step for the user to create a wsl installation with the said linux.

Moreover, typical WSL installs are of the order of 2 to 5gb (mine is 22gb, which is used exclusively for sage). That's not something you would use in a use-once-then-throw-away spirit, like docker images.

But, of course, you could move the current code in the github wsl workflow to a new tox environment. As a first step towards this, and what I would find actually more important, is to have `local-ubuntu` environments similar to `local-homebrew`.
Then you can simply install ubuntu in wsl via the Windows store, and run

```
wsl
> tox -e local-ubuntu-standard
```
That's the same amount of characters as `tox -e local-wsl-ubuntu-standard` ;-)

You would need to have a python installed in windows, then install tox via pip. Tox would usually be invoked from the "Windows Command line" or powershell console.
