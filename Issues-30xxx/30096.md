Tensors from `sage.tensor` are stored as `sage.tensor.modules.Components`, which is a dictionary with index tuples as keys.

We propose to create additional backends for numerical coordinate rings:
- https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tensor
- https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html

They provide efficient storage and GPU-accelerated computations for numerical tensors.

For SymPy, see #31946
