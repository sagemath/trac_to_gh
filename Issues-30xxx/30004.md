```
Constructed the biplanes with parameters `(79,13,2)` and `(56,11,2)`.
The constructions are added to the `BIBD_constructions` dictionary in `sage.combinat.designs.database`.

After #29959, they will be available via `designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design`.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Why do you use `biplane` rather than `BIBD` in the new function names?
(docstrings certainly should mention it).

One can also create a function `designs.biplane(k)`, with `k` being the biplane order,
which would return an example for each `k` a construction is known to exist.

As to references, look up how it is done elsewhere in this file. You'd add

```
    REFERENCES:

    .. [Aschbacher71] \M. Aschbacher,
      On collineation groups of symmetric block designs.
      J. Combinatorial Theory Ser. A 11 (1971), pp. 272–281.

    .. [Hall71] \M. Hall, Jr.,
      Combinatorial designs and groups.
      Actes du Congrès International des Mathématiciens (Nice, 1970),
      v.3, pp. 217–222. Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1971.
```

This part must only appear once.
Also, add

```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```
as the 1st line of the file, as the 2nd reference uses utf-8.


Then you can use tags
`[Aschbacher71]_` and `[Hall71]_` to describe the history in the docstrings.
(that the latter in particular fixed a typo in the former, etc)

<a id='comment:9'></a>Those matrices generate a group isomorphic to the one given.
However, I'm still looking for some concrete representation of the `P_i`'s that would take advantage of the new group.
I tried representing the `P_i`'s as vectors, projective points and matrices but with little luck.
Now I'm looking at polynomials.

If I can't find anything, then to compute the action of a matrix on `P_i` I would need to decompose the matrix into `x,y,z` and end up doing most of the ugly operations I already do.

If I understand the paper correctly, the `P_i`'s are left abstract and the orbit of `P_i` is `G/H_i`, yet `P_i != I H_i` as otherwise `P_2 = P_3`.
I was hoping for something more concrete, but I ended up reducing the action of `M` on `P_i` to basically be `P_i N` for a unique representative `N` of `M H_i`. Hence, I represent `P_i M` by the pair `(i, M)`.

My current implementation is extremely slow and it seems that the `quotient` method of `MatrixGroup` yields a `NotImplementedError`.

I'm now moving everything to GAP. Soon I'll push the new method.

<a id='comment:18'></a>I changed the `eval`'s. I don't know how to get rid of the `set_global`'s as I need to give the actions a name to use inside the `function_factory`'s.

As far as the blocks are concerned, I can change `B1, B2, B3` to the below

```
B1 = list(libgap.Orbit(H4, p1, action)) + list(libgap.Orbit(G, p2, action))
B2 = list(libgap.Orbit(H4, p1, action)) + list(libgap.Orbit(G, p3, action))
B3 = list(libgap([p1, p2, p3])) + list(libgap.Orbit(libgap.Group(Y), action(p4, X), action)) + list(libgap.Orbit(libgap.Group(Y), action(p4, X**4), action))
B1 = libgap.Set(B1)
B2 = libgap.Set(B2)
B3 = libgap.Set(B3)
```

I don't know how to write `B4` as unions of orbits.

removing a block from a symmetric BIBD(v,k,l) should give BIBD(v-k,k-l,l),

<a id='comment:29'></a>I'm now running all tests.
However, I'm a bit confused by your code examples, as on this branch the function `balanced_incomplete_block_design` only works for `lambda = 1`. Have you merged this with #29959 to run the tests? (that's actually a great idea, so I'll run the tests on this merged version)

Anyway, the `balanced_incomplete_block_design` code doesn't seem to include the recursive construction you mentioned.
I'll make a small ticket for it.
