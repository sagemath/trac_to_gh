In this ticket, I add implementations for the following decompositions:

* Decompositions for square matrices over non-archimedean local fields:
1. **Iwasawa**.
2. **Cartan**.
3. **Bruhat-Iwahori**.
4. **TSB** (T - invertible upper-triangular, S - permutation matrix (possibly with some zero-rows), B -  iwahori matrix).

* **Bruhat** decomposition for square matrices over any field.

Notes and Issues:
1. In the above decompositions, Some of the returned matrices could be defined over the integer-ring of the field, but I did not coerce them into the integer-ring, because of the bug described at: #29931.
2. To prevent any of the above decompositions from making changes to the original matrix, I used the fact that the `matrix_over_field` method returns a deep copy of the original matrix (even when the original is already defined over a field).
3. A point for consideration: as padics and formal laurent-series over finite fields are both non-archimedean local fields, I needed to make sure that the implemented methods work for both. Having a more uniform API for padics and laurent-series could  be helpful in avoiding awkward nested functions that fit different implementations for each type. For example, for getting the unit-part of an element, I had to use the `unit_part` method for padics, and `valuation_zero_part` for laurent.

This would be a good feature to have. Some very quick comments:

- Remove the `...` at the end of the docstrings.
- I think you are forgetting that a square matrix M is generally not something equal to M = A<sup>2</sup> for some other matrix A. It would be good to change the doc for this method.
- Why is `_iwasawa_normalized_form` a `@`staticmethod`? It is most natural as a normal method IMO.
- Remove the period/full-stop at the end of every `INPUT:` (short) bullet point.
- `_matrix_func_that_switches_cols_and_nullifies` should just be a function in the file that is called directly, and preferably has a shorter name.
- <code>\`iwasawa\`</code> -> <code>:meth:\`iwasawa()\`</code> I think.
- Iwasawa should be capitalized in the documentation.
- <code>\`\`self\`\`[\`\`r\`\`,\`\`c\`\`]!=0</code> -> <code>\`\`self[r,c] != 0\`\`</code>
- Remove the space before each `::` as there should be a `:` in the docstrings.
- There are lots of things that should be code formatted; e.g., in `min_valuation_in_row`.
- In `choose_min_valuation_elem`, change `TESTS::` -> `TESTS:`.
- Don't abbreviate names, especially for just 3 characters; e.g., `choose_min_valuation_elem[ent]` (min is fine though).
- I am sure many of these comments have similar analogs, such as capitalizing Bruhat. However, I have not yet skimmed everything yet.

Continuing this line of reasoning, it would be best to be in a separate file, in part to also not lengthen `matrix2.pyx` even more.

Exactly as I said, it simply is returning a function `f` it creates and this method is called exactly once in the code. Just simply use that function `f` in the one place it is called. This is a convoluted piece of code that can be simplified.

`col` is fine. As per my previous comment, you should be removing all of the methods with `func`.

    "body": "<a id='comment:17'></a>\nHi Julian, thanks again.\\\\\n1. By using the term \"square\" I indeed referred to a n*n matrix, but I understand that it was misleading so I separated the squareness check from this method, and used the existing `is_square` method for that, as you suggested.\n2. As for `_iwasawa_normalized_form`, I changed the name as you suggested. \\\\ Can you please explain, though, in what file I should put this function? I don't know what the conventions are in sage.\n3.

Hi Julian, thanks again.\\
1. By using the term "square" I indeed referred to a n*n matrix, but I understand that it was misleading so I separated the squareness check from this method, and used the existing `is_square` method for that, as you suggested.
2. As for `_iwasawa_normalized_form`, I changed the name as you suggested. \\ Can you please explain, though, in what file I should put this function? I don't know what the conventions are in sage.
3. Regarding the `_matrix_func..` methods, I have a slight problem with inserting them into the code directly (rather then as different methods). \\ To begin with, there are 3 of them, and one (`_matrix_func_that_nullifies_part_of_col`) is called 3 times from different parts of the code.

I agree that it is nice to have all these decompositions but I think that several of them are already available under different names:
- the Iwasawa decomposition is given by the Hermite normal form (see ticket #23486 I've just updated today)
- the Cartan decomposition is given by the Smith normal form
- the Bruhat decomposition can be deduced from the echelon form and the position of the pivots.

Maybe you should consider taking advantage of these normal forms to shorten your code and make it easier to review.

Also, I'm not very enthousiastic to have so many underscore helper methods. IHMO, it's better to turn them into functions and put them outside the class.

Replying to [caruso](#comment%3A18):

> - the Iwasawa decomposition is given by the Hermite normal form (see ticket #23486 I've just updated today)

>

Continuing our discussion, here are some differences between Iwasawa and Cartan to the Hermite-Normal-Form and Smith-Normal-Form:
1. The HNF and SNF implementations are more generic in the following senses:
* HNF and SNF receive also non-square matrices (whereas Iwasawa and Cartan receive only square ones).
* If I understand correctly, Iwasawa and Cartan are compatible with the specific case of `integral=True`.
* Iwasawa and Cartan work only for matrices over fields (or rings with fraction fields) which are non archemidean local (p-adics or laurent-series rings), whereas at least in the documentation of SNF, it is said that it works for any local field (not necessarily non-archemidean).
2. Optional arguments:
* In HNF and SNF you can control the accuracy of the matrices in the decomposition and you can choose whether to get the transformation matrices or rather to only get the 'main' matrix in the decomposition.
* In Iwasawa and Cartan you can get an indication to whether there was a numerical-inaccuracy issue that caused some of the output matrices to become singular rather than invertible.

3. There are some differences in the requirements for the output matrices.\\ For the record, here is a detailed description of the output in Iwasawa and Cartan, for an input matrix A:
- Iwasawa returns matrices T,K such that A=T*K :\\ K is invertible over the integer ring and T is upper triangular (note that in this implementation the transformation matrix is on the right).\\ In the normalized case T has powers of the uniformizer on diagonal, and on the right-hand side the elements are truncated starting from the valuation of the diagonal-element in that row.

- Cartan returns matrices K1,D,K2 such that A=K1*D*K2 :\\ K1,K2 are invertible over the integer ring, and D is diagonal with ascending powers of the uniformizer on diagonal (or zeros, which are considered as infinity powers).

As for Bruhat - I am not sure yet how to deduce it from the echeclon form (bearing in mind that I need to have all 3 matrices in the decomposition, rather than only the permutation matrix) but I can think about it.

The Bruhat decomposition (for GL<sub>n</sub>) is just the `LU` decomposition with the permutation matrix needed for moving the pivots being the Weyl/permutation group element defining the cell/orbit you are in.

I strongly disagree with you about the readability of `_matrix_func_that_nullifies_part_of_col` and like methods. They add useless extra layers and complexity. In this case, it is a function that simply returns a function and does nothing else.

`matrix2.pyx` is already very long and IMO all `@staticmethod`s definitely should be in a separate file as they are not for matrices in general but a very specific input.

Let's actually keep the discussion here please. I don't want to fragment things even further.

You can easily get the upper triangular case by acting by the longest element first (which simply reverses the rows), and then undoing that for the L matrix by conjugation, making it into an upper triangular matrix, and also multiplying it to the permutation matrix. Basically any other form of Borel versus opposite Borel is equivalent by some w0 multiplication. It is a simple exercise.

Could you please do the exercise for us? I tried yesterday but didn't manage to.

Besides, this paper https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01251223v2/document seems to say that what we need to compute a Bruhat decomposition is a "PLUQ decomposition revealing the rank profile"; a classical PLU decomposition is not enough.

Another hint supporting that Bruhat is a bit different from PLU is that the permutation matrix is uniquely determined for Bruhat while it is not for PLU.

`w0 A = L P U = w0 U’ w0 P U` and so `A = U’ (w0 P) U` with `U, U’` being upper triangular matrices. Perhaps because it is not PLU it matters, which is different than the usual LU decomposition algorithm. I was confusing this with the B<sup>-</sup>wB Bruhat decomposition.

Yes, `echelon_form` in sage returns a PLU decomposition and not a LPU one.
