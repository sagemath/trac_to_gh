I thought that it works. As far as I recall, when I last checked, it did.

Anyway, I plan to give a talk on the package during the next SageDays, so, I am motivated to fix it. Can you tell me what problems arose?

Here are results of a local run, with 9.2.beta14 - that's newer than this ticket, but a bit older than the current rc - they match errors seen in the logs in the ticket description.
They appear to be a result of GAP files installed in a weird place, namely:

`$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python3.7/site-packages/$SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext/gap/modular_cohomology/`

rather than `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext/gap/modular_cohomology/`. So I see

```

```

(and more failing tests due to this, as you imagine)
So the package looks for its GAP files in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage/ext/gap/modular_cohomology/`

Perhaps Matthias knows the reason for this.

It might be due to the packages now being built using Python wheels, and everything in the package goes to the `site-packages/` of the Python, rather than to the local GAP.

Probably.

So, tell me: is there an environment variable or a Sage variable that provides the location of GAP's package data?

Since this is an actual bug: Should it be fixed here (although this ticket is about downgrading several packages rather then fixing them) or on a new ticket?

Really unfortunate that the Cython code of p_group_cohomology has not been made optional Cython files in the Sage library, because then it would be easy to fix without upgrading the upstream source ball.

It is indeed weird that $SAGE_LOCAL appears twice in this path. In the sources, if I see that correctly, this path appears only once, namely setup.py (`data_files=[(os.path.join(SAGE_SHARE,"sage","ext","gap","modular_cohomology")`)

So, if I understand correctly what the error says, GAP does indeed try to find the GAP code in that folder, and the real question is why the code hasn't been installed there during package installation.

I stand corrected: There are some places in the file auxiliaries.py, something like `gap.Read(os.path.join(SAGE_SHARE,'sage','ext','gap','modular_cohomology','GapMaxels.g'))`. However, `$SAGE_SHARE` used only once in the path.

A clean solution would be to have a Sage or an environment variable giving the location of code of Gap extensions.

You can call GAP and examine `GAPInfo.RootPaths`. When looking for a package, GAP appends `pkg/` to each directory in this list, cf. `9.2 GAP Root Directories` in its manual.

IMHO, Python wheels are build to be relocateable, so it's futile to try to install GAP
data via setup.py. I'd say, install a GAP package separately, not from `setup.py` from `spkg-install`.  By the way, GAP now has its own package manager. Maybe you can use it (https://github.com/gap-packages/PackageManager) - it's in `gap_packages`, I think.

Can you elaborate? At some point in the past, I suggested to change the p_group_cohomology spkg as follows:

- Its Python and Cython code should go into the Sage library, the Cython files being optional extension modules.
- Its .c files should remain an spkg, that also is the dependency of the optional extension modules.
- I now suggest, as SAGE_LOCAL/share/sage has gone, to keep the .g files in the package, but install them into SAGE_LOCAL/share/p_group_cohomology

Do you suggest this, or something else?

It used to be a problem that the documentation of the optional Cython modules would not be built. Is there a way around?

EDIT: Is it possible to advise Sage's test suite to only run the tests of a particular file if a certain optional package is installed? Or is it still only possible for individual tests? I'd find it extremely awkward to mark each individual doctest as `# optional: p_group_cohomology`.

You could either ship them with that spkg that provides the C library and then install it in `SAGE_LOCAL/share/p_group_cohomology` (or, more precisely, in the configured install prefix of your C library.

Or, if you want to ship it with sagelib, then (as I commented in #28711) these files should be put alongside the Python modules.  sagelib and other Python packages have no business writing into $SAGE_LOCAL.

OK, that was what I have suggested in the past, but what was refused by other developers.

Crucial point, from my point of view: Documentation and doc tests, as explained in my other posts. Are these problems of optional extension modules solved?

How do you define "can"? David Green, the original author of the c-code (that originally hasn't even been a library but only a couple of executables) has used them via command line, but I think he is the only one who ever did.

I'd say: I do not intend to ever publish the c-code outside of the Sage ecosystem.

That's what is currently happening.

I don't.

This version of "can" is good enough.

As long as you build this library using standard tools (preferably autotools) instead of Sage-specific scripts, and the C library does not depend on the Sage library, this is all fine.

I think a hotfix for p_group_cohomology, to install GAP files into the right place, using SAGE_LOCAL, despite being blasphemy in the Temple of Python, can be done very quickly.

Just add `sdh_install` call to `spkg-install`, which will put them where the package expects.

See my comment 39 at #28711: Apparently Sage prepends the absolute path `os.path.join(SAGE_SHARE,"sage","ext","gap","modular_cohomology")` with $SAGE_DESTDIR. Same problem with the Singular LIB.

So, I guess the real hotfix is to tell me: How should I provide a RELATIVE path in which to install the GAP respectively Singular code? Would it just work to write

```python
  data_files=[ ( os.path.join( "share", "gap", "pkg", "modular_cohomology" ),
                 [ os.path.join( "pGroupCohomology", "GapMaxels.g" ),
                   os.path.join( "pGroupCohomology", "GapMB.g" ),
                   os.path.join( "pGroupCohomology", "GapSgs.g" ) ] ),
               ( os.path.join( "share", "singular", "LIB" ),
                 [ os.path.join( "pGroupCohomology","dickson.lib" ) ] ) ]
```
?

EDIT: I'd also need to change the places in `auxiliaries.py`, because currently the install path for the GAP helpers is SAGE_SHARE/sage/ext/gap/modular_cohomology, not SAGE_SHARE/gap/pkg/modular_cohomology. But SAGE_SHARE/sage has gone.
