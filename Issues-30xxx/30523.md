```
The bug could be reproduced by running the following code:

```
PolynomialRing(SR, names="x")("x^2 + q").roots()
```

Expected return value: [(-sqrt(-q), 1), (sqrt(-q), 1)]
Actual return value: [(0, 2)]

In this case, the determinant is neither negative nor positive, but we
must not conclude that it is zero;  it might not be real.
