```
The bug could be reproduced by running the following code:

```
PolynomialRing(SR, names="x")("x^2 + q").roots()
```

Expected return value: [(-sqrt(-q), 1), (sqrt(-q), 1)]
Actual return value: [(0, 2)]

In this case, the determinant is neither negative nor positive, but we
must not conclude that it is zero;  it might not be real.


Depends on #30522

Lgtm, but I am missing something, or would something like

```
if D == 0:
    l = [(-coeffs[1]/2/coeffs[2]), 2]
elif D < 0:
    l = [((-coeffs[1]-I*sqrt(-D))/2/coeffs[2], 1),
            ((-coeffs[1]+I*sqrt(-D))/2/coeffs[2], 1)]
else:
    l = [((-coeffs[1]-sqrt(D))/2/coeffs[2], 1),
            ((-coeffs[1]+sqrt(D))/2/coeffs[2], 1)]
```
be even better? (As it would bypass Maxima for non-real D too.)
