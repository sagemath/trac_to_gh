sage: F = Family([0, 1, 4, 9])
sage: F[2]
4
sage: F[2:]
(4, 9)
```
This happens to work because it is passed on to `list.__item__`.
But:

```
sage: F = Family({0:0, 2:4, 3:9})       # note 1 is missing
sage: F[2]
4
sage: F[2:]
TypeError: unhashable type: 'slice'     # currently
```

In this ticket, we add slice support to `Family`.

```
sage: F[2:]
TypeError: unhashable type: 'slice'     # currently
(4, 9)                                  # with this ticket

sage: F[0:3]
IndexError: 1 not in family             # with this ticket
```


As an extension, we will give elements of `CombinatorialFreeModule` convenient slice accessors like those available for `FreeModule` and `FiniteRankFreeModule`.

```
sage: F = FreeModule(QQ, 6)
sage: F.basis()[2:4]

<a id='comment:10'></a>I am not sure about half-open slices. For example, what is the expected result of this?

```
sage: F = Family({0:0, 2:4, 3:9, 10:10})
sage: F[2:]
```

I would probably expect an error, as the keys `4..9` are missing, but it is not possible to obtain this information efficiently from the dictionary.

What you are essentially asking for is a slice of a `dict`. However, I don't think this makes a lot of sense.

Also, what do you do when the keys are not (and cannot be) ordered?

I think this is fine when the `Family` object is list-like, but in general, I doubt it is possible to get something consistent.

Indeed, it might be better if it does not raise an error, especially if the example from the description is an intended use case in which a slice is used to restrict the support of an element in `CombinatorialFreeModule`.

This is also consistent with ordinary use of slices, as the following does not throw an error either:

```
sage: [0,1,2][0:10]
[0, 1, 2]
```

> Also, what do you do when the keys are not (and cannot be) ordered?


I think it is fine to focus on the case in which the keys are integers for now.
