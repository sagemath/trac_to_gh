```

Per previous tickets (#29490, #29792), we avoid brial 1.2.5 for the same reason. 

Here it is 1.2.8 that crashes, illustrating once more why version number based tests are not robust enough.

The segfaults seem to have disappeared in more recent runs (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/hobZzw74Rv0/0CkgcJYjCgAJ), so perhaps this was just a Debian bug.
