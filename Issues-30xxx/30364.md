`debian-sid` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/985563463) and `debian-bullseye`:

```

Per previous tickets (#29490, #29792), we avoid brial 1.2.5 for the same reason. 

Here it is 1.2.8 that crashes, illustrating once more why version number based tests are not robust enough.

an explicit test on 1.2.5 was rather unclear how to accomplish, thus I opted for banning a version.
