Add github action workflow that checks the build of sage in a conda environment, completely bypassing the installation of any sage package. This is based on the steps outlined at https://wiki.sagemath.org/Conda.

This also tests that the generated `src/environment*.yml` files work correctly. (See documentation added in #28745)

Run: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/actions/workflows/ci-conda.yml

Fixes:
- #33330: primecountpy is not installed in the conda env because its not listed in `environment.yml`
- environment-optional: lcalc 1 is installed and then not recognized / leads to error

```
building 'sage.libs.lcalc.lcalc_Lfunction' extension
    cc1plus: warning: command line option '-Wstrict-prototypes' is valid for C/ObjC but not for C++
    In file included from sage/libs/lcalc/lcalc_Lfunction.cpp:740:
    sage/libs/lcalc/lcalc_sage.h:1:10: fatal error: lcalc/L.h: No such file or directory
        1 | #include "lcalc/L.h"
          |          ^~~~~~~~~~~
    compilation terminated.
```
- environment-optional: probably related, pari 2.11.4 is installed by conda instead of the newest 2.13.2. This version is then rejected by `configure` as being too old.
- Disable conda distro information for `gdb` because it is broken on macOS.
- Add conda distro information for `lrcalc_python`
- Filter out conda-specific `ld` warnings in doctests
- In the feature test for `sage_spkg`, check whether any Sage packages are actually installed
- Include an upper version bound for `ptyprocess` in sagemath-standard's install-requires

Something like https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/blob/public/build/conda_gh/.github/workflows/ci-conda.yml?

This currently fails with

```

Any idea what could be the reason and how to fix it?

Current status:

- Installing sagelib on top of a conda works, but many doctests fail.

Could this be related to the fact that libcc1 is installed in `lib64`?

> As `on-top-of-spkg` turns out to be a variant of `local-conda-forge-ubuntu-standard`, I think I would want to implement this variant using tox.

I thought about using tox as well, but there are

a) problems setting up conda on github actions (this is why the workflow uses a special action for the conda setup) 

b) difficulties with conda and tox environment interactions (which I guess are handled by the tox-conda plugin, but I didn't wanted to dive into this)

c) I still think tox is not the right tool for managing the user's environment beyond the Python environment.

`local-conda-forge-ubuntu-standard` has been running for months on GH Actions, see for example https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/1553907433 for 9.3.beta4.

#31099 is just a matter of creating a variant that uses `conda env create -f environment.yml` instead of `conda install ...`.

Could be. But the point of this ticket is to add the github action, so that one can fix these issues in follow-up tickets and have a direct verification. It might take quite some time until this workflow is green, especially since there are probably quite a few tests that fail.

So except if you think that there is something fundamentally flawed with the current steps which result in the lcalc error, this should be ready for review.

I don't think it will be that easy to solve:

```

 > package libeantic-1.0.2-hf1f868f_1 requires antic >=0.2.4,<0.3.0a0, but none of the providers can be installed

mamba install arb=2.21.1 -n sage-dev
 > package e-antic-1.0.2-hf1f868f_0 requires arb >=2.19.0,<2.20.0a0, but none of the providers can be installed
```
I appears that there is a funny cyclic dependency thing going on.

I still don't understand why it's so important that sage's configure script accepts conda's python, but I've added the explicit `--with-python` argument.

As I said before in [comment:70](#comment%3A70), [comment:92](#comment%3A92), etc., the configure script should really be invoked with `--with-system-xyz=force` for all packages for which we have `spkg-configure.m4`.

For example, this one about `ecl-config` is the result of the misconfiguration. The configure script does not accept system ecl because of the misconfiguration `--without-system-gcc`. So the configuration reflects use of an ECL built using SPKG (which is not done because `make` is not involved).

Failing early is good.

No, because we do not want to send developers to manually diagnose build or run problems that have already been diagnosed and codified in our configure tests.

What about adding a warning annotation in the github workflow when a system package is not recognized? Then you still get the information that the config didn't work as expected but keep the benefit of seeing error messages. This should become helpful down the road, as the conda packages are quite up to date and thus may fail to be recognized for the simple reason that they are too new.

OK, here's why it does not accept it when the (questionable, but perhaps currently necessary) option `--prefix=$CONDA_PREFIX` is given:
`build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4` has these lines:

```
    if test -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc"; then
        # Special value for SAGE_INSTALL_GCC if GCC is already installed
        SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=exists
        # Set yes since this implies we have already installed GCC and want to keep
        # it selected
        sage_spkg_install_gcc=yes

        # Check whether it actually works...
        # See https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24599
        SAGE_CHECK_BROKEN_GCC()

Thanks. From config.log:

## --------------------------------------------------- ##
## Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG gc... ##
## --------------------------------------------------- ##
configure:19428: checking whether any of libatomic_ops is installed as or will be installed as SPKG

configure:19440: checking whether we run on WSL

This is why `ecl` and `homfly` are not used.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

When a Sage user/developer follows our (to-be-updated) instructions with `--with-system-standard-packages=force` and it gives the configure error regarding the unsuitable system package, there is a clear recourse: Find and install a version that works.

When Sage developers see this in the CI run, there is also a clear course of action: Adjust the conda-specific version constraints in `conda.txt` files if possible; or file a conda bug report. 

Seeing error messages from using a system package that `configure` knows to reject does not help. It only leads to developers engaging in unproductive guesswork. 

For updating Sage and our `spkg-configure.m4` scripts to work with new versions, local development and testing on many platforms is necessary anyway; it does not help if there's 1 platform that already speculatively displays some errors.

It seems that you are attempting to run Sage from an unpacked source
tarball, but you have not compiled it yet (or maybe the build has not
finished). You should run `make` in the Sage root directory first.
If you did not intend to build Sage from source, you should download
a binary tarball instead. Read README.txt for more information.

Is this a consequence of me merging the latest develop branch, or did I accidentally misconfigured something?
How can one overwrite this check?

This is still accomplished with the current problem matchers, and even easier. Developer looks at the workflow run, sees that system packages are not accepted and can take action. In addition, she can directly see what errors result from not accepting the system package.

I don't see any advantage in hiding useful information (what does break because of the missing package).

There are also people that don't know much about these configure scripts but still want to work on the conda environment.

The point of this ticket (at least for me), is having a CI infrastructure to confirm that updates to the conda evniroment such as #33330 and #33358 indeed have a positive impact. For this it is not helpful if the workflow exists early because some conda package got updated in the meantime and now the corresponding "system" package is rejected by sage.

To be honest, I feel tired by this discussion and think we already invested more time discussing pros and cons then developer will ever spend while chasing mysterious bugs potentially coming from this. If its so important to you, I would like to ask you to implement it in a follow-up ticket.

Can we please do this in a follow-up ticket (i.e. remove the force for now). This has nothing to do with the github action action in this ticket.

Similarly, the changes to the conda package versions / package names should go to their own tickets (based on this ticket here to check if they indeed work as intended).

this looks to me like a bug in `m4/ppl.m4`. They extract `-L`, etc, flags into `PPL_LDFLAGS` but forget
to append them to `LDFLAGS` for testing in `AC_RUN_IF_ELSE`. Something like this should make it work
(assuming these flags are getting into `PPL_LDFLAGS` at all):

And which advantages does one now gain from the fact that the github workflow already quits after the configure step, and doesn't run build and tests?

Moreover, after the change with the force parameter the github matcher is no longer working correctly since now " no suitable system package; this is an error" is displayed in the logs.

Yes, the fix to `src/sage/features/pkg_systems.py` could perhaps have been made a separate ticket and a dependency here. But it would have been difficult to test it separately because the present ticket is its only use case.

Sometimes the scope of a ticket needs to be adjusted during development. You already know that sometimes the scope turns out to be too big and it is necessary break out smaller, more manageable and more clearly defined tickets.

But sometimes the scope of a ticket also turns out to be too small and the ticket is not viable on its own. This is what happened on the present ticket. The workflow documented in the wiki https://wiki.sagemath.org/Conda has never actually worked. Creating a GH Actions workflow based on a semi-quasi-working variant of it, by itself was not convincing as a ticket (comment:121 - "what does it test").

With the broader scope of actually fixing this way of installing Sage and testing something that we can recommend to developers, the ticket has a viable scope: The changes bring a clear improvement to Sage. \n\nIn general I agree that a ticket has to have a clear scope and improvement. For this ticket here, the github workflow essentially didn't change in the past 4 weeks, and at this point it was already clear that the workflow works in principle, with the caveat that a lot of docstests failed. In my opinion, it would have been better to merge the ticket already (with the few additional improvements to the workflow that we have discussed), then follow-up tickets could have easily improved different aspects of the conda environment, while the previous runs of the ci would have served as a baseline. Even thinks like the addition of the tests for macos could have been small follow-up tickets. I really think the tendency of the sage developers to create a lot of parallel, inter-dependent tickets makes reviewing harder and slows down the process. A more linear approach would increase the dev experience and velocity in my opinion.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy that this ticket is finally ready to be merged.",

> But sometimes the scope of a ticket also turns out to be too small and the ticket is not viable on its own. This is what happened on the present ticket. The workflow documented in the wiki https://wiki.sagemath.org/Conda has never actually worked. Creating a GH Actions workflow based on a semi-quasi-working variant of it, by itself was not convincing as a ticket (comment:121 - "what does it test"). With the broader scope of actually fixing this way of installing Sage and testing something that we can recommend to developers, the ticket has a viable scope: The changes bring a clear improvement to Sage. 

In general I agree that a ticket has to have a clear scope and improvement. For this ticket here, the github workflow essentially didn't change in the past 4 weeks, and at this point it was already clear that the workflow works in principle, with the caveat that a lot of docstests failed. In my opinion, it would have been better to merge the ticket already (with the few additional improvements to the workflow that we have discussed), then follow-up tickets could have easily improved different aspects of the conda environment, while the previous runs of the ci would have served as a baseline. Even thinks like the addition of the tests for macos could have been small follow-up tickets. I really think the tendency of the sage developers to create a lot of parallel, inter-dependent tickets makes reviewing harder and slows down the process. A more linear approach would increase the dev experience and velocity in my opinion.

Anyway, I'm happy that this ticket is finally ready to be merged.

The project generally uses a standard for tickets higher than that.
Yes, there's a tradeoff between velocity and stability.
