Add github action workflow that checks the build of sage in a conda environment, completely bypassing the installation of any sage package. This is based on the steps outlined at https://wiki.sagemath.org/Conda.

This also tests that the generated `src/environment*.yml` files work correctly. (See documentation added in #28745)

Run: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/actions/workflows/ci-conda.yml

Fixes:
- #33330: primecountpy is not installed in the conda env because its not listed in `environment.yml`
- environment-optional: lcalc 1 is installed and then not recognized / leads to error

```
building 'sage.libs.lcalc.lcalc_Lfunction' extension
    cc1plus: warning: command line option '-Wstrict-prototypes' is valid for C/ObjC but not for C++
    In file included from sage/libs/lcalc/lcalc_Lfunction.cpp:740:
    sage/libs/lcalc/lcalc_sage.h:1:10: fatal error: lcalc/L.h: No such file or directory
        1 | #include "lcalc/L.h"
          |          ^~~~~~~~~~~
    compilation terminated.
```
- environment-optional: probably related, pari 2.11.4 is installed by conda instead of the newest 2.13.2. This version is then rejected by `configure` as being too old.
- Disable conda distro information for `gdb` because it is broken on macOS.
- Add conda distro information for `lrcalc_python`
- Filter out conda-specific `ld` warnings in doctests
- In the feature test for `sage_spkg`, check whether any Sage packages are actually installed
- Include an upper version bound for `ptyprocess` in sagemath-standard's install-requires

I thought about using tox as well, but there are

a) problems setting up conda on github actions (this is why the workflow uses a special action for the conda setup) 

b) difficulties with conda and tox environment interactions (which I guess are handled by the tox-conda plugin, but I didn't wanted to dive into this)

c) I still think tox is not the right tool for managing the user's environment beyond the Python environment.

Could be. But the point of this ticket is to add the github action, so that one can fix these issues in follow-up tickets and have a direct verification. It might take quite some time until this workflow is green, especially since there are probably quite a few tests that fail.

So except if you think that there is something fundamentally flawed with the current steps which result in the lcalc error, this should be ready for review.

Nope, its installing lcalc 1.23 h0d16fac_1004 conda-forge. That's probably the reason why its not working.

I don't think it will be that easy to solve:

```
mamba install lcalc=2.0.5 -n sage-dev
 > package libeantic-1.0.2-hf1f868f_1 requires antic >=0.2.4,<0.3.0a0, but none of the providers can be installed

mamba install arb=2.21.1 -n sage-dev
 > package e-antic-1.0.2-hf1f868f_0 requires arb >=2.19.0,<2.20.0a0, but none of the providers can be installed
```
I appears that there is a funny cyclic dependency thing going on.

For the record: first installing `environment.yml` and then updating the env to `environment-optional.yml` yields the following downgrade of packgages:

But doesn't this trigger errors as soon as a system package is rejected? That currently happens with a lot of packages as you can see in the github workflow.

Moreover, we have complete control over which versions we install in the conda systems, so one could actually skip the whole system check that ̀ configure` currently performs.

Otherwise configure fails with

For example, this one about `ecl-config` is the result of the misconfiguration. The configure script does not accept system ecl because of the misconfiguration `--without-system-gcc`. So the configuration reflects use of an ECL built using SPKG (which is not done because `make` is not involved).

Not sure if that's really a good idea or if it would be better to just exclude versions of conda packages that are known to not work. But regardless, adding these force statements doesn't currently work.

Failing early is good.

No, because we do not want to send developers to manually diagnose build or run problems that have already been diagnosed and codified in our configure tests.

Locally this fails, output can be found at https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/runs/5189468934?check_suite_focus=true in a bit.

It accepts the conda gcc if I remove the `--prefix=$CONDA_PREFIX` part. But then a few other packages are still not properly recognized:  `ecl bdw-gc libhomfly` (which was the reason why I added the prefix in the first place). Nothing of this is specific to the github action and can easily be investigated after creating a conda env locally.

But can we do this error analysis and corresponding improvements please in a follow-up ticket?

What about adding a warning annotation in the github workflow when a system package is not recognized? Then you still get the information that the config didn't work as expected but keep the benefit of seeing error messages. This should become helpful down the road, as the conda packages are quite up to date and thus may fail to be recognized for the simple reason that they are too new.

OK, here's why it does not accept it when the (questionable, but perhaps currently necessary) option `--prefix=$CONDA_PREFIX` is given:
`build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4` has these lines:

```
    if test -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc"; then
        # Special value for SAGE_INSTALL_GCC if GCC is already installed
        SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=exists
        # Set yes since this implies we have already installed GCC and want to keep
        # it selected
        sage_spkg_install_gcc=yes

        # Check whether it actually works...
        # See https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24599
        SAGE_CHECK_BROKEN_GCC()
[...]
```

Thanks. From config.log:

```
## --------------------------------------------------- ##
## Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG gc... ##
## --------------------------------------------------- ##
configure:19428: checking whether any of libatomic_ops is installed as or will be installed as SPKG
configure:19437: result: no
configure:19440: checking whether we run on WSL
configure:19444: result: yes; disabling using of system gc
configure:19693: no suitable system package found for SPKG gc
```
This is why `ecl` and `homfly` are not used.

This one is pretty subtle. `gc` is used by both ECL and libhomfly. So only if BOTH can be used from the system, then we do not need to build `gc` itself.

Upstream says one has to check that

```
strings /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgc.so | grep "Wrong __data_start/_end pair"
``` 
does not find anything. But this rules out all 8.0.4 (and possibly earlier) installations of libgc, not only broken ones.

I meant as a github annotation. Just run configure without `-with-system = force`. Then configure will print "no suitable system package; standard, will be installed as an SPKG", which is detected and reported in the action overview.

Is this a consequence of me merging the latest develop branch, or did I accidentally misconfigured something?

Wait, I missed that you said "run configure without `-with-system = force`".

This is still accomplished with the current problem matchers, and even easier. Developer looks at the workflow run, sees that system packages are not accepted and can take action. In addition, she can directly see what errors result from not accepting the system package.

I don't see any advantage in hiding useful information (what does break because of the missing package).

There are also people that don't know much about these configure scripts but still want to work on the conda environment.

The point of this ticket (at least for me), is having a CI infrastructure to confirm that updates to the conda evniroment such as #33330 and #33358 indeed have a positive impact. For this it is not helpful if the workflow exists early because some conda package got updated in the meantime and now the corresponding "system" package is rejected by sage.

To be honest, I feel tired by this discussion and think we already invested more time discussing pros and cons then developer will ever spend while chasing mysterious bugs potentially coming from this. If its so important to you, I would like to ask you to implement it in a follow-up ticket.

Yes, and they can do that as I explained in comment:181. They don't need to see the errors if they don't want to work on the configure scripts.

Can we please do this in a follow-up ticket (i.e. remove the force for now). This has nothing to do with the github action action in this ticket.

Similarly, the changes to the conda package versions / package names should go to their own tickets (based on this ticket here to check if they indeed work as intended).

to append them to `LDFLAGS` for testing in `AC_RUN_IF_ELSE`. Something like this should make it work
(assuming these flags are getting into `PPL_LDFLAGS` at all):

And which advantages does one now gain from the fact that the github workflow already quits after the configure step, and doesn't run build and tests?

Moreover, after the change with the force parameter the github matcher is no longer working correctly since now " no suitable system package; this is an error" is displayed in the logs.

Yes, the fix to `src/sage/features/pkg_systems.py` could perhaps have been made a separate ticket and a dependency here. But it would have been difficult to test it separately because the present ticket is its only use case.

Sometimes the scope of a ticket needs to be adjusted during development. You already know that sometimes the scope turns out to be too big and it is necessary break out smaller, more manageable and more clearly defined tickets.

But sometimes the scope of a ticket also turns out to be too small and the ticket is not viable on its own. This is what happened on the present ticket. The workflow documented in the wiki https://wiki.sagemath.org/Conda has never actually worked. Creating a GH Actions workflow based on a semi-quasi-working variant of it, by itself was not convincing as a ticket (comment:121 - "what does it test"). With the broader scope of actually fixing this way of installing Sage and testing something that we can recommend to developers, the ticket has a viable scope: The changes bring a clear improvement to Sage.

In general I agree that a ticket has to have a clear scope and improvement. For this ticket here, the github workflow essentially didn't change in the past 4 weeks, and at this point it was already clear that the workflow works in principle, with the caveat that a lot of docstests failed. In my opinion, it would have been better to merge the ticket already (with the few additional improvements to the workflow that we have discussed), then follow-up tickets could have easily improved different aspects of the conda environment, while the previous runs of the ci would have served as a baseline. Even thinks like the addition of the tests for macos could have been small follow-up tickets. I really think the tendency of the sage developers to create a lot of parallel, inter-dependent tickets makes reviewing harder and slows down the process. A more linear approach would increase the dev experience and velocity in my opinion.

Anyway, I'm happy that this ticket is finally ready to be merged.

The project generally uses a standard for tickets higher than that.
