Follow-up from #30299 (Minimal fix for broken jupyter notebook):

Sage creates a broken symlink

```
local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath/doc -> /doesnotexist/html/en
```
which blocks `jupyter kernelspec install` into a system Jupyter using the instructions from #30476:

```
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/shutil.py", line 368, in copytree
    raise Error(errors)
shutil.Error: [('/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-clean/local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath/doc', '/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath/doc', "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-clean/local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath/doc'")]

It is not completely clear to me why we "poison" all of these directory names. The comment "# We also poison all directories below SAGE_LOCAL" seems like an aside, as if this may not be necessary. Any comments?

Also, does this affect bdist production?

I don't know if the bdist does anything special about these symlinks. If it does not, then it is broken currently and will be fixed by this ticket as well.

Instead of "poisoning" these variables, why don't we unset them instead, and then let `sage.env` derive the correct defaults it would use when installing sagelib independently of the sage distribution?

The one exception would be SAGE_ROOT, but I think instead of setting it to a bogus value it, and another other paths derived from it, should be set to `None`.  Then we'll most likely get a crash if any of those variables are used during build/installation.

The point of the poisoning is that defaults are NOT used.
