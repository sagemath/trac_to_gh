Follow-up from #30299 (Minimal fix for broken jupyter notebook):

Sage creates a broken symlink

```
local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath/doc -> /doesnotexist/html/en
```
which blocks `jupyter kernelspec install` into a system Jupyter using the instructions from #30476:

```
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/shutil.py", line 368, in copytree
    raise Error(errors)
shutil.Error: [('/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-clean/local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath/doc', '/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath/doc', "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/worktree-clean/local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath/doc'")]

It is not completely clear to me why we "poison" all of these directory names. The comment "# We also poison all directories below SAGE_LOCAL" seems like an aside, as if this may not be necessary. Any comments?

Also, does this affect bdist production?

The point of the poisoning is that defaults are NOT used.
