These files were added in #29287 (SPKG type: Make "normal/script/pip" orthogonal to "base/standard/optional/experimental") for all pip packages. 

We record "abstract" version requirements in files `build/pkgs/SPKG/install-requires.txt` - this is #30719.

In this ticket, we additionally record "concrete" versions for all Python packages in `build/pkgs/SPKG/requirements.txt`.

(cf. https://packaging.python.org/discussions/install-requires-vs-requirements/)

Some scripts need updating to make sure that `checksums.ini` wins over `requirements.txt` - to keep normal packages normal.

Not sure if we can use pipenv as a drop in solution. 

For various Python packages, we currently have to use patches or special build steps.
