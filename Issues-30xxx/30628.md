Thanks!

I would say that size, style, weight and opacity should be changeable as well, as they are for `text3d` and for 2D plots.

Independently sounds better. 

> 3. Would this apply to only the axis label ("x", "y", "z") or also the coordinate labels?


For 2D plots, one can change the size of the axis label independently from the size of the coordinate labels. It would be nice to be able to do so for 3D plots, but IMHO this feature is less important than 2 and 3 above.

Why not, but this may require too much work. Also, I don't think we have this for 2D plots and maybe things should be consistent between 2D and 3D graphics.

The style for the coordinates is not presently customizable independently of the axis names. The axis name would need to be broken out into a separate label from the middle coordinate. That could be done in a follow-up ticket if there's demand for that level of customization.

I shall attach an example plot with each axis customized. It was generated using:

```python
sage: style = [dict(color='red', fontweight='bold'),
....:          dict(fontsize=20, fontfamily='Times New Roman, Georgia, serif'),
....:          dict(fontstyle='italic', opacity=0.5)]
sage: show(dodecahedron(), axes_labels_style=style)
