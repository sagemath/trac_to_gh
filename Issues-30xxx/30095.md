`FiniteRankFreeModule` defines a method `exterior_power`, creating an instance of `ExtPowerFreeModule`.

We propose to add a method `symmetric_power` and class `SymPowerFreeModule`. (More generally, we could have submodules of tensors with prescribed symmetries; this is currently only available on the level of elements, not parents.)

They will be submodules of `TensorFreeModule`s. (#30169 makes `ExtPowerFreeModule`s quotients.)

The existing method `FiniteRankFreeModule.sym_bilinear_form` might be changed to produce elements of it for p=2.



Depends on #30229

I think one has to be very careful here, especially with the last proposal. If the base field has not characteristic zero, as described also on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_algebra#Relationship_with_symmetric_tensors), a symmetric bilinear form cannot be identified with an element of the symmetric algebra.

**Addendum:** I just noticed, we are not even in the manifold setting.
