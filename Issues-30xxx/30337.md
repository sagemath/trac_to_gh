<a id='comment:14'></a>I cannot reproduce the error.

All my code do is calling `Graph(edges, format='list_of_edges')`.
The `edges` list is **long** (6652854) but I believe the code path (i.e. the full stack of function calls) should not differ from `Graph([(0,1)], format='list_of_edges')`.

I can change the doctest to importing `BilinearFormsGraph` directly from `sage.graphs.generators.distance_regular` if this solves the issue, but I don't know how to test it myself.
