  [dochtml]   [libs     ] libsasl2.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [dochtml]   OSError: WARNING: autodoc: failed to import module 'giac' from module 'sage.libs'; the following exception was raised:
```

Apparently our configure test for a working `libcurl` does not notice that this library dependency of libcurl on libsasl2 is unsatisfied.

Critical for Sage 9.2 because it is a regression in platform support
