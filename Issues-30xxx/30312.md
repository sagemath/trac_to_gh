Also moved `AztecDiamondGraph` to families of graphs rather than basic structures.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Yes, I've changed it and also merged #30303 (with the update to 9.2.beta8).
If #29886 will take too much time, I could remove the dependency and generate the needed matrices with the `...FormsGraph` method.
This is what I initially did ages ago.

Of course as soon as #29886 or something similar gets fixed, I can change back these functions to something neater.

For $n = 3$ we find a distance-regular graph with intersection array

<a id='comment:14'></a>Having the latter should allow a more economic definition of the Hermitian case, as a product of the symmetric forms graph over GF(r) and alternating forms graph over GF(r).

It's the product, in the sense that vertices are pairs, 2 vertices (a,b) and (c,d) are adjacent iff 
rk(a-c+i(b-d))=1, where i is a generator of GF(q) over GF(r).
(If I'm not mistaken, rk(a-c+i(b-d))=1 may be expressed as "either rk(a-c)+rk(b-d)<2, or
rk(a-c)=rk(b-d)=1, Ker(a-c)=Ker(b-d).)

I think these graphs have the same intersection array of the Brouwer-Pasechnik graph (https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0475).
You definitely know if I'm wrong.

The construction given for that graph is easy and works in O(E), so I chose that one over the symmetric matrices one.
Of course we could have both if you wish.

I'll still try this construction. Could you clarify what you mean by "a generator of GF(q) over GF(r)"?
Do you mean $i \in GF(q)$ s.t. $i$ generated $GF(q) / GF(r)$ as vector spaces over $GF(r)$?

in fact, yes, sure, https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0475 points out to https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/drg/ch9 and discusses the relation between the two. There is something with q being even or odd there, so beware of details.

Totally agree, also `graphs.AlternatingFormsGraph` is too slow.

I thought that the "product" construction was meant to solve the issue with the `HermitianFormsGraph`.

Not all matrices are constructed by pairs where 1 vectors is in all pairs (above (0, 1, 1, 2)):

This time the vector (0, 1, 2, 0) in multiplied by 2 when it appears as v

I give up on further improving this for the time being (this seems to be a non-trivial maths question).

I can avoid computing ranks, but while in `AlternatingFormsGraph` and `HermitianFormsGraph` I was representing a form by the vector of the upper triangular entries, in `BilinearFormsGraph` I need the whole matrix.

I can try using the MatrixSpace without `implementation=meataxe` or "flattening" all matrices to vectors, but we'll lose speed.
