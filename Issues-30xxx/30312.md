Added three families of distance regular graphs, they are based, respectively, on bilinear forms, alternating forms and hermitian forms.

Also moved `AztecDiamondGraph` to families of graphs rather than basic structures.

Depends on #30303

Yes, I've changed it and also merged #30303 (with the update to 9.2.beta8).
If #29886 will take too much time, I could remove the dependency and generate the needed matrices with the `...FormsGraph` method.
This is what I initially did ages ago.

Of course as soon as #29886 or something similar gets fixed, I can change back these functions to something neater.

As you are on the forms graph here, let's add the missing case of the symmetric 3x3 forms graph, as
discussed in [BCN] corrections: https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/drg/ch9

```
For $n = 3$ we find a distance-regular graph with intersection array
$"{"q sup 3 -1 , q sup 3 -q , q sup 3 -q sup 2 + 1 ;~ 1,q,q sup 2 -1"}"$
(in the diagram on p. 286, merge the balloons for the forms of rank 3 and
the alternating forms of rank 2).

Having the latter should allow a more economic definition of the Hermitian case, as a product of the symmetric forms graph over GF(r) and alternating forms graph over GF(r).

It's the product, in the sense that vertices are pairs, 2 vertices (a,b) and (c,d) are adjacent iff 
rk(a-c+i(b-d))=1, where i is a generator of GF(q) over GF(r).
(If I'm not mistaken, rk(a-c+i(b-d))=1 may be expressed as "either rk(a-c)+rk(b-d)<2, or
rk(a-c)=rk(b-d)=1, Ker(a-c)=Ker(b-d).)

I think these graphs have the same intersection array of the Brouwer-Pasechnik graph (https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0475).
You definitely know if I'm wrong.

The construction given for that graph is easy and works in O(E), so I chose that one over the symmetric matrices one.
Of course we could have both if you wish.

I'll still try this construction. Could you clarify what you mean by "a generator of GF(q) over GF(r)"?
Do you mean $i \in GF(q)$ s.t. $i$ generated $GF(q) / GF(r)$ as vector spaces over $GF(r)$?

in fact, yes, sure, https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0475 points out to https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/drg/ch9 and discusses the relation between the two. There is something with q being even or odd there, so beware of details.

at the moment `graphs.HermitianFormsGraph(2,9)` is horribly slow. 

E.g. it could in part be due to slowness in computing the below-diagonal part. Taking to `r`-th power is perhaps the worst possible way to compute the map in question. Instead, choose `i` as above, compute `i`<sup>r</sup> (once), then for a,b in GF(r) one has (a+ib)<sup>r</sup>= a+i<sup>r</sup>b.

Another place is rank 1 Hermitian matrices. Each such nxn matrix has form vv<sup>*</sup>, for v in GF(q)<sup>n</sup>,
and * denoting the map induced by taking to r-th power. So no need to compute ranks and filter on rank 1.

There is still quite a lot of redundancy:
`AlternatingFormsGraph(4, 3)` builds 1040 instead of 260 and
`AlternatingFormsGraph(3, 4)` builds 315 instead of 63.

If getting the exact number is too complex, then I won't push further.

One further optimisation would be to take unordered pairs of u,v, both with 1st non-zero coordinates equal to 1, remove duplicates, and then scale the resulting matrices by the non-zero elements of GF(q).
This would cut the duplication by 2, I believe.

I give up on further improving this for the time being (this seems to be a non-trivial maths question). 

I believe for our purposes it is fast enough.

I can avoid computing ranks, but while in `AlternatingFormsGraph` and `HermitianFormsGraph` I was representing a form by the vector of the upper triangular entries, in `BilinearFormsGraph` I need the whole matrix.

I can try using the MatrixSpace without `implementation=meataxe` or "flattening" all matrices to vectors, but we'll lose speed.
