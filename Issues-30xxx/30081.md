I have made use of `weight_function` consistent in all distance method.

Have a look at it. Any suggestion will be helpful.

Tell me, if i have missed something.

P.S- `weight_function` changes in `eccentricity` , `radius`, `diameter` method of `graph.py` and `digraph.py` are done in their respective tickets.
For `digraph.py` in #30039 and for `graph.py` in #29744, #27934
