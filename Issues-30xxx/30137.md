They are currently provided by environment variables passed through by `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install`.

Instead we provide them as `sage_conf` variables.  They are optional - in typical distribution packaging they would not be provided.

This simplifies `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install` and is preparation for #29039/#30036


Depends on #29950
