Remove a few `sage.xyz.all` imports, so that the whole module `xyz.all` doesn't need to be loaded. That's not so important for the normal usage of sage, as there `sage.all` loads these other all imports as well. But this gets more important when part of sage is used as a library, and for the upcoming modularization.

Also two unused imports are removed.
The other changes are cosmetic (from ... import).
