I don't know this, either. But anyway, as the ticket does what it should, I think we should let it pass before the next release, since otherwise #24483 could break some external packages completely, for example SnaPy:

```
sage: import snappy
Plink failed to import tkinter.
doctest:warning
...
DeprecationWarning: the complex_field module is deprecated, please use sage.rings.complex_mpfr
See http://trac.sagemath.org/24483 for details.
doctest:warning
```

Furthermore, the maintainers of SnaPy probably want to implement an adaption, to get rid of that warning. Did somebody inform them, already?

Nathan,

FYI: It seems that once again the import of SnapPy inside Sage is broken with the new beta release (observed while working on #30352):

```
sage: import snappy
Plink failed to import tkinter.
/home/sebastian/devel/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/snappy/snap/shapes.py:4: DeprecationWarning: the complex_field module is deprecated, please use sage.rings.complex_mpfr

  from sage.rings.complex_field import ComplexField
/home/sebastian/devel/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/snappy/verify/verifyCanonical.py:6: DeprecationWarning: the complex_number module is deprecated, please use sage.rings.complex_mpfr

  from .squareExtensions import find_shapes_as_complex_sqrt_lin_combinations

I suspect this to be caused by the upgrade to Python 3.9.1 (#30589).

Thanks for the heads up.  I believe this fixed in the development version of SnapPy, see https://github.com/3-manifolds/SnapPy/issues/22
