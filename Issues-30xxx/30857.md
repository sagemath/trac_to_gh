I don't know this, either. But anyway, as the ticket does what it should, I think we should let it pass before the next release, since otherwise #24483 could break some external packages completely, for example SnaPy:

```
sage: import snappy
Plink failed to import tkinter.
doctest:warning
...
DeprecationWarning: the complex_field module is deprecated, please use sage.rings.complex_mpfr
See http://trac.sagemath.org/24483 for details.
doctest:warning
```

Furthermore, the maintainers of SnaPy probably want to implement an adaption, to get rid of that warning. Did somebody inform them, already?

Nathan,

FYI: It seems that once again the import of SnapPy inside Sage is broken with the new beta release (observed while working on #30352):

```

I suspect this to be caused by the upgrade to Python 3.9.1 (#30589).
