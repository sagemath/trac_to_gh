An interesting property of elliptic cuves over number fields is being a Q-curve (i.e. isogenous to all its Galois conjugates).  I developed an efficient algorithm to test this, detailed in a preprint with Filip Najman (http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10054).  This is implemented here.

I have tested this on around 660,000 elliptic curves over fields of degree 2-6 in the LMFDB.

I'll be writing up the strategy as part of a joint paper with Filip Najman and Samuel Le Fourn.   It is mostly coded already, and run on all the curves in the LMFDB, but since I did that we have proved some results which make both parts simpler -- both easy tests of necessary conditions, which in practice eliminate all non-Q-curves, and rigorous tests of the remaining ones to establish that they are.  The key is not having to make an field extensions -- for example if your curve defined over an S6 sextic field, you definitely do not want to work over the Galois closure.  We don't!",

Note to reviewers:  the main new code is in a new file Qcurves.py, which I added to the reference manual. That consists of one main function `is_Q_curve()` and a couple of helper functions, all documented.  The user interface is via a new method in the class for elliptic curves over number fields.

For correctness, I refer to the preprint above which both establishes the necessary theory and presents the algorithm.  This paper has been refereed by two people and is provisionally accepted by Research in Number Theory (the referees had no issues with the algorithm).  And I have run the code on many hundreds of thousands of curves in the LMFDB -- so there is no point in comparing the output with the LMFDB, as the data there was computed by this code.  There are no other implementations of this that I know of.  Note that it is easy to try something much simpler which is both wrong and also incorrect, namely to base extend to the Galois closure, compute the isogeny class there, and see if all the Galois conjugates to the original (base-changed) curve are in the class.  This is wrong since the definition of Q-curves allows for the isogenies to be defined over Q-bar, and it is also very inefficient (e.g. if the base field as degree 6 and its Galois closure has degree 720).  My main motivation for the paper cited was to develop a more efficient algorithm, and the crucial new point is to see that one can decide the question without any extension of the base field.
