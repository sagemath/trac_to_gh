Fixup from #30153, where recursive invocations of `$(MAKE)` for `SPKG-no-deps` targets were added.

The recursive invocation of $(MAKE) seems to lead to builds with extremely high parallel load when `MAKE="make -j8"` as recommended in Sage build documentation. This may be part of why lately many builds on GH Actions are failing.

This is going to wind up doing the wrong thing in a lot of places but I'm not sure how to fix it. Using the top-level makefile as a convenient way to run high-level commands means that we have two different interpretations of the `-j` argument,

1. How many high-level commands do you want to run at the same time?
2. How many parallel build processes do you want to run when the high-level command being executed is to install a package?

Right now we don't distinguish them. For example, I want to build each spkg with 4 threads, not try to build 4 spkgs at the same time. Maybe a new sage-specific variable like `SAGE_BUILD_JOBS` could be used to pass the right `-j` argument to sub-make while the top-level make would always be invoked with `-j1`. Just an idea.

In any case... can some of these recursive calls be eliminated? E.g. this one...

```
# The 2 preliminary build phases: base and toolchain.                           
base-toolchain: _clean-broken-gcc base
        $(MAKE) toolchain
```

can probably be eliminated by making `_clean-broken-gcc base` a prerequisite for `toolchain`. Then `base-toolchain` can simply depend on both, if it needs to be kept around at all. But we could probably make other stuff depend on `base toolchain` instead of `base-toolchain` afterwards.
