Fixup from #30153, where recursive invocations of `$(MAKE)` for `SPKG-no-deps` targets were added.

The recursive invocation of $(MAKE) seems to lead to builds with extremely high parallel load when `MAKE="make -j8"` as recommended in Sage build documentation. This may be part of why lately many builds on GH Actions are failing.

<a id='comment:9'></a>This is going to wind up doing the wrong thing in a lot of places but I'm not sure how to fix it. Using the top-level makefile as a convenient way to run high-level commands means that we have two different interpretations of the `-j` argument,

Right now we don't distinguish them. For example, I want to build each spkg with 4 threads, not try to build 4 spkgs at the same time.

# The 2 preliminary build phases: base and toolchain.

can probably be eliminated by making `_clean-broken-gcc base` a prerequisite for `toolchain`. Then `base-toolchain` can simply depend on both, if it needs to be kept around at all. But we could probably make other stuff depend on `base toolchain` instead of `base-toolchain` afterwards.
