The problem is that you might have a subcategory `C` of modules whose tensor products are not also an object in `C`. Probably the better way to do this is subclass `TensorProductsCategory` since this is such a common thing. You can either do that here or postpone that to a later ticket.

One doctest to fix:

```
File "src/sage/tensor/modules/tensor_free_module.py", line 128, in sage.tensor.modules.tensor_free_module.TensorFreeModule
Failed example:
    T.category()
Expected:
    Category of tensor products of finite dimensional modules over Integer Ring
Got:
    Category of finite dimensional modules over Integer Ring
```
One done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
