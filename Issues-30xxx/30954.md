This isn't acceptable. Those inequalites are the same, only the defining vector differs by a positive scalar.

We also define a method `is_facet_defining_inequality` that checks whether `self` could replace an inequality of the polyhedron `other`. This is useful, when `other` is not full-dimensional and inequalities aren't unique (only after `affine_hull_projection`).
