This isn't acceptable. Those inequalites are the same, only the defining vector differs by a positive scalar.

We also define a method `is_facet_defining_inequality` that checks whether `self` could replace an inequality of the polyhedron `other`. This is useful, when `other` is not full-dimensional and inequalities aren't unique (only after `affine_hull_projection`).

<a id='comment:4'></a>Minor things:

```diff
-        cross_slack_matrix = self_matrix*hom_Vrep
+        cross_slack_matrix = self_matrix * hom_Vrep
```

```diff
-        if any(self.A()*line.vector() for line in other.lines()):

In the TEST block, I would remove the `QQ(*)` to save some space... (could you also indent/line split?)

Why is there a lonely `::` ?:

```diff

People use it to group examples, when they are too lazy to write down a nice sentence for each example.
