```
The JSmol library -- invoked when using `viewer='jmol'` or `viewer='canvas3d'` from the Jupyter notebook -- is sending an HTTP request to a tracking script at chemapps.stolaf.edu that then uses Google Analytics:

```
GET /jmol/JmolTracker.php?id=UA-45940799-1&applet=Jmol._Canvas2D%20(Jmol)&version=2019-06-08%2000:17:46%20(JSmol/j2s)&appver=14.29.51&url=about%3Asrcdoc HTTP/1.1
Host: chemapps.stolaf.edu
User-Agent: ...
...
Referer: http://localhost:8888/notebooks/.../mynotebook.ipynb
...
```

These requests are not essential to the functioning of JSmol, so in the interest of furthering users' digital privacy, the proposed change prevents such requests from occurring. 

The instruction to disable the tracking request was found at: https://sourceforge.net/p/jmol/mailman/message/31869453/

Keywords: **jmol jsmol tracker tracking telemetry privacy**

The problems with the notebook are not due to this ticket. Starting a new notebook with 9.2.beta4 I get errors that Mathjax cannot be found because the `nbextensions` directory is not being served by the local server. That is a serious issue that would not be caused by turning off Google tracking in JSmol.
