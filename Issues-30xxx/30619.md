Like, which ones? From the name alone, shipping seadata-small seems unnecessary when seadata is present.

>"notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages: [...] cmake [...]"


Gotta wonder how it can miss these. How does one debug that? docker being docker, the state is gone after tox is aborted.

Somehow, cmake is not even listed, tho:

<a id='comment:46'></a>by the way, on tumbleweed I still get a request to install

```
cddlib-tools "pkgconfig(cddlib)" coxeter edge-addition-planarity-suite sympow
```
even though they are installed. 

In fact, `sympow` is buggy - the 1st test from spkg-configure fails.

`cddlib` is not picked up as `cdd.h` is expected in `/usr/include`, but is installed in `/usr/include/cddlib`.

`coxeter` has as upstream an old https://github.com/tscrim/coxeter - and does not install headers, oops...

And `edge-addition-planarity-suite-devel` is missing, and `edge-addition-planarity-suite` does not install headers.

The latter should be fixed.

This is how cddlib 0.94l installs itself.

Surely this is an upstream problem, is it not?
