Sage 9.1 fails to build with cuda 11, as cuda 11 no longer supports the "architecture" compute_30.

Upstream ticket: https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse/issues/56

A fix would be to remove compute_30 from the build commands.

I am not sure what your environment is, but the following is the contents of a small dockerfile to replicate the build failure:

```
FROM nvidia/cuda:11.0-devel-ubuntu20.04

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install --yes build-essential m4 dpkg-dev gettext automake apt-utils git cmake pkg-config python

RUN adduser user < /dev/null

USER user
WORKDIR /home/user/

RUN mkdir Sage && \
    git clone git://git.sagemath.org/sage.git Sage && \
    cd Sage && \
    git checkout 9.1

RUN cd Sage && \
    make -j 4 |& tee build_log.txt || true
```


After the build, the file /home/user/Sage/logs/pkgs/suitesparse-5.6.0.log contains the following, near the end:

```
/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc -I../../AMD/Include -I../../AMD/Source -I../../COLAMD/Include -I/home/user/Sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/suitesparse-5.6.0/src/CCOLAMD/Include -I/home/user/Sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/suitesparse-5.6.0/src/CAMD/Include -I../Include -I../../SuiteSparse_config -I/usr/local/cuda/include/ -Xcompiler -fPIC -O3 -gencode=arch=compute_30,code=sm_30 -gencode=arch=compute_35,code=sm_35 -gencode=arch=compute_50,code=sm_50 -gencode=arch=compute_53,code=sm_53 -gencode=arch=compute_53,code=sm_53 -gencode=arch=compute_60,code=compute_60 -c ../GPU/cholmod_gpu_kernels.cu
nvcc fatal   : Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_30'
```

My GPU happens to support compute_60, but the build statement looks very generic, so I assume it might not even matter that I have a GPU, for the purposes of replicating the build failure.

There was a new commit to upstream pushed to github yesterday, and it seems to have removed references to compute_30 from the build files.

New contents in the file named "ChangeLog" in the commit:

 May 17, 2021, SuiteSparse 5.10.1

* CUDA: remove sm_30 from SuiteSparse_config.mk
* GraphBLAS v5.0.5: minor bug fix
* minor changes to Makefiles


A rebuild of Sage with SuiteSparse version 5.10.1, or with its master branch (which is currently probably the same), would be interesting.

I have cuda 11.2 on Debian Testing (Bullseye) and I can no longer build Sage 9.3 or Sage develop branch from git. I get the error reported here: "nvcc fatal   : Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_30' "

[Johan writes]: "A fix would be to remove compute_30 from the build commands."

How can I temporarily patch Sage develop code to remove compute_30? 

What I want to do is: 

1) pull the latest git source code from develop branch.

2) patch my locally cloned and checked out git develop code, removing compute_30 (I do not need it).

3) ./configure and make to get a working sage again.

No. Not those. Gentoo has historically split suitesparse, and I have somewhat inherited that effort lately. **It is not a winning strategy so far**. Upstream has somewhat inconsistent upkeep of the versioning of the sub-packages and has done source changes without version bump of the sub-package concerned (because of minor mistake in the original release).

The failure on ubuntu trusty is probably because gcc does not default to C99, that can be fixed but do we really want to continue supporting 14.04?

I have had no hand in writing the original cygwin patch. Someone familiar with it should inspect it.
The updated patch is strictly an update on the sage patches I and other wrote over the years.
