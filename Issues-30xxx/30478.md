Sage 9.1 fails to build with cuda 11, as cuda 11 no longer supports the "architecture" compute_30.

Upstream ticket: https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse/issues/56

A fix would be to remove compute_30 from the build commands.

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.**

I am not sure what your environment is, but the following is the contents of a small dockerfile to replicate the build failure:

```
FROM nvidia/cuda:11.0-devel-ubuntu20.04

SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install --yes build-essential m4 dpkg-dev gettext automake apt-utils git cmake pkg-config python

RUN adduser user < /dev/null

USER user
WORKDIR /home/user/

RUN mkdir Sage && \
    git clone git://git.sagemath.org/sage.git Sage && \
    cd Sage && \
    git checkout 9.1

RUN cd Sage && \
    make -j 4 |& tee build_log.txt || true
```


After the build, the file /home/user/Sage/logs/pkgs/suitesparse-5.6.0.log contains the following, near the end:

```
/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc -I../../AMD/Include -I../../AMD/Source -I../../COLAMD/Include -I/home/user/Sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/suitesparse-5.6.0/src/CCOLAMD/Include -I/home/user/Sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/suitesparse-5.6.0/src/CAMD/Include -I../Include -I../../SuiteSparse_config -I/usr/local/cuda/include/ -Xcompiler -fPIC -O3 -gencode=arch=compute_30,code=sm_30 -gencode=arch=compute_35,code=sm_35 -gencode=arch=compute_50,code=sm_50 -gencode=arch=compute_53,code=sm_53 -gencode=arch=compute_53,code=sm_53 -gencode=arch=compute_60,code=compute_60 -c ../GPU/cholmod_gpu_kernels.cu
nvcc fatal   : Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_30'
```

My GPU happens to support compute_60, but the build statement looks very generic, so I assume it might not even matter that I have a GPU, for the purposes of replicating the build failure.

There was a new commit to upstream pushed to github yesterday, and it seems to have removed references to compute_30 from the build files.

New contents in the file named "ChangeLog" in the commit:

 May 17, 2021, SuiteSparse 5.10.1

* CUDA: remove sm_30 from SuiteSparse_config.mk
* GraphBLAS v5.0.5: minor bug fix
* minor changes to Makefiles


A rebuild of Sage with SuiteSparse version 5.10.1, or with its master branch (which is currently probably the same), would be interesting.

I have cuda 11.2 on Debian Testing (Bullseye) and I can no longer build Sage 9.3 or Sage develop branch from git. I get the error reported here: "nvcc fatal   : Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_30' "

[Johan writes]: "A fix would be to remove compute_30 from the build commands."

How can I temporarily patch Sage develop code to remove compute_30? 

What I want to do is: 

1) pull the latest git source code from develop branch.

2) patch my locally cloned and checked out git develop code, removing compute_30 (I do not need it).

3) ./configure and make to get a working sage again.

The failure on ubuntu trusty is probably because gcc does not default to C99, that can be fixed but do we really want to continue supporting 14.04?

I have had no hand in writing the original cygwin patch. Someone familiar with it should inspect it.
The updated patch is strictly an update on the sage patches I and other wrote over the years.
