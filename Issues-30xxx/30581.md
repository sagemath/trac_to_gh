```
Even after #30580, `setup.py` still has an import-time dependency on `Cython` (via `sage_setup`). 

We declare this build system dependency by adding the PEP 517 metadata (`pyproject.toml`).

Adding `pyproject.toml` does not change how the Sage distribution installs sagelib because `build/pkgs/sagelib/spkg-install` uses `setup.py install` directly.

```

Not having `.` in the path is needed for the build isolation. (I'm fine with adding it for the moment and removing it in a follow-up ticket.)
