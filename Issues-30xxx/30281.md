The class `Mutability` used to be a mixin class for mutable objects. However, not every class inheriting from it uses pickling and even then it must be overloaded manually in most cases anyway.

We suggest to remove that method from `Mutability`.

This is exactly the reason why we remove `__reduce__` from `Mutability`. But even then, pickling is tested (see #30280).
