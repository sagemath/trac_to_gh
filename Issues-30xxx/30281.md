The class `Mutability` used to be a mixin class for mutable objects. However, not every class inheriting from it uses pickling and even then it must be overloaded manually in most cases anyway.

We suggest to remove that method from `Mutability`.

Yes. When there is a `__reduce__` method, then it is tested. 
The correct fix is to implement pickling for your class in #30261.

This is exactly the reason why we remove `__reduce__` from `Mutability`. But even then, pickling is tested (see #30280).

This `__reduce__` method is bad because it it tries to unpickle anything as a `Mutability` object. So a Python class that inherits from this must then contend with this, which puts more of burden on the implementer.
