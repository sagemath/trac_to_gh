The proposed full migration to GitHub Issues in one shot makes the following tasks unnecessary:
- #30406: Make it possible to contribute to Trac via GitHub Pull Requests 
- #33818 Ticket badges on Trac show "failing" when actually in progress
- #34524 Pip package `git_trac_command`
- #33687 Document developer workflow with GitLab Merge Requests
- #33683 Developer manual: Document setting up the trac remote within VS Code (instead of command line)
- #33406/#25980 other tasks regarding the broken/abandoned GitLab CI

- #28936 Meta-ticket: Adopt mainstream Python testing/linting infrastructure: tox, pytest, ..., describe in Developer's Guide
- #31164 Meta-ticket: Add external user packages as optional/experimental packages
- #34526 Move "mathematical software landscape" from Trac wiki to manual

There once was a bot called sageb0t that would transform
any pull request opened on the SageMath repo at GitHub
to a ticket on the Sage Trac server. The bot was lost.

There is now a mechanism that will transform any merge request
opened against the SageMath repo at GitLab into a ticket
on the Sage Trac server. Read more about this mechanism:

Thanks for these links.

I would argue that a simple bot that converts github pull requests and issues to trac is not enough in the long term. It might ease the transition period, but also duplicates the infrastructure. Moreover, you don't get to enjoy the above mentioned benefits if pull requests are still reviewed here on trac etc.

Are there any issues that prevent a clear one-time migration of the current issues and code contributions to github, say using tools like https://github.com/trustmaster/trac2github.

> -1 we have already put a significant amount of work into migration to [GitLab](../wiki/GitLab) which doesn't take money from the US government to imprison migrant children: https://gitlab.com/sagemath

Let's not get bogged down in political discussions here -  we're paying about US$4000 to Google for trac hosting, and Google is not an angel, either. Even if we create our own exclusively solar panel and wind power generator operating hosting site for trac, we still will be reliant on various arguably evil parties to be operational.

Besides, GitLab's free tier (and not only) is lacking in functionality compared to GitHub, and https://gitlab.com/sagemath
is semi-broken, in part due to this, in part due to lack of attention.

If many Sage developers have write access to the repo, it is possible to have feature branches all in the main Sage repo (which we [may need to do](https://github.com/sagemath/trac-to-github/issues/5) regardless as part of the transition).  But there is the issue of clutter to keep in mind.
