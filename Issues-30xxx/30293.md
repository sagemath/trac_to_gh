```
The method `lawrence_extension` of Polyhedron does not work when the point at which we do the `lawrence_extension` has a different `base_ring` than the Polyhedron:

```
sage: polytopes.cube().lawrence_extension([5/2,0,0])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

The bug was introduced in #27926.

We fix this and add a method `_test_lawrence` to systematically test the lawrence construction.

```diff
-parent = self.parent().change_ring(self.base_ring(), ambient_dim = self.ambient_dim() +  1)
+parent = self.parent().base_extend(v, ambient_dim=self.ambient_dim() +  1)
```
I think this should to the job.

And this ticket shows again that we should test more methods.
