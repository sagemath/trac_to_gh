Just loading `src/setup.py` already pulls in Cython, `numpy`, and `pkgconfig` via `sage_setup`, so these distributions would have to be declared as `[build_system] requires` in `src/pyproject.toml` (ex `setup_requires`)

By moving some computations from import-time to runtime, we get rid of this early dependency on `pkgconfig`, `numpy`.  (They are, of course, still required for building the package.)  

This makes `setup.py sdist` work using a Python that does not have `numpy `or `pkgconfig` installed.  To test (with a system python that has `Cython`):

```
  $ (cd build/pkgs/sagelib/src && python3 -u setup.py --no-user-cfg sdist)
```

(We also reduce the load-time dependency on Cython; however, we do not address the whole load-time dependency of `setup.py` on `Cython` (via `sage_setup.find`, which uses `open_source_file` and `is_package_dir`) in this ticket. This is best done after #28925.)

This is from `src/sage_setup/command/sage_build_cython.py`:
{{{
# Work around GCC-4.8 bug which miscompiles some sig_on() statements:
# * http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14460
# * http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/20226
# * http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56982
if subprocess.call("""$CC --version | grep -i 'gcc.* 4[.]8' >/dev/null """, shell=True) == 0:
    extra_compile_args.append('-fno-tree-copyrename')
}}}
This gives an (ignored) error when `CC` is not set -- this defect is not new in this ticket.
