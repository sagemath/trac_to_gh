oops. This is due to 

```
sage: (2*x).CoefficientsOfUnivariateRationalFunction()                                                                
[ [ 2 ], [ 1 ], 1 ]
```
where 3rd `1` is valuation v, so that the function is x<sup>v</sup>(2/1)=2x.
But the corresponding code added in #21020

```python
if self.IsUnivariatePolynomial():
    from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring_constructor import PolynomialRing
    R = PolynomialRing(base_ring, var)
    return R(num)
```
forgets about the case of valuation>0.

<a id='comment:4'></a>could you write this `x = libgap.eval('Indeterminate(Integers, "x")')` (and the other place there where `x` is set) as

```
sage: x = libgap.Integers.Indeterminate('x')
```
This is less ugly.
