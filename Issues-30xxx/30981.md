Implents annular Khovanov homology for braids.

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(2)
sage: b = B([1,1,1])
sage: b.annular_khovanov_homology()
{(9, 0): {3: Z},
 (7, 0): {2: 0, 3: C2},
 (1, -2): {0: Z},
 (3, 0): {0: Z, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0},
 (5, 0): {1: Z, 2: Z, 3: 0},
 (5, 2): {0: Z}}
sage: annular_khovanov_homology(poincare_polynomial=True)
a^2*q^5 + q^9*t^3 + q^5*t^2 + q^5*t + q^3 + a^-2*q
```

It is computed very similarly as the implementation of Khovanov homology for links.

<a id='comment:2'></a>This is my first contribution.

I added the ability to output the poincareé polynomial of the homology since the dictionary is often quite hard to read and it makes for a more compact output. However I'm not sure if this is the ideal place to implement it, maybe some more general solution for homologies would be better...

I'm also not sure where to put the additional needed imports for the needed modules. Should they be put at the front of the file or into each function, I've seen both in this file.

I've used `IntegerRing()` since this was used everywhere else in `braids.py`. (i.e. in `burau_matrix()`, `alexenader_polynomial()` etc.)

I thought using ZZ just for this method would be a bit inconsistent.

The output of dictionaries when run in Sage's doctests are sorted (by the keys IIRC), precisely to ensure consistency in the doctests. So when running something with things like a `dict`,  I just use `sage -t` and copy that output.

Although for this case, since you have `dict` of `dict`, you will likely have to manually convert it to the list of items and sort the items.

Also, typo `mad` -> `made`:

```
A tuple with the type of smoothing mad at each crossing.
```

```diff
-        """r
+        r"""
         Return the annular Khovanov homology of a closure of a braid.
 
         INPUT:
 
-        - ``qagrad`` -- tuple of quantum and annular grading for which to
-          compute the homology. If this is ``None`` (default), then
-          compute for all gradings.
+        - ``qagrad`` -- (optional) tuple of quantum and annular grading
+          for which to compute the homology
 
-        - ``ring`` -- (default: ``ZZ``) the coefficient ring.
+        - ``ring`` -- (default: ``ZZ``) the coefficient ring
 
         OUTPUT:
 
         If ``qagrad`` is ``None``, return a dictionary of homogies in all
         gradings indexed by grading. If qagrad is specified, return homology
         of that grading.
 
         .. NOTE::
+
             This is a simple wrapper around :meth:`annular_khovanov_complex`
             to compute homology from it.
