While working on #30371, I noticed that `cblas` is not available for Ubuntu 18.04. In fact, `libblas-dev` contains a `README.if-you-look-for-libcblas` with the following content:

```
    Debian science team maintainers have merged the CBLAS ABI into
    the libblas.so shared object. Everything you need from libcblas.so
    can be found in libblas.so . Please link your program against it
    instead. See also

      https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2019/10/msg00273.html
      https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=943712
      https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience/LinearAlgebraLibraries
```

So this ticket adds support for other BLAS libraries (openplas, blas) that the user may have installed.

As I said in #30371, I think it's best to keep the focus narrow -- make #30371 work completely (i.e., pass doctests) when run from within `./sage -sh` so that `$SAGE_LOCAL` is set to a working installation of the Sage distribution.  

Of course I do understand that currently technical problems prevent you from completing the build.

Still, `make -k` can build everything until you get the error with the pip package or whatever is failing. Then for example the .pc files will be available.

> Would it work to take in `env.py` the first of the libraries `openblas cblas blas` that is found using `pkgconfig.parse`?


Something like this might work.

Making `sage.env.cython_aliases` more flexible is a good approach, I would think.

Note that this will need thorough testing across the supported platforms.

```
see https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/runs/1285891725?check_suite_focus=true
Its interesting to note that also `./configure` cannot find openblas:
`checking for openblas >= 0.2.20... no`. So I guess it's a more general issue not really related to this ticket.
