While working on #30371, I noticed that `cblas` is not available for Ubuntu 18.04. In fact, `libblas-dev` contains a `README.if-you-look-for-libcblas` with the following content:

```
    Debian science team maintainers have merged the CBLAS ABI into
    the libblas.so shared object. Everything you need from libcblas.so
    can be found in libblas.so . Please link your program against it
    instead. See also

      https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2019/10/msg00273.html
      https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=943712
      https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience/LinearAlgebraLibraries
```

So this ticket adds support for other BLAS libraries (openplas, blas) that the user may have installed.

Replying to [gh-tobiasdiez](#comment%3A7):
> Well, the editable install in #30371 uses only system-wide installed libraries, so things in `SAGE_LOCAL` don't matter


As I said in #30371, I think it's best to keep the focus narrow -- make #30371 work completely (i.e., pass doctests) when run from within `./sage -sh` so that `$SAGE_LOCAL` is set to a working installation of the Sage distribution.  

Of course I do understand that currently technical problems prevent you from completing the build.

Still, `make -k` can build everything until you get the error with the pip package or whatever is failing. Then for example the .pc files will be available.

> Would it work to take in `env.py` the first of the libraries `openblas cblas blas` that is found using `pkgconfig.parse`?


Something like this might work.

Making `sage.env.cython_aliases` more flexible is a good approach, I would think.

Note that this will need thorough testing across the supported platforms.

Its interesting to note that also `./configure` cannot find openblas:
`checking for openblas >= 0.2.20... no`. So I guess it's a more general issue not really related to this ticket.

I just discovered that there is also a reference to `cblas` in `src/sage/misc/cython.py`. Not sure if this also needs to be changed to use the new variable `CBLAS_PC_MODULES`.

Moreover, I would like suggest the following change to `sage_conf.py.in` to make this more reusable.

```
DEFAULT_CBLAS_PC_MODULE = "@SAGE_CBLAS_PC_MODULE" # Set to cblas in configure

def get_cblas_pc_module()
   cblas_pc_modules = [DEFAULT_CBLAS_PC_MODULE, 'cblas', 'openblas', 'blas']
   return next((blas_lib for blas_lib in cblas_pc_modules if pkgconfig.exists(blas_lib)))
```
