Just go through the different values and get the output explicitly (and maybe check the `len`). This will be more robust and actually catch errors.

Your error messages in `display` don't need to be so excited (just remove the `!` from the end).

While it is good to keep encapsulation, just be aware that changes like this:

```diff
-                    rk = vb._rank
+                    rk = vb.rank()
```
mean extra Python function calls, which are relatively expensive compared to attribute lookup. However, I have no objections to these changes as they seem like they would not have any significant impact on computation times.
