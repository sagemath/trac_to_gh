Currently

```
            sage: K = Qp(5)
            sage: E = EllipticCurve([K(0), K(1)])
            sage: E.lift_x(1, extend=True)
```
fails as the `extension` method for p-adic fields takes prec as a second argument, so add the argument name `names` explicitly.

Keywords: padics, elliptic curves
