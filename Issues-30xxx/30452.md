(from #30410)

This is so that all of the tox environments (#30410, #30408) can be run on files and directories.

Example:

```
$ ./sage -startuptime src/sage/tensor/ src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py
```

It's certainly true that `./sage --startuptime src/sage/homology/simplicial_set.py` raises an error without this branch and doesn't raise an error with it, but with this branch it produces no output. What is it supposed to do?

By the way, it makes me a little uncomfortable to use the same loop variable twice like this:

```
for module_arg in cmdline_args:
    ...
    for module_arg in matching_modules:
        ...
```

On the other hand, `./sage -startuptime src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` does produce output. I'm confused.

Before working on this ticket, I had never used these scripts. I don't really know whether the above is expected, or a result of undetected bitrot over the years.

I think that it only works for modules that are loaded when `sage.all` is loaded.
