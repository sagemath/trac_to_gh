Python 2 had `range` (returning lists) and `xrange` (returning iterators).

Python 3 only has `range` which behaves like the old `xrange`.

This ticket is to rename or change our range-like functions accordingly.

To go further we could make sure they all follow similar semantics, i.e.:
- `f(a)` for the range from `0` included to `a` excluded
- `f(a, b)` for the range from `a` included to `b` excluded
- `f(a, b, c)` for the range from `a` included to `b` excluded, by steps of `c`


Functions in the global name space:
- `ellipsis_range`
- `fibonacci_xrange`
- `mrange`
- `mrange_iter`
- `prime_range`
- `randrange`
- `range`
- `srange`
- `sxrange`
- `xmrange`
- `xmrange_iter`
- `xsrange`

- #24543: py3: need to fix sequence of ranges
- #18298: `prime_range` vs `primes`
- #17373: Add more examples for when `srange` is better than `range`

<a id='comment:15'></a>According to the [Python 3 documentation for range](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range):

> Rather than being a
> function, [range](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range)
> is actually an immutable sequence type, as documented
> in [Ranges](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range)
> and [Sequence Types — list, tuple, range](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq).


Could we make `srange` an immutable sequence type too?

+Python 2 had \`range\` (returning lists) and \`xrange\` (returning iterators).
 
+Python 3 only has \`range\` which behaves like the old \`xrange\`.
+
+This ticket is to rename or change our range-like functions accordingly.
+
+To go further we could make sure they all follow similar semantics, i.e.:
+- \`f(a)\` for the range from \`0\` included to \`a\` excluded
+- \`f(a, b)\` for the range from \`a\` included to \`b\` excluded

I posted something on #34337 about somet hings to be careful about with doing the replacement.
