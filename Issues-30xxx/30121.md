Python 2 had `range` (returning lists) and `xrange` (returning iterators).

Python 3 only has `range` which behaves like the old `xrange`.

This ticket is to rename or change our range-like functions accordingly.

To go further we could make sure they all follow similar semantics, i.e.:
- `f(a)` for the range from `0` included to `a` excluded
- `f(a, b)` for the range from `a` included to `b` excluded
- `f(a, b, c)` for the range from `a` included to `b` excluded, by steps of `c`


Functions in the global name space:
- `ellipsis_range`
- `fibonacci_xrange`
- `mrange`
- `mrange_iter`
- `prime_range`
- `randrange`
- `range`
- `srange`
- `sxrange`
- `xmrange`
- `xmrange_iter`
- `xsrange`
