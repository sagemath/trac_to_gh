The main purpose of this ticket is a discussion and coordination platform regarding general code improvements of the preexisting SageManifolds code apart from bugfixes and new features. That is, for instance, the removal of existing code duplication, and strategies to improve readability, debugging and compatibility.

I for myself do not have much experience in this field. However, I am eager to improve this nice piece of package as much as I can, so that anyone can benefit from it. In any case, this is not a one man task and I appreciate any support in this matter.

I am looking forward to the discussion! :)

Let me preface my comments: I have only very recently started to look into sage-manifolds and my understanding of this code is very shallow.

If you are concerned about removing doctests (rather than documentation) as a byproduct of removing code duplications:  There is a solution by moving many tests from doctests to `_test...` methods. These are inherited by subclasses and therefore test coverage can be improved.

I did this in the `sage.numerical.backends` modules in #20323 and follow-up tickets, and recently `gh-kliem` started to do the same in `sage.geometry.polyhedra` (see for example #29918).

In `sage.numerical.backends.logging_backend` I have some code that assists with transforming doctests to `_test...` methods, which could be generalized easily.

My concern, however, is also the documentation itself. Tensor fields and sections are declared slighly differently. For example, sections are constructed by using an instance of the vector bundle. Tensor fields, on the other hand, are declared by using an instance of the manifold. Therefore, it would be good to have separate closed minimal examples and hence distinct documentations.\n\nWhat about something like this:\n\n```python\n\nclass MyClass(ParentClass)\n    r\"\"\"\n    Blabla\n    \"\"\"\n\n    my_method(self, a, b, c='c'):\n        r\"\"\"\n        Overwritten docstring\n        \"\"\"\n        return ParentClass.my_method(self, a, b, c=c)\n```\n\nOr is that too nasty?",

        return ParentClass.my_method(self, a, b, c=c)
```

Or is that too nasty?

In addition to such speedups, it would be good to be able to use different backends for storing tensors instead of the current dictionary backend. 

On the one hand, for special cases such as vectors and matrices by existing special implementations; for the special case of fully symmetric tensors, using fast implementations of multivariate polynomials. 

On the other hand, for general numerical tensors using mainstream accelerated frameworks like PyTorch (see #30096).

Welcome to the project!
There are various ways to contribute, see 
https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/contrib.html. 

If you take a look at the metaticket #18528, you'll see that various tickets are in stalled state (mostly the blue ones), are therefore are open for development. For instance, #18786 about complex structures. You could pick one of those or create a brand new ticket about a topic that you like.

This is code duplication and should be avoided IMHO, cf. [comment:6](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29234#comment:6) in #29234 for the case of sections vs. tensor fields.

I guess Nicolas means that if the user would like to take a look at the source code via `t.my_method??`, he/she would get `return ParentClass.my_method(self, a, b, c=c)`, i.e.

Indeed, it would be nice to (co)homology of manifolds. There are two approaches I see right now:

- Morse homology
- Čech cohomology
**
Čech cohomology** sounds promising since it can (more or less) directly be obtained from charts and their transition maps (see e.g. https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~caval101/homepage/Differential_geometry_2014_files/notes%20on%20Cech%20cohomology.pdf).

As for **Morse homology** I'd like to refer to https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723086905000642. With the orientation implementation we already have, this could be doable, even though there are some immediate problems that I can think of:

- How can we obtain all critial points? How do we determine their indices?

Is there perhaps a nice class of Morse functions we can easily deal with?

For that, we need "good covers" consisting of contractible sets, and all its intersections being contractible. Thus we need a way to check contractibility for open subsets. Is that worth a post in sage-devel?

The manifolds code is growing steadily and more files are added. Do you think it is time that we consider refactoring the folder structure of the manifolds module?

Some of the things added as part of #31740 (Meta-ticket: Families, posets, complexes of manifold subsets) could certainly be moved into a subpackage `sage.manifolds.subsets`:
- from #31653: `sage.manifolds.continuous_map_image` -> `sage.manifolds.subsets.continuous_map_image`
- likewise #31644, #31688
