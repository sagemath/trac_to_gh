The main purpose of this ticket is a discussion and coordination platform regarding general code improvements of the preexisting SageManifolds code apart from bugfixes and new features. That is, for instance, the removal of existing code duplication, and strategies to improve readability, debugging and compatibility.

I for myself do not have much experience in this field. However, I am eager to improve this nice piece of package as much as I can, so that anyone can benefit from it. In any case, this is not a one man task and I appreciate any support in this matter.

I am looking forward to the discussion! :)

**Tasks:**

I had to copy the very same lines over and over again. It was a tedious task not only to modify the code but also to understand how it was built up.

If you are concerned about removing doctests (rather than documentation) as a byproduct of removing code duplications:  There is a solution by moving many tests from doctests to `_test...` methods. These are inherited by subclasses and therefore test coverage can be improved.

I did this in the `sage.numerical.backends` modules in #20323 and follow-up tickets, and recently `gh-kliem` started to do the same in `sage.geometry.polyhedra` (see for example #29918).

In `sage.numerical.backends.logging_backend` I have some code that assists with transforming doctests to `_test...` methods, which could be generalized easily.

My concern, however, is also the documentation itself. Tensor fields and sections are declared slighly differently. For example, sections are constructed by using an instance of the vector bundle.

Welcome to the project!
There are various ways to contribute, see 
https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/contrib.html. 

If you take a look at the metaticket #18528, you'll see that various tickets are in stalled state (mostly the blue ones), are therefore are open for development. For instance, #18786 about complex structures. You could pick one of those or create a brand new ticket about a topic that you like.

That is, for instance, the removal of existing code duplication, and strategies to improve readability, debugging and compatibility.

This is code duplication and should be avoided IMHO, cf. [comment:6](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29234#comment:6) in #29234 for the case of sections vs. tensor fields.

I guess Nicolas means that if the user would like to take a look at the source code via `t.my_method??`, he/she would get `return ParentClass.my_method(self, a, b, c=c)`, i.e.

<a id='comment:30'></a>I would probably start with Čech cohomology since it is more straightforward.

For finding the critical points in Morse homology, I think you can compute them on each chart individually since they are suppose to be isolated IIRC and then remove redundancies. From there, you can check the degeneracy condition.

Thus we need a way to check contractibility for open subsets. Is that worth a post in sage-devel?",

For that, we need "good covers" consisting of contractible sets, and all its intersections being contractible. Thus we need a way to check contractibility for open subsets. Is that worth a post in sage-devel?

Some of the things added as part of #31740 (Meta-ticket: Families, posets, complexes of manifold subsets) could certainly be moved into a subpackage `sage.manifolds.subsets`:
- from #31653: `sage.manifolds.continuous_map_image` -> `sage.manifolds.subsets.continuous_map_image`
- likewise #31644, #31688
