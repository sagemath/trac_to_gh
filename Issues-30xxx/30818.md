```
Instead of relying on running in an environment set up by `sage-env`, we should set up specific environment variables whenever we invoke executables. This will be configurable through `sage_conf`.

This is so that Sage is fully functional even when not being run from within `sage-env`.  This continues what was done in #29038/#30563 for Maxima.

As this ticket removes some hard-coded paths depending on `SAGE_LOCAL` from sagelib, it will reduce the need for patching for downstream packaging.

A possible implementation strategy goes through `sage.features.Executable`.

This is part of:
- #21707 Meta-ticket: Split `sage-env` into 5 to clean up sage configuration

Taken care of in separate tickets:
- #32036 `sage.env`: Remove fallback of `SAGE_LOCAL` to `SAGE_VENV`, remove direct uses of `SAGE_LOCAL` from the Sage library
- #31296 `sage.features.Executable`: Prepend `$SAGE_VENV/bin:$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` to `PATH`, remove dependency on `distutils`
- #31275 qepcad
- #29024/#33440 singular
- #30887 4ti2
- #33465 `sage.graphs`: Use `Executable.absolute_filename()`
- #33466 `lrs`
- #32645 `cddlib`
- #33467 `palp`
- #33468 `gfan`
- #33405 Eliminate direct use of `os.getenv` in `sage.interfaces`
- #29644 gap
- environment for C compiler use at runtime (includes `ARCHFLAGS` - see #31227)
- #31041 environment for `sage.misc.cython`
