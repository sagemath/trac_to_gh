```
Provide the option to run `make test` and friends
(`make [p]test[all][long]`) in quiet mode.

Or to set a level of verbosity.

Currently `make testlong` outputs two lines
for each file tested, such as

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 75.4 --random-seed=0 src/sage/all_cmdline.py
    [0 tests, 0.00 s]
```

Below some options that could be offered.

- One line per tested folder:

```
src/sage
src/sage/misc
src/sage/schemes
src/sage/schemes/cyclic_covers
src/sage/schemes/berkovich
src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves
src/sage/schemes/plane_quartics
...
src/sage/crypto
src/sage/crypto/public_key
...
src/sage/data_structures
src/sage/databases
src/sage/parallel
...
```

- One line per folder, limiting depth:

```
src/sage
src/sage/misc
src/sage/schemes
src/sage/crypto
src/sage/data_structures
src/sage/databases
src/sage/parallel
...
```

- Progress bar using tqdm or similar,
  based e.g. on total number of files to test.

What's happening here is that, in contrast to other make targets for installing packages, `make test` does not go through `sage-logger`, so `make V=0 test` does not redirect the output to the log only.
