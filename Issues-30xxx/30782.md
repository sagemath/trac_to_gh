Note: this is on FreeBSD with external ppl-1.2 / pplpy-0.8.4.

I have not found other report of this; is it specific to FreeBSD?

ought to be reported on https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy - but indeed, clang 11 is sort of rare. Perhaps this problem was fixed in the ongoing work on sage 9.2, where one has to deal with clang 12 from Apple (but it's Apple, so all bets are off)
