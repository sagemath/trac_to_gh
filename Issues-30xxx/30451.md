<div id="comment:0"></div>

In Sage 9.1, the section "Geometry and Topology"
of the index page for the pdf reference manual at

- https://doc.sagemath.org/pdf/en/reference/

starts with "Euclidean Spaces and Vector Calculus"
where the link is broken and appears as

```
:doc:`Euclidean Spaces and Vector Calculus`
```

This ticket is to fix that.

Indeed. How does one get to that page in the first place? From https://www.sagemath.org/, clicking either on "Documentation" or on "Help->Online Documentation" in the top menu leads to https://doc.sagemath.org/, the PDF section of which seems OK (except for `reference.pdf` which is a mere TOC without any actual content).

This page is now fixed (among other things) by #29993, now merged to Sage 9.2.beta11.

Replying to [@egourgoulhon](#comment%3A3):
> How does one get to that page in the first place? 

After you built Sage 9.2.beta11,

1. Build html and pdf documetation `sage --docbuild all html` and `sage --docbuild all pdf`
2. Then open the reference manual.
3. Then click the Sage icon at the upper left corner.
4. Then click the (missing) pdf icon next to the Reference link.

To recover the missing pdf icon for you, run `sage --docbuild website html` and reload the reference manual.

If you know how to fix the missing pdf icon issue, visit #30418.
