In what Sage considers to be the primal SDP, 
we have the constraint

    \sum x_j A_j  \succeq C

where the left hand side is considered as an element of the tensor product of the n x n matrix space with the space of linear functionals, implemented in `LinearTensorParent`. In de Klerk-Vallentin, this linear operator is denoted by A*.

To express its adjoint, the linear operator A, we will need the space of linear functionals on the n x n matrix space.  Then A will be an element of the tensor product of `R^m` with with that space of linear functionals, for which we again can use `LinearTensorParent`.
