It seems there is a bug or a lack of documentation about how to use `Automaton.language()`.

For example:

```
>>> for w in (automata.Word([0])*automata.Word([0]).language():
>>>     print(w)
# Does not print anything
>>> for w in (automata.Word([0]).kleene_star()).language():
>>>     print(w)
[]
[0]
```

But when the automaton is determinized `Automaton.language()` works.



Component: **combinatorics**
