Currently, elements of a `FiniteRankFreeModule` and its tensor modules are mutable and therefore cannot be hashed.

In analogy to `sage.modules.FreeModuleElement` and `sage.matrix.Matrix`, a method `set_immutable()` should be added.

In this ticket, we do this by creating a subclass `ModuleElementWithMutability` of `ModuleElement`.  The existing classes `Vector` (and thus `FreeModuleElement` from `sage.modules`) and `FreeModuleTensor` (from `sage.tensor`) are changed to subclass it.

The methods from `FreeModuleElement` implementing mutability are moved to `ModuleElementWithMutability` and become available for `FreeModuleTensor` in this way. (The class `Vector` also gets them for free.)

Thank you for this very nice improvement!

What about the name of an immutable element? Should that be immutable, too? This is not covered in this modification, but maybe it should?

As you suggested a systematic solution to #30239, it would be good to add this improvement to all modules in the `manifolds` module and to the scalar field algebra as well. The latter probably needs a new implementation, e.g. `CommutativeAlgebraElementWithMutability`.

What about a slighly more general approach like having a class `ElementWithMutability` and then simply

```python
class FreeModuleTensor(ModuleElement, ElementWithMutability) 
```

This approach can also be applied to other elements. The hashablility can then be implemented via `ElementWithMutability`.

This has also the great advantage that this can be used for affine connections and bundle connections, too.

Reasonable point. Mh, that would mean, we need a seperate solution for scalar fields and connections, right?

Do you have an opinion regarding the behavior of the tensor's names? I think that the names should be fixed as soon as the element is immutable.

Part of me would want it to be mutable because I want to rename things, but the other part says that 0 should not be renamed. I would say because of that, (latex) names should be immutable.

I feel I don't really have a qualified opinion on this because I have not studied how you use these symbolic names in sage-manifolds. 

The vectors from `sage.modules` do not support renaming, so there's no concern regarding compatibility here.

```
sage: v = vector(QQ, [2, 3, 4])
sage: v.rename('mangrove')
NotImplementedError: object does not support renaming: (2, 3, 4)
```

Neither do elements of `CombinatorialFreeModule`.

> Would you mind to add this condition here?

I would prefer it if this could be done on follow-up tickets to keep this technical ticket small.

There are some more changes that you could consider: `vector` supports an optional argument `immutable`; and hashing of immutable tensors should be implemented.

> Anyway, I would use your code as a template to apply the mutability changes to the `manifolds` module accordingly; also to fix #30239 "more systematically", as you said.

Great!

Actually this is not quite true. One cannot do general mix-in classes with Cython.
But the following works:

```

This works because between none of the intermediate classes between `ModuleElement` and `CommutativeAlgebraElement` add slots.

Yes, I think this is a defect.

Yes. But actually - should an `AffineConnection` not be an element of some module too?

Don't worry about this. It would be highly controversial to add additional slots to these classes.

Actually, on the second thought, I don't think that connections constitute a vector space. There is no zero element since this would contradict the Leibniz rule. Furthermore, in fact, only convex linear combinations are connections again.

I wonder why `Mutability` does not inherit from `SageObject`. If it would, one could let connections directly inherit from `Mutability`. Is there a particular reason?

Hard to know. It was added in #14524. I don't know if it was ever used

The invokation of `__init__` via `super()` here seems to cause some troubles on the level of manifolds. Anyway, I think the discussion can be closed and should be shifted to #30261. I will add the dependence.
