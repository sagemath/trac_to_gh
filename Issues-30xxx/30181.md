Currently, elements of a `FiniteRankFreeModule` and its tensor modules are mutable and therefore cannot be hashed.

In analogy to `sage.modules.FreeModuleElement` and `sage.matrix.Matrix`, a method `set_immutable()` should be added.

In this ticket, we do this by creating a subclass `ModuleElementWithMutability` of `ModuleElement`.  The existing classes `Vector` (and thus `FreeModuleElement` from `sage.modules`) and `FreeModuleTensor` (from `sage.tensor`) are changed to subclass it.

The methods from `FreeModuleElement` implementing mutability are moved to `ModuleElementWithMutability` and become available for `FreeModuleTensor` in this way. (The class `Vector` also gets them for free.)

Reasonable point. Mh, that would mean, we need a seperate solution for scalar fields and connections, right?

Do you have an opinion regarding the behavior of the tensor's names? I think that the names should be fixed as soon as the element is immutable.

Possibly, but it might suggest that you just need a better mixin class that is perhaps (a subclass of) `sage.structure.mutability`. I am not sure as you know the code better than I do. You can try experimenting and seeing what works best.

> Do you have an opinion regarding the behavior of the tensor's names? I think that the names should be fixed as soon as the element is immutable.


Part of me would want it to be mutable because I want to rename things, but the other part says that 0 should not be renamed. I would say because of that, (latex) names should be immutable.

This is exactly the reason why I struggle, too.

However, I think, the names should be set fixed when the element is immutable. At least, immutability means exactly this.

Anyway, I would use your code as a template to apply the mutability changes to the `manifolds` module accordingly; also to fix #30239 "more systematically", as you said.

I feel I don't really have a qualified opinion on this because I have not studied how you use these symbolic names in sage-manifolds. 

The vectors from `sage.modules` do not support renaming, so there's no concern regarding compatibility here.

```
sage: v = vector(QQ, [2, 3, 4])
sage: v.rename('mangrove')
NotImplementedError: object does not support renaming: (2, 3, 4)
```

Neither do elements of `CombinatorialFreeModule`.

> Would you mind to add this condition here?


I would prefer it if this could be done on follow-up tickets to keep this technical ticket small.

There are some more changes that you could consider: `vector` supports an optional argument `immutable`; and hashing of immutable tensors should be implemented.

> Anyway, I would use your code as a template to apply the mutability changes to the `manifolds` module accordingly; also to fix #30239 "more systematically", as you said.


Great!

Actually this is not quite true. One cannot do general mix-in classes with Cython.
But the following works:

```

```

This works because between none of the intermediate classes between `ModuleElement` and `CommutativeAlgebraElement` add slots.

```

I think I wouldn't like to push the mutability down to the level of `Element`. Mutating components is something that we traditionally do with "vectors". Other types of elements are traditionally immutable, and a functional style (creating new objects instead of mutating objects) is preferred.

That's right. More importantly, connections already support hashing even though they cannot be considered immutable. Strictly speaking, this is a defect.

Actually, on the second thought, I don't think that connections constitute a vector space. There is no zero element since this would contradict the Leibniz rule. Furthermore, in fact, only convex linear combinations are connections again.

I wonder why `Mutability` does not inherit from `SageObject`. If it would, one could let connections directly inherit from `Mutability`. Is there a particular reason?
