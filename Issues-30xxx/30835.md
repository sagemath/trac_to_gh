We add 
- a `tox` configuration factor for using `llvm`
- a script package (without spkg-install) representing system package `llvm` (https://repology.org/project/llvm/versions)

Examples:
- `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard-llvm` 
- `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard-usrlocal-llvm` (use at your own risk - updates the global homebrew installation)
- `tox -e docker-fedora-34-standard-llvm`

Portability issues (solving them should not be a prerequisite for the present ticket):
- `pynac` - https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/N03gtymVUnA/m/9WpvHZZRAAAJ
- `linbox` - https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/4ZH2MwIY0js/m/bnax1dsvAAAJ

When it works on at least a few platforms, we will want to create GH Actions workflows that build Sage with llvm on various platforms for each release tag.

that's probably too much trouble. There is  a distinction w.r.t. which standard C++ library clang uses, GNU's (libstdc++) or LLVM's (libc++), which is more important.

flang is still not quite ready for prime time
(I managed to build Sage using flang/clang, but it was not stable)

gfortran is good.

(after all, everything else builds, and these `TARGET_OS_...` are used in the SDK's `stdio.h` and `stdlib.h`)
