At the current stage, the Pfaffian is computed using the definition by perfect matchings. This is tremendously demanding.

According to https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04247, there is an algorithm similar to the Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm for the determinant running in at most O(pow(n,4)). Furthermore, it is easy to implement. This algorithm works for any torsion-free ring.

What do you need info on? The determinant version? I think that would be better as a separate ticket.

I don't see the point in nailing `IntegralDomains()` in memory here. This function should not be called with the kind of frequency that would mandate that.

When the result is not a field, how does other such algorithms work in Sage? Do they convert the result back to the original ring? I feel like if I use a matrix over `ZZ`, I would expect a result in `ZZ`.

I would fully Cythonize `_pf_bfl` and write it as

```python
    cdef _pf_bfl(self):
        cdef Py_ssize_t n = self._ncols
        cdef Py_ssize_t q = n // 2
        cdef Py_ssize_t i, k

        # apply J:
        cdef Matrix A = <Matrix> copy(self)
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            A.swap_columns_c(i, i+1)  # Avoid some checks
            # A.set_col_to_multiple_of_col(i+1, i+1, -1)
            for k in range(n):
                A.set_unsafe(k, i+1, -A.get_unsage(k, i+1))

        cdef Matrix M = <Matrix> copy(A)

        # Baer-Faddeev-Leverrier algorithm:
        for k in range(1, q):
            c = -M.trace() / (2*k)
            # M = A * (M + c*1)
            # Add c along the diagonal
            for i in range(n):
                M.set_unsafe(i, i, M.get_unsafe(i, i) + c)
            M = A * M
        c = -M.trace() / (2*q)
        return (-1)**q * c
```
It would be really good if there was an in place version of `M = A * M`, but alas, I don't think there is. So we will have to have that temporary object. `:/`

Thank you for the feedback. This Cython version is already much better.

One question that occurred to me is whether the division by integers always works in the (fraction) field. It should, but I am not sure whether Sage always converts the integers mathematically correct.

Secondly, the algorithm should work for `QQ` algebras as well. I would guess, you can even assume an algebra over an integral domain of characteristic zero. Can you confirm that? But even if that works, it also depends on the answer of my first question.

Obviously, each ring constitutes an algebra over itself. But apparently, Sage doesn't recognize that. So, if the answer to all my above questions is "yes", how can we establish a general check for the matrix's base ring being an algebra over an integral domain with characteristic zero? And how would a conversion look like?

Yes, it should. At least for `ZZ`, the current version does the job, in particular:

```diff
+                if R in _Fields:
+                    pf = self._pf_bfl()
+                else:
+                    F = R.fraction_field()
+                    pf = self._coerce_element(self.change_ring(F)._pf_bfl())
```

But I am not sure whether this setup always works out.

Or do you suggest to rewrite `pfaffian` as well into Cython code?

No, because it is called within Cython code. You might need to change

```diff
-self.change_ring(F)._pf_bfl()
+(<Matrix> self.change_ring(F))._pf_bfl()
```
in the appropriate place so Cython knows the method exists.

No, that isn't worth it I think because the heavy lifting is done in the `_pf_bfl` method, which the end user will not see. (Although that is not to say that you shouldn't put some typing on things where appropriate.)

I am not quite sure what you mean by the rationalization. I am guessing you don't mean the fraction field.

Actually, one thing you could do is

```python
        # Baer-Faddeev-Leverrier algorithm:
        R = self._parent._base
        for k in range(1, q):
            c = R(-M.trace() / (2*k))
            # add c along the diagonal
            for i in range(n):
                M.set_unsafe(i ,i, M.get_unsafe(i, i) + c)
            M = A * M
        c = R(-M.trace() / (2*q))
        return (-1)**q * c
```
It will be slightly slower for matrices over fields, but my guess is it wouldn't even be significant except in some possibly some really small examples. For non-fields, it would guarantee every element belongs to `R` after every division. However, this would then fail for Pfaffians over, e.g., `ZZ` because an intermediate computation needed to be in `QQ`.

I think the best approach is probably converting the matrix to the fraction field, then coercing the result back to `R`.

I am guessing you don't mean the fraction field.\n\nAh, perhaps you mean extension of scalars to be a `QQ`-algebra. If this is the case, then Sage doesn't have this feature yet. You can change rings to be over `QQ`, but that won't work for algebras over, e.g., `ZZ['t']`. Well, I guess perhaps you could keep doing this until the base ring is itself:\n\n```\nsage: ZZ.base_ring()                                                                                                  \nInteger Ring\n```\nand then build new rings back.

Ah, perhaps you mean extension of scalars to be a `QQ`-algebra. If this is the case, then Sage doesn't have this feature yet. You can change rings to be over `QQ`, but that won't work for algebras over, e.g., `ZZ['t']`. Well, I guess perhaps you could keep doing this until the base ring is itself:

```
sage: ZZ.base_ring()                                                                                                  
Integer Ring
```
and then build new rings back. Although that feels a bit overkill right now as we can just go to the fraction field for this time with perhaps a `TODO` note.

Why do you think this is not a good approach?

What about:

```python
F = R.base_ring()
if QQ.is_subring(F):
    pf = self._pf_bfl()
```

This should work always.

```

I am not completely sure how and whether this works.

Because you could have something over `ZZ['q'].fraction_field()`, or worse over `QQ.category()` (this was done to minimize the number of categories constructed when varying over prime fields).

I am not entirely sure how much I trust that. It is more robust than I expected (I actually expected `QQ.is_subring(ZZ['t'].fraction_field())` to fail). From this check, I am comfortable enough to use this.

There shouldn't be any difference between dividing by 2 or 4 or 6 (unless working over `GF(3)`, but like I said above, this would fail later on, which is okay with me). Perhaps the `QQ.is_subring()` approach is best. At a certain point, we might be putting too much thought into this.

Exactly. The algorithm should also work if the ring's characteristic is bigger than the matrix dimension. This is also guaranteed by this approach. But perhaps you are right, we are putting too much thought into this.

I think, this might be good:

```python
if R in IntegralDomains():
    F = R.fraction_field()
    temp = <Matrix> self.change_ring(F)
else:
    F = R.base_ring()
    temp = <Matrix> copy(self)
if QQ.is_subring(F):
    pf = R(temp._pf_bfl())
```

This checks already make sure that the characteristic is zero even without using `characteristic` (which is good because the mixed form algebra for example does not have this method). Moreover, this guarantees the integer division to work.

Turns out that `is_subring` is indeed **very** robust. Works for algebras such as mixed forms and scalar fields, too. Using `base_ring` was not a good idea, fails for e.g. fraction fields.

Sorry for the mess. I hope that should be it. If I should add any more tests/examples, let me know.

Minor details:

```diff
-        Computes the Pfaffian of ``self`` using the Baer-Faddeev-LeVerrier
-        algorithm. This method assumes that the base ring is an `\QQ`-algebra.
+        Computes the Pfaffian of ``self`` using the Baer-Faddeev-LeVerrier
+        algorithm.
+
+        .. WARNING::
+
+            This method assumes that the base ring is an `\QQ`-algebra.
```
Also `Computes` -> `Compute` for `_pf_perfect_matchings` and bad comma spacing:

```diff
-M.set_unsafe(i ,i, M.get_unsafe(i, i) + c)
+M.set_unsafe(i, i, M.get_unsafe(i, i) + c)
```

I would also put the `bfl` method as the first choice in the doc since it is the "default" choice.
