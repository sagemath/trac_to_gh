At the current stage, the Pfaffian is computed using the definition by perfect matchings. This is tremendously demanding.

According to https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04247, there is an algorithm similar to the Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm for the determinant running in at most O(pow(n,4)). Furthermore, it is easy to implement. This algorithm works for any torsion-free ring.

<a id='comment:8'></a>What do you need info on? The determinant version? I think that would be better as a separate ticket.

I don't see the point in nailing `IntegralDomains()` in memory here. This function should not be called with the kind of frequency that would mandate that.

When the result is not a field, how does other such algorithms work in Sage? Do they convert the result back to the original ring? I feel like if I use a matrix over `ZZ`, I would expect a result in `ZZ`.

I would fully Cythonize `_pf_bfl` and write it as

```python
    cdef _pf_bfl(self):
        cdef Py_ssize_t n = self._ncols
        cdef Py_ssize_t q = n // 2
        cdef Py_ssize_t i, k

        # apply J:
        cdef Matrix A = <Matrix> copy(self)
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            A.swap_columns_c(i, i+1)  # Avoid some checks
            # A.set_col_to_multiple_of_col(i+1, i+1, -1)
            for k in range(n):
                A.set_unsafe(k, i+1, -A.get_unsage(k, i+1))

        cdef Matrix M = <Matrix> copy(A)

        # Baer-Faddeev-Leverrier algorithm:
        for k in range(1, q):
            c = -M.trace() / (2*k)
            # M = A * (M + c*1)
            # Add c along the diagonal
            for i in range(n):
                M.set_unsafe(i, i, M.get_unsafe(i, i) + c)
            M = A * M
        c = -M.trace() / (2*q)
        return (-1)**q * c
```
It would be really good if there was an in place version of `M = A * M`, but alas, I don't think there is. So we will have to have that temporary object. `:/`

Yes, it should. At least for `ZZ`, the current version does the job, in particular:

```diff
+                if R in _Fields:
+                    pf = self._pf_bfl()
+                else:
+                    F = R.fraction_field()
+                    pf = self._coerce_element(self.change_ring(F)._pf_bfl())
```

But I am not sure whether this setup always works out.

No, because it is called within Cython code. You might need to change

```diff
-self.change_ring(F)._pf_bfl()
+(<Matrix> self.change_ring(F))._pf_bfl()
```
in the appropriate place so Cython knows the method exists.

No, that isn't worth it I think because the heavy lifting is done in the `_pf_bfl` method, which the end user will not see. (Although that is not to say that you shouldn't put some typing on things where appropriate.)

So, if the answer to all my above questions is "yes", how can we establish a general check for the matrix's base ring being an algebra over an integral domain with characteristic zero? And how would a conversion look like?


Well, one option is to just try and and let it fail if it does something invalid. It just needs to be documented with what it is guaranteed to work for.

Why do you think this is not a good approach?

What about:

```python
F = R.base_ring()
if QQ.is_subring(F):
    pf = self._pf_bfl()
```

This should work always.

I peeked a bit into the matrix code; take a closer look at `with_added_multiple_of_row` in `matrix0.pyx`, there you want to multiply a row by an integer. Perhaps this is something we can adapt:

```python
F = Sequence([R.one()] + [1/(2*j) for j in range(1, k//2 + 1)]).universe()
if F in Rings():
    temp = <Matrix> self.change_ring(F)
    pf = R(temp._pf_bfl())
```

I am not completely sure how and whether this works.

Because you could have something over `ZZ['q'].fraction_field()`, or worse over `QQ.category()` (this was done to minimize the number of categories constructed when varying over prime fields).

I am not entirely sure how much I trust that. It is more robust than I expected (I actually expected `QQ.is_subring(ZZ['t'].fraction_field())` to fail). From this check, I am comfortable enough to use this.

It would fail later on, but that is okay.

There shouldn't be any difference between dividing by 2 or 4 or 6 (unless working over `GF(3)`, but like I said above, this would fail later on, which is okay with me). Perhaps the `QQ.is_subring()` approach is best. At a certain point, we might be putting too much thought into this.

Exactly. The algorithm should also work if the ring's characteristic is bigger than the matrix dimension. This is also guaranteed by this approach. But perhaps you are right, we are putting too much thought into this.

I think, this might be good:

```python
if R in IntegralDomains():
    F = R.fraction_field()
    temp = <Matrix> self.change_ring(F)
else:
    F = R.base_ring()
    temp = <Matrix> copy(self)
if QQ.is_subring(F):
    pf = R(temp._pf_bfl())
```

This checks already make sure that the characteristic is zero even without using `characteristic` (which is good because the mixed form algebra for example does not have this method). Moreover, this guarantees the integer division to work.
