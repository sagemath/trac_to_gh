The Sage distribution contains a number of "database packages", many of which do not seem to have a "real upstream" (or installation procedures other than our scripts in build/pkgs).

We transform them into pip-installable packages and publish them to PyPI so that they can be installed using standard Python tools (and become Python dependencies of sagelib) and then discovered by libraries using standard Python facilities.

Role model: https://pypi.org/project/database-knotinfo/

For those that do not have a real upstream, we create separate git repositories in github.com/sagemath/ to serve as new upstream.

List of packages/tickets:

Architecture independent:

- #33881 New upstream for `database_stein_watkins`
- `combinatorial_designs` (single text file `MOLS_table.txt`), 8 kB, https://repology.org/project/sagemath-combinatorial-designs/versions
- `graphs` (`graphs.db`, `brouwer_srg_database.json`, `smallgraphs.txt`, `isgci_sage.xml`), 336 kB; the `SPKG.rst` explains: The code used to parse the data from Andries E. Brouwer's website is available at https://github.com/nathanncohen/strongly_regular_graphs_database
- `polytopes_db` (various files), 41 kB
- `polytopes_db_4d` (various files), 878 MB

Prepared files:

- #32747: `conway_polynomials`
- elliptic_curves

New data sources:

- #30352 Interface to the KnotInfo and LinkInfo databases
- `database_graver_ppi` - https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mkoeppe/art/ppi/index.html
- https://mathdb.mathhub.info/
- https://swmath.org/

Related (other stuff written by the Sage distribution into $SAGE_SHARE): 
- #30306 - jupyter notebook related things
- #20080 - documentation
- #30885 - `sage.features`

Techniques:
- `importlib.resources` - would help making a distribution `zip_safe` (#31306)
- could consider advertise install location using a pkgconfig file: ticket:30787#comment:24 
- Reduce local duplication of large database package when venvs are in use: https://pypi.org/project/pydupes/ (similar to rdfind)
- Avoid duplicate installation by using [PEP 660 editable wheels](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/). Use a build backend that supports it: flit, pdm, hatchling, poetry, not setuptools. https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-660-and-setuptools/14855
- However there are [implementation restrictions in the interaction of editable wheels and implicit namespace packages](https://github.com/pfmoore/editables/blob/main/docs/source/implementation.md#import-hooks)

Yes, a confirmation of which bits would be nice. If @mkoeppe is right you are talking about
* combinatorial_designs
* conway_polynomials
* elliptic_curves
* graphs
* polytopes_db
* plus some other optional packages
They are indeed static but come in two flavors. 

Architecture independent:
* combinatorial_designs
* graphs
* polytopes_db
which are really file copying.

Prepared files
* conway_polynomials
* elliptic_curves
where the files are processed before install with some python code that may be depending on python or some other software. 

`conway_polynomials` uses `pickle.dump` which could pose problems across python versions?

`elliptic_curves` is put into a SQL database with sqlite, this should be a stable format. Don't know if that's portable between, say, x86_64 and ppc64le?

For these ones, we should make the actual source distribution architecture-independent.
The architecture-dependent products could be built during setup.py - and published as wheels.
