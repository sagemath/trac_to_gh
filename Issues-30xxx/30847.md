I have never used sagenb, the graph database or the interactive query tool. I'm also still not using Jupyter, but should clearly try it.

This is one of the few tests that we let with a py2 tag because we won't know what to do with it / how to make it work.
Do we have any user of this functionality ?

For the `rst2txt` feature, i agree that it should be removed (easy). For the graph database interact feature, the question goes beyond the doctests:

- shall we rewrite the interact for jupyter (using ipyidgets) ?
- is the database used at all ?
- is the database easily accessible without the interact ?
- could the 13 years old database be extended to more vertices ? If yes, where is the source code to produce it ? The page of Jason Grout were it was hosted does not exist anymore (but we could probably contact him).

It would be nice to restore the functionality in Jupyter.

The code for Jason Grout's Small Graph Database
is now available at:

- https://github.com/jasongrout/graph_database

The description page previously at

- http://jasongrout.org/graph_database

is archived at

- https://web.archive.org/web/20210302071151/http://jasongrout.org/graph_database

and the interface pages previously at

- http://jasongrout.org/graphs
- http://jasongrout.org/graphs-2

are offline but archived at

- https://github.com/jasongrout/graph_database

Restoring an interactive interface to the database
in modern and secure JavaScript needs work.
