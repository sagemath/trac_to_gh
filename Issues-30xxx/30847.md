I have never used sagenb, the graph database or the interactive query tool. I'm also still not using Jupyter, but should clearly try it.

This is one of the few tests that we let with a py2 tag because we won't know what to do with it / how to make it work.
Do we have any user of this functionality ?

Replying to [@sagetrac-tmonteil](#comment%3A4):

It would be nice to restore the functionality in Jupyter.

The code for Jason Grout's Small Graph Database
is now available at:

- https://github.com/jasongrout/graph_database

The description page previously at

- http://jasongrout.org/graph_database

is archived at

- https://web.archive.org/web/20210302071151/http://jasongrout.org/graph_database

and the interface pages previously at

- http://jasongrout.org/graphs
- http://jasongrout.org/graphs-2

are offline but archived at

- https://github.com/jasongrout/graph_database

Restoring an interactive interface to the database
in modern and secure JavaScript needs work.
