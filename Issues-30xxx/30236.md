Finally, don't you have a problem reading your variables if the dimension of the Lie algebra is >10?

The rest looks good to me.

I want the more compact version for the variables when the dimension is small. The larger dimensions was just to remove the ambiguity.

Yes you most certainly are. Just put in your full name as the reviewer and you can set the positive review.
