Just in case you haven't changed it yet, in line five of the docstring for `universal_polynomials` it should read:

```
`[e_i, e_j] = \tau_{ij}^a e_a` is given by
```

It's missing the second ```

Also, the definition in the docstring does not seem to coincide with equation (6) in the reference. In the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00711.pdf the definition of the universal polynomials in this case is

```
 P_{aij} = \sum_{u \in I} \tau_{ij}^u X_{au}
                - \sum_{s,t \in I} \tau_{st}^a X_{si} X_{tj},
```

as opposed to the current:

```
 P_{aij} = \sum_{u \in I} \tau_{ij}^u X_{au}
                - \sum_{s,t \in I} \tau_{st}^a X_{ai} X_{tj},

The issue in[comment:3](#comment%3A3) is only a typo in the docstring, the code seems fine.

Finally, don't you have a problem reading your variables if the dimension of the Lie algebra is >10?

The rest looks good to me.

I want the more compact version for the variables when the dimension is small. The larger dimensions was just to remove the ambiguity.

Yes you most certainly are. Just put in your full name as the reviewer and you can set the positive review.
