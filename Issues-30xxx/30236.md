Just in case you haven't changed it yet, in line five of the docstring for `universal_polynomials` it should read:

```

It's missing the second <code>\`</code>

The issue in [comment:3](#comment:3) is only a typo in the docstring, the code seems fine.

Finally, don't you have a problem reading your variables if the dimension of the Lie algebra is >10?

The rest looks good to me.

I want the more compact version for the variables when the dimension is small. The larger dimensions was just to remove the ambiguity.

> If I'm allowed to be a reviewer you can put a positive review on my behalf. 

Yes you most certainly are. Just put in your full name as the reviewer and you can set the positive review.
