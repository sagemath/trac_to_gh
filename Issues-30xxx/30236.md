Just in case you haven't changed it yet, in line five of the docstring for `universal_polynomials` it should read:

```
`[e_i, e_j] = \tau_{ij}^a e_a` is given by
```

It's missing the second <code>\`</code>

Also, the definition in the docstring does not seem to coincide with equation (6) in the reference. In the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00711.pdf the definition of the universal polynomials in this case is

```
 P_{aij} = \sum_{u \in I} \tau_{ij}^u X_{au}
                - \sum_{s,t \in I} \tau_{st}^a X_{si} X_{tj},
```

as opposed to the current:

```
 P_{aij} = \sum_{u \in I} \tau_{ij}^u X_{au}
                - \sum_{s,t \in I} \tau_{st}^a X_{ai} X_{tj},
```

The issue in [comment:3](#comment%3A3) is only a typo in the docstring, the code seems fine.

Finally, don't you have a problem reading your variables if the dimension of the Lie algebra is >10?

The rest looks good to me.

I want the more compact version for the variables when the dimension is small. The larger dimensions was just to remove the ambiguity.

> If I'm allowed to be a reviewer you can put a positive review on my behalf. 

Yes you most certainly are. Just put in your full name as the reviewer and you can set the positive review.
