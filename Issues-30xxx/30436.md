I understand neither the first of your changes nor the code it modifies. What is the point of calling `AlternatingSignMatrix()` and ignoring its result? Does it have side-effects? If not, why aren't you removing the instruction entirely (and the assignment to `M` on the previous line as well)?

The rest looks fine to me.
