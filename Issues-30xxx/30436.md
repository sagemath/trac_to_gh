I understand neither the first of your changes nor the code it modifies. What is the point of calling `AlternatingSignMatrix()` and ignoring its result? Does it have side-effects? If not, why aren't you removing the instruction entirely (and the assignment to `M` on the previous line as well)?

Well, this line checks that the matrix is indeed an alternating sign matrix. We do not care about the result, so there is not need to store it.
