Follow-up from #25486 (Discover `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` to make `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` work from any directory, in an environment without `SAGE_*` variables) and #22731.

We make sure that `$SAGE_VENV/bin` (from #22731) appears at the beginning of the `PATH`.  For virtual environments such as those set up by tox (#29950), this may be different from and should take precedence over `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.  This will ensure that 
- the correct copy of auxiliary scripts such as `sage-eval` is invoked by `sage`;
- the correct copy of `python3` is run.

To determine `SAGE_VENV`:
- If `src/bin/sage` is invoked directly out of the source tree, it will run a new non-installed `configure`-generated script `sage-src-env-config`
- An installed `sage` script installed by `setup.py` in `SAGE_LOCAL` or in a venv will run a Python script `sage-venv-config` instead.

Using the new script `sage-venv-config` is probably overkill.
If #30888 resolves the symlink of $0, we could just infer the `SAGE_VENV` from its directory.

Why do you actually need go through the trouble of determining `SAGE_VENV` in some shell scripts? Isn't it enough to use `SAGE_VENV = sys.prefix` (which is already done in `env.py`)?
