Follow-up from #25486 (Discover `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` to make `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` work from any directory, in an environment without `SAGE_*` variables) and #22731.

We make sure that `$SAGE_VENV/bin` (from #22731) appears at the beginning of the `PATH`.  For virtual environments such as those set up by tox (#29950), this may be different from and should take precedence over `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.  This will ensure that 
- the correct copy of auxiliary scripts such as `sage-eval` is invoked by `sage`;
- the correct copy of `python3` is run.

To determine `SAGE_VENV`:
- If `src/bin/sage` is invoked directly out of the source tree, it will run a new non-installed `configure`-generated script `sage-src-env-config`
- An installed `sage` script installed by `setup.py` in `SAGE_LOCAL` or in a venv will run a Python script `sage-venv-config` instead.

Why do you actually need go through the trouble of determining `SAGE_VENV` in some shell scripts? Isn't it enough to use `SAGE_VENV = sys.prefix` (which is already done in `env.py`)?

<a id='comment:24'></a>This breaks if `sage_conf` is not installed, because VERSION is defined there

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/sage-venv-config", line 29, in <module>
    _main()
  File "/usr/bin/sage-venv-config", line 17, in _main

```
If this is really intended and sage_conf is now mandatory, then ImportError from sage_conf shouldn't be trapped. But I hope it can still be possible to support `sage_conf`-less systems.
