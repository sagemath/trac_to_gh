<a id='comment:24'></a>I've put #30551 now to 9.3 since I agree it would be convenient to drop python 3.6 support soon. Matthias, please feel free to put both tickets onto 9.4 if you strongly feel that 3.6 still needs to be supported.

Why do you push Python-3.6-needed changes to a ticket that depends on #30551 ?
It just makes no sense to me.

Gentoo does it in `/usr/lib64/ecl-20.4.24` - as can be seen it is versioned. This is the place where ecl put a lot of its own libraries. It is determined by running the following ecl lisp formula, which I believe is the same in vanilla sage.

```
ecl -eval "(princ (SI:GET-LIBRARY-PATHNAME))" -eval "(quit)"
```
It could be interesting to know other, or how to set other, paths to install .fas files for ecl.

There is no universally agreed place to put .fas files, after all you can just use `(load "/wherever/whatever.fas")` to load them from any place you like. But `/usr/lib64/ecl-20.4.24` makes the most sense for libraries useable for multiple projects and also allows you to call `(require :whatever)` to use the fas in ECL. On the other hand, if the .fas file is only useable for a single project, I would rather put it in `/usr/lib64/some-other-project/` and explicitely load it from there.

As I said, you just call `(load "/path/to/lib.fas")`. This is a standard common lisp function for loading compiled code or source code into the running image, much like `dlopen` loads a shared library in C.
