This will probably resolve magically once #28485 has been merged.

swewers: It would be nice if you could come up with a small list of examples where this does not work so we can add these as tests.

And though that's not really the same issue, we could also add some tests for https://github.com/MCLF/mclf/issues/103 which #28485 should resolve as well.
