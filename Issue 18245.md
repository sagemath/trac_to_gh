Hello,

Waiting for the patchbot final check. But this is good for me.

Patchbot passes with only some long test timeouts. The patchbot ascii plugin fails and I have difficulties making `doc-pdf` in `ru/tutorial` but that could be spurious.

replying to [comment:11 comment:11]: What did you do in `e01e088`? If this is only a merge commit you can remove it. If there is something else it needs to be separated.

The branch link was red, so I merged develop. Indeed there was no merge conflict when I did. I'll remove it so we can see if it goes red again.

It's red again, see for yourself.

I see. It was discussed on sage-devel. The merge test of the trac plugin is less concilient than the default git merge.

But still, I do not see the need of an additional commit.
