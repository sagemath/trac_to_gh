Keywords: days85

Right now, they can be constructed using the experimental GAP3 spkg using `ReflectionGroup`, but we can have a native version by using the root system code. The advantage to this implementation is that it is extremely fast to iterate over.

We also refactor the element classes and move some other code up to the appropriate categories. A small bug is also fixed for checking irreducibility for generic Dynkin diagrams.

It could be that more things need to be moved up to the category, that are essentially generic methods, and some more ``@`abstract_methods` defined. However, I think we can worry about that later as we come across them.

I noticed a few other things to do. I will finish them after lunch.
