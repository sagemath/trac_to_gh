# Issue 27481: graphs with edges twice don't raise warning

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27718

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2019-04-25 02:01:39

When using the short form for graph generation with a dictionary, the following is accepted:


```
sage: G1 = Graph({1: [3], 2: [0], 1: [2]})
```


But when plotting this, it becomes clear that the vertex `3` is wiped out.  So ... probably this is user error, I admit.

**But** I think it is a user error that should be warned against, as especially with typos it would be very easy to occur (not to mention bad programming where a loop recurs without intent).  Any ideas?

If you want to change that, you must change `dict`, not graph constructors.

```
sage: D = {1: [3], 2: [0], 1: [2]}
sage: D
{1: [2], 2: [0]}
```

Haha, I didn't check that!  Shows it's been a while since I did that.  Well, then user error it is and wontfix.  Too bad, as I could imagine some much more subtle examples - mine is obviously easy to fix, but if auto-generated one could imagine something like this slipping through more easily.

Feel free to put positive review and your name in the Reviewer section.  Or do you think it would be worth adding an example in the documentation (for graphs, I mean) to warn about this for people who aren't familiar with (or forgot!) this property of `dict`?

No need to add example. Users should learn a bit of Python / coding ...

Author might be useful as well ;)

Ah, but there are no authors with wontfix/duplicates :-)
