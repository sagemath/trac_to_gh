Keywords: lp

The COIN, CPLEX, GLPK, and Gurobi backends supply a `copy` method. 
But it's not documented as a backend interface method in `GenericBackend`, and the CVXOPT, PPL, InteractiveLP backends do not implement it. 
It is used by `MixedIntegerLinearProgram.__copy__`.

The backend method should actually probably be called `__copy__` as well -- see https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html

See also #15159 (which may indicate that we may need a `__deepcopy__` method as well) and #20323 (in which copying a backend could be the basis for more diverse tests)

It's working. I've added another test to illustrate deepcopy semantics.

Before this patch, deepcopy didn't even copy the backend of a MIP. 
Now it does, simply by doing the same as copy.

Both copy and deepcopy have weird semantics in relation to the MIPVariables in a problems -- because a MIP does not have an API to gain access to its variables; and trying to use the old MIPVariables with the copy is questionable and definitely broken if one creates new components of this variable, see #15159, #19523. Fixing this would require a redesign; a possible stopgap would be to stop all MIPVariables from creating new components when they have been subjected to copy().

Thanks for reviewing.

I've created a new ticket, #20461, for solving the issue with the variables of a copied MIP. Please take a look when you have a chance.
