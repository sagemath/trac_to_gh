From comments on #2100 about aspect ratio:

```
Would it be possible to extend the functionality so that it is possible to specify either only width or only height of the final figure? I am thinking of using it in conjunction with SageTeX, where it would be natural to ask either for width=\textwidth or height=0.5\texthight and have the second dimension determined automatically based on the actual plot and aspect ratio.
```

This seems reasonable, but was bigger than the goals of #2100.
