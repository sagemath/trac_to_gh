# Issue 20979: direct function call to math/cmath/mpmath/numpy

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21216

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2016-08-10 21:52:10

We change the behavior of `function(x)` when `x` is one of:
- Python float
- Python complex
- mpmath element
- numpy element
In that case, the relevant function of the modules math/cmath/mpmath/numpy are used directly.
