The command `sage -ipython` uses `~/.ipython` as it's configurations directory. This is probably not the intended behaviour, since programs installed through `sage` are not supposed to interfere with installed independently. In fact, if one installs the latest version of `ipython` and runs `sage ipython` it returns the following error message:

```
WARNING: Configuration file ipythonrc not found. Ignoring request.
------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/itaibn/sage-5.0.beta7/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/ConfigLoader.py", line 66, in load
    fname = filefind(fname,incpath)
  File "/home/itaibn/sage-5.0.beta7/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/genutils.py", line 554, in filefind
    ' not found in current or supplied directories:' + `alt_dirs`
IOError: File'ipythonrc' not found in current or supplied directories:u'/home/itaibn/.ipython'

WARNING: Problems loading configuration file 'ipythonrc'
Starting with default -bare bones- configuration.
```


And then then continues with `ipython` in what is presumably the `-bare bones-` configuration.

It seems similar, but I'm not sure. That ticket looks like it is about running something internal in `sage` rather the command-line interface, but it does seem similar.

Maybe it's not a duplicate. Unfortunately, the "obvious" patch

doesn't work: then `sage --ipython` has "sage: " as a prompt. I think that someone needs to improve how we deal with the IPython config files. See also #12167.
