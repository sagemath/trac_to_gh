When cplex is installed, the following occur

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.vertex_connectivity()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

I tried to put a doctest with `sage: round(p.solve())`, but it's not using the same `round`...

As a remark, I do not have cplex installed, but I confirm it works with Gurobi.
