I've been getting this very frequently when running tests under heavy CPU load. This happens on Sage 9.5 too but curiously I only started seeing this on March 18th, even though Nixpkgs updated to Sage 9.5 on January 31st. I don't have a full list of packages updated between those two dates, but Tachyon was updated from 0.99b6 to 0.99.3 around this time. I'd be happy to provide extra information.

I've just got the exact same issue when building/doctesting the sagemath void package on github actions. Happened with x86_64 and i686 (but not with x86_64-musl).

Not copying the log since it is identical.

Edit: in case it is relevant, we use singular 4.3.1p2 from system.

Here's a way to reproduce it:

```
sage: for i in range(1_000_000):
....:     singular._eval_line('for(int i=1;i<=3;i++){i=1;};', wait_for_prompt=False)
....:     if not singular.interrupt(tries=1, timeout=1e-6):
....:         print(f"FAIL in step {i} ")
....:         break
....:     _ = singular('2+3')
....: 
^[[A''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
Singular crashed -- automatically restarting.
''
FAIL in step 7 
```


The "Singular crashed" output is expected.

As reported, this fails more if there is a heavy load, and I think using `tries=1` and `timeout=1e-6` also helps it. For the heavy load, right now I am running `sage -tp 8 --all --long` (8 core / 8 thread box)

A comment before the doctest says:

```
        For reasons which are currently not understood, the ``interrupt``
        test usually returns immediately, but sometimes it takes a very
        long time on the same system. ::
```

I guess "takes a very long time" sometimes is more than the default `timeout=2.0` seconds repeated more than the default `tries=5` times in a row.

This essentially reverts 85f65bf and a10d19d from trac #31846.
It turns out this was originaly written for #30945, but that issue was
fixed by upgrading cysignals.
    
Singular really needs a custom `_send_interrupt()` method, because the
default one will quit singular. Moreover, this handles two quirks of
singular:
    
- a small delay before sending `chr(3)` works around a bug in singular.
- sometimes one needs to send `;` a few times after interrupt to get
  back a prompt.
    
The original author of the custom `_send_interrupt()` is Jeroen Demeyer
in commit 17d23e9 (trac #10476). I changed the timeout for a smaller
one, and rewrote the doctest to call `interrupt()` explicitly instead of
using `alarm()` which introduces more noise.
