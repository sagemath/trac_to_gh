oh, this breaks our rst linter, for instance

```
sage/databases/sql_db.py:1263:1: RST304 Unknown interpreted text role "kbd".
```

so we need to add this role to some list somewhere. But where ?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2022-10-04 06:49:10

probably in src/tox.ini where there is a list "rst-roles"
