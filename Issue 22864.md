# Issue 22864: Stop using cysignals .pxi files (part 3)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23101

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2017-05-30 07:50:58

Follow-up to #22806 and #22896: we should stop using the deprecated files `cysignals/memory.pxi` and `cysignals/signals.pxi`.

Given the large number of files which need to be changed, this is done in parts.
