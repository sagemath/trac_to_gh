What is the new policy? Do we intend to remove all `all.py` eventually? If not, what should(can) remain in `all.py`? Or this is determined by how we split sage library? The last case is not good, I think... 

Or there won't be no change in `all.py` but we stop importing things from it in Sage library?

All `all.py` are kept, for the purpose of populating the global interactive environment (`sage.all`).

We are just getting rid of imports from `sage.PAC.KAGE.all` within the Sage library. In particular, the imports from those packages `sage.PAC.KAGE` that become namespace packages, i.e., filled with modules from several distributions.

Okay.

May I understand the new policy as that we never import from `.all` within the Sage library?

That would be a safe and easy to understand way to phrase a new policy.

But that policy would be broader than what is technically needed.
