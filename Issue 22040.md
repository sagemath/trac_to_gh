Keywords: change_ring, Laurent Polynomial ring, multivariate

The following does not work:



```
sage: R.<x, y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: a = x^2 + 3*x^3 + 5*x^-1
sage: a.change_ring(GF(3))
```



However, the following works:



```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: a = x^2 + 3*x^3 + 5*x^-1
sage: a.change_ring(GF(3))
```

and


```
sage: R.<x, y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: a = x^2 + 3*x^3 + 5*x^-1
sage: R.change_ring(GF(3))(a)
```

Good catch; `change_ring` should be there for consistency. The best fix IMO would be to move the `change_ring` method from the `LaurentPolynomial_univariate` class to `LaurentPolynomial_generic`.
