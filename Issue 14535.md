Shouldn't the `.rst` files be included in the (compiled) distribution since they are the output for documentation and we don't want to make a user (re)build the documentation as a part of the installation?

Here's a patch. By the way, `sage --sdist ...` on OS X does not preserve the symlinks to conf.py in the subdirectories of `doc/en/reference`: it creates copies of the file instead of links. is that a bug in our code, or is it something in Python?

It would be nice to have a separate tarball with (only) the pre-built documentation though, but that's another thing.
