As reported at [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/ziq504RHwh8/uNIJ98hhBQAJ), there is a bug with adding a face, once the attribute `_faces` has been populated:

```
sage: X = SimplicialComplex([[0], [1]])
sage: temp = X.faces(SimplicialComplex(()))
sage: X.add_face([0,1])
```

raises an error.
