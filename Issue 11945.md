# Issue 11945: Bugfixes and improvements to Aurifeuillian factorization

Issue created by migration from Trac.

```
sage: from sage.rings.factorint import factor_aurifeuillian as fa
sage: fa(2^6006 + 1)
[...]
```


This should produce a splitting, but instead it just returns a singleton.  The problem is that there's rounding error because of the fixed precision of 300 in aurifeuillian.

This patch also updates this factorization function to allow for a greater variety of bases.

Fine as far as I can see. I tested rings/ --long and compared manually a few values from the Cunningham tables.
