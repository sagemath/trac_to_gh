# Issue 27737: Implement facets method for Polyhedron

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27974

Keywords: polytopes, facets

It is often practical to get directly the facets of a polyhedron object without having to compute or to know the dimension of the object.

This ticket implements the following shortcut:


```
sage: c = polytopes.hypercube(4)
sage: dim = c.dimension()
sage: c.faces(dim-1)
(A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices)
```


Now becomes:


```
sage: c = polytopes.hypercube(4)
sage: c.facets()
(A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices)
```

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Changing keywords from "polytopes, facets" to "polytopes, facets, days100".

Suggestion: add cross-references, in the new method:

```
        .. SEEALSO:: :meth:`faces`
```

and the same in the other direction

Suggestion: in the files `base.py`, `face.py`, and `library.py`, perhaps it would be nice to change the tests involving `faces(a_number_here)` where the intented thing is really `.facets`.

This way, the function is advertized in the documentation of functions, and also well-tested.

There are sufficient tests with `faces` that are not facets not to have this a regression. Further, it still uses `faces` anyways. So no loss in strength of testing...

One comment about the bot result: The pyflake line is taken care of in #27993.

Merge conflict

Please remove the insertion of spaces in the banner.

The conflict is probably from the library somewhere...

Looks good and the patchbot is green.

One detail needs to be fixed :

There is a seealso in facets referring to facets. It should refer to faces instead.

Once done, you can set to positive review on my behalf.
