Factorization of non-monic polynomials seems to fail sometimes.

```
sage: R = Zp(2,type='fixed-mod',prec=3);P.<x>=R[]
sage: p=(1 + 2)*x^2 + (1 + 2)*x
sage: p.roots()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PariError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
.....
PariError: impossible inverse in diviiexact: 0
sage: p=p//p.leading_coefficient()
sage: p.roots()
[(1 + 2 + 2^2 + O(2^3), 1), (O(2^3), 1)]
```

And the same for `.factor()`

How badly do you need this? It feels overkill to upgrade the PARI package in Sage just for this.

Thank you for caring about this ticket :). It is not urgent.
After all there is a simple workaround by norming the polynomial in sage and only then giving it to pari. It seems to work fine for monic polynomials.

Another possibility is to define your polynomials over `QQ` and then factor them over `Qp`. That is more robust.
