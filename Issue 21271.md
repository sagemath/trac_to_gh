Let me just say that I consider #21613 not an important step towards this task ("... standard distutils behavior"). The present task ticket (#21508) is concerned with getting the *behavior* of `setup.py` standard (how does it respond to standard commands and options), not necessarily its *implementation*. The fact that `setup.py` with #21480 invokes `make` is an implementation detail, which is not very relevant for the goal of #21507.

Except it is pretty non-standard for it to have non-trivial side-effects (e.g. running a subprocess that generates files) unconditionally.  Behavior-wise that should only happen when it's actually important for that to happen, such as during the build command.
