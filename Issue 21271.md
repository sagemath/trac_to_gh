Let me just say that I consider #21613 not an important step towards this task ("... standard distutils behavior"). The present task ticket (#21508) is concerned with getting the *behavior* of `setup.py` standard (how does it respond to standard commands and options), not necessarily its *implementation*. The fact that `setup.py` with #21480 invokes `make` is an implementation detail, which is not very relevant for the goal of #21507.
