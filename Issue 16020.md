# Issue 16020: Unnatural syntax of G.relabel()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16257

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2014-04-28 08:58:23

This was reported on sage-support by Pedro Cruz:


```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.relabel( [ i+1 for i in range(G.order()) ], inplace=True )
sage: G.relabel( [ i+1 for i in range(G.order()) ], inplace=True )
```


This is because relabeling with a list as an argument only works when the graph's vertices are `0,...,n-1`. With this branch this syntax always works, by using for the graph's vertices the order given by `G.vertices()`. Should not lead to any confusion I hope.

I've done the following instructions and checked that the reported situation has been solved.


```python
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.relabel( [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], inplace=True )
sage: G.relabel( [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], inplace=True )
sage: G.vertices()
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
sage: G.relabel( lambda i: i+1, inplace=True )
sage: G.vertices()
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
sage: G.relabel( [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], inplace=True )
sage: G.vertices()
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```


Also, sage -t graphs/ got "All tests passed!".
