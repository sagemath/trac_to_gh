Great, thanks. Yes, I thought it's more welcoming if I make it sound like it's something that we'd like to have. I wouldn't mind accepting PRs on [GitHub](GitHub) but I don't want to maintain the necessary infrastructure and if I had to choose, I'd prefer MRs on [GitLab](GitLab).

Btw, could you also disable the Wiki & Projects on our [GitHub](GitHub) page? We might want to leave the issues tab active so people get to see the message that redirects them to trac?
