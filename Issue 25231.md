# Issue 25231: GitHub templates

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This adds templates when people create Issues & PRs on [GitHub](GitHub) (telling them not to do so.) In the long run it would be great to support this somehow but as long as we don't have that in place it's better to reduce frustration on both sides.

embray: Would you mind dropping the somewhat unfriendly "NO PRs" from our github page then? (While you're at it, could you change Sage's URL to use `https`?)

I'm not sure about the use of "yet".  Will we ever accept PRs on GitHub? :)  I thought we were just going to on GitLab.  Either way I'm fine with leaving the possibility open.  And will do re: the changes on GH.

Great, thanks. Yes, I thought it's more welcoming if I make it sound like it's something that we'd like to have. I wouldn't mind accepting PRs on [GitHub](GitHub) but I don't want to maintain the necessary infrastructure and if I had to choose, I'd prefer MRs on [GitLab](GitLab).

Btw, could you also disable the Wiki & Projects on our [GitHub](GitHub) page? We might want to leave the issues tab active so people get to see the message that redirects them to trac?

Done.  I think they'll still see the relevant message if they go to submit a PR.
