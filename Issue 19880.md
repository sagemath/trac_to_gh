This works now, the bots are green (except librae, which is broken)

Do we also want to standardize the error messages to follow the "they are not sentences" standard (i.e., they don't start with an uppercase letter nor end with a period) while we are at it? If you don't, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

no, I would prefer to keep that for another day.

Thanks, Travis.

I'm not going to set this ticket back to needs_work, but I wonder why you changed

```
        ArithmeticError: Invariants (= [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) do not describe an elliptic curve.
```

to

```
        ArithmeticError: Invariants (= 0,0,0,0,0) do not describe an elliptic curve.
```

Yes, this was a side effect from changing from `%` to `format` in one raise statement. I have chosen to correct the single failing doctest rather than to modify the raise again.
