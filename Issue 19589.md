We should remove the default `random_element`, which just raises a `NotImplementedError` to allow for the `random_element` from the category to be used. In particular, finite groups should be able to get a random element:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['D',4])
sage: W.random_element()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: 
```

I also don't think we need a deprecation because it was previously returning an error, a deprecation would not allow the category implementation to be applied, and IMO this is a bug.

I would not claim that the `random_element` from category is much better... it calls `unrank` which in the case of `CoxeterGroup` is just the default one

```
def urank(self, r):
    counter = 0
    for u in self:
        if counter == r:
            return u
        counter += 1
    raise ValueError
```

But there is a trick! If you call `W.list()` it magically switches to `_unrank_from_list`. See the difference

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['D',4])
sage: %timeit W.random_element()
1 loops, best of 3: 403 ms per loop
sage: l = W.list()
sage: %timeit W.random_element()
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.28 Âµs per loop
```
