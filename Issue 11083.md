Salut Timo,

Below are my comments.

>  * `remove` method;


Instead of writing a sentence about the input, I prefer if we follow the Sage Developper's Guide and write an INPUT section.

No need to import E1Star in the doctest of the remove method.

>  * `__hash__` method;


I have some concerns about adding a hash method to the Patch class. Since a patch can be modified (by using the remove method for instance), strange behavior can occur like the following :

```
sage: P = Patch(...)
sage: Q = copy(P)
sage: S = set()
sage: S.add(P)
sage: P.remove(some face A)
sage: Q.remove(some face A)
sage: Q in S
False      
sage: Q == S.pop()
True
```

Any serious Python or Sage object is either mutable and unhashable or immutable and hashable. In Sage, matrices and vector are allowed to pass from one state to the other using methods like `set_immutable` and `set_mutable`. This issue must be fixed.

>  * deal more cleanly with construction of new patches (sometimes the same Face belonged to different patches, which caused problems with colors, for example).


Can you provide an example that justifies the modification? Without an example, I can not say that I agree with the solution. I feel like the solution is doing too much copies. But, I can't suggest an alternative, since I do not know what the problem really is.

Once the problem is solved, such an example illustrating the problem you mention must be added as a doctest.



And finally, I do not understand this modification :

```diff
-       return (isinstance(other, Patch) and set(self) == set(other)) 
+ 	return (isinstance(other, Patch) and set(self._faces) == set(other._faces)) 
```

I agree, I corrected this.

Thanks for mentionning this. I corrected many other instances of the same issue.

Here is why I added a `__hash__` method to Patch:

```
sage: P = Patch([Face([0,0,0],1), Face([0,0,0],2)])
sage: Q = Patch([Face([0,0,0],2), Face([0,0,0],1)])
sage: P == Q
True
sage: hash(P)
1297676529065262660
sage: hash(Q)
-8173426908364432914
```

I had a lot of problems because of this when I used some `DiGraphs` whose vertices were `Patches`. If you have a better solution, let me know. I added it in the doctest under a TEST section.

Here is the problem with colors if we don't create new faces in Patch.__init__:

```
sage: P = Patch([Face([0,0,0],1), Face([0,0,0],2)])
sage: Q = Patch(P)
sage: P[0].color()
RGB color (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
sage: Q[0].color('yellow')
sage: P[0].color()
RGB color (1.0, 1.0, 0.0)
```

Let me know if you have a better solution. I added it in the doctest under a TEST section.


> And finally, I do not understand this modification :

> ```


OK, I reverted this useless modification (something I had tested but forgot to remove).


Please tell me if you agree with what I said concerning the main two issues you raised (`__hash__` and creating new faces in `Patch.__init__`). I will upload a new patch if you confirm.

Also, do you think the following code of `Patch.remove` can be made better? (It looks pretty naive but I'm not sure if using `set` would be more efficient...):

```
if isinstance(faces, Face):
    while faces in self._faces:
        self._faces.remove(faces)
else:
    for f in faces:
        while f in self._faces:
            self._faces.remove(f)
```

If we want Patches to be keys of dictionnary, vertices of graphs or elements of
sets, it must be hashable. The easiest solution I see is that an object Patch
be always hashable and never mutable. That means we made a mistake earlier by
allowing to modify a Patch. I am responsible for this as I remember I disliked
methods like `apply_substitution` but I were not able to verbalize it and
relate this with the ability of hashing the object.

There are three methods that change self : `add`, `apply_substitution`
and `repaint`. I think we can keep `repaint` as it does not change the
mathematical object and hence won't affect the result of the hash method (a
doctest making sure of that the hash method is independant of color changes
should be added).  Surprisingly, we did not made the mistake with the method
`translate` which does not change self and return a new patch. I think it
is easy to remove the method `apply_substitution` since (1) one can apply a
substitution by just applying a substiution directly on it : ``E(P)`` and (2)
the only reason I can understand the existence of the method
`apply_substitution` is that it is faster than doing ``E(P)`` which is not
the case anyway since it calls ``E(P)`` anyway. I also think the method
`add` can be easily removed. We should replace it by a method `__add__` or `union` which adds two patches and return a new patch.

Now, the method `adds` and `apply_substitution` should not be removed
right now. Deprecation warnings should be added. Well usually, a deprecation
warning should be raised for one year before removing the method. But, since I
believe fixing the immutable/hashable issue is very important. I think their
behavior could be changed now. A deprecation warning saying something like :
"Object sage.combinat.e_one_star.Patch are immutable since Sage-4.7.1. Use the
usual addition instead which returns a new object: P + Q." A similar warning
should be added to the method `apply_substitution`.

One can create a Patch from a (1) iterable of faces or (2) from a Patch. The
problem comes from the case (2) were a copy should be done.  Here is my first
suggestion: 

```
if isinstance(faces, Patch):
    self._faces = [Face(f.vector(), f.type(), f.color()) for f in faces]
else:
    self._faces = list(faces)
```

First, there is a problem with the method `remove` because it changes the
Patch. Compare the methods and their name of the mutable unhashable Python set
and the immutable and hashable Python frozenset :

```
sage: python_set = set([])
sage: [method for method in dir(python_set) if not method.startswith('_')]
['add', 'clear', 'copy', 'difference', 'difference_update', 'discard',
'intersection', 'intersection_update', 'isdisjoint', 'issubset', 'issuperset',
'pop', 'remove', 'symmetric_difference', 'symmetric_difference_update',
'union', 'update']
sage: frozen_set = frozenset()
sage: [method for method in dir(frozen_set) if not method.startswith('_')]
['copy', 'difference', 'intersection', 'isdisjoint', 'issubset', 'issuperset',
'symmetric_difference', 'union']
```

Hence, I suggest to implement a method called `difference` which returns a
new Patch instead of the method remove.

My last question concerns the representation of the Patch. Now, we represent a
patch as a list of faces. I think this choice was made because we wanted an
object Patch to be mutable without loosing time on unicity of faces concerns
which did not bothered us, since it is guarenteed mathematically (well at least
for the application of E1Stars). But, if a Patch is now immutable, maybe a
Python frozenset or maybe a Sage Set (also immutable) would be better. 

```
sage: sage_set = Set([])
sage: [method for method in dir(sage_set) if not method.startswith('_')]
['CartesianProduct', 'Hom', 'algebra', 'an_element', 'base', 'base_ring',
'cardinality', 'cartesian_product', 'categories', 'category', 'coerce',
'coerce_embedding', 'coerce_map_from', 'construction', 'convert_map_from',
'db', 'difference', 'dump', 'dumps', 'element_class', 'frozenset', 'gens_dict',
'get_action', 'has_base', 'has_coerce_map_from', 'hom', 'inject_variables',
'injvar', 'intersection', 'is_exact', 'is_finite', 'latex_name',
'latex_variable_names', 'list', 'normalize_names', 'object', 'objgen',
'objgens', 'register_action', 'register_coercion', 'register_conversion',
'register_embedding', 'rename', 'reset_name', 'save', 'set', 'some_elements',
'subsets', 'symmetric_difference', 'union', 'variable_name', 'variable_names',
'version']
```

What do you think?

OK, these methods now return a new patch, along with a deprecation warning.
I changed the doc in favor of using `E1Star.__call__` insead of `apply_substitution`.

OK, I this is also a better solution. I also added a `union` method, that does the job that `Patch.add` was supposed to do (so that the deprecation warning of `add` is not annoying when `__add__` is used). The method `remove` no longer exists.

Everything is cleaner if we use sets instead of lists, you're right. I submitted a new patch that uses frozenset and made the according changes in the doc and everywhere, which means quite a lot of stuff as you will see in my new patch, which applies over the previous one.

Also, I added an option in `E1Star.__init__`: we can now choose between the 'suffix' or 'prefix' version of the dual substitution. The default one ('suffix') is the one that was used before. Adding this is important because both versions are widely used in the literature. (I also moved `_base_iter` from a method to a direct creation in `__init__`, the gain of time given by ``@`lazy_attribute` was really negligible.)

Hi,

Four things:

I have solved all the doc problems related to the fact that `Patch.__getitem__` doesn't necessarily return the same result from machine to machine. I would like to keep this convenient method (it is used in various other methods and I use it personally for some other tasks). I wrote a WARNING in the doc about this fact.

The `plot_tikz` doctesting problem related to the non-order of `Patch.__iter__` has been solved.

I optimized a little the `plot_tikz` method, by printing a `\definecolor` only when a new color is needed.

Also, I have been more careful about making new Faces when creating new Patches. It is not enough to create new Faces only when `isinstance(other, Patch)` in `Patch.__add__`: for example, if we get a list L of faces that belong to a patch P, and then create the patch Q + L, the faces of L have to be copied, otherwise changing the color of Q will also change some colors of P. I have solved all instances of this potential problem.

Salut Timo,

Excuse-moi pour la dernière semaine, j'aurais dû te répondre avant.

> I have solved all the doc problems related to the fact that `Patch.__getitem__` doesn't necessarily return the same result from machine to machine. I would like to keep this convenient method (it is used in various other methods and I use it personally for some other tasks). I wrote a WARNING in the doc about this fact.


I still have problem with that. By implementing `__getitem__` you kind of tell the user that this is a good method to use. Indeed it is practical to use the square bracquets. The problem is that the method is very slow. It makes a list everytime it is called. Suppose for instance the user use getitem 5 times in a row (which is natural). This will create 5 times the same list. I still believe the method `__getitem__` should be removed. If the user wants to get the 5th element, he will create the list himself and that's it. This is better and avoids misunderstanding of the representation. It is a set. It behaves as a set. And if you want the i-th element of a python set, what do you do? The same thing.

I have another argument. Not only it may affect the doctests depending on the machine as I said earlier. But also, and more importantly, it affects the fiability of the code someone write. I know you know the warning. But such a warning is not natural for the method getitem. Hence, some user will write code, send it to a friend, and it might be broken.

In other words, implement `__getitem__` only if it constant time and of course if its result is guarenteed...

> The `plot_tikz` doctesting problem related to the non-order of `Patch.__iter__` has been solved.


You solved it by just adding ` # not tested ` right? You should add ` # random ` instead so the code will be tested (makes sure no error) but not the result.

> I optimized a little the `plot_tikz` method, by printing a `\definecolor` only when a new color is needed.


OK

> Also, I have been more careful about making new Faces when creating new Patches. It is not enough to create new Faces only when `isinstance(other, Patch)` in `Patch.__add__`: for example, if we get a list L of faces that belong to a patch P, and then create the patch Q + L, the faces of L have to be copied, otherwise changing the color of Q will also change some colors of P. I have solved all instances of this potential problem.


OK. Fine. But now, I think we are doing too much. How many copies of copies do we need to be safe? I think one is enough. For instance, here :

```diff
- return Patch(self._faces.difference(other)) 
+ P = Patch(self) 
+ Q = Patch(other) 
+ return Patch(P._faces.difference(Q)) 
```

The line `return Patch(self._faces.difference(other))` is OK if the copy is always done by the `__init__` method. Note that this is done at least 3 times in the code.

There were indeed too many copies, I changed that.

I uploaded a new version of the last patch.

To get the first element, you can do:

```
sage: S = set(range(10))             
sage: next(iter(S))     # or equivalently: iter(S).next()       
0  
```

To get the i-th element:

```
sage: from itertools import islice   
sage: next(islice(iter(S), 7, None)) 
7                                    
```

I look at your patch and review it soon. Je crois bien qu'on y est maintenant!

Hi, if for some reason the user repaints the returned faces, we don't want it to change the color of the faces in the original Patch.

Otherwise, are you sure about the `next(iter(P))` trick? The other seems faster:

```
sage: a = frozenset(range(10000))
sage: timeit('list(a)[0]')
625 loops, best of 3: 107 µs per loop
sage: timeit('next(iter(a))')
625 loops, best of 3: 607 ns per loop
```

What if the user wants to get the faces of a certain type and does not want to repaint them? We do useless copies in that case. I feel like those methods should return the faces as they are. I think the user may make the copies himself.

It is like if the patch was a Python set. Iterating through it iterates through its elements (not copies of them).

```
sage: f = Face((0,0,0), 1, color='red')      
sage: g = copy(f)                            
sage: g.color()                              
RGB color (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)                    
sage: f.color('black')                       
sage: g.color()                              
RGB color (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)                    
sage: f.color()                              
RGB color (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)                    
```
