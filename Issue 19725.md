# Issue 19725: Remove function sage.rings.real_double.time_alloc

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19962

Original creator: egourgoulhon

Original creation time: 2016-01-26 11:05:26

The docstring of function `sage.rings.real_double.time_alloc` causes random doctest errors, cf. this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/L9SUKEDRs4M/cNu3r_8bBQAJ). Since it does not seem to be used anywhere in sage, this ticket proposes to remove it.
