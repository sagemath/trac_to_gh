I think it would be better to have the comments about the (anecdotal) relative speed of the algorithms in the docstring rather than the code. That way it is easier for the (common) user to see it. Otherwise LGTM.

....: sage: fricas.eval("Z")

Does this mean that there is a leak?

Yes, after `p.coxeter_smith_form(algorithm='fricas')`, the name `Z` has value `Integer` in FriCAS.  By contrast, `x` still returns `x`, which is good.

So, for example, executing after that

```
sage: var("Z")
sage: fricas(Z^2+1)
```
will raise a strange error.
