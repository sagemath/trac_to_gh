I think it would be better to have the comments about the (anecdotal) relative speed of the algorithms in the docstring rather than the code. That way it is easier for the (common) user to see it. Otherwise LGTM.

I cannot try the ticket right now, but I'm afraid that the FriCAS code will leak variables.  Could you try

```
sage: _ = P.coxeter_smith_form(algorithm='fricas')
sage: fricas.eval("Z")
sage: fricas.eval("x")
```


If it does, I can prepare a non-leaking statement.  Roughly, it will be

```
(fricas([x]*n).diagonalMatrix() - fricas(c0)).smith().diagonal().sage()
```

A more fundamental question: why not provide the `algorithm` keyword for matrices in general?

I admit, that I do not know how the matrix design currently works, but possibly `sage.matrix.matrix2.smith_form` is the right place?

....: sage: fricas.eval("Z")

Does this mean that there is a leak?

Yes, after `p.coxeter_smith_form(algorithm='fricas')`, the name `Z` has value `Integer` in FriCAS.  By contrast, `x` still returns `x`, which is good.

So, for example, executing after that

```
sage: var("Z")
sage: fricas(Z^2+1)
```

will raise a strange error.
