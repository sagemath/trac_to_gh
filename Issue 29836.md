Keywords: Laurent series

This works:

```
sage: P.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: P({-3: 1})
x^-3
```

whereas this segfaults:

```
sage: P.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: P({-3: 1})
...
```

I dealt with this by adding a special case to the element constructor to catch a `dict` input.

This fix looks good to me. The only thing I would change is to remove one of the doctests, as the current branch adds the exact same test twice in different places.
