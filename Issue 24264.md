Currently `Integer.__hash__` is implemented with `mpz_pythonhash`, which is designed to return the same hash value for built-in `int` and `long`s.

In Python 3 something changed subtly about the hash algorithm such that this no longer holds:


```
sage: hash(int(2^61))
1
sage: hash(2^61)
2305843009213693952
```


I haven't looked into what the difference is yet.  But I suspect this is the source of a number of errors I've seen.

I see--essentially instead of reduction modulo `ULONG_MAX` it's modulo a prime `_PyHASH_MODULUS`.

Ah, you beat me to it.  I was doing roughly the same thing but with separate Python 2 and 3 branches, so your version is more "generic" I suppose.

I wonder if we an find some way to get away with not having to calculate `modulus` and `limb_bits` every time since they are constant, but it's just some bit shifts and maybe the compiler can optimize that out anyways.

Constant folding is so trivial that it is safe to assume that the compiler knows what to do.
