On cygwin64, atlas compiles if and only if the patch is applied.

However, it is not clear to me why the patch is necessary, since Win64 is a valid target for atlas. Could you explain if this is the right thing, or if this is a hack until some bugs are fixed upstream?

I'm not sure why this is needed.
According to my tests:
* it does not work with Win64 (in fact ATLAS fails to pick a working compiler IIRC...),
* it does with WinNT.
I'm not sure what is involved in ATLAS build system which makes these differences.
I don't really remember if I actually managed to build ATLAS with Win64 used.
I fear I changed that after my successful builds because I just discovered that value and thought "oj this looks nice, let's put this in".

(There are a lot of problems with ATLAS custom build system, I would not want to investigate that one myself.)

OK, then could you add a comment in the code saying that Win64 seems more adequate for Cygwin64, but fails for unknown reasons due to ATLAS build system? It may be helpful in the future if ATLAS improves...
