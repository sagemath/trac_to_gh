Hello !

This code seems good, but I do not understand the three functions lcm,gcd, and now (with your branch) xgcd in element.pyx. Isn't it more reasonable to import them from sage.ring.arith instead ? (a lazy import if that was the problem)

It is especially important to

Cython.

Is this really true? I think Cython is just following the Python convention here...
