Hello! 

- Please refer to the [conventions page](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html) for how to write in ReST markup. For instance, you need a blank line after `::` for getting verbatim environment. Also, please note that, a verbatim environment is preceded by `::`. 

- It'd be nice if you also go ahead and add more doctests. Also, please correct the docstrings formatting whenever you can -- like codifying `self`, `True` and such by using two backticks... 

- Major: "ERROR: Please add a `TestSuite(s).run()` doctest."

Hoping to hear from you soon... 

Cheers, Kannappan.

Hello !

This code seems good, but I do not understand the three functions lcm,gcd, and now (with your branch) xgcd in element.pyx. Isn't it more reasonable to import them from sage.ring.arith instead ? (a lazy import if that was the problem)

xgcd was already there. This branch only changes the doc.

Oh sorry, I made this mistake by reading the diff file.

Okay let's go.

```
It is especially important to
keep this in mind whenever you move a class down from Python to
Cython.
```


Is this really true? I think Cython is just following the Python convention here...

The tests for `gcd`, `lcm` and `xgcd` do not actually test the functions from `element.pyx`.

It's true. Do we create a patch to remove them and import the actual ones ? It's probably only to avoid a direct import.
