Here it is ! I went through all calls to `deprecation()` in Sage, and removed those that are 1yo+ and match tickets whose number is <10000.

To sum it up, it removes deprecated code from :
#3416, #4143, #4260, #4342, #4522, #5058, #5404, #5413, #5460, #5716, #5891, #5945, #6115, #6136, #6500, #6519, #6559, #6670, #7371, #7490, #7748, #8118, #8218, #8429, #8930, #9200, #9265, #9337, #9859

And all of them should be 1yo+.

I did not remove code corresponding to those tickets, because I did not know how or thought something was happening that I didn't understand `:-P`

#7008, #7852, #5930, #4698

And I wrote to sage-combinat abouot #5457 https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-combinat-devel/qCVYu5WOHO8/lb83WIpNeZ8J

Okay, I wasted an evening and a morning trying to remove old codes from Sage, and noticed that some deprecated codes had nothing to be replaced with, that some others had deprecations just in some places because people were too lazy to update the doctests (but that this editing will have to be done if you actually remove the code), and in any case what I learned is that by removing this old code I would just be doing the job that other people left for "anybody else" because they did not want to do it themselves.

And I'm tired of it.

So I just deleted my new branch, and this ticket can go to hell.
