This patch creates the following files and moves into them the methods from `GraphGenerator` that are associated to it in the list at the top of the graph_generators module documentation.

* basic.py
* degree_sequence.py
* families.py
* platonic_solids.py
* random.py
* smallgraphs.py
* world_map.py

This patch passes all tests, but is not clean yet and lacks documentations. Others will follow.

* *HEAVY* rewrite of the fuctions lists at the top of graph_generators. Now the methods are listed in 3xN tables, so that they are easier to browse.
