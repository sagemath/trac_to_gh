Some more typos:

s/it's/its/ ~twice+

s/from the the/around the/ [world]

s/2004/in 2004/

s/Sparc/SPARC/ (?)

I'd add "and peer-review" to "stringent test policy..."

We also need a catchy picture somewhere.

just a small thing, press messages must end with "# # #", that's a standard to signal where it is ending.

Fact: Annual Survey: Windows Port is always the top requested feature.

Some additional Quotes: 

About Virtualization: “A native version on MS Windows is important. Its nonexistence was no problem for me, but it delayed trying it out for a while, since this virtualization-machinery was unknown to me and seemed complex. In the end, everything worked just as described, no problem at all, but it was a mental hurdle to overcome, before even trying it.“ -- Anonymous, Sage Survey 2009

Sage running on Windows is highly anticipated: “Hopefully we can use this as an alternative to Matlab at our company in the future.” - Andrew Trapani, sage-windows mailing list, May 2010

Open-Source Nature of Sage:

“I like the idea of free software. Sage is enough for tecaching math at our univeristy (of forestry and agriculture). In such a case it is immoral to use maple or mathematica and pay for it from university budget.” -- Anonymous, Sage Survey 2009

“Thanks for building something I've always wanted...” -- Anonymous, Sage Survey 2009

Implementation of Features: “3. No units package is a killer for me.” -- Anonymous, Sage Survey 2009

> 1. write as if you are writing a news story. journalists are overworked and want something that is copy/paste ready.
> 
> 2. layout: short and useful header, short introduction (less than 80 words? ... i.e. 1-2 sentences summarizing what's going on). then start with the most important and most catchy part, first line starts with a location and a date. after that, expand into more details, later on a general overview of the project, contact info, related material (press kit website)

I don't know ... I think maybe this should be closed.  Press releases are good, but we just had Sage 5.0 without something like this, Windows support in the way envisioned here seems years (or hours, depending on how talented people are) away, and so forth.

Thoughts?
