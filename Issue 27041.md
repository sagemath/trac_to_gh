Trying to create a constraint from a constraint leads to a segfault.

```
sage: from sage.libs.ppl import *
sage: x=Variable(0)
sage: c = x == 0
sage: type(c)
<class 'sage.libs.ppl.Constraint'>
sage: Constraint(c)
```

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
