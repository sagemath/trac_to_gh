Consider the family of polyhedra P_b given by Ax<=b for A fixed, b varying in a polyhedron Q (which could be the whole space R^m).

Given b, we compute the closure of the set of b' in Q such that P_b' is strongly combinatorially equivalent to P_b. This is a polyhedron.

By "strongly" combinatorially equivalent, do you mean what could be also refered to: "normally equivalent" (i.e. that the two polytopes have the same normal fan)?

This is very cool (and could help clean-up the method `.minkowski_summands`, which I find a bit weird).

So `Q` is what could be called the "type cone" or "deformation cone" and its rays correspond to the indecomposable Minkowski summands of the input polyhedron.

... this would be a GREAT addition to sage. I'll gladly review it and add some references to the docstring.

Changing keywords from "" to "minkowski, polytope, type cone".

See for instance https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07252 for the example of the cube. There are a couple of ways to parametrize this object... In any case: very useful(!).

Yes, this is the same notion.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
