I built Sage 9.2 from source on Ubuntu 18.04 with gcc 7.5 in a Docker container running on an iMac Pro with a Xeon W-2150B processor (Skylake-W).  Inversion of CDF matrices gives bad answers, which I traced down to scipy and finally to OpenBLAS 0.3.9. Attached is a simple script that takes an 18 x 18 matrix of complex numbers, "inverts" it, multiplies by the original, and compares to the identity.  The expected behavior is:


```
sage -python inverse_prob.py
6e-15 # or similar 
```


but on the system in question I get a wildly wrong answer:


```
28.453890763868475
```


The OpenBLAS library was built with Haswell as the target, as its file name is:


```
libopenblas_haswellp-r0.3.9.so
```


Copying a version OpenBLAS built on Sandy Bridge hardware fixes the problem.  On the same physical hardware with the Xeon W-2150B processor, the problem does **not** manifest itself in:

a) macOS 10.15, Python 3.8, scipy 1.5.2 

b) Debian Sid, with official [SageMath](SageMath) 9.2 package.

c) Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04, with the python3-scipy package.

d) Latest Anaconda Docker image.

The failing Docker image in question has been posted as `computop/sage:9.2a1`.

Possibly related to #27961.

I have confirmed that this issue is fixed in the upstream repo:
