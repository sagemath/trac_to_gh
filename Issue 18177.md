FWIW, `sage-download-file` still needs to get fixed w.r.t. filenames including a path, but probably on another ticket.

Actually, the whole interface changed, but the error here was caused by `SAGE_UPSTREAM` no longer being set (removed from `sage-env` by #15642), hence `sage-download-file` didn't get a URL.

Exactly.  But `sage-download-file` doesn't catch that error.

Its not really meant for interactive use, raising an exception is the correct behavior. If you mean that you want a ValueError instead of IOError then feel free to open a ticket.
