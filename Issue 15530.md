Hi Jeroen,

What's the status of this?
Are there still hundreds of failing stuff?
With the forced pushes its not that easy to see how the situtation evolves.
And I've not tested it yet.

Whatsoever, thanks for the hard work.

It's almost ready. The announcement of the PARI-2.7 release candidate gave me a good reason to finish this ticket. Sage doctests found many (10 or so) bugs in PARI, all of which have been fixed upstream.

The forced pushes are the most convenient way to develop this, otherwise I would have 100 commits and several merges in between. I will now look into the remaining doctest failures.

I didn't see any changes in spkg-install in the last commit. Is there any? I am asking because in #16017 we noticed that pari doesn't have the right install_name for OS X.

No, this ticket does not change `spkg-install`. So you should make the changes you propose either on #16017 or on a new ticket.

The problem is that the result is totally wrong.

I have been busy with other things lately, so I haven't looked into this issue.

One gets the correct answer after replacing 19 by 20 in the second line, presumably because this increases the precision by one word.

The parameter `lim1` for Simon's 2-descent program needs to be adjusted (default is 2, minimal value for which a point is found is now apparently 5):

Actually the same can be done much more efficiently using `lim3` instead (with `lim1` it needlessly increases the search bound for quartics that are not everywhere locally soluble):

The other remaining failure on 32-bit (see comment:94) is in the following doctest (in `ell_number_field.py`, introduced in #15483):

```
sage: K.<s> = QuadraticField(229)
sage: c4 = 2173 - 235*(1 - s)/2
sage: c6 = -124369 + 15988*(1 - s)/2
sage: E = EllipticCurve([-c4/48, -c6/864])
sage: E.simon_two_descent()
(0, 0, [])
```
This returns `(1, 1, [])` on 32-bit because a certain quartic is incorrectly determined to be locally soluble at infinity.  It appears to be caused by `polsturm` being called on a polynomial whose precision is too low.  This bug is similar to but different than the one in #15483, and seems somewhat harder to fix.
