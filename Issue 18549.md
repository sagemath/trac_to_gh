This ticket is about enhancing [ticket:18528 SageManifold] toward complex geometry. It deals mainly with implementation of almost-complex structures on real differentiable manifolds.

This ticket only expresses my own point of view on the subject but I hope it will spark a fruitful discussion on the question. Moreover I only deal with mathematics here but any comment related to actual implementation is very welcome.

## Some definitions

### Almost-Complex structure
Let *M* be a real smooth manifold of even dimension *2n* and *TM* be its tangent bundle. An almost-complex structure on *M* is the datum of an anti-idempotent endomorphism of the tangent bundle of *M*. That is : 
* For all point *x* in *M* a ***R***-linear map *J<sub>x</sub> : T<sub>x</sub> M -> T<sub>x</sub> M*
  * *J<sub>x</sub>* depends smoothly on *x*
  * *J<sub>x</sub> J<sub>x</sub> = -Id* where *Id* is the identity endomorphism on *T<sub>x</sub> M*

The manifold *M* together with *J* is called *almost-complex manifold*.

Example : On the tangent space to ***C*** seen as the manifold ***R***<sup>2</sup>, the multiplication by *i = sqrt(-1)* is an almost-complex struture.


```comment
### From Complex Structure
Given a complex manifold ''X'', ''X'' is locally isomorphic to a product of copies of '''''C''''' so there is a natural action of ''i'' on its real tangent space. Asking the change of charts of ''X'' to be holomorphic amounts to the ''i'' gluing together and yielding an almost-complex structure on the real tangent bundle.

Hence complex manifolds yield almost-complex manifolds. The converse is false in general (There is some examples of almost-complex structures on the sphere ''S^6^'' (related to octonions) which comes from no actual complex structure).
```


### What happens to the tangent space ?
Let call *T* the tangent bundle and *T<sup>C</sup>* its complexification (we consider complex linear combinations of tangent vectors to *M*). Then the endomorphism *J* extended to *T<sup>C</sup>* is diagonalisable (with eigenvalues *+/-i*) and induces a splitting
     *T<sup>C</sup> = T<sup>1,0</sup> + T<sup>0,1</sup>*

## Why Hodge structures ?
* Heritage on tensors
* Other use of Hodge structures

## How to encode Hodge structure
* Submodules
* Filtration
* Representation of **S**

To that end, it might also be interesting to establish a connection between complex manifolds and their corresponding real structure.
