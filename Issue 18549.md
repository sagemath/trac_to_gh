This ticket is about enhancing [ticket:18528 SageManifold] toward complex geometry. It deals mainly with implementation of almost-complex structures on real differentiable manifolds.

This ticket only expresses my own point of view on the subject but I hope it will spark a fruitful discussion on the question. Moreover I only deal with mathematics here but any comment related to actual implementation is very welcome.

## Some definitions

### Almost-Complex structure
Let _M_ be a real smooth manifold of even dimension _2n_ and _TM_ be its tangent bundle. An almost-complex structure on _M_ is the datum of an anti-idempotent endomorphism of the tangent bundle of _M_. That is : 
* For all point _x_ in _M_ a *_R*_-linear map _J<sub>x</sub> : T<sub>x</sub> M -> T<sub>x</sub> M_
  * _J<sub>x</sub>_ depends smoothly on _x_
  * _J<sub>x</sub> J<sub>x</sub> = -Id_ where _Id_ is the identity endomorphism on _T<sub>x</sub> M_

The manifold _M_ together with _J_ is called _almost-complex manifold_.

Example : On the tangent space to *_C*_ seen as the manifold *_R*_<sup>2</sup>, the multiplication by _i = sqrt(-1)_ is an almost-complex struture.


```comment
### From Complex Structure
Given a complex manifold _X_, _X_ is locally isomorphic to a product of copies of *_C*_ so there is a natural action of _i_ on its real tangent space. Asking the change of charts of _X_ to be holomorphic amounts to the _i_ gluing together and yielding an almost-complex structure on the real tangent bundle.

Hence complex manifolds yield almost-complex manifolds. The converse is false in general (There is some examples of almost-complex structures on the sphere _S^6^_ (related to octonions) which comes from no actual complex structure).
```


### What happens to the tangent space ?
Let call _T_ the tangent bundle and _T<sup>C</sup>_ its complexification (we consider complex linear combinations of tangent vectors to _M_). Then the endomorphism _J_ extended to _T<sup>C</sup>_ is diagonalisable (with eigenvalues _+/-i_) and induces a splitting
     _T<sup>C</sup> = T<sup>1,0</sup> + T<sup>0,1</sup>_

May I ask what the status on this ticket is?

To that end, it might also be interesting to establish a connection between complex manifolds and their corresponding real structure.
