# Issue 10105: Change "export FC=foo" to "FC=foo ;  export FC" and similar in scipy_sandbox

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10106

Original creator: drkirkby

Original creation time: 2010-10-09 04:16:35

Assignee: GeorgSWeber

CC:  mpatel fbissey

#10092 added 4 lines of code: 


```
export FC="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F77="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F90="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F95="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
```


but using export and the variable name at the same time is not portable. For improved portability, which will work with any shell, 


```
FC="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export FC
F77="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F77
F90="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F90
F95="${SAGE_LOCAL}/bin/sage_fortran"
export F95
```


should work.

The revised package may be found here. I've checked it on my OpenSolaris machine, but also on _fulvia_ where it failed before:
