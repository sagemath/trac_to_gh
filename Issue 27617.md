# Issue 27617: Port cluster_algebra_seed to py3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27854

This ticket fixes the remaining doctest failures in `cluster_algebra_seed`; these were all due to the usual issue with sorting.

There is still a failure, namely

```
File "src/sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/quiver.py", line 1079, in sage.combinat.cluster_algebra_quiver.quiver.ClusterQuiver.frozen_vertices
Failed example:
    Q.frozen_vertices()
Expected:
    ['b', 'd']
Got:
    ['d', 'b']
```

that seems to happen only 50% of the times. Does anyone here know what could this depend on?

ok, thx. Can you please add a sorted in front of the random doctest, and it will be good to go.

Done.

Do you know what causes this?

no idea. Maybe a dictionary somewhere.
