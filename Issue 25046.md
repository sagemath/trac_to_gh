# Issue 25046: Implement left descent and reduced word for colored permutations

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2018-05-03 04:10:24

CC:  sage-combinat andrew.mathas stumpc5 chapoton

Keywords: colored permutations, complex reflection groups

Because they are nice enough groups, we can define an algorithm using left descents (in a certain sense) to compute a reduced word for a colored permutation using the standard generating set.

A nice small patch that's easy to review:) I haven't checked the mathematics but the doc tests do this so I think it's good to go.
