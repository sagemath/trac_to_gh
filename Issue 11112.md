Relating to this: Where is default pink color defined? For example


```
G=DiGraph({0:[1]})
G.show(vertex_colors='pink')
G.show(vertex_colors={'#ff00ff':[0]})
```


shows kind of a bug: color of element 1 changes from pink to blue when setting color of 0 to red.

Examples to `show()` could be something like


```
P.show(vertex_colors={'red':P.maximal_elements()})
```


or


```
for c in P.maximal_chains():
    P.show(vertex_colors={'red':c})
```


Where P would be suitable poset.

I still don't see how the user can find `figsize`-option. And IMO it is one of most important --- it is good to make smaller with poset of ~7 elements, almost necessary to make bigger with poset of 15 elements.

`cover_labels` put labels over the line, not near the line --- but this is place for another ticket.

Maybe `element_labels` could have explanation saying that it must be injective. And that `cover_labels` may be non-injective.

Hmm... how about some nice example of colors? Poset with top element and color by mÃ¶bius function from top to element? Or a lattice where deleting some elements would make it non-lattice and those drawn as red? But there is no easy way to make graphics in documentation, so maybe no.

Yo !

True. Actually, it can be found in the doc of Poset.show which mentions the doc of Graphics.show, where it appears. Not exactly as trivial as it should.

> `cover_labels` put labels over the line, not near the line --- but this is place for another ticket.

For this kind of stuff, I would say that people will try and see for themselves. The drawing is better than a long explanation `:-P`

Of changing the code to support non-injective labellings ! That is the most proper way to solve it.

?? `P._hasse_diagram.show?` does not show it. I think that user must do at least two jumps to find it.

Oops right sorry `:-D`

In this case, however, you should also see a mention of `Graphics.show`:
