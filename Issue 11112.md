# Issue 11112: Document all options of Poset.show and Poset.plot

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11284

Original creator: nthiery

Original creation time: 2011-05-03 18:38:16

Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: posets, documentation

The documentation of the plot method of Posets does not document all options.

Changing keywords from "posets, documentation" to "posets, documentation,days30".

Relating to this: Where is default pink color defined? For example


```
G=DiGraph({0:[1]})
G.show(vertex_colors='pink')
G.show(vertex_colors={'#ff00ff':[0]})
```


shows kind of a bug: color of element 1 changes from pink to blue when setting color of 0 to red.

Examples to `show()` could be something like


```
P.show(vertex_colors={'red':P.maximal_elements()})
```


or


```
for c in P.maximal_chains():
    P.show(vertex_colors={'red':c})
```


Where P would be suitable poset.

Comment fron ncohen on #17477: "The problem comes from `HasseDiagram.plot`. This argument [i.e. `label_font_size`], and two others, are totally ignored. Also, it seems that this `HasseDiagram.plot` function is never used: `Poset.plot` calls `GenericGraph.plot` directly."

Docstring "Displays the Hasse diagram of the poset." should be "Display the Hasse diagram of the poset." according to PEP whose number I don't remember.

Okay. Well, if this is the only comment you have to make to give this patch a positive review I will add a commit, otherwise I will do it along with the other remarks if you do not mind `:-P`

I still don't see how the user can find `figsize`-option. And IMO it is one of most important --- it is good to make smaller with poset of ~7 elements, almost necessary to make bigger with poset of 15 elements.

`cover_labels` put labels over the line, not near the line --- but this is place for another ticket.

Maybe `element_labels` could have explanation saying that it must be injective. And that `cover_labels` may be non-injective.

Hmm... how about some nice example of colors? Poset with top element and color by möbius function from top to element? Or a lattice where deleting some elements would make it non-lattice and those drawn as red? But there is no easy way to make graphics in documentation, so maybe no.

Thinking... Any opinions from others?

Yo !

True. Actually, it can be found in the doc of Poset.show which mentions the doc of Graphics.show, where it appears. Not exactly as trivial as it should.

> `cover_labels` put labels over the line, not near the line --- but this is place for another ticket.

For this kind of stuff, I would say that people will try and see for themselves. The drawing is better than a long explanation `:-P`

Of changing the code to support non-injective labellings ! That is the most proper way to solve it.

You can still add an example, even if the code figure does not appear... It may change someday `:-)`

?? `P._hasse_diagram.show?` does not show it. I think that user must do at least two jumps to find it.

Of course.

Nonono, not `P._hasse_diagram.show`. This function does not even exist anymore when this branch is applied. I was talking of `P.show?` after this branch is applied. Though it is easier to read if you browse it through the html pages.

It does, because Hasse diagram is `DiGraph`. Just like for example `P._hasse_diagram.is_connected()` is available.

But in any case, you are right. I was looking `Graph.show?`, not `Graphics.show?`.

You can mark this as positive review if you want. If not, I'll get back to this on monday and think about adding some examples.

Yoooooo !

Oops right sorry `:-D`

In this case, however, you should also see a mention of `Graphics.show`:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/generic_graph.html#sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.show

Works for me, thanks !

No more comments for now because of #17498. Maybe I'll get back to this after it has been applied.
