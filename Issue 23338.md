# Issue 23338: Geometric Frobenius is broken

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: roed

Original creation time: 2017-08-02 21:30:59

#12657 introduced an error in the computation of the geometric Frobenius, uncaught since there are no doctests for geometric Frobenius.

The dependency on #14825 comes from resolving a merge conflict there.

Would it be possible to add an example to the ticket illustrating the error?
