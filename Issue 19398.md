A few minors things and a few larger things. I think before I do functionality testing some of these coding improvements should be made.

Minor
- You are changing the example in the ring class to give a field point. Perhaps you should change the ring instead of the output so that it is still a ring example

```
- <class 'sage.schemes.product_projective.point.ProductProjectiveSpaces_point_ring'>
+ <class 'sage.schemes.product_projective.point.ProductProjectiveSpaces_point_field'>
```
- no ending punctuation on errors
- in both of your brute force point searches you don't need the intermediate variable. You can just have:

```
for P in X.ambient_space().rational_points():
```
- remove references to self in doc strings. Instead say things like, this point, or this space.
- there are a number of spacing issues
  - between lists of polys, such as [x<sup>2-y</sup>2, z<sup>2-2*w</sup>2]
  - between function parameters, such as X.affine_patch(I, True)
  - between coordinates of points
- references need an underscore, [Doyle-Krumm]_

points function
- you should mention that this is computing all points for dimension 0 schemes regardless of base ring.
- output: should be "all points with height at most the bound are returned"
- you might need to .sort() your doctests so that they don't depend on the machine


Major
-  with 7.1.beta1 there is a depracation in one of the function you use which causes a number of doctest failures, you should update to the new function.

```
sage -t --warn-long 56.2 schemes/generic/algebraic_scheme.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.2 schemes/product_projective/wehlerK3.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.2 schemes/projective/projective_space.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.2 schemes/product_projective/space.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.2 schemes/product_projective/morphism.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.2 schemes/product_projective/point.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --warn-long 56.2 schemes/product_projective/homset.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

points function
- your dimension check doesn't actually work in all cases. I'd recommend using #19991 as a dependency and switching to that dimension call.
- You seem to be going to a lot of trouble to generate possible indices for affine patches. Here is something shorter

```
dims = [n+1 for n in X.ambient_space().dimension_relative_components()]
for I in xmrange(dims):
```

You should be able to improve the indices creator in points_of_bounded_height and rational_points as well

- You are returning points in the ambient space instead of the scheme. You should just have

```
points.add(phi(PP))
```
- hash() - for field, finite_field are exactly the same as for ring. So you don't need these functions as they will inherit, but add their examples to ring.

- The example changes in SchemeMorphism_polynomial_projective_space_field. why did they change? Are these are sorting problem? 

- in rationalpoints()
I don't like that you are generating all the points in all the projective spaces and then generating all possible indices. We can do this more memory efficiently; something like:

```
P = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,1,1,2],GF(2))
iters = [ iter(T) for T in P ]
L=[]
for x in iters:
    L.append(next(x)) # put at zero
points=[P(L)]
j = 0
while j < P.num_components():
    try:
        L[j] = next(iters[j])
        points.append(copy(P(L)))
        j = 0
    except StopIteration:
        iters[j] = iter(P[j])  # reset
        L[j] = next(iters[j]) # put at zero
        j += 1
```

speaking of which. I'd like to see this as an _iter_ function in addition to a rational_points function.

The need to use copy() in the iterator was bothering me and this seems to be a more endemic problem. If you initialize a point with a list of points and change an element of that list, it changes the point. This does not seem like desired behavior as it does not behave like that for regular projective points.

```
P=ProjectiveSpace(1,QQ,'x')
P2=ProjectiveSpace(1,QQ,'y')
PP=P2.cartesian_product(P)
Q=P(1,1)
Q2=P2(0,1)
M=[Q2,Q]
QQ=PP(M);print QQ
M[0]=P2([1,1]);print QQ
```

Consequently, I think the copy needs to be somewhere in _init_

Okay I think I addressed the issues from the review and this should be ready for another look-over.

I added an `__iter__` function for product spaces over finite fields making them iterable, but this broke a line in the dimension function for products in `algebraic_scheme.py`. In particular something like `for PS in PP` will now yield points instead of the component spaces of PP.

I'm not exactly sure why the output of some of the projective morphism examples got rearranged, but it definitely happened when I changed the hash function. I think it might be related to the use of `set()`.

I also tried to address the copy issue for the `__iter__` and `rational_points` functions. Just adding `polys = copy(polys)` to the first line of the `__init__` function for points of products of projective spaces seems to fix the issue. However, I think a list of projective space points is just a list of references to the actual point objects, so applying copy to such a list just copies the references but not the objects themselves. So this fix does not protect against modification of the original objects:

```
P1=ProjectiveSpace(1,QQ,'x')
P2=ProjectiveSpace(1,QQ,'y')
PP=P1.cartesian_product(P2)
Q1=P1(0,1)
Q2=P2(1,1)
M=[Q1,Q2]
pt=PP(M)
print pt
M[0]._coords[0] = 1
print pt
```

Also, copy for projective space points seems to be too shallow:

```
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
pt1 = P(1,2,3)
pt2 = copy(pt1)
print pt2
pt1._coords[0] = 7
print pt2
```

I'm not sure whether this really is an issue, but if it is, maybe we could override `__copy__` for projective points.

```

Much improved. Still a couple things.

1) I agree that _copy_ is not a fault of your code. This is a more general schemes issue

```
E=EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,1])
T=E(0,1)
S=copy(T)
T._coords[1]=-1
T,S
((0 : -1 : 1), (0 : -1 : 1))
```
What you are doing is in line with everything else, so will be resolved when the more general generic/point copy is resolved.

2) hmmm...yes, a natural consequence of the point iterator is that iterating over the components with that simple loop no longer works. However, I think it is import to preserve a way to iterate over the components without resorting to accessing private data with ._components. I suggest a simple PP.components() function that returns ._components.

3) This documentation for rational_points() does not look right

```
rational points on the affine space of this space
```

4) base extension for rational_points() doesn't seem to work

```
PP.<u,v,s,t> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,1],QQ)
X = PP.subscheme([u^3-v^3, s^2-t^2,])
X.dimension()
X.rational_points(bound=2,F= CyclotomicField(3,'z'))
```
versus

```
PP.<u,v,s,t> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,1], CyclotomicField(3,'z'))
X = PP.subscheme([u^3-v^3, s^2-t^2,])
X.dimension()
X.rational_points()
```
or the same for QQbar...

5) shouldn't this work too

```
PP.<u,v,s,t> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,1],GF(3))
X = PP.subscheme([u^3-v^3, s^2-t^2,])
X.dimension()
X.rational_points()
```
or

```
PP.<u,v,s,t> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,1],GF(3))
X = PP.subscheme([u^3-v^3, s^2-t^2,])
X.dimension()
X.rational_points(F=GF(9,'z'))
```

The coercion problem comes up in the example

```
PP.<u,v,s,t> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,1],GF(3))
X = PP.subscheme([u^3-v^3, s^2-t^2,])
X.dimension()
X.rational_points()
```

when using the affine morphisms corresponding to the affine patches used for finding points. In particular, a rational number list shows up when evaluating one of the affine morphisms at the rational points from the corresponding patch. The following traces some of the code in `rational_points` for the above example to capture when the list shows up:

```
PP.<u,v,s,t> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,1],GF(3))
X = PP.subscheme([u^3-v^3, s^2-t^2,])
X = X(GF(3)).codomain()
[Y,phi] = X.affine_patch([0,0], True)
x = Y.rational_points()[0]
# expanding out what happens in phi(x):
print [x._coords[i].parent() for i in range(len(x._coords))] # coordinates are finite field elements
P = phi._fast_eval(x._coords)
print [P[i].parent() for i in range(len(P))] # resulting coordinates are rational field elements
print phi.codomain().point(P, True) # this then breaks without the coercion implemented in last commit
```

Adding the coercion got around the issue, but I'm not sure why `_fast_eval` gives a list of rational numbers here.
