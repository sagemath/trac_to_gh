# Issue 2951: checkbox is not defined in interact

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mhampton

Original creation time: 2008-04-18 11:37:03

Assignee: boothby

Keywords: interact, notebook, checkbox

The checkbox function/class is never actually defined in interact.py; all the examples I can find use the shorthand method of constructing one.  To match the documentation and provide full options this should be added.

Works for me, looks good.  Passes all tests. Not much more to say: positive review.
