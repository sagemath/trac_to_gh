Apparently a code of conduct for the Sage community was adopted in 2014
- Code of Conduct
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/iGxa2F01rFc/m/Y4MMse3MDDsJ
- VOTE: code of conduct - ends Monday at midnight, PST.
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/dR3_eyIUyac/m/sh2JdCEkv3IJ
- IMHO having "sage-abuse" publicly readable is a bad idea
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/joG6eg56k8A/m/i_sReCt7bdkJ
- Publication of code of conduct?
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/luSvYAcCDn0/m/EFyRYnXLp0cJ
- When/by who/how was the "code of conduct" initiated ?
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/voyJJG2qNTE/m/9zjGkg-345AJ
- proposed amendment to code of conduct
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/Zeyin-3-gjg/m/JeoDktcaqokJ
- The "code of conduct" is getting out of hand - please stop for 2 weeks.
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/-jHyUXFY1Zw/m/Wr-DaqO1nDUJ
- mailing list administration
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/EAngC-bmZWY/m/gVW7GD2bBQAJ
A later related discussion:
- sage foundation ???
  https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/sGFOYBeEq-Q/m/0kUY7s9BDAAJ

It is published only on the Sage wiki on a rather confusing page:
- https://wiki.sagemath.org/Community?action=show&redirect=CodeOfConduct

In this ticket, we add it to the main repo as the file `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to match the standard practices in the open source world.

I'm not sure what version of the code of conduct should be added. There are several on the page â€‹https://wiki.sagemath.org/Community?action=show&redirect=CodeOfConduct.

From what I gathered from the Google Groups discussions, the "Code of Conduct as voted on ending November 24, 2014" was approved. The rest are loose ends of proposed changes

Does anyone know if `sage-abuse`@`googlegroups.com` has actually been created and is attended?

There seems to be a group with this name (https://groups.google.com/g/sage-abuse), but I don't have access to it.

John, I've made you a google group owner of sage-abuse.

Thank you. So now I can confirm that it exists, and the posts are completely relevant and appropriate. It also has had very little traffic: two threads over the years, most recent post from November '17.

That's a good sign, hopefully, regarding our community...
