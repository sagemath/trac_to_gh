Removing a comment is ok but removing a doctest is not.

There is this test repeated by the patch from #940 later on in the file.

The other doctest is not exactly the same; it is missing the line

```
sage: a = octave.eval(t + ';') 
```

And what exactly is this line testing? That eval works? Isn't it tested by eval itself? In the removed version it is claimed that it works fine, but presumably the other one was taking too much. My understanding is that the problem of #940 was gone and there is a test for it with the reference to that ticket. So I think there should not be a block in the module docstring that specifically says that there is a problem and #940 has to be fixed.
