May I suggest instead of 


```
190	    Finally, if the class implement the ``_hash_`` method then 
191	    :class:`ClonableElement` ensure that hash value is only computed on 
192	    immutable object. It furthermore cache it so that it is only computed 
193	    once. 
```


use


```
190	    Finally, if the class implements the ``_hash_`` method then 
191	    :class:`ClonableElement` ensures that hash value is only computed on an
192	    immutable object. It furthermore caches it so that it is only computed 
193	    once. 
```


Suggested changes:

line 190: *implements*

line 191: *ensures* and *on an*

line 192: *caches*

Done. Thanks for the report! Btw, I fixed a missing s on another ``implements'' above.

Btw: Florent: I was sure I had written a reviewer's patch on that one, but don't find a trace of it. Did I dream, or did you already merge it?

Mariah, please check my change! Otherwise, for me, it's good to go.

line 191: :class:`ClonableElement` ensures that the hash value can only *be*

line 192: computed on an immutable object. It furthermore caches it so that

Apologies for being picky!

As I remember we looked on it side by side looking on my computer, but I don't remember any patch. Also there isn't any trace of it in the log.

By the way, thanks for the review. 

Also please make sure not to break `trac_11407-list_clone_improve-fh.patch` in the queue. If reject happen, feel free to refresh the patch.
