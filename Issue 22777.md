# Issue 22777: Use maximal vector in the local energy function

Keywords: crystals

Currently, projected level-zero LS paths from a single fundamental weight, which is in the category of KR crystals, does not work with the local energy function. This is because it does not define a `module_generator` method.

We also add a generic `module_generator` method that redirects to `maximal_vector` for consistency.
