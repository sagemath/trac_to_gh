The method `subfield` on number field creates a subfield generated by a single element. We implement a different `subfield_from_elements` which produces a subfield from a list of elements with the two differences that
- it allows a list of elements instead of a single one as argument
- it tries to minimize the minimal polynomial of the generator via PARI polred

The name was choosen by analogy with `sage.rings.qqbar.number_field_elements_from_algebraics`.
