Something to note is that each of the examples are meant to be minimal.

Specifically I made the general `LieAlgebras` example be the algebra generated by a set of elements in order to avoid not having to worry about if the associative algebra does not have a good basis method. However this is easy enough to change if you feel strongly about it. Same for the `WithBasis` example.

Also, should I keep removing unused imports found by pyflakes, or do they become necessary in further patches? e.g.:

I don't like stating that it is unindexed; in fact, it is typically indexed by `[n]`.

In that vein, I don't quite care for saying it is a column vector. Also I'd rather say that we pick an ordering of some basis if it exists, rather than saying if there exists one.

The reason I had an abstract method `module` in `LieAlgebras` was to say it was natural, but it was made optional for what I hope are obvious reasons.
