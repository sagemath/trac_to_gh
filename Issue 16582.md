Part of #14901. This implements a basic version of the categories:

- Lie algebras
  - With basis
  - Finite dimensional

and examples for each.

Something to note is that each of the examples are meant to be minimal.

Specifically I made the general `LieAlgebras` example be the algebra generated by a set of elements in order to avoid not having to worry about if the associative algebra does not have a good basis method. However this is easy enough to change if you feel strongly about it. Same for the `WithBasis` example.

On the other hand, I would expect to see the whole associative algebra implemented in a visible place. Is this in one of the followup tickets?

The reason I had an abstract method `module` in `LieAlgebras` was to say it was natural, but it was made optional for what I hope are obvious reasons.
