# Issue 10625: properly link "derivative" in sage.symbolic.expression.derivative documentation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: ddrake

Original creation time: 2011-01-24 02:41:03

Assignee: mvngu

Currently, the documentation for the derivative method of symbolic functions says "see documentation for the global derivative() function for more details", with no hyperlink on the derivative. The attached patch fixes that.

While we're at it, mention that `.derivative()` is smart for functions of a single variable -- you don't need to supply it.

Changing keywords from "" to "symbolic derivative".

Hmm, I'm not sure about doing this.  I know you said that elsewhere as well.  The problem is that the people (Burcin) who implemented the new stuff are strongly against implied variables.   Try the same stuff with `f = x^3 + sin(x)` and it still works... but I seem to recall that they weren't hot to keep it that way.  I have no idea where to look for evidence of this, of course.  But putting 'needs info' until that's resolved.

I think that will take too long. Let's forget about that and only use attachment:trac_10678.patch. Let's review that and use it.

Patchbot: apply trac_10678.2.patch

Patch looks good and all tests pass when applied to 5.1.beta0. Positive review.

I checked 

```
sage -docbuild --warn-links reference html
```

and fixed a few things from that, especially just by adding things to the reference manual.  There are two "pickle" ones that won't be fixed, but I can't do anything about those because that file is not ready for the reference manual.

Reviewed the new reviewer patch, I reaffirm my previous positive review.

There are a few warnings when building the reference manual (`:method:` should be `:meth:`):

```
dochtml.log:docstring of sage.symbolic.function.Function:3: ERROR: Unknown interpreted text role "method".
dochtml.log:docstring of sage.symbolic.function.Function:3: ERROR: Unknown interpreted text role "method".
dochtml.log:docstring of sage.symbolic.function.Function:3: ERROR: Unknown interpreted text role "method".
```


Also, it would be nice to make the heading of `sage/sumbolic/function.py` consistent with [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files)

I fixed the `:method:` stuff. I think we'll leave the heading for later.

Looks good. I re-re-affirm my earlier positive review.
