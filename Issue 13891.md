During Sara Billey's talk, it came up that not all of the Weyl group functionalities are available for the symmetric group:

- The symmetric group does not implement CartanType
- The Stanley symmetric function code uses the old fashionned W.unit() rather than W.one(). There might be some other occurences that should be cleaned up

Test case:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: w = G.from_reduced_word([3,2,3,1])
sage: w.stanley_symmetric_function()
3*m[1, 1, 1, 1] + 2*m[2, 1, 1] + m[2, 2] + m[3, 1]
```

Here is a git branch that

2) transforms a few `W.unit()` into `W.one()`

Looks good overall. I've caught one more `unit` in the category `AffineWeylGroups`. I've also marked some tests as `# long time` in `permgroup_named.py` since basic testing of that file was taking forever. Plus I've done some other tweaks to that file (gawd that file needs cleanup though). So if you're happy with my changes then positive review.
