Keywords: polynomial, squarefree

Refactor `squarefree_decomposition()` of univariate polynomials to call `_squarefree_decomposition_univariate()` of the base ring. This makes it easier to have different algorithms in different rings.

This will make it easier to implement square-free decomposition over perfect fields and separably generated extensions of perfect fields.
