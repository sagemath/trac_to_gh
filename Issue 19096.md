# Issue 19096: RIF roots are sometimes too precise

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19333

The root finder in `RIF` sometimes returns roots which have too much precision:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: parent((x-1).roots(RIF)[0][0])
Real Interval Field with 106 bits of precision
```

The answer should have 53 bits of precision.

Feature, not a bug.
