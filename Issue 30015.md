This seems to work, but I guess I am left wondering whether the same cannot be achieved with less cut&paste - perhaps using `SubcategoryMethods` or something like this?

The problem is that you might have a subcategory `C` of modules whose tensor products are not also an object in `C`. Probably the better way to do this is subclass `TensorProductsCategory` since this is such a common thing. You can either do that here or postpone that to a later ticket.

One doctest to fix:

```
File "src/sage/tensor/modules/tensor_free_module.py", line 128, in sage.tensor.modules.tensor_free_module.TensorFreeModule
Failed example:
    T.category()
Expected:
    Category of tensor products of finite dimensional modules over Integer Ring
Got:
    Category of finite dimensional modules over Integer Ring
```

One done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

... like `FiniteDimensionalTensorProductsCategory`, or what do you have in mind there?

More like `TensorProductsAsBaseCategory` or `TensorProductsCategoryWithBaseCategory`, which has the base category as part of its `default_super_categories`. Or perhaps something like this as a functorial construction category inbetween the covariant and covariant regressive?

Ah I see, let me think about it.

I am slightly worried with the fact the category could be used for an infinite tensor product (something that quite often occurs in my area of mathematics). However, this is a slight abuse (read: hidden assumption) that we do in other parts of Sage, I will give this a positive review. At some point, we might have to revisit this with a more specific solution (i.e., in CFM and other specific tensor product implementations), but I don't think right now this causes any issues.

Thank you!

Great point about the infinite tensor products, but certainly the implementation of `CovariantFunctorialConstruction` only works in the finitary case.
