The choices are not strongly motivated.

* I used `sage -startuptime modulename` to track dependencies between modules involving combinat.

* I changed some imports to lazy, until some modules are no longer imported.

* Some changes failed (abstract_trees, binary_trees, sloane) so I undid them.

Okay, thanks. I am still split on the `q_analogues.py` and the symmetric functions. I guess there is not really a penalty for making them lazily imported.

Most likely some of the others failed because they were imported by something else done at startup.

Also, I believe the `partition_algebra.py` is ultimately destined to be removed since the things in `diagram_algebras.py` has superseded it.
