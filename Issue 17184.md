Currently, the list of all modules to be included in the Sage reference manual needs to be maintained by hand. This is tedious, and modules often end up accidently missing in those lists. Besides, maintaining thoses lists is a common source of trivial but annoying conflicts.

#16256 includes a first step toward automatizing the process in the context of sage.combinat (see src/doc/en/reference/combinat/module_list.rst. The purpose of this ticket is to finish the automatizing. This requires some Sphinx configuration / programming.
