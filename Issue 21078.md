Keywords: linear code, beginner, sd75

The "relative distance" of a linear code is `d/n`, where `d` is the minimum distance and `n` the length of the code. This is a quite useful number that some coding theorists use. This should be available for any linear code in Sage. 

Note that it should be implemented on the class AbstractLinearCode to be available to both LinearCode and specific families of codes such as GeneralizedReedSolomonCode or HammingCode.

I implemented the method `relative_distance`. Now opened for review.

Works good. Tried several codes. Timing depends on minimum_distance.
