I think we should wait and give upstream some time to respond, at least until python-3.10 is released and available in mainstream distros. Otherwise we will end up supporting python-3.10 only via patches and rejecting system packages on distros that don't have the unofficial patches.

.. yet. One of the obstacles standing in our way (although not a problem unique to python packages) is custom patching.

If we have to patch, we can patch; it just seems a little early for the nuclear option.

Frankly it's pretty unrealistic for the Sage distribution to support it any time soon. I've sketched the best approach in #29023 and it's pretty complicated.

> One of the obstacles standing in our way (although not a problem unique to python packages) is custom patching.

I agree (see #31543) that the Sage *library* should not depend on custom patched Python packages.

But this cannot stop us to fix the Sage *distribution* so that it does not run into build problems. Note in particular that this build problem (of a standard package!) stops developers from actually testing Python 3.10 and therefore blocks necessary progress in our library. 

If it helps, think of the Sage *distribution* as a reference environment for developers. 

> If we have to patch, we can patch; it just seems a little early for the nuclear option.

That's a little dramatic. To stay within your metaphor, we already have dozens of nuclear plants running -- adding another one technically is to take the "nuclear option" but lacks the drama that this turn of phrase is meant to invoke.

cvxopt's upstream is very, very slow at times.
