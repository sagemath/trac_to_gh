This may have been fixed - either in Docker or the distributions - for example `ubuntu-hirsute-standard` succeeded in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/runs/2051745189?check_suite_focus=true

This problem has gone away by itself on GH Actions, but I ran into it again on a local run using `tox -e docker-fedora-34-maximal`.
