I just ran into this issue as well (see https://travis-ci.org/koffie/mdsage/jobs/374406653). It is good to see it is fixed. However it does make me wonder how it was possible that this problem got silently into sage-8.1? Is there no test somewhere that the sphinx-build script we ship is actually working? Looking at the code here it seems also that no such test was added, should there be one?
