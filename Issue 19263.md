All these should be `ValueError`:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', 3, order='lex(3),degrevlex(0)')
...
AssertionError
```

```
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', 3, order='lex(3),degrevlex(1)')
...
TypeError: Term order length does not match the number of generators
```

```
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', 3, order='foo')
...
TypeError: Unknown term order 'foo'
```

This looks good. My sole comment is whether one could also have an improvement for the following error message:

```python
sage: T = TermOrder("deglex(3),lex(2)")
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 4, 'x', order=T)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: TermOrder copy constructor called with different number of variables (4) than input term order (5).
```

It would be more meaningful to get an error message along the lines of

```
ValueError: the length of the term order (5) is different from the number of variables (5).
```
