HELP HELP HELP

The pyflakes test raises a serious issue I don't know how to fix: method `subgraphs_to_data` is missing!!! I'm not sure what it should be. Help is more than welcome :P

This was a problem before this ticket and your changes do not change the situation, so the pyflakes error does not matter in this case.
