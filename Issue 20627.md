Part of the proposed changes in #812, which were reverted in the end, was to change the caching of the function `E.modular_symbol()`. The keyword `use_eclib` should be changed to `implementation` as we expect other implementations, e.g. pari, to be added in the future

Changing keywords from "" to "modular symbols".

In `_modular_symbol_normalize` (located in `ell_rational_field.py`) checks for sign being +1 or -1 and for normalize being one of the allowed values should be added.

Otherwise, the code looks fine and the tests pass. I will give it a positive review once the above checks are added.

Ok, i changed that. It was not really necessary as these conditions are checked in the class they call, but it does not harm including them.

I have fixed one typo in the docstring for `pollack_stevens_modular_symbol`. I am giving a positive review also, as promised.
