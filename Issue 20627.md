Part of the proposed changes in #812, which were reverted in the end, was to change the caching of the function `E.modular_symbol()`. The keyword `use_eclib` should be changed to `implementation` as we expect other implementations, e.g. pari, to be added in the future

In `_modular_symbol_normalize` (located in `ell_rational_field.py`) checks for sign being +1 or -1 and for normalize being one of the allowed values should be added.

Otherwise, the code looks fine and the tests pass. I will give it a positive review once the above checks are added.
