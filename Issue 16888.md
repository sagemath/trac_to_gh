I've briefly looked over the branch changes but haven't tried out your code yet.  I'm always intimidated by your patches because they are never minor.  :) This looks good though.

Before even testing anything, the GR symmetric functions and the CSW quasi-symmetric functions need INPUT: OUTPUT: sections in the documentation.

I kind of found it strange that you put in the functionality to compute `h.gessel_reutenauer(n)` with `n` an integer when it is more generally defined for `h.gessel_reutenauer(lam)` and the integer ones aren't the generators of the elements.  Maybe there is a reason to consider this sequence though.

Thanks, I spent so long without programming that I forgot about these conventions.

Why an extra syntax for the one-row partitions? Just because they're defined first in Gessel-Reutenauer (they are also characters of the free Lie algebra as S_n-representations, I believe).

I somewhat feel that this can muddy things because you really want partitions. Although if you do want the extra semantic (I don't have a strong opinion), then I think you should just check `if lam in ZZ:`.

Thanks, I forgot about the right way to get these standard rings too.

I thought people would want a simpler syntax for the simple cases. I am fine with or without it just as much.
