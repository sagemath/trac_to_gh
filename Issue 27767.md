Note that the self-tests pass too, as well as some randomly chosen examples from the doc run by hand (see http://vaucanson-project.org/Awali/index.html).

I confirm that `sage -f -c awali` works and I tested few examples from the doc with success.

Not in Sage 8.8.  Let's please to try keep tickets' milestones related to the release in which we actually intend to include them, and in particular the release in which they were _actually_ included, especially when closing tickets.
