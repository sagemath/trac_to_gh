And it is now officially released. I am ready to put this to positive review once we have a tarball.

The testsuite fails on 32-bit for the record: http://trac.cython.org/ticket/857

Reopening as it fails on some buildbots with `error: reference to ‘uint64_t’ is ambiguous`. I asked at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cython-users/nOaoFjt8BLo/RI3vtsOMDwAJ for advice.

Regardless of how the cython list answers we should get rid of the global using namespace statements.

I think it is a good idea but I cannot check the impact on a 32bit platform.


---

This shouldn't have any impact on 32-bit platforms, it just avoids kneecapping the compilation unit from the get-go.

In the meantime more stuff without namespace appeared...


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2015-08-23 02:45:54

Marginally related in a way. Should we have a separate audit of namespace and include a bit about them in the review section of the documentation?


---

Really we should put C++ Sage stuff into a `sage` namespace, then its safe to pull symbols in via using declarations

```
namespace sage {
    namespace graph {
        using std::vector;
        using boost:make_iterator_property_map;
        [...]
    }
}
```

hum... Definitely need the namespace(s), that's just asking to be clobbered.

Hello!

Thank you very much for telling me that `using namespace` is bad practice, and for correcting my code in `boost_interface.cpp`.

However, I have used vectors also in Cython, in files `boost_graph.pyx` and `boost_graph.pxd`, and I haven't used namespaces (for instance, by writing `vector` and not `std::vector`). Is it fine? Otherwise, what is the correct way to do it?

Best,

Michele

In Python its ok to import into the module namespace "from libcpp.vector cimport vector". Since there are no `#include` statements this will not cause conflicts in third-party headers. Its only in C++ that

```
using namespace foo;
#include <bar>
```

will then make bar see all of foo's symbols (and potentially trip over some).

Actuall in Cython you have pxi files which behave like #include, but you shouldn't use them if you can avoid it; they are mostly for historical reasons.
