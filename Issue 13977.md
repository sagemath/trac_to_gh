Assignee: mhampton

CC:  sage-combinat

With this patch, one can do:

```
sage: square_from_vertices = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, 1], [-1, -1]])
sage: square_from_vertices.plot()
sage: square_from_vertices.plot(outline=False)
```

In the later case, only the two-dimensional piece of the polyhedron is drawn, and not its outline: vertices and edges.

This patch only handles for non projected polyhedron plots. But that's all we need for #4327 :-)

You can, in principle, only drawn projections in 2 or 3 dimensions. There is no such thing as "drawing a non-projected polyhedron".

If you want to implement your own plotting style then you should create the projection and use the methods of the `Projection` object directly.

I guess there is a misunderstanding here:-)

This ticket is just about drawing *without outline* Polyhedrons living in a dimension 2 ambient space. This is all I need for #4327.

If I mentionned projections that's just because, if someone would want the same feature for a Polyhedron that has been projected in dimension 2, then this is not yet handled by this patch.

I think I understand what you want, but it is at odds with the strict separation of polyhedron and its projection that I very much would like to keep in the code. 

Having more control about the plot output is definitely desirable, but I find `outline` as a keyword very confusing. `X.plot(outline=True)` sounds like it ought to plot **only** the outline of `X`, but thats not what you propose.

If you just want to draw a polygon you only need

```
sage: P = Polyhedron([(0,0),(1,0),(0,1)])
sage: polygon2d(P.vertices())
```

How about we let the user specify three dictionaries

P.plot(point={color='red'}, line={...}, polygon={...})

Not quite: if P is a polyhedron of dimension 1 in an ambient space of dimension 2, then I want it to be drawn as a line (no points, no polygon). Similarly, if P is a point, I want it to be drawn as a point (no line, no polygon). See the examples in the patch.

I agree that the name "outline" is not good. What I really mean is "draw only the piece of the same dimension as P", but I did not manage to get a good name for that. Suggestions?

Thanks for the brainstorming :-)
