# Issue 13977: Add outline=False option for rendering 2d polyhedron plots

Issue created by migration from Trac.

With this patch, one can do:

```
sage: square_from_vertices = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, 1], [-1, -1]])
sage: square_from_vertices.plot()
sage: square_from_vertices.plot(outline=False)
```

In the later case, only the two-dimensional piece of the polyhedron is drawn, and not its outline: vertices and edges.

This patch only handles for non projected polyhedron plots. But that's all we need for #4327 :-)

You can, in principle, only drawn projections in 2 or 3 dimensions. There is no such thing as "drawing a non-projected polyhedron".

If you want to implement your own plotting style then you should create the projection and use the methods of the `Projection` object directly.

I guess there is a misunderstanding here:-)

This ticket is just about drawing *without outline* Polyhedrons living in a dimension 2 ambient space. This is all I need for #4327.

If I mentionned projections that's just because, if someone would want the same feature for a Polyhedron that has been projected in dimension 2, then this is not yet handled by this patch.

I think I understand what you want, but it is at odds with the strict separation of polyhedron and its projection that I very much would like to keep in the code. 

Having more control about the plot output is definitely desirable, but I find `outline` as a keyword very confusing. `X.plot(outline=True)` sounds like it ought to plot **only** the outline of `X`, but thats not what you propose.

If you just want to draw a polygon you only need

```
sage: P = Polyhedron([(0,0),(1,0),(0,1)])
sage: polygon2d(P.vertices())
```

How about we let the user specify three dictionaries 

```
P.plot(point={color='red'}, line={...}, polygon={...})
```

that are then passed to the `**kwds` of the respective graphics objects. And as special case you can specify `None` to switch them off. Then your outline-free plot would just be

```
P.plot(point=None, line=None)
```

Not quite: if P is a polyhedron of dimension 1 in an ambient space of dimension 2, then I want it to be drawn as a line (no points, no polygon). Similarly, if P is a point, I want it to be drawn as a point (no line, no polygon). See the examples in the patch.

I agree that the name "outline" is not good. What I really mean is "draw only the piece of the same dimension as P", but I did not manage to get a good name for that. Suggestions?

Thanks for the brainstorming :-)

Rebased upon #14175 (creating conflicts with myself ...)

Whats the expected output if the polyhedron is of dimension > 3?

Well, since I don't have a need for this feature I might not have the right perspective to have good insight :-) I guess the natural analogue would be to take the projected polyhedron and only draw it's non trivial face of highest dimension. E.g. if we started from some hypercube in 4D that would project onto a cube in 3D, then that cube would be drawn without its wireframe.

Cheers,

With my patch at #14175 this ticket would be obsolete, I think. I propose to close it as duplicate.
