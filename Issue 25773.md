Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2018-08-06 11:11:21

Split up database_pari in multiple packages to be closer to upstream's packaging.

*Tarballs*:

- https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/packages/elldata.tgz

- https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/packages/galpol.tgz

- https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/packages/seadata.tgz

- https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/packages/nftables.tgz

This would be great! I currently have to use symlinks because sage expects those databases to be in the same directory.

This would also need splitting up of the `GP_DATA_DIR` env variable.

Sage doesn't use those data files directly, only PARI does. It's PARI which expects them to be in the same directory. This is not going to change with this ticket.

You're right, that was a mistake.

I fixed it and I'm setting this back to positive review.

I just assumed you had a reason. Since its a pretty minor thing, I agree with immediately resetting to positive review.
