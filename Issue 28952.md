Seems good to me.
Is there a reason why you do not put `is_pyramid` as a cached method?


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2020-04-03 11:51:46

Well, I never considered caching it, because it is trivial. But I guess it doesn't matter.

Sorry, I forgot the trivial cases.

What is the proper output to `polytopes.simplex(0).is_pyramid()`?

You cannot construct it as pyramid over one of its faces, because the empty face doesn't have a center.

Currently this returns `False`. Is this reasonable?


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2020-04-03 11:58:41

Then I should add those cases, because currently this just gives a stupid error message.

I suggest the output to be `True` in this case. It does not need to be constructable in sage.

I agree. I never liked `False` either. I'll change it.
