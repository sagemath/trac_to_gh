Seems good to me.
Is there a reason why you do not put `is_pyramid` as a cached method?

Well, I never considered caching it, because it is trivial. But I guess it doesn't matter.

Sorry, I forgot the trivial cases.

What is the proper output to `polytopes.simplex(0).is_pyramid()`?

You cannot construct it as pyramid over one of its faces, because the empty face doesn't have a center.

I suggest the output to be `True` in this case. It does not need to be constructable in sage.
