Keywords: shift, _polynomial_list

Using version 9.1 of sage, it seems that _polynomial_list(), written in the file: /sage/src/sage/rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.py, sometimes returns wrong results:

```
sage: T.<a> = Qp(5).extension(x^2-5)
sage: T(1/5)._polynomial_list()
[5 + O(5^20)]
sage: T(a^-800)._polynomial_list()
[O(5^20)]
sage: T(25)._polynomial_list()
[5^2 + 3*5^21 + O(5^22)]
```


The first 2 problems are fixed by:
* changing direction of shifting: substituting the >> sign by <<. This makes sense, as the function _ntl_rep_abs specifies in its documentation that p<sup>k</sup> should be multiplied (rather then divied) by.
* Specifying the precision of the elements to be such that they have the desired precision **after** the shifting.

However, the third problem was not solved.

Note: I did not add a doctest for the case where e == 1, because I couldn't think of any eisenstein extension with such property.

2 out of 3 is still progress, so I am giving this a positive review. However, you should open another ticket for the third issue, that way it still is clear it is a known issue.
