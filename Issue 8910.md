The patch has been reviewed by Nicolas on the patch queue. I folded the review patches:

```
$ hg qgoto trac_8910-subsets_an_element-fh.patch
$ hg qfold trac_8910-subsets_an_element-review-nt.patch
$ hg qfold trac_8910-subsets_an_element-review-review-fh.patch
```

And Nicolas said by e-mail

```
> DÃ¨s que j'ai ton feu vert, je folde tout, et met la positive review sur trac.

Feu vert!
```

Meaning: (FH) as soon as I have your green light I fold the whole bunch, and set positive review on trac. (Answer from Nicolas) Green Light.

Therefore I allowed myself to put the positive review.
