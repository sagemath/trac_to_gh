Building Sage against this is currently failing, likely due to https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals/pull/134

After patching with ​https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals/pull/134 all tests pass on my side.

I'm testing it now too, but thanks for confirming!  I'll make a release candidate after.

Testing this on top of #31245.

Sage builds for me with this and all the tests pass except for the orthogonal one fixed at #26912.

This looks good to me modulo the actual release.

Ok, I'll make the final release then.  It will be unchanged from the release candidate other than some CI fixes I made (which don't change the code).
