Even though `is_unit` and `is_nilpotent` are correctly implemented the various implementations of `inverse_of_unit` are either wrong or not doing their job

```
sage: R.<x,y> = Zmod(4)[]
sage: u = 1 + 2*x + 2*y**2
sage: u.is_unit()
True
sage: (u * u).is_one()
True
sage: u.inverse_of_unit()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: Element is not a unit.
```

Hello Vincent, thank you for this fix. Minor comment: according to the reviewer's checklist (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/reviewer_checklist.html) you should mention the number of this ticket in the doctests saying that you fixed the bug you found.

Anyhow, everything looks good. I will wait for the result of the doctest for the rest.
