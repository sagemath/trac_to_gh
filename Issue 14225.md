```

The problem is that wlen_type is a 64-bit integer which is not correctly aligned to 8 bytes.

```

Note that running singular('2+3') in sage works fine and so does the second problematic doctest.
I still get the numerical noise problem from
* sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx
which is undoubtly unrelated,
and bunches of timeouts, but now I even get those on quite powerfull and recent computers...

Oh and I still had troubles building singular because of C++ headers the system has in /usr/local/include which seem incompatible with the ones Sage's GCC ships, and this path is added by Singular in src/Singular/Makefile[.in] to CPPFLAGS if gcc version is greater than 4.
You could argue that it is the computer install itself which is ill-configured, but when removing the -I/usr/local/include from Singular/Makefile[.in], everything builds fine.
I've opened a ticket upstream but thanks to Singular serving their http server on a unusual port, i cannot access it at the moment.

I'd say you put stuff there intentionally (rather than just building a package and letting it install its headers by default into /usr/include) to get it included when you explicitly add "-I/usr/local/include".
I don't know if any usual software install there by default (it seems this inclusion was done to please gcc > 4, but do gcc > 4 really install stuff there by default? maybe that was the install of the Singular dev which was put there...).

And it seems the problematic software on my system is Sun's gcc 3.4.3.
I don't think that's Sun default install, but it rather looks like a hack from the sysadmin.

On Unix at least, gcc will look in /usr/local/include anyway: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Search-Path.html or http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.3/cpp/Search-Path.html#Search-Path; so that's another point for not changing anything in Singular.

Note that without the -I/usr/local/include, then the headers which get picked are in

```
/infres/post/flori/sage-5.9.beta3-infres2/local/lib/gcc/sparc-sun-solaris2.10/4.6.3/include-fixed/sys/feature_tests.h
```

This looks like a very nice directory to get headers from for the Sage's gcc...
According to the above doc, adding an extra -I/usr/local/include should not change the search path, but it apparently does.
And it seems that by default, the GCC Sage built does not look there (I ran "gcc -E -v -" and it does not show /usr/local/include, only /usr/include after three directorues under $SAGE_LOCAL).

On a Ubuntu install, with the system-wide gcc, it indeed looks in /usr/local/include before the corresponding /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6/include-fixed (but after /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6/include).
In fact on the Solaris install, I guess the line correponding to /usr/local/include is $SAGE_LOCAL/include when I run "gcc -E -v -" which was defined so when Sage built GCC.
And in particular, none of these behaviors agree with GCC online doc, or rather the /usr/local should be replaced by the prefix used when GCC was built.
Indeed I have by default;
* "libdir"/gcc/"target"/"version"/include
* "prefix"/include
* "libdir"/gcc/"target"/"version"/include-fixed
* /usr/include/"target"
* /usr/include
On another ia64 system, the behavior is similar:
* with Sage's GCC

So the real question is, is adding this -I/usr/local/include really useful?
Shouldn't it rather be a user decision to add it if needed?
It seems most GCC are smart enough to correctly set their default include path anyway, not sure what the comment in Singular sources in Singular/Makefile.in is related to...
I'd like to say that if it does nothing on most systems, and just break my system (although I agree its config is not perfect, but I cannot do anything about that), then it's useless, but that would narrow minded.

In fact the addition of -I and -L was meant for versions of gcc (or other compilers?) before gcc 3.
It was then removed for gcc3 at https://github.com/Singular/Sources/commit/833e11faeedd415ba185a7a678e4dcbe674720c3#Singular/configure.in

It's planned, but I cannot do it during the day (without appropiate ssh tunnels and http proxies) and have a tendency to postpone it in the evening.
