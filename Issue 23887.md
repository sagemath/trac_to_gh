I'm slightly curious about how this helps for Python3, but it is something that will help Sage's startup time (of which, sadly, more combinatorial (representation theoretic) things should be lazily imported).

Thanks, Travis.

Well, I am afraid that this just prevents the broken Iwahori-Hecke algebra to block the startup of python3 sage. So this is only hiding the problem further. My current aim is to have vanilla sage starts with python3, so that people can measure the huge size of the remaining issues.
