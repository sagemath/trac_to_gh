Remove all uses of `flint` from `module_list.py`. Instead ensure that `flint` is found through `# distutils` directives and cimports.

I must say I had to check that we already have a directive in `flint.pxd` as I couldn't see `flint` being added again.

There are several instances of `# distutils: libraries = flint` in `pxd` files inside `sage/libs/flint`, are they all needed? I would have thought some of them could be trimmed.

Do you have concrete suggestions about which ones should be removed?

Why should we remove `# distutils: libraries = flint` from a file just because it happens to `cimport` a file which also has `# distutils: libraries = flint`? Imagine that we remove that and that somebody in the future decides to stop `cimport`ing `sage.libs.flint.fmpz_vec`. Then you get breakage.

I prefer that each `# distutils` directive declares whatever is in *that* file, regardless of which other things it happens to `cimport`.

That *intentionally* does *not* have a distutils directive. Separating the types from the library functions is good because many `.pxd` files need some FLINT type but do not need to be linked against `-lflint`.

Look at `sage.rings.integer` for example: everything `cimport`ing that needs to know about the `mpz_t` type. But it doesn't need to be linked against `-lgmp` because of that. By separating the types like this, we only link the library if we really use it.
