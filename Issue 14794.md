```

(This is when #14884 is applied; otherwise it would throw a different error.) What is going on is that the `column_stabilizer` method of a tableau returns permutation group elements rather than honest standard permutations, whereas the `symmetric_group_action_on_entries` method only eats standard permutations.

Of course, type casting does solve the problem, but this is ugly and not completely trivial:

```
sage: p
(1,3)(2,4)
sage: parent(p)
Permutation Group with generators [(), (2,4), (1,3)]
sage: parent(SymmetricGroup(4)(p))
Symmetric group of order 4! as a permutation group
sage: parent(Permutation(p))      
Standard permutations
```

So `T.symmetric_group_action_on_entries(SymmetricGroup(4)(p))` wouldn't work either, but `T.symmetric_group_action_on_entries(Permutation(p))` works.

This is not an error in the classical meaning of the word, but I think this is something that should be fixed. How?

Incidentally, it seems that the `Permutation(p)` typecast takes an ungodly amount of time...
