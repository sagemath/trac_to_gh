I spotted this while working on #12662:

```
QQbar(sqrt(2)) + QQbar(zeta(7))
```

will return a massive traceback concluding in

```
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
sage: 
```

For the record, while reviewing this patch I noticed that ` QQbar.zeta(6) ` _also_ fails, in a completely different way! See followup ticket #12746.
