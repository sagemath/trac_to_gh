The double colons are an essential part of the documentation, and they are ubiquitous.   mvngu's pictures show what happens when you change them, and it's not good.  Meanwhile, see #8161 for a patch which changes all double colons to single ones when displaying docstrings using the command-line interface.  That ticket will "fix" the issue raised here.

I think this ticket should be closed as "wontfix".
