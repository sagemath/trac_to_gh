# Issue 21537: Upgrade to planarity 3.0

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: thansen

Original creation time: 2016-10-27 12:47:54

Planarity 3.0.0.5 was released 2016-05-03.

Release announcement: https://github.com/graph-algorithms/edge-addition-planarity-suite/releases

This update would help the efforts to package sagemath in Debian, because we have planarity 3 in Debian and should use that. Here is a patch that makes sagemath build with planarity 3, but there are failing doctests:

1. If the ticket is about updating a package please choose the appropriate `Component`, here `packages: standard`.

2. You should always fill the `Authors` field with your full name
