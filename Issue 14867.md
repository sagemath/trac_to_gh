Presently, taking a transpose of a modn_dense matrix of smallish size is much more expensive than constructing the right kernel, because the method is just a generic implementation. We can make this much faster. Same for submatrix and stack.

I tried a little experiment for matrix creation. Presently, in `M.__neg__()` the matrix gets created via

```
        M = self.__class__.__new__(self.__class__, self._parent,None,None,None)
```
leading to

```
sage: k=GF(17); M=matrix(20,30,[k.random_element() for i in range(600)])
sage: %timeit M.__neg__()
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.81 us per loop
```
If I change that line to

```
        M = self.new_matrix()
```
this becomes

```
sage: %timeit M.__neg__()
100000 loops, best of 3: 11.8 us per loop
```
so there are much lower overhead ways of creating matrices (if you already have a hold of the parent).

Of course, in `submatrix` and `stack` you don't have the parent in hand, and in `transpose` you only do if the matrix happens to be square (which may be worth special casing!). However, when you're doing frequent matrix computations, the matrices often end up having similar shapes, so the parents you're looking for are probably already available. This suggests that `new_matrix` should have access to a cache of parents (weakly referenced or rotating), so that it can do really quick (empty) matrix creation.

In the ticket description, you say: "taking a transpose of a modn_dense matrix of smallish size is much more expensive than constructing the right kernel, **because the method is just a generic implementation.**"

In contrast, I believe that there *should* be a generic implementation of the transpose, or at least there should be some generic helper methods for creating the transposed matrix.

For example, it should make sense to have a method of a matrix space returning the transposed matrix space, and this method should perhaps even be a cached method. When using this helper in all custom implementations of `.transpose()`, then the time to create the transposed matrix' parent could be reduced.

Moreover, all matrices are supposed to provide fast `set/get_unsafe()` methods. Are you really sure that a generic implementation relying on these fast "unsafe" methods would be slower than a custom implementation such as the one of `Matrix_modn_dense` that uses the underlying data structure directly, rather than using `set/get_unsafe`:

```python
    def transpose(self):
        ...
        for i from 0 <= i < ncols:
            for j from 0 <= j < nrows:
                M._entries[j+i*nrows] = self._entries[i+j*ncols]    
```

And is this really the correct thing to do? Namely, in the unsafe set/get method of `Matrix_modn_dense_float`, the operations are done on the attribute `._matrix`, not `._entries`. If I understand correctly, `._matrix` is arranged in rows, whereas `._entries` is the same chunk of memory, but not separated in rows. But then, wouldn't it be faster to use `._matrix` as long as one stays in the same row (which in the above loop over `j` is the case for `M`?

Regardless whether we create a fully fledged generic implementation of `.transpose()` or just provide new helper methods: We need to address the following custom `.transpose()` methods:

I'm not arguing with that.

Yes, for modndense it definitely is, because it boils down to reshuffling a C-array of floats/doubles. I'm pretty sure the compiler isn't capable of inlining `getunsafe` and `setunsafe`.

`._matrix` is an array of pointers into `._entries` (and yes, in my code I assumed that `Matrix_modn_dense_template` always has its entries laid out in the same way. That assumption is made elsewhere in the file too). Looking up via `._matrix` might save a multiplication at the expense of an extra memory access.

> We need to address the following custom `.transpose()` methods:

We can reevaluate them with what we learn here, but I'm not sure that the same tradeoffs will apply. For instance, for an integer matrix we cannot expect the entries to be contiguously stored and of the same size, so the memory management just for the entries is already much more expensive.

Some timings. I changed `dense_template.transpose` to use the given parent for square matrices. 
With this inner copy loop:

```
        for i from 0 <= i < ncols:
            for j from 0 <= j < nrows:
                M._entries[j+i*nrows] = self._entries[i+j*ncols]    
```
I get:

```
sage: k=GF(17)
sage: A=matrix(k,100,101,[k.random_element() for i in range(100*101)])
sage: B=matrix(k,100,100,[k.random_element() for i in range(100*100)])
sage: %timeit At=A.transpose()
10000 loops, best of 3: 30.3 us per loop
sage: %timeit Bt=B.transpose()
100000 loops, best of 3: 11 us per loop
```
As you can see, parent creation overhead is still the main thing.

With this inner loop

```
        for i from 0 <= i < ncols:
            for j from 0 <= j < nrows:
                M._matrix[i][j] = self._matrix[j][i]    
```
I get:

```
sage: %timeit At=A.transpose()
10000 loops, best of 3: 35.8 us per loop
sage: %timeit Bt=B.transpose()
100000 loops, best of 3: 15.8 us per loop
```
as one of the better timings. Depending on the matrix creation, but consistent with that fixed, I was also seeing `23.4 us`, which I guess happens if the `._matrix` pointer array is unfortunately allocated in memory relative to `_entries` (cache thrashing perhaps).

I've also tried:

```
        Midx=0
        for i from 0 <= i < ncols:
            selfidx=i
            for j from 0 <= j < nrows:
                M._entries[Midx]=self._entries[selfidx]
                Midx+=1
                selfidx+=ncols
```
which was not really distinguishable from the first solution, but if anything, slightly slower. So my guess is that a multiplication is not something to worry about on modern CPUs.

If I understand correctly, you say that we should keep all the custom transpose methods, since the matrix classes should know best how to create one of their instances efficiently.

Since you say that the creation of the parent has the most impact, I suggest to add a lazy attribute `transposed` to matrix spaces, and this can be used to create a blank matrix of the correct dimension that can then be filled by whatever custom method we have.

Variation of this theme: We could instead say that `self.new_matrix()` should not only check whether the to-be-created matrix lives in the same parent as self, but make a second special case for the transposed dimensions.

```

So, we see the following regression in cumulative time:

```
vector_spaces.py:34(__classcall_private__) 0.020 --> 0.265
```
In fact, we see `1000    0.005    0.000    0.197    0.000 vector_spaces.py:64(__init__)` with the current ticket branch, but it does not occur at all with the matrix branch.

Hence, I guess to fix the regression we need to address this question: Why is the category of vector spaces (probably the one over `GF(5)`) not taken from cache?

The difference seems to be the category initialisation of the matrix space:

```
sage: M=matrix(GF(5),6,6,range(36))
sage: MS = M.parent()
sage: %timeit M.right_kernel_matrix(basis='computed')
1000 loops, best of 3: 377 us per loop
sage: MS.full_category_initialisation()
sage: %timeit M.right_kernel_matrix(basis='computed')
10000 loops, best of 3: 190 us per loop
```

There is a reason why the category of a matrix space is not fully initialised by default. So, making category initialisation the new default would be bad, IMHO.

First, we should try to understand why apparently the `right_kernel_matrix` operation in the master branch does result in caching the category, while the ticket branch doesn't.

Then we should identify some operations that *should* trigger a full category initialisation.

In principle, creating a strong cache for vector space categories would fix the regression; in a new sage session:

```
sage: M=matrix(GF(5),6,6,range(36))
sage: C = VectorSpaces(GF(5))
sage: %timeit M.right_kernel_matrix(basis='computed')
10000 loops, best of 3: 186 us per loop
```
But this would be prone to create memory leaks that we have previously been fixing.

Doing `M=matrix(GF(5),6,6,range(36))` does *not* trigger the creation of the category of vector spaces over `GF(5)`. I wonder why this is the case: After all, `M` knows its parent, and as I have just checked the category of vector spaces should *always* be used when creating a matrix space.

So, does the `matrix` function do anything funny when creating a matrix? Such as: Not creating the matrix space which the matrix belongs to?

No, I was mistaken. The matrix space of 6x6 matrices over GF(5) is created when doing `M=matrix(GF(5),6,6,range(36))`. However, the category used for partial initialisation of the category is `Algebras(GF(5))`, not `VectorSpaces(GF(5))`.

It seems to me that the following happens when creating a square matrix and then computing right kernel:
- The parent of the matrix is *incompletely* (by #11900) initialised in the category of algebras. This will *not* trigger the creation of super categories, as the incomplete category initialisation skips the category's parent class.
- When computing the kernel, some temporary results are created that are non-square matrices. Their parents are initialised in the category of vector spaces.
- The temporary results, their parents and thus also the category of vector spaces will be garbage collected as soon as the kernel computation is done. Hence, when we compute another kernel, then the category of vector spaces is created again. And that's the regression.

I just tested: If one adds the following initialisation method to the category of algebras, then the regression vanishes:

```
    def __init__(self, B):
        Category_over_base_ring.__init__(self, B)
        self._super_categories
```

It stores the category of B-modules as an attribute of the category of B-algebras. Hence, if we create a square matrix M over GF(5), then there will be a chain of strong references

```
M->M.parent()->Algebras(GF(5))->VectorSpaces(GF(5))
```
And thus the undue garbage collection of `VectorSpaces(GF(5))`, that seems to be the cause of the regression, will not take place.

However, I can imagine that some code (number fields and elliptic curves are the usual suspects) will regress when the creation of the category of algebras always creates the super categories. After all, an observed regression was the reason for introducing the incomplete initialisation of matrix spaces in #11900.

What do you think we should do?

Hmm interesting; fixing a speed regression by going too much in one direction is triggering another speed regression!

Would it make sense as a short term fix to implement now the
alternative option mentioned in the documentation of
MatrixSpace.full_category_initialisation? After all, having an object
whose category is not completely initialized is prone to issues, and
it's not unreasonable to have to ask explicitly for it when needed,
rather than the converse.

```
        .. todo::

            Add instead an optional argument to :func:`MatrixSpace` to
            temporarily disable the category initialization in those
            special cases where speed is critical::

                sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,7, init_category=False) # todo: not implemented
                sage: TestSuite(MS).run()                         # todo: not implemented
                Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
                AssertionError: category of self improperly initialized

            until someone recreates explicitly the same matrix space
            without that optional argument::

                sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,7)                      # todo: not implemented
                sage: TestSuite(MS).run()                         # todo: not implemented
```

Then, for the long run, would the proper fix be to aim at using
Algebra(Fields()) (which is yet to be implemented) instead of
Algebras(K) as category?

Cheers,

__Good news first__

The proposed `__init__` method for the category of algebras seems not to result in a severe regression in the benchmark examples from #11900. Or perhaps there is a regression in `prove_BSD`, but this would be due to the current commits, not due to the new init method.

And finally, as baseline, the master branch:

```

CPU times: user 10.07 s, sys: 0.20 s, total: 10.27 s

....:             
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
sage: %time test(E)

sage: E = J0(46).endomorphism_ring()
sage: %time g = E.gens()
CPU times: user 9.25 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 9.41 s
Wall time: 9.43 s
```

Hence, in these tests, that have previously been the reason to have an incomplete category initialisation of matrix spaces, there would be no regression when letting the category of algebras create and store their super categories upon initialisation.

What is your opinion on that idea?

__Worries__

Did some regression creep in without being noticed? The first example,

```
%time D = J0(46).endomorphism_ring().discriminant()
```
used to be faster, pre-#9138 and post-#11900.

I'd say this particular example should go on a separate ticket.

    "body": "Replying to [comment:18 SimonKing]:\n> My changes are: I added a lazy attribute to matrix spaces, returning the transposed matrix space, and I am using it in `.new_matrix()`. This has the advantage that it is a generic method used by different custom implementations of `.transpose()`. Hence, there should be a speed-up for all types of matrices, not only for `Matrix_modn_dense_float`.\n\n\nTrue, but `new_matrix` does too much. Instantiating a new matrix via `self.__class__.__new__(...)` has the big advantage that it avoids the `__init__`, which has expensive argument processing and has to do a lot of work to see how the entries need to be initialized. But a lot of these inner routines don't care about initialization, because they'll fill the matrix themselves any way (with a memcpy possibly!).

> My changes are: I added a lazy attribute to matrix spaces, returning the transposed matrix space, and I am using it in `.new_matrix()`. This has the advantage that it is a generic method used by different custom implementations of `.transpose()`. Hence, there should be a speed-up for all types of matrices, not only for `Matrix_modn_dense_float`.


True, but `new_matrix` does too much. Instantiating a new matrix via `self.__class__.__new__(...)` has the big advantage that it avoids the `__init__`, which has expensive argument processing and has to do a lot of work to see how the entries need to be initialized. But a lot of these inner routines don't care about initialization, because they'll fill the matrix themselves any way (with a memcpy possibly!). Your timings show that getting a quicker hold of the parent improves timings (and hence may be worth doing generically), but to get the factor >2 speed-up I was seeing, we probably need to avoid calling `__init__`. That's of course tricky on a generic level, but completely doable in specific classes (as already happens in `modn_dense_template`). Possibly improve infrastructure to write such optimizations?

The problem there is that the person not requiring a fully initialized matrix space isn't asking for a matrix space at all: he/she is probably just asking for a matrix and is doing that, quite reasonably, via linear algebra routines. Those routines *internally* find the need to find/construct an appropriate matrix space and these routines need to be able to operate both in time critical code where full initialization of a never-used object is too expensive and in situations where the result needs to be a full member of the sage universe. I suspect it'll be too difficult to get the intent of the caller to the location where that intent is relevant.

In cases where the same size matrices end up being created repeatedly, ensuring that matrix spaces have a circular reference (most parents do) should let them stick around long enough (till next GC) for weak caching to be effective.

In number theoretic code, where one for instance needs to compute a lot of characteristic polynomials of same-sized matrices over a lot of distinct finite fields, the matrix spaces don't get used/reused at all, so any time spent on them is wasted.

That used to be the rationale in #11900.

However, it seems that with the current version of Sage, the examples used in #11900 would *not* show a new regression when one would now *always* fully initialise the matrix spaces!

So, the underlying rationale for this part of #11900 is gone. It would make sense to consider to drop the dirty trick of incomplete initialisation.

That said: It seems that some of the examples are now showing a regression even *without* full category initialisation of matrix spaces. That's what #15792 is about, and it currently is a mystery where the regression came from---apparently it isn't from matrix spaces.

```

At #15792, I have collected some tests that apparently became much slower in the past 2 years. I have no idea yet why they became slower.

Here, I am showcasing the effect of full category initialisation on the time needed to create a matrix space.

First, the current master branch, i.e., no full initialisation. This seems to be slower than 2 years ago, but not much.

```
sage: def test():
....:     for i in xrange(10000):
....:         MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,i)
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 0.93 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.93 s
Wall time: 0.93 s
sage: type(MatrixSpace(QQ,8))
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace'>
```

Now, I am repeating it with full category initialisation:

```
sage: def test():
....:     for i in xrange(10000):
....:         MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,i)
....:         
sage: %time test()
CPU times: user 1.74 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.74 s
Wall time: 1.74 s
sage: type(MatrixSpace(QQ,8))
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace_with_category'>
sage: (1.74-0.93)/0.93
0.870967741935484
```
So, the regression "on its origin" would be 87%.

In other words, Nils, you are right: A tree did fall onto a pothole in the street.

I made some doc improvements and fixed a typo that caused this to not compile.

Using the same test order as comment:5:

```
10000 loops, best of 3: 93.2 µs per loop
10000 loops, best of 3: 95.5 µs per loop
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.95 µs per loop
10000 loops, best of 3: 89.3 µs per loop
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.08 µs per loop
```
vs `develop`:

```
10000 loops, best of 3: 132 µs per loop
10000 loops, best of 3: 133 µs per loop
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.73 µs per loop
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.69 µs per loop
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.38 µs per loop
```
So the right kernel matrices are faster, but not the `transpose`, `stack` (this one is really bad), and `submatrix`.

For the `transpose`, you are not using `self._parent.transposed` lazy attribute.

For `stack`, the meat of the code should be in `cdef _stack_impl(self, bottom):` (see `matrix1.pyx`).

Instead of overwriting `submatrix`, it would be better to define `matrix_from_rows_and_columns`.

However, I don't have a reason why these direct implementations are slower than their generic counterparts.

Addendum: Actually, a good part of the `stack` slowdown might be because you are doing the bulk of the work in a `def` function rather than a `cdef`.

Hm, somehow the changes for better construction of parents didn't make it in. Fixed now. At least nothing is worse now. However, without improvement it's hard to argue why to make the changes. Perhaps there are other cases where differences are bigger.

By using `_stack_impl`, I could get some extra speed out of `stack`:

```
100000 loops, best of 3: 9.13 µs per loop
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.5 µs per loop
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.14 µs per loop
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.9 µs per loop
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.34 µs per loop
```
The most amazing thing is the speedup of the right kernel matrix. There was a lot of overhead there: about a 10x speedup.

If my last changes are good, then positive review.

For future reference, code like

```
cdef Py_ssize_t* nonpivots = <Py_ssize_t*>sig_malloc(sizeof(Py_ssize_t)*(ncols-r))
```
is unsafe for 2 reasons:

1. `sig_malloc` might return `NULL` in the case that no memory is available.

2. The multiplication `sizeof(Py_ssize_t) * (ncols-r)` can overflow (this is unlikely to happen in practice for matrices, but it's still a bug)

Luckily, the function `check_allocarray` from cysignals solves both these problems. The allocation could be written as

```
cdef Py_ssize_t* nonpivots = <Py_ssize_t*>check_allocarray(ncols - r, sizeof(Py_ssize_t))
```
