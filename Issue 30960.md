Keywords: dense graphs, bitsets

Currently, the dense graphs backend redefines bitsets. We change the type to `binary_matrix_t`.

This mainly simplifies the code and lets dense graphs use future improvements of bitsets, but it also speeds up direct functions with the backend.

Realloc is a bit slower though.

We also add reallocation for binary matrix and make some small improvements to `binary_matrix.pxi`.

Before:

```
sage: set_random_seed(0)                                                                                                              
sage: edges = [(randint(0,1000), randint(0,1000)) for _ in range(100000)]

sage: %timeit _ = G.copy(sparse=True)

If I'm correct, it should be a bit faster to get out-neighbors (unsafe iterator) now. For in-neighbors, I'm not sure if it is faster or slower. 

Concerning the realloc, the slowdown might not be a critical issue.

I'm waiting for the patchbot. My tests are OK, but I may have missed something.
