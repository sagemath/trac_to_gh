By the way, I checked that IPython creates some of its subfolders under `$DOT_SAGE`, and the `notebook_cookie_secret` file in `$HOME/Library/Jupyter/runtime` (on macOS)  with more restrictive permissions (700/600).

On the other hand, the history file is 644. 

So when the user sets the permissions of `$DOT_SAGE` to 755, the history will be exposed, but more sensitive data are still safe.

I haven't checked what the legacy notebook does.
