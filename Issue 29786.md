This could be `cygwin-stage-iv-e` unless you want some optional packages in it, which are built in stages `iv-b` to `iv-d`, in which case it should be stage `v`.

According to https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/master/images/win/Windows2019-Readme.md, InnoSetup 6.0.5 comes preinstalled

Let's get this ready for Sage 9.3?

I don't know if I'll have time before then to really make sure this is working, but after 9.3 (or even sooner) we can at least start testing it on betas?

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.
