Currently sage is not able to convert back polynomials from libgap

```
sage: libgap.MinimalPolynomial(QQ, libgap.eval("E(3)"))
x_1^2+x_1+1
sage: p = libgap.MinimalPolynomial(QQ, libgap.eval("E(3)"))
sage: p.sage()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: cannot construct equivalent Sage object

It looks good except for `_coerce_map_from_`. I don't think it is a good idea to have `libgap` have a coerce map from everything; there are many algebras that (lib)gap almost certainly has no idea about (e.g., Jordan algebras).

- coercion between interfaces objects and Sage objects should be one way. So if for a given ring there is a coercion `Sage -> GAP` then it should be the case for every ring that GAP understands.

- The solution I used is precisely what is done with PARI/GP (see for instance the `PariInstance` class in `/sage/libs/pari/pari_instance.pyx`)

- Implementing the function `_coerce_map_from_` would be a useless pain

- *"interface objects"* are only intended for people having a knowledge of the underlying software

Now, if for some specific `GAP` object you want to lift it back to Sage then you can either use conversion (i.e. `MyParent(my_interface_object)`) or use the `.sage()` method

```
sage: pari(13).sage()
13
sage: parent(_)
Integer Ring
sage: gap(13).sage()
13
sage: parent(_)
Integer Ring
sage: libgap(13).sage()
13
sage: parent(_)
Integer Ring
```

The problem with unlimited coercion maps is that we get a bad (IMO incorrect) error message (this is on `develop`):

```sage
sage: cat = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().FiniteDimensional()
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['x','y','z'], category=cat)
sage: J1 = JordanAlgebra(C, names=['a','b','c'])
sage: J1.an_element() + gap(2)

There should be a conversion, but I think a coercion is far too strong.
Perhaps we should ask sage-devel?

It is a good idea to discuss what should we do concerning coercion and external softwares/libraries.

Concerning this ticket, it is very handy that the coercion always go from Sage to third party interfaces

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: p = x^3 + 2*x + 1
sage: p(pari(2))
13
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.libs.pari.gen.gen'>
```


Making explicit the subset of Sage parents that can actually be represented in a given interface might indeed be much better. But certainly harder to write and maintain. The way I choose is the lazy one. The error messages you mentioned are wrong but should never appear if you restrict to "pure Sage functions". If desirable for pari/gap, I guess that implementing it belongs to another ticket.

And this is not the only wrong thing with interfaces. The default implementation of conversion between Sage and the interfaces etc relies on string representations and global variables... which is of course unreliable

sage: p = 3*R.0*R.1 + R.2^3

Well, since we already do a catch-all coercion for `pari` and we got no response from sage-devel, I can tolerate the current state of the coercion.
