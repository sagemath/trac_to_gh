How did you come up with this? Is there a specific concrete problem or just a theoretical bug?

By the way, the gist link talks about "`cpdef`'d without a corresponding entry in their pxd file" while the Cython bug talks about "`cpdef` override of a `cdef` method". These are obviously different things, so what is the problem exactly? If the problem is only `cpdef` overrides of `cdef` methods, I guess that a large majority of the entries in the gist link are false positives, making that link not very informative.

Yeah, this caused a segfault that saraedum and I spent 10 hours yesterday debugging, while working on #23218.  Because the vtable is screwed up, function calls behave unpredictably.

Cython will soon raise an error in these cases.  I think the best thing to do is to wait until we update to a new version of Cython and change these pxd files then.  I think it's worth leaving this ticket open until that point in case someone else runs into a similar problem.

I convinced Cython upstream to downgrade this to a warning for now. That will make our life easier, since we can first upgrade to Cython 0.26 (in beta now) and then fix this gradually.
