# Issue 8786: in graph.py, there is an autogenerated broken link to Wikipedia.  replace it by something not autogenerated that works (probably trivial), or fix the url parser in sphinx (really hard)

This is in devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph.py:

```
class Graph(GenericGraph):
    r"""
    Undirected graph.

    A graph is a set of vertices connected by edges
    (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics) ).
```


If you look at http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html and search for "mathematics", then click the link, you'll see it is broken.  Fix this by:

1. fixing sphinx?  too tricky, maybe

2. finding sphinx docs and figuring out how to explicitly specify a URL.

And here are a few more corrections (to be applied on top of Minh's)... Some were not a problem as they contained no parenthesis, but as I had an Emacs macro available... :-)

By the way, I noticed something funny while working on this patch :


```
~/sage/sage-doc/sage/graphs$ grep -e "def.*eedback" *
digraph.py:    def feedback_edge_set(self,value_only=False):
digraph.py:    def feedback_vertex_set(self,value_only=False):
generic_graph.py:    def feedback_edge_set(self,value_only=False):
generic_graph.py:    def feedback_vertex_set(self,value_only=False):
~/sage/sage-doc/sage/graphs$ 
```


It must have occurred during the splitting of graph.py... I'll create another ticket to take care of it :-)
