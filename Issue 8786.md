# Issue 8786: in graph.py, there is an autogenerated broken link to Wikipedia.  replace it by something not autogenerated that works (probably trivial), or fix the url parser in sphinx (really hard)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: was

Original creation time: 2010-04-27 22:19:35

Assignee: mvngu

This is in devel/sage/sage/graphs/graph.py:

```
class Graph(GenericGraph):
    r"""
    Undirected graph.

    A graph is a set of vertices connected by edges
    (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics) ).
```


If you look at http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html and search for "mathematics", then click the link, you'll see it is broken.  Fix this by:

  1. fixing sphinx?  too tricky, maybe

  2. finding sphinx docs and figuring out how to explicitly specify a URL.

The attached patch should fix the broken links in `graph.py` to Wikipedia. Any URL can be encapsulated using the markup:

```
`descriptive-name <valid-URL>`_
```

And here are a few more corrections (to be applied on top of Minh's)... Some were not a problem as they contained no parenthesis, but as I had an Emacs macro available... :-)

By the way, I noticed something funny while working on this patch :


```
~/sage/sage-doc/sage/graphs$ grep -e "def.*eedback" *
digraph.py:    def feedback_edge_set(self,value_only=False):
digraph.py:    def feedback_vertex_set(self,value_only=False):
generic_graph.py:    def feedback_edge_set(self,value_only=False):
generic_graph.py:    def feedback_vertex_set(self,value_only=False):
~/sage/sage-doc/sage/graphs$ 
```


It must have occurred during the splitting of graph.py... I'll create another ticket to take care of it :-)

The patch [trac_8786-other_fixes.2.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-other_fixes.2.patch) is the same as [trac_8786-other_fixes.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-other_fixes.patch), but with the ticket number in its commit message. The reviewer patch [trac_8786-reviewer.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-reviewer.patch) contains the following changes:

 * The patch [trac_8786-other_fixes.2.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-other_fixes.2.patch) does some fixes about broken links. But it removes the context about why we need such links. Restore that context.
 * Some links in [trac_8786-other_fixes.2.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-other_fixes.2.patch) do not link to a Wikipedia article. Correct such links to point to Wikipedia articles.

So only the following patches now need review by anyone but me:

 * [trac_8786-wikipedia-links.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-wikipedia-links.patch)
 * [trac_8786-reviewer.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-reviewer.patch)

Then let this ticket be positively reviewed ! The patches are to be applied in this order :

  * [trac_8786-wikipedia-links.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-wikipedia-links.patch)
  *  [trac_8786-other_fixes.2.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-other_fixes.2.patch)
  * [trac_8786-reviewer.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8786/trac_8786-reviewer.patch)

And there is nothing wrong to report on alpha2. And I did not notice any other link we could have missed in the documentation :-)

Thank you very much, Minh !!
