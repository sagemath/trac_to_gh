Keywords: Fourier coefficients, graphics

In #17222, the Fourier coefficients of the periodic fluctuation in the second order term of the expected sum of output of a transducer have been computed.

In this follow-up ticket, methods for drawing graphics comparing the empirical fluctuation with the trigonometric polynomial are provided.
