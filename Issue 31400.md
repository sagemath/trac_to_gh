As pointed out in #25034 and https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/IDtiGF6HB28/m/QWwnAeLJBAAJ there is currently a conflict of conventions.

The implementation is in line https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AssociatedLegendrePolynomial.html now, but as mentioned above this source seems to be flawed and a distinction has to be made.

There are a few references to consider:

- https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AssociatedLegendrePolynomial.html (probably flawed?)
- https://dlmf.nist.gov/14.3#E1
- https://dlmf.nist.gov/14.21#i.p1
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Legendre_polynomials
- http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cbm/aands/page_332.htm

I see three options here:

1. We introduce a flag switching back and forth between Ferrers functions and Legendre functions (like it is done in Mathematica).
2. We introduce an environment variable making that distinction (like in Maple).
3. We separate Ferrers functions and Legendre functions completely; for example `ferrers_func` and `gen_legendre_P`.

I advocate the latter option since it leads to less confusion for the end-user (and developer).

Other than that, implementing connection formulas to Legendre (Ferrers) functions of second kind are also desirable.
