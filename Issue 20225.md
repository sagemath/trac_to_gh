Keywords: lp

Here's a bug:

```
sage: p.<x,y> = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x[0], y[0]
(x_0, x_1)
sage: p.set_max(x, 42)
sage: p.get_max(y[0])
42.0
```

The bug is in `MIPVariable.set_min`, `.set_max`, which calls back into the problem to change the bounds of *all* variables of the problem rather than just its components. 

Oh, and why does a `MIPVariable` only have `set_max`, but no `get_max`? 
And why all of that bizarre delegating to `MIPVariable` when other `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` methods such as `set_integer` etc. just do everything directly, and no corresponding `MIPVariable` methods exist?

And why is there no way to query the values of the components of the `_default_mipvariable`?
