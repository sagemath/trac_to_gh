This script would be better in the sage-scripts spkg, as it's sage-specific, probably as sage-testjava.sh or some such. The change will break one doctest in devel/sage/sage/interfaces/jmoldata.py, where it is looking for it using the full path.

I would argue the move is only appropriate if any other package in Sage depends on java.  To my knowledge, nothing in the base install other than Jmol does.
