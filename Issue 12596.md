There are only 17 different possible isogeny graphs for elliptic curves over Q.  It would be nice if the isogeny graph was laid out in the same way each time, and if the labels corresponded to the Cremona labels of the curves in the isogeny class.

Review:  This patch implements three different things:  (1) A new class for isogeny classes of elliptic curves (currently only for curves over Q); (2) implementation of the new (March 2012) LMFDB labels for elliptic curves over Q, with utilities for comverting to and from Cremona labels; (3) better layouts for isogeny graphs of elliptic curves over Q.

I have been through the code in some detail and only found some minor things to fix, as in the reviewer's patch.  One of these was a typo causing doctest failure.  Nothing more than minor.  If David R is happy with these, I'll give the ticket a positive review.

I have updated the review patch: it used to be that when asking for order='database' for a curve not in the database, this was caught but the error message output itself raised a confusing error (on trying to output %self).  Instead the error message now uses %self.E.  I added a doctest which illustrates this.

I give David's original patch a positive review modulo my own reviewer's patch, so if David (or anyone) thinks my patch is OK, please give the whole ticket a positive review.  I tested this on 5.0.beta14.
