I've implemented a function for evaluating cyclotomic polynomials without having to explicitly create the polynomial: this gives both memory and speed savings for large n.

Some lines are to long. Maximum line length should be 79 characters.

``n`th` creates a bad rendered reference manual (HTML), ``n`-th` should work.

`\divides` seems to be an unknown command. Reference manual (HTML) shows

```
System Message: WARNING/2 (\Phi_n(x) = \prod_{d \divides n} (x^d - 1)^{\mu(n / d)})
```

use `\mid` instead.

There is a double "that" in `parity_divisors()`.

Please add an example for `_x = Integer(x)` fails.

Not necessary for positive review but could you also change

```
raise *Error, "..."
```

to

```
raise *Error("...")
```

I've changed it so that it tries to just call PARI (and fixed the timeout problem).  But that won't always work, since not every ring in Sage can convert to PARI.

I don't strongly object to just falling back on `cyclotomic_polynomial` in this case, but the current code will provide a speedup in some cases.  Of course those cases are probably rarely of interest....

I'd prefer to keep your generic code in if it really handles some corner cases better than going through `cyclotomic_polynomial`.
Could provide an example of a ring where this additional code would be of interest?

It's still interesting to figure out when it's being used.  Adding a print statement in the `except StandardError` clause, I'm finding that most of the examples in the `TESTS` block are using my implementation.  I'm not sure why PARI is failing in these cases though.

Can't see any issues. Patch applies, tests work, code checks out with changes mentioned above added, values agree with evaluation of ``cyclotomic_polynomial()`` for every test case I tried.

Fixed minor formatting errors in the documentation for ``cyclotomic_value()``. Added one or two lines too for further clarification of the algorithm.
