# Issue 21624: LatticePosets: Add congruence-related functions / part 2

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21861

Original creator: jmantysalo

CC:  â€‹mantepse tscrim chapoton

Add functions that computes 1) congruence generated by lists of elements, 2) lattice of congruences and 3) quotient lattice. Add functions to check if a lattice is 4) simple and 5) uniform.

This is part two. Part one is #20058 and it handles number 1 above.

Whole set: Needs comments about the code implementation, the code PEP-compliance, the documentation and the examples used.

If wanted, I can of course split this ticket to several separate tickets.

One doctest fails, but that is already taken care by #22225.

Can you add a test showing the bug is fixed? Also, what about the `TODO` comment?

Good point. Added.

Well, I haven't thinked yet `:=)`. The code works, but it can be that it does unnecessary computing.

This hits the same error on the number of functions as the other ticket (sorry, I don't remember the number offhand), so that is a (soft) dependency of this ticket.

If you haven't thought about it yet and don't plan on doing so soon, then could you change the `TODO` comment to seem less like it is targeted to yourself? (Sorry, I don't really understand the comment, so I can't quite help here.)

Added.

As you wish, removed. I guess everyone looking at the code can see that there might be a place for optimization.

The question can be phrased like this: "Suppose that the congruence generated by pair (a,b) is regular, and so is the congruence generated by (c,d). Is the congruence generated by both together then also regular?" (And same for uniform and isoform congruences.)

Thanks. Positive review.

Alas, I have no idea, sorry.

Thanks Travis! Not only for this one, but for several tickets.
