# Issue 16912: iOA with big holes through product of OA

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2014-10-14 13:42:57

CC:  vdelecroix

When one multiplies a `OA(k,n1)-OA(k,1)` with an `OA(k,n2)`, one gets an `OA(k,n1.n2)-OA(k,n1)`.

Will be useful for more complicated applications of the Brouwer-van Rees construction later.
