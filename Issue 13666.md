My feeling is increasing that Sage isn't ready yet for #715. I certainly believe that this isn't the fault of #715, but of other parts of Sage. But for me that's irrelevant, what matters to me is that we don't get unexpected segfaults.

The latest segfault is at #13566, even with the new Cython from #13832.

Therefore, I have created this ticket to undo #715 and #11521. At least, it is useful for checking whether a segfault is "caused" by #715 + #11521. I hope it won't be merged (note the milestone).

I'm going to silently close this, it was never really meant to be merged anyway...
