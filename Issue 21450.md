# Issue 21450: Avoid bare "except:" statements

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-10-12 06:40:20

CC:  jmantysalo

Avoid

```
try:
    something()
except:
    ...
```

but catch a specific exception instead (to avoid catching `KeyboardInterrupt` for example).

In some cases, I am replacing

```
try:
    something()
except:
    raise ...
```

by

```
something()
```

since the original exception is often more interesting than the newly raised exception.

Just grepped this, and there are 22 matchec for bare `except:`. 15 files affected.

I can review these.

I can not test `src/mac-app/tools/createDSStore/biplist/__init__.py`, but OTOH can't see what could go wrong with it.

But how do I got


```

? Is there something special about testing this file?

Replying to [comment:4 jmantysalo]:

I don't think that files inside `build/sage_bootstrap` are meant to be doctested. In any case, the file `build/sage_bootstrap/download/cmdline.py` contains no doctests.

OK, then I mark this as positive review.

I changed milestone to 7.5, as 7.4rc0 is already out. I guess this kind of changes won't be closed in rc-phase.
