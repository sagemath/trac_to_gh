CC:  jmantysalo

Avoid

```
try:
    something()
except:
    ...
```

but catch a specific exception instead (to avoid catching `KeyboardInterrupt` for example).

In some cases, I am replacing

```
try:
    something()
except:
    raise ...
```

by

```
something()
```

since the original exception is often more interesting than the newly raised exception.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21687

I can not test `src/mac-app/tools/createDSStore/biplist/__init__.py`, but OTOH can't see what could go wrong with it.

But how do I got


```

I don't think that files inside `build/sage_bootstrap` are meant to be doctested. In any case, the file `build/sage_bootstrap/download/cmdline.py` contains no doctests.

OK, then I mark this as positive review.

I changed milestone to 7.5, as 7.4rc0 is already out. I guess this kind of changes won't be closed in rc-phase.
