This is reported at [this sage-support thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/3bcc16c312bc0561/0cf76194c424c4e3?show_docid=0cf76194c424c4e3).

I think the fix should be the same as at #10244, but for the GraphicsArray class.

Hmm, but that doesn't work...  but it must be a similar issue, anyway.

Adding the suboptions we usually send to save to the normal !Graphics class matplotlib removes the error, but does the following - see attached graphic.  I don't have time to do any more with this now, though.

I should add that my code was slightly simpler:

```
sage: p = plot(x,legend_label='f')
sage: G = graphics_array((p,p))
sage: G
```

This is a bug which might be related:


```
sage: g = Graphics()
sage: g += plot(x,legend_label='f')
sage: g.set_legend_options(title="Nice")
sage: G = graphics_array((g,g))
sage: G.show()
...

It seems that this part of the problem might be completely solved by adding the suboptions usually added when show()'ing a graphics object.

        sage: ga.show(figsize=[5,7])  # tall and thin; long time

        sage: ga.show(figsize=4)  # width=4 inches, height fixed from default aspect ratio
```

as well as in lines 555-613 of `src/sage/plot/multigraphics.py`:
