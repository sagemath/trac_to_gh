# Issue 24980: Fix test regression in banner()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25217

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-04-19 11:54:43

Fixes regression introduced in #25056 that assumes the tests are running without the `SAGE_BANNER` environment variable set to a non-default.

(We should have a better mechanism in general for setting `sage.env` to the default for tests that depend on it)
