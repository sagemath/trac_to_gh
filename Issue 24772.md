CC:  @mkoeppe @miguelmarco @isuruf

The `prime_pi` function is currently a symbolic function that can holds its argument as in

```
sage: n = SR.var('n')
sage: prime_pi(n)
prime_pi(n)
```

that also contains the Cython code for evaluating it

```
sage: prime_pi(13543)
1603
```

We move the evaluation part as a standalone function in `arith/` and provide alternative implementations
- using `PARI/GP` (only efficient in the range of tabulated primes)
- using primecount that is packaged in #24966

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25009

The package `primecount` has been provided with Sage since version 8.3, has been updated several times and is already outdated https://repology.org/project/primecount/versions

Is it time to start using it?

Because `sage.libs.primecount` uses an optional library, in the modularization of sagelib it would have to be split out to a separate package. But since `src/sage/libs/primecount.pxd` and `src/sage/interfaces/primecount.pyx` do not depend on Sage at all (except for a use of `sage.misc.superseded`), it would be best to make it a standalone Python library, like you did with `pplpy`.

reading https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy/-/blob/master/setup.py does not make me wiser, and anyway it's not a good example, as we're building it as a part of sagelib, anyway.

As primecount isn't always available as a system library, there should be some need for configuring paths, etc. 

That all that can be done in 10 minutes is, hmm, a joke.

OK, we actaully should spin off the library primesieve (https://repology.org/project/primesieve/versions) - which is a dependency here, and (by default primecount vendors it, but has an option not to).

Many distros package primesieve separately, so in particular for using system packages it makes perfect sense. (Perhaps primesieve has potentially independent uses in Sage).

We actually have a catch-22 situation - we cannot reliably configure standard packages with `cmake`, as we don't guarantee its presence at the moment.

So cmake must be promoted to a hard pre-requisite.

I don't mind this, though...

OK, here I need a shell programming advice. The problem I don't know how to solve is that cmake triggers an exit if it fails, so it teminates spkg-install script in case of failure. But I just want to know the result, and try something different if it fails.

I hoped something like this would work:

```
primc_config() {
echo "Configuring primecount: building primesieve $1"
sdh_cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON \
          -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=OFF \
          -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
          -DBUILD_TESTS=ON \
          -DBUILD_LIBPRIMESIEVE=$1 \
          -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH=$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/cmake \
          -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY=BOTH \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SAGE_LOCAL \
          ${EXTRA_OPTS} && echo OKOKOK && sdh_make_install
}

set -e
primc_config OFF || primc_config ON
```


but no, if the 1st call to primc_config fails in cmake, it just terminates the script.

It would just feel a bit excessive to do so just for a single function.

And patching the system compiler sounds like a terrible idea.

the compiler is OK in this case, it's STL that it's not.

If I recall correctly, that's how we patched STLs for CGAL back in 1999:

All you need to to is to put `-I foo/bar/` into CXXFLAGS, and put into `foo/bar` a file named `memory`, where one puts `#include <memory>` and an implementation of `align()` inside `namespace std {...}` block.
