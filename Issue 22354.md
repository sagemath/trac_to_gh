CC:  @tscrim

This does not work:

```
sage: A = algebras.FreePreLie(ZZ,1)
sage: x = A.gens()[0]; x
B[[]]
sage: 4/5*x
```

but this should coerce to the free PreLie algebra over QQ.

Same problem with algebras.Free and algebras.FreeZinbiel.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22591

This is because there is not an appropriate construction functor analogous to `PolynomialFunctor`:

```sage
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R.construction()
(Poly[x], Integer Ring)
sage: R.<x,y> = FreeAlgebra(ZZ)
sage: R.construction()
```

I made a tentative for free PreLie algebras. Almost working, it seems.

Maybe we are lacking a category of "linear magmas" or "non associative rings" ?

Sorry for not looking at this in detail sooner. So the pushout construction is working correctly:

```
sage: A = algebras.FreePreLie(ZZ, 'x')
sage: from sage.categories.pushout import pushout
sage: pushout(A, QQ)
Free PreLie algebra on one generator ['x'] over Rational Field
```

However, we have this:

```
sage: coercion_model.analyse(1/2, x)
(['Will try _r_action and _l_action'], None)
```

in contrast to

```
sage: R.<y> = ZZ[]
sage: coercion_model.analyse(1/2, y)
(['Action discovered.',
  Left scalar multiplication by Rational Field on Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Integer Ring],
 Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Rational Field)
```

This is a result of this difference:

```
sage: from sage.structure.coerce_actions import LeftModuleAction
sage: LeftModuleAction(QQ, R, QQ.an_element(), R.an_element())
Left scalar multiplication by Rational Field on Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Integer Ring
sage: LeftModuleAction(QQ, A, QQ.an_element(), A.an_element())

This is worked around by #23440. However, I think the proper fix is to not check `isinstance(a, ModuleElement)`, but instead for its parent `S` to be in the category of modules.

Really this should be done for CFM, but that one is too much of a base class and inheriting `construction()` would almost certainly cause too many (subtle) problems. Plus considering how the functors are implemented, it almost certainly is best to do this on a case-by-case basis.

I do not have this for polynomials:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: S.<a,b,c> = QQ[]
sage: x + a
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for +: ...

So I think we should simply remove these tests.

This is ultimately the same problem when doing

```
sage: 1/2 * x

So I think the issue is you cannot simply stack the functors in this case, at least with how we are defining our functor. In other words, `PreLie(PreLie(QQ, 'x'), 'y')` does not make sense because `PreLie(QQ, 'x')` is not a ring (as the error message indicates). Actually, is

```
PreLie(PreLie(QQ, 'x'), 'y') [isomorphic] PreLie(QQ, 'x,y')
```

true? I think we might need to do something a little different and more careful than the polynomial functors do. I'm not sure exactly what that is yet.

So, there is something problematic here. I must admit that I do not understand enough of all this to investigate.

I would say that

```
PreLie(PreLie(QQ, 'x'), 'y') [isomorphic] PreLie(QQ, 'x,y')
```

make no sense, because `PreLie(QQ, 'x'), 'y')` is not a ring.

What is true (and comes from the operad structure) is that there is a natural "product map" from the free Pre-Lie algebra generated by a free pre-Lie algebra on V to the free pre-Lie algebra on V. Think of the natural product map from T(T(V)) to T(V). But maybe this is not so pertinent for the problem at stake.
