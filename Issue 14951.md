# Issue 14951: quo_rem incorret for p-adic polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15188

The current implementation of `quo_rem` for p-adic polynomials does not guarantee a remainder with degree less than that of the divisor:

```
sage: R.<x> = Qp(3)[]
sage: x.quo_rem(x)
((1 + O(3^20)), (O(3^20))*x)
```

These leading zero coefficients cause problems, e.g., in #13662.

seems fixed. Add a test and then ask for review?

Yes. It seems that `degree()` is now aware of leading zero coefficients.

It also seems to work for capped absolute. I have not checked much there since capped absolute has no special implementation of polynomials which is aware of precision issues.
