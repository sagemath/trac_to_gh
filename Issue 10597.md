The documentation of the class sage.calculus.riemann.ColorPlot

They are two leading :: which may be the cause of the problem.

The double colon "::" should immediately follow the section title "EXAMPLES". Thus we should have


```
class ColorPlot(GraphicPrimitive):
    """                                                                         
    The GraphicsPrimitive to display complex functions in using the domain      
        coloring method                                                         
                                                                                
    INPUT:                                                                      
                                                                                
        - ``z_values`` -- An array of complex values to be plotted.             
                                                                                
        - ``x_range`` -- A minimum and maximum x value for the plot.
