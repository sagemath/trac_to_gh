I'm reading your code. That's awesome. Great job!

I have a very general comment. Currently we have many many classes for p-adic parents. Shouldn't we try to factor more code? Actually I would be quite radical and propose to keep only the classes `pAdicExtensionRingGeneric` and `pAdicExtensionFieldGeneric` (and let the `__init__` function handle the rest)... but certainly you guys will have good arguments against this proposal.

I agree about reducing the number of parent classes.  I think it's a mess right now, and I wouldn't mind just having `pAdicExtension` (combining ring and field).  But I would say that should be a topic for another ticket.
