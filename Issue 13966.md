This (from `sage-spkg`) is not how `make` is supposed to be used:

```
if [ $INFO -eq 0 -a $FORCE -eq 0 -a -f "$INSTALLED/$PKG_NAME" ]; then
    echo "Package $PKG_NAME is already installed."
    echo "Use 'sage -f $PKG_SRC' to force a reinstallation."
    # Touch installed file such that "make" considers it up-to-date.
    touch "$INSTALLED/$PKG_NAME"
    exit 0
fi
```


When nothing has to be done, you're supposed to do nothing. Touching files may trigger other rebuilds,...

If `make` considers the file not up-to-date, touching is the right thing to do. Close as invalid.
