Keywords: Links-Gould polynomial knots links

At the moment there doesn't seem to be any public available calculator for this invariant. We will implement it straight forward according to the definition given in [A CUBIC DEFINING ALGEBRA FOR THE LINKS-GOULD POLYNOMIAL by Marin and Wagner](http://www.lamfa.u-picardie.fr/marin/arts/LG.pdf), section 3. Calculations are done on matrices over the symbolic ring since square-roots of 2 variate Laurent polynomials are involved. As the dimension of these matrices are given by `4^num_strands` the performance slows down accordingly.

In a second step we could try to figure out if the approach followed in [a 2013 paper of David de Witt](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9906059.pdf) would improve performance.

Some examples: On an `i7` CPU calculation for 3 strand braids is a matter of a few seconds for 4 strand braids it will take some minutes whereas for 5 strand braids hours will be needed (5 Minutes of that just for setting up the representation matrices). For example for `K8_1` you'll need between two and three hours. Braids with six or more strands are excluded in the above mentioned paper of David de Witt, as well.

Maybe I don't understand your idea exactly. I've tried to use a quotient ring over a three variate polynomial ring the third variable of which corresponding to the term abbreviated `Y` in Ivan Marin's paper. At the moment I don't have access to my notes about that, since I'm on vacation. But this was even slower than using the symbolic ring.

I am not suggesting that. In the description, you say you use `SR` since for the Laurent polynomial ring variables "x,y", you use x<sup>1/2</sup> and y<sup>1/2</sup> in the computations.

No problem. Enjoy your vacation.

I would have the internal cached method use fixed variable names and then do a substitution for different user input to not redo the computation just because the variable names change.

Also, typo: `beeing`.

It's not just squares of the variables, there are also squares of non monomial Laurent polynomials (see the `Y`). Apparently it's a non-trivial fact that the result always simplifies to Laurent polynomials.

Anyway, I will think about this once again, when I'm back home. Thanks for looking at the ticket!

Travis, you are right! Indeed, the quotient ring  leads to a faster implementation. It seems that I didn't use sparse matrices for this ring in my former tests (note that for symbolics there is no proper sparse implementation and thus dense matrices perform better in this setting).

Nevertheless I keep the usage of the symbolic ring as a second implementation option, since it might be useful for cross checks and verifications.

Sorry for taking so long to get to this.

I am glad you were able to speed it up. How does it compare to doing computations in

```python
            LC = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ, 's0r, s1r')
            s0r, s1r = LC.gens()
            LR = PolynomialRing(LC 'Yr')
            Yr = LR.gen()
            pqr = Yr**2 + (s0r**2-1)*(s1r**2 -1)
```

This way it is the quotient ring of a *univariate* polynomial ring. I would think working with quotients there would be faster since the data type is more simple.

Also, I would have

```python
def links_gould_polynomial(self, varnames=None, use_symbolics=False):
    if varnames is not None:
         poly = links_gould_polynomial(use_symbolics=use_symbolics)
         R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, varnames)
         t0, t1 = R.gens()
         return poly(t0=t0, t1=t1)
    varnames = 't0, t1'
```

to not do the full computation again when only the variable names have changed.

Many thanks for this useful suggestion. Once again, I could achieve a remarkable improvement of performance with it. The calculation for knot K10_1 which didn't terminate using symbolics within a day, now needs 22 minutes. With the former quotient ring version it has been 4 hours.

Furthermore, I now could successfully run a crosscheck over all links listed in the KnotInfo and LinkInfo databases having less than 5 strands (3342 in sum) against the according specialization of the formal Markov trace on the cubic Hecke algebra (see method `formal_markov_trace` of class `CubicHeckeElement` in ticket #29717) in less than 5.5 hours.

This is done now, as well!

BTW: You may have asked why I wrote `(R1*R2*R1 - R2*R1*R2).is_zero())` before. The reason was that comparison in quotient rings over multivariate Laurent polynomial rings doesn't work. I will open a corresponding ticket about that, soon.
