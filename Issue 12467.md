# Issue 12467: The sage-env script doesn't respect PYTHONPATH

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12639

Original creator: Snark

Original creation time: 2012-03-07 12:43:08

Assignee: leif

I was hacking happily in python in a directory. Then I decided I wanted to use that code with sage, and set PYTHONPATH to point to it. And sage still didn't find it...

The reason is that sage-env overwrites PYTHONPATH instead of prepending to it.

Replying to [comment:2 mhansen]:
> See #3784

In more detail: first, use `SAGE_PATH` for this rather than `PYTHONPATH`. Second, this ticket should probably be closed as invalid or as a duplicate of #3784.

Needs info from reporter if SAGE_PATH solves his problem.
