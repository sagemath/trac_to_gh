Hello!
I have implemented the computation of the local clustering coefficient through Boost. The improvement is not as striking as the edge connectivity, but it is still a 10x improvement, more or less. Some benchmarks:


```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNM(20000,100000)
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='boost')
10 loops, best of 3: 258 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='networkx')
1 loops, best of 3: 3.99 s per loop
```


```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(300)
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='boost')
1 loops, best of 3: 6.14 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='networkx')
1 loops, best of 3: 1min 3s per loop
```


```
sage: g = graphs.RandomGNM(10000,1000000)
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='networkx',nodes=range(30))
1 loops, best of 3: 13.1 s per loop
sage: %timeit g.clustering_coeff(implementation='boost',nodes=range(30))
1 loops, best of 3: 1.55 s per loop
```

I hope you like it!

Hellooooooo Michele,

- About `boost_clustering_coeff` -- to me it makes more sense if this function,
  meant to apply to a boost graph, does not take a Sage graph as input. You only
  need it to get the vertices' correct label, but you only need this at a higher
  level. Returning a dictionary associating the coeffcient to each (integer)
  vertex is not very expensive considering the computations you do, and so you
  can afford to relabel it higher.

- Could you define "local clustering" somewhere? Is it any different from the
  'clustering coefficient of a vertex'?

- Could you add an INPUT block to `cpdef clustering_coeff`?

- Same function -- by using a `sig_check` instead of `sig_on/off` it is
  impossible to interrupt the function while `boost_resulting_coeff` is
  running. It will only be interrupted when the function returns.

- Could you rename 'cc' to 'average_clustering_coefficient'? When you need a
  comment to say what a variable is, it often means that you should rename the
  variable.

- in `clustering_average` -- could you document the default behaviour of
  `implementation=None`? (you did it in `clustering_coeff` already).

- You should not indent the *text* after a 'TESTS:' block (like it is done for
  'INPUT:'). Usually, you only need to indent text in the documentation after a
  '::'.

- Instead of `weight==False`, it is better to use 'not weight'. Handles better
  something like `weight=0` (faster to type `:-P`)

Looks very good!

Thanks,

Nathann

Hello,

I have not checked the code yet.

Nathann, I have an old code using bitsets for speeding up intersection of neighborhoods. I can update it using static dense graph and see if it is a good competitor ;)
The idea is to compute the number of triangles incident to each edge, and then to compute the number of triangles incident to a given vertex.

David.

Oops, I wrote it like this to test if it worked, and I forgot to change it. By solving this issue, I also have found problems if the vertex label is not an integer, I corrected it, and I added a doctest.

It is exactly the same (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient#Local_clustering_coefficient): I decided to remove "local" from all comments.

>

Done!

Done! Now I use sig_on/off.

Hello Michele,

Thanks for your updates. I added a commit at public/18811, and if you agree with it then you can add it to the branch and this ticket can go.

Here are the modifications I made:
- remove trailing whitespaces
- The function `boost_clustering_coeff` claimed to accept 'None' as a list of vertices, but did not
- `len(clust_of_v.values())` is equal to `len(clust_of_v)`
- `{g.vertices()[v]: clust_v_int[v] for v in vertices_boost`} this line calls `g.vertices()` for each `[v]`.
- You can use 'tolerance' for tests like `sage: abs(G.clustering_average(implementation='boost') - G.clustering_average(implementation='networkx')) < 1E-12`

Have fuuuuuuuuun,

Nathann

Hey nononon! I had changed the code to handle the 'None' case! Do whatever you want, but please keep the code and the doc consistent.

Sorry, I didn't realize you modified the code... That's why I modified the doc, I thought you forgot a commit, or something like that. In my opinion, it is better to modify the doc, for simplicity!

BTW, how can I use 'tolerance' in the other test?


```
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNM(10,20)
sage: clust_boost = G.clustering_coeff(implementation='boost')
sage: clust_networkx = G.clustering_coeff(implementation='networkx')
sage: for v in G.vertices():
....:     if abs(clust_boost[v] - clust_networkx[v]) > 1E-12:
....:         print "Error:"
....:         print "   Boost clustering of", v, "is", clust_boost[v]
....:         print "NetworkX clustering of", v, "is", clust_networkx[v]

```

Helloooooo,

No problem for me. But please update the code too, in this case.

I think that it could work by adding the same 'tol' flag on all lnes of the loop. Not sure, you have to try `^^;`

OOOppss nononono sorry. Given that your doctest does not print anything when it works, I'd say that it is easier to understand it this way. Otherwise you would have to add lines and lines of useless '0'.

By the way, you can write 'for v in G' instead of 'for v in G.vertices()'.

Have fuuuuun,
