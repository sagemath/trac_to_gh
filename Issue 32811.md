# Issue 32811: Update setuptools to 59.8.0

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33048

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2021-12-20 03:45:07

https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/history.html#v59-8-0

60.0.0 will again use `SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib`; we will avoid it until `setuptools` has adopted all necessary patches for Cygwin.
