README.txt doesn't say anything about how to make Sage accessible to multiple users; it should.  (Perhaps it could copy text from the installation guide, http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html#installation-in-a-multiuser-environment)

I must be reading all the same tickets as you... Yes, the exact thing proposed above was implemented at some point.
