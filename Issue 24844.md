Keywords: polytope, polar, IMA-PolyGeom

Currently, sage does not carry the backend used when creating the polar polyhedron object.

For consistency, it would make sense that sage tries to keep the backend used by self.

sounds reasonable; do all backends that can handle ZZ, also can handle QQ?

Yes; there is no real difference between `ZZ` and `QQ` at the backend level. The difference between a `ZZ` polyhedron and `QQ` polyhedron inside sage is somewhat artificial.
