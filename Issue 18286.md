maybe rather put the import inside the method (without lazy) ?

and the tests do not pass..

Can I set "positive review" on a ticket where I contributed, or does etiquette require that someone else do so?

Yes, yes, this is how things are going quite often:

you propose a simple ticket, I read it, make only small modifications to your code.
Being happy with your code, I propose you to check my small changes.

You will then set "positive review" on my behalf. By this, you simply say that you agree with my small changes, and I have declared before that I am happy with the overall result.

So, please go on.
