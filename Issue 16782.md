Keywords: docstring, preparse

Running ./sage --preparse on a .sage produces a .py file such that this is a proper Python file. If the .sage file contains a module docstring, then this should be present as the module docstring of the resulting .py file. This means that no code-lines (non-comment, non-blank) may be added before this module docstring.

There are some lines to handle this in sage-preparse. However, it is not handled properly, as a call to sage.misc.preparse.preparse_file earlier on might already then add some lines before the original docstring.

There are doctest (even for `sage-preparse`) in `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py` and I think you should add a doctest for this (needs_work because of this).

I'm sorry but I'm completely lost in these branches. I'm working on branch t/17019/ticket/17019 but if I try to push with **git push trac t/17019/ticket/17019**, I get the following error


```
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: FATAL: W refs/heads/t/17019/ticket/17019 sage jsrn DENIED by fallthru

error: failed to push some refs to 'git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git'
```


If I try to push with **git trac push**, it works fine but pushes to **u/jsrn/ticket/17019**, which doesn't seem to put my code into this ticket (but it does add the message "Branch changed from bla-bla-bla" which appears twice above).

What do I do?

Ok, now I'm really confused: with 6 minutes delay the commit came through??? Did I do it right or was I just lucky and abusive towards the system?

I'm reviving this: Sage has displayed the doc-mangling behaviour after preprocessing in more or less all releases since this ticket was last discussed, possibly except the one Jeroen tested on a year ago. I don't know why that was.

At least, I've just tested that the doctest in this ticket fails if it's tested on the current beta, and that this patch fixes it.
