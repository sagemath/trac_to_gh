# Issue 16782: preparser for .sage files no longer respects module docstrings

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jsrn

Original creation time: 2014-09-20 19:16:12

Keywords: docstring, preparse

Running ./sage --preparse on a .sage produces a .py file such that this is a proper Python file. If the .sage file contains a module docstring, then this should be present as the module docstring of the resulting .py file. This means that no code-lines (non-comment, non-blank) may be added before this module docstring.

There are some lines to handle this in sage-preparse. However, it is not handled properly, as a call to sage.misc.preparse.preparse_file earlier on might already then add some lines before the original docstring.

Since the patch is on a python file outside the usual Sage tree, I am not aware of doc-test rules etc. I wouldn't even know how to make a doctest for this (and there are no other doctests in sage-preparse).

There are doctest (even for `sage-preparse`) in `src/sage/tests/cmdline.py` and I think you should add a doctest for this (needs_work because of this).

Also, you don't need an additional

```
from sage.misc.preparser import preparse_file
```

Ok, I've added a doctest for this.

The Build-bot's doctests failing is in some numerical stability tests, and seem to have nothing to do with this patch.

Sorry to bother again, but you should rebase this over #16955.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2014-09-25 11:30:59

...and instead of adding a completely new doctest, why not simply change the old test for `sage --preparse`?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2014-09-25 11:34:38

You removed support for `coding`.

I tried to do the rebase, but the instructions in the documentation were not clear to me on this use-case. Did I do it right?

I don't know what you mean with "removed support for `coding`".

I added a new doctest instead of making the old one bigger because I didn't want the old one to be too large and confusing (as it is, it is hard to read). In the new doc-test is an `import inspect` and a strange line printing out the doc string.

I guess so, at least I don't see anything obviously bad.

grep `src/bin/sage-preparse` for `coding` and you will see what I mean.

Good catch with the coding line. I reinstated it, and added it to the doctest.

I also simplified the doctest and simply examine the produced file directly instead of doing strange reflection stuff.

I think the doctest is not good enough, since it passes even _without the changes_ to `sage-preparse`. If you want to convince me that this ticket is needed, show me a doctest which failed before and passes now.

No need to get snappy -- obviously the problem was there or I wouldn't waste my time on this. It seems, however, that somewhere between 6.2 and 6.3 the generation of the _sage_const_X lines were moved, and this presents an alternative solution to the problem (those lines were previously put before the module doc-string).

Now for this ticket: the change in sage-preparse could be rolled back since it is not necessary for the moment. The doc-test changes could be retained since it actually tests something which was not tested before. The latest test that you saw was however rather silly, since I forgot to reinstate a constant in the code after I merged the two doctests into one. I've fixed the doc test...

I didn't say the changes were bad, in fact I do think they make sense. I only said that I could not check whether they solved the problem mentioned in this ticket.

Then please push your branch...

Also: can you update the ticket description please, since the problem is no longer applicable.

I'm sorry but I'm completely lost in these branches. I'm working on branch t/17019/ticket/17019 but if I try to push with *git push trac t/17019/ticket/17019*, I get the following error


```
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)

```


If I try to push with *git trac push*, it works fine but pushes to *u/jsrn/ticket/17019*, which doesn't seem to put my code into this ticket (but it does add the message "Branch changed from bla-bla-bla" which appears twice above).

What do I do?

Ok, now I'm really confused: with 6 minutes delay the commit came through??? Did I do it right or was I just lucky and abusive towards the system?

I'm reviving this: Sage has displayed the doc-mangling behaviour after preprocessing in more or less all releases since this ticket was last discussed, possibly except the one Jeroen tested on a year ago. I don't know why that was.

At least, I've just tested that the doctest in this ticket fails if it's tested on the current beta, and that this patch fixes it.
