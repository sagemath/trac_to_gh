... in particular the free modules 
- generated by all polyhedra
- generated by all lower-dimensional polyhedra
- generated by all polyhedra with lines

Via #19448, all finitely generated formal polyhedra modules can be expressed as submodules.

Wondering if I should expect that modules generated by subfamilies of some basis coerce into the module generated by the basis.

Or perhaps I should be constructing every module explicitly as a submodule of the ambient infinite-dimensional module?
