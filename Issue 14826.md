This patch series brings the French translation of the tutorial up to date with the English version as of 2a7ddf97856d72e40423231e238b1e7eca5d67fa. Or at least I think so: apparently it has happened in the past that changes to the English version went unnoticed. I followed the git history to make my changes, so I shouldn't have missed anything, but who knows.

The translation is a bit rough at places, and reviewer patches to improve the style are of course welcome, but I think is better to ship an imperfect translation than none at all!

Yes and no. The translation incorporates the changes suggested in #15062, but it can still be reviewed independently and rebased on an independent branch if needed.

Hellooooooooooo !

I agree with these commits, though you seem to have based them on an old version of Sage  `O_o`

I rebased them on `[FIXUP] 5.12.beta1: update git specific files`, and added my commit at the top. Nonimportant stuff only, plus a paragraph that was missing.

It's all at u/ncohen/15063, and I think that you should now import from there what you like `:-)`

Anyway, if you agree with this last commit, you can update your branch and set the ticket to  positive_review`

Hi Nathann,

Thanks for the review!

I'd rather not rebase the branch, so I just cherry-picked your commit.

> Nonimportant stuff only, plus a paragraph that was missing.

That was actually intentional, though I forgot to mention it on the ticket: I find this paragraph redundant and created #15048 to suggest removing it. But since you translated it, let's keep it for now.

> Anyway, if you agree with this last commit, you can update your branch and set the ticket to  positive_review`

In the meantime I noticed some junk I pasted by mistake in the middle of an example. Another example needs  to be updated due to changes merged in 5.12Î²3. Here are two more trivial patches to fix these issues; I'll let you set the ticket to `positive_review` after having a quick look it that's okay with you.

Ahahah. Funny. My version of Sage got upgraded while reviewing your branch, as I was using 5.12.beta3 and your patch is based on 5.12.beta3 `:-)`

Okayyyyyyyy ! I don't remember what I did with this ticket, but in the meantime I have been told that rebasing was a bad habit and that I should merge the ticket with a later version of Sage instead so that the former commit are not changed `:-)`
