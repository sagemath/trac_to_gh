This iteration looks good to me, Chris.  Positive review!

There is a problem with the patch: applies cleanly, builds fine, but I got an import error on startup:

```
ImportError: No module named nil_coxeter_algebra
```

Chris, perhaps you forgot to add your `nil_coxeter_algebra.py` file to the patch?

For the latest patch, all doctests pass, and coverage is at 100%.

But, I think there will be a problem building the documentation unless the following line in algebra.rst is updated appropriately: 

```
../sage/algebras/nil_coxeter
```

Thanks Franco for the report! This should be fixed now. 

Chris, I also modified the documentation of the k_schur_noncommutative_variables, since it now only works for affine type A, but the documentation had not been updated.

I set it back to positive review since all issues were fixed.

I fixed one more unnecessary import from WeylGroups in the patch and posted the new version.
