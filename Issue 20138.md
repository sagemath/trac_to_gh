Using `fmpz_mat_is_one` directly from FLINT the code gets faster

Before

```
sage: m = matrix(2, [1,0,0,1])
sage: %timeit m.is_one()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 638 ns per loop
```

After

```
sage: %timeit m.is_one()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 137 ns per loop
```

You probably want to declare `fmpz_mat_is_one` as `bint` and remove the comparison withÂ 1.

Not sure. `fmpz_mat_is_zero` is also declared as `int`.

Are we allowed to change `int -> bint` inside the `pxd` header?

I'm not sure I understand your question. In new bindings, as far as I understand, it is always better to use `bint` for `int`s that actually represent boolean values.
