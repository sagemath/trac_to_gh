# Issue 12502: permutation length and size

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vferay

Original creation time: 2012-03-15 16:52:52

Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: permutation

the method 'length' of permutations returns the Coxeter length and not the length of the permutation as a word (which is the most natural notion of length for some part of the community). This is not a problem but this is not precised in the documentation and in the example given, the two notions of length match!

I will write a small patch to change the example and add another method 'size'

Valentin, your patch doesn't have a username.  Probably you need to create a `.hgrc` file: follow the instructions at step 3 from [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#submitting-a-change](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#submitting-a-change).  Then recreate the patch and reupload it.
