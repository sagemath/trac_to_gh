# Issue 16513: libgap fails converting string GapElements to Sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16750

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-08-02 09:29:44

Keywords: conversion, string

This blocks combinatorial usage of libgap (see #16719):

```
sage: ans=libgap.eval("'c'")
sage: type(ans)
<type 'sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement'>
sage: ans.sage()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-3aef44f215a1> in <module>()
----> 1 ans.sage()

/home/ralf/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/libs/gap/element.so in sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement.sage (build/cythonized/sage/libs/gap/element.c:8749)()
```

To convert datatypes are supposed to use

```
sage: gap_string = libgap('sage_string')
sage: gap_string.sage()
'sage_string'
```

and not the eval() form. Though I agree that there is a bug in the eval().

The single quote is a single character constant in GAP. There is no single-character type in Python...

```
sage: libgap.eval("'ca'")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 libgap.eval("'ca'")

Looks straightforward. I do not think any other doctest is affected so I spare me a patchbot run.

Holding back for just a moment, as I'm no longer sure it's ok.

The `sage()` member function of `T_CHAR` will be passed to parent because no `T_CHAR` child is implemented.

```
sage: ans=libgap.eval("UnorderedTuples(['a', 'b', 'c'],2)"); ans
[ "aa", "ab", "ac", "bb", "bc", "cc" ]
sage: a=ans[0]; a
"aa"
sage: a[0]
'a'
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement'>
sage: a[0]._type_number()
(9L, 'T_CHAR')
sage: a[0].sage()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<ipython-input-50-b805c595d1a5>", line 1, in <module>
    a[Integer(0)].sage()
  File "element.pyx", line 1024, in sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement.sage (build/cythonized/sage/libs/gap/element.c:8749)
NotImplementedError: cannot construct equivalent Sage object
```

I have changed your patch according to my belief what went wrong. If you disagree then, well, fix it yourself 8)

I read some more of the GAP String code and its pretty complicated with different string representations. I've replaced your commit. This also fixes the string convertion issue you noted on the other ticket. Can you give it at try?

ptestlong:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/groups/braid.py  # 5 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/groups/finitely_presented.py  # 25 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/groups/finitely_presented_named.py  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/groups/libgap_mixin.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref2/refinement_generic.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/groups/raag.py  # 16 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/groups/libgap_wrapper.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
```

Appears to go back to a single fail.

Fails in new files:

It does? I remembered to run tests this time and it works for me. Can you post the error?


---

Comment by rws created at 2014-08-06 06:18:11

Don't know what *that was, it passes now after checking out a different branch, compiling, and back again.

Anyway, it all looks good.
