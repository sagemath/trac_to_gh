Note that without this patch, `sage-cleaner` keeps writing this to the log file:

```
Checking PIDs [36850]
Process 36850 is no longer running, so we clean up
Deleting /Users/palmieri/.sage/temp/jpalmieri/36850
```

without successfully deleting the directory. So after a while, the log file is quite large, the directory is still there, and `sage-cleaner` is still running.
