Green bot, please review. This may be convenient for sage days 107, so a swift review would be nice. But maybe it's already too late..

I think it would be good to do this a more Pythonic way:

```diff
-faces_iter = faces.__iter__()
+faces_iter = iter(faces)
```

Other than that, LGTM. So once changed, you can set a positive review.
