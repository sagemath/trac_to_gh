# Issue 27322: py3: maxint to maxsize in cryptominisat interface

Keywords: python3, maxint

The  `from sys import maxint` in `src/sage/sat/solvers/cryptominisat.py`
makes cryptominisat optional doctests fail with Python 3.

Changing `maxint` to `maxsize` would probably solve the problem.

Changing keywords from "python3, maxint" to "python3, maxint, beginner".

Easy ticket, probably suitable for a beginner. One needs to install SageMath
and the optional package cryptominisat, and to run tests including optional
tests for cryptominisat.

It would also be cleaner to `import sys` at the top level of that file instead of inside `__init__`.
