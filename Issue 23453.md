# Issue 23453: codimension() for free submodules

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Free (sub)modules have a `dimension()` and a `degree()` which is the dimension of the ambient space. To complement this, there should be `codimension()` which is the difference between these two.

You have some proof-of-concept code in `expression.pyx`. LGTM otherwise.
