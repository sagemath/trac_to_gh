# Issue 15572: Compile Denis Simon's scripts with gp2c

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The scripts have been combined into one and revised to make the gp2c-compliant, and gp2c has been used to make a single C file from them.  This can be compiled (once, on building Sage) into a shared library file which can then be used in a GP session, the result being faster running of all the functions.

Are we sure that this would yield a significant speed-up? I have not profiled this at all, but if most of the time is spent in PARI functions like `bnfinit()`, then gp2c will not help.

Obviously needs to be reworked insofar as how the build steps fit in, but looks like a good idea otherwise.  It would also be good to incorporate Tim Dokchitser's script `src/ext/pari/dokchitser/computel.gp`.  This would probably enable rewriting `sage.lfunctions.dokchitser` to use the pari interface instead of gp+pexpect; see #22718.

I might take a stab at this if Jeroen doesn't get a chance first.
