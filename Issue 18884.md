Keywords: poset


```
Posets.PentagonPoset().connected_components()
```


should return `[Finite poset containing 5 elements]`, not `Finite lattice containing 5 elements`.

For a (semi)lattice this will return 1-element list that contains the (semi)lattice. But anyways, a lattice is a poset.

Do you think it is worthwhile overriding this method in those classes as an optimization?

Also I suspect doctests will need to be updated accordingly; specifically, `CC is P` should be `False`.

No. I think that #18776 is what could and should be done as an optimization. Changing for example `is_bounded()` to a function just returning `True` in lattices is of little value. It is different thing if there is faster way to compute, say, `dimension()`, on lattices than on general posets.

Corrected this. (To `CC[0] is P`.) Maybe it should be on `TESTS`-section. But at least now this works.

Ready for review.

Ping... This should be quite easy to review.

Sorry, slipped off my radar. LGTM. (For the record, I disagree with stating things like "this poset" vs "self", but it's too close to bikeshedding.)

Thanks.

Being bikeshedding or not depens on the user/developer -ratio. More basic level users, more need for unified user interface.
