```
Posets.PentagonPoset().connected_components()

For a (semi)lattice this will return 1-element list that contains the (semi)lattice. But anyways, a lattice is a poset.

Changing for example `is_bounded()` to a function just returning `True` in lattices is of little value. It is different thing if there is faster way to compute, say, `dimension()`, on lattices than on general posets.",

Corrected this. (To `CC[0] is P`.) Maybe it should be on `TESTS`-section. But at least now this works.

Ready for review.

Being bikeshedding or not depens on the user/developer -ratio. More basic level users, more need for unified user interface.
