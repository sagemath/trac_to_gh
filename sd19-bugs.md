## Now Available

If you've tried a ticket and don't want to work on it anymore, drop it in here so other people know it's open. (The first bunch of these are leftover from SD12!)

 #3517, #3426, #3543, #1534, #5153 (for Cremona), #6279, #128 (this code is a mess. It needs urgent love from someone with authority and knowledge of constructor conventions), #7496, #6810

#7377 (Maxima/ECL interface -- lots of help needed and received. Great progress has been made. More is needed.)
