Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: bell number

For large n values use the formula: bell(n)=exp(-1)*sum(k=0,infinity,k**n/k!)

Currently my code beats all known implementations, also sage's code which wraps GAP's Bell is slow and using lots of memory, and unable to compute bell_number(n) if n is large.

Some timings on Amd 2.1 GHz:

n       time (Wall time)

300     0.01 sec.

1000    0.03 sec.

3000    0.18 sec.

10000   2.88 sec.

30000   46.79 sec.

100000  819.37 sec.

Compare these with another programs:

Hello and thanks for the patch!  I'm curious, have you compared your solution with wrapping mpmath directly?  For example,


``` 
sage: import mpmath
sage: mpmath.bell?
```


Also, this ticket is basically a dup of #7812, so one of these (maybe that one, since this has a patch) should be closed.  

Finally, don't forget to set the status as 'needs_review' once you've added a patch!

Thanks,
Jason

Yes, but times are not saved I will rerun them: here are the timings for mpmath:

n  time (Wall time)

300 0.02 sec.

1000 0.06 sec.

3000 0.41 sec.

10000 10.26 sec.

30000 168.27 sec.

100000 (still computing)

So here mpmath is about 2-4 times slower, and seems that using more memory than my code.
