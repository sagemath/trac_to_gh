some minor comments:

* you may also want to point to "blocks_and_cuts_tree" in the SEE ALSO

* the first line of a function "Return something of interest." should end with a dot

* and the verb in the first line should take no s ("Test if something is something.")

I'm always confused with that with or without dot. done

done 

Thanks.

I have corrected the link to incidence structures in the see also section and added an example with recognition methods.

One sentence sounds wrong:

```
Every biconnected components of a block graph are cliques
```

Comment by dcoudert created at 2017-05-24 20:39:22

Should be correct, but I can replace it by "Each biconnected component of a block graph is a clique" ou "All biconnected components of a block graph are cliques".

I have apparently been able to fix my error. I'm always having hard time with git... The branch is now in public.
I also tried to fix the grammar issues.
