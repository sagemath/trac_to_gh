Keywords: crystals speedup

In order to speed up many of the crystals computations, I'm proposing the following:

- Cythonize `CrystalOfLetters`
- Instead of e, f, epsilon, phi checking the index set each time, these functions will check to make sure i is in the index set, then call _e, _f, _epsilon, _phi which assume i is valid input and respectively call the private methods.
- Make index_set a cached method. Subsequently this requires it to be returned as a tuple instead of a list
