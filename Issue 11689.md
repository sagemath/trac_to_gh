# Issue 11689: Saturation of ideals

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11861

Original creator: dangtuanhiep

Assignee: malb

Keywords: saturation, ideal, sd34

Returns the saturation of ideal with respect to another ideal.
EXAMPLE:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(x^5*z^3,x*y*z,y*z^4)
sage: J = R.ideal(z)
sage: I.saturation(J)
Ideal (y, x^5) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field
```

Nice addition, I will use this method a lot.

Some comments:

- I cannot apply the patch cleanly agains Sage 4.7.1 Which version are you using?

- I think that having two separate functions is inefficient. Computing saturations    is very expensive. Many people computing the saturation index will probably want the saturation ideal as well. In this case they would need to compute the saturation twice. I think it is better to add only one method that returns the answer from Singular. A tuple whose first element is the saturation ideal and the second element the saturation index.

- I suggest to improve the documentation. Some indication that `arg` is an ideal, what is the saturation of two ideals and the saturation index.

- I am not sure how to deal with the rings that Singular does not understand. We will probably get a TypeError exception on those. Probably a NonImplementedError would make more sense here.

Otherwise, ``@`cached_method` is your friend :)

Agred, the parameters are not documented at all, `INPUT:` block etc.

Yes, but I would try to avoid caching structures that can easily eat all your memory.

New version, returns a tuple with both the ideal and the index.

Made a new patch (to be applied directly to a clean version of sage), that returns a tuple with both the saturation ideal and the saturation index.
