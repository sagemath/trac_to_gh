I'm a little nervous about this method being called `QuaternionicProjectivePlane` when it is not known whether the space is actually the quaternionic projective plane: people might be misled. Can you think of another name for it?

Well, there is a big warning in the doc. Do you really think any user will use that without reading the doc ? I would prefer to keep the current name. Otherwise, maybe

* NotQuaternionicProjectivePlane (bad)

* BrehmKuhnelEightfold (bad)

* ManifoldLikeQuaternionicProjectivePlane (not very good)

Would you have any better suggestions ?
