# Issue 13740: quaternionic projective plane

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: chapoton

Original creation time: 2013-01-11 16:48:47

Assignee: jhpalmieri

Keywords: simplicial complex

There exists a conjectural triangulation of the projective plane over the ring of quaternions, with 15 vertices and 490 facets. This patch implements that as a simplicial complex.

Hellooooooooo !! Well, this one's good to go, short of an example that can now be written thanks to #13943. Oh, and I also reformatted the list of simplices a bit, so that it matches its description in the paper. Only superfical stuff `:-)`

If you agree with this reviewer's patch, then you can set the ticket to `positive_review`.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun !

I'm a little nervous about this method being called `QuaternionicProjectivePlane` when it is not known whether the space is actually the quaternionic projective plane: people might be misled. Can you think of another name for it?

Well, there is a big warning in the doc. Do you really think any user will use that without reading the doc ? I would prefer to keep the current name. Otherwise, maybe

* NotQuaternionicProjectivePlane (bad)

* BrehmKuhnelEightfold (bad)

* ManifoldLikeQuaternionicProjectivePlane (not very good)

Would you have any better suggestions ?

`PseudoQuaternionicProjectivePlane`? `QuaternionicProjectivePlane_conjectured`? I can certainly imagine someone finding the method using tab-completion and not reading the docstring for it, especially if they have in the past looked at documentation for `RealProjectivePlane` and `ComplexProjectivePlane`.

Attachment

I have renamed the function to PseudoQuaternionicProjectivePlane

and folded the review patch

apply only trac-13944-quaternion-plane-fc.patch

The name is fine with me. This already had a positive review, so I'll restore that.
