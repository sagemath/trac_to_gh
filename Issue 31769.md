We need to make the analogous changes in other languages. I can do Spanish and Japanese. That leaves German, French, Portuguese, and Russian. With some help from Google, I can manage the first three. I can ask someone else for the Russian. Although I won't be able to do this until next week.

Here are my attempts at German and French. The Spanish one is arranged differently from the others: no separate bibliography file, for example. I don't know why. If you can handle Japanese, note that there is a translation of some of the Python documentation at https://docs.python.org/ja/3/, if you want to provide language-specific links. (Found at https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0545/.)

I did the Spanish and Japanese. I just fed stuff to Google for the Portuguese and Russian. I asked someone to check my Japanese. I can also do that for the Russian. I don't know anyone who speaks Portuguese however, but it looks correct from the Spanish similarities.

I got confirmation the Japanese is good.

I also had someone check over the Russian. It is good with just the one punctuation change. I also got an alternative translation of that paragraph:

```
Несмотря на то, что значительная часть Sage использует Python, для чтения
этого пособия знание Python не требуется. Вам стоит изучить Python в будущем
(очень интересный язык!), и для этого существует немало отличных ресурсов:
многие из них перечислены в Python Beginner's Guide [PyB]_. Если вы хотите
попробовать Sage быстро, вам стоит начать с этого пособия. Итак:
```

in case someone thinks this might be a better translation.

If you are happy with everything (I think we got all of the other languages), then we can set a positive review.
