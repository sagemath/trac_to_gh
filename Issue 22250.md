I never had problems compiling `gdb` before. But if you say that this works for you, I'm happy to accept that.

One detail though: please document in the `spkg-install` file why you are adding `-ltinfo`, with a link to this ticket.

Unfortunately, it does not (but the patch still works with ncurses 6.0).
