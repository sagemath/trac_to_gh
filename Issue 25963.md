I don't understand the need for the following imports in `src/sage/graphs/all.py`

```
import sage.graphs.weakly_chordal
import sage.graphs.lovasz_theta
import sage.graphs.partial_cube
```

I let them here for now.

Deprecation is better than brutal removal and consistent with #26196.

For the other imports you asked about above; it seems they were all added when those modules were written, without any particular comment.

- `weakly_chordal`: ticket:13073#comment:4 [patch](https://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/13073/trac_13073_weaklychordal-module.patch)
- `lovasz_theta`: #18830, [commit](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=77257e3360188aabce671754ae270ec96355225c)
- `partial_cube`: ticket:19985#comment:33 [commit](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=cb7b99afc1ff709d5c50996182886fe7d72c4eb9)

Was there some convention back then to add new modules to the global namespace?
