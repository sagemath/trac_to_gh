If you run `sage new.sage` on a script `new.sage`, it creates a preparsed file `new.py`.  Then when a file in the twisted package tries to import the `new` Python module, it ends up importing this preparsed file instead, which leads to problems which can be hard to track down.

I can think of several solutions:

1. hope that users will know not to use names like `new.sage`.  This is the current state of affairs, and it seems overly optimistic to me.
2. give a warning, or fail outright with an error, if the name of the file is the same as that of a Python module.
3. name the preparsed file something which is less likely to cause a clash, for example, turn `file.sage` into `file.sage.py`.
4. don't save the preparsed file at all: use a pipe to transfer the preparsed file to Python (see #11821).

The goal of this ticket is to implement 3.
