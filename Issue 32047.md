so that it can find the fields starting with

```
(Python 3.8+)
```

and other similar stuff in the oeis.

by the way, oeis fails to use vector as input

```
sage: oeis(vector([1,1,2,5,14]))                                                
sage: oeis(list(vector([1,1,2,5,14])))                                          
0: A000108: Catalan numbers: C(n) = binomial(2n,n)/(n+1) = (2n)!/(n!(n+1)!).
1: A022562: Number of connected claw-free unlabeled graphs on n nodes.
2: A124302: Number of set partitions with at most 3 blocks; number of Dyck paths of height at most 4; dimension of space of symmetric polynomials in 3 noncommuting variables
```

LGTM.

I think the fact it doesn't handle a vector, or anything else more generally list-list, is okay as we would want the user to know it must be a list for the input. However, this isn't a strong opinion.
