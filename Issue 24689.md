# Issue 24689: add names to some strongly regular graphs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24926

Original creation time: 2018-03-08 08:27:26

some strongly regular graphs should not have their names empty, e.g. SRG_276_140_58_84 should get `Haemers-Tonchev`

it also needs a bit of work on py3 side - I notice that there is no
`from __future__ import division` in the file I hack on, and adding it breaks some stuff.

OK, done. I wonder how much code in Sage still needs to be dealt in regard of py3 division. We certainly seldom want automatic conversion into floats...

ok, thanks.

Concerning division, this file was maybe one of the largest can of issues remaining.
