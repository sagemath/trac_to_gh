# Issue 33891: Documentation String for /sage/symbolic/operators.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34128

So it appears that the .parameter_set() function for symbolic expressions has no documentation string. Here is an example to see this:

```
sage: y=function('y')(x)
sage: expr3=diff(y,x)
sage: expr3.operator().parameter_set?
```


The regulations for documentation strings can be found here:
