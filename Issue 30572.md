After using `enter`, `LPDictionary` tries to use `\color`, which leads to raw latex code to show up in the notebook.


```
sage.numerical.interactive_simplex_method.style("Vanderbei")
K.<x1,x2,x3,x4,x5>=QQ[]
D = LPDictionary(objective_value=5,
                 objective_name="zeta",
                 c=[1, -1],
                 nonbasic_variables=(x3, x1),
                 b=[5, 
                    7, 
                    0],
                 basic_variables=(x2, x4, x5),
                 A=matrix(QQ, [[-2, 3], 
                    [0, 4], 
                    [0, -1]]), 
                  ); D
# typesets OK
D.enter(x3); D
# prints latex code
```

The problem is that MathJaX confuses `\color` with `\textcolor`. We fix it by adding an additional set of braces.

Sure, I'll try on the console with latex. With the change, I'm still generating valid LaTeX code.

`view(D)` on the console works fine with this change.

But I seem to have forgotten what to do with an `HTMLFragment` (such as the result of `run_simplex_method`) on the Sage console. If I run `view` on the result of that I just get a PDF viewer that prints out LaTeX code instead of typesetting it...

Would you mind adding how to "use typeset mode to see details" somewhere in the docstring? The following two ways work for me, but I can hardly remember them when I need to see the LP.
- `view(P)` in the console or in the Jupyter notebook generates a pdf file of the LP `P`;
- `%display typeset` followed by `P` in the Jupyter notebook shows the LP.

The fix looks good to me. 
- all tests passed in `interactive_simplex_method.py`
- I can see `view(D)` or `%display typeset`+`run_simplex_method` with colors in Jupyter notebook as claimed.
- `view(D)` also works on the console. `run_simplex_method()` outputs valid latex code.
- It's a pity that `view`/`show` of `run_simplex_method()` does not generate a pdf of the typeset (but only showing the latex code). However, it is beyond this ticket.
