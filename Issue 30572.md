# Issue 30572: interactive_simplex_method: Use of \color breaks typesetting of dictionaries in the Jupyter notebook

After using `enter`, `LPDictionary` tries to use `\color`, which leads to raw latex code to show up in the notebook.


```
sage.numerical.interactive_simplex_method.style("Vanderbei")
K.<x1,x2,x3,x4,x5>=QQ[]
D = LPDictionary(objective_value=5,
                 objective_name="zeta",
                 c=[1, -1],
                 nonbasic_variables=(x3, x1),
                 b=[5, 
                    7, 
                    0],
                 basic_variables=(x2, x4, x5),
                 A=matrix(QQ, [[-2, 3], 
                    [0, 4], 
                    [0, -1]]), 
                  ); D
# typesets OK
D.enter(x3); D
# prints latex code
```

The problem is that MathJaX confuses `\color` with `\textcolor`. We fix it by adding an additional set of braces.

The highlighting code should probably be rewritten in a cleaner way. This is just a minimal fix that could hopefully still be merged in Sage 9.2.

Can you please check also that the resulting code looks good with regular LaTeX/SageTeX? It was quite a struggle to make it work for all cases back in the days.

Sure, I'll try on the console with latex. With the change, I'm still generating valid LaTeX code.

`view(D)` on the console works fine with this change.

But I seem to have forgotten what to do with an `HTMLFragment` (such as the result of `run_simplex_method`) on the Sage console. If I run `view` on the result of that I just get a PDF viewer that prints out LaTeX code instead of typesetting it...


---

I actually don't recall what exactly `view` is supposed to do, but there is also `show` that should work for `HTMLFragment`...

`show` just prints out the latex code on the console.

Anyway, that's for another ticket.

Would you mind adding how to "use typeset mode to see details" somewhere in the docstring? The following two ways work for me, but I can hardly remember them when I need to see the LP.
- `view(P)` in the console or in the Jupyter notebook generates a pdf file of the LP `P`;
- `%display typeset` followed by `P` in the Jupyter notebook shows the LP.

Good idea (although it does not strictly belong on this ticket).

The fix looks good to me. 
- all tests passed in `interactive_simplex_method.py`
- I can see `view(D)` or `%display typeset`+`run_simplex_method` with colors in Jupyter notebook as claimed.
- `view(D)` also works on the console. `run_simplex_method()` outputs valid latex code.
- It's a pity that `view`/`show` of `run_simplex_method()` does not generate a pdf of the typeset (but only showing the latex code). However, it is beyond this ticket.
