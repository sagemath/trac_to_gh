Right. Thanks.

That's a typical example in which the memory allocator of `sage.ext.memory_allocator.pxd` could ease our life. See examples in `src/sage/graphs/mcqd.pyx` and `src/sage/graphs/distances_all_pairs.pyx` and  `src/sage/graphs/centrality.pyx` and `src/sage/graphs/base/static_sparse_graph.pyx`. But your fix is OK.
