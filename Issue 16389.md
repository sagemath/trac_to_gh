The dumb question which needs to be asked is whether there is any mechanism here for making sure it doesn't come back.  At a minimum, is this in the developer guide?  Otherwise there will be more tickets 'fixing' this.

On a different note, what was `# doctest: +ELLIPSIS` for?  Some truly ancient way to mark that the ellipsis should behave as it does now?

I'll add a check to the doctest framework.

In plain python you need to turn on ellipsis per doctest, but we made it default.

Done, will now raise an error similar to how tabs raise an error.

Should get an opinion from someone who understands the doctest framework better, but this answers all my questions and then some.

Looks okay to me (I ignored all MIP stuff when reading)

Volker, could you say what happens with `mip.pyx` here - it's quite a patch...

AFAIK it's in there because o the dependency: #16504
