The dumb question which needs to be asked is whether there is any mechanism here for making sure it doesn't come back.  At a minimum, is this in the developer guide?  Otherwise there will be more tickets 'fixing' this.

On a different note, what was `# doctest: +ELLIPSIS` for?  Some truly ancient way to mark that the ellipsis should behave as it does now?
