# Issue 34244: BooleanPolynomialRing badly handles missing names parameter

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34481

Keywords: BooleanPolynomialRing

The constructor for `BooleanPolynomialRing()` does not properly handle a missing `name` parameter. The `None` type is simply converted to a string and you get some pretty weird output:


```
sage: BooleanPolynomialRing(1)
Boolean PolynomialRing in None
sage: BooleanPolynomialRing(2)
Boolean PolynomialRing in None0, None1
sage: BooleanPolynomialRing(4)
Boolean PolynomialRing in N, o, n, e
sage: BooleanPolynomialRing(5)
Boolean PolynomialRing in None0, None1, None2, None3, None4
```


The bug comes from `sage.structure.category_object import normalize_names`, which simply calls `str(names)`, without checking if names is `None`.

Note that this doesnt happen with `PolynomialRing`, we instead get a `TypeError`


```
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, 3)
# SNIP
TypeError: you must specify the names of the variables
```


Lastly, there seems to be a second function from `from sage.schemes.toric.variety.normalize_names` which does the same thing, but sets `names = []` when it detects then names is `None`.
