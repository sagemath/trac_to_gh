As a followup to #21232 these automatic simplifications should be added:

```
sage: frac(frac(x))
frac(x)
sage: frac(floor(x))  # ceil
0
sage: assume(x, 'integer')
sage: frac(x)
0
sage: assume(x > 0)
sage: frac(tanh(x))
tanh(x)
```

This all seems to work, but it's handling very specific cases and it would be much nicer if the system knew this:

```
sage: floor(x).is_integer()
True     # wishful

Actually the mechanics for this exists (eg https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/78) but `floor`, as it is not a `GinacFunction`, needs a different approach in Pynac than the ones implemented in that issue. Best I think is to first review #12121 and then after merge make `floor` a `GinacFunction`.

Why is this part of the function `frac`? The function should not care about simplifying the result in any way. If you want a custom `frac` you would better consider having a `frac` method to symbolic expression (and having the function `frac` calling it).

Very interesting. I completely forgot about these. First, if you look at `functions/*` you'll note a lot of expression arguments handled by custom code in `eval()` member functions, so called special values. We should write a `Expression` member function for all these functions? That would be an even larger class than it is now.

Replying to [comment:9 vdelecroix]:
> ... You really want to minimize type checking in the function to minimize the overhead (see e.g. the kind of discussions we had in #11332).

More and more I agree with this, see #24178. Still, I really don't want the symbolic version as `Expression` member but as standalone symbolic function, i.e., in `sage/functions`.
