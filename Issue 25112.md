So the only change I am not sure about is this one:

```diff
-        zero = self._parent.base_ring().zero()
-        l = self.list()
-        return [i for i in range(len(l)) if l[i] != zero]
+        return [i for i, c in enumerate(self) if c]
```

since `self.list()` returns a list, which we can `cdef list l` and then `cdef int i` to get C-level list lookups instead of going through a Python iterator. Also, we can pass the `copy=False` option. I know there are polynomial implementations where calling `list` always makes a (Sage version) copy of the data. Probably the way to choose for this is look at timings and the generated C code.

You are right, the following variant leads to nicer C code:

```
        cdef size_t i
        return [i for i, c in enumerate(self.list(copy=False)) if c]
```



```
  __pyx_t_3 = ((struct __pyx_vtabstruct_4sage_5rings_10polynomial_18polynomial_element_Polynomial *)__pyx_v_self->__pyx_base.__pyx_base.__pyx_base.__pyx_base.__pyx_base.__pyx_vtab)->list(__pyx_v_self, 0, &__pyx_t_4); if (unlikely(!__pyx_t_3)) __PYX_ERR(0, 5554, __pyx_L1_error)
  __Pyx_GOTREF(__pyx_t_3);
  __pyx_t_5 = __pyx_t_3; __Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_5); __pyx_t_6 = 0;

I think it is better to use `Py_ssize_t` instead of `size_t` (at least, this is what is used throughout Sage's cython codebase). Once changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

At least before we were calling `list`, so it will be no worse than before. Plus those implementations that do return a copy even for `self.list(copy=False)` probably should have their own custom version of `exponents` anyways.

You are right, of course. Thanks!
