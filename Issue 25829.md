Currently, this fails:

```
sage: from mclf import *
sage: R. = QQ[]
sage: v_2 = QQ.valuation(2)
sage: v = GaussValuation(R, v_2).augmentation(x+1, 1/2)
sage: f = x^4 - 30*x^2 - 75
sage: v.is_equivalence_unit(f)
False
sage: v.mac_lane_step(f)
Assertion Error
```

The changes made are all fine, and the issue is fixed. 
There seems to be a problem with the patchbot, unrelated with the ticket.
