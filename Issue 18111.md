`/graphs/centrality` should be linked with gmp, but is not. Similar to #17962.

Sorry about that.

Could you say why exactly linux is very "forgivinig" (#17962) on this respect? Can't we change one parameter somewhere so that it stops being this forgiving?

Like I said on `sage-devel`, the real solution for this would be to add the libraries to the `.pxd` file. Then all modules using that file will link against the library. I'm willing work on implementing this but only if I have some commitment in advance that this work will be reviewed (I have too many ignored needs-review tickets on Trac right now).

Hmmmmm.. Well, I was more thinking of a way to make the build system scream if we fail to be explicit about it. About your ticket: I'm sorry, I don't feel sufficiently knowledgeable about such things to swear that I can review a ticket like that `:-/`

I can't swear I will be able to review it fully, but I can swear I will try, since I think it would be very useful!

I'll be very happy to review such a ticket.
I don't have much time for Sage these days, but can still review a ticket once in a while.
