# Issue 17622: Wrong coercion between QQ and finite rings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17859

There is no coercion between QQ and finite rings

```
sage: cm = get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.get_action(Zmod(2), QQ, operator.mul) is None
True
```

This is right.

But we do have an action of matrices on vectors

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(Zmod(2),2)
sage: V = VectorSpace(QQ,2)
sage: cm.get_action(M,V,operator.mul)
Left action by
  Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Ring of integers modulo 2 on
  Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field
```

or

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(QQ,2)
sage: V = VectorSpace(Zmod(2),2)
sage: cm.get_action(M,V,operator.mul)
Left action by
  Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field on
  Vector space of dimension 2 over Ring of integers modulo 2
```

And this is wrong!

LGTM, but could you add a linebreak to the doctest you added? Thanks.
