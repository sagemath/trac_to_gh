In #18470, `InfinityPathModel` is introduced.  However, this name may be confused with the Kyoto path model realization of `B(oo)` which is defined in a different manner.  The crystal introduced in #18470 should be something like `PolyhedralRealizationOfInfinityCrystal` (or something involving *polyhedral realization*).

Travis,

Should we also change the `e` and `f` operators to match the data of `[NZ97]`, or do you think the way it is implemented now will do the trick?  ...Also, how do we delete the file `infinity_path_crystal.py` from the crystals directory?
