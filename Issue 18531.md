# Issue 18531: Change name of InfinityPathModel

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: bsalisbury1

Original creation time: 2015-06-22 22:07:32

CC:  tscrim

Keywords: crystal, polyhedral realization

In #18470, `InfinityPathModel` is introduced.  However, this name may be confused with the Kyoto path model realization of `B(oo)` which is defined in a different manner.  The crystal introduced in #18470 should be something like `PolyhedralRealizationOfInfinityCrystal` (or something involving _polyhedral realization_).

Travis,

Should we also change the `e` and `f` operators to match the data of `[NZ97]`, or do you think the way it is implemented now will do the trick?  ...Also, how do we delete the file `infinity_path_crystal.py` from the crystals directory?

I think the current implementation will work for now. If we get this ticket into Sage before the next beta, we won't have to do any deprecations (although it is on my todo list to implement a crystal consolidating the list of indices). You've already deleted the file it looks like. So I'm essentially ready to set this to positive review as is.

Thanks Ben (and sorry if I had said I would do this ticket and forgot about it).

No worries!  I was secretly hoping I would get to do it myself :P

Thanks, Travis, for the positive review!
