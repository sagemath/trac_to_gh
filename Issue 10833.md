```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()

```


And for larger values ...


```
sage: g = graphs.Grid2dGraph(30,30)
sage: %time d=g.shortest_path_all_pairs(algorithm = "BFS")
CPU times: user 2.75 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 2.76 s
Wall time: 2.76 s
sage: %time d=g.shortest_path_all_pairs(algorithm = "Floyd-Warshall-Cython")
CPU times: user 34.71 s, sys: 0.08 s, total: 34.80 s
Wall time: 34.87 s
```


Method ``distance_all_pairs``


```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit g.distance_all_pairs(algorithm="BFS")
625 loops, best of 3: 319 µs per loop
sage: %timeit g.distance_all_pairs(algorithm="Floyd-Warshall")
625 loops, best of 3: 222 µs per loop
sage: g = graphs.Grid2dGraph(20,20)
sage: %timeit g.distance_all_pairs(algorithm="BFS")
5 loops, best of 3: 536 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g.distance_all_pairs(algorithm="Floyd-Warshall")
5 loops, best of 3: 2.76 s per loop
```


Even improved, it still does not beat Floyd Warshall for small graphs... So for the moment, I made the ``distance_all_pairs`` method use BFS for graphs on more than 20 vertices and Floyd Warshall otherwise. Tell me if you think it sound.


```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: %timeit g.distance_all_pairs()
625 loops, best of 3: 222 µs per loop
sage: g = graphs.Grid2dGraph(20,20)
sage: %timeit g.distance_all_pairs()
5 loops, best of 3: 530 ms per loop
```


Perhaps the reason is that this new method still computes both paths and distances while it is not required for distance_all_pairs...

Now that I stopped playing making it faster some remarks for the review:
* doctest the ValueError (and correct the small bug I guess)
* same remark as #10855 concerning method vs function (might be irrelevant)
* in generic_graph.py, lines 11088-11089: typo one Cython should be Python
* doctest this ValueError too
* doctest the by_weight stuff

otherwise sounds good
