Should be easy to implement the first option. Let's make that to correct the bug, and later think about second option as an optimization.

I've posted an issue on our version of upstream: https://github.com/mkoeppe/bliss/issues/2. So a good followup would be to actually do the fix directly in our fork of bliss.

Thanks for the patch. By the way, after closer inspection, it seems that bliss does not support multiple edges after all, even when given in a file.

I've changed the description to match the actual status. Also, I'm setting this to `needs_work` since the `canonical_label` method also needs to be updated.

OK, done, so we're back to `needs_review`.
