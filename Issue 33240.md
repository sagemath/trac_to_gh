Keywords: multivariate Laurent polynomial conversion fraction field localization

The issue is explained by the following example:


```sage
sage: R.<u, v> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: F = FractionField(R)
sage: R(F(1/u))
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: fraction must have unit denominator
```


This has been fixed for univariate Laurent polynomial rings in #26425.

Here we will extend that fix to the multivariate case. Since in the meantime localization of integral domains is available, we will take care that it will work for localizations, as well.

I don't have a justification for this other than to treat both cases in one. Then I took it for redundant in view of the parent's check.

> This would also allow more separation with checking against a localization too.

Do you have something in mind like the following?


```python
...
        elif isinstance(x, FractionFieldElement):
            res = from_fraction_field(self, x)
            ...
        elif isinstance(x, LocalizationElement):
            res = from_localization(self, x)
...
```
