There's no need to parse the solution gotten from gambit as a string, because it returns a list of strategy profiles (which itself is kind of a list). Also, parsing the output as a string causes errors when the solver returns a Rational output.

```python
sage: import gambit
sage: from sage.game_theory.parser import Parser
sage: g = gambit.Game.new_table([2,2])
sage: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalLCPSolver()
sage: p = Parser(solver.solve(g, rational=True))
sage: s = p.format_LCP(g)
```


```
    309         nice_stuff = []
    310         for gambitstrategy in self.raw_string:
--> 311             gambitstrategy = eval(str(gambitstrategy)[str(gambitstrategy).index("["): str(gambitstrategy).index("]") + 1])
    312             profile = [tuple(gambitstrategy[:len(gambit_game.players[int(0)].strategies)])]
    313             for player in list(gambit_game.players)[1:]:

NameError: name 'Fraction' is not defined
```


Also, all output generated by the gambit python interface uses the same format, so a general name 'format_gambit' fits more than 'format_LCP'.

Tests run for me and I particularly like the modularity of:

This is a nice (and needed) fix.
