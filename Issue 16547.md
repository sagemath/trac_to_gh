CC:  @vbraun @saliola

Since Sage 5.11.rc0, hitting ctrl-c after this

```
sage: print('hello'
....: 
```

does not return to the Sage prompt, it just says

```
KeyboardInterrupt
....: 
```

Hitting ctrl-c should instead return you to the prompt, as it used to do.

My guess is that this comes from #14523.
