# Issue 16547: Allow ctrl-C to interrupt incomplete multiline Sage command

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16784

Since Sage 5.11.rc0, hitting ctrl-c after this

```
sage: print('hello'
....: 
```

does not return to the Sage prompt, it just says

```
KeyboardInterrupt
....: 
```

Hitting ctrl-c should instead return you to the prompt, as it used to do.

My guess is that this comes from #14523.

This fixes the problem for me, and it still handles modifying attached files.
