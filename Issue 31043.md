```

To make it work, I tried

```
$ ./sage --pip3 install jupyterlab_pygments
```

and got

```
Collecting jupyterlab_pygments
  Using cached jupyterlab_pygments-0.1.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl (4.6 kB)
Requirement already satisfied: pygments<3,>=2.4.1 in ./local/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from jupyterlab_pygments) (2.9.0)
Installing collected packages: jupyterlab-pygments
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
nbconvert 6.0.7 requires nbclient<0.6.0,>=0.5.0, which is not installed.
Successfully installed jupyterlab-pygments-0.1.2
```

Then I did

```
./sage --pip3 uninstall jupyterlab_pygments
./sage --pip3 install nbclient
./sage --pip3 install jupyterlab_pygments
```

and this fixed this issue.
