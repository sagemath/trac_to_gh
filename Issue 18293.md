Avoid calling networkx and then converting to sage graphs for generating very simple graphs (Bull graph, Claw Graph, etc.)

I did some of them. I don't know if we need to do all of them yet ;)

does not pass all tests :(
The order of the vertices changed in `Grid2dGraph`.

Thanks to Nathann, I have solve all the problems.

I have not changed all the methods and there is room for further cleaning, but it's a beginning.

Helloooooooooo !

I added a commit at public/18530 (since you chose to make the branch public).

Most of the changes I made are superficial:
- Reduce the number of lines whenever possible
- Add edges from an iterator instead of a dictionary. Adding edges from a dictionary calls ` add_edge` on an iterator, so it can only be slower

I also fixed a bug with ladder_graph, which was incorrect (plot it, you will see).

Most importantly, if you have never looked at paths, now is the time:


```
sage: graphs.PathGraph(3).show()
sage: graphs.PathGraph(30).show()
sage: graphs.PathGraph(100).show()
```


Run those three commands. You will be surprised `:-P`

Thanks for the corrections.

I had to update some doctests since you changed from `Path Graph` to `Path graph`. I had also to update the test on `spring_layout` in `generic_graph.py` line 15174.

And yes, the layout of the path is pretty cool ;)

Hmmmmmm `O_o` 

Actually I did not mean to make that change (I just copy/pasted the first of your two lines) but it seems that all other graphs has a 'graph' and not a 'Graph', so I guess that's fine `O_o`
