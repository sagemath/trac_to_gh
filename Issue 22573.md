Sorry, I thought I had tested the last version of the patch in #22633.  But I think I just tested it in PARI/GP, but not in Sage itself, since my Sage build was broken at the time for other reasons.

The offending line is [here](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/pari/patches/prot_none_4.patch?h=develop&id=89e6ef4aea6f5af63a9ae40a998413dfc0bb39b5#n50).  It seems that `MAP_FIXED` is not working correctly for some reason, but the resulting call to `pari_err` segfaults because the pari mainstack is left in an invalid state.

I'm not sure if this is a bug in Cygwin or what, but I'm trying to put together a simplified test case.

> It seems that `MAP_FIXED` is not working correctly for some reason

The question now becomes: why?

Does everything work fine if you remove the line `if (res != addr) pari_err(e_MEM);`

For debugging, it would be useful to print the values of `addr`, `s` and `res` after that `mmap()` call.

The problem is not so much `MAP_FIXED` itself--it works in a different context.

In this case the `mmap` in `pari_mainstack_mreset` is failing unless I call `munmap(addr, s)` first.  If I understand correctly that should be fine, because we're not using that memory anyways right now if we're setting it to `PROT_NONE`.

With multi-threading, there is a non-zero chance of things going wrong.

For the record, calling `mmap()` with `MAP_FIXED` on a already-mapped region is specified by POSIX to replace an existing mapping. So if Cygwin does not support that, I would consider that a bug.

Right, I think that would be a bug too--the thread I linked to above has some comment about that.

Honestly, I might just add a patch that reverts to the old mprotect-based approach on Cygwin.
