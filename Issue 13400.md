No, the `.DS_Store` files are upstream in `http://sympy.googlecode.com/files/sympy-0.7.1.tar.gz`

This should be either reported upstream or closed as "wontfix" (I won't do neither of these).

Thanks, Jeroen - I used the wrong command before.  In Sympy 0.7.2, we have

```

$ ls -aR . | grep -C 4 DS_Store

./data:
.
..
.DS_Store
IPython
Macports
TeXmacs

--

./doc:
.
..
.DS_Store
Makefile
README.rst
api
apidoc.conf
--

./doc/src:
.
..
.DS_Store
_static
aboutus.rst
conf.py
figures
```

so different garbage, but still there.  

Reported upstream at [Sympy issue 3787](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=3787).

I now agree that we either need a script in spkg-install to avoid this or to wait on upstream.  Is there any problem if we also upgrade at this ticket, should that work?
