It is possible that the field defined by the coefficients is strictly contained in base field of the morphism. This can be happen in a number of situations, especially from conjugations or computing normal forms. There should be a general function to reduce to the field of definition of the coefficients.

Here is an initial implementation that could use some more testing.

This just implements the function and does not have any of the 'client' functions utilize this; like conjugate or normal form. I'm not sure those additional modifications should be part of this ticket.

On line 1684 of src/sage/schemes/projective/projective_morphism.py, the method finds the max of the the degrees of the coefficients. This should find the LCM rather than the max. For instance, the following code currently gives the minimal field as GF(5 to 3), when it should give GF(5 to 6), as below:

```
sage: K.<t>=GF(5^6)
sage: A.<x>=AffineSpace(K,1)
sage: H=End(A)
sage: f=H([x^2+x*(t^3 + 2*t^2 + 4*t)+(t^5 + 3*t^4 + t^2 + 4*t)])
sage: f.reduce_base_field()
Scheme endomorphism of Affine Space of dimension 1 over Finite Field in t of size 5^6
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x) to
        (x^2 + (t^3 + 2*t^2 - t)*x + (t^5 - 2*t^4 + t^2 - t))
```
