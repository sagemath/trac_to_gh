# Issue 20197: LatticePoset() arguments not forwarded to Poset()

Docstring of `LatticePoset()` says that `**options` if forwarded to `Poset()`. It is not:


```
sage: P = Poset( ([0, 1,3,2, 10], [[0,1],[0,3],[0,2], [1,10],[3,10],[2,10]]), linear_extension=True)
sage: L = LatticePoset( ([0, 1,3,2, 10], [[0,1],[0,3],[0,2], [1,10],[3,10],[2,10]]), linear_extension=True)
sage: P.list()
[0, 1, 3, 2, 10]
sage: L.list()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 10]
```

This can be seen also with plain posets:


```
P1 = Poset({1:[2]}, linear_extension=False, facade=False)
P2 = Poset(P1)
Q1 = Poset({1:[2]}, linear_extension=True, facade=True)
Q2 = Poset(Q1)
print P1._with_linear_extension, P1._is_facade, "-->", P2._with_linear_extension, P2._is_facade
print Q1._with_linear_extension, Q1._is_facade, "-->", Q2._with_linear_extension, Q2._is_facade
```


outputs


```
False False --> False False
True True --> False True
```


i.e. `linear_extension=True` is not copied along the data and `facade` argument.

I suppose that this relates to #18776.

Kevin, want to look at this?

As of my previous comment: Travis noticed at sage-devel that `linear_extension=False` is the default, whereas default for `facade` is `None`.

#21666 will conflict, added as dependency.

Duh. I did something really wrong with git and trac.

Waiting for 7.5 beta.

Changing keywords from "" to "poset".

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
