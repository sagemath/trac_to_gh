Implemented a method checking whether a Finite State Machine is complete.

A finite state machine is said to be complete if for each state q and each
letter a of the input alphabet, there is exactly one transition leaving q with
input label a.

I've reviewed it (and made some minor changes). Doctests pass, documentation looks ok. For me this is a positive review, after someone checked the minor changes I've made.

Three of the minor changes in commit
0913692f72cbd29c8ad13dedb761a6f547f70e08
concerned code copied from is_deterministic to is_complete.
    
Thus, backported those minor changes to is_deterministic

Pushed one further commit changing one instance of `raise E, V` to `raise E(V)`, cf. #15990
