Consider the following code:

```
# tries to find x^2+(y/2^delta)^2 + small = (2z+1)^2
# (2^delta*x)^2 + y^2 + err = (2^delta*(2z+1))^2
def table1_mod2(p,delta,err):
   l = [[0,0]]
   P = 1 # values in l are mod P
   q = 1
   twop = 2^p
   twodelta = 2^delta
   while P<twop:
      q = next_prime(q)
      R = IntegerModRing(P*q)
      newl = []
      for t in l:
         for hx in range(q):
            x = t[0]+hx*P
            if x>=twop:
               break
            u = R((twodelta*x)^2+err)
            for hz in range(q):
               z = t[1]+hz*P
               if z>=twop:
                  break
               y2 = R((twodelta*(2*z+1))^2)-u
               if y2.is_square():
                  newl.append([x,z])
      l = newl
      P = P * q
   return l, P
```

With Sage 4.7 I get:

```
sage: time l=table1_mod2(10,0,1)
Time: CPU 2.61 s, Wall: 2.63 s
sage: len(l[0])
76940
```

If I change `R = IntegerModRing(P*q)` by `R=GF(q)`, which
does not change the algorithm (we are lifting modulo 2*3*5*...),
then strangely the program is slower:

```
sage: time l=table1_mod2(10,0,1)
Time: CPU 19.28 s, Wall: 19.33 s
sage: len(l[0])
76940
```

Is that normal?

still true with Sage 5.5: got CPU 2.16s with `R = IntegerModRing(P*q)`, CPU 12.52s with `R=GF(q)`.

It still happens in 5.12.beta2, with a similar factor.  The difference seems to be in `is_square()`:

```
sage: F=GF(1031)
sage: R=IntegerModRing(1031)
sage: a=F(27); b=R(27)
sage: a.is_square()
True
sage: b.is_square()
True
sage: %timeit a.is_square()
10000 loops, best of 3: 79 us per loop
sage: %timeit b.is_square()
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.25 us per loop
```

This is surprising since *a* and *b* are of the same type (`IntegerMod_int`) and have the same value; only their parents differ.  Now `is_square()` calls the method `factored_order()` of the parent; this is cached in `IntegerModRing` but not in `FiniteField_base`.

Indeed, the slowness of `a.is_square()` is essentially explained by the slowness of constructing a `Factorization` object:

```
sage: %timeit Factorization([(1031,1)])
10000 loops, best of 3: 72.2 us per loop
```

I guess the solution is either to speed up construction of a `Factorization`, or to use caching in `FiniteField_base.factored_order()`.

Attachment [11628-FiniteField_base-cache-factored_order.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket11628/11628-FiniteField_base-cache-factored_order.patch) by pbruin created at 2013-11-22 12:54:40

With the patch, the `GF(q)` version is now slightly faster on my system.

The line that this patch removes in `finite_field_prime_modn.py` was redundant because `FiniteField_prime_modn` inherits `factored_order()` from `FiniteField_base`, not from `IntegerModRing`.
