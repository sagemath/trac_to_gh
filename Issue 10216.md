# Issue 10216: bug in rings/fast_arith.pyx

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This chunk of code in fast_arith.pyx:

```

    cdef public long long c_inverse_mod_longlong(self, long long a, long long m) except -1:
        cdef long long g, s, t
        g = self.c_xgcd_longlong(a,m, &s, &t)
        s = s % m
        if s < 0:
            s = s + m
        return s
```

should raise an exception if g != 1, so should be

```

    cdef public long long c_inverse_mod_longlong(self, long long a, long long m) except -1:
        cdef long long g, s, t
        g = self.c_xgcd_longlong(a,m, &s, &t)
        if g != 1: raise ZeroDivisionError
        s = s % m
        if s < 0:
            s = s + m
        return s
```

If `g!=1` then Arithmetic Error is raised like in `c_inverse_mod_int`

I started to look at this. 
I had difficulties trying to find a test that could hit the case `g != 1`.
I found the following:

```
from sage.ext.multi_modular import MultiModularBasis_base
mm = MultiModularBasis_base([6, 10])
```

which raises another problem, since the new exception is not trapped:

```
sage: mm.crt([1,2])
13
```

This is wrong since 13 is not equal to 2 mod 10...

MultiModularBasis_base requires that it's inputs actually be prime so `mm = MultiModularBasis_base([6, 10])` shouldn't produce a valid object.

I've added some code which adds a doctest for this functionality.

I've replaced the deprecated `raise` syntax by a Python 3 compatible one.

Looks good to me.  If you're okay with my changes, could you mark it as positive review?

Apply only  trac_10217_merged.patch

This should be rebased to sage-5.0.beta12:

```
applying trac_10217_merged.patch
patching file sage/ext/multi_modular.pyx
Hunk #1 FAILED at 156
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/ext/multi_modular.pyx.rej
patch failed, unable to continue (try -v)
patch failed, rejects left in working dir
errors during apply, please fix and refresh trac_10217_merged.patch
```


Also the Reviewer field needs to be filled in.
