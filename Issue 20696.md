#20837 tried to bring all spkgs into a uniform format for patches to the upstream sources.  In particular it ensures that all patches are applied from within the root of the upstream sources.

In the process I missed MathJax which was slightly different from other packages.  Fixing this is needed for #20692 to be completed.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20933

The four packages which just have their directories changed are fine.

With tachyon and jmol, the installed version with this branch is the same before this branch (as far as I can tell). So this is fine too.

Rubiks on the other hand has substantial changes, probably because of a different `Makefile`. I cannot immediately tell whether they are fine.
