# Issue 11097: Correct docstring formatting of dir_with_other_class

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: SimonKing

Original creation time: 2011-04-28 12:27:37

Assignee: mvngu

The docstring of dir_with_other_class lacks a double colon, and it contains backslashes, so that it ought to be a raw string.

The trivial patch takes care of it.
