Thanks for looking at this Nathann!
The phrasing "an LP variable" is indeed correct. It's a bit peculiar in English, but when writing an acronym such as 'LP' we use 'an' or 'a' depending on how the acronym is pronounced when spoken rather than how it's spelled.
Since 'LP' is spoken as "ell pee", we write "an LP" since the pronunciation begins with a vowel sound.
There's a few more examples of how this works at http://www.dailywritingtips.com/indefinite-article-with-initialisms/

Hope this clears things up!

I think you may have accidentally read the diff incorrectly... 
"a usual dictionary" is correct and it used to be "an usual dictionary".

Also, the choice of 'a/an' will always be based on the word immediately after it, so it'd be incorrect to base it off 'dictionary' here. In our case, "an usual dictionary" is wrong since the word after 'an' ('usual') starts with a consonant sound when spoken.

Hellooooooo,

> Also, the choice of 'a/an' will always be based on the word immediately after it,

Always with the word immediately after it. Makes sense, I'll remember it.

> so it'd be incorrect to base it off 'dictionary' here. In our case, "an usual dictionary" is wrong since the word after 'an' ('usual') starts with a consonant sound when spoken.

Whaaaaaaaaaaat? `O_o`

This I do not get: why do you say that "usual" starts with a consonant? For me it starts with the vowel 'u', and to me 'an usual' flows better than 'a usual'? Actually, I pronounce "an usual" exctly as I would pronounce "unusual". Perhaps that's what is meant to be avoided? `;-)`

P.S.: Thanks for your help with that. It is a bit "all I want to know about english but were too afraid to ask" `:-D`

Happy to be of help Nathann!

To quickly add to that rule, the use of 'a/an' in English is typically to keep the spoken language alternating between consonant and vowel sounds. If the word immediately after 'a/an' starts with a consonant sound, we use 'a' since it ends in a vowel sound, and vice versa. This is why 'a/an' depends on the word immediately after it.

Now, if you pronounce 'usual' by starting with a 'oo' sound (correct me if I'm wrong in assuming you pronounce it like that!) saying "an usual" would technically be correct if we follow this rule (although like you said, it might be misheard as 'unusual').
However, the most common pronunciation of 'usual' starts with the sound 'you', which is why I said that it started with a consonant sound. Accordingly, it's more widely accepted to be written and spoken as "a usual". That's all.
