when using latex command in the doc, you need to start with `r"""` instead of `"""`

For example, when using ``\infty``

Thank you for the hint, I tend to overlook this :-9

Warning: this ticket is currently not updated, the newest version is in #32324 and #32345, because it turned out to be important to get a broader view on the lazy framework.  Once this framework is stable (very likely soon after #31897 is in), I will probably backport, if that makes review easier.

Thank you Travis!

I think it would be good to split `LazyLaurentSeries.__call__` into subroutines, 110 lines of code don't fit on a screen and I find it hard to see the execution path.

line 1993:

```
            if (not isinstance(g, LazyDirichletSeries)
                and isinstance(g._coeff_stream, Stream_exact)
                and not g._coeff_stream._constant):
```

I think it might be better to say

```
            if (isinstance(g, LazyCauchyProductSeries)
                and isinstance(g._coeff_stream, Stream_exact)
                and not g._coeff_stream._constant):
```


line 2054:

```
        # Perhaps we just don't yet know if the valuation is positive
        if g._coeff_stream._approximate_order <= 0:
            if any(g._coeff_stream[i] for i in range(g._coeff_stream._approximate_order, 1)):
                raise ValueError("can only compose with a positive valuation series")
            g._coeff_stream._approximate_order = 1
```

looks suspicious for lazy Dirichlet series, because if the approximate order is 1 then we do not have positive valuation.

I think, the following should work:

```
sage: D = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(QQ, "s")
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: e = L(lambda n: 1/factorial(n), 0)
sage: g = D(None, valuation=2)
sage: o = D(constant=1, valuation=2)
sage: g.define(e(g)*o)
AssertionError: Dirichlet convolution is only defined for coefficient streams with minimal index of nonzero coefficient at least 1
```

After fixing the bug in â€‹https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32309?replyto=21#comment:22, the following actually works:

```
sage: g.define(o*e(g)); g
1/(2^s) + 1/(3^s) + 2/4^s + 1/(5^s) + 3/6^s + 1/(7^s) + 9/2/8^s + O(1/(9^s))
```

(but not `g.define(e(g)*o)`)

I remember us coming across this problem with Cauchy multiplication as we don't actually need a coefficient because the other side is 0. Here, we can at least get it to the same level, where we add an extra check against the valuation. I will push a fix for this in a second.

In more detail, for this computation, it is computing the pairs of coefficients (2,1) and (1,2). However, we only test one side (the left) is nonzero before computing the right, which is why we have this broken symmetry.

With the major points/cases commented, I think it is fine (you can just have your editor fold the different cases to see the larger structure). However, if you want to split it and handle all of the documentation stuff, then go ahead an do it.

> line 1993:

Yea, you're right. This should only happen if a series implements the Cauchy product. Changed.

That is the generic code, it then falls into the next if statement, which is the Dirichlet specialized code, to check explicitly the `approximate order == 1` case. I tweaked the code so that it does update `g._coeff_stream._approximate_order = 2` since it knows that at that point.

Comment by tscrim created at 2021-08-27 01:03:31

Question: Do we want all of the lazy series to have the same global options for printing? There is a way to link the two together by

```
options = LazyLaurentSeriesRing.options
```

in `LazyDirichletSeriesRing` (see `SkewTableaux` for an example`).


---

Comment by mantepse created at 2021-08-27 06:01:50

Great! making options more global is not important to me.

I do think it would be good to have some tests for lazy series having lazy series as coefficients. Most interesting would be the case where an initial coefficients vanishes mysteriously.

I am without computer until noon.

Indeed:

I have fixed all of these, however, most of the fixes belong into #31897.

Comment by tscrim created at 2021-08-27 12:25:00

It would be better to not do it on #31897 as that has been positively reviewed for a bit. If Volker has already merged it into his upcoming beta branch, then the new commits might be lost. It really should be on a followup ticket.

We also should not be making any promises on doing things over lazy series because we are being very cautious about equality checking and raising errors (in places that are almost never supposed to raise them).

That being said, the last one is really bad and some basic things like that should work.

One problem is, that `R(x)` in `_element_constructor_` succeeds:

```
        R = self._laurent_poly_ring
        BR = self.base_ring()
        try:
            # Try to build stuff using the polynomial ring constructor
            x = R(x)
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass
```

`R` is the `Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in z over Lazy Dirichlet Series Ring in s over Rational Field`, and `x` is converted into a lazy Dirichlet series, because it is callable.

Comment by mantepse created at 2021-08-27 14:49:52

I guess the correct solution is to make the arguments given to the `element_constructor` more explicit: we could, for example, have an optional argument `coefficients`, and do something like

```
if coefficients is None:
    proceed as we currently do
else:
   assert x == 0
   ...
```

Comment by tscrim created at 2021-09-01 12:42:54

Ah, right, the coercion system defaults to sending `0` as an input.

I also wanted to avoid having that massive `coefficients is None` block, but perhaps there is no way around that. We need to also change the `.. NOTE::` and make the corresponding change for the lazy Dirichlet series element constructor as that will run into the same problem.

I don't think we should cache `monomial` as that is a good way to each up memory with a lot of transient objects.

We should keep using `_polynomial_part` in `_div_` and `__pow__` (preferred) or we should implement a faster version for the lazy Laurent series. I know you are thinking a bit about the Taylor series (which should be handled on that ticket since we can test it there), but I think we can simply extend the `_polynomial_part` to have a `multivariate` option since at some point somewhere, that has to be handled slightly differently.

Unfortunately, allowing exotic base rings for `LazyDirichletSeriesRing` involves some work, because its 'truncated ring'  is currently simply the symbolic ring.

Here is, what might become a doctest:

```
        In the next example the argument is interpreted as a constant
        polynomial, which happens to be a Dirichlet series::

            sage: D = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(QQ, "s")
            sage: E = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(D, "t")
            sage: E(lambda n: 1/factorial(n))

        We can also specify that the given function should be
        interpreted as the coefficients of the Laurent series::

            sage: E(coefficients=lambda n: 1/factorial(n))[:10]
```


I completely forgot about `finite_part`, etc.  I guess we will have to resolve this in this ticket, or should we postpone it further?

Let me try to summarise my view on the situation concerning `finite_part`:

* the idea of `finite_part` is to return the truncation of `self` as an element of the appropriate truncation ring `self.parent()._laurent_poly_ring`.  A slow generic version is possible (using `self.parent().monomial()`), a fast version could be provided by the individual classes.  In fact, I'd expect that any sensible `self.parent()._laurent_poly_ring` would support construction from a list, which would then be fast.  This should not be significantly slower than calling `Stream_exact._polynomial_part()`, there would be one additional `isinstance` check, but more useful, because it could include the case of non-exact series.  I think it should also render the `LazyLaurentSeries.polynomial` method obsolete.

* Is it possible to make `L._element_constructor(x)` fast when `x` is an element of `L._laurent_poly_ring`?  If not, it may make sense to have a specialised method in `L` that does this.  This would also help making `L._element_constructor` easier to read.

* The code in `LazyCauchyProductSeries._div_` and `_pow_` is currently duplicating the corresponding bits of `L._element_constructor` does, which is not ideal because it increases the likelihood of bugs.  (in fact, it was sheer luck that I noticed a bug which occurred because of the rename from `valuation` to `order` and because the corresponding doctest missed the `sage:` prefix)

Here is code that I just wrote, but I'm not sure how helpful it is.
Right now it seems more useful to me to have a method that turns a _list_ into a series, because what I wrote below doesn't work for the Dirichlet case, unless we force the developer to write a class for Dirichlet polynomials.  (I am not against writing this class, I am against making the framework harder to extend.)

Dear Travis!

Since the lazy backend is now merged, I think it would be good to attempt progress on this one.

I am not sure how fruitful it is to think about `finite_part`, `_polynomial_part` and `polynomial` now.  Possibly it is best to remove `finite_part` from this ticket entirely, and think about it when finalizing #32324. See also comment:55.

Another, different thing to consider: I'm afraid that eventually it is necessary to have a proper `truncated ring` structure for `_laurent_poly_ring` (warning, misnomer), because eventually somebody will want to do computations over exotic coefficient rings.  See comment:53.

Finally, I noticed that exact multiplication is commented out for Dirichlet series, because it is slow.  This is true, of course.  I guess, however, what is really slow and badly done and should be improved in a separate ticket is the fallback mechanism for composition, currently only used for Dirichlet series:

```python
        if isinstance(g, LazyDirichletSeries):
            if g._coeff_stream._approximate_order == 1:
                if g._coeff_stream[1] != 0:
                    raise ValueError("can only compose with a positive valuation series")
                g._coeff_stream._approximate_order = 2
            # we assume that the valuation of self[i](g) is at least i
            def coefficient(n):
                return sum(self[i] * (g**i)[n] for i in range(n+1))
            coeff_stream = Stream_function(coefficient, P._coeff_ring, P._sparse, 1)
            return P.element_class(P, coeff_stream)
```

Note that `(g**i)[n]` will compute terms which are finally thrown away again.  I am guessing that the correct solution would be a generic composition class in `stream.py`.

To conclude: how about removing `finite_part`, and open new tickets (possibly recycling some ticket numbers) for the three points above, and be done with it for now?

Comment by tscrim created at 2021-09-16 04:30:06

Sorry for not being able to get to this sooner. I had to try a few different things, but I think I settled on something that works well and eliminates a lot of duplication.

The main thing I did was implement an `_internal_poly_ring` attribute that uses a Laurent poly ring to parse in lists and the like for Dirichlet series as a transient object for the `_element_constructor_`. I guess this could be replaced by the `_coeff_ring` in the Taylor series ticket. Now everything flows through one `_element_constructor_` with a little bit of data prep for the Dirichlet series.

I fixed up the documentation and fixed some other failures from the file renaming I didn't catch earlier (thank you patchbots). I also removed mostly duplicate `change_ring()`. I renamed `monomial` to `_monomial` and implemented a fallback option for Dirichlet series.

I removed the `finite_part()` as we can reintroduce that later when we need it.

I agree with you that the best way to implement composition would be to add another `Stream` subclass to store the intermediate powers in the generic case.

Wow, you put in a lot of work!

I don't really understand the meaning of `_internal_poly_ring` yet.

There is one issue, which is important to me (and a doctest in the Taylor ticket, which, for some reason, I overlooked while backporting).  I am against ordinary polynomials being re-interpreted as Dirichlet series.  This is going to be a source of bugs which are very hard to understand.

```
sage: D = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(ZZ, 't')
sage: m = D(moebius); m
1 - 1/(2^t) - 1/(3^t) - 1/(5^t) + 1/(6^t) - 1/(7^t) + O(1/(8^t))
sage: P.<x, y> = QQ[]
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(P)
sage: L(m)
z - z^2 - z^3 - z^5 + z^6 - z^7 + O(z^8)
```

Also, continuing with the definitions above, I think the below is at least fishy:

```
sage: R.<q> = QQ[]
sage: L(q)
z
sage: L(x)
x
sage: D(q)
1
sage: L(q^-1)
z^-1
sage: D(q^-1)
1
sage: D(x)
<repr(<sage.rings.lazy_series_ring.LazyDirichletSeriesRing_with_category.element_class at 0x7faeaca0c640>) failed: TypeError: number of arguments does not match number of variables in parent>
```


Note that the element constructor for polynomials is stricter here, and I think that this is how it should be:

```
sage: R(x)
...
TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```

It is something that we use to internally to manipulate things. Mainly it is a way around the `shift` issue (although with a bit more data preprocessing in the Dirichlet `_element_constructor_`, it might become redundant; this was the lazier approach).

When you say ordinary polynomials, do you mean Laurent/Taylor/etc. series? I think this conversion is fine; it is not a coercion. IMO, we should trust that users knows what they is doing. We should not go out of our way to tell users they are misusing something. However, if you feel strongly about it, I know a way to easily extend things to stop this conversion, but I think it is a small bit of technical debt.

I have fixed it so that `D(q^-1)` no longer thinks it is a valid series.

I am pretty sure we cannot do anything better here because we take callables as valid input and perhaps someone wants to use a polynomial (which doesn't convert into the internal poly ring) to compute coefficients. I believe your previous code would have the same behavior.

I cannot remember what the `shift` issue is, sorry.

> When you say ordinary polynomials, do you mean Laurent/Taylor/etc. series?

Both.  I think that all of the following should raise errors:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: D = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(QQ, 't')
sage: P.<q> = QQ[]
sage: D(z) # this is extremely fishy, the result is not in the correct ring
z
sage: D(q)
1
sage: D(q) == D(1)
True
sage: L(D([1,2,3]))
z + 2*z^2 + 3*z^3
```


I was actually mistaken that the polynomial ring would be much stricter, there seems to be some inconsistency:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<q> = QQ[]
sage: T.<t> = QQ[]
sage: T(q)
t
sage: T(x)
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```


> I am pretty sure we cannot do anything better here because we take callables as valid input and perhaps someone wants to use a polynomial (which doesn't convert into the internal poly ring) to compute coefficients. I believe your previous code would have the same behavior.

At least before your work, using a polynomial `p` as a callable (via the `coefficients` argument) would produce the series with coefficients `p(0), p(1), ...` in the Laurent case, which I think is fine.

What I think is not correct is that a (Laurent or ordinary) polynomial or a Laurent of Dirichlet series is interpreted as a sequence of coefficients.  This didn't happen before, at least not in the Taylor ticket code.

The first was a bug, which I fixed. Then I got rid of that because I implemented a bit of a hack to prohibit what you want (I think that is unnecessary because of the `coefficients` parameter and it is not wrong to do this) and not have lots of duplicated code.

OK.  I am still unhappy about the following:

```
sage: L.<z> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: D = LazyDirichletSeriesRing(QQ, 't')
sage: L(D(z))
z + 2*z^2 + 3*z^3 + 4*z^4 + 5*z^5 + 6*z^6 + 7*z^7 + O(z^8)
sage: L(D([1,2,3]))
z + 2*z^2 + 3*z^3
sage: D(L([1,2,3]))
6 + 17/2^t + 34/3^t + 57/4^t + 86/5^t + 121/6^t + 162/7^t + O(1/(8^t))
```

I also think it would be better to disallow polynomial input for Dirichlet series.  I would rather require the user here to ask for `D(coefficients=q^2+1)`.

```
sage: P.<q> = QQ[]
sage: D(q^2+1)
2 + 5/2^t + 10/3^t + 17/4^t + 26/5^t + 37/6^t + 50/7^t + O(1/(8^t))
```

I made it so the first two fail, but they only fail because finite length Dirichlet series are not callable. If they become callable, then it will give a valid series output. I do not want to spend any more time making the code more brittle and complex to prevent some user input that may or may not be unwanted. There is no way to change the last one because it is callable and gets treated like a coefficient function, which is something the user might want. I would get upset as a user if `moebius` worked without naming the argument but another callable does not.

See comment above about callables.

Just a small suggestion: the `Ã¡` in `KalmÃ¡r` is not an ASCII letter, hence you should add the line `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` in the beginning of the `src/sage/rings/lazy_series.py` file.

I also said the same thing on another ticket before someone pointed out to me this is no longer necessary now that we are Python3 only.
