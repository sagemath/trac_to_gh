I have just one comment:

In `matA(n)` and `matId(n)` it should be mentioned that the field is GF(2). Also, `\delta_ij` in `matA` should be `\delta_{ij}`.

Other than that, the patch looks good to me.

I think you uploaded the older patch by mistake. :)

Yes, sorry about that. It is the correct version now.

Thanks.

Looks good and passes all doctests in `sage/coding` (it shouldn't be affecting anything else anyway) in 5.0-beta12. Positive review from my side.
