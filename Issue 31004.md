It would be nice to allow forgetful functors for manifolds. In particular:

- differentiable manifold -> topological manifold
- (Pseudo-)Riemannian manifold -> differentiable manifold
- topological manifold -> sets (?)

and probably even more. The last point might also be useful in terms of #30832.

At the moment, we have the following behavior (which could be seen as a bug):

```
sage: from sage.categories.functor import ForgetfulFunctor
sage: from sage.categories.manifolds import Manifolds
sage: F = ForgetfulFunctor(Manifolds(RR).Differentiable(), Manifolds().Topological())
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: F(M)
2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

I am a little hesitant to call it a bug because it still has that structure once it goes through the functor. The problem is the mutability and that you can make it leave the corresponding category. Now you could implement something specific that handles an instance of `Manifold`. Although I feel that getting something of this level of generality would be hard. I think you are probably better off implementing a mechanism in the `Manifold` class itself.

Something you could do is implement the corresponding `_call_` in the appropriate subcategories of `Manifolds` to handle the corresponding transferring of data. Although this probably would be a lot easier once there is a way to copy manifolds and reconstruct them, which I still need to do as part of the pickling fix...

Foremost charts, transition maps and their domains need to be copied since they encode the manifold's topology. I don't think that more data are necessary, except for the name and the dimension.

Is there a ticket devoted to pickling of manifolds yet?

That is exactly the punchline: adding a non-compatible chart (in the differentiable sense) which is still countinously compatible would corrupt the differentiable structure, but keep the maximal atlas of the topological manifold intact.

Otherwise the category of differentiable manifolds is not a subcategory of topological manifolds. So there would be no forgetful functor. Alternatively, you have a covering of your manifold by charts with maps to open subsets of R<sup>n</sup> that are diffeomorphic. The fact this is a covering forces any other chart to also be a diffeomorphism by the transition functions. Your maximal atlas cannot change under the forgetful functor.\n\n> That is exactly the punchline: adding a non-compatible chart (in the differentiable sense) which is still countinously compatible would corrupt the differentiable structure, but keep the maximal atlas of the topological manifold intact.\n\n\nWhich gives you a new distinct mathematical object. You cannot add information to the manifold by the forgetful functor. In the implementation here, you are not adding or changing the information, only \"discovering\" more.",

If you have a differentiable manifold `M` and apply the forgetful functor to it, you get the **same** manifold `M` back with the **same** maximal atlas. If you then "add" something that makes it not a differentiable manifold, then you actually have a *different* manifold because you have a different maximal atlas. So you are actually creating a copy with some of the initial information the same, but you then give information that your copy is different than what you started with. Having initial information is a programming concept, not a mathematical one.

> Mathematically this is wrong. As soon as you apply the forgetful functor from differentiable manifolds to topological manifolds, the maximal atlas changes accordingly. In particular, the maximal atlas now consists of all charts that are continuously compatible w.r.t. to all charts in the differentiable structure.


You're wrong. Otherwise the category of differentiable manifolds is not a subcategory of topological manifolds. So there would be no forgetful functor. Alternatively, you have a covering of your manifold by charts with maps to open subsets of R<sup>n</sup> that are diffeomorphic. The fact this is a covering forces any other chart to also be a diffeomorphism by the transition functions. Your maximal atlas cannot change under the forgetful functor.

> That is exactly the punchline: adding a non-compatible chart (in the differentiable sense) which is still countinously compatible would corrupt the differentiable structure, but keep the maximal atlas of the topological manifold intact.


Which gives you a new distinct mathematical object. You cannot add information to the manifold by the forgetful functor. In the implementation here, you are not adding or changing the information, only "discovering" more.

Why not? The differentiable structure is a subset of the maximal topological atlas, and the maximal atlas is uniquely determined by the differentiable structure, so I don't see any problems here.

In any case, it would be nice to copy a differentiable manifold in terms of a topological manifold. The forgetful functor would do the job in the mathematical sense.

Because you have a genuinely different manifold when your maximal atlas changes. This is *not* the result of applying the forgetful functor as an embedding of subcategories.

You also have to be careful that this is up to *equality*, not *isomorphism*.

See above. It is mathematically wrong to not obtain a differentiable manifold from the forgetful functor if you want differentiable manifolds to be a subcategory of topological manifolds. I don't see how the category of differentiable manifolds is not a subcategory of topological manifolds (in the mathematical sense of a subcategory). If you want to call this the forgetful functor, you need to prove to me that the maximal atlas actually changes.

Okay, I think we can see it as follows. A topological manifold comes equipped with a maximal *topological* atlas. This atlas contains all information about the topology and local Euclideanness.

To impose a differentiable structure, we add an additional atlas, namely the maximal *differentiable* atlas. So in a way, we can say that a differentiable manifold is endowed with two atlases. However, it turns out that the topological atlas is not needed because it can be recovered from the differentiable atlas.

Now, when we apply the forgetful functor, we simply forget about the differentiable atlas, and what remains is the maximal *topological* atlas.

So you were right when you said "the atlas does not change". I suppose I was just extremely sloppy here. Does that resolve some things?
