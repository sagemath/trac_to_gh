# Issue 25005: is_polynomial fails when multiple roots

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25242

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2018-04-24 14:16:52


```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
sage: F = DynamicalSystem([x^2+ y^2, x*y])
sage: F2 = F.conjugate(matrix(QQ,2,2, [1,2,3,5]))
sage: F2.is_polynomial()
```

When removing dividing out the roots, the exponent is not taken into account.

If the review was positive, there should be no change in the branch. Looking at the code it looks like you added a link to the test. That syntax I believe will fail to build correctly in the docs. See the new branch.

you should also ad yourself to the reviewer field

Thanks.

Also, I forgot to mention I'd like to add the keyword to gsoc tickets for future tracking.
