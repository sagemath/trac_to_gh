This is a second fix for the problem reported at #28334, the doctest failure in `rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx`. This fix does not rely on patching FLINT.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28649

As I said at #28334, the fix there can be kept independently of the change here, and it should be kept, since the patch to FLINT was accepted upstream. The one here is to handle the case when using non-patched versions of FLINT.

It may be possible to do this cross-platform in a relatively convenient way with ctypes anyway:

```
import ctypes
libc = ctypes.CDLL(ctypes.util.find_library("c"))
libc.fflush(0r)
```
seems to work, and looking at the source, it seems "find_library" does make an effort to be cross-platform. It's probably worth considering if this will do, since it's a lot lighter weight than running cython.

Any opinions on which approach to take? I see three options:

1. Keep the current branch. Slow, requires a functioning Cython compiler. (Is that guaranteed with binary releases?)

2. Add the `cyflush` function to the Sage library so that it is precompiled.

3. Take the `ctypes` approach from comment:17, with `libc = ctypes.CDLL(None)`.

Any opinions? I would like to get a solution to this problem merged, because there are people out there using non-Sage versions of FLINT.
