Pynac immediately factors out the positive content of a sum raised to an integer number:

```
sage: (5*cos(x) + 5)^2
25*(cos(x) + 1)^2
sage: (5*cos(x) + 5)^-3
1/125/(cos(x) + 1)^3

sage: (-5*x + 5)^-3
-1/125/(x - 1)^3
```

The last example shows how the leading coefficient is forced to be positive. This is not consistent with other CAS and considered a typical Sage quirk.

Also, the content of rational powers is usually extracted but we don't do this:

```
sage: sqrt(5*cos(x) + 5)
sqrt(5*cos(x) + 5)
```
