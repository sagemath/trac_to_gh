After a `make distclean`, I opened a new terminal with clean session (without sourcing hombrew-build-env) and did:

```
~$ git trac checkout 30536
~$ source .homebrew-build-env
~$ ./configure
```


I have not yet started the compilation, but I can see lines like:

```
checking for gfortran-9... gfortran-9
checking whether we are using the GNU Fortran compiler... yes
checking whether gfortran-9 accepts -g... yes
....
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG gfortran...
checking the version of gfortran-9... 9.3.0
configure: will use system package and not install SPKG gfortran
```


although I have

```
sapristi:sage dcoudert$ gfortran -v

Needs `./bootstrap` first

oups. effectively, I don't see fortran 9 anymore. `make build` on the way...

`make -j1 testlong`: All tests passed. Furthermore, sage starts normally which is not the case of 9.2.beta12 for me (crash).

For me this patch is good to go. Thank you.
