Keywords: Hecke algebra, characters, days88

This implements the basis qbar (as denoted by Ram-Remmel) for the ring of symmetric functions, which are q-deformations of the powersums. The character table for the Hecke algebra (with quadratic relation T<sup>2</sup> = (q-1)T + q) is obtained as the transition matrix from qbar to Schurs.

I called the new basis "Hecke algebra characters," but that is not quite right. However, I am not sure what a better name would be. Any thoughts?

Your conjectured formula for the coproduct is correct and can be derived from plethystic manipulation and equation (37) of Ram-Remmel (i.e. you can remove the warning).

```
qbar_n(X+Y) = h_n((X+Y)(1-1/q))q^n/(q-1) 
# \sum_{r=0}^n h_r(X(1-1/q)) h_{n-r}(Y(1-1/q)) q^n/(q-1)

Sounds like a nice addition.

Just a suggestion: what about parametrizing the basis by the two roots  q1, q2 of the quadratic relation (with q2=-1 as default)? This would be consistent with what we did with the non symmetric macdonald polynomials and the `IwahoriHeckeAlgebra`.

Cheers,

I've looked more closely and this set of functions is not a basis for q a root of unity, but rather than preventing the user from entering a root of unity you might want to have them act like the Hall-Littlewood Q basis at a root of unity. In fact, at q=-1 they span the same space of QQ[p_1, p_3, p_5, ...] = the space of Schur's Q functions.
I think that the most natural way of handling this will be to transform p_r -> qbar_\mu by the following relation:


```
(q^r-1)p_r = r*qbar_r - \sum_{i=1}^{r-1} (q-1)(q^i-1) p_i*qbar_{r-i}
```


To implement Nicolas' suggestion we would have to work out the Frobenius formula from the quadratic relation.

Another name that is a little less descriptive but a little more accurate (IMO) would be "deformed powersum." However, I am not convinced that this would be a better name as it is somewhat generic.

We might just want to let it fail with a warning in the documentation about certain values of q are bad (which is a theoretical issue because the Hecke algebra fails to be semisimple).

I think if this transition is implemented (instead of inverting the morphism through the Schur basis) the transition to and from classical bases won't choke unless you start with something that is not in the space.  This is because if `q` is an r'th root of unity then `p_r` is not in the algebra generated by the `qbar_d` but then the coefficient of `p_r` is equal to 0 in all expressions where it appears (so there should be no intermediate steps in going from `p` to `qbar` where you need to divide by 0).

Sage doesn't handle roots of unity very well, but the case when `q=-1` is a well studied space.  The Hall-Littlewood Q-basis specializes to Schur's Q functions.  This is is not well documented in Sage but if you want to work with Schur's Q-functions, you also might want to use this `hecke_character` basis for the same reason.

In my experience with NS macdo, the formulas for q1,q2 are usually
fairly straightforward to reverse engineer when you have the formulas
for one of the specializations (typically by doing some rescaling of
the T operators). But your mileage may vary.

It may take a bit of experimenting to see what is fastest, but it might be that `s->p->qbar` without the generic `q` implementation is faster because inverting a matrix can be slow (and this one isn't triangular) while the `p` and `qbar` are multiplicative bases.

I implemented the change of basis to the power sums because they are both multiplicative.  This is a significant speedup when the degree is large because there is no need to cache the whole change of basis matrix.

This basis does not play nice at roots of unity, so we can't really prevent users from raising errors if q is a root of unity, but my calculations do try to avoid raising errors by doing a few checks before dividing by something that might be 0.
