# Issue 19651: Move gen_py.python into the gen class

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19888

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-01-14 16:26:48

There is no reason for `gen_py.py` to be a separate file. We move the function `python()` into the `gen` class.
