How do you do test autogeneration (mentioned in 850b817) ?

The test method added in this commit is the raw output from #20376 (`LoggingBackend`) when run on the testcase of #18572.

Replying to [comment:17 git]:
> ||[d4eccf6](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=d4eccf6591dc17fd8a2487abd90bca55f31582f9)||`GurobiBackend.add_variable: Support coefficients keyword`||

Are there any plans to support this for other backends? I noticed that it's not even documented in `add_variable.__doc__` for the Gurobi backend.

The interface between backends should be consistent, so even just `raise NotImplementedError("the foo backend does not support the 'coefficients' argument")` in other backends would be good to have. What do you think?

IMHO different backends might have different features, which might be impossible to have for each backend.

Only if there are multiple backend supporting this, we can think of adding it to the generic backend, with the default implementation as you propose.

Yes, there is a plan, see #20324.
