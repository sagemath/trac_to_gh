Are there any plans to support this for other backends? I noticed that it's not even documented in `add_variable.__doc__` for the Gurobi backend.

The interface between backends should be consistent, so even just `raise NotImplementedError("the foo backend does not support the 'coefficients' argument")` in other backends would be good to have. What do you think?

IMHO different backends might have different features, which might be impossible to have for each backend.

Only if there are multiple backend supporting this, we can think of adding it to the generic backend, with the default implementation as you propose.
