A little more documentation needed, then it will need review.

Documentation and Examples have been added.  Dylan, this should be ready for review.

You could use the arxiv role `:arxiv:`1208.2391``

some remarks: you could

* use latex markup, for example ``x_2``
* add a reference to the article you cite
* use the role `:arxiv:`1208.2391`` in this reference
* remove the #print that you used to check the methods
* use a better name than cc

Thanks Frédéric.  I will take a look and get back to you in a few days.  

Dylan, are you still getting these messages?

Best, Gregg

Dear Frédéric, I have now have time to look over your changes, and they look good to me.

I also took your advice and renamed the function cc to coeff_recurs.  It appears that the codes works fine with your changes and my little change from this morning.  

I will also wait to see if Dylan has further comments or changes.  Do you see anything else that needs changing before a positive review?

Thanks again,
Gregg

Fixed a bug in greedy where S.greedy(a1,a2,'by_combinatorics') only was working (previously) when a_1 >= a_2.

Now the formula works even if a_1 < a_2.
