Dear Frédéric, I have now have time to look over your changes, and they look good to me.

I also took your advice and renamed the function cc to coeff_recurs.  It appears that the codes works fine with your changes and my little change from this morning.  

I will also wait to see if Dylan has further comments or changes.  Do you see anything else that needs changing before a positive review?

Thanks again,
Gregg

Fixed a bug in greedy where S.greedy(a1,a2,'by_combinatorics') only was working (previously) when a_1 >= a_2.

Now the formula works even if a_1 < a_2.
