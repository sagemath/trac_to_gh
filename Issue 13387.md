# Issue 13387: Improve padic add_bigoh

There are a few minor issues with `add_bigoh()` of the padics:

I believe that all these should produce errors:

```
sage: K = ZpCR(3,20)
sage: K.one().add_bigoh(-1)
O(3^-1)
sage: K = ZpCA(3,20)
sage: K.one().add_bigoh(-1)
O(3^0)
sage: K = ZpFM(3,20)
sage: K.one().add_bigoh(10)
1 + O(3^20)
```


Additionally, `add_bigoh()` doesn't work for infinity which can be annoying sometimes:

```
sage: K.one().add_bigoh(infinity)
TypeError: unable to coerce <class 'sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity'> to an integer
```

* making it work for infinity is great
* I'm fairly ambivalent about what happens when you add_big_oh(-1) to a ring element.  Certainly the current behavior is inconsistent and should be changed.  But I usually think about x.add_bigoh(n) as being equivalent to x + O(p<sup>n</sup>) (just more efficient).  If that's true then both of your K.one().add_bigoh(-1) should return O(3<sup>-1</sup>) in the fraction field.  Another benefit of this choice is that the behavior is the same for elements of K and K.fraction_field(), which I think is a good thing when we can manage it.  Why do you think we should raise an error when there's a sensible answer?
* I do think that ZpFM(3,20).one().add_bigoh(10) should not raise an error.  The whole point of fixed modulus elements is that they don't worry about precision.

Right. This makes more sense. The problem was that it returned `O(3^-1)` in the ring but not in the fraction field â€” probably we should not allow elements with negative absolute precision in the ring (but this will be a different ticket). I'll change it accordingly.

Ok. I'll change that. I have no strong opinion about it.

Doesn't the sig_on()/sig_off() slow it down too much?

Thanks for having a look. I'll perform some tests and see whether it makes a difference.

I removed the `sig_on()/sig_off()` in creduce. The one in `prime_pow` did not make a difference in my tests so I kept it and added some comments.

David, could you review this? It touches things that you wrote and maybe I do not fully understand the implications of this last change.

I messed up this merge. I introduced a new commit to fix the merge. Sorry for that.

Only the additional fixes on top of what Aly reviewed need to be looked at.
