There are a few minor issues with `add_bigoh()` of the padics:

I believe that all these should produce errors:

```
sage: K = ZpCR(3,20)
sage: K.one().add_bigoh(-1)
O(3^-1)
sage: K = ZpCA(3,20)
sage: K.one().add_bigoh(-1)
O(3^0)
sage: K = ZpFM(3,20)
sage: K.one().add_bigoh(10)
1 + O(3^20)
```


Additionally, `add_bigoh()` doesn't work for infinity which can be annoying sometimes:

```
sage: K.one().add_bigoh(infinity)
TypeError: unable to coerce <class 'sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity'> to an integer
```

Right. This makes more sense. The problem was that it returned `O(3^-1)` in the ring but not in the fraction field â€” probably we should not allow elements with negative absolute precision in the ring (but this will be a different ticket). I'll change it accordingly.
> * I do think that ZpFM(3,20).one().add_bigoh(10) should not raise an error.  The whole point of fixed modulus elements is that they don't worry about precision.
Ok. I'll change that. I have no strong opinion about it.
