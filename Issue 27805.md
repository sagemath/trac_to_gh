Yes. For some reason, there are three implementations of modular arithmetic: `IntegerMod_gmp`, `IntegerMod_int` and `IntegerMod_int64` (see `rings.finite_rings.integer_mod`). When it turns to linear algebra one has to carefully use the correct type.

Thanks Vincent and Dima, this is great! I confirm this fixes the issue on my side too.
I think I can positive review the ticket. I just wondered whether one should also worry on the second bug raised: the fact that once coerced to the integers the result was off by 1. Any thought on whether this should be handled in this ticket, or should we wait for a next ticket?

If you can reproduce your "second bug" on top of the branch provided then a ticket should definitely be opened. The return type of the dot product was simply wrong. I don't think there is any more coercion trouble now.

I gather that `IntegerMod_gmp` is not affected (as it's not handled , it's only these two "small" modn instances that got mixed up.
