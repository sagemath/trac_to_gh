We currently have:

```
sage: SGA = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: T = tensor([SGA]*3)
sage: T in Modules(QQ).FiniteDimensional()
False
```

I was wondering if we should perhaps have this at the category level, but I was thinking we might want to consider an infinite tensor product in the category. So instead I just added a check for finite-dimensionality in the CFM tensor class.

I also came across this:

```
sage: Modules(ZZ).TensorProducts()
Category of objects
```

and I decided to fix it here too.
