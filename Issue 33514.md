This is awful.

`hnf` calls `probable_hnf` unconditionally. `probable_hnf` clearly states that it might raise an exception and must be called again in this case. The documentation of `hnf` makes no such statements and I guess just assumes that `probable_hnf` is always correct.

But running something in an infinite loop until it works is also an awful idea, I guess.

I guess in the case of `proof=True` we just add another test to the loop.
I still do not like the idea of running something in infinite loop (especially as I don't even know what it is doing).

But `probable_hnf` explicitly states that this can happen and that in this case it should be called again, so `hnf` with `proof=True` should account for this.
