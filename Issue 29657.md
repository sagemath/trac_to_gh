So that one may use this later to compute determinants in this case, for example.

Could we add at least one little direct use for this interface, say in computing the determinants as mentioned in the ticket description?

ok, I will try to think about it. I had some use case, but it turned out to be slower than the existing method.

That is interesting and surprising to me. Bill probably would like to know about that. The flint version might also be asymptotically faster. Plus, I am generally a fan of having multiple implementations available and giving the choice to the user (if for nothing else other than testing).

```

My test case was (for M upper triangular square matrix with 1 on the diagonal)

```
det(x M^t + M)
```

versus

```
charpoly(-M (M^t)^(-1))
```

and the inversion + product + charpoly over ZZ was much faster than the det over ZZ[x]

Perhaps that is just a special case of the fact it is a upper unitriangular matrix? Anyways, I am not going to fret over not having a definitive use case at this time. It doesn't hurt anything to have the interface all setup.
