This works for me, with or without `gfortran`. With just #29562, `gfortran` does indeed fail. This branch doesn't apply cleanly on top of #29562, I think, but I don't know if that matters.

But Sage doesn't use the system's Singular. I don't understand.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-04-29 19:16:06

No, but some dependencies of Singular are coming from the system.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-04-29 19:42:37

Do you know which packages? I haven't seen these doctest failures, but I could install more homebrew packages to try to reproduce them.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-04-29 19:46:08

The error can be reproduced in the standard homebrew environment set up by `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard -- ptest`.

I am now trying with ` EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-mp=mpir" tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard -- ptest` to disable use of homebrew's GMP.

Any help with debugging this would be very welcome!


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-04-29 19:50:27

The failures can be seen, for example, in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/628776278


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2020-04-29 20:20:06

Looks like failures in the pexpect interface to singular if I read those logs correctly and I haven't missed anything. This make `readline` the number one suspect amongst `singular`'s dependencies (`ntl`, `gmp`, `cddlib`, `flint`).


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-04-29 20:59:28

I'll try `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard -- ptest`. In my current setup (in which I don't see any failures), the hints at the end of running `./configure` only suggest installing `cmake`, which implies (?) that I have everything in `homebrew-macos-standard` already. (The comment in `tox.ini` says "Install all known system packages equivalent to standard packages that have spkg-configure.m4", but it must actually require both an spkg-configure.m4 and distros/homebrew.txt, right?)

Note that tox installs its own copy of homebrew, independent of the one in /usr/local.

Right, with this clarification it describes correctly the behavior for the `docker-....` environments. For `local-homebrew`, however, the implementation cheats a little bit (fixing this is one of the tasks of #29146). See line 323 of `tox.ini` to see how the system package list is determined:

```
    homebrew-standard:   bash -c 'PACKAGES=`sed "s/#.*//;" build/pkgs/*/distros/homebrew.txt`; {env:HOMEBREW}/bin/brew install $PACKAGES; {env:HOMEBREW}/bin/brew upgrade $PACKAGES'
```

So it really just installs every package listed in any `homebrew.txt`

The error also shows in `local-homebrew-macos-python2-standard`.

On the other hand: `local-homebrew-macos-python3_pythonorg-minimal` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/628776310) and  `local-homebrew-macos-python2-minimal` are clean.

This build does not have the failure

`EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--without-system-readline" tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard -- ptest` has the failure


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2020-04-30 04:38:42

Hum, I guess that could have predicted on the fact that only singular displayed the failure. Still, there is something fishy happening in `sage/interface/singular.py`. Incidentally, after scanning the singular libraries, it appears that `mpfr` is a direct dependency of `singular` - not just through `flint`. I certainly need to update the dependency list in Gentoo.

I can't even get Sage to build with `tox -e local-homebrew-macos-standard -- ptest` with this branch or without: the Sage library fails with

```
In file included from build/cythonized/sage/tests/stl_vector.cpp:663:
./sage/libs/ntl/ntlwrap.h:5:10: fatal error: 'NTL/ZZ.h' file not found

Sage builds fine and passes tests (except for those at #29493) with `make ptestlong`.

Do you happen to have NTL from homebrew installed in `/usr/local` (`brew info ntl`)?

---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-04-30 22:39:11

There is a problem with `/usr/local` interaction. FLINT's configure script is severely broken (that's not exactly news, but...): it puts `/usr/local/include/` in as explicit defaults and stuff there can override what we have in $SAGE_LOCAL.


---

For flint, adding `--with-gmp=$SAGE_LOCAL` is fine even if gmp is not there and is found from the system.

From your log:

This is an interesting variant of the failure mode of #29000, #29448 - where `./configure` finds a library but then the package needing it does not. In this case, Homebrew's NTL in `/usr/local` is found by `./configure`. But we compile Python modules using ` g++ -bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk`, where the `-isysroot` disables the use of `/usr/local`.

... in the commit above.

Probably the `spkg-install` of other packages with the same build system as FLINT need to be changed in the same way.

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-05-01 08:26:26

how is this going to work on systems where /usr/local (or suchlike, e.g these keg-only installs on Homebrew) needs to be spelled out for a library  location to be useful?

Would this break FreeBSD? Thierry, care to test this branch?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-05-01 15:32:09

As you know, `/usr/local` is part of the normal library and include search path of the compiler. It does not need a `-I` or `-L` option.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-05-01 15:46:16

Standard configure scripts do not deal with `/usr/local` specifically at all but only check what the compiler/linker is able to find.
The changes to the spkg-configure scripts for FLINT and arb only work around nonstandard behavior of their configure scripts.

---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-05-01 16:28:51

Do other packages' configure scripts look for stuff in /usr/local on FreeBSD even though the compiler does not?


---

Comment by @thierry-FreeBSD created at 2020-05-01 16:35:07

On FreeBSD, if you do not use the ports mechanism, you are right, /usr/local is not in the default search paths for include and libs, but when you create (or modify) a port (I'm in this context), you just have to define:


```
USES=localbase
```


to solve this common problem.


---

Now that we know what we need to know about FreeBSD, can we come back to the review of this ticket?

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-05-01 17:58:47

I think it's rather #29562 that needs to be done differently. 
I don't understand that `/usr/local` being "always wrong".
What if I install GMP there and want to build Sage using it?


Actually, one just needs to use proper Homebrew formulae for arb and flint, as I experimented on
https://github.com/sagemath/homebrew-science 
(and push the needed changes upstream)

The present ticket *is* changing what #29562 did.

> I don't understand that `/usr/local` being "always wrong".

Look at the configure scripts of FLINT and arb. They are putting `/usr/local` explicitly in the compiler and linker lines as -I and -L flags. This overrides correct paths that are configured by the user's CPATH and -I options etc.

> What if I install GMP there and want to build Sage using it?

Yes, this still works. We do this on homebrew all the time.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-05-01 18:46:48

How about we just patch these configure scripts to remove `-I /usr/local` etc?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-05-01 18:59:00

How is this better than just providing the options that work?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-05-01 19:22:12

Of course, an upstreamable patch for FLINT and arb would be good. Upstream indicates in https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/issues/400 that  2.6.0 (from FLINT trunk) is "nearly out" (as of 3 weeks ago). But I don't want to work on patches to a broken ad-hoc configure script at this point. FLINT trunk also has a CMake build system (not the default), so there is hope.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-05-02 06:25:55

I looked at arb's [./configure script](https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/blob/master/configure), and don't see where they unconditionally put /usr/local anywhere.

Are you sure it's not coming from somewhere else, e.g. some Homebrew flags set?

No, not "unconditionally", which is exactly why this ticket is able to fix it by providing options to that configure script.

From the diff:

```
+# Trac #29607: We must always supply --with-gmp, --with-mpfr,
+# --with-flint because otherwise ARB's configure script uses
+# /usr/local, which is always wrong.
+# This is why we do not use $SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP etc. here.
+# The value $SAGE_LOCAL is always a safe choice even if the library
+# is coming from the system and is found using what is in
+# LIBRARY_PATH or LDFLAGS etc.
```

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-05-02 17:29:14

How can you be sure that SAGE_LOCAL/include/ and SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ exist when arb is built?
(If one of them does not exist then it will error out).
