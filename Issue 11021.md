# Issue 11021: Stembridge local characterization for crystal bases

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: sdenton

Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: crystals

Implementation of the Stembridge local axioms for crystal bases.  Some functions added for checking these axioms, and _test_stembridge_local_axioms() was added to the test suite for highest weight crystals.

This patch implements the local axioms for highest weight crystals of simply-laced types. This is a very useful test to check that a given crystal is actually consistent (for simply-laced types these tests are necessary and sufficient, for nonsimply-laced types only necessary). I tested this patch mathematically on several crystals.

sage -t on all relevant crystal code passes. If the buildbot gives green light for all tests, this is a positive review!

Currently, the tests in /sage/categories/examples/crystals.py do not pass and need to be updated. In addition, it would be good to provide an implementation of a simple "crystal" that does not pass the Stembridge tests in this file.

So I set this to "needs work".

I reviewed the final version of the patch and it looks good now! The tests of all modified files pass. If the buildbot gives a green light, this has a positive review!

Note: I had to (trivially) rebase #10998 on top of this patch. Please check that the queue apply next time :-)

Oops, #9280 in fact.

The first line of the patch file is

```
exporting patch:
```


This should not be there.  Probably you made some script which writes such a line, I think it is best to undo that.

Also, there are some problems building the documentation:

```

This spurious line was removed in the revised patch.

Best wishes,

The two warnings should be fixed in the revised patch.
