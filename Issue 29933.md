We introduce the axiom Lipschitz,
with the special case (Lipschitz constant 1) of metric maps.

The morphisms in the category of metric spaces are the metric maps.

We add a Parent method `_test...` that verifies it.

In addition, I also want to define the category of metric spaces with Lipschitz functions. Should I do something like below, or would I create a category `MetricSpacesWithLipschitzFunctions`?


```diff

I think adding a `HomsetsCategory` is the correct thing to do. However, I haven't see this done before, so I am not 100% sure. Perhaps Nicolas you could give some insight here?
