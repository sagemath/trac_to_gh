# Issue 18306: legend label doesn't distinguish line and dash

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18543

Compare the output of these three.

```
sage: plot(x,(x,1,100),linestyle=':', legend_label='foo')

sage: plot(x,(x,1,100),linestyle='--', legend_label='foo')

sage: plot(x,(x,1,100),linestyle='-', legend_label='foo')
```

There is a _very_ subtle difference between the last two, I think, but not enough to be useful.  Let's fix this.

Note that [the legend options](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/graphics.html#sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.set_legend_options) allow this to be fixed, in principle, but I'm not sure what the _defaults_ should be.

I am pretty sure this should work : ` legend_handlelength=2,`.  I used this some years earlier in my work. See the end of the file here : https://github.com/ppurka/papers/blob/master/decoding_permutations/sage/run_simulation.sage

I tried that, but only `P.set_legend_options(handlelength=2)` seemed to work.  Maybe I needed to do it in `show` and not just the plot?

Anyway, the ticket is about _defaults_ and what we should have to fix this.

Yes. I think the legends are parsed during show or save, not in plot.

So maybe that is also a bug, that one can't just send `legend_handlelength=2` directly in `plot`.  What do you think?

There are many things that can't be set through plot I think. This is not really a bug.

Ok. It is a bug since the documentation days "Extra options will get passed on to show(), as long as they are valid:"

Right - or the documentation is wrong.  But in theory everything is supposed to get passed on to show.

In fact, that is #10616 - I _knew_ that I had seen that somewhere!

(Also barely related is #13543.)
