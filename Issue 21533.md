Sage-7.6.beta4 + #20523 + #21767 + #21770 (this patch) passes ptestlong witht two transient errors :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_set_morphism.py  # Bad exit: 2
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Both tests pass when run standalone.

This should close the R saga (for now) by allowing the current interfaces to work with R >= 3.3.x.

Still `needs_review`

We've already been there (see previous saga...) :
* R is a standard package
* R depends on PCRE starting 3.3.x
* A standard package cannot depend on an optional package

Therefore pcre has to be standard. QED.

OK. If I follow you :
* PCRE is not used by anything in Sage
* PCRE is used by R

Therefore, by //modus tollens//:
* R is not in Sage.

We should submit this interesting conclusion to `sage-devel` : the discussion would probably be lively and entertaining (for questionable values of "entertaining"...).

Is the `--enable-jit` flag really required? It already caused problems on Cygwin and it is breaking on Solaris too (#24628).
