`CombinatorialFreeModule._element_constructor_` says this:

```
        Do not rely on the following feature which may be removed in the future::

            sage: QS3 = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ,3)
            sage: QS3([2,3,1])     # indirect doctest
            [2, 3, 1]
```

Here we actually deprecate it.
