Summary says it all.  This will make it so that if you attach foo.sage to a worksheet, then you can type 

```
load foo.sage
```

which is desirable, and better than requiring 

```
load DATA+"foo.sage"
```


I think this really is a Sage ticket, not a notebook ticket, due to where this code goes.

This is very closely related to https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/107, enough so that I'll presume it to be reported.

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
