In the Reference Manual, section 16.2, the phrase "DOTSAGE/dsage/server.log" is wmis-formatted thrice.

It would also be helpful in my opinion if the title of this section included the phrase "dsage" (or "DSage"), as this is the name of the package and it would make it easier to search for in the page.

Also, in

`f = DistributedFactor(P, number, name='my_factor')`

the P should be a D, as D is the label used for DSage here.
