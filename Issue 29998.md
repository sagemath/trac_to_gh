We will need to be really careful with this because lots of classes are subclasses of `CFM`, where the result of `construction()` will become wrong if we do the generic one.

However, I am generally +1 on doing this. There is a ticket out there on implementing extension of scalars, and this would be a step towards doing that generically by being able to implement pushouts.

Yes, I see a few dozen testsuite failures (`_test_construction`) in `sage.combinat` now.

Yes

While the subclass for the construction version is the proper way to do it, I am not sure how much of a hassle it will create long-term once we have a more general way to do constructions for things that subclass CFM. The hack way would be

```python
def construction(self):
    if self.__class__.__mro__[1] == CombinatorialFreeModule:
         return VectorFunctor(...)
    return super().construction()
```

(We cannot to `type(self) == CFM` because of the dynamic class created from the category. There is a function or method to get this more robustly, but I don't remember offhand.) I am fairly convinced that your proposal is how we should go, but I just have this little nagging doubt.

One thing that does need to be changed is that we will have two `CFM` classes with (almost) identical (public) documentations. This is easy to fix by adding a class-level doc to the new class explaining the difference.

Indeed, although I think that is even more of a hack since it is doing stuff non-locally (to the method).
