Hello,

I fixed conflicts that arose after the update to Sage 7.3beta1.
This is still open for review.

Hi David,

I fixed some stuff in the doc, add sanity check and modified the `decoding_radius` method. Green light for the rest of the code.

Best,

Julien

Hello,

There was a few broken doctests, which I fixed.
I agree with the changes you made on the ticket, and if you're ok with my fix, you can set this to `positive_review`.

Best,
