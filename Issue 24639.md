Bug in the .as_partition_dictionary() method. The following code gives a value error.

```
sage: for tau in SimilarityClassTypes(3):
          print tau.as_partition_dictionary()
```

The error is

```
ValueError: [1, 2] is not an element of Partitions
```


Error in sage 8.1 running on 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04.
