When doctesting Sage with #14136 the following `DeprecationWarning` appears:


`doctest:201: DeprecationWarning: object.__init__() takes no parameters`  


which was reported on sage-devel ([https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/wQoCEeKrZ3w](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/wQoCEeKrZ3w)). The warning seems to be associated with the use of the `BoundClass` which inherits from 
functools.partial ([http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14136#comment:19](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14136#comment:19)). The attached patch is an attempt to work around the warning.

    DeprecationWarning: object.__init__() takes no parameters

I had never noticed this. Please explore for a good workaround!

Hey Steven,

Could you please format the doctests in the following format:

```
    Make sure classes which inherit from functools.partial have the correct syntax, see
    :trac:`14136` and :trac:`14748`::

        sage: import warnings
        sage: warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)
        sage: import functools
        sage: def f(x, y): return x^y
        sage: g = functools.partial(f, 2, 3)
        sage: g()
        8
```

In particular, there are 2 colons at the end of the text line and a blankline immediately following it. Also for the line above, I autolinked to the trac tickets which uses the syntax `:trac:`12345``. Could you fix these?

Thanks,

Travis

Thanks Travis. Before I make changes, additionally what is the correct way to format the returned expression

```
----> 3         functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)
```

The `----> 3` only appears when things are entered from the Sage prompt. I suspect it is ignored when doctesting. When doctesting a file that which is returned is something like

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)
```

Doctesting seems to be insensitive to either of the above when comparing Expected: to Got: as long as there is some whitespace before

```
functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)
```
