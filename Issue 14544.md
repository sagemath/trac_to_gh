# Issue 14544: Deal with DeprecationWarning(s) that appear when using the BoundClass

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14748

Original creator: strogdon

Original creation time: 2013-06-15 19:02:57

Assignee: jason

CC:  nthiery darij tscrim

When doctesting Sage with #14136 the following `DeprecationWarning` appears:


`doctest:201: DeprecationWarning: object.__init__() takes no parameters`  


which was reported on sage-devel ([https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/wQoCEeKrZ3w](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/wQoCEeKrZ3w)). The warning seems to be associated with the use of the `BoundClass` which inherits from 
functools.partial ([http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14136#comment:19](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14136#comment:19)). The attached patch is an attempt to work around the warning.

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to defect.

This doesn't seem to break anything, and the failing patchbot test doesn't seem to be related and passed for me:

```
sage -t --long ../interfaces/expect.py
    [81 tests, 79.66 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 80.3 seconds
    cpu time: 1.6 seconds
```

So I'm giving this a positive review.

Thanks for fixing my code; this sounds good! Please add a doctest to prevent a future regression though.

Sorry for the delay. I've had limited internet access for the last several days and things will not improve for the next 4 or 5 days. Initially I thought the doctest would be straightforward? However, It's not as easy to catch deprecations with the doctest framework as it is to catch them from the Sage prompt. It may be that bindable_class.py will have to be modified to import the warnings module before a meaningful doctest can be implemented. Thus, I'm not exactly sure what's the best way to proceed. Of course, one could implement a doctest with calls to `QuasiSymmetricFunctions` that exhibited the initial `DeprecationWarning` at trac #14136, but I don't see that as failsafe.

Quoth Nicolas (he just asked me to post this quote from one of his emails):


```
The warning comes when trying to
inherit from it functools.partial:


    sage: import warnings
    sage: warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)
    sage: import functools
    sage: def f(x): return x
    sage: g = functools.partial(f,1)
    sage: g()
    1
    sage: class mypartial(functools.partial):
    ....:     def __init__(self, f, i):
    ....:         functools.partial.__init__(self, f,i)
    sage: g = mypartial(f,1)
    Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...
    ----> 3                 functools.partial.__init__(self, f,i)
    DeprecationWarning: object.__init__() takes no parameters
    sage: g()
    1

I had never noticed this. Please explore for a good workaround!
```

OK, I was doing something just plain wrong. Attached is a patch to include a doctest. Apply this new patch along with the deprecationwarning patch.

Hey Steven,

Could you please format the doctests in the following format:

```
    Make sure classes which inherit from functools.partial have the correct syntax, see
    :trac:`14136` and :trac:`14748`::

        sage: import warnings
        sage: warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)
        sage: import functools
        sage: def f(x, y): return x^y
        sage: g = functools.partial(f, 2, 3)
        sage: g()
        8
```

In particular, there are 2 colons at the end of the text line and a blankline immediately following it. Also for the line above, I autolinked to the trac tickets which uses the syntax `:trac:`12345``. Could you fix these?

Thanks,

Travis

Thanks Travis. Before I make changes, additionally what is the correct way to format the returned expression

```
----> 3         functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)
```

The `----> 3` only appears when things are entered from the Sage prompt. I suspect it is ignored when doctesting. When doctesting a file that which is returned is something like

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)
```

Doctesting seems to be insensitive to either of the above when comparing Expected: to Got: as long as there is some whitespace before

```
functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)
```



---

Comment by tscrim created at 2013-06-25 06:28:43

Insensitivity to the whitespace is the expected (and often useful) behavior. The correct way to return an error being raised is what you had (but it is generally at the same indentation level):

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)
```

The most important thing is that all tests pass when running `sage -t bindable_class.py`.

Best,

Travis

Does anyone know why the patchbot is complaining? Is it because of new continuation line syntax - `....:` instead of `...` or is something else up?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2013-06-28 17:51:14

You are correct, it is because of the line continuation docstring syntax. Here's a review patch which fixes it and does some minor tweaks. If you're happy with my changes, you can set this to positive review.

Comment by strogdon created at 2013-06-28 21:01:49

Is the indentation level correct on the `def` line from the reviewer patch?


```
         sage: class mypartial(functools.partial):
-        ...       def __init__(self, f, i, j):
-        ...           functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)
+        ....:    def __init__(self, f, i, j):
+        ....:         functools.partial.__init__(self, f, i, j)

```


I'll let you decide. Perhaps it's not important. There are no failures and otherwise it looks good.

No, it was one short. Good catch.

Comment by strogdon created at 2013-06-29 15:49:14

I hadn't checked the revised reviewer patch until today. It appears it has incorrect line endings

```
file trac_14748-review-ts.patch
trac_14748-review-ts.patch: unified diff output, ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
```

and thus fails to apply. If I convert to UNIX everything is fine.

That's what I get for adding the space to the patch on a windows machine. Could you fold all of the patches into one patch and (re)upload? Thanks.
