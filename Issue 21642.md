CC:  roed caruso

Keywords: Rings, injectivity, is_injective, MorphismMethods, is_subring

Currently, `is_injective` is almost never implemented:

```
sage: ZZ.hom(QQ).is_injective()
NotImplementedError
sage: QQ.hom(QQ).is_injective()
NotImplementedError
```

This makes the method `is_subring` essentially useless since it relies on `is_injective` of the "natural map":

```
sage: GF(3).is_subring(GF(9))
NotImplementedError
```

The changes introduced here, implement it as a method of the morphisms in the category of Rings where we can handle many common cases of morphisms (domain is a field, ….)

Note that `is_injective` is now faster even for the one case where it just returned `True` before.

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: f = K.hom(x)
sage: %timeit f.is_injective()
```

Went down from 182ns to 76ns (which is of course due to the ``@`cached_method`.) Without it, it goes up to 13µs.
