# Issue 31262: Check OpenMP at configuration

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31499

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2021-03-15 11:54:13

CC:  tscrim mkoeppe fbissey @kliem winfried

Keywords: openmp, cython, parallel

We define cython aliases `OPENMP_CFLAGS` and `OPENMP_CXXFLAGS`.

They must be used as `extra_link_args` and `extra_compile_args` to get `cython.parallel` to work in parallel.

If they are empty, `cython.parallel.prange` will still compile and work (but not in parallel). This is useful in case that OpenMP isn't supported, see e.g. https://github.com/kliem/sage/pull/40/checks?check_run_id=2076988665).

With this ticket we can just run

```
sage: cython(''' 
....: #distutils: extra_compile_args = OPENMP_CFLAGS 
....: #distutils: extra_link_args = OPENMP_CFLAGS 
....: from cython.parallel import prange 
....:  
....: cdef int i 
....: cdef int n = 30 
....: cdef int sum = 0 
....:  
....: for i in prange(n, num_threads=4, nogil=True): 
....:     sum += i 
....:      
....: print(sum) 
....: ''')
```

regardless of whether the current system actually supports OpenMP.

Seems fair. Why is the extra test in `python3/spkg-configure` needed? Is it to deal with case where the compiler used to build python is not the same as the rest of sage?

```
+    # OpenMP
+    aliases["OPENMP_CFLAGS"] = [SAGE_OPENMP_CFLAGS] if SAGE_OPENMP_CFLAGS else []
+    aliases["OPENMP_CXXFLAGS"] = [SAGE_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS] if SAGE_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS else []
+
```

As `SAGE_OPENMP_CFLAGS` could probably consist of several arguments separated by space, perhaps this should be `aliases["OPENMP_CFLAGS"] = SAGE_OPENMP_CFLAGS.split()`?

Good point.

Exactly. In #27122 I didn't consider this and then we had to solve #30725. This was the solution we came up with (just reject OpenMP alltogether, if we cannot find consistent arguments to make it work.)

We don't try as hard as we could (if sage uses gcc, but for cython clang, it still might be possible to enable OpenMP for cython with different arguments). But this solution here should enable OpenMP in cython on many platforms and still work on the others.

Argh!!! I was going to answer that - hours ago - but I got interrupted by my day work (which is currently horrible, 2021 so far is worse for me than the whole of 2020). 

```
ax_cv_[]_AC_LANG_ABBREV[]_openmp=unknown
# Flags to try:  -fopenmp (gcc), -mp (SGI & PGI),
#                -qopenmp (icc>=15), -openmp (icc),
#                -xopenmp (Sun), -omp (Tru64),
#                -qsmp=omp (AIX),
#                none
```

As you can see there is only a single switch in each case which tells the compiler what headers and macro to enable at compile time and what library to use at link time. The greatest danger usually is that people, or build systems, forget you should also include the CFLAGS at linking time. Very often `-lgomp` or similar is missing because of that oversight.

I guess that proof things in case things change in the future (most likely several years).

It would be better to set the new variables in `sage_conf.py.in`, not `sage-env-config.in`, because they are not used as environment variables. See comments at the top of these files.

And I think you can get rid of `SAGE_HAVE_OPENMP` completely - in `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4` just check whether the flags are nonempty.

I guess that should be `AS_IF([test -n "$OPENMP_CFLAGS$OPENMP_CXXFLAGS"]` (test both)

And `SAGE_OPENMP_CFLAGS.split() if SAGE_OPENMP_CFLAGS else []` can be simplified to just `SAGE_OPENMP_CFLAGS.split()`

... if you set a default of `""` in `env.py`

On macOS (using /usr/bin/gcc) I am getting

```
checking whether C++ compiler accepts "-march=native"... yes
checking for OpenMP flag of C compiler... unknown
checking for OpenMP flag of C++ compiler... unknown
```

is this expected?

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-03-24 20:28:07

Also, best to merge #31384 which touches the same function and will cause a merge conflict

macOS might be a bit more complicated. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66040039/openmp-support-for-mac-using-clang-or-gcc

I'm happy to add whatever to the list to make it work. Maybe `-Xclang -fopenmp` will work for you?

Comment by @kliem created at 2021-03-24 20:45:23

I usually take the example from `src/sage/env.py` to check whether it works.


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2021-03-24 23:17:54

How about `-fopenmp=libgomp`? Found this is in normaliz (but it is commented out).


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-03-25 05:25:45

Let's just take this to mean that Xcode's gcc can't do OpenMP.
Good enough for this ticket.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.
