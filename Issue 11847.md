sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/ linear_programming.rst" ********************************************************************** File "/mnt/sda6/COMPILE/sage-4.7.2/devel/sage/doc/en/ thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.rst", line 366:

  sage: [e for e,b in matching.iteritems() if b == 1]

Expected:

  [(0, 1), (6, 9), (2, 7), (3, 4), (5, 8)]

Got:

  [(1, 6), (0, 4), (2, 3), (5, 8), (7, 9)]

**********************************************************************
```

The result is correct but it is different from the expected solution. The tested problem has multible solutions and it seems that the result os the example is machine dependent.

the proposed fix is to flag the example as "not tested" and also to change the documentation that users are aware that there might be more than one solution.

I don't know the reason for this dependency but Nathann Cohen mentioned it might depend on the GLPK library.

I think that adding a flag "not tested" to this line is more than sufficient in this case. The LP code is being tested in so many places (and the matching stuff too), that everything would fail (and actually does, when there is the slightest bug with MIP) if there is anything wrong.

I would like to know on which system these failures occur.  Sage has been widely tested on many different systems, so I'm surprised to see this failure.

this one seems food enough for me...
I attach system report :-)
strange thing is, it happened the first time for me

I mean the error was not there with the previous versions I compiled (4.31, 4.32, 4.6, 4.61)
