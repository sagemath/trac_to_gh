In #19127, the automatic deleting of empty directories was removed, because of the mistaken assumption that it was not needed. While it's not needed in all cases, it is needed in one case:

it can happen that `git checkout` leaves behind an empty directory (since it does not track directories), for example `$SAGE_DOC/en/reference/manifolds`. These directories should be deleted, otherwise Sphinx complains.

Looks good. With previous versions of docbuilding, there were many empty directories and so I objected to printing out the message `Deleting empty directory ...` for each one. With this version, we should usually have just a few empty directories, if any, so it's fine to print it.
