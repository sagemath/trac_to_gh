From the `sage-devel` report, it seems that the problem is in the `gphelp` script, not in `doc_make` (I'm not saying they are not related, but at least this fix might not be sufficient).

This patch works (although it gives 11152 deprecation warnings when auto-generating the PARI functions), but I'd rather wait a bit to give upstream a chance to fix this in a proper way.

However, if you need to release Sage 6.8 very soon, you can merge this right away.
