# Issue 20902: Implement negation for modular forms

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-08-01 09:11:19

When negating a cusp form, the parent changes from `CuspForms` to `ModularForms`.

This particularity causes problems with #20767, which slightly changes the implementation of `IntegerMulAction`.
