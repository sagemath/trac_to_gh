Travis, please compare links to `shard_preorder_graph()` in http://sage-doc.sis.uta.fi/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/posets/poset_examples.html#sage.combinat.posets.poset_examples.Posets.ShardPoset and http://sage-doc.sis.uta.fi/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/shard_order.html#sage.combinat.shard_order.shard_poset. Should Sphinx handle this?

This is more of because the documentation is done. A fix that should work is making the link explicit in `combinat/shard_order.py`:

```
:func:`~sage.combinat.shard_order.shard_preorder_graph`
```
