As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/52986/stack-overflow-during-symbolic-manipulations/):


```
sage: a = var('a')
sage: assume(a>0)
sage: assume(a<1)
sage: f = integrate(x*log(1/(a*x+(1-x)^2)), x, 0, 1)

RuntimeError: ECL says: C-STACK overflow at size 1048576. Stack can probably be resized. Proceed with caution.
```



```
sage: f = integrate(x*log(1/(a*x+(1-x)*(1-x))), x, 0, 1, algorithm='sympy')
sage: f.simplify_full()

RuntimeError: ECL says: C-STACK overflow at size 1048576. Stack can probably be resized. Proceed with caution.
```



```
sage: f.limit(a=0)

RuntimeError: ECL says: C-STACK overflow at size 1048576. Stack can probably be resized. Proceed with caution.
```


Those errors are fixed in latest Maxima release, hence the goal of this ticket is mainly to ensure that the example will be included as a doctest to avoid further regression.
