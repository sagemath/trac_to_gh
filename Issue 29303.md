I don't think this change is correct:

```diff
-                if left_m == [] and right_m == []:
-                    z_elt[ left_m ] = left_c*right_c
+                # Hack due to symmetrica crashing when both of the
+                # partitions are the empty partition
+                if not left_m and not right:   # I think this should be right_m  <---
+                    z_elt[left_m] = left_c * right_c
```


Also, a micro-optimization while-we-are-at-it:

```diff
-        out = self.sum_of_terms(((Partition(e), c)
-                                 for e, c in f.dict().items()
-                                 if is_partition(e)),
-                                distinct=True)
+        out = self._from_dict({_Partitions.element_class(_Partitions, e): c
+                               for e, c in f.dict().items()
+                               if is_partition(e)}
+                              remove_zeros=False)
```
