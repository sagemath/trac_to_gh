# Issue 12666: Root poset should treat type A1 properly

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12838

Original creator: stumpc5

Original creation time: 2012-04-13 15:58:26

Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: root poset

The patch fixes the issue that the one element root poset in type A1 was not returned correctly.


```
sage: Phi = RootSystem(['A',1]).root_poset(); Phi
Finite poset containing 1 elements
sage: Phi.cover_relations()
[]
```


I also added the facade option for root posets.

In sage/combinat/root_system/root_system.py,

it should be written 

```
- ``restricted`` -- 
```

(i.e. there are missing backquotes)

Otherwise, it seems ok.

This patch needs a commit message and also needs to be rebased to sage-5.0.beta14 (or later).

Sorry for being slow...

I added a commit message -- the patch applies smoothly on 5.0.rc0.

Not quite smoothly:

```
applying trac_12838-root_poset_A1-cs.patch
patching file sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realizations.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 507 with fuzz 2 (offset -34 lines).
```


Anyway, I rebased it.
