Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: root poset

The patch fixes the issue that the one element root poset in type A1 was not returned correctly.


```
sage: Phi = RootSystem(['A',1]).root_poset(); Phi
Finite poset containing 1 elements
sage: Phi.cover_relations()
[]
```


I also added the facade option for root posets.
