As part of #31420 (Meta-ticket: Review/remove monkey patching in `src/sage/__init__.py`), we move the definition of `load_ipython_extension` (introduced in #18726) to `sage.repl.__init__`

This function was defined in module `sage` so that `%load_ext sage` works (see http://www.slabbe.org/blogue/categorie/ipython/). After the move, this would have to be `%load_ext sage.repl`; but we patch it into the module `sage` upon import of `sage.repl` to keep `%load_ext sage` as well (at least after `import sage.all` or `import sage.repl`).

```

With this ticket:

```
./sage -ipython
...
In [1]: %load_ext sage                                                                                                                                 
The sage module is not an IPython extension.
In [2]: import sage.repl                                                                                                                               
In [3]: %load_ext sage              # succeeds                                                                                                                   
```
and:

```
./sage -ipython
...
In [1]: %load_ext sage.repl         # succeeds                                                                                                                          
```


In a follow up ticket we may also want to define the corresponding function that will make `%unload_ext sage` work
