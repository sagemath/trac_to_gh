makes it *much* easier to move interacts to the library since you don't have to define every single thing you use from the sage library.

I'm a little surprised that there aren't circular import problems here, so this should definitely be tested.  If it works, it's a big win for making interacts easier to port to the library.

Marshall, can you test this and turn it into a real patch?

Changing status from new to needs_work.

I'll try to fold this into #9623 and test the result.  It would be cool if it works.  I tried to add that import to the decorator but couldn't get it to work.

This seems to work remarkably well.  I will refactor #9623 accordingly.  I would like to do these together to avoid merge annoyances.

Yes, I hit a limitation in Python when I tried to import * in the decorator.  A quick search led to several emails by Guido et. al. in 2001 about this being a problem or something.

Anyways, import * at the module namespace works.  It just means that people better not try to tab-complete on interacts.library.<tab>, since it will give the entire Sage namespace, I believe!
