Just some minor changes this time. Three instances of `u ** 2` read better as `u**2`. As part of this change `parabola=u ** 2` should be `parabola = u**2`.

There are three other assignments `sur1=`, `sur2=` and `curve=` that also need space around the equals sign.

Two instances of `sin(3*u),.8*cos(4*u)` should be `sin(3*u), .8*cos(4*u)`. And then it's ready to go.
