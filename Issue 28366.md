# Issue 28366: CombinatorialPolyhedron: edge_graph -> vertex_graph

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28603

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-10-15 07:30:30

CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Keywords: polytopes, combinatorial polyhedron

In order to make `CombinatorialPolyhedron` more consistent with `Polyhedron`, we replace `edge_graph` by `vertex_graph`.

In case of of unbounded polyhedra this might make a difference, as unbounded 1-faces are considered for `edge_graph` but not for `vertex_graph`.

Could the sentence also include what function the use should use instead?

Sure.

The deprecation warning doesn't show in normal use. When you run the doctest manually it won't show. If you pack it in

```
sage: def foo(C):
sage:     return C.edge_graph()
```

it is printed when calling `foo`.

The deprecation warning is now printed out. So I will put it back on "positive review".
