# Issue 17417: Fix more load/save bugs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17654

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-01-20 10:07:58

1. Remove all documentation about `load filename`, it should be `load("filename")`.
2. `load?` claims `Load Sage object from the file with name filename, which will have an ``.sobj`` extension added if it doesn't have one.` but a `.sobj` extension isn't actually added.
3. `src.sage.repl.load` calls `eval`(!) on the filename, deprecate that behaviour.

LGTM, but there appears to be a minor merge conflict with #17533.

I'm seeing the warning when I use 

    sage: %runfile '/var/folders/d3/yxwv5yn5715fk31lq36lnk780000gn/T/sage24271vpp.sage' # loading region...
    /Users/iandrus/vcs/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: using unevaluated expressions as argument to load() is dangerous and deprecated
    See http://trac.sagemath.org/17654 for details.
      #!/usr/bin/env python

Is that expected?  And I should change it to

    load('/var/folders/d3/yxwv5yn5715fk31lq36lnk780000gn/T/sage24271vpp.sage')

Remove the quotes:

```
sage: %runfile /var/folders/d3/yxwv5yn5715fk31lq36lnk780000gn/T/sage24271vpp.sage
```
