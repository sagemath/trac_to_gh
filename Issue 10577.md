# Issue 10577: Add a multi-partition implementation to sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10630

Original creator: pabryan

Original creation time: 2011-01-14 05:33:43

Assignee: pabryan

Keywords: multipartition multi-partition multi-partite multipartite partition

As discussed here[1], multi-partitions would be a useful addition to sage. I have an initial implementation soon to be uploaded.

Implementation of multi-partitions

Attachment

Some comments:

 * The functions for multipartitions do not seem to work correctly. Here is an incorrect (incomplete) result:


```
 
M=MultiPartitions([2,2])
for x in M.list(): print x
[[2, 2]]
[[1, 2], [1, 0]]
[[2, 1], [0, 1]]
[[1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 2]]
[[1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]]
[[2, 0], [0, 1], [0, 1]]
[[1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [0, 1]]

```

  Two multipartitions are missed: `[[1,1],[1,1]]` and `[[2,0],[0,2]]`

 * I wonder whether `MultiPartitions` is a good name, because it seems it has a different meaning in a near context. See for instance this paper by G. Andrews: http://es.scribd.com/doc/6625886/Multi-Partitions, or this other paper; http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~mf/papers/weight2.pdf, or these slides: http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~goddard/MINI/2009/Swisher.pdf ."Vector partitions" may be safer (it is used for instance by George Andrews in his book on partitions).

 * Should one represent the Multipartitions as lists of vectors with integer coordinates rather than lists of lists ? (because sometimes one has to do the sum of the parts).

 * A few typos:
    * Line 6 of the file: "the" should not be repeated.
    * Line 9 of the file: replace "it's" with "its".
    * Line 63 of the file: replace "lexicographically order integer lists" with "lexicographically weakly decreasing lists of integers" or something better.
    * Also, one might replace the definition of multipartition as "equivalence class of tuples" (lines 4 to 10) with "multiset of tuples".

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Vector partitions is now implemented. I am calling it VectorPartitions instead of MutliPartitions, to remove the conflict with the standard usage of the latter.

Apply: trac_10630-vector_partition-ap.patch

Looks good to me.

Apply: trac_10630-vector_partition-ap.patch
