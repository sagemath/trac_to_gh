```
sage: f = 1/(1+x+y)
sage: S = PowerSeriesRing(QQ,'x',2)
sage: T = PowerSeriesRing(S,'y',2)
sage: g = T(f)
sage: g
1 - x + O(x^2) + (-1 + 2*x + O(x^2))*y + O(y^2)
sage: g[1][0]
-1
sage: g[1,0]
0
```


Moreover:

```
sage: S = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: T = PolynomialRing(S,'y')
sage: g = T.gen() + S.gen()
sage: g
y + x
sage: g[1][0]
1
sage: g[1,0]
0
```


You can even do:

```
sage: g[QQ]
0
```

Cool.  It looks like this got fixed between 6.8 and 7.1 by some optimizations to `__getitem__` in power series.
