Hi Nathannnnnn! Thanks for looking in the file. ``list``, ``graph().vertices()`` and ``depth()`` seem to be correct (``list`` is not supposed to be the list of all vertices, as far as I understand), or am I missing something? I don't really like the ``paths()`` answer (isn't there a 0-length path from the root to itself?), but that answer appears precisely that way in the docstring:


```
      sage: list(BinaryTree().paths())

so I suspect the authors (whom I'm adding to cc now) must have had something in mind.

I do not use these classes, and I do not really understand what they had in mind indeed. But what I believe is that changing the graph function to return a graph one 1 vertex instead of 0 does not match what they had in mind when they wrote it either, so I think that it makes more sense to keep the graph as it was before, and fix the plot problem in a different way.

Just my opinion, of course, and I really do not use those classes. So if you think that it is better to change the output of this graph() function I will let somebody who understands all this better than I do review that patch !

There is now a similar problem with the new method `to_undirected_graph` (since #14784):

```
sage: bt=BinaryTree()
sage: bt.to_undirected_graph()
Graph on 1 vertex
```

It should return the empty graph. The problem come from

```
sage: bt.as_ordered_tree()

Hello Darij,

yes, what you do seems correct.

Instead of having two methods `graph` and `reduced_graph`, I would rather have a keyword `with_leaves` added to the method `graph`.

I have discussed this matter with Viviane recently, and she had suggestions on how to do that, and even code, but she is probably very busy at the moment.

Cheers,

Frederic

Hi Frederic,

thanks for the comments.

Having a keyword for `graph` seems more reasonable indeed, but there is a problem with this. If I set the default option to ignore leaves, then it changes the semantics of the method (currently it doesn't ignore leaves). If I set the default option to use leaves, then it is the opposite of the default option in `to_undirected_graph`. So I would be either planting a backwards compatibility landmine or a false analogy landmine. Which is better?

Or, wait. Should I deprecate `graph` and introduce a `to_graph` method instead (for better analogy with `to_undirected_graph`)?
