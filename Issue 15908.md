CC:  skropf

Keywords: finite_state_machine

Returns the main terms of expectation and variance of the sum
of output labels and its covariance with the sum of input
labels.
    
This implements one of the results of the forthcoming paper:
Clemens Heuberger, Sara Kropf and Stephan Wagner,
Combinatorial Characterization of Independent Transducers via
Functional Digraphs.
