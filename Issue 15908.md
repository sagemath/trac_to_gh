Updated reference HKW2014 to point to arxiv:1404.3680.

- merged current versions of all dependencies so that this merges cleanly with 6.2.beta8
- removed reference HKW2014 from `FiniteStateMachine.final_components` in order to avoid
  an error due to a duplicate reference
- replaced one new instance of "raise E, V" by "raise E(V)"

I expect a rather trivial merge conflict with #16207 --- so whichever of the two tickets is reviewed earlier should be merged into the other.

trac's automerge fails. Patch based on 6.2.beta8, all dependencies but #16143 are in 6.2.rc0, merges cleanly with 6.2.rc0.

#16207 now depends on this ticket, so merge conflict is taken care of.
