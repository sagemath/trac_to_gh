# Issue 16384: cached_method: additional docstring

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16621

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2014-07-07 09:37:45

CC:  dkrenn simonking nbruin

Keywords: cached_method

When reading the documentation, I was not fully sure that different the caches of a `cached_method` of different instances are really distinct. Therefore, I propose to include an example illustrating this fact.

Along the way, a missing `::` in another docstring in the same file has been added.

Sorry, I had probably run the doctests on the wrong file. Should now be fixed.
