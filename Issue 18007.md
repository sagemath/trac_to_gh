On the other hand, just testing without building (`./sage -t src/sage/combinat/dyck_word.py`) yields

```
sage -t --warn-long 78.6 src/sage/combinat/dyck_word.py
    [574 tests, 0.95 s]

It looks like a Python integer kills us directly after building sage, but not if we are just testing.

Got it... it is because of unique representation! There is a cache of computed values of `DyckWords(4,2)`. Hence

```
sage: D1 = DyckWords(4r, 2r)  # init with Python int
sage: D2 = DyckWords(4, 2)    # init with Sage integer
sage: D2.cardinality()
9
sage: type(_)
<type 'int'>
```
So if the block at lines 3583-3585

```
sage: all(all(DyckWords(p, q).cardinality()
....:           == len(DyckWords(p, q).list()) for q in range(p + 1))
....:      for p in range(7))
```
is ran before the `TestSuite(DyckWords(4,2)).run()` **and** the weak cache is still present we got the failure!

I somehow disagree with that analysis that it is a **problem** that `cardinality` returns a Python integer. Yes, the category test suite verifies that `cardinality` returns a Sage integer. However (and that's why I Cc Nicolas) I don't think that the test should be so restrictive.

Hence, would it not be a better solution to modify the test so that it accepts both sage and python integers (and infinity)?

I like this to be restrictive. See also #18159. I often write things like

```
    return S1.cardinality().factorial()
```
which would break if it was a Python integer. Your suggestion implies that I need to do

```
    from sage.rings.integer_ring import ZZ
    return ZZ(S1.cardinality()).factorial()
```

Moreover, in that particular case, I dislike the behavior of the example in [comment:4 comment:4]. Depending on the execution you got a Python int or a Sage integer! This is very bad.

> Hence, would it not be a better solution to modify the test so that it accepts both sage and python integers (and infinity)?


This has to be discussed (maybe on #18159). And which infinity?

OK, fair point.

Is there not a corresponding test for infinite enumerated sets?

'Problem' meant that it is/was the reason for the failing doctest. Nevertheless, I'm also in favour of `cardinality` returning Integers. I also agree that we should change `isinstance(card, Integer)`. But I'm not sure about returning `infinity`: within the category `FiniteEnumeratedSets` I don't think that `cardinality` should return `infinity`. Or should it?

In any case, should this be still part of this ticket?

I think it's best to open a separate ticket for the `isinstance`-issue (and that is what I also take from the silence here). I reviewed this and fixed a typo (`TESTS::` --> `TESTS:` on one line). 

This ticket fixes the issue with the (mysteriously) failing doctest in `dyck_word.py`: the changes pass `make ptestlong` on machines affected with the bug as well as on those not affected. Thus: `positive_review`.

Thanks for the fix!

While you are at it, you may consider making the assertion error even more explicit:

```
expected a Sage Integer and got {} of type {}
```
->

```
.cardinality() should return an Integer, and not {} of type {}
```
I let you decide whether you want to stick this in this ticket. If you do, you can reset a positive review on my behalf after the change (and running the tests).
