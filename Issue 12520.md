Could you write a proper commit message?  "Trac 12692" isn't.  You should (briefly) describe what the patch does.  There is no need to write the ticket number.

12692.2.2.patch has a more descriptive commit message.

Wrapped the commit message over 3 lines (commit messages should not be one long line.  If you wrap commit messages, make sure the first line, which appears in `hg log`, makes sense by itself).
