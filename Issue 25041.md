# Issue 25041: method to compute all quotients

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25278

In Zmod(6) division is sometimes not well defined. Though, we might still want to compute one quotient or all quotients as

```
sage: R = Zmod(6)
sage: a = R(4)
sage: b = R(2)
sage: [c for c in R if c*b == a]
[2, 5]
```


This ticket stands for introducing one or two methods to achieve this computation for `Zmod(n)` rings.
