The code does some strange things, like depending on a variable name, raising a string to a power...

It turns out that the `try:` block always raises an exception, so we can just remove it.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24267

Before returning `z`, you no longer adjust the precision.  Shouldn't you still add `O(x^prec)`?

Replying to [comment:7 roed]:
> Before returning `z`, you no longer adjust the precision.

The old code didn't do that either, although it gave that impression. `x` is the string(!) `"a"`, so the code tried to add `O("a" ** prec)` which obviously failed.

I am just replacing that by the `except:` branch.

That being said, if you want to improve the code in a way which doesn't involve arithmetic with strings and which still passes doctests, that is fine for me.
