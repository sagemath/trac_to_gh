It is very nice to have this feature in Sage; it is something that has been missing for a long time. Sorry for taking so long to get to reviewing it. I have some issues with the overall design that I would like to discuss:

- I think we should do the main computations lazily; that is only when the user asks for them such as computing the length of the resolution. This is a general Sage philosophy: a `Parent` should be quick to create (of course, this is not necessarily universal). These lazy computational bits could then be overriden in subclasses for specific implementations. I think this also leads to a better organizational structure for the classes.
- Why are these classes in Cython files? The only thing that uses Cython is the `to_sage_resolution()`, which could go in the Singular interface file.

Some more trivial points:

- Use `_repr_` instead of `__repr__` as the former allows a user to use `rename()` on the object.
- I would have `FreeResolution_generic` inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` because we don't want to have to do the computations twice for the same ideal.
- I think we should have the string repr be based off the input data. The `_latex_`, `_ascii_art_`, `_unicode_art_` can then use the ones from `chain_complex()` with the current one being something like `pp()`. Perhaps `_latex_` is better directly implemented though (with a `latex_name` attribute added too).
- You can make `_initial_differential` a ``@`lazy_attribute`.
- I much prefer single underscore instead of double as the name-mangling makes it difficult when you want to directly access the attributes (e.g., for speed).
- Given the `chain_complex()`, are there any methods there worthwhile to also call from the free resolution? I am not sure there are any (beyond display methods) since resolutions are exact.

No. Just thank you for attention.  

> - I think we should do the main computations lazily; that is only when the user asks for them such as computing the length of the resolution. 


As you see, the gist of the code is to convert the resolution object computed by Singular to a Sage object as fast as possible and the Sage object contains detailed information (degrees(multi degrees) of generators of component modules and the length) about the resolution. By my experiments, the resolution computation is as fast as Macaulay2.

Then what do you mean by doing the computation lazily? For instance, the length is immediately available after the conversion. And I don't see anything to do lazily in this conversion.

#33953 is dependent on this ticket and requires fast resolution computation.

Indeed. I want to keep that in Cython, but moved to the interface file. I feel that is the more appropriate place for it.

This is what I mean: Do not ask Singular to do the computation until it is required by something the user wants to do. Now this can be improved by making the `_repr_()` not needing to compute the resolution.

I felt that too, but also thought that keeping `[Graded]FreeResolution` class and `to_sage_resolution[_graded]` function in the same cython file would make them run fast. If I am wrong, I am okay with moving them to the Singular interface file.

Okay, I am done for now.

I changed the `ideal` argument to `module` argument reflecting its generality.

I reworked the documentation to try and make is more readable as a non-programming-technical document at the module-level. I also did some other doc changes to try and improve the overall accuracy.

I did not change it to a `CategoryObject` as `ChainComplexes` is actually expecting the objects to be `Parent`s. This would be easily enough to do, but I am feeling lazy about it right now. It is something that could be done easily enough on a later ticket.

I made minor fixes in docstrings.

- The base class `FreeResolution_generic` seems generic rather than abstract.
- I prefer a spaced list than a tight list in INPUT section. From the discussion in sage-devel, I learned that I should respect whichever style an author uses. So I reverted my own change of an AUTHOR section.

Otherwise it looks good to me.

For performance, I tested with #33953. I got

I don't know if the difference in timings is statistically significant. Anyway, it seems negligible.

Bikeshedding (nor do I really care that much): I am not sure I agree with calling it `generic` as it really doesn't work unless subclasses implement certain aspects. While instances can be created, I don't think that qualifies it to be generic.
