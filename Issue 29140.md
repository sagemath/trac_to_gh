The current methods of input of complex numbers is rather primitive in its approach according to my usage, one types the entire argument for the real and imaginary parts, especially when matrixes are considered. Instead, if we simply define a function ` complex() ` which takes in input by the split() mechanism of python, with the first input being real and second imaginary, I think it will greatly help.

Also, instead of specifying each and every parameter for argand plane, it can again be replaced by a function which simply takes in the input, and you can choose a scale for the axes, along with the coloraturas, I do understand `line_plot()` exists, but improvisation is always welcome
