With `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, I ran


```
SAGE_DEBUG=yes ./sage -f python3
```


and now when I try to rebuild Cython on top of that with


```
SAGE_DEBUG=yes ./sage -f cython
```


I get


```
[cython-0.26] gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.3)

```


Same if I try reinstalling Cython with `SAGE_DEBUG=no`.  Just to be sure I rebuild python3 without debug, and was able to install Cython again with no problem, so it really seems to be something about the specific combination of `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` and python3.

I think this is some bad combination of hacky code (that I wrote) IIRC in `sage-pip-install`, `pip-lock`, and Python 3 with debug flags and hence more chatty with `ResourceWarning`s.

#23397, which rewrote the pip-lock command, appears to fix this. The new `sage-flock` script doesn't have the resource leak (actually it sort of does but Python doesn't complain about it since that version of the script uses exec, anyways it doesn't matter). So if that gets merged we can close this ticket as fixed.
