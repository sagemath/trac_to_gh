I think you can delete the part in ell_rational_field.py, now.

Also there is some Todo to delete. The documentation says it returns a boolean when in fact it returns the valuation of the order.

I have rewritten this ticket. It was not checked if the reduction at p is good ordinary. Also the condition at the auxiliary prime was exactly the opposite of what it should be. 

Anyway, this is now ready.

To avoid the possibility of conflicts, I have put this on top of #20254 and set that as a dependency.
