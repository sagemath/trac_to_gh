CC:  @jasongrout @dandrake

Keywords: beginner

The Q matrix of a QR decomposition should be unitary, hence invertible.  For zero-column trivial cases, this is broken.


```
sage: A = zero_matrix(CDF, 5, 0)
sage: Q, R = A.QR()
sage: Q
[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
```


Besides a bugfix this patch will upgrade the documentation to make it clear how this routine works over the complex numbers.  In particular, `SciPy` routines are using a Hermitian inner product - documentation upgrade will reflect that.

Just one change to the code, to return an identity matrix in a trivial case.  Everything else is documentation.  Unfortunately, this file is not included in the documentation (yet).

It's not clear why it happens.  Because on the same machine I have one Sage build where it works, one where it doesn't with the exact same source, but different gcc version.

Does this code use any external libraries (ATLAS comes to mind)?

Dear Martin,

Thanks for participating remotely in Sage Days 40.5.  ;-)

"formatting" patch is an add-on, so you can see the changes.  I did the "OUTPUT" section entirely with math quotes, other than the result objects.  The rest is in code quotes.

Updated the output description, which needed work.  Added some left kernel explanation for Dan Drake, who was also looking at this here at SD 40.5.

Thanks again,
Rob
