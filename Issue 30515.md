CC:  @jhpalmieri @mkoeppe @orlitzky

currently the default mp library is mpir: the default `--with-mp` is `system`, and in
`build/pkgs/mpir/spkg-configure.m4` we have

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE([mpir], [
dnl Implement cases for what to do on different options here
    case "$with_mp" in
        system)
            AC_CHECK_HEADER(gmp.h, [], [sage_spkg_install_mpir=yes])
...

dnl Set SAGE_MP_LIBRARY depending on the with_mp option
    case "$with_mp" in
    mpir|system)
        SAGE_MP_LIBRARY=mpir
        ;;
    gmp)
        SAGE_MP_LIBRARY=gmp
```


as `mpir` is getting more and more bitrotten, this should be switched to `gmp` as the default.

Also, 

```
  --with-mp=system        use the system GMP as multiprecision library, if
                          possible (default)
```

is a lie, as can be seen from above, the default is `mpir`, not `gmp`.

this round of GH actions looks better, several "minimal" jobs completed successfully.
These that failed (e.g. ubunuty-trusty) seemed to have failed for an unrelated reason.
Although it's hart to see atm, for the latter one can only see that sagelib build failed somewhere, but the full log is not there - is it supposed to become available at some point after the run completes?

OK, thanks for pointing to the right direction. In this case the error is about a giac header,
as can be seen in `logs/pkgs/sagelib-9.3.beta1.log`

```

Looks as if `-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include` is missing in CFLAGS, or something like this.
Nothing to do with the branch on this ticket, anyway.
