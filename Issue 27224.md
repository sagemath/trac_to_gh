Since #27222 I get the following tiny failure on Cygwin:


```
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/complex_double.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/rings/complex_double.pyx", line 1642, in sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement._pow_

1 item had failures:

```


That is, it's just off in the representation of the last decimal place.  I wish I could explain exactly where the difference comes from, but I think for this test it should suffice to just add a tolerance flag.

`CDF` uses the system math library, which is known to be implementation-dependent (e.g. for the same number `x` the value of `log(x)` may be different on different systems).

Yes, that's what I figured.  I know for a fact the `log()` function in particular in newlib math has caused minor numerical differences before.

It's nice to know for sure that that's probably the case.
