It gives some outdated advice regarding "all.py"

it should point to https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging_sage_library.html#dependencies-and-distribution-packages 

also, if anything from https://wiki.sagemath.org/import is useful, add it.

Then delete https://wiki.sagemath.org/import
