CC:  @bhutz

Keywords: days88, IMA coding sprints

Hashing of nf element go through `self.polynomial()` which is damn slow!

The attached branch provides a quick hash version (that is more robust than the one for polynomial). A x10 speed up is seen on the following example (425 ms vs 40ms)

```
sage: K.<b> = NumberField(x^3 - 2)
sage: l = [i * b + j * b^2 for i in range(100) for j in range(100)]
sage: l.sort()
sage: %time s = set(l[i+1] - l[i] for i in range(len(l)-1))
```

These "magic numbers" are just used to randomize the bits and can be obtained via

```
sage: phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2
sage: hex(int(2^32 / phi))
'0x9e3779b9'
sage: int(phi * 2^62)
7461864723258187525
```
The `7461864723258187525` was not chosen by me but comes from the hash value of rationals...

I can actually be more coherent and use the same value in both places.

`@`bhutz: Ben can you have a look at the doctest change in `invariants_of_degree`? The first change just a reordering. But the second one reproduced below looks like there was something very wrong before

```diff
             sage: S3 = MatrixGroup(SymmetricGroup(3))
             sage: chi = S3.character(S3.character_table()[0])
             sage: S3.invariants_of_degree(5, chi=chi)
-            [x*y + (2*izeta3^3 + 3*izeta3^2 + 8*izeta3 + 3)*x*z + (-2*izeta3^3 -
-            3*izeta3^2 - 8*izeta3 - 4)*y*z,
-             x^2 + (-2*izeta3^3 - 3*izeta3^2 - 8*izeta3 - 4)*y^2 + (2*izeta3^3 +
-            3*izeta3^2 + 8*izeta3 + 3)*z^2]
+            [x0^4*x1 - x0*x1^4 - x0^4*x2 + x1^4*x2 + x0*x2^4 - x1*x2^4,
+             x0^3*x1^2 - x0^2*x1^3 - x0^3*x2^2 + x1^3*x2^2 + x0^2*x2^3 - x1^2*x2^3]
```

Actually, it looks like you messed up the doc test in commit 4f26871 and are now changing it back in commit 8d8a2ea.

So I see nothing wrong here with the invariants code.
