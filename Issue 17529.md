What's `**` in the pattern? Is it something Cython-specific? I couldn't find it documented in [http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html](http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html)


```
sage: from glob import glob; glob('src/sage/categories/**/*.pyx')
['src/sage/categories/examples/semigroups_cython.pyx']
```

`**` is a globstar, which matches directories recursively.

According to [https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/glob.html](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/glob.html), this is only supported in Python 3.5, so how Cython manage to support `**`?

We have our own iglob implementation.

Are you sure the distutils declarations should be added to the `.pxd` file?

If you use multi_modular.pxd, you'll need to link gmp (though I think we're defensively linking that to everything at the moment). I think you also need c99 headers, but I can't remember for sure why that was added in the first place.
