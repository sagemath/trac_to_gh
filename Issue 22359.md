I agree except for the changes involving sets. So positive_review (assuming that the patchbot passes) if you drop this

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/quadratic_forms/quadratic_form__local_density_congruence.py b/src/sage/quadratic_forms/quadratic_form__local_density_congruence.py
index f111136..64921e6 100644
--- a/src/sage/quadratic_forms/quadratic_form__local_density_congruence.py
+++ b/src/sage/quadratic_forms/quadratic_form__local_density_congruence.py
`@``@` -114,17 +114,14 `@``@` def local_good_density_congruence_odd(self, p, m, Zvec, NZvec):
 
     ## Sanity Check on Zvec and NZvec:
     ## -------------------------------
-    Sn = Set(range(n))
+    Sn = Set(list(range(n)))
     if (Zvec is not None) and (len(Set(Zvec) + Sn) > n):
         raise RuntimeError("Zvec must be a subset of {0, ..., n-1}.")
     if (NZvec is not None) and (len(Set(NZvec) + Sn) > n):
```

and the changes to `src/sage/sets/set.py`.

I opened #22597 to deal with `Set()`.
