# Issue 28368: CombinatorialPolyhedron: replace attributes by methods

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28605

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-10-15 08:26:29

CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Replace attributes in `CombinatorialPolyhedron` by methods, such that they can potentially be lazily evaluated.

This is motivated by #10777.

We also delete `.cc` in the module name of `bit_vector_operations`. The `.cc` lead to an empty folder in the source directory. Without this, the folder does not reappear.

Adding #28625 as I'm using attributes in that ticket.

At moment I think #28625 might be finished before this here, but we can always revers dependencies and change it there.

I went through the changes and they seem all legit.
So I will put this on "positive review".

Failing doctest. Removing `.cc` to get rid of the empty folder doesn't seem to work.

Should probably just do this in an extra ticket and see what happens then.

I think we should to the change to `src/module_list.py` in another ticket. There is no need to do it now, especially if it leads to problems.
