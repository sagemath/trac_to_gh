CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Replace attributes in `CombinatorialPolyhedron` by methods, such that they can potentially be lazily evaluated.

This is motivated by #10777.

We also delete `.cc` in the module name of `bit_vector_operations`. The `.cc` lead to an empty folder in the source directory. Without this, the folder does not reappear.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28605
