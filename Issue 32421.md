When using the empty face for PolyhedronFace.affine_tangent_cone, it should be undefined, but instead, it returns the original polyhedron.

Example:


```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(2)
sage: P.Hrepresentation()
(An inequality (-1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, -1) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, 1) x + 1 >= 0)
sage: P.face_lattice()[0]
A -1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^2
sage: P.face_lattice()[0].affine_tangent_cone().Hrepresentation()
(An inequality (-1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, -1) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, 1) x + 1 >= 0)
```

I do not agree that it should be undefined. It should just be empty. This is also what the documentation claims and I think the definition makes sense:

```
    It is equal to the sum of ``self`` and the cone of feasible directions
    at any point of the relative interior of ``self``.
```

But can an "affine cone" be empty? An ordinary cone cannot - it always contains 0

I would say that this sentence does not define anything for the empty case, because "the" cone at "any" point of the empty set is undefined.

Agreed.
