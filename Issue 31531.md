# Issue 31531: Implement subclasses of ANUnaryExpr for finer control

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31768

I propose to subclass the `ANUnaryExpr` class corresponding to each individual operation in order to both avoid large case checking of the operations and to implement trivial simplification rules for chains on unary operations. The idea is that this will save time when calling `exactify()` and `_interval_fast()`.

This will have a small trivial conflict with #31767, but otherwise it is independent.
