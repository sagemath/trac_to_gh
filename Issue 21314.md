Hello Travis.

Indeed, one should choose a better name. This is just a notation with Cov and downarrow, in the "What the Fuss" reference. One could call that "subgroup_generated_by_conjugates_of_right_descents" or something in the same spirit..

In "Why the Fuss," it is called "covered reflections," so how about `covered_reflections_subgroup`?
Also, it is a natural construction, so it should not be hidden. Yet, I think it should return the submonoid and then the `shard_poset` should convert it to a `frozenset`.

Also the arXiv number is missing a 0: `1503.00710`.
