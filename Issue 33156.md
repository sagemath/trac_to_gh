# Issue 33156: Implement Krawtchouk, Meixner, and Hahn polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33393

Keywords: orthogonal polynomials

These are three classes of orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme. We should provide an implementation based on their definition as hypergeometric functions.

An implementation of the Krawtchouk polynomials appear in `coding/delsarte_bounds.py`. I am cc-ing those people as they might be interested (at least for consistency such as normalization differences and/or possible cross-references). This code is likely slower as it is more general but I haven't checked.

the "eval_recursive" should be cached (in parent ?), don't you think ?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2022-02-22 00:31:19

There isn't really a parent per se. Since the input could be widely varied, it doesn't make so much sense to cache it (and could quick eat up memory). There might be some benefit to caching the resulting (generic) polynomial, but this would likely need a bit of refactoring.

This fixes the pyflakes issues reported by the otherwise green patchbot.

Patchbot is (morally) green.

ok

maybe one could add cross-references from and to the Krawtchouk polynomials in coding ?

I think that is a good idea to have crossrefs. I have added them along with an explicit test checking the relationship between the conventions.

ok, thenl let's go

It looks like the pdf doc doesn’t like Cyrillic so much; I thought it would be fine with the Russian tutorial. Do you know how to get that to work? If not, then we can just remove it.

Comment by chapoton created at 2022-03-21 08:34:56

just remove cyrillic

did you check that pdf doc compiles ?


---

Yes, the pdf doc compiles for me.
