Together with Anders Buch, I went through this patch at Sage Days 30 and checked all functionalities. We added further doctests and also access to fusion coefficients (which was not in the previous version of this patch).

From the mathematical point of view, I give this a positive review. Could someone please do a quick technical review of the patch?

Thanks!

Hi,

I used the occasion to do something I had promissed Anders a while ago: namely to add a standard GNU build system (autoconf/automake) to the original lrcalc sources. With this, the SPKG becomes trivial. I'll upload shortly a preversion of it. If Anders agrees with the changes, and once he will have done an official release, I'll upload a final version of the spkg.

Mike: could you review now the three little files: SPKG.txt, spkg-install and spkg-check? Those are unlikely to change.

After discussion with Anders, I have rolled a new (beta) release of
lrcalc, based on:

- lrcalc-1.1.5.tar.gz
- schmult-1.1.5.tar.gz
- an autotools build system

which Anders will later polish into an official 1.1.6 release. The
spkg is basically identical to the previous 1.1.5b, except for some
updated files in the lrcalc sources (README/AUTHOR/TODO), and the
header installation configuration. Anders gave his +1 on the changes.
I have installed the spkg together with the patch on sage 4.7.2 and
sage-5.0.prealpha0, and in both cases, all test pass.

The patch is unchanged and has a positive review.

Anne (and others!): could you try out the new spkg? If it works fine
for you, I guess we can set a positive review. Feel free to untar the
spkg, and check the files src/README, src/AUTHORS, src/TODO, src/NEWS.

Yikes. Is there an idiom to conditionally include a piece of documentation in the reference manual depending on the presence or not of a spkg? (analogue of the is_package_installed in module.list.py).

If not, may we just kill the beast, and make lrcalc right away a standard spkg (#11563)?

If you don't include the documentation in the reference manual (by that, I mean no modification to the file `doc/en/reference/libs.rst` ), does the warning still shows up when building the documentation?

What is the status of the documentation for other optional packages?
