I plan to add code for Minkowski Decomposition of Polytopes
based on the algorithm in "On the space of Minkowski summands of a convex polytope" [http://www.eurocg2016.usi.ch/sites/default/files/paper_76.pdf](http://www.eurocg2016.usi.ch/sites/default/files/paper_76.pdf) (which appeared in the conference EuroCG 2016, Lugano, Switzerland, March 30-April 1, 2016)
