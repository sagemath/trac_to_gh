Keywords: polytope, Minkowski sum, Minkowski decomposition, days82

I plan to add code for Minkowski Decomposition of Polytopes
based on the algorithm in "On the space of Minkowski summands of a convex polytope" [http://www.eurocg2016.usi.ch/sites/default/files/paper_76.pdf](http://www.eurocg2016.usi.ch/sites/default/files/paper_76.pdf) (which appeared in the conference EuroCG 2016, Lugano, Switzerland, March 30-April 1, 2016)

Note that [polymake](https://polymake.org/) already has a C++ implementation following Fukada's "From the zonotope construction to the Minkowski addition of convex polytopes" (2004).

accessing polymake is now easy with #22683: backend_polymake for Polyhedron

`@`etzanaki - has anything been implemented?
