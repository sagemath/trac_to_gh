This is a rather trivial ticket, doing only cosmetic changes to this file.

* better handling of references

* putting code in pep8 standard

Nothing really serious, should be easy to check.

Indeed a simple one to review.

After merging with 7.3.beta6, all pass and all changes are good. Thanks.

(By the way, Frédéric, feel free to CC me for such tickets, especially when I am to blame anyway.)
