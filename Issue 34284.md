Keywords: bernoulli numbers

Peter Luschny's Bernoulli Manifesto (http://luschny.de/math/zeta/The-Bernoulli-Manifesto.html) makes a very convincing argument that `bernoulli(1)` should be `+1/2`, not `-1/2`. Knuth's books now use `+1/2`, SymPy now uses `+1/2` (and I made the PRs implementing that, see https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/23926), and so this ticket sets `bernoulli(1) = +1/2` here too.

Well not quite; this ticket merely *deprecates* `bernoulli(1) = -1/2` by providing a flag enforcing `+1/2` behaviour by default. The intention is to make the default behaviour permanent later on, so as to give time for end-users to update their code.

This is a continuation of the sage-devel thread at https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/G4sbKoibXK4.

What I think would be a good way to go in this ticket would be to follow the [one year deprecation policy](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html#deprecation) of Sage. Therefore, the default value of the parameter `plus` would be `False` so that `Bernoulli(1)` still returns `-1/2`, but this option would return a warning message saying that this default value will change to `True` in a subsequent release of [SageMath](SageMath). This will give time to the user to adapt their code accordingly.

Also, if `plus=False` I would make the code return `Bernoulli(1)=-1/2` (instead of letting the algorithm decides). In my opinion, this would give the user the choice of its prefered value and avoid some possible confusions.

How can you say `B_1 = -1/2` is standard when Knuth uses `B_1 = +1/2`?

How can you say `B_1 = -1/2` is even a "convention" when Luschny has analysed the historical development of the Bernoulli numbers and found that Bernoulli himself and virtually all mathematicians before the 20th century used `B_1 = +1/2`?

Have you read the manifesto? Luschny's argument has two main thrusts: the historical side as above, and the simplification of many formulae with `B_1 = +1/2`, including Euler–Maclaurin. He eventually finds that the Hasse–Worpitzky representation of the generalised Bernoulli function frees the numbers from all conventions – `B_1 = +1/2` is not another convention, it is the only logical value.

I don't think so. Most people said if to be done, would need to be done with 1 year deprecation warning.
Apart from the OP, I don't think anyone is excited about this change. Including me.

Why do you think the PR will be merged?

Someone indeed pointed this out on sage-devel. This is a mistake from my part as I thougth that is was already closed. Sorry! It can indeed never be merged...

I personally am.  And, I think all code in Sage that is broken by this is code that I wrote, so I'm not just a completely random opinion.   I also like that it fixes that annoying special cases regarding generalized Bernoulli numbers.  I also find Knuth's opinion compelling.

It might or might not be merged.  We have a voting policy for contentious changes to Sage, which we carefully thought through and designed many years ago.  The weird thing is that I would link to the policy, but I just did some google searches and can't even find it!

Hello Jeremy, thank you for working on this ticket and fixing the failing doctests.

A small suggestion:

```diff
+    - ``plus`` (Boolean) - ``bernoulli(1)`` gives `1/2` if this is ``True`` and `-1/2` otherwise
-    - ``plus`` - bernoulli(1) gives +1/2 if this is True and -1/2 otherwise
```

Also, I think that a more descriptive depreciation message could be useful for the user:

```diff
         else:
+            deprecation(34521, ("bernoulli(1) will return +1/2 by default in" +
+            "the future. In order to keep the original behavior, please set" +
+            "the option ``plus`` to ``False`` (bernoulli(n, plus=False))"))
-            deprecation(34521, "bernoulli(1) will always return +1/2 in the future")
```

(or something else)

I still support this change and I don't understand the convention argument against it.
