Finite fields in the givaro implementation have
a `fetch_int` method, which is not present in the
`pari` implementation.

Define a prime and a finite field:

```
sage: p = 4091
sage: F = GF(p^2, 'a')
```


Before this ticket:

```
sage: F.fetch_int(3*p + 2)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'FiniteField_pari_ffelt_with_category' object has no attribute 'fetch_int'
```


After this ticket:

```
sage: F.fetch_int(3*4091 + 2)
3*a + 2
```

The PR adds the requested method (and doctests) to the base class. I don't think we should assume that we know how the element constructor acts on lists, so I did not use the elegant solution that is in the [ask Sage question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/55451/arithmetic-operation-is-not-working-in-finite-field-gf40912/), although I did use the same idea.

I think this is good overall. Here are some changes that should increase the speed:

```diff
         n = Integer(n)
         if (n < 0) or (n >= self.order()):
             raise TypeError("n must be between 0 and self.order()")
         if n == 0:
-            return self(0)
+            return self.zero()
-        digs = n.digits(base=self.characteristic())
-        return sum(self(digs[i]) * self.gen()**i for i in range(len(digs)))
+        cdef list digs = n.digits(base=self.characteristic())
+        g = self.gen()
+        return self.sum(self(val) * g**i for val in digs if val)
```

Other than that LGTM.
