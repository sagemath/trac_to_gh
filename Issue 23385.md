# Issue 23385: LatticePoset doc, use the master bib file

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23622

This patch will a) move references to the master bibliography file and b) unify order of examples- and seealso-blocks in `lattices.py`. #23597 did the same for `posets.py`.

I know it is slightly beyond the scope of this ticket, but I would like to see the references fit a bit more into the "standard" (I know it's mostly ill-defined currently) scheme:

```
.. [Dil1940] \R. P. Dilworth,
             *Lattice with Unique Irreducible Decompositions*,
             Annals of Mathematics **41** (1940), pp. 771-777,
             With comments by B. Monjardet
             http://cams.ehess.fr/docannexe.php?id=1145

.. [GW2014] \G. Gratzer and F. Wehrung,
            *Lattice Theory: Special Topics and Applications Vol. 1*,
            Springer, 2014.

.. [Platt1976] \C. R. Platt,
               *Planar lattices and planar graphs*,
               Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B,
               Vol 21, no. 1 (1976): 30-39.
```


(Side note: at some point, [the Sage community] should define precisely a format for references and bring everything into the format. However, that is a much bigger issue to debate and specify, which definitely is not for this ticket.)
