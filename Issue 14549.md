There are some problems with generic binaries (`SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes`) in the new ATLAS spkg. In order not to delay the release of Sage 5.10 any longer, I will revert #10508.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14753

The fact that 3DNow is used was discussed at #13706.

Of course we can remove that.

Jeroen: could you try to modify spkg-install: replace

```
isa_ext = ('3DNow',)
```

by

```
isa_ext = ()
```

on line 404 (in some version of the p0 spkg I have access to right now.)
It's in the configure_base function, the part about "Generic configuration on Intel i386 compatible CPUs"; and then try to rebuild on cicero? (I have no access to it)

I posted a spkg at #14754 doing that, I'll try it on cicero (a single-core Pentium 4 machine).

In any case, this will not change my decision to revert #10508. I want to release Sage 5.10 as soon as possible.
