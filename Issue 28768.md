CC:  isuruf malb fbissey jhpalmieri dimpase slelievre

This causes a build error in some configurations, in particular when building on conda.

We propose to apply a workaround similar to the one used in conda-forge (https://github.com/conda-forge/m4rie-feedstock/commit/dea9e9a33ccf951c2458ad53f9af3ed860f81fbf) until hopefully this is fixed upstream and a new release is available.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29005
