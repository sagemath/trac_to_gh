Integer rings modulo primes are not identified consistently as integral domains


```
R=Zmod(5)
R in IntegralDomains()
False
R.is_integral_domain()
True
```

I also made a similar fix for `is_unique_factorization_domain` a la #17501.

This does appear to fix the category issues for integer_mod_rings. But there is one minor issue and something I'm not sure about which is probably just my lack of knowledge.

The minor issue is a doc test failure in sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_rings.py. It is just a typo where the expected value should be `True` but `False` was put in the doctest for `Zmod(5)`.


```
File "src/sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py", line 666, in sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.IntegerModRing_generic.is_integral_domain
Failed example:
    R in IntegralDomains()
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
```


The part that is not clear to me is why in `_contains_helper(cls)` you are able to use `cls` as a callable object as `Category_contains_method_by_parent_class(cls())`. Isn't `cls` something like `Zmod(7)`?

Fixed.

No it's not. It is the class `Rings` (not an instance); so in effect, `cls()` is doing `Rings()` and creating an instance of that class. Does that clarify things?
