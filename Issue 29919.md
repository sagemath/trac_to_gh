I've also emailed Vince Knight, who might know more about Gambit status.

no reply - so let's just remove it.

however there is a lot of stuff in src/sage/games/ that needs it.

Let's give people a bit of time to react. This is not urgent. When we have collected a bit more information on Meta-ticket #29900 (Fix optional and experimental packages for Sage 9.2), we can perhaps also send a message to sage-users

This is our one current use of game theory in Sage. I think a better solution is to extract PR242 as a patch to Sage. (I forget why this was downgraded to experimental in the first place.) We might also consider forking this to include some of the updates, something I would consider doing, but I probably wouldn't be able to do anything with it long-term.

I agree we should wait on this - perhaps contacting the maintainer of Gambit itself.

The primary author got back to me saying that's fine, he'll want to do a better Python API anyway (he considers the current one to be unstable), but not before finishing his term as a dean... That is yes, we ought to remove it.

remvove "it" = the python interface, or the whole package?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-08-10 23:21:56

the whole package, I suppose

What about the current doctests etc that rely on it?  It would be unfortunate to remove them completely - but perhaps need to have some warnings on those files that the Gambit tests are currently broken and to use a previous version of Sage if you need that functionality for now.

If no one can install the package, they won't easily be able to run the doctests, so they can stay. If you want to add some warnings where it says "Run `sage -i gambit` ...", that would probably be a good idea.

Are there parts of the Sage game theory code depend on the Gambit executables, or does everything depend on the broken Gambit Python library?

Gambit 16 does not support Python 3. The current master branch does.

Interesting.  Maybe it would be worth simply packaging as such?  Unfortunately it wouldn't appear to currently be pip-installable.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
