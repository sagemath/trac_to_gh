This is our one current use of game theory in Sage. I think a better solution is to extract PR242 as a patch to Sage. (I forget why this was downgraded to experimental in the first place.) We might also consider forking this to include some of the updates, something I would consider doing, but I probably wouldn't be able to do anything with it long-term.

What about the current doctests etc that rely on it?  It would be unfortunate to remove them completely - but perhaps need to have some warnings on those files that the Gambit tests are currently broken and to use a previous version of Sage if you need that functionality for now.

If no one can install the package, they won't easily be able to run the doctests, so they can stay. If you want to add some warnings where it says "Run `sage -i gambit` ...", that would probably be a good idea.

Interesting.  Maybe it would be worth simply packaging as such?  Unfortunately it wouldn't appear to currently be pip-installable.
