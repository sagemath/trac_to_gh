CC:  @tscrim @fchapoton

Trivial bikeshedding with

`find src/sage -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' -or -name '*.pxi' | xargs perl -e 's|^( +- ``([a-z]+)`` -) |\1- |g' -p -i.bak`

and then one manual correction.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23661

In several cases, you are not applying this change to the whole `INPUT` block but only for one of several inputs.

Besides that, I'm in general hesitant with "mass change" tickets although this one doesn't actually affect a lot of files.

I know. That's why I said that there is much to do manually.

This would be a tiny step to more unified documentation. But whatever, we can also close this as wontfix.
