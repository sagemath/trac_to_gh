In several cases, you are not applying this change to the whole `INPUT` block but only for one of several inputs.

Besides that, I'm in general hesitant with "mass change" tickets although this one doesn't actually affect a lot of files.

I know. That's why I said that there is much to do manually.

This would be a tiny step to more unified documentation. But whatever, we can also close this as wontfix.
