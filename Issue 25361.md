For the function `build_acceptable_adjacency_structure()`, but we require the orientation of the edges of the palm tree. Hence, in the `graph_copy` we are storing, we iterate through every edge, and if the orientation in graph is different from the palm tree, we reverse it. But I discovered the following -


```
g = Graph()
g.add_edges([(2,1)])
g.edges()
[(1, 2, None)]
```



```
g = Graph()
g.add_edges([(1,2)])
g.edges()
[(1, 2, None)]
```


Irrespective of the order of source and target given in the parameter of `add_edges()`, the edge is stored as `(1, 2, None)`. In such a situation, the other option of reversing an edge is possible if the graph is directed. But I do not want to convert the graph to a digraph, one of the reasons being that while converting, two edges in either direction are added to digraph corresponding to every edge in the original graph.

Hence, as of now, I have stored an additional dictionary named `edge_reversed`, and I'm storing all the edges as keys of the dictionary and the value as True or False to denote if the edge is in the reverse direction or not. Every place where the orientation of the edge matters, I have an if and else blocks. 

I don't think this is the best method. I am still looking for other methods. Please advice if [SageMath](SageMath) has some feature which can be used here.


Also, the function `dfs1()` has been thoroughly tested. I am still testing the function `build_acceptable_adjacency_structure()`, it is hard to test without the `dfs2()` function I think.

Just a few comments on coding style

- `if (self.dfs_number[w] < self.lowpt1[v]):`. You don't need to add the brackets.

- `if check == True: ` -> `if check:`

- `if len(comp):` -> `if comp:`. Indeed, if `comp == []`, the test is false, and if `comp` is not empty, the test will be true.

- `if self.edge_status[e] != 0 :` -> `if self.edge_status[e]:`. It's `False` only if the status is 0.

- `first_son == None` -> `first_son is None` is better I think.

- use `range` and not `xrange`. In Python 3, `range` becomes an iterator.

- `edge_reverse`. Instead of a dictionary, you could use a set and consider that an edge is reversed if it belongs to that set. It's not very important.

`@`saiharsh,
I was debugging and fixed some bugs with pathsearch() but I found an error with the function split_multi_edges() and with the `edge_status` dictionary.
* In `split_multi_edges()`, 
    `sorted_edges = sorted(self.graph_copy.multiple_edges(labels=False))` removes the edge labels, however in `edge_status` dictionary, we store the edges along with the labels. Hence, if an edge `(3,4,None)` is removed and updated in `split_multi_edges()`, a new item `(3,4)` is added to `edge_status` with label `3` (i.e., denoting removed), whereas the item `(3,4,None)` remains with old label. In the rest of the algorithm, `(3,4,None)` is used, which leads to an error. For now I have changed that line to 
    `sorted_edges = sorted(self.graph_copy.multiple_edges(labels=True))`, need to check.

* A more fundamental error is with the dictionary `edge_status` itself. If we have multiedges `(1,2)` and `(1,2)` in the input graph, in `split_multi_edges()` we intend to change the status of one of the edges to removed and the other remains as a palm tree arc.

I had assumed a dictionary would be a good way to store status of the edges but did not think about this error. Please suggest a way in which we can resolve this error. I will also update if I find some fix.

Run the code for a cycle on `4` vertices with one extra edge (the multi-edge).

>sorted_edges = sorted(self.graph_copy.multiple_edges(labels=True)), need to check.
I feel it won't work if all the edges have same labels.

The error in `split_multi_edges()` because we are unable to differentiate between multiple edges, so I thought to label each edge according to entry in `G.edges`.


```
        from sage.graphs.graph import Graph
        self.graph_copy = Graph(multiedges=True)
        edges = G.edges()
        # dict to map new edges with the old edges
        self.edge_label_dict = {}
        for i in range(len(edges)):
            newEdge = tuple([edges[i][0], edges[i][1], i])
            self.graph_copy.add_edge(newEdge)
            self.edge_label_dict[newEdge] = edges[i]
        self.graph_copy = self.graph_copy.copy(implementation='c_graph')
```

Now `edge_status` will have entry of all multiple edges. \\
The only one problem is while returning the final answer we need to map the graph edge labels to it's previous labels using `edge_label_dict`. which will increase the time with `O(m)`.  \\
`edge_label_dict` will take new edge and return it's previous form. \\

I have manually checked `split_multiple_edges` is working as expected. \\
Please suggest me if there is a better way to solve this problem.

There is a bug in your approach. You are modifying the graph while building `graph_copy`.
Since you are going through the edges and only adding the modified edges, all isolated vertices will be deleted, which is not desired. 

`split_multi_edges` is still giving the wrong output. I tried the following example:

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
sage: G.add_edges([(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(1,5),(1,5)])
sage: tric = Triconnectivity(G)
```


The connected component corresponding to the multi edges is being done correctly. But both the edges corresponding to `(1,5)` edge - `(0,4,1)` and `(0,4,2)` are given a value of `3` after `split_multi_edges`. Only one edge must be deleted.

The triconnectivity is completed. The triconnected components are now correctly constructed.
The triconnected components are being printed when we call the `Triconnectivity` function. An example-

```
sage: from sage.graphs.connectivity import Triconnectivity
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_edges([(1,2),(1,4),(1,8),(1,12),(1,13),(2,3),(2,13),(3,4)])
sage: G.add_edges([(3,13),(4,5),(4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(6,7),(8,9),(8,11)])
sage: G.add_edges([(8,12),(9,10),(9,11),(9,12),(10,11),(10,12)])
sage: tric = Triconnectivity(G)
```


In the output, the current format of vertices is numbers starting from `0` to `n`. Hence the edges printed will use these numberings. I am currently formatting the output to change the vertex labels to original labels. Will finish that in some time.

I am also adding comments to the code to make it more readable.
Please let me know if you find any discrepancies in the output.

One operation that is required in the `path_search` function is to replace an edge with a different edge in the adjacency list of a vertex.
In the OGDF code, pointers and linked lists are used. So when we need to replace an edge, *e1 = *e2 will replace the edge without requiring any changes to the `LinkedList` object.

In python, I used references to try to replicate the same. Hence, I have a `LinkedList` object and each node is a `LinkedListNode`.
Here, when I replace a node, I have to update the `next` and `prev` pointers accordingly. But if the node to be replaced is the `head` of a `LinkedList` object, updating the `next` and `prev` pointers is not sufficient. The `head` variable of the corresponding linked list contains a reference to the old node, which has to be modified. And the only way to access the `head` variable of the corresponding `LinkedList` is if we have a reference to the `LinkedList` object from the node.

And yes, we are not using the `replace` of `LinkedList`. We can remove it. Unless we find some way to avoid storing the pointer to linked list.

tric.comp_list_new: will have all the edges which are in `G` not in graph_copy. \\
graph_copy: will have nodes from 0...n-1 similarly edges. \\
vertex_to_int: to convert vertices from `G` to graph_copy. \\

Algo: Connect all the components using virtual edges, one virtual edge will connect two components.

1. Iterate over all the edges of the components and for each component creates a tree vertex.
2. If any virtual edge and partnerNode is None (i.e first component is not found) store tree vertex in partnerNode.
3. if any virtual edge and partnerNode is exist (i.e first component is found and current tree vertex is the second component), so add an edge between them.

For this I need a dictionary(partnerNode) which has all the edges of components, \\ initially, I used graph_copy edges as graph_copy has less number of edges then all the edges combined in components(many duplicated edges).
but there is a small issue sometime (1, 2, "newVEdge") is there sometime (2, 1, "newVEdge") which lead to use try and except, in current commit I removed it by initializing with edges in components.

Coming to `tric.vertex_to_int[originalEdge[0]]` as partnerNode has edges from graph_copy(initially) and comp_list_new has edges from `G`, so I needed to convert originalEdge to graph_copy edge using vertex_to_int but in current commit I excluded it.

Is it good to keep the current approach for creating tree with 0..n-1 vertex then relabeling it or create the tree with original labels itself?

In OGDF, all the memory allocated through malloc is being freed up at the end of the `init` function. I am not sure which method you tried, but maybe I can also work on it if you think only freeing the memory is the issue.

Yes, adding a parameter `algorithm` is a good idea, many functions in [SageMath](SageMath) have a recommended algorithm. My doubt is how do we return the triconnected components or the SPQR tree. Currently, a call to `Triconnectivity` initializes the class and computes the triconnected components. We could also push `staticSPQRTree` inside `Triconnectivity`. Should we add two more functions like `get_triconnected_components` and `get_spqr_tree`? Then a call to the algorithm would be as

```
G = Graph()
G.add_edges()
tric = Triconnectivity(G)
components = tric.get_triconnected_components()
tree = tric.get_spqr_tree()
```


Also, in this case, we should probably name the `Triconnectivity` class appropriately to reflect SPQR tree functionality.
> I'd like to cythonize parts of the code in order to make it faster and reduce memory consumption. No emergency for that. I'll see if I can do something tomorrow.

Okay, we can try to cythonize some parts and do the remaining after GSOC period ends. Before the GSOC deadline, we could try to ensure the python code is as good as possible.

Please see last two printed lines where one polygon and Triconnected component share same virtual edge. \\
Output of OGDF and `tric.print_triconnected_components()` are same.
In #22157 spqr_tree code is generating a bond with (3, 1) so G.is_isomorphic(H) is True.
Similar case in [Gut2001]_.

In fact, we are missing the `Bond: [(3, 1, 'newVEdge11'), (3, 1, 'newVEdge11')]`. 

Can you check when this virtual edge is added and see why the bond is not added ?

No, it's good to have class examples. It ease the understanding of what a class can do / is used for, without having to check all methods.

I feel a bond is created if there exists a real edge followed by virtual edges, i.e 
we are expecting a bond like `Bond: [(3, 1, 'None'), (3, 1, 'newVEdge11')]` but it's not possible as (1, 3) edge is not available in `G`.\\
OGDF returns 5 bonds and each 5 bonds has one real edge.

I will try to find a fix for the `spqr_tree` with `cleave` algorithm. A simple one is to remove P-blocks with only 2 edges before the construction of the spqr tree.

Question: is it really useful to let the `'newVEdge11'` labels ?

At last I got a successful build of sage.
As mentioned by meghana I also got the same results.
For graph 

```
G = Graph(']\\eHS_Q_cCI?GG?aOGCA?Q??AO?O?c??Oa??_A??AC?G??@a???CC???O?G??OA??P?????H??')
```

It looks like error is coming when block is an bi-connected component with no multiedges but that error block and R_blocks has three edges common
there are 

```
(6, 10, None)
(6, 19, None)
(10, 19, None)
```

If we remove these edges from the error block we will get a cycle. 
Is it like we are not deleting less edges? correct me if I am wrong.

I have added the case of Q blocks in all methods.

In TriconnectivitySPQR, do we really need methods `get_triconnected_components` and `print_triconnected_components` ? We can of course let them as they are useful for testing methods in the class, but the most important is to return the SPQR tree.

I propose to modify methods so that the `__init__` performs all computations including the construction of the spqr tree, and then the `get_triconnected_components` and `print_triconnected_components` methods just have to consider the nodes of the tree. Do you agree ?

I moved the spqr construction to the init. However, the doctests are failing due to the following reason.

The functions `get_triconnected_components` and `print_triconnected_components` use the nodes of the SPQR tree to output the components. Suppose we have two `bond` components, each with the same number of edges. Let the two bond edges be `(1,2)` and (`3,4)`. The corresponding nodes in the SPQR tree will be -

```
[('P', Multi-graph on 2 vertices),
 ('P', Multi-graph on 2 vertices)]
```

The ordering of these two vertices in the SPQR tree is random since both would be considered as similar vertices. When we access the vertices of the SPQR tree using `for node in self.spqr_tree.vertices()`, we could either get the bond `(1,2)` first or `(3,4)` first.

In bucket sort, edges `(u, v)` are sorted in such a way that first preference is given to `v` if the same `v` then compare `u`. i.e (1, 2) will come before (0, 3). \\
Initially, we used the sorted function which is the reverse of bucket sort i.e (0, 3) will come before (1, 2). \\
As there is a change in edge processing in `split_multiple_edges`, creation of components and edges which leads to jumble in triconnectivity output. \\
Let me know if there is any other problem.

The ordering is not an issue as long as the result of the triconnectivity decomposition and construction of spqr tree remains correct.

Have you check if this algorithm is effectively faster that the `sorted` method ?

Yes, construction of spqr-tree remains correct.

I expect that current method is slightly better than the `sorted` method, as ``sorted`` method uses Timsort and it's running time is `O(mlogm)` m is no. of edges, whereas bucket sort uses extra space but running time is linear. \\
Practically I didn't compare both methods.

I have exposed the `spqr_tree` method in `Graph` and done some more tests.
I was about to give positive review... but I found 2 issues, one in `spqr_tree` with the `cleave` method and one in `TriconnectivitySPQR`.

1. For some reason, some 3-cycles are not merged with algorithm `cleave`. I will check that.

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: for u,v in G.edges(labels=False):
....:     G.add_path([u,G.add_vertex(),G.add_vertex(),v])
....:     
sage: T = G.spqr_tree()
sage: T2 = G.spqr_tree(algorithm="cleave")
sage: T
SPQR-tree of Petersen graph: Graph on 31 vertices
sage: T2
SPQR tree of Petersen graph: Graph on 43 vertices
```

2. Some vertices (1 in the example below) are marked as `R`-block instead of `S`-block. Please check.

```
sage: for u,v in G.edges(labels=False):
....:     G.add_path([u,G.add_vertex(),G.add_vertex(),v])

My last commit is not enough. If instead of 4-cycles, we add 5-cycles, from time to time some 5-cycles are identified as `R`-blocks :(

Consider the following example without 'R'-block

```
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
sage: for u,v in G.edges(labels=False):
....:     G.add_path([u,G.add_vertex(),G.add_vertex(),G.add_vertex(),v])
sage: for u,v in G.edges(labels=False):
....:     G.add_path([u,G.add_vertex(),G.add_vertex(),G.add_vertex(),v])
sage: T = G.spqr_tree()
sage: V = G.vertices()
sage: while not Counter(u[0] for u in T)['R']:
....:     shuffle(V)
....:     G.relabel(perm=V, inplace=True)
....:     T = G.spqr_tree()
sage: Counter(u[0] for u in T)
Counter({'S': 24, 'P': 20, 'R': 1})
```

I don't know if it's a problem of the algorithm that must be fixed, or if it's a "bug" in the code.

I really suspect this is an algorithmic issue (I can't find a clear answer in the papers). It would be nice if one of you can try to reproduce the issue with OGDF. If I'm right, then we can report the issue to OGDF.

Meanwhile, I found a simple way to fix the issue: maintain a list of vertices in each component that is update each time an edge is added. Then, in `finish_tric_or_poly`, we can decide the type of the component by checking if it has more edges than vertices (type 2) or not (type 1).

I have changed the construction of the last component to also use `finish_tric_or_poly`. It's cleaner this way and ensures that we have the good type. I had to update some tests accordingly.

Let me know if you agree.

I took a graph from the above example which has one `R` component, and ran OGDF code on it. The OGDF output contained only bonds and cycles and no triconnected components. So I feel it could be a bug in our code, I will debug it tomorrow.
