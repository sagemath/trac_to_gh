# Issue 34007: Don't mark a polynomial doctest "untested"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34244

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2022-07-29 17:26:19

In `sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx`, there is a test block

```
            sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
            sage: f = 1/3 * t
            sage: del f        # untested
```

The last line should be tagged "not tested" or perhaps not tagged at all: since the "untested" tag has no effect, people have been actually running this doctest for years — the line appears to date from 2010.

I propose that we run the test. I don't know why it was originally marked "untested".

Thank you. (I found this one because of my mistake with "untested" earlier, so I searched for other tests with this tag.)
