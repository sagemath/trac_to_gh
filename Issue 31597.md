CC:  yzh

From #29683.

We change name `equalities` to `equations`, which is mostly used for internals and documentation.

We have the equation always last.

We make `CombinatorialFace.ambient_H_indices`, `CombinatorialFace.ambient_Hrepresentation` and `CombinatorialFace.n_ambient_Hrepresentation` consistent.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31834

Looks great to me!

Some small suggestions:
- Doctests of `def ambient_H_indices(self, add_equations=True)`: It would be good to test with `add_equations=False` and `add_equations=True` on a polyhedron that has equation (e.g. on the first `P = polytopes.permutahedron(5)`). The second `P =polytopes.cyclic_polytope(4,6)` has no equation, so it doesn't show a difference. I'm also curious if `add_equations` always appends larger indices no matter the backend is `field` or `ppl`.
- `if add_equations and self._ambient_facets:` probably should be two if's, so that `not self._ambient_facets and add_equations and self._equations` does not result in `equations = ()`?
- Docstring of `Hrepr`: the description is unclear, but since it's deprecated, maybe it doesn't matter.
