Unless something seriously changed after the last `ntl` clean up, I think you haven't doctested this. I tried bumping the version of `ntl` to 9.6.2 in sage-on-gentoo during the 6.10 release cycle and it generated quite a lot of failing doctests.

Works fine, we need to send it to the bots for testing on more archs. Should we try to enable threads. Victor says it does improve performances in many cases. It's done by adding `NTL_THREAD_BOOST=on` to the configuration.
