I had a look at the code. I only have one comment:

1. `parse_one_summand`: In 
   {{{
   #!python
    try:
        right_side = coefficient_ring(right_side)
    except (TypeError, ValueError):
        raise ValueError("Initial value %s given by the equation %s "
                         "is not in %s."
                         % (right_side, eq, coefficient_ring))
    }}}
    I would prefer a `raise ... from None`.
