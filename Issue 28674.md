Finally got rid of that patch? That's awesome news.

I am not familiar with `lambert_w` but that test in `sage/symbolic/relation.py` should be checked by someone who knows if it is correct. The other tests are just a matter of factorization.

Both are correct, 

```
lambert_w(±1/2) = ±(1/2)exp(-lambert_w(±1/2))
```
so

```
(2·lambert_w(±1/2))^2 = 1/exp(2·lambert_w(±1/2))
```

Now, I understand, it is just another root of the equation and the order in which they are stored has changed. It all looks good to me.
