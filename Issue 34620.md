some distro's e.g. Fedora 34, carry giac 1.7, which is too old

too old for what?

Because #32354 raised the version of giac needed to 1.7.0-27 but didn't change `GIAC_MIN_VERSION` accordingly. Raising to 1.9 feels appropriate now.

ubuntu-jammy (LTS) only has 1.7.0.39, so I think it's better to just raise to some 1.7 version

I am OK to raise it to just 1.7.0-27, I cannot think of any other tickets like #32354.

Unfortunately we don't know how to check the patchlevel. `giac --version` only reports 1.7.0 or 1.9.0

Not even the header have the patch level. I do not think upstream provided a way to figure the patch level.

OK, then let's just use 1.9.0. Given that downstream versions of giac are affected by #33848, it's not a big loss that we have to build our own giac on ubuntu-jammy.

Well, I didn't realise the minimum version of giac was so low. I am not sure 1.5 releases would have work well, even before #32354. That's a rather trivial change. Do we want to keep a check on an upper version of giac? Currently at 1.9.999, which means the next major bump of giac will be rejected.
