Because #32354 raised the version of giac needed to 1.7.0-27 but didn't change `GIAC_MIN_VERSION` accordingly. Raising to 1.9 feels appropriate now.

OK, then let's just use 1.9.0. Given that downstream versions of giac are affected by #33848, it's not a big loss that we have to build our own giac on ubuntu-jammy.
