Connection forms, the foundation of the bundle connection implementation, obey certain change of frame formulas. This ticket is devoted to its implementation.

On the same occasion, it will be possible to apply bundle connections to a pair `(s, X)`, where `s` is a section of the vector bundle and `X` is a vector field on the base space. This will probably be implemented in another ticket.

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_form#Connection_forms) for details.

I don't like doctests marked as random that are not random:

```
sage: nab.connection_forms() # random
```

Just go through the different values and get the output explicitly (and maybe check the `len`). This will be more robust and actually catch errors.

Your error messages in `display` don't need to be so excited (just remove the `!` from the end).

While it is good to keep encapsulation, just be aware that changes like this:

```diff
-                    rk = vb._rank
+                    rk = vb.rank()
```

mean extra Python function calls, which are relatively expensive compared to attribute lookup. However, I have no objections to these changes as they seem like they would not have any significant impact on computation times.
