# Issue 18961: Installation instructions in numerical_sage tutorial is obsolete

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19198

The following files

```
src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/numerical_sage/installation_linux.rst
src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/numerical_sage/installation_osx.rst
src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/numerical_sage/mpi4py.rst
```

contain instructions to install a laundry list of packages.

However, those instructions don't actually work, for 2 reasons:
1. they use `install_package()` which no longer works (#16760 and #16759)
2. the packages are no longer installable anyway (#19004)

3. Some of the packages have been archived, and automatic downloading of archived packages was broken independently (?) of #19004. With Sage 6.8, for example:

```
ERROR [download|run:133]: [Errno 404] Not Found: '//mirrors.xmission.com/sage//spkg/archive/list'
sed: /Users/palmieri/.sage//archive.list: No such file or directory
Error: could not find a package matching python-2.5.1-framework on http://mirrors.xmission.com/sage//spkg
```

4. On my OS X machine, `python-2.5.1-framework.spkg` does not install.

For the instructions in `mpi4py.rst`, I can make it work using #19158 (for `openmpi`) and #19187 (for `mpi4py`).
