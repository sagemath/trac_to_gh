contain instructions to install a laundry list of packages.

However, those instructions don't actually work, for 2 reasons:
1. they use `install_package()` which no longer works (#16760 and #16759)
2. the packages are no longer installable anyway (#19004)

For the instructions in `mpi4py.rst`, I can make it work using #19158 (for `openmpi`) and #19187 (for `mpi4py`).
