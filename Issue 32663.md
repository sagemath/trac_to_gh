Multiplicative functions (such as number_of_divisors(), sigma(), divisors() etc.) can be easily computed for factored integers, but they are not defined for Factorization objects. 

It may be worth to add an optional parameter (such as 'check') such that check=True will instruct to verify Factorization for completeness (i.e. that it's composed of prime powers) and complete it, while check=False will just blindly treat Factorization elements as prime powers.

Relatedly, it's worth to add factor() function for Factorization objects, which will complete it when check=True, or just return self when check=False.

Do you mean to implement these multiplicative functions like `gcd` and `lcm` in [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/structure/factorization.py](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/structure/factorization.py)?
