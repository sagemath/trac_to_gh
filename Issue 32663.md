Multiplicative functions (such as number_of_divisors(), sigma(), divisors() etc.) can be easily computed for factored integers, but they are not defined for Factorization objects. 

It may be worth to add an optional parameter (such as 'check') such that check=True will instruct to verify Factorization for completeness (i.e. that it's composed of prime powers) and complete it, while check=False will just blindly treat Factorization elements as prime powers.

Relatedly, it's worth to add factor() function for Factorization objects, which will complete it when check=True, or just return self when check=False.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32900
