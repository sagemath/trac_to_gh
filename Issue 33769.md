# Issue 33769: Fix the Killing form and generators for a Lie subalgebra

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34006

Keywords: lie algebra, subalgebra

Currently the Killing form does not work for a Lie subalgebra since the `adjoint_matrix()` of an element is not returning coordinates in the basis for the subalgebra.

We also fix another issue that the generators of a Lie subalgebra are not elements of the subalgebra, but instead belong to the ambient algebra.

Here is a fix that is fairly simple. Unfortunately I don't know of a more general solution then the whack-a-mole way of fixing such issues as we come across them.

See also #33836 for a similar issue.

Thanks. Positive review once the bot comes back (morally) green?
