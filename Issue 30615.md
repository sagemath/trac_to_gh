The `six` package was part of the Python2-to-Python3 migration scaffolding. Since it is unlikely we will move back to supporting Python 2, we should remove it.

According to https://six.readthedocs.io/#six.Iterator, in Python3 `six.Iterator` is an alias for `object`, so i simply removed the `six.Iterator` intermediate class so that `PrependIterator` directly inherits from Python object.

```

Here is what i have seen regarding packages indicating `six` as a dependency:

- seem not to depend on `six` anymore
  - prompt_toolkit
  - matplotlib

- require an upgrade from our side
  - traitlets
  - packaging (but not yet in a release)
  - cycler (but not in a release, as they did not release since 2016)

- require upstream to adapt
  - notedown
  - dateutil
  - tox
  - sagenb_export

Apparently, some packages depend on six but the dependency is not written in the dependency file (e.g. `sphinxcontrib_websupport`)

It was the plan for #30850, then i noticed that various files from `SAGE_ROOT/build/` were touched by #30627, so in order to avoid useless rebasing and confusion i decided to wait it to be merged before cleaning `__future__` import statements from `SAGE_ROOT/build/`.
