This ticket is a follow-up to #19259:

Currently, subrings of symbolic subrings cannot be created. This can be changed by implementing a composition of the subring functor and letting the respective factory just call the "correct" functor.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19949

Given that #19259 was merged 5 years ago, I think `SymbolicSubring` should not introduce a new positional parameter at the beginning but add it as a keyword parameter. I would also suggest to rename it from `parent` to `ambient` or something like this.

Also, I think `SymbolicSubringFactory` does not achieve unique representation semantics because the same subring can be created using different (functor, parent) pairs.
I think a possible way to fix it would be to give `UniqueRepresentation` to `GenericSymbolicSubringFunctor` and `GenericSymbolicSubring`, and to turn `SymbolicSubringFactory` into a simple function.
