Portions of namespace packages can be installed in separate locations. 

Hence, the `SAGE_LIB` environment variable is no longer meaningful.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33037

This could have some interesting consequences. At the moment `SAGE_SRC` default to `SAGE_LIB` if `SAGE_ROOT` is undefined. The most interesting thing about this behavior is that you can run the test suite on an installed version of sage without having the source. There may be other interesting things about using cython from inside sage witht the sage install rather than the source.

So those things may have to be thought about while removing that variable.

It should also depend on the work on extcode, from `env.py`

```
SAGE_EXTCODE = var("SAGE_EXTCODE", join(SAGE_LIB, "sage", "ext_data"))
```
