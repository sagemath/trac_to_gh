# Issue 21368: Workaround for failing complex_double test on Cygwin

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21605

I fixed this a while ago, but realized I don't think I ever made a ticket for it.

This test fails due to minor numerical differences (again, probably originating in the `log()` function) so that the polynomial returned by `z.algdep(5)` ends up being slightly different (it gets an extra factor of `x^2`).  This makes the test a little more flexible to such differences.

Since the output isn't "random" per se I'd rather used the "ignored" flag I proposed in #21292, so I'm marking that as a (soft) dependency of this ticket).

#21292 remains stalled, but this simple test fix doesn't require it; better to just fix this.

#22759 solves the same problem in a different (arguably better) way.

Oh, that's new--I'll have a look.

I see now--this should fix the underlying problem I think, but I'll have to test it.

Since #22759, I think we can close this as a dup.
