Currently, Sage creates a fractional ideal of the containing number field when calling `.ideal()` on a maximal order. This is a mathematically questionable choice, but perhaps more importantly, it will inevitably cause inconsistencies once #34198 is done — the same code would start returning wildly different objects depending on whether the given order is maximal or not.

In this ticket, I propose to deprecate the use of `.ideal()` on a maximal order to create number-field fractional ideals. This will presumably affect lots of user code, so I think it's good to get the deprecation warning in as soon as possible.
