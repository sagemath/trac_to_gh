Trying to build the doc with sage3, one meets the following issue, for which I have no clue. Travis had an idea, maybe ?

Incidentally, the creation of `RootSystem` includes the construction of its dual, with the root system as a construction parameter. Classic `UniqueRepresentation` memory leak. This is now #25560

(I think this is orthogonal to the problem you're encountering, but I stumbled on it when browsing the relevant code).

I'm not sure, but I don't quite understand the construction in full detail. Nicolas, I know you explained it to me once (I think it was at PyCon a few years ago), but I don't remember the details. Could you explain what is needed and why?

Also, #25560 is a duplicate of #18426.
