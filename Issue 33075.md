# Issue 33075: WeierstrassIsomorphism.degree() returns a Python int

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33312

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2022-02-08 05:56:48

Sage 9.5:

```
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.weierstrass_morphism import WeierstrassIsomorphism
sage: type(WeierstrassIsomorphism.degree(None))
<class 'int'>
```


This method always returns `1`, but it returns it as an `int` instead of an `Integer`.
