Hi Marc, could you please provide more details about this ticket ? Currently (9.2.rc2), we have:


```
sage: I^(2/3)                                                                                                                                                                                                
I^(2/3)
sage: _.n()                                                                                                                                                                                                  
0.500000000000000 + 0.866025403784439*I
```

Sorry, I didn't have time yesterday. This happens for i ∈ ℚ[i], not i ∈ SR (see the linked ticket). But note that #18036 aims to make the glbal symbol i refer to the generator of ℚ[i]. (In fact, I am currently trying again to make that change, and that's how I discovered the issue.)

Oups, I made a mistake while reviewing #25218. Feel free to fix that to the correct thing.

I confirm with the branch I get this:


```
sage: QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)                                                                   
sage: i^(2/3)                                                                                        
I^(2/3)                                                 
sage: n(_)                                                                                           
0.500000000000000 + 0.866025403784439*I
```


Bot is green (except for startup time which I think we can ignore because this ticket does not change anything regarding to that).
