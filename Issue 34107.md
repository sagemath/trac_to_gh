This almost looks like a straightforward upgrade.

Since #33789, we use build isolation for all Python packages that use `sdh_pip_install` - except for those that we invoke with `--no-use-pep517` or `--no-build-isolation`.
When build isolation is in use, it does not matter what is installed in `site-packages`, as it creates a fresh build environment using the wheels in `venv/var/lib/sage/wheels/`; this includes the setuptools wheel, which is provided by our `setuptools_wheel` SPKG.
The versions don't need to be synchronized - a setuptools-based package uses exactly one of the two.
