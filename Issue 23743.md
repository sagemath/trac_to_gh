Original creation time: 2017-10-06 17:05:02

CC:  vdelecroix

Keywords: r-project

Inspired by [this ask.sagemath question.](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/38692/use-ttest-from-r-in-sage/)

Add a couple of usage tips to the "r?" help text.

Added a few usage tips and a few (commented) examples to the help text displayed by r.<tab>

Passes `ptestlong` with no error (transient or not).

==>`needs_review`

You wrongly used Python commnents (starting with `#`) inside doctests. The following is allowed

```
    sage: # my comment
    sage: print(1)
    1
```

the following is better

```
My comment::

    sage: print(1)
    1
```

But the following is wrong

```
# my comment
sage: print(1)
1
```

Thanks for your remarks, Vincent ! Sphinx is a bitch for me..

The pushed version looks good on a terminal and in html, passes `ptestlong` with one failure :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/coding/linear_code.py  # Timed out
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

which turns out to be transient (the doctest passes with no error when ran standalone).

==>`needs_review`.

Cosmetic update to an example, better look on HTML.

Still `needs_review`

Your second line in the example fails for me
