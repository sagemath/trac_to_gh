isinstance may fail on a lazy imported class, which can cause hard to track history-dependent failures (just been hit)::


```
sage: lazy_import('sage.rings.rational_field', 'RationalField')
sage: isinstance(QQ, RationalField)
False
sage: isinstance(QQ, RationalField)
True
```


Would there be a way to ensure that isinstance triggers the importing of the class *before* its use?
