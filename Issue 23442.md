Make the following two examples work

```
sage: G = cartesian_product([Zmod(3), Zmod(6), Zmod(5)])
sage: G((1,1,1)).additive_order()
```

and

```
sage: G1 = SymmetricGroup(3)
sage: G2 = SL(2,3)
sage: G = cartesian_product([G1,G2])
sage: G((G1.gen(0), G2.gen(1))).multiplicative_order()
12
```

LGTM modulo a trivial thing: add a period/full stop after the one-line descriptions for the added methods. Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
