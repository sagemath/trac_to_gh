# Issue 33523: graph embedding is not modified on add_edge

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33760

Original creator: vdelecroix

CC:  dcoudert tscrim

When adding edges, the graph embedding is likely to be no longer valid. Something smarter than raising an error on `get_embedding` should be done.

Not sure what to do here. Do you think we should update the embedding after each modification ? It may induce a significant slowdown.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2022-04-26 16:15:30

Then I suggest to delete the embedding.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2022-04-27 09:48:46

When ? if we do that in `add_edge` / `delete_edge`,  we induce a slowdown even if we don't care of the embedding.

May be we could add some kind of hash  of the graph (or a copy of the list of vertices and edges) to the embedding and test in `_check_embedding_validity` if the hash has changed ? This hash should be updated if the graph is relabeled. This way the slowdown would be only for people using embeddings.

Isn't the simplest to get rid of the `_embedding` attribute?

On the other hand, the instruction `self._embedding = None` should not be much of a slowdown.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2022-04-27 10:25:49

Your slowdown argument also applies to `delete_vertices` where the `_embedding`, `_pos`, `_assoc` are already taken care of...


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2022-04-27 10:31:02

What about deprecating the usage of `set_embedding=True` in `is_planar`?

We should open the discussion to actual users of this feature.

Comment by tscrim created at 2022-04-27 22:29:34

Why not just add an additional boolean attribute `_check_embedding` In the `add_edge()` And other such methods, which is then checked on a call to `get_embedding()`? This way you keep most of the embedding information and can fine-tune other behavior.

Another option would be to store the added edges if there is an embedding already set in order to isolate where to check. Although I think this is more heavy-handed and is too easy to accidentally result in basically double-storing the edges.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2022-04-28 06:01:13

In `add_edge` it might make sense to have a `check_embedding` or `update_embedding`: you preserve the embedding in the underlying surface if your are able to realize your edge inside a face. However, this might not exist or might not be unique. To my mind, it is more reasonable to just delete the embedding in this case (by doing `self._embedding = None`) as well as with `add_vertex`.

The embedding is stable under deleting vertices/edges (possibly dropping the genus but the operation is canonical anyway). Hence updating `._embedding` in the `delete_vertex`/`delete_edge` make sense. Actually, I would even be happier if we do update the `_embedding` attribute only at the time `get_embedding` is called in order to not overload the `delete_vertex`/`delete_edge` methods. The latter is easily done by simply dropping the vertices/edges that are not there anymore.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2022-04-29 09:33:41

One difficulty with adding an extra argument to a method like `add_edge` is that we must also add this argument to all methods calling it, for instance `add_path`,  `add_cycle`,  etc.

It would clearly be better if we could postpone the updates of the embedding to `get_embedding` and/or methods using embeddings.
Deleting the embedding is certainly the best choice after all.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2022-04-29 10:10:38

One can not postpone operations such as `merge_vertices` since the graph has no memory of what happened. One postponing possibility is to do

```
def get_embedding():
    1. remove all vertices that disappear from self._embedding
    2. remove all edges that disappear from self._embedding
    3. check validity
       if correct: return it
       else: delete self._embedding and raise an error
```

If we do so, then we can ignore most of what is done in #33759.

in `_check_embedding_validity`, you may set `self._pos` or `self._pos3d` to `None` and then return `pos` which might be different.

This might be a cause of the doctest errors, in particular doctests with `# optional - python_igraph`, but not only. For instance

On my machine, all tests pass in the `sage/graphs` folder with optional `bliss, igraph, nauty, python_igraph`.

I find the version in the branch more consistent. However it is backward incompatible with the previous behavior (eg `get_pos` used to return invalid positions). Also it might make sense to have a partial positionning or embedding that we want to impose when calling `plot` or `genus`. What do you think?


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2022-06-26 10:17:17

- in `get_embedding`, the description of the method must be clarified. Indeed, the method tries to clean the embedding.

- in `_circle_embedding`, you must initialize pos to None before the try.

- don't forget to align comments on 80 columns mode

- In the doctest

```diff
+            sage: G.get_pos()
+            {1: (-0.9510565163, 0.3090169944),
+            ...
+             9: (0.47552825815, 0.1545084972)}
```

 You should write `(-0.9510..., 0.3090...)` to prevent from numerical instability on other computers.

- concerning partial positioning or embedding for `plot` and `genus`, this is a good idea if not to hard to do. It can be done in another ticket.

If we go this route, than rather then modifying `self._pos`/`self._pos3d`/`self._embedding` I would rather return a modified dictionary but not touch the attributes. So that, even if partial, they could be used by `plot()` or `genus()`.

LGTM. I don't have doctests errors anymore.

The use of partial positioning or embedding should be done in another ticket.
