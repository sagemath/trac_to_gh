Should this be done for every package, or just the ones that fail to build without doing this?

I think it should be applied to every (non-base, non-toolchain) package. On systems that install the gcc from our spkg, really no package can be built before the toolchain is built.

I'm happy to leave it until 9.3 â€” it's a pretty specific problem. The affected packages seem to be pretty limited: `giac`, `numpy`, and `fflas_fpack`. (I haven't tried all of Sage's packages, but about among 100 so far, the only failures come directly or indirectly from these packages.)
