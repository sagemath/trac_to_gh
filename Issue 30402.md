As a follow-up to #29355 (which separated build-time from run-time determination of number of threads to use), we get rid of `src/bin/sage-num-threads.py` completely by implementing the desired defaulting behavior for the number of threads used in `src/sage/parallel/ncpus.py` and `src/sage/doctest/control.py.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30639
