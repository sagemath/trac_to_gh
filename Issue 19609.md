# Issue 19609: Beautify README for plaintext to markdown for github

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19846

Original creator: karandesai-96

Original creation time: 2016-01-08 11:43:23

Assignee: karandesai-96

Keywords: README, markdown, github

Most of the READMEs of Github repositories are markdown files (.md extension). Markdown files are rendered by Github and they look nicely formatted and better to the eye than plaintext files.

The existing README.txt has to be converted to a README.md for better aesthetic look for users viewing Github repository, while preserving the readibility if viewed as a plaintext file.

I have obtained a fork of the source and did the job in the separate branch :
https://github.com/karandesai-96/sage/tree/karandesai-96-readme-beautify
I will be glad to receive positive reviews.

The original README.txt looks like this:

https://www.github.com/sagemath/sage

The beautified version, README.md looks like this:

https://github.com/karandesai-96/sage/tree/t/19846/beautify_readme

I have taken care of your advice and fired another commit to improve the readability of markdown version also as a plaintext.

Here is the raw plaintext version of the markdown file:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karandesai-96/sage/t/19846/beautify_readme/README.md

This ticket can be reviewed and closed now. Though I'll be happy to have any type of suggestions and workarounds.

Please wrap the lines in README.md to stay within 80 characters (unless there's a very good reason not to), just as README.txt.

`@`nbruin:

README.md as a plaintext file looks like this :

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karandesai-96/sage/t/19846/beautify_readme/README.md

where each line contains 80 characters or less.

Github renders this README.md by compiling it to html and displaying it beautifully as:

https://github.com/karandesai-96/sage/tree/t/19846/beautify_readme

Anywhere else other than github (in text editors on local machine for example), the README will appear as the first link and not the second one.

To create a new line in markdown, the plaintext version must have one complete blank line between two lines, or a <br> tag written at the end of each line. This will make the plaintext version of the file very lengthy and containing too many blank lines or <br> tags at the end of each line.

Is it fine to have too many <br> tags in the README paintext version (as per first link) ?

Please reply and I will take necessary actions.

I see: there are some long lines, but those are URLs (in which case it's fine to leave them). The line breaks should be fine as-is.

Hi `@`nbruin

I wrapped the text in the Markdown version too, and I looks more cleaner and appealing to the eye than before.

Have a look: https://github.com/karandesai-96/sage/tree/t/19846/beautify_readme

The clutter in plaintext version of file was saved as I did not have to put <br/> tags at the end of each line. Appending two blankspaces at the end of line means a line break, in markdown! :)

The plaintext version is has two blank spaces after each line, but it looks same:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karandesai-96/sage/t/19846/beautify_readme/README.md

I hope the README now serves both ways:

> It renders in a beautiful way, for the users on Github to view.

> It is retained readability in plain text format too, for another users.

Regards, Karan.

```
This will download the package from  
sage.math.washington.edu
```

is outdated, isn't it? Packages are downloaded from mirrors nowadays.

I always built it from source, though I know about the mirrors.

What should I change it to ? And please do point out another such outdated information, or any typo. I'll fix it.

replace `sage.math.washington.edu` by `a Sage mirror`. 

It does not matter whether or not you build something from source --- optional and experimental packages are to be downloaded (once, at least).

You should keep in mind that most people will read this file while opening the source tarball, not via github, so it has to be readable as a (non-markdown) text file as well. In particular, you should indent the text so that it is easy to identify/skip some paragraphs, and indent the pieces of code even more so that it does not break the reading.

I was notified about this in the mailing list, that the text must be readable as a plaintext file too. I agree with you, reformatting the file as you say will ensure better readability. This will be rectified within next 24 hours ! :-)

Hi `@`tmonteil,

I have done the task as you asked to.

Please do have a look: [​https://github.com/karandesai-96/sage/tree/t/19846/beautify_readme](https://github.com/karandesai-96/sage/tree/t/19846/beautify_readme)

Raw content of MarkDown (.md) version: [​https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karandesai-96/sage/t/19846/beautify_readme/README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karandesai-96/sage/t/19846/beautify_readme/README.md)

Raw content of PlainText (.txt) version: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagemath/sage/master/README.txt

Please compare the readability of raw content of both the versions and let me know your thoughts ! :)

I hope the recent two commits pushed by me have improved the readability of the markdown file viewed in plaintext.

Regards, 

Karan

A quick glance says this is readable as plain text now... Thierry or others, any comments overall?

looks like a rebase is needed, but this should not be a problem.

Someone else should check, but maybe the only necessary rebasing is

I just consulted the README file of sage for some reason and noticed that it is now using markdown whereas everything in sage is written with RestructuredText. I do not understand why we went from rst to md only for the README file since github knows to make .rst file look beautiful too. Maybe the only thing we needed to do was to rename the README.txt as README.rst. See for instance: https://github.com/seblabbe/slabbe
