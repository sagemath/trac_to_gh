# Issue 14879: Fix pdf export of graphs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15116

Original creator: defeo

Original creation time: 2013-08-28 12:56:30

CC:  nthiery

Keywords: graph plot

The following code raises an error


```
sage: p = graphs.CompleteGraph(2).plot()
sage: p.save('tmp.pdf')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AssertionError: 
```


The error seems to be caused by edges, indeed


```
sage: p = graphs.CompleteGraph(1).plot()
sage: p.save('tmp.pdf')
```


works fine.

Interesting. Indeed a two vertex, zero edge graph also works fine:


```
sage: g = Graph(2)
sage: pic = g.plot()
sage: pic.save('two-verts.pdf')
```

This looks very much like https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/2418. The patch given there (included in matplotlib-1.3.1) fixes the issue.

Gosh ! They have quivers there too ? `O_O` 

Good news, though. Well, it means that we need to upgrade matplotlib now `:-)`
