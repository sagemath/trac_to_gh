# Issue 11020: replace NetworkX empty dictionaries as edge labels with Sage default None

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11182

Original creator: rlm

Original creation time: 2011-04-12 20:35:11

Assignee: jason, ncohen, rlm

Since NetworkX switched their default edge labels, many of the graph generators have changed their output since they rely on NX functions. There should be an option to switch the empty dictionaries back to None labels.

This needs to be rebased to sage-4.7.alpha5:

```
applying /scratch/jdemeyer/merger/patches/trac_11182.patch
patching file sage/graphs/graph.py
Hunk #2 FAILED at 1259
1 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/graphs/graph.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```
