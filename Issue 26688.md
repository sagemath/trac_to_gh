# Issue 26688: nf -> RR conversion should not be slower than nf -> RIF

Given a quadratic number field, conversion to MPFR floating point is terribly slow compared to the more complicated MPFI interval floating point conversion

```
sage: %timeit RR(a)
1000 loops, best of 3: 224 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit RIF(a)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 919 ns per loop
```

Implementing `_mpfr_` is a complete failure (for now)...

Declaring a `_mpfr_` method is not enough to get a direct coercion path from `K -> RR`... see discussion at [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/vyTNvdw0Eio).

Retarging tickets optimistically to the next milestone.  If you are responsible for this ticket (either its reporter or owner) and don't believe you are likely to complete this ticket before the next release (8.7) please retarget this ticket's milestone to sage-pending or sage-wishlist.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
