This isn't acceptable. Those inequalites are the same, only the defining vector differs by a positive scalar.

Minor things:


```diff
-        cross_slack_matrix = self_matrix*hom_Vrep
+        cross_slack_matrix = self_matrix * hom_Vrep
```



```diff
-        if any(self.A()*line.vector() for line in other.lines()):
+        if any(self.A() * line.vector() for line in other.lines()):
```


In the TEST block, I would remove the `QQ(*)` to save some space... (could you also indent/line split?)

Why is there a lonely `::` ?:


```diff
+            False
+
+        ::
+
+            sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,0,0],[0,1,0]], lines=[[1,0,0]])
```

People use it to group examples, when they are too lazy to write down a nice sentence for each example.
