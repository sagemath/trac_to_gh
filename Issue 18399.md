Is there a way to have such tables added automatically??? I imagine it is very easy to forget about updating it when functions change...

AFAIK no. And adding one should be done on Sphinx, which is used for the documentation.

Ping. This should be quite trivial to review.

Frédéric? Just an index added, an easy review.

Forget. As Nathann made #18926, this is better to implement with it.

(As the "index" is just an alphabetical list. This is totally different with, say, `posets.py`.)

...and he already added this index to that ticket. Hence I mark this as duplicate / positive_review ready to close.
