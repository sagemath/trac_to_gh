# Issue 11155: isogeny code uses deprecated(?) multi-variate gcd

Keywords: isogeny multivariate dual

In sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_curve_isogeny (of sage 4.6.2) the routine two_torsion_part() invokes a gcd on two polynomials.  When the polynomials belong to a multivariate ring, an error occurs.  Perhaps this is because the gcd routine in sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_element has been commented out (because it uses Singular?!).

Converting psi (and perhaps psi2) to univariate polynomials within two_torsion_part() before taking the gcd seems to work, but there seems to be other code in the module which uses a multivariate ring when a univariate ring would suffice (e.g. in __init_from_kernel_polynomial).

I discovered this error when trying to create a dual isogeny (for an elliptic curve over Q(t)).  The original isogeny was a cyclic 2-isogeny and thus the dual should also be a cyclic 2-isogeny.  Without giving more details on how I created the curve, let me simply report the error message which results when I call isogeny.dual():

I have run into this myself, but never had time to fix it as the problem always seemed to grow bigger.  Feel free to make a patch!  Before you do, please note that there are other patches around which affect this file -- one of which splits it into two -- so it would best to work on top of that.

Applies to 4.7.1.rc1

The patch trac_11327-isogs.patch was made by me from an edited version of ell_curve_isogeny.py which cjh sent me.  It needs work.

Very sorry to have forgotten about this after 3 years.  I just created a new ticket and a simpler solution to a similar problem at #16779.  The patch I will put there does not solve the problem over function fields, and this ticket should remain open but with #16779 as a dependency.

All tests pass and the problem is solved indeed. Thanks also for all the improvments on the documentation.

Tiny: There is a "#" appearing in the documentation of the class `EllipticCurveIsogeny`. So I changed that.
