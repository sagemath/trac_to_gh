# Issue 20264: Don't use today() for default arguments

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20501

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-04-26 09:50:53

The file `src/sage/finance/stock.py` contains this line

```
def history(self,startdate='Jan+1,+1900',enddate=date.today().strftime("%b+%d,+%Y"), histperiod='daily'):
```

This causes the string with today's date to appear in `__doc__` which makes little sense. It would be better to use `None` as default argument and then change `None` to today in the function body.
