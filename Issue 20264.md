The file `src/sage/finance/stock.py` contains this line

```
def history(self,startdate='Jan+1,+1900',enddate=date.today().strftime("%b+%d,+%Y"), histperiod='daily'):
```

This causes the string with today's date to appear in `__doc__` which makes little sense. It would be better to use `None` as default argument and then change `None` to today in the function body.
