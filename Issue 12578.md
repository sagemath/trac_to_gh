Assignee: @alexanderdreyer

CC:  @nexttime polybori @malb @burcin

Keywords: C++11 GCC 4.7.0 CXXFLAGS -fpermissive

The following was found out here:
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/e2a87c73dc1625f2

```
* PolyBoRi fails to build due to stricter (C++11) scoping / name look-up rules.
    Unfortunately PolyBoRi doesn't honor CXXFLAGS, so I had to use CXX="g++-4.7.0 -fpermissive" to make the spkg build. 
```

The scoping issue should be fixed here:
https://bitbucket.org/brickenstein/polybori/changeset/43b3931ceed7/raw/

Also, we should support CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS (ANd CPPFLAGS?) in the spkg.

### Current spkg

Works as advertised, i.e., builds with GCC 4.7.0 (*without* `-fpermissive`) and also honors `CXXFLAGS` in the C++ compile commands (although I have to admit I haven't checked *all of them*, just a couple).  Also passes its test suite.

I haven't really looked at the new spkg itself though, but I *expect* it to have no flaws... ;-)

Ok, did so.  "Global" `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` are properly added now, and upstream patches fixing the name look-up issue get applied.

The last revision isn't tagged yet (which the merge script then will do later), but more importantly, `SPKG.txt` lacks a new changelog entry.
