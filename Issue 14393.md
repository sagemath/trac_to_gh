4.6.4 and 4.8.0 are out, let's package them:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/gcc-4.6.4.spkg
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/gcc-4.8.0.spkg

For the first one I picked up the three relevant archives on GCC mirrors, for the second one I picked upped the only big archive available and ran Jeroen's script.

gcc-4.8.0 should probably be experimental.

GCC-4.8.1 is [coming soon](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2013-05/msg00172.html):

```
GCC 4.8.1 Status Report (2013-05-17)

The GCC 4.8.1-rc1 release candidate has been released.
The branch is frozen now, all changes require release manager approval
until the final release of GCC 4.8.1 which should happen roughly
one week after the release candidate.
```

i've put the spkges on the server into optional and experimental. moved the 4.7.2 one, which is standard now, into the archive (i.e. consider it removed)
