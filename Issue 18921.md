This is really really bad:

```
$ ./sage -i chomp
Attempting to download package chomp
Error: could not find a package matching chomp
       Try 'sage --package list' to see the available packages
       Did you mean: csdp, gmp, cbc, cmake, cvxopt?

IMHO the only thing that needs to be done is make chomp a new-style package.

The mixture of old and new packages has always been broken. Let it die. We can support old packages as legacy but not mash it up with new packages in an utterly confusing manner to users.

1. There has been no deprecation at all for this, which really goes against Sage's 1-year deprecation policy. You cannot just break user's work flows like this.

2. Old-style packages still appear in various places in the documentation:

- Various places document `sage -i chomp` (or other old-style packages)
- `sage --optional` shows both new-style and old-style packages
- We even have a page in the developer documentation about creating old-style packages.

That `sage -i python` used to install an ancient Python is a bug. That the undesirable behavior of silently installing ancient packages happened to be somewhat(1) desirable for chomp doesn't make it less of a bug.

(1) The chomp spkg actually doesn't compile with modern gcc due to tighter C++ checking

Agreed. But #19004 wasn't the right fix.

This ticket isn't about `chomp` at all, I'm just using that package as one example of an old-style package.

Great! My last commit does that, since we no longer look for standard packages:

```
Attempting to download package python
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.

>>> Checking online list of huge packages.
Error: could not find a package matching python

I was able to install (old-style) chomp without any problems with this ticket. Moreover it doesn't let me install python. Overall I'm ready to set this to positive review except for an interface question.

Could we add an option to the warning that if the user presses Y or enter (after perhaps a mandatory 5 second reading period) that the old-style spkg installs? If this is too difficult, then could we drop the sleep to 15 seconds or so (it's not that long of a message)?

Urgh thats so ugly I just threw up in my mouth a little. Ever wondered why none of the gnu coreutils does the ask + timeout? 

I expect you to fix the topcom/TOPCOM issue and do something about the totally broken packages.

See #19220 for `TOPCOM`. That and `python` are the two serious problems with old-style packages, as far as I understand. Other old-style packages may be broken, but that's not new. I don't know of any other packages which will break the Sage installation if you try to install them.

Well somebody has to go through the list. Fun things:
* kash3 is binary-only. Somehow that wasn't OK for gap3 but you just re-enabled another optional binary-only package.
* Anything that is pip installable is wayyy outdated, terrible UX to just use ancient cruft even if it works. Nobody even made a list of which packages fall in that category
* The undocumented: soya_cvs-2006.05.09.spkg has no SPKG.txt, wtf is it and why is it a 9-year old cvs snapshot?

And by "somebody", I mean somebody who was is favor of this ticket.
