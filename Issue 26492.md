The current Sage's curl 7.56 (over a year old) does not work with some ssl configurations, resulting in e.g.

```
libtool: compile:  cc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I../include -I../lib -I../lib -DBUILDING_LIBCURL -DCURL_HIDDEN_SYMBOLS -I/usr/local/include -I
/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include -fvisibility=hidden -Qunused-arguments -Os -pthread -MT vtls/libcurl_la-gtls.lo -MD -MP -MF v
tls/.deps/libcurl_la-gtls.Tpo -c vtls/gtls.c  -fPIC -DPIC -o vtls/.libs/libcurl_la-gtls.o
vtls/openssl.c:128:22: error: static declaration of 'OpenSSL_version_num' follows non-static declaration
static unsigned long OpenSSL_version_num(void)
                     ^
/usr/local/include/openssl/crypto.h:342:15: note: previous declaration is here
unsigned long OpenSSL_version_num(void);
              ^
```

(this is with [libressl](https://www.libressl.org/))

7.62 fixes this.
