```
Type polygon.options for a dictionary of the default options for polygons. 
```

This seems to not be correct.

```
sage: polygon.options
---------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'options'
```

We should fix the documentation to 

```
sage: sage.plot.polygon.polygon2d.options
{'alpha': 1, 'legend_label': None, 'rgbcolor': (0, 0, 1), 'thickness': 0}
```

or something else that fixes this.

Apparently the documentation is actually *wrong* about how `reset` works.  I'll look into this.    This should definitely be fixed at the same time, so "needs work", but the initial change is fine.

This is really weird.  Apparently the resetting of options actually *does* work!  But...

```

sage: polygon2d.options
{'alpha': 1, 'legend_label': None, 'rgbcolor': (0, 0, 1), 'thickness': 0}
sage: P = polygon([[1,2], [5,6], [5,0]]); P # looks blue
sage: polygon2d.options['rgbcolor']=(1,0,0)
sage: P = polygon([[1,2], [5,6], [5,0]]); P # looks red
sage: polygon2d.options
{'alpha': 1, 'legend_label': None, 'rgbcolor': (1, 0, 0), 'thickness': 0}
sage: polygon2d.defaults()
{'alpha': 1, 'legend_label': None, 'rgbcolor': (0, 0, 1), 'thickness': 0}
sage: polygon2d.reset()
sage: polygon2d.options
{'alpha': 1, 'legend_label': None, 'rgbcolor': (1, 0, 0), 'thickness': 0}
sage: P = polygon([[1,2], [5,6], [5,0]]); P # looks blue again like it should
```

But for some reason the `options` never changed.

I've asked about this on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/3a4aa8c203c36c52).  But in any case if that doesn't work, it is also that way on disk and others (I've checked), so that wouldn't hold things up on this.  

Anyway, that means we just have to change to `polygon2d.reset()` and `polygon3d.reset()`.
