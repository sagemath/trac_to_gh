How about:

If the V-representation of the polygon contains only vertices and a single ray, then every V-representation object has exact two adjacent ones. The cyclic order is unique up to reversal of direction and choice of starting point. 

If the V-representation of the polygon contains vertices and two rays, then the two rays are not adjacent to each other. The cyclic order then starts with one of the rays and ends with the other ray.

This implies that the two extreme rays of a pointed cone in `R^2` non-adjacent. Which is obviously wrong: these rays have a common vertex, which is an element of the polyhedron of dimension one less, and due to this they are adjacent, just as two facets of a polytope in `R^3` would be adjacent if they had a common edge (or two edges would be adjacent if they had a common vertex).

Did you mean to say *more than 1 vertex*, rather than *vertices*?

 
Why does it only talk about polygons? What about bigger dimensions?

There is a typo on line 261 of `geometry/polyhedron/base.py`: exact->exactly

Yes, I was thinking about more than one vertex (and thats what the doctest is doing). I've fixed the wording and the typo.

In fact, now I think the setup is mathematically not quite sound. Sorry for not noticing this straight away.
In my book, rays and edges are of the same dimension. One cannot normally even talk about adjacency between rays and vertices, yet you do (lines 974-9 of `geometry/polyhedron/base.py`).
Although you can certainly talk about incidence between them, by inclusion, as usual.

You can have adjacency graphs between faces of the same dimension (bounded or not, does not matter). 
It would simplify things if one knows what exactly is behind the error message in the description.

A ray by itself does not define an edge, so you can't identify these two concepts. I claim that it does make sense to treat V-representation objects (vertices, rays, lines) on the same footing when talking about vertex-adjacencies. To span an edge you need two vertices, a vertex and a ray, or a vertex and a line.

Alternatively, you can understand this by going to projective space. Now rays are just points at infinity...

The original error message in the ticket description is a bug in my code for plotting where I didn't handle some special case with rays correctly.

By they way, it would be great to know what exactly you (and Sage :-)) mean by the V-representation. Is it always reduced?
Does it always distinguish between vertices, rays, and lines? A reference?

> To span an edge you need two vertices, a vertex and a ray, or a vertex and a line.

the classical definition of a face of a convex set B is that it is the intersection of a supporting hyperplane with B.
And the dimension of the face is the topological dimension of the intersection. This way it certainly does not make sense to talk about adjacency beween vertices and rays, as they are objects of different *type* (i.e., dimension).

>

No, you certainly do not want to squash your affine space. You want to add the hyperplane at infinity. Then the rays  have two vertices, one of which at infinity. (And parallel rays intersect at infinity, which might make sense for your purposes, or not...)

Regarding lines, there are two schools, one of which just forbids full lines in convex sets in `RP^n` all together.

Do I understand you right that you're "unrolling" a minimal V-representation when building up your adjacencies? E.g. if your polyhedron is a polytope plus a ray then you have to "paste" a ray into each vertex, and this gives you your parallel "half-infinite edges"?

The only trailing whitespace policy that we have in effect is to not care about trailing whitespace. In particular, this might break my other patches on top of this one for no good reason.

When you say "we have", do you mean "I have" ?

Well, please do as you want. But I will not be happy with any ticket if the bot is not fully green.

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1)], rays=[(0,1)])
sage: P.adjacency_matrix?
...
Definition:	P.adjacency_matrix(self)
Docstring:
       This is an alias for "vertex_adjacency_matrix()"
...
```


this seems to indicate that only vertices can be adjacent, no?
Another very confusing thing is

```
Two V-representation objects are adjacent if they generate a 
 	975	        (1-dimensional) face of the polyhedron. Examples are two 
 	976	        vertices of a polytope that bound an edge, or a vertex and a 
 	977	        ray of a polyhedron that generate a bounding half-line of the 
 	978	        polyhedron. 
```

in `geometry/polyhedron/base.py`. 


IMHO the whole documentation for the adjacency is a mess. I am unable to make sense out of it, and the link to PPL docs (which aren't clear to me at all) is not helping much, either.  Please, please, define what is meant by "ray" somewhere. I just don't get it...

I've expanded the documentation for V-representation objects and for the adjacency rules. Please let me know if anything is still unclear.

In order to have clearer examples I added #11763 to the dependencies, this ticket improves output and introduces the `polyhedron.faces(dim)` method which is useful if you have to talk about one-dimensional faces.
