I'm trying this out. A few quick comments:

- In SPKG.txt, the line `=== matplotlib-1.1.0 (Jason Grout, 09 Nov 2012) ===` should say `1.2.0`.
- The file `patches/mkdir-race-condition.patch` should be removed from the repository (according to `hg status`, the repo is not clean right now).
- I'm getting doctest failures in the plot directory:

```
The following tests failed:

	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/colors.py # 8 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/graphics.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot.py # 2 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/plot_field3d.py # 1 doctests failed
```

 The ones in colors.py are all of the form

```
    sage: get_cmap('jet')
Expected:
    <matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap instance at 0x...>
Got:
    <matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap object at 0x11103e8d0>
```

 and the ones in graphics.py are similar. These are easy to fix, of course. Other failures:

This is very wrong and should be fixed:

```
        assert(cm is not None) 
    except (TypeError, AssertionError, ValueError): 
```

`AssertionError` should *never* be handled in an exception block, unless you have very good reasons to do so. The obvious solution is replacing `assert()` by something else.

I know this problem isn't caused by this patch, but since it is easy to fix, you should fix it.
