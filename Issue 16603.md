Keywords: stochastic

Currently it is not checked that bistochastic matrices have nonnegative integer entries. However, this is one of the conditions
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_stochastic_matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_stochastic_matrix) and the Birkhoffâ€“von Neumann theorem does not hold otherwise.

```
sage: m = matrix([[-1,2],[2,-1]])
sage: m.is_bistochastic() 
True
```
