Caches can be corrupted as you doctest stuff, you never know when things die. The new doctest framework does not recover gracefully:

```
[vbraun@volker-desktop hg]$ echo foobar > ~/.sage/timings_dt_test.json 
[vbraun@volker-desktop hg]$ sage -tp sage/doctest/
Running doctests with ID 2013-03-28-12-29-46-c1280e16.

Volker, #14292 (I have a patch but it's on sage.math which is currently offline) should ensure that the JSON file cannot be corrupted anymore. So, *if* we get an error loading the JSON file, it should be a genuine error and we want to get a doctest failure.

So we could close this one as duplicate of #14292.
