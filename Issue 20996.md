Keywords: map-reduce windows cygwin

This fixes two sort of related issues.

The first is a test failure I had for this module on my Windows machine (though possibly not all that related to Cygwin):

```
sage -t src/sage/parallel/map_reduce.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/parallel/map_reduce.py", line 217, in sage.parallel.map_reduce
Failed example:
    try:
        res = EX.run(timeout=0.01)
    except AbortError:
        print("Computation timeout")
    else:
        print("Computation normally finished")
        res
Expected:
    Computation timeout
Got:
    Exception in thread Thread-1:

```

The computation timeout method crashes and the computation finishes "normally" due to a bug in the ordering of `self._timer.cancel()` and `self.finish()` which I fixed immediately.

However, the test was still failing due to the calculation still finishing before the timeout.  I lowered the timeout by an order of magnitude, which worked around it.  But I also wanted to convince myself that the timeout was really working properly, so I instead modified the test to timeout on a much larger calculation.  That was failing which led to finding the second issue fixed here, which is described in more detail in the commit message.

I am trying to move towards py3, so I keep an eye on backward moves. There are surely many that escape my vigilance.

I would be strongly in favor of imposing that new code must be py3-compatible. Some of the patchbot plugins try to look out for that.

"from six.moves import queue" will do the job for you here.

I am using six all over the place, so I guess it is required.

Hi Erik,

In the method `get_result` you added a timeout on the call to `self._results.get`. Though I'm Ok with that, if this timeout fire your join the timer and simply return. I'd rather have an `AbortError` raised in that case. More precisely, I think the right way is to call the `abort` method, as if the other timer has fired. Actually, I'm not sure why you want this new timer. It seems to be redundant with `self.timer`, isn't it ?

By "new timer" do you mean the new timeout in `self._results.get()` (since I didn't add any new timer per se)?  I admit I don't exactly recall, except that the main problem I had was very long blocking (for large computations) at this `get()` call.  In the commit message I wrote:

```
  Sometimes the main thread could hang at self._results.get() in self.get_results()
  This is because if a worker gets started on walk_branch_locally for a very large
  input before the computation is canceled, then self._results.get() will hang on
  the result from that worker.

  This is fixed by having self._results.get() timeout after no more than the
  timeout for the computation so that it can check the self._aborted flag before
  trying again.  This did necessitate changing self._results from a full-featured
  Queue rather than SimpleQueue; not sure what noticable impact that will have on
  a large calculation.
```

I think the point here is that the abort timer only calls `self._shutdown()` which sends poison pills to the workers but doesn't forcibly kill them.  So if a worker is somewhere deep in `walk_branch_locally` it doesn't get the poison pill. Instead it tries to finish the job it's currently doing, and `self._results.get()` waits forever.

But I guess you might have a point that now the `Timer` thread is not as important.  I guess one use for it still is if the `reduce_function` takes too long for some reason.
