# Issue 31489: Cross-link related prime and prime power functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31726

The documentation of the following related functions:

- `is_power_of_two`, `is_prime`, `is_prime_power`,
  `is_pseudoprime`, `is_pseudoprime_power`, `is_square`,
  `is_squarefree`, `nth_prime`, `primes_first_n`, `prime_pi`,
  `prime_powers`, `prime_range`, `primes`, `Primes`

could be improved by adding appropriate cross-links.

For instance, `nth_prime` and `prime_pi` give bijections
from positive integers to primes and back:


```
sage: nn = [1 .. 8]
sage: nn
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

sage: pp = list(primes(20))
sage: pp
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

sage: pp == [nth_prime(n) for n in nn]
True
sage: nn == [prime_pi(p) for p in pp]
True
```


but, up to Sage 9.3, docs for `prime_pi` and `nth_prime`
don't mention each other.

Changing keywords from "" to "cross-link".
