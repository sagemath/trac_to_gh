# Issue 26187: Bugs in inverses of Yokonuma-Hecke algebras

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26424

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2018-10-07 01:47:26

CC:  andrew.mathas chapoton

Keywords: Yokonuma Hecke

Coefficients are not taken into account:

```
sage: Y = algebras.YokonumaHecke(3, 3)
sage: t = 3*prod(Y.t())
sage: t
3*t1*t2*t3
sage: ~t
t1^2*t2^2*t3^2
```

The inverse of 0 is not a `NotImplementedError`:

```
sage: ~Y.zero()
...
NotImplementedError: inverse only implemented for basis elements (monomials in the generators)
```

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
