CC:  @AndrewAtLarge @fchapoton

Keywords: Yokonuma Hecke

Coefficients are not taken into account:

```
sage: Y = algebras.YokonumaHecke(3, 3)
sage: t = 3*prod(Y.t())
sage: t
3*t1*t2*t3
sage: ~t
t1^2*t2^2*t3^2
```

The inverse of 0 is not a `NotImplementedError`:

```
sage: ~Y.zero()
...
NotImplementedError: inverse only implemented for basis elements (monomials in the generators)
```
