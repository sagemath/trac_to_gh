This test started failing for me, due to there being more than 2000 matches for "tree" in my docs (even when considering whole word matches).  The rewritten test demonstrates, I believe, that the failure is not in the code itself, but rather that my docs directory just started having a larger number of matches than the hard-coded threshold.  I'm not sure why that is, and it's possible I need to do a `make doc-clean`.

But nevertheless this test can still be rewritten to not depend on some arbitrary thresholds.

(Incidentally, I also noticed that this full text search over all the docs is very, very slow.  Doesn't Sphinx generate some indices we could be taking advantage of...?)

FWIW running a `make doc-clean` and rebuilding the docs in the source tree where I was getting this failure also fixed the failure of the original test, as I suspected it might.  Nevertheless I think this rewrite makes more sense.
