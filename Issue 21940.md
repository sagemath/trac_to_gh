not sure I am really qualified to review this; could you at least provide a jupyter notebook with the graphics in question, to test if it works?

the notebook looks good, besides `ellinit("10a1")` needs some extra data I don't have installed

```

  ***   at top-level: ellinit("10a1")
  ***                 ^---------------
  *** ellinit: error opening elldata file: `/home/dima/Sage/sage-dev/local/share/pari/elldata/ell0'.
```

(well, this is not relevant to this ticket).

Tonight I'll see how this goes on OSX, and hopefully it's good to go then.

As documented in the demo notebook, that's on purpose, to show that error handling works fine. There is no curve called `10a1`, so installing a database won't help.
