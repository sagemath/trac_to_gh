the notebook looks good, besides `ellinit("10a1")` needs some extra data I don't have installed

```

  ***   at top-level: ellinit("10a1")
  ***                 ^---------------
  *** ellinit: error opening elldata file: `/home/dima/Sage/sage-dev/local/share/pari/elldata/ell0'.
```

(well, this is not relevant to this ticket).

Tonight I'll see how this goes on OSX, and hopefully it's good to go then.
