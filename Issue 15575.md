Most of this seems fine.  Keep in mind that the initial work was done by a native Slavic-language speaker, if I recall correctly, so perhaps lacking articles is not a surprise.  Also, I don't have an opinion on whether we need periods for the option list.  I do have one question:

```
In most cases returns SymbolicEquation
```

So, is the output block saying what the function does (so, needs "returns") or giving a command (so, needs "return")?  Or perhaps some third option (like "returns a")?  I usually like the first option, but I don't recall if there is a policy.

There is indeed a convention, and it argues against the "returns" form:

Ah, I thought maybe that had been clarified recently.  Glad I wasn't dreaming it.

Another thing found in a few places:

```
Initials conditions are optional.
```

Maybe "initial"?

And:

```
Higher ordered, 
```

Probably is "higher order".

Do you want "laplace" capitalized?

I want to give this positive review, but this isn't fixed.  Idiomatic (English) for diffeqs is "higher order", not "higher ordered", whether or not one appends "equation".
