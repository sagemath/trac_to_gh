Most of this seems fine.  Keep in mind that the initial work was done by a native Slavic-language speaker, if I recall correctly, so perhaps lacking articles is not a surprise.  Also, I don't have an opinion on whether we need periods for the option list.  I do have one question:

```
In most cases returns SymbolicEquation
```

So, is the output block saying what the function does (so, needs "returns") or giving a command (so, needs "return")?  Or perhaps some third option (like "returns a")?  I usually like the first option, but I don't recall if there is a policy.

There is indeed a convention, and it argues against the "returns" form:

The commit adapts the text to it, finally. Thanks for the hint.

Ah, I thought maybe that had been clarified recently.  Glad I wasn't dreaming it.

Another thing found in a few places:

```
Initials conditions are optional.
```

Maybe "initial"?

And:

```
Higher ordered, 
```

Probably is "higher order".

Do you want "laplace" capitalized?

I want to give this positive review, but this isn't fixed.  Idiomatic (English) for diffeqs is "higher order", not "higher ordered", whether or not one appends "equation".

There remains at least one "laplace" without capitals

```
Solve an ODE using laplace transforms
```

There also remains at least one typo "singlar"

chapoton, I'm happy with this now in principle - if you find the documentation still builds correctly, it shouldn't affect any doctests so you can change to positive review.
