Assignee: jason, was

This is one of the steps at #10465.  Links there point to motivating discussion.

This is a simple function which mostly exists to make it obvious that there is an all-in-one function to do this.

It would appear that conjugate() method could stand some speed improvements for large matrices, though a few more experiments would be needed to be sure it was the creation of a new matrix, or the actual conjugations.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10471
