This is one of the steps at #10465.  Links there point to motivating discussion.

This is a simple function which mostly exists to make it obvious that there is an all-in-one function to do this.

It would appear that conjugate() method could stand some speed improvements for large matrices, though a few more experiments would be needed to be sure it was the creation of a new matrix, or the actual conjugations.

v2 patch is identical, except for some minor changes in doctest formatting.

Looks good to me. Too bad we can't tab on things like A.conjugate()...
