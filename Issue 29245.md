# Issue 29245: Fix assorted documentation errors in TESTS blocks and underscore methods

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29482

Original creator: mjo

Original creation time: 2020-04-09 12:26:03

Running,


```
sage --docbuild --include-tests-blocks --underscore reference html
```


fails all over the place because it doesn't get checked by default. Here I plan to fix the lowest of low-hanging fruit.

There are a million more of these, but this branch can be reviewed relatively easily, and merging them quickly (in chunks) will help avoid merge conflicts from me touching every file in the tree.
