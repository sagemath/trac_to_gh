A number of reported build errors on sage-devel seem to arise because people are building as root. We should check for this in the `./configure` script and print a clear message, rather than the current situation (letting the build continue for a while and then printing something a bit more cryptic).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17420

Do I need to run autoconf or something to get this to work? When I checkout this branch and run `make` as root, it doesn't fail immediately. (This is on OS X, and note autoconf is not installed by default.)

To be on the safe side I suggests you add

```
AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])
```

before calling AX_CHECK_ROOT macro. I am guessing you currently have a sane default but we want it to be bulletproof.
