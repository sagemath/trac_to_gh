Implement various things to help study rings of SL_3 invariants, as in the paper by Fomin and Pylyavskyy, arXiv:1210.1888. In particular:
* Calculate SL_3 invariant polynomial for a web.
* Display a web based on the Khovanov-Kuperberg encoding of the web.

Hi Martin, thanks for getting in touch, and thanks for sharing your code.  There isn't a whole lot of overlap with what we have done so far, since we have focussed on actually drawing the web as a planar graph (which is fiddly to do, but nice to have, I think) and calculating the web invariant (which we have made some efforts to do fast, so as to be able to calculate the invariant for reasonably large webs).

I am very much open to advice or suggestions about what should be done about combining this code with yours and/or organizing this code for inclusion into Sage.

I am attaching the current state of the files so people can see them at the Sagedays, even though they are not really in a state for public distribution yet.

InitState is an n-tuple of 0,1, or -1; InitColor is an n-tuple of 1 or -1. (The example input which uses [1,2,3,4] as the InitState doesn't make any sense.) 

Not every pair of n-tuples will work. The example on page 8 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-alg/9712046.pdf is 
InitState=(1,1,0,0,-1,0,-1), InitColor=(1,-1,1,-1,1,1,1).

Let me mention that the code for calculating the invariant performs about as well as using the generic graph-colouring code which exists in Sage, so the calculation of the invariant should be rewritten to use that code.
