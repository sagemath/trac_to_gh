Perhaps even a blurb about variables being references (if it's not to complicated). However, at the very least there should be something in the calculus section(s) to the effect of "If you get a NameError, check to see if you either misspelled something or forgot to define a variable with var(...)"

I think that the section [Some Common Issues With Functions](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_functions.html) in the tutorial explains it quite well. The patch I added specifies an error that is mentioned as a NameError, not just "an error," and is also more specific about how to fix it.

Hello! 

I have two comments about the patch: there is a grammatical error: "an NameError" and I think "NameError" should be codified -- by enclosing it with two backticks. 

So, needs_work. :)

Hello! 

Sorry for not being complete last time. I have one last comment, I am really sorry for doing this:

The description in the patch says: 'at the very least there should be something in the calculus section(s) to the effect of "If you get a NameError?, check to see if you either misspelled something or forgot to define a variable with var(...)"'. 

I think this could be done, by adding a note. Can you please do this, so that there is an explicit place where this is explained? I am also thinking if it might be possible to implement the first suggestion in the description. Hope you'd find an appropriate place to do so. 

Regards, Kannappan.

I feel like these are ... a little dangerous.

First, 

```
are defined to be ``var(...)``
```

Is there a noun missing here?  Or "via", or "exist using"?


```
sage: diff(sin(var('u')), var('u'))
```

I'm a little leery of suggesting people do this.  `var('u')` injects things into the global namespace as well, so this is redundant.  Better is

```
sage: var('u')
diff(...)
```


Also, I suspect you'll need an extra line before the new section

```
.. _section-systems: 
```

to avoid some documentation build error.

I didn't know this happened! That's pretty neat. Why do we have

```
u = var('u')
```

in the tutorial then? Is 

```
var('u')
```

shorthand for u = var('u'), or does it do something a little different?
