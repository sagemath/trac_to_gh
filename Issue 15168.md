Looks great. One comment is that the 'ice' boundary conditions are also called 'domain wall' boundary conditions. I added that to the documentation, and if you are happy with it, you may change to positive review.

One additional comment is that I noticed that if you type in 
SixVertexModel(3,2,boundary_conditions='ice')
it would give you the 3x3 square ice configurations. It would probably be better if it returned [] since there are no 3x2 6V configurations with domain wall boundary conditions, so if you could make that change, that would be great.

And I guess on that note, the predefined boundary conditions 'inward' and 'outward' don't make much sense either, since flow is conserved on interior vertices.

'free' (all None) and 'periodic' (alternating True and False) boundary conditions would be other good predefined boundary conditions that could be added. (Sorry for the multiple comments, I think I'm done now.)

Hey Jessica, I've made the changes you suggested. Back to needs review.

Now the boundary conditions aren't working for me. The 'free' boundary conditions work, but 'ice', 'domain wall', and even some that I just type in just return []. And a bunch of doc tests fail. Does everything still work for you? I don't think I pushed anything to break it.

I had moved some stuff around, but forgotten what should be popped before checking the boundary conditions blah blah blah.

In other words: fixed.
