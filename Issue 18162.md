Assignee: @bhutz

Keywords: projective morphism

When the numerator is a constant, the conversion to .polynomial() conversion is return a different variable than the denominator. This is the expected behavior from the documentation of those functions. So this ticket will change how the conversion is done.

Example that fails


```
A.<z>=AffineSpace(QQ,1)
HA=End(A)
f=HA([1/z^7])
F=f.homogenize(1)
F.automorphism_group()

```

Everything looks good, but I think the ticket example should be added to the documentation as a test or example to demonstrate the fix.
