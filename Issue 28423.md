Because 3 x 3 = 9 and we are at 9.0.beta3 these are three reasons to do the switch... see

No idea how to do that properly. Any volunteer to do the job ?

Some of the involved stuff:

- `SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION`

- `SAGE_PYTHON3`

- `--with-python`

- `WITH_PYTHON`

Changing https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/configure.ac#L395 should be a good start.

ok, I did that. Anything else ?

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-10-27 15:50:32

I think it depends on #25837, as sagenb doesn't work with Python 3.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-10-27 15:59:43

Did you test ? Sagenb is already automatically put aside (i.e. not built) with python3.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-10-27 18:20:31

well, this is OK as an experimental feature, but we do install all the standard packages, normally speaking, and sagenb is standard. Besides, with Python 3 the message on https://github.com/vbraun/ExportSageNB/pull/16/commits
is unclear (it does not say that Sage must be built with Python 2 for sagenb to function)

If a prerequisite for building from source becomes "Python >= 3.6", then we need #28657 as a dependency.

In my opinion, #25837 is a hybrid ticket: one part should be simple — make `sagenb` optional, perhaps with a better error message, as in comment:10. The other part is to add to Jupyter some functionality which `sagenb` has but Jupyter does not. I am willing to sacrifice the second of these goals (for now) in order to make the switch to Python 3.

May I remove the dependency to #25837 ?

I certainly think so.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-10-28 22:23:16

And #28657 doesn't need to be a dependency for this ticket, as long as it remains a blocker for the next release.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-10-28 23:05:55

I tried this and it works: after running `make`, I see

```
configure:7614: checking Python version to install
configure:7631: result: 3
```

how about making sagenb opional on this branch then?

ok, we can turn sagenb to optional here if you prefer.

Please edit and enhance the wiki page about the switch https://wiki.sagemath.org/Python3-Switch

I would have thought that url link with space in them would better be avoided. You created a page `Python3-compatible code`. Am I allowed to fix that? I also open a page for end users who will suffer much more the transition than developers.

Changing status from new to needs_review.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2019-11-01 17:37:32

something else ? We should try to move forward.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-11-01 19:12:34

As I said before, it works for me. Anyone else with feedback?

Builds like a charm on Ubuntu 18.04 running on a i7-6700HQ + 16 GB RAM computer: having merged  this ticket branch in Sage 9.0.beta4 sources (from a fresh git clone + pull develop), running
`MAKE="make -j8" make` yielded a fully working Python3 Sage. In particular `sage -python` gives

```
Python 3.7.3 (default, Nov  4 2019, 17:58:44) 
[GCC 7.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-11-05 19:26:29

Let's proceed with this.

Comment by @mwageringel created at 2019-11-05 22:08:20

This works for me as well on CentOS.

"For now" are dangerous words, though, in particular regarding matrix input and `automatic_names`.  I'm certainly glad that both 3d viewers seem to work in Jupyter now, though I haven't yet built with py3 support.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-11-07 16:20:33

The switch to Python 3 needs to happen. To get these issues fixed, people need to work on them, and if no one is working on them (as seems to be the case), that isn't reason enough to delay the switch to Python 3.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2019-11-14 23:19:23

Resolution: fixed


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-11-18 03:07:03

See #28742 for a followup: after building with Python 2 and then upgrading to a version of Sage including this ticket, the version of Python changes to 3. This causes problems, so we should detect the version mismatch and either keep using Python 2 or abort the `make` process, telling the user what the issue is.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-11-25 22:50:04

Even though `sagenb` is now optional, it is still always installed because it is a dependency for building the documentation. Look at line 4 in the following, from `build/make/deps`:

```
# Building the documentation has many dependencies, because all
# documented modules are imported and because we use matplotlib to
# produce plots.
DOC_DEPENDENCIES = sagelib $(inst_sphinx) $(inst_sagenb) \
	| $(SAGERUNTIME) $(inst_maxima) $(inst_networkx) $(inst_scipy) $(inst_sympy) \
	$(inst_matplotlib) $(inst_pillow) $(inst_mathjax) $(inst_mpmath) \
	$(inst_ipykernel) $(inst_jupyter_client) $(inst_conway_polynomials) \
	$(inst_tachyon) $(inst_jmol) $(inst_thebe) $(inst_ipywidgets) $(inst_typing)
```

Should we create another followup to deal with this? I can do it, but it may take me a few days, because I have other higher priority things I have to do first.

Comment by fbissey created at 2019-11-25 22:52:40

Definitely need a follow up. We disentangled that bit a while ago now. I can take care of it, if that's the only place we need to fix for this.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2019-11-25 22:56:48

It is now #28805.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-11-26 04:39:28

Thanks.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-12-02 05:52:59

Should we delete the file `src/ext/doctest/python3-known-passing.txt` and the corresponding parts of `Makefile`?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-12-02 22:10:26

yes, sure, let's do this.


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2019-12-03 00:22:06

I opened #28835.
