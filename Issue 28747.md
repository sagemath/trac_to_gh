Currently sage's and sage's dependency C++ code is compiled with -std=c++11 unless overridden. This is autoconf macro's fault. So it won't be visible inside vanilla sage for the time being. But it is very important on distros. Also we should note that singular has a copy of "libgfan" based on the same code. There is probably an enforcement of c++11 in singular at the present time but the offending code may be there as well.

Has upstream been contacted?
