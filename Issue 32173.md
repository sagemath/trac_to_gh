Missing closing backquote:


```diff
-        - ``index_set` -- a finite enumerated set indexing the
+        - ``index_set`` -- a finite enumerated set indexing the
```


Maybe add spaces here:


```diff
-                *get_values,**set_values)
+                *get_values, **set_values)
```



```diff
-            ....:         self, '_repr_','delim')
+            ....:         self, '_repr_', 'delim')
```


Single hyphens for list items:


```
-        -- constructing element from an element of the attached classical group
-           (embedded and not embedded)
-        -- constructing element from an element of the attached permutation group
-        -- constructing element from an element of the attached reflection group
+        - constructing element from an element of the attached classical group
+          (embedded and not embedded)
+        - constructing element from an element of the attached permutation group
+        - constructing element from an element of the attached reflection group
```


Suggested rewriting for the `LocalOptions` example:


```
            sage: from sage.combinat.parallelogram_polyomino import LocalOptions
            sage: delim = {'default': 'b',
            ....:          'values': {'b': 'option b', 'p': 'option p'}}
            sage: o = LocalOptions('Name example', delim=delim)
            sage: class Ex:
            ....:     options = o
            ....:     def _repr_b(self):
            ....:         return "b"
            ....:     def _repr_p(self):
            ....:         return "p"
            ....:     def __repr__(self):
            ....:         return self.options._dispatch(self, '_repr_', 'delim')
            ....:
            sage: e = Ex(); e
            b
```
