# Issue 29895: Copy resolvelinks() function from ./src/bin/sage-env to ./sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30132

The `resolvelinks()` function in sage-env was recently updated, but a copy/pasted version is still present in the top-level sage script.

Opening this now so I don't forget to update the version in `./sage`.
