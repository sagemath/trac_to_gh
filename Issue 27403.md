Some PEP8 and other misc small comments:

```diff
-    def Shi(self, data, K=QQ, names=None, m = 1):
+    def Shi(self, data, K=QQ, names=None, m=1):
```

```diff
         The characteristic polynomial is pre-computed using the results of
-         [Ath1996]_ .
+        [Ath1996]_.
```

```diff
         if data in NN:
-            cartan_type = CartanType(["A",data -1])
+            cartan_type = CartanType(['A', data-1])
```

```diff
         for a in PR:
             for const in range(-m+1,m+1):
-                hyperplanes.append(sum(a[j]*x[j] for j in range(d
-                ))-const)
+                hyperplanes.append(sum(a[j]*x[j] for j in range(d))-const)
```
(the 80 char/line is much more of a guideline and you should never sacrifice readability for it IMO).

```diff
-        charpoly = (x**(d-n))*(x-m*h)**n
+        charpoly = x**(d-n) * (x - m*h)**n
```

It would also be nice to remove those added blanklines at the end of the file.

It looks like the bot is happy. I have fixed the small things pointed by Travis. 

Eleni wrote the initial code and I helped with the design and details. The code extends the previous functionalities of the function. The previous usage is still valid and works exactly the same (we haven't changed those tests) and now we have more options (with Cartan types and m parameter), all documented. Eleni checked the math quite carefully. 

So Travis, I let you have a look and hopefully, we can have a positive review soon.

- avoid using unicode "â€“" in the references, just use - (minus)

- in the doctests, write `h = hyperplane`, namely add space around =

- do not repeat the "EXAMPLES::"

otherwise, looks good
