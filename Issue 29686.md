The script `sage-cython` has been deprecated for about 18 months, so let's remove it.

This script has a good chance of being used in user package install scripts. So I would suggest to do the removal a little later...

What about this part, at least:

```diff
diff --git a/build/bin/sage-site b/build/bin/sage-site
index 6daa094..8de96ce 100755
--- a/build/bin/sage-site
+++ b/build/bin/sage-site
@@ -200,7 +200,7 @@ fi
 
 if [ "$1" = "-cython" -o "$1" = '--cython' -o "$1" = '-pyrex' -o "$1" = "--pyrex" ]; then
     shift
-    exec sage-cython "$@"
+    exec cython "$@"
 fi
 
 if [ "$1" = '-gap' -o "$1" = '--gap' ]; then
```

plus maybe a deprecation warning whenever `sage-cython` is called?
