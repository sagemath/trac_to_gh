Green bot, please review.

Before

```
sage: %timeit g = graphs.HyperStarGraph(6,3)
215 µs ± 28 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
```

With this ticket

```
sage: %timeit g = graphs.HyperStarGraph(6,3)
123 µs ± 3.08 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
```
