```
var('beta,N_0,V')
V = 1/2
N = 50
solve(exp(-beta*N_0)*(1/beta*N_0) + 1 - 1/(beta*N_0) - V, beta, to_poly_solve='force')
```

returns the empty solution set, but 

```
var('beta,N_0,V')
V = 1/2
N = 50
solve(exp(-beta*N_0)*(1/beta*N_0) + 1 - 1/(beta*N_0) - V, beta, to_poly_solve=True)
```

gives a traceback

My guess is that somehow whatever list of solutions is gotten isn't subdivided in the way expected here.  We should at the very least catch this, if not fix it completely.
