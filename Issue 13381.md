# Issue 13381: "full_output.txt" doesn't update on notebook

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dox

Original creation time: 2012-10-08 15:21:30

Assignee: dox

Keywords: notebook, full_output, update

If after running a command with a huge output, one changes the command line and rerun, the output file is not updated.

I found this behaviour trying to construct a representation of the Clifford Algebra in 6-dimensions, as tensor_product of Clifford Algebras in 2-dimensions.

Are you sure it doesn't update? Are you requesting an explicit reload from your browser? As an example:
If I do

```
for i in range(1000):
    print i
```

in the notebook and click `full_output.txt` I get the output as requested (in a new tab).

If I now change the same cell:

```diff
 for i in range(1000):
-    print i
+    print i^2
```

the tab `full_output.txt` doesn't change when I use firefox. This is because newer versions of Firefox, when asked to open a URL that is already open in some tab or window, will just change to that tab/window; it does not reload the content. Once I explicitly ask to reload that file, I do get the updated output.

The above behaviour is not a bug in Sage. It's an issue with Firefox and it's probably considered a feature. There may be a setting in `about:config` to influence this behaviour. Probably other browsers have similar behaviour.

If your observations do not agree with what is described above, please describe them.

Well, then maybe see #14633, since there were _three_ tickets that were opened about this same issue?  I'll put your comments there and the relevant upstream ticket.
