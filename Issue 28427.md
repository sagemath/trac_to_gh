# Issue 28427: FPyLLL Strategies inside SageMath binaries

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28664

Original creator: malb

Original creation time: 2019-10-28 11:55:01

Doing:


```
curl -O https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.sagemath.org/linux/64bit/sage-8.8-Debian_GNU_Linux_8-x86_64.tar.bz2
unp sage-8.8-Debian_GNU_Linux_8-x86_64.tar.bz2
./SageMath/sage   
```


Then I get


```python
sage:  from fpylll import *
sage: BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY
'/home/malb/software/SageMath/local/share/fplll/strategieparse error - unpreprocessing_blpruning_parameteError: gptr == nullpoints/default.json'
```


The output should be a filename but it's not. A build from source doesn't have that problem.

Seems a precompiled Sage binary also cannot load strategy files stored elsewhere, so something is really broken there:


```python
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SageMath version 8.9, Release Date: 2019-09-29                     │
│ Using Python 2.7.15. Type "help()" for help.                       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
sage: from fpylll import *
sage: BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY_PATH
'/bulk/home/malb/software/SageMath/local/share/fplll/strategieparse error - unpreprocessing_blpruning_parameteError: gptr == nulls'
sage: BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY
'/bulk/home/malb/software/SageMath/local/share/fplll/strategieparse error - unpreprocessing_blpruning_parameteError: gptr == nulls/default.json'
sage: print load_strategies_json("/home/malb/projects/lattices/fplll/strategies/default.json")[60]
Strategy< 60, (), 1.00-1.00>
```


The above should print `Strategy< 60, (40), 0.29-0.50>`

See https://github.com/fplll/fpylll/issues/159

Any ideas?

This looks like a bug in binary-pkg which looks for `\0` character at the end of the path, but the path being stored in a C++ string, the NULL character does not exist at the end.

Adding -std=c++11 to CXXFLAGS forces the C++ compiler to enforce C++11 which enforces that std::string terminate with `\0` in the internal buffer.

From my limited testing, this fixes the issue.

Oh, thanks!

I'm not clear though on where `-std=c++11` is missing, FPLLL is currently being compiled with:

```
AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX([11],[noext],[mandatory])
```


which should set `-std=c++11`. But from my local testing it doesn't seem to (?)

File `m4/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.m4` in fplll repo is old. Updating to the latest version fixes the issue.

`@`malb, the updated macro at https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/394/files forces the `-std=c++11`. New versions of gcc support some C++11 features without the flag, but does not enforce some C++11 features like `\0` at the end of the string buffer. This default checking is removed in https://github.com/fplll/fplll/pull/394/files#diff-38b7f4802a0916ba0fab7e320746bfdbL62-L69

Thank you! I'll wait for the fallout of the 5.3.0 release for a bit and then will cut a new release 5.3.1 with that fix in.


---

Comment by malb created at 2019-12-14 18:02:48

Fixed in FPLLL 5.3.1


---

Comment by malb created at 2019-12-15 14:28:07

See #28886 for updates of FP(y)LLL which should fix this issue.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

- #28886, merged in Sage 9.1.beta1, upgraded to FPLLL 5.3.2 and FPyLLL 0.5.1.dev.
- #30021, merged in Sage 9.2.beta4, upgraded to FPLLL 5.3.3.

On Debian 10 buster, after downloading Sage 9.1 as follows:

```
$ SAGE_VERSION=9.1
$ DEBIAN_VERSION=`source /etc/os-release ; echo $VERSION_ID`
$ MIRROR=https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.sagemath.org/linux/64bit
$ TARBALL=sage-$SAGE_VERSION-Debian_GNU_Linux_$DEBIAN_VERSION-x86_64.tar.bz2
$ curl -O $MIRROR/$TARBALL
$ tar xf $TARBALL
```

and launching Sage as follows:

```
$ ./SageMath/sage -q
```

running the following two commands:

```
sage: from fpylll import *
sage: BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY
```

still gives the same incorrect result:

```
'/.../local/share/fplll/strategieparse error - unpreprocessing_blpruning_parameteError: gptr == nullpointer.'
```


while with Sage built from source on the same machine:

```
sage: from fpylll import *
sage: BKZ.DEFAULT_STRATEGY
b'/.../local/share/fplll/strategies/default.json'
```


So even after #28886 Sage built from source gets this right
while Sage binaries don't.

What causes this difference between the buildbot-produced binaries
and Sage built from source?


---

Comment by isuruf created at 2020-09-16 01:12:33

Is fplll built with C++11 in the Sage 9.1 binaries?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-05-10 17:42:09

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.

Changing status from new to needs_review.
