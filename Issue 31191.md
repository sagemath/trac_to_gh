This change is good:

```diff
-            x = gens_gap[0]**0
+            x = A.one()
```

Optionally, the loop that follows could be inlined:

```diff
-            x = A.one()
-            for i in range(len(exp)):
-                x *= gens_gap[i]**(exp[i] % orders[i])
-            x = x.gap()
+            x = prod((g**(e % o) for g, e, o in zip(gens_gap, exp, orders)),
+                     A.one()).gap()
```

It might be faster but I did not check. That could be a separate ticket.

The patchbot has a pyflakes error complaining that `A` is undefined.

Please fix:

```diff
-            x = A.one()
+            x = self.one()
```
