These missing files do not impact the part of LinBox used in Sage. The compilation failure is in the test-suite.
I can release v1.6.3 of LinBox very shortly if you think it should be fixed for the next sage release. 
I guess, it will happen in another ticket as this one is now closed.

Yes, I should have said it is in the test suite. I don't know, Volker may choose to re-open if it causes troubles with bots running `spkg-check` on packages.

I pushed a fix to the second bug (size_t vs unsigned long in calling `LinBox::rank`). I'm still waiting for a build of sage on a 32 bit ubuntu to finish, to confirm that the bug is no longer there.

As for the first bug, do you confirm that it only shows up in Debian 10 ?
I have no clue what is going on there, and can not reproduce it as I don't have a 32 bit Debian at hand.

This part of givaro's code is not used in Sage, so an easy fix is to comment out line 26 of `givaro/src/kernel/ring/modular.h`.

I don't think the error is about EBX, you are free to use it in inline asm as long as you restore it (at least on gcc >=5 and as long as you don't make function calls / use the PLT).

I haven't tried to figure out which of the many inline asm implementations is selected but various do specify constraints `"=&r" (sl)` which maybe be inconsistent (presumably meaning unsatisfyable).

I pushed a patch to givaro, which basically changes the name on givaro's side of all macros which definition where in conflict between flint (longlong.h) and givaro (reclonglong.h) by prefixing them with `recint_`.

This change solves the problem on the 32bit ubuntu machine where I could reproduce the bug.

I'd say `python_xerbla.c` is always compiled. This is from `core/src/common/setupy.py`

```
    blas_info = get_info('blas_opt', 0)
    if blas_info and ('HAVE_CBLAS', None) in blas_info.get('define_macros', []):
        extra_info = blas_info
        # These files are also in MANIFEST.in so that they are always in
        # the source distribution independently of HAVE_CBLAS.
        common_src.extend([join('src', 'common', 'cblasfuncs.c'),
                           join('src', 'common', 'python_xerbla.c'),
                          ])
        if uses_accelerate_framework(blas_info):
            common_src.extend(get_sgemv_fix())
    else:
        extra_info = {}
```
For those who don't know, numpy's build system sets `-DHAVE_CBLAS=NONE` when blas/lapack is found :) When no blas/lapack is provided found, `HAVE_CBLAS` is undefined.

The `xerbla_` symbol is inserted in `numpy/core/_multiarray_umath.so`. But from experience the scipy call that can give the differing messages never use that and must load a version from blas/lapack otherwise we would never see this difference.
