I'll release the 3 libraries soon, but I meant to check that they could be smoothly updating into sage before hand, therefore this ticket proposes to apply the rc0 versions temporarily. Once everything is in order, I'll cut the releases, and checksums accordingly in this branch.

Is someone who has already looked at it willing to set this to a positive review? Otherwise I will doublecheck things on my (ubuntu) machine and then flip it positive.

These missing files do not impact the part of LinBox used in Sage. The compilation failure is in the test-suite.
I can release v1.6.3 of LinBox very shortly if you think it should be fixed for the next sage release. 
I guess, it will happen in another ticket as this one is now closed.

Yes, I should have said it is in the test suite. I don't know, Volker may choose to re-open if it causes troubles with bots running `spkg-check` on packages.

I just released new minor revisions of linbox (1.6.3) fflas-ffpack (2.4.1) and givaro (4.1.1), 
* taking into account the above problems and fixing other minor issues such as 
* including the README.md in the distro, 
* fixing fflas-ffpack API for parallel calls from [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) (in preparation of #27444).
I updated the current branch and ticket accordingly, and it is now again ready for review.

I don't think the error is about EBX, you are free to use it in inline asm as long as you restore it (at least on gcc >=5 and as long as you don't make function calls / use the PLT).

I haven't tried to figure out which of the many inline asm implementations is selected but various do specify constraints `"=&r" (sl)` which maybe be inconsistent (presumably meaning unsatisfyable).

Ok, I finally got some time to get back to this problem. I doubt the fix above will work (I tried on a 32bit box and it still fails, as recint is also included in fflas-ffpack).

I will fix givaro's `reclonglong.h` so that it undefs the symbols conflicting with flint and redefines them in its own way.

I pushed a patch to givaro, which basically changes the name on givaro's side of all macros which definition where in conflict between flint (longlong.h) and givaro (reclonglong.h) by prefixing them with `recint_`.

This change solves the problem on the 32bit ubuntu machine where I could reproduce the bug.

I'd say `python_xerbla.c` is always compiled. This is from `core/src/common/setupy.py`

```
    blas_info = get_info('blas_opt', 0)
    if blas_info and ('HAVE_CBLAS', None) in blas_info.get('define_macros', []):
        extra_info = blas_info
        # These files are also in MANIFEST.in so that they are always in
        # the source distribution independently of HAVE_CBLAS.
        common_src.extend([join('src', 'common', 'cblasfuncs.c'),
                           join('src', 'common', 'python_xerbla.c'),
                          ])
        if uses_accelerate_framework(blas_info):
            common_src.extend(get_sgemv_fix())
    else:
        extra_info = {}
```
For those who don't know, numpy's build system sets `-DHAVE_CBLAS=NONE` when blas/lapack is found :) When no blas/lapack is provided found, `HAVE_CBLAS` is undefined.

The `xerbla_` symbol is inserted in `numpy/core/_multiarray_umath.so`. But from experience the scipy call that can give the differing messages never use that and must load a version from blas/lapack otherwise we would never see this difference.
