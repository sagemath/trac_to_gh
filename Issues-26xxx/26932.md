I'll release the 3 libraries soon, but I meant to check that they could be smoothly updating into sage before hand, therefore this ticket proposes to apply the rc0 versions temporarily. Once everything is in order, I'll cut the releases, and checksums accordingly in this branch.

<a id='comment:17'></a>I have just released the 3 libraries and updated the sage bindings accordingly.
Sage test suite passes on my box. The ticket is ready for review.
I may post later on some benchmarks advertising the performance gain from this update.

<a id='comment:61'></a>Yes, I get the error only on Debian 10 32-bit. Thats gcc 8.3.0. My guess would be that all sufficiently new compiler versions fail. The next oldest 32-bit machine is Ubuntu 18 / gcc 7.3.0 and that passes.

I don't think the error is about EBX, you are free to use it in inline asm as long as you restore it (at least on gcc >=5 and as long as you don't make function calls / use the PLT).

I haven't tried to figure out which of the many inline asm implementations is selected but various do specify constraints `"=&r" (sl)` which maybe be inconsistent (presumably meaning unsatisfyable).

After some investigation, in my case this turned out to be caused by linking fflas-ffpack with --as-needed - apparently this strips a bit too many linked libs. I started linking with --as-needed with the 2.4.0 update so that made me think it was related to the upgrade.

For those who don't know, numpy's build system sets `-DHAVE_CBLAS=NONE` when blas/lapack is found :) When no blas/lapack is provided found, `HAVE_CBLAS` is undefined.

The `xerbla_` symbol is inserted in `numpy/core/_multiarray_umath.so`. But from experience the scipy call that can give the differing messages never use that and must load a version from blas/lapack otherwise we would never see this difference.
