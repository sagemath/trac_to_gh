LGTM overall. Some comments:

- <code>\`R\`</code> -> <code>\`\`R\`\`</code> in `change_ring()`.
- Since you're adding a `degree_on_basis`, you should put it into the category of graded (magmatic) algebras with basis.
- In the `_element_constructor_`, you will never have the case `P is self` as the coercion framework would step in before it gets to that point. Why are you wrapping the whole thing in a `try-except`? The only thing you need is the `P = x.parent()`.
- When you are using `monomial_coefficients()`, you should pass `copy=False` for speed.
- In `_coerce_map_from_`, is there a reason why it just is not a sequence of `and`'s?
- We want the construction functors to be hashable, correct? So you will need a `__hash__` for Python3, right?
