This output looks unnatural:

```
sage: 1e100.str(digits=1)
'1.e100'
```
The `.` is superfluous because the `e` already indicates that this is a floating point number. Compare also with how Python prints floats:

```
sage: float(1e100)
1e+100
```

We also simplify the implementation of `str()`, factoring out the sign and replacing the complicated branches for the non-scientific case by 3 easy to understand cases.

This should be made more precise, e.g. <code>When \`\`digits!\`\` is at least one, ...</code> and mentioned up where the option `digits` is introduced.
