I am very unsure about how to best pass the colour or decoration yet.  Comments welcome.

is debatable, as, for example, #18302 exhibits some of the problems with having very many interfaces.  I also vaguely remember problems with viewing vs. plotting of crystals.

Another minor point is that it will be slightly surprising that `plot` picks out `StandardTableau`, and there are no `plot` methods for the other tableaux classes.  For these I guess one might want to highlight other things (for example, the jeu de taquin path, or something we cannot think of today), which may clash with the option.

If you insist on `plot` (joke: why is this method inconsistent with `m = matrix([This is the Trac macro *1,2* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2-macro)); m.plot()`?), please at least make it respect the `convention` option.

(In case you like my idea, feel free to develop it further, I have no time and energy for another ticket currently, sorry about that.)

I did correctly read what you wrote. Another interface means another option.

#18302 is not a valid comparisons for a few different reasons in that `show` is doing the *exact* same as another option, it is not confusing with the other "natural" option (i.e., not have show) and it is a debate over having one name, and `show` also does provide some behavior that is not available in other ways.

`view()` versus `plot()` for crystals has to do with implemented/developed functionality. I would be a +1 for adding better `plot()` for crystals. The problem with that is that most of the vertices don't have a `plot`, so it doesn't look as nice.

> Another minor point is that it will be slightly surprising that `plot` picks out `StandardTableau`, and there are no `plot` methods for the other tableaux classes.

It is there for any `Tableau`. Read the code. We can always change the option later if we come to a clash, but IMO this abstract concept of a possible clash argument is a fallacy.

+1 for having `plot` respect `convention`; that is a good point.
