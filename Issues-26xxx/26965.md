Using `sdh_install` to install a symlink whose target is not yet valid (e.g. is a path to a file that will be installed to `$SAGE_LOCAL` but is not yet installed) then it will fail, since the check `test -e` in `sdh_install` dereferences symlinks.

Marking critical since this fix is needed for #26856.
