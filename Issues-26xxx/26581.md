Done in this ticket:
- add parameter `sort` to `blocks_and_cut_vertices` (set to `False` by default). The default algorithm, `Tarjan_Boost` don't sort vertices, but the `Tarjan_Sage` algorithm sorts vertices in each block as well as the list of cut_vertices. We prevent this by default.
  An alternative is to simply remove the sortings...

- PEP8 cleaning up to method `blocks_and_cuts_tree`.
