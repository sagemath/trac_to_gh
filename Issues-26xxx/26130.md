While trying to port the nix build (and its dependencies) to darwin, `@`jbaum98 [discovered](https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/issues/173) that the fflas-ffpack tests are failing on darwin when using openblas. They don't fail on linux using openblas and they don't fail on darwin using another blas.

Trying to figure out if that is a nix issue or a fflas-ffpack / openblas issue, I compared our build with the sage spkg. I noticed that sage is not even running the fflas_ffpack tests. So maybe some issues with darwin have gone unnoticed.

I even get one test failure on linux:

```

On Darwin i get a fail with openblas too

```
$ sage -f -c fflas_ffpack
...
[fflas_ffpack-2.3.2] PASS: test-ftrmm
[fflas_ffpack-2.3.2] FAIL: test-fgemm-check
[fflas_ffpack-2.3.2] PASS: test-permutations
...
```

It look like it's a fflas-ffpack / openblas issue.

`@`jbaum98 had more test failures there, but this is one of them and he isn't responding. Maybe they have a common cause.
