This fixes compilation errors with clang 6.0.1

**Tarball** (created using spkg-src):
http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/matplotlib-2.2.3.tar.bz2

We also add a patch (taken from upstream) to fix deprecation warnings with recent numpy versions. This is needed for #27000.

Our last upgrade was to matplotlib 2.2.2 in #25702.

Note that matplotlib 3.x.y versions require Python 3.

Building `cvxopt` with `SAGE_CHECK="yes"` still fails when running headless (#24657). Not sure if that's strictly a `cvxopt` or a `matplotlib` issue.

I don't understand what numpy upgrade that might cause anything to matplotlib is meant.
Things still seem to work here with Sage 8.7.beta1.

I don't think it's a good idea to try to backport stuff just to hopefully fix bugs we don't see yet.

I mean the numpy upgrade to 1.16.0 at #27000.

> I don't think it's a good idea to try to backport stuff just to hopefully fix bugs we don't see yet.

Why not? If this issue is blocking #27000, it should be addressed.

In fact, I don't get why you need to do anything with isscalar:

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: np.version.version
'1.16.0'
sage: np.isscalar(1)
True
```

The problem is in asscalar!

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: np.version.version
'1.16.0'
sage: np.asscalar(np.array([24]))
