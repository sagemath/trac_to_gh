Keywords: upgrade, matplotlib

This fixes compilation errors with clang 6.0.1

**Tarball** (created using spkg-src):
http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/matplotlib-2.2.3.tar.bz2

We also add a patch (taken from upstream) to fix deprecation warnings with recent numpy versions. This is needed for #27000.

Our last upgrade was to matplotlib 2.2.2 in #25702.

Note that matplotlib 3.x.y versions require Python 3.

I mean the numpy upgrade to 1.16.0 at #27000.

Why not? If this issue is blocking #27000, it should be addressed.
