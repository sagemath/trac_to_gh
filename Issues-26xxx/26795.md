(Add more leaks here. But not the one that is taken care in #26794)

First one, handled at #26796

```
def bad8(n):
    from sage.graphs.independent_sets import IndependentSets
    G = Graph(2)
    for i in range(n):
        x = [0] in IndependentSets(G)
        if i % 10000 == 0:
            print get_memory_usage()

bad8(100000)
```

Second, in #26806: Propably `_is_relaxation()` in `src/sage/matroids/basis_matroid.pyx`, `bitset_init` for `bb_comp` and `b2`, but no corresponding `bitset_free`.

Third: Also `dimension()` of posets seems to have a leak. Root cause might be something already corrected.

More in comments.

Trying to understand... So every call to `iter()` will create kind of "implicit object" by calling `__iter__()` that by design of `yield` statement will create a state for an iterator. But because it is "implicit", there can no explicit destructor? Then the iterator must add a back-reference to some class variable, I guess. Something like

```
class Foo:
    sometype refs
    def __init__():
        refs = []
    def __iter__():
        x = reserve_memory()
        refs.append(x)
        . . .
    def __dealloc__():
        for x in refs:
            release_memory(x)
```

<a id='comment:12'>Comment 12:</a>
I think the poset thing is fixed by #26796.

But the patch I just posted is surely needed - you can see it fixes the following leak:

```
sage: def bad99(n):
....:     from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
....:     for i in range(n):
....:         p = get_solver(solver = "GLPK")
....:         p.add_linear_constraints(5, 0, None)
....:         p.add_col(range(5), range(5))

regarding Poset dimension. It seems it's already a problem in the beginning of the function:

```python
import gc
from sage.graphs.comparability import greedy_is_comparability as is_comparability
i = 0

    i += 1
    _ = is_comparability(P._hasse_diagram.transitive_closure().to_undirected().complement())

If I remove the call to `is_comparability()` the problem is gone here.

By the way, (with `_ = ...` present) do you notice that it stabilises approximately half-way, stops growing? Feels like an internal cache somewhere fills in, and then it's full, so no extra growth...
