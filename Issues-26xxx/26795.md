(Add more leaks here. But not the one that is taken care in #26794)

First one, handled at #26796

```
def bad8(n):
    from sage.graphs.independent_sets import IndependentSets
    G = Graph(2)
    for i in range(n):
        x = [0] in IndependentSets(G)
        if i % 10000 == 0:
            print get_memory_usage()

bad8(100000)
```

Second, in #26806: Propably `_is_relaxation()` in `src/sage/matroids/basis_matroid.pyx`, `bitset_init` for `bb_comp` and `b2`, but no corresponding `bitset_free`.

Third: Also `dimension()` of posets seems to have a leak. Root cause might be something already corrected.

More in comments.

class Foo:
    sometype refs
    def __init__():
        refs = []
    def __iter__():
        x = reserve_memory()
        refs.append(x)
        . . .
    def __dealloc__():
        for x in refs:
            release_memory(x)
```

I think the poset thing is fixed by #26796.

But the patch I just posted is surely needed - you can see it fixes the following leak:

```
sage: def bad99(n):
....:     from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
