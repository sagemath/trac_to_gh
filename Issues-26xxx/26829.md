Everything tentatively looks good to me. Not sure why most recent patchbots are having build errors (builds and tests fine of this machine), will run patchbot on a different machine soon to double check.

Do we need this to explicitly be a list:

```diff
-    V = G.vertices()
+    V = list(G)
 
     # All vertices at different positions
     for v in V:
```
In particular, could we just do

```diff
-    V = G.vertices()
 
     # All vertices at different positions
-    for v in V:
+    for v in G:
```
