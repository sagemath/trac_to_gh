Here we improve the documentation and doctests of methods `degree`, `average_degree`, `degree_histogram`, `degree_iterator`, `degree_sequence`, `is_regular`.

In particular, we make it clear that a call to `.degree()` returns a list of the degrees of vertex degrees in the order of `list(G)` and not of `.vertices()`.
