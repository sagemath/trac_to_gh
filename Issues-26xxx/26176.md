In Debian's setup most `SageKernelSpec` doctests fail because Sage isn't installed in the final location when the doctest run and therefore `_mkdirs()` fails as it can't write to `/usr/share`.

In any case, `setup.py` installs into `install_data` but the doctests don't run there. We could probably just have the tests run there as well but also much of the tests that perform writes don't work there and are therefore disabled. I can see why the tests are the way they are but I don't think it's worth it. I think it's easier for packagers and good enough for [SageMath](SageMath) to just run all the tests in temporary places.
