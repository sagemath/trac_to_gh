For some reason, using (our redefined version of) `\LaTeX` in math mode gives this error. If I take the LaTeX file `combinat.tex` and comment out `\usepackage{babel}` and various lines starting `\addto\captionsenglish{...` then the build succeeds.

There is no good reason. Either people don't know how to use LaTeX properly, or they think that in reST, all LaTeX commands need to be enclosed in backquotes, or they just copied what someone else had done.

I think this is a minimal example:

```
\documentclass[english]{article}
\usepackage{babel}
\usepackage{textcomp}

\let\textLaTeX\LaTeX
\renewcommand*{\LaTeX}{\hbox{\textLaTeX}}

\begin{document}

Or it can be rendered with \(\LaTeX\).  This requires the right additions to a
standard \(\mbox{\rm\TeX}\) installation.

\end{document}
```
I need both the `babel` and `textcomp` packages to get the error.

One bad reason is because if you just use `\LaTeX then some text`, when you run pdflatex, you get no space between `\LaTeX` and `then`: you should do something like `\LaTeX{} then some text`.

Edit: although the curly brackets are not necessary when using Sphinx. Edit: only because Sphinx removes the backslash and declines to typeset "\LaTeX".

Okay, so here is the problem:

```
\usepackage{babel}
\usepackage{textcomp}
\let\textLaTeX\LaTeX
\renewcommand*{\LaTeX}{\hbox{\textLaTeX}}
```
If I include the first two lines, the last line has no effect: I can't redefine the macro `\LaTeX`. I tested this with:

```
\documentclass[english]{article}
\usepackage{babel}
\usepackage{textcomp}
\renewcommand*{\LaTeX}{hello}
\begin{document}

Testing: \LaTeX

\end{document}
```
As long as I include both `babel` and `textcomp`, then this does not produce "Testing: hello", but rather "Testing: LaTeX" (nicely typeset). A bug in LaTeX?

Ideally we would not use `\LaTeX` in math mode, but I don't know how to do that in Sphinx.

    "body": "<a id='comment:11'>Comment 11:</a>\nAnother approach: stop using `\\LaTeX` in math mode and instead do some Sphinx acrobatics. For example, we can tell Sphinx that in latex-mode, to replace |bs| with a backslash and to replace |braces| with `{}`, and then `|bs|\\ LaTeX\\ |braces|` will get converted to `\\LaTeX{}` by the latex builder, and to `LaTeX` by other builders.\n\nThis works because in reST, `|text|` defines a string to be substituted. The string `\"\\ \"` means to suppress a space, so `\"\\ \"` gets omitted by all builders.

<a id='comment:11'>Comment 11:</a>
Another approach: stop using `\LaTeX` in math mode and instead do some Sphinx acrobatics. For example, we can tell Sphinx that in latex-mode, to replace |bs| with a backslash and to replace |braces| with `{}`, and then `|bs|\ LaTeX\ |braces|` will get converted to `\LaTeX{}` by the latex builder, and to `LaTeX` by other builders.

This works because in reST, `|text|` defines a string to be substituted. The string `"\ "` means to suppress a space, so `"\ "` gets omitted by all builders. This is necessary for Sphinx to know which substitution to try; if you just had `|bs|LaTeX|braces|`, then it could look for the substitution `|LaTeX|`.

One way to accomplish this: change the main `conf.py` as follows:

```diff

Then users would just use "\LaTeX" in docstrings. The function `process_latex_macro` would replace this with `|bs|\ LaTeX\ |braces|`, and the substitution definitions say that in latex-mode, change |bs| to a backslash, etc. In any mode except latex, ignore |bs|.

I should probably try some timings, building the reference manual with and without this overhead. I think it will be a small change compared to how long it takes to build the documentation. If we're really concerned about this, we can combine several of the functions that process docstrings into one, so that each docstring is processed just once instead of multiple times.
