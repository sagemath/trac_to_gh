For some reason, using (our redefined version of) `\LaTeX` in math mode gives this error. If I take the LaTeX file `combinat.tex` and comment out `\usepackage{babel}` and various lines starting `\addto\captionsenglish{...` then the build succeeds.

One bad reason is because if you just use `\LaTeX then some text`, when you run pdflatex, you get no space between `\LaTeX` and `then`: you should do something like `\LaTeX{} then some text`.

Edit: although the curly brackets are not necessary when using Sphinx. Edit: only because Sphinx removes the backslash and declines to typeset "\LaTeX".

Ideally we would not use `\LaTeX` in math mode, but I don't know how to do that in Sphinx.

Then users would just use "\LaTeX" in docstrings. The function `process_latex_macro` would replace this with `|bs|\ LaTeX\ |braces|`, and the substitution definitions say that in latex-mode, change |bs| to a backslash, etc. In any mode except latex, ignore |bs|.

So more complicated at the backend, but a little cleaner for docstring authors. (It also means that current uses of ``\LaTeX`` have to be changed to just `\LaTeX`, but there aren't that many instances of this.)

What about overhead? Doesn't the use of `process_latex_macro` require that every docstring be parsed?
