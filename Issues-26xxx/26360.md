Arb 2.15.1 is out and the upgrade breaks a lot (~200) doctests with changes that are not actually failures. Nearly all the changes are minor differences in the accuracy of the radius. As previously discussed in #25966, I think we should fix this once and for all. The tests are brittle and break with more or less every arb upgrade. All those "failures" distract from the actual failures. It makes arb upgrades painful and is a burden on distributions.

I suspect the solution here (lots of `...`) will be controversial. I don't like it very much myself. But I think it is better than the status quo. What we really want are different tolerances for the "mid" and the "radius". I don't know if that is possible in the doctesting framework without explicitly testing for `.mid()` and `.radius()` in different tests each time. We may even want to test the `.accuracy()` instead of the radius.

I'm okay with it, but I'd like to see what Jeroen says since he insisted for exact doctests back then.

> What we really want are different tolerances for the "mid" and the "radius".


Is that really necessary? If you use absolute tolerances, having the same tolerance for the center and the radius isn't too bad.

Something like what Fredrik suggests would be better, of course. Since arb provides a way to parse strings of the form `[mid +/- rad]`, it is perhaps doable. (I'm not volunteering, though...)

Jeroen, do you still insist on exact doctests here?

That might also a (while not pretty) workable solution.

Is the doctesting framework even that flexible?

Did you ever try this?  I don't really see it as "pretty" or not "pretty".  An `# abs tol` will apply to both values, but we really only care about it in this case for the radius.  Technically it would be applied to the mid too but it doesn't matter either way for the present purpose.
