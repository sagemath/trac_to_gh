Issue raised on https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43496/why-cant-i-find-the-spectral-radius-of-a-tree/

The following instruction will never end

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(1,3)
sage: g.spectral_radius()
```

Adding a print in the while loop to get `e_max`, `e_min`, `c_prec`, `e_max-e_min`, `e_max * c_prec`, we get 

```
sage: g.spectral_radius()
3.0 1.0 1e-10 2.0 3e-10
3.0 1.0 1e-10 2.0 3e-10
3.0 1.0 1e-10 2.0 3e-10
...
```
and its the same for every tree. It's working well if the graph has a single edge, but for the path graph of order 3, we already get the infinite loop.

<a id='comment:4'></a>More precisely, here is the problem. Iterating the incidence matrix gets you into a cycle of length two

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(1,3)
sage: A = g.adjacency_matrix().change_ring(RDF)
sage: v = vector([1,2,3,4])
sage: v = A*v; v/= v.norm(); v

sage: v = A*v; v/= v.norm(); v
(0.9819805060619656, 0.10910894511799618, 0.10910894511799618, 0.10910894511799618)

```
But with `A^2` everything is fine

```
sage: w = A**2 * v
sage: [w[i] / v[i] for i in range(4)]
[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]
```
(and the eigenvalue is indeed sqrt(3) for the initial graph).

It's certainly because noone asked for this feature yet? 

We can move the method to `generic_graph.py`. The part that tests bipartiteness is the same. However, we must update the method for finding a cycle when the digraph is not bipartite as shortest path methods care about orientation.

- `while s is not None:` -> `while s:`
- `u_to_root` -> `v_to_root` (you start from v)
- before the loop `while u_to_root and w_to_root and u_to_root[-1] == w_to_root[-1]` you could add a comment like `# Search for the nearest common ancestor of v and w`. No obligation.

- You must add special case for the graph with a single vertex and no edge (don't know the expected result).
