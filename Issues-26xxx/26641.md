Since a while, sagenb is not supposed to contain a bundled mathjax. In particular, the [github repo](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb) of sagenb does not contain mathjax.

Mysteriously, the sagenb packaged in #26499 **does** contain mathjax, but it's not at all clear where this comes from.

So this ticket fixes the packaging procedure of SageNB and makes a new tarball from essentially the same sources.

**Tarball**: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/releases/download/1.1.1/sagenb-1.1.1.tar.bz2

Depends on #26642

The problem is not in the sagenb repo, it's in the **packaging** of the sagenb repo. So in order to make sure that this doesn't happen again, it would be good to know how you created the sagenb package on #26499.

I will release sagenb-1.1.1 from essentially the same sources as 1.1.0, packaged from a clean checkout of the sagenb repo, using the `dist.sh` script.

No, I don't have a directory I packaged 1.1.0 in, anymore.

Can't one add an appropriate call to `git clean` to `./dist.sh` to avoid such a mess in the future?
