I made a bunch of changes to try to improve the situation overall.

I did the same changes for the modn sparse matrices.

I also implemented the same thing for sparse integer matrices, which was using the default multiplication before:

```
sage: M = matrix([[0]*i+[1]+[0]*(50-i) for i in range(51)], sparse=True)
sage: type(M)
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_sparse.Matrix_integer_sparse'>
sage: %timeit M * M
The slowest run took 7.12 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 5: 75.2 µs per loop
sage: M = matrix([[0]*i+[1]+[0]*(100-i) for i in range(101)], sparse=True)
sage: %timeit M * M
The slowest run took 5.40 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000 loops, best of 5: 248 µs per loop
```
versus before:

```
sage: M = matrix([[0]*i+[1]+[0]*(50-i) for i in range(51)], sparse=True)
sage: type(M)
<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_sparse.Matrix_integer_sparse'>
sage: %timeit M * M
10000 loops, best of 5: 99.2 µs per loop
sage: M = matrix([[0]*i+[1]+[0]*(100-i) for i in range(101)], sparse=True)
sage: %timeit M * M
1000 loops, best of 5: 318 µs per loop
```

Finally, I did some micro improvements to the generic spare multiplication algorithm.
