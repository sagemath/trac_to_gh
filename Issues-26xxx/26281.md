As we found out in #24919 (see [#24919 comment:63](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/24919#comment:63)) the `curl-config` program that comes with curl, which we use to check the curl version, requires the standard `bc` command, which apparently on some systems is missing?

In a way this just means that the packaging of `curl` is broken since it should list `bc` as a runtime dependency.  But we can work around that by checking for it ourselves.

This issue *should* be independent of #24919 since we already use `curl-config` to check for curl...

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

This looks like a Debian bug, as I see this on Debian, and they package (lib)curl.
By right, `curl-config` they ship must be fully functional, but it misses `bc` as a dependency.

I cc one of Debian people packaging Sagemath here.

we could just make `bc` required in the top `configure.ac`, calling `AC_CHECK_PROGRAM` or whatever the right macro is.

<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
The upstream fix was merged in `curl 7.62.0`.

Rules for deciding whether to build curl are
described in `build/pkgs/curl/spkg-configure.m4`.

Currently the approach is based on `R`'s needs:

- build `curl` unless `curl >= 7.22` is found.

Which of the following should we change it to?

- build `curl` unless `curl >= 7.62` is found
- build `curl` unless either `curl >= 7.62` is found or `curl >= 7.22` and `bc` are found

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
Currently we do not build `curl` if `curl >= 7.22` (and, implcitly, `bc` - if the curl in question does need `bc` in its `curl-config`).

Adding an explicit check for `bc` (after our test for curl failed) would only improve error messages, but that's a rare event that a system has no `bc` installed.

Other potential improvements here would be to get rid of somewhat dodgy `LIBCURL_CHECK_CONFIG` and just use `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` (which doesn't need `bc`), or try `PKG_CHECK_MODULES`, and otherwise fall on `LIBCURL_CHECK_CONFIG`.

But all this is very minor.
