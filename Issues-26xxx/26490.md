As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43946/desolve-initial-condition-involving-e-gives-strange-answer/):

```
var('t') 
y = function('y')(t)
de1 = t^3*diff(y, t) + 4*t^2*y == e^(t^2)
desolve(de1, y, ics = [1,e])
```

leads to

```
1/2*(e^(t^2) + y(t))/t^4
```

Which is incorrect. The correct answer is:

```
1/2*(e + e^(t^2))/t^4
```

which can be obtained when replacing the symbolic constant `e` with the wymbolic expression `e*1` in the initial conditions:

```
desolve(de1, y, ics = [1,e*1])
```

This seems to be caused by #26492.

not really helpful, I guess, but

```
sage: desolve(de1, y, ics = [1,e], algorithm="fricas")
1/2*(e + e^(t^2))/t^4
```
works...
