In the course of my work with Jennifer Morse and gh-MareoRaft, we have done some experimenting with raising operators. This code is a cleaned-up version of what we have been using and I think it could be useful to other people since these operators come up here and there in combinatorics papers.

The current code is ready for (probably intensive!) review. A few things I already know will probably need to be addressed, but I would like guidance on.

1) Not everything is PEP8 ! In particular, how does one PEP8 the doctests correctly? Or is it fine as-is? This is not explained in the developer's guide.

2) I am still relatively inexperienced developing against the coercion model. I have tried to use the conversion functionality because the relevant morphisms do not meet the axioms of a coercion. I would welcome any constructive feedback so I can learn more!

3) This code structure has evolved over time, so there might be bits and pieces leftover that seem unnecessary. I have tried my best to clean them out, but if you see anything, I am more than happy to re-evaluate.

4) Some of this code may seem overly general? However, I already have additions/expansions in mind stemming from some research projects and other papers I have read, but I wanted to start small.

A good place to start for self-reviewing and cleaning up is looking at the patchbot output (https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/26939/ , link to it is currently a green check with a red x, indicating it passes all tests, but there are things to be fixed).

In terms of coverage, there are some methods that do not have any doctests, and those should be added.

For python3_py, Sage can currently use Python2, but all code being put in is meant to be compatible with Python3 for an eventual transition. It mentions on specific line that usess something like .iteritems(), which is being deprecated in Python.

Pyflakes lists some variables/imports that are no longer used.

Blocks tries to check to make sure the formatting for doc strings is proper, it looks like there might be something wrong with one INPUT:: string.

Not sure why non-ASCII is giving a complaint. I believe the x in startup modules is acceptable.

Can you make these additional changes real quick (otherwise I can do it later today)? Once done (and you agree with them), positive review.

Punctuation and using standard Sage macros:

```diff
-    `s = x_1^{a_1}x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_r^{a_r} \in S` where `a_i \in
-    \mathbb{Z}` and `r \geq \ell`, we get that `s.\lambda = (\lambda_1
-    + a_1, \lambda_2 + a_2,\ldots,\lambda_r+a_r)` where we pad
+    `s = x_1^{a_1}x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_r^{a_r} \in S`, where `a_i \in

+    + a_1, \lambda_2 + a_2,\ldots,\lambda_r+a_r)`, where we pad
```
Too many examples close together IMO:

```
-    examples of what this looks like with specific bases, see the
-    examples below.
