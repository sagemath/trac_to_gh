It is somehow annoying that the gcc package in Sage (standard package) is affected by the presence of the isl library (an optional)... Is that desirable? Is there a way to tell gcc configuration script to ignore isl?

Adding `--without-isl` to the configure options for `gcc` should disable using `isl`. (I'm not certain how to add this option in Sage's build system.)

On the other hand, according to https://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html, adding `--without-isl` disables some optimizations that anyone who has a system `isl` would otherwise get.

Letting `gcc` compile against `isl` is maybe not morally the nicest solution, but I don't see why it should lead to problems (beyond needing the two-line include-fix attached to this trac issue).

howto: the install script is `${SAGE_ROOT}/build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-install`.

It is indeed not moral since gcc is supposed to be built *before* isl. This gcc package within Sage is only here for convenience for users with a "broken" build system. On most platforms gcc is never built. I am curious how you ended up with this issue?

I also agree that the fix you provided should be included.

What about:

- adding the fix to isl
- and disabling isl during gcc build (at least by default)

It might sound like two fixes for the same problem but it is to my mind much cleaner.

Thanks. I thought I'd looked there, but must have accidentally looked somewhere else.

I proactively look for issues like this :). I got annoyed at things failing when `SAGE_CHECK="yes"` or due to missing build dependencies, so after (almost) every beta release, I run a script which, for every standard package `foo`, sets `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES` so only `foo` gets tested, then does `make distclean && make foo` and keeps track of whether this succeeds or fails.

`gcc-7.4` got released yesterday and is the only released version of `gcc` without this bug, so a cleaner solution for the first part might be to just to update `gcc`.

For the other part, another solution might be to just make `isl` a standard package and give it the same special treatment as `gmp` and friends, so it gets rebuilt after `gcc` is. That would mean the number of standard packages increases by one. Thoughts on this?

See #26954 for a followup that replaces the fix by simply upgrading to a newer version of gcc and disables isl during the gcc build.
