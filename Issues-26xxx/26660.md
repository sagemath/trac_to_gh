As I explained a bit [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/24919#comment:121), #25857 ad #25188 had some interdependency, but were merged in the wrong order.

#25857 was merged for 8.5.beta1, then #25188 was merged in 8.5.beta2.  However, the latter contained in it an old version of the former, which ended up taking precedence in the merge resolution.

This resulted in some changes being undone:

```
$ git diff 8.5.beta1..8.5.beta2 -- build/make/deps
```

```diff

I'd remove `Makefile.in` from this branch, as there you just add whitespace. Otherwise, looks good and works.

The whitespace added there was intentional--it was *unintentionally* removed same as the other changes added back in by this ticket.  In this case the whitespace is meaningful--it makes debug output more readable.
