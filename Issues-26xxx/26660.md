As I explained a bit [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/24919#comment:121), #25857 ad #25188 had some interdependency, but were merged in the wrong order.

#25857 was merged for 8.5.beta1, then #25188 was merged in 8.5.beta2.  However, the latter contained in it an old version of the former, which ended up taking precedence in the merge resolution.

This resulted in some changes being undone:

```
$ git diff 8.5.beta1..8.5.beta2 -- build/make/deps
```

```diff
