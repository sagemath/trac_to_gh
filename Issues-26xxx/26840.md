During a clean build of Sage 8.5.beta6, I experience the error below on OS X 10.13.6. It fails to copy the directory `src/bin/__pycache__` to `local/bin`.

This is fixed by adding `-R` to the corresponding `cp` command.

```
[sagelib-8.5.beta6] real        0m12.124s
[sagelib-8.5.beta6] user        0m7.640s
[sagelib-8.5.beta6] sys 0m3.659s
cp /Applications/SageMath/src/bin/__pycache__ /Applications/SageMath/local/bin/__pycache__
cp: /Applications/SageMath/src/bin/__pycache__ is a directory (not copied).
make[3]: *** [/Applications/SageMath/local/bin/__pycache__] Error 1
make[2]: *** [all-build] Error 2
