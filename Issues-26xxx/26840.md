During a clean build of Sage 8.5.beta6, I experience the error below on OS X 10.13.6. It fails to copy the directory `src/bin/__pycache__` to `local/bin`.

This is fixed by adding `-R` to the corresponding `cp` command.

```

cp /Applications/SageMath/src/bin/__pycache__ /Applications/SageMath/local/bin/__pycache__
cp: /Applications/SageMath/src/bin/__pycache__ is a directory (not copied).
make[3]: *** [/Applications/SageMath/local/bin/__pycache__] Error 1

I removed the branch. This problem can be avoided by removing all `__pycache__` folders (which happened to be empty) from the directory `src/sage/` and then running `make distclean` to erase any mention of `__pycache__` from the autogenerated Makefiles. I am not sure where those folders were coming from, but it does not seem to be a common problem.

This ticket can be closed.
