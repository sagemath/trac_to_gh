During a clean build of Sage 8.5.beta6, I experience the error below on OS X 10.13.6. It fails to copy the directory `src/bin/__pycache__` to `local/bin`.

This is fixed by adding `-R` to the corresponding `cp` command.

```

cp: /Applications/SageMath/src/bin/__pycache__ is a directory (not copied).
