For frenchbook doctests errors, I chose to use doctest flag `# py2` instead of rewriting the examples.

As the tests are supposed to be the examples of the book i think it's more consistent to just skip them in python 3 rather than rewrite them and have examples which differ form the book.

The remaining doctests errors does not depends on this "module".

Note however that `tests/french_book` is currently being updated with #23572,
thus it would be better to apply this patch after #23572 (for which reviewers are welcome).
