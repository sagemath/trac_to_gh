For frenchbook doctests errors, I chose to use doctest flag `# py2` instead of rewriting the examples.

As the tests are supposed to be the examples of the book i think it's more consistent to just skip them in python 3 rather than rewrite them and have examples which differ form the book.

The remaining doctests errors does not depends on this "module".

thank you for adding me in cc

Note however that `tests/french_book` is currently being updated with #23572,
thus it would be better to apply this patch after #23572 (for which reviewers are welcome).
