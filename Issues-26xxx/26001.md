A recent fix in Singular makes computing a certain invariant of modular cohomology rings of finite groups faster, but another recent fix in Singular makes the p_group_cohomology package fail.

The new version p_group_cohomology-3.0.1 is supposed to cope with the changes in Singular. I suggest to base it on top of #24735 and make it a dependency for #25993 (which contains the above mentioned changes in Singular).

While I was at it, I also improved more features of the package. Hence, I propose to upgrade to p_group_cohomology-3.1.

The new version copes with the changes in Singular also adds a new method that allows to find filter regular parameters in very small degrees after the computation of the cohomology ring has been completed. This may be useful to verify a conjecture of Benson in some open case.

**__Known problem__**

In some Singular procedures, I use a Hilbert driven computation, which in older versions of Singular used to be a lot faster and less buggy than what Singular could offer (this is in the computation of intersections, quotients etc.). In the new p_group_cohomology version, I found that in one example, my Hilbert driven procedures would give a wrong result. So, I changed the procedures, using Singular's built-in functions.

Now, **all tests pass**. However, some of these tests need a very long time, htop showing that the time is spent in Singular. Thus, I suppose it is because of dropping the Hilbert driven computations.

So, for now I am changing the ticket to "needs_review" --- after all, the tests pass. Nonetheless, I am investigating whether the slowness persists with Singular-4.1.1.p3 (after all, p3 fixes a performance problem in `std(id1,id2)` that was uncovered by my cohomology computations). If it doesn't, I will see how to work around the problem (such as: Use Hilbert only in characteristic two).

With Singular-4.1.1.p3, one test fails. Again, it is related with `std(id1,id2)`: In the old version, the Krull dimension of an ideal in some example was 5, in the new version it is 4.

But actually that could be my own fault: The ideal `id1` is supposed to be a Gröbner basis, but in my example it isn't. So, this I need to change.

Unfortunately, the "long time" problem persists in Singular-4.1.1.p3. So, I have to return to using my Hilbert driven computations.

Not good at all.

- Although the documentation builds fine when I build it separately, it consists of basically empty pages when I build it during package installation.
- Some doctests are very slow, because of Singular, regardless whether it is Singular-4.1.1.p2 or .p3; at least it seems that it is not caused by my Hilbert driven computations. It could actually be that the slowness is in a function that could use a Hilbert driven computation, but currently doesn't. I need to investigate.

```

So, it is not unlikely that some stale data has accumulated in Singular, which thus became slow. The next thing to try: Let `CohomologyRing.doctest_setup()` restart Singular. In that way, the test would be closer to what one does in an interactive session.

I have pushed my recent changes. The tests should pass.

Problems:
1. Some tests are MUCH slower than they should be. In an interactive session, they work a lot faster. I do not have the faintest idea what is causing the problem - if I understand correctly, it has not been the case with previous Singular versions.
2. While the documentation builds fine in a separate directory, it totally fails to correctly build during package installation.

Do you have an idea how to fix the above? If not, then I hope it doesn't prevent the package from being reviewed. In that way, it would at least be possible to upgrade to Singular-4.1.1.p3.

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:27\" align=\"right\">comment:27</div>\n\nPing.\n\nMeanwhile I consider to release version 3.1 of the cohomology package. News and changes:\n- I found that in an important example Singular has not been able to compute the Hilbert Poincar\u00e9 series, because of int overflow (upstream didn't answer my question whether it is possible to make Singular use bigint). I changed my programs so that my own implementation is used when the int overflow occurs.\n- My own implementation of Hilbert Poincar\u00e9 series computation will be improved and extended in the next version. It incorporates techniques that I learnt from an article of Anna Bigatti, whereas the old implementation followed the less efficient algorithm presented in Greuel's and Pfister's book.\n- The reason why I want to improve the computation of Hilbert Poincar\u00e9 series: I want to verify a conjecture of Dave Benson on the so-called filter degree type of modular group cohomology rings. So far, I thought that the computation of the filter degree type involves very expensive computations, but recently I realised that all what needs to be done is computed a couple of Hilbert Poincar\u00e9 series. And this will be in v3.1, too.\n\n**__QUESTION__**\n\nWhat shall happen with this ticket? The options I see are:\n1. Open a new ticket for p_group_cohomology-3.1 and close this one as wontfix.\n2. Open a new ticket for v3.1, but still wait for a review here.\n3. Change the topic of this ticket from \"Upgrade to v3.0.1\" to \"Upgrade to v3.1\".\n\nNote that I still have no clue concerning slow doctests (that aren't slow interactively and weren't slow in previous package versions) and the docbuild failure (that only occurs while installing the package, but not when building the docs in a separate step).",

Ping.

Meanwhile I consider to release version 3.1 of the cohomology package. News and changes:
- I found that in an important example Singular has not been able to compute the Hilbert Poincaré series, because of int overflow (upstream didn't answer my question whether it is possible to make Singular use bigint). I changed my programs so that my own implementation is used when the int overflow occurs.
- My own implementation of Hilbert Poincaré series computation will be improved and extended in the next version. It incorporates techniques that I learnt from an article of Anna Bigatti, whereas the old implementation followed the less efficient algorithm presented in Greuel's and Pfister's book.
- The reason why I want to improve the computation of Hilbert Poincaré series: I want to verify a conjecture of Dave Benson on the so-called filter degree type of modular group cohomology rings. So far, I thought that the computation of the filter degree type involves very expensive computations, but recently I realised that all what needs to be done is computed a couple of Hilbert Poincaré series. And this will be in v3.1, too.

**__QUESTION__**

What shall happen with this ticket? The options I see are:
1. Open a new ticket for p_group_cohomology-3.1 and close this one as wontfix.
2. Open a new ticket for v3.1, but still wait for a review here.
3. Change the topic of this ticket from "Upgrade to v3.0.1" to "Upgrade to v3.1".

Note that I still have no clue concerning slow doctests (that aren't slow interactively and weren't slow in previous package versions) and the docbuild failure (that only occurs while installing the package, but not when building the docs in a separate step).

I am not sure if I understand what you are saying.

After that, I hope that the other doctest errors will only be changed logging or changed sorting. So, hopefully it is ready for review before the end of the year.

I think the work is done. For me, the new version 3.1 of p_group_cohomology works with what currently is in develop, i.e., with Singular-4.1.1p2.p0 and GAP-4.10.0.

Note that the total computation time for all groups of order 64 is now only about 6:15min walltime.

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology.factory import unit_test_64
sage: unit_test_64()
...
#267: Walltime   6:12.67 min
      CPU-time   5:46.87 min
      Singular   0:42.96 min

([], [372.67809295654297, 346.87493, 42.97])
```
In the first package version, it used to be 45min or so.

Changes wrt. v3.0:
- Hilbert series computation by using a new implementation in SageMath.
- Vastly improved computation of filter degree type (now relying on
  Hilbert series).
- Use libgap instead of the GAP pexpect interface.
- Sub-package upgrade: modres-1.1
- New routine to compute filter regular parameters in small degrees
  by enumeration.
- Cope with some changes in Singular.

Concerning the last point: It has often been the case that changes in Singular or in the Sage library forced me to create a new version of the cohomology package. While this is still mentioned in SPKG.txt, I removed such details from the changelog that is part of the [package documentation](https://users.fmi.uni-jena.de/cohomology/documentation/).

Plan for version 4.0: Replace the Singular pexpect interface with libsingular. It will be a lot more work than the change from gap to libgap, but I am sure that it will bring even more speed-up and stability, since the singular interface is used much more intensely than the gap interface.

Anyway: I think it can now be reviewed!

Sorry, I found that I should do some editorial changes.

While I am at it, I now think that I should try to remove some of the very long tests. Indeed, some of theses tests only demonstrate how one should *not* proceed, and some of these tests appear twice in two different locations.

So, wait a few more hours before you review `;-)`...

```

So, there are only two tests for which a "long time" warning arises.
- One long test demonstrates a result on "essential classes" and show-cases capabilities of the method `essential_ideal()`. This test actually used to appear in the docs twice, but I have removed one copy of that test.
- The other long test is a "quick" version of `unit_test_64`. The full test would take more than 6 minutes and would compute the cohomology rings of all 268 groups of order 64 from scratch, and compare with the stored results. The "quick" version merely tests that the 268 cohomology rings can all be unpickled. So, it tests the integrity of the data base that is shipped with the package.

I prefer to keep both long tests.

Anyway. Since `sage.tests.modular_group_cohomology` and the package's test suite pass, I think it is now in the shape to be reviewed.

Please be more specific when you claim a merge conflict.

All what this ticket does is to touch files in `build/pkgs/p_group_cohomology` and `src/sage/tests/modular_group_cohomology/`, and I guess as the author of that package I would know if there had been a recent conflicting change in these files.

assuming trac is the tag of the correct remote, 
(i.e. the output of `git remote -v` contains the line
`trac	git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git (fetch)` ), do

```
git fetch trac public/ticket-26856
git checkout -b foo_whatever FETCH_HEAD
```
checks out the branch of #26856 (which is still there, just not reflected in the ticket's form any more; you can see the name in #26856, comment 137) and
tags it `foo_whatever`.
If you don't need to give it a name, then the last line could be just

```
git checkout FETCH_HEAD
```

I hate to think what could happen if a ticket merged in a beta-release stage gets unmerged before the release, while its branch is gone...
 
Anyway, I merely illustrated a basic two-liner to check out a named branch using plain git, no more than that.

user GAP code should not use such generic variable names, as GAP has no proper namespaces---whereas you have

```
GroupName := function(Gid)
  local Gname, Gsize;
  Gsize := Gid[1];
  Gname := Concatenation(String(Gsize), "gp", String(Gid[2]));
  return Gname;
end;
```

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A67):
> So renaming this function would do...

OK. GroupName is a bad description of that function anyway. It takes a SmallGroup address (otherwise named `Gid`), say, `(128,160)`, and turns it not into the name of the group (which would be `"Modular group of order 128"`, but into the string `"128gp160"` (otherwise named `GStem`), which is used to create the names of data directories associated with that group.

So, I'll call it `Gid2GStem`.
