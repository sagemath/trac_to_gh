I have some doubts on the use of `SagePrettyPrinter` instead of `pprint.pformat`. In particular, one is forced to import the necessary stuff inside the `_repr_` to avoid importing IPython at startup. But Volker said once that one should avoid `pprint.pformat`, without telling what to do instead.

From #26628, it seems that `SagePrettyPrinter` is not working either. So I want to wait on this ticket until we can figure out #26628.

I would argue that here we will only use the pretty printer on a dict with keys all of the same nature (elements in the same ring), hence that should always be comparable. So it should be ok. 

The phenomenon of impredictibility seen in #26628 comes from the comparison of letters and numbers.

Would you prefer to use pprint.pformat ?
