It seems Cython on Python 2 has some strange behaviors if you put `isinstance(..., range)`.  So I'm just going to drop that change until we have a better, consistent way to accept arbitrary sequence types in function arguments.

I would guess that comes from the fact that `range` on Cython is treated as special by the compiler as it can both be treated as `xrange` (e.g., in a `for` loop) and as a list:

```
sage: %%cython
....: def test(n):
....:     return range(n)
sage: test(5)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
