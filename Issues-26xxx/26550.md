Sadly this release still doesn't include sage's patch defining and using `UndefSage`. I am guessing it is still necessary.

And that's the only thing failing if you stick to plain unpatched sympy-1.3

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/sympy.py
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/sympy.py", line 859, in sage.interfaces.sympy.test_all
Failed example:
    test_all()
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

        assert f == sf._sage_()

which is of course what the patch fixes.
