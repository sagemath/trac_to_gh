The default sage colorscheme is pretty much [unreadable](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/10060/sage-terminal-colors/) on a black background. I can fix this by putting `%colors Linux` in `init.sage`, but every user with a dark terminal background has to figure that out for themselves.

There's no need to detect the terminal colors. This issue is due to the "SageIpythonConfiguration.colors()" function returning 'LightBG' in sage/repl/configuration.py.

To fix, it's as simple as returning 'Neutral', or better yet getting the default option from iPython via the SageTerminalInteractiveShell.colors.default()

At a quick glance it looks good. I might prefer the old style with a light background window, but this one looks much better with a dark background and is serviceable with either.
