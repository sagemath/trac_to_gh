The default sage colorscheme is pretty much [unreadable](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/10060/sage-terminal-colors/) on a black background. I can fix this by putting `%colors Linux` in `init.sage`, but every user with a dark terminal background has to figure that out for themselves.

We should be automatically setting that value. Unfortunately, figuring out the terminal background reliably is no easy task. Some terminals set `COLORFGBG`, others react to xterm queries. Resources:

There's no need to detect the terminal colors. This issue is due to the "SageIpythonConfiguration.colors()" function returning 'LightBG' in sage/repl/configuration.py.

To fix, it's as simple as returning 'Neutral', or better yet getting the default option from iPython via the SageTerminalInteractiveShell.colors.default()

At a quick glance it looks good. I might prefer the old style with a light background window, but this one looks much better with a dark background and is serviceable with either.
