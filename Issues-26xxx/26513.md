descendant of  at 0: Graph on 539 vertices
```


This is related to the missing in Sage constructions. 

In the first two cases graphs can be constructed using 2-graph descendant from Fickus et al SRGs (cf Brouwer's tables, not yet implemented in Sage), while their complements are
constructed using 2-graph descendant from known to Sage SRGs.

This illustrates a bug in discovery of SRGs via taking complements.


In the last case graphs can be constructed using 2-graph descendant from Fickus et al SRGs (cf Brouwer's tables, not yet implemented in Sage) or their complements.

There is also a discrepancy: the database gets broken after trying to build graphs.strongly_regular_graph(819, 400, 190, 200)
graphs.strongly_regular_graph(819, 418, 217, 209).

basically, `la()` must keep its promise to return a graph if called, but currently it does not if `g` can't be built, due to an absent implementation.
A naive way (in the patch) is just to try to actually build `g` first.

The `la` function contains a reference to `g[0]`, but `g` is defined in in the scope of `is_twograph_descendant_of_srg` and not returned. This seems weird (does not `g[0]` get destroyed?), but, after some tests, it looks like Cython makes it work, so I just want to 
bring it to your attention since you definitely know more than me how Cython works.
Apart from the above, the `la` function still contains some debugging code (lines 1489 and 1492).
In `strongly_regular_graph` the code that handles `mu == -1` (line 2838, 2839) is pointless as the same code is executed inside `strongly_regular_graph_lazy`.\\
Everything else looks good!

Yes, good catch, you are right about line 2903, it should be `lambda *t` to accommodate functions
without arguments. On the line 2937 all the functions are with at least one argument,
so it should be OK.
