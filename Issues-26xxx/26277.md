By the way, there are other Python 3 failures with Stanley-Reisner rings, of the form

```
File "src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py", line 86, in sage.homology.simplicial_complex
Failed example:
    X.stanley_reisner_ring()
Expected:
    Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x0, x1, x2, x3 over Integer Ring by the ideal (x1*x3, x0*x2)
Got:
    Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x0, x1, x2, x3 over Integer Ring by the ideal (x0*x2, x1*x3)
```
These have to do with how ideals for polynomial rings are printed, so it's coming from code in sage.rings.
