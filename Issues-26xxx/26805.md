This ticket fix the last py3 failures in combinat/rigged_configurations module.

For the  `TypeError: unsupported format string passed to sage.rings.rational.Rational.__format__` another approach is to implement a `__format__` method in `sage.rings.rational.Rational`, unfortunately it will not solve the cases with NoneType. For this reason i think string formatting support for sage's Rational should be done in another ticket if needed.

`@`chapoton I commented `vct` rather than deleting the line to keep consistency with
the comments below in the code. 
Do you think the comments 

```
        # vct = self.parent()._folded_ct
        # sigma = vct.folding_orbit()
        # gammatilde = list(vct.scaling_factors())
        # gammatilde[-1] = 2
``` 
are helpful or do you think we should delete them?
