While working on #26405, I noticed that the generic implementation of `quo_rem` is very slow. Indeed, compare:

```
sage: R.<a> = Zq(2^3)
sage: S.<x> = R[]
sage: P = S.random_element(degree=100)
sage: t = R.random_element()

sage: %timeit _ = P(t)
10000 loops, best of 3: 145 µs per loop

sage: Q = x - t
sage: %timeit _ = P % Q
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.06 ms per loop
```

I made a few Cython improvements. I also pulled out the `if` statement because I felt the code duplication was minimal and it would be better to avoid doing the if check every time in the loop.

If my changes are good, then positive review (with the author name is filled in).
