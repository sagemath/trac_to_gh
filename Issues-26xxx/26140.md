Just noticed this malformatted docstring while scrolling through the docs: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings/sage/rings/fraction_field.html#sage.rings.fraction_field.FractionFieldEmbedding

Also:
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/homset.html#sage.categories.homset.Homset

And some weird tabs in:
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/additive_semigroups.html#sage.categories.additive_semigroups.AdditiveSemigroups.Algebras.ParentMethods.algebra_generators
