We would need some of that file at least `/home/pi/sage-8.3/logs/pkgs/gfortran-7.2.0.log` to figure things out. Two other things come to mind:
* trying sage 8.4 now that is is out
* installing gfortran from your distribution so sage doesn't have to build its own

May be the pi ran out of memory, so I stopped all extra services or processes and being able to double up the free memory (oops! for the past) and now I am compiling sage-8.4, was getting make error suggesting "Set the environment variableSAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS to 'yes' to prevent this" and fixed that by running "ln -sf /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libstdc++.so.6.0.21 /home/pi/sage-8.4/local/lib/libstdc++.so.6".  Now it is compiling, lets see how it goes.

So what to do with this ticket now? I can re-deploy sage-8.3 anytime and start from the failure part if necessary.
