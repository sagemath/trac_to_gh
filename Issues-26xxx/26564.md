We would need some of that file at least `/home/pi/sage-8.3/logs/pkgs/gfortran-7.2.0.log` to figure things out. Two other things come to mind:
* trying sage 8.4 now that is is out
* installing gfortran from your distribution so sage doesn't have to build its own

This is quite weird. Also is there a `/home/pi/sage-8.3/config.log` and could you post it if you have it. If you already gfortran I want to know why sage decided to compile its own.

So what to do with this ticket now? I can re-deploy sage-8.3 anytime and start from the failure part if necessary.

Even with the config.log I don't understand why building gfortran was triggered. 

If you can build sage successfully without any additional problems we can just close the ticket. We'll advise on that later.
