The **big change** in this ticket is to use `yield` in iterators instead of first building a list and then returning an iterator over that list. This should speed up methods using these iterators.

On the way, I have put `try.. except TypeError` around the 2 `sorted` operations.

We also do PEP8 cleaning.

On the error messages, please remove the `!`.

I think a better way to do

```python
                        try:
                            v, u = sorted((self.vertex_label(v_int),
                                           self.vertex_label(u_int)))
                        except TypeError:
                            v = self.vertex_label(v_int)
                            u = self.vertex_label(u_int)
```
is to do

```python
                        v = self.vertex_label(v_int)
                        u = self.vertex_label(u_int)
                        try:
                            if u < v:
                                v, u = u, v
                        except TypeError:
                            pass
```
as it does not create an intermediary objects (the tuple and the resulting list), I would guess one comparison is faster than calling `sorted`, and we only change things if we need to.

Are there any plans for similar changes to sparse_graph.pyx, in particular to `iterator_edges`? I tried doing something similar, but it led to other problems, so it would be better if someone who knows the graph theory stuff better to do it. The code in sparse_graph.pyx leads to Python 3 doctest failures with simplicial complexes.
