The **big change** in this ticket is to use `yield` in iterators instead of first building a list and then returning an iterator over that list. This should speed up methods using these iterators.

On the way, I have put `try.. except TypeError` around the 2 `sorted` operations.

We also do PEP8 cleaning.

<a id='comment:2'></a>On the error messages, please remove the `!`.

I think a better way to do

```python
                        try:
                            v, u = sorted((self.vertex_label(v_int),
                                           self.vertex_label(u_int)))
                        except TypeError:
                            v = self.vertex_label(v_int)
                            u = self.vertex_label(u_int)
```
is to do

```python
                        v = self.vertex_label(v_int)
                        u = self.vertex_label(u_int)
                        try:
                            if u < v:
                                v, u = u, v
                        except TypeError:
                            pass
```
as it does not create an intermediary objects (the tuple and the resulting list), I would guess one comparison is faster than calling `sorted`, and we only change things if we need to.
