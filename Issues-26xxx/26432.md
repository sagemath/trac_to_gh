Small things that I think should be fixed before a positive review:

`sorted(V.keys())` -> `sorted(V)`.

While I understand why, it still looks ugly

```
+        A snark has chromatic index 4 hence its line graph has chromatic number
+        4::
```
probably better to also move down `number` and maybe also `chromatic`.

The bullet points are over-indented:

```diff
         Here are two very simple modules :
 
-            * A connected component `C` (or the union of some --but
-              not all-- of them) of a disconnected graph `G`, for
-              instance, is a module, as no vertex of `C` has a
-              neighbor outside of it.
+            * A connected component `C` (or the union of some --but not all-- of
+              them) of a disconnected graph `G`, for instance, is a module, as
+              no vertex of `C` has a neighbor outside of it.
 
-            * An anticomponent `C` (or the union of some --but not
-              all-- of them) of an non-anticonnected graph `G`, for
-              the same reason (it is just the complement of the
-              previous graph !).
+            * An anticomponent `C` (or the union of some --but not all-- of
+              them) of an non-anticonnected graph `G`, for the same reason (it
+              is just the complement of the previous graph !).
```

I would move off on the `ear_decomposition` changes to a separate ticket as this one is big enough (and likely to have conflicts). However, I would probably consider doing the sorting here.

Thanks for all the comments. I will modify `ear_decomposition` in a separate ticket.

I have removed sorting from several example. Was not needed.

Concerning the sorting of output in `cliques_maximal` and `vertex_cover`. Should we put a deprecation warning ? if so, a dedicated ticket is certainly better (easier to check), no ?

Concerning the removal of sorting. It was easier than expected and I have not noticed any impact on other methods.

After that I did additional improvements in INPUT blocks and lambda statements.

Further improvements are certainly possible like moving references to the global file, but I suggest to do that only after the giant patch #26423 is closed.
