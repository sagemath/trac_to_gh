So far, remaining issues are:
- sorting of output in `cliques_maximal` and `vertex_cover`. Should we put a deprecation ? (could be done in a specific ticket)
- sorting in examples of `cliques_number_of`, `cliques_vertex_clique_number`, `cliques_containing_vertex`. This can be changed here.
- recursion on method `DFS` of `ear_decomposition`. I can do it here or in specific ticket.

Any advise is more than welcome.

Small things that I think should be fixed before a positive review:

`sorted(V.keys())` -> `sorted(V)`.

While I understand why, it still looks ugly

```
+        A snark has chromatic index 4 hence its line graph has chromatic number
+        4::
```
probably better to also move down `number` and maybe also `chromatic`.

The bullet points are over-indented:

```diff
         Here are two very simple modules :
 
-            * A connected component `C` (or the union of some --but
-              not all-- of them) of a disconnected graph `G`, for
-              instance, is a module, as no vertex of `C` has a
-              neighbor outside of it.
+            * A connected component `C` (or the union of some --but not all-- of
+              them) of a disconnected graph `G`, for instance, is a module, as
+              no vertex of `C` has a neighbor outside of it.
 
-            * An anticomponent `C` (or the union of some --but not
-              all-- of them) of an non-anticonnected graph `G`, for
-              the same reason (it is just the complement of the
-              previous graph !).
+            * An anticomponent `C` (or the union of some --but not all-- of
+              them) of an non-anticonnected graph `G`, for the same reason (it
+              is just the complement of the previous graph !).
```

I would move off on the `ear_decomposition` changes to a separate ticket as this one is big enough (and likely to have conflicts). However, I would probably consider doing the sorting here.

Thanks for all the comments. I will modify `ear_decomposition` in a separate ticket.

I have removed sorting from several example. Was not needed.

Concerning the sorting of output in `cliques_maximal` and `vertex_cover`. Should we put a deprecation warning ? if so, a dedicated ticket is certainly better (easier to check), no ?

I would say it is fine. There is not a decent reason I can think of why someone should be assuming the output is sorted. Nor was it documented that the output was sorted.

Concerning the removal of sorting. It was easier than expected and I have not noticed any impact on other methods.

After that I did additional improvements in INPUT blocks and lambda statements.

Further improvements are certainly possible like moving references to the global file, but I suggest to do that only after the giant patch #26423 is closed.
