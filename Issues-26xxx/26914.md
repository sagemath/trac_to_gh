All looks fine apart from this:

```
-    dlist = sum([v for h, v in iteritems(discriminants_with_bounded_class_number(K.degree(), proof=proof))], [])
+    dlist = sorted(Df for v in discriminants_with_bounded_class_number(K.degree(), proof=proof).values() for Df in v)
```
whose syntax looks suspicious to me.
