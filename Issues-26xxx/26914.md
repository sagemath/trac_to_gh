All looks fine apart from this:

-    dlist = sum([v for h, v in iteritems(discriminants_with_bounded_class_number(K.degree(), proof=proof))], [])
+    dlist = sorted(Df for v in discriminants_with_bounded_class_number(K.degree(), proof=proof).values() for Df in v)

whose syntax looks suspicious to me.

Hmm. Why suspicious ? The "sorted" is the only real change we are making here. If my understanding of the mathematics involved is ok, this should not be a problem.
