At the moment `shells_topological` of a mutable poset breaks ties by means of `repr` by default. However, mutable poset is a data structure and should not do this expensive operation by default, therefore this default should be removed which is the aim of this ticket.

Note that this default was in mainly due to convenience reasons to have the results in the doctests always in the same order.

(Motivation: For my code/application, this improves the computation time by more than a factor 2.)

I looked through the changes and they look good to me overall.

Would it make sense to add another doctest (possibly with output marked as random) where no key is passed and thus no sorting happens?

I was thinking about testing whether calling the method without a key still works -- but you are right, I also cannot think of a usecase for that.

Good to go.
