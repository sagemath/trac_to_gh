Implementation of nilpotent Lie groups as manifolds with a distinguished global coordinate system (exponential coordinates).

Planned features:

* representation of elements in exponential coordinates of the first or second kind
* multiplication of symbolic points (using the manifold point framework)
* the frames of left-invariant and right-invariant vector fields
* the exponential map `exp:\mathfrak{g}\to G` and the logarithm
* the adjoint map `Ad:G\times \mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{g}`

Depends on #26080

A partial first version is now ready, containing the exponential map, exponential coordinates of the first and second kind and group multiplication. Vector fields and the adjoint map are still completely missing, but I thought it would be good to get a working copy up in case there are already some glaring flaws.

In particular, one thing that did not feel quite right was the current method of computing the symbolic group law. The only way I could think of was to extract the structural coefficients of the Lie algebra and to create a new Lie algebra over `SR` using the same structural coefficients. Two immediate issues of the current approach are

1. the overhead of creating a new Lie algebra
2. the original base ring of the Lie algebra needs to admit a coercion into `SR`

Another thing is how to handle the symbolic group law. Currently it is done by creating two dummy-variables, computing the group law as a vector expression in exponential coordinates (through the BCH formula) and then evaluating the group law by substitution of the dummy-variables.

This is still work-in-progress, but I would be happy to hear comments or suggestions.

Eric, I am cc-ing you in case you have any comments.

The symbolic ring is usually a bit of a slow beast. it definitely feels wrong to have to have a second copy of the Lie algebra over `SR`. You probably could just use the structure coeffs info.

Anyways, I will think more about this.

Good to see that Lie groups are arriving in Sage!
I'll have a look tomorrow, focusing on the `SR` issue.

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A6):
> I am not sure I agree with caching the `*_invariant_frame`. I think this is already done by the atlas for the manifold and there is probably not much benefit to having this cached at the top level as not a lot of computation is done in the methods themselves.

Right, I did not realize there is manifold level caching. I will remove it from here.

> Another comment is that `structure_coefficients` should exist anytime the Lie algebra has a basis because of the category. 

This is a good point, and I should in fact change `indices()` to `basis().keys()` as in the category code of `structure_coefficients`, so it will work regardless within the category.

> It might be better to implement a `change_ring()` method for the class instead of the helper function (which could have more general use).

Ideally construction of a Lie group would not rely on the Lie algebra having a `change_ring()` method, but instead only rely on things required/defined in the finite dimensional (nilpotent) Lie algebras with basis category. 

However it would make sense to by default use `change_ring` if it exists, and to implement this at least for `LieAlgebraWithStructureCoefficients`. Then only in the case when `change_ring` is not defined, the code could fall back to creation of a new Lie algebra using `structure_coefficients()`.

Thanks for the comments!

I gave a first glance: this looks very nice!

A very minor remark: in the example shown in line 151 of `lie_group.py` (as well as in other similar examples), a shortcut for

```
sage: list(X[0].components(exp1_frame))
```
is 

```
sage: X[0][exp1_frame,:]
```
Maybe you chose the longer version as being more explicit?
Also you can display the components of the vector field `X[0]` by

```
sage: X[0].display(exp1_frame)
X_0 = d/dx_0 - 1/2*x_1 d/dx_2
```
Since `exp1_frame` is the default vector frame on `G`, this can be shorten to simply
`X[0].display()`.

At this point I don't know what should be the default frame. The best sounding options are either the coordinate frame of the default system of coordinates, or the left-invariant frame.

In the documentation, maybe you could use the method `at()` of vector fields to illustrate that the members of `G.left_invariant_frame()` do obey the definition of a left invariant vector field, for instance:

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.Heisenberg(QQ, 1)
sage: G = NilpotentLieGroup(L, 'G'); G
Lie group of Heisenberg algebra of rank 1 over Rational Field
sage: p,q,z = L.basis()
```
Let us first introduce a specific element `k` and generic element `g` in `G`: 

```
sage: k = G.exp(p)*G.exp(q); k
exp(p1 + q1 + 1/2*z)
sage: g = G(G.chart_exp1()[:]); g  # a generic element of G
exp(x_0*p1 + x_1*q1 + x_2*z)
```
We introduce next the left translation by `k`:

```
sage: L_k = G.diff_map(G, coord_functions=(k*g).coordinates()); L_k
Differentiable map from the Lie group of Heisenberg algebra of rank 1 over Rational Field to itself
sage: L_k.display()
G --> G
   (x_0, x_1, x_2) |--> (x_0 + 1, x_1 + 1, -1/2*x_0 + 1/2*x_1 + x_2 + 1/2)
```
Then we check that `X[0]` obeys the definition of a left invariant vector field as follows:

```
sage: X = G.left_invariant_frame(); X
Vector frame (G, (X_0,X_1,X_2))
sage: L_k.differential(g)(X[0].at(g)) == X[0].at(L_k(g))
True
```
Of course, we have as well

```
sage: L_k.differential(g)(X[1].at(g)) == X[1].at(L_k(g))
True
sage: L_k.differential(g)(X[2].at(g)) == X[2].at(L_k(g))
True
```
Of course, a full check would require that `k` is a generic element of `G`; this is possible, by defining `k` from symbolic coordinates.

Thanks for the suggestion, this is indeed a very good demonstration of basic Lie group functionality. I also ended up adding the creation of left/right translations as a prebuilt method as these maps should see heavy use in practice.

I have still to add in the methods for the logarithm and adjoint maps, after that I would for the moment be satisfied with the basic Lie group functionality. Or at least I can't think of what it is I am missing.

A question came to my mind: at the moment

```
sage: L = G.lie_algebra(); L
Heisenberg algebra of rank 1 over Rational Field
sage: T1G = G.tangent_space(G.one()); T1G
Tangent space at exp(0)
```
are two different beasts:

```
sage: L.category()
Category of finite dimensional nilpotent lie algebras with basis over Rational Field
sage: T1G.category()
Category of finite dimensional vector spaces over Symbolic Ring
sage: L.basis()
Finite family {'p1': p1, 'q1': q1, 'z': z}
sage: T1G.bases()
[Basis (d/dx_0,d/dx_1,d/dx_2) on the Tangent space at exp(0)]
```
also as Python objects: `L` inherits from `sage.algebras.lie_algebras.lie_algebra.LieAlgebraWithGenerators`, while `T1G` inherits from `sage.tensor.modules.finite_rank_free_module.FiniteRankFreeModule`.

Would it be worth to implement the canonical vector space isomorphism between the two? Would this be useful? A natural way to do it would be via Sage coercions, i.e. implement at least a coercion from `L` to `T1G` (the reverse may not work for vectors with symbolic components). If you think this is worth, this could anyway be postponed to another ticket...

Since vector fields already have a Lie bracket operation defined, this should be doable through computation with the left-invariant frame. It would also allow computing symbolic Lie brackets.\n\nAll of this combined would add up to quite a bit though. I think leaving it to a new ticket would be a good idea.",

Replying to [@egourgoulhon](#comment%3A17):
> I took the liberty of adding a new section "Lie groups" at the manifold metaticket #18528 and put your ticket there. I hope you don't mind.

This is perfectly fine by me, organization is good.

Replying to [@egourgoulhon](#comment%3A18):
> Would it be worth to implement the canonical vector space isomorphism between the two? Would this be useful? A natural way to do it would be via Sage coercions, i.e. implement at least a coercion from `L` to `T1G` (the reverse may not work for vectors with symbolic components). If you think this is worth, this could anyway be postponed to another ticket...

Yes this makes sense, and at least the simple coercion should be quite immediate to define, since the basis of the Lie algebra and the basis coming from the exponential coordinate frame are already in direct correspondence as lists. 

It might actually also be nice to give `T1G` the full Lie algebra structure and upgrade the coercion to one of Lie algebras. Since vector fields already have a Lie bracket operation defined, this should be doable through computation with the left-invariant frame. It would also allow computing symbolic Lie brackets.

All of this combined would add up to quite a bit though. I think leaving it to a new ticket would be a good idea.

I would favor passing the Lie group itself and not the string representing its name as the argument of the `exp` defined in the element methods of `LieAlgebras`, i.e. 
something like

```
def exp(self, lie_group=None):
    if not lie_group:
        return self.parent().lie_group().exp(self)
    return lie_group.exp(self)
```
This seems more robust to me, especially at this level (element method of *all* Lie algebras).

Yes.

I would say yes as well (this would be in the same vein as what we have for manifolds), but I am not 100% sure this is the best option.

For the reference manual, there are naturally two options:
- a new subsection "Lie groups" of 
  http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/
- a new subsection "Lie groups" of http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/

since Lie groups lie at the intersection of both topics. Depending on which one you choose, I would rename the source file `lie_group.py` to `nilpotent_lie_group.py` and place it in the new subdirectory `src/sage/groups/lie_groups` or `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/lie_groups`.

It probably should be removed, but it should be a new subcatalog `groups.lie`. So I did this.

I removed the `Group.__init__` as that was not doing anything useful.

I cached `chart_exp2` and just called that instead of `_Exp2`.

Other misc doc tweaks.

If my changes are good, then I think we can set a positive review unless Eric has some more comments.

Ah, I didn't know about the groups catalog, this is a very good solution, thanks! I fixed a typo in the catalog and removed the now empty file `lie_gps/all.py`

I modified the `_repr_` method of Lie group elements to avoid unnecessarily calling `chart_exp2` in case the default chart is `_Exp1`, since the computation is quite expensive. Although the current form is not ideal either, since now if the default coordinate chart is something other than `chart_exp2` or `_Exp1`, then it will still unnecessarily compute the transitions to and from exp-2 coordinates.

Other than that, the changes look good to me.
