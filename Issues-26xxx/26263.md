These are the remaining fixes to this package in my python3 branch that haven't been upstreamed yet.

Apparently I already had a hash implementation for the `Order` class, but this supplements the docstring with additional tests I had written.

Regarding the `timestr()` function, I would normally be wary of removing any non-underscored function without a deprecation, but in this case I believe it is justified:

1. It was only ever used as a utility function in a different module that was removed 8 years ago (#9359), at which point it became dead code.  It should have been removed with the rest of #9359.

2. Nothing else uses or has ever used it.

3. It doesn't have anything to do with the rest of the surrounding code; there's no reason anyone would look to that module for such a function.

4. It is not well implemented even for what it's supposed to do.  In the remote chance that someone is actually using this in their code they almost certainly have bigger problems ;)
