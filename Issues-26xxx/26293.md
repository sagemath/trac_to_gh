The `skew_partition.py` portion of the migration of the **k_combinat_for_sage** (https://github.com/MareoRaft/k_combinat_for_sage) project into core sage (see also the mother ticket #25295).

This branch is *now ready* for review :)

Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to review is the functions

* `is_symmetric`
* `right`
* `left`
* `top`
* `bottom`
* `is_linked`
* `k_boundary_to_partition`
* `is_k_boundary`
* `row_shape_to_linked_skew_partitions`
* `size_to_linked_skew_partitions`

which are all located in the file `src/sage/combinat/skew_partition.py`.

There is a change I haven't done yet but want an opinion on:

There are two functions (`row_shape_to_linked_skew_partitions` and `size_to_linked_skew_partitions`) which I haven't fit into the standard object-oriented organization...

I think the most appropriate thing would be to create a new class `LinkedSkewPartition` which subclasses `SkewPartition` and merely adds the additional restriction `is_linked` to the constructor.  There would also be a class called `LinkedSkewPartitions` which would have the methods `init_from_row_shape` and `init_from_size`, which would be my two functions.

Let me know if you think this is a good idea.
