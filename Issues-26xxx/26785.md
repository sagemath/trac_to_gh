Alternative to #26740 making use of #26784.

I kept the make target for sake of convenience, but reworked it.
The attached list of known failures were generated from my Linux machine; the exact list still may be somewhat platform dependent so it's something we may have to experiment with.

False positives (tests marked as known-failure that pass) are not such a problem, but if I'm missing any that are known to fail elsewhere please add them to the list.

Depends on #26784
