Issue:

```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: Q.<y> = P[]
sage: a = 3*y + 1
sage: a//a
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

due to cb8db697a1b (#26433).

The branch on this ticket fixes that issue and improves `inverse_of_unit()`; see the commit messages for detail.

<a id='comment:1'></a>
The simple fix should be to add

```diff
         try:
             inv = y[n-1].inverse_of_unit()
-        except (ArithmeticError, ValueError):
+        except (ArithmeticError, ValueError, TypeError):
             inv = ~(y[n-1])
             convert = True
```
However, I would argue the real bug is here:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R(2).inverse_of_unit()
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```
In particular, we are inconsistent about the type of error that is raised. This was an assumption in the code block above, which is why it was not caught. Hence, the above change should fix this, but sweep the underlying issue under the rug.

Also, wouldn't it be better to do

```diff
         elif d == -1:
             return self._parent(~self._parent._base.zero())
-        return self._parent(~self.get_unsafe(0))
+        return self._parent(self.get_unsafe(0).inverse_of_unit())
```

Side note: We probably should add a generic `inverse_of_unit` to the category of `Fields` that simply returns `~self`.

So this behavior should change now with this change:

```
sage: RR(0).inverse_of_unit()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ArithmeticError                           Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-7-9817ebd4dc31> in <module>()
----> 1 RR(Integer(0)).inverse_of_unit()

/home/travis/sage-build/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/categories/rings.pyc in inverse_of_unit(self)
   1155             try:
   1156                 if not self.is_unit():
-> 1157                     raise ArithmeticError("element is not a unit")
   1158             except NotImplementedError:
   1159                 # if an element does not implement is_unit, we just try to

ArithmeticError: element is not a unit
sage: 1/RR(0)
+infinity
```
I think it is the correct change, but I am now maybe a little worried about assumptions and we might want to quickly ask on sage-devel about this to confirm.

Also, a better test:

```
                sage: try:
                ....:    QQ(0).inverse_of_unit()
                ....: except ArithmeticError as e:
                ....:    print(type(e))
                <... 'exceptions.ZeroDivisionError'>
```
to

```
                sage: QQ(0).inverse_of_unit()
                Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...

I just followed your suggestion here, I have no opinion on the matter.

I deliberately wrote it that way, to hint to the fact that it is often better to catch all `ArithmeticError`s than just `ZeroDivisionError`s if you are `calling inverse_of_unit()`â€”but yes, I should have been more explicit!

Why do you try/catch here

Because `//` now relies on the exception being `ArithmeticError` (that's what caused of the regression, and the convention used by `inverse_of_unit()` elsewhere in Sage). While I fixed `inverse_of_unit()` in the case that caused the issue reported in this ticket, there may be other code paths that raise the wrong exception.

If any, it would be better to fix the error in inverse of unit rather than introducing this workaround that hides the problem.

I don't think so. Raising another exception is a really minor issue compared to breaking mathematical functionality; and, since it will typically come from conversion failures, it might even be a reasonable choice in some cases.

I agree with Vincent here as consistent error messages are not only better practice, but are also  useful. It allows a `TypeError` raised from actual bug to be percolated up instead of being caught and maybe silently working.
