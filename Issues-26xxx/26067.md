Speed up `//` for multivariate polynomials over ℤ after the regression discussed at #24735#comment:7. See also #25313.

#24735:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: p = 3*(-x^8*y^2 - x*y^9 + 6*x^8*y + 17*x^2*y^6 - x^3*y^2)
sage: q = 7*(x^2 + x*y + y^2 + 1)
sage: %timeit p//q
The slowest run took 43.99 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000 loops, best of 3: 278 µs per loop
```
