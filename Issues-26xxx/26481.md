CircleCI and [GitLab](GitLab) CI currently both build-from-latest using `sagemath/sagemath-dev:develop`. This leads to annoying errors when building from older branches as the build process won't find the commit that `sagemath-dev:develop` was built from in that branch.

Instead, we should build from `sagemath-dev:latest-tag-in-branch`, so currently we would build from `sagemath-dev:8.4.rc0` for new branches but also branches based on older states of the repository would still work. In particular, the build is more reproducible. Rerunning a build later, does not try to build from a different base build.

There's a reasonable message in the build log I think. `Could not find commit `cat docker/.commit` in your local Git history. Please merge in the latest built develop branch to fix this: git fetch trac && git merge `cat docker/.commit`. I think I'd just leave this alone.
