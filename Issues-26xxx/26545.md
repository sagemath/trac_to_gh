<a id='comment:16'></a>To be accurate are you talking about all the cases with `#py2/#py3` or only the ones in `additive_magmas.py` and `additive_semigroups.py` ?

The other case in category.py is quite different by nature :

```
-            sage: Algebras(QQ).required_methods()
+            sage: Algebras(QQ).required_methods() # py2
             {'element': {'optional': ['_add_', '_mul_'], 'required': ['__nonzero__']},
              'parent': {'optional': ['algebra_generators'], 'required': ['__contains__']}}
+            sage: Algebras(QQ).required_methods() # py3
+            {'element': {'optional': ['_add_', '_mul_'], 'required': ['__bool__']},
+             'parent': {'optional': ['algebra_generators'], 'required': ['__contains__']}}
```
the only other ways to fix that i can think of is not testing `__nonzero__/__bool__` presence or modify the doctest framework ( and i think the later is not worth it for one case).
