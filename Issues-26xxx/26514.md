I disagree with these changes:

```diff
-    Then, for each vertex ``v``, we set ``reachL[v]=L(C)``, where ``C`` is
-    the strongly connected component containing ``v``.
+    Then, for each vertex `v`, we set `reachL[v]=L(C)`, where `C` is the
+    strongly connected component containing `v`.
```

```diff
-    ``reachL``, ``reachU``: two arrays that should be allocated outside
-    this function and that should have size at least ``g.n``. At the end,
-    ``reachL[v]`` (resp., ``reachU[v]``) will contain the lower (resp., upper)
-    bound on the number of reachable vertices from ``v``.
+    `reachL`, `reachU`: two arrays that should be allocated outside this

+    (resp., `reachU[v]`) will contain the lower (resp., upper) bound on the
+    number of reachable vertices from `v`.
```

```diff
-    For each vertex ``v``, computes the number of vertices reachable from ``v``.
+    For each vertex `v`, compute the number of vertices reachable from `v`.
 
-    The number of vertices reachable from ``v`` (which is the size of the
-    connected component containing ``v``) is stored in variable
-    ``reachable[v]``. The array ``reachable`` is assumed to be allocated
-    outside this function, and it is assumed to have size at least ``g.n``.

+    `reachable[v]`. The array `reachable` is assumed to be allocated outside
+    this function, and it is assumed to have size at least `g.n`.
```
as they are now using latex formatting instead of code formatting. I also think the `k` in `centrality_closeness_top_k` is better in code formatting as it refers to the input `k`.

Why did you add the `key` here:

```diff
-    if k >= G.num_verts():
-        closeness_dict = G.centrality_closeness(by_weight=False,algorithm='BFS')
-        return sorted([(closz, z) for z,closz in closeness_dict.iteritems()], reverse=True)
-    if G.num_verts()==0 or G.num_verts()==1:
+    if k >= G.order():
+        closeness_dict = G.centrality_closeness(by_weight=False, algorithm='BFS')
+        return sorted([(closz, z) for z, closz in closeness_dict.items()],
+                          reverse=True, key=lambda zz: zz[0])
```
Is it to avoid comparisons of vertex labels? Are the values of `closeness_dict` guaranteed to be distinct?

Typo: `futur`

I have implemented your comments.

Concerning the `key` in the sorting: yes, it is to avoid comparison of vertex labels as several vertices may have the same centrality. For instance

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: print(G.centrality_closeness(by_weight=False, algorithm='BFS'))
{0: 0.6, 1: 0.6, 2: 0.6, 3: 0.6, 4: 0.6, 5: 0.6, 6: 0.6, 7: 0.6, 8: 0.6, 9: 0.6}
