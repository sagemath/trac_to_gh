The test suite for sagetex should unset `TEXINPUTS` when testing. As it is, it runs `latex` on the wrong file `example.tex`: it tests one that happens to lie in a path in `TEXINPUTS`, and then it uses the version of `sagetex.sty` from elsewhere, also. (My `TEXINPUTS` has `.` at the end of the list of paths, not the beginning, so it looks there last. It has `PATH_TO_SAGE/local/share/texmf//`, where `PATH_TO_SAGE` is the location of my standard stable Sage installation, earlier in the list of paths.)
