Working on #26243, I found that one can get a substantial speed-up by implementing a pool for ETuple (so that memory allocation and deallocation occurs less often).

I chose the component "memleak", because my first attempt at implementing a pool has a memory leak...

Depends on #26243

Ouch, I am so sorry! For some reasons, I got the timings wrong and though that the pool gives a speed-up. But it doesn't.

In principle it really should speed things up, at least if implemented correctly...\n\nActually I do not clearly recall how I did that. My original motivation came from the computation of Hilbert series in cases in which Singular couldn't give an answer and other available packages in Sage sucked. So, I guess I was timing the Hilbert series computation (which in fact heavily uses ETuple).\n\nAnother possibility is to create polynomials in the generic implementation, i.e., NOT using libsingular but instead using `MPolynomial_polydict`, and test the time for arithmetic operations, as they rely on ETuple operations, too.",

Replying to [@embray](#comment:4):
> I'd be curious about revisiting this.  How were you timing this?  In principle it really should speed things up, at least if implemented correctly...

Actually I do not clearly recall how I did that. My original motivation came from the computation of Hilbert series in cases in which Singular couldn't give an answer and other available packages in Sage sucked. So, I guess I was timing the Hilbert series computation (which in fact heavily uses ETuple).

Another possibility is to create polynomials in the generic implementation, i.e., NOT using libsingular but instead using `MPolynomial_polydict`, and test the time for arithmetic operations, as they rely on ETuple operations, too.

I have rebased the old branch on top of the current develop branch. Also, I changed all remaining `for i from 0<=i<whatever` to `for i in range(whatever)`.

Here are timings. For test, I am using this:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.polydict import ETuple
sage: cython("""
....: from sage.rings.polynomial.polydict cimport ETuple
....: from sage.all import get_memory_usage
....: def test_new(ETuple T):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i in range(10000):
....:         T = T._new()
....: def test_addmin(ETuple T):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i in range(10000):
....:         T = T.emin(T.eadd(T))
....: """)
sage: T = ETuple(range(20))
```
Timing with `develop`:

```
sage: %timeit test_new(T)
1000 loops, best of 3: 299 µs per loop
sage: %timeit test_addmin(T)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.98 ms per loop
```
Timing with the branch from here:

```
sage: %timeit test_new(T)
10000 loops, best of 3: 71.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit test_addmin(T)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.96 ms per loop
```

So, the time for creating new instance has indeed improved. However, it also becomes clear that the creation of a new tuple (which occurs both in `.eadd()` and `.emin()`) is negligible compared with what else is to be done.

Therefore, I believe that having an ETuple pool is not a real improvement after all. But I let this up to the reviewer: If you think that the improvement isn't worth the effort, then review this as "invalid/won't fix". If you think "why not?", then we can of course keep working on it.

Actually I am not fully deallocating the tuple data in `tp_dealloc`! I only dealloc the tuple data if the pool is full and thus every data has to go to oblivion. But if an ETuple is parked in the pool, then the tuple data is in fact kept. If later the ETuple is revived, the tuple data is not allocated but reallocated during `__init__` (which typically should be faster than a full deallocation followed by an allocation).

So, I guess `@cython.freelist(1000)` won't be equivalent.
