We should raise the standard of C++ used to compile Sage to C++11 minimum,
across all standard (and, in time, optional) packages.

This ticket is removing per-package C++ flags and replacing them with the globally set stuff. This is needed to stop package-wise bikeshedding on C++ versions, to make sure not accidentally incompatible C++ ABIs are created.

Yeah but we don't enforce compilation with at least that standard - at least not everywhere. See #25532.

Why should Sage enforce C++11 for every package? I would leave that decision to each package individually.

There is also a makefile patch in frobby which I decided not to touch. I'd rather someone interested in the optional frobby package to update the patch next time it needs touching.

It will need testing on cygwin in particular.

There is also a question what actually happens to `BLAH=foo`  after the `./configure` run.
For some of variables such as `BLAH` the values provided 
are getting stored somewhere, e.g. for `FC` and `CC`.
Is there a list of such stored variables anywhere? E.g. would `FFLAGS` value be stored somewhere?

I think that this is finally the explanation that I asked for.

But that raises the question: why should these flags become part of `CXX` and not `CXXFLAGS`?

I think that this branch puts stuff in CXXFLAGS, not in CXX.

By putting it in `CXX` you make your compiler c++11 compliant whether it is called with `CXXFLAGS` (as you should) or not.

Then the documentation at https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.html would be wrong. And I don't believe that's the case.

As you can see even though my compiler default to gnu++14, `-std=gnu++11` is added.
