We should raise the standard of C++ used to compile Sage to C++11 minimum,
across all standard (and, in time, optional) packages.

This ticket is removing per-package C++ flags and replacing them with the globally set stuff. This is needed to stop package-wise bikeshedding on C++ versions, to make sure not accidentally incompatible C++ ABIs are created.

Why should Sage enforce C++11 for every package? I would leave that decision to each package individually.

There is also a question what actually happens to `BLAH=foo`  after the `./configure` run.
For some of variables such as `BLAH` the values provided 
are getting stored somewhere, e.g. for `FC` and `CC`.
Is there a list of such stored variables anywhere? E.g. would `FFLAGS` value be stored somewhere?

By putting it in `CXX` you make your compiler c++11 compliant whether it is called with `CXXFLAGS` (as you should) or not.

Then the documentation at https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.html would be wrong. And I don't believe that's the case.

It used to be the case, but I believe that with the macro I put in this ticket it should always be there. Which is annoying because my intent was ensuring a minimum standard but with the macro at hand it become the standard used not a minimum one. See http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=autoconf-archive.git;a=commitdiff;h=bbb60ca79952c20ee0b187208533d98206b156d1;hp=ad15d52fd1e552bc3d7fcfb3d7bc6a2681f364d8

For info `sage-env-config` with gcc-8.2.0

```

#  Set some environment variables for Sage.
#  This file is generated from sage-env-config.in by configure.
#
#  NOTES:
#  - You must *source* this script instead of executing.
#  - Use "return" instead of "exit" to signal a failure.  Since this
#    file is sourced, an "exit" here will actually exit src/bin/sage,
#    which is probably not intended.
#  - All environment variables set here should be *exported*, otherwise
#    they won't be available in child programs.

##########################################################################

# SAGE_LOCAL is the installation prefix and can be customized by using
# ./configure --prefix
export SAGE_LOCAL="/home/fbissey/sandbox/git-fork/sage/local"

export CONFIGURED_CC="gcc"

As you can see even though my compiler default to gnu++14, `-std=gnu++11` is added.
