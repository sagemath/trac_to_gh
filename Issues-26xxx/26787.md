We should raise the standard of C++ used to compile Sage to C++11 minimum,
across all standard (and, in time, optional) packages.

This ticket is removing per-package C++ flags and replacing them with the globally set stuff. This is needed to stop package-wise bikeshedding on C++ versions, to make sure not accidentally incompatible C++ ABIs are created.

Yeah but we don't enforce compilation with at least that standard - at least not everywhere. See #25532.

Why should Sage enforce C++11 for every package? I would leave that decision to each package individually.

A number of spkg added `-std=c++11` or `-std=gnu++11` in spkg-*. I removed most of these since by default gnu++11 will be selected. The only exception being `fplll` which enforce c++11 in configure but needs gnu++11 on cygwin. The addition was already redundant in brial since I made the latest version default to at least gnu++11 upstream.

There is also a makefile patch in frobby which I decided not to touch. I'd rather someone interested in the optional frobby package to update the patch next time it needs touching.

It will need testing on cygwin in particular.

I must say I cannot think of a functional difference on top of my head, but that doesn't mean there isn't any. I usually prefer `./configure BLAH=foo ...` because then `BLAH=foo ...` is recorded in `config.log`. While in the other form it isn't. That can make debugging unpleasant when all you are given is `config.log`.

Now I remember why you ask the question. You had a problem with a non autoconf configure script. Anyway there is one important difference.

* in `BLAH=foo ./configure ` you set an environment to run configure.
* in `./configure BLAH=foo ...` `BLAH=foo ...` becomes an argument to configure. Which is why is it is recorded.

In the case you had `BLAH=foo` was actually parsed as a configuration option by the script and because it was a configuration option, prepending it didn't work.

There is also a question what actually happens to `BLAH=foo`  after the `./configure` run.
For some of variables such as `BLAH` the values provided 
are getting stored somewhere, e.g. for `FC` and `CC`.
Is there a list of such stored variables anywhere? E.g. would `FFLAGS` value be stored somewhere?

I think that this is finally the explanation that I asked for.

But that raises the question: why should these flags become part of `CXX` and not `CXXFLAGS`?

By putting it in `CXX` you make your compiler c++11 compliant whether it is called with `CXXFLAGS` (as you should) or not.

>

Then the documentation at https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.html would be wrong. And I don't believe that's the case.
