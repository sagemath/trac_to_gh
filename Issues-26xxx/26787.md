We should raise the standard of C++ used to compile Sage to C++11 minimum,
across all standard (and, in time, optional) packages.

This ticket is removing per-package C++ flags and replacing them with the globally set stuff. This is needed to stop package-wise bikeshedding on C++ versions, to make sure not accidentally incompatible C++ ABIs are created.

Yeah but we don't enforce compilation with at least that standard - at least not everywhere. See #25532.

Why should Sage enforce C++11 for every package? I would leave that decision to each package individually.

There is also a makefile patch in frobby which I decided not to touch. I'd rather someone interested in the optional frobby package to update the patch next time it needs touching.

It will need testing on cygwin in particular.

Now I remember why you ask the question. You had a problem with a non autoconf configure script. Anyway there is one important difference.

* in `BLAH=foo ./configure ` you set an environment to run configure.
* in `./configure BLAH=foo ...` `BLAH=foo ...` becomes an argument to configure. Which is why is it is recorded.

In the case you had `BLAH=foo` was actually parsed as a configuration option by the script and because it was a configuration option, prepending it didn't work.

Yes, that was exactly the thing. (The case in hand was probably flint or mpir, I don't quite recall now).

There is also a question what actually happens to `BLAH=foo`  after the `./configure` run.
For some of variables such as `BLAH` the values provided 
are getting stored somewhere, e.g. for `FC` and `CC`.
Is there a list of such stored variables anywhere? E.g. would `FFLAGS` value be stored somewhere?

But that raises the question: why should these flags become part of `CXX` and not `CXXFLAGS`?

By putting it in `CXX` you make your compiler c++11 compliant whether it is called with `CXXFLAGS` (as you should) or not.

Then the documentation at https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.html would be wrong. And I don't believe that's the case.
