The current implementation of Lie subalgebras confuses two things: the ordering of the basis of the ambient algebra and the ordering of the indices of the ambient algebra. If both orderings agree, then everything works fine:

```
sage: L.<a,b,c> = LieAlgebra(QQ, abelian=True)
sage: I = L.ideal([a+b,a+c])
sage: I.basis()
Family (a + b, a + c)
sage: Q = L.quotient(I)
sage: Q.basis()
Finite family {'a': a}
```
But if there is a mismatch in the ordering, then the output is wrong:

```
sage: L.<c,b,a> = LieAlgebra(QQ, abelian=True)
sage: I2 = L.ideal([a+b,a+c])
sage: I2.basis()
Family (-c + b, c + a)
sage: Q = L.quotient(I2)
sage: Q.basis()
Finite family {'b': b, 'a': a}
```
The difference is

```
sage: [I.lift(X).leading_support() for X in I.basis()]
['b', 'c']
sage: [I2.lift(X).leading_support() for X in I2.basis()]
['c', 'c']
```
That is, the behavior in the latter case is different to what is described in the doc. The indices which are not leading supports of `I2` do not span a complementary subspace, but instead something bigger.

The issue is that currently the computation in `basis` takes its pivot elements based on the ordering of the ambient basis, whereas quotients and reduction assume they can work with `leading_support`, i.e. the ordering of the indices.

I changed the helper methods `_to_m` and `_from_m` to use the ordering of indices instead of the ordering of the basis. At the same time I added support for a custom ordering of indices with an additional `order` keyword to the subalgebra. The previously failing example now works as expected:

```
sage: L.<c,b,a> = LieAlgebra(QQ, abelian=True)
sage: I2 = L.ideal([a+b, a+c])
sage: I2.basis()
Family (b + a, c + a)
sage: Q = L.quotient(I2)
sage: Q.basis()
Finite family {'a': a}
```
The disadvantage is that the submodule computation is now more complicated as things needs to be sorted based on indices. Before the fix:

```
sage: L=LieAlgebra(QQ,3,step=5)
sage: L.dimension()
80
sage: I = L.ideal(L.basis().list()[0])
sage: time I.dimension()
CPU times: user 7.83 s, sys: 4.01 ms, total: 7.83 s
Wall time: 7.82 s
66
```
After the fix:

```
sage: time I.dimension()
CPU times: user 8.82 s, sys: 182 Âµs, total: 8.82 s
Wall time: 8.82 s
66
```
Having the extra functionality of custom orderings is nice, but it would be also good to have also a speed optimized one, where the submodule computation is done without worrying which elements are the pivot elements in the echelon form. In that case the reduction and complementary submodule computation would need special case handling though.

Hmm...I see the problem:

```
sage: L.<a,b,c> = LieAlgebra(QQ, abelian=True)
sage: _.leading_support()
'c'
sage: L.<c,b,a> = LieAlgebra(QQ, abelian=True)
sage: sum(L.lie_algebra_generators()).leading_support()
'c'
```
When I designed this, I was thinking of doing linear algebra directly using the `to_vector`/`from_vector` methods because in those cases, it would be simply (un)wrapping. However, this could be seen as a bug as it does not respect the ordering of `L.indices()`. It might also be better overall to work with actual `vector` objects in general, but I am not sure off-hand.

I am not sure I like having the ideal handle an `order` argument, but it does mean we could have less ambient objects to worry about or create. It probably is the right thing to do overall.

I don't think this is efficient either:

```python
return self.ambient().module().from_vector(vector(R, X_sorted))
```
I would avoid the call `from_vector` (which creates a `dict` and does the dumb, direct computation) and `vector`. I would just do

```python
M = self.ambient().module()
B = M.basis()
return M.sum(R(mc[i]) * b[i] for i in self._reversed_indices if i in mc)
```
You don't even need to create the `X_sorted`.
Similar in `_from_m`.

I would `@cached_method` `leading_monomials`.

Little thing: `trac #26352` -> <code>:trac:\`26352\`</code>

I did not understand what you mean by this.

It is true that `order` is more of a property of the ambient Lie algebra than the ideals. At least that is how it is in the polynomial ring setting. I don't really have a use case where I would want to create ideals in several different orderings on the same Lie algebra, so it would be perfectly fine to move `order` to an optional parameter in `LieAlgebra`. Although if nothing else in the Lie algebra code uses the ordering then it might be a bit unclear what `order` actually effects. But maybe this would be an issue solved by its doc description?

Good call. It cut down the overhead in the previous testcase by a decent amount:

```
sage: L=LieAlgebra(QQ,3,step=5)
sage: I = L.ideal(L.basis().list()[0])
sage: time d=I.dimension()
CPU times: user 8.22 s, sys: 16.1 ms, total: 8.23 s
Wall time: 8.23 s
```
This is still a ~5% increase from prepatch, but not nearly as bad as the earlier 12-17% one.

Added.

The catch with storing this with the ambient Lie algebra is that you have to create a new object for each order. Which is somewhat annoying at the very least. Unfortunately I don't think this is something simply solved by adding/changing stuff in the doc.\n\nAnyways, this fixes a bug and I don't see any other obvious ways to speed this up right now.

I had gotten an impression you were doing some work with the Lie algebra elements instead of their corresponding (typically underlying) `vector`. I guess you are not. Sorry for the noise.

> It is true that `order` is more of a property of the ambient Lie algebra than the ideals. At least that is how it is in the polynomial ring setting. I don't really have a use case where I would want to create ideals in several different orderings on the same Lie algebra, so it would be perfectly fine to move `order` to an optional parameter in `LieAlgebra`. Although if nothing else in the Lie algebra code uses the ordering then it might be a bit unclear what `order` actually effects. But maybe this would be an issue solved by its doc description?


There is some reasons to have this. It might be faster in one order than other or you want different representatives. The catch with storing this with the ambient Lie algebra is that you have to create a new object for each order. Which is somewhat annoying at the very least. Unfortunately I don't think this is something simply solved by adding/changing stuff in the doc.

Anyways, this fixes a bug and I don't see any other obvious ways to speed this up right now. Positive review.

I see your point, will let it be as is.

I removed the orphaned import of `vector` that patchbot found. Setting back to positive review as the code itself was not changed and tests still passed.
