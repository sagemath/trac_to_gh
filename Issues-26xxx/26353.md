You probably want a mechanism to set the real name in the authors field too as otherwise this ticket will get reverted back from a positive review. Should I do the review from the gitlab side or from the Sage side?

That's a good point.  The names would have to match up though (or, I suppose, the release manager can always update the "trusted names" list.
