```markdown
We don't need this special case for Cygwin anymore. openblas and atlas packages should work without special-casing use of the netlib BLAS from Cygwin.

First attempt at merge request synced from gitlab.  A few bugs that happened (which for some reason didn't happen in testing):

1) The post back to gitlab with the link to the ticket did not succeed.  Somehow a typo I didn't have in testing crept in.  I have already fixed that.

2) For reasons I'm not sure, the ticket was created in an invalid state instead of "new".  In fact, the ticket should probably created and immediately set to "needs_review".

The rest seemed to work OK.  It will be good to have a mechanism to set other fields such as component and type, but for now I don't have a mechanism for that and instead assume it should be left up to project maintainers to set those fields.

That's a good point.  The names would have to match up though (or, I suppose, the release manager can always update the "trusted names" list.

> Should I do the review from the gitlab side or from the Sage side?

Whichever you prefer.
