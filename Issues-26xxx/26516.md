No, that `finally` is meant for `libgap_exit`. So you need a nested `try`/`finally`:

```
try:
    sig_on()
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        sig_off
finally:
    libgap_exit()
```
or something like that.

Right. I use "libgap" synonymous to SageMath's libgap wrapper.

Anyway, I am doing things like this:

```
    try:
        G = G.MinimalGeneratingSet().Group()
    except (RuntimeError, ValueError):
        G = G.SmallGeneratingSet().Group()
```
For some of my groups, the attempt to compute a minimal generating set fails, and if I understand correctly, the libgap wrapper would call sig_on(), then kindly ask libgap to compute the minimal generating set, and when this fails would not call sig_off() before raising a Python error.

EDIT: I tested and found that *this* is not giving a sig_on_count() failure. But I am now going through the actual tests of my applications and will hopefully be able to create a minimal example.

Currently, my smallest example triggering sig_on_count to complain is an example in which another library results in an error in an example that previously worked. So, very likely the wrong sig_on/off count comes from there, not from libgap.

Question on the way to proceed:
- Change the topic of this ticket from libgap wrapper to libmtx wrapper?
- Resolve this ticket as "invalid/won't fix" and open a new ticket addressing the libmtx wrapper?

Technical question about sig_on/sig_off, sig_check, and sig_error.

Assume that in the error handler of the libmtx wrapper I call sig_error, similar to what is done in the case of libgap. Would it be needed to henceforth only use sig_on/sig_off, but not sig_check? Namely, when calling sig_error, it is required that sig_on has been called before.

And if that's really the case, then maybe it would be good to know about the use cases of the different sig_* functions. So far, I thought it is like this:
- Use sig_on/sig_off arount a library call that potentially takes a long time.
- Use sig_check when there is a tight loop involving library calls, as that's faster than sig_on/sig_off.
- I didn't know at all about sig_error.

So, is it really the case that I have to accept the slow-down that comes from being forced to use sig_on/off instead of sig_check?

In any case, I realised that I need to go through matrix_gfpn_dense, as there are many library calls that are in fact not wrapped into sig_on/off pairs.

Absolutely.

> And if that's really the case, then maybe it would be good to know about the use cases of the different sig_* functions. So far, I thought it is like this:

That's more or less correct.

> - I didn't know at all about sig_error.

`sig_error` is quite specialized to handle errors from a C library in a callback. But for SharedMeatAxe, this doesn't seem to be needed since it has a way to deal with errors already.

Conclusion: the best solution is probably to wrap errors from SharedMeatAxe as

```
sig_on()
try:
    # MeatAxe call which might raise a Python exception
finally:
    sig_off()
```

-When running doctests in my applications of libgap, sig_on_count reveals problems.
-
-Indeed, in `src/sage/libs/gap/*`, one often sees constructions like the following:
-
-```python
-        try:
-            sig_on()
-            result = libGAP_EQ(self.value, c_other.value)
-            sig_off()
-        except RuntimeError as msg:
-            raise ValueError('libGAP: cannot compare equality: '+str(msg))
-        finally:
-            libgap_exit()
-...
-        try:
-            libgap_enter()
-            sig_on()
-            result = libGAP_SUM(self.value, (<GapElement>right).value)
-            sig_off()
-        except RuntimeError as msg:
-            libGAP_ClearError()
-            raise ValueError('libGAP: '+str(msg))
-        finally:
-            libgap_exit()
-...
-```
-So, sig_off() is only called when no error is raised. But in my applications, I am in fact catching errors raised by libgap. So, maybe it is no surprise that the sig_on/sig_off count got wrong.
-
-Proposed fix: wrap the `sig_off()` in an additional `try`/`finally` block.
+When running doctests in my applications of SharedMeatAxe, `sig_on_count` reveals problems.

Actually, a more important reason is not so much that it's faster but safer too. `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` is really "use this only when you really know what you are doing" while `sig_check()` is pretty foolproof.

In SharedMeatAxe, in contrast to MeatAxe, I am consequently propagating error values, so that a program calling a library function can take proper action when an error occurs. MeatAxe does make it possible to have a custom error handler, which I am using here of course.

Maybe I am misunderstanding the role of sig_*. Namely, the library functions have an error return value, and Cython knows about it (it is declared in the .pxd files). So, a Python error is raised regardless whether sig_on/sig_off is involved or not.

Is it correct that the only added bonus of using sig_on/sig_off is that the user can interrupt with ctrl-c?

OK, in that case I should use

```
sig_on()
try:
    <library call>
finally:
    sig_off()
```
only for functions that potentially run long enough so that it makes sense for them being interruptible.

You should try hard to avoid that as it's unsafe.

There is nothing in particular about `return` statements. There just shouldn't be any kind of Python object manipulation (especially no creation of new Python objects).
