No, that `finally` is meant for `libgap_exit`. So you need a nested `try`/`finally`:

```
try:
    sig_on()
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        sig_off
finally:
    libgap_exit()
```
or something like that.

Can you elaborate on what you mean with that? As far as I know, libgap is a C library, so how could it raise Python exceptions?

Right. I use "libgap" synonymous to SageMath's libgap wrapper.

Anyway, I am doing things like this:

```
    try:
        G = G.MinimalGeneratingSet().Group()
    except (RuntimeError, ValueError):
        G = G.SmallGeneratingSet().Group()
```
For some of my groups, the attempt to compute a minimal generating set fails, and if I understand correctly, the libgap wrapper would call sig_on(), then kindly ask libgap to compute the minimal generating set, and when this fails would not call sig_off() before raising a Python error.

EDIT: I tested and found that *this* is not giving a sig_on_count() failure. But I am now going through the actual tests of my applications and will hopefully be able to create a minimal example.

Actually it seems that the problem rather lies in the SharedMeatAxe wrapper, not in the libgap wrapper. Namely, when wrapped libmtx functions are called, they are encapsulated into sig_on/sig_off, but the wrapper also translates propagated C errors into Python errors. So, presumable when such error is raised, sig_off ought to be called.

Question on the way to proceed:
- Change the topic of this ticket from libgap wrapper to libmtx wrapper?
- Resolve this ticket as "invalid/won't fix" and open a new ticket addressing the libmtx wrapper?

Technical question about sig_on/sig_off, sig_check, and sig_error.

Assume that in the error handler of the libmtx wrapper I call sig_error, similar to what is done in the case of libgap. Would it be needed to henceforth only use sig_on/sig_off, but not sig_check? Namely, when calling sig_error, it is required that sig_on has been called before.

And if that's really the case, then maybe it would be good to know about the use cases of the different sig_* functions. So far, I thought it is like this:
- Use sig_on/sig_off arount a library call that potentially takes a long time.
- Use sig_check when there is a tight loop involving library calls, as that's faster than sig_on/sig_off.
- I didn't know at all about sig_error.

So, is it really the case that I have to accept the slow-down that comes from being forced to use sig_on/off instead of sig_check?

In any case, I realised that I need to go through matrix_gfpn_dense, as there are many library calls that are in fact not wrapped into sig_on/off pairs.

Absolutely.

That's more or less correct.

> - I didn't know at all about sig_error.


`sig_error` is quite specialized to handle errors from a C library in a callback. But for SharedMeatAxe, this doesn't seem to be needed since it has a way to deal with errors already.

Conclusion: the best solution is probably to wrap errors from SharedMeatAxe as

```
sig_on()
try:
    # MeatAxe call which might raise a Python exception
finally:
    sig_off()
```

Actually, a more important reason is not so much that it's faster but safer too. `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` is really "use this only when you really know what you are doing" while `sig_check()` is pretty foolproof.

In SharedMeatAxe, in contrast to MeatAxe, I am consequently propagating error values, so that a program calling a library function can take proper action when an error occurs. MeatAxe does make it possible to have a custom error handler, which I am using here of course.

Maybe I am misunderstanding the role of sig_*. Namely, the library functions have an error return value, and Cython knows about it (it is declared in the .pxd files). So, a Python error is raised regardless whether sig_on/sig_off is involved or not.

Is it correct that the only added bonus of using sig_on/sig_off is that the user can interrupt with ctrl-c?

OK, in that case I should use

```
sig_on()
try:
    <library call>
finally:
    sig_off()
```
only for functions that potentially run long enough so that it makes sense for them being interruptible.

You should try hard to avoid that as it's unsafe.

There is nothing in particular about `return` statements. There just shouldn't be any kind of Python object manipulation (especially no creation of new Python objects).

Good, then I guess the following is bad, as `new_mtx` creates a python object (namely: a !Matrix_gfpn_dense):

```python
        sig_on()
        try:
            mat = MatAlloc(self.Data.Field, self.Data.Nor+other.Data.Nor, self.Data.Noc)
            memcpy(mat.Data, self.Data.Data, FfCurrentRowSize*self.Data.Nor)
            memcpy(MatGetPtr(mat, self.Data.Nor), other.Data.Data, FfCurrentRowSize*other.Data.Nor)
            return new_mtx(mat, self)
        finally:
            sig_off()
```
