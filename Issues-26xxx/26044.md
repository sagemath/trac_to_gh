There are two reasons why we should not have a copy of `six` in `src/mac-app/tools/createDSStore/six.py`:

1. `six` is not actually used by the Mac App.

2. We already ship `six` with Sage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26044

This makes sense to me but I don't have time right now to really test it out: build the app and run it. I am not planning to test with https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg.
