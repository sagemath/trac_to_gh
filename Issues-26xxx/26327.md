Maybe coming from a different order in  python 2

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: Sym._realizations
[Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the powersum basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the monomial basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the elementary basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the Schur basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the homogeneous basis]
```
versus python3:

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
sage: Sym._realizations
[Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the monomial basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the homogeneous basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the powersum basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the elementary basis,
 Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the Schur basis]
```
