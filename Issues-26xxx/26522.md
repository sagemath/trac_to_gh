(split off of #26449)

With a Python 3 build of Sage, Sphinx omits large chunks of the autodoc documentation. It seems to be related to classes which inherit from `ClasscallMetaclass` and which also have class-level docstrings. For example, if I have this:

```
class Test1(ClasscallMetaclass):
    def A(self):
        """
        documentation for A
        """
        pass

class Test2(ClasscallMetaclass):
    """
    class-level docstring
    """
    def B(self):
        """
        documentation for B
        """
        pass
```
then Sphinx will produce output looking like this:

```
class sage.algebras.commutative_dga.Test1
    Bases: sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass

    A()
        documentation for A

sage.algebras.commutative_dga.Test2

    class-level docstring
```
`Test1` is properly documented, but `Test2` is missing documentation for the methods; furthermore, it doesn't say "class" at the beginning and does not list the base class.

Classes which inherit from other classes, say `WithEqualitybyId`, work just fine.

This is probably what @jhpalmieri was indicating. Under `Special Methods for Classes`

Correct doc

```
class sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass
Bases: sage.misc.nested_class.NestedClassMetaclass

A metaclass providing support for special methods for classes.
```

Incorrect with python3

```
 sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass

    A metaclass providing support for special methods for classes.
```
And perhaps other places.

For another illustration, navigate in the reference manual by choosing `Categories` and then `Sets`. The documentation for the class `Sets` in the Python 2 build includes lots of methods (for example

This is what actually causes the documentation to fail to build with Python 3: a cross-reference to "facade-sets" points to [what becomes omitted](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/sets_cat.html#sage.categories.sets_cat.Sets.SubcategoryMethods.Facade) in the Python 3 build of the documentation.
