I know there is a version 1.68.0 but this one has been sitting on my drive uncompleted for a while due to other stuff.
What's more 1.66.0 introduce new library naming which may break other stuff. It may have been safer to go 1.65.0.

The points of this ticket are
* harmonise the version of boost and boost_cropped which are currently different (1.61/1.58)
* boost won't build properly with clang on linux and gcc on OS X for that matter. So fixing that (cross finger)
