Towers of finite fields are hard to work with because they lose most of the nice functionality of simple extensions of prime finite fields and are also much slower.

Therefore it would be useful to have a method that turns a tower into a simple extension.

Note that there have been attempts to support relative extensions of finite fields in #21413 and that there is also `sage.coding.relative_finite_field_extension`, the state of which is unclear to me. There is also `_isomorphic_ring` on polynomial quotient rings which does something similar so this should probably be unified for finite fields.

Without proper support for morphisms with base_morphisms, the output is slightly ugly:

```
sage: k = GF(2)
sage: R.<a> = k[]
sage: l.<a> = k.extension(a^3 + a^2 + 1)
sage: l.absolute_field()
(Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3, Composite map:
   From: Finite Field in a of size 2^3
   To:   Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
   Defn:   Ring morphism:
           From: Finite Field in a of size 2^3
           To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Finite Field of size 2 (using GF2X)
           Defn: a |--> a
         then
           Ring morphism:
           From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Finite Field of size 2 (using GF2X)
           To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
           Defn: Induced from base ring by
                 Composite map:
                   From: Finite Field of size 2
                   To:   Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
                   Defn:   Identity endomorphism of Finite Field of size 2
                         then
                           Ring morphism:
                           From: Finite Field of size 2
                           To:   Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
                           Defn: 1 |--> 1
         then
           Ring morphism:
           From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
           To:   Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
           Defn: a |--> z3^2 + 1, Ring morphism:
   From: Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
   To:   Finite Field in a of size 2^3
   Defn: z3 |--> a^2 + a)
```

Unfortunately, this does not work yet if we add another extension on top:

```
sage: R.<b> = l[]
sage: m.<b> = l.extension(b^2 + b + a)
sage: m.absolute_field()
AttributeError: no attribute absolute_field
```

The problem is that even though `m` is in the category of finite fields, it does not inherit the parent methods for some reason.

 Therefore it would be useful to have a method that turns a tower into a simple extension.
 
-Note that there have been attempts to support relative extensions of finite fields in #21413 and that there is also `sage.coding.relative_finite_field_extension`, the state of which is unclear to me.
+Note that there have been attempts to support relative extensions of finite fields in #21413 and that there is also `sage.coding.relative_finite_field_extension`, the state of which is unclear to me. There is also `_isomorphic_ring` on polynomial quotient rings which does something similar so this should probably be unified for finite fields.
