We have

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ)
sage: parent(binomial(x, 2))
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```
But

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: parent(binomial(x, 2))
Symbolic Ring
```
Note that the global `binomial` function is to blame as

```
sage: type(sage.arith.misc.binomial(x,2))
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

Well, the problem is that anyway the polynomial is first converted to SR, then one makes the binomial, then one converts back to the original ring. **EURK**.

The last step fails for ZZ[x], because the result is usually not in ZZ[x] but in QQ[x] !
