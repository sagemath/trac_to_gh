Apparently that file directly uses cypari c-bindings instead of the `libs/pari.py` interface (where the `nthreads` option is added).

Why isn't `libs/pari.py` used?\n\n\nAssignee: **@embray**\n\nCC:  @antonio-rojas @jdemeyer @kiwifb @dimpase @saraedum @embray\n\nKeywords: **docbuild, pari**\n\n_Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26608_\n\n",

This ticket is a followup to [this sage-packaging discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-packaging/VU4h8IWGFLA). To summarize:

sage does not work together with pari's threading. Instead of relying on it being compiled without threading, I made use of the "nthreads" option to disable threading at runtime in #26002.

However since #24655 (unconditionally enabling threaded docbuild), the docbuild segfaults when pari is compiled with threading support. Apparently sage somehow uses pari while ignoring the `nthread` option. We get the following backtrace ([provided](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-packaging/VU4h8IWGFLA/rU-8NCPjBgAJ) by Antonio with an older version of sage):

That shows us that `src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx` is involved. Apparently that file directly uses cypari c-bindings instead of the `libs/pari.py` interface (where the `nthreads` option is added). For example:

```
def LLL_gram(self, flag = 0):
    if self._nrows != self._ncols:
        raise ArithmeticError("self must be a square matrix")

    n = self.nrows()
    # maybe should be /unimodular/ matrices ?
    P = self.__pari__()
    try:
        U = P.qflllgram(flag)
    except (RuntimeError, ArithmeticError) as msg:
        raise ValueError("qflllgram failed, "
                         "perhaps the matrix is not positive definite")
    if U.matsize() != [n, n]:
        raise ValueError("qflllgram did not return a square matrix, "
                         "perhaps the matrix is not positive definite");
    MS = matrix_space.MatrixSpace(ZZ,n)
    U = MS(U.sage())
    # Fix last column so that det = +1
    if U.det() == -1:
        for i in range(n):
            U[i,n-1] = - U[i,n-1]
    return U
```

Can someone more familiar with cython and cypari tell if the options defined in `libs/pari.py` would apply here? Why isn't `libs/pari.py` used?

I think there's a little bit of misinformation / misconception here.

There's nothing about Sage's docbuild program that uses multi-threading.  It uses a process pool and builds each sub-document in separate processes.

(There are some cases where it does not run builds in subprocesses when it probably should, and I think that is contributing somewhat to the explosion of memory usage in the docbuild, but that's a separate issue).

I read on the mailing list post "It is called indirectly via matplotlib when rendering plots, see full backtrace below (btw, I had to downgrade to an old version of Sage to get a meaningful backtrace - I really dislike this trend of hiding build output, it makes it very hard to debug stuff)"

I had a very similar problem to this; it actually came from the BLAS library by way of a Numpy ufunc (I think for the "dot" product of a matrix in a vector, or two matrices).  I feel like I actually fixed this but now I can't remember.

I don't think it's related, because this only showed up when we patched fflas-ffpack to allow configuring the number of threads to use with openblas (by default it just sets it to 1).  But conceivably there's a similar bug elsewhere.  Possibly related to fork().  I have found many bugs in different projects related to threads/fork interaction.

You know what though--I'm looking at the relevant code in openblas, and `openblas_set_num_threads(1)` might actually cause it to spin up a single thread (beyond the main thread) which is actually good enough to invoke the bug I fixed.  I'm going to try to confirm that though.

I don't think that PARI uses BLAS in any way.

I'm also betting on this. PARI might setup some data structures related to threading (when compiled with threading support) which are invalid when running in a forked child process.

We get the following backtrace ([provided](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-packaging/VU4h8IWGFLA/rU-8NCPjBgAJ) by Antonio with an older version of sage):

+
+That shows us that `src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx` is involved. Apparently that file directly uses cypari c-bindings instead of the `libs/pari.py` interface (where the `nthreads` option is added). For example:
+
+```
+def LLL_gram(self, flag = 0):
+    if self._nrows != self._ncols:
+        raise ArithmeticError("self must be a square matrix")

+    P = self.__pari__()

+    except (RuntimeError, ArithmeticError) as msg:
+        raise ValueError("qflllgram failed, "
+                         "perhaps the matrix is not positive definite")
+    if U.matsize() != [n, n]:
+        raise ValueError("qflllgram did not return a square matrix, "
+                         "perhaps the matrix is not positive definite");
+    MS = matrix_space.MatrixSpace(ZZ,n)
+    U = MS(U.sage())
+    # Fix last column so that det = +1
+    if U.det() == -1:
+        for i in range(n):
+            U[i,n-1] = - U[i,n-1]
+    return U
+```
+
+Can someone more familiar with cython and cypari tell if the options defined in `libs/pari.py` would apply here? Why isn't `libs/pari.py` used?

Yes, I think you must be right.  PARI has its own thread management, and it does not implement any pthread_atfork handler that I can find, which is strong cause to suspect it...

Some PARI notes regarding threading:

* Setting `--mt=pthread` in PARI's Configure script results in it compiling a test file called `config/pthread.c`, and if that succeeds it sets a variable `thread_engine=pthread` and `enable_tls=yes`, and should print "Using mt engine pthread" (similar result if you use mpi, but for now I'm just looking at pthread). 

* This also outputs the macro `#define PARI_MT_ENGINE "pthread"` in the generated `paricfg.h`.
  * In `src/language/paricfg.c` it sets a global constant `const char *paricfg_mt_engine = PARI_MT_ENGINE;`.  This is only used when printing the version info like

    ```
    $ gp --version
                                            GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version 2.11.1 (released)
                                    amd64 running linux (x86-64/GMP-6.0.0 kernel) 64-bit version
                              compiled: Aug  7 2019, gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.4)
                                                      threading engine: pthread
                                           (readline v6.3 disabled, extended help enabled)
```

* In the generated `Makefile` this also adds some bits, such as `MT_LIBS=-lpthread`, the file `parimt.h` contains the contents of `src/mt/pthread.h`, and the module `src/mt/pthread.c` which implements an standard interface (including the `pari_mt_init` function), is built, alongside some generic code in `src/mt/mt.c`
  * If instead we'd had `--mt=single` (the default) it would compile `src/mt/single.c` which implements the same interfaces, mostly as no-ops (its `pari_mt_init` just sets the global variable `pari_mt_nbthreads = 1`).

* In `src/mt/pthread.c` there is a global pointer declared `static struct mt_pstate *pari_mt`.  This is a pointer to a `struct mt_pstate` which contains several variables related to the state of pari's thread pool, including pointers to the threads themselves.
  * When functions like `mt_queue_start()` or `mt_queue_start_lim()` (which `mt_queue_start()` is just a wrapper for) it initializes one of these `mt_pstate` structs, and sets the global `pari_mt` to point to it. 
  * The global `pari_mt` is also referenced in `mt_queue_reset()`.
  * `pari_mt` also contains a reference to one mutex, which is used when calling `mt_queue_get` to synchronize access to per-thread results in such a way that it blocks until a result is available (but also allows interruption by sigint).

<a id='comment:32'>Comment 32:</a>
Managed to reproduce the problem again by doing a parallel docbuild after building PARI with `--mt=pthread`, which eventually gives a segfault.

Unfortunately the `build_many` function doesn't give us any info on the traceback from the original exception, so I added the following patch to the docbuild code so it would at least print the traceback:

With that, I get a long traceback (much of which is stuff in Sphinx that isn't interesting). But as previously reported--and unsurprisingly--the segfault originates from some code for a plot:

Here it's probably building the reference docs for `sage.categories.finite_coxeter_groups` which contains a plot using `CoxeterGroup.permutahedron()`, which in turn much further down happens to use PARI to compute some complex roots of a polynomial.

It looks like it's not actually reaching the `polroots()` call before crashing somewhere down in converting the polynomial coeffs to PARI values...?

The `nffactor` function in PARI ("Factorization of the univariate polynomial (or rational function) T over the number field nf") internally uses a parallel Chinese remainder routine in the internal function `polint_chinese`.  This results in a thread pool being launched.  This is being called at some point during the categories reference doc build.

On a wild guess, I tried switching the docbuild to use my `multiprocessing.Pool` replacement from #27490 (this is on Linux), and the crashes no longer occur.

The major difference is that in `multiprocessing.Pool`, each docbuild subprocess is forked from a separate thread from the main thread, whereas in my replacement they're just forked directly from the main thread.

Somehow this alone is enough to leave some structures in PARI in a bad state, and only if it was built with multithreading support in the first place (apparently).

Going back to comment [comment:30], if `--mt=pthread` then a variable in PARI's `Configure`, `enable_tls="yes"` is set.  This in turns leads to defining a macro in `paricfg.h` called `ENABLE_TLS`.

The only effect of `ENABLE_TLS` is in `src/headers/parisys.h`:

```
#ifdef ENABLE_TLS
#  define THREAD __thread
#else
#  define THREAD
#endif
```

So variables in PARI declared `THREAD` use TLS in this case.  This alone could be enough to suspect strange behavior in PARI when it's forked from a thread...

In principle it's not just limited to docbuilds:  The broader problem, for which I would like to find a better resolution, is that the cypari2 `Pari` instances are simply not thread-safe.  A more general approach would be if Sage's single `Pari` instance were actually thread-local.

As it is, Sage doesn't use threads for much of anything, whether in the tests, or in general, so the problem arises primarily in the docbuild.

But this can cause problems for *anyone* who carelessly tries to use `multiprocessing.Pool`, or threads in general, in Sage* :(



!* If they do anything in those threads that happens to use PARI.

Closing this ticket for now, since the immediate problem (Sage's docbuild) has been worked around by #28356.  The broader issue still should have a ticket to track it, even if it won't be resolved any time soon, so I have opened #28800.
