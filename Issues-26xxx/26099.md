All other functions always returns a pair when `certificate=True`, i.e.

`x.foo() == x.foo(certificate=True)[0]`

Change to this convention is possible, but should be discussed in sage-devel.

I suppose this also conflicts with #26095 because of a cross-link.

But just this is what I am saying. You only need to check *one* chain of a maximum cardinality, not all of them. But your code does not do that, it tries to found some maximal chain, not necessarily of the max cardinality.

OK. Could this be just

`self.is_extremal() and all(self.is_left_modular_element(e) for e in self.height(certificate=True)[1])`
