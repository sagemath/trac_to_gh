All other functions always returns a pair when `certificate=True`, i.e.

`x.foo() == x.foo(certificate=True)[0]`

Change to this convention is possible, but should be discussed in sage-devel.

I suppose this also conflicts with #26095 because of a cross-link.

Right. I am also using a result of https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.10123, saying that in a trim lattice, left modular elements are exactly the elements that belong to the spine (union of all chains of maximum length).

OK. Could this be just

`self.is_extremal() and all(self.is_left_modular_element(e) for e in self.height(certificate=True)[1])`
