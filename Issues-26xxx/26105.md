Currently, the method `.hom(im_gens)` on parents allows you to define the images of the generators of a structure. This is assuming that the coefficients of these generators can be sent to the codomain with some canonical coercion.

This is often insufficient, e.g., in the case of polynomial rings where you would also like to define a map that translate the ring of coefficients non-canonically. Note that function fields already have a specialized `.hom()` implementation that supports this feature.

See #26103 for a followup.

The problem with `im_gens` is that it's not really mathematically defined in the first place. So I wouldn't try to add more functionality to it.

Instead, I would define a specific morphism class for polynomial rings. Mathematically, a ring morphism from a polynomial ring is defined by a morphism of the base together with the images of the generators. That was my plan for #25558 but I stopped working on that...

Polynomial rings are just one example. Another one (see #26103) are extensions, say an extension of a finite field where I would like to define a map `k(α)→l`.

But I think I also had this issue with fraction fields before.

I agree, that specialized morphism classes can be nice because they might have more knowledge about the objects involved (say to implement is_injective()/is_surjective()) but I don't want to implement a new class whenever I need a map between new types of parents and generic code might do that as well.

Maybe I'll just use a `SetMorphism` if I shouldn't extend `hom()` though I personally don't like these.

Anyway, let me give a try at extending `hom()` and see what the result looks like.

But this is really a map induced by a polynomial ring map `k[x] → l`. We already have a class for such maps induced on a quotient, so we just need the polynomial ring map.

I am not sure I understand. If k is not a prime field, then how would I would I define my map `k[x]→l`?

By giving a map `k → l` and the image of `x`.

If `k` is not a prime finite field, then use recursion: `k = f[α]`, so `k → l` is induced by a map `f[x] → l`.

A similar problem occurs with Lie algebras:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: cc = K.hom([-i])
sage: L.<X,Y,Z,W> = LieAlgebra(K, {('X','Y'): {'Z':i}, ('X','Z'): {'W':1}})
sage: M.<A,B,C,D> = LieAlgebra(K, {('A','B'): {'C':i}, ('A','C'): {'D':1}})
sage: phi = L.morphism({X:A, Y:B, Z:C, W:D}, base_map=cc)
```

The last line should raise an error since `phi` is not a Lie Algebra morphism:

```
sage: phi(X.bracket(Y))
-i*C
sage: phi(X).bracket(phi(Y))
i*C
```

In the same fashion, if I define:

```
sage: phi = L.morphism({X:A,Y:B,W:D}, base_map=cc)
```

I expect `Z` to be mapped to `-C` but this is not the case:

```
sage: phi(Z)
C
```

There are still issues with Lie algebra:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: K.<i> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: cc = K.hom([-i])
sage: L.<X,Y,Z> = LieAlgebra(K, {('X','Y'): {'Z':i}})
sage: M.<A,B,C> = LieAlgebra(K, {('A','B'): {'C':-i}})
sage: phi = L.morphism({X:A, Y:B, Z:C}, base_map=cc)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: this does not define a Lie algebra morphism; contradictory values for brackets of length 2
```

but I think that `phi` is a well-defined semi-linear morphism of Lie algebras.

The checking is performed in the `__init__` function of `LieAlgebraMorphism_from_generators` (starting at line 474 of `src/sage/algebras/lie_algebras/morphism.py`).
