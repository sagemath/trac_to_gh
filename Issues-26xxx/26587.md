The base of an exponential growth element can be any number, but indeed it should only be a positive number and its argument should be dealt with in a separate way (as this does not contribute to the growth, but still distinguishes different elements, e.g. `(-2)^n` and `2^n`. As a consequence, the sorting of the terms in an asymptotic expansion is not correct and as one wanted.

E.g. one might get something

```
3/32*(-1)^n*n^(-4) + 3/8*(-1)^n*n^(-5) + O((-1)^n*n^(-6)) + (-1/27*I*sqrt(3) + 1/27)*(-zeta3 - 1)^n*n^(-3) + (-1/9*I*sqrt(3) + 1/3)*(-zeta3 - 1)^n*n^(-4) + O((-zeta3 - 1)^n*n^(-5)) + 133/72*n + 7/12*log(n) + 7/12*euler_gamma - 1/6*a0*(I*sqrt(3) + 1) - 1/6*a1*(-I*sqrt(3) + 1) - 1/4*a2 - 23/6 - 11/36*n^(-1) + O(n^(-2)) + (1/27*I*sqrt(3) + 1/27)*zeta3^n*n^(-3) + (1/9*I*sqrt(3) + 1/3)*zeta3^n*n^(-4) + O(zeta3^n*n^(-5))
```
