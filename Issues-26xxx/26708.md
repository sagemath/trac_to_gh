Done in this ticket:
- avoid a useless sorting in `connected_components_sizes`
- replace `.edges()` with `.edge_iterator()` or `.edges(sort=False)` whenever possible
- change the internal vertex to integer mapping in `TriconnectivitySPQR` to avoid `.vertices`. This affects the order in which components are found / output, so some doctests had to be changed
- remaining calls to `.vertices` are only in doctests
- remaining calls to `.edges` that are not in doctests are all with `sort=False`.
- add missing doctests. coverage is now 100%
