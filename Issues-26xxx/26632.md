1. correct the behavior of the method for digraphs. Before, `M[i, j]` was either the distance from i to j or the distance from j to i. It is now the shortest path distance from i to j.
2. add parameter `vertices` to specify the mapping vertices to consecutive integers
3. allow to specify the parameters of method `distance_all_pairs`

To get the correct links, you probably want `:meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.foo`` as `GenericGraph` is not imported into the global namespace; although since it within that class, I think you can just do `:meth:`foo``.

LGTM otherwise and you can set a positive review once fixed.

For the link, the form `:meth:`foo`` is working properly. I'm regularly building the html doc to check.
