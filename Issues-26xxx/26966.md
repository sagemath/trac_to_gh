I don't know if this branch is the correct approach, but it helps. If it is the correct approach, it is incomplete: at #26966, I included a list of some of the methods which need attention paid to how vertices are sorted:

- product
- join
- disjoint_union
- wedge
- connected_sum
- link
- star
- generated_subcomplex
- alexander_dual
- stellar_subdivision
- n_skeleton
- connected_component
- fixed_complex
- intersection
- `_contractible_subcomplex`
- `_enlarge_subcomplex`
- `__copy__`

This list may not be complete, and the branch here only deals with a few of these.

I don't think we should impose restrictions on what users might choose to do. We can choose good defaults for the specific examples (like `MooreSpace`), but if someone wants to form a disjoint union from a complex whose vertices are integers with another whose vertices are strings, we should allow that.

I didn't say that we should. I'm just saying that, if the user does that, they have to explicitly specify the sorting key. Otherwise, it's too fragile (for example, code will behave *differently* on Python 2 and Python 3).

Let me ask an even more basic question: why do we need to sort anything at all? If it's not to hard to drop that, we should go for it. Especially if it's meant to be internal as you say, there shouldn't be a fundamental reason why vertices need to be sorted.

I don't know a minimal example, but if you turn off sorting, then the homology of `simplicial_complexes.ComplexProjectivePlane()` is wrong. That is:

```
S = SimplicialComplex([[1, 2, 4, 5, 6], [2, 3, 5, 6, 4], [3, 1, 6, 4, 5],
         [1, 2, 4, 5, 9], [2, 3, 5, 6, 7], [3, 1, 6, 4, 8],
         [2, 3, 6, 4, 9], [3, 1, 4, 5, 7], [1, 2, 5, 6, 8],
         [3, 1, 5, 6, 9], [1, 2, 6, 4, 7], [2, 3, 4, 5, 8],
         [4, 5, 7, 8, 9], [5, 6, 8, 9, 7], [6, 4, 9, 7, 8],
         [4, 5, 7, 8, 3], [5, 6, 8, 9, 1], [6, 4, 9, 7, 2],
         [5, 6, 9, 7, 3], [6, 4, 7, 8, 1], [4, 5, 8, 9, 2],
         [6, 4, 8, 9, 3], [4, 5, 9, 7, 1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 2],
         [7, 8, 1, 2, 3], [8, 9, 2, 3, 1], [9, 7, 3, 1, 2],
         [7, 8, 1, 2, 6], [8, 9, 2, 3, 4], [9, 7, 3, 1, 5],
         [8, 9, 3, 1, 6], [9, 7, 1, 2, 4], [7, 8, 2, 3, 5],
         [9, 7, 2, 3, 6], [7, 8, 3, 1, 4], [8, 9, 1, 2, 5]],
        sort_facets=False)
S.homology()
```
produces the wrong answer: `{0: 0, 1: 0, 2: C2, 3: 0, 4: 0}` instead of `{0: 0, 1: 0, 2: Z, 3: 0, 4: Z}`.

Well, that's a problem. If things rely on sorting, then allowing the sort to fail is bad.

I much prefer either always sorting or never sorting to this "compromise" of trying to sort.

"Bad" is a bit strong. The answers can vary if the order varies (as will happen if the vertices are unsorted), but the answers will still be mathematically correct.
 
> I much prefer either always sorting or never sorting to this "compromise" of trying to sort.


How much work should be put into this? You don't like it when I add a fallback to sort using `str`, so what do you suggest? And note that the compromise works pretty well. In practice, most simplicial complexes will have sortable vertices (either integers or tuples of integers). With the current branch, there are only two doctests with unpredictable results in Python 3: the one in `simplicial_set.py` now marked "random", and this:

```
            sage: G = (S1.wedge(S1)).flip_graph()
            sage: G.vertices(); G.edges(labels=False) # py2
            [(0, 'L1'), (0, 'L2'), (0, 'R1'), (0, 'R2'), ('L1', 'L2'), ('R1', 'R2')]
            [((0, 'L1'), (0, 'L2')),
             ((0, 'L1'), (0, 'R1')),
             ((0, 'L1'), (0, 'R2')),
             ((0, 'L1'), ('L1', 'L2')),
             ((0, 'L2'), (0, 'R1')),
             ((0, 'L2'), (0, 'R2')),
             ((0, 'L2'), ('L1', 'L2')),
             ((0, 'R1'), (0, 'R2')),
             ((0, 'R1'), ('R1', 'R2')),
             ((0, 'R2'), ('R1', 'R2'))]
```
With Python 3, the vertices may be ordered randomly, and the same with the edges. Not a big deal, I think.

Not guaranteed to be consistent either, since `str()` does not have to be an injective function:

```
sage: L1 = [1.0 + 2^-52, 1.0]; L2 = reversed(L1)
sage: sorted(L1, key=str) == sorted(L2, key=str)
False
```

And to confirm, if I create a simplicial complex with vertices with nonunique string representations and sort always using `key=str`, the diagonal map can break. With my own branch which sorts exclusively by str:

```
sage: K = SimplicialComplex([[1.0 + 2^-52, 1.0]])
sage: L = K.product(K)
sage: d = Hom(K,L).diagonal_morphism()
sage: d.associated_chain_complex_morphism()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: matrices must define a chain complex morphism
```

Edit: this case is actually worse because in the product `L`, the vertices are named using string representations, so there is only one vertex, not four, as there should be. (Each vertex is named `'L1.00000000000000R1.00000000000000'`, and since they all have the same name, they are viewed as the same vertex.) You can avoid this as follows:

```
sage: K = SimplicialComplex([[1.0 + 2^-52, 1.0]])
sage: L = K.product(K, rename_vertices=False)
sage: d = Hom(K,L).diagonal_morphism(rename_vertices=False)
sage: d.associated_chain_complex_morphism()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: matrices must define a chain complex morphism
```
Now the names of the vertices cause bad sorting, and so the purported map `d` does not induce a chain map as it should. This is the same problem that arises with other complexes if we don't sort at all.

I think you are confusing two kinds of sorting introduced by this ticket.

One is the sorting using `vertex_to_index` which is perfectly fine. It allows consistent ordering of vertices which is indeed required for homology computations.

The sorting that I object to is this one:

```
        try:
            # If vertices can be sorted, sort them.
            vertices = tuple(sorted(vertices))
        except TypeError:
            pass
```
This shouldn't be needed for anything. It also adds (rather than solves) problems with porting to Python 3 since this code behaves differently on Python 2 and Python 3.

Some minor comments:

Instead of `lambda x: vertex_to_index[x]`, you can use `vertex_to_index.__getitem__` (which I believe is faster).

Also, this `try` block is if the `max` is empty, right:

```diff
        try:
            idx = max(vertex_to_index.values()) + 1
        except ValueError:
            idx = 0
```
so you should be able to do this:

```python
        if vertex_to_index:
            idx = max(vertex_to_index.values()) + 1
        else:
            idx = 0
```

I would pull out the `self._translation_to_numeric()` call here so it is not called on every `key` call:

```
simplex = Simplex(sorted(face, key=lambda x: self._translation_to_numeric()[x]))
```

I think the latter syntax is easier to read (IIRC, it is also a little faster too):

```diff
-dict((g, i) for i, g in enumerate(gens))
+{g: i for i, g in enumerate(gens)}
```
You might also be able to simply do `dict(enumerate(gens))` too.

Sure, sounds good.

> - In `product`, is there some way we can avoid creating two simplicial complexes? I imagine it is slower to do it twice. Why not for the first case return the simplicial complex and for the second use the `facets`?


Yes. I think when I first wrote this, I was going to use something produced by the `__init__` method and so I was constructing the simplicial complex to avoid code duplication. That doesn't seem to be the case any more, so you're right, I can just use `facets` in the second case.
