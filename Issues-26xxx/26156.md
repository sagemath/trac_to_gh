sage: RR(0).str(digits=3)
'0.000'
```

This is trivial to fix, but then it causes hundreds of doctest failures since every real zero is printed with one less digit. To compensate for this, we add one extra digit for 0.0 in the default case.

On the other hand, do you really care whether it's `0.000000000000000` or `0.00000000000000`? What's important is that the number of digits is correct when you specifically ask for a given number of digits.
