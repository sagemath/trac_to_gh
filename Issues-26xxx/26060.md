Up to Sage 8.7 this limit returns "und" for "undefined":

```python
sage: limit(x / (x + 2^x + cos(x)), x=-infinity)
und
```
while it should clearly be 1.

SymPy returns the correct result:

```python
sage: limit(x / (x+2^x + cos(x)), x=-infinity, algorithm='sympy')
1
```

Reported to Maxima on 2018-08-15
as [Maxima bug 3459](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3459/),
fixed there
by [Maxima commit 0c5c018](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/0c5c0187338060761746fbd0821ce5f28b3245cd/)
on 2018-08-30, fix included
in [Maxima 5.42.2](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/master/tree/ChangeLog-5.42.md)
to which we upgrade in #26625, merged in Sage 8.8.beta7.

In Sage >= 8.8 we get the correct value for this limit:

```python
sage: limit(x / (x + 2^x + cos(x)), x=-infinity)
1
```

This ticket adds a doctest for that limit computation.

Depends on #26625
