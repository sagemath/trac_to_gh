For a number field element, `x[i]` returns the coefficient of `x` when written as a polynomial in the generator of the number field.

For p-adics, it currently returns the coefficient in the Ï€-adic expansion.

A deprecation warning has been introduced in #14825 to change the behaviour of p-adic elements.

See also #26408, #13300.
