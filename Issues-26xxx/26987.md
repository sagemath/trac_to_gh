On some patchbots, I see this:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/gap.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/interfaces/gap.py", line 1351, in sage.interfaces.gap.Gap.help
Failed example:
    print(gap.help('SymmetricGroup', pager=False))
Expected:
    <BLANKLINE>
      50.1-... SymmetricGroup
    <BLANKLINE>
      ‣ SymmetricGroup( [filt, ]deg ) ─────────────────────────────────── function
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
      50.1-10 SymmetricGroup
    <BLANKLINE>
      > SymmetricGroup( [filt, ]deg ) ----------------------------------- function
[..many more lines..]
```

This seems to be a matter of unicode output or not.

Please provide a link to the full log. It is not clear whether "many more lines" mean more errors or not.

For this particular one I am inclined just to add more `...`

I don't think Sage must produce the same output for different locales, or whatever the real reason for this discrepancy is (perhaps just a patchbot bug).

This is with 8.6.rc0 - it would be more interesting to see rc1, where more GAP 4.10 is merged.

So you consider a patchbot environment broken if it doesn't support UTF-8? We generally try to support UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 locales in Sage doctests.

And if you're really convinced that it's a patchbot problem, this bug should be closed as "workforme", not downgraded to "minor".

It's obviously not a blocker if it's just a trivial formatting issue in some test that can be fixed by setting the locale on your system.

I do think *something* should be done about this though so closing it as "worksforme" would be equally reactionary.  Whether it's just adding `...` in those tests (fine by me), or as I suggested above fixing the locale either in the tests, the doctest runner, or the patchbot (I don't have an opinion about which would be most appropriate), or whether we should actually force a locale on GAP when initializing libgap.

To clarify, in this case the test in question is only affected by the pexpect interface.  So the output from GAP in that case is going to depend on the environment passed when starting gap.
