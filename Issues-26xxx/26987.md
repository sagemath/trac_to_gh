On some patchbots, I see this:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/gap.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/interfaces/gap.py", line 1351, in sage.interfaces.gap.Gap.help
Failed example:
    print(gap.help('SymmetricGroup', pager=False))
Expected:
    <BLANKLINE>
      50.1-... SymmetricGroup
    <BLANKLINE>
      ‣ SymmetricGroup( [filt, ]deg ) ─────────────────────────────────── function
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
      50.1-10 SymmetricGroup
    <BLANKLINE>
      > SymmetricGroup( [filt, ]deg ) ----------------------------------- function
[..many more lines..]
```

This seems to be a matter of unicode output or not.

Please provide a link to the full log. It is not clear whether "many more lines" mean more errors or not.

For this particular one I am inclined just to add more `...`

I don't think Sage must produce the same output for different locales, or whatever the real reason for this discrepancy is (perhaps just a patchbot bug).

This is with 8.6.rc0 - it would be more interesting to see rc1, where more GAP 4.10 is merged.

So you consider a patchbot environment broken if it doesn't support UTF-8? We generally try to support UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 locales in Sage doctests.

And if you're really convinced that it's a patchbot problem, this bug should be closed as "workforme", not downgraded to "minor".

It's obviously not a blocker if it's just a trivial formatting issue in some test that can be fixed by setting the locale on your system.

I do think *something* should be done about this though so closing it as "worksforme" would be equally reactionary.
