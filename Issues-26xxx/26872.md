- [Ask Sage question 44623: Norm in UniversalCyclotomicField](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/44623)

For abs, we need to implement `__abs__` for elements of the universal
cyclotomic field; it could be computed as the square root of `z * z.conjugate()`
or of `z.real()**2 + z.imag()**2`, or by using `to_cyclotomic_field`, or by
changing ring to `QQbar`.

Depends on #26875
