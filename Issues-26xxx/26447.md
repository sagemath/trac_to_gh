Ok, so this is a working proposal: sort if possible. Not breaking any doctest on python2.

EDIT: and improving a lot of things on the python3 side !

I did several tests and it's working well except when the list has more vertices than the graph. This particular case could be tested at low cost, no ?

In all other cases, when the given list is not good, an error is raised somewhere. 

```python
sage: from sage.graphs.base.static_sparse_backend import StaticSparseCGraph
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: S = StaticSparseCGraph(G, vertex_list=range(10))
sage: S = StaticSparseCGraph(G, vertex_list=range(10)[::-1])
sage: S.verts()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
sage: S = StaticSparseCGraph(G, vertex_list=range(20)) ### should we care ??
sage: S.verts()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
sage:
sage: S = StaticSparseCGraph(G, vertex_list=range(5))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
