<a id='comment:11'></a>In general I agree with this change. However, I have the following concern:
- the description of parameter `vertex_list` must be extended. It should be explained that if it is given, the ordering induced by this vertex_list is used to map vertices to integers.
- What if vertex_list is not a list but a set, dict, etc. ?
- What if vertex_list has length less than `G.order()`. In particular, we must check that `set(vertex_list) == set(G.vertices())`.
- Specific doctests are required.

Question: in the declaration of method `init_short_digraph` in file `static_sparse_graph.pxd`, you use `vertex_list = ?`. Shouldn't it be `vertex_list=?` to comply with PEP8 ?
