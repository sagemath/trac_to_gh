This hash is parallel to the behaviour of `__eq__` in the same class.

I think that it's not enough to compare the string representation of the printer.
For example:

```
sage: A.<pi> = Zp(2, print_mode='bars', print_sep='|').extension(x^3 - 2)
sage: B.<pi> = Zp(2, print_mode='bars', print_sep='#').extension(x^3 - 2)
sage: A == B
False
sage: hash(A) == hash(B)
True
```

Probably, one should implement a method `__hash__` for the printer as well...

What's exactly the purpose and the requirements on the hash?
Do we need to ensure that `A == B` implies `hash(A) == hash(B)`? Or the other way around? Something else? Nothing?

The only requirement is that "A == B" implies "hash(A) == hash(B)".

One could even use the constant hash, that would be perfectly valid, but useless. So in general there is a balance or a choice : complex hash that tells many things apart, or simple hash that is not so good.

I think in sage, the hash for parents are not so important. They are required for python3 nevertheless.

A printer's `__eq__` is quite complex so I think that hashing the full dict is too much, i.e., it'll give different hashes to  printers that are considered equal. Strangely, the printer is not hashable (seems like a bug to me) so I'd not include it into the hash of the ring at all. If it were hashable, we should just include the printer's hash value.

So, I'd drop `hash_printer` and add a comment that printer's are strangely not hashable. Does that sound Ok to you?
