This hash is parallel to the behaviour of `__eq__` in the same class.

I think that it's not enough to compare the string representation of the printer.
For example:

```
sage: A.<pi> = Zp(2, print_mode='bars', print_sep='|').extension(x^3 - 2)
sage: B.<pi> = Zp(2, print_mode='bars', print_sep='#').extension(x^3 - 2)
sage: A == B
False
sage: hash(A) == hash(B)
True
```

Probably, one should implement a method `__hash__` for the printer as well...

What's exactly the purpose and the requirements on the hash?
Do we need to ensure that `A == B` implies `hash(A) == hash(B)`? Or the other way around? Something else? Nothing?

The only requirement is that "A == B" implies "hash(A) == hash(B)".

One could even use the constant hash, that would be perfectly valid, but useless. So in general there is a balance or a choice : complex hash that tells many things apart, or simple hash that is not so good.

I think in sage, the hash for parents are not so important. They are required for python3 nevertheless.
