I'm not sure what hashes are used for but I would say that the precision type should be included in the hash, shouldn't it?

This hash is parallel to the behaviour of `__eq__` in the same class.

I you want to change the equality, maybe do that in another ticket ?

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
I think that it's not enough to compare the string representation of the printer.
For example:

```
sage: A.<pi> = Zp(2, print_mode='bars', print_sep='|').extension(x^3 - 2)
sage: B.<pi> = Zp(2, print_mode='bars', print_sep='#').extension(x^3 - 2)
sage: A == B
False
sage: hash(A) == hash(B)
True
```

Probably, one should implement a method `__hash__` for the printer as well...

The hash is not necessarily taking all parameters into account. One could very well just forget about the printing mode.

Nevertheless, here is another proposal.

What's exactly the purpose and the requirements on the hash?
Do we need to ensure that `A == B` implies `hash(A) == hash(B)`? Or the other way around? Something else? Nothing?

The only requirement is that "A == B" implies "hash(A) == hash(B)".

One could even use the constant hash, that would be perfectly valid, but useless. So in general there is a balance or a choice : complex hash that tells many things apart, or simple hash that is not so good.

I think in sage, the hash for parents are not so important. They are required for python3 nevertheless.
