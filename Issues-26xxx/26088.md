This hash is parallel to the behaviour of `__eq__` in the same class.

I think that it's not enough to compare the string representation of the printer.
For example:

```
sage: A.<pi> = Zp(2, print_mode='bars', print_sep='|').extension(x^3 - 2)
sage: B.<pi> = Zp(2, print_mode='bars', print_sep='#').extension(x^3 - 2)
sage: A == B
False
sage: hash(A) == hash(B)
True
```

Probably, one should implement a method `__hash__` for the printer as well...

The hash is not necessarily taking all parameters into account. One could very well just forget about the printing mode.

Nevertheless, here is another proposal.

What's exactly the purpose and the requirements on the hash?
Do we need to ensure that `A == B` implies `hash(A) == hash(B)`? Or the other way around? Something else? Nothing?
