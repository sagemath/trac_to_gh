Given a quadratic number field, conversion to MPFR floating point is terribly slow compared to the more complicated MPFI interval floating point conversion

```
sage: %timeit RR(a)
1000 loops, best of 3: 224 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit RIF(a)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 919 ns per loop
```

- same purpose ticket for Python floating point #26927
