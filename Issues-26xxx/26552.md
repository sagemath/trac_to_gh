As a follow-up of #26361 this ticket adds an interface to glucose-syrup (the parallel version of glucose):

Example:

```
sage: solver = SAT('glucose-syrup')
sage: solver.add_clause( (1,2,-3) )
sage: solver()
(None, True, False, False)
```

Keywords: thursdaysbdx

All my code is online now either here or on #26361. I also want a global interface to exist. This is why I added the possibility to `SAT('glucose')` in #26361 (if you agree, and if this does not interfere with your global plan). Also, this is why I am adding the possibility to `SAT('glucose-syrup')` here in this ticket.

Is the commit `45645d1` a problem for the goal your are aiming?
