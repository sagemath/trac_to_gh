As a follow-up of #26361 this ticket adds an interface to glucose-syrup (the parallel version of glucose):

Example:

```
sage: solver = SAT('glucose-syrup')
sage: solver.add_clause( (1,2,-3) )
sage: solver()
(None, True, False, False)
```

Honestly, i wanted to touch the rest of the code minimally (of course the existing interface has to be fixed), because i first want to write a better interface, so that we can call tons of solvers without having to write a dedicated class for each (i would like to have a kind of database of available solvers in a json file, and you can solve the same problem with various solvers without having to rewrite the clauses as it is the case currently, i mean the problem will be defined independently of the solver when possible). In particular, i did not add a class for glucose-syrup to avoid useless back-work.

By the way, note that your code will not work for problems with lots of variables, since in such cases glucose-syrup will split the solution into many lines, hence the glucose parser has to be adapted. If you really want that feature for the short term, i can add my parser for it (it is written already, so there is no work on my side).

Please tell me what are your global plans about so that we can synchronize our whishes (for example, i plan to add an `__iter__` method to loop over every solutions, etc).

All my code is online now either here or on #26361. I also want a global interface to exist. This is why I added the possibility to `SAT('glucose')` in #26361 (if you agree, and if this does not interfere with your global plan).

Is the commit `45645d1` a problem for the goal your are aiming?
