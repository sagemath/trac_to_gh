There seems to be a race when copying files as cp is not atomic. I'm not sure if the copying holds a lock. Either the copying or the `*.pyc` file generation by the Python interpreter in another process conflicted here:

Actually I'm not sure this is #26018, but it still looks like a fluke.  How could you get:

```
Error copying files for future-0.17.1.
```

*after*

```
Successfully installed future-0.17.1

unless somehow the same package was being installed twice simultaneously?

The `Error copying files for future-0.17.1.` is just the error branch in `build/bin/sage-spkg`

The success message is written to stdout, and the error message to stderr. Both are independently buffered streams, it is to be expected that they are out of order.

I understand that, but the error case is:


```
 903     $SAGE_SUDO cp -Rp "$PREFIX/." "$SAGE_LOCAL"
 904     if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
 905         error_msg "Error copying files for $PKG_NAME."
 906         exit 1
 907     fi
```

i.e. it should have exited the script before the success message was ever echoed at all.

I'm also not convinced that its the right fix, imho we just shoudn't copy over pyc files for installation (they contain hardcoded absolute paths). Nothing good can come out of this.
