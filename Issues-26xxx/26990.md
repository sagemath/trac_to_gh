There seems to be a race when copying files as cp is not atomic. I'm not sure if the copying holds a lock. Either the copying or the `*.pyc` file generation by the Python interpreter in another process conflicted here:

The `Error copying files for future-0.17.1.` is just the error branch in `build/bin/sage-spkg`

The success message is written to stdout, and the error message to stderr. Both are independently buffered streams, it is to be expected that they are out of order.

 905         error_msg "Error copying files for $PKG_NAME."

i.e. it should have exited the script before the success message was ever echoed at all.

#26018 seems to have stalled

I'm also not convinced that its the right fix, imho we just shoudn't copy over pyc files for installation (they contain hardcoded absolute paths). Nothing good can come out of this.

That's a good point about the filename pyc files, but I'm not sure that's really the issue here.  Besides, I believe there are ways (e.g., maybe with the [compileall](https://docs.python.org/3/library/compileall.html#module-compileall) module) to deal with that, though I haven't tried.

#26018 doesn't appear to be stalled for any good reason.  I set it to needs_review 7 months, no one did anything, and now it needs to be rebased again.

Perhaps all that DESTDIR business should only apply to non-Python modules
if we arrange for all Python modules to be installed via `pip`.

They are already installed with pip, and regardless I don't think that would particularly help.  I think it would be annoying to have some SPKGs that use a different installation method.

When I last proposed it, #26018 solved the problem for me.
