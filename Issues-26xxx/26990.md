Actually I'm not sure this is #26018, but it still looks like a fluke.  How could you get:

```
Error copying files for future-0.17.1.
```

*after*

```
Successfully installed future-0.17.1
```

unless somehow the same package was being installed twice simultaneously?

The `Error copying files for future-0.17.1.` is just the error branch in `build/bin/sage-spkg`

The success message is written to stdout, and the error message to stderr. Both are independently buffered streams, it is to be expected that they are out of order.

I understand that, but the error case is:


```
 903     $SAGE_SUDO cp -Rp "$PREFIX/." "$SAGE_LOCAL"
 904     if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
 905         error_msg "Error copying files for $PKG_NAME."
 906         exit 1
 907     fi
```

i.e. it should have exited the script before the success message was ever echoed at all.

They are already installed with pip, and regardless I don't think that would particularly help.  I think it would be annoying to have some SPKGs that use a different installation method.

When I last proposed it, #26018 solved the problem for me.
