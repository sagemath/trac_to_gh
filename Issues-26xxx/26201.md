<a id='comment:2'></a>The line:

`It can be replaced by choosing an appropriate weight_function::` 

in the examples of `shortest_path_all_pairs()` no longer makes much sense. I suggest just removing that example altogether.

One "while you're at it" change: the documentation of `weight_function` has a grammar mistake; I recommend changing each occurrence of

`a function that inputs an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight.`

to

`a function that takes as input an edge ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight.`
