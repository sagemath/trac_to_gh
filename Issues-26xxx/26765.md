I think we should try to fix the root problem. Which seems to come from `class Function_log2` from file `sage.functions.log`. 
Note that there is other doctests falling because of this bug :

```
sage -t --long src/sage/functions/log.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/functions/log.py", line 404, in sage.functions.log.log
Failed example:
    log(int(8),2)
Expected:
    3
Got:
    1
...

Ok, but what should we do for the other cases then? (If we don't wait for pynac next release).
For `File "src/sage/functions/log.py", line 404` case for example i see 3 possibilities :
- Removing the doctest
- Tag the doctest with # py2
- Modify `log` function and convert the faulting parameter if we are in `PY3` and if it's an `int`. If we do it this way it will also solve the error fixed by this ticket.

I agree that we need to fix the problem in general.

But could we please still validate the branch here ? This would finish the "coding" module.

I want to wait for Ralph Stephan answer about pynac release. At least today.
I think it would be better to avoid to convert into a Sage integer to get around the `log` bug if possible. 
If we validate the branch right now and if #26770 is accepted or if a new pynac version is released in the next few days that means we should revert `+ return int(ZZ(codesize_upper_bound(n, d, q, algorithm=algorithm)).log(q))` to avoid unnecessary convertion.
