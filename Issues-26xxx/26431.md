By flagging the tests `# random`, aren't we taking the risk of missing errors induced by other changes ? I agree that these tests are very sensitive.

I agree that for this test we know exactly the type of the vertices, but isn't it better to do:

```diff
-            sage: sorted(D.keys()) == sorted(g)
+            sage: set(D.keys()) == set(g)
```
I don't know what is best, just asking.

I see no really better option.. One could maybe check that the result is a dictionary, with keys in G and values that are pairs of numbers ?

In this precise case, we can sort the vertices, so no need to worry about python3.

We could may be have one such test just in case. I don't have better proposals.
