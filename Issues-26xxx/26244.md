If you would like to take a stab at it.  Otherwise I'll fix it.  It's just a question of slightly rearranging this code in `sage.doctest.forker`:

```
 702                     else:
 703                         # Special case: On Python 3 these exceptions are all
 704                         # just aliases for OSError
 705                         for alias in _OSError_ALIASES:
 706                             if example.exc_msg.startswith(alias + ':'):
 707                                 exc_msg = exc_msg.replace('OSError', alias, 1)
 708                                 break
 709                         else:
 710                             for subcls in _OSError_SUBCLASSES:
 711                                 if exc_msg.startswith(subcls + ':'):
 712                                     exc_msg = exc_msg.replace(subcls, 'OSError',
 713
 714                                                               1)
