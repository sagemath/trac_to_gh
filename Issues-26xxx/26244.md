The doctest framework has some built-in mappings of built-in exception classes from their Python 2 spellings to their Python 3, so that doctests that expect those exceptions can be raised can be written for Python 2 but still work on Python 3: #25676

There is at least one case where the current implementation of this fails.  See: [#26213 comment:22](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/26213#comment:22)

If you would like to take a stab at it.  Otherwise I'll fix it.  It's just a question of slightly rearranging this code in `sage.doctest.forker`:

 705                         for alias in _OSError_ALIASES:
 706                             if example.exc_msg.startswith(alias + ':'):
 707                                 exc_msg = exc_msg.replace('OSError', alias, 1)
 708                                 break
 709                         else:
