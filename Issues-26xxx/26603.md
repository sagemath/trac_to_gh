Creating a Weyl group with the option `implementation="permutation"` is much faster, but unfortunately the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials are not computed correctly. Debugging this led to the discovery that the side of a descent is implemented inconsistently in the `bruhat_lower_covers` Element method of Coxeter groups. 

```
sage: W = WeylGroup("A3",prefix="s",implementation="permutation")
sage: [s1,s2,s3]=W.simple_reflections()
sage: (s1*s2*s3*s1).bruhat_lower_covers()
[s2*s1*s3, s1*s2*s3]
```

This is wrong since it omits ``s1*s2*s1``.

The culprit is the `has_descent` method that has different default sides for the two implementations.

```
sage: W = WeylGroup("A2",prefix="s")
sage: [s1,s2]=W.simple_reflections()
sage: (s1*s2).has_descent(1)
False
sage: 
sage: W = WeylGroup("A2",prefix="s",implementation="permutation")
sage: [s1,s2]=W.simple_reflections()
sage: (s1*s2).has_descent(1)
True
```

The patch fixes Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials by mandating `side="right"` where needed but doesn't address the underlying inconsistency.
