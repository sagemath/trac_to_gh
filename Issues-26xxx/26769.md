`git grep 'isinstance(.*, *(list, *tuple))'` reveals a widespread use of this type check in the Sage library.

Through the transition to Python 3, many standard functions such as `range` no longer construct lists but return special objects that support the sequence protocol.


This ticket adds an `issequence()` function that can work as a more generic replacement for `isinstance(x, (list, tuple))` but will also work with a broader range of similar types (e.g. `xrange`, Sage vectors, Numpy arrays, etc).  Note `issequence(x)` is also True for `str` and `bytes`.  So when using this to replace `(list, tuple)` care should be taken to make sure other sequence-like types are handled first, in cases where they require separate handling in the first place.

For the very common case of `(list, tuple)` this is faster than `isinstance`, but also has the benefit of being more generic, while not *quite* as generic as the much slower `isinstance(x, Sequence)`.

#24804 demonstrates an example usage which allows the constructor in question to also accept a Python 3 `range` object (an example which appears in the doctests that did not otherwise work).  This will likely be useful elsewhere but we can find those examples as we come to them.

These are technically completely different things.  The C-API level "sequence protocol" is defined by implementing some or all of the [PySequenceMethods](https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PySequenceMethods) (the way `PySequence_Check` is implemented all it cares about is that `sq_item` by implemented at a minimum).

This is different from the Python level `collections.abc` "Sequence" ABC which requires that both `__getitem__` and `__len__` are implemented.

This inconsistent overloading of terms is irritating and confusing, but it is what it is.  So this interface defines my own sort of middle-ground which is closer to the ABC in that it requires both the C-level sequence interface (which Python classes that implement `__getitem__` have), but also that `PySequence_Length` works and returns a non-negative integer.  There is an assumption then that `obj[n]` will work for `[0:len(obj)]`.  Unfortunately, for types defined at the Python level there is no obvious way to explicitly distinguish between a "sequence" and a "mapping".

A class that implements a custom `__getitem__` may work as one or the other, or both, so the best we can do is check for `__getitem__` and `__len__` and hope it works "like a list", which is how I'm defining "sequence" in this case.

We special case tuple and list here since they are going to be quite common and are known to be the two most fundamental sequence types built into Python (as opposed to dict, which is not considered a sequence).

> 2. There is no point in adding an empty `.pyx` file (unless I'm missing something)

If you don't have the .pyx file Cython won't actually generate a Python module that can be used by Python.  You can still `cimport` cpdef functions defined in a .pxd file from other Cython code, but you can't use it in Python :/

Now that I've had lunch, let me give a slightly clearer answer to this: This is effectively the same as `isinstance(x, Sequence)`, but it is much faster, both in the positive and negative cases, in that it bypasses all of the slow `isinstance` machinery entirely and does not result in calls to `Sequence.__subclasshook__` for types that do not obviously already implement the Sequence protocol.

The only case where it can be a slightly slow is for the cases where it has to call `PySequence_Length`, but that itself is only slow on classes that already implement `__getitem__` and `__len__`.

> Adds an `issequence()` function that can work as a more generic replacement for `isinstance(x, (list, tuple))`

I'm not really convinced that this `issequence(x)` is the correct replacement for `isinstance(x, (list, tuple))`. In the majority of cases, you probably want to be more general and accept any iterable. In the example #24804 that you refer to, you only iterate over the object so why restrict to sequences?

And the way: I also agree that the mapping vs sequence thing is annoying.

In the majority of cases, you probably want to be more general and accept any iterable. In the example #24804 that you refer to, you only iterate over the object so why restrict to sequences?

In many cases you *don't* just want an arbitrary iterable and that's what this is for.

Anything more general and you wind up back mired in the performance problems of using `isinstance` and ABCs.

If there's one tweak to this I would make it would be to explicitly exclude `str` and `bytes`, since although they are technically sequences under this definition, most of the time we want to treat them separately.

I think this problem *badly* needs a solution so I'd be happy to consider an alternative, but I think this is pretty useful in the vast majority of cases where it's needed.

Many interfaces could and should support iterators too, but that needs to be handled separately since iterators do not necessarily have a length.  The focus here on sequences is that they do have a fixed length and so certain guarantees and optimizations can be made about them that can't be made with arbitrary iterators.",

An iterator is *not* a sequence.  Many interfaces could and should support iterators too, but that needs to be handled separately since iterators do not necessarily have a length.  The focus here on sequences is that they do have a fixed length and so certain guarantees and optimizations can be made about them that can't be made with arbitrary iterators.

As an aside, I just noticed a small bug in my code:

```
+    PyErr_Clear()
```

As I recently learned from the review of a PR I made to Python, a bare `PyErr_Clear()` is slightly dangerous, because it can also clear exceptions from external events like `MemoryError` and `KeyboardInterrupt`.  I should use `PyErr_ExceptionMatches` here.
