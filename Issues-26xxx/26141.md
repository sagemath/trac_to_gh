In #24837 the method `repr_pretty_Hrepresentation` was changed to `Hrepresentation_str` but unfortunately the quality of the code does not meet Python's and SageMath's standards. The issues (relating to #24837, https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=c868d2c4a4e8b78a8221291741e878d468ddf367):
1. There is no parameter setting which gives back the old default behavior, which is inequalities separated by commas. Using the separator, one only gets strings containing a lot of blanks, which simple cannot be read properly.
2. The default values changed without a deprecation. The deprecation just aliases the old and new methods, but does not take care of the parameter setting. (I understand that some believe that this is a minor issue as the output is "only" a string represented to the user and not an (intermediate) result of a computation. However, one could have done this more smoothly)
3. PEP8 is not satisfied, in particular some too long lines and a lot of missing blanks after commas.
4. The code in some lines/blocks is considered bad in a Pythonic sense:
    {{{
    shift = any([pretty_hs[index][2][0] == '-' for index in range(len(pretty_hs))])
    }}}
   should be something like
    {{{
    shift = any(pretty_h[2][0] == '-' for pretty_h in pretty_hs)
    }}}
   or even better
    {{{
    shift = any(pretty_h[2].startswith('-') for pretty_h in pretty_hs)
    }}}
   Also get rid of the second `for index in range(len(...))`
5. The line
    {{{
    pretty_print = pretty_print[:-1] # Removing the last return
    }}}
   only works if the separator has length 1. Hint: The Pythonic way to do this kind of concatentation is to use `separator.join(...)`.
6. I cannot think of any reason, why the output has an additional blank at each end of line. Please remove this. (I personally would also get rid of all the blanks at the end of the line, i.e. the padding on the right. This maybe is a matter of taste, so should not bother us too much and probably people will find a lot of arguments why this is something wanted, so I just comment this here. ;) )
7. Why
    {{{
    product = -1*(coeffs[1:]*vars[1:])
    }}}
   and not simply
    {{{
    product = -(...)
    }}}
   or even
    {{{
    product = -...
    }}}
    ?
8. There is quite a lot of code doubling at the end of the patch of #24837:
     {{{
     if not split:
         some code
     else:
         almost identical code with very few exceptions
     }}}
   This is very hard too read as one has to compare both almost identical blocks to find the differences. I am certain that a better solution can be found for this.
9. Docstring of `style`-parameter: Shouldn't the commas be set differently: `either ..., or ... or ...` because the latter two should be grouped and not the former two?
10. Docstring
     {{{
     ``latex`` -- a boolean. Default is ``None``
     }}}
   So what does `None` mean here? Is it set automatically according to the input? If static, probably its `False` but who knows. Why using `None` at all and not `False` as the default then?
21. The default of the `style`-parameter is `'>='` in base.py and `'positive'` in representation.py. Having different default values within the same module for methods doing "the same" is usually not a good idea.
32. The variable `split` needs a docstring explaining what it does as this is not obvious. (And, from a technical point of view, one could consider using its inverse `join`, as it is more a `' '.join(...)` than a `....split(' ')`, but this is highly debatable.)

I won't comment on this specific case, but you could also consider reverting #24837 and then fixing these issues. In any case, it would be good to have one of these 3 things **soon**:

1. Agreement that the code is not so bad after all.

2. A fix for the code.

3. A revert of the code.

It is true that each of the issues above is not a blocker, but by finding that many issues in one simple patch one gets the impression that the code was written sloppy and that the review was done sloppy. And this is something we do not want (as [SageMath](SageMath) is sometimes advertised with high coding standards and a peer-reviewing process); this is the actual issue here.

> Some technical notes. PEP8 are guidelines, good ones that should be followed as much as possible, but guidelines all the same.


I wouldn't have brought PEP8 up alone (and I do not mind if there is a too long line from time to time), but the code itself is very inconsistently written, so this is way it came up.

> Same for "Pythonic" code (also you can get a speed bonus for doing these things, not that it is particularly useful here).


I do not insist on this either, but as I have re-reviewed the ticket, I brought it up.

> Sometimes you have to duplicate code or you have to make things somewhat convoluted to not do the duplication. Minor differences are differences.


In this particular case it is very easy to avoid the doubling: Use the complete code from the else-block but instead of return save the content in a variable. Then

```
if not split:
    return ' '.join(variable)
else:
    return variable
```

> It is also *really* annoying to deprecate default value changes.


Yes, but the major issue here is that the original behavior is simply not possible anymore; this is annoying.

(I understand that some believe that this is a minor issue as the output is \"only\" a string represented to the user and not an (intermediate) result of a computation. However, one could have done this more smoothly)\n\n\nI agree that changing the default behavior is a sensible issue, and that the transition could have been more smooth, see https://xkcd.com/1172 . The code now gives:\n\n```\nsage: c = polytopes.cube()\nsage: c.repr_pretty_Hrepresentation(separator=', ',style='positive')\n/home/jplabbe/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: repr_pretty_Hrepresentation is deprecated.

PEP8 is not satisfied, in particular some too long lines and a lot of missing blanks after commas.\n\n\nThe ticket #24837 introduced 10 too long lines and 12 missing spaces after commas. I added the necessary spaces after the commas in all the file and I left the other four hundred fifty E501s alone.\n\n> 4. The code in some lines/blocks is considered bad in a Pythonic sense:\n>     {{{\n>     shift = any([pretty_hs[index][2][0] == '-' for index in range(len(pretty_hs))])\n>     }}}\n>    should be something like\n>     {{{\n>     shift = any(pretty_h[2][0] == '-' for pretty_h in pretty_hs)\n>     }}}\n>    or even better\n>     {{{\n>     shift = any(pretty_h[2].startswith('-') for pretty_h in pretty_hs)\n>     }}}\n>    Also get rid of the second `for index in range(len(...))`\n\n\nThanks for mentioning, forgot to look over that.\n\n> 5. The line\n>     {{{\n>     pretty_print = pretty_print[:-1] # Removing the last return\n>     }}}\n>    only works if the separator has length 1. Hint: The Pythonic way to do this kind of concatentation is to use `separator.join(...)`.\n\n\nDone.\n\n> 6. I cannot think of any reason, why the output has an additional blank at each end of line. Please remove this. (I personally would also get rid of all the blanks at the end of the line, i.e. the padding on the right. This maybe is a matter of taste, so should not bother us too much and probably people will find a lot of arguments why this is something wanted, so I just comment this here. ;) )\n\n\nThe reason was the shifting of coefficients appearing on the right column. This column appearing on the right of the inequality sign is left justified. When a minus sign appears the coefficient start 1 character more to the left. When there is no minus sign before the coefficient, it therefore appears shifted towards the left. In other to deal with this alignment issue, we insert one character more to the right column to place the \"-\".

> 1. There is no parameter setting which gives back the old default behavior, which is inequalities separated by commas. Using the separator, one only gets strings containing a lot of blanks, which simple cannot be read properly.
> 2. The default values changed without a deprecation. The deprecation just aliases the old and new methods, but does not take care of the parameter setting. (I understand that some believe that this is a minor issue as the output is "only" a string represented to the user and not an (intermediate) result of a computation. However, one could have done this more smoothly)


I agree that changing the default behavior is a sensible issue, and that the transition could have been more smooth, see https://xkcd.com/1172 . The code now gives:

```
sage: c = polytopes.cube()
sage: c.repr_pretty_Hrepresentation(separator=', ',style='positive')
/home/jplabbe/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: repr_pretty_Hrepresentation is deprecated. Please use Hrepresentation_str instead.
See https://trac.sagemath.org/24837 for details.
  #!/usr/bin/env sage-python23
'1 >= x2, 1 >= x1, 1 >= x0, x0 + 1 >= 0, x2 + 1 >= 0, x1 + 1 >= 0'
```

so it is possible to get back the previous behavior.

> 3. PEP8 is not satisfied, in particular some too long lines and a lot of missing blanks after commas.


The ticket #24837 introduced 10 too long lines and 12 missing spaces after commas. I added the necessary spaces after the commas in all the file and I left the other four hundred fifty E501s alone.

> 4. The code in some lines/blocks is considered bad in a Pythonic sense:

>     shift = any(pretty_h[2].startswith('-') for pretty_h in pretty_hs)
>     }}}
>    Also get rid of the second `for index in range(len(...))`


Thanks for mentioning, forgot to look over that.

Done.

> 6. I cannot think of any reason, why the output has an additional blank at each end of line. Please remove this. (I personally would also get rid of all the blanks at the end of the line, i.e. the padding on the right. This maybe is a matter of taste, so should not bother us too much and probably people will find a lot of arguments why this is something wanted, so I just comment this here. ;) )


The reason was the shifting of coefficients appearing on the right column. This column appearing on the right of the inequality sign is left justified. When a minus sign appears the coefficient start 1 character more to the left. When there is no minus sign before the coefficient, it therefore appears shifted towards the left. In other to deal with this alignment issue, we insert one character more to the right column to place the "-". This had the side effect that when no minus sign appears (which is the case when "style=positive") then, there is a space left at the end of an equation.

This is now taken care of.

No opinion here.

Ok. (FWIW, I would be happy with any of the two being the default.)

I've shortend the OUTPUT-block to avoid the double-description of the style-parameter.

I've introduced a new parameter to set alignment. (I hereby think of other separators than newline.)

I've factored out the padding in a separate function to obtain easier code-reading, I hope.
