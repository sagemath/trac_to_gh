<a id='comment:6'></a>With python3, i get :

```
sage -t src/sage/finance/stock.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/finance/stock.py", line 573, in sage.finance.stock.Stock.load_from_file
Failed example:

Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'I am not a file'
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/vklein/odk/sage/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 650, in _run

      File "<doctest sage.finance.stock.Stock.load_from_file[4]>", line 1, in <module>

        file_obj = open(file, 'r')
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'I am not a file'

```

And if i add a `<BLANKLINE>` in the doctest expected result :


```
sage -t src/sage/finance/stock.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/finance/stock.py", line 573, in sage.finance.stock.Stock.load_from_file
Failed example:

Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

      File "/home/vklein/odk/sage/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/finance/stock.py", line 579, in load_from_file
        file_obj = open(file, 'r')
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'I am not a file'

```

It behave as if the Error is not catched by the doctest framework.
