With python3, i get :

```
sage -t src/sage/finance/stock.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/finance/stock.py", line 573, in sage.finance.stock.Stock.load_from_file
Failed example:
    finance.Stock("AAPL").load_from_file("I am not a file") # py3
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'I am not a file'
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/vklein/odk/sage/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 650, in _run

      File "/home/vklein/odk/sage/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 1061, in compile_and_execute
        exec(compiled, globs)
      File "<doctest sage.finance.stock.Stock.load_from_file[4]>", line 1, in <module>
        finance.Stock("AAPL").load_from_file("I am not a file") # py3
      File "/home/vklein/odk/sage/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/finance/stock.py", line 578, in load_from_file
        file_obj = open(file, 'r')
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'I am not a file'

```

And if i add a `<BLANKLINE>` in the doctest expected result :


```
sage -t src/sage/finance/stock.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/finance/stock.py", line 573, in sage.finance.stock.Stock.load_from_file
Failed example:

Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/vklein/odk/sage/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 650, in _run

      File "/home/vklein/odk/sage/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 1061, in compile_and_execute

        finance.Stock("AAPL").load_from_file("I am not a file") # py3
      File "/home/vklein/odk/sage/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/finance/stock.py", line 579, in load_from_file
        file_obj = open(file, 'r')
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'I am not a file'

```

It behave as if the Error is not catched by the doctest framework.

To simplify i have tested the following doctest :

```
sage: raise NameError("test")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: test
sage: raise FileNotFoundError("test")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
FileNotFoundError: test
```

The first test pass and the second fails.

ok. So the reason is that there is in sage doctesting framework a mechanism that modifies some subexceptions of OSError in python3, and replace them with OSError.

Should be good to go now. Unless Erik (`@`embray) has a better idea ?
