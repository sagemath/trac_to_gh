<a id='comment:6'></a>With python3, i get :

```

        file_obj = open(file, 'r')
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'I am not a file'

```

And if i add a `<BLANKLINE>` in the doctest expected result :


```

        file_obj = open(file, 'r')
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'I am not a file'

```

It behave as if the Error is not catched by the doctest framework.
