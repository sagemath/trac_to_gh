This ticket is to upgrade to Giac 1.5.

A preliminary version "1.5.0 unstable" is available for testing:

- [announcement on Giac / Xcas forum](https://xcas.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=2134)
- [source tarball for giac-1.5](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/debian/dists/stable/main/source/) (take latest giac-1.5.x-y).
- [README about source tarballs for Giac and their version numbering](http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/debian/dists/stable/main/source/README)

This upgrade should solve #25822 and #25324 since the issues reported there are fixed upstream.

All that will be left to do in those tickets is add doctests.

I suppose we finally have stable 1.5.0, here
 (repacked):

NB: I have  reported in giac's forum that without glpk the built of:

http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/debian/dists/stable/main/source/giac_1.5.0-1.tar.gz

is broken.
This is a minor change in src/graphe.cc, but may be we could wait 1.5.0-2?

Whatever, we never use the "unstable" file https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac/giac-1.5.0.tar.gz for packaging because it changes often.

Thanks frederichan for your comments and the link to the readme.

Of course it does not seem reasonable to upgrade to giac-1.5.0-1.

But I thought I'd at least open the ticket if only to point out that
upgrading to giac 1.5 should fix two other tickets.

Hi Francois, 
I didn't knew about this one. Should I report something? (if yes what?)

But I  know that glpk and nauty are new possible dependencies. As they standard sage packages, may be we should add them to giac's deps in sage?

Possibly. It may be also be because gcc-8 is more strict about some stuff. 

```
libtool: compile:  x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -DIN_GIAC -I. -I.. -I. -I.. -g -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -DGIAC_GENERIC_CONSTANTS -c signalprocessing.cc  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/signalprocessing.o

glpk has been a dependency in the 1.4 series too. I hadn't noticed, seems to build fine with or without but it means sage installations of giac may be inconsistent which each others so I am in favor to just add it - regardless of this ticket.

The nauty dependency is new to me. Looking at `configure.in` I can see

```
AC_CHECK_LIB(nauty,main)
AC_CHECK_HEADERS(nauty/naututil.h)
```

so it is not fatal if it is not there. Which is just as well because that stuff looks for a library and as far as I know the nauty we have only install a bunch of executables, no libraries or headers.

So at this stage do not add nauty - may be we are thinking of the wrong package.

So since curl version 7.55 or so one needs to use `curl/system.h` instead.

2. I'm not convinced that we can remove `alloca.patch`. It doesn't seem like upstream has applied that.

It's definitely getting up there.  I'll be annoyed if I have to distupgrade this machine, but at the same time it may be inevitable quite soon anyways.  Regardless, I've made it this far, and if a simple `::isnan` is enough to fix it...

Interestingly, the code where this is coming up is already in a `my_isnan` function defined in `src/global.cc` like:

```
#if defined(FIR_LINUX) || defined(FIR_ANDROID)
    return std::isnan(d);
#else
    return isnan(d);
#endif
```

where if `FIR_LINUX` is defined it will do the right thing I think.  But I have no idea what this macro `FIR_LINUX` means, or what `FIR` means, nor is it at all clear how it gets set.

IMO we should never "upgrade" packages that don't even have publicly accessible source code repositories.  It makes it impossible to debug what changed between versions if something goes wrong.  Incredible.

For some reason I thought they were just vendoring giac on a version-by-version basis, but it turns out I'm wrong.  ~~This seems to actually *be* the repository for giac.  Nice find!!~~

Upon closer inspection no, it can't be.  It seems like somehow bits of giac are being synced into this repository, but it's not the full source code for giac.  So I'm really confused.
