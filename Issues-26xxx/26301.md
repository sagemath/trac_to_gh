There's a doctest that invokes this bug in Python 3.6's `zipfile` module:

```
sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.shapes import Cylinder
sage: C = Cylinder(3, 1, closed=False)
sage: C.jmol_repr(C.testing_render_params())
Exception ignored in: <bound method ZipFile.__del__ of <zipfile.ZipFile [closed]>>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-python3/local/lib/python3.6/zipfile.py", line 1663, in __del__
    self.close()
  File "/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-python3/local/lib/python3.6/zipfile.py", line 1681, in close
    self._write_end_record()
  File "/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-python3/local/lib/python3.6/zipfile.py", line 1783, in _write_end_record
    centDirSize, centDirOffset, len(self._comment))
struct.error: argument out of range
['pmesh obj_1 "obj_1.pmesh"\ncolor pmesh  [102,102,255]']
```

The `Graphics3d.testing_render_params()` opens a `ZipFile` in write mode to `/dev/null`, so the bug seems to have to do with writing a zipfile to `/dev/null` (probably to do with a `tell()` call somewhere).

For the purposes of testing there's no reason this needs to go to `'/dev/null'`.  It can just as well use a temp file, so we can implement that workaround.  But we should also open an upstream bug report for the `zipfile` problem, if it hasn't already been reported.
