#25932 introduced code of the form

```
try:
    vertices = tuple(sorted(vertex_set))
except TypeError:
    vertices = tuple(sorted(vertex_set, key=str))
```
The problem here is that sorting is not predictable: adding a vertex or considering a face containing only sortable vertices could suddenly change the ordering.

Instead, the sorting key should be explicitly given and the same key should always be used for the same simplicial complex.

I think that the new doctest

```
+        The vertices can be sorted with a custom key::
+
+            sage: SimplicialComplex([10], sort_facets=str)
+            Simplicial complex with 11 vertices and facets {(0, 1, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)}
```
should be at the class level so it appears in the reference manual.

It's implicit in a lot of Cython code. But you're right that maybe no Python code in Sage uses it so far.

Even then, I still think that this ticket is an improvement. The changes to the code make sense, so it should just be a matter of specifying the appropriate sorting key.

Okay, what is the appropriate sorting key? For example, if you take the disjoint union of two simplicial complexes which use different sorting keys, how do you sort the result?

We can put bandaids on this for now, and on one hand, with a few changes, I can decrease the number of failures quite a bit, so that it fixes not just the problems caused by this ticket but (combined with your changes) fixes other problems, too. On the other hand, the whole thing looks very fragile: someone could very easily construct simplicial complexes which break sorting, and once the sorting is lost, homology calculations are unreliable.

So I am not convinced that this ticket as it stands is an improvement. 

One way to fix could be to create new classes for each construction, like `DisjointUnion`, which keeps track of the factors and sorts in each factor separately. I am very much tempted to roll back this ticket and leave it open as a future enhancement.

Here are some methods which need attention:
- product
- join
- disjoint_union
- wedge
- connected_sum
- link
- star
- generated_subcomplex
- alexander_dual
- stellar_subdivision
- n_skeleton
- connected_component
- fixed_complex
- intersection
- `_contractible_subcomplex`
- `_enlarge_subcomplex`
- `__copy__`

and there are probably others
