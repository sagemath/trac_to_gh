@sagetrac-tmonteil, could you please help me fix the 32 bits hash, by running the following doctest with this branch on your 32 bit machine and reporting the result ?

```
            sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(Zmod(10), 1)
            sage: hash(P([2, 5]))
            -479010389                     # 32-bit
