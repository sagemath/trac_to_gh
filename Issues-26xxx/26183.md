```
When a line of test input tagged with e.g. `# rel tol` throws a warning or error, the line numbers, version numbers, etc. in the tracebacks are tested, even if there are ellipses in the test output signaling that they should be ignored.

Here's a toy example:

```
def foo():
    """
    The following test fails. We should disallow this.

    TESTS::
        sage: foo() # rel tol 1e-1
        [0, ... 9]
    """
    print([j for j in range(10)])
```

We should throw an error if these are used in the same doctest, as this can lead to confusing output.

One partial workaround is to avoid using `#rel tol` in tests which throw errors and just use ellipses to simulate it.

I'm not sure I'd go that far.  There are perfectly valid cases one could think of where some long output contains floating point values on which you'd want to use `# tol`, but ignore other parts of the output.

It took me a moment to understand what the original problem was but I see now and think it's a valid bug in the test framework, albeit a small one that I'm not too worried about (if some code is crashing with an unexpected exception I don't really care if the result of the test is a little strange as long as it obviously fails...)

There may be valid use cases, but those don't seem important enough to add additional complications to the doctest framework to support combining `...` and `tol`.

It's complicated because `...` might hide numbers. Imagine

```
sage: list(range(5))  # abs tol 0.1
[..., 3.1, ...]
```
This needs to pass (with 3.1 replacing 3). However, to check that, you need to match 3.1 with every number in the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

And there is crazy stuff like

```
sage: pi.n()  # abs tol 0.002
3.13...
```
which should pass because the `3.13...` might be `3.1399` which is less than `0.002` from `pi.n()`.

Note that the case where `...` does not involve any numbers is already supported.
