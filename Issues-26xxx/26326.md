The problem is that `current_randstate().seed()` provides longs, and apparently networkx does not like it:

```
sage: graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(50,2)
ValueError: 337906337582125808005456054818180223663L cannot be used to generate a random.Random instance
```

However it likes instances of `random.Random` objects which are provided by `current_randstate().python_random()`.

Maybe should i use `current_randstate().c_random()` which is a 31bit-only integer, or `current_randstate().python_random() % sys.maxint`.

I guess that they do not support long because they are going to support Python 3 only.

Perhaps it's the same issue as I've noticed with networkx before, and even fixed some of it. Basically, they don't quite respect the Python's numerical tower, if it's extended, say by numpy, or Sage.
