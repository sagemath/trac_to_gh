The problem is that `current_randstate().seed()` provides longs, and apparently networkx does not like it:

sage: graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(50,2)
ValueError: 337906337582125808005456054818180223663L cannot be used to generate a random.Random instance
```

However it likes instances of `random.Random` objects which are provided by `current_randstate().python_random()`.

Maybe should i use `current_randstate().c_random()` which is a 31bit-only integer, or `current_randstate().python_random() % sys.maxint`.

I guess that they do not support long because they are going to support Python 3 only.

> I could offer a workaround, but first I want to make sure it's really necessary to make this change in Sage, because it doesn't seem like it should be necessary.  The release notes you linked to are unclear about what they thing the best practice should be.

With this patch I'm getting lots of test suite errors on Arch:

ValueError: <sage.cpython._py2_random.Random object at 0x561e012e8f50> cannot be used to generate a random.Random instance

Running the test code directly in Sage works fine. Using c_random() instead of python_random() makes the tests pass.

Actually no, there are still some (fewer) failures

That doesn't really make sense given that the Python 3 int type is the Python 2 long type.  Probably more likely it needs to be modulo `sys.max_size`.

Perhaps it's the same issue as I've noticed with networkx before, and even fixed some of it. Basically, they don't quite respect the Python's numerical tower, if it's extended, say by numpy, or Sage.
See https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/2799

Basically they did dispatch on types not quite right, e.g. `isinstance(foo,int)` instead of `isinstance(foo,numbers.Integral)`
