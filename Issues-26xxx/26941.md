We use method `is_directed_acyclic` to find cycles instead of computing shortest paths. This should have been done long ago as it's faster this way.

Before:

```
sage: D = digraphs.TransitiveTournament(10)
sage: D.add_edges((i+1, i) for i in range(9))
sage: flow = {e: 1 for e in D.edge_iterator(labels=0)}
sage: %time F = D._build_flow_graph(flow, False)
CPU times: user 1.45 ms, sys: 320 µs, total: 1.77 ms
Wall time: 1.55 ms
```

After:

```
sage: D = digraphs.TransitiveTournament(10)
sage: D.add_edges((i+1, i) for i in range(9))
sage: flow = {e: 1 for e in D.edge_iterator(labels=0)}
sage: %time F = D._build_flow_graph(flow, False)
CPU times: user 958 µs, sys: 244 µs, total: 1.2 ms
Wall time: 1.02 ms
```

This seems like a better approach (at least it makes the code more natural). So LGTM.
