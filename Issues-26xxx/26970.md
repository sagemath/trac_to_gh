This ticket is a follow up on #26929.  As pointed out there, conversions from univariate quotient rings to subrings of the base ring should be harmonized with those of multivariate quotient rings.

For example, we currently have the following:

```
sage:  R.<x,y> = QQ[]; S.<a,b> = R.quo(x^2 + y^2);
sage: ZZ.coerce_map_from(S) is None
True
sage: ZZ.convert_map_from(S)
Conversion via _integer_ method map:
  From: Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (x^2 + y^2)
  To:   Integer Ring
```
In the univariate case another map gets picked up; one that apparently always fails.

```
sage: R.<x>=QQ[]; S.<a>=R.quo(x^2+1)
sage: m=ZZ.convert_map_from(S); m
Conversion map:
  From: Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in a over Rational Field with modulus x^2 + 1
  To:   Integer Ring
```
This map simply ends up calling `ZZ._element_constructor_(<argument>)`, which fails.

So the difference seems to be whether an `_integer_` method is available on the elements.

(not sure whether this belongs to coercion or categories, or neither.)

Maybe the following is part of the problem:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ); S = R.quotient(x^2+y^2)
sage: R1.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ); S1 = R1.quotient(x^2+x)
sage: S1 in Algebras(QQ)
True
sage: S in Algebras(QQ)
False
```
I don't know yet how (and where) this should be fixed.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
