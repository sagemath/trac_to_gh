while working on #26856, we observed

```
File "src/sage/algebras/quantum_groups/quantum_group_gap.py", line 757, in sage.algebras.quantum_groups.quantum_group_gap.QuantumGroup.coproduct
Failed example:
    [Q.coproduct(f, 2) for f in Q.F_simple()]  # optional - gap_packages
Expected:
    [1*(1<x>1<x>F[a1]) + -q^2 + q^-2*(1<x>F[a1]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ])
      + 1*(1<x>F[a1]<x>K1) + q^4-2 + q^-4*(F[a1]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ])
      + -q^2 + q^-2*(F[a1]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]<x>K1) + -q^2
      + q^-2*(F[a1]<x>K1<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]) + 1*(F[a1]<x>K1<x>K1),
     1*(1<x>1<x>F[a2]) + -q + q^-1*(1<x>F[a2]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ])
      + 1*(1<x>F[a2]<x>K2) + q^2-2 + q^-2*(F[a2]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ])
      + -q + q^-1*(F[a2]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]<x>K2) + -q
      + q^-1*(F[a2]<x>K2<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]) + 1*(F[a2]<x>K2<x>K2)]
Got:
    [1*(1<x>1<x>F[a1]) + -q^2 + q^-2*(1<x>F[a1]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]) + 1*(1<x>F[a1]<x>K1) + q^4-2 + q^-4*(F
     1<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]) + -q^2 + q^-2*(F[a1]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]<x>K1) + -q^2 + q^-2*(F
     1<x>K1<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]) + 1*(F[a1]<x>K1<x>K1),
     1*(1<x>1<x>F[a2]) + -q + q^-1*(1<x>F[a2]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]) + 1*(1<x>F[a2]<x>K2) + q^2-2 + q^-2*(F
     4<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]) + -q + q^-1*(F[a2]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]<x>K2) + -q + q^-1*(F[a2]<x>K
     2<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]) + 1*(F[a2]<x>K2<x>K2)]
```
so some patters such as `F[a1]` get mangled.

See comment 40 on #26856 on how it looks if the output is LaTeXified, one sees `\n` getting in.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
This was fixed in #26856, specifically by [d0b769d6](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/d0b769d670045e8411069c75d80ad6c388944131).  The problem was not in the doctest framework per se, but rather with how print representations of GAP objects were being captured, with GAP's automatic line breaking in effect.

We haven't fixed the problem 100%, because GAP may still insert unwanted line breaks in extreme cases where a line of output is > 4096 bytes.  A better solution would be to have a flag (I think `--norepl` should do this) to disable GAP's automatic line breaking entirely.  But that's a fix needed upstream.
