while working on #26856, we observed

```
File "src/sage/algebras/quantum_groups/quantum_group_gap.py", line 757, in sage.algebras.quantum_groups.quantum_group_gap.QuantumGroup.coproduct
Failed example:
    [Q.coproduct(f, 2) for f in Q.F_simple()]  # optional - gap_packages
Expected:
    [1*(1<x>1<x>F[a1]) + -q^2 + q^-2*(1<x>F[a1]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ])
      + 1*(1<x>F[a1]<x>K1) + q^4-2 + q^-4*(F[a1]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ])
      + -q^2 + q^-2*(F[a1]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]<x>K1) + -q^2
      + q^-2*(F[a1]<x>K1<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]) + 1*(F[a1]<x>K1<x>K1),
     1*(1<x>1<x>F[a2]) + -q + q^-1*(1<x>F[a2]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ])
      + 1*(1<x>F[a2]<x>K2) + q^2-2 + q^-2*(F[a2]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ])
      + -q + q^-1*(F[a2]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]<x>K2) + -q
      + q^-1*(F[a2]<x>K2<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]) + 1*(F[a2]<x>K2<x>K2)]
Got:
    [1*(1<x>1<x>F[a1]) + -q^2 + q^-2*(1<x>F[a1]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]) + 1*(1<x>F[a1]<x>K1) + q^4-2 + q^-4*(F
     1<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]) + -q^2 + q^-2*(F[a1]<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]<x>K1) + -q^2 + q^-2*(F
     1<x>K1<x>[ K1 ; 1 ]) + 1*(F[a1]<x>K1<x>K1),
     1*(1<x>1<x>F[a2]) + -q + q^-1*(1<x>F[a2]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]) + 1*(1<x>F[a2]<x>K2) + q^2-2 + q^-2*(F
     4<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]) + -q + q^-1*(F[a2]<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]<x>K2) + -q + q^-1*(F[a2]<x>K
     2<x>[ K2 ; 1 ]) + 1*(F[a2]<x>K2<x>K2)]
```
so some patters such as `F[a1]` get mangled.

See comment 40 on #26856 on how it looks if the output is LaTeXified, one sees `\n` getting in.

I have my doubts about this, but it's not inconceivable.  Like you said, it's such a noisy line I wonder if there are some false positives, e.g. from some of the doctest fixups for Python 2/3 compatibility, or something along those lines.  I'll look into it.
