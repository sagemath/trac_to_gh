I did not notice that before packaging: the parallel version (which is the interesting one) uses a modified MIT license, and adds:

- *The parallel version of Glucose (all files modified since Glucose 3.0 releases, 2013) cannot be used in any competitive event (sat competitions/evaluations) without the express permission of the authors (Gilles Audemard / Laurent Simon). This is also the case for any competitive event using Glucose Parallel as an embedded SAT engine (single core or not).*

Shall we distribute that ? Shall we add a warning during the install procedure ?

Ok, I removed the `SAGE_LOCAL` check part from the `spkg-install`.

I keep the LFLAGS since the template makefile `glucose-syrup-4.1/mtl/template.mk` contains a line

```
LFLAGS    ?= -Wall -lpthread 
```

so I guess Thierry wrote that in the `spkg-install` for some good reason.

What should be the content of the `spkg-check` ? There does seem to be any `check` target in the makefile of glucose...

For now, the goal of this ticket is to make version 4.1 of glucose an optional package of sage. Later versions of glucose will be dealt in another ticket.

Many standard/optional packages do not provide self tests, and some self-tests of standard packages are broken in various officially supported platforms (starting with python which is never self-tested, see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#index-28). On Sage 8.4, only 82 over a total of 286 packages do have a `spkg-check` file.\n\nNote that, setting a package type to experimental implies that classical sage tests tagged with that package are not run with a usual `sage --test --all --long` command, the package must be explicitly added by hand (and then only the explicitly added packages will be tested).

Does are, imho, not good reasons.

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A33):
> The reasons are explained above
> - no tests provided

The existence of `spkg-check` is conditioned to the existence of self-tests, see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#self-tests. Many standard/optional packages do not provide self tests, and some self-tests of standard packages are broken in various officially supported platforms (starting with python which is never self-tested, see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#index-28). On Sage 8.4, only 82 over a total of 286 packages do have a `spkg-check` file.

Note that, setting a package type to experimental implies that classical sage tests tagged with that package are not run with a usual `sage --test --all --long` command, the package must be explicitly added by hand (and then only the explicitly added packages will be tested). This implies that actually, the package behaviour in sage will be even less tested than if it was optional.

> - tarball contains a lot of spurious files

This is an aesthetical judgment. They do not interfere with the compilation. Note that even with those files, the tarball size is pretty small.

If this was a real concern (it is not), the appropriate fix would have been to provide a `spkg-src` with something like:

```
find -name '._*' -exec rm {} \;
```

See https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#modified-tarballs note that i am not in favor of this option either as is breaks upstream integrity (everyone can check that the hashes correspond) for no real benefit.

Personally, I agree to set it to optional.

I just forced pushed the penultimate commit ​66d1983.

I added the name of Vincent in the reviewer field since he was involved in the review up to now and to avoid forgeting it a second time.

Needs review.
