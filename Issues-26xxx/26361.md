<a id='comment:18'></a>Ok, I removed the `SAGE_LOCAL` check part from the `spkg-install`.

I keep the LFLAGS since the template makefile `glucose-syrup-4.1/mtl/template.mk` contains a line

<a id='comment:32'></a>Sorry for not being active during the past month. I really do not understand why the package has to be experimental. Does someone have problem to compile it ? Does someone experience wrong results with it ? Note that having a package set to experimental makes it less tested (one have to manualy add it to the `--optional` test option).

The existence of `spkg-check` is conditioned to the existence of self-tests, see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#self-tests. Many standard/optional packages do not provide self tests, and some self-tests of standard packages are broken in various officially supported platforms (starting with python which is never self-tested, see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#index-28). On Sage 8.4, only 82 over a total of 286 packages do have a `spkg-check` file.

Note that, setting a package type to experimental implies that classical sage tests tagged with that package are not run with a usual `sage --test --all --long` command, the package must be explicitly added by hand (and then only the explicitly added packages will be tested). This implies that actually, the package behaviour in sage will be even less tested than if it was optional.

> - tarball contains a lot of spurious files


This is an aesthetical judgment. They do not interfere with the compilation. Note that even with those files, the tarball size is pretty small.

If this was a real concern (it is not), the appropriate fix would have been to provide a `spkg-src` with something like:

```
find -name '._*' -exec rm {} \;
```

See https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#modified-tarballs note that i am not in favor of this option either as is breaks upstream integrity (everyone can check that the hashes correspond) for no real benefit.

<a id='comment:36'></a>Personally, I agree to set it to optional.

I just forced pushed the penultimate commit ​66d1983.

I added the name of Vincent in the reviewer field since he was involved in the review up to now and to avoid forgeting it a second time.

Needs review.
