```
The `_element_constructor` machinery in `Parent` has support both for `P._element_constructor_` being a bound and an unbound method. However, after #26878, the only case that occurs is bound methods. So we deprecate support for unbound methods.

Practically speaking, this means deprecating `DefaultConvertMap` (only when used directly, not when subclassed) which is the class implementing conversion using an unbound `_element_constructor_` and deprecating the `_element_init_pass_parent=True` case in `IdentityMorphism`.
