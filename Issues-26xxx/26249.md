In FreeBSD 12 the long-standing incompleteness of its libm has been helped. This simplifies a lot, compared to #22679.

We will not try to work around the toolchain [problem related to gfortran/libgcc_s](https://wiki.freebsd.org/libgcc%20problem). Instead, we just [add a line](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=208120#c14) at the end of `/etc/libmap.conf` as
follows:

```
libgcc_s.so.1 /usr/local/lib/gcc7/libgcc_s.so.1
```
Also, we create the following symbolic links:

```
$ ls -l ~/bin
total 0
lrwxr-xr-x  1 dima  dima  20 Apr 27 12:49 make -> /usr/local/bin/gmake
lrwxr-xr-x  1 dima  dima  21 Apr 27 13:46 patch -> /usr/local/bin/gpatch
```
and use the standard shell, `/bin/sh`. In `~/.profile` we put

```
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
export CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"
export CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGS
export CPPFLAGS=$CFLAGS
export FCFLAGS=$CFLAGS
export FFLAGS=$CFLAGS
```
to account for clang not looking into `/usr/local` by default.


Things to fix:

* #26250 (fixes to rubiks)
* #27764 (a fix to flint)
* #26253 (update of psutils)
* yasm check is broken on FreeBSD (it's always YES!)
* #26602 (cephes removed)
* #26287 (update to gc, to the FreeBSD's version)
* #26288 (update to matplotlib, fixes compilation errors)
* #26190 (update to latte_int---which is an optional package)
* #26733 (update to openblas)
* #26315 (update to giac, to be able to use clang 6.0.1)
* #27262 (needed to link `sagelib` to libs from /usr/local/lib)

There is some hope that the `libgcc_s.so.1` problem will finally be [fixed in FreeBSD https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports/2019-April/115972.html]

The strategy which would pay off to make Sage an "easy" FreeBSD port is to add/enhance  as many needed by Sage external libraries as separate ports into FreeBSD, so that Sage does not need to vendor this. To this end, #27330 is very relevant ticket.

A first foray into this is enhancing FreeBSD's port of flint2 to be linkable with NTL (something that is a requirement for flint2 in Sage), see [here](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports/2019-February/115504.html). The necessary work on the flint2 side has been done in the meantime, see https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/543 - so now it's only the FreeBSD part that needs to be done.

Few obvious other candidates for a port in FreeBSD are gf2x and ecm.

This scipy [ticket:22679#comment:93 problem] is still there.

It's a matter of comparing the patches used there with what we do in Sage. Perhaps they disable multithreading...

A large part of #27330 is already in 9.0.
But yes, I think it's much better to wait for 9.1, or actually start using 9.1.betas 
(we're near the first release candidate).

IIRC FreeBSD has quite a few packages available, although they aren't always built
with pre-reqs needed for Sage, e.g. Flint is not built with NTL support.

I recently also added eclib, m4ri, gf2x, gp2c and the Pari packages (elldata, galdata, galpol, nftables and seadata).

And still going on!

Some news: I have just updated the WIP-port to 9.1.beta9: it is available at
https://reviews.freebsd.org/D24195

Every possible packages listed in #27330 are used as external packages, thanks for that!

Unfortunately, there remain some problems, mostly caused by staging (DESTDIR): a lot of libraries are referring to the directory where they have been built: e.g.

Error: 'lib/python3.7/site-packages/PIL/_imagingft.so' is referring to /usr/ports/math/sage/work/stage
Error: 'lib/libldl.so.2.2.6' is referring to /usr/ports/math/sage/work/stage

Is there some possibility to let them refer to relative directories?
How would you set SAGE_LOCAL?

To be more precise: I have played with SAGE_LOCAL and SAGE_DESTDIR.

The logical choice seemed to set SAGE_LOCAL=$PREFIX and SAGE_DESTDIR=$STAGEDIR, but this is not the case.

Actually, to be more positive, it mostly works!

Looking for the root of the problem, only 29 libraries are not fully staged - but of course, thereafter the other binaries using one of this library become affected.

ATM (with 9.1.beta9), my list of affected libraries is:

libamd.so.2 => /usr/ports/math/sage/work/stage/usr/local/lib/libamd.so.2

libbraiding.so.0 => /usr/ports/math/sage/work/stage/usr/local/lib/libbraiding.so.0

Some of them like libgc, brial, or fflas-ffpack should be fixed RSN (thanks to #27330 ).

I guess that the most problematic case is libsuitesparseconfig.so, which is widely used.

Meanwhile, our ports must be patched:

- lang/ecl: add a symbolic link for $PREFIX/lib/ecl

- math/maxima: this one is more tricky, because now ECL is not even supported and must be added, and to get a useful package we need to replace the default from SBCL to ECL (or create a slave port?)

there are many free Common Lisp implementations, I suppose there can be lang/cl as a "main" package with a number of slaves, perhaps SBCL as a standard one.

which bugs of maxima one prefers, is another question. :-)

our experience with updating maxima is that each new release has serious regressions.

This is great!

I guess we should make the Sagemath source FreeBSD-friendly, so that one can build
Sage from source using the standard ./configure + make route, right? This would need

* adding data for the needed packages, that is, there should be
  `build/pkgs/*/distros/freebsd.txt` files added with package names.

* adding pre-reqs data: `build/pkgs/freebsd.txt` and `build/pkgs/freebsd-bootstrap.txt`

* import patches you added in FreeBSD to Sage (if any)

The most important patch concerns configure.ac: without it, you cannot even run configure!

I submitted it with the system package information in #29653, but it has been rejected.

The other patches are mostly specific and related to the ports system, caused by differences in directories, but shouldn't be necessary for those trying to build Sage by themselves with the bundled packages.

I've revived a VM with FreeBSD, it's running 12.1-RELEASE-p6

How do I get the new port in there? Do I need a system update (if yes, to what?)?
Or it's easier?
I've run portsnap, and still see old stuff for sage in /usr/ports/math/sage.

You did the right thing!

- 12.1-RELEASE-p6 is OK

- `portsnap fetch update' is a well supported method - but I do not know how long it takes to be refreshed. I guess that if you try again is 1h or 2 it should be fine.

I guess there are two possibilities, one is portsnap is not updated yet (unlikely, IIRC it updates hourly), the other is it's tracking quarterly branch, and 9.1 is only in latest branch now.  I haven't used portsnap for a while so I might also be wrong.

To get the latest ports tree in real-time, you can try to use svn to checkout from:

https://svn.freebsd.org/ports/head

or git from

https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports
