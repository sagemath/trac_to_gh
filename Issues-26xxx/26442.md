It showed up immediately after the update though and never again after I reverted it. `SAGE_DEBUG` wasn't involved, but it probably had something to do with load, core count or something else thats different on a dedicated buildserver.

Haven't had any time to investigate much further yet. Although I don't really know what to do besides checking how reliable this reproduces.

551a5277456a3170dd690773e22f319cc1ad795a actually doesn't show this problem:

```
sage -t --long /nix/store/rppc0jilfm84ydj405mafd8kjzqr97rp-sage-src-8.5/src/sage/groups/additive_abelian/additive_abelian_group.py

```

Although I didn't adjust the sage patch, so there are some other failures like this:

```

    Basis matrix:

    [ 0  0  1 -4  2]
Got:

    Basis matrix:

Possible that there is some interaction.

Didn't test master yet.

I think that is it, at least `LD_DEBUG=libs python` shows 

```
calling init: /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so.1.0

I added some code to `cypari2` to better check for potential problems like this (and this is how I determined the problem). But then I found other issues in Sage, which are fixed by the dependency #27060.

So it remains to make a new `cypari2` release and then update this ticket.

Thank you for your work!

Not sure if the new version will need additional sage changes, but when I run current master (cc1d51071358d9deeeff65ba83a04da9735d4abd) with the patch from this branch I get

```
Failed example:
    complex_plot(zeta, (-30,30), (-30,30))
Expected:
    Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
Got:
    ERROR: sig_on_count = 1 during remove_from_pari_stack()
    ERROR: sig_on_count = 1 during remove_from_pari_stack()
    ERROR: sig_on_count = 1 during remove_from_pari_stack()
    ERROR: sig_on_count = 1 during remove_from_pari_stack()
    ERROR: sig_on_count = 1 during remove_from_pari_stack()
    ERROR: sig_on_count = 1 during remove_from_pari_stack()
    ERROR: sig_on_count = 1 during remove_from_pari_stack()
    ERROR: sig_on_count = 1 during remove_from_pari_stack()
[about a million more repetitions of this]
```

For a lot of tests.


Could you elaborate why the commit I pointed out cannot possibly be responsible for the issue I'm seeing?
