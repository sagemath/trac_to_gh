It showed up immediately after the update though and never again after I reverted it. `SAGE_DEBUG` wasn't involved, but it probably had something to do with load, core count or something else thats different on a dedicated buildserver.

When you run `./sage -f cypari`, it first uninstalls the package. So by the time you are installing again, there is "No record that 'cypari' was ever installed". I agree that the message is confusing, but it's completely normal.

That was with sage 8.5 with this ticket applied and pari 2.11.1.

Haven't had any time to investigate much further yet. Although I don't really know what to do besides checking how reliable this reproduces.

I'll try to narrow it down a bit. If all else fails, bisect cypari2 and find the commit that causes this.

That takes time, especially considering that each test requires a ptestlong. Again, is there any hurry for this? Presumably this will only make it into 8.7 either way right?

```
sage -t --long /nix/store/rppc0jilfm84ydj405mafd8kjzqr97rp-sage-src-8.5/src/sage/groups/additive_abelian/additive_abelian_group.py

So it remains to make a new `cypari2` release and then update this ticket.

Thank you for your work!

Not sure if the new version will need additional sage changes, but when I run current master (cc1d51071358d9deeeff65ba83a04da9735d4abd) with the patch from this branch I get

```
Failed example:
    complex_plot(zeta, (-30,30), (-30,30))
Expected:
    Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
Got:

    ERROR: sig_on_count = 1 during remove_from_pari_stack()
    ERROR: sig_on_count = 1 during remove_from_pari_stack()
[about a million more repetitions of this]
```

For a lot of tests.


Could you elaborate why the commit I pointed out cannot possibly be responsible for the issue I'm seeing?
