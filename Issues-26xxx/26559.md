I propose a correction for a bug in DiGraph.spectral_radius().

The problem.
The following code does'nt stop:
 sage: g = DiGraph([(0,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,0)], multiedges=True)
 sage: g.spectral_radius()

The solution.
The fact that it doesn't stop comes from the fact that the graph is not aperiodic. So I propose to raise a error when we detect that the graph is periodic thanks to the function DiGraph.is_aperiodic(), rather that going to an infinite loop.
