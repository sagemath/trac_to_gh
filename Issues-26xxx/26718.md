Our last upgrade of our threejs package was to Three.js r80 in #22226 in 2017-01.

In a [sage-support discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/bb6D_FkpJNQ/discussion) about 3D plotting on Arch Linux, [Antonio Rojas points out](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/bb6D_FkpJNQ/qRrYcBG9AwAJ) that:

> The three.js version shipped by Arch is too new and not supported by Sage.
> Either use jsmol (which is still the default), or use the online version of three.js
> (viewer='threejs', online=True) (with sagemath 8.4-4, in previous versions the
> online version doesn't work either).


Depends on #27568

CoCalc has independent threejs code. This used to be the case with SageMathCell, but since it leads to incompatibilities between different interfaces and adds maintenance load, I was very happy to ditch it when threejs got available in Sage itself. I have no plans to change it back ;-)

In the first line: Geometry().center() has changed behavior. 

There is some cleanup that needs to happen in the Three.js template before this upgrade. Then I’ll take care of this ticket.

Attachment: **[threejs-r100.tar.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket26718/threejs-r100.tar.gz)**

In a jupyter notebook, the following command

```
show(line3d([(1,2,3), (1,0,-2), (3,1,4), (2,1,-2)]), viewer='threejs')
```
results in a black box. If one click on it, one obtains an empty 3D frame, with no line drawn.

Sorry for the delay in replying and thanks for the update.
I've checked it in both python2 and python3 Sage. Everything seems OK. Some issues are not fixed by the upgrade to r100:

- the code

```
g = sphere(color='red', opacity=0.2)
g += sphere((0.5,0,0), color='lightgrey', opacity=0.4)
show(g, viewer='threejs')
```
results in a truncated grey sphere, with some spurious shaded layers, cf. the attached image: ![](two_spheres.png))
- the code

```
icosahedron(viewer='threejs')
```
yields a "rounded" icosahedron.

These issues were already there in r80 and I understand that it is not the scope of this ticket to fix them. So positive review and thanks for the upgrade!

Eric, thanks for the review. I have several enhancements in mind but will wait until this ticket is merged in the next beta.

The icosahedron can be fixed with flat shading. I've already identified a spot in the code that should work for all Platonic solids.

The problem with the spheres is just part of how transparency works in WebGL. If you rotate the figure you'll see that the red sphere is truncated itself from certain angles. WebGL renders transparent objects as if located entirely at the center of the object. Extended intersecting transparent objects will always experience these sorts of issues. I don't think there's much I can do about that.
