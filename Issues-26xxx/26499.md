How was the "source tarball" ​https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/releases/download/1.1.0/sagenb-1.1.0.tar.bz2 created? It doesn't correspond with the github repo. In particular, the repo does not contain a bundled mathjax (as it should be), while the "source tarball" does.

Please comment at #26641.

Naturally it is not quite the same as what you have in [GitHub](GitHub) report.
