There is a symlink `local/share/mathjax/mathjax` pointing to `local/share/mathjax`. Presumably, this was created by old sagenb versions.

This is creating trouble for the Sage documentation (see also #25111).

The bug that the symlink is created is fixed in #24646 (but not completely, see #26153). But the symlink should be removed if it already exists.

I also assumed that also but we are wrong! The symlink does get created when sagenb is rebuilt (this may also be a bug in the `sage-spkg` script). So there is certainly something to be fixed here.

I am unable to recreate the symlink. Can you do this reliably?

To test so far, I have created the symlink by hand, and then when I ran `make` with this branch, it got deleted. So that's good.

This is only a problem if you're doing things that you are not supposed to do, like removing the package installation record (the one in `local/var/lib/sage/installed`) without also removing the files installed by that package.  We can't account for every possible way someone's `$SAGE_LOCAL` is corrupted.

The issue caused by symlinks in this case is somewhat unique to symlinks, and the existing package installation code not handling existing symlinks properly; that's what #26153 is addressing.

We shouldn't worry about it too much but we also shouldn't ignore it either.

<a id='comment:17'></a>Maybe it would be better, in that case, if the file manifest were written *first*.  Currently it is only written after file installation is complete.  If it were written first then it would represent, at least, what is *supposed* to be in `$SAGE_LOCAL`, and then uninstallation can still be used for cleanup.

The only problem with that is that the manifest is written to the same file that indicates that installation succeeded.  Maybe it should be a separate file; I don't know.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but you could write the manifest in a temporary location (and use it there for uninstallation) and then install it after file installation is complete.

I thought I posted it here but maybe forgot. But yes, I arrived at the same conclusion independently, so that's probably the obvious thing to do.  Write it first to a temp file, then move it to its proper location once installation completes successfully.

The only trick is that those "temp" files still need to be written some place that the uninstaller can find it.  Maybe it would be the same file by with a `.tmp` extension added, with the uninstaller updated to also find those `.tmp` files.

What works for me is putting

%display latex

in a cell, and then it seems to use MathJax to show stuff in it.
So it might be that my memory is fuzzy at this point, and I'm confusing this with some
