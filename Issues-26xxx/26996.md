Presumably `/home/sverre/sage/local/lib64` is a symlink, and overwriting it with an actual directory fails.

Some informative background for anyone else wanting to report issues with copying over `lib64`:

When installing Sage SPKGs all library files (at least on Linux, BSD, and OSX) should go under `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.  This is because, in order for executables and other libraries to be able to find them, we typically link with an RPATH set to `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.  Libraries installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib64` thus won't be found.  This was worked around in the past by installing `lib64` is a symlink to `lib`.  This generally works but can be a bit misleading; it's better if SPKGs are properly configured to not install files into lib64 iin the first place.

An unintended consequence of #22509, where packages are first installed to a temporary location, and then copied from there into the `$SAGE_LOCAL` prefix, is that trying to overwrite a non-directory (i.e. the `lib64` symlink) with a real directory (a "lib64" that gets created in the temporary install location) will fail.  In general this is behavior we want to *keep*, because part of the point of the new install system from #22509 is that different SPKGs should not be overwriting things like in an unintended manner.  In this case it actively exposes cases where some packages are still trying to install files into lib64/, which are better to fix directly

**Note: For the case of gfortran this is fixed by #27016.**

I've spent more time understanding the gcc build system and the "multilib" settings, and now I understand Debian's patches better as well, which include patching many of the target config files under `gcc/config` to not use lib64.  I can see this on my own GCC on Debian by running

```
$ gcc -print-multi-os-directory
../lib
```

This path is appended to `${libdir}/` by the build system to specify the installation path for the target native libraries installed by gcc, so for example libstdc++.so would get installed to `${libdir}/../lib}`, or in other words just `lib/`.

However, with the target fragments in the gcc source, the bootstrap gcc that is built during stage 1 one of the build process ends up with `../lib64` for this, and hence builds all its libraries to also go in lib64.

However, I think I've figured out a bit of a hack to change the multilib settings without patching, in such a way that should work on any platform we care about.  I'll probably also propose an upstream patch to make this easier, because really it's pretty straightforward and otherwise supported by the build system.  It's just trickier than it should be to get the right flags specified in the right place.

Since this is only really an issue with installing the gcc and gfortran SPKGs on Linux, the specific case reported in this ticket is fixed by #27016, since those packages will no longer create files in lib64.

I opted for now to keep the symlink to lib64 just in case *something* needs it (though I can't find any specific case), and because having it will alert us in the future to packages trying to install files to lib64.

In the `spkg-install` for ecl there's a line

```

but no

```

This should also go in a `spkg-legacy-uninstall` script, but regardless, if you were updating from some older version, and it didn't delete the symlink, you would get this.

We apply a umask but that's different.  And I think it has `0` in the user bits, so that means if a file happens to be read-only for some reason that will be preserved.

The former is a problem with the GAP tarball.  I think we should just make a special case fix for that in the GAP spkg for now; see[comment:13](#comment%3A13).

I think the latter might be because of #27124 or possibly #27223.  In other words, it's likely that some previous bug meant the package could not be correctly uninstalled first.

```
I can't tell whether that's a good idea.

It looks like Sage's version of `tar_file.py` helps if the permissions in the tarball are too lenient, but not if they're too strict, as in this case.

Yeah, I wouldn't be opposed to that.  I don't think there's any good reason for a package to be *installing* read-only files.

This is because, in order for executables and other libraries to be able to find them, we typically link with an RPATH set to `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.  Libraries installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib64` thus won't be found.  This was worked around in the past by installing `lib64` is a symlink to `lib`.  This generally works but can be a bit misleading; it's better if SPKGs are properly configured to not install files into lib64 iin the first place.\n+\n+An unintended consequence of #22509, where packages are first installed to a temporary location, and then copied from there into the `$SAGE_LOCAL` prefix, is that trying to overwrite a non-directory (i.e. the `lib64` symlink) with a real directory (a \"lib64\" that gets created in the temporary install location) will fail.  In general this is behavior we want to *keep*, because part of the point of the new install system from #22509 is that different SPKGs should not be overwriting things like in an unintended manner.

 Presumably `/home/sverre/sage/local/lib64` is a symlink, and overwriting it with an actual directory fails.
 
-Note: For the case of gfortran this is fixed by #27016.
+Some informative background for anyone else wanting to report issues with copying over `lib64`:
+
+When installing Sage SPKGs all library files (at least on Linux, BSD, and OSX) should go under `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.  This is because, in order for executables and other libraries to be able to find them, we typically link with an RPATH set to `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.  Libraries installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib64` thus won't be found.  This was worked around in the past by installing `lib64` is a symlink to `lib`.  This generally works but can be a bit misleading; it's better if SPKGs are properly configured to not install files into lib64 iin the first place.
+
+An unintended consequence of #22509, where packages are first installed to a temporary location, and then copied from there into the `$SAGE_LOCAL` prefix, is that trying to overwrite a non-directory (i.e. the `lib64` symlink) with a real directory (a "lib64" that gets created in the temporary install location) will fail.  In general this is behavior we want to *keep*, because part of the point of the new install system from #22509 is that different SPKGs should not be overwriting things like in an unintended manner.  In this case it actively exposes cases where some packages are still trying to install files into lib64/, which are better to fix directly

+**Note: For the case of gfortran this is fixed by #27016.**

ISTM all *known* cases of this have been fixed.  In particular, fixing #27223 should fix many cases where this could crop up, since some files were not being properly uninstalled.

If it comes up again I would suggest opening a new ticket for that specific case.

I'm fixing this for `gfortran` in #29089
but the faulty copying from staging to $SAGE_LOCAL should be cleaned up in #22509.

an unpleasant part of it is that the installation attempt happens from within distutils or setuptools, called from within pillow's `setup.py`.

would it be better to make `lib64/` a proper directory, install stuff there, and then do a kind of postinstall that would move/link/copy stuff over to `lib/` ?
