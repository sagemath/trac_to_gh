```
In the README.md, we could have 2 lines for explaining how to build with Python 3, like (for instance):

instead of just:

```
To start the build, type make.
```

have:

```
To start the build, type `make`.

In case you want to run Sage on Python 3 -- WARNING:
for beta-testing purpose --, you can then type:
`make configure && ./configure --with-python=3 && make`.
```

Follow-up at #27156.
