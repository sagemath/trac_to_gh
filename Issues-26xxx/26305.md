The paper and the doctests of the function describe the following :

The degree of regularity of a semi-regular sequence `f_1, ...,f_m` of respective degrees `d_1,...,d_m` is given by the index of the first **non-positive** coefficient of:

`\sum c_k z^k = \frac{\prod (1 - z<sup>{d_i})}{(1-z)</sup>n}`
