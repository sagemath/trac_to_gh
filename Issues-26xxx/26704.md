Fix database.oeis module for python3 : 
- Remove a useless test
- Define `__getitem__` method with for `FancyTuple` object. It replace `__getslice__` method in python3.
As `__getslice__` is still defined in tuple in python 2.7 we still need a `__getslice__` method in `FancyTuple` to override it.

`__getslice__` is deprecated since python 2.6 and removed in python 3.x

What do you think is the most appropriate ? :
1. Leave as it is.
2. Add documentation.
3. Add documentation and doctests and then have the sames tests two times.
