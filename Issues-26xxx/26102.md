The function `search_doc` in `sage/misc/sagedoc.py` could be sped up: only search the `html` directory of `local/share/doc/sage`, and skip the `_static` subdirectories.

Some tests results on one computer (these obviously depend on the speed of the hard drive, among other things):

- with 8.4.beta1 (devel): `%time search_doc('curl')` takes about 65 seconds.
- with this branch: `%time search_doc('curl')` takes about 6 seconds.
