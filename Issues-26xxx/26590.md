```
./sage -btp --long src/sage/combinat/words
```

Before (with 8.5.beta1):

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t abstract_word.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t morphism.py  # 7 doctests failed
sage -t finite_word.py  # 4 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

After (with this branch):

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The failures in `finite_word.py` were due to #26591.
