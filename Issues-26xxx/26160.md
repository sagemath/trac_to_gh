I am seeing this in the occasional log file, here `fpylll-0.4.1dev.log`:

```
Error processing line 1 of /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/PYTHON3/sage-8.4.beta2/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/matplotlib-2.2.2-py3.6-nspkg.pth:

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/PYTHON3/sage-8.4.beta2/local/lib/python3.6/site.py", line 168, in addpackage
      exec(line)
    File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
    File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 568, in module_from_spec
  AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'loader'

Remainder of file ignored
```
The installation reports success, despite this warning.

I'm guessing that the `matplotlib` installation is writing the `.pth` file while the `fpylll` installation is trying to read it. I've only seen this with a Python 3 build, so it may be Python 3 specific.
