I am seeing this in the occasional log file, here `fpylll-0.4.1dev.log`:

```
Error processing line 1 of /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/PYTHON3/sage-8.4.beta2/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/matplotlib-2.2.2-py3.6-nspkg.pth:

  Traceback (most recent call last):

    File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 568, in module_from_spec
  AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'loader'

Remainder of file ignored
```
The installation reports success, despite this warning.

I'm guessing that the `matplotlib` installation is writing the `.pth` file while the `fpylll` installation is trying to read it. I've only seen this with a Python 3 build, so it may be Python 3 specific.

Are you sure that the race condition is related to the `.pth` file? I would guess that this is really #18438 which just happened to hit while processing a `.pth` file.

Though actually I think #26018 wouldn't solve this after all.  I think you might be right that it's a different race condition related to writing `.pth` files.  In #26018 we talked about maybe putting a lock around writing anything to a Python site-packages while simultaneously building other packages.

The problem with `.pth` files is that they are automatically loaded when starting up the Python interpreter.  So I could see that if a package that uses Sage's Python to install (such as fpylll) starts up the interpreter while some other package is in the middle of writing a `.pth` file this could blow up in a weird way.

So it's still more or less the same *issue* as #26018, but my solution there probably won't solve this case.
