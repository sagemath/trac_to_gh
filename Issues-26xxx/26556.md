I am not sure it makes sense to test twice if the base ring is finite. Why not do

```
if K in Fields.Finite:
    ...
elif K is ZZ:
    ...
else:
    raise NotImplementedError
```
(note that you do not have to actually construct the instance of the category to check containment).

Also, in `impossible_order`, should it be `GL_n(ZZ)`?

I might be too much an iterative programmer, but I don't see the point of having the `impossible_order` as a separate function, I don't see much benefit to not doing

```python
            # Check if o1 can be an order of a matrix in GL_n(QQ)
            # Uses Thm 2.7 [KuPa2002]
            fac = o1.factor()
            S = sum((pi - 1) * pi**(ei - 1) for pi, ei in fac)
            if S > n + int(fac[0] == (2, 1)):
                return Infinity
```

The doctests in `f829c4e` is likely to test only infinite order examples (a random matrix has infinite order). You would better add some known finite order examples (and also test conjugates).
