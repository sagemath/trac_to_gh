This is, I believe, a slight generalization of [ticket:12145].
Consider the two integrals:

```
sage: bos=integrate(x^a/(exp(x)-1),x,0,oo)
sage: ferm=integrate(x^a/(exp(x)+1),x,0,oo)
```
algorithm='sympy' returns unevaluated, while algorithm='maxima' returns a need for more assumptions, however even if I do:

```
sage: assume(a,'integer');assume(a>0)
```
and then redo the above, they remain unevaluated. On the other hand:

```
sage: mathematica('Integrate[x^n/(Exp[x]+1),{x,0,Infinity}]')
ConditionalExpression[(1 - 2^(-n))*Gamma[1 + n]*Zeta[1 + n], Re[n] > -1]
```
and

```
sage: mathematica('Integrate[x^n/(Exp[x]-1),{x,0,Infinity}]')
ConditionalExpression[Gamma[1 + n]*PolyLog[1 + n, 1], Re[n] > 0]
```
Curiously, this works if one plugs in an integer value for the exponent a (though the result is a bit ugly):

```
sage: integrate(x^5/(exp(x)+1),x,0,oo,algorithm='maxima')
-31/252*pi^6 + limit(1/6*x^6 - x^5*log(e^x + 1) - 5*x^4*dilog(-e^x) + 20*x^3*polylog(3, -e^x) - 60*x^2*polylog(4, -e^x) + 120*x*polylog(5, -e^x) - 120*polylog(6, -e^x), x, +Infinity, minus)
```
and

```
sage: integrate(x^5/(exp(x)-1),x,0,oo,algorithm='maxima')
-8/63*pi^6 + limit(-1/6*x^6 + x^5*log(-e^x + 1) + 5*x^4*dilog(e^x) - 20*x^3*polylog(3, e^x) + 60*x^2*polylog(4, e^x) - 120*x*polylog(5, e^x) + 120*polylog(6, e^x), x, +Infinity, minus)
```
but stays unevaluated if the exponent is not an integer.
Numerically it doesn't seem to have this problem:

```
sage: numerical_integral(x^5/(exp(x)+1),0,oo)
(118.26613095575462, 7.339448265242243e-05)
sage: numerical_integral(x^5.1/(exp(x)+1),0,oo)
(140.5258956087456, 5.885670920879882e-05)
```
and

```
sage: numerical_integral(x^5/(exp(x)-1),0,oo)
(122.08116743819632, 7.333630007522185e-05)
sage: numerical_integral(x^5.1/(exp(x)-1),0,oo)
(144.7463042740809, 5.877701373857569e-05)
```
As these are very common integrals in statistical physics, it would be nice if they could be implemented symbolically.
