The current version of `six.add_metaclass` does not preserve the original class's `__qualname__` attribute (as it is not normally stored in the class's `__dict__`):


```python
>>> from six import add_metaclass
>>> class A:
...     class B:
...         pass
...
>>> A.B
<class '__main__.A.B'>
>>> class MyMeta(type): pass
...
>>> class A:
...     @add_metaclass(MyMeta)
...     class B:
...         pass
...
>>> A.B
<class '__main__.B'>

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
Here I just monkey-patch `six.add_metaclass` at Sage import time.  This shouldn't be a problem, and allows us to avoid updating every existing import of `six.add_metaclass`.

I'm happy to update the imports instead of monkey-patch, but that carries with it the danger that if someone doesn't know to use `sage.misc.six.add_metaclass` they could repeat this mistake.

Alternatively, we replace *all* imports of `six` with `sage.misc.six` and use only the latter.  That will require a bit of fancy-footwork to make `six.moves` work but it's doable.
