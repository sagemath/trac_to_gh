Actually, the patchbot has one seemingly real failure:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/categories/finite_semigroups.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
due to a change in the output order.

Without `Integer`, we get:

```
sage: triangles_count(graphs.PetersenGraph())
{0: 0L, 1: 0L, 2: 0L, 3: 0L, 4: 0L, 5: 0L, 6: 0L, 7: 0L, 8: 0L, 9: 0L}
