Done in this ticket:
- update the module's documentation as we forgot to do it in #26447
- use `vertex_list` in several methods and also free data structure
- PEP8

Not done:
- method `spectral_radius` is untouched to avoid conflict with #26559

Actually, the patchbot has one seemingly real failure:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/categories/finite_semigroups.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
due to a change in the output order.
