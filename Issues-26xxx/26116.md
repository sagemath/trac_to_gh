Distributions don't (and won't) install `/etc/sage-started.txt`. However, one doctest relies on the existence of `SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage-started.txt`. So this fails everywhere/has to be patched away I guess.

I do not see why this stamp file needs any content at all. And so as I understand this the function `_write_started_file()` can go away and just be a `touch`. If somebody wonders what this file is about, they should just grep the source code and look at its timestamp.

Or am I missing something?

As I remember, Jeroen added that, when he was the release manager, has a way of proving that sage was properly built and functioning at the end of the building process.

Distro very much prefer to do it by running the test suite before the final install of course.
