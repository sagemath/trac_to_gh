Distributions don't (and won't) install `/etc/sage-started.txt`. However, one doctest relies on the existence of `SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage-started.txt`. So this fails everywhere/has to be patched away I guess.

I do not see why this stamp file needs any content at all. And so as I understand this the function `_write_started_file()` can go away and just be a `touch`. If somebody wonders what this file is about, they should just grep the source code and look at its timestamp.

Or am I missing something?

As I remember, Jeroen added that, when he was the release manager, has a way of proving that sage was properly built and functioning at the end of the building process.

Distro very much prefer to do it by running the test suite before the final install of course.

`sage-starts` is executed when the `sage-started.txt` target needs to be rebuilt. This target is called by all-start and build-start and it depends on STANDARD_PACKAGE_INSTS. So, the idea in [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) the distribution is that sage gets started after an SPKG has been installed so that the relocation scripts run (I guess.) The sage-started.txt file is not used anywhere else but in the Makefile as a timestamp for these *-start targets. For downstream distributions it has no meaning.

The "relocation script" `sage-location` is obsolete. I'd rather get rid of it completely, but it still exists for now.

Basically sage doesn't support that anymore. I think the binaries do something else now.

I am fairly sure I whined to Jeroen when he introduced this. So it would make me quite happy if you just removed the file as well as the doctest.
