Distributions don't (and won't) install `/etc/sage-started.txt`. However, one doctest relies on the existence of `SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage-started.txt`. So this fails everywhere/has to be patched away I guess.

I do not see why this stamp file needs any content at all. And so as I understand this the function `_write_started_file()` can go away and just be a `touch`. If somebody wonders what this file is about, they should just grep the source code and look at its timestamp.

Or am I missing something?

As I remember, Jeroen added that, when he was the release manager, has a way of proving that sage was properly built and functioning at the end of the building process.
