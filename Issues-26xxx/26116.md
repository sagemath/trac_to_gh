Distributions don't (and won't) install `/etc/sage-started.txt`. However, one doctest relies on the existence of `SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage-started.txt`. So this fails everywhere/has to be patched away I guess.

I do not see why this stamp file needs any content at all. And so as I understand this the function `_write_started_file()` can go away and just be a `touch`. If somebody wonders what this file is about, they should just grep the source code and look at its timestamp.

Or am I missing something?

Basically sage doesn't support that anymore. I think the binaries do something else now.

I am fairly sure I whined to Jeroen when he introduced this. So it would make me quite happy if you just removed the file as well as the doctest.

Well sage-location was supposed to be run when you moved the sage tree. Basically sage doesn't support that anymore. I think the binaries do something else now. So `sage-location` has outlived its use and it had a host of issues about getting the right behavior on various platforms. So I guess that's why it is "obsolete", you shouldn't use it.

Going back to `sage-starts` I think it is perfectly fine to just remove the file and the doctest (unsurprisingly, I don't ship the file and I have a very similar looking patch for `all.py` - the only difference is a line saying `# Don't do that on Gentoo.`). I am fairly sure I whined to Jeroen when he introduced this. So it would make me quite happy if you just removed the file as well as the doctest. I cannot find `sage-starts` in the doc so nothing else should be removed.
