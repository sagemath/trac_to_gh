As suggested by Pascal Molin, the hash of an element α of QQbar/AA could be based on that element perturbed by a transcendental number, to avoid triggering exact computations even in unlucky cases.

(There is a comment in `AlgebraicNumber_base.__hash__()` noting that the effort to avoid exact computation is probably wasted because we'll do a comparison if the hashes match, but this ignores the common case where we are retrieving an element of a hash table using the same physical object that was stored as a key.)

Note that this is not the case currently:

```
sage: hash(2/3)

```

Is there some way to check quickly if an element is rational?

Thanks Travis. Indeed, the hash is not compatible with anything because of `AA_hash_offset` and `QQbar_hash_offset`. However is it desirable to have them compatible with rationals? Or at least integers?

No. You need to compute the degree of the minimal polynomial (ie exactify). However there are numerical tricks to guess (and works well if the denominator is not too big).

Indeed, the hash is not compatible with anything because of `AA_hash_offset` and `QQbar_hash_offset`. However is it desirable to have them compatible with rationals?

However there are numerical tricks to guess (and works well if the denominator is not too big).\n\nPerhaps we could use some test that discards a number of cases when the element is definitely not rational? Then for the cases that remain, we run `exactify`? Would there be other issues with equality and hashing that could come up without calling `exactify`?",

Probably because of the fact coercion makes them be `==`.

Perhaps we could use some test that discards a number of cases when the element is definitely not rational? Then for the cases that remain, we run `exactify`? Would there be other issues with equality and hashing that could come up without calling `exactify`?
