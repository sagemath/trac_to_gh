Cryptominisat accepts xor clauses but is currently not able to read DIMACS files with such clauses, see [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43603/usage-of-cryptominisat/).

Since some other solvers might accept xor clauses, the parsing of such clauses is done on the generic solver.

Also a little nitpick, but error messages (following Python conventions) do not start with a capital letter.
