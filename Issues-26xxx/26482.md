Python3-based Sage seems to start up much slower than Python2-based Sage.

Since #26908 this is vastly improved.  Startup time is still a bit slower than on Python 2, but it's much more marginal, and it might be harder to track down any specific deficiencies in this area.  Though I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from trying.

I still believe there are big gains to be made in general with lazy imports.  I don't think we need to really import *everything* that makes up the Sage global namespace if we can replace most of it with proxies.
