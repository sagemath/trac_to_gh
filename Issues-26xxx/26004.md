This patch makes `is_sectionally_complemeted` much faster. For the Boolean lattice of `2^10` elements with meet and join already computed it takes about three seconds to compute before the patch, about 10 milliseconds with the patch. Also, the patch works without need to compute the join matrix.

For `sum(1 for L in LL10 if L.is_sectionally_complemented())`, where `LL10` is the list of all non-isomorphic lattices up to 10 element, the time drops from 190 to 160 milliseconds.
