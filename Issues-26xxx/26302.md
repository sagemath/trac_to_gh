When creating a `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`, we may have no control on the order in which the (one-dimensional) variables are defined (because of complicated loops).

When we use the `polyhedron` method, the basis of the underlying vector space is ordered according to some order on the variables, which basically follows the order in which they are defined.

However, there is no simple way to get this order for the user. We need a method to get this order if we want to be able to connect information provided by the polytope (e.g. its set of integral points) to the original linear problem.

To provide a concrete example of the issue, see my answer of [this as question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43581/how-to-find-the-spanning-elementary-subgraphs-of-a-given-graph/).

I'm not aware of all the ways to use `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`, create variables, use vectors of variables, etc.

At least, in class `MIPVariable`, we can add a list to record the order in which variables of of that class are created. It suffices to add the key to that list inside method `__getitem__`.

In your answer to that ask.sagemath question,
you can simplify

```
 for edge in G.edges(labels=False):
        p.add_constraint(e[edge] >= 0)
```
to

```
[ e[edge] for edge in G.edges(labels=False) ]
```

MIP variables are stored in a dictionary. So even if you touch them in a certain order, you rely on the ordering of the keys of the dictionary, which might be different.
Storing keys in a list in the order of creation ensures that we get the same order.

Nonetheless, why is the order of the keys of the dictionary not sufficient ? We have an ordering of instances of class MIPVariable inside `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` (it's a list), and then we have the order of the keys.

No, the mapping to backend indices is created in `MIPVariable.__getitem__,` which calls `backend.add_variable`.
This is why just referencing `e[edge]` creates the order.
