If one tries to `plot` a modular form the plot code tries to evaluate the modular form as a function on floats, which fails. Essentially this boils down to floats not having a `.parent()` (see traceback at end).

There are two potential fixes, neither of which I had opportunity to test yet, but would like thoughts on:
- Modify the line `Q = a.parent()` of `src/sage/rings/power_series_poly.pyx` to something like

```
         from sage.structure import parent
         Q = parent(a)
```
which might make power series a bit more resilient to being passed python types as input, this might be a change which should be made across a lot of Sage in that case?

- Or modify plotting code (`generate_plot_points`) to not use floats, I guess this might come with some performance hit to plotting.
