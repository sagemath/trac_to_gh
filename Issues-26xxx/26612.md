The problem reported in #26152 has returned, it seems. As a result, users may end up with a symlink `SAGE_SHARE/mathjax/mathjax` pointing to its parent directory, and this ends up producing a directory `SAGE_DOC/html/en/reference/_static/mathjax` which contains a subdirectory `mathjax` which also contains a subdirectory `mathjax`, etc., hence needlessly using gigabytes of disk space. Let's get rid of these problematic files.

To clarify: which self-referential symlink do you mean? You are talking about sagenb here, but #26152 was about `local/share/mathjax/mathjax`.

I mean the one `SAGE_LOCAL/share/mathjax/mathjax` that points to `SAGE_LOCAL/share/mathjax`.  Force-installing `sagenb` on that machine recreates this link.

*This* is #26612, so your comment is as self-referential as the symlink.

There is no fix in place which actually cleans up the bad symlink and the bad docbuild. Is that really acceptable?
