The problem reported in #26152 has returned, it seems. As a result, users may end up with a symlink `SAGE_SHARE/mathjax/mathjax` pointing to its parent directory, and this ends up producing a directory `SAGE_DOC/html/en/reference/_static/mathjax` which contains a subdirectory `mathjax` which also contains a subdirectory `mathjax`, etc., hence needlessly using gigabytes of disk space. Let's get rid of these problematic files.

along with a command at the start of sagenb's installation to remove the directory `sagenb/data/mathjax`, if it is not a symlink. Or maybe unconditionally.
