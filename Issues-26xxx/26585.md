Note: This does not happen currently in Sage, but does result from attempts to add multi-threading support to fflas-ffpack.

Multiplying a 1000x1000 matrix over GF(11) causes a segfault on a 32 core server.

```
sage: a=random_matrix(GF(11),1000)
sage: b = a*a
Erreur de segmentation
```

gdb says it comes from OpenBLAS thread manager.

```
Thread 48 "python" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
