Note: This does not happen currently in Sage, but does result from attempts to add multi-threading support to fflas-ffpack.

Multiplying a 1000x1000 matrix over GF(11) causes a segfault on a 32 core server.

```
sage: a=random_matrix(GF(11),1000)
sage: b = a*a
Erreur de segmentation
```

gdb says it comes from OpenBLAS thread manager.

```
Thread 48 "python" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

I have a suspicion that this is an openblas bug but it's not clear yet.

Somehow, it seems like, the `blas_thread_init` routine is being called multiple times, when it shouldn't be.

Hmm; I think I see the problem.
When the openblas library is first initialized it runs through a number of initialization routines, including a function called `blas_thread_init`.

This prevents any subsequent calls to `blas_thread_init` from doing anything.

Normally the only way `blas_server_avail` gets reset to zero is if the function `blas_thread_shutdown` is called.  This can be called manually, I think, though there is usually any reason to. But there is one case in which it does get called transparently:  When openblas is initialized it registers a `pthread_atfork` handler to call `blas_thread_shutdown` prior to forking (so that the child process gets a clean threading state).
