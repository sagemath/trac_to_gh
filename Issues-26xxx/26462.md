As discussed in #22173, the genus-two hyperelliptic curve invariants are just binary sextic invariants. And the reconstruction is just binary sextic reconstruction. These can be applied more generally. Also, there will be too many things in the global namespace and too many classes if we continue in the old way.

* Move the internal workings of the invariants and reconstruction to the same place as where the quintic case (#26370, #25508) is implemented.

* Deprecate `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` and add its functionality to `HyperellipticCurve` (with keywords) in such a way that it is also ready for higher genus, move `Mestre_conic` from the global namespace to the `invariant_theory` module.

* Add method `invariants` to a general class of (hyperelliptic?) curves regardless of genus, which accepts a keyword to select invariants, and does Igusa-Clebsch invariants in case of genus 2.
