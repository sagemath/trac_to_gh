I just tried to build the current beta and had `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes`. cvxopt failed because

```
cp: cannot stat 'html/*': No such file or directory
```

I am not sure if the component should be "documentation" or "packages: standard"

no, sorry, it wasn't completely working, due to MathJax issues.
