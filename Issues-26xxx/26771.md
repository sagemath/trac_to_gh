This ticket is being opened to describe proposed work for an coding sprint at the IMA.

In 2011, [Chekhov and Shapiro](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3963) introduced a generalization of cluster algebras in which the exchange polynomials are allowed to have arbitrarily many terms.

We aim to add generalized cluster algebra functionality and related methods necessary to implement the current understanding of these algebras in Sage.  This will be accomplished by building upon the framework established by Rupel and Stella's [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/cluster_algebra.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/cluster_algebra.html) implementation of cluster algebras.

Our major functionality objectives are:
* adding the ability to mutate with arbitrary exchange polynomials to the current ClusterAlgebra package;
* implementing generalized mutation for coefficients subject to the normalization conditions defined by [Tomoki Nakanishi](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5967);
* creating methods for calculating left and right companion cluster algebras;
* creating a method for unfolding cluster algebras.

The default behavior generally assumes one person pushing to a private branch.  The solution here is to stop using the default bahavior.

Instead, please run something like:

```
git trac push --branch public/ticket-26771 26771
```

This will set the branch name for the ticket to `public/ticket-26771` and subsequent pushes will continue to use that upstream branch, rather than constantly switching it between your private branches.  

Locally your branch is still yours to work in.  It's just when you push/pull that you will have to resolve conflicts, etc.

Dear All,

I would like to be the one giving the final green light to this ticket: it changes quite a lot of the implementation of `ClusterAlgebra` so I would prefer to make sure that things still works as expected.
As you know, I am quite busy with my personal life at the moment so please allow me some extra time to process this.

First of all please accept my apologies for taking so long before reviewing this.

I think that the code in this ticket is far from being ready for a positive
review for several reasons.

First of all there is still some debugging scaffolding left over, e.g. at lines
just after 1275. This, and any other such, should be removed.

Talking of these lines, is `//` really not working? If so this could explain the major
issue I will point out later on.

Second the code introduces a lot of unnecessary small changes like spaces and
newlines that make the patch much bigger than it needs to be. Unnecessary white
spaces at the end of lines should be avoided. It looks to me that the code here
was based on #28176 before it was finalized and therefore it redoes/undoes many of
the changes already implemented there. Please remove all of those; ideally this
thicket should be rebased on the current develop. I tried doing so but it is not
working automagically so someone (else) familiar with the changes should do it. 

Similarly the code should be better formatted avoiding long lines and using the
correct spacing.

On a more substantial note, the use of both `d` and `Z` is redundant. I
understand that one wants to allow `d` as an input but there is no need to carry
over both of them in the implementation.

Why are you keeping around two copies of the greedy_element framework?

The major obstacle to giving a positive review to this code is the big slowdown
it introduces. For example here is the old version in action on my laptop

```
  sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['E',8],foo=random())
  ....: S = A.seeds(mutating_F = False)
  ....: %time _ = list(S)
  CPU times: user 21.4 s, sys: 209 ms, total: 21.6 s
  Wall time: 21.6 s
  sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['E',8],foo=random())
  ....: %time A.explore_to_depth(infinity)
  CPU times: user 23.9 s, sys: 191 ms, total: 24.1 s
  Wall time: 24.1 s
```

and here is the new one:

```
  sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['E',8],foo=random())
  ....: S = A.seeds(mutating_F = False)
  ....: %time _ = list(S)
  CPU times: user 1min 35s, sys: 1.69 s, total: 1min 37s
  Wall time: 1min 37s
```

exploring the exchange graph while computing cluster variables with the new code
does not terminate in any reasonable amount of time (I killed it after 30
minutes).

I see three possible reasons for this slowdown: 

- the algorithms are inherently slower for generalized cluster algebras

- working over symbolic rings is slow

- you are using `/` rather than `//`

I doubt the reason is the third one since the slowdown appear also when not
mutating F_polynomials. The code computing mutations of seeds uses just basic
linear algebra and a 400% slowdown in it indicates some major issue.

If the reasons are the first two I would strongly advice to retool this
implementation according to this scheme: 

- write a base class in which all the common code is located

- add two more classes ClusterAlgebra and GeneralizedClusterAlgebra that inherit
  from the base class

In doing so please make sure that no significant slowdown is introduced in the
current code.

Thanks Salvatore for the detailed report!  

There is quite some work to do to try to speed up the divisions because of the symbolic expressions and the exponential growth in terms due to the higher degree exchange polynomials.  I am sure that digging into the implementation of polynomial division and carefully sorting terms would eliminate some issues coming from the explosion of terms.  More precisely, taking the cluster variables as degree 0 and the exchange coefficients as degree 1 to organize the division should give quite a speed up, but the effort may not be worth the time expense to implement this.  Probably retooling as you say at the end is the way to go.
