To this day I still don't have a solid understanding of how the coercion framework works and when to use `_pow_` versus `__pow__` for example.  

In this case it was fixing an already existing `__pow__` but if you think this should be changed (and I don't disagree; I just don't know why) perhaps there should be a ticket for that.
