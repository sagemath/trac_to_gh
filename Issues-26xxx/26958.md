The following crashes sage with a SIGSEGV:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular import MPolynomialRing_libsingular
sage: class Foo(MPolynomialRing_libsingular):
....:     pass
sage: Foo(QQ, 2, ['x','y'], 'degrevlex')
```
Strangely enough this bug is triggered only when inheriting; indeed the following works as expected:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular import MPolynomialRing_libsingular
sage: MPolynomialRing_libsingular(QQ, 2, ['x','y'], 'degrevlex')
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```

As it turns out this bug is due to a spurious call to `__init_extra__` of `Algebras(...).parent_class`. Univariate polynomial rings avoid this call by setting  the attribute `_no_generic_basering_coercion = True`; now multivariate polynomial rings do so too.

Although maybe a minor comment about the code: can you replace

```
cdef public bool _no_generic_basering_coercion
```
by

```
cdef readonly _no_generic_basering_coercion
```
and remove the `bool` cimport (which serves no purpose)?

Done, thanks for the review.

A side note worth noting for #25558: after this patch it is possible to inherit from `MPolynomialRing_libsingular` but it is not possible to change its element class because the element constructor uses a function, `new_MP`, which hardcodes its output.
