As discussed [ticket:26097#comment:21 here], IPython has its own pprint library which, like the stdlib's, normally displays dicts such that their output is sorted by key.

However, it is not doing this on Python 3.6+, which it turns out is by design.  Instead it opts to keep the dict's "natural" insertion order which is preserved in CPython 3.6+.

However, there is a global flag to control this, which we should set at least for running the doctests.  I agree that for normal usage the default behavior is desirable, but for the sake of the doctests it's easier to make the output as close to Python 2 as possible, at least until we drop Python 2 support.

Fixing this should fix a number of trivial test failures.
