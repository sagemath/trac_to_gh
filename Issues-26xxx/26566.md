Done in this ticket:
- extend the definition of parameter `translation` of `dense_graph_init` to allow passing a mapping from vertices to integers or from integers to vertices. We thus save several calls to `.vertices()`.
- PEP8 cleaning

This new functionality should be used in `independent_sets.pyx` and `vertex_separation.pyx`, but after the merging of #26446 and #26520.
