`map` is an iterator in Python3, so some care is needed.
- in `strongly_regular_db.pyx`, the graph constructor was called with a set of vertices defined by a map. We ensure that we build the list of vertices first.
- same for the call to method `IntersectionGraph`.

We also fix some issues with `bytes` and `str`.

This passes doctests with Python3 but not with Python2. There is an encoding issue as the database contains `Östergård`.

What should I do ?

`open(...)` does not accept the encoding parameter in Python2 (`TypeError: 'encoding' is an invalid keyword argument for this function`). It works with Python3.

I also tried to put `encoding='utf-8'` in `json.load(...)` but it does not solve the issue in Python2 :(

Try this !^

The problem with the original code, on Python 2, was that it was interpolating unicode strings into templates that were non-unicode strings.  On Python 2 this results in implicit encoding of the unicode strings as ASCII, which results in a `UnicodeEncodeError` for any comments that contain non-ASCII characters.

Would have been better if the original code just used unicode strings for the error messages in the first place.  Now, since this is Cython code, we can use f-strings which are implicitly unicode anyways, and make the formatting look a bit nicer.

It's way nicer. I didn't know `f-strings` which seems very convenient.
However, I still get `Kaski & \xd6sterg\xe5rd` instead of `Kaski & Östergård` with py2 :(
