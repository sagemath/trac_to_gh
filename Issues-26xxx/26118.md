Strangely `SAGE_NUM_THREADS=160 sage -tp --long --all` produces lots of timeouts on a 160 core machine.

It turns out that only a few cores are actually used (three or four most of the time) which seems to be related to the set CPU affinity.

One workaround `export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`.

Or we could `export OPENBLAS_MAIN_FREE=1` to disable OPENBLAS' threading affinity.

The FAQ explains what these options do: https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/faq

---

Here are some benchmarks:

```
sage: m=load('/tmp/matrix') # a 500x500 RDF matrix
sage: %timeit m.eigenvalues()
1 loop, best of 3: 1.78 s per loop # currently
1 loop, best of 3: 911 ms per loop # with OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
```

Note that the first one causes 100% load on 130 of the 160 cores and the second one only causes 100% load on a single core. (Yes, it's faster anyway.)

I also tried with all sorts of combinations of SAGE_NUM_THREADS*, OPENBLAS_MAIN_FREE and always got around 1.8s and 100% load on 130 cores. I'v sometimes seen segfaults that were not reproducible but never with OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1.

With an initial workaround, that set the CPU affinity before forking:

Btw., with that workaround often the following part of the "A tour of Sage" in all languages hangs:

```
Trying (line 99):    m = random_matrix(RDF,500)
Expecting nothing
ok [0.09 s]
Trying (line 108):    e = m.eigenvalues()  # ungefähr 2 Sekunden
Expecting nothing
```

So maybe this has something to do with some BLAS?

`SAGE_NUM_THREADS=160 sage -tp --long --all` btw crashes with segfaults in `gentourng`; that's probably unrelated.

`SAGE_NUM_THREADS=1 SAGE_NUM_THREADS_PARALLEL=160 sage -tp --long --all` works however, and finishes after 4 minutes (which is the time that sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_number_field takes…)

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here.  Julian suggested that it's a problem that occurs in "normal usage".  Is there a way to reproduce this problem without having to run `make ptestlong`?

In any case it sounds like a bug that should be fixed in openblas, not hackishly worked around.  The reason I'm confused is that in the doctests we fork for every test, so I don't see why there would be a problem with thread CPU affinity since from test to test it's not even going to be reusing the same threads.

Perhaps I need to study more carefully what exactly this option is doing in openblas.

I'm surprised `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1` didn't work for you:

```c
#ifdef USE_OPENMP
  numprocs = 0;
#else
  numprocs = readenv_atoi("OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS");
  if (numprocs == 0) numprocs = readenv_atoi("GOTO_NUM_THREADS");
#endif

  if (numprocs == 0) numprocs = readenv_atoi("OMP_NUM_THREADS");

  numnodes = 1;

  if (numprocs == 1) {
    disable_mapping = 1;
    return;
  }
```

Nevermind, apparently it did: [#26118 comment:4](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/26118#comment:4)
I misread something else.
