This line in `sage-spkg`

```
$SAGE_SUDO mv "$PREFIX/$filename" "${SAGE_LOCAL%/}/$filename"
```
might move a file `$filename` (to be installed) into a *directory* `$filename` (if the latter was an existing directory).

This can occur in particular with symlinks to directories, since those can be interpreted both as file and as directory. This is partially responsible for #26152.

Depends on #26011
