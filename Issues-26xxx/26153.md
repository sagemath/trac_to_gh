This line in `sage-spkg`

```
$SAGE_SUDO mv "$PREFIX/$filename" "${SAGE_LOCAL%/}/$filename"
```
might move a file `$filename` (to be installed) into a *directory* `$filename` (if the latter was an existing directory).

This can occur in particular with symlinks to directories, since those can be interpreted both as file and as directory. This is partially responsible for #26152.

Depends on #26011

Or, it seems, a symlink pointing to a directory.  That's the real problem.

It's not really "fixed" by #26011 in the sense that the condition now becomes a hard error (after #26642), failing the installation. Ideally, it should *overwrite* any existing directories.

That being said, I think that you can only do so much with simple shell scripts. Anything more complicated should really be done in Python.
