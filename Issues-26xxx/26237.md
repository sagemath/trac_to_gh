We explicitly declare things to be `int` type so Cython can generate better C code.

If it is not, I might also recycle this ticket with some Cython tweaks to `IntegerMatrix` to try and squeeze a bit more speed out of it.

The method GenericMatrix.is_nonzero seems to be called only by LeanMatrix.gauss_jordan_reduce() and LeanMatrix.nonzero_positions_in row().

LeanMatrix.pivot() does not even use is_nonzero(), but ‘s=self.get_unsafe(i,y)’ followed by ‘if s and ..’ (line 303 of lean_matrix.pyx). Apparently the conversion to a bool implicit in ‘if s’ does work in that context. It may be more effcient too, since depending on the base ring evaluating s!=0 may involve casting 0 as a ring element. I’m quite sure that for finite fields ‘if s’ is about 5 times faster than ‘if (s!=0)’.

So it may also be a solution to rewrite LeanMatrix.gauss_jordan_reduce() and LeanMatrix.nonzero_positions_in row() in the more efficient way used in pivot(), completely avoiding the use of is_nonzero().

Sorry, I was trying to answer quickly while I was out.

So when I explicitly tell Cython that `get` should return an `int`, then I have to do this change

```diff
     cdef bint is_nonzero(self, long r, long c) except -2:   # Not a Sage matrix operation
-        return self.get(r, c)
+        return self.get(r, c) != 0
```
otherwise I get the original error message in the ticket description.

But in the latter case, the matrix is over `ZZ`, so I would not think that is the problem.

What I was hoping to do was take advantage of the known return types in the integer matrix to improve the Cython code. With the explicit casting, my computation goes from 13.6s to 3s.

First of all, that's a bad idea: a C int has limited range (typically 32 bits) and you cannot guarantee that all entries fit in that.

I don't consider that a bug. The reason is that the conversion of a Python object to a `bint` essentially translates to `int(bool(obj))` while the conversion to an `int` translates to `int(obj)`.

-I am trying to compute things with some linear matroids whose representation matrices have integer values. Because the generic code is too slow, I wanted to use the more specialized code directly:
 
-```
-sage: from sage.matroids.linear_matroid import LinearMatroid
-sage: from sage.matroids.lean_matrix import IntegerMatrix
-sage: M = LinearMatroid(matrix=IntegerMatrix(4,3,matrix([[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]])))
-sage: M.circuits()
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-SystemError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
-<ipython-input-42-8adfde621a57> in <module>()
-----> 1 M.circuits()
-
-SystemError: error return without exception set
-```
-However, this works if I use `GenericMatrix`.
-
-This also occurs by doing things directly in the global namespace:
-
-```
-sage: M = Matroid(matrix=matrix([[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]), regular=True)
-sage: M.circuits()
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-SystemError: error return without exception set

-There is definitely a bug at least somewhere.

I just looked at the Cython sources for `lean_matrix.pyx` and `IntegerMatrix` does indeed use `int` internally. Therefore, returning `int` in `get()` is correct in that sense.

However... this just shows that using `IntegerMatrix` in general looks dangerous: operations can overflow. This is actually documented in the docstring of `IntegerMatrix`:

```
        This class is mainly intended for use with the RegularMatroid class,
        so entries are assumed to be small integers. No
        overflow checking takes place!
```

Again, since you want to use IntegerMatrix in the LinearMatroid subclasses, and since you need a matrix where pivoting is safe, really the only use case is Regular Matroids where overflows are never an issue.

So I have gotten a somewhat working `RationalMatrix` version working, but I am having a bit of an issue with getting things to work like I expected. In Cython, are things pass-by-reference or pass-by-copy (like C)?
