So like Python, it is faster to create a tuple from a list (comprehension) than from a generator:

```
sage: %%cython
....: def foo(n):
....:     return tuple([i for i in range(n)])
....: def bar(n):
....:     return tuple(i for i in range(n))
....: 
sage: %timeit foo(100)
The slowest run took 9.13 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.85 µs per loop
sage: %timeit bar(100)
The slowest run took 4.90 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.07 µs per loop
```
For `frozenset`, it is also faster, but not as pronounced:

```
sage: %%cython
....: def foo(n):
....:     return frozenset([i for i in range(n)])
....: def bar(n):
....:     return frozenset(i for i in range(n))
....: 
sage: %timeit foo(100)
The slowest run took 6.06 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.32 µs per loop
sage: %timeit bar(100)
The slowest run took 12.88 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.81 µs per loop
```
