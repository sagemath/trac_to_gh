Some while ago, I contributed to Sage some code for computing the local component (at a given prime) of the automorphic representation attached to a modular form, based on algorithms from a paper I wrote with Jared Weinstein.

The existing implementation is incomplete in several ways:
- it throws an error if the given modular form doesn't have minimal level at p among its character twists;
- if the local component is supercuspidal, induced from a character of a ramified quadratic extension, then it doesn't completely compute the character, it just returns a string saying which extension it comes from;
- in supercuspidal 2-adic cases where the level is divisible by 64, it fails because a certain quotient group that comes up in the computation isn't cyclic.

I have now reworked the code to fill in all of the above gaps. It should now work for all newforms and all primes, with the exception of certain nasty 2-adic cases where no nice parametrisation exists. In particular, with the new code the following example works, fulfilling a request from Ariel Pacetti:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("575c1")
sage: Pi = E.newform().local_component(5)
sage: Pi.characters()
[
Character of Q_5*, of level 1, mapping 2 |--> 1/2*a, 5 |--> 1/2*a + 2,
Character of Q_5*, of level 1, mapping 2 |--> -1/2*a, 5 |--> -1/2*a + 2
]
```

I hopefully fixed the merge failure and a couple of deprecation warnings.  There seems to be one actual doctest failure:

```
File "src/sage/modular/local_comp/local_comp.py", line 704, in sage.modular.local_comp.local_comp.PrimitiveSupercuspidal.characters
Failed example:
    Newforms(DirichletGroup(64, QQ).1, 2, names='a')[0].local_component(2).characters() # long time
Expected:
    [
    Character of unramified extension Q_2(s)* (s^2 + s + 1 = 0), of level 3, mapping s |--> 1, 2*s + 1 |--> -1/4*a0, 4*s + 1 |--> -1, -1 |--> 1, 2 |--> 1,
    Character of unramified extension Q_2(s)* (s^2 + s + 1 = 0), of level 3, mapping s |--> 1, 2*s + 1 |--> -1/4*a0, 4*s + 1 |--> 1, -1 |--> 1, 2 |--> 1
    ]
Got:
    [
    Character of unramified extension Q_2(s)* (s^2 + s + 1 = 0), of level 3, mapping s |--> 1, 2*s + 1 |--> 1/2*a0, 4*s + 1 |--> 1, -1 |--> 1, 2 |--> 1,

I read through the code and it looks good.  I made various minor changes to better conform to Sage's style guide.  The one substantive change I made was to move the line `t = self.discrete_log(n, p)` outside a loop.

I'm going to give this a positive review now, but we should keep an eye on the patchbot results.  I'm also hopeful that I can help with improving speed eventually using #26849 (which still needs work).  Finally, what's the theoretical status on the missing 2-adic cases?
