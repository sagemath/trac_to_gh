Some while ago, I contributed to Sage some code for computing the local component (at a given prime) of the automorphic representation attached to a modular form, based on algorithms from a paper I wrote with Jared Weinstein.

The existing implementation is incomplete in several ways:
- it throws an error if the given modular form doesn't have minimal level at p among its character twists;
- if the local component is supercuspidal, induced from a character of a ramified quadratic extension, then it doesn't completely compute the character, it just returns a string saying which extension it comes from;
- in supercuspidal 2-adic cases where the level is divisible by 64, it fails because a certain quotient group that comes up in the computation isn't cyclic.

I have now reworked the code to fill in all of the above gaps. It should now work for all newforms and all primes, with the exception of certain nasty 2-adic cases where no nice parametrisation exists. In particular, with the new code the following example works, fulfilling a request from Ariel Pacetti:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("575c1")
sage: Pi = E.newform().local_component(5)
sage: Pi.characters()
[
Character of Q_5*, of level 1, mapping 2 |--> 1/2*a, 5 |--> 1/2*a + 2,
Character of Q_5*, of level 1, mapping 2 |--> -1/2*a, 5 |--> -1/2*a + 2
]
```

I hopefully fixed the merge failure and a couple of deprecation warnings.  There seems to be one actual doctest failure:

```
File "src/sage/modular/local_comp/local_comp.py", line 704, in sage.modular.local_comp.local_comp.PrimitiveSupercuspidal.characters
Failed example:
    Newforms(DirichletGroup(64, QQ).1, 2, names='a')[0].local_component(2).characters() # long time
Expected:
    [
    Character of unramified extension Q_2(s)* (s^2 + s + 1 = 0), of level 3, mapping s |--> 1, 2*s + 1 |--> -1/4*a0, 4*s + 1 |--> -1, -1 |--> 1, 2 |--> 1,
    Character of unramified extension Q_2(s)* (s^2 + s + 1 = 0), of level 3, mapping s |--> 1, 2*s + 1 |--> -1/4*a0, 4*s + 1 |--> 1, -1 |--> 1, 2 |--> 1
    ]
Got:
    [
    Character of unramified extension Q_2(s)* (s^2 + s + 1 = 0), of level 3, mapping s |--> 1, 2*s + 1 |--> 1/2*a0, 4*s + 1 |--> 1, -1 |--> 1, 2 |--> 1,
    Character of unramified extension Q_2(s)* (s^2 + s + 1 = 0), of level 3, mapping s |--> 1, 2*s + 1 |--> 1/2*a0, 4*s + 1 |--> -1, -1 |--> 1, 2 |--> 1
    ]
```

    "body": "<a id='comment:20'>Comment 20:</a>\nThanks for the review! \n\nYour ticket for p-adic unit groups looks interesting & obviously it would be nice to unify it with the local-component code; but I doubt it would lead to much of a speed increase. In local-component computations, the computation time is overwhelmingly dominated by computing modular-symbol spaces and Hecke operators on them.

Thanks for the review! 

Your ticket for p-adic unit groups looks interesting & obviously it would be nice to unify it with the local-component code; but I doubt it would lead to much of a speed increase. In local-component computations, the computation time is overwhelmingly dominated by computing modular-symbol spaces and Hecke operators on them. The smoothchar.py stuff is just there to give a user-friendly way of interacting with the results of the modsym computation, it is computationally trivial in itself.
