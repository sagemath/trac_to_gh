1) Bug with respect to the symplectic groups:

```python
sage: Sp(4, QQ).invariant_form()
[0 0 0 1]
[0 0 1 0]
[0 1 0 0]
[1 0 0 0]
```

This bilinear form isn't alternating. Thus Sp(4, QQ) in fact is an orthogonal group!

2) Bug with respect to the unitary groups:

```python
sage: G = GU(2,2); G
General Unitary Group of degree 2 over Finite Field in a of size 2^2
sage: m = matrix(G.base_ring(), 2, 2, (1,1,1,0)); m
[1 1]
[1 0]
sage: m in [g.matrix() for g in G]
True
sage: G(m)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: matrix must be unitary
```

Note, that this bug is not fixed by ticket #25761. The reason for this bug is this:

```python
sage: invariant_form = matrix(G.base_ring(), 2,2, G.gap().InvariantSesquilinearForm()['matrix'].matrix())
sage: invariant_form == G.one().matrix()
False
```

Furthermore, There is no method to obtain the invariant from of a unitary group analogues as for symplectic and orthogonal groups.

```python
sage: GU(3,2).invariant_form()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'UnitaryMatrixGroup_gap_with_category' object has no attribute 'invariant_form'
```

3) Bug with respect to the orthogonal group (but not with respect to the invariant form):

```python
sage: GO3_25 = GO(3,25)
sage: GO3_25.order()
240
sage: GO3_5 = GO(3,5)
sage: GO3_5.order()
240
sage: GO3_5.is_isomorphic(GO3_25)
True
```


Furthermore, it should be possible to define generic classical matrix groups with respect to a user given invariant bilinear form.

Depends on #25761

Well, apparently -- according to the doc -- `Sp` is an orthogonal group:

> Return the quadratic form preserved by the orthogonal group.

However, to note that for finite fields, it does return the correct result (in part, but GAP does the computation). The generic implementation seems to have forgotten that it should be a skew-symmetric bilinear form. That should be simple to fix.

You seem to have come across a bigger issue for the last one

```
sage: [GO(3,2^k).cardinality() for k in range(1,5)]
[6, 6, 6, 6]
```
Contrast with

```
sage: ret = []
sage: X = GL(3,4)
sage: G = GO(3,4)
sage: it = iter(X)
sage: for _ in range(1000):
....:     x = next(it)
....:     try:
....:         ret.append(G(x)) # raises an error if not in G
....:     except TypeError:
....:         pass
....:     
sage: len(ret)
20
```
So the matrix group `GO(3,4)` is quite a bit bigger than `6`. I am pretty certain this comes from the groups having the same generators:

```
sage: GO(3,4).gens()
(
[1 0 0]  [1 0 0]
[1 1 1]  [0 0 1]
[0 0 1], [0 1 0]
)
sage: GO(3,2).gens()
(
[1 0 0]  [1 0 0]
[1 1 1]  [0 0 1]
[0 0 1], [0 1 0]
)
```
This is a bug with upstream GAP not creating the generators correctly.

IMO each of these issues should be a separate ticket.

Yep, I am now sure the issue is with the initializer. In `GO`:

```python
    if is_FiniteField(ring):
        cmd  = 'GO({0}, {1}, {2})'.format(e, degree, ring.characteristic())
        return OrthogonalMatrixGroup_gap(degree, ring, False, name, ltx, cmd)

versus, say `Sp`:

```python
        cmd  = 'Sp({0}, {1})'.format(degree, ring._gap_init_())
        return SymplecticMatrixGroup_gap(degree, ring, True, name, ltx, cmd)
```
I think the former should be in the same as the latter or `cardinality()`. With changing `characteristic` -> `cardinality`, I at least get something reasonable:

```
sage: GO(3,4).gens()
(
[    1     0     0]  [1 0 0]
[    0     a     0]  [1 1 1]
[    0     0 a + 1], [0 1 0]
)
sage: GO(3,4).cardinality()
60
sage: GO(3,8).cardinality()
504
```
The same change needs to be made for `SO`.

Thank your for these suggestions. I've already worked on the ticket but didn't push it up right after creating the ticket since I had build problems after merging with 8.4.beta0. What I do exactly coincides with your suggestions. In detail this is:

The three Bug-fixes I implement in

1) method `invariant_form` of `SymplecticMatrixGroup_generic`.

2) method `_check_matrix` of `UnitaryMatrixGroup_generic`.

3) new function `_OG` in `orthogonal.py`.

I add a new method `invariant_form` to the classes `UnitaryMatrixGroup_generic` and `UnitaryMatrixGroup_gap`.

Since the according method of `OrthogonalMatrixGroup_generic` was named `invarinat_bilinear_form` I add an alias for `invariant_form` there. Furthermore, I replace the (in the generic case) identical method `invariant_quadratic_form` by an alias, as well.

In order to implement an optional argument to define classical matrix groups with respect to a user given invariant bilinear form, I do the following:

I add the attribute `_user_invariant_form_` to the class `NamedMatrixGroup_generic` together with an optional argument `invariant_form` to set it (taking care of CachedRepresentation). Furthermore, I add the function `normalize_args_invariant_form` (analogous to `normalize_args_vectorspace`).


Than, I add the optional argument `invariant_form` to the functions `GO, SO, GU, SU` and `Sp` and transfer them to `NamedMatrixGroup_generic` after normalization. Since `GO` and `SO` (resp. `GU` and `SU`) use nearly identical code I capsule these in local functions `_OG` and `_UG` to avoid to much duplicated code.

The behavior with respect to the new argument I realize in the following way:

The argument is checked to define a non singular square-matrix over the given ring according to the given degree. Furthermore, the matrix is checked to by symmetric, hermitian or alternating according to the case of classical group. It is not checked to be positive definite in the case of orthogonal and unitary groups. But it will be printed in the representation string and latex string if it is not. Furthermore, the user given invariant bilinear form will always be printed in these representation strings.

Finally, I add the invariant bilinear form to the error message of the `_checke_matrix` method, but in the cases of orthogonal and unitary groups only if it is different from the identity matrix.

Well, this is a lot of stuff. If you think not all of this is necessary, please correct it!
