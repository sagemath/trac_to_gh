An initial implementation is in the commits. I ended up making the computation into an iterator returning the terms involving brackets of increasing lengths, so it is in theory possible to compute the BCH formula to arbitrary precision in any Lie algebra. I added a `BCH` method to `LieAlgebras.Nilpotent` to compute the full expression using this iterator. 

The iterator might be of independent interest for the computation of the (low order terms of the) abstract BCH formula in a free Lie algebra, however I did not know what would be the best way to expose it to the user.

One unfortunate part is that the computation time becomes quite unwieldy for the later terms. For example on my computer, computing the terms of increasing degree for the free Lie algebra on 2 generators took the following times:

```
10 : 45.4 ms
11 : 116 ms
12 : 327 ms
13 : 1.08 s
14 : 4.2 s
15 : 16.3 s
16 : 1min 8s
17 : 4min 59s
18 : 20min 52s
```
The only more efficient algorithm I know of is the one of Casas-Murua (https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2656). Based on their statement of requiring <15 mins for all terms of degree up to 20, I would guess that the efficiency improvement would be somewhere in the order of a 40x speed increase. For now, I think the simpler but less efficient approach is sufficient though.

Probably a good part of it might be a poor implementation of the Lie bracket for the free Lie algebra. At least it is taking on one iteration 14s/19s. Some caching, better implementation, and more Cythonization might help. At least, how it is currently designed is not very smart. For instance, it might be better to store the basis elements actually as lists that keeps track of the tree structure through some other list. There are definitely ways it can be improved (this is the first time that code is really being stress-tested for efficiency).

Anyways, I think this will work for now as we can always work on it more on a followup. Some comments on the code.

- I don't see the reason why the `bch_formula` should be a class. I think it would be better suited as just a generator function (i.e., using `yield` instead of `return`).
- Break the really long `.. MATH::` line. Also avoid using `\dots` and instead be more specific about what kind of dots (in this case, `\cdots`) (I don't really trust `\dots`).
- You should have an alias `baker_campbell_hausdorff = BCH`. Also, Sage convention is still method names are generally lower cases, even for acronyms/last-names (e.g., it is `pbw_basis`, not `PBW_basis`).
- Instead of just having a method for nilpotent Lie algebras, I think it would be good to have one that allows for a "precision" to be inputted. For instance
  {{{#!python
def bch(self, X, Y, prec=None):
    if self not in LieAlgebras.Nilpotent and prec is None:
        raise ValueError("the Lie algebra is not known to be nilpotent,"
                         " so you must specify the precision")
    from sage.algebras.lie_algebras.bch import BCH_iterator
    if prec is None:
        return self.sum(Z for Z in BCH_iterator(X, Y))
    bch = BCH_iterator(X, Y)
    return self.sum(next(bch) for k in range(prec))  # maybe prec+1?
}}}

We are all always learning. :)

Four last little things I missed on the first go-around (but this is it, promise):

- `(m - 1) / 2 + 1` -> `(m - 1) // 2 + 1` because on Python3, that will become a floating point and `range` does not like floating point limits (`//` is floor division).
- A faster way to create fractions in `QQ`:
  {{{
sage: %timeit QQ(1) / QQ(121)
The slowest run took 12.50 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.11 µs per loop
sage: %timeit QQ((1, 121))
The slowest run took 21.95 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 771 ns per loop
sage: %timeit ~QQ(121)
The slowest run took 27.61 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 440 ns per loop
  }}}
  Similarly for `coeff`.
- You can use the lower level `IntegerListsLex` to iterate over:
  {{{
sage: IV = IntegerVectorsConstraints(10 - 1, 2 * 3, min_part=1)
sage: ILL = IntegerListsLex(10-1, length=2*3, min_part=1)
sage: [list(x) for x in IV] == [list(x) for x in ILL]
True
  }}}
  `IntegerVectorsConstraints` is slower because it generates instances of `Element`, which have extra overhead from not being a builtin Python type.
- It is faster to use `X.bracket(Y)` instead of `L.bracket(X, Y)` as the latter calls the former. If you actually know the elements belong to the same parent, you can do `X._bracket_(Y)` and avoid some extra overhead checks, but that should be negligible.

The problem with that there is no way to test whether a Lie algebra is nilpotent or not in general (at least, as far as I know). For the finite-dimensional ones, we can compute the lower central series of course, but that is expensive. So IMO it is better to avoid the computation and to play it safe. However, that is a very weak position as I can see good reason to just do the check in that case. Your choice.

Not to my knowledge. You have to check both `x in ZZ or x == Infinity`.

At least with the current recursion algorithm, it is possible that all of the brackets `[X-Y,Z_{m-1}]` and `[Z_{k_1},...[Z_{k_{2p}}, X+Y]...]` computed in the recursion are zero for some `m`, but nonetheless higher order terms are non-zero. An example of this is given by quotienting a Lie algebra by the term of degree 3 of the BCH formula:

```
sage: L = LieAlgebra(QQ, 2, step=4)
sage: X, Y = L.homogeneous_component_basis(3)
sage: Q = L.quotient(X + Y)
sage: Q.inject_variables()
Defining X_1, X_2, X_12, X_112, X_1112
sage: Q.bch(X_1, X_2)
X_1 + X_2 + 1/2*X_12 - 1/24*X_1112
```
For third order terms, the `IntegerListsLex` part of the sum is only `[Z_1, [Z_1, Z_1]] = 0`, so `Z_3` will be just a multiple of `[X-Y,Z_2]`, which has been quotiented out. Yet there are non-zero terms of degree 4.

At this point I don't know what would be a possible alternative check to see if the formula terminates (other than testing for nilpotency of the Lie algebra generated by the two elements). So I would say to leave the improvements to a later ticket.

This will definitely work for now (and IIRC, it sufficient for your purposes). Thank you for looking into it (and that interesting example).
