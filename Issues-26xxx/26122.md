It would be nice to be able to have the labelings correspond more directly with either the elements themselves or with labellings found in papers.  I have added a ``labels`` option to ``birational_free_labelling`` that will either take a function that takes an element and returns an indeterminate, or a string that contains a comma separated list of indeterminates corresponding to the elements in the linear_extension.

"acomma" -> "a comma".

Need "::" and newline after "Illustrating labelling with a comma separated list of labels".

If the "labels" parameter is provided a list, how does it know which entry to use for which poset element? Is it the internal linear extension that decides it? (I haven't read the code.)

What about the global max and the global min?

Thanks, 

Yes, the labelling is according to the given (or default linear extension).  I'll fix the verbiage.

The global min and max are as they always were,  If you would like to propose a change to them, I'd be glad to implement it (I hardly ever use them).
