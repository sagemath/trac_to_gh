I am not sure this should return an error. We can use the `I.vector_space_dimension()` to compute the `cardinality()`, where `I` is the defining ideal. So it would be

```python
def cardinality(self):
    return self.base_ring().cardinality() ** self.defining_ideal().vector_space_dimension()
```

For non-fields, this is a harder question that we can raise a `NotImplementedError` for (which means either we catch the `TypeError` from the above or do some other kind of check).

What do you think about this? I can do the commit if you agree.

I also noticed the documentation for `vector_space_dimension()` is wrong: it does not raise an error for nonzero dimensional ideals.
