  ```diff

- I do not think you need the `lazy_import('sage.matrix.constructor', 'matrix')` in `sage/rings/function_field/valuation_ring.py`.

Otherwise it does what it says it does, so LGTM.

"place" is established terminology in the function field theory. Places correspond, one-to-one, to (discrete) valuation rings of the function field, which  defines valuation of the elements of the function field. In a later stage, I will introduce "divisors", which are central objects in the function field theory. A divisor is defined to be a formal sum of places.  A place is not said to be prime, though "finite" places are in one-to-one correspondence with prime ideals of the "finite" maximal order.

I forgot :-) I removed it.

Done. Thanks.

Right. Fixed.

Ok. Done. Thanks for a good tip.

I guess Guido did not remove `reduce` in python3 for no reason. I did a simple experiment (with ints) in python3 and both take the same time. I would prefer to remove `reduce`.

Removed.

Thank you for giving attention!!
