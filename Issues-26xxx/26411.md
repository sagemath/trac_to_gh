There is a limit for the length of a string to be evaluated in libgap. Hence, similar to what is done in the pexpect interfaces, `libgap.eval(cmd)` should evaluate `cmd` with a temporary file (using `libgap.ReadAsFunction(...)()`), if `cmd` is too long.

The problem arose when I tried to pickle (via string representation) the regular permutation action of `SuzukiGroup(8)`. It could be created as follows:

```
sage: G = libgap.SuzukiGroup(8)
sage: S = G.Elements()
sage: G2 = libgap.Group([libgap.PermList([S.Position(p*g) for p in S]) for g in G.GeneratorsOfGroup()])
sage: G2
<permutation group with 2 generators>
sage: s = G2.String().sage()
sage: len(s)
349083
sage: libgap.eval(s)
python2: libgap.c:184: libgap_get_input: Assertion `strlen(libGAP_stdin_buffer) < length' failed.

    436         if not isinstance(gap_command, basestring):
    437             gap_command = str(gap_command._gap_init_())

    322             sig_off()
    323         except RuntimeError as msg:

    325 
    326         if libGAP_Symbol != libGAP_S_SEMICOLON:

ValueError: libGAP: Aborted
sage: f = tmp_filename()
sage: F = file(f,'w')
sage: F.write("return "+ s + ';\n')
sage: F.flush()
sage: %time X = libgap.ReadAsFunction(f)()

```

It could of course be that in my applications I could use a much more efficient work-around (after all, I just need a string from which I can reconstruct the regular permutation action of `SuzukiGroup(8)`). But at least that example shows the problem.

By the way, instead of

```
sage: S = G.Elements()
sage: G2 = libgap.Group([libgap.PermList([S.Position(p*g) for p in S]) for g in G.GeneratorsOfGroup()])
```
you could just do

```
sage: G2 = G.Action(G,libgap.OnRight)
```

Is this ticket still relevant after the GAP-4.10 upgrade (#22626).

As I noted above, I really don't like the proposed solution here, but if there remains a problem, we should try to fix it (either in Sage or upstream).

It would be much better to spend time improving the libgap interface --- e.g. in this particular case, it seems that if Sage had direct in-memory access to GAP permutation data - it's possible to call the corresponding GAP kernel functions within libgap after all - the problem would not have arisen.
