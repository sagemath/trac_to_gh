The issue is explained by the following example:

```
sage: R.<t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: F = FractionField(R)
sage: R(F(1/t))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: fraction must have unit denominator
```
There is a natural conversion back to the Laurent polynomials. Most likely the denominator is not being checked if it is a unit in `R`.

The check for being a unit is performed in the section map of the natural inclusion of a ring into its ring of fractions. Thus, since this ring is not the Laurent polynomial ring itself but the corresponding polynomial ring, that test fails.

My attempt for a fix is to implement the conversion in the `_element_constructor` of the Laurent polynomial ring!

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

Note this:

```
sage: R.<t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: t.is_unit()
True
```
So, things SHOULD work, as the denominator of `1/t` is a unit. But:

```
sage: T = F(1/t)
sage: T.denominator().parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring
sage: R.fraction_field() is R.polynomial_ring().fraction_field()
True
```
Isn't that a bug? EDIT: No, because mathematically the two fraction fields are isomorphic.

Actually I recall that a couple of years ago I tried to let `FractionField(R)` be the `LaurentSeriesRing`, which mathematically is correct. EDIT: ... correct in the same way as the current fraction field is correct.

I think the following patch is not optimal:

```diff
+            P = x.parent()
+            if P.ring() == self.polynomial_ring():
+                d = self(x.denominator())
+                if not d.is_unit():
+                     raise TypeError("fraction must have unit denominator")
+                return self(x.numerator()) * d.inverse_of_unit()
```
I think we don't want to test that `P.ring() == self.polynomial_ring()`, but it is enough that `self.polynomial_ring().has_coerce_map_from(P.ring())`.

Or even better: We are talking about conversion here. So, there is no need to test whether the denominator coerces into `self`. We could just do

```diff
+        elif isinstance(x, FractionFieldElement):
+            # since the field of fraction of self is defined corresponding to the polynomial ring of self
+            # the conversion of its elements back must be treated separately (:trac:`26425`).
+            d = self(x.denominator())
+            if not d.is_unit():
+                 raise TypeError("fraction must have unit denominator")
+            return self(x.numerator()) * d.inverse_of_unit()
```
