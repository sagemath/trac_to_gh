The `nbextensions/jsmol` symlink points to `jmol` instead of `jsmol`:

Sorry, not sure what I was thinking when making it default to `JMOL_DIR`. #25309 really should've been split up into smaller changes for easier review.

Why wasn't this caught by the doctest framework? Don't we have any doctests testing the jsmol functionality?

And I had to split it in sage-on-gentoo, very similarly. Why did I think it was OK in vanilla sage.

That would require a way to run javascript code. At least, I added a test in this ticket that the script `JSmol.min.js` exists.
