The `nbextensions/jsmol` symlink points to `jmol` instead of `jsmol`:

Sorry, not sure what I was thinking when making it default to `JMOL_DIR`. #25309 really should've been split up into smaller changes for easier review.

Why wasn't this caught by the doctest framework? Don't we have any doctests testing the jsmol functionality?

That would require a way to run javascript code. At least, I added a test in this ticket that the script `JSmol.min.js` exists.
