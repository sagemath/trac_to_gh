Currently `MPolynomialRing_polydict` hardcodes `MPolynomial_polydict` as its element by calling it directly inside its `__call__` method (and also in its `monomial_quotient` method). This makes inheritance difficult.

The aim of this ticket is to replace this behaviour by defining `Element` and
using `element_class` to construct elements when needed. This patch is the
minimal set of changes needed to achieve it.

The old `__call__` method, now `_element_constructor_` could use some
refactoring, maybe in a different ticket, since the cases listed seems to be redundant. For example
(after this patch):

```
531         elif isinstance(x, dict):
532             K = self.base_ring()
533             return C(self, {i: K(a) for i, a in iteritems(x)})
...
584         if isinstance(x, dict):
585             return C(self, x)
```

It might be due to some change in the coercion framework. However, I am a little worried about the addition of `_coerce_map_from_` having changed some of the allowed coercions. Might be good to cc Jeroen since he has done some work on that. Independently, `_coerce_map_from_` needs doctests.

Also, it is better to do

```diff
             if x == 0:
-                return self(0)
+                return self.zero()
```
as it avoids recreating the zero element and going through the coercion framework.

I won't have much time the coming weeks to work on this. If you're going to push through with this, I would rather suggest to do it properly, meaning:

- think about which coercions should be allowed. Currently this is very ad hoc, there is no real theory. Clearly document which coercions between polynomial rings exist.
