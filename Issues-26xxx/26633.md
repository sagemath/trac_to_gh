Done here:
- add a warning in method `allow_multiple_edges` as it may compare edge labels of different types in Python 3.
- reduce the number of sorting in `multiple_edges`
- modify a doctest in method `kruskal` of `spanning_tree.pyx` that was impacted by changes in methods about multiple edges.
- various PEP8 cleaning
