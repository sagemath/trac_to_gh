As in #26162 and other tickets, removing `__eq__` does the job. Also:

- use `UniqueRepresentation` instead of `UniqueFactory` for constructing instances of `FreeMonoid`.
- clean up caching of subclasses: no need to do this by hand, since they will now inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`.

Without this change, there are Python 3 doctest failures in `sage/algebras/lie_algebras`, among other places. For example,

```
File "src/sage/algebras/lie_algebras/lie_algebra.py", line 1402, in sage.algebras.lie_algebras.lie_algebra.LiftMorphismToAssociative.preimage
Failed example:
    L = LieAlgebra(associative=R)
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx", line 1000, in sage.misc.cachefunc.CachedFunction.__call__ (build/cythonized/sage/misc/cachefunc.c:6175)

      File "sage/misc/weak_dict.pyx", line 706, in sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary.__getitem__ (build/cythonized/sage/misc/weak_dict.c:3538)
        cdef PyObject* wr = PyDict_GetItemWithError(self, k)

```

Part of #24551.

You can absorb this behavior into the `__classcall_private__`, but perhaps considering the documentation, it might be better to actually keep it separate. I don't have a particularly strong opinion either way.

Great, thank you. Small detail: the doc from `__classcall_private__` should almost entirely be moved into the class-level doc so it is visible under `FreeMonoid?` and in the html docs.

See the `_cache` module variable and `def BinaryStrings()` in `string_monoid.py`. So they are double-caching with your current changes.

<a id='comment:14'></a>The docstrings still will not show in the `?` and html doc if they are in the `__init__` because there is already a class-level doc. I would rather have it in the class-level doc so we can use the `__init__` to discuss implementation details. You also should be able to just call the `index_set` as `n` in the `__init__`.

I am okay with leaving the alias for now, but it should really be uniformized at some point. Yet, I've already asked quite a lot from you on this ticket.
