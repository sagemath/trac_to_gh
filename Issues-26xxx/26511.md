The purpose of this ticket is to 
- connect SageMath to interfaces to optimization solvers that are maintained outside of the Sage project,
- integrate the related developer and user communities,
- provide an entry point for [GSoC 2022 projects](https://wiki.sagemath.org/GSoC/2022)

## [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) status quo: Front end
- Frontend class [MixedIntegerLinearProgram](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/numerical/sage/numerical/mip.html#sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram)
    - mutable (can call `add_constraint`, `set_integer`, `new_variable` etc. and then re-solve)
    - solver-independent and solver-specific parameters (`solver_parameter`)
    - widely used in Sage library code for `sage.graphs`, `sage.coding`, `sage.combinat`, ...
    - [MIPVariable](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/numerical/sage/numerical/mip.html#sage.numerical.mip.MIPVariable) - indexed by arbitrary objects
    - some connections to [Polyhedron](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/discrete_geometry/index.html#polyhedral-computations) class and to [InteractiveLPProblem](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/numerical/sage/numerical/interactive_simplex_method.html) (didactical code)

## [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) status quo: Back ends

- [In-tree backends](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/tree/develop/src/sage/numerical/backends), using Cython, with varying degrees of implementation quality
    - GLPK backend - complete, includes support for tableau data and GLPK's exact rational mode
    - InteractiveLP backend - basic, provide LP only for algebraic LPs
    - CVXOPT backend
    - PPL backend - exact solver
- Separate distribution packages for optional packages (proprietary solvers, open-source solvers with incompatible licenses)
    - https://github.com/sagemath/sage-numerical-backends-coin: COIN backend (CBC) - very basic, no support for setting solver parameters such as time limit
    - https://github.com/sagemath/sage-numerical-backends-cplex: CPLEX backend
    - https://github.com/sagemath/sage-numerical-backends-gurobi: Gurobi backend
- Optimization interface is maintained by a very small part of the Sage developer community

## [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) tickets and tasks

- #28175 Move sage optimization backends to separate Cython packages to remove `OptionalExtension` problems
- Template for minimal Python-based backends (`interactivelp_backend.pyx` is implemented in Cython just because a Cython template was available)
- Replace basic Cython-based COIN backend by full-featured PuLP backend (gives access to many solvers)
- #19219 MILP: Add CyLP backend -- Replace basic Cython-based COIN backend by full-featured cylp backend (gives detailed access to CLP, including tableau data)
- PuLP backend implementation using Sage backends... to make exact backends such as InteractiveLP, PPL backend available to PuLP frontend users 
   - can PuLP handle non-floating point data (for example for exact computation over rationals or number fields if the backend allows it?
   - this could be added to PuLP, rather than to Sage.
- Pyomo backend implementation using Sage backends... to make exact backends available to Pyomo frontend users 
  - see above
- Check feasibility of replacing front end `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` by PuLP frontend or Pyomo frontend
   - can PuLP handle Sage's number types such as RDF and ZZ?
   - can Pyomo handle Sage's number types such as RDF and ZZ?

## Key Python software (solver-independent)

Selection criteria for solver-independent interfaces:
- Does it use a compatible, permissive, open source license?
- Does it provide detailed access to the solver that allows for updating problems and warmstarting?
- Is it under active development?


**cvxpy** - Meta-ticket #33920
- permissive open source license: Apache 2.0

- https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/issues/1704: Link to `MathOptInterface.jl`
- as of 2022 under active development; maintainers appear to respond quickly to issues/PRs: [cvxpy/cvxpy#1705](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/pull/1705), [cvxpy/cvxpy#1707](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/pull/1707), [cvxpy/cvxpy#1719](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/pull/1719)

- Installation with `sage -pip install pulp` works
- Frontend: a basic modeling system 
   - example: https://github.com/coin-or/pulp/blob/master/examples/WhiskasModel1.py
   - need to compare its capabilities with the sage frontend
  - Backends: some API-based and some file-based interfaces to various solvers, including:
   - COIN_CMD (COIN CBC via command line), 
   - COINMP_DLL (CBC via COINMP C library API), 
   - YAPOSIB (Python interface to COIN OSI, see below), 
   - see [solvers.py](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp/blob/master/src/pulp/solvers.py)
  - **PuLP is currently looking for a co-maintainer** (https://github.com/coin-or/pulp/issues/183)

- some file-based, some API-based interfaces (direct/persistent) - see [solvers directory](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo/tree/master/pyomo/solvers/plugins/solvers)
- big system, under active development

**YAPOSIB** - Python interface to COIN OSI, using Boost::Python
- https://github.com/coin-or/yaposib
- Installation with `sage -i boost && sage -pip install yaposib` works
- **incompatible open source license** - EPL 1.0
- therefore we cannot use it as the basis for our solver-independent code
- could still be useful to be used via PuLP for solvers that don't have a direct PuLP backend

**Python MIP (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming) Tools** (new 2018)
- https://pypi.org/project/mip/

- permissive open source license: Apache 2.0
- quick with "wontfix" - [google/or-tools#3205](https://github.com/google/or-tools/issues/3205)

**COIN-OR OSI**
- **incompatible copyleft license**: Eclipse Public License 2.0


## Key Python software (solver-dependent)

The Python interfaces that target only one solver are usually careful in not having more restrictive licenses than the targeted solver.

**scipy.optimize** (vendors HiGHS)
- Permissive open source licenses: SciPy: BSD 3-clause; HiGHS: MIT license
- #32282 Add LP solver backends for HiGHS via scipy.optimize.linprog

**highspy** (pybind11-based interface to HiGHS)
- #33919 Add MILP solver backends for HiGHS via highspy

Interfaces to **GLPK**
- it looks like ​https://github.com/biosustain/swiglpk/releases is the best maintained. Excluding sage and cvxopt.
- see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLPK/Python for a list of other glpk bindings

**cylp**
- #33487: CyLP is a Python interface to COIN-OR’s Linear and mixed-integer program solvers (CLP, CBC, and CGL). CyLP’s unique feature is that you can use it to alter the solution process of the solvers from within Python. For example, you may define cut generators, branch-and-bound strategies, and primal/dual Simplex pivot rules completely in Python.
- same license as CBC/CLP/CGL
- as of Mar 2022: [many open issues](https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP/issues), minimal maintenance mode by 1 maintainer who is cooperative on receiving PRs: [coin-or/CyLP#153](https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP/pull/153), [coin-or/CyLP#155](https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP/pull/155), [coin-or/CyLP#156](https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP/pull/156), [coin-or/CyLP#157](https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP/pull/157)

**cbcpy** (LGPL; new August 2019 according to ​https://pypi.org/project/cbcpy/; no activity since then) 
- upstream devs for cbc have published their own python interface ​https://gitlab.com/ikus-soft/cbcpy
- the fact that it uses swig may be an obstacle for immediate inclusion


**Gurobi**, **CPLEX**
- they come with their own standard Python APIs, which we could use instead of building our own cython interface 
- related: #28175 - where we remove these cython modules from sagelib and ship them in separate packages instead

**python-qsoptex**
- https://github.com/jonls/python-qsoptex (see #18766)

**SCIP, PySCIPOpt** (now open source)

+The purpose of this ticket is to 
+- connect [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) to interfaces to optimization solvers that are maintained outside of the Sage project,
+- integrate the related developer and user communities.
 
-It has 
-- some API-based and some file-based interfaces to various solvers (including COIN OSI via yaposib),
-- a basic modeling system (need to compare its capabilities with sage frontend)
+**Status quo in Sage:**
+- Frontend class MixedIntegerLinearProgram
+    - mutable (can call add_constraint, set_integer, new_variable etc. and then re-solve)
+    - solver-independent and solver-specific parameters (solver_parameter)
+    - widely used in Sage code
+    - MIPVariable - indexed by arbitrary objects
+    - some connections to Polyhedron class and to InteractiveLPProblem (didactical code)
+- Backends, using Cython, with varying degrees of implementation quality
+    - GLPK backend - complete, includes support for tableau data and GLPK's exact rational mode
+    - COIN backend - very basic, no support for setting solver parameters such as time limit
+    - CPLEX backend, Gurobi backend, CVXOPT backend, PPL backend
+    - InteractiveLP backend - basic, provide LP only for algebraic LPs
+- Very small developer community
 
-https://github.com/coin-or/yaposib
+**Tickets:**
 
+- Template for minimal Python-based backends (interactivelp_backend.pyx is implemented in Cython just because a Cython template was available)
+- Replace basic Cython-based COIN backend by full-featured PuLP backend (gives access to many solvers)
+- #19219 MILP: Add CyLP backend -- Replace basic Cython-based COIN backend by full-featured cylp backend (gives detailed access to CLP, including tableau data)
+- PuLP backend implementation using Sage backends... to make exact backends such as InteractiveLP, PPL backend available to PuLP frontend users 
+   - can PuLP handle non-floating point data (for example for exact computation over rationals or number fields if the backend allows it?
+   - this could be added to PuLP, rather than to Sage.
+- Pyomo backend implementation using Sage backends... to make exact backends available to Pyomo frontend users 
+  - see above
+- Check feasibility of replacing front end MixedIntegerLinearProgram by PuLP frontend or Pyomo frontend
+   - can PuLP handle Sage's number types such as RDF and ZZ?
+   - can Pyomo handle Sage's number types such as RDF and ZZ?

> Yes, when it uses Cbc, it calls a shared library that is under the EPL, but since python-mip itself is also under the EPL, this doesn't create any issue. 

Yes, there is no new problem of using `python-mip` as an interface to Cbc when one is already using Cbc. 

However, as I wrote in our earlier discussion (with Haroldo and Túlio) in July 2021:

  For Sage, I am shopping for an API offering pivot-level control over solvers that can support several backends, with the goal of replacing our home-grown (wasn't me) design. Given that Python-MIP already supports CBC and Gurobi, it is a viable candidate for this; if it weren't for the license situation [...]

There are many subtleties around this interpretation. For one, does this mean that you can't actually grab part of a package and utilize it in another package in source form, since the partial package would not be in the \"preferred form for modification\"? This seems to be done quite commonly. If not, what actually defines what constitutes the \"full package\"? What about a case like COIN-OR, where you can't work with the build system of any of the main source package without what is clearly another completely separate package that aids in the production of the build harness (in this case, the BuildTools)? What if the original authors don't actually provide a build harness, but just distribute the source itself? What if the project does have a `setup.py`, but can be run without it, by just directly importing it, not installing it in site-packages? Wouldn't this then be the most convenient way of working with the code? In the C/C++ world, what if the source is provided, but without a Makefile or a CMake setup? Or what if both setups are maintained for a given project, but only one is distributed and it's not the one I would personally prefer? Who's to say what the \"preferred\" way of working with source is, given that this is subjective. This is a crazy mess. To me, it seems clear that the only distinction one can make very clearly is that \"source\" is human-readable and \"object code\" is not.\n\nPutting all that aside, a Python wheel certainly can include things like `setup.py` if desired and those things would then be installed. Doing that would certainly seem to satisfy license requirements. There's nothing stopping you from including the entire contents of a given project's repo in its wheel, it's just not usually done that way.\n\nThere are many other aspects of the GPL that are up to interpretation and with respect to which it is anyone's guess what is really allowed. If you look at the parts of the license itself (and not the FAQ) that discuss linking, it only references linking to libraries that are \"required.\" The word \"required\" seems to be intentionally chosen there. It looks as though if you distribute an optional component along with the whole work, that optional component doesn't itself need to be under the GPL. This makes sense---an optional plug-in cannot really be interpreted as part of a whole that is a derived work of the original. The argument about the enforceability of \"linking\" rests on the idea that the combination of the two things linked together creates something new that would be considered a derived work. Since python-mip is itself a free-standing program that works without Sage and Sage is a free-standing program that works without python-mip, this really doesn't look like \"linking\" in that sense. The only place that \"linking\" is really defined in the license itself, it is specifically mentioned that the linking is to \"shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms,\" which is clearly referring to code in assembly code form, not a human-readable source form. \n\nOf course, this is all opinion, but it seems clear there is enough grey to cast doubt on almost any one fixed interpretation. Even if you take the conservative view that importing a module in Python *is* \"linking,\" it would seem easy to get around this by invoking the module as a free-standing program, writing out the data to a file and then reading it back in using a separate interpreter with its own memory. Since we agree that passing data through a file rather than through memory is a legitimate way to keep the programs as separate (ala how PuLP communicates with Cbc), this is a fine workaround. \n\nBut then this opens up a whole new subtle distinction between the RAM and the disk. Is the disk not part of the computer's \"memory\"? It seems like it is, since when a program pages, it is using the disk as virtual memory. What then is considered communicating through \"memory\"? What about RAM on another processor or attached to another core? Is that \"memory\"? Where do we draw the line? It's almost impossible to clearly define exactly what the GPL requires in today's complex computing environments. The FSF is splitting hairs in its interpretation. It's hard to believe that they are truly trying to respect a user's \"freedom\" with all this. It looks to me like they are trying to forcibly impose an extreme world view on everyone else, thereby taking away freedom, to the detriment of the open source movement. \n\nWith all that said, the most important point at the end of the day is that using python-mip in the way you were hoping to use it *does not violate the EPL*. It only (possibly) violates the *GPL*. I guess the Sage foundation is the copyright holder on the GPL'd code and so could carve out an exception to the linking requirement for specific purposes. This is effectively what the secondary clause of the EPL also does. Since it is the GPL, not the EPL, that is creating the problem, why not just address it on the GPL side. Why not use the LGPL?\n\n> More importantly, as an author of GPL-protected Python software myself, I would certainly not want this interpretation to be used when a vendor of proprietary software wanted to build their product on top of my software.\n\nHow does the linking provision provide protection? It just means that no one can build on top of your software with non-GPL'd code, not that they can't do it at all. Lots of commercial products are built on GPL'd code. The protection the GPL affords you is that if someone modifies your code, they have to make the modifications open source and they can't hide from users the fact that their project is built on yours. But they can still build a commercial product around it and charge money for it.",

What about a case like COIN-OR, where you can't work with the build system of any of the main source package without what is clearly another completely separate package that aids in the production of the build harness (in this case, the BuildTools)? What if the original authors don't actually provide a build harness, but just distribute the source itself? What if the project does have a `setup.py`, but can be run without it, by just directly importing it, not installing it in site-packages? Wouldn't this then be the most convenient way of working with the code? In the C/C++ world, what if the source is provided, but without a Makefile or a CMake setup? Or what if both setups are maintained for a given project, but only one is distributed and it's not the one I would personally prefer? Who's to say what the "preferred" way of working with source is, given that this is subjective. This is a crazy mess. To me, it seems clear that the only distinction one can make very clearly is that "source" is human-readable and "object code" is not.

Putting all that aside, a Python wheel certainly can include things like `setup.py` if desired and those things would then be installed. Doing that would certainly seem to satisfy license requirements. There's nothing stopping you from including the entire contents of a given project's repo in its wheel, it's just not usually done that way.

There are many other aspects of the GPL that are up to interpretation and with respect to which it is anyone's guess what is really allowed. If you look at the parts of the license itself (and not the FAQ) that discuss linking, it only references linking to libraries that are "required." The word "required" seems to be intentionally chosen there. It looks as though if you distribute an optional component along with the whole work, that optional component doesn't itself need to be under the GPL. This makes sense---an optional plug-in cannot really be interpreted as part of a whole that is a derived work of the original. The argument about the enforceability of "linking" rests on the idea that the combination of the two things linked together creates something new that would be considered a derived work. Since python-mip is itself a free-standing program that works without Sage and Sage is a free-standing program that works without python-mip, this really doesn't look like "linking" in that sense. The only place that "linking" is really defined in the license itself, it is specifically mentioned that the linking is to "shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms," which is clearly referring to code in assembly code form, not a human-readable source form. 

Of course, this is all opinion, but it seems clear there is enough grey to cast doubt on almost any one fixed interpretation. Even if you take the conservative view that importing a module in Python *is* "linking," it would seem easy to get around this by invoking the module as a free-standing program, writing out the data to a file and then reading it back in using a separate interpreter with its own memory. Since we agree that passing data through a file rather than through memory is a legitimate way to keep the programs as separate (ala how PuLP communicates with Cbc), this is a fine workaround. 

But then this opens up a whole new subtle distinction between the RAM and the disk. Is the disk not part of the computer's "memory"? It seems like it is, since when a program pages, it is using the disk as virtual memory. What then is considered communicating through "memory"? What about RAM on another processor or attached to another core? Is that "memory"? Where do we draw the line? It's almost impossible to clearly define exactly what the GPL requires in today's complex computing environments. The FSF is splitting hairs in its interpretation. It's hard to believe that they are truly trying to respect a user's "freedom" with all this. It looks to me like they are trying to forcibly impose an extreme world view on everyone else, thereby taking away freedom, to the detriment of the open source movement. 

With all that said, the most important point at the end of the day is that using python-mip in the way you were hoping to use it *does not violate the EPL*. It only (possibly) violates the *GPL*. I guess the Sage foundation is the copyright holder on the GPL'd code and so could carve out an exception to the linking requirement for specific purposes. This is effectively what the secondary clause of the EPL also does. Since it is the GPL, not the EPL, that is creating the problem, why not just address it on the GPL side. Why not use the LGPL?

> More importantly, as an author of GPL-protected Python software myself, I would certainly not want this interpretation to be used when a vendor of proprietary software wanted to build their product on top of my software.

How does the linking provision provide protection? It just means that no one can build on top of your software with non-GPL'd code, not that they can't do it at all. Lots of commercial products are built on GPL'd code. The protection the GPL affords you is that if someone modifies your code, they have to make the modifications open source and they can't hide from users the fact that their project is built on yours. But they can still build a commercial product around it and charge money for it.

Sorry, Ted, this is all just wildly misguided. 

The authors of software choose GPL as the license because they agree with the widely understood intended interpretation, in particular the strong protections that the GPL intends to provide. 

Whether the implementation by the license text holds up legally, is a secondary matter; the license is, so to say, merely an implementation detail. 

What matters for the open source / free software community is to respect the intent of the authors, as expressed by their choice of license. Saying that their choices are somehow not legitimate because the license is not legally enforceable, or to discuss circumvention techniques based on narrow interpretations of what linking is, all seems pretty out of place.

But COIN-OR's embrace of `python-mip` **has** prompted the license change. 

The old license was a standard permissive license that was compatible with everything: with EPL, with GPL, anything.

> Most have chosen the EPL, following IBM's original lead. Of course, this is partly because it is just easier in terms of license compatibility

Yeah, no. This is the core of the damaging misinformation that is coming from the direction of COIN-OR.

No such thing, it is just specifically incompatible with EPL (without secondary license notice), for a specific technical reason. 

GPL is compatible with a wide range of licenses, in particular all the standard permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache, ...).
