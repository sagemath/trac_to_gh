The lazy imports used for `CoercionException` cause some problems with Python 3. I think they are not necessary: instead of lazily importing from `sage.structure.parent`, we can import directly from `sage.structure.coerce_exceptions`, which should be pretty fast (that file contains almost nothing).

This fixes several Python 3 doctest issues, such as the one in the ticket description for #25927.

The change to pushout was also done in #26211, but I have asked for that part to be reverted in favor of this ticket.
