`src/sage/matroids/basis_matroid.pyx` has `_is_relaxation()` with `bitset_init` for `bb_comp` and `b2`, but no corresponding `bitset_free`. Try this:

```
from sage.matroids.advanced import *
import gc

i = 0
while True:
    if i%5000==0:
        gc.collect() 
        print get_memory_usage()
    i += 1
    M = BasisMatroid(matroids.named_matroids.NonFano())
    N = BasisMatroid(matroids.named_matroids.Fano())
    m = {e:e for e in M.groundset()}
    tm=M._is_relaxation(N, m)
    tn=N._is_relaxation(M, m)
```
