Two comments:\n\n1) You can't rigorously decide equality in Q(e,pi) because you don't know if Q(e)(pi) is a transcendental extension of Q(e). If this extension is not transcendental, it would mean that in my implementation checking when calling x<y for x,y in Q(e,pi) could enter an infinite loop (in the case where x=y but are represented differently as rational functions in e and pi), but when a result is returned to x<y, then that answer would be rigorous. So, there might still be some point in supporting Q(e,pi)...\n\n2) Defining Q(r) where r is a random number in (say) [0, 1] would be important to me.

Hi Pat,

You should not be creating `NestedIntervalRealSet` but use `RealLazyField`. The latter is far from being perfect, but it is exactly inteded for this purpose.

Hi Vincent,

Thank you. Sure, I'll try to switch to RealLazyField. I hadn't realized that you could get intervals from RLF.

The other thing I use is FunctionField. One issue I was having was that it seems not to cancel constants in the numerator and denominator:

```
sage: K.<x>=FunctionField(QQ)
sage: y = (2*x)/(2*(x+1)); y
2*x/(2*x + 2)
sage: y^2
4*x^2/(4*x^2 + 8*x + 4)
```
These constants build up when performing the kind of repeated operations I was doing and slow things down a lot. I deal with this by calling ".factor().expand()" on FunctionField elements at every step, but this also seems slow and I'm not sure if it will work in all fields...

<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

This will not solve your simplification problem but I wonder why these two are different

```
sage: QQ['t'].fraction_field()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
sage: FunctionField(QQ, 't')
Rational function field in t over Rational Field
```
It seems that the second is just a wrapper over the first one

```
sage: K = FunctionField(QQ, 't')
sage: t = K.gen()
sage: parent(t._x) is QQ['t'].fraction_field()
True
sage: 
```

Concerning simplification in fraction field, this is a non-trivial matter and you may want to have a look at

- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/Pzkkfjhj3XI

If you really want to work with a transcendental extension of QQ then better work with `ZZ['x'].fraction_field()` that apparently works better with simplification.

I switched to `RealLazyField`. I also created a class (and parent) which represents a lazily computed random number in [0,1] (and created a `random_real` convenience function).

I did not address the simplifications problem. I'd like to work in the general case at first. Once people are happy with the general case, I think it will be worth doing some optimization when the base is `QQ` and perhaps also for number fields.

Hi Pat,

Some random thoughts

1. It does not make much sense to generate the bits by packets of 53. I know that 53 is the standard mantissa for double floating point, but in the present situation it would be more natural to use 64 bits. (idem in `_mpfr_` or `_richcmp_`)

2. I don't think that the following is necessary in `_coerce_map_from_`

```
+        if S == self:
+            return True
```

3. Why not make the `LazyRandomElement` an actual element of the real lazy field `RLF`? It would be better than having the ad-hoc `LazyRandomNumberSet_class`.

Hi Vincent,

3. I originally wanted to do this, but I ran into trouble with categories. I made changes in this direction, but I'm still having the issue. Namely `RLF.random()._test_category()` gives an error. It would be great if you could fix or tell me how to fix it.

1. In `LazyRandomNumber` I decided to store representations of `RealIntervalField`s with precision `64*2^k` for `k=0,1,2,...`. Previously, I was doing `53*k`. The new use of exponential growth here means that the memory requirements to get a random number of large precision drop from quadratic to linear (and presumably some algorithm times drop as well).

2. Fixed in second commit above.

4. I noticed a bug in `RealLazyField`: 

```
sage: float(sin(RLF.pi()))
AttributeError: type object 'float' has no attribute 'pi'
```
The same error appears with `RDF` replacing `float`.

I'm thinking we solve issue 3 above, then maybe it makes sense to make `RealTranscendentalExtensionField` support underlying functions fields such as `ZZ['x'].fraction_field()`. I wanted to see that people are happy with this scheme before I put more work in.

It is indeed a bug. A new ticket should be open to fix the issue. Note that curiously the following does work

```
sage: (sin(RLF.pi())).eval(RDF)
