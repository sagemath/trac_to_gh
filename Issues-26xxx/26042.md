QQ[e, pi], or similar extensions.

    "body": "<a id='comment:3'></a>\nThanks Samuel for posting this. Two comments:\n\n1) You can't rigorously decide equality in Q(e,pi) because you don't know if Q(e)(pi) is a transcendental extension of Q(e). If this extension is not transcendental, it would mean that in my implementation checking when calling x<y for x,y in Q(e,pi) could enter an infinite loop (in the case where x=y but are represented differently as rational functions in e and pi), but when a result is returned to x<y, then that answer would be rigorous. So, there might still be some point in supporting Q(e,pi)...\n\n2) Defining Q(r) where r is a random number in (say) [0, 1] would be important to me.

Hi Pat,

You should not be creating `NestedIntervalRealSet` but use `RealLazyField`. The latter is far from being perfect, but it is exactly inteded for this purpose.

```

sage: my_pi = RLF.pi()
sage: my_pi.numerical_approx(digits=50)

sage: RealIntervalField(100)(my_pi)

Hi Vincent,

Thank you. Sure, I'll try to switch to RealLazyField. I hadn't realized that you could get intervals from RLF.

The other thing I use is FunctionField. One issue I was having was that it seems not to cancel constants in the numerator and denominator:

```
sage: K.<x>=FunctionField(QQ)
sage: y = (2*x)/(2*(x+1)); y
2*x/(2*x + 2)
sage: y^2
4*x^2/(4*x^2 + 8*x + 4)
```
These constants build up when performing the kind of repeated operations I was doing and slow things down a lot. I deal with this by calling ".factor().expand()" on FunctionField elements at every step, but this also seems slow and I'm not sure if it will work in all fields...

This will not solve your simplification problem but I wonder why these two are different

```
sage: QQ['t'].fraction_field()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
sage: FunctionField(QQ, 't')
Rational function field in t over Rational Field
```
It seems that the second is just a wrapper over the first one

```
sage: K = FunctionField(QQ, 't')
sage: t = K.gen()
sage: parent(t._x) is QQ['t'].fraction_field()
True
sage: 
```

Concerning simplification in fraction field, this is a non-trivial matter and you may want to have a look at

- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/vaHMDSt1bgs
- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/Pzkkfjhj3XI

If you really want to work with a transcendental extension of QQ then better work with `ZZ['x'].fraction_field()` that apparently works better with simplification.

Hi Pat,

Some random thoughts

1. It does not make much sense to generate the bits by packets of 53. I know that 53 is the standard mantissa for double floating point, but in the present situation it would be more natural to use 64 bits. (idem in `_mpfr_` or `_richcmp_`)

2. I don't think that the following is necessary in `_coerce_map_from_`

```
+        if S == self:
+            return True
```

3. Why not make the `LazyRandomElement` an actual element of the real lazy field `RLF`? It would be better than having the ad-hoc `LazyRandomNumberSet_class`.

Hi Vincent,

3. I originally wanted to do this, but I ran into trouble with categories. I made changes in this direction, but I'm still having the issue. Namely `RLF.random()._test_category()` gives an error. It would be great if you could fix or tell me how to fix it.

1. In `LazyRandomNumber` I decided to store representations of `RealIntervalField`s with precision `64*2^k` for `k=0,1,2,...`. Previously, I was doing `53*k`. The new use of exponential growth here means that the memory requirements to get a random number of large precision drop from quadratic to linear (and presumably some algorithm times drop as well).

2. Fixed in second commit above.

4. I noticed a bug in `RealLazyField`: 

```
sage: float(sin(RLF.pi()))
AttributeError: type object 'float' has no attribute 'pi'
```
The same error appears with `RDF` replacing `float`.

I'm thinking we solve issue 3 above, then maybe it makes sense to make `RealTranscendentalExtensionField` support underlying functions fields such as `ZZ['x'].fraction_field()`. I wanted to see that people are happy with this scheme before I put more work in.

It is indeed a bug. A new ticket should be open to fix the issue. Note that curiously the following does work

```
sage: (sin(RLF.pi())).eval(RDF)

The issues mentioned in the discussion above all seem resolved now. All tests are passing for me in both python2 and python3 now. Also the cancellation issue mentioned in comment 7 seems to have been resolved by changes in `FunctionField`.

Changed to "needs review".

This is a nice feature!

Unfortunately, most functions miss a test and/or example block.

See [here](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content) for details.
