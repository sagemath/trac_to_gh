Define the lognormal density starting from the normal:

```
var("mu", domain="real")
var("y, m, s, sigma", domain="positive")
dnorm(x, mu, sigma) = e^(-(x-mu)^2/(2*sigma^2))/(sigma*sqrt(2*pi))
dlnorm(y, mu, sigma) = (dnorm(x, mu, sigma).subs(x==log(y))*abs(diff(log(y),y))).simplify()
```

Let's try to prove that the limit is 0 at 0 and oo:

```
sage: dlnorm(y, mu, sigma).limit(y=oo)
0
```

So far so good. But:

```
dlnorm(y, mu, sigma).limit(y=0, dir="+")
;;;
;;; Detected access to protected memory, also kwown as 'bus or segmentation fault'.
;;; Jumping to the outermost toplevel prompt
;;;

## Numerous repetitions...

Process Sage erreur de segmentation
```

This seems analogous to but different from #14677...

This limit also seems problematic in other subsystems:

* Sympy returns "Not implemented"
* libgiac returns "Infinity" (wrong)
* Mathematica doesn't return (but (correctly) returns 0 when used directly).
* Used directly, Maxima asks a lot of questions, and fails:

```
limit(dlnorm(y, mu, sigma), y, 0);
Is sigma^2-mu positive, negative or zero?

p;
Is mu positive, negative or zero?

p;
Is 2*sigma^2-mu positive, negative or zero?

p;
(%o10) ('limit(%e^-((log(y)-mu)^2/(2*sigma^2))/y,y,0))/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(%pi)
                                                               *sigma)
```

This failure mode is different from the one seen in Sage; we may have a *new* bug...

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

It looks to me like a `domain:complex` error again. I get:

```
sage: maxima_calculus.eval("domain:real")
'real'
sage: dlnorm(y,mu,sigma).limit(y=0, dir="+")
0
```
That's to say, if we set domain to real, maxima in sage seems to do the right thing immediately. So I think it's basically the same problem as #14677.
