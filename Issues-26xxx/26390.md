<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
Ok.

I am also surprised by a doctests behaviour.

When i see this

```
sage: sage_input(long(-5), verify=True)  # py2
# Verified
-long(5)
sage: sage_input(long(-7), preparse=False, verify=True)
# Verified
-7L
sage: sage_input(long(11), preparse=None, verify=True)  # py2
# Verified
long(11)

```


i expect the second test to fail in python3 but it doesn't whith a `sage -t --long src/sage/misc/sage_input.py`, what is the trick ?

> i expect the second test to fail in python3 but it doesn't whith a `sage -t --long src/sage/misc/sage_input.py`, what is the trick ?

There are some tricks in the doctest parser for massaging differences between Python 2 and 3 w.r.t. to the Python 2 long type.  For example, the `L`-suffix is just ignored on Python 3 as long as the preceding numerals are the same. 

But I don't think the Sage pre-parser will take `long(1)` and output `long(1)` on Python 3.  So there are a few exceptions.  But the *majority* of long-related tests work on Python 3.
