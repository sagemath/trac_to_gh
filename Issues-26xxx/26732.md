In the latest beta, 8.5.beta4, the docker images that we build automatically failed its self tests because it could not spawn the jupyter notebook anymore:

Apparently one of the parameters of jupyter has changed with one of the recent upgrades, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52706238/jupyter-throwing-error-socket-gaierror-errno-2-name-or-service-not-known.

Now test-jupyter passed, but test-dev failed with:

```
configure: error: "/home/sage/sage/build/pkgs/cephes/type" is missing.
If you would like to try to build Sage anyway (to help porting),
export the variable 'SAGE_PORT' to something non-empty.
Makefile:39: recipe for target 'build/make/Makefile' failed
make[1]: *** [build/make/Makefile] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/sage/sage'

make: *** [base-toolchain] Error 2

```

I have no idea what that's about.  It doesn't make any sense.  I *think* the cephes package may have been removed so something is going on here where removed SPKGs are not handled well on incremental builds...?

Right, cephes was removed 3ec2d4a2bfb28b8466dba010ab0e18fb6dfc7ef0 but the incremental build can not handle removing SPKGs it seems.

That's odd, because all it does is call `make build`. What would be searching for a removed SPKG? Let's discuss this in a follow up ticket: #26753.
