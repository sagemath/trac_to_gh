As a result of refactoring configure.ac in #24919,
absence of (g)fortran now forces installation of full gcc, instead of just gfortran part of it.

This is particularly crucial on OSX, where we don't normally build full gcc any more, but only build gfortran.

To reproduce, move gfortran out of your PATH, and re-run ./configure. You'll see that now `gcc` and `gfortran` are scheduled for installation...

It doesn't but the the section of code you point too in the diff can only be reached if `sage_spkg_install_gcc` is no. Otherwise the variable I was worried about is set to no.

The only real issue to be careful here is that the gcc bit needs to be run before the gfortran bit. If we go by lexical order everything is fine in this particular case. But that may be something to remember if there is ever another package with an "optional split" or a where checking a dependency first is important.

I think having some kind of notice was the intent, though written exactly as I did was probably a mistake on my part.  Looking at the diff from #24919, this is the original code I removed from `configure.ac`:

```diff
-# Check that the Fortran compiler accepts free-format source code
-# (as opposed to the older fixed-format style from Fortran 77).
-# This helps verify the compiler works too, so if some idiot
-# sets FC to /usr/bin/ls, we will at least know it's
-# not a working Fortran compiler.
-AC_LANG(Fortran)
-if test -z "$FC"; then
-    need_to_install_gfortran=yes
-else
```

and this is the equivalent code that was moved to `build/pkgs/gfortran/spkg-configure.m4`:

```diff
+        # Check that the Fortran compiler accepts free-format source code (as
+        # opposed to the older fixed-format style from Fortran 77).
+        # This helps verify the compiler works too, so if some idiot sets FC to
+        # /usr/bin/ls, we will at least know it's not a working Fortran
+        # compiler.
+        if test -z "$FC"; then
+            sage_spkg_install_gfortran=yes
+            SAGE_MUST_INSTALL_GCC([a Fortran compiler is missing])
+        fi
```

The use of the `SAGE_MUST_INSTALL_GCC` macro here is a mistake.  It *might* be a remnant from before we created a separate "gfortran" package (that actually happened after I first introduced #24919, and while I tried to incorporate that change it looks like this might have been left in).

As Dima suggested it can just be removed and/or replaced with an `AC_MSG_NOTICE`.

<a id='comment:32'></a>OK wrap up for people interested in using something like pgfortran, you can get it from https://www.pgroup.com/ .
Before anyone ask, you cannot currently use pgcc/pgc++ to compile sage because they don't pretend to be gcc unlike clang and Intel. sage still wants a compiler that at least pretend to be gcc.

Set your environment

```
export PATH="/path_to_compiler_prefix/bin:$PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath=/path_to_compiler_prefix/lib"
export FPICFLAGS="-fPIC"
./configure FC=pgfortran
```
`FPICFLAGS` is specific to R.

* I will send a couple of PR to openblas. openblas's `f_check` script does a pretty good job of finding all the linking flags needed for your compiler. But in the case of PGI, specifically, ruins the results completely - literally  WTF? I will attach a patch for now.

* R needs hand holding. Its configure script has section that are hand crafted instead of using autotools standard macros. The only reason I can think of for doing that is ignorance. This is why you have to define `FPICFLAGS` in advance for it. However, it is not sufficient for configure to work out how to mix fortran and C code. So once the build breaks with an error on R 

```
FC="pgfortran -fPIC" ./sage -i r
```
and once done resume the build normally.

Don't define `FC=/path_to_compiler/my_fortran_compiler`. numpy's distutils extension get confused if you do that and scipy's compilation will fail because gnu options are passed to the compiler instead of appropriate ones.

Does non-Apple clang pretend to be GCC? How? Just wondering.

openblas need the upgrade to 0.3.3 because of this https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/1548

R is still fiddly and you still need to define `FPICFLAGS` manually. I think most of the difficulties there would disappear by using the intel compiler for C/C++ as well as fortran.

Anyway everything was sorted and built properly sage works and pass its doctests with flying colours on linux.

Adding intel for C/C++ requires adjustment in pari and possibly sqlite from what I remember. But this is an alternative that could really be made to work.
