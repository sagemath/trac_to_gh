In profiling areas of slowdown during import, one culprit (of likely several) I found was `deprecated_function_alias`.

This was called 80 times during `import sage.all`, and profiling suggests that a pretty absurd amount time in this, particularly on the line

```
frame1 = inspect.getouterframes(inspect.currentframe())[1][0]
```

On Python 2 kernprof gives:

```
   513        80        365.0      4.6      0.0      _check_trac_number(trac_number)
   514        80    1400403.0  17505.0     99.7      frame1 = inspect.getouterframes(inspect.currentframe())[1][0]
   515        80       2378.0     29.7      0.2      module_name = inspect.getmodulename(frame1.f_code.co_filename)
   516        80         78.0      1.0      0.0      if module_name is None:
   517                                                   module_name = '__main__'
   518        80       1944.0     24.3      0.1      return DeprecatedFunctionAlias(trac_number, func, module_name)
```

(where times are in microseconds).  This shows we're spending at least 1.5 seconds in this function alone which is not great even for Python 2, and is something worth looking into.  But on Python 3 it's absurd:

```
   513        80        354.0      4.4      0.0      _check_trac_number(trac_number)
   514        80   42581328.0 532266.6    100.0      frame1 = inspect.getouterframes(inspect.currentframe())[1][0]
   515        80       3287.0     41.1      0.0      module_name = inspect.getmodulename(frame1.f_code.co_filename)
   516        80         96.0      1.2      0.0      if module_name is None:
   517                                                   module_name = '__main__'
   518        80       2856.0     35.7      0.0      return DeprecatedFunctionAlias(trac_number, func, module_name)
```

The way it's used is not actually very important and I thought about trying to do away with it entirely.  But getting the previous stack frame (if one exists) is trivial to do, and the only problem with the existing code is that it was needlessly examining and constructing a data structure out of the entire stack.\n\n> You said the profiling of Sage startup was done with kernprof.

This has to do with figuring out where the `DeprecatedFunctionAlias` was defined, so it's has to happen at definition time.  The way it's used is not actually very important and I thought about trying to do away with it entirely.  But getting the previous stack frame (if one exists) is trivial to do, and the only problem with the existing code is that it was needlessly examining and constructing a data structure out of the entire stack.

It's not that simple.  kernprof alone can't analyze Sage startup times--this was just for line-profiling `deprecated_function_alias` itself since I had narrowed that down as a culprit for some slow to import modules.

What do you mean by that? Do you mean you want to find out the module of the function that is being deprecated? Why isn't that module determined in the same way that the module is determined for, say, `CachedFunction`?

I see. Anyway, if I understand correctly what module is being determined (namely the one of the function that is being deprecated), I don't see why a stack frame is relevant at all.

First of all, I can confirm a speedup for py2 (I am not testing py3): `sage --startuptime` gives 1103.930ms without the ticket and 798.564ms with the ticket.

One of the slowest imports without the ticket was

```
   24.867     24.946         35  sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod
```
With the ticket, importing integer_mod doesn't appear in the list of slowest imports at all -- and deprecated_function_alias only appears a single time in that module!

So, it is impressive.

And I think meanwhile I understand the problem that is solved by inspecting the stack: I thought when you do `f = deprecated_function_alias(1234, g)` then `f.__module__` is supposed to be equal to `g.__module__` (which wouldn't involve stack inspection). But now I realise that `f.__module__` is supposed to be the module in which `deprecated_function_alias` is called, and that's of course something where inspecting the stack totally makes sense.

It would in principle be possible to replace the call to `inspect.getmodulename(frame1.f_code.co_filename)` by something faster:

```
sage: import inspect
sage: frame0 = inspect.currentframe()
sage: frame1 = frame0.f_back
sage: %timeit inspect.getmodulename(frame1.f_code.co_filename)
The slowest run took 4.96 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.06 Âµs per loop
sage: cython('''
....: import os
....: cdef str slash = os.path.sep
....: cdef str dot = os.path.extsep
....: def extract(str name):
....:     return name[name.rfind(slash)+1:name.rfind(dot)]
....: ''')
sage: extract(frame1.f_code.co_filename)
'interactiveshell'
sage: %timeit extract(frame1.f_code.co_filename)
The slowest run took 17.48 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 341 ns per loop
sage: inspect.getmodulename(frame1.f_code.co_filename) == extract(frame1.f_code.co_filename)
True
```
However, I am not sure if enough deprecated function aliases are created so that an improvement from 6Âµs to 341ns could be noticed in startup time. Also I am not sure if the above implementation of the name extraction is 100% correct.

On the other hand: Couldn't that simply be passed as a parameter? Granted, it would mean to change

```
king@klap:~/Sage/git/sage$ grep "deprecated_function_alias(" -R src/sage | wc -l
123

places in the sage library. But a change from
`deprecated_function_alias(1234, f)` to `deprecated_function_alias(1234, f, `__name__`)` could easily be done with a little script. And since `__name__` is the name of the module in which `deprecated_function_alias` is currently being executed, it would solve the problem without any slow introspection.

So, would adding `..., `__name__`)` in 123 places be acceptable?

Too bad. Even if it was acceptable, it turns out that doing the change (I just did) only improves the startup time by 6ms or so.

I still would like to understand how you found out that `deprecated_function_alias` was responsible for slow startup time. `sage --startuptime <module_name>` only tells what modules are slow to import, but not why. I somehow feel challenged to try to improve startup time further...

It seems to work similarly to `import-profiler` (by replacing `__import__`).  The new import profiler baked into Python is still better in some ways, though I'm not wild about its output format, which could use improvement.  It would also be nice if it collected the raw data into an object that was available somewhere, perhaps either in the `sys` module or in `importlib`.  Perhaps I'll suggest that upstream...
