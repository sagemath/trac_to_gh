Currently, the following test would not pass:

```
sage: R.<x> = GF(2)[]
sage: S = R.quo(x)
sage: S in FiniteFields()
True
sage: type(S).mro()
...
 <class 'sage.categories.finite_fields.FiniteFields.parent_class'>,
...
```

In other words, a finite polynomial quotient ring that is a field does not inherit `ParentElements` of the category of finite fields.
