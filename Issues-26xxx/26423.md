Ideally, we would put all references into the master reference file. This handles some of the references in `sage/combinat`, enough so that a Python 3 build has a chance to succeed in building the documentation.

Depends on #26422

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
Regarding building the documentation with Python 3: if I also delete the `sagenb` documentation from the reference manual, then I run into this error:

```
[reference]   File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/PYTHON3/sage-8.4.beta7/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sphinx/search/__init__.py", line 174, in loads
[reference]     if not data or not s.startswith(self.PREFIX.encode()) or not \
[reference] TypeError: startswith first arg must be str or a tuple of str, not bytes
```
If I fix this by modifying Sphinx (probably not the right choice), the documentation builds in Python 3.

It would be good to track down where this bytes/str problem is coming from: it's probably some information that we're passing incorrectly to Sphinx.
