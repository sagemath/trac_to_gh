When given user input, we should also enforce that every element belongs to `ZZ`. Otherwise, this can lead to subtle problems:

```
sage: A = AffinePermutationGroup(['A',3,1])
sage: p = A([-3/1,2/1,3/1,8/1])
sage: p
Type A affine permutation with window [-3, 2, 3, 8]
sage: q = ~p
sage: q
Type A affine permutation with window [5, 2, 3, 0]
sage: q * p
Type A affine permutation with window [1, 3, 5, 7]
```
contrast with

```
sage: p = A([-3,2,3,8])
sage: q = ~p
sage: q
Type A affine permutation with window [5, 2, 3, 0]
sage: q * p
Type A affine permutation with window [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
