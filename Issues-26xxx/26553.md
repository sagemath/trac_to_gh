This ticket does several things:

    Another pass at the map-caching coercion model.
    
    _lmul_ and _rmul_ are way to permissive, and may recursively call mul itself. Need a better way of detecting actions.
```

2. Directly call `self._action_maps.get` in `bin_op` to avoid a call to `get_action`.

3. Remove special support for in-place operations from the coercion model. It's not used anywhere, so it's basically just dead code.

4. Remove the double caching in `Parent._action_hash`. There is no need for the parent to cache actions, since the coercion model already caches everything. Various places calling this method are changed to call `coercion_mode.get_action()` instead. However, we still keep references to the actions alive in a write-only hashtable.

5. Make `coercion_model._coercion_maps` and `coercion_model._action_maps` available to Python (mostly for debugging).

There are only very few classes implementing in-place operations (one example is `QuiverRepHom` in `src/sage/quivers/morphism.py`). However, it would not make much sense for the coercion model to handle in-place operations since coercion possibly creates new elements. Suppose that `x *= y` would coerce to a common parent. Then you end up doing `x2 *= y2`, so you lose the in-place effect on `x`.

That is a very good point. If the patchbot comes back green, then we can set a positive review.
