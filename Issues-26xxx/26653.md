```
Done here:
- some PEP8 cleaning
- improve some tests to avoid using `.edges()`, `.min_spanning_tree` when not necessary
- improve documentation of `strongly_connected_components_digraph`
- in method `bridges`, correct the edge label of returned edges when the graph has multiple edges has method `edge_labels` returns a list in this case.

The next steps, in (an)other ticket(s), are to improve method `is_cut_edge` as its current implementation may modify the input graph (bad), and then check all methods for triconnectivity.

I do not agree with this change:

```diff
-        ....:     assert (e1 == e2)
+        ....:     if e1 != e2:
+        ....:         print("Something goes wrong")
```
I think the test should immediately error out when something did go wrong.

I am not convinced that when the input vertex is not in the graph that it should raise a `LookupError`. It is not acting as a key, but instead as an input value. So IMO it should remain a `ValueError`.

Other than that LGTM.

I made required changes. I agree that the error should immediately be raised.

Concerning the `LookupError`, I did that change following what is done in the backends, but I agree that a `ValueError` is suitable here.

Thank you for the review.
