```
According to #25345, tests marked `optional - dochtml` are supposed to be run by default, but they are not, at least not for me. When I run doctests, I see

```
Using --optional=coxeter3,mpir,python2,sage
```
Note that `dochtml` is missing. As an experiment, I added

```
    sage: 1 + 1 == 3 # optional -- dochtml
    True
```
to a file, and when I ran `sage -t ...` on that file, tests passed. (Tests failed if I included the `--optional=dochtml` flag.)

Marked as a blocker because as things stand, we are skipping tests that we should not be skipping, and that we were not skipping before #25345.

Depends on #26184

I think this was added just recently, and the intent was explicitly to *not* require these tests by default.

I argued at the time that maybe it should be enabled by default, but only if `SAGE_DOC` can be found.

Recent, yes: merged in 8.4.beta1. But the intention was to keep testing by default:

- From the description at #25345: "This patch makes the doctests that depend on the htmldocs optional, but enables those doctests by default." 
- From [comment 23 there](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/25345#comment:23): "This change does not disable documentation in any way. It is still enabled by default and tested by default."

There would have been serious objections by me and by Jeroen (see [his comment 24](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/25345#comment:24)) to that ticket if it changed the default testing behavior.

```

Why is this called something so specific as "OPTIONAL_AND_EXTERNAL" and not just "TESTALL_FLAGS" or something?

The reason I did that change is because the `py2` tests were not able to be run without the `sage` tests being run too. They need the context (variables being set etc.). The `py2` tag was very much used as if it was intended to be used in an "and" combination with sage, not "or".

If that is not the case and we're reverting that, we need to mark the context of `py2` tests as `py2`, too.

There are no guidelines in the Sage documentation about this, as far as I know, and there are certainly doctests in the Sage library in which the "context" is not marked at all, and only the line actually using the optional part is marked as optional. (This is done in `sage/misc/latex.py`, for example, and also in a few files in `sage/homology`.)

It would be redundant and awkward to have

```
sage: basic computation 1
sage: basic computation 2
sage: basic computation 3

sage: basic computation 1 # optional - fancy
sage: basic computation 2 # optional - fancy
sage: basic computation 3 # optional - fancy
sage: fancy computation   # optional - fancy

The stated point of the original ticket was to be able to test the Sage library and skip over tests which depended on the docs; this is not the same as being able to test the docs independently, and if that was one of the goals of #25345, it was not clear to me. Given the situation with other optional tags in Sage, you shouldn't expect `sage -t --optional=dochtml --all` to pass. Running `sage -t --optional=latex --all` results in some failed tests, for example. Same with `--optional=chomp`.

As I said before, there are no guidelines that optional tests marked "TAG" must pass when run with only `--optional=TAG`. Therefore we shouldn't start imposing that restriction without an explicit agreement that the policy is being changed. Right now, the de facto policy is: optional tests marked "TAG" should pass when run with `--optional=sage,TAG` (but they don't need to pass with `--optional=TAG`).

That issue is really unrelated to this ticket, so let's not confound two issues.

I still think that the handling of `py2` in this ticket is better than before: it treats `py2` like all other optional tags, making things more consistent (agreed, consistently "wrong" but consistence is good).

I'm fine with having a wider discussion about the meaning of `--optional=sage` but that shouldn't hold up this ticket.

It worked before this ticket and doesn't work after. So I think it is related.

No, `py2` is differnt from other optional tags because it is added automatically. Before it was added automatically only when it made sense. With this change it is added in any case. I don't think that is an improvement.

Maybe not semantically but in practice they are. I don't see why we should hinder a practical usecase for that. Currently all `py2` tests assume that `sage` tests are run so it doesn't make any sense to add `py2` when `sage` is not tested.
It does not have any advantage whatsoever to add `py2` when `sage` is not added while it does have an advantage not to add it.

I don't think we should introduce a regression that can be easily fixed and does not have any disadvantages on typical workflow just because the solution is not good enough yet. A better solution can still come in the future but I expect that to take significant changes in the doctesting framework.

> The only part where I do agree is that I shouldn't be changing anything to `py2` on this ticket. But you also shouldn't have changed it on #25345 either.

I changed in in #25345 to make the use case of testing sage and dochtml seperately possible. I just never explicitly said that I intended to also run the dochtml tests. But I still think that was in-scope for that ticket.

> So let's just revert this to how it was in Sage 8.3 and discuss it in #26159. I honestly think that it's the most sensible thing to do.

I disagree but apparently your mind is made up.

> I"m not sure what the bug in the doctester is

It may be a bit much to call it a bug but I think Jeroen is talking about the inadequacy that currently makes it necessary to always include `sage` in the optionals list.

> but since #26159 is described as a wishlist, I think it is less focused then just being aimed at a single issue involving `py2`. So I think a more focused ticket should be opened.

The current behaviour is the one I want and introduced in #25345 (kind of out of scope because I did not mention that use case there). The change is revertet in this ticket:

```
-                if "sage" in options.optional:
-                    options.optional |= auto_optional_tags
+                options.optional |= auto_optional_tags
```

So there would be little use in reverting it here and then re-introducing it in another ticket. I think it shouldn't be reverted in the first place.

> I would do it, but I'm not sure what the issue is. Is it that we want `sage -t --optional=tag1,tag2,...` to skip `py2` tests unless `sage` is one of the tags?

We currently add some `--optional` tags by default. When we detect python2 we add the `py2` tag. In #25345 I changed that so that py2 is only added when `sage` is also tested. Here that change is reverted.

The use case is that I first build sage without doctest, testing `sage -t --optional=sage`. Then I have a different package which depends on sage, build the docs and is tested by `sage -t --optional=dochtml`. Before #25345 (and after this is merged) that will not work because it will also automatically try to run all the `py2` tests wihtout context.

Do you mean that they are always added by default? They do need to be handled somewhat special because they need to determine the python version at runtime.

At the time of setting it to positive review, it passed all doctests. We mentioned that the failures were really because of #26017 but you ignored that. Now that #26017 is merged, this ticket indeed breaks.
