    "body": "<a id='comment:2'></a>Thank you for implementing this! I will have some minor tweaks, but mostly it looks like a good first step. However, we should make this into an actual `Morphism` subclass (so we can define, e.g., compositions and coercions) and we should add a hook to a finite-dimensional Lie algebra so that it is exposed to the users. It probably a good idea to subclass `LieAlgebraHomomorphism_im_gens` for this. I can do this too if you would want or on a followup.",

On another note, I noticed that the test suites skip `_test_elements`. Would it be valid to append

```python
if not issubclass(self.__class__, parent._abstract_element_class):
    self.__class__ = parent.__make_element_class__(self.__class__)
```
at the end of initialization as in `sage.modules.with_basis.morphism.ModuleMorphism.__init__` to make the morphisms proper subclasses of the parent Hom-space, or would this cause some problems?
