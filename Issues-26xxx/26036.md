Thanks for the comment, I am still figuring out the morphism framework, so this is very helpful information. By a hook I take it you mean adding a method named for example `lie_algebra_morphism` in `sage.categories.lie_algebras.LieAlgebras.FiniteDimensional`? I will add this and change `LieAlgebraMorphism_from_generators` to a subclass of `LieAlgebraHomomorphism_im_gens` as you suggested.

On another note, I noticed that the test suites skip `_test_elements`. Would it be valid to append

```python
if not issubclass(self.__class__, parent._abstract_element_class):
    self.__class__ = parent.__make_element_class__(self.__class__)
```
at the end of initialization as in `sage.modules.with_basis.morphism.ModuleMorphism.__init__` to make the morphisms proper subclasses of the parent Hom-space, or would this cause some problems?
