Done here:
- add parameter `vertices` to specify the mapping vertex to consecutive integers to methods `_matrix_`, `incidence_matrix`, `weighted_adjacency_matrix`. It can also be used from `kirchhoff_matrix`
- use it in `spanning_trees_count`, `lex_BFS`, `spectrum`, `characteristic_polynomial`, `eigenvectors`, `eigenspaces`, etc.
- also do some cleaning in `to_dictionary`

Thanks for the review.

I agree that I did some too big tickets, and I really thanks you and Travis for your great help in reviewing them. I can certainly split some on them to ease the review if you think it is better. I tried to make tickets by parts / topics of `generic_graph.py` but this file needs so much work that I don't know how to do it differently.
