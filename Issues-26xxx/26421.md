  #!/usr/bin/env sage-python23
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ideal() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)
```

The calculation aborts, since the method `ideal`  of the class `LaurentPolynomialRing_generic` is not implemented but invoked via `content_ideal` which could be avoided or replaced by the function `lcm`.

But there are further problems:

1) The method `ideal` of the class `LaurentPolynomialRing_generic` raises the wrong error, since it doesn't have the right number of arguments.

2) The correct `NotImplementedError` would not be caught.

3) Factorization over some cases of integral domains is not implemented in the method `factor` of  the class `Polynomial` (even though it should be possible using the field of fractions)

4) Just aesthetically: The deprecation of the method `content` (#16613) has not been implemented properly (the warning can't be avoided by the user).

I do the following:

1) Correct the argument list of `ideal`.

2) Catch `NotImplementedError` on invocation from the method `roots` via `content_ideal` and inserted the use of `lcm` in case of exception

3) Implement the factorization over proper integral domains via the field of fraction in former cases of `NotImplementedError`.

4) Correct the deprecated invocations of `content`

The reason why I use `FractionField_generic` instead of `FractionField` in 3) is because the method `fraction_field` of the class `LaurentPolynomialRing_generic` returns the fraction field of the corresponding polynomial ring instead of the fraction field of itself (which would be the default from the class `CommutativeRing`). This causes coercion problems in `base_change` of the class `Factorization`.

I really don't understand the argument, why the field of fraction over the corresponding polynomial ring is preferred. Even not after reading the original discussion about that:

I agree! But how can I get the coercion work for the Laurent polynomial case?

sage: F = R.fraction_field()
sage: ti = F(1/t)

> - Do not have bare `except:` statements. List which errors you want to catch explicitly.


The bare `except` in the `factor` method I use because I don't want to change the previous behavior to much (which is a `NotImplementedError`). So a change should only be in the case of success. I can change the `pass` to an explicit `raise` command, to make this clear.

The other occurrence in the `roots` method I will erase, since a second try with `lcm` (which should have been `gcd`) doesn't make much sense.

Perhaps think about it this way, would you write `x/-1` or `-x`? Basically, you do not want units in the denominator, you would rather normalize that to `1`. So that is why I would say the current behavior is better in the latter example. I believe in terms of commutative algebra, the usual polynomial ring has a better category than Laurent polynomials, but I am not 100% sure of that aspect.

Something else that was going wrong was going between the two "different" fraction fields: the one for polynomials and for Laurent polynomials (see comment 3 on #15345). It makes things much easier when `R[x]` and `R[x,x^-1]` both go to `R(x)`.

I would say that is a bug in the conversion of the Laurent polynomial ring (and deserves a separate ticket). It seems like it is not converting the denominator to `self` before seeing if it a unit.

By having a bare `expect:` you are catching everything. Catch what you expect to be thrown as catching everything can further hide bugs. If you need to continue to propagate up an error, call `raise`. You can also have different behaviors for different exceptions, e.g.,:

```
try:
    foo
except ValueError:
    pass
except TypeError:
    raise
```

I still don't understand the change of the `FractionField` in ticket #15345. I understand that we want to avoid units in the denominator. But IMO, this issue is an internal of the FractionField_generic class. Why should this be something special for Laurent polynomial rings (except that it should support some information of what is an normalized representation)? Furthermore, the issue in comment 3 seems not to be reproducible with recent code:

```
sage: R = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')
sage: T = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x')
sage: R.gen() + T.gen()
2*x
sage: F1 = FractionField(R)
sage: import_statements('FractionField_generic')
from sage.rings.fraction_field import FractionField_generic
sage: from sage.rings.fraction_field import FractionField_generic
sage: F2 = FractionField_generic(R)
sage: R.gen() + F1.gen()
2*x
sage: R.gen() + F2.gen()
2*x
sage:
```

and all tests of ticket #15345 (under sage.rings) passed, when I removed the `fraction_field` method from the Laurent polynomial ring. On the other hand, the coercion problem does not occur for the original field of fraction:

```
sage: R(F2(1/t))
x^-1
sage: R(F1(1/t))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: fraction must have unit denominator
```


I have opened ticket #26425 for the coercion problem. Concerning this ticket I will reduce the coefficients of my example to polynomials in t, such that they will work for `R.fraction_field()` as well.

That is good, it means the coercion framework has independently gotten more robust. However, the last part bit of this example shows the problem:

```
sage: p = (1/F2.gen()) / (2 + F2.gen())
sage: q = 1/(2*F2.gen() + F2.gen()^2)
sage: q
1/(2*x + x^2)
sage: p == q
True
sage: hash(p) == hash(q)
False
```
Equal objects should have equal hashes (in this case, there is no coercion involved, it definitely should be consistent). This can cause very subtle problems with, e.g., `dict`s.
