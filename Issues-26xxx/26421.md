  #!/usr/bin/env sage-python23
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: ideal() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)
```

The calculation aborts, since the method `ideal`  of the class `LaurentPolynomialRing_generic` is not implemented but invoked via `content_ideal` which could be avoided or replaced by the function `lcm`.

But there are further problems:

1) The method `ideal` of the class `LaurentPolynomialRing_generic` raises the wrong error, since it doesn't have the right number of arguments.

2) The correct `NotImplementedError` would not be caught.

3) Factorization over some cases of integral domains is not implemented in the method `factor` of  the class `Polynomial` (even though it should be possible using the field of fractions)

4) Just aesthetically: The deprecation of the method `content` (#16613) has not been implemented properly (the warning can't be avoided by the user).

<a id='comment:2'></a>I do the following:

1) Correct the argument list of `ideal`.

2) Catch `NotImplementedError` on invocation from the method `roots` via `content_ideal` and inserted the use of `lcm` in case of exception

3) Implement the factorization over proper integral domains via the field of fraction in former cases of `NotImplementedError`.

4) Correct the deprecated invocations of `content`

The reason why I use `FractionField_generic` instead of `FractionField` in 3) is because the method `fraction_field` of the class `LaurentPolynomialRing_generic` returns the fraction field of the corresponding polynomial ring instead of the fraction field of itself (which would be the default from the class `CommutativeRing`). This causes coercion problems in `base_change` of the class `Factorization`.

I really don't understand the argument, why the field of fraction over the corresponding polynomial ring is preferred. Even not after reading the original discussion about that:

https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15345#comment:13

Without the `fraction_field`-method in the Laurent polynomial class the following doctests change (like they have been resulting originally).

Does this give a hint to the reason? Why is the current version of that doctests preferable?

I agree! But how can I get the coercion work for the Laurent polynomial case?

```
sage: R.<t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: F = R.fraction_field()
sage: ti = F(1/t)
sage: R(ti)

```

The bare `except` in the `factor` method I use because I don't want to change the previous behavior to much (which is a `NotImplementedError`). So a change should only be in the case of success. I can change the `pass` to an explicit `raise` command, to make this clear.

The other occurrence in the `roots` method I will erase, since a second try with `lcm` (which should have been `gcd`) doesn't make much sense.

Perhaps think about it this way, would you write `x/-1` or `-x`? Basically, you do not want units in the denominator, you would rather normalize that to `1`. So that is why I would say the current behavior is better in the latter example. I believe in terms of commutative algebra, the usual polynomial ring has a better category than Laurent polynomials, but I am not 100% sure of that aspect.

Something else that was going wrong was going between the two "different" fraction fields: the one for polynomials and for Laurent polynomials (see comment 3 on #15345). It makes things much easier when `R[x]` and `R[x,x^-1]` both go to `R(x)`.

I would say that is a bug in the conversion of the Laurent polynomial ring (and deserves a separate ticket). It seems like it is not converting the denominator to `self` before seeing if it a unit.

By having a bare `expect:` you are catching everything. Catch what you expect to be thrown as catching everything can further hide bugs. If you need to continue to propagate up an error, call `raise`. You can also have different behaviors for different exceptions, e.g.,:

```
try:
    foo
except ValueError:
    pass
except TypeError:
    raise
```

I have opened ticket #26425 for the coercion problem. Concerning this ticket I will reduce the coefficients of my example to polynomials in t, such that they will work for `R.fraction_field()` as well.

No, it is not. The field of fractions of Laurent polynomials means you have things like `(1/x)/1`. Mathematically, this is not really an issue, but for a computer trying to sort things out consistently (e.g., for hashing and equality), it is more subtle. See below.

It is because it has a relatively large set of units and it does not work as well wrt things like the Euclidean algorithm IIRC. This is what leads to the issues with normalizations.

That is good, it means the coercion framework has independently gotten more robust. However, the last part bit of this example shows the problem:

```
sage: p = (1/F2.gen()) / (2 + F2.gen())
sage: q = 1/(2*F2.gen() + F2.gen()^2)
sage: q
1/(2*x + x^2)
sage: p == q
True
sage: hash(p) == hash(q)
False
```
Equal objects should have equal hashes (in this case, there is no coercion involved, it definitely should be consistent). This can cause very subtle problems with, e.g., `dict`s.
