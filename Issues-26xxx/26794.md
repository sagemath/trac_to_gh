a doctest like that should work

```
sage: G = Graph(2)
sage: mem = get_memory_usage()
sage: for i in range(100000):
....:    x = 0 in G.breadth_first_search(0)
....:    if not i % 10000 and mem != get_memory_usage():
....:        raise MemoryError("there is a memory leak")
```

And in any case we can't really know how much [PC]ython over-allocates memory. So for example here, is the magic number 100000 big enought now? In the future?

But I suppose that this is a problem already solved by someone else.
