<a id='comment:3'></a>For `free_module_element.pyx`, the `e` is assumed to be a `dict`. So I can get a little bit of a speedup too:

```
sage: from sage.modules.free_module_element import FreeModuleElement_generic_sparse
sage: def S(R,n):
....:     return FreeModule(R, n, sparse=True)
....:
sage: %timeit FreeModuleElement_generic_sparse(S(RR,5), {0:-1, 2:2/3, 3:pi, 4:oo})
The slowest run took 15.53 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 16.4 µs per loop
```
vs before

```
sage: %timeit FreeModuleElement_generic_sparse(S(RR,5), {0:-1, 2:2/3, 3:pi, 4:oo})
The slowest run took 14.90 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 16.8 µs per loop
```
At the very least, it yields cleaner Cython code.

If my changes are good, then positive review.
