These GAP packages extend GAP kernel functionality. 
On the libgap side, this requires tinkering with the loader, see
on #22626 Erik [proposed a patch](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22626#comment:424).

Here is a branch that implements this.

We also need to fix GAP's gac/libtool mini-toolchain, used by some GAP pkgs. This involves patching of gac, and installing libtool, done in #27218.

oh, right --- except it's `.dylib`, not `.so`. (I searched for `libgap.so`, absent-mindedly, found unique match, tried it :-))

And indeed simply replacing `libgap.so` with `libgap.dylib` in the dlopen call suffices,
no need for the full path.

So this is easy to fix - except that in C I would have gone for a macro with the right extension, how is one supposed to do this in Cython?

`database_gap` spkg is there no more, it's part of `gap` spkg; in fact, already 
on #22626.
On #26856 Erik prefers to keep `gap_packages` optional, at least for the upcoming (quick) release 8.6, to make Debian deadline of 12 Jan.

We have not included IO there, as it'd be an extra over the current `gap_packages`, and something that needs more testing. Then we can extend `gap_packages` (and merge everything into `gap`, as we are already using the same tarball for `gap` and `gap_packages` anyway).

In Sage, we want a `__reduce__` method (or a different serialisation protocol) to return a data tuple that is eventually dumped to a string by standard Python tools. But it seems wrong to me if we have a complicated object (say, a cohomology ring) with several attributes, one of them being defined in libgap, and to write only this attribute directly to a file.

So, how do you envision libgap serialisation?

I'm not sure, but perhaps this is doable via their streams; it sounds like a reasonable feature to add to IO, if it's not there yet.

As Python serialisation was never my concern, I have little idea about it.

This is a SageMath ticket. So, Python serialisation has to come into play sooner or later.

Having IO installed and working is a nice first step. But eventually,

```
sage: G = libgap.DihedralGroup(8)
sage: loads(dumps(G))
```
should work. And also something like the following should work:

```python
class Foo(Ring):
    def __init__(self, G):
        assert G in Groups()
        self.G = G
        ...
    def __reduce__(self):
        return Foo, self.G
```
and then

```
sage: loads(dumps(Foo(libgap.DihedralGroup(8))))
```

But that would be for two follow-up tickets. One for pickling, the other for making libgap aware of Sage's categories (thus, translating `G in Groups()` into `bool(G.IsGroup())`).

If I remember correctly this is where `io.c` expect some of its "include". I am planning to patch in sage-on-gentoo rather than doing something like that.

Now going through the ticket and this bit in particular:

```
+    cdef void* handle
+    for suffix in ["so", "dylib", "dll"]:
+        handle = dlopen("libgap."+suffix, RTLD_NOW | RTLD_GLOBAL)
+        if handle != NULL:
+            break
```

where the point has been made that we don't need the full path. Now that starts to get unrelated but we do the same thing for libsingular in `libs/singular.pyx` and we go to great length to get the full path even defining it in `env.py`. If I read this correctly it is now way more complicated than it should be.

That's right. Perhaps the proper way would be to use `sdh_install` rather than `cp`, but on the other hand it's not clear to me whether `$GAP_ROOT/src/` is a location supported by this machinery.

Erik, could you look into this?

(Of course, GAP having its include files in the same directory as C sources is a problem, due to their lack of proper install mechanism...)

It isn't necessary normally when building the package, so why should it have to be patched?  ISTM the problem is just how GAP is being "installed" in Sage, which as we know is tricky since it doesn't have a proper installation system.  

I think the stuff Odile pointed out last night about `sysinfo.gap` clearly needs to be addressed (and in a separate ticket; this one is already trying to do too much).

For example, mine contains (this is just partial):

```
$ cat sysinfo.gap
# This files has been generated by the GAP build system,
# do not edit manually!
GAParch=x86_64-unknown-cygwin-default64
GAP_ABI=64
GAP_HPCGAP=no
GAP_ADDGUARDS2=

GAP_BIN_DIR="/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gap-4.10.0/src"
GAP_LIB_DIR="/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gap-4.10.0/src"

GAP_CC="gcc"
GAP_CFLAGS=" -O2 -g  "
GAP_CPPFLAGS=" -I/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gap-4.10.0/src/gen -I/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gap-4.10.0/src/src -I/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gap-4.10.0/src -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/include      "
GAP_LDFLAGS=" -L/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib      -L/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib   -Wl,--stack,16777216"
GAP_LIBS=" -lgmp -lz -lreadline    "
```

In other words, it puts in a lot of paths, which seem to be important for building many packages, but that reference the SPKG build directory and not the actual final GAP_ROOT location (under `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/gap`).

So I think this probably needs to be fixed up when "installing" GAP, at a minimum.

<a id='comment:63'></a>I added yet one more ticket for working on a way to get the libgap.so: #27230

The idea, as in comment:30, was to use the same code for both `SINGULAR_SO` and a new `LIBGAP_SO` variable which serves a similar purpose.

If that code ends up being contentious we can fall back on a simpler method, though I think either way it makes sense to reuse the code used for `SINGULAR_SO` as well, rather than just looping over some extension names.

could you run tests, just to have another data point? (I tested on OSX 10.13, I don't have 10.14, my OSX box is too old for it).

You just need to pull the branch, the GAP tarball is the same. So can be done over GSM :-)

After merging the branch, you'll need to do 

```
./sage -f gap_packages && make ptestlong
```

The "exit status -11" indicates that the `wtdist` program, whatever that is, from the guava package is segfaulting.  Which is odd because I don't remember having any problem with that before, and it's not clear why it would start with this ticket (unless maybe it's doing something with the IO module that it didn't do when it was unavailable).

I'm going to try backing out the changes from this ticket and rebuilding `gap_packages` again just to rule out the possibility that the problem is somehow related to this ticket.
