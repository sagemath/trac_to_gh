the `any` call is actually faster. Granted, your change will result in a faster error, but I think an error message being here is unexpected. Hence it is allowed to be slow.

All of the other changes LGTM.

The following lines are apparently incompatible with Python 3 (see patchbot).

```diff
+        if any(u in neighb for u,neighb in six.iteritems(M)):
+                u = next(u for u,neighb in six.iteritems(M) if u in neighb)
```

```diff
+        if any(u in neighb for u, neighb in six.iteritems(D)):
+                u = next(u for u, neighb in six.iteritems(M) if u in neighb)
```
Is there a special trick or should I turn these lines to for loops ?

No, no. It's just the patchbot prefering "iteritems" to "six.iteritems". Just change the imports accordingly.

And once again, it is never mandatory to have all green lights from the patchbot, as the patchbot is not smart..
