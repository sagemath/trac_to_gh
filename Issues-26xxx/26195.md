<a id='comment:45'></a>I cc roed because, David, you might know the answer at the following question.

In this ticket, we have implemented two parents, the first one for the Tate algebra itself and the second one for the monoid of terms of the Tate Algebra. Here is a basic example:

```
sage: A.<x,y> = TateAlgebra(Zp(2)); A
Tate Algebra in x (val >= 0), y (val >= 0) over 2-adic Field with capped relative precision 20
sage: T = A.monoid_of_terms(); T
Monoid of terms in x (val >= 0), y (val >= 0) over 2-adic Field with capped relative precision 20
```

We now want to add a method for recovering `A` (the Tate algebra) from `T` (the monoid of terms). However a method `algebra` already exists: it is inherited from `sage.categories.sets_cat.Sets` and provides a very general construction of an algebra over an arbitrary set.
We believe that this general construction is not very relevant in our setting and that `T.algebra()` should instead output `A`. So our question is: is it allowed/appropriate to override the method `algebra` (keeping in mind that it comes from the category machinery)? 

In any case, we will create a method `tate_algebra` but we think that having `algebra` at the same time (with a different behavior) could be confusing.

<a id='comment:81'></a>Tate algebras elements are now among the 10 files having the most failures with python3. See #26212.

EDIT:
And this is also bad:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/tate_algebra_ideal.pyx  # 29 doctests failed
```

One example of failure: bad use of range:

```
File "sage/rings/tate_algebra_ideal.pyx", line 83, in sage.rings.tate_algebra_ideal._groebner_basis_buchberger (build/cythonized/sage/rings/tate_algebra_ideal.c:3488)
        indices = range(l)
    TypeError: Expected list, got range
```

Other failure: change dict while iterating over this dict:

```
      File "sage/rings/tate_algebra_element.pyx", line 1151, in sage.rings.tate_algebra_element.TateAlgebraElement._normalize (build/cythonized/sage/rings/tate_algebra_element.c:12421)

There is also the inefficient

I addressed all of them except this one:
> And isn't `_pushout_family()` really just `coercion_model.common_parent()`?

because I'm not sure that `_pushout_family()` and `coercion_model.common_parent()` do the same job. At least if I replace the code of `_pushout_family()` by:

```
    elements = [initial] + list(elements)
    return coercion_model.common_parent(*elements)
```
I get many doctest failures.
