The local_analytic_interpolation method for hyperelliptic curves has a small bug in the case of Weierstrass points, in that it omits precision as a parameter. 

In particular, the current line 122 of sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_padic_field.py

```
   x,y = self.local_coord(S)
```
should be replaced with 

```
   x,y = self.local_coord(S,prec)
```

**CC:**  @alexjbest

**Keywords:** hyperelliptic curves, local coordinates
