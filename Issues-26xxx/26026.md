The main goal of these changes were to make this class work on Python 3, which previously it didn't due to comparisons failing while manipulating the heap queue data structures when building the tree.  The other problem was that the use of dict iterators meant that the codings weren't quite predictable; sometimes the codes for two characters could be swapped, leading to different test results (granted, not in a way that affects the length of the encodings).

This reimplements building the tree in a way that's deterministic and works the same on Python 2 and 3, and fixes a few other minor issues I noticed.

Looking at the implementation in #18315, it would suffer from the same problems this is trying to fix, so I think this ticket is still relevant, albeit obviously not directly compatible with #18315.

I haven't looked closely at the other coding algorithms added in that ticket but they might have some of the same kinds of problems too.  I have a few other nitpicks with that ticket but it looks good on the whole.

I haven't looked at it in any real detail yet, and I'm also not knowledgeable on the subject. It did seem worthy of a little more attention though.
