This ticket improves `sage.libs.giac` by adding support for:

- `lex`, `deglex`, as well as block orders with 2 `degrevlex` blocks in Groebner basis computations,
- computation of elimination ideals.

Additionally, this adds an optional keyword `algorithm=...`  to `sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal.elimination_ideal` to allow choosing between libsingular and Giac implementations.

For further information, here is the documentation of [giac's eliminate](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac/doc/fr/cascmd_fr/cascmd_fr282.html) and [the discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/cxs2fNKecLo/49nl9z1MCQAJ) in which I learned that Giac supports this.
