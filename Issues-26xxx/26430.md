-        return "Pairwise Balanced Design on {} points with sets of sizes in {}".format(self.num_points(),set(self.block_sizes()))
+        bsizes = str(frozenset(self.block_sizes()))[11:-2]
+        bsizes = '{' + bsizes + '}'
+        return "Pairwise Balanced Design on {} points with sets of sizes in {}".format(self.num_points(), bsizes)
```

It works, but i think the syntax is a little complicated, what do you think about using a list instead ?

```
return "Pairwise Balanced Design on {} points with sets of sizes in {}".format(self.num_points(),list(set(self.block_sizes())))
```

This should give you the same output in py2 and py3 `Pairwise ... sizes in [x, y ...]`
