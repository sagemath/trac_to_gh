At the moment the construction of group homomorphisms between groups implemented under the classes `ParentLibGAP` and `PermutationGroup_generic` (and vice versa) is not possible in sage using the method `hom`. For example, it isn't possible to construct the natural projection from symplectic groups onto the corresponding projective group although this is possible using GAP:

```
sage: Sp43 = Sp(4,3)
sage: PSp43 = PSp(4,3)
sage: natProj = Sp43.hom(PSp43.gens())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to convert [(3,4)(6,7)(9,10)(12,13)(17,20)(18,21)(19,22)(23,32)(24,33)(25,34)(26,38)(27,39)(28,40)(29,35)(30,36)(31,37), (1,5,14,17,27,22,19,36,3)(2,6,32)(4,7,23,20,37,13,16,26,40)(8,24,29,30,39,10,33,11,34)(9,15,35)(12,25,38)(21,28,31)] to an element of Set of Morphisms from Symplectic Group of degree 4 over Finite Field of size 3 to The projective symplectic linear group of degree 4 over Finite Field of size 3 in Category of finite groups
```

The reason for this is that the constructor of the class `GroupHomset_libgap` explicitly checks both groups to be instances of `ParentLibGAP`. So an easy way to have `hom` work in such cases, as well, would be to allow `PermutationGroup_generic` additionally.

An alternative option is to shift `PermutationGroup_generic` into the `ParentLibGAP` framework. But this would cause a lot of work to have all doctests pass through. The main problem here is that the element class of PermutationGroup_generic still has `parent` as second (optional) argument (in opposite to `ParentLibGAP`).

Therefore, this ticket will follow the first option!

I do the following:                           

1) I add the method `gap` to the classes `PermutationGroup_generic` and `PermutationGroupElement` to achieve compatibility with class `GroupHomset_libgap` and its elements class. For the same reason I add the method `_subgroup_constructor` to `PermutationGroup_generic` (needed in the methods `pushforward`, `kernel` and `preimage` in `GroupMorphism_libgap`)

2) I implement the method `_Hom_` in `PermutationGroup_generic` to have `hom` use class `GroupHomset_libgap`.


3) In the module `libgap_morphism` I add `PermutationGroup_generic` to the list of allowed parent-instances at all relevant pieces of code. Furthermore, I changed the `_element_constructor_` in order to avoid buffer size overflow by transferring long lists of large permutation generators to GAP. This is done in a new local method `_obtain_gap_hom`.

4) I take the occasion to implement two methods from framework: `section` of class `Map` and `natural_map` of class `HomsetWithBase` improving their default implementation using the possibilities of `GroupHomset_libgap` and its element class.

I am not convinced the function `_obtain_gap_hom` is useful/necessary. 
It seems to be used only for the `natural_map` method. But then the code just belongs there.
But indeed one could replace 

```
gens = [g.gap() for g in dom.gens()]
```
by

```
gens = dom.gap().GeneratorsOfGroup()
```
in the `_element_constructor_`
and likewise for the images in natural map. Would that fix the overflow?

in the `_element_constructor` method:

```

    imgs = codom.gap().GeneratorsOfGroup()
```
this seems to fit better with the `natural_map` method? Put it there.

Thanks for your useful hints, Simon! There where two problems:

1) I provided the wrong example, so that you did not have a chance to see what these lines of code should be good for. The correct example needs to have an instance of `PermutationGroup_subgroup` as codomain and be large enough to produce:

```
python2: libgap.c:184: libgap_get_input: Assertion `strlen(libGAP_stdin_buffer) < length' failed
```

2) The origin for this error, has not been in the `_element_constructor_` method. So any changes here where useless, as you pointed out. Actually, the problem was that GAP didn't know about the subgroup construction.

So I revert all changes of code with respect to the `_element_constructor_` and provide the example which caused the trouble in its docstring. I inserted a line of code in the constructor of the `PermutationGroup_subgroup` class to have the `gap` method of such a subgroup work well. This line I explain by a doctest in `gap`.

In addition I change the implementation of `gap`, since I realized that the former one can cause pickling errors.

I inserted the decorator since I removed the explixit caching via the `_libgap` attribute (since this caused pickling problems). I am not aware that there is an implicite caching mechanism via the element construction of class `Gap`. Can you explain how this is working?

It still seems to be there:

```
+    @cached_method
+    def gap(self):
+        if self._libgap is not None:
+            return self._libgap

```
To me it looks like there are 2 caches once via the _libgap attribute and once in the `@`cached method
Say if one first calls `.gap()` and then the _libgap attribute is set somewhere

In general it isn't cached via that attribute (I've removed that in my last change):

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: print S._libgap
None
sage: S.gap()
Sym( [ 1 .. 6 ] )
sage: print S._libgap
None
```

```
What happens here is a conversion of a gap element to an element of a permutation group. 
It would be more useful to let this be handled by the permuation group code
i.e. in the element constructor of permutation groups and not in the `_call_` method of the morphism.
Also there are a few little python style remarks for the doctests, like

```
+            sage: GS=G.subgroup([G.gen(0)])
```
should be 

```
+            sage: GS = G.subgroup([G.gen(0)])
```

This is a good improvement in order to get the permutation groups closer to libgap!
I just do two doc-string adaptions and rename your `GapElement` since that name is already used globally with respect to `sage.interfaces.gap`

Thanks for the review, Simon.
I wish you a merry Christmas!
