On Windows and macOS, WebGL line thickness support is absent
or limited, so that the three.js / threejs viewer appears not to respect
the thickness optional parameter in parametric_plot3d, while other
viewers such as Jmol and Tachyon do.

For example, in Sage 8.3 or 8.7 on macOS 10.10.5, the thickness
is not taken into account in the following -- whether launching it
from the Sage REPL, the Jupyter notebook, or even SageCell online:

```
sage: pi = RDF.pi()
sage: tau = 2*pi
sage: a = (lambda t: cos(t), lambda t: sin(t), lambda t: 2*t/tau)
sage: b = (lambda t: cos(t), lambda t: sin(t), lambda t: 2*t/tau + 1)
sage: aa = parametric_plot(a, (-tau, tau), color='blue', thickness=1)
sage: bb = parametric_plot(b, (-3*pi, pi), color='red', thickness=10)
sage: p = aa + bb
sage: p.show(viewer='threejs')
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object
sage: p.show(viewer='jmol')
Launched jmol viewer for Graphics3d Object
sage: p.show(viewer='tachyon')
Launched png viewer for Graphics3d Object
```

Suggested workarounds:
- use `radius` instead of `thickness`.
- use THREE.Meshline

<a id='comment:4'></a>That's probably because you're using a Windows machine. WebGL line thickness isn't supported at all in Windows, and support for it in macOS has limitations. It looks like line thickness will be removed from future versions of WebGL entirely.

The way to visualize thick lines is to use the `radius` parameter listed in the [documentation](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/threejs.html), which creates a cylinder along the path:

```
pi = RDF.pi()
tau = 2*pi
a = (lambda t: cos(t), lambda t: sin(t), lambda t: 2*t/tau)
b = (lambda t: cos(t), lambda t: sin(t), lambda t: 2*t/tau + 1)
aa = parametric_plot(a, (-tau, tau), color='blue', thickness=1)
bb = parametric_plot(b, (-3*pi, pi), color='red', radius=.1)
p = aa + bb
p.show(viewer='threejs')
```

Three.js has its own workaround for thick lines, but it's only in the examples, not the main library. I wouldn't implement it here until it's an official part of the main library.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Thanks for explaining and for the workaround.

This was under macOS 10.10.5, using either Firefox 66.0.2 (64-bit),
Opera 58.0.3135.118, Safari 10.1.2 (10603.3.8), so surely illustrating
the limitations you refer to.

Using `radius` as you suggest does the trick. A small enough radius works well.
If the curve is long and the radius gets somewhat large it is worth increasing the
number of plot points so that the (piecewise linear) cylinder still looks more
curved than piecewise linear.

The following works well:

```
pi = RDF.pi()
tau = 2*pi
a = (lambda t: cos(t), lambda t: sin(t), lambda t: 2*t/tau)
b = (lambda t: cos(t), lambda t: sin(t), lambda t: 2*t/tau + 1)
aa = parametric_plot(a, (-tau, tau), color='blue', radius=.02, plot_points=400)
bb = parametric_plot(b, (-3*pi, pi), color='red', radius=.04, plot_points=400)
p = aa + bb
p.show(viewer='threejs')
```

I also notice that the cylinders have a polygonal base, with a number of
sides depending on the radius; it seems to start 5-sided for small radius,
and then the number of sides grows with the radius. Is there a way to
control that number of sides?

The following example shows the number of sides starting at 5 then
increasing to 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11 (makes one want to guess the fomula
for `number_of_sides` as a function of `radius`):

```
pp = parametric_plot
cyl = lambda x, y: (lambda t: x, lambda t: y, lambda t: t)
pcyl = lambda x, y, r, h: pp(cyl(x, y), (0, 1), radius=r, rgbcolor=hue(h))
param = (.03, .04, .05, .06, .07, .08, .09, .10, .11, .12, .13, .14, .15, .16)
np = RDF(len(param))
cylparam = lambda i, r: (0, 2.05*sum(param[:i])+r, r, (i+1)/(np+1))
p = sum((pcyl(*cylparam(i, r)) for i, r in enumerate(param)), Graphics())
p.show(frame=False, viewer='threejs')
```

Hmm, good point.

Nice! I was not aware of that example (missed your [comment:4 previous comment] in this ticket), and I do agree it looks better. Also looks like we could use the wireframe example below it to spruce up the surface grid lines, too. One downside is that it doesn't seem to support varying width over the line like MeshLine does.

I will proceed along the same lines then.

> but keep in mind that all of the simple non-module JavaScript files are disappearing at the end of the year...


Out of curiosity, do we know how we're going to handle this? As I understand, modules can't be loaded from the filesystem. So...

- just drop support for running it purely locally, i.e. `online=False` and outside Jupyter?
- spin up a simple server the first time a Three.js plot is shown per session for the sole purpose of serving the Three.js files? Would probably want to print a warning: "Hey! This plot won't work once you exit Sage!"
- maintain our own non-module fork of the example files? I don't really have any interest in trying to keep such a fork up-to-date, even for only one file; heaven forbid the core Three.js ever goes module-only.
- something else?

<a id='comment:13'></a>I've pushed a branch that is based on the [webgl_lines_fat](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=fat#webgl_lines_fat) example that applies to both regular lines and surface grid lines. I opted not to follow the [webgl_lines_fat_wireframe](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=fat#webgl_lines_fat_wireframe) example for the surface grid since it would outline the generated triangles and not the original polygons coming from Sage.

Requires the following files from Three.js's `examples/js/lines` directory:

- `LineMaterial.js`
- `LineSegmentsGeometry.js`
- `LineGeometry.js`
- `LineSegments2.js`
- `Line2.js`

They have all been added to the threejs SPKG. Since I had to modify the SPKG anyway, I went ahead and bumped Three.js up to the current version, r120. The new tarball is attached. If it'd be preferred to do the upgrade/repackaging in a separate ticket first, I can do that as well.

Whether these files and the new `fat_lines.js` script that uses them are included on the page depends on whether any lines or surface meshes with thickness > 1 are present in the scene so as not to slow down loading of plots that don't require this functionality.

I'm anticipating a merge conflict with #30462, but it should be trivial.

Understood. Is there somewhere I would need to post the ticket number, like in sage-devel, in order for it to be picked up? Or would duplicating the structure of your r117 ticket, #29809, be enough?
