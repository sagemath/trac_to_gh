An *embedded (resp. immersed) degenerate submanifold of a proper 
pseudo-Riemannian manifold* `(M,g)` is an embedded (resp. immersed) 
submanifold `H` of `M` as a differentiable manifold such that pull 
back of the metric tensor `g` via the embedding (resp. immersion) 
endows `H` with the structure of a degenerate manifold.

Degenerate submanifolds are study in many fields of mathematics and physics,
for instance in Differential Geometry (especially in geometry of
lightlike submanifold) and in General Relativity. In geometry of lightlike 
submanifolds, according to the dimension `r` of the radical distribution
(see below for definition of radical distribution), degenerate submanifolds 
have been classify into 4 subgroups: `r-`lightlike submanifolds, Coisotropic 
submanifolds, Isotropic submanifolds and Totally lightlike submanifolds.
(See the book of Krishan L. Duggal and Aurel Bejancu in *REFERENCES*.) 

In the present module, one can define any of the 4 types but most of the methods are implemented only for degenerate hypersurfaces who belong to
`r-`lightlike submanifolds. However, there might be generalized to
`1-`lightlike submanifolds. In the literature, there is a new approach (the rigging technique) for studying `1-`lightlike submanifolds but
here we the method of Krishan L. Duggal and Aurel Bejancu base on
the screen distribution.

Let `H` be a lightlike hypersurface of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold
`(M,g)`. Then the normal bundle `T^\perp H` intersect the tangent 
bundle `TH`. The radical distribution is defined as
`Rad(TH)=TH\cap T^\perp H`. In case of hypersurfaces, and more
generally `1-`lightlike submanifolds, this is a rank 1 distribution. 
A screen distribution `S(TH)` is a complementary of `Rad(TH)` in `TH`.

Giving a screen distribution `S(TH)` and a null vector field `\xi` 
locally defined and spanning `Rad(TH)`, there exists a unique 
transversal null vector field 'N' locally defined and such that 
`g(N,\xi)=1`. From a transverse vector 'v', the null rigging 'N'
is giving by the formula

.. MATH::

    N = \frac{1}{g(\xi, v)}\left(v-\frac{g(v,v)}{2g(xi, v)}\xi\right)

Tensors on the ambient manifold `M` are projected on `H` along `N`
to obtain induced objects. For instance, the induced connection is the linear connexion defined on `H` through the Levi-Civitta connection of `g` along `N`.

To work on a degenerate submanifold, after defining `H` as an instance of :class:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold.DifferentiableManifold`, with the keyword *structure='degenerate_metric'*, you have to set a transvervector `v` and screen distribution together with the radical distribution.

An example of degenerate submanifold from General Relativity is the
horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole. Allow us to recall that 
Schwarzschild black hole is the first non-trivial solution of Einstein's equations. It describes the metric inside a star of radius `R = 2m`, being `m` the inertial mass of the star. It can be seen as an open ball in a Lorentzian manifold structure on `\RR^4`::

Keywords: Degenerate (or lightlike) submanifold

<a id='comment:25'></a>Shouldn't "Shawrzschild" be "Schwarzschild" (appears several places).

Regarding the documentation, I skimmed it for formatting and fixed some of the problems. I am pretty sure there are more, for example cases where `'M'` should be ``M`` (you want backquotes so the symbol will appear in math mode, not in quotes). In `adapted_frame`, do you want to use `\xi` instead of `xi`?

I strongly encourage running `make` and then opening up the reference manual (e.g. with `./sage -c 'reference()'`, and then proofreading for both formatting and content. I just made formatting changes, no changes to the content.

You have added a Jupyter notebook at the root of Sage directory in the last commit. I guess this is an error. In any case, Trac branches are not the place for this. Only source code (Python, Cython, reStructuredText, etc.) should be present. Could you remove it? A good place for publishing Jupyter notebooks is a public git repository, on which one can make a link via nbviewer or binder.

<a id='comment:45'></a>I've fix some issues in the last commit. Some of them were revealed by the patchbot:
- the documentation failed to build, due to the duplicate reference `[DS2010]` in `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`
- the startup time was increased due to these unnecessary import statements in `src/sage/manifolds/all.py`:

```
import sage.manifolds.differentiable.degenerate

```

Other fixes:
- the files `degenerate.py` and `degenerate_submanifold.py` were in executable mode; I've removed this
- there was a regression regarding the unique tag of manifolds in `src/sage/manifolds/manifold.py`; I've restored the change introduced in #28365

<a id='comment:48'></a>The patchbot is green, but the documentation still requires some improvements.
For instance

- the method `mean_curvature()` of class `DegenerateSubmanifold` has an `OUTPUT` section reduced to *a dictionary*. This is not sufficient, you should tell what are the keys and the values of that dictionary. Same thing for `principal_directions()`.
- there are unnecessary semicolons at the end of the `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` fields in `projection()` (and maybe elsewhere)
- the description of `screen_projection()` is not understandable: *...T′(v1,…,vr) is the projection of T(v1,…,vr) on the bundle spans by screen along the bundle spans by the transversal plus the radical vector fields provided.* Should *spans* be *spanned*? Same thing in `projection()`. 
- A `Phi` sould be `\Phi`

Could you please check the html output of the documentation and correct other possible errors?
