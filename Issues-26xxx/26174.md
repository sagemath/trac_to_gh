This ticket updates (Jupyter) notebook to 5.7.0.

(The security fix in notebook 5.6.0, mentioned at [#25638 comment:10](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/25638#comment:10), was really about upgrading to MathJax 2.7.4, which for Sage was done in #25032.)

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Notebook 5.6.0 adds two new dependencies: 
- [ipaddress](https://pypi.org/project/ipaddress/) 1.0.22; ipaddress is a standard module in py3.3+, and this module adds that functionality for py2.7).
- [prometheus_client](https://pypi.org/project/prometheus_client/) 0.3.1; seems to be some metrics format for analytics, added in [this PR to jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/3490).

I've added these pip modules as new standard packages. Note that the `ipaddress` dependency will not be necessary for python 3.3+.

If I understand correctly, the security issue is solved by the upgrade to MathJax 2.7.4.

See [discussion on the "Project Jupyter" mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jupyter/wm00hlNctJg/dlG5mrmpDQAJ).

In Sage we upgraded to MathJax 2.7.4 in #25032.

Still, upgrading to notebook 5.6 is a good thing to do.

I took the approach of `subprocess32` and `enum34` and simply added some lines in spkg-install which check `$SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`. This assumes that py3.x with x<3 won't be used, and though this seems safe to me, I didn't see any place where this was explicitly ruled out or mentioned.

I've tested the new version of the notebook (with python2) a little bit at least to see that it runs / opens Sage notebooks. Interactive widgets still seem to work as well.
