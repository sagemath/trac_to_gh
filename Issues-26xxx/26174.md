This ticket updates (Jupyter) notebook to 5.7.0.

(The security fix in notebook 5.6.0, mentioned at #25638#comment:10, was really about upgrading to MathJax 2.7.4, which for Sage was done in #25032.)

- [notebook](https://pypi.org/project/notebook) 5.7.0 (from 5.5.0) [tarball](https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/cd/41/b04ddb3020bdb55431f2a06c87ff98bf68fb27cd0c165ae6421c17d3b5cb/notebook-5.7.0.tar.gz)

This ticket also adds the two new dependencies of notebook as standard packages:
- [ipaddress](https://pypi.org/project/ipaddress/) 1.0.22 [tarball](https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/97/8d/77b8cedcfbf93676148518036c6b1ce7f8e14bf07e95d7fd4ddcb8cc052f/ipaddress-1.0.22.tar.gz)
- [prometheus_client](https://pypi.org/project/prometheus_client/) 0.3.1 [tarball](https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a1/b1/08de091b392fec31da9bd3f5edd9214ec1c6931dd81641610ac20f3ff934/prometheus_client-0.3.1.tar.gz)

<a id='comment:4'></a>If I understand correctly, the security issue is solved by the upgrade to MathJax 2.7.4.

See [discussion on the "Project Jupyter" mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jupyter/wm00hlNctJg/dlG5mrmpDQAJ).

In Sage we upgraded to MathJax 2.7.4 in #25032.

Still, upgrading to notebook 5.6 is a good thing to do.
