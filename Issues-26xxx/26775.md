This is the logic that the coercion model uses when it calls an action:

1. Get the action object (an `Action` instance) given the parents of both arguments and the operation. This is cached using `TripleDict`, so lookup of known actions is fast.

2. Call the action using the generic `__call__` interface.

3. The action checks again the parents of the arguments.

4. The actual action method `_act_` is called.

Step 3 takes a non-trivial amount of time and is completely unneeded since the coercion model already knows that the parents are correct.

We also remove the `(op is not sub) and (op is not isub)` checks: I see no reason why actions should not be allowed for subtraction.

Depends on #24500
