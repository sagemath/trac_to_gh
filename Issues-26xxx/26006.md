The local_coord method for hyperelliptic curves has a bug in the case of points in Weierstrass residue disks.

In particular, the current lines 605-606 of sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_generic.py 
should do something like this: 
- check if the y-coordinate is 0 or is 0 mod p as relevant, 
- and in the latter case, use the current local_coordinates_at_weierstrass method at the point in the disk with y-coordinate 0 and translate the local coordinate appropriately.
