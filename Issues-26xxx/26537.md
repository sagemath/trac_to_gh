```
and

```
sage: SR(QQ.extension(x^2 + 5*x + 12, 'alpha1').gen())
```
throw exceptions as they should, but

```
sage: real(QQ.extension(x^2 + 5*x + 12, 'alpha1').gen())
-5/2
sage: imag(QQ.extension(x^2 + 5*x + 12, 'alpha1').gen())
1/2*sqrt23
```
return a result. Indeed the real part is independent of the embedding, so correct, but the imaginary part is depends in the embedding.
