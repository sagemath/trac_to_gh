Forgive (and feel free to ignore) the nitpick, but I would prefer

```
            sage: A = matrix(R,[[7*t^2 - t - 9, -1/4*t - 1, -17*t^2 - t + 1],
            ....:               [-t^2 + 1/4*t, t^2 + 5/7*t + 3, 1/5*t^2 + 1662],
            ....:               [-2*t - 3, 2*t^2 + 6*t - 1/2, -1/6*t^2]])
```

```
            sage: a = matrix(ZZ,4,[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1,
            ....:                  -1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 1, 2]); a
```
as it is more in line with PEP8. Feel free to set to a positive review in either case.
