Follow-up from #17339 - Polyhedron class mistreats empty inputs.

As suggested in [#17339 comment:5](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/17339#comment:5), we complement the `Polyhedron` constructor with several new constructors with simpler semantics.

- `Polyhedron.from_Vrep`
- `Polyhedron.from_Hrep`
- `Polyhedron.empty`

We also add a constructor `Polyhedron.from_Vrep_and_Hrep` that accepts both Vrep and Hrep (backend work for this appears on #22701, #26368).


But there are open questions regarding the possible design. All `Polyhedron` methods currently guarantee minimal representations. This is reflected also in the names of methods for accessing the V-represenation, such as `vertex_generator`; but not in those for the H-representation (`inequality_generator`). (Note the `minimize` argument is unused in the whole `Polyhedron` code.) Compare with polymake, which has a clear distinction between minimal and non-minimal presentations (VERTICES vs. POINTS). This ia addressed in #34327.


Follow-up / related:

- make this used in `as_polyhedron` method in `face.py`
- "lazy" backend for `Polyhedron`

Here is just a note about constructing from both V- and H- representation:

The method `as_polyhedron` of `PolyhedronFaces` would benefit greatly from this, so perhaps as a follow-up or on this ticket.

This is an early draft, with the purpose of supporting #31799. Comments and improvements to the design are very welcome.

One thing needed for #31799 is finding the parent early - then, for parents that implement init from both representations, one could efficiently compute the double description before calling the element constructor.

What is the status here?

I think the minimal/non-minimal issue should really be fixed. In a way, it is only relevant for `Polyhedron_mutual`. If the backend doesn't allow modification, then what is the point in being lazy?

I really don't know what name choices what make sense and involve little deprecation.
