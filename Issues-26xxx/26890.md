<a id='comment:10'></a>There is one failure because of the fact that coercion is now taken into account. So we also need this change in `sage/combinat/root_system/extended_affine_weyl_group.py`:

```diff
     Note that for untwisted affine type the dual form of the classical Weyl group
     is isomorphic to the usual one, but acts on a different lattice and is therefore different to sage::
 
         sage: W0v = E.dual_classical_weyl(); W0v
         Weyl Group of type ['A', 2] (as a matrix group acting on the weight lattice)
         sage: v = W0v.from_reduced_word([1,2])
         sage: x = PvW0(v); x
         s1*s2
         sage: y = PW0(v); y
         s1*s2
-        sage: x == y
-        False
         sage: x.parent() == y.parent()
         False
+
+    However, because there is a coercion from ``PvW0`` to ``PW0``,
+    the elements ``x`` and ``y`` compare as equal::
+
+        sage: x == y
+        True
+
```
Once changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
