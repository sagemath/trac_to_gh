How to do this automatically and be py3-compatible? With

```
'certificate' in inspect.getargspec(LatticePoset().is_subdirectly_reducible).args
```

I can see that there is a certificate-option, but "Python 3.5+ recommends inspect.signature()."

Thanks, that was fast. So the code can be something like

```
from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
props = ['is_distributive', 'is_self_dual', 'is_modular']
L = posets.RandomLattice(10, 0.99)
for p in props:
    f = attrcall(p)
    if 'certificate' in sage_getargspec(getattr(L, p)).args:
        if attrcall(p)(L) != attrcall(p, certificate=True)(L)[0]:

As an example of bugs to be found with this: #26857.

Nice way to handle `is_doubling_constructible` and other currently handled by `test_attrcall` is needed.
