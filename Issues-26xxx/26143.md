Implementation of a SymplecticTableau object and SymplecticTableaux factory class.

The SymplecticTableau object will allow for the different types of symplectic tableau in the literature (Kashiwara-Nakashima tableaux, DeConcini tableaux, King tableaux, Sundaram tableaux) and have methods to convert between any two of them. In particular, this will include an implementation of the Sheats bijection.
