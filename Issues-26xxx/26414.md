1. It should return `Integer` instances, not `int`:

```
sage: x, y = rational_power_parts(1, 1/1)
sage: type(y)
<type 'int'>
```

This is causing breakage if `from __future__ import division` is added.

2. Improve the fix from #15605 to work more generally for all negative bases.

3. Add a few Cython optimizations.
