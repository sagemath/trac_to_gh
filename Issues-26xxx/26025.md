Well that's not the point of configurability. Also how can the default be in `SAGE_SHARE`? Is it determined relative to the pari binary? Or how else is it determined? Is `GP_DATA_DIR` still respected after this change?

Well, it depends a bit on the distribution but you can put special files under `/etc/env.d/` or `/etc/profile.d` - whichever is available - and they will be sourced on interactive login. An example under ubuntu

```
frb15@p7login-rcc:~$ ll /etc/profile.d/
total 36
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 Jul 31 22:30 ./
drwxr-xr-x 112 root root 12288 Aug  7 12:49 ../

-rw-r--r--   1 root root  1003 Dec 29  2015 cedilla-portuguese.sh
-rw-r--r--   1 root root   168 Mar 17  2017 pwr7-prefix_path.sh
-rw-r--r--   1 root root  1557 Apr 15  2016 Z97-byobu.sh
```
If you look the first one for example

```
frb15@p7login-rcc:~$ cat /etc/profile.d/apps-bin-path.sh 
# shellcheck shell=sh

# Expand $PATH to include the directory where snappy applications go.
snap_bin_path="/snap/bin"
if [ -n "${PATH##*${snap_bin_path}}" -a -n "${PATH##*${snap_bin_path}:*}" ]; then
    export PATH=$PATH:${snap_bin_path}
fi

# Ensure base distro defaults xdg path are set if nothing filed up some
# defaults yet.
if [ -z "$XDG_DATA_DIRS" ]; then
    export XDG_DATA_DIRS="/usr/local/share:/usr/share"
fi

# Desktop files (used by desktop environments within both X11 and Wayland) are
# looked for in XDG_DATA_DIRS; make sure it includes the relevant directory for
# snappy applications' desktop files.
snap_xdg_path="/var/lib/snapd/desktop"
if [ -n "${XDG_DATA_DIRS##*${snap_xdg_path}}" -a -n "${XDG_DATA_DIRS##*${snap_xdg_path}:*}" ]; then
    export XDG_DATA_DIRS="${XDG_DATA_DIRS}:${snap_xdg_path}"
fi
```
So it is totally possible for your pari or pari database package to add such a file with the right value for `GP_DATA_DIR`.

Thanks for the suggestion. However I think it is not the best one for me in this case. It requires setting global environment variables for the user, which is not ideal. It will also break if the user uses `env` or something to clear their env vars.


When using `--datadir` to point to somewhere else than `<pari-prefix>/share/pari`, the `cypari` build breaks because it depends on files in `share/pari` (that are not installed datasets). I'm not sure if the same would have happened with `GP_DATA_DIR` or if `--datadir` has somewhat different semantics.

The best solution I see is to symlink the installed datasets to `<pari-prefix>/share/pari`. Just as the `--configure` option, that will require rebuilds. Maybe using different datasets is uncommon enough in practice that thats not a big deal.

The actual code in pari setting the datadir at runtime

```
  pari_datadir = os_getenv("GP_DATA_DIR");
  if (!pari_datadir)
  {
#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN32__)
    if (paricfg_datadir[0]=='@' && paricfg_datadir[1]==0)
      pari_datadir = win32_datadir();
    else
#endif
      pari_datadir = pari_strdup(paricfg_datadir);
  }
  else pari_datadir= pari_strdup(pari_datadir);
```
So `GP_DATA_DIR` over-rides the default location set by `--datadir` at runtime.

I applied this patch on the sage nix package, removed the line that was setting `GP_DATA_DIR` and symlinked the data packages into pari's `share` folder. However something is wrong:

```
    TypeError: Error executing code in GP:
    CODE:
        sage[27]=polgalois(sage[26]);
    PARI/GP ERROR:
      ***   at top-level: sage[27]=polgalois(sage[26])
      ***                          ^-------------------
      *** polgalois: error opening galois file %s: `/nix/store/rcfgmlmqx4iffikynvb7d5dc0gzvv3al-sage-with-env-8.3/share/pari/galdata/NAM9'.
```

And various other errors of that type. For some reason, `gp` looks in `<sage-prefix>/share/pari/galdata` instead of `<pari-prefix>/share/pari/galdata`.

`print(default(datadir))` in `gp` gives `<pari-prefix>/share/pari`, as expected.

I only get errors referring to `galdata`. This worked when I was setting `GP_DATA_DIR` to a non-standard location. Not sure where that error is coming from.
