It's an environment variable specific to PARI/GP and the location which is set in `interfaces/gp.py` is the default anyway.

Well that's not the point of configurability. Also how can the default be in `SAGE_SHARE`? Is it determined relative to the pari binary? Or how else is it determined? Is `GP_DATA_DIR` still respected after this change?

So it is totally possible for your pari or pari database package to add such a file with the right value for `GP_DATA_DIR`.

Thanks for the suggestion. However I think it is not the best one for me in this case. It requires setting global environment variables for the user, which is not ideal. It will also break if the user uses `env` or something to clear their env vars.


When using `--datadir` to point to somewhere else than `<pari-prefix>/share/pari`, the `cypari` build breaks because it depends on files in `share/pari` (that are not installed datasets). I'm not sure if the same would have happened with `GP_DATA_DIR` or if `--datadir` has somewhat different semantics.

The best solution I see is to symlink the installed datasets to `<pari-prefix>/share/pari`. Just as the `--configure` option, that will require rebuilds. Maybe using different datasets is uncommon enough in practice that thats not a big deal.

  pari_datadir = os_getenv("GP_DATA_DIR");

<a id='comment:18'></a>I applied this patch on the sage nix package, removed the line that was setting `GP_DATA_DIR` and symlinked the data packages into pari's `share` folder. However something is wrong:

```
    TypeError: Error executing code in GP:
    CODE:
        sage[27]=polgalois(sage[26]);
    PARI/GP ERROR:
      ***   at top-level: sage[27]=polgalois(sage[26])
      ***                          ^-------------------
      *** polgalois: error opening galois file %s: `/nix/store/rcfgmlmqx4iffikynvb7d5dc0gzvv3al-sage-with-env-8.3/share/pari/galdata/NAM9'.
```

And various other errors of that type. For some reason, `gp` looks in `<sage-prefix>/share/pari/galdata` instead of `<pari-prefix>/share/pari/galdata`.

`print(default(datadir))` in `gp` gives `<pari-prefix>/share/pari`, as expected.

I only get errors referring to `galdata`. This worked when I was setting `GP_DATA_DIR` to a non-standard location. Not sure where that error is coming from.
