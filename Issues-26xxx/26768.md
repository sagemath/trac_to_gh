I don't understand why you now get the deprecation warning for that `sum`. However, since that function is deprecated, I would just revert that change. Once done, you can set a positive review.

I have instead added the deprecation warning in the doctest.

With this change, all doctests in structure/ pass both with py2 and py3.

So, even if I do no like at all this mysterious appearance of deprecations, I would rather bear with it right now, in order to make good progress towards python3.
