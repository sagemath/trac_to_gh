The incremental build seems to fail (on its second run) when an SPKG is removed.

https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26732#comment:6

The error that occurs is:

```
configure: error: "/home/sage/sage/build/pkgs/cephes/type" is missing.
If you would like to try to build Sage anyway (to help porting),
export the variable 'SAGE_PORT' to something non-empty.
Makefile:39: recipe for target 'build/make/Makefile' failed
make[1]: *** [build/make/Makefile] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/sage/sage'
Makefile:31: recipe for target 'base-toolchain' failed
make: *** [base-toolchain] Error 2
ERROR: Job failed: exit code 2
```

It could be that our patching of the incremental images does not handle deletions correctly.

Or maybe it's just a general bug in incremental builds and nothing specific about the docker setup.

Perhaps a little of both.  In general there should be no problem with removing packages in incremental builds.  But there might also still be some bugs in the uninstall system, and perhaps it only impacts the docker image builds even if it is in some way a more generic bug.

The code causing this particular error is from `m4/sage_spkg_collect.m4`:

```
for DIR in $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/*; do
    test -d "$DIR" || continue

    PKG_TYPE_FILE="$DIR/type"
    if test -f "$PKG_TYPE_FILE"; then
        PKG_TYPE=`cat $PKG_TYPE_FILE`
    else
        AC_MSG_ERROR(["$PKG_TYPE_FILE" is missing.])
    fi
```

I think this code could be made more robust.  I don't think there's a reason to return an error if a directory under `build/pkgs/*` does not actually contain an SPKG.  It should probably check a few other things to determine if a directory is an SPKG, and at worst issue a warning.  Maybe only error here if for all intents and purposes it still looks like an SPKG but is missing some required file.

On the Docker build end of things the issue probably has something to do with empty directories not being deleted properly.

I think maybe what I'll do fornow is require there to be an `SPKG.txt`, at a minimum, for the directory to be considered an SPKG, and ignore any directory that doesn't have it.

I would still like to redo the proliferation of file that make up an "SPKG" but that's something I can tackle another time.

Some of the packages actually do not have an SPKG.txt (python3 e.g.)

So let's test for `type`.
