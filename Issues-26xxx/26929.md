We have a problem in 8.4 that didn't arise in 8.2:

```
sage: R.<a0,a1,a2>=BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: P.<X>=R[]
sage: PQ.<t>=P.quo(X^4+X+1)
sage: (t^4+t+1)==0 #problem
False
sage: (t^4+t+1).is_zero() #correct
True
```

The quotient by a principal ideal does not work anymore:

```
sage: P.quotient_by_principal_ideal(P.ideal(X^4+X+1))
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.BooleanPolynomial' object has no attribute 'dict'
```

So, why do boolean polynomials not implement a `dict()` method that the generic polynomial code expects every polynomials to implement apparently?

```
sage: R.one().dict()
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.BooleanPolynomial' object has no attribute 'dict'
```

Earlier that code path was not triggered, because the code asked the boolean polynomial ring `isinstance(R, IntegralDomain)` which it is not. This was however, the wrong question. Now it correctly asks `R in IntegralDomains()` which it is.

So, if you want to fix this, maybe just implement `dict()` like other polynomial rings do.

> The problem: the method is_integral_domain is just inherited from generic polynomial rings, where it just returns whether the base ring is an integral domain. However, a BooleanPolynomialRing is of course NOT a free polynomial ring, so this is completely wrong. I don't know what the right way is to override, because in a way the problem is much deeper: If we inherit from GenericPolynomialRing, don't we end up with something that SHOULD be an integral domain? So should BooleanPolynomialRing inherit from something else?


Well, when I wrote the things above, I had just assumed that boolean polynomial rings are free since they inherited from the generic implementation. Now that I read what they actually are, I agree that they should definitely not inherit from that class.

I guess they should probably just inherit from Parent and set the right category, see sage.structure.parent. There might be a better superclass though.

Thanks for these fixes, Martin. I've tested your commits on top of 8.5. The example works now.
Then I looked at another use case of mine which has an additional quotient ring. A coercion from one quotient ring to the other fails. Here is the expanded example:

```
varl = ['x0', 'x1', 'x2', 'x3']
B = BooleanPolynomialRing(names = varl)
B.inject_variables(verbose=False)
P.<p> = PolynomialRing(B)
Byte.<t> = P.quotient_ring( p^4 + p + 1 )
t^4 + t + 1 == 0   # o.k.
X = B.gens()
x = Byte(list(X))

Baff = P.quotient( p^4 + 1 )
xa = Baff(x)
```

The last statement fails. In version 8.2 and before it works with `xa` being `x3*pbar^3 + x2*pbar^2 + x1*pbar + x0`. Something is still missing?

These are conversions, not coercions. The idea is that a coercion is only considered if there is a canonical, mathematically motivated, morphism available. Coercions are performed automatically (for instance in `1 + a` and things like that).

Conversions are explicit: `ZZ(...)`, and are allowed to perform a "best effort" attempt at creating an appropriate element, with the basic rule that if a coercion is available to create such an element, then the result should be compatible with that.

It is definitely desirable to reduce inconsistencies in conversions, but since they are inherently allowed to be a bit ill-defined (or partial, as with conversion from QQ to ZZ), inconsistencies are going to be unavoidable.

I would therefore propose to move the request that conversions from univariate quotient rings to subrings of the base ring get harmonized with those of multivariate quotient rings to another ticket, so that this (critical!) ticket can be closed.

On that ticket, relevant information might be:

```
sage:  R.<x,y> = QQ[]; S.<a,b> = R.quo(x^2 + y^2);
sage: ZZ.coerce_map_from(S) is None
True
sage: ZZ.convert_map_from(S)
Conversion via _integer_ method map:
  From: Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (x^2 + y^2)
  To:   Integer Ring
```
In the univariate case another map gets picked up; one that apparently always fails.

```
sage: R.<x>=QQ[]; S.<a>=R.quo(x^2+1)
sage: m=ZZ.convert_map_from(S); m
Conversion map:
  From: Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in a over Rational Field with modulus x^2 + 1
  To:   Integer Ring
```
This map simply ends up calling `ZZ._element_constructor_(<argument>)`, which fails.

So the difference seems to be whether an `_integer_` method is available on the elements.
