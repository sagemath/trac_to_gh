Here we clean methods related to planarity: `is_planar`, `is_circular_planar`, `layout_planar`, `is_drawn_free_of_edge_crossings`, `genus`, `crossing_number`, `faces`, `num_faces`, `planar_dual`.
- PEP8 cleaning
- avoid using `.edges`, or use `.edges(sort=False)`

Not done:
- `set_planar_positions`: it is written inside the method: `This method is deprecated since Sage-4.4.1.alpha2. Please use instead `.layout`. However, there is no clear deprecation warning. We can either add a proper deprecation warning and remove it in 1 year, or simply remove it as it has been marked as deprecated for so many years... A specific ticket is needed anyway.
