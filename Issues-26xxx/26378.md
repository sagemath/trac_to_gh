CC:  anna haensch

```
sage: Q = QuadraticForm(Matrix(ZZ,2,[2,1,1,2]))
sage: Q.conway_mass()
....
TypeError: unable to convert sqrt(1/144) to a rational
```
The correct result is 1/12.

The method seems to fail in dimension 6 as well for example for the E6 lattice.

I tested this against a few thousand lattices of determiants <= 400 in dimensions <= 6 against magma. The answers agree. Thank you so much Frédéric :-).
