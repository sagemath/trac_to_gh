They come from python.org (e.g., https://docs.python.org/3/objects.inv), and they contain links to python.org. I'm sure the Python people have some autogeneration for them, but I don't know how we would do that. 

See http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html#confval-intersphinx_mapping for how we could use the links if we assumed internet access. (I think being able to build without internet access is valuable and I am not suggesting changing that – I am including this link if you want to figure out what is in the files and if there is any way we could generate them ourselves.) As noted on that Sphinx page, you can also run

```
./sage --python -msphinx.ext.intersphinx src/doc/common/python.inv
```
to see the intersphinx mapping provided by that file.

I believe for the `.inv` files the usual approach is for them to be generated and distributed by the relevant projects' maintainers.  So for the ones from Python the correct approach is to download them and include our own copies of them if necessary.

I think this approach looks good for now.
