Explicitly set the default `language_level` for the `cython()` to that of the currently running Python version. This is needed because Cython 0.29 will warn if no `language_level` is given.

It makes sense to use `language_level=3` when running Sage on Python 3 to have the user's Cython code run more consistently with the user's Python code. By keeping `language_level=2` on Python 2, this is not a breaking change.

This would mean

1) check that sage still builds with python3 with this branch applied. If not, I would not agree with the ticket.

2) check that the number of failing modules and doctests does not grow. If it grows or explodes, I would be rather unhappy. There is a script on #26212 that can extract the data from a doctest log.

Instructions for building sage with python3 are at the bottom of
