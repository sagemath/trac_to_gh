-1 on going through an essentially trivial `_element_constructor_` in internal code that should give valid output. At the very least, you should not run the checks when constructing objects from internal code.

I am also a little skeptical of this change:

```diff
-        if isinstance(word, DyckWord) and word.parent() is self:
+        D = DyckWords_all()
+        if isinstance(word, DyckWord) and word.parent() is D:
             return word
-        return self.element_class(self, list(word))
+        return D.element_class(D, word)
```
`_element_constructor_` should return an element of ``self`` as these are not façade parents. (Actually, the first check here can be removed because the coercion framework would have already caught that case before it got to the `_element_constructor_`.)

Given this change, I am very nervous about the resulting parent of the Dyck path. I suspect you are doing this because `ClonableList` also includes the parent in the check and you are subsequently forcing everything to be elements of the `DyckWords_all` to have comparisons work. This is bad practice and can mask a host of other subtle issues, especially when mixing façade parents with code that is making a parent act like a façade parent.

This looks like a bug to me:

```diff
                 sage: DyckWords().height_poset().an_element()   # indirect doctest
-                [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
+                [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
```

This is something that we need to discuss in relation with set factories. The idea of those is to allow the user to change the class and parent on an enumerating algorithm. Here you hardcoded the class and the parent. I strongly disagree with that. I'm using  `_element_constructor_` as a single entry point to allows for customisation.
 
> `_element_constructor_` should return an element of ``self`` as these are not façade parents. (Actually, the first check here can be removed because the coercion framework would have already caught that case before it got to the `_element_constructor_`.)


Again this is something that shoul'nt be hard coded.

> I suspect you are doing this because `ClonableList` also includes the parent in the check and you are subsequently forcing everything to be elements of the `DyckWords_all` to have comparisons work. 


I'm not doing anything particular with parent for comparison that following the standard `element.__richcmp__` mechanism which compare the parent or use a coercion mechanism to ensure that the elements have the same parent. It seem that you decided to change this overall policy for some particular combinatorial objects which confuses me. 

> This is bad practice and can mask a host of other subtle issues, especially when mixing façade parents with code that is making a parent act like a façade parent. 


Any examples ?
