-1 on going through an essentially trivial `_element_constructor_` in internal code that should give valid output. At the very least, you should not run the checks when constructing objects from internal code.

I am also a little skeptical of this change:

```diff
-        if isinstance(word, DyckWord) and word.parent() is self:
+        D = DyckWords_all()
+        if isinstance(word, DyckWord) and word.parent() is D:
             return word
-        return self.element_class(self, list(word))
+        return D.element_class(D, word)
```
`_element_constructor_` should return an element of ``self`` as these are not façade parents. (Actually, the first check here can be removed because the coercion framework would have already caught that case before it got to the `_element_constructor_`.)

Given this change, I am very nervous about the resulting parent of the Dyck path. I suspect you are doing this because `ClonableList` also includes the parent in the check and you are subsequently forcing everything to be elements of the `DyckWords_all` to have comparisons work. This is bad practice and can mask a host of other subtle issues, especially when mixing façade parents with code that is making a parent act like a façade parent.

This looks like a bug to me:

```diff
                 sage: DyckWords().height_poset().an_element()   # indirect doctest
-                [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
+                [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Again this is something that shoul'nt be hard coded.

> I suspect you are doing this because `ClonableList` also includes the parent in the check and you are subsequently forcing everything to be elements of the `DyckWords_all` to have comparisons work. 

I'm not doing anything particular with parent for comparison that following the standard `element.__richcmp__` mechanism which compare the parent or use a coercion mechanism to ensure that the elements have the same parent. It seem that you decided to change this overall policy for some particular combinatorial objects which confuses me. 

> This is bad practice and can mask a host of other subtle issues, especially when mixing façade parents with code that is making a parent act like a façade parent. 

Any examples ?
