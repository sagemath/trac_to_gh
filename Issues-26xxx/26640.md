This ticket is used to keep track of the progress towards python3 in graphs.


**Major issues**
- #22349 Deprecate sorting of methods `.vertices()` and `.edges()`
- direct comparison of vertex labels (e.g., in method `iterator_edges` of `base/sparse_graph.pyx`)
- methods using matrices: `adjacency_matrix`, `distance_matrix`, etc. For all these methods, we can now give as input an ordering of the vertices (and edges) that will be used to order rows and columns. Currently, we use `.vertices()` and `.edges()` by default. If we switch to `list(G)` by default, we have to check that it's not breaking algorithms using these matrices.


**Needs work**:
- #22349 	Deprecate sorting of Graph vertices and edges by default

**Needs review**:
- #27408 	Edge view for graphs -- introduce deprecation warning for `sort=None` as the plan is to set `sort=False` by default.
- #27513 	Allow custom order for edges as well as vertices for incidence matrix

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:4'></a>\nI'm answering here the question of [ticket:26567#comment:9 #26567#comment:9] about how to make `iterator_edges` of `sparse_graph.pyx` py3 compatible, and if something similar to #26567 for `dense_graph.pyx` can be done for `sparse_graph.pyx`.\n\nSo far, I don't know what's the best option.\n- just stop ordering end vertices of edges as well as vertices in general, but it shall break many algorithms\n- change the way we use graphs to ensure that internally vertices are all integers, and then use method `get_vertex_label` (that we already have but rarely use) only when the user wants to display lists of vertices/edges. I think networkx is now doing something like that.\n- try to mimic the py2 sorting using try... except statements, but this might induce some slowdown.\n- maintain an ordering of the vertices and a mapping  from vertices to integers used when sorting list of vertices and the end vertices of edges. This ordering could be updated at vertex insertion/deletion time.\n\nAll these options have pros and cons, and each of them will require a significant amount of work to fix doctests and algorithms. \n\nIn the last months, we did significant progresses on reducing the dependency on ordering, but this is not enough and this central issue is very complex to fix. Which is the best option in the short/long term ?",

<a id='comment:4'></a>
I'm answering here the question of [ticket:26567#comment:9 #26567#comment:9] about how to make `iterator_edges` of `sparse_graph.pyx` py3 compatible, and if something similar to #26567 for `dense_graph.pyx` can be done for `sparse_graph.pyx`.

So far, I don't know what's the best option.
- just stop ordering end vertices of edges as well as vertices in general, but it shall break many algorithms
- change the way we use graphs to ensure that internally vertices are all integers, and then use method `get_vertex_label` (that we already have but rarely use) only when the user wants to display lists of vertices/edges. I think networkx is now doing something like that.
- try to mimic the py2 sorting using try... except statements, but this might induce some slowdown.
- maintain an ordering of the vertices and a mapping  from vertices to integers used when sorting list of vertices and the end vertices of edges. This ordering could be updated at vertex insertion/deletion time.

All these options have pros and cons, and each of them will require a significant amount of work to fix doctests and algorithms. 

In the last months, we did significant progresses on reducing the dependency on ordering, but this is not enough and this central issue is very complex to fix. Which is the best option in the short/long term ?

May I ask in which ticket, if any, you do touch the "is_isomorphic" method ?

I would really like this to work with python 3:

```python
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_edge((1,'a'))
sage: G
Graph on 2 vertices
sage: G.is_isomorphic(G)
```

I would like to ask some questions about how to deal with simplicial complexes.

- The `is_isomorphic` method for simplicial complexes translates each complex to a graph and then asks whether they are isomorphic, preserving edge labels. Some edges are labeled and some are not: the edge labels look like

```
sage: g.edge_labels()
[None,
 None,
 'special_edge',
 'special_edge']
```
 This fails in Python 3 because it tries to sort edges, and it can't sort `str` and `NoneType`. It is easy enough to provide labels in this case, but should the graph `is_isomorphic` method deal well with graphs where some edges have labels and some don't? (I don't have an opinion and I will fix the simplicial complex code separately.)

- Again with the `is_isomorphic` method for simplicial complexes: it defines a graph with vertices labeled by the vertices of the complex and its facets, and it adds an edge between a vertex `v` and a facet `f` if `v` is in `f`. The graph code tries to sort the vertices, and since the vertices in a simplicial complex can be integers, strings, whatever, the sorting goes badly. Again, I think I can handle this for simplicial complexes by translating everything to something sortable, then sorting, and then translating back at the end, but should the graph `is_isomorphic` method handle these sorts of cases better?

- Consider this:

```
sage: S1 = simplicial_complexes.Sphere(1)
sage: g = S1.wedge(S1).graph()
sage: g
Graph on 5 vertices
sage: g.vertices()
[0, 'L1', 'L2', 'R1', 'R2']
```
 In Python 3, the last line instead raises an error:

```

<a id='comment:59'></a>
We have now drastically reduced the dependency to `.vertices()` and `.edges()` in the graph module (except in doctests, but we can specify `sort=True/False`). 

We must now identify the tasks to do and schedule the work.

Some issues to take care of in the graph module:
- #22349 Deprecate sorting of methods `.vertices()` and `.edges()`.
  - methods using matrices: `adjacency_matrix`, `distance_matrix`, etc. For all these methods, we can now give as input an ordering of the vertices that will be used to order rows and columns. Currently, we use `.vertices()` by default. If we switch to `list(G)` by default, we have to check that it's not breaking algorithms using these matrices.
  - methods using `.relabel()`. We must check that changing the default ordering of vertices/edges is safe. Should be ok, but we never know...
  - methods for isomorphisms were we also have issues with labels (see e.g. #27232 although the case is certainly beyond what we should reasonably do).
- Deprecate sorting of vertex labels in method `iterator_edges` of `base/sparse_graph.pyx` (so of the vertices of an edge). Deprecating this behavior is certainly a hard task. A first step could be to order the vertices according internal integer value, thus ensuring that `(u, v)` will always be ordered the same way.

And of course, changes done here will certainly break many methods in other modules...

I don't know if this is a good idea or not, but see #27452 for a branch which fixes the last doctest failures in src/homology. This bypasses an issue with graphs, as mentioned above:

```
sage: S1 = simplicial_complexes.Sphere(1)
sage: g = S1.wedge(S1).graph()
sage: g
Graph on 5 vertices
sage: g.vertices()
...
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'
```
The branch at #27452 relabels the graph of a simplicial complex so that the vertices are sortable, before trying to compute its minimal spanning tree. Is this just sweeping things under the rug, or is it okay?

My gut reaction was that seems heavy handed. It would make sense, but I suspect the reason we don't is because it would be too expensive (relatively) to return a `(Di)Graph`. I haven't looked into this (it is too late for me to do so tonight), but just a thought.

All doctests in the standard graphs module are now fixed ! Thanks to all of you for your great help.

We can now check all optional packages. For instance, `plantri` has 2 failing doctests (#28108).
