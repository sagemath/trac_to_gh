sage 8.4beta0 fails to compile on my cygwin, even after a distclean, because "ld: cannot find -lzn_poly". This happens at the sagelib compilation stage (zn_poly itself seems to have installed correctly; at least sage doesn't let me install it again):

```

Reverting #25085 fixes the bug on my machine.

**Update:** I have taken over maintenance (to be clear maintenance only, not development) of zn_poly in a new upstream repository: https://gitlab.com/sagemath/zn_poly  It includes all previous patches from Sage and I will creating a new release tarball based on that.

**Upstream tarball:** https://trac.sagemath.org/raw-attachment/ticket/26050/zn_poly-0.9.1.tar.gz

+
+**Update:** I have taken over maintenance (to be clear maintenance only, not development) of zn_poly in a new upstream repository: https://gitlab.com/sagemath/zn_poly  It includes all previous patches from Sage and I will creating a new release tarball based on that.

+**Upstream tarball:** https://trac.sagemath.org/raw-attachment/ticket/26050/zn_poly-0.9.1.tar.gz

<a id='comment:8'></a>New upstream tarball for an 0.9.1 release candidate based on https://gitlab.com/sagemath/zn_poly  

If this works in Sage then I'll "release" it for real.

The new tarball has all the previous patches from Sage applied, and few other changes besides that.  It also contains improved Cygwin build support so this remains a blocker for fixing the Cygwin build.

That doesn't see like a good thing to do. What if there happens to be a major upgrade? A less-bad-but-still-major-hack way to do this might be to touch all of the Cython files so they will be forced to be rebuilt and link against the new library.

I agree that all of these files should just be rebuilt because the dependency changed. Maybe there is a bug somewhere in the build system?

<a id='comment:32'></a>I think I see what you're saying here, and I admit I'm not 100% sure if it's the best way to go either.  I'm being inspired partially by https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html, though the exact file naming scheme is not the same (for now) as Debian prescribes.

There the convention is generally that the *actual* .so file has the full library version in the filename (this allows multiple versions to be installed simultaneously, in principle.  Then there is usually at least once.  Then there's a symlink that is named the same as the library's SONAME, pointing to the real file.  Finally in some cases (but not all) there is a symlink that's just `libwhatever.so` with no version.

For example on my Debian system I have:

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       16 May 29  2017 libtiff.so -> libtiff.so.5.2.0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       16 May 29  2017 libtiff.so.5 -> libtiff.so.5.2.0
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   467208 May 29  2017 libtiff.so.5.2.0
```

Though for most libs there's no `libfoo.so`; usually just `libfoo.so.<ABI version>`.  I don't know why that's the case.

In this case for zn_poly what I have is:

```
libzn_poly-0.9.1.so  (where 0.9.1 is the library version)
libzn_poly-0.9.so -> libzn_poly-0.9.1.so (where in this case I'm saying 0.9 is just the ABI version--in a future release I will probably change this to just "1")
libzn_poly.so -> libzn_poly-0.9.1.so  (generic libzn_poly without version info)
```

So I think this makes sense, but is it "right"? I'm not really sure.  I plan to redo it later anyways when it's not as urgent :)

Why?  That doesn't make a lot of sense.  At the very least, shouldn't there be a couple of testing mirrors that the buildbots can be pointed to, rather that ones used for releases?

What do I need to do here?  This issue not only blocks Cygwin builds, it is also preventing the Cygwin patchbot from proceeding.

You can look at the commit log on the fork, but that's mainly it, modulo a few other minor build changes.

So since that is done and sage and arch already ship 0.9.1, can you add the tag now?

If you build without running the \"tune\" program it just uses some default tunings from David Harvey's own machine from god-knows-when, so it's arbitrary either way.\n\n\nThats good to know. I thought it may depend on some particular hardware aspects after tuning.\nOne other reason against always tuning is binary reproducibilty.

Thats good to know. I thought it may depend on some particular hardware aspects after tuning.
One other reason against always tuning is binary reproducibilty. I don't know if that is a goal
of SAGE_FAT_BINARY, but at least thats the reason why I still disable tuning on nix.

In this case it doesn't result in machine-specific code.  I don't fully understand how this code works to be honest, but my vague understanding is that it implements a number of different algorithms that may work at different speeds on different machines, and it adjusts how many times to run each algorithm to converge on the best solution the most efficiently.  Something to that effect... *waves hands*

I don't know if that's a goal for SAGE_FAT_BINARY either.  That might be something to bring up on the mailing list.  But yes, for binary reproducibility you'll want to disable tuning, so now (as document) the way to do that is to run `./configure --disable-tuning`.

Binary reproducibility is probably overkill for `SAGE_FAT_BINARY`, so it should be fine as-is. Thanks for the clarification.
