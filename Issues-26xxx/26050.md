sage 8.4beta0 fails to compile on my cygwin, even after a distclean, because "ld: cannot find -lzn_poly". This happens at the sagelib compilation stage (zn_poly itself seems to have installed correctly; at least sage doesn't let me install it again):

Reverting #25085 fixes the bug on my machine.

**Update:** I have taken over maintenance (to be clear maintenance only, not development) of zn_poly in a new upstream repository: https://gitlab.com/sagemath/zn_poly  It includes all previous patches from Sage and I will creating a new release tarball based on that.

Thanks, I'll look into it.  I think I see what the problem might be.

It seems the `-soname` flag for GNU `ld` has no impact on the DLL name used in DLL export sections, only the actual output filename.

Does anyone know the most recent status of zn_poly?  According to http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~davidharvey/code/zn_poly/ it is "no longer maintained".  Should we just make a new upstream repo for it and become its maintainers?

New upstream tarball for an 0.9.1 release candidate based on https://gitlab.com/sagemath/zn_poly  

If this works in Sage then I'll "release" it for real.

The new tarball has all the previous patches from Sage applied, and few other changes besides that.  It also contains improved Cygwin build support so this remains a blocker for fixing the Cygwin build.

Perhaps I'll just modify it so that the soname still uses "0.9" instead of "0.9.1".  After all, the ABI is identical so there's no reason to change it.

But really Sage should just be rebuilt.  It lists zn_poly as a dependency, but there's no mechanism to recompile/link all modules that depend on a library that changed...

That doesn't see like a good thing to do. What if there happens to be a major upgrade? A less-bad-but-still-major-hack way to do this might be to touch all of the Cython files so they will be forced to be rebuilt and link against the new library.

I agree that all of these files should just be rebuilt because the dependency changed. Maybe there is a bug somewhere in the build system?

I think I see what you're saying here, and I admit I'm not 100% sure if it's the best way to go either.  I'm being inspired partially by https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html, though the exact file naming scheme is not the same (for now) as Debian prescribes.

There the convention is generally that the *actual* .so file has the full library version in the filename (this allows multiple versions to be installed simultaneously, in principle.  Then there is usually at least once.  Then there's a symlink that is named the same as the library's SONAME, pointing to the real file.  Finally in some cases (but not all) there is a symlink that's just `libwhatever.so` with no version.

For example on my Debian system I have:

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       16 May 29  2017 libtiff.so -> libtiff.so.5.2.0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       16 May 29  2017 libtiff.so.5 -> libtiff.so.5.2.0
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   467208 May 29  2017 libtiff.so.5.2.0
```

Though for most libs there's no `libfoo.so`; usually just `libfoo.so.<ABI version>`.  I don't know why that's the case.

In this case for zn_poly what I have is:

```
libzn_poly-0.9.1.so  (where 0.9.1 is the library version)
libzn_poly-0.9.so -> libzn_poly-0.9.1.so (where in this case I'm saying 0.9 is just the ABI version--in a future release I will probably change this to just "1")
libzn_poly.so -> libzn_poly-0.9.1.so  (generic libzn_poly without version info)
```

So I think this makes sense, but is it "right"? I'm not really sure.  I plan to redo it later anyways when it's not as urgent :)

The mirrors don't update instantaneously, rather it takes some number of days that is up to the mirror admin. In the meantime everybody will download stale tarballs from the mirrors, note that the checksum does not match, and fail to build.

I can update the tarball on the mirror and then you wait until **all** mirrors have updated if you prefer.

Why?  That doesn't make a lot of sense.  At the very least, shouldn't there be a couple of testing mirrors that the buildbots can be pointed to, rather that ones used for releases?

What do I need to do here?  This issue not only blocks Cygwin builds, it is also preventing the Cygwin patchbot from proceeding.

Yes. It says elsewhere here that I'll tag the new release after this ticket is approved (which it looks like it has been) since testing it against sage's buildbots was the best way to test it.

> And what are the differences between 0.9 and 0.9.1? Did you just apply all the sage patches?

You can look at the commit log on the fork, but that's mainly it, modulo a few other minor build changes.

I intend to redo the build system for this package, but it's low priority as long a the existing one is "working".

TBH I'm not sure it much matters.  If you build without running the "tune" program it just uses some default tunings from David Harvey's own machine from god-knows-when, so it's arbitrary either way.

If I had the time and inclination I would redesign it to be able to read the tunings from a file rather than hard-coded, so the tuning program can be re-run on individual machines without having to recompile.  IIUC how the tuning program works, there's no deep reason it couldn't be done this way.

Thats good to know. I thought it may depend on some particular hardware aspects after tuning.
One other reason against always tuning is binary reproducibilty. I don't know if that is a goal
of SAGE_FAT_BINARY, but at least thats the reason why I still disable tuning on nix.
