This sort can fail if the points are not comparable:

```
                sortkey = lambda e: [(0 if x is None else 2 if isinstance(x, str) else 1, x) for x in e]\
                    if isinstance(e, tuple) else e
                self._points = sorted(points, key=sortkey)
```

The `sortkey` tries to find a clever way to "sort" the points but hardcoding classes like that is not a general solution. In particular, it's still comparing integers and strings when #22029 is appplied.

Instead, just don't sort.

A mix of points of strings type and integers type will not make this function fail. 

This work in python3:

```
>>> (1, 3) < (2, 'a string')
True
```

The comparison stops if the first element of each tuple are different.

Apparently, it does. See the patchbot report on #22029. I have not looked at the details.
