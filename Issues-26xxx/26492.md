As discussed on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43946/desolve-initial-condition-involving-e-gives-strange-answer/):

```
sage: x == e
e == x
sage: x > e
e < x
sage: x <= e
e >= x
```

Note that it only happens with `e`, this constant is handled in the dedicated `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/symbolic/constants_c.pyx`.

This does not happen with the symbolic expression `e`:

```
sage: x == e*1
x == e
sage: x > e*1
x > e
sage: x <= e*1
x <= e
```


Depends on #18077

The reason is that `constant_E` is a subclass. When Python sees `a < b` where `type(b)` is a strict subclass of `type(a)`, it instead evaluates `b > a`.

So this gives us basically the following options:

1. Consider this not a bug and move on.

2. Ensure that `type(e)` is the same as `type(x)`.

3. Ensure that `type(e)` and `type(x)` are both subtypes of a common subclass.

The problem comes from #26490, so in this case, we should do more parsing to replace lines such as `tempic=tempic+","+(dvar==ics[1])._maxima_().str()` to something that hardcodes maxima's "=" symbol. Also, from a user perspective, one could program something with `rhs` and `lhs` and  get confused when such unexpected case appears.

> 2. Ensure that `type(e)` is the same as `type(x)`.

Would replacing

```
e = E()
```

with

```
e = E() * 1
```

in `SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/symbolic/constants.py` be considered as a correct fix ?

> 3. Ensure that `type(e)` and `type(x)` are both subtypes of a common subclass.

If you want to do that, then why do we need the `constant_E` class in the first place? My guess is that it's mainly for documentation, such that `e?` gives information about `e` as opposed to generic expressions.

To elaborate on this: for arithmetic operators like `__add__`, there is a reversed version like `__radd__`. But the reversed version of `__le__` is just `__gt__`. So user code cannot make a difference between `a < b` and `b > a`.
