Here, we clean (PEP8 and avoid `.vertices` / `.edges`) methods:
- searches: `breadth_first_search`, `depth_first_search` (`lex_BFS` is done in #26630)
- constructors: `add_clique`, `add_cycle`, `add_path`, `complement`, `to_simple`, `disjoint_union`, `cartesian_product`, `tensor_product`, `lexicographic_product`, `strong_product`, `disjunctive_product` (methods `transitive_...` are done in #26634)

<a id='comment:2'></a>The changes are breaking the construction of `graphs.EllinghamHorton54Graph()`, but so far I don't understand what's going on.

In method `union`, if, instead of 

```diff
-        G.add_vertices(self.vertices())
-        G.add_vertices(other.vertices())
-        G.add_edges(self.edges())
-        G.add_edges(other.edges())
+        G.add_vertices(self)
+        G.add_vertices(other)
+        G.add_edges(self.edge_iterator())
+        G.add_edges(other.edge_iterator())
```
I let the line `G.add_vertices(other.vertices())`, I don't have errors anymore O_o

Any suggestion on possible cause of this issue?

<a id='comment:3'></a>My understanding is the following.
- `graphs.EllinghamHorton54Graph()` uses twice `disjoint_union`, and makes assumption on the name of vertices after each operation
- `disjoint_union` relabels the vertices of the graphs according the ordering `list(G)`, and then calls `union`.
- When adding vertices in the graph `G` resulting from the union of `self` and `other`, the order in which vertices are added to `G` fixes the ordering `list(G)`. So, a later call to `disjoint_union`, that relabels the graphs using the ordering `list(G)` might result in a different result.
So, either we decide that the proposed changes, avoiding to use `.vertices()`, is ok and then I have to update method `EllinghamHorton54Graph` according the new ordering, or it is not ok and we must let `G.add_vertices(self.vertices())` and `G.add_vertices(other.vertices())` in `union`.

In my opinion, the current situation in which `disjoint_union` relies on the ordering `list(G)` and `union` relies on the ordering `G.vertices()` is not good.

I can open a specific ticket if needed.

             sage: if product_size != expected:

```
I am not sure why raising a ValueError would be better here ? \\
And to begin with the message has little value.
In similar cases i think we usually do something like: 

```
sage: product_size == expected
True
```
This comment is more a question and not a blocking point.

Some pep8 comments :
- 1. Multiple space after keyword :
line 17058 `if (neighbors is None and not isinstance(start, list) and  distance is None`
- 2. Blank line contains whitespace: l 17465.
- 3. Missing whitespace after ',' : 
l 17890 `G.add_vertices((u,v) for u in self for v in other)`\\

l 17972 `G.add_vertices((u,v) ...`\\

l 18043 `G.add_vertices((u,v) ...`
