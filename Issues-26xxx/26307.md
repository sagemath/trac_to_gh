One other comment, I think `language` should return a set instead of a list. It is better to let the translation from set to list be done by the user if he needs to.

```diff
- return list(L)
+ return L
```

Often, one wants to test containment and it will be stupid that the user have to do `set(m.language(1000))`.

Agreed. Though `w.factor_set()` returns a "Sage set" and not a Python set... this is not so nice.
