Miraculously this works for the curve that is currently doctested `37a`, 

The issue is that elliptic curves don't like to be base changed to bad primes, however for the purposes of sieving this is fine. So elliptic curves need to be convinced they are just curves for the purposes of sieving for points.

Precisely

```
Curve(E).rational_points(bound=5)
```

works even when `E.rational_points(bound=5)` does not. Not sure if a change should be made to elliptic curves (to have a special rational_points method, or to the generic sieving code to first change the input to a rather generic type of scheme. I like the former more as the latter causes friction if people want to add special methods that speed up base_change or whatever.

You need to get the keyword 'F' before it can be used.

Maybe change the last example to

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,0])
sage: E.rational_points(F=QuadraticField(-1))
```
so an error like this shows up.
