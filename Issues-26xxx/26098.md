<a id='comment:5'></a>Good idea! It's something that I always wanted to do but never found the time...

Some immediate comments:

1. Regarding

```
"""
Dokchitser's L-functions Calculator from Pari

AUTHORS:

- Tim Dokchitser (2002): original PARI code and algorithm (and the
  documentation below is based on Dokchitser's docs).

- William Stein (2006-03-08): Sage interface

"""
```

To what extent is this related to code from Dokchitser or Stein? If the answer is "not at all", then the author block, the copyright block, the name of the module and the name of the class `Dokchitser_Pari` should be fixed.

2. Assigning `self.pari = Pari()` looks strange as there is really one PARI running. Better be honest about that and use a single global `pari` variable (you can import it from `sage.libs.pari`).

3. `self.pari('default(realprecision, %s)')` is a bad idea for multiple reasons. The proper way to deal with precisions in library mode is either to set the precision argument for every function call or to use inexact inputs.

4. Avoid using global PARI variables like in the `pari_precode` example `tau(n)=...`. Remember that there is only one global PARI instance, so global variables are global state! If you want functions, why not use actual functions (using the `->` syntax)?

There are Dokchitser's algorithms (described in a famous article in Experimental Math) and Dokchitser's implementation of them (that we use so far). Pari is using (maybe an enhanced version of) the algorithms of Dokchitser or at least similar basic ideas.

Every function where precision matters takes a `precision` argument. For example

```
sage: pari(1).sin(precision=64).sage()
0.841470984807896507
sage: pari(1).sin(precision=256).sage()
0.8414709848078965066525023216302989996225630607983710656727517099919104043912

```
sage: from sage.lfunctions.lfunctions_pari import lfun_generic, LFunction
sage: lf = lfun_generic(conductor=1, gammaV=[0,1], weight=12, eps=1)
sage: tau = pari('n->(5*sigma(n,3)+7*sigma(n,5))*n/12 - 35*sum(k=1,n-1,(6*k-4*(n

All this works, or seems to. But here is the traceback.

Sure, done.

>    2. The docstring for delta_lseries is surely wrong: only one of the options interfaces with the (soon to be obsolete?) code of Tim Dok.  And why is the default not the new pari version?  Same for Dedekind Zeta.


Fixed the docstring of delta_lseries

Concerning the switch to "pari" by default, maybe this new interface is not yet mature enough.

But this is already the case, I think.

<a id='comment:96'></a>Can we please try to move on here ? This seems to me to be a progress over the current situation, even if a tiny one.

I think one can keep `init_coeffs` as a public method, to be used as explained:

```
+        Initialisation of a :pari:`lfun` from motivic data.
+
+        This can happen either in one stage or in two stages: the coefficients
+        can be given using the ``init`` keyword, or entered using
+        the :meth:`init_coeffs`.
```

There remains something not very clear about the handling of poles and residues.

I would like to get more feedback from lmfdb or pari people.

<a id='comment:0'></a>Sorry for taking time to get back to this.

I do not quite understand the necessity of the `init_coeffs` method. I feel like there would be more standard ways to refactor that out (for example, just allowing initialization as normal). Or is this meant to be something done more lazily? You could also remove the `__init` attribute by just setting `self._L = None` in the `__init__` and checking against that.

A little bit better doc formatting IMO:

```diff
-    Create a PARI `L`-function (:pari:`lfun` instance) with
+    Create a PARI `L`-function (:pari:`lfun` instance) with::
 
-    ``lfun_generic(conductor, gammaV, weight, eps, poles, residues, init)``
+        lfun_generic(conductor, gammaV, weight, eps, poles, residues, init)
```

This seems dubious to me:

```python
    values_on_gens = (chi(x) for x in pari_gens)

    # now compute the input for pari (list of exponents)
    P = chi.parent()
    if is_ComplexField(P.base_ring()):
        zeta = P.zeta()
        zeta_argument = zeta.argument()
        v = [int(round(x.argument() / zeta_argument))
             for x in values_on_gens()]   # <<<---- This part here
    else:
        dlog = P._zeta_dlog
        v = [dlog[x] for x in values_on_gens]
```
with `value_on_gens` being a generator object, I don't think it should be callable.

`check_functional_equation` could use some more standard docstring formatting.

Otherwise everything else LGTM. A lot of these points I do not care about too much (since I doubt I will ever use this code because it is outside my research area), but I still feel it is worth a quick moment of thought.
