There is still two remaining problems :

- I temporary used `sleep(float(0.5))` to fix a doctest but it can't be a good solution. The problem is using `sleep(0.5)` doesn't pause the thread 500 ms with python3 :

```
sage: time sleep(0.5)
CPU times: user 48 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 48 µs
Wall time: 52.2 µs
sage: time sleep(1)
CPU times: user 468 µs, sys: 8 µs, total: 476 µs
Wall time: 1 s
```

Does somebody knows if there is a ticket related to this problem or if i should open a new one ?

- In pexpect.py the doctest 

```
sage: w = walltime(t); w > 0.4 and w < 10
True
```
fails in python3 because the walltime is shorter than 0.4. I don't know why it should be considered as an error or if it is expected with python3 for some reason.

I know, i hesitated between the two syntax and, as it is an `EXAMPLES::`, have think that the `# py2`-`# py3` syntax might be clearer for the end-user.

I don't have a strong opinion on it, tell me what you prefer. If the past cases you talk about are also `EXAMPLES::` we should stick with the `decode('ascii')` solution for consistency.

Yes, I think consistency is best.  There are a few other cases that also, rather than relying on the `repr`, just do like

```
sage: E.read() == b'Hello\r\n'
True
```

or whatever.  This will also work the same on Python 2 and 3.

I have thought of adding a helper to the test framework to deal with `b`-prefixed strings as it does with `u`-strings, but it turns out they are relatively uncommon in the majority of the test suite.

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A17):
> probably you do not need the initial `u` that you add to some doctests.

I think it is needed because on Python 2 `.decode(...)` will return a unicode string literal, and the doctest parser *does* treat this as relevant on Python 2.  The only thing it does w.r.t. u-prefixes is on Python 3 it strips them from the expected output.

I usually avoid the issue by using `print(...)` instead, but i think this is fine as-is.
