With #25382 and #26423 (patched so that it actually applies), Sphinx can almost build the Sage documentation. There are two issues: Sphinx itself produces an error:

```
[dochtml] [reference] Exception occurred:
[dochtml] [reference]   File "/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/PYTHON3/sage-8.4.rc0/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sphinx/search/__init__.py", line 174, in loads
[dochtml] [reference]     if not data or not s.startswith(self.PREFIX) or not \
[dochtml] [reference] TypeError: startswith first arg must be bytes or a tuple of bytes, not str
```
We can patch Sphinx to fix this, or maybe we are passing bad data to Sphinx.

(Second issue moved to a separate ticket, #26522.)

This branch fixes the problem that Sphinx complains about: in Sphinx's file `search/__init__.py`, it seems to assume that data the search index file is a string, not bytes. It looks like ordinary text to me, so let's open it using `'r'` instead of `'rb'`.

The second problem is distinct. I will move it to another ticket.
