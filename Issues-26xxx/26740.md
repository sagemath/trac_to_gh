As a distro with sage installed for python2 and python3 do I have to run something like `S{sage-python3} -t --python3 --long`, but not `--all`, to run the appropriate doctests?

There is no reason for you to worry at all. It has no effect on the distro side, as far as I can tell.

This introduces a new option "--python3" when running the doctests. Maybe a better name would be "--python3only" or "--python3-valid-modules-only".

The only effect of using this option is to select a pre-defined list of modules whose doctests will be launched.

If you use the option with sage2, it will just test those files.

If you use this option with sage3, exactly the same.

The crop in your comment just doctests that this option exists and works. It does not launch the associated behaviour.

The goal of this ticket is to allow our release manager to have a builtbot that checks that no regression happens, namely that once a module is ok for python3, it will be checked to remain so.

I have attached the list of failing files in 8.5.b5. This is the result of a patchbot run, so it was done with "--long" but not using any other optional option.

**EDIT**:
There is a script attached to #26212 that takes a patchbot log and extract useful information, including the list of failing modules.

I thought I made this point elsewhere, but should add your patch could be implemented as a file like `python3-known-passing.txt`:

```

```

```
$ cat python3-known-passing.txt | xargs ./sage -t --long -p
