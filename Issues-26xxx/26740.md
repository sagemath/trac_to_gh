As a distro with sage installed for python2 and python3 do I have to run something like `S{sage-python3} -t --python3 --long`, but not `--all`, to run the appropriate doctests?

There is no reason for you to worry at all. It has no effect on the distro side, as far as I can tell.

This introduces a new option "--python3" when running the doctests. Maybe a better name would be "--python3only" or "--python3-valid-modules-only".

The only effect of using this option is to select a pre-defined list of modules whose doctests will be launched.

If you use the option with sage2, it will just test those files.

If you use this option with sage3, exactly the same.

The crop in your comment just doctests that this option exists and works. It does not launch the associated behaviour.

The goal of this ticket is to allow our release manager to have a builtbot that checks that no regression happens, namely that once a module is ok for python3, it will be checked to remain so.

All that's required is to remove the "python 3" specific stuff, and change that option to be able to read a list of filenames/directories (possibly optionally from a file as well).  We could even add a file listing known Python 3 failures to the repository which I wouldn't mind, but it's silly to hard-code this when a few small changes can upgrade it to a more generally useful feature that won't just have to be ripped out later when it becomes obsolete.
