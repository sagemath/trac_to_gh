`bootstrap` runs `build/bin/sage-download-file`, but since #18438 this has `sage-system-python` in its shebang line, which is not in the path by default.

This can be fixed by putting `$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin` explicitly on the `$PATH`.

Bootstrap still fails; I force download with

```
$ git clean -f -d -x
$ ./bootstrap -D
rm -rf config configure build/make/Makefile-auto.in
./bootstrap: line 61: sage-download-file: command not found
Error: downloading configure-282.tar.gz failed
```
The problem is that `SAGE_ROOT` isn't actually set to anything...
