`bootstrap` runs `build/bin/sage-download-file`, but since #18438 this has `sage-system-python` in its shebang line, which is not in the path by default.

This can be fixed by putting `$SAGE_ROOT/build/bin` explicitly on the `$PATH`.

I'm inclined to agree, but I'm not positive either.  Is there any one would ever want to set SAGE_ROOT to a different path here, e.g. with mind towards building in a separate directory from source (e.g. VPATH style, although with VPATH builds I think it still assumes `configure` is in the source directory).

I think it's an ancient, long obsolete use-case. Note that `configure` unconditionally sets SAGE_ROOT, so let's match that.

definitely don't need for VPATH.
