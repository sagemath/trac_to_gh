Implement the random chordal graphs generator proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13326
It is based on the intersection graph of randomly selected subtrees of a random tree. 3 strategies are proposed for the selection of the subtrees.

It is written in the paper that "the algorithm is able to generate every chordal graph with positive probability", but the generator is not uniform.

I do not want to expose these as part of the API via the global namespace, but it is available here:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_generators.html

That is all I want to do, to make these functions part of the API via the documentation. So it is sufficient to just remove the `_`.

<a id='comment:18'></a>I this commit, I'm trying to add the helper method to the doc of `graph_generators`, but the html output is (no compilation error):

```
sage.graphs.graph_generators.pruned_tree
staticmethod(function) -> method

Convert a function to be a static method.

A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. To declare a static method, use this idiom:

class C:
@staticmethod def f(arg1, arg2, …):

…
It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance (e.g. C().f()). The instance is ignored except for its class.

Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++. For a more advanced concept, see the classmethod builtin.
```
Any help to properly include the helper methods is more than welcome :P
