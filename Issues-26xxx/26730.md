Implement the random chordal graphs generator proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13326
It is based on the intersection graph of randomly selected subtrees of a random tree. 3 strategies are proposed for the selection of the subtrees.

It is written in the paper that "the algorithm is able to generate every chordal graph with positive probability", but the generator is not uniform.

`ALGORITHM` is not like `.. NOTE::`, so you should just go

```
def foo():
    """
    1-line.

    ALGORITHM:

    The algorithm goes here.

    EXAMPLES:

        sage: foo()
    """
```

Is it worthwhile to have those extra sanity checks in the hidden functions `_growing_subtrees`, `_connecting_nodes`, and `_pruned_tree`? Since they are not part of the API, I think it is safe(r) to assume valid input. Although I guess these methods you're also doing input sanitizing, so maybe it is okay. Perhaps these should not be hidden (and hence, shown in the documentation)?

Also you probably do not want to use things from `math`. I think is better to do, e.g., `Integer(n).log(2)` because of overflow and maybe numerical instability.

LGTM otherwise.

I do not want to expose these as part of the API via the global namespace, but it is available here:

I this commit, I'm trying to add the helper method to the doc of `graph_generators`, but the html output is (no compilation error):

```
sage.graphs.graph_generators.pruned_tree
staticmethod(function) -> method

Convert a function to be a static method.

A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. To declare a static method, use this idiom:

class C:
@staticmethod def f(arg1, arg2, …):

…
It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance (e.g. C().f()). The instance is ignored except for its class.

Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++. For a more advanced concept, see the classmethod builtin.
```
Any help to properly include the helper methods is more than welcome :P
