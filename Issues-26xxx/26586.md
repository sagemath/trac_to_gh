**python remark**:
I think there is a bad copy-paste line 15709.

```
        if not self.has_vertex(u):
            raise ValueError("vertex '{}' is not in the (di)graph".format(u))
        if not self.has_vertex(u):
            raise ValueError("vertex '{}' is not in the (di)graph".format(u))

**pep8 remarks**:
- 1. Missing whitespace around operator:
l 15278: `s=start`
- 2. At least two spaces before inline comment:
l 15289: `s = next(act_path_iter[-1]) # try to get the next neighbor/successor, ...`\\
