<a id='comment:4'></a>The tests block of method `__call__` contains:

```
            sage: from sage.misc.callable_dict import CallableDict
            sage: from sage.combinat.words.morphism import CallableDict
```
is it to show that it is possible to import from different places or is it just a mistake ?
