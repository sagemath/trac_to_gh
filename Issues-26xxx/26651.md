<a id='comment:4'></a>
The tests block of method `__call__` contains:

```
            sage: from sage.misc.callable_dict import CallableDict
            sage: from sage.combinat.words.morphism import CallableDict
```
is it to show that it is possible to import from different places or is it just a mistake ?

If the goal is to show that it can be imported from different places with doctests, maybe a more explicit code will be better. For example :

```
sage: from sage.misc.callable_dict import CallableDict as CDict
sage: d1 = CDict({1: 'a', 3: 'b', 2: 'c'})
sage: from sage.combinat.words.morphism import CallableDict
sage: d2 = CallableDict({1: 'a', 3: 'b', 2: 'c'})
sage: d1 == d2
True
