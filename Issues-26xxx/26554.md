I have corrected the doctests, but it would be good if someone could check that the results are effectively correct. I have no doubt in `src/sage/matroids/utilities.py` as the output of a test taking as input the changed matrix is unchanged. I have more difficulty with `simplicial_complex`...

The changes to `simplicial_complex.py` are trivially equivalent (same presentation of groups except for the generator names). I am very mildly worried that the output may not always be consistent, but since we are in such early beta stages, I think getting this in and testing it will be the best way.

John, I am cc-ing you to also note this ticket in case we do start seeing random failures in `simplicial_complex.py`.
