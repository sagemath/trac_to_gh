Reviewers should look at the built documentation to catch reST errors that don't stop the build but cause the docs to looks bad. One example: using ``some_code`` for source code instead of ```some_code``` – single quotes cause the contents to be set in math mode, and then the underscore will cause a subscript, which is probably not what was intended.
