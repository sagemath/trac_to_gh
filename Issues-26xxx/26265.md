sage: CBF(-4).add_error(1e-40).sqrt()
[+/- 1.01e-20] + [+/- 2.01]*I
```

The problem is that we're right along the branch cut for square root, but it has the unfortunate effect of magnifying the error enormously (and the center of the ball becomes 0, which is not a good approximation to either square root).

At a minimum, we should allow a choice of branch cut in square root.

Here's a suggestion for the default behavior, though I'm worried about adjusting the branch cut depending on the input.

* If the ball contains 0+0i, the current behavior is fine.
* Otherwise, if the center of the ball has non-negative real part, use the current behavior.
* Otherwise, use a branch cut along the positive real axis.

The behavior will only differ in the third quadrant (where we would now choose the opposite square root).  Along the negative real axis we get the nice behavior of getting balls along the positive imaginary axis.  We would have a discontinuity along the negative imaginary axis based on the center of the ball.

I'm not going to make this suggestion to Arb until getting feedback on this idea of adaptively changing the branch cut.

**Upstream:** None of the above - read trac for reasoning.

Quoting from the IEEE TC Arb paper:

It would be tempting to pick an arbitrary branch, e.g. that of the midpoint, to avoid the discontinuity. However, this would break formulas where the same branch choice is assumed in two subexpressions and rounding perturbations could place the midpoints on different sides of the cut.

It is up to the user to rewrite formulas to avoid branch cuts when preserving continuity is necessary. For example, to compute both square roots of a complex number (in undefined order), one can use (sqrt(z), -sqrt(z)) if re(mid(z)) >= 0 and (i sqrt(-z), -i sqrt(-z)) if re(mid(z)) < 0.
