Something about this still smells off.  For example:

```diff
@@ -3595,14 +3595,14 @@ boolean
 
 EXAMPLES::
 
-    sage: S = Sandpile({'a':[1,'b'], 'b':[1,'a'], 1:['a']},'a')
-    sage: c = SandpileConfig(S, {'b':1, 1:2})
+    sage: S = Sandpile({'a':['c','b'], 'b':['c','a'], 'c':['a']},'a')
+    sage: c = SandpileConfig(S, {'b':1, 'c':2})
     sage: c
-    {1: 2, 'b': 1}
+    {'c': 2, 'b': 1}
```

I'm not sure that last change is always going to be correct.  If `c` were a dict it would be pretty-printed with its keys sorted.  I haven't looked at `SandpileConfig` but it should probably do the same.

Unfortunately not: The problem is that since this is being repr'd like a dict, the output order is completely arbitrary, and this ticket is just changing it to a different arbitrary order that is not guaranteed to be the same between Python versions or even platforms.

If you give me a sec, I think I have a solution...

Well, `sage -c` is different because it doesn't load the REPL, but it does `import sage.all`.  However, I still *usually* get:

```
$ ./sage -c 'import sys; print("IPython" in sys.modules)'
False
```

This might be in part because `sage.sandpiles` is lazy-imported.

For some odd reason though, immediately after a `./sage -b` I get:

```
$ ./sage -c 'import sys; print("IPython" in sys.modules)'
True
```

But then not thereafter. Something must change immediately after a re-build that somehow triggers IPython from being imported.

Thanks.  It's still a good point you raise though: Merely importing those modules shouldn't cause `IPython` to be imported if it can be avoided (e.g. it's pointless to do so if we're not in IPython).

I'll open a ticket for that.

Ugh, so it's using this:

```
def _sorted_for_pprint(items):
    """
    Sort the given items for pretty printing. Since some predictable
    sorting is better than no sorting at all, we sort on the string
    representation if normal sorting fails.
    """
    items = list(items)
    try:
        return sorted(items)
    except Exception:
        try:
            return sorted(items, key=str)
        except Exception:
            return items
```

Ironically this will give more-or-less deterministic results on Python 3 (<3.7, where it relies on built-in dict ordering), but non-deterministic results on Python 2 where `sorted(items)` will not raise an exception, and instead rely on Python 2's crappy fallback ordering which is not deterministic.

This might explain some other tests that expect dicts in their output, but where we've struggled to get consistent results across platforms.  I'll look into fixing this.
