Unfortunately not: The problem is that since this is being repr'd like a dict, the output order is completely arbitrary, and this ticket is just changing it to a different arbitrary order that is not guaranteed to be the same between Python versions or even platforms.

If you give me a sec, I think I have a solution...

<a id='comment:47'></a>Ugh, so it's using this:

```
def _sorted_for_pprint(items):
    """
    Sort the given items for pretty printing. Since some predictable
    sorting is better than no sorting at all, we sort on the string
    representation if normal sorting fails.
    """
    items = list(items)
    try:
        return sorted(items)
    except Exception:
        try:
            return sorted(items, key=str)
        except Exception:
            return items
```

Ironically this will give more-or-less deterministic results on Python 3 (<3.7, where it relies on built-in dict ordering), but non-deterministic results on Python 2 where `sorted(items)` will not raise an exception, and instead rely on Python 2's crappy fallback ordering which is not deterministic.

This might explain some other tests that expect dicts in their output, but where we've struggled to get consistent results across platforms.  I'll look into fixing this.
