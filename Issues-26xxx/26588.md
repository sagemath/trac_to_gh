LGTM, thanks.

`kwds` are now passed on the element during construction.

>   1. L297: `__abs__` returns the Python int 1. (Fixed via 980825c561)


```
sage: type(exp(QQ(0)))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
so I've changed it to have the same behavior.

>   1. I wanted to have some additional doctests where normalization is involved (c3d5c15f47).


LGTM

Done.

LGTM

Needs small cross review of changes.

```
sage: i = CIF(I)

I don't understand why this needs to fail while, according to a very similar test a few lines above, `J(3*CBF(i))` is supposed to succeed.

After #28517, `J(3*CIF(i))` would return 3*I as well. Is that acceptable?

Thanks!
