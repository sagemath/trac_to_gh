Uploading all remaining `sage.modules` fixes from my Python 3 branch.

This is a bit diverse but I think it's a small enough set of fixes to be grouped together.  Also fixes some Python 2 bugs that were sort of left as "known failures".

<a id='comment:6'></a>Two things from a very quick lookover:

The `iter` here seems pointless as the result is an iterator:

```
return iter(self._entries.iteritems())
```

In Cython, you can still use `iteritems` on a `dict` in Python3 (from what Jeroen as said in the past). So this change should not be needed:

```diff
                 e = entries_dict
                 entries_dict = {}
                 try:
-                    for k, x in e.iteritems():
+                    for k, x in e.items():
                         x = coefficient_ring(x)
                         if x:
                             entries_dict[k] = x

<a id='comment:10'></a>I guess on Python3, Cython just considers `iteritems` as a replacement for `items` and gives the view.

Now feel free to call me paranoid, but I am a little worried about the extra indirection by defining the `_on_basis` method. Since that forms the key part of the code and can be called very frequently, it could have some significant impact:

```
sage: from sage.modules.with_basis.morphism import ModuleMorphismFromMatrix
....: X = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, [1,2]); X.rename("X"); x = X.basis()
....: Y = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, [3,4]); Y.rename("Y"); y = Y.basis()
....: m = matrix([[1, 2], [3, 5]])
....: phi = ModuleMorphismFromMatrix(matrix=m, domain=X, codomain=Y, side="right")
....: 
sage: %timeit phi(X.an_element())
The slowest run took 36.14 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.91 µs per loop
```
vs your branch

```
sage: %timeit phi(X.an_element())
The slowest run took 25.64 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.32 µs per loop
```
which is around a 10% slowdown. So I am not sure this is the best way forward as the pickling problem might be better addressed with a custom `__reduce__` method. How much of those changes are necessary for Python3?

Yes, I think it should. These get used all over the place in things like the combinatorial Hopf algebra code. Although it may not have been done previously because of stuff with the category framework, multiple inheritance, concerns about increased debugging difficult, or just a previous lack of interest.

I think that is a bad way to look at it. I would say it should be more like you are passing a function as input, which then gets called as part of the computation.

<a id='comment:20'></a>One last little thing:

```diff
-                    for k, x in e.iteritems():
+                    for k, x in e.items():
```
Since `e` is a `dict` in a Cython file, I think it would be better to do

```diff
-                    for k, x in e.iteritems():
+                    for k, x in (<dict> e).iteritems():
```
Once changed (or if you don't think it is a good idea), then you can set a positive review.

Why this?  `e` is already declared `cdef dict` earlier in the method, so I'm not sure why you would want to add `<dict> e` here?

Because I missed it being defined. `>_<` Oh well, it doesn't really hurt anything by being there.
