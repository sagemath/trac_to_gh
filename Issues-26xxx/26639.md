We have a lot of lists that don't need to be lists in `geometry/cone.py`, potentially slowing things down and wasting a bit of memory. This is especially prevalent in my own doctests (oops).

Two things should help:

1. Use generator expressions instead of list comprehensions when we're merely iterating over things.
2. Use `xrange`-type iterators instead of `range()` lists. This is complicated only by the fact that `xrange()` isn't future-proof with respect to python-3.x.

To address my previous concern, the failure in comment 2 was due to an implementation detail that we need to be aware of. When I write,

```
LL_K1 = ( M1(x.list()) for x in K1.dual().lyapunov_like_basis() )
LL_K2 = ( M2(x.list()) for x in K2.lyapunov_like_basis() )
tps_gen = ( s.tensor_product(x) for x in LL_K1 for s in LL_K2 )
```

where `LL_K1` and `LL_K2` are generators (as opposed to lists) python will loop through the inner iterator multiple times for every item in the outer iterator. That doesn't work: the inner iterator is exhausted the first time around, and returns nothing for outer iterations 2, 3, etc.

So the situations we need to watch out for are:

1. Don't return an iterator anywhere that we used to return a list  (in case anyone is using the result in a nested loop).

2. Don't turn two lists into generator expressions if they're later going to be used in a nested loop.

I've looked through the rest of the changes and don't think I made the same mistake anywhere else.
