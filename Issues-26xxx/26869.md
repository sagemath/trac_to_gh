The current implementation of `is_aperiodic` uses networkx and it yields an error in Python3 (due to a deprecation warning).

As we have method `period` that computes the period of a digraph, it suffices to check whether the period is 1 or not. This way, we don't pay the conversion to networkx anymore, and we avoid the failing doctests in `digraph.py` and in `static_sparse_graph.pyx` (calls `is_aperiodic`).

How does the timing compare between the two methods? I am inclined to still accept this change, but I am a little curious how things compare.

The example is maybe too small, but without this patch:

```
sage: g = DiGraph({0: [1, 4], 1: [2], 2: [0], 4: [0]})
sage: %timeit g.is_aperiodic()
The slowest run took 7.37 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 56 µs per loop
```
With this patch

```
sage: g = DiGraph({0: [1, 4], 1: [2], 2: [0], 4: [0]})
sage: %timeit g.is_aperiodic()
The slowest run took 4.61 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 31 µs per loop
```
In fact, the `period` is very similar to the one in networkx. So we save the conversion to networkx.
