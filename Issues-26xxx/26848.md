This ticket is independent from #26522.  This just fixes a small problem toward building the complete sage documentation. With this ticket, at least `make doc` finishes successfully. This would facilitate solving other (big) problems like your #26522.

Moreover as far as I can see, a solution of #26522 would not fix what this ticket solves, contrary to your belief. It seems to me that the problem of #26522 is related with Sphinx autodoc extension specialized for Sage...

It might finish without error, but I would not agree that it finishes successfully: the built documents are missing huge chunks.

A solution to #26522 would mean that no parts of the documentation are omitted, so cross-references would resolve correctly. That would solve the problem in this ticket, as I explained above.

I once again checked that it finishes without error with the patch.

> but I would not agree that it finishes successfully: the built documents are missing huge chunks.


True.

> > Moreover as far as I can see, a solution of #26522 would not fix what this ticket solves, contrary to your belief. 


I withdraw my assertion. #26522 would also make `make doc` work. But a merit of this ticket is to relocate the documentation for facade sets to a better place.

> A solution to #26522 would mean that no parts of the documentation are omitted, so cross-references would resolve correctly. 


I agree. But I still believe this ticket has its own merits, independent from #26522.
