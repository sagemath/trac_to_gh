The problem with facade sets is a symptom, not the actual problem. Compare the Python 2 and 3 builds of the reference manual for `reference/categories/sage/categories/sets_cat.html`, for example (which you get to by choosing "Categories" in the main reference manual index, and then "Sets"). With Python 2, the documentation for the class `Sets` includes various subclasses and methods (for example, [`an_element`](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/categories/sage/categories/sets_cat.html#sage.categories.sets_cat.Sets.ParentMethods.an_element)), while with Python 3 with your branch, all of that is missing: it only includes the top-level docstring. This is the reason that, without your branch, the reference to facade-sets is broken: that part of the documentation is omitted in the Python 3 build, so the reference (naturally) can't be found.

This is being discussed at #26522, and that's where we should focus attempts to fix this problem.

This ticket is independent from #26522.  This just fixes a small problem toward building the complete sage documentation. With this ticket, at least `make doc` finishes successfully. This would facilitate solving other (big) problems like your #26522.

Moreover as far as I can see, a solution of #26522 would not fix what this ticket solves, contrary to your belief. It seems to me that the problem of #26522 is related with Sphinx autodoc extension specialized for Sage...

It might finish without error, but I would not agree that it finishes successfully: the built documents are missing huge chunks.

A solution to #26522 would mean that no parts of the documentation are omitted, so cross-references would resolve correctly. That would solve the problem in this ticket, as I explained above.

I once again checked that it finishes without error with the patch.

True.

> > Moreover as far as I can see, a solution of #26522 would not fix what this ticket solves, contrary to your belief. 

I withdraw my assertion. #26522 would also make `make doc` work. But a merit of this ticket is to relocate the documentation for facade sets to a better place.

> A solution to #26522 would mean that no parts of the documentation are omitted, so cross-references would resolve correctly. 

I agree. But I still believe this ticket has its own merits, independent from #26522.
