So, it is more like that: do not mix things that cannot be sorted inside the set underlying a set partition.

If we stick with this assumption, we can essentially assume that the ground set is 1,...,n.  In particular, notions such as crossings and nestings make sense.

There was an effort to remove this assumption, introducing `AbstractSetPartition`.  I am not sure whether this is worth it, however.

I think we should keep the current implementation: Let the methods error out when the `SetPartition` is not on `[n]`. For permutations, this makes more sense to have a special class for "standard" permutations (speed and the essentially ubiquity of `{1,...,n}`). However, this creates a fair bit of extra maintenance burden.

TL;DR I think we should avoid forcing the ground set to be `[n]`.

My opinion would be to instead do this change:

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hi Travis!

So, would you (just as I would) vote for removing `AbstractSetPartition` again?

I admit I am confused about would you would prefer:

1) a single implementation of set partitions, with arbitrary, possibly non-sortable ground set.  Some methods may return nonsense, some methods may yield an error.

2) a single implementation of set partitions, with arbitrary, possibly non-sortable ground set.  Methods may yield an error, but will not return nonsense.  I believe that this is hard to achieve, when we want to keep speed.

3) it seems that you (and me also) do not like the current state, which is an incomplete split between sortable and non-sortable ground set.

I am certainly not saying that we should have only set partitions on `[n]`.

Yes, I do. This abstraction is useful for the diagram algebras. The number of uses (as long as it is more than one) is not a good reason for removal. It also is not really a big maintenance burden. So -1, still.

I don't mind.  What's the second use of `AbstractSetPartition`?

Can we go ahead with your proposal in this ticket?

<a id='comment:18'></a>I just realised that I already said that equality of set partitions cannot work 

```
sage: n=4; s = [frozenset([2*i, 2*i+1]) for i in range(n)]
sage: p1 = SetPartition([[s[0]], [s[1]]])
sage: p2 = SetPartition([[s[1]], [s[0]]])
sage: p1 == p2
False
```

Therefore I think that having an error raised when the base set is not totally ordered is actually much better.  (I do realise that the example above won't give an error in python3, but at least we shouldn't make matters worse.)

If really desired, generalising set partitions to non-totally ordered sets should go into another ticket, so I'd like to set this to positive review.
