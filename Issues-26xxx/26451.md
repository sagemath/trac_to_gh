I was fearing that you would propose that ;)

I am not planning on working on upgrading Sphinx in Sage (as I've got too many other things to worry about.) I don't know what has chahnged in 1.8.1 and whether we would want to upgrade at all.

More generally, I don't know what we're aiming for here. I feel we don't have enough people to keep Sage-the-distribution close to upstream most of the time so that's probably not what we should be aiming for?

That said, feel free to upgrade Sphinx :) But if anybody likes these small changes and we want to move the Sphinx upgrade into a separate ticket, I would prefer that.

```
Indeed, `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/_static` is a file, not a directory: it is the file `graphviz.css` from Sphinx. If I delete it, create a directory `_static`, and run `make` again, then only `graphviz.css` is copied to the directory, so the reference manual is missing all of its css files. The other parts of the documentation look good.

That's very helpful, thank you, but it leads to my next problem: with that fix applied, `graphviz.css` is still copied to `local/share/doc/sage/inventory/en/reference/_static/`, and there is no reason to copy css files to the inventory build. As a consequence, I see this error:

```

I think intersphinx looks in every subdirectory of `inventory/en/reference/`, including `_static`, which should not be there.

The following tickets mentioned in the discussion above are now fixed and closed,

- #26449 Sphinx and the Python 3 build of Sage
- #26453 Relicense sphinxify.py
- #26558 doc-pdf fails due to conflict with new babel.sty

The following pull request to Sphinx was merged on 2018-10-28,

- [Sphinx issue 5549: Correctly deal with non-existing static dir in graphviz extension](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/5549)

and finally

- Sphinx 1.8.2 was uploaded to PyPI on 2018-11-11.

Is this comment from the ticket description still a problem with Sphinx 1.8.2?

Based on the diff, I'm willing to give this ticket the benefit of the doubt. I cannot say that I understand everything but there is nothing obviously bad.

I haven't actually built the documentation yet, I'll do that next.

Manually adding those lines fixes the problem, but they should be there automatically.

I tried to replace src/doc/common/themes/sageref with a symlink to src/doc/common/themes/sage, but this did not change the result (no TeX in reference manual).

Could it be some special parallel hack that breaks it? I really have no idea.

I think the issue is that in the new Sphinx, `sphinx.ext.mathjax` has the line

```
    app.connect('env-check-consistency', install_mathjax)
```
As far as I can tell, this means that those lines should be produced when `self.env.check_consistency()` is run, but it doesn't get run during the reference/html build. I'm guessing this is because of our multidocs extension, or maybe the sage_autodoc extension.

Why wasn't the `sage:` prompt patch necessary before?

On nixos with this patch applied I get some kind of unicode issue (not sure if its 100% reproducible; I think I've seen it working some time):

```

I don't know if this has to do with some different dependency on nix or if it could also happen on sage-the-distro.

Because the file being patched didn't exist before.

I don't see this with sage-the-distro. The file `doc/common/conf.py` had its doctests changed recently in another ticket (to fix Python 3 issues, I think). This branch doesn't touch that file, and I don't see why it would be related.

Instead of adding this very sage specific patch to sphinx, why not do this in a sphinx extension?

There is a balance to be struck: we're more or less forking Sphinx with extensions like this, so they require maintenance: as Sphinx changes, so should the extension. This recently required a fair amount of work for Sage's autodoc extension (#26949).

So is it better to patch Sphinx or create an extension?

Here is a different approach for the `<BLANKLINE>` problem, as suggested [on Sphinx's github page](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/6188). I've added a dependency, #27528, which also removes `highlighting.patch`. It is necessary here because it suppresses some warnings which are produced by `SageMathTransform`.

If this is acceptable, we should probably squash some commits: we don't need to create `trim_doctest_flags.py` and then delete it.
