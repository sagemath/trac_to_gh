Replying to [@dcoudert](#comment%3A7):
> Also OK on py2 and py3 ;) However, instead of using `(-1, -1)`, one could define a variable `sink = (-1, -1)` for clarity. I will not fight for it.

Followup ticket when the whole module gets a cleaning.

> I noticed that the sandpile code contains a lot of calls to `.vertices()` and `.edges()`, including a `.vertices()[0]`. So multiple improvements are possible. Also, some random graphs generators could be in `digraph_generators.py` instead of `sandpile.py`. Other tickets are needed.

Yea, it is old code IIRC that has not been really maintained for quite some time.
