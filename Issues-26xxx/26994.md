Starting from somewhere around 8.5.beta the canonical labels given by Sage and bliss are different on some instances

```
sage: G1 = Graph("Cr")
sage: G2 = Graph("C]")
sage: G1 == G2
False
sage: G1.is_isomorphic(G2) and G2.is_isomorphic(G1)
True
sage: G1.canonical_label(algorithm='bliss') == G1
True
sage: G1.canonical_label(algorithm='sage') == G2
True
```
That is `Cr` is canonical for bliss while `C]` is canonical for Sage... More examples:
- 4 vertices: `C`` vs `CK`, `CR` vs `CL` and `Cr` vs `C]`
- 5 vertices: `DGC` vs `D`@`O`, `DAK` vs `D`@`S`, `DC[` vs `D`@`s`, `DIK` vs `DBW`, `DD[` vs `DBk`, `DDW` vs `DBg`, `D`{` vs `DK{`, `DqK` vs `DLo`, `DMk` vs `Dbk`, `DR{` vs `DL{`, `DR[` vs `DJk`, `Dr{` vs `D]{`



As a consequence, when bliss is installed, we have the two following doctest failures in `databases/sql_db.py`.

The graph6 strings `Cr` and `C]` indeed corresponds to graphs on 4 vertices (isomorphic but not equal)

```
sage: G1 = Graph("Cr")
sage: G2 = Graph("C]")
sage: G1 == G2
False
sage: G1.is_isomorphic(G2) and G2.is_isomorphic(G1)
True
```
Still on [SageMath](SageMath) 8.6.beta0 the canonical labeling is `Cr`

```
sage: G1.canonical_label() == G1 and G2.canonical_label() == G1
True
```
Hence the code in the doctest should have been added `Cr` in the database and not `C]` as it is currently written.

<a id='comment:10'></a>
The canonical label of a graph depends on the algorithm used to compute it. See the note in the documentation of `canonical_label`: Make sure you always compare canonical forms obtained by the same algorithm.

So a simple fix is to force `algorithm='sage'` in the doctest.
