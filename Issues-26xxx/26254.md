```
In requests for help for cythonized built-in methods, the signature of the method is not shown, unlike normal python methods.  For an example,

```
sage: a=17 
sage: a.quo_rem?

Docstring:     
   Returns the quotient and the remainder of self divided by other.
   Note that the remainder returned is always either zero or of the
   same sign as other.

   INPUT:

   * "other" - the divisor

   OUTPUT:

   * "q" - the quotient of self/other

   * "r" - the remainder of self/other

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: z = Integer(231)
      sage: z.quo_rem(2)
      (115, 1)
...
``` 

To fix this, we set Cython directive `binding=True`. Thus we buy

- better support of introspection into cython methods, 
- consistent help messages for cython methods like python methods, 
- better tracebacks on exceptions, 
- better behaving for documentation

for slight performance degradation due to increased overhead cost of calling cython methods.

It seems this file

https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/oinspect.py

is responsible for this issue. For me, it would take some time to scrutinize what this does though.

It turns out that the problem is with `IPython.core.oinspect.inspector._get_def`, which calls Python's `inspect.signature` via `IPython.utils.signatures` module. 

This problem is nothing to do with `sage_getargspec`.

Right. 

I don't remember exactly what I meant in my last comment. Perhaps I expected Cython someday support the new signature module shipped with Python 3. Now I don't have any clear idea what should be done on what side.

`[].insert?` shows correct signature. So built-in methods can behave well with respect to introspection. Then why cythonized built-in methods do not? How can we make cythonized built-in methos behave well like standard built-in methods of python?

An answer can be found here:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1104823/python-c-extension-method-signatures-for-documentation/1104893

and

https://docs.python.org/3/howto/clinic.html

Now it seems to me that cython should do a better job in making cythonized built-ins more introspectable.

Yes, the solution is to use binding=True to enable use of cyfunctions.  However, using cyfunctions across the board can introduce a significant performance penalty in many cases, as the Python interpreter has some built-in optimizations for built-in functions that don't work for cyfunctions.

Jeroen has been fighting for a series of PEPs that would overhaul Python's function type hierarchy in such a way that the basic `function` type can be extended (e.g. as with Cython's `cyfunction`) while still keeping those optimizations working.

So while this seems like it should be an easy problem to solve, it's completely non-trivial.

Point being, let's not duplicate effort here.

I searched for these PEPs, and reached to

- PEP 590: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0590/

- PEP 579: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0579/

I am curious if and how theses PEPs would eventually solve the problem of this ticket. I only guess that after the PEPs made into CPython, Cython is updated to use the new CPython features, and then the signature issue in Sage is automatically fixed. Am I right?

That's correct--this would allow us to use Cython's own `function` subclass, which includes support for better signature documentation among other things, without losing any performance.

From:

```
... When enabled, functions will bind to an instance when looked up as a class attribute
```

I don't know what triggers the binding behaviour, but I imagine there may be a code path that runs into this and perhaps ends up not binding anyway (thus creating overhead) or ends up binding in a way that was previously done in a more efficient way (cached perhaps?)

The timings above show the impact can be quite significant: I think too high a penalty to incur in general. Note that the documentation also says:

```
Changed in version 3.0.0: Default changed from False to True
```

so figuring out what's causing the slowdown is a prereq to upgrading to 3.0.0 (once that finally is released). If there's a particular scenario where it's bad to have binding, we might just be able to turn it off in those cases.

What's the status here? The performance issues don't seem to be too bad, especially since they apparently only affect certain functions/modules.

Binding=true is also required for #30884 since the decorator library internally uses inspection on the decorated function. So if one wants to decorate cython functions, then they have to be "bound".

I tried to investigate this is a bit, but didn't get far.

With bindings=true, the `expression.cpp` file contains the new lines

```
...
static PyMethodDef __pyx_mdef_4sage_8symbolic_10expression_121call_registered_function = {"call_registered_function", (PyCFunction)(void*)(PyCFunctionWithKeywords)__pyx_pw_4sage_8symbolic_10expression_121call_registered_function, METH_VARARGS|METH_KEYWORDS, __pyx_doc_4sage_8symbolic_10expression_120call_registered_function};

However, it no longer contains

};
```
which are present with `bindings=false`. 
Maybe its related to https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1658.

After replacing `expression.cpp` with the one from `develop` everything seems to work fine.

Does anyone has an idea how to properly fix this? I tried setting `bindings=false` for `expression.pyx`, but then the compilation doesn't succeed anymore.

Attachment [Screenshot 2022-05-08 133226.jpg](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket26254/1d8ed967d25d8bbc67b847cde2cf4aa8.jpg) by @tobiasdiez created at 2022-05-08 11:37:46

I tried to track down the source of the following errors:

```
      File "/__w/sagetrac-mirror/sagetrac-mirror/src/sage/repl/display/pretty_print.py", line 144, in pretty
        ok = representation(obj, self, cycle)
      File "/__w/sagetrac-mirror/sagetrac-mirror/src/sage/repl/display/fancy_repr.py", line 348, in __call__
        ascii_art_repr = ascii_art_repr or o.parent()._repr_option('element_ascii_art')
    IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

Debugging the following test script

```
import sage.all
from sage.combinat.root_system.cartan_type import CartanType
from sage.repl.rich_output import pretty_print


C = CartanType(["A", 3, 1])


class MyCartanType:
    def my_method(self):
        return "I am here!"


C._add_abstract_superclass(MyCartanType)
pretty_print(C.__class__)
# <class 'sage.combinat.root_system.type_A_affine.CartanType_with_superclass_with_superclass'>
pretty_print(C.__class__.__bases__)
# This triggers the index error, but should print
# (<class 'sage.combinat.root_system.type_A_affine.CartanType_with_superclass'>,
#    <class ...__main__.MyCartanType...>)
```

leads to the following output in `fancy_repr.py`, line 348:
![]( Screenshot 2022-05-08 133226.jpg)

For some reason calling `parent` throws the IndexError. The python debugger doesn't give more insights, and I have no experience with cython debugging to see where the indexerror is thrown. So it would be nice if someone with more cython experience can take this from here.

It seems that cython fails to import the function `call_registered_function` from `sage.symbolic.expression` via the `src/sage/symbolic/pynac_function_impl.pxi` file, where it is defined. I am not sure if we could regard this as a bug of cython as `.pxi` files are not supposed to contain function definitions. I wonder why it is moved there in the first place. Anyway I think we should ask to cython community about this first before we refactor our code.

According to the answer, there was a circular import that somehow was hidden but revealed only with `binding=True`. Hence I think changing global imports to local imports are the right solution.

Note that with `binding=False`:

```
class NewClass:
    def parent(self):
        return 1

NewClass.parent()
...
TypeError: parent() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'
```

```
%%cython
cdef class NewClass:
    def parent(self):
        return 1

NewClass.parent()
...
TypeError: unbound method NewClass.parent() needs an argument
```

With `binding=True`:

```
%%cython
cimport cython
@cython.binding(True)
cdef class NewClass:
    def parent(self):
        return 1

NewClass.parent()
...
IndexError: tuple index out of range

NewClass.parent(2)
1
```

In the latter, `NewClass` is of course not an object but a class, hence `NewClass.parent()` invokes unbound method `.parent` which is a cython function that thinks it is bound. Hence it tries to get "self" from its dictionary of arguments. As the dictionary is empty, it raises `IndexError`. I think this is a bug of cython. It should raise `TypeError` as it should follow Python behavior.

Now I think we should regard this 1% as our debt (it was not ours), or as something to pay to get proper introspection to cython functions, which weighs more than the 1%.  

Perhaps we may selectively turn on "binding=False" for some cython functions critical for performance.

That Cython 3 adopts binding=True as default is promising, but perhaps we need to have some (however coarse) data on the performance effect on the overall sage library before we proceed.

John, if you experimented with the branch to check performance, would you share what you observed? 

We may ask more developers to experiment with the branch for their favorite part of the sage library and collect their reports. Or could we write a script to do that automatically? What do you think? 

Depending on the collected data, in the worst case (abhorring personally :), we may go with binding=False even with Cython 3.

I did some statistics on the timings data:

- -1.115 percent point increase (yes minus!) in wall timings over all doctested files.

- 0.049 percent point increase in wall timings over only doctested files that have increased wall timings.

The unexpected negative value makes me suspect the validity of the raw data. I attached stats.ipynb that I used.

Please do your own tests. Perhaps you may make stats more reliable and more significant.

OK, I think the following illustrates what we're contending with here.

```cython
%%cython
cimport cython
@cython.binding(False)
cdef class Unbinding:
    def test(self):
        return 1
@cython.binding(True)
cdef class Binding:
    def test(self):
        return 1

def fetch_test(a, N=100):
    for i in range(N):
        _ = a.test

def call_test(a, N=100):
    for i in range(N):
        _ = a.test()
```
With this we find:

```
sage: U=Unbinding()
....: B=Binding()
sage: %timeit fetch_test(U,100000)
2.95 ms ± 37.8 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: %timeit fetch_test(B,100000)
2.67 ms ± 31.6 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: %timeit call_test(U,100000)
3.52 ms ± 44.7 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
sage: %timeit call_test(B,100000)
4.71 ms ± 99 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
```
As you can see, fetching the binding method is actually a slight bit faster, but actually calling it takes considerably more time (and of the timings here it is the one that fluctuate most between different tests where the cython classes are compiled fresh).

So in tests where calling really cheap methods is dominant [perhaps some part of the coercion framework?] this can have quite an adverse effect. Interestingly, just fetching the method is not much of a problem.

replacing `test` by `__hash__` in the tests above gives similar timings to the `B` case, so it seems that `cython` has previously outperforming method-calls and with `Binding=True` brings performance down to standard python built-in methods.

I think with `binding=True` we're supposed to get a call-frame on the stack, so constructing that would cost a bit more.

That first one seems unduly long (already the "before" time). The second one could be the right ballpark, making that possibly a good candidate to select some doctests from and profile them both before and after to see which routines end up eating more time.

To some extent, `lwe.py` could be a good test case (if the times hold up) since the code there, as well as the doctests, don't seem to be particularly written to just test very cheap cython routine calls: the code may well end up doing that by itself. That would be pretty damning, because then any other code out there that follows similar patterns will be very negatively affected.

{

I agree that there is a not-so-small variance in the timings of running doctests. But still the experiments make me believe that

- Some part of the sage library runs slower with `biding=True`
- Other part of the sage library runs faster with `binding=True` (this surprised me, but Nils provided a possible explanation)
- In average, there is about 5% performance loss with `binding=True`.

Thus before we ask sage users to accept the performance loss for all benefits of `binding=True`, we need to identify and analyze the part of sage library with performance loss and think about ways to reduce the loss (perhaps just by adding `@cython.binding(False)` to methods with no real need of introspection..).

Then the performance loss shown in the doctests test is mostly contributed by small cython files whose doctests spend time mainly in running such accessor functions. The result in [comment:100](#comment%3A100) seems in sync with the theory. Note that "excluding files with doctest timings less than 1 second," the average performance loss is about 1%. 

We may say that for a typical sage user, who spend time (much longer than 1 second) in running functions far from those simple accessor functions, the experienced performance loss would be negligible.

Accessor functions to entries of an object, like coefficients of matrices or polynomials would likely be used in a tight loop. So they are easy targets to recover. For example

There are lots of such internal methods. If we include `_repr_` and `_latex_`, then perhaps all pyx files would be included. So before we start doing this systematically, let us discuss how to do it.

- Do we exclude non-crucial methods like `_repr_` and `_latex_`? Then what else are? Or we include them all?

what's not clear about it? If `cython_binding=True` leads to performance degradation on some methods, then it should be possible for the user to turn them off. Such methods should be decorated with `@cython.binding(parm)` with `parm` somehow divined from the value passed to

Or it's unclear to you how to implement it?

I don't think `_xxx` is necessarily a good indicator of the cost of the call. When that routine is producing a string, for instance (like `__repr__`) the string allocation and assembly likely takes much more time than the call.

A routine like `matrix.nrows()` on the other hand is about as cheap as it gets and that's not an underscored method.

Preliminary timings there suggest the problem disappears with cython 3. So it would be instructive to check if the problem above persists in sage with an upgraded cython. If not, then we can just close this ticket and not do anything!

I'd say wait for Cython 3 and, in the mean time, use ​0c78cdf for development work if you're testing for the consequences of `binding=True`. Or perhaps just make that change manually if you want a debugging session with more details.

In any case, the branch here as it is shouldn't be merged: its net effect is an addition of 1 line (which can be reverted when cython 3 is merged). Rebase the ​0c78cdf branch instead (or perhaps just  force push it to the ticket) There's no need to pollute the change history with an incredible amount of line-addition-then-removal changes.

So ... less forever until we can upgrade to a released Cython 3!

This ticket is blocking other tickets (#27578, #30884, #31309, ...) for documentation improvement because of cython methods behaving differently with python methods.

We may endure slight performance degradation (which, I think, no one will notice in real computing life) to enjoy conveniences brought by this ticket and allow progress of the mentioned tickets, in the meantime we wait for Cython 3 to arrive.
