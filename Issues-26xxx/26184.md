Due to a bug in the doctest framework (#26110), these tests are not run by default.

To clarify something: these tests *did* pass when I wrote them.  I can confirm this because when I added them `optional - dochtml` didn't exist yet (that was only added on #26017 after I rebased the branch later to include that feature).

Do you mean 8.4.beta3? Because that's when #26017 was merged.
