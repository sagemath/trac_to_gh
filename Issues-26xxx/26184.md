The tests added by #26017 do not pass:

```

Due to a bug in the doctest framework (#26110), these tests are not run by default.

To clarify something: these tests *did* pass when I wrote them.  I can confirm this because when I added them `optional - dochtml` didn't exist yet (that was only added on #26017 after I rebased the branch later to include that feature).

I confirmed manually that it passed then, and it also passes for me now when run manually (on 8.4.beta2).  Of course, by nature, it *will not* pass if not run against a complete build of the docs.  #26017 made it less sensitive to specific magic numbers, but it still doesn't make sense without a full build of the html docs to run against.

Do you mean 8.4.beta3? Because that's when #26017 was merged.
