The tests added by #26017 do not pass:

```
$ ./sage -t --long --optional=dochtml,sage src/sage/misc/sagedoc.py 
too many failed tests, not using stored timings

Due to a bug in the doctest framework (#26110), these tests are not run by default.

Do you mean 8.4.beta3? Because that's when #26017 was merged.
