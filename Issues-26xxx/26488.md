SAGE_ROOT doesn't really make sense in distributions. Remove one usage of it in sage_ostools.pyx, which causes a doctest failure in distributions and it doesn't look that useful in sage-the-distribution.

Yes I have that one in my bag. Technically here the issue is that the doctest won't find the same "sage" executable  (SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage instead of SAGE_ROOT/sage). The ability to find an executable in a particular path (not necessarily part of `PATH`) is not tested. The modified test becomes redundant with 

```
        sage: from sage.misc.sage_ostools import have_program
        sage: have_program('ls')
        True
```
in the same series of doctests.

Do we have something that wouldn't be in a standard path that could be tested instead?

Yes but that's just part of `PATH`. I am thinking if we want to do things right, we have to do something more complicated than that. If there wasn't that `SAGE_ROOT/sage` script in sage the distribution they would have had to write a totally different doctest for that functionality. I think that's what we have to do now.

So I think it needs to go that way.
* create a temporary directory 
* write a small executable script in that directory
* test the function
* remove the script
* do another test to try to find the executable in that directory again (to replace the other test you just removed and that should return false)
* clean up the temporary directory
