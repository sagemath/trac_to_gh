SAGE_ROOT doesn't really make sense in distributions. Remove one usage of it in sage_ostools.pyx, which causes a doctest failure in distributions and it doesn't look that useful in sage-the-distribution.

Do we have something that wouldn't be in a standard path that could be tested instead?

So I think it needs to go that way.
* create a temporary directory 
* write a small executable script in that directory
* test the function
* remove the script
* do another test to try to find the executable in that directory again (to replace the other test you just removed and that should return false)
* clean up the temporary directory
