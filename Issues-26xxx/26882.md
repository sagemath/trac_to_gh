Small and trivial optimization in Miller algorithm computation:

The first point doubling (ell_point.py#L1515) seems useless as it is done in the beginning of the loop (ell_point.py#L1519), value from the first operation is not used in between.

In case the loop is not executed (unlikely), the S variable is not used neither.

This save a ec point doubling by call, which is not that much, but still good to take.
