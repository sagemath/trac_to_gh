IMO, it also feels like the `TermMonoidFactory` is better suited to being a parent that is its just a `UniqueRepresentation` (not to mention all of the ugly doctests). It just is looking quite awkward to me.

However, this is not code I have an investment in, so the design decisions are your. So if there is no memory leak, then feel free to disregard my comment(s).
