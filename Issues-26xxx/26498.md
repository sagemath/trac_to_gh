We have/need a parametrized factory; the desired behavior should be that of both base classes. Where/how do you think the memory leak appears?

IMO, it also feels like the `TermMonoidFactory` is better suited to being a parent that is its just a `UniqueRepresentation` (not to mention all of the ugly doctests). It just is looking quite awkward to me.
