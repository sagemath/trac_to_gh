We have/need a parametrized factory; the desired behavior should be that of both base classes. Where/how do you think the memory leak appears?

What I am worried about is `TermMonoidFactory` having a key `G` to its construction, when then creates an object `TM` (which has a weak ref from the factory) that then holds a strong ref to `G`, creating a reference cycle with a strong reference with the `UniqueRepresentation` key nailing it all in memory.

IMO, it also feels like the `TermMonoidFactory` is better suited to being a parent that is its just a `UniqueRepresentation` (not to mention all of the ugly doctests). It just is looking quite awkward to me.

However, this is not code I have an investment in, so the design decisions are your. So if there is no memory leak, then feel free to disregard my comment(s).
