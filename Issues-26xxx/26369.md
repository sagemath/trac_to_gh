This commit changes the way to deal with edges. We now associate each edge a unique identifier (int) and then store that identifier instead of the edge in data structures such as internal dictionaries, the doubly link list, the components, etc.

After that we can turn many data structures to arrays. Furthermore, it ensures that `_LinkedListNode` only stores an integer
value and not any types.

On the way, we drastically simplify method `__split_multiple_edges`. Indeed, we don't need to sort edges, but to arrange edges with same end points into buckets. If a bucket has more than one edge, we have a set of multiple edges.

This last commit uses the observation that the index in list `int_to_edge` of virtual edges is `>= m` (the first virtual edge has index `m`, the second `m+1`, etc.). 
- The internal label of a virtual edge is now its index.
- To test if an edge is a virtual edge, it suffices to test if its index is `>= m`.
- We introduce 2 arrays to store edges extremities. The main motivation is to avoid constantly accessing list `int_to_edge`.

More cythonization can be done, in particular for the doubly linked list, but I don't know yet what's the best way to do it. May be for another ticket. We already do a lot here.

Also, I have some doubt in types declarations between `int` and `Py_ssize_t`. When should we use this `Py_ssize_t` ?

Timings:

Your branch:

```
sage: G = graphs.JankoKharaghaniGraph(936)
sage: (G.order(), G.size())
(936, 175500)
sage: %time T = G.spqr_tree()
CPU times: user 4.28 s, sys: 124 ms, total: 4.41 s
Wall time: 4.37 s
```
vs 8.4.beta7:

```
sage: %time T = G.spqr_tree()
CPU times: user 6.2 s, sys: 92 ms, total: 6.3 s
Wall time: 6.22 s
```

So already you have a very good speedup on this example (cut ~1/3 of the run time). Let me take a look over things to see what I can improve as well.

With Cythonizing the helper classes, I get a ~3x speedup versus 8.4.beta7:

```
sage: %time T = G.spqr_tree()
CPU times: user 2.63 s, sys: 72 ms, total: 2.7 s
Wall time: 2.66 s
```

I have not looked at the generated C code to see where inefficiencies are yet (i.e., types that we know that we can declare), but that might get even more speed out. However, the next step would be moving away from the Python types such as `list` and `dict` to C++ STL types `vector` and `map` with explicitly declared types.

It seems like this code converts the graph internally into a specific format, so maybe it could work as a standalone library (or C++) with Sage handling the conversion.

Question, does `e_node_dict` always eventually expand out to `G.order()`? If so, then it would be better for it to be a fixed-length array of `_LinkedListNode`'s (once those become `struct`'s, but that seems a little more invasive of a change than I initially was thinking).

In general, the only bad bit of C code I see are those coming from the `graph_copy` manipulations and the fact that `_LinkedListNode` does not know its `data` type. For the graph manipulations, it might better to directly call the corresponding `_backend` method. At the very least, it avoids a level of python indirection, but you might have to unpack the `int_to_edge` into 3 arrays or an array of a `cdef struct` (I would go with the latter) and then feed each of those off.

I made `_LinkedListNode` know that `data` is a `Py_ssize_t`, which gave me a few extra ticks.

It might be better for `e_stack` to be a C++ STL `stack` (or `vector`) of `int`'s too.

I didn't see a general `_LinkedList` needing to be a doubly-linked list other than the `remove`. Do you think it would be possible to easily hold onto that `prev` so you don't need to manipulate a doubly-linked list (and only a singly-linked list)?

Speaking of which, the `_LinkedList` is a little strange in that its getter and setter methods are based on working with the nodes rather than the underlying data.

Okay, I am done with my comments and commits.

I changed `_LinkedListNode` and `_LinkedList` to struct, and changed the list/dict storing these objects to arrays. This gives additional speedup, but some parts of the code are less readable.

To answer one of your questions. The doubly linked list is needed as we may replace the data stored in a node, pushed a new node at the beginning of the list, remove any node from a list, and merge 2 list. Using this data structure, these operations are performed in constant time.

I'm curious of the new running time of your favorite example.

I agree, but I feel like this is something we should care a little less about code reability than speed. In fact, this cut the time by another half:

```
sage: %time T = G.spqr_tree()
CPU times: user 1.2 s, sys: 36 ms, total: 1.23 s
Wall time: 1.2 s
```
Unfortunately Cython does not yet support C++ classes, which would have made the code more readable IMO. Although it just means we had to write more pure C-like code. The 2x speedup though makes it worth it.
