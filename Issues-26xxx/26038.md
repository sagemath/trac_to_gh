The file `geometry/polyhedron/backend_ppl.py` contains the following doctest (basically at the end of the file):

```
        sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0,0),(1,0),(0,1)], rays=[(1,1)], lines=[])
        ....:                backend='ppl', base_ring=ZZ)
        sage: TestSuite(p).run(skip='_test_pickling')
```
This passes when using Sage built with Python 2, while Sage built with Python 3 says, quite correctly,

```
SyntaxError: multiple statements found while compiling a single statement
```
The first line `p = Polyhedron(...)` is a complete statement because of a typo – the `)` instead of `,` at the end of that line – so the continuation line makes no sense. Why does this doctest pass? There must be a bug in Python.

Does that mean we ignore it? Or is there a good way to catch the syntax error?
