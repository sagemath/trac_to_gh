The stock functionality in `sage/finance/stock.py` relies on querying a "Yahoo! Finance"
service to get current stock prices in csv files. The service seems to have shut down in May 2017.

Ticket #25473 marks the corresponding tests in Sage as "known bug".

The functionality to get stock prices should be removed or replaced.

Some alternatives are discussed at

- [Meumobi dev blog: Yahoo finance API discontinued and now?...](http://meumobi.github.io/stocks%20apis/stock/2017/11/07/yahoo-finance-download-API-discontinued.html)

The Yahoo service that was shut down a couple years ago was part of Yahoo Query Language (YQL). It was replaced with another Yahoo service accessible at the URL

https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/quote?symbols=

where stock symbols are appended to the end of the URL separated by commas. I know that this service works because I wrote a custom Amazon Alexa voice skill to access data for stocks described [here](http://analyticphysics.com/Diversions/An%20Alexa%20Skills%20Kit%20(ASK)%20JavaScript%20Cookbook.htm#stocks).

This new service provides more data that the older one in JSON format. If updating the Sage module were as simple as dropping in a new URL I would do so, but I fear the entire module needs to be rewritten. Since I don't use Sage, I'll leave that to someone who does.
