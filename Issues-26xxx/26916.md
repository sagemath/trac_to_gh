You're probably going to hate me, but can your force-push the commit again with a better formatted commit message? In particular the 1st line is treated special than the rest by git. So the 1-line short version should go there, then the longer description after that (I think usually people put a blankline between the two). This will make it easier when reading the history. Once done, you can set a positive review.
