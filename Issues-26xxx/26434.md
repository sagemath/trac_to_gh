On conda, we are seeing failing doctests because installed_packages() is used:

```
File "src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx", line 361, in sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3d._rich_repr_threejs
Failed example:
    sphere(online=True)._rich_repr_threejs()
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

      File "<doctest sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3d._rich_repr_threejs[0]>", line 1, in <module>
        sphere(online=True)._rich_repr_threejs()
      File "sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx", line 377, in sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3d._rich_repr_threejs (build/cythonized/sage/plot/plot3d/base.c:9311)
        scripts = get_display_manager().threejs_scripts(options['online'])
      File "/builds/saraedum/conda-sagelib-tests/sagemath/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/repl/rich_output/display_manager.py", line 749, in threejs_scripts
        version = installed_packages()['threejs'].split('.')[0]
    KeyError: 'threejs'
```

This ticket aims to make installed_packages() here optional but also to simplify the threejs inclusion code that appears to have been duplicated and has since diverged.

If you think that this is fixing two separate issues and should be split into two separate tickets, feel free to make such a change.

Keywords: threejs, conda, installed_packages

Work_Issues: needs testing - but is the general approach ok?

Why doesn't the example

```
get_display_manager().threejs_scripts(from_cdn=True)
```

require an `# optional - internet` tag? Apparently it doesn't becasue it didn't have one before either, but it seems like it should?

> But it appears that threejs has no version information readily available.


Grep shows that at least on nix the version is present in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Not sure if that is build system specific or anything.

Why would anyone want to use the CDN version anyways?

This just generates `<script>` tags. It doesn't download the scripts that these tags refer to.

These files are npm metadata. I don't think that all disrtibutions include them.

We could remove the CDN option but it's probably there for a reason.
Why would you want to use it? Well "it feels right" from a web-dev perspective...maybe you don't have threejs installed (in a compatible version)? Or you want to publish this somewhere online and don't want to serve all these script tags yourself?

At the meeting in Luminy last week we had virtually everybody who tried Sage stumble upon this one.

Since three.js is a standard package this should also be acceptable for packagers. They need to set the THREEJS environment variable and then the right scripts should be included.

The current situation is:
- by default scripts are served offline and it works in some cases
- there is an option to easily get output with scripts served online from CDN which also has its use cases and works everywhere, as I understand, but should not be made the default
- there are cases (important ones) where offline does not work

How about:
- keep the existing functionality of serving "offline" scripts
- keep the existing functionality of serving "online/CDN" scripts
- add your new option to inject the whole code instead of script tags

The default should be then "use offline scripts if possible, but inject the code if it does not work". Is this realizable? If not, then at least please keep the option to use CDN on request, what harm comes from that?!

Please be careful regarding versions: any version will generally not work. Three.js is almost never backward compatible. That’s just how Mr.doob works, and if we want to use his code we need to be aware of that.

The only harm that comes with this is that it creates more code to maintain. As opposed to only supporting one of these options.

The current situation is that this is broken for lots of users and they don't understand what's going on.

> > Ok. So I can parse the REVISION to keep the CDN option alive. But the default would be to include all of three.js so things just work? (We could improve upon this further in a followup, e.g., add three.js to the sage kernel so it's only loaded once when in a Jupyter context.)
  
> The original purpose of distinguishing between offline/online scripts was to use local files by default. One could then choose to set `online=True` to use the CDN for files that were meant to be shared. The Three.js template also has the silent fallback to the CDN that was fixed in #27575, so that even a notebook generated with the default of local files would work when shared on the web.

> I would like to see the original idea kept alive: first use local files, then fall back to the CDN as necessary or by choice. The only time you would want to dump all of Three.js into a file is when there is no Internet connectivity at all, but how often does that happen nowadays?

> How about if this ticket just parses `three.min.js` for the version number to get rid of `installed_packages()` and doesn't change anything else yet? Then see what other issues arise in practice. Although you'll want to use `THREEJSDIR` in the local script tags.

That also works for me. I had forgotten about #27575 in the meantime.
