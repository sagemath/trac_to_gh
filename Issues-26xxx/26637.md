Done here:
- correct method `eulerian_orientation` for graphs without edge (was not using the right set of vertices)
  - Should we move this method to `orientation.py` ?

- some care in `min_spanning_tree`, but we have remaining issues:
  - algorithm `"Prim_fringe"` compare vertex labels. I added `hash(..)` around, but this is certainly not enough.
  - the output of min spanning tree methods is sorted. As said in #26547, there is no reason for that.

- avoid a call to .edges in `cycle_basis`
