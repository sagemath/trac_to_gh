```
Import alarm, sleep and parallel and construct a function to be run in parallel:

```python
sage: from signal import alarm
sage: from time import sleep
sage: @parallel
....: def f(a):
....:     sleep(1)
....:     return factor(a)
....: 
```

If the function `f` is called normally, it behaves well with alarm interruptions:

```python
sage: try:
....:     alarm(1)
....:     map(f, range(10))
....: except AlarmInterrupt:
....:     print 'alarm'
....: else:
....:     print 'else'
....:     
0
alarm
```

But If the function `f` is called in parallel, then it ignores the alarm interruption and just continue its execution:

```python
sage: try:
....:     alarm(1)
....:     L = list(f(range(1,10)))
....: except AlarmInterrupt:
....:     print 'alarm'
....: else:
....:     print 'else'
....:     
0
else
```

Of course, as a result, the computation for input 1 was stopped (thus NO DATA) and the other computations were not stopped:

```python
sage: L
[(((1,), {}), 'NO DATA (timed out)'),
 (((2,), {}), 2),
 (((3,), {}), 3),
 (((4,), {}), 2^2),
 (((5,), {}), 5),
 (((6,), {}), 2 * 3),
 (((7,), {}), 7),
 (((8,), {}), 2^3),
 (((9,), {}), 3^2)]
```
I consider this as a bug. I believe that the parallel `f` function should not swallow the `alarm` interruptions so that the above example print "alarm" and not "else".

The problem is that the `@parallel` decorator uses alarms internally to implement the timeout functionality. So basically your alarm is overridden by `@parallel`.

sage: @parallel?
```
says:

```
      * "timeout" -- number of seconds until each subprocess is
        killed (only supported by 'fork'; zero means not at all)
```
Would it be possible when `timeout=zero` that alarm exceptions are not catched since when `timeout=0` no alarm are set?
