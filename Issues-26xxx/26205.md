`sage -t src/sage/geometry/lattice_polytope.py` generate a lot of doctests failures due to missing `__lt__` operator.


```
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'LatticePolytopeClass' and 'LatticeP
olytopeClass'
```

`__ne__` and `__eq__` are already implemented in `LatticePolytopeClass`.
This ticket aim at implementing the remaining cases `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__` and `__ge__`.

Component: **python3**

For what i have understand to use `__richcmp__`/`_richcmp_` your class need to be a subclass of `sage.structure.Element`, and `LatticePolytopeClass` only extends `SageObject`. I am willing to have advices on the best way to do this.

Edit: Ok i was too fast to answer. `@`richcmp_method is the thing i was looking for thanks.

* `_richcmp_` with a single score if only for subclasses of Element, indeed.

* but `__richcmp__` with double underscore is for every class:

-  it works directly everywhere in cython (.pyx files)

- in python files, you need to decorate the class with `@richcmp_method`

For many examples, see `git grep -A1 "@richcmp" src/sage`
