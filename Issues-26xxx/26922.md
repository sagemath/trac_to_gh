#28625 fixed the `f_vector` in the case of unpointed polyhedra/polyhedra with lines.

We add doctests showing that #28625 fixed a bug in `f_vector`.

Before:

```
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[[1,-1,0],[1,1,0]]).f_vector()
(1, 2, 1)
```

But this polyhedron does not have zero-dimensional faces, and #28625 has correctly changed that:

```
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[[1,-1,0],[1,1,0]]).f_vector()
(1, 0, 2, 1)
```

Also we add documentation, specifically warning users that the methods
- `vertices`,
- `vertices_list`,
- `vertices_generator`
- `vertices_matrix`,
- `n_vertices`,
treat vertices of the `Vrepresentation` and not vertices of the polyhedron in the unpointed case.

#26887
The calculation is correct there.

Also it can be corrected quickly now by calculating the dimension of the first level in the face lattice.

<a id='comment:5'></a>In principle, the problem is that the face lattice has four elements, but the elements on the second level are not 0-dimensional, but 1-dimensional.

So, depending on the definition of the f-vector:

* Counting the number of elements at each level of the face lattice
* Vector counting the number of faces by dimension

It should return different things.

One thing that should be done, is to make this explicit in the documentation of `f_vector` once this ticket is fixed and give an example of the difference with unbounded polyhedra.

<a id='comment:6'></a>#27063 will change the calculation of the f-vector (hopefully soon) to make use of `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.

This will count the number of faces per dimension, as the docstring of `f_vector` states (there is a +2 or -2 two missing, as the first entry gives the -1-dimensional faces count.

We could make this ticket depend on #27063 and then just append the docstring accordingly.

One could also fix it for now (just append a few zeros according to `n_lines`).

I think f-vectors of fixed dimension polyhedra should be have sums/addition.
Also if one considers how adding or deleting inequalities can alter the f-vector this is strange.
Anyway, it's most important to be precise, which one we use. Adding a zero or deleting it, if one really depends one version is trivial.

<a id='comment:12'></a>May I suggest the following:

```diff

-            In case of a polyhedron with lines (unpointed polyhedron),
-            return the number of vertices of the ``Vrepresentation``.
-            Wheras the polyhedron has no vertices, this number corresponds
-            to the number of `k`-faces, where `k` is the number of lines.
+            If the polyhedron has lines, returns the number of vertices in
+            the ``Vrepresentation``. As the represented polyhedron has 
+            no 0-dimensional faces (i.e. vertices), this number corresponds
+            to the number of `k`-faces, where `k` is the number of lines.
```

Somehow, even though I corrected the above warning. I do not like what it says at all for the following reason:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(rays=[[1,0,0]],lines=[[0,1,0]])
sage: P.vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0, 0),)
sage: Q = Polyhedron(lines=[[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])
sage: Q.vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0, 0),)
sage: R = Polyhedron(rays=[[1,0,0],[0,1,0]],vertices=[[0,1,0],[1,0,0]],lines=[[0,0,1]])
sage: R.vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 1, 0), A vertex at (1, 0, 0))
```

In Sage, the computational convention (or compromise) is that polyhedra without vertices in their V-representation still receive a canonically computed vertex in order to do computations.

With this in mind, the second sentence is wrong. Just look at the above polyhedron `R`. It has lines, and two vertices.

---> This warning is more confusing than anything. Please rephrase taking the above three examples in mind and the convention in Sage.
