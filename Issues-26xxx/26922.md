#28625 fixed the `f_vector` in the case of unpointed polyhedra/polyhedra with lines.

We add doctests showing that #28625 fixed a bug in `f_vector`.

Before:

```
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[[1,-1,0],[1,1,0]]).f_vector()
(1, 2, 1)
```

But this polyhedron does not have zero-dimensional faces, and #28625 has correctly changed that:

```
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=[[1,-1,0],[1,1,0]]).f_vector()
(1, 0, 2, 1)
```

Also we add documentation, specifically warning users that the methods
- `vertices`,
- `vertices_list`,
- `vertices_generator`
- `vertices_matrix`,
- `n_vertices`,
treat vertices of the `Vrepresentation` and not vertices of the polyhedron in the unpointed case.

Depends on #28625

This will be probably solved at some point by
#26887
The calculation is correct there.

Also it can be corrected quickly now by calculating the dimension of the first level in the face lattice.

In principle, the problem is that the face lattice has four elements, but the elements on the second level are not 0-dimensional, but 1-dimensional.

So, depending on the definition of the f-vector:

* Counting the number of elements at each level of the face lattice
* Vector counting the number of faces by dimension

It should return different things.

One thing that should be done, is to make this explicit in the documentation of `f_vector` once this ticket is fixed and give an example of the difference with unbounded polyhedra.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">Comment 6</div>

#27063 will change the calculation of the f-vector (hopefully soon) to make use of `CombinatorialPolyhedron`.

This will count the number of faces per dimension, as the docstring of `f_vector` states (there is a +2 or -2 two missing, as the first entry gives the -1-dimensional faces count.

We could make this ticket depend on #27063 and then just append the docstring accordingly.

One could also fix it for now (just append a few zeros according to `n_lines`).

Replying to [@jplab](#comment%3A5):
> In principle, the problem is that the face lattice has four elements, but the elements on the second level are not 0-dimensional, but 1-dimensional.

I think f-vectors of fixed dimension polyhedra should be have sums/addition.
Also if one considers how adding or deleting inequalities can alter the f-vector this is strange.
Anyway, it's most important to be precise, which one we use. Adding a zero or deleting it, if one really depends one version is trivial.

#28625 fixes this.

I added some tests, improved the documentation of `f_vector` and fixed a tiny typo.

<div id="comment:12" align="right">Comment 12</div>

May I suggest the following:

```diff

-            In case of a polyhedron with lines (unpointed polyhedron),
-            return the number of vertices of the ``Vrepresentation``.
-            Wheras the polyhedron has no vertices, this number corresponds
-            to the number of `k`-faces, where `k` is the number of lines.
+            If the polyhedron has lines, returns the number of vertices in
+            the ``Vrepresentation``. As the represented polyhedron has 
+            no 0-dimensional faces (i.e. vertices), this number corresponds
+            to the number of `k`-faces, where `k` is the number of lines.
```

Somehow, even though I corrected the above warning. I do not like what it says at all for the following reason:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(rays=[[1,0,0]],lines=[[0,1,0]])
sage: P.vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0, 0),)
sage: Q = Polyhedron(lines=[[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])
sage: Q.vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0, 0),)
sage: R = Polyhedron(rays=[[1,0,0],[0,1,0]],vertices=[[0,1,0],[1,0,0]],lines=[[0,0,1]])
sage: R.vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 1, 0), A vertex at (1, 0, 0))
```

In Sage, the computational convention (or compromise) is that polyhedra without vertices in their V-representation still receive a canonically computed vertex in order to do computations.

With this in mind, the second sentence is wrong. Just look at the above polyhedron `R`. It has lines, and two vertices.

---> This warning is more confusing than anything. Please rephrase taking the above three examples in mind and the convention in Sage.
