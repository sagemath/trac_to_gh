When trying to run a Singular kernel after installing `singular_jupyter`, jupyter can not connect to the kernel, and we get the following error on the terminal where jupyter was started from:

```
/usr/bin/python: No module named jupyter_kernel_singular
```

So, apparently, there is a wrong path hardcoded somewhere.

(tested on 8.5.beta2)
