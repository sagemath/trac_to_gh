```
For some interfaces, using the IPython `%pinfo`/`%pinfo2` magic or the questionmark syntax for viewing the help and source code fails with an `AttributeError` (see below).

The interfaces R and Macaulay2 are affected by this, possibly others as well.

This bug occurs in the console as well as the Jupyter notebook. The oldstyle notebook does not seem to be affected. Possibly related: #11913 and #10860.

I found the bug to be caused by `sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec` returning `None` in this case, which apparently is not supported by IPython.

Here is the stack trace:

It turns out this happens when `sagenb` parses parts of the docstring which changed to

```diff
 **Type:** <class 'sage.interfaces.r.RFunction'>

-**Definition:** r.lm( [noargspec] )
+**Definition:** r.lm(*args, **kwds)

 **Docstring:**
```
Here, the `*` and `**` are incorrectly interpreted as markup. There is an escape mechanism in place for this which requires setting the flag `sage.misc.sageinspect.EMBEDDED_MODE`. In `sagenb`, this is usually handled by `sagenb.misc.support.init`. However, initialization is never done in that specific doctest, so it is just a matter of changing that doctest. I guess I will report this at `sagenb`.
