After the upgrade to GAP 4.10 in #22626, we revisit what
GAP packages are available in Sage via the GAP standard
SPKG and via extra optional SPGKs.

All GAP packages formerly in our "database_gap"
optional SPKG, except tomlib, now get installed
with GAP as part of our "gap" standard SPKG.

This ticket adds tomlib to the "gap" standard SPKG
and removes the "database_gap" optional SPKG.

(All packages previously in "database_gap" have
GPL-compatible licenses and can therefore be
distributed as part of the "gap" standard SPKG
without license worries.)

We also update the list of extra GAP packages
in gap_packages, which remains a separate and
optional SPKG.

Once the present ticket is merged, GAP packages
shipped with the "gap" standard SPKG and with
the "gap_packages" optional SPKG are as follows.

'''GAP packages now shipped with "gap"
(standard SageMath package)'''

A basic package used by most GAP packages
for their documentation

- GAPDoc

Five database packages formerly in "database_gap"

- PrimGrp
- SmallGrp
- TransGrp
- TomLib
- AtlasRep

Twelve more packages

- AutPGrp
- Alnuth
- CRISP
- !CTblLib
- FactInt
- FGA
- IRREDSOL
- LAGUNA
- Polenta
- Polycyclic
- ResClasses
- Sophus

'''GAP packages now shipped with "gap_packages"
(optional SageMath package)'''

Twenty-five "pure GAP" packages
(not requiring compilation)

- AClib
- AutoDoc
- CoReLG
- CRIME
- Cryst
- CrystCat
- DESIGN
- GBNP
- HAP
- HAPcryst
- hecke
- LieAlgDB
- LiePRing
- LieRing
- loops
- MapClass
- polymaking
- QPA
- QuaGroup
- RadiRoot
- Repsn
- SLA
- SONATA
- Toric
- utils

Four compiled GAP packages

- cohomolo
- GRAPE
- GUAVA
- nq

**No longer distributed**

- HAPprime: unmaintained, partly merged in HAP, 
  see [list of "No longer redistributed with GAP or renamed" GAP packages](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html#deppkg),

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

historically, there were several reasons to have separate gap, database_gap and gap_packages, and do not install all the possible GAP packages

* largish sizes of downloads
* licensing issues---stuff in database_gap is not GPL-compatible before GAP 4.9 or 4.10
* non-working with libgap GAP kernel extensions

the 1st one, if we decide not to re-package original GAP tarball (and I am very much for not re-packaging), would be gone.

the 2nd one is (completely, from the point of view of GAP's LICENCE file) fixed since GAP 4.10 (or even 4.9).

the 3rd one is fixed by #22626, although this has to be verified.

Last I checked this is broken actually, but it's mostly a problem with my install script I think.  I need to tinker with that a bit more.

Note that most of database_gap is already in our new gap (4.10) package, with exception of tomlib. 

I'll add tomlib to gap 4.10, and get rid of database_gap.

Without `database_gap` in optional, everything passes. The trouble is that the failing tests are not tagged as optional, i.e. it should not matter whether `database_gap` is passed or not. 

Needless to say, these tests work at the Sage prompt just fine.

My hunch is that it might be related to the recent #25706, which unfortunately mixes `libgap` and `gap`. (Even if this were true, it would not take away the general flakiness of Sage's doctesting framework...)

The "doctest framework" is not flaky. Code in Sage or its tests is flaky.

In many cases, the mysterious failure of doctests is due to some changing interaction with the Python garbage collector. For example, adding an extra test might change the time when the garbage collector kicks in, causing these strange failures. This is especially true when weak references are involved. And the failing test involves the coercion model, which is using weak references.

All that is needed to have the doctests pass with `database_gap` in `--optional` is the latest commit. 

We still need to make sure that tables of marks (GAP 4.8 tomlib package) are there, and then remove `#optional : database_gap` tags and `database_gap` package.

OK, I'll make our default GAP, without `gap_packages` installed, to be the same as vanilla GAP 4.10, which is, package-wise, as follows:

```
$ ./gap
 ┌───────┐   GAP 4.10.0 of 01-Nov-2018
 │  GAP  │   https://www.gap-system.org
 └───────┘   Architecture: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-default64
 Configuration:  gmp 6.1.2, readline

 Packages:   AClib 1.3.1, Alnuth 3.1.0, AtlasRep 1.5.1, AutoDoc 2018.09.20, AutPGrp 1.10, CRISP 1.4.4, Cryst 4.1.18, CrystCat 1.1.8, CTblLib 1.2.2,

```

This covers everything that is in `database_gap`, and more - so we'll move some things out of `gap_packages` into the main `gap` package.

I'm currently going for the minimal thing: get gap_packages spkg working the way it was.
We never had io package there, as it was breaking libgap in a bad way.
(there are open tickets about io package).

Does this sound like a good plan to you? We can postpone io package, it's not needed to be ready by the Debian freeze deadline.

I'm getting an unpleasant surprise from the doctest framework here - it mangles long lines in this file, e.g. here:

and instead of `F_{\\alpha_{1}}` at few places it outputs `F\n1` - probably some unfortunate combination of escape sequences, dunno... (needless to say, the output at the sage prompt is fine).

I'm inclined to mark these as `# known bug` and deal with them later...

In the case of the "grape" package, ISTM the only actual "compiled" part is not technically part of the package at all, but rather it builds its own copy of nauty.  It ought to be able to use the nauty that's already included in Sage.

Might be a "noisy line" thing - but why only while doctesting? Anyhow I have opened #26924 to deal with it.

I get these warnings when loading the relevant GAP packages in a vanilla GAP source tree, so I suppose they're normal and/or expected, or at least not indicative of any specific bug on our part.  But we probably need to at least temporarily silence them for the purposes of the code and tests they affect.

The one exception being the error about "qpa-version".  The name of the package is just "qpa", but its source directory is unusually named "qpa-version-<x.y>", so there's some code that's making an invalid assumption about GAP package names :sigh:

Yes, atlasrep does this.
However, you might have a stale libgap workspace. I saw this warning, and then went away after I wiped the workspaces out.

This one feels like a bug in the GAP and/or the QuaGroup package to me, but I confirmed that this is in fact the output provided by GAP and not a bug on our end, so for the time being there's nothing to be done (other than possibly report it upstream)

This is one of the problems with GAP objects not having a real string representation that isn't tied to how exactly they're printed to the screen :|

The problem here, accounting for all these test failures including the test above that was modified, is that the QuaGroups package seems (I have not looked for the exact code) to insert linebreaks into the representations of its types in different places depending on the terminal width.  Not exactly sure if that's a GAP thing in general or something specific to this package, but this is the first place it's come up.  In any case we apparently aren't dealing well with those unnecessary line breaks.

the latest commit fixes these failures, which are two-fold:
missing dependencies and weird `-version`-part which one should strip.

I should still figure out how to suppress these `#I ...` lines...

Gatwick was shut down for ~36 hours due to some not yet caught folks flying a largish drone over it several times, 700+ flights cancelled, 100s diverted. We were able to book an even cheaper flight, via Berlin, and get a full refund. They are open since this morning, and in fact the airline rebooked us for tonight, but we were in the full panic mode and got the other flight already...

they pass for me, both with and without `--long`, on Linux and on OSX.

I'd try `rm -rf local/share/gap local/include/gap` followed by `./sage -f gap gap_packages` followed up by `make build`, and then testing...

Nevermind, that was my fault.  Nevertheless, this still won't work: The outcomes of these tests depend on whether or not `gap_packages` is installed, so if it isn't then these will give different results.  I'm not sure what to do: Maybe these tests should be rewritten to be more flexible, or the code that's being tested needs to be rewritten to be less sensitive to what GAP packages are installed (if that's even possible...)

for transition from several to one package it's OK, I think.
We can merge them later on another ticket.

For the remaining problematic tests I was able to fix them by manually calling (with some explanation in the prose) `libgap.set_seed(0)` before them (and modifying the expected output to correspond to that random seed).

It's unfortunate but possibly necessary, since the state of the PRNG can seem to depend on which packages were loaded and when, and for whatever reason those tests just happened to be very sensitive to this.

I'm re-running the full test suite now to see if any other examples like this turn up.

Ah, right, I had forgotten about that.  That makes sense.

The issue here again seems to have something in part to do with the random number generator state in GAP.  In the case of:

```
sage: MG = GU(3,2).as_matrix_group()
sage: PG = MG.as_permutation_group()
sage: PG2 = MG._permutation_group_()
```

*usually* `PG` and `PG2` will be the same, but on rare occasion they will be different, and that just happened to be the case in this test.  Could that be a bug in GAP, or expected behavior?  That I don't know.

That code is still a mess on the Sage end too as well, so any effort to clean it up can't hurt.

We have two instances of GAP talking to each other, how their RNGs are syncronised is
an interesting question. Are they?

Yes, this ticket gets rid of database_gap (everything there will be a part of gap package), so this is taken care of here.

I've also fixed the build failure here, so it's ready for review, I think.

Yes, merging in #26874 guarantees that test always works the same way, as the RNG state is consistent.

I'll deal with [comment:107](#comment%3A107) and then do a couple final checks before setting positive_review.

This "fix" is a problem as well.  The "cleanup" commands that were moved were deliberately *before* `sdh_install *` so that files that shouldn't be installed aren't installed.  I'll see if I can reproduce the problem you had; I did not have the same problem on Ubuntu.

Nope.  I do have an experimental branch where I modified `Randstate.set_seed_gap()` to seed both libgap and the pexpect GAP simultaneously, but I haven't decided whether or not to use it yet.

Replying to [@embray](#comment%3A118):
> Thanks--I was able to reproduce the problem in a docker container.  My attempted fix doesn't seem to help.  Not sure what the problem is though; it's an odd one...

I think they are.  I originally meant, as part of #22626 to deprecate these modules and disable their tests, but I forgot to add that to the work items.

While we're at it I'll go ahead and mark the tests to be skipped, and will handle the deprecation later, perhaps as part of #26959.

I did a fresh test run earlier today and everything looked good, but it will be good to get a second opinion.  I'm about to push one more change to disable skip those problematic tests.

@@ -1,5 +1,100 @@
-Now everything needed is already in GAP's tarball.
+After the upgrade to GAP 4.10 in #22626, we revisit what
+GAP packages are available in Sage via the GAP standard
+SPKG and via extra optional SPGKs.
 
-There is also no more copyright-induced hassle of having `database_gap`
-separate and optional, although `gap_packages` still need a look at the respective copyrights (if we wish to make it standard).
+All GAP packages formerly in our "database_gap"
+optional SPKG, except tomlib, now get installed
+with GAP as part of our "gap" standard SPKG.
 
+This ticket adds tomlib to the "gap" standard SPKG
+and removes the "database_gap" optional SPKG.
+
+(All packages previously in "database_gap" have
+GPL-compatible licenses and can therefore be
+distributed as part of the "gap" standard SPKG
+without license worries.)
+
+We also update the list of extra GAP packages
+in gap_packages, which remains a separate and
+optional SPKG.
+
+Once the present ticket is merged, GAP packages
+shipped with the "gap" standard SPKG and with
+the "gap_packages" optional SPKG are as follows.
+
+'''GAP packages now shipped with "gap"
+(standard SageMath package)'''
+

+for their documentation
