The GAP notation for permutations is a bit strange. A permutation group can, for example, be created like this:

```
sage: libgap.eval('Group( [ (1,2)(3,8)(4,6)(5,7), (1,3)(2,5)(4,7)(6,8) ] )')
Group([ (1,2)(3,8)(4,6)(5,7), (1,3)(2,5)(4,7)(6,8) ])
```
Rather than evaluating string, it would be more pythonic to be able to do the following (which currently fails):

```
sage: libgap.Group( [ ((1,2),(3,8),(4,6),(5,7)), ((1,3),(2,5),(4,7),(6,8)) ] )
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: libGAP: Error, usage: Group(<gen>,...), Group(<gens>), Group(<gens>,<id>)
```

I am not aware of a different pythonic way to create a permutation group in libgap. If there is, please speak up and review this as "duplicate/won't fix".

copying from my sage-devel post:
What are these permutations, type-wise? Are they Sage permutations, or
just strings?
The following works:

```
sage: G=PermutationGroup( [ ((1,2),(3,8),(4,6),(5,7)),
((1,3),(2,5),(4,7),(6,8)) ] )
sage: libgap(G)
Group([ (1,2)(3,8)(4,6)(5,7), (1,3)(2,5)(4,7)(6,8) ])
```
Unfortunately `PermutationGroup(libgap(G))` does not currently work, one
needs to dig deeper,
to the level of generators. This ought to be fixed.

Also, currently this is done via strings, and there should be a much
better way to exchange Sage's and GAP's permutations available, on C
level. It's quite doable with libgap, but needs work.

One of the problems is that Gap has a fundamental datatype for "permutation" (with special syntax support!) that Sage does not have. One way to obtain what you request is by letting a python tuple of tuples translate into a permutation in libgap. I think that's a poor match-up. Currently both python tuples and lists get converted into gap lists. There's a bit of a loss there, but if Gap does not have a more suitable translation for a tuple (a permutation cycle certainly isn't), then that's probably the best choice.

The next best thing is a routine (in gap?) that takes a list of lists, interprets it as a cycle product, and returns the product as a permutation in Gap. There is such a routine in Gap 4.10, (but by the looks of it not in 4.8):

https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap42.html#X7B3194EC869D936D

So if we can delay this ticket until libgap is upgraded to 4.10, then we can do simply something like

```
CycleFromList=libgap.function_factory("CycleFromList")
gens=[((1,2),(3,8),(4,6),(5,7)),((1,3),(2,5),(4,7),(6,8))]
[prod(CycleFromList(c) for c in L) for L in gens]
```
I would recommend to keep "libgap" as thin as possible: provide only a very faithful interface to and from gap, hopefully with as many useful basic datastructure mappings as possible. Then we can write convenient tools to translate back and forth higher level objects based on that. If we keep that basics of libgap largely independent of sage, I think you'll get the best cooperation from the Gap people in making it work well.

Sage does have fast permutations (in Cython) as a fundamental datatype, it merely lacks a convenient syntax. So the translation Sage<->GAP ought to be on that  level, C arrays to C arrays.

I see. Indeed, this works presently:

```
PermList=libgap.function_factory("PermList")
sage: L=[ ((1,2),(3,8),(4,6),(5,7)), ((1,3),(2,5),(4,7),(6,8)) ]
sage: G=libgap.Group([PermList(Permutation(s)) for s in L])
```
This looks like a more promising route than using `CycleFromList`.

It would not be unreasonable to be able to use `libgap` instead of `PermList` in the example above, especially if it would shortcut to an efficient conversion. Presently, the conversion of `GapElement_Permutation` goes via a ListPerm, so it isn't very efficient either.

I'm also not so sure that currently the element returned by `Permutation` in Sage is actually a cythonized type. The MRO indicates not.

Should this ticket be the place to track more efficient permutation conversion between sage and libgap?

I don't know what MRO is, but by reading [src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_element.pyx](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/934b744f653268515ee55d19cf499f16d4f4766d/src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_element.pyx#L512) one might see that the actual data for a permutation group element (not to be confused with `Permutation`) is kept in a C array. Likewise, in GAP permutation group elements are kept in C arrays, which can be accessed/created from libgap with their C API (what we already do for e.g. GAP long integers).

By the way, it seems that `Permutation` does not use that C array, so converting to/from `Permutation` won't be fast.

OK, indeed. In one direction we're there already:

```
sage: from sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element import SymmetricGroupElement as CyPerm
sage: L=[ ((1,2),(3,8),(4,6),(5,7)), ((1,3),(2,5),(4,7),(6,8)) ]
sage: G=libgap.Group([CyPerm(s) for s in L])
```
However, the round-trip is a bit off:

```
sage: a=CyPerm([(1,2,3)])
sage: type(a)
<type 'sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element.SymmetricGroupElement'>
sage: r=libgap(a).sage()
sage: type(r)
<class 'sage.combinat.permutation.StandardPermutations_all_with_category.element_class'>
```
So it looks like either `Permutation` needs to be made to convert to `libgap` automatically as well, or `sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement_Permutation.sage` needs to be changed to return a `SymmetricGroupElement` instead.

In addition, perhaps it would be nice to merge the two notions of `Permutation` in sage? Or are the uses in combinatorics and group theory so different that it warrants different representing objects?

One might implement `GapElement_PermutationGroupElement` in src/sage/libs/gap/element.pyx, in addition to
already present `GapElement_Permutation`
However, it is then unclear what `type(libgap.eval('(1,2);'))` should be...

well, yes and no. One reason for the divergence of the two we see in GAP is historical, the combinatorics of permutations comes from sage-combinat project.
Merging would be some work...

And then prefer that to the present conversion performed by `sage`? I'd think that's reasonable, since permutations in gap are likely occurring in a group-theoretic context.

> However, it is then unclear what `type(libgap.eval('(1,2);'))` should be...

No, why would that need to change? It gives whatever gap parses it to, wrapped by libgap in the appropriate element class. Are you worried that 
`libgap(eval("(1,2)"))` and `libgap.eval("(1,2)")` have different results?
