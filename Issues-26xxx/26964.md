When trying to build Sage on a very bare fedora install (e.g. a Docker container) the packages listed in the build instructions at:

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#linux-prerequisite-installation

are insufficient.  At the very least it also needs `findutils` and `which`, and currently it also requires `python2`, though that should be fixed as part of  #26953. The need for `which` comes, at the very least, from MPIR's `configure` script, which uses `which` at least on Linux.

With #29053, the necessary distribution packages for an installation are cataloged in `build/pkgs/fedora.txt`, `build/pkgs/SPKG/distros/fedora.txt` and similar for other distributions.

In this ticket, we add to `bootstrap` some code to keep the `yum` (and `apt-get` for debian) command-lines in the  installation manual up to date. #29053 prepared this by isolating these command lines in separate .txt files in `src/doc`.

No, no, `bootstrap` is exactly the right phase for this, not `configure`. Let me explain more.

`bootstrap` will prepare a source tree so that
- `make sdist` can be run
- `configure` can be run by a user (who does not have autotools)
- `src/setup.py sdist` can be run.
- `src/configure` can be run (#29119)

None of this depends on the configuration determined by `configure`!

As the installation manual sources are part of the sagelib sdist, the command lines of this ticket should be prepared in the bootstrap phase.

I want to clarify something about this here:  Do you mean the sagelib sdist, or the sage-the-distribution sdist?

I sort of see your point, but I'm still not sure why it needs to go here.  Also, as part of #29119 I'm adding a `src/bootstrap` script for sagelib itself, so maybe something like this would make more sense to go there.

Anyways, setting back to needs_work since no branch is attached.  Maybe then I'll see what you're talking about.

Both.

Currently, of course, only sage-the-distribution has a working sdist.

sagelib's sdist needs fixing. You might remember ticket #21516 - Fix sagelib sdist (`src/setup.py sdist`). 


> I sort of see your point, but I'm still not sure why it needs to go here.  Also, as part of #29119 I'm adding a `src/bootstrap` script for sagelib itself, so maybe something like this would make more sense to go there.

In my opinion, there should only be one developer-invoked `bootstrap` script (the one for the distribution) -- because everything will depend on the distribution's `build/pkgs` files. 

`SAGE_ROOT/bootstrap` could certainly call a new script `src/bootstrap` for generating files that end up in `src/`. If you create that in #29119, fine. 


> Anyways, setting back to needs_work since no branch is attached.  Maybe then I'll see what you're talking about.

Sure. #29041 (src/requirements.txt, src/constraints.txt, src/setup.cfg) has a branch, needs review.

No, because developers who build sage out of a git worktree do not run `make sdist`.

Sure, but what is required for running `make sdist`?  It seems to me this should be done in two separate cases: One when running `make sdist` and one when developing out of source.  In either case I don't think the bootstrap script is the appropriate place for it.

The only reason you seem to be putting it there is that it would happen to cover both cases, but I think both cases should be handled separately.

There is a really easy solution:  
- `bootstrap` is only allowed in the full distribution source, not in a separate sagelib source. No hardlinks necessary. Only developers bootstrap.
- Users don't bootstrap, they start with the configure phase. 
- sdist of the distribution and sdist of sagelib generate bootstrapped source archives.

Obviously, it requires exactly a bootstrapped source tree!

`bootstrap` is the phase before `configure`, which does not depend on the configuration of the system.

But this ticket doesn't change any of those .txt files. In my case I have Sage 9.1.beta3, then I switch to this branch and `make` fails, even with your latest branch. Is there no way to avoid this?

`./bootstrap -d` generates the correct files, but I have to run it manually.

the idea is that one can `make configure` is not a good one. `configure` is "built" by autoconf, not by make.

the new style is built automatically, whereas the old one was manual.
One can surely hack further to add insertion of ` \` after ~80 chars, but it's certainlty minor...
