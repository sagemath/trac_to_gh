Hello! Saw your post on sage-devel and figured I'd take a shot at testing this.

I was able to get this branch to build just fine, but I ran into some missing run-time dependencies for `jsonschema`, namely: `attrs`, `importlib_metadata`, and `pyrsistent` (which then required `zipp`).

I've pushed a [commit](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/14149164c43758b8f2845630df96b89dbe1f1c79) with these packages added. This is the first time I've done any work with the SPKGs, and I'm not sure if I've followed the conventions correctly, so I didn't want to overwrite your branch in this ticket. For example, I wasn't sure how/whether to include these run-time dependencies in the `build/pkgs/{jsonschema|pyrsistent}/dependencies` files.

With these packages present, the Jupyter server starts up and notebooks can be opened, edited, and ran just fine. Threejs plots are working including the new animation stuff, but JSmol plots are not. Nor does MathJax function correctly. I see 404 status codes for `/nbextensions/mathjax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML-full,Safe&delayStartupUntil=configured` and `/nbextensions/jsmol/JSmol.min.js`, which are perhaps related to some of the other outstanding Jupyter tickets.
