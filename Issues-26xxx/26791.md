See https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/MX-SnQJh8EE/2vNChwf_CQAJ.

~~It looks like rpy2 picks up the systems R.~~

When a symbol has been overloaded, R's `help` doesn't pick the right symbol.

I've looked at rpy2s build script. It contains the line

```
export RHOMES="$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/R
```

That looks like a typo. rpy2 respects the environment variable `RHOME`, without the `s`. Probably didn't cause any issues before because `rpy2` wasn't used very heavily before #26596.

Shall do. But I have to upgrade my local installation first. Don't expect results 
before tomorrow morning...

Note that the version described in my  my [report](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/MX-SnQJh8EE/2vNChwf_CQAJ) (done on another machine !) used Sage's R (3.4.4) rather than system's R (3.5.1, as packaged by Debian).

It turns out that I can't check out the branch related to this ticket (see [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/j34e9EOGz)).

But manually fixing the typo in a local branch doesn fix the problem :

```
sage -f rpy2
sage -t --long --warn-long 47.5 src/sage/interfaces/r.py 
```
gives the same result :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 47.5 src/sage/interfaces/r.py  # 3 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Visual inspection shows the same docstring differences as before.

PS : I saw a new update of this ticket while I was writing this : I still can't `trac checkout` this ticket. Now we have two problems 8-(.

Did you re-install `rpy2` between those commands? I think `-f` just removes the package and without reinstalling it before testing, god knows what happens.

Could you also post the result of

```
./sage -R --version # version of sage's R
R --version # system R
./sage -c 'import rpy2; print(rpy2.__version__)' # sages rpy version
./sage -c 'from rpy2.rinterface import R_VERSION_BUILD; print(R_VERSION_BUILD)' # the R sages rpy was build with
```

That was just my assumption, I never checked to be honest.

Well some of that information wasn't entirely clear before and for others I didn't know where you got them. Now we're both on the same page.

Seems like I jumped to conclusions and misclassified the problem. The correct R seems to be used. Although I see no mention of `RHOMES` anywhere in the rpy2 code while `RHOME` is supposed to be the "R Installation Directory", so I don't know how it actually picked the correct one before.

What headline do you get when you execute `help('c')` within `sage -R`? "Combine Values into a Vector or List" or "Combining Objects"?

Thats weird. The only reason I can think of is the one François already hinted to. Somehow there may be multiple help pages for `c`.

> I begin to think that #26596 was a mistake.

To qualify : R is a complex beast ; most notably, it offers some "interactive" abilities (e. g. finding a data point from a plot by clicking on it), which **I** don't use regularly, but *might* be used by *some* Sage users.

Similarly, I know that (some) packages among the 13473 packages available as of this morning do engage in interaction with the users through widgets (e. g. Tcl/Tk), menus, dialog boxes, etc... 

As far as I can tell, using `rpy2` (which entails "batch mode") loses these abilities. Therefore, Sage's R can't replace system's R for these uses.

I haven't the foggiest idea of the importance of these abilities for Sage's R users. Similarly, testing the 13474 available packages for usability with Sage's R seems undoable.

The only way out I can see *presently* is to
* remove Sage's R,
* depend on system's R,
* disclaim usability of "interactive" R functions from Sage,
which furthermore opens the nightmare of maintaining compatibility across versions.

ISTR that Erik Bray "had ideas" about how to do that.

Thoughts ?

Do you have any concrete example of some feature that worked before but doesn't work now?

It was already "batch mode" before. Now it uses the C interface that R provides instead of parsing the REPL output, which is much more robust.

I don't see how any of these options would improve anything.

That nightmare is *exactly* the point of #26596.

In my opinion any known issue that may cause test failures for some users should be a blocker. Test failures in a released sage version should always indicate that there is a real, not already reported issue.

This is very low severity, but if we can't solve it before release (waiting on @EmmanuelCharpentier's reply to my last post) I suggest that we at least mark the test as a known failure.

I think, if nothing else, the tests could be marked as known failures on the relevant system using #26784, which still needs review (annoyingly, considering that when I first raised the suggestion as a solution to a different problem Volker gave me "two days" to implement it as though that problem were high priority; I did it in one day and yet two weeks later...)

[ Snip... ]

> This is very low severity, but if we can't solve it before release (waiting on @EmmanuelCharpentier's reply to my last post) I suggest that we at least mark the test as a known failure.

Sorry : this one slipped from my queue.

What worries me is that we introduce two distinct behaviours (using the interpreter and using the interactive interface to the library) without documenting the difference (which used to be irrelevant).

For example, in the "help" failures, we have a problem because the old expect interface happened to select whatever was available in an "empty" interpreter (implicitly launched by the interface), whereas our library call picks (the first available answer in installed packages (installation dependent).

We should :
* document this behaviour
* specify how to select the package containing the function we wissh help about
* use this mechanism to specify explicitly the relevant library argument ("base", in our case) and test agaist this specific  help text.

Furthermore, we should be aware of the possibility of such surprises. I do not see a way to search systematically for them. But I still think we should document te possibility of such surprises.

The new R interface also effectively runs the equivalent to an interpreter internally.
