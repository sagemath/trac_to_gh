`sage.algebras.lie_algebras.morphism.LieAlgebraHomset` does not have the same unique behavior as Hom. A minimal example:

```
sage: from sage.algebras.lie_algebras.morphism import LieAlgebraHomset
sage: L = LieAlgebra(QQ,1,abelian=True)
sage: LieAlgebraHomset(L,L) == LieAlgebraHomset(L,L)
True
sage: LieAlgebraHomset(L,L) is LieAlgebraHomset(L,L)
False
```

This causes an issue with pickling for `LieAlgebraHomomorphism_im_gens`. Running

```python
L.<X> = LieAlgebra(QQ,1,abelian=True)
f = LieAlgebraHomomorphism_im_gens(LieAlgebraHomset(L,L),[X])
f._test_pickling()
```
outputs

```
RuntimeError: There is a bug in the coercion code in Sage.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

This is actually the correct behavior I believe. Part of the reason is that `Hom` already does the caching:

```
sage: Hom(L,L) is Hom(L,L)
True
```
The other is that `*Homset` should (in principle) work with something that is not a `UniqueRepresentation`, in which case it should not support that UR behavior.

Yes, it is subtle, and I am not completely sure it is properly documented. However, it is what should be happening and you should be using `Hom` to construct the homset.
