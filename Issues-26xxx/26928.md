Why is this a bug? ZZ is an iterable, as you can see from

```
sage: I=iter(ZZ)
sage: [next(I) for i in [1..10]]
[0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4, 5]
```
so the user is asking to construct a matrix with one row and countably infinitely many columns. If there would be a way to tell that an iterator is infinite, we could raise an error, but python does not provide such functionality (thanks to the stopping problem).
