Why is this a bug? ZZ is an iterable, as you can see from

```
sage: I=iter(ZZ)
sage: [next(I) for i in [1..10]]
[0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4, 5]
```
so the user is asking to construct a matrix with one row and countably infinitely many columns. If there would be a way to tell that an iterator is infinite, we could raise an error, but python does not provide such functionality (thanks to the stopping problem). We can't really do anything about this. It does seem appropriate that `matrix` accepts an iterable that produces iterables.
