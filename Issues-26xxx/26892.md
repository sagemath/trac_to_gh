This should have a better error message:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: int(x)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

     63             return int(self.constant_coefficient())

     66 
     67     def __long__(self):

Apart from this, the conversion to `ZZ` and `QQ` is changed to not rely on strings (there is no reason for that!).
