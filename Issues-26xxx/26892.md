This should have a better error message:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: int(x)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-7-acaae37f5ab0> in <module>()
----> 1 int(x)

/usr/local/src/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx in sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial.MPolynomial.__int__ (build/cythonized/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.c:4326)()
     63             return int(self.constant_coefficient())
     64         else:
---> 65             raise TypeError
     66 
     67     def __long__(self):

TypeError: 
```

Apart from this, the conversion to `ZZ` and `QQ` is changed to not rely on strings (there is no reason for that!).
