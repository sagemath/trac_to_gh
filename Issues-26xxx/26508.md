We need to refactor Parallelogram polyominoes by moving all drawing tools present in sage/combinat/parallelogram_polyomino.py into a new 
class DrawingTool inside sage/misc/tikz.py.

This class have to merge all drawing tools coming from parallelogram_polyomino.py and all drawing tools coming from 
the package TikzPicture of sebastien labbe.

For example, if you install that package with sage -pip install slabbe, and if you use ParallelogramPolyomino to test the package, you may do :

```
sage: L = [[0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]]
sage: pp = ParallelogramPolyomino(L)
sage: from slabbe import TikzPicture
sage: TikzPicture(latex(pp)).pdf()
'[...]/62669/tikz_mZXN3H.pdf'
```

See Ticket #16110 for more informations about ParallelogramPolyominoes refactorisation.
