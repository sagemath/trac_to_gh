Currently, the coercion model still partially supports old-style Python 2 division. In some places, old division is mapped to true division but not everywhere.

Instead, this ticket simplifies the situation by always treating `Element.__div__` as `Element.__truediv__` (both for the base class `Element` and subclasses) and then removing all special cases for old-style division from the coercion model.

Yes, that's the assumption. Users are expected to write

```
a / b
```
instead of

```
coercion_model.bin_op(a, b, operator.div)
```

As you can see from the patch, there were a few places in Sage explicitly calling `coercion_model.bin_op(a, b, operator.div)`, so those had to be fixed.

Even then, `coercion_model.bin_op(a, b, operator.div)` won't break completely: it will still coerce to a common parent and perform the division there. It will just break special cases for division (such as division of a polynomial by a constant).

Any third-party code impacted by this would also break in Python 3 if it implements `__div__` differently from `__truediv__`.
