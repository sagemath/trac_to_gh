As pointed out in [#24784 comment:4](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/24784#comment:4), the `search_doc` and `search_src` functions, when run in the legacy Sage Notebook, produce HTML-formatted results, with working links to all the doc pages/source code containing search hits.

However, the Jupyter Notebook just displays the plain-text search results.  As I pointed out in #24784, it is possible to return HTML-formatted results to Jupyter as well, in a mime-bundle.  Jupyter will then determine which format to use depending on the context: plain text, or HTML, with a preference for HTML in the notebook.

This is easily fixed as demonstrated in the fix for #24784, but there are a few problems with the current HTML result formatting:

1. Most importantly, it produces URLs to search results that only work in the legacy notebook (which has its own URLs for hosting the Sage docs).  ~~Instead, I would propose that it produce links to doc.sagemath.org by default, but also have an optional `offline=True` option to produce `file:///` URLs if the docs are available offline.  The reason for making `offline=False` by default is that when running the Jupyter Notebook in a cloud-based setting, such as mybinder.org, producing `file:///` links would not be useful.~~ As mentioned below, we don't need this because we can serve the docs through `/kernelspec/sagemath/doc`.  However, this should probably still check that the docs are installed locally so that they can be served by Jupyter.  If not, it would still make sense to fall back on doc.sagemath.org.

2. The HTML that is currently output is very "web 1.0", using tags and features that are deprecated in HTML5.  The output could easily be updated to modern HTML5 + CSS.

3. The output is also not very helpful.  It simply displays links to the documentation pages in which results were found, but does not display the search results themselves.  It would be easy, for each document in which there are results, to display the result snippets inline, perhaps with the search terms highlighted.

4. When linking to Sphinx docs it would also be good to include the `highlight=` query string parameter, in order to highlight the search term(s) in the page.
