- avoid a graph copy in each method
- clean the file (PEP8)

What remains to be done:
- method `all_max_clique` sorts the output list of (lists of vertices) but the vertices in each list of vertices are not sorted. We could instead return a `Set` of `Sets` of vertices or just remove the sorting or ...
