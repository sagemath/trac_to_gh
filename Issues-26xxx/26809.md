1.

```
+        if not StandardPermutations_n_abstract.__contains__(self, x):
```
Is it possible to user super here? (If so, I think this is the Pythonic way to do.)

2.

```
+        x = self.element_class(self, x)
```
I would write here `x = self(x)` as I think it is not guaranteed that the other works. (This comment is made from a general point of view how parent/elements are usually implemented. I have not looked at the particular implementation relevant for this code.)

3.

```
-        StandardPermutations_avoiding_generic.__init__(self, n, Permutations()([1, 2]))
+        StandardPermutations_avoiding_generic.__init__(self, n, (Permutations()([1, 2]),))
```
vs

```
-        super(StandardPermutations_avoiding_312, self).__init__(n, Permutations()([3, 1, 2]))
+        super(StandardPermutations_avoiding_312, self).__init__(n, (Permutations()([3, 1, 2]),))
```
Can one use super everywhere?

Apart from this, LGTM

I would avoid changing explicit base class calls to `super` unless there is a good reason to do so as it is a needless change.\n\nAlso `self.element_class(self, x)` is usually what `self(x)` eventually calls for combinatorial objects because coercion/conversion does not play any role.

This could eventually raise an error if we end up adding checks:

```
        x = self(x)
        return all(x.avoids(p) for p in self.a)
```
I think you should make `x` be a generic `Permutations()(x)`.

A better way `if len(a) == 0:` changed to `if not a:`.

`@`dkernn `super` is not (more) pythonic than directly calling the base class. You lose explicitness but gain by taking the direct superclass (so it reflects changes in the MRO if you insert a new class between itself and the base). I would avoid changing explicit base class calls to `super` unless there is a good reason to do so as it is a needless change.

Also `self.element_class(self, x)` is usually what `self(x)` eventually calls for combinatorial objects because coercion/conversion does not play any role. In this case, it is guaranteed to work by how the code is currently implemented (and the check above). Yet, in this case it is not necessarily so future-proof.

You have already done them, then it is fine. However, I am pointing out that it is not a good change to enforce.

Yes.

But now it is again quite inconsistent as there is a couple of times `super` and a couple of times not.

True, but in this case, one cannot guarantee that `x` has already the correct parent, therefore `self(x)`.

The parent and type of `x` is irrelevant. The fact that it is valid input is what is important.
