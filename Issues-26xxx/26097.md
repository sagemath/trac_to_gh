CC:  @embray

In `link.py`:
- regions(): use of a sorted list instead of a set for available_segments to have the same result in py2 and py3.

- _directions_of_edges(): Modify doctest to display results in the same order in py2 and py3.

Note to reviewer : As i am not an expert in knots theory please ensure that the new results of `region()` are correct.

Also note that

```
                    if a in available_segments:
                        available_segments.remove(a)
```
might be slower than before. Tell me if the performance impact is negligible or if i should use another algorithm.

Nice ! I was currently on the `connected_components()` problem ( and have not think of just avoiding the `sort()`).

That being said it look like these two tickets can be automatically merged.

I think that the problem with doctests having a dictionary as result should rather be fixed globally in the doctest framework.

IIRC just a plain dict is generally not a problem because its repr is already pprinted in ipython.  It's only a problem if the keys are heterogeneous.

It might be something on your branch because i still get `_directions_of_edges` doctests error with sage version 8.4.beta2.


```
$ sage -t --long src/sage/knots/link.py

   3 of   7 in sage.knots.link.Link._directions_of_edges

True, that one might be just luck, because I'm not sure why it would appear "fixed" otherwise.  However, normally a plain dict as output should not be a problem--in this case it might fail only because it's a tuple of dicts.  I *think* it would work if the tests were changed to something (which I find more instructive anyways) like:

```
sage: tails, heads = L._directions_of_edges()
sage: tails
...
sage: heads
...
```

in other words, printing each dict individually should work.

Sadly, if i am not missing something, it doesn't : 

Py2

```
sage: L = Link([[1, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 1, 4]])
sage: tails, heads = L._directions_of_edges()
sage: tails
{1: [2, 3, 1, 4], 2: [1, 3, 2, 4], 3: [1, 3, 2, 4], 4: [2, 3, 1, 4]}
sage: heads
{1: [1, 3, 2, 4], 2: [2, 3, 1, 4], 3: [2, 3, 1, 4], 4: [1, 3, 2, 4]}
```

Py3

```
...
sage: tails
{2: [1, 3, 2, 4], 1: [2, 3, 1, 4], 3: [1, 3, 2, 4], 4: [2, 3, 1, 4]}
sage: heads
{2: [2, 3, 1, 4], 1: [1, 3, 2, 4], 3: [2, 3, 1, 4], 4: [1, 3, 2, 4]}
```

Anyway i think your idea of printing each dict separately is better than having a `for` loop.

Maybe it's ipython version dependent. I will check that.

I don't think that's it.  I think it may just be that the doctests don't pass through the IPython output formatting.  Perhaps they should.

Yes.

Or the problem can be that ipython's lib.pretty is not consistent between py2 and py3 :

In py3

```
sage: from IPython.lib.pretty import pprint
sage: pprint(tails)
{2: [1, 3, 2, 4], 1: [2, 3, 1, 4], 3: [1, 3, 2, 4], 4: [2, 3, 1, 4]}
sage: from pprint import pprint
sage: pprint(tails)
{1: [2, 3, 1, 4], 2: [1, 3, 2, 4], 3: [1, 3, 2, 4], 4: [2, 3, 1, 4]}
```

In Py2

```
sage: from IPython.lib.pretty import pprint
sage: pprint(tails)
{1: [2, 3, 1, 4], 2: [1, 3, 2, 4], 3: [1, 3, 2, 4], 4: [2, 3, 1, 4]}
sage: from pprint import pprint
sage: pprint(tails)
{1: [2, 3, 1, 4], 2: [1, 3, 2, 4], 3: [1, 3, 2, 4], 4: [2, 3, 1, 4]}

I don't really like this as is, but okay.

I didn't realize that IPython wasn't using the standard `pprint.pprint`.  If its `pprint` is broken on Python 3 we should fix that.
