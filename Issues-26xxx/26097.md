```
In `link.py`:
- regions(): use of a sorted list instead of a set for available_segments to have the same result in py2 and py3.

- _directions_of_edges(): Modify doctest to display results in the same order in py2 and py3.

Note to reviewer : As i am not an expert in knots theory please ensure that the new results of `region()` are correct.

Also note that

```
                    if a in available_segments:
                        available_segments.remove(a)
```
might be slower than before. Tell me if the performance impact is negligible or if i should use another algorithm.

Nice ! I was currently on the `connected_components()` problem ( and have not think of just avoiding the `sort()`).

That being said it look like these two tickets can be automatically merged.

It might be something on your branch because i still get `_directions_of_edges` doctests error with sage version 8.4.beta2.


```
$ sage -t --long src/sage/knots/link.py

Sadly, if i am not missing something, it doesn't : 

Py2

```
sage: L = Link([[1, 3, 2, 4], [2, 3, 1, 4]])
sage: tails, heads = L._directions_of_edges()
sage: tails
{1: [2, 3, 1, 4], 2: [1, 3, 2, 4], 3: [1, 3, 2, 4], 4: [2, 3, 1, 4]}
sage: heads
{1: [1, 3, 2, 4], 2: [2, 3, 1, 4], 3: [2, 3, 1, 4], 4: [1, 3, 2, 4]}
```

Py3

```
...
sage: tails
{2: [1, 3, 2, 4], 1: [2, 3, 1, 4], 3: [1, 3, 2, 4], 4: [2, 3, 1, 4]}
sage: heads
{2: [2, 3, 1, 4], 1: [1, 3, 2, 4], 3: [2, 3, 1, 4], 4: [1, 3, 2, 4]}
```

Anyway i think your idea of printing each dict separately is better than having a `for` loop.

Or the problem can be that ipython's lib.pretty is not consistent between py2 and py3 :

In py3

```
sage: from IPython.lib.pretty import pprint

sage: from IPython.lib.pretty import pprint
sage: pprint(tails)
