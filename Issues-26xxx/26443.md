I see your point. So a conversion in general is difficult.

However, we could focus on (special) coercions (in contrast to conversions): If we have two bases `A` and `B` where `B` has a coercion map from `A`, then `B.extensions(f, 'i')` should have a coercion map from `A.extension(f, 'i')` for I guess all `f`.

<a id='comment:6'></a>What you ask for is not a well defined operation! The answer could equally be `i` or `-i`. You should specify what you actually want.

The current (clean but tedious) way to do it is

```
sage: K = CyclotomicField(3).extension(x^2+1, 'i')
sage: L = QQ.extension(x^2+1, 'i')
sage: f = Hom(L, K)([K.gen()])
sage: f
Ring morphism:
  From: Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
  To:   Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 over its base field
  Defn: i |--> i
sage: f(L.gen())
