I see your point. So a conversion in general is difficult.

However, we could focus on (special) coercions (in contrast to conversions): If we have two bases `A` and `B` where `B` has a coercion map from `A`, then `B.extensions(f, 'i')` should have a coercion map from `A.extension(f, 'i')` for I guess all `f`.

While working on polyhedron over algebraic numbers, we struggled around something that might (or not) be related. But in anycase is something similar.

vdelecroix might have good pointers about this.

What you ask for is not a well defined operation! The answer could equally be `i` or `-i`. You should specify what you actually want.

The current (clean but tedious) way to do it is

```
sage: K = CyclotomicField(3).extension(x^2+1, 'i')
sage: L = QQ.extension(x^2+1, 'i')
sage: f = Hom(L, K)([K.gen()])
sage: f
Ring morphism:
  From: Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
  To:   Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 over its base field
  Defn: i |--> i
sage: f(L.gen())
i
```
