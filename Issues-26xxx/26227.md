search_doc currently imports stuff from sage_setup, which shouldn't be needed by sage at runtime. It also relies on the sage doc source to be present, which is not necessarily true for distro packages.
This patch replaces the current exhaustive check that all translated docs have been built by a simple check that $SAGE_DOC/html exists.

Using sources at runtime is forbidden but testing is ideally run before install time and certainly before packaging for binary distro. We don't expect users installing binary packages to be able to run the test suite. Apart from some rare cases it is just not present to be run anyway.

So relying on SAGE_DOC_SRC at testing is fine. Nevertheless there is a general feeling that the list of language may belong to env.py rather than somewhere in sage_setup. Something more satisfactory could be constructed there.

There are many moving parts and I am considering giving it a shot from the current branch and some thinking time.

So if the doctests should pass without access to those, you need\n\n- sensible versions of the variables,\n- and a way to detect when those sensible versions are no longer sensible (because someone has translated the tutorial to Arabic, for example).\n\nIf you don't care about doctests passing, or if you only care about doctests passing if you have intact `SAGE_DOC_SRC` and `sage_setup`, then it doesn't need to be as complicated. (References to `sage_setup` could be avoided, but I think you need `SAGE_DOC_SRC`.) Since some people want to distribute Sage without any built documentation and have it pass doctests, I don't know what is reasonable to require for doctests to pass. Maybe that's where the discussion should start: under what circumstances should doctests pass?\n\nDoes it at least make sense to have a separate function (as in my branch) that just tests whether the documentation is built, along with a doctest?",

To really test whether the built documentation is present, you need access to `SAGE_DOC_SRC` and `sage_setup` to compile the lists of languages and documents. So if the doctests should pass without access to those, you need

- sensible versions of the variables,
- and a way to detect when those sensible versions are no longer sensible (because someone has translated the tutorial to Arabic, for example).

If you don't care about doctests passing, or if you only care about doctests passing if you have intact `SAGE_DOC_SRC` and `sage_setup`, then it doesn't need to be as complicated. (References to `sage_setup` could be avoided, but I think you need `SAGE_DOC_SRC`.) Since some people want to distribute Sage without any built documentation and have it pass doctests, I don't know what is reasonable to require for doctests to pass. Maybe that's where the discussion should start: under what circumstances should doctests pass?

Does it at least make sense to have a separate function (as in my branch) that just tests whether the documentation is built, along with a doctest?

Yes, I hadn't gone as far as thinking of a new function when I brought you the idea of doctesting but it make sense for it to exist and to be the thing tested. The only issue I may have is: "is it useful to have this available at runtime?" Which then turns into where is it appropriate to put this.

I don't agree with this. Binary packages have a different folder structure than the one in sage-the-distribution and it's important to make sure that everything works as intended, and the way to check that is by running the test suite, and it needs to be done when the package is installed and the source files are no longer available.

We do define SAGE_DOC_SRC because it is still required by Sage at runtime (ideally it shouldn't). For us, simply checking whether $SAGE_DOC/html is present would be enough.

Sorry for the delay. My job had to take priority over the last few days. It seems like arojas and timokau have a different concept of what should be tested and when compared to me and I suspect Debian. That is unexpected but not a show stopper to me. People should be able to do what they think they need to do unless it is outrageous in some ways.

I would totally be in favor of John's last proposal. Rip this particular code and check whether the (or some) documentation is available when searching.
