Because sage-on-gentoo doesn't use `GAP_DIR` we are exposed to a code path that is not doctested and that fails with python3.

I am not sure how to write that doctest. To test this properly we have to start a new instance of sage with `GAP_ROOT_DIR` set to wrong value and then call `gap_root`. I cannot seem to change the value inside of sage in a way that sticks until the `gap_root` call.

I'm not wild about the fact that this will just crash with a not-so-useful exception if the file is not found, or the line being searched for in that file is not found.  But that was the case before this ticket as well so it's fine.  I just thought that was worth pointing out.
