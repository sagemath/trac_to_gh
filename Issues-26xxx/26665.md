This breaks for me because I set `GAP_ROOT_DIR` in `sage-env` which is sourced on `sage` startup. As far as I understand that is how `sage-env` and `GAP_ROOT_DIR` are intended to be used, so the doctest should be changed. Also I would expect this test to add significant overhead for little gain, since it has to go through the whole sage startup.
