The `normaliz` backend will soon accept number fields as base ring and this computation will take much less time, see #25097.

Once it is possible, I suggest to specify the backend `normaliz` with `exact=True` in the test...

I agree with this overall, but I would say you should have all 3 tests (`exact=False`, `exact=True` with `# long time`, and `exact=True` with `# optional - normaliz`) for good coverage.

Once #25097, you could have `exact=None`, which checks if `normaliz` is installed and does the exact if it is and the inexact if not. However, for now, I would again suggest staying with `exact=False` as the default.
