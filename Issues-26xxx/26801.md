Many doctests are failing in Python 3 due to the operation `neighbor_label.sort()` in method `init_short_digraph` of `static_sparse_graph.pyx`.

In the `short_digraph` data structure, the neighbors of a vertex are sorted by increasing integer value. This can be useful for some algorithms... 

`neighbor_label` is a list of tuples `(int, object)` used only when edges are labeled and that we want to store these labels. Clearly, when the graph has no multiple edges, is suffices to sort `neighbor_label` according the integer values. When the graph has multiple edges, there is so far no need for sorting the labels of the edges between a given pair of vertices, and furthermore no assumption is documented on this ordering.
Also, this patch changes the sorting to sort using the integer values only.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Applying this patch over 8.5.beta6 compiled for Python3, we reduce the number of failing doctests in `connectivity.pyx` from 49 to 5. The files for which progresses are observed are:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 119.6 src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py  # 77 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 119.6 src/sage/graphs/connectivity.pyx  # 5 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 119.6 src/sage/graphs/digraph.py  # 8 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 119.6 src/sage/graphs/base/graph_backends.pyx  # 1 doctest failed
```
Without this patch, we get

```
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py  # 78 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/connectivity.pyx  # 49 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/digraph.py  # 15 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/base/graph_backends.pyx  # 5 doctests failed
