<div id="comment:0"></div>

The PARI "clone" functionality is pretty close to what `deepcopy_to_python_heap()` does. Since it's handling PARI objects anyway, it makes sense to use the PARI `gclone()` functionality too.

That is what cypari2 will do starting from version 2.0, so for consistency `element_pari_ffelt` should do that too.

We also add a few minor unrelated changes:

- The signature of `construct_from` is changed from `void ... except *` to `int ... except -1` to have more efficient error checking.

- Redundant Cython typing such as `FiniteFieldElement_pari_ffelt self` is removed.

- The `__pari__` and `_repr_` methods no longer call `sig_on()`.
