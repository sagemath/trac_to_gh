As pointed out in https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43964/how-to-attach-a-simple-sage-script-in-a-sage-jupyter-notebook/, trying to use `attach()` in a Jupyter Notebook results in just an error message:

```
UsageError: Invalid GUI request 'sage', valid ones are:[None, 'widget', 'qt5', 'qt', 'nbagg', 'osx', 'gtk', 'qt4', 'gtk3', 'notebook', 'tk', 'ipympl', 'inline', 'asyncio', 'wx']
```

I was able to confirm this even with a trivial `.sage` file.

I suspect `attach()` can be implemented without breaking any other inputhooks.

Component: **notebook**
