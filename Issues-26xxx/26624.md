Done here:
- small change in `__eq__` to avoid testing twice edge `(i, j)` if the edge iterator gives edges in random order.
- remove `.vertices()` from `_bit_vector`. This is safe as `graph6` and `dig6` format only ensure that the string encodes a graph isomorphic to the original graph.
- some alignments and PEP8.
