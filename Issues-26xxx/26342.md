Maximum recursion depth can be reached when applying the `spqr_tree` method on large graphs. We improve the code by avoiding recursive calls.

This is a follow up to #25598.

I did some trivial Cythonization (declaring obvious variable types), and I also did a bunch of doc improvements/standardizations (although almost all of them you cannot see because they are private methods). It is not surprising that my little Cythonization will make for great speed improvements, it is more of setup for the bigger overhaul (which rightly should be on a separate ticket). If my changes are good, then you can set a positive review.

Your branch:

Thank you Travis for the improvements. I will to do more Cythonization (e.g., using arrays instead of lists, turn the doubly linked list to some C/C++ data structure, etc.) in other tickets. The number of methods without doctest should also be reduced (to 0), which is not obvious for some internal methods. One step at a time ;)
