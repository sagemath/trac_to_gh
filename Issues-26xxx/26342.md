This is a follow up to #25598.

I did some trivial Cythonization (declaring obvious variable types), and I also did a bunch of doc improvements/standardizations (although almost all of them you cannot see because they are private methods). It is not surprising that my little Cythonization will make for great speed improvements, it is more of setup for the bigger overhaul (which rightly should be on a separate ticket). If my changes are good, then you can set a positive review.

8.4.beta6:

```
sage: G = graphs.JankoKharaghaniGraph(936)
sage: (G.order(), G.size())
(936, 175500)
sage: %time T = G.spqr_tree()
CPU times: user 6.22 s, sys: 96 ms, total: 6.32 s
Wall time: 6.3 s
```
Your branch:

```
sage: %time T = G.spqr_tree()
CPU times: user 6.38 s, sys: 108 ms, total: 6.49 s
Wall time: 6.45 s
```
My branch

```
sage: %time T = G.spqr_tree()
CPU times: user 6.27 s, sys: 124 ms, total: 6.4 s
Wall time: 6.34 s
```
