Inspiration this [ask.sagemath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/44077/indefinite-integral-is-incorrect/) question.**Edit:** [this one](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45245/why-gives-a-wrong-result/) seems to be another instance of the same problem.

A lot of tickets describe indefinite integral bugs attributable to `maxima`, most notably its `abs_integrate` package ; see #12731 for a sample of the latter, and the [list](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics#Integrationtickets) of integration tickets for somother infamous examples...

However, Sage, which is becoming a mature system, seems to have become able to screw up things by itself on its own, without any external help. Case in point :

```
sage: elliptic_e(x,1/2).diff(x)
sqrt(-1/2*sin(x)^2 + 1)
```

* Maxima can't solve the reverse problem, but will honestly report its failure  :

```
sage: maxima.integrate(sqrt(1-m*sin(x)^2),x).sage()
integrate(sqrt(-m*sin(x)^2 + 1), x)

```
* Sage will lie ;-) :

```
sage: integrate(sqrt(1-m*sin(x)^2),x)
1/4*m*x - 1/8*m*sin(2*x)
```
which is wrong, //wrong//, **wrong**...

I think that this actually is due to `abs_integrate`:

```
(%i1) integrate(sqrt(1-m*sin(x)^2),x);
                           /
                           [               2
(%o1)                      I sqrt(1 - m sin (x)) dx
                           ]
                           /
(%i2) load(abs_integrate);
ARRSTORE: use_fast_arrays=false; allocate a new property hash table for $INTABLE2
(%o2) sage-develop/local/share/maxima/5.41.0/share/contrib/integration/abs_integrate.mac
(%i3) integrate(sqrt(1-m*sin(x)^2),x);
                    2 m sin(2 x) false - m sin(2 x) + 2 m x
(%o3)               ---------------------------------------
                                       8
```
(although it's quite interesting what sage does with the result...)

What about the time it takes ? Do we really need this doctest ?

In this case the point of the test is that maxima "fails to integrate it incorrectly," after which sympy produces the correct result. When maxima returns a wrong answer (rather than giving up), sympy is never tried and we just return the wrong thing. Maxima gives up quickly, but the rest of the time spent in the doctest is just sympy performing the integral and getting the right answer.

I'm fine if we want to leave this doctest out. I was just trying to help close out an old ticket by providing a test that shows that it's fixed.

(And in general, if you ever want to propose that we go back and delete all of the "fixed in a new version of $package" doctests, I'd be all for it. I already run the test suites for maxima, pari, flint, etc. and don't need to test for those bugs all over again when I build sage.)
