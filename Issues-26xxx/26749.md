```
In Sage 8.3 to 9.0, `factorial` chokes if fed a float argument:

```
sage: factorial(float(3.2))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'gamma'
```

We change the numerical evaluation so it will accept a float argument.

With this ticket:

```
sage: factorial(float(3.2))
7.756689535793181
```

As a consequence, `factorial(x)` can be plotted again -- as gamma(x + 1).

Don't mask errors. By putting a whole statement in a bare "try/except" you make it very hard to debug the code, because *any* error that gets raised will now be masked by "ArithmeticError". 

Note that `gamma(x+1).plot()` works just fine, so what `factorial(x).plot()` tries to do could just be fine. If you absolutely think this example needs to perform better then the way that `factorial` tries to evaluate numerical arguments should probably be adjusted.

Here you can see that the original error message is much more informative than what you suggest on this ticket: it actually tells what is going wrong and allows someone to come up with a fix. Carpeting over this very useful error message with a generic, uninformative `function cannot be plotted` is not an improvement at all.

The `factorial` function used to accept a Python float
as an argument, but no longer does. It might have to do
with the refactoring in #25421. Compare the following.

In Sage 8.2:

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 8.2, Release Date: 2018-05-05'
sage: factorial(1.2)
1.10180249087971
sage: factorial(1.2r)
1.1018024908797128
```

In Sage 8.3:

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 8.3, Release Date: 2018-08-03'
sage: factorial(1.2)
1.10180249087971
sage: factorial(1.2r)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'gamma'
```

The problem manifests itself when plotting because when
plotting a symbolic function Sage feeds it Python floats.
