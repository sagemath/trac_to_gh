Adds a simple feature for specifying test files that contain "known failures" i.e. they are expected to fail, so if they do the entire test run should not be counted as a failure (that is, it should still return 0).  This is part of a more flexible alternative to #26740.

When tests fail in a file marked as a known-failure the only difference is that in the test result summary it is noted when failures were expected, and the test runner returns 0 unless there were other unexpected failures.

If a test marked as known-failure happens to succeed unexpected this is also noted in the summary, but is not counted as a failure.

This feature is still very simplistic: all it states is that some test file is expected to fail, not *how* it is expected to fail.  That might be useful to add later for better specificity.

Known failures are also listed file-by-file; there is no support yet for marking whole directories as known-failures and/or wildcards.  Those are also possibilities for future enhancements.
