The recently introduced (#26665) doctest for gap_root (indended to test the fallback behaviour) breaks when `GAP_ROOT_DIR` gets reset as part of the sage initialization. We can just extract the fallback behaviour into a separate function instead which can be tested in isolation.

Please don't use inline imports like `import os.path` in the `gap_root` function if it isn't necessary.

This might also conflict with some of the work I'm doing in #22626.  Which is not to say I'd be opposed to fixing this issue first if it is an issue, but let me think for a sec about how that work relates to this.

That would provide a reasonable fallback at least if `GAP_ROOT_DIR` is not actually a directory or a path-like type.  Beyond that the onus is on the user for `GAP_ROOT_DIR` to actually be a sensible GAP root :)

I'm a bit torn there: There is already a default value for `GAP_ROOT_DIR` that looks like a directory, so there's no great way to tell if it was set "explicitly".  I wish there were.

Since it's your ticket I leave it up to you, though if nothing else I think the error should be caught and an exception with a more useful message raised.  I might even make it a `RuntimeError`.

> Note that the inline `import` was also already there in the previous implementation and I just copied that. I never know what is supposed to be better style in python. From a purely style perspective I prefer to keep the import local, but maybe its not properly optimized?

Ah, I missed that it was already there, but yes I would definitely clean that up.

In Python this almost always considered poor style: in part just as a semi-arbitrary stylistic choice, but also because adding an `import` statement always adds some overhead, and when it comes to core system modules it's especially pointless since they're almost always already imported; so the `import` statement might as well go at module-level where it's only evaluated once.

There are only a couple exceptions to this:

1) When some modifiable global variable needs to be imported with `from foo import BAR` that should generally not go at module-level since the value of `BAR` might change in `foo`.  For example this is why you always almost use `sys.path` and not `from sys import path`.  I think just accessing the variable through getattr on the module is better, but sometimes you'll see in Sage code things like `from sage.env import WHATEVER` at function-level, and I think that's okay.

2) Inline imports are often used to work around cases of circular imports which can break at module import-time.  I think the prevalence of this in Sage might be what has led to an overproliferation of this poor style in general throughout Sage, even where it's not needed.  This is especially less needed now in Sage with the use of `LazyImport`, which I think is a better way to get around circular import problems.
