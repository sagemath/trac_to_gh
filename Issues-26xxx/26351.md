This is to make testing tickets that include SPKG upgrades easier for developers and patchbots.

To add the `upstream_url` field, just edit `checksums.ini` or use the new option `--url` of `sage -package create`:

```
$ ./sage -package create --help
usage: sage --package create [-h] [--version VERSION] [--tarball TARBALL]
                             [--type TYPE] [--url URL]
                             [package_name]

[...]
  --tarball TARBALL  Tarball filename pattern, e.g. Foo-VERSION.tar.bz2
  --type TYPE        Package type
  --url URL          Download URL pattern, e.g. http://example.org/Foo-
                     VERSION.tar.bz2
```

The default behavior of `sage -i` is not changed: Packages are only downloaded from the Sage mirrors.

To allow downloading from the upstream URL, use `sage -i --allow-upstream SPKG`.

Example (for qepcad) at #28388.

Without this change, failed test assertions did not show enough useful information.
Now, of course, nothing fails, so these lines have no effect on the operation of sage_bootstrap.

If you want to test that this ticket works, may I suggest picking a package that needs upgrading anyway, and use the new upstream_url mechanism to do the upgrade.
