This is to make testing tickets that include SPKG upgrades easier for developers and patchbots.

To add the `upstream_url` field, just edit `checksums.ini` or use the new option `--url` of `sage -package create`:

```
$ ./sage -package create --help
usage: sage --package create [-h] [--version VERSION] [--tarball TARBALL]
                             [--type TYPE] [--url URL]
                             [package_name]

[...]
  --tarball TARBALL  Tarball filename pattern, e.g. Foo-VERSION.tar.bz2
  --type TYPE        Package type
  --url URL          Download URL pattern, e.g. http://example.org/Foo-
                     VERSION.tar.bz2
```

The default behavior of `sage -i` is not changed: Packages are only downloaded from the Sage mirrors.

To allow downloading from the upstream URL, use `sage -i --allow-upstream SPKG`.

Example (for qepcad) at #28388.

That's a good idea.  It should still be synced to our mirrors primarily, but having a canonical "original" URL (even if it's just an attachment to a trac ticket) would provide the primary source for a tarball independent of the mirrors.

Without this change, failed test assertions did not show enough useful information.
Now, of course, nothing fails, so these lines have no effect on the operation of sage_bootstrap.

If you want to test that this ticket works, may I suggest picking a package that needs upgrading anyway, and use the new upstream_url mechanism to do the upgrade.
