With python3 we currently have 40 failures of type 

```
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'KeyConvertingDict' and 'KeyConvertingDict'
```
These errors comes from the call of `V.sort()` in multi_polynomial_ideal.py", line 2381, `variety` function.

The root reason for calling `sort` is for doctest displaying :

As it will not make a lot of sense to implement comparison operators for KeyConvertingDict this ticket aim at solving the sorting problems at doctests level rather than at python source code level.

The `__repr__` called by `KeyConvertingDict` is the one inherited from python's `dict` i don't think we should override it just for doctests compatibility. I prefer to modify the doctests.

I think you mean using Ipython pretty print. I don't know why it is like it's not called by default for `KeyConvertingDict` as it is for `dict`: 

Adding some traces :

```
diff --git a/src/sage/misc/converting_dict.py b/src/sage/misc/converting_dict.py
index f9bdb17..f08e13f 100644
--- a/src/sage/misc/converting_dict.py
+++ b/src/sage/misc/converting_dict.py
@@ -140,6 +140,13 @@ class KeyConvertingDict(dict):
         key = self.key_conversion_function(key)
         return super(KeyConvertingDict, self).__setitem__(key, value)
 
+    def __repr__(self):
+        print("call __repr__")
+        return super(KeyConvertingDict, self).__repr__()
+
+    def _repr_pretty_(self, p, cycle):
+        print("pretty")
+
     def __delitem__(self, key):
         r"""
         Remove a mapping from the dictionary.
```

You get this:

```
sage: K.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: I = ideal([x^2+2*y-5,x+y+3])
sage: v = I.variety(AA)[0]; v
call __repr__
{x: 4.464101615137755?, y: -7.464101615137755?}
sage: from IPython.lib.pretty import pprint
sage: pprint(v)
pretty
```

There is still one failling test sort related to `KeyConvertingDict`: 

```
File "src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/mpoly_doctest.py", line 409, in sage.tests.books.computational-mathematics-with-sagemath.mpoly_doctest
Failed example:
    J.variety(RealField(51))
Expected:
    [{y: 396340.890166545, x: -14.1660266425312}]
Got:
    [{y: 396340.890166545, x: -35.0231212211684}]
```

The difference being the value of x i think this is out the scope of this ticket.
