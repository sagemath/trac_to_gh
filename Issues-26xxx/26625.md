Also change the command line argument from -r (run in interactive mode) to --batch-string (run in batch mode), which is what we want here. The only reason it worked before was a bug in maxima that made -r behave like batch mode [1]. This is fixed in 5.42, so using -r now makes the maxima interface hang waiting for input.

--batch-string also echoes the input, so we need to remove one more line before processing the output.

    We will not get an evaluated answer here, which is better than
    the previous (wrong) answer of zero. See :trac:`10914`::
        sage: f = abs(sin(x))
        sage: integrate(f, x, 0, 2*pi)  # long time (4s on sage.math, 2012)
        integrate(abs(sin(x)), x, 0, 2*pi)

FWIW this is the commit that breaks it

https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/801a0bb782fd09b9907a599541e1bff622ea453d

I can't decrypt what it means though, or why it breaks this test in sage but not in maxima itself.

Regarding integrals of abs(sin(x)) and related, see

- https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~abs(sin

To explore anything to do with Maxima, it's important to remember
that Sage starts Maxima by setting some defaults including `domain : complex`
and loading some packages including `abs_integrate`, leading to differences
with running Maxima on its own.

See [lines 171 to 173 in src/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/6187d261eca3c980e575b53d1a31f580ba8cfdfd/src/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py#L171)

```
init_code = ['besselexpand : true', 'display2d : false',
            'domain : complex', 'keepfloat : true',
            'load(to_poly_solve)', 'load(simplify_sum)',
            'load(abs_integrate)', 'load(diag)']
```

Bugs in Maxima can be discussed on the maxima-discuss mailing list,
always recalling these specifics of running Maxima in Sage.
