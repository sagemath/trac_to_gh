Also change the command line argument from -r (run in interactive mode) to --batch-string (run in batch mode), which is what we want here. The only reason it worked before was a bug in maxima that made -r behave like batch mode [1]. This is fixed in 5.42, so using -r now makes the maxima interface hang waiting for input.

--batch-string also echoes the input, so we need to remove one more line before processing the output.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Regarding integrals of abs(sin(x)) and related, see

- https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~abs(sin

To explore anything to do with Maxima, it's important to remember
that Sage starts Maxima by setting some defaults including `domain : complex`
and loading some packages including `abs_integrate`, leading to differences
with running Maxima on its own.

See [lines 171 to 173 in src/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/6187d261eca3c980e575b53d1a31f580ba8cfdfd/src/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py#L171)

```
init_code = ['besselexpand : true', 'display2d : false',
            'domain : complex', 'keepfloat : true',
            'load(to_poly_solve)', 'load(simplify_sum)',
            'load(abs_integrate)', 'load(diag)']
```

Bugs in Maxima can be discussed on the maxima-discuss mailing list,
always recalling these specifics of running Maxima in Sage.
