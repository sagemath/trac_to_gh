# Issue 26379: Comparisons between p-adics are quite slow

Compare:

```
sage: R = Zp(2)
sage: zero = R(0)
sage: elt = R.random_element()
sage: %timeit _ = (elt == zero)
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit _ = elt.is_zero()
10000000 loops, best of 3: 80.7 ns per loop
```

The reason is that the operator `==` calls the generic method `_cmp_` in `padic_generic_element.pyx`. The first statement of this method computes the minimum of the valuation of the arguments. Since `zero` has infinite valuation, the coercion system is activated and `elt` is converted to a finite positive element in `InfiniteRing`. More than 99% of the time is spent in the constructor of `InfiniteRing`.

Since python 3 no longer supports `_cmp_`, it's probably the good time to remove this method and implement (fast) rich comparison for p-adic elements.
