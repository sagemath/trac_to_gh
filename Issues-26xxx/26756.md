Here we take care only of hex and long.

The changes to `LazyImport` are not right.  I agree with *not* using the `hex()` and `oct()` built-ins here.  Rather, it should just pass to `self.get_object.__hex__()` and `__oct__()` respectively; there's no guarantee that the proxied object has `.oct()` or `.hex()` methods.

This is meant to be pretty a pretty generic proxy class (in fact I have a ticket I would like to revive sometime where I reimplement this on an existing proxy library for Python: #22793).

Hello Erik. Glad to see you back. Would you please look at #26740 ?

Here are the only remaining `__hex__` in sage:

```
chapoton@pc-chapoton:~/sage$ git grep "def __hex__(" src/sage
src/sage/libs/ntl/ntl_GF2X.pyx:    def __hex__(self):
src/sage/misc/lazy_import.pyx:    def __hex__(self):
src/sage/rings/integer.pyx:    def __hex__(self):
src/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx:    def __hex__(self):
```
and we also have

```
src/sage/libs/ntl/ntl_GF2X.pyx:    def hex(ntl_GF2X self):
src/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx:    def hex(self):
```
I think the `__hex__` should all disappear. In python3, `hex` call the `__index__` method.

That's a good point.  You could also leave `__hex__` and `__oct__` as they were previously, but they should be bracketed with a Cython-level if like `IF PY_MAJOR_VERSION < 3:`.
