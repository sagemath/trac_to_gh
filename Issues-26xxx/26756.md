This is meant to be pretty a pretty generic proxy class (in fact I have a ticket I would like to revive sometime where I reimplement this on an existing proxy library for Python: #22793).

<a id='comment:5'></a>Hello Erik. Glad to see you back. Would you please look at #26740 ?

Here are the only remaining `__hex__` in sage:

```
chapoton@pc-chapoton:~/sage$ git grep "def __hex__(" src/sage
src/sage/libs/ntl/ntl_GF2X.pyx:    def __hex__(self):
src/sage/misc/lazy_import.pyx:    def __hex__(self):
src/sage/rings/integer.pyx:    def __hex__(self):
src/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx:    def __hex__(self):
```
and we also have

```
src/sage/libs/ntl/ntl_GF2X.pyx:    def hex(ntl_GF2X self):
src/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx:    def hex(self):
```
I think the `__hex__` should all disappear. In python3, `hex` call the `__index__` method.
