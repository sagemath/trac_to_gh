<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
In `_cmp_c`, shouldn't we be worried about potential overflow here?

```
cdef int c = other._valuation_c() - self._valuation_c()
```
The result of `_valuation_c` is a `long` and you are downcasting that to `int`.

The easiest solution is returning a `long` in `_cmp_c`.
