Right now a group homomorphism is defined on images of the generator of the group. In gap there are many more ways to define a group homomorphism.
With this ticket a group homomorphism in sage can be created from the one in gap.

Two lines of code in the `_element_constructor_` (right above your changes) become redundant. You should remove them to avoid confusion.
Furthermore, you should adapt the description of the new argument `gap_hom` in the docstring of `GroupMorphism_libgap`.

If these things are done, you may switch to positive review.

FYI: I will create a ticket depending on this one, soon. Its purpose will be to include permutation groups within the `GroupHomset_libgap` setting.
