Two lines of code in the `_element_constructor_` (right above your changes) become redundant. You should remove them to avoid confusion.
Furthermore, you should adapt the description of the new argument `gap_hom` in the docstring of `GroupMorphism_libgap`.

If these things are done, you may switch to positive review.
