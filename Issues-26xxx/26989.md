Cython performance comment: `product()` is not optimized by Cython, so

```
for (x,y) in product(range(n),range(m)):
```
is a lot slower than a nested loop

```
cdef Py_ssize_t x, y
for x in range(n):
    for y in range(m):
```
I'm not saying that this is necessarily a big problem here, but I thought I should mention it for future reference.
