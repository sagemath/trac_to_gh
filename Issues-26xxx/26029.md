This spkg is mentioned in #14467 and was apparently "huge" (and hence optional).  But it is no longer listed under `build/pkgs` nor does it appear to be available on the download mirrors.

---

Here is a branch to convert it to a new style experimental (but, maybe optional?) package.

the tarball is the old *.spkg file, but as it's a tar file, it works

tarball url (see in checksum.ini), but it's the same as one gets
via `./sage -p polytopes_db_4d` (which still works with old style pkfs)


A few options:

1) If someone has a copy of this package we can convert it to a new-style SPKG (we will probably need to upload the tarball somewhere with enough space to host it).

Done.

The following shows sage can find packages in "huge":

```
$ sage --info polytopes_db_4d
Attempting to get on-line info for package polytopes_db_4d
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.
>>> Checking online list of experimental packages.
>>> Checking online list of huge packages.
>>> Found polytopes_db_4d-1.0
...
```

The package cannot be installed with `sage -i` because it is an "old-style SPKG"

```
$ sage -i polytopes_db_4d
...
Error: package 'polytopes_db_4d' not found
Note: if it is an old-style package, use -p instead of -i to install it
```
but `sage -p` can install "old-style spkg" packages that still work, including this one.

```
$ sage -p polytopes_db_4d
Attempting to download package polytopes_db_4d
>>> Checking online list of optional packages.
>>> Checking online list of experimental packages.
>>> Checking online list of huge packages.
>>> Found polytopes_db_4d-1.0
================================== NOTE ==================================
You are about to download and install an old-style package. While this
might still work fine, old-style packages are unmaintained and deprecated.

This package will be removed in future versions of SageMath. If you care
about this package, you should make a proper new-style package instead.
For more information about making Sage packages, see
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html
==========================================================================
Are you sure (automatically continuing in 30 seconds) [Y/n]?
```
Once this is done and after restarting Sage, one can follow the
[SageMath documentation on using the palp_database of reflexive Hodge 4-polytopes](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/discrete_geometry/sage/geometry/polyhedron/palp_database.html).
I tried it in Sage 8.4 as installed on the "k8s" CoCalc server for development,
which currently runs Ubuntu 17.04.

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 8.4, Release Date: 2018-10-17'
```

```
sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.palp_database import Reflexive4dHodge
sage: ref = Reflexive4dHodge(1, 101)
sage: next(iter(ref)).Vrepresentation()
(A vertex at (-1, -1, -1, -1),
 A vertex at (0, 0, 0, 1),
 A vertex at (0, 0, 1, 0),
 A vertex at (0, 1, 0, 0),
 A vertex at (1, 0, 0, 0))
```

As I wrote on sage-devel, perhaps it would make sense to host this data (as well as the 3D polytopes; why not?) on an online database somewhere that can be easily queried (including by the code in Sage which uses this data)?  This way it is possible to use as-needed without downloading the entire, very large database (though perhaps with the possibility of pre-downloading/caching all or parts of it as needed).

 This spkg is mentioned in #14467 and was apparently "huge" (and hence optional).  But it is no longer listed under `build/pkgs` nor does it appear to be available on the download mirrors.

+
+Here is a branch to convert it to a new style experimental (but, maybe optional?) package.
+
+the tarball is the old *.spkg file, but as it's a tar file, it works
+
+tarball url (see in checksum.ini), but it's the same as one gets
+via `./sage -p polytopes_db_4d` (which still works with old style pkfs)

 A few options:
 
 1) If someone has a copy of this package we can convert it to a new-style SPKG (we will probably need to upload the tarball somewhere with enough space to host it).
 
-2) We don't make it available as a package at all (if it is too big for the mirrors to even host it).  Instead, assuming this data is available to download somewhere online that's stable, we provide built-in functionality to download it if needed.
+Done.
