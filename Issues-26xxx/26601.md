The parallelisation of the function `a.__mul__(a)` in `src/sage/tensor/modules/comp.py` was only one test failing with `python3` in `src/sage/tensor`.
Previously, with `python2.7`, to create the partial result we used 
a list comprehension but now it fails.
We have to replace it with a for loop.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Thank you Marco!

I've checked the changes with both Python2 and Python3.
In particular, with Python3, `sage -tp --long src/sage/tensor/` returns now "All tests passed!".
