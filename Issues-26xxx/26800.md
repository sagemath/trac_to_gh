The following doctest of `petersen_family` in `families.py` fails with with Python3:

```
        sage: F1 = graphs.petersen_family(generate=False)
        sage: F2 = graphs.petersen_family(generate=True)
        sage: F1 = [g.canonical_label().graph6_string() for g in F1]
        sage: F2 = [g.canonical_label().graph6_string() for g in F2]
        sage: set(F1) == set(F2)
        True
```

Some investigation suggests that the issue comes from `canonical_label`. Consider the following example (part of the code of `petersen_family`).

```
sage: def YDeltaTrans(G, v):
....:     """
....:     Apply a Y-Delta transformation to a given vertex v of G.
....:     """
....:     G = G.copy()
....:     a, b, c = G.neighbors(v)
....:     G.delete_vertex(v)
....:     G.add_cycle([a, b, c])
....:     return G.canonical_label(algorithm='sage')
....: 
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: Q = YDeltaTrans(P, 0)
sage: for v in P:
....:     g = YDeltaTrans(P, v)
....:     print(g.graph6_string(), g.is_isomorphic(Q))
```
With Python 2, we get:

```
('HKN?Yeb', True)
('HKN?Yeb', True)
('HKN?Yeb', True)
('HKN?Yeb', True)
('HKN?Yeb', True)
('HKN?Yeb', True)
('HKN?Yeb', True)
('HKN?Yeb', True)
('HKN?Yeb', True)
('HKN?Yeb', True)
```
With Python 3, we get:

```
HleAPWU True
HlbAPWU True
Hl`BPWU True
Hl`@PwU True
Hl`@OyU True
HhdDCkM True
Hhe@IhJ True
Hhea?km True
HheQhGJ True
HheAP[U True
```
so the `canonical_label` method seems broken with Python 3.

**EDIT**: fixed by #27695

<a id='comment:5'></a>Let's summarize:

```
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: H = P.copy()
sage: a, b, c = H.neighbors(1)
sage: H.delete_vertex(1)
sage: H.add_cycle([a, b, c])
sage: H.canonical_label().graph6_string()
'HlbAPWU'
sage: H.canonical_label().canonical_label().graph6_string()
'HKN?Yeb'
```
So the canonical label works after the second application. 

**EDIT**:
But the edges are not changed:

```
sage: sorted(H.canonical_label().edges())==sorted(H.canonical_label().canonical_label().edges())
True
```

**EDIT**:
And the graphs are indeed the same

```
sage: H1 = H.canonical_label()
sage: H2 = H.canonical_label().canonical_label()
sage: H1 == H2
True
```

So the mapping `v_to_int = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(self)}` in `_bit_vector` is not the same :(

But with py2, the 2 mappings are the same.

I suspect that the order in which vertices are added to the graph is not the same. May be a loop over the keys of a dictionary as this order is not necessarily the same in py2 and in py3?
If you check method `iterator_verts` in `c_graph.pyx`, it iterates over the keys of dictionary `vertex_ints`...
