This ticket is to make JupyterLab an optional package, following #22215,
and before possibly making it a standard package, which is the object of #24904.

Note that currently one can already install it with the command:

```
$ sage --pip install jupyterlab
```
and then run it with the command:

```
$ sage -n jupyterlab
```

This drastically improves the user experience with respect to using `sage -n jupyter`.
