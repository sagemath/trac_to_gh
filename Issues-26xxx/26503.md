In Sage 8.3 we get the following (wrong) answer:

```
sage: var('t')
sage: wp = QQ[t](t^2 + t + 1).roots(QQbar)[0][0]
sage: Kw.<wp> = NumberField(wp.minpoly(), embedding=wp)
sage: R.<x,y> = Kw[]
sage: z = 1
sage: f = y * (y + (-wp - 1)) * x * (x - 1) * (x - y) * (x + (-wp - 1)*y - 1) * (x + (-wp - 1)*y + (wp))
sage: from sage.schemes.curves import zariski_vankampen as zvk
sage: zvk.fundamental_group(f)
Finitely presented group < x0, x1, x2, x3, x5 | x2*x1*x2^-1*x1^-1, x1*x0*x1^-1*x0^-1, x5*x2*x5^-1*x2^-1, x0^-1*x3*x0*x3^-1, x0^-1*x2*x0*x2^-1, x1*x3*x1^-1*x3^-1, x5^-1*x0*x5*x0^-1, x3^-1*x5*x3*x5^-1, x1*x5*x1^-1*x5^-1 >
```

It must be wrong because the abelianized must have rank 7, so it must have at least 7 generators.

Note that Sage 8.1 used to give right answers.

Anyways, I think I did find the problem. When computing the braids corresponding to each segment, the endpoints are represented by floating point numbers, which may cause some errors. Using algebraic numbers for this seems to solve the issue.

to the following, if you agree it means the same (please double check):

This combines some pep8 fixes, getting rid of a symbolic variable,
using `z` to clarify `f`, and combining two `.subs` into a single one.

Yes, but on the other hand, the other minor change I made that computes radical of the polynomial before computing the discriminant would make things faster, so overall the change could actually be faster.

Seems the order of the elements in `disc` can vary.

Maybe exactifying the elements of disc and sorting them would fix that:

```
        sage: wp = QQ['t']([1, 1, 1]).roots(QQbar)[0][0]
        sage: Kw.<wp> = NumberField(wp.minpoly(), embedding=wp)
        sage: R.<x, y> = Kw[]
        sage: z = -wp - 1
        sage: f = y*(y + z)*x*(x - 1)*(x - y)*(x + z*y - 1)*(x + z*y + wp)
        sage: from sage.schemes.curves import zariski_vankampen as zvk
        sage: g = f.subs({x: x + 2*y})
        sage: disc = zvk.discrim(g)
        sage: for a in disc: a.exactify()
        sage: disc = sorted(disc)
        sage: segs = zvk.segments(disc)
        sage: segs[16]  # abs tol 1e-16
        (0.577350269189626*I, 0.500000000000000 + 0.288675134594813*I)

So if the bug is showing up in that specific segment, perhaps the thing to do is isolate that segment, maybe by checking if that segment is in `segs` and then passing it to `braid_in_segments`?

Perhaps instead of that specific segment, we check

```
s0*s1*s3*s5*s1^-1*s0^-1*s3^-1 in [zvk.braid_in_segment(g,s) for s in segs]

This looks good now on 32bit, see https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/26503/debian/9.7/i686/4.9.0-7-686/tmonteil-debian-stretch-32/2019-03-21%2013:03:07.

There is an error for the file `src/sage/tests/books/computational-mathematics-with-sagemath/graphique_doctest.py` but it also exists for ticket 0, see https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/0/ so it is unrelated to this ticket.

There's been a lot of trial and error on this, do we want to keep all these commits?
We could squash to a single commit instead -- I'm fine either way.
