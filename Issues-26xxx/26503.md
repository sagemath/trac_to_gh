In Sage 8.3 we get the following (wrong) answer:

```
sage: var('t')
sage: wp = QQ[t](t^2 + t + 1).roots(QQbar)[0][0]
sage: Kw.<wp> = NumberField(wp.minpoly(), embedding=wp)
sage: R.<x,y> = Kw[]
sage: z = 1
sage: f = y * (y + (-wp - 1)) * x * (x - 1) * (x - y) * (x + (-wp - 1)*y - 1) * (x + (-wp - 1)*y + (wp))
sage: from sage.schemes.curves import zariski_vankampen as zvk
sage: zvk.fundamental_group(f)
Finitely presented group < x0, x1, x2, x3, x5 | x2*x1*x2^-1*x1^-1, x1*x0*x1^-1*x0^-1, x5*x2*x5^-1*x2^-1, x0^-1*x3*x0*x3^-1, x0^-1*x2*x0*x2^-1, x1*x3*x1^-1*x3^-1, x5^-1*x0*x5*x0^-1, x3^-1*x5*x3*x5^-1, x1*x5*x1^-1*x5^-1 >
```

It must be wrong because the abelianized must have rank 7, so it must have at least 7 generators.

Note that Sage 8.1 used to give right answers.

Anyways, I think I did find the problem. When computing the braids corresponding to each segment, the endpoints are represented by floating point numbers, which may cause some errors. Using algebraic numbers for this seems to solve the issue.

This combines some pep8 fixes, getting rid of a symbolic variable,
using `z` to clarify `f`, and combining two `.subs` into a single one.

Yes, but on the other hand, the other minor change I made that computes radical of the polynomial before computing the discriminant would make things faster, so overall the change could actually be faster.

Seems the order of the elements in `disc` can vary.

Maybe exactifying the elements of disc and sorting them would fix that:

```
        sage: wp = QQ['t']([1, 1, 1]).roots(QQbar)[0][0]
        sage: Kw.<wp> = NumberField(wp.minpoly(), embedding=wp)
        sage: R.<x, y> = Kw[]
        sage: z = -wp - 1
        sage: f = y*(y + z)*x*(x - 1)*(x - y)*(x + z*y - 1)*(x + z*y + wp)
        sage: from sage.schemes.curves import zariski_vankampen as zvk
        sage: g = f.subs({x: x + 2*y})
        sage: disc = zvk.discrim(g)
        sage: for a in disc: a.exactify()
        sage: disc = sorted(disc)
        sage: segs = zvk.segments(disc)
        sage: segs[16]  # abs tol 1e-16
        (0.577350269189626*I, 0.500000000000000 + 0.288675134594813*I)

Perhaps instead of that specific segment, we check

```
s0*s1*s3*s5*s1^-1*s0^-1*s3^-1 in [zvk.braid_in_segment(g,s) for s in segs]
```
I guess we could then get the index of that braid in the corresponding list and then check the segment itself (if you also want to show that output).
