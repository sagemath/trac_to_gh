Fusion algebras for WZW conformal field theories can be computed easily as instances of WeylCharacterRings. The `WeylCharacterRing` code is modified with an optional parameter k, the level. If `k==None` the behavior is unchanged. However if k is a positive integer the corresponding fusion ring is created. The reason this works is that the Kac-Walton algorithm for computing the fusion products is closely similar to the Brauer-Klimyk (aka Racah-Speiser) algorithm that is already used by the `WeylCharacterRing`. One has only to add an affine reflection to make the algorithm compute the fusion product.

I tested this for level 2 in types A2 and B2, comparing with tabulated formulas in Feingold, Fusion Rules for affine Kac-Moody algebras.

A related patch is #15485.

For fusion rings, we should have a method that returns the (finite) canonical basis as a list or an iterator. Actually `WeylCharacterRing` has a basis method that it inherits from `CombinatorialFreeModule`. 

To avoid confusion with this basis method, the method that returns the basis as a list could then be called `fusion_basis`.

So, what is the best way to enumerate all dominant weights of level `<= k`?

I am not sure I like the basis for the fusion ring being anything other than what you want to call the `fusion_basis`. More generally, I am not sure I like that the basis for `WeylCharacterRing` is not the set of dominant integral weights. Since the fusion algebra is finite-dimensional, I definite would rather have `basis` correspond to the dominant weights of level `<= k` (which we would give in the `__init__` to `CombinatorialFreeModule`).

I just constructed this as a `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`, but we could also use `WeightedIntegerVectors`. Between those two, I have not run timings to determine which is faster. Both should take 2 lines to construct (one to get the levels, one to construct the parent to iterate over).

Timing might matter if someone wants to construct a "large" rank and level example. In terms of elegance, I would say `WeightedIntegerVectors` is better and more inline with the output as sums of fundamental weights (as dense vectors).

I made the `FusionRing` explicitly construct and set its basis on initialization. One small drawback to this is that a basis has to be constructed at initialization, but it should be relatively quick to compute since it is just adding weights.

One issue I did find and fix is with type A and the ambient space not having a well-defined normalization for the fundamental weights. So I instead converted the ambient weights to be expressed in terms of the fundamental weights (i.e., how `style="coroots"` prints) to match up with the `fusion_labels`.

Most of the new methods have doctests.

I just made a minor change which is to make dual a method of the element, not the ring.

I'm a little dissatisfied that the S-matrix has not been implemented but that can be another patch.
