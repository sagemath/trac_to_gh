Fusion algebras for WZW conformal field theories can be computed easily as instances of WeylCharacterRings. The `WeylCharacterRing` code is modified with an optional parameter k, the level. If `k==None` the behavior is unchanged. However if k is a positive integer the corresponding fusion ring is created. The reason this works is that the Kac-Walton algorithm for computing the fusion products is closely similar to the Brauer-Klimyk (aka Racah-Speiser) algorithm that is already used by the `WeylCharacterRing`. One has only to add an affine reflection to make the algorithm compute the fusion product.

I tested this for level 2 in types A2 and B2, comparing with tabulated formulas in Feingold, Fusion Rules for affine Kac-Moody algebras.

A related patch is #15485.

For fusion rings, we should have a method that returns the (finite) canonical basis as a list or an iterator. Actually `WeylCharacterRing` has a basis method that it inherits from `CombinatorialFreeModule`. 

To avoid confusion with this basis method, the method that returns the basis as a list could then be called `fusion_basis`.

So, what is the best way to enumerate all dominant weights of level `<= k`?

I am not sure I like the basis for the fusion ring being anything other than what you want to call the `fusion_basis`. More generally, I am not sure I like that the basis for `WeylCharacterRing` is not the set of dominant integral weights. Since the fusion algebra is finite-dimensional, I definite would rather have `basis` correspond to the dominant weights of level `<= k` (which we would give in the `__init__` to `CombinatorialFreeModule`).

I just constructed this as a `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`, but we could also use `WeightedIntegerVectors`. Between those two, I have not run timings to determine which is faster. Both should take 2 lines to construct (one to get the levels, one to construct the parent to iterate over).

What I think should be done is the correct indices needs to be passed to `CombinatorialFreeModule.__init__` (instead of `self._space`). This will also automatically put it into the category of `FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis` and give it extra methods.\n\nWith the existing basis method, the actual basis is too big as it says that, e.g., -\\Lambda<sub>1</sub> is a basis elements. However, this is not allowed through more standard constructions. For simplicity of the implementation, this is nice. Although for the `style='coroots'`, you can get a fair bit of speed by using weights expressed as linear combinations of fundamental weights rather than in the ambient basis (I have some really hacked together code to get some computations at a reasonable speed and memory usage I need in E<sub>7</sub> that I need to cleanup to get into Sage). Although it means some code duplication and added complexity. However, this makes it more ameable to the \"correct\" basis.

In terms of elegance, I would say `WeightedIntegerVectors` is better and more inline with the output as sums of fundamental weights (as dense vectors).",

> Does this mean we should overwrite the existing basis method (which, you are pointing out is already not correct)?

Well, sort of. What I think should be done is the correct indices needs to be passed to `CombinatorialFreeModule.__init__` (instead of `self._space`). This will also automatically put it into the category of `FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis` and give it extra methods.

With the existing basis method, the actual basis is too big as it says that, e.g., -\Lambda<sub>1</sub> is a basis elements. However, this is not allowed through more standard constructions. For simplicity of the implementation, this is nice. Although for the `style='coroots'`, you can get a fair bit of speed by using weights expressed as linear combinations of fundamental weights rather than in the ambient basis (I have some really hacked together code to get some computations at a reasonable speed and memory usage I need in E<sub>7</sub> that I need to cleanup to get into Sage). Although it means some code duplication and added complexity. However, this makes it more ameable to the "correct" basis. Unless I am misunderstanding something about what this should be able to compute.

> I doubt whether speed is an issue for this. The user will run it once. So you could choose on the basis of elegance rather than timing.

Timing might matter if someone wants to construct a "large" rank and level example. In terms of elegance, I would say `WeightedIntegerVectors` is better and more inline with the output as sums of fundamental weights (as dense vectors).
