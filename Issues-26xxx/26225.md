You could avoid some duplication (and inconsistency in string formatting methods) by writing this like:

```python
if self._keys:
    d = ', '.join('{}: {}'.format(saferepr(key),
                                  saferepr(self._dictionary[key]))
                  for key in self._keys)
else:
    d = ' '.join(pformat(self._dictionary)[1:-1].splitlines())

return 'Finite family {{{}}}'.format(d)
```

or similar.


Travis, does this address the problems with #24438?  I haven't checked carefully.  Doesn't this version mean that elements not in the `keys` argument won't be displayed at all?  Is that desirable?

My understanding is this ticket would be another way to fix #24438, but a nuance may be lost on me. It should be that `keys` should match the keys of the dict object used in the construction (well, more generally, `keys` is treated as the input to a function -- equivalently, a sequence indexed by `keys` -- so things not in `keys` should not be displayed).
