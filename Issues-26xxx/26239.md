}
```

```
sage: Qx = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: F1 = NumberField(Qx([0,1]),'a1'); F1
Number Field in a1 with defining polynomial x
sage: F2 = NumberField(Qx([0,1]),'a2'); F2
Number Field in a2 with defining polynomial x
sage: F1.is_isomorphic(F2)
False
```

The bug is because of this:

```
sage: f1=F1.pari_polynomial(); f1
x
sage: f2=F2.pari_polynomial(); f2
x
sage: f1.nfisisom(f2)
[0]
sage: f1.nfisisom(f2) ==0
True
```

As far as I can see this problem will only arise when both fields are QQ, with defining polynomial 'x'.
So pari correctly finds an isomorphism but Sage thinks that paris's [0] is the same as pari's 0, the latter being what is returned when the fields are not isomorphic.

You are also calling it on the integer `0` which happens to have length 0.

That's the underlying reason for the bug that we're trying to fix.

Checking the length is partially a hack and partially elegant at the same time. I would have checked the type (`t.type() == "t_VEC"`) but I'm fine your proposal.
