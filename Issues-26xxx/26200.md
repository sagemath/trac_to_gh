I don't understand the need for the following imports in `src/sage/graphs/all.py`

```
import sage.graphs.weakly_chordal
import sage.graphs.lovasz_theta
import sage.graphs.partial_cube
```
I let them here for now.

For the other imports you asked about above; it seems they were all added when those modules were written, without any particular comment.
