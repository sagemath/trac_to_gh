Avoid comparison of vertex labels in `graph_coloring.py`.

Comparison of vertex labels is often used in linear programs to avoid having one variable for `u,v` and another for `v,u`. Most of the time, we can simply use a frozenset.

<a id='comment:4'></a>* are you sure you need wrapping by list here:

```
+    N = list(range(n))
```
and there

```
+    classes = list(range(k))
```
and again later

* you should not remove this import

```
-from sage.numerical.mip import MIPSolverException
```
as it makes pyflakes unhappy

* This can be further simplified using `if not ...` :

```
+                    if len(list(set(classe) & set(g.neighbor_iterator(deg[-1])))) == 0:
```

* do not use `lambda` declarations, but functions:

```
E = lambda x,y : frozenset((x,y))
```
and the same in other frozen wrappers.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Thank you for the comments.
- about `list(range(...))`: If `range` becomes an iterator, then we can iterate only once on `classes`. Right ? I changed the code to use explicitly `range(k)`.

- I moved the import of `MIPSolverException` and `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` at the top of the file, and removed other imports.

> * This can be further simplified using `if not ...` :
 
- actually, we can do even better with 

```
if set(classe).isdisjoint(g.neighbor_iterator(deg[-1])):
```

 
> * do not use `lambda` declarations, but functions:
 
I did the modification (and will do in #26282, #26284, #26285), but what's the reason for that ?
