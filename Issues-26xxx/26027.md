As reported on â€‹[ask.sagemath.org](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/42202/how-do-i-define-a-homomorphism-of-a-graded-commutative-algebra/), homomorphisms have not been implemented for differential graded commutative algebras.

This may involve implementing homomorphisms for `NCPolynomialRing_plural`. As it stands, I don't know a good way to check the noncommutative relations for a potential ring homomorphism. That is, if I have

```
sage: A.<x,y> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ)
sage: R = A.cover_ring()
sage: R.relations()
{y*x: -x*y}
```
how can I check whether `f(y*x) + f(x*y) == 0`? The issue is that `y*x` is an element of the free algebra on `x` and `y`, while `-x*y` is an element of `R`, but there is no way (as far as I can see) of coercing or converting elements of the free algebra to elements of its quotient `R`.

Overall it looks good, but I have two comments:

I don't understand why you have an `_im_gens_` method for the elements. The `GCAlgebraMorphism._call_` will only used for one type of element. Since the necessary data is part of the element's API, you can just use it there. There does not need to be a need for this indirection (which means it could be a heavier maintenance burden).

Why are you using `self.parent()(0)` instead of `self.parent().zero()`?

Good idea. I've changed this.

Because that was in the code I copied from `free_algebra_element.py`. I've changed both to use `zero()` instead of `(0)`. If doctests pass, I will update the branch.
