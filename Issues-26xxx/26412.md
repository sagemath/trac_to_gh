Sorry, but I think the relevant change should at least be in a separate commit; as I could not find it easily otherwise (adding the cleanup in the same branch is fine, but at least keep the commits separate).

That said, this ignores everything I wrote in #25827 and clearly won't work since the semantics of `Integer.round` are not correct for `__round__`.
