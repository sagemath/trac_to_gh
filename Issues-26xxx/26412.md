Sorry, but I think the relevant change should at least be in a separate commit; as I could not find it easily otherwise (adding the cleanup in the same branch is fine, but at least keep the commits separate).

That said, this ignores everything I wrote in #25827 and clearly won't work since the semantics of `Integer.round` are not correct for `__round__`.

By all means, apply this change locally if you need to to proceed with other issues.

The way I'm working on Python 3 is I have a branch into which I merge all fixes for Python 3, not all of which are necessarily ready for prime time, but at least fix an issue temporarily so I can move past it.  Then I cherry pick out changes that I think are ready and add them to a new branch.

I do not want to have any sort of private branch for python3, at all. I want every single step towards python3 to be done directly in tickets and integrated quickly.

In my opinion, the problem about round now has the highest priority, as it can potentially give a large gain in the number of failing  modules and doctests.
