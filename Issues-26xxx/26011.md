For some packages (especially databases containing just files), the "Copying package files" bit of the install process takes a very long time. For example, the `pari_galpol` package (see #26010) needs

```
real    3m19.377s
user    2m22.153s
sys     0m36.311s
```
to install. This is just a database package containing 14681 files to be installed (total size 80MB). Ideally, this requires only I/O operations to install and the user CPU time should be close to 0.

The reason is probably that the code to keep track of the installed files is actually `O(n^2)` in the number of files.

I think I was trying to avoid a second loop there and crossing my fingers that there would be some optimization for that case, but I didn't exactly do much performance testing.  It would probably be much better to use an array there, and then loop over it when writing the actual file list to the stamp file.  Better O(2n) then O(n<sup>2</sup>).

That said, I wonder how much effort it would be to just rewrite `sage-spkg` in Python...
For starters though I'll see how much improvement can be made with what we already have.

That wouldn't be that hard, but it would be a boring job.

Maybe start with factoring out just the copy-from-DESTDIR stuff? That way, one could fix #26011 and #26018 at the same time.

<a id='comment:14'></a>I put a `time` in front of the `cp` call in the current version of this branch and it shows:

```
[database_pari-20161017] Moving package files from temporary location /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/database_pari-20161017/inst to /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local
[database_pari-20161017]
[database_pari-20161017] real   0m2.204s
[database_pari-20161017] user   0m0.010s
[database_pari-20161017] sys    0m0.619s
```

which seems fine.  But with the `for` loop calling `mv` for each file (and also creating directories and removing symlinks as necessary) I get:

```
[database_pari-20161017] Moving package files from temporary location /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/database_pari-20161017/inst to /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local

[database_pari-20161017] user   0m1.847s
[database_pari-20161017] sys    0m11.742s
```

Of course, if I wrote a dedicated program to do this it would probably be a lot faster.  If nothing else just running `mv` for every file probably adds enormous overhead when there are a lot of files; at least that's my guess.

I think in the case of database_pari a lot of the overhead is just in the large number of files (over 8000) than in overall size of the files.  Although in this case the total size of the files is still quite large (> 250 MB) most of the individual files are small, and moving has the same or nearly the same cost as copying.

One almost certain advantage to using mv/rename is that it's supposed to be atomic, whereas cp is not.  This may have some implications for parallel builds but I'm not sure.

<a id='comment:17'></a>Jeroen, do you know off the top of your head a better solution for `mv`-ing an entire directory tree?

Otherwise, I'm not sure there's a huge advantage to it over just using `cp -r`, except in the case of very large files.

There's also the possibility of using the above Python snippet, which seems to work well (but is more complicated obviously).

I'm not convinced one way or the other what the best thing to do here is so I'm curious what solution you prefer.
