For some packages (especially databases containing just files), the "Copying package files" bit of the install process takes a very long time. For example, the `pari_galpol` package (see #26010) needs

```
real    3m19.377s
user    2m22.153s
sys     0m36.311s
```
to install. This is just a database package containing 14681 files to be installed (total size 80MB). Ideally, this requires only I/O operations to install and the user CPU time should be close to 0.

The reason is probably that the code to keep track of the installed files is actually `O(n^2)` in the number of files.

I admit, I wasn't sure how well-optimized substitutions like `FOO="${FOO} ..."` are in bash.  I assume that's the part you're saying is O(n<sup>2</sup>)?

I think I was trying to avoid a second loop there and crossing my fingers that there would be some optimization for that case, but I didn't exactly do much performance testing.  It would probably be much better to use an array there, and then loop over it when writing the actual file list to the stamp file.  Better O(2n) then O(n<sup>2</sup>).

That said, I wonder how much effort it would be to just rewrite `sage-spkg` in Python...
For starters though I'll see how much improvement can be made with what we already have.

That wouldn't be that hard, but it would be a boring job.

Maybe start with factoring out just the copy-from-DESTDIR stuff? That way, one could fix #26011 and #26018 at the same time.

For my own records, I tried this with just the existing `database_pari` package and got

```
real    2m40.827s
user    0m46.358s
sys     0m31.482s
```

(the majority of which, as you note, was spent in the "Copying files" phase).

I'm going to see what I can do to improve this a little bit without having to rewrite too much (yet).

This brought the time for database_pari down to:

```
real    0m32.636s
user    0m24.156s
sys     0m3.019s
```

(still with the majority spent in copying).  It should also fix #26013 at the same time (conflicting with the branch currently there).

I am concerned about the possibility of race conditions with `cp`, and the sed call is cryptic even for my liking but I still plan to replace more of this with Python.

I put a `time` in front of the `cp` call in the current version of this branch and it shows:

```
[database_pari-20161017] Moving package files from temporary location /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/database_pari-20161017/inst to /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local

[database_pari-20161017] user   0m0.010s
[database_pari-20161017] sys    0m0.619s
```

which seems fine.  But with the `for` loop calling `mv` for each file (and also creating directories and removing symlinks as necessary) I get:

```
[database_pari-20161017] Moving package files from temporary location /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/database_pari-20161017/inst to /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local

```

Of course, if I wrote a dedicated program to do this it would probably be a lot faster.  If nothing else just running `mv` for every file probably adds enormous overhead when there are a lot of files; at least that's my guess.

I tried dropping this Python script into `sage-spkg` to do the moves:

```
    time cat <<_EOF_ | python - "$PREFIX" "$SAGE_LOCAL"
import os
import sys

src, dst = sys.argv[1:]

for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(src):
    dst_path = os.path.join(dst, os.path.relpath(dirpath, src))
    for dirname in dirnames:
        dst_dirname = os.path.join(dst_path, dirname)
        if not os.path.exists(dst_dirname):
            os.makedirs(dst_dirname)

    for filename in filenames:
        src_filename = os.path.join(dirpath, filename)
        dst_filename = os.path.join(dst_path, filename)

        if os.path.islink(dst_filename):
            os.remove(dst_filename)

        os.rename(src_filename, dst_filename)
_EOF_
```

and got

```
[database_pari-20161017] real   0m3.960s
[database_pari-20161017] user   0m0.463s
[database_pari-20161017] sys    0m0.312s
```

so still slower than the single `cp` call, but much faster than the shell loop.  
I think in the case of database_pari a lot of the overhead is just in the large number of files (over 8000) than in overall size of the files.

Jeroen, do you know off the top of your head a better solution for `mv`-ing an entire directory tree?

Otherwise, I'm not sure there's a huge advantage to it over just using `cp -r`, except in the case of very large files.

There's also the possibility of using the above Python snippet, which seems to work well (but is more complicated obviously).

I'm not convinced one way or the other what the best thing to do here is so I'm curious what solution you prefer.
