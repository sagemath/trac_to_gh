This is a follow-up to #24919

Some leftovers from there:

* add amd64 to yasm check
* simplify some more pre-existing `spkg-configure.m4`

Already on the branch:

* xz (+lzma)
* zlib
* zeromq


Depends on #24919

Depends on #26660

Thank you for working on these.  I'm excited to try it on Cygwin

Regarding your comments about zmq that's an interesting point I hadn't thought about.  For something like pyzmq I generally assumed that if a system libzmq were used then likely there would be a system pyzmq as well.  But it's true that that doesn't *have* to be the case.

So the question is what to do if some package has as a dependency another package (like libzmq) that was detected at `configure`-time.  If the dependent package can just automatically detect the right location for its dependency, then there is no problem, as I assume is the case for your pyzmq change.

For other packages we might not be so lucky.  So we may have to have the `configure` script output, in some cases, some variables related to dependencies detected at configure-time.  For example, if some package really needed to know the correct prefix for libzmq (as opposed to just assuming it's `$SAGE_LOCAL`) we ought to output some `LIBZMQ_PREFIX=...` variable to a file that can be sourced by `spkg-install`.

There appears to be a bug in build/pkgs/xz/spkg-configure.m4.  On my Linux machine I'm getting:

```
configure: === checking whether to install the xz SPKG ===
checking if lzma is wanted... yes
checking for inflateEnd in -llzma... no
checking lzma.h usability... yes
checking lzma.h presence... yes
checking for lzma.h... yes
configure: error: either specify a valid lzma installation with --with-lzma=DIR or disable lzma usage with --without-lzma
```

It appears that my `xz` version is too low (do we really need it to be a specific version for any known reason)?

Then, it looks like there might be some improper nesting or something, or not fully handling every possible failure case, because I shouldn't get that error.

This includes the update you mentioned for `ax_check_liblzma`.  I had forgotten that you said you wrote that by basically copying the one for zlib.

I also tried lowering the required version to 5.0.0.  I don't know for sure whether or not that's acceptable but I'll try it for now.

AFAICT no: it was just the latest version when the xz SPKG was first added to Sage.  Unless there is a known problem with some lower version, setting 5.0.0 as a minimum seems fine (if indeed we even need to bother with the version check).

I now recall seeing something along these lines on Fedora, only there this lib is in `/lib64/`, and it's not checked by the macro. Not sure it's the same problem or a different one.

The libpng requirement for ZLIB_1.2.9 does appear to be quite strict.  I haven't checked, but I'm betting that might be way a zlib package was added to Sage in the first place (or possibly the converse if an older zlib was added to Sage first, and later had bad interactions with the system's libpng).

The attached fix works for me but it would be good to get some osx verification.

this does work on OSX, at least on 10.13 (which does supply zlib 1.2.11)

yes, this should do doable. 

But, as well, the more I think about it the more it looks to me that we should seriously consider using Homebrew on OSX, with this sort of approach we won't be having library clashes one sometimes sees with Homebrew...

This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

``` 
and a very similar one in `src/sage/doctest/external.py`.
And few timeouts - not surprising for an 8-year old machine...

Looks good enough for a positive OSX review to me.

this looks like `export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES` might be needed, 
and this has nothing to do with Homebrew or Sage...

We have seen this stuff already, I just already forgot (as one does with nightmares :-))

I thought maybe it had something to do with that too, but I wasn't sure if you re-ran those tests before/after this patch.
