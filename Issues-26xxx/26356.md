```
New functionalities:
* **computation** of shifted minimal approximant bases (iterative algorithm),
* **verification** that a matrix is a shifted minimal approximant basis.

This should be done in a general context:
* accepting non-uniform orders and non-uniform shifts,
* allowing to work row-wise or column-wise,
* offering the possibility of obtaining the canonical basis (that is, the one in shifted Popov form).

your code was great. I have only noticed a few problems that I solved. Could you please double check my changes ?
If everything is fine by you and if the continuous integration passes, then you can mark it as a positive review.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Hi,

Thank you very much for your reviewing and improvements of the code. All this looks good to me now.

I would only suggest to indeed change the name to "minimal_approximant_basis", and to replace "order should be positive integers" with "order should consist of positive integers". May I let you do this? For some reason, with the branch change you made, I have difficulties pushing my changes (I get in detached HEAD for a reason I'm not sure to understand...).

Thank you.
