This is acceptable, but I want to see if we can quickly fix the underlying issue. Can you post the full traceback of the failure without your change? From looking at the code, I do not see where a `round` is called, but maybe I am missing something.

I am also seeing another possible py3 fix needed:

```
/home/travis/sage-build/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/number_field/bdd_height.pyc in bdd_height(K, height_bound, tolerance, precision)
    535     possible_norm_set = set([])
    536     for n in range(class_number):
--> 537         for m in range(1, B+1):
    538             possible_norm_set.add(m*class_group_rep_norms[n])
    539     bdd_ideals = bdd_norm_pr_ideal_gens(K, possible_norm_set)
```
where `B+1` needs to be cast to an `int` here.

The best fix would be to add `__round___` to our own real numbers.. See 
#25827 for the reasons why this seems to be difficult and nobody did it.

Here is a python3 traceback involving one of these `range(1, B+1)`:

```

Exception raised:

Thank you.

Do we just want to cast `int(B+1)`? If you just want to keep things as they are, then you can set a positive review.
