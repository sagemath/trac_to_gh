Cython 0.29 introduces a new `language_level=3str`, which is like `language_level=3` except that strings are still `str` instead of `unicode`. It would be good to use this language_level in Sage to force Python 3 syntax in all Cython files.

I am still confused by the whole language_level discussion.  I tried following the discussion on the cython mailing list but I gave up.

If I understand correctly (and this is probably just restating what you wrote in the ticket description) `language_level=3str` means it's using Python 3 syntax in all Cython files, with the *exception* that unprefixed string literals are non-unicode strings on Python 2?

Regarding your deleted comment from the other ticket (maybe it was meant for this one) about non-ASCII strings in string literals (there was an example you used with μ).  If a docstring contains non-ASCII characters then I definitely think we should be explicitly using `u''`.

It's not *only* about string literals. With `language_level=3`, the global `str` means `unicode`:

```
sage: cython('''
....: # cython: language_level=3
....: print(str)
....: ''')
<type 'unicode'>

On the other hand, I do consider it a bug that Cython disallows `"μ"` with `language_level=3str` since that's valid in both Python 2 and Python 3 (with a different meaning though).

Sure it's technically *valid* on Python 2, but not a great practice in most cases either, and with the different meaning there's a lot of potential for confusion around it so I think they're right to disallow it (even if it's unintentionally disallowed).  But I also see your point.

Ok, sure.  But "3str" means `str` is just always `str` right?  I guess I like that approach if so; it meshes well with the approach we've been already taking in Sage.

Yes, `str` is `str` and `"literals"` are also of type `str`.
