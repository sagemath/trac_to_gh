Here, we improve methods `antisymmetric`, `transitive_closure`, `is_transitively_reduced` and `transitive_reduction`. In particular, we add parameter `loops` to `transitive_closure` to control the addition of loops to the resulting graph (e.g., add a loop to u if u belongs to a directed cycle).

Would that be better ? Roughly: if the graph has loops, either we let them in the transitive closure (`loops=True`) or we remove them from the transitive closure (`loops=False`).

Before this patch, a loop was added to each vertex of the the transitive closure of a graph without loops but allowing loops.
