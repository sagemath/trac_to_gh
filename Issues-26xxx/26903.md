This ticket follows up #25706 which left a problem for the case where `as_permutation_group` is called with a keyword argument.

Example:

```
sage: G = Sp(4,3)
sage: P  = G.as_permutation_group(algorithm='smaller')
sage: P1 = G.as_permutation_group()
sage: P1 == P
False
sage: g1, g2 = G.gens()
sage: P(g1*g2)

sage: P1(g1*g2)
Traceback (most recent call last):

The example of the description is not reproducible with version 8.6 (but still has been with 8.5). I guess this is caused by the upgrade to GAP 4.10.
It seems that the result of `as_permutation_group` doesn't depend on wether the option is set or not, any more (I didn't find a counter example).

```
sage: G = Sp(4,3)
sage: P  = G.as_permutation_group(algorithm='smaller')
sage: P1 = G.as_permutation_group()
sage: P1 == P
True
```

But anyway, I think we should take into account that an option of that method, produces different results. Thus, there is no way out to have that fixed.
Now, that we have `GroupHomomorphim_libgap` working for permutation groups, as well (by #26750), the best way to do that is to rewrite #25706
in the sense of #26750 by using the natural map of the homset.

This is what I pushed to this ticket!

Thank you for this useful hint.

Indeed, according to the GAP documentation the following is not a bug:

```
sage: G = SO(4,3,-1)
sage: libgap.set_seed(0)
0
sage: P = G.as_permutation_group()
sage: for i in range(10):
....:     Pp = G.as_permutation_group(algorithm='smaller')
....:     if P != Pp:
....:         break
....:
sage: i
6
```

But, is it reasonable to the user, that you have to repeat a statement 6 times to obtain a non trivial result? Maybe, this is o.k. for GAP users.

```

The chance to get a non trivial result on the first try is just 1:10! So, Travis: you have been lucky to catch it! At least this could by improved if a loop as above would be intergated in `as_permutation_group` around the call of `SmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation`.

That would not work because there might not be a better representation, so looping until a smaller one  appears might loop forever. If we loop `n` times, then we do not get rid of any of the randomness. (In fact, the former might still be random because there could be multiple smaller reprs.) So I think we have to follow GAP here, but we might want to better document this.

You could limit the loop by an optional argument and explain the problem in its documentation.

Sure, I did not mean to solve the randomness. But that would improve the chance to find a reduced degree representation. But, that was just a suggestion!

What's wrong with having a (largish? smallish?) default number of iterations, with an option to increase it/decrease it as needed (along with appropriate documentation).

The longer I think about that, the less I understand why `SmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation` is integrated in `as_permutation_group`. Wouldn't it be better to wrap this separately by a method (named `reduce_degree`, for instance) of `PermutationGroup_generic`?
That would have several advantages:

1) It could be used for other permutation groups, as well.

2) The documentation about that strange random behavior, could be better focused.

3) You could recurs as long as the the degree is reduced (not meaning that it will become unique, finally).

This method should return `None` if no reduction was possible and with two optional arguments `seed=None, repeat=0` you could pass the optimization to the user.
