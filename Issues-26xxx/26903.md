This ticket follows up #25706 which left a problem for the case where `as_permutation_group` is called with a keyword argument.

Example:

```
sage: G = Sp(4,3)
sage: P  = G.as_permutation_group(algorithm='smaller')
sage: P1 = G.as_permutation_group()
sage: P1 == P
False
sage: g1, g2 = G.gens()
sage: P(g1*g2)
(1,4,12,30,46,47,62,63,70,2,3,9,23,35,36,60,61,72)(5,6,17,39,65,44,45,71,78,7,8,22,50,57,42,43,69,77)(10,11,28,13,14,29)(15,16,37,67,51,52,54,55,56,20,21,48,68,40,41,59,64,53)(18,19)(24,25,49,31,32,38)(26,27,58,33,34,66)(73,74,80,75,76,79)
sage: P1(g1*g2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'sage.groups.matrix_gps.group_element.MatrixGroupElement_gap' object is not iterable

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

The example of the description is not reproducible with version 8.6 (but still has been with 8.5). I guess this is caused by the upgrade to GAP 4.10.
It seems that the result of `as_permutation_group` doesn't depend on wether the option is set or not, any more (I didn't find a counter example).

```
sage: G = Sp(4,3)
sage: P  = G.as_permutation_group(algorithm='smaller')
sage: P1 = G.as_permutation_group()
sage: P1 == P
True
```

But anyway, I think we should take into account that an option of that method, produces different results. Thus, there is no way out to have that fixed.
Now, that we have `GroupHomomorphim_libgap` working for permutation groups, as well (by #26750), the best way to do that is to rewrite #25706
in the sense of #26750 by using the natural map of the homset.

This is what I pushed to this ticket!

Indeed, according to the GAP documentation the following is not a bug:

```
sage: G = SO(4,3,-1)
sage: libgap.set_seed(0)
0
sage: P = G.as_permutation_group()
sage: for i in range(10):
....:     Pp = G.as_permutation_group(algorithm='smaller')
....:     if P != Pp:
....:         break
....:
sage: i
6
```

```

The chance to get a non trivial result on the first try is just 1:10! So, Travis: you have been lucky to catch it! At least this could by improved if a loop as above would be intergated in `as_permutation_group` around the call of `SmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation`.

The longer I think about that, the less I understand why `SmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation` is integrated in `as_permutation_group`. Wouldn't it be better to wrap this separately by a method (named `reduce_degree`, for instance) of `PermutationGroup_generic`?
That would have several advantages:

1) It could be used for other permutation groups, as well.

2) The documentation about that strange random behavior, could be better focused.

3) You could recurs as long as the the degree is reduced (not meaning that it will become unique, finally).

This method should return `None` if no reduction was possible and with two optional arguments `seed=None, repeat=0` you could pass the optimization to the user.
