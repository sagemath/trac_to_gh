I wonder whether it is really worth the trouble (and performance hit) to keep the order of the ground set.

```
sage: S = [1, 8, -5, 3/2, 'a', x]
sage: import random
sage: L = [choice(S) for _ in range(10000)]
sage: %timeit list(set(L))
1000 loops, best of 3: 708 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit list(stable_uniq(L))
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.4 ms per loop
```

(Currently, essentially all the time in `Subsets_s.__init__` is spent in `uniq`.)
