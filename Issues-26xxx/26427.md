As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/43839/characteristic-polynomial-of-symbolic-matrix-of-size-7/), the following gives wrong result on Archlinux. Though this distro is not officially supported, this example shows some unexpected behaviour that might appear elsewhere, hence it makes sense to add it on the Sage doctests. 

```
sage: M = matrix(SR, 7, 7, SR.var('a', 49))
sage: M.charpoly().degree()
7
```
