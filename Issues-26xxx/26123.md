}
```
Currently, the residue field of a non-classical valuation on a function field is not a real function field:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: v = GaussValuation(R, QQ.valuation(2))
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: v = K.valuation(v)
sage: v.residue_field()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 2 (using GF2X)
```

This ticket changes this to be `Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2`.

There should be a test that `v.reduce(f)` works in this situation. 
The docstring for `reduce` test this only for standard valuations,
where the residue field is not a function field.
