-            sage: all(map(lambda t: t.matrix() in poly_g, matrix_g.gens()))
+            sage: all(t.matrix() in poly_g for t in matrix_g.gens())

-            sage: all(map(lambda t: t.matrix() in matrix_g, poly_g.gens()))
+            sage: all(t.matrix() in matrix_g for t in poly_g.gens())
             True
```

For me it seems that these two modifications are not necessary given that `all` accept `iterable` parameters.
