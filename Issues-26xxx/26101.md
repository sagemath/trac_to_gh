In the Jupyter notebook, `view(...)` currently displays the pdf in an external pdf viewer, launched from the server. An inline view as in sagenb would be nicer and would work remotely as well.

- Recycle the logic to produce the pdf from the existing view
- Convert the pdf to svg
- Have view return a Widget displaying that SVG

As a bonus, one could use view to produce widgets to be included into larger widgets. If we insist that view should return None and rather display the svg as a side effect, it would be useful to expose the functionality latex->Jupyter widget one way or the other.

Part of #29889.

Viviane has experimental code doing that, though going through png, therefore with quality loss:

The IPython display formatters supposedly support PDF as a data type: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.core.formatters.html#IPython.core.formatters.DisplayFormatter

I'm not sure exactly what it does with PDFs though.  For certain objects (e.g. graphs) going directly to SVG and outputting that (or a widget for something more sophisticated) would also make sense.
