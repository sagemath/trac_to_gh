<div id="comment:0"></div>

When computing the maximal flow of a graph using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, Sage throws an exception if the requested source or sink vertices have no edges incident to them with positive capacity:

```
G = Graph([range(4), [(1, 2)]], format='vertices_and_edges')
G.flow(0, 1, algorithm='FF') # raises ValueError: vertex '0' is not in the (di)graph
G.flow(1, 3, algorithm='FF') # raises ValueError: vertex '3' is not in the (di)graph
G.flow(0, 1, algorithm='LP') # returns 0 as expected
G.flow(0, 1, algorithm='igraph') # returns 0 as expected
```

The expected value of all of these calls should be 0.

This occurs running [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) version 8.1 on Ubuntu 18.04.1.

The cause of this error is the assumption that the residual graph constructed in _ford_fulkerson contains both the source and the sink. Simply checking that this assumption is true (and returning 0 if it is not) should fix the issue.
