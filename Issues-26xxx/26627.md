Done here:
- alignment and PEP8 cleaning from method `is_immutable` to `igraph_graph`

- in `networkx_graph`: use the order of `.edge_iterator()` to add edges to the graph instead of `.edges()`. This is safe but a doctest in `graph.py` must be updated

- in `igraph_graph`:
  1. add parameter `vertex_list` to define the mapping vertices to consecutive integers. By default, use `.vertices()`.
  2. use `vertex_list` in method `flow` accordingly.
  3. correct all doctest to show that edge attributes must be given in the order of `.edge_iterator()`, as documented, and not `.edges()`.

Did you fix here "weighted_adjacency_matrix" so that it no longer use .vertices ?

This would be useful for the sandpiles.
