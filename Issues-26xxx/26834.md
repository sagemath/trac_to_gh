**Some pep8 remarks**

- 1. Block comment should start with '# ': l275, l283.

- 2. Blank line contains whitespace: 
l431

```
        [{0, 2, 3, 4}, {0, 1, 2}]
        
    The bags of the path decomposition of a cycle have three vertices each::
```

- 3. More than one space before operator:
l466-468

```
    cdef set seen    = set()  # already treated vertices
    cdef set covered = set()  # vertices in the neighborhood of seen but not in seen
    cdef list bags   = list() # The bags of the path decomposition
```
