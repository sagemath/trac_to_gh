<a id='comment:4'></a>**Some pep8 remarks**

- 1. Block comment should start with '# ': l275, l283.

- 2. Blank line contains whitespace: 
l431

```
        [{0, 2, 3, 4}, {0, 1, 2}]
        
    The bags of the path decomposition of a cycle have three vertices each::
```

- 3. More than one space before operator:
l466-468

```
    cdef set seen    = set()  # already treated vertices
    cdef set covered = set()  # vertices in the neighborhood of seen but not in seen
    cdef list bags   = list() # The bags of the path decomposition
```

pep8 quote :

```
Avoid ...
...
More than one space around an assignment (or other) operator to align it with 
another.

Yes:

x = 1
y = 2
long_variable = 3

No:

x             = 1
y             = 2
long_variable = 3
```

l1609 `cdef int * prefix    = <int *>sig_malloc(n * sizeof(int))`

- 4. At least two spaces before inline comment : 
l468 : `cdef list bags   = list() # The bags of the path decomposition`

- 5. Too many blanklines: 
l492, l835, l874, l1013, l1753, l1817, l1846

- 6. Missing whitspace around operator:
l843 `if len(V)==1:`\\

l858 `if vsH==-1:`\\

l1611 `if prefix==NULL or positions==NULL:`\\

l1660 `return (width if width<upper_bound else -1), order`\\

l1774 `while i<n:`\\

l1824 `if loc_level<=max_prefix_length:`

- 7. lines 851 to 856, replace :

```

l876 `return vertex_separation_exp(G, verbose = verbose)`\\

l879 `return vertex_separation_MILP(G, verbosity = (1 if verbose else 0))`\\

l883 `max_prefix_number = max_prefix_number)`

- 9. test for membership should be 'x not in E' rather than 'not x in E'
