```
sage: z = SR.var('z')
sage: CyclotomicField(2)['z'].fraction_field()(2*(4*z + 5)/((z + 1)*(z - 1)^4))
```
raises an error but shouldn't. This issue is also mentioned on #24539.

AFAICS it worked in earlier [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) versions, but probably due to #23664 (unchecked) it stopped working.

Unfortunately, there is one doctest failing:

Failed example:

    ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: "Error in dput(length(sage1)) : object 'sage1' not foun"

Added a doctest:
|                                                                                                                                                 |                                  |

```diff
+            sage: T.<t> = ZZ[]
+            sage: S.<s> = ZZ[]
+            sage: S.fraction_field()(s/(s+1), (t-1)/(t+2))
+            (s^2 + 2*s)/(s^2 - 1)
```
Note that there is a conversion between `S` and `T`, so this conversion should be used also in the fraction field, at least in the case nothing else (proper coercion) works.
