```
Using a staging directory for package install can introduce race conditions. For example, when installing a Python package, the package is installed first and then the `egg-info` directory is installed. The latter is what `pkg_resources` uses to consider a package "installed".

However, when a `DESTDIR` install is used, the order that files appear in the final installation directory might be different.

If the `egg-info` directory is copied to `site-packages` before the actual Python package, then this can happen for example:

```
Installing alabaster-0.7.10
Installing package alabaster using pip2

      File "/home/jdemeyer/sage-test/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools/command/sdist.py", line 20, in walk_revctrl

      File "/home/jdemeyer/sage-test/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 2411, in resolve

        from .utils import trace
    ImportError: No module named utils
```
What you see here is that `setuptools_scm` is used by `pkg_resources` even though the package `setuptools_scm` has not fully been installed.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Replying to [comment:4 embray]:
> Another thing to note: Previously we worked around this kind of race condition by putting a lock around `pip`, so only one package can be pip-installed at a time.  Now we still have that lock, but I think it's not actually necessary (though maybe still worth keeping?) since we in general do not pip-install packages to the same site-packages at the same time (when using DESTDIR).


Good thinking! The problem is that the part which copies files from `DESTDIR` to the final installation directory is not locked. Adding an exclusive lock there would also mitigate this and maybe also #18438.
