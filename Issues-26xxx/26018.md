```
Using a staging directory for package install can introduce race conditions. For example, when installing a Python package, the package is installed first and then the `egg-info` directory is installed. The latter is what `pkg_resources` uses to consider a package "installed".

However, when a `DESTDIR` install is used, the order that files appear in the final installation directory might be different.

If the `egg-info` directory is copied to `site-packages` before the actual Python package, then this can happen for example:

```

        from .utils import trace
    ImportError: No module named utils
```
What you see here is that `setuptools_scm` is used by `pkg_resources` even though the package `setuptools_scm` has not fully been installed.

I just had this happen trying to rebuild the Windows patchbot, which broke again, for some reason.

While I believe this is a more general problem in principle, it's happening specifically because installing `setuptools_scm` can alter the behavior of pip (in particular, it installs some `setuptools.file_finder` entrypoints).  It's also pulled in as a `setup_requires` from a couple of packages that have it listed as a prerequisite.

This is relatively unusual, and I think among packages installed by Sage, `setuptools_scm` is probably the only one like this.  So I wonder if we shouldn't just list it as a prerequisite to almost all Python packages, like we currently do with pip.

Just as one possible idea, what about this?

Technically, what I called `$(PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN)`, could just be spelled "setuptools_scm", since there's already a direct dependency sequence of `setuptools -> pip -> setuptools_scm`.  But I like that having a `PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN` variable makes this relationship to other packages explicit, and can be modified in one place.

```
No record that 'setuptools_scm' was ever installed; skipping uninstall
Installing setuptools_scm-1.15.6
your setuptools is too old (<12)

Perhaps `pip` should not have `$(PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN)` as a dependency.

Updated to ensure that `$(PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN)` is not used in the dependencies of the `PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN` members themselves.

IIRC (it was several weeks ago) I did do this in the first place, but I think when I ran `sed` over the remaining packages I might have forgotten to exclude `pip` and `setuptools_scm` in particular.

Of course, let's wait and see what my patchbot says.

The issue at hand can occur in any situation where, at the most, the python2 package needs to be rebuilt, as do its dependencies.  A full build from scratch was not necessary to test it--I had found it sufficient for reliably reproducing the problem to do `./sage -f <something>` where I forget exactly what `<something>` was but it was one of python's early dependencies.  Possibly something fast, that wouldn't require a whole lot of other packages to be rebuilt.

> My point is exactly that this is a ticket about building Sage from scratch, so running `make distclean; make` is one of the first things to test, it seems to me.

It isn't necessarily though.  The issue at hand can occur in any situation where, at the most, the python2 package needs to be rebuilt, as do its dependencies.  A full build from scratch was not necessary to test it--I had found it sufficient for reliably reproducing the problem to do `./sage -f <something>` where I forget exactly what `<something>` was but it was one of python's early dependencies.  Possibly something fast, that wouldn't require a whole lot of other packages to be rebuilt.  Now that I look, it I think it was probably sqlite.

I think that would have been completely fair, though I have mixed feelings about "before marking this as needs_review".  What I find insulting is the assumption that I (or anyone, if it were someone else) just didn't test it at all.  It might be a little more reasonable if were something that *obviously* would never have worked at all under *any* circumstances, like having a syntax error in some code such that it would not have even compiled.

Even then there are cases I've seen, both from myself and others, where I had something working fine, but accidentally hit a key in my editor and inserted a stray symbol somewhere just before committing the change.  I almost always review my diff before committing, but something like that can be easy to fix (and of course if I did skip diff review entirely, that's on me).

But I don't think anyone should be lectured to about setting a ticket to "needs review" if there happens to be a mistake.  That's the whole point of asking for review--it's saying "I've done everything I can *or have time for* to work on this; please take a look".
