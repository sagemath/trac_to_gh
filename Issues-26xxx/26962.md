Since we check for perfect power anyway, it is worth changing it.

Oops, looks like we overlapped in work. Please merge as you see fit.

Some remarks:
- log(8) simplifying is actually an SR feature. So I don't think we should replicate this behaviour here (or on QQ) again. Also: it's broken. `log(2**100)` doesn't get recognized.
- I have no opinion on the type inconsistencies. In terms of type signature, this routine is a mess anyway.
- the routines previously didn't handle negative arguments with given prec appropriately. Hopefully the code changes I introduced (via ComplexField) take care of that.

I'll leave the ticket to you now.

I realized that it is an SR feature. However, in QQ, since the code computes a power factorization the simplifcation is already done

```
return (a_exp * log(a_base)) / (b_exp * log(b_base))
```
It would be strange to not provide it. In ZZ, the story is different since the code does not go through `perfect_power`. But then, it would be strange to have different behavior in ZZ and QQ.
