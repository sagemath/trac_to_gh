```
For some reason, passing Python's `time.sleep()` a Sage `RealLiteral` less than 1 returns more-or-less immediately:

```
sage: x = 0.5
sage: type(x)
<class 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral'>
sage: x2 = float(0.5)
sage: type(x2)
<class 'float'>
sage: timeit('sleep(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1 µs per loop
sage: timeit('sleep(x2)')
5 loops, best of 3: 500 ms per loop
sage: # One more time for the folks in back...
sage: timeit('sleep(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.01 µs per loop
```

It's not just in the context of `timeit` either.  0.5 is long enough that if you do `sleep(x2)` directly you can feel the delay, whereas with `sleep(x)` there is much less or even no perceptible delay.''

However, 

```
sage: timeit('sleep(1.0)')
5 loops, best of 3: 1 s per loop
```

as expected.

The problem appears to stem from the (relatively) new PyTime API, and in particular this function:

```
static int
_PyTime_FromObject(_PyTime_t *t, PyObject *obj, _PyTime_round_t round,
                   long unit_to_ns)
{
    if (PyFloat_Check(obj)) {
        double d;
        d = PyFloat_AsDouble(obj);
        if (Py_IS_NAN(d)) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ValueError, "Invalid value NaN (not a number)");
            return -1;
        }
        return _PyTime_FromFloatObject(t, d, round, unit_to_ns);
    }
    else {
        long long sec;
        Py_BUILD_ASSERT(sizeof(long long) <= sizeof(_PyTime_t));

        sec = PyLong_AsLongLong(obj);
        if (sec == -1 && PyErr_Occurred()) {
            if (PyErr_ExceptionMatches(PyExc_OverflowError))
                _PyTime_overflow();
            return -1;
        }

        if (_PyTime_check_mul_overflow(sec, unit_to_ns)) {
            _PyTime_overflow();
            return -1;
        }
        *t = sec * unit_to_ns;
        return 0;
    }
}
```

So it does not properly handle custom types that implement `__float__`.

**Reported upstream**:
- https://bugs.python.org/issue35707
- https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/11636

In the meantime I don't see that there's much to be done except to always wrap Sage types in `float()` before passing them to time functions (or, more extreme, provide our own wrappers for common time functions...)

Upstream: Reported upstream. Developers acknowledge bug.

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A9):
> I had to make the same fix 3 times.

For this ticket 1 time is enough, solved with two line patch:

```diff

+++ b/Python/pytime.c
@@ -404,9 +404,11 @@
 }
 
 static int
-_PyTime_FromObject(_PyTime_t *t, PyObject *obj, _PyTime_round_t round,
+_PyTime_FromObject(_PyTime_t *t, PyObject *xobj, _PyTime_round_t round,
                    long unit_to_ns)

     if (PyFloat_Check(obj)) {
         double d;
         d = PyFloat_AsDouble(obj);
```
This patch solves only one thing:

```
TypeError: 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```
and only for `time.sleep()`

I understand that custom builded python is not for everyone.
