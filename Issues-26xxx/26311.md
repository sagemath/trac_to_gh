```
For some reason, passing Python's `time.sleep()` a Sage `RealLiteral` less than 1 returns more-or-less immediately:

```
sage: x = 0.5
sage: type(x)
<class 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral'>
sage: x2 = float(0.5)
sage: type(x2)
<class 'float'>
sage: timeit('sleep(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1 µs per loop
sage: timeit('sleep(x2)')
5 loops, best of 3: 500 ms per loop
sage: # One more time for the folks in back...
sage: timeit('sleep(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.01 µs per loop
```

It's not just in the context of `timeit` either.  0.5 is long enough that if you do `sleep(x2)` directly you can feel the delay, whereas with `sleep(x)` there is much less or even no perceptible delay.''

However, 

```
sage: timeit('sleep(1.0)')
5 loops, best of 3: 1 s per loop
```

as expected.

The problem appears to stem from the (relatively) new PyTime API, and in particular this function:

```
static int
_PyTime_FromObject(_PyTime_t *t, PyObject *obj, _PyTime_round_t round,
                   long unit_to_ns)
{
    if (PyFloat_Check(obj)) {
        double d;
        d = PyFloat_AsDouble(obj);
        if (Py_IS_NAN(d)) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ValueError, "Invalid value NaN (not a number)");
            return -1;
        }
        return _PyTime_FromFloatObject(t, d, round, unit_to_ns);
    }
    else {
        long long sec;
        Py_BUILD_ASSERT(sizeof(long long) <= sizeof(_PyTime_t));

        sec = PyLong_AsLongLong(obj);
        if (sec == -1 && PyErr_Occurred()) {
            if (PyErr_ExceptionMatches(PyExc_OverflowError))
                _PyTime_overflow();
            return -1;
        }

        if (_PyTime_check_mul_overflow(sec, unit_to_ns)) {
            _PyTime_overflow();
            return -1;
        }
        *t = sec * unit_to_ns;
        return 0;
    }
}
```

So it does not properly handle custom types that implement `__float__`.

**Reported upstream**:
- https://bugs.python.org/issue35707
- https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/11636

In the meantime I don't see that there's much to be done except to always wrap Sage types in `float()` before passing them to time functions (or, more extreme, provide our own wrappers for common time functions...)

Upstream: **Reported upstream. Developers acknowledge bug.**

 In the meantime I don't see that there's much to be done except to always wrap Sage types in `float()` before passing them to time functions (or, more extreme, provide our own wrappers for common time functions...)

Wait until you see the code. DRY clearly does not apply to the CPython code base: I had to make the same fix 3 times.

Have you seen Sage's code base? ;)

For this ticket 1 time is enough, solved with two line patch:

```diff
--- a/Python/pytime.c
+++ b/Python/pytime.c
@@ -404,9 +404,11 @@
 }

     if (PyFloat_Check(obj)) {

         d = PyFloat_AsDouble(obj);
```
This patch solves only one thing:

```
TypeError: 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
```
and only for `time.sleep()`

I understand that custom builded python is not for everyone.
