It's about time. The sooner this is done, the fewer code to cross pexpect gap/libgap boundary will have to be written.

Following completion of this work, we can look into formally deprecating the pexpect interface to GAP: #26963.

see #25477 for a long discussion on performance of GAP vs Cython.
Here is the current (Sage 9.8.beta3) list of modules using pexpect GAP, i.e.
`sage.interfaces.gap`

```

src/sage/coding/linear_code.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import gap

src/sage/combinat/root_system/weyl_group.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/groups/class_function.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/groups/perm_gps/constructor.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import GapElement
src/sage/groups/perm_gps/cubegroup.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import GapElement
src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_element.pyx:            from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/interfaces/gap3.py:from sage.interfaces.gap import Gap_generic, GapElement_generic
src/sage/libs/gap/element.pyx:        from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/misc/randstate.pyx:            from sage.interfaces.gap import gap
src/sage/modular/arithgroup/arithgroup_perm.py:        from sage.interfaces.gap import gap

In particular, even `libgap` is using `sage.interfaces.gap` - for GAP help system.
