In this ticket we:
- use method `c_distances_all_pairs` to speed up initialization and reduce memory consumption (before, the distance matrix was stored in a dict of dict)
- use a binary matrix to simplify some parts of the code (initialization and deallocation)
- clean the file (PEP8)

Keywords: py3, graph
