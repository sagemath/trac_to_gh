Compiling sage/rings/rational.pyx because it changed.
[1/1] Cythonizing sage/rings/rational.pyx
Executing 1 command (using 1 thread)
[1/1] Time to execute 1 command: 0.51 seconds.
Total time spent compiling C/C++ extensions: 0.57 seconds.

Note that the compiler invocation (`gcc ...`) is not shown. This is really annoying for debugging. This got "broken" in #24655.
