shows

```
Compiling sage/rings/rational.pyx because it changed.
[1/1] Cythonizing sage/rings/rational.pyx
Executing 1 command (using 1 thread)
[1/1] Time to execute 1 command: 0.51 seconds.
Total time spent compiling C/C++ extensions: 0.57 seconds.

Note that the compiler invocation (`gcc ...`) is not shown. This is really annoying for debugging. This got "broken" in #24655.

Too much information is annoying at worst, but missing information is impossible to get after the fact. So when logging, I very much like to err on the side of too much logging.

And an option (with quiet logging by default) is only going to make it more complicated when users ask for help. It's already hard enough to get users send logs, but with Erik's proposal we add an extra hurdle of actually getting the info that we need in the logs.

And I remind that we have the environment variable `SAGE_SILENT_BUILD` if you don't want to see everything on your stdout. That option still keeps the logs on disk intact.
