polymake has a number of tutorials in two formats
- polymake website html: https://polymake.org/doku.php/tutorial/start - apparently released under CC BY-NC-SA
- ipynb at https://github.com/polymake/polymake/tree/Releases/demo - apparently released under GPL

In this ticket, we add a translation of the Perl-based tutorials to Python (via the polymake pexpect interface) as a thematic tutorial. 
(Upstream has been contacted regarding precise license status / possible relicensing under CC-BY-SA or similar to make it suitable for the Sage documentation.)

(This will also serve as an extended testsuite for the polymake pexpect interface.)

Preview of one translated tutorial: https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mkoeppe/art/icerm-2018/index.html#polymake-tutorial-on-polytopes-translated-to-python



Depends on #28265

Wouldn't it make more sense to put `polymake` documentation in `local/share/doc/polymake`? I don't see any reference to Sage at all in the tutorials, so it really doesn't belong in Sage's `thematic_tutorials` directory. This is especially the case since this is an experimental package.

The impression came across that the suggestion is to merely have the upstream (perl based!) documentation available. This would clearly not qualify as a Sage tutorial.

But even if the intention was to create a tutorial that is a **SageMath** tutorial (i.e., a document that exposes how to compute with polytopes *in Sage* using Polymake as a backend and leaving perl out of the picture): We are talking about an optional or experimental package, and so far the documentation of such packages is, by default, in SAGE_LOCAL/share/doc/<package name>.

> Actually, why is the polymake an experimental package and not an optional one? Is it not considered reliable enough to build on all supported platforms?

If I understand correctly, a substantial part of the recent polymake tickets and also some threads on Sage-devel and sage-support included discussion on how to make it build. That would be reason enough 
demote an optional package to an experimental one.

 1) As Dima said, at the moment there are still some (minor) portability problems: 
  a) On Centos because of the layout of the Perl installation. Upstream (Benjamin Lorenz) is aware of it and is working on a fix.

  b) Also (per Dima) apparently gcc 6.3 as on Debian stable is too old to build polymake.

 2) Because of Perl package dependencies, the installation not yet as fully automatic as other sage packages. See #27763 - any help and ideas there are welcome. 

Polymake historically had a reputation of being hard to install, but the polymake team has made great improvements there. The remaining portability issues can be addressed in the same way as it is done for other packages.
