Currently, the only example given in Polyhedron docstring is

```
    When the input contains elements of a Number Field, they require an
    embedding::

        sage: K = NumberField(x^2-2,'s')
        sage: s = K.0
        sage: L = NumberField(x^3-2,'t')
        sage: t = L.0
        sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,s],[t,0]])
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: invalid base ring
```

This is clearly insufficient from online documentation point of view. One has to look either at the html/pdf [docs](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/discrete_geometry/sage/geometry/polyhedron/constructor.html) ot at the header of the file `sage/geometry/polyhedron/constructor.py` for more examples with embeddings specified.

I'd also have something more interesting, e.g. a regular icosahedron.

Have a look at #17197 (which this present ticket might qualify as a duplicate).

Yes, this is true that polyhedron over number field is now well-documented. You can have a look at 

#22420: Meta-ticket: Polyhedron: new features and known bugs

and

https://wiki.sagemath.org/OptiPolyGeom

for a roadmap about things on polyhedra. This issue is on the list for a long time. My priority was to offer a wide breath tutorial on polyhedra and use it to then complete the docstring. Perhaps not the right way around, but the tutorial is now available:

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/geometry/polyhedra_tutorial.html

thanks to 

#22572: Add a thematic tutorial on the polyhedron class

from which you can pick many examples _that work_ under Sage 8.3.

I am sorry if the documentation string still has not been adapted yet.

Here is a short fix for this. I deliberately constructed an example from scratch,
rather than picking one from `polytopes.*`.

I wonder how one can make pointers to the tutorial in the reference manual without
mentioning the full URL.

Hi,

This looks good to me. I added the spacing convention to the example.
