That's interesting. In Sage-8.4.beta0 these tests work fine for me.

So, are you talking about 8.4.beta0? And what architecture does your patchbot have? What about the file system --- I ask, because the choice of a base field involves loading some arithmetic tables from disc (or creating new tables and storing them on disc).

I get no test failures in sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves. And I did verify that `matrix_gfpn_dense` is used for matrices over non-prime finite fields of odd characteristic.

Concerning arithmetic tables: The tables should automatically be created (as soon as the user requests a matrix over a specific finite field) in `$DOT_SAGE/meataxe`, the file names should have the format `pXYZ.zzz`, where `XYZ` is the order of the field.
So, is there anything unusual with the patchbot's `$DOT_SAGE`? If I understand correctly, there *are* patchbots that can use meataxe. So I wonder what is special here.
