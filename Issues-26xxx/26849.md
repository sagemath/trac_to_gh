Features include

* Finding generators and orders (both overall and modulo p<sup>n</sup>) for the unit group
* Expressing arbitrary elements in terms of the generators and relations
* Working with subgroups (as a step toward constructive local class field theory).  In particular, the input required for some of Monge's algorithms are maps to Fp vector spaces that define the subgroup.
