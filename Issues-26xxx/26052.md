OpenBLAS 0.3.2 came out and was uploaded to Debian. When attempting to build the sage 8.3 Debian package (with one thread) with this version, OpenBLAS causes a crash during the docbuild, see attached log.

A bug in OpenBLAS that involves the same error message ("OpenBLAS : Program will terminate because you tried to start too many threads.") is https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/1641

Our temporary workaround for now is to use Atlas (which we already used before for architectures which are not supported by OpenBLAS).

Please consider updating OpenBLAS in sage.

Openblas 0.3.3 is now out and the threading behavior which caused many bug reports is reverted for now.
Prepared upstream tarball renamed to `OpenBLAS-0.3.3.tar.gz`

I am not experiencing this problem in sage-on-gentoo. However I decided to only use "regular threads" and no "openmp threads" in openblas some time ago. I suspect that is why I am not affected at this stage. It may be that I have the wrong picture of threading in openblas as well.

I believe the problem has been addressed in 0.3.3 where they decided to switch back to the previous behavior with threads until they have fixed all the issues that have cropped in 0.3.2.

For the record I am using 0.3.3 (without openmp threads) in my own sage-on-gentoo builds.

Unfortunately, it is known to happen https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/529 . It may be that the release are not cut properly since there are repos for which I have no issues. In any case github lets you upload your own tarball prepared with sdist and the like. And people should really do it.

So someone will have to host a reference tarball until it makes it to the sage mirror.
