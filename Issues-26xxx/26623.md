When working with graphs, we have a nice tab-completed list of common graphs that we can construct; for example,

```
sage: graphs.BuckyBall()
Bucky Ball: Graph on 60 vertices
```

More and more, I find myself wishing we had the same thing for convex cones, particularly in test cases. I have constructions for all of the following and use them regularly:

* The nonnegative orthant.
* The full ambient space.
* The schur cone that induces the majorization ordering.
* The permutation-invariant "rearrangement" cone.
* The trivial cone, since `trivial_cone(n)` looks a lot nicer than `Cone([], ToricLattice(n))`.

et cetera; I'm sure I can think of more. Each of these makes sense in any dimension `n`.

I'm wondering if you think this would be a useful feature to make available as e.g.

```
sage: cones.nonnegative_orthant(5)
5-d cone in 5-d lattice N
```

They should all probably take a "lattice" argument too now that I think about it.

I think from a design standpoint, that's where the method belongs, but there are two things that bug me about it.

First: in many cases, the user won't care about the lattice and will want "the default." This is basically what happens when you do `ToricLattice(n).nonnegative_orthant()`, but it feels a little weird to specify a particular lattice when you don't care about it. By analogy, the `Cone()` function should also be a method on a `ToricLattice` object. A lot of the time you just don't care though, so it's nice to be able to get a sensible default without having to construct a generic lattice of the correct size first. On the other hand, I like that this eliminates the `n` and `lattice` parameters from the cone-creating functions. And it would ensure that (for example) if you only create one lattice object, then you can intersect any two cones created by methods on it. I'll have to think harder about this but it may be the way to go.

Second: tab completion on `graphs.<tab>` is so nice. Having a list of twenty or so cones interspersed in the tab-completion list for lattices would be bad for both people who want to see lattice methods and people who want to see predefined cones.

(Might we have something like `lattice.cones.<tab>` where `lattice` is some `ToricLattice`?)

My main objection to this is that I'm not smart enough to implement it or remember which cone is associated with which toric variety =)

Having the code above be the implementation for `nonnegative_orthant(5)` would be fine with me though.

I have another question. There are a few vector spaces associated with each cone, that can be thought of as cones themselves:

* The span of the cone K.
* Its orthogonal complement, (span(K))-perp.
* Its lineality space (the largest subspace it contains).

The span of the cone and its lineality space are already available as,

```
sage: K = Cone([(1,1),(0,1)])
sage: K.span()
Sublattice <N(1, 0), N(0, 1)>
sage: span(K)
Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: K.linear_subspace()
Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 0 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
[]
```

But none of those return cones directly. Having a cone is handy when you want to compute e.g. the intersection of one of these things with some other cone.

If we were to add similar methods that return cones, how would you prefer to do it? We could either...

1. Add methods to the cones themselves, for things like `K.span_cone()`, `K.lineality_space()`, `K.orthogonal_complement()`
2. Add them as part of the new `cones.<whatever>` interface, with something like `cones.span_of(K)`.

The first one seems more correct to me, but risks polluting the namespace with a bunch of methods that all look the same but return different things.

The second one does make it obvious that you're going to get a cone back, but only if people know to look there for what should in principle be a method on the cone itself.

Option 3:

For the span and the orthogonal complement, we could sensibly add a `cone()` method somewhere in the module hierarchy, like

```
sage: K.orthogonal_sublattice().cone()
```

which would be a wrapper around

```
sage: Cone( c*g for g in K.orthogonal_sublattice().gens() for c in [-1, 1] )
```

The problem with that is, when starting from a cone and passing through a vector space, the lattice information is lost. If I start with a cone in a lattice `M`, take its `linear_subspace()`, and then turn it into cone...

```
sage: K = Cone([(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,1,0)], ToricLattice(3,'M'))
sage: Cone(K.linear_subspace().gens())
1-d cone in 3-d lattice N
```

it should live in the same lattice as the original cone. I don't see how to fix that immediately.

Just a reminder - orthogonality in the toric setting is handled via dual lattices:

```
sage: c = Cone([(1,2,3), (4,5,6)])
sage: c
2-d cone in 3-d lattice N
sage: c.orthogonal_sublattice()

sage: c.span()
Sublattice <N(1, 2, 3), N(0, 3, 6)>
```

Oof, it looks like I'm missing trac emails again.

It would just be nice to have the cone methods available on subspaces. For example, Corollary 1 in these notes,

http://michael.orlitzky.com/notes/on_z-operators_and_viability_theorems.pdf

is very easy to test as the intersection of a closed convex (dual) cone and a subspace. If span(x) is a cone, and if its orthogonal complement is a cone, then I can use the cone intersection method that we already have to test it.

Another example is the "maximal angle between two convex cones." This is a newish concept (from 2016), and I've implemented it as a method on cones. However, the "principal angle between subspaces" is a classical idea going back to the 1950s, and they turn out to be equivalent for cones that are subspaces. If subspaces can be treated as cones, then I can use the same method that I have on cones to compute principal angles between subspaces. And so on.

The reason `Cone(c.span())` "hangs" is because it carefully enumerates every element of the vector space.

I think there's plenty of work to do just to get the trivial cone, nonnegative orthant, and a few others implemented and documented. I'll focus on that and worry about the other questions later.

But that's exactly how `Cone()` works, and `Cone()` is the function that underlies all of these convenience methods.

The additional check is not strictly required; it serves only to provide a more relevant error message. For example, if I were to delete the check and then pass a lattice of the wrong rank to `Cone()`, I would get

```
sage: M = ToricLattice(2)
sage: Cone([(1,-1,0),(0,1,-1)], lattice=M)
...
TypeError: cannot convert (1, -1, 0) to Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field!

```

If you know the generators of (say) the Schur cone, then you might be able to figure out what that error message means. But, if you don't know what those generators are off the top of your head, then an error message complaining about converting `(1,-1,0)` to a rational vector space could be confusing. That said, I'm not too attached to the additional sanity check and error message, and would be happy to remove them.


> It would be more pleasant to provide only one input argument: either a number to get the cone in the default lattice of that dimension


I don't think this is workable, since in applications we often want to intersect the dual of some cone (which will live in a non-default lattice) with e.g. a nonnegative orthant.


> only one input argument...  a lattice, and get a cone in that lattice. 


This is the best API, but as a user-interface is pretty annoying to use. The "pass a lattice, but only if you don't want the default one" approach of `Cone()` is IMO a good compromise. Having to do e.g.

```
sage: cones.trivial(ToricLattice(3))
```

is even worse than

```
sage: Cone([], ToricLattice(3))
```

In the common case, the user is left wondering why he has to type `ToricLattice(n)` all the time instead of just `n`. The default is usually fine until you start doing complicated stuff.

The hardest question to answer. I started with e.g. `cones.nonnegative_orthant()`, and was asked to change it for consistency (read the earlier comments). I don't have strong feelings either way, but slightly prefer the way the lowercase/underscore names look. We should have a consistent, documented policy about this.

This is doctested, it just doesn't look like it. That code was originally inlined into each individual method, and each individual method still has tests to make sure that it works. You can check e.g. the last three TESTS for `Schur()` to see that they're really testing the code in `_preprocess_args`. This actually results in some duplicated tests, but makes sure that I haven't totally forgotten to call `_preprocess_args` for some cone (and is nice documentation). 


>  - There is a pyflake import error, could you take care of it?


Fixed, thanks.

If no one else, I have convinced myself that lowercase-with-underscores is the better option here.

Things got messy when I tried to revert the camel-case commit, so I wound up re-doing everything. The new implementation is slightly different:

* I renamed the module from `cones` to `cone_catalog` which fits better with the existing naming scheme for algebras, designs, etc. Someone pointed this out on the mailing list and it makes sense to me.
* I got rid of the class, and put everything back into functions exposed at the top level. The whole module is now imported under the global name `cones`. The reason for not doing this in the first place is that you don't want `cones.<tab>` to show things like `ZZ` and `matrix` that just happen to be imported into the module. After moving a few imports into the functions that use them, that's no longer an issue here.
* Things are back to lowercase-with-underscores.
* The lazy import isn't needed any longer, because we're not at risk of importing a pre-created object that will waste memory. Now it's just function names that do nothing unless you call them.
* All of the commit messages have been updated to reflect these changes.

<a id='comment:32'></a>
Some minor comments.

- Your `INPUT` item all end with a period
- You describe twice (after `INPUT` and after `OUTPUT`), when errors are being raised.
- You misspelled `rearrangenent` at least once.
- Please provide doctests for `_preprocess_args`.
- `nonnegative_orthant`:
  - Can you be more precise with the reference?

```
+    REFERENCES:
+
+    - [BV2009]_
```
  -
- `rearrangement`:
  - `"rearrange,"` (comma in quotes)
  - again the references are rather unspecific except for `[Jeong2017]_` (is there any way to obtain `[Jeong2017]_`?)
  - I would formulate the statement exactly the other way around. I guess figuring out the Lyapunov rank of the nonnegative orthant or a halfspace is the easy part.

```
+    Jeong's Corollary 5.2.4 [Jeong2017]_ states that if ``p`` is
+    either one or ``ambient_dim``, then the Lyapunov rank of the
+    rearrangement cone in ``ambient_dim`` dimensions is
+    ``ambient_dim``. Moreover for all other values of ``p``, its
+    Lyapunov rank is one::
```
- Isn't this clear from the definition anyway?

```
+    Jeong's Proposition 5.2.1 [Jeong2017]_ states that the rearrangenent
+    cone of order ``p`` is contained in the rearrangement cone of
+    order ``p + 1``::
```
    So maybe just the following would suffice

```
+    The rearrangement cone of order ``p`` is
+    by definition contained in the one of order ``p + 1``::
```
  -

```
+    The generators for the rearrangement cone are given by [Jeong2017]_
+    Theorem 5.2.3.
```
    Maybe it's more useful for the reader to specify the generators concretely here.
- `schur`
  - Please provide a definition.
  - Again the references would be more helpful with concrete information (such as sections etc.)

Thanks for the feedback. I think I addressed all of your suggestions. I left each change separate for ease of review, but these commits can all be squashed eventually.

The only way I know of to get Juyoung's thesis is to email him and ask. I don't know of another published reference for the Lyapunov rank result, though.

Thanks. Overall this will be a nice improvement.

A few comments for now.

- I would suggest using commas here:

```diff
+globally-available ``cones`` prefix, to create some common cones:
+
+- The nonnegative orthant,
+- the rearrangement cone of order ``p``,
+- the Schur cone,
+- the trivial cone.
-   globally-available ``cones`` prefix, to create some common cones:
-
-- The nonnegative orthant
-- The rearrangement cone of order ``p``
-- The Schur cone
-- The trivial cone
```
- The warning at the beginning should include mentioning, that any import will be imported at startup.
- If you lazy import `Cone` and `random_cone` than the bots will be fine with the number of startup modules. Also this should be done anyway, shouldn't it?

Thanks, I added the commas, and expanded the warning at the beginning of the module.

As for the bots: I don't think they're complaining about `Cone` or `random_cone`:

1. Both of those are loaded by `sage.geometry.all` anyway.

2. Those import statements aren't executed until you run one of the functions in the `cone_catalog` module, so importing them is essentially "lazy" even if you're using sage as a library and not interactively.

Instead, I think the bots are pointing out that `sage.geometry.cone_catalog` is now loaded into the global namespace as `cones`, but that's almost unavoidable since that's the whole point. However, it is indeed slower than the lazy import of the class was, should you decide not to use it.

There may be some clever way to delay even *that* import, while still retaining the name "cones" along with its tab-completion list. For example, if I give a top-level variable name to the module, and then import that object lazily... e.g. this seems to work in cone_catalog.py

```
import sys

# A python object that can be imported lazily with lazy_import(...).
cones = sys.modules[__name__]

def __dir__():
    # Don't expose any global imports or variables to tab-completion.
    return ['nonnegative_orthant',
            'rearrangement',
            'schur',
            'trivial']
```

if I then do

```
lazy_import('sage.geometry.cone_catalog', 'cones')
```

in sage/geometry/all.py. But that's veering dangerously close to "too clever" to save a few microseconds in my opinion.

One could just do

```
lazy_import("sage.geometry", "cone_catalog", "cones")
```

I don't know if it's faster, but I don't see a disadvantage. Tab completion and everything still works.

Again many minor things.

- There is a tripple dash

```
+At the moment, only convex rational polyhedral cones are
+supported---specifically, those cones that can be built using the
```

- Instead of importing in each function, you could do something as

```
from sage.rings.all import ZZ as _ZZ
```
  Don't know if that is better.
- I don't know, if this is going to link correctly in the documentation:

```
+    - ``lattice`` - a :class:`ToricLattice` in which the cone will live
```
- I think we are supposed to use double quotation marks for error messages:

```
+        raise ValueError('lattice rank=%d and ambient_dim=%d '
+                         'are incompatible' % (lattice.rank(), ambient_dim))
```
- Missing semicolons:

```diff
-    - ``ambient_dim`` -- (default: ``None``) the dimension of the
-      ambient space, a nonnegative integer
-
-    - ``lattice`` -- (default: ``None``) the toric lattice in which
-      the cone will live
+    - ``ambient_dim`` -- (default: ``None``); the dimension of the
+      ambient space, a nonnegative integer
+
+    - ``lattice`` -- (default: ``None``); the toric lattice in which
+      the cone will live
```
- Again I'm not sure that this will work in the documentation

```
+    A :class:`.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone` living in ``lattice``
```
- I don't know if I would mention the errors after `OUTPUT` at all. Isn't this clear that this `OUTPUT` is given only if the `INPUT` is as required and otherwise an error is raised?
- 

```diff
-    I = matrix.identity(ZZ,ambient_dim)
+    I = matrix.identity(ZZ, ambient_dim)
```
-

```diff
-    I = matrix.identity(ZZ,ambient_dim)
-    M = matrix.ones(ZZ,ambient_dim) - p*I
+    I = matrix.identity(ZZ, ambient_dim)
+    M = matrix.ones(ZZ, ambient_dim) - p*I
```
- The rearrangment cone will give nonsense, when `p` is not an integer. But I don't know if this is a problem.

This is actually the documented way to get sphinx to create an "em" dash in the HTML output. It's displaying correctly for me in the built docs.

Clever =)

But, the extra imports are "free", so I don't think it's worth changing them around again at this point.

You are right... `ToricLattice` isn't a class.

Is that written down anywhere (for my future reference)? I don't care either way, I changed them to double quotes.

Hmm.. someone has updated the developer's guide without fixing the existing docstrings or mentioning it to anyone. I tried to conform to the new examples in the guide.

This one works!


> - I don't know if I would mention the errors after `OUTPUT` at all. Isn't this clear that this `OUTPUT` is given only if the `INPUT` is as required and otherwise an error is raised?


Other languages/projects have a standard location to document the exceptions that can be raised, but as far as I know, we don't. We probably should. I think it's nice to mention that a function *can* fail in the OUTPUT docs, just to be on the safe side in case the user skips the INPUT docs. But to me it feels like the relationship between the inputs belongs in the INPUT block. My mind could be changed on this, if everyone could agree to do it consistently.

Added spacing throughout.

Thanks, I don't like that the function would silently return nonsense if you pass in e.g. `p=1.5` I've added another error check to that cone.
