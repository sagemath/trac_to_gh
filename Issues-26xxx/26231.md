Furthermore, if in a clean python session I run\n\n```\nfrom sage.all import *\nimport _tkinter\n```\nthe error happens, but it doesn't happen if I change the order of imports (that is, importing `_tkinter` before the sage library is ok.\n\nI could circumvent the problem by adding a line \n\n```\nimport _tkinter\n```\n\nat the file `sage/all.py` before the line\n\n```\nfrom sage.matrix.all import *\n```\n\nSo, for some reason, it seems like some code in the matrix module messes in a subtle way with something that tkinter expects.\n\n**CC:**  @jdemeyer @NathanDunfield @williamstein @fchapoton @saraedum @embray @slel\n\n**Author:** Miguel Marco\n\nIssue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26231\n\n",

Indeed, the same kind of error appears just trying to `import _tkinter`.

However, in a clean `sage -python` session, importing `_tkinter` does not give any problem. Furthermore, if in a clean python session I run

```
from sage.all import *
import _tkinter
```
the error happens, but it doesn't happen if I change the order of imports (that is, importing `_tkinter` before the sage library is ok.

I could circumvent the problem by adding a line 

```
import _tkinter
```

at the file `sage/all.py` before the line

```
from sage.matrix.all import *
```

So, for some reason, it seems like some code in the matrix module messes in a subtle way with something that tkinter expects.

Normally Sage does not even include Tkinter.  It is not included by default when building Python, normally, and IIRC you have to explicitly enable it when building Python which we don't for Sage.

If you're doing some `import Tkinter` then you must be pulling it in from some other Python, which is not supported behavior.  This is especially problematic if your `_tkinter` was linked against system libraries (in this case, indirectly, libfreetype most likely) that conflict with versions included in Sage.

I would propose "wontfix" for this since Sage doesn't include Tkinter (perhaps it should be that's another question...)

I have removed the `.local/matplotlib directory` (it was empty anyways), and checked that I didn't have the `PYTHONPATH` variable set. The problem persists.

I also have the same feeling: for some reason Sage is trying to use tkinter to show the plots, but can't find exactly what is triggering that behaviour.

In any case, I think there are two orthogonal problems:

1. Sage trying to use tkinter, when it shouldn't
2. Importing the sage library breaks the ability to import other python libraries.

Some thoughts on the initial report.   What happens if you do

```

It is general that when building Python, which Python modules get built depends on ambient functionality:
- the `tkinter` module given ambient !Tcl/Tk functionality, as Nathan pointed out,
- the `ssl` module given ambient SSL functionality --- crucial to let us "pip install" from PyPI!

!Tcl/Tk capability, if present, adds some extra functionality in Sage.

See the references to !Tcl/Tk in the Sage documentation:
- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#tcl-tk
- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-usage.html#how-to-get-sage-s-python-to-recognize-my-system-s-tcl-tk-install
- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/constructions/plotting.html#openmath

It can be more important for some optional or external packages, such as SnapPy.
