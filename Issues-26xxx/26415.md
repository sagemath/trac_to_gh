Using `sage_getargspec` instead of `inspect.getargspec` is a nice, consistent way to smooth over some Python 2/3 differences, and in particular `DeprecationWarning`s that come up from using `inspect.getargspec`.  As a bonus it will work better on more inputs, though I don't think that particularly matters in the specific cases changed here.

Went ahead and rebased this on #26380 which is already closed as of writing, but which I hadn't seen.  Nevertheless I still had this change done a few weeks ago; my bad for not posting sooner.
