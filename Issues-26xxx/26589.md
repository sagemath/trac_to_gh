1. Is this kind of a convention to name function with postfix `2`?
   {{{#!diff

   +cdef generic_power_pos2(a, ulong_or_object n, mul)

   Could something more descriptive be found easily?

2. parameter is called ``inv``, isn't it?
   {{{#!diff
   +    - ``invert`` -- an optional function for inversion (only used
   }}}

3. This is more like a question: 
   {{{#!diff

   +    """
   +    Return `a^n` where `n > 0`.

   Are there no doctests required here? What is the rule? (Coverage is happy)
