Just adding more fixes from my python3 branch.

There's no unifying theme to these fixes except that they are mostly either tests that fail due to trivial output differences, or that make no sense on Python 3 in the first place (e.g. having to do with `long`, or old-style classes, etc.)

If any of them need a closer look I'm happy to split them out, but I don't think most of them are very interesting.

Depends on #26390

Yes, I've also tried to do things mostly on a basis of top-level sub-packages.  In this case there were just so many, and most of them very small (like, one liners) that I didn't feel like making a bunch of tickets.

I could split the misc/ ones off, but what about the others?  It still doesn't really solve the problem.
