sage: P = polytopes.dodecahedron(backend='normaliz')
sage: P
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5)^3 defined as the convex hull of 20 vertices
sage: P.save('dodecahedron.sobj')
TypeError: can't pickle PyCapsule objects
```

We fix this by removing the cone with `__getstate__` on pickling.

On unpickling we use `__setstate__` and `_cone_from_Vrepresentation_and_Hrepresentation` from #28639 to restore the cone.

Special care has to be taken in the following cases:
- no inequalities (the cone can only be initialized from Vrep),
- the empty polyhedron (cone is `None` in this case).

As the lines are recomputed, there is no guarantee that they appear in the same order in the normaliz cone. However, normaliz sorts the given lines anyway:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[[1,0], [0,1]], backend='normaliz').lines()
(A line in the direction (1, 0), A line in the direction (0, 1))
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[[0,1], [1,0]], backend='normaliz').lines()
(A line in the direction (1, 0), A line in the direction (0, 1))
sage: P = Polyhedron(lines=[[1,1], [1,0]], backend='normaliz').lines()
(A line in the direction (1, 0), A line in the direction (0, 1))
```

Also, even if `_normaliz_cone` has the lines somewhat shuffled, this shouldn't be noticable as computations are invariant on which line we choose.

<a id='comment:2'></a>One could define in `Polyhedron_normaliz`:

```
def __getstate__(self):
     state = super(Polyhedron_normaliz, self).__getstate__()
     # Remove the unpicklable entries.
     del state[1]['_normaliz_cone']
     return state
```

This constructs an object just as

```
sage: P = P.base_extend(P.base_ring(),backend='field')
sage: P.base_extend(P.base_ring(),backend='normaliz')
```
(but saving computed results)

However, one would need a method to recover `_normaliz_cone` (this method is needed anyway, to make the second thing work).

<a id='comment:16'></a>Meanwhile I have implemented the use of precomputed data. Version 3.8.4 will very soon be published. Normaliz accepts 

```
Type::extreme_rays
```
and 

```
Type::support_hyperplanes
```
as precomputed data. 

Howevber, these do not always define the cone (or polyhedron) in which we want to compute since nontrivial coordinate transformations may come into play. These are restored via 

```
Type::generated_lattice
```
(also in the algebraic case) and 

```
Type::maximal_subspace
```

It is also important that these precomputed data are considered homogeneous input types so that the polyhedron must be defined via Type::dehomogenization or Type::grading.

See Sections 6.21 and D.8.16 in Normaliz.pdf (as of today).
