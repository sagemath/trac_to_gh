<a id='comment:1'></a>The problem is that the semantics of `FancyTuple` changed, and I think in a bad way:

```
sage: FancyTuple([(1,2,3),(4,5,6)])
0: 0: 1
1: 2
2: 3
1: 0: 4
1: 5
2: 6

sage: FancyTuple([[1,2,3],(4,5,6)])
0: [1, 2, 3]
1: 0: 4
1: 5
2: 6
```
I think this comes from #26704 but I didn't check.
