The `sage.structure.coerce_dict` has many examples of the problem I've seen before where entire doctests are documented verbatim, or sometimes almost verbatim, in order to satisfy the poorly-worded "all def statements must have an examples block in their docstring" rule.

Some of these are not even useful in the spirit of that rule, because they are written as "indirect doctests" that don't actually usefully demonstrate how the class is used internally.  This is especially true for the examples in `MonoDictEraser` and `TripleDictEraser`.  These could use better tests/examples.  Or none at all if it's not practical to do so.

By making it more general, you will always sacrifice performance a bit.

Since `TripleDict` plays an extremely important role in the coercion model, it affects every single arithmetic operation between different parents. So performance matters a lot.

The use of any templating makes the code harder to understand, at least because it requires the reader to understand the templating in addition to cython and the inner workings of Python. It also makes it harder to spot places where optimizations can be made.

So I'd say there's a significant cost to using a less direct way of generating the code. You'd have to show a significant benefit to justify it. In this case it would be "maintainability". I'm not so sure you really improve that. There is indeed some repetition of code, but it's very straightforward code and the total body of code is not that bad either. So I'd think there's no room to recoup the cost of templating.

The doctests on the other hand: yes some of those are only there to cover the coverage metric. There would probably be room for improving the tests. The actual coverage of the functionality is pretty good with some of the more centralized tests, though, so I'm not sure you'll find bugs or improve the code by improving the doctests.

Concering the doctest coverage metric: I think that metric has the advantage of being very simple and has a net positive effect, so I'd be in favour of keeping the metric.
