I don't know how much of a problem this is, if any, but it seems to make sense--sorting the elements results in more consistent tables.

For the judson-abstract-algebra book tests I guess we should also inform the authors of the changes if/when this is merged.

I don't think in any case there's a problem with changing the existing tables that were output, but I'm not sure?  The only one I knew needed to be handled with care were the quaternion examples, but other than that I don't think the default labeling of elements matters?

I am not fully convinced that the `list` -> `sorted` is the right thing to do for doctests. Unnecessarily sorting things is not necessarily good form IMO as it subtly indicates inconsistent enumeration, which is not the case here.

```diff
-            sage: list(P)                       # optional - database_gap
-            [(), (1,2), (1,2,3), (2,3), (1,3,2), (1,3)]
+            sage: sorted(P)                     # optional - database_gap
+            [(), (2,3), (1,2), (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (1,3)]
```
However, I am fine with doing it internally and it would be good to fix that doctest (sorry about introducing that). So I am giving this a positive review.
