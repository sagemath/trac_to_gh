Given a quadratic number field, conversion to Python floating point is terribly slow compared to the more complicated MPFI interval floating point conversion

```
sage: %timeit float(a)
1000 loops, best of 3: 224 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit RIF(a)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 919 ns per loop
```
With the branch applied

```
