Given a quadratic number field, conversion to Python floating point is terribly slow compared to the more complicated MPFI interval floating point conversion

```
sage: %timeit float(a)
1000 loops, best of 3: 224 µs per loop
sage: %timeit RIF(a)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 919 ns per loop

<a id='comment:9'>Comment 9:</a>
Code looks good to me, but there are some failing doctests says the patchbot. I think they are all related to the exception raised in case of complex values.
