cephes at the moment is only installed on FreeBSD, to fix its lacking (on versions less than 12) libm, and it's far from working anyway. 

The good news are that the latest FreeBSD 12.0 (already in beta, to be released by the Dec 2018) has fixed its libm so that cephes is no longer needed. POC may be found on https://github.com/lwhsu/sagemath/tree/freebsd
(work in progress, builds, runs, fails ~30 tests as of 2018/10/30).
