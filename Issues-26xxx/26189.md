The intersection code is sometimes wrong. Here's an example:

This is the setup:

```
sage: d1 = J0(11).degeneracy_map(22, 1)
sage: d2 = J0(11).degeneracy_map(22, 2)
sage: A = (d1-d2).image()
sage: J = J0(22)
```

This is correct:

```
sage: J.intersection(A)
(Finite subgroup with invariants [] over QQbar of Abelian variety J0(22) of dimension 2,
 Abelian subvariety of dimension 1 of J0(22))
```

This is wrong:

```
sage: A.intersection(J)
(Finite subgroup with invariants [2] over QQbar of Abelian subvariety of dimension 1 of J0(22),
 Abelian subvariety of dimension 1 of J0(22))
```
