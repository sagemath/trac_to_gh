<a id='comment:3'></a>You're going to hate me, but `log_gamma_binomial` is a public method, and changing the signature requires deprecation. So you will have to do some kind of deprecation:

```diff
-def log_gamma_binomial(p, gamma, z, n, M):
+def log_gamma_binomial(p, gamma, n, M, z=None):
```
with something like this to catch if `z` was passed as a named argument:

```
if z is not None:
    deprecation(...)
    if z in ZZ: # Assume it was meant to be M
        z,n,M = n,M,z
```

Otherwise LGTM.
