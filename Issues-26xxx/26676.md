When I used Sage7.2, I could easily solve my boolean equations with solve_sat commands, and it's results were verified by the papers and other tools, but when I upgraded my sage to version 8 (or later version) I found that the new solve_sat solver (especially when we use CryptoMiniSat as the SAT solver) doesn't work as correct as before. For example, when I solve a system of equations via solve_sat which used CryptoMiniSat as a SAT solver, I get different number of solutions in different version of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath).

Dear Monteli,

Regarding to explicit code for understanding the actual issue: I'll upload a code that generate a system of boolean equations which shows the issue exactly. This system of equations is extracted from a stream cipher called Bivium-B and I've solved it several times in Sage 7.2, and I'm certain that it has a unique solution, but when I want to solve it via the newer versions of [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) (after 8.0), solver returns False as the output, which means there is not any solutions!
I'll upload the code as soon as possible.

Thanks in advance for your help

Dear Monteli, \\
Here's the code which shows the issue. This script generates 441 cubic equations for the SBox of the AES cipher. The SBox is a bijective function from 
GF(2)<sup>8</sup> to GF(2)<sup>8</sup>. for example let (y0, y1, ..., y7) = S(x0, x1, ..., x7) and we have system of 441 equations like this: \\
f1(x0, ..., x8, y0, ..., y7) = 0\\
.\\
.\\
.\\
f441(x0, ..., x8, y0, ..., y7) = 0\\

which it's solutions must satisfy the (y0, y1, ..., y7) = S(x0, x1, ..., x7) relation. Since S is a bijective function from GF(2)<sup>8</sup> to GF(2)<sup>8</sup>, there are at least 256 solutions for the above system of equations. But when I used solve_sat to solve the above system of equations, it returned only 27 solutions which shows that the solve_sat can't find all solutions even the parameter "n" in solve_sat command is equal to "infinity"!


## A Sage script which generates the cubic equations of the AES SBox and solves it via the solve_sat command:

```
from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_sequence import PolynomialSequence
from sage.sat.boolean_polynomials import solve as solve_sat
sr = sage.crypto.mq.SR(1, 4, 4, 8, allow_zero_inversions = True)
sb = sr.sbox()
eqs = sb.polynomials(degree = 3)
eqs = PolynomialSequence(eqs)
variables = map(str, eqs.variables())
variables = ",".join(variables)
R = BooleanPolynomialRing(16, variables)
eqs = map(R, eqs)
%time sls_aes = solve_sat(eqs, n = infinity, s_verbosity = 8)
print("Number of solutions = %s" % len(sls_aes))
```
When I executed the above code in my own laptop, I got the bellow solutions:

```
CPU times: user 6.49 s, sys: 10.3 s, total: 16.8 s
Wall time: 23.1 s
Number of solutions = 27
```

In addition, I feel the run-time of solve_sat has been increased in comparison with previous versions.

Hi,

I can add a small example which might help to fix the problem:

```
varl = ['k{0}'.format(p) for p in range(29)]  # no solution

B = BooleanPolynomialRing(names = varl)
B.inject_variables(verbose=False)

keqs = [
    k0 + k6 + 1,
    k3 + k9 + 1,
    k5*k18 + k6*k18 + k7*k16 + k7*k10,
    k9*k17 + k8*k24 + k11*k17,
    k1*k13 + k1*k15 + k2*k12 + k3*k15 + k4*k14,
    k5*k18 + k6*k16 + k7*k18,
    k3 + k26,
    k0 + k19,
    k9 + k28,
    k11 + k20]

from sage.sat.boolean_polynomials import solve as solve_sat

kpsol = solve_sat(keqs, n=1)
```
The Boolean equation system (ANF) definitly has a solution but `solve_sat()` returns `False`.

The interface to cryptominisat implemented in src/sage/sat/solvers/cryptominisat.py
has a bug in the enumeration of the CNF variables. This bug results in faulty ANF to CNF conversion and failures in the solver routine `sat.boolean_polynomials.solve()`.

When using the ANF to CNF converter `CNFEncoder` with the solver `CryptoMiniSat` (which the function `sat.boolean_polynomials.solve()` does) with this example some of the variable indices are re-used for different monomials of the ANF which is a bug.

The variable indices used when converting the fifth equation (`k1*k13 + k1*k15 + k2*k12 + k3*k15 + k4*k14`) get re-used when converting equations with the monomials `k26` and `k28`.

When using the `DIMACS` solver instead, the conversion to CNF works correctly, the resulting CNF file can be solved by a SAT solver.

Comparing the functions in src/sage/sat/solvers/cryptominisat.py and src/sage/sat/solvers/dimacs.py I see discrepancies, for example in the functions `var()` and `add_clause()`.

This bug is also present in the picosat binding, I think.

Any ideas?

Regards, Jörg.

A remedy for this bug is (at least for my little example) to change the `var()` function in `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/sat/solvers/cryptominisat.py` (source file is in `src/sage/sat/solvers/cryptominisat.py`) from

```
        return self._nvars + 1
```
to

```
        self._nvars += 1
        return self._nvars
```
which corresponds to the code of the `DIMACS` solver. Removing the file `cryptominisat.pyc`, starting sage and importing `CryptoMiniSat` will use the modified version of `cryptominisat.py`.
With this modification the ANF to CNF converter `CNFEncoder` produces the same CNF with `CryptoMiniSat` as with `DIMACS` as solver. And my example can be solved by `sat.boolean_polynomials.solve()`.

Regards,
Jörg.
