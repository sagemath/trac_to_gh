For what it's worth, I believe the non-determinism is due to the following in `semigroup_generators`:

```
    gens = set()
    for cone in subcones:
        gens.update(cone.semigroup_generators())
    return tuple(gens)
```

An ordered tuple or PointCollection (which amounts to the same thing) is always returned, but using `set()` to eliminate the duplicates makes the order of the tuple itself unreliable.

Andrey will know whether this should be fixed by sorting the output, or by making the output deterministic.

Only sorting the output - there is no canonical ordering, so there is no point in wasting time on sorting it always.
