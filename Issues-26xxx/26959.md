If `foo` is defined in libgap, then `libgap.foo` should access it. Currently it doesn't:

```
sage: libgap.fail
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: No such attribute: fail.
sage: libgap.eval('G := DihedralGroup(8)')
<pc group of size 8 with 3 generators>
sage: libgap.G
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: No such attribute: G.
sage: libgap.eval('G')
<pc group of size 8 with 3 generators>
sage: libgap.eval('fail')
fail
```
I guess `libgap.fail` would be more pythonic than `libgap.eval('fail')`.

Note that only part of the above works in the pexpect interface:

```
sage: gap.eval('G := DihedralGroup(8);')
'<pc group of size 8 with 3 generators>'
sage: gap.G   # is some gap function, not what was defined above
G
sage: gap.fail # works as I would expect
fail
```

In the ECL wrapper I decided against this. If `libgap.foo` is just a shorthand for `libgap.eval("foo")`, then using `libgap.foo` is not going to be very efficient, because every time it will need to set up a wrapper object, which needs to hook into gap's garbage collector somewhere to ensure that the object doesn't get deleted before the wrapper disappears.
Much more efficient:

```
FOO=lib.eval("foo")
<do all kinds of things with FOO>
```
If you view these instructions like the "import" statements required in python, it won't seem so onerous.

It would be possible to create a namespace object that does have the above semantics, but caches the wrapper (it would basically be a defaultdict). This could then be used for permanent objects, such as functions (perhaps have some technology that also tries `function_factory` when appropriate?). I would say that the namespace of the libgap interface itself is not the best spot for this, though.

Yes, that is what I was afraid of. And actually in the p_group_cohomology version that I am testing right now, I do what you suggest: I define `Failure = libgap.eval('fail')` in one module and import `Failure` from there.

So, I wouldn't mind to close this ticket as "won't fix".
