If `foo` is defined in libgap, then `libgap.foo` should access it. Currently it doesn't:

```
sage: libgap.fail
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: No such attribute: fail.
sage: libgap.eval('G := DihedralGroup(8)')
<pc group of size 8 with 3 generators>
sage: libgap.G
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: No such attribute: G.
sage: libgap.eval('G')
<pc group of size 8 with 3 generators>
sage: libgap.eval('fail')
fail
```
I guess `libgap.fail` would be more pythonic than `libgap.eval('fail')`.

Note that only part of the above works in the pexpect interface:

```
sage: gap.eval('G := DihedralGroup(8);')
'<pc group of size 8 with 3 generators>'
sage: gap.G   # is some gap function, not what was defined above
G
sage: gap.fail # works as I would expect
fail
```

I agree.  We had a long e-mail thread sort of discussing this, and it led to frustratingly few useful conclusions.

The problem is that right now there is a hard-coded list of what global variables in GAP can be accessed via attribute access on the `libgap` instance.

In the ECL wrapper I decided against this. If `libgap.foo` is just a shorthand for `libgap.eval("foo")`, then using `libgap.foo` is not going to be very efficient, because every time it will need to set up a wrapper object, which needs to hook into gap's garbage collector somewhere to ensure that the object doesn't get deleted before the wrapper disappears.
Much more efficient:

```
FOO=lib.eval("foo")
<do all kinds of things with FOO>
```
If you view these instructions like the "import" statements required in python, it won't seem so onerous.

It would be possible to create a namespace object that does have the above semantics, but caches the wrapper (it would basically be a defaultdict). This could then be used for permanent objects, such as functions (perhaps have some technology that also tries `function_factory` when appropriate?). I would say that the namespace of the libgap interface itself is not the best spot for this, though.

This is fixed since a while ago by #27911.  It is further improved on in #31404, since gappy does not use `self.eval(attr)` to do this, but simply uses the libgap API to check if GAP has a global named `attr` and raises an `AttributeError` if not, so this should alleviate nbruin's concerns mentioned here.
