<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
I keep starting and stopping on reworking my Cygwin stuff for psutil.  It needs to be refactored pretty badly and every time I start to work on it I quickly get pulled away to other things.

Is there some specific reason to update the psutil version?

One reason is that the current version does not work on FreeBSD 12.0.
How hard is that refactoring? I have a Windows laptop around, which BSODs now and then due to some hardware issue, but probably is good enough for mild Cygwin work.

A related Cygwin issue is on #26052 - any idea about that?

It would be good to update. Distros likely use a more recent psutil (I do). It causes at least one optional doctest failure (when combined with `fricas`) due to changes to output

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/fricas.py
**********************************************************************
File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/fricas.py", line 351, in sage.interfaces.fricas.FriCAS._quit_string
Failed example:

Expected:

This is with `psutil-5.5.0`.

I have been thinking lately of spending a couple days updating the cygwin version of psutils.

If the psutil developer wants to port over any work from my fork he'd still be free to.

I was thinking about this lately because there was yet another issue on the psutils github asking for cygwin support and pointing to my incomplete pull requests...

I might also try submitting this upstream again.  The patch is incomplete (many features are missing) but good enough for Sage's purposes for now.

We should not maintain patches that add functionality in Sage. This will create problems later when switch to using standard Python package dependency information for Python packages.

Instead I see two options:
- Fork `psutil`, making it available on PyPI under a new name. Only makes sense if you are willing to maintain it, obviously.
- Just implement Cygwin version of the few things needed from `psutil` in `src/sage/interfaces/gap.py` and `src/sage/misc/getusage.py`

Normally I would agree but that's not really the case here.  We're not talking about adding new functionality or bug fixes required for Sage to function in such a way that would be at odds with using system packages.

This is just adding support to the package for a platform it doesn't otherwise support: Which is to say, there is no "standard Python package dependency information" for psutil on Cygwin.  In fact, PyPI does not even support cygwin wheels yet (something I plan to lobby on, but it's slightly complicated).  There is also no psutil package for Cygwin, again because support for it does not even exist modulo my patch.

What I plan to do is, once my Cygwin port of psutil reaches 100% feature parity then I will add a Cygwin package for it to [cygwinports](https://github.com/cygwinports) based on my fork.  Then there will at least be a standard Cygwin package for psutil and we can drop the patch and/or use my fork as the standard installation source for psutil on all platforms.

I don't think it will require a lot of maintenance since he says he's planning on taking a break from making new psutil releases for a while.

I don't know.  It would be great if someone would try to talk sense to its maintainer at https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/pull/1884#issuecomment-733165286.

Otherwise we can still just generate a patch from my existing work in the meantime...

<a id='comment:42'>Comment 42:</a>
Currently our spkg is at psutil 5.2.0,
from 2017-03 (with patches).

Python 3 deprecation warnings in psutil
were resolved in psutil itself by

- [psutil pull request 1318](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/pull/1318),
  merged in 2018-08

With a recent psutil, the first start of
Sage on Cygwin could be warnings-free.

Some user reports mentioning the deprecation warnings:

- [2020-08: Ask Sage question 53120](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/53120)
- [2021-08: sage-support](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/KZFZBoI6xJk/m/cP-fduA5AQAJ)

Do we need psutil at all? I think we can delete it. It's used for three things:

1. To guess at the initial GAP memory pool size, passed to gap via `-o` and `-s`. I don't think we need these flags, though: https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap3.html
2. To set the maximum stack size during PARI initialization. Again, we can just set it to a big number; it's a limit, and we're already guessing.
3. Two doctests that call `get_memory_usage()` to check for leaks.

Those two doctests are not worth keeping it around, even as an optional package, considering it won't work on one of our supported platforms. So I say we,

1. Drop the `-o` and `-s` flags to GAP. If the absence of `-s` causes problems in some cases, we  can always pass `-s <big_number>` since that memory should not actually be allocated. And if *that* assumption is violated on some platform, then we could special-case that platform.
2. Pass a big value to PARI in `libs/pari/__init__.py` for its stack size limit. 1024 times the initial size, or something like that.
3. Delete those two doctests.
4. Delete psutil, and sleep easier knowing that we won't be responsible for a fork of it for the rest of our lives.
