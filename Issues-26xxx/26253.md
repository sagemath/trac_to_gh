<a id='comment:5'></a>I keep starting and stopping on reworking my Cygwin stuff for psutil.  It needs to be refactored pretty badly and every time I start to work on it I quickly get pulled away to other things.

Is there some specific reason to update the psutil version?

How hard is that refactoring? I have a Windows laptop around, which BSODs now and then due to some hardware issue, but probably is good enough for mild Cygwin work.

A related Cygwin issue is on #26052 - any idea about that?

This will create problems later when switch to using standard Python package dependency information for Python packages.\n\n\nNormally I would agree but that's not really the case here.  We're not talking about adding new functionality or bug fixes required for Sage to function in such a way that would be at odds with using system packages.\n\nThis is just adding support to the package for a platform it doesn't otherwise support: Which is to say, there is no \"standard Python package dependency information\" for psutil on Cygwin.  In fact, PyPI does not even support cygwin wheels yet (something I plan to lobby on, but it's slightly complicated).  There is also no psutil package for Cygwin, again because support for it does not even exist modulo my patch.\n\n> Instead I see two options:\n> - Fork `psutil`, making it available on PyPI under a new name. Only makes sense if you are willing to maintain it, obviously.\n> - Just implement Cygwin version of the few things needed from `psutil` in `src/sage/interfaces/gap.py` and `src/sage/misc/getusage.py`\n\n\nWhat I plan to do is, once my Cygwin port of psutil reaches 100% feature parity then I will add a Cygwin package for it to [cygwinports](https://github.com/cygwinports) based on my fork.  Then there will at least be a standard Cygwin package for psutil and we can drop the patch and/or use my fork as the standard installation source for psutil on all platforms.\n\nI don't think it will require a lot of maintenance since he says he's planning on taking a break from making new psutil releases for a while.",

Normally I would agree but that's not really the case here.  We're not talking about adding new functionality or bug fixes required for Sage to function in such a way that would be at odds with using system packages.

This is just adding support to the package for a platform it doesn't otherwise support: Which is to say, there is no "standard Python package dependency information" for psutil on Cygwin.  In fact, PyPI does not even support cygwin wheels yet (something I plan to lobby on, but it's slightly complicated).  There is also no psutil package for Cygwin, again because support for it does not even exist modulo my patch.

What I plan to do is, once my Cygwin port of psutil reaches 100% feature parity then I will add a Cygwin package for it to [cygwinports](https://github.com/cygwinports) based on my fork.  Then there will at least be a standard Cygwin package for psutil and we can drop the patch and/or use my fork as the standard installation source for psutil on all platforms.

I don't think it will require a lot of maintenance since he says he's planning on taking a break from making new psutil releases for a while.

<a id='comment:42'></a>Currently our spkg is at psutil 5.2.0,
from 2017-03 (with patches).

Python 3 deprecation warnings in psutil
were resolved in psutil itself by

- [psutil pull request 1318](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/pull/1318),
  merged in 2018-08

With a recent psutil, the first start of
Sage on Cygwin could be warnings-free.
