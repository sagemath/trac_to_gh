This is a follow-up on #16268 (and #16993), where the following further improvements were suggested:

- clearing denominators in the numerator and denominator instead of making the leading coefficient of the denominator monic when that makes sense (i.e., for printing, and perhaps for computations in nested rational function fields, but making it fast enough requires some work),
- also normalizing the leading coefficients over non-fields where that makes sense (see also discussion at #16993).

Unexpected (-1) factor in the numerator and denominator of a `sage.rings.fraction_field_element.FractionFieldElement`.

SageMath version 9.1.beta3.

```
sage: P.<a,b,c>=QQ[]
sage: f = 1/a/(b-a)/(c-a)+1/b/(a-b)/(c-b)+1/c/(a-c)/(b-c); f
(-1)/(-a*b*c)
sage: f.numerator()
-1
sage: f.denominator()
-a*b*c
```
