We expose the new parameter `vertex_list` of `init_short_digraph` in methods of `distances_all_pairs.pyx` and so
- add the same parameter to methods of `distances_all_pairs.pyx`
- remove the use of `.vertices()` in `hyperbolicity.pyx` and `comparability.pyx`

We could do the same in `bandwidth.pyx` but this might be in conflict with #26520

Several use of `.vertices()` remain in `distances_all_pairs.pyx` that are harder to remove.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I am not convinced that the test for `is_transitive` is always going to give the same answer:

```diff
         sage: digraphs.DeBruijn(5,2).is_transitive(certificate=True)
-        ('00', '10')
+        ('22', '02')
```
I think a more robust test would be to verify this by:

```
sage: G = digraphs.DeBruijn(5,2)
sage: cert = G.is_transitive(certificate=True)
sage: G.has_edge(*cert)
False
sage: G.shortest_path(*cert) != []
True
```
