```
In `src/sage/combinat/words/morphism.py`, there is the following code:

```
dom_alph.sort()
```
and

```
return FiniteWords(sorted(codom_alphabet))
```

These will break with #22029.

Do you mean "with a *sortable* alphabet" ?

I updated a branch which fixes the 2 doctests. I also updated the class documentation: INPUT block was missing, the example block of the class doc was the same as the module doc, I erased it and replaced that by examples better suited for what is seen with `WordMorphism?` showing the different way of using the inputs. I also added a note block about the sortable expectation when the domain and codomain are not explicitely given.

Needs review.

If `X` is any permutation of the alphabet, then `sorted(X)` always succeeds (not raising an exception) and always returns the same thing (independent of the chosen permutation)
