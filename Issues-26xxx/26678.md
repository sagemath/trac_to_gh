This ticket concern the cleaning of methods related to clustering, centrality and distances in `generic_graph.py`.

- #26803  fix bug and clean `szeged_index`
- #26813  improve `cluster_triangles` adding parameter `implementation` to use faster methods than networkx. It also removes parameter `with_labels` that was neither documented nor used.
- #26814  pep8 in `clustering_average`, `clustering_coeff` and `cluster_transitivity`
- #26815  pep8 cleaning in `distances` and `distance_all_pairs`
- #26819  improve method `eccentricity` to save calls to `.vertices()`
- #26820  pep8 cleaning in `eccentricity`, `center`, `radius`, `diameter`, `periphery`
- #26821  pep8 cleaning in `distance_graph` and `girth`
- #26822  pep8 cleaning in `centrality_betweenness` and `centrality_closeness`
- #26823  pep8 cleaning in methods `all_paths`, `shortest_path`, `shortest_path_length`, `_check_weight_function`, `shortest_paths`, `shortest_path_lengths`, `shortest_path_all_pairs`
- #26824  pep8 in `wiener_index` and `average_distance`
- #26825  pep8 cleaning in `triangles_count`
- #26826  improve method _path_length
