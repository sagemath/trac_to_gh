Contrast:

```
sage: R.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
sage: R.base_ring()
sage: R1.base_ring()
Ring of integers modulo 5
sage: R1.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
Natural morphism:
  From: Integer Ring
  To:   Ring of integers modulo 5
```
So one fix would be for this ring to have a coercion from `ZZ`. Another would be to do special case `1` and `0` in `cartesian_product` to return `one` and `zero` respectively and consider all other scalars as an action on `1`.

Though, if we start provided something like this, we should pay a lot of attention to the shortcut in use in many rings right now in Sage (QQ, RR, etc). Many of them might be in `_element_constructor_` and a generic coercion would bypass it.
