Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A2):
> Maybe I should have kept CombinatorialObject ?


That one is a maybe. The biggest issue is they are no longer hashable:

```
sage: hash(NonDecreasingParkingFunction([]))
11648069979105038
```
which is an error on your branch. It is possible that someone is using the other list-like features of `CombinatorialObject` not already reimplemented (mainly the `__add__` being concatenation), but I find that highly unlikely.
