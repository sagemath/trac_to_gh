Trying to find all uses of `_ambient` with `search_src` under the category and algebra modules only turned up a commented out piece of code in `sage.algebras.lie_algebras.lie_algebra.py` and the Lie algebra example in `sage.categories.examples.finite_dimensional_lie_algebras_with_basis.py`, which conveniently enough already uses the `Subobjects` category.

Based on the above search, I replaced the use of the `_ambient` attribute in the `product_space` method of `FiniteDimensionalLieAlgebrasWithBasis` to test for containment in the `Subobjects` subcategory instead. All the doctests still worked, so at least on the surface the change did not break anything.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Thank you. There are a few more things, but it is almost ready.

You should have a method

```python
def defining_ideal(self):
    return self._I
```
(This is what is done for, e.g., quotients of the `FreeAlgebra`.)

These changes limit a little bit the number of function calls. While they are not likely to give a significant/noticeable speedup, they do help limit the overhead a bit more:

```diff
-        sorted_indices = [ambient.basis().inverse_family()[X]
-                          for X in ambient.basis()]
+        inv = ambient.basis().inverse_family()
+        sorted_indices = [iv[X] for X in ambient.basis()]
```

```diff
-        sm = L.module().submodule_with_basis([I.reduce(L.basis()[i]).to_vector()
+        B = L.basis()
+        sm = L.module().submodule_with_basis([I.reduce(B[i]).to_vector()
                                               for i in index_set])
```

```diff
-        Xdict = X.monomial_coefficients().items()
-        return L.sum(ck * L.basis()[ik] for ik, ck in Xdict)
+        B = L.basis()
+        return L.sum(ck * B[ik] for ik, ck in X)
```
(This also reduced the memory overhead.) Lastly, pull the `sm.basis()` call outside of the for loop.
