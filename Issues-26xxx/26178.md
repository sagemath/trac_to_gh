All the issues had been treated in #23214 which get rids of the sage-linbox interface.

---

While cleaning the linbox interface at #24544 we encountered some issues with an innocent type change. The sage-linbox interface is using `LinBox::DenseVector<Givaro::Modular<unsigned int>>` while it would be more natural to deal with `Givaro::Modular<int64_t>` or `Givaro::Modular<uint64_t>`. Though some strange compilation failures were present on macOS X, see discussion from the discussion at #24544.

Once this is fixed, we could get rid of the sage-linbox interface.

This problem is also tracked in linbox at [issue 117](https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/117).

**CC:**  @ClementPernet @fchapoton

**Upstream:** Reported upstream. No feedback yet.
