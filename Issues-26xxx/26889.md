Currently, one uses pexpect interface there to convert a libGAP matrix group to strings, feed it to GAP's pexpect interface, etc.

This ticket will streamline this. One still will need one conversion to pexpect GAP, at the end, to feed it to PermutationGroup().

<a id='comment:2'></a>The following example which worked with the former version, is causing a string buffer overflow, right now:

```
sage: S = Sp(6,3)
sage: S.as_permutation_group()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Gap terminated unexpectedly while reading in a large line:
```


My suggestion to avoid this can be seen from the following diff:
