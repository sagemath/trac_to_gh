At least in some cases, matrix multiplication over finite fields can be sped up a lot (PARI in this example, but using e.g. FLINT or NTL might also be an option):

```python
def matmul_pari(A, B):
    return Matrix(A.base_ring(), A.__pari__() * B.__pari__())

F = GF(3^12)
n = 64
M = MatrixSpace(F, n, n)
A = M.random_element()
B = M.random_element()
```
With this setup, I get

```
sage: %time C = A * B
CPU times: user 456 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 456 ms
Wall time: 456 ms
sage: %time D = matmul_pari(A, B)
CPU times: user 40 ms, sys: 1 ms, total: 41 ms
Wall time: 40.9 ms
sage: C == D
True
```


Component: **performance**

Keywords: **matrix multiplication, finite fields**

Does this mean a new method for matrix multiplication should be implemented or does sage already have a matrix multiplication function that needs to be modified
