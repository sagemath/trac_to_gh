Sage using python3 presently fails to build the sage documentation. This is because the current sage autodoc extension does not properly work with python3. This ticket provides new `sage_autodoc` that works for both python2 and python3.

The new `sage_autodoc` is based on the existing `sage_autodoc` but trimmed a lot to be in sync well with Sphinx' orthodox `autodoc`. This is to make it more **maintainable** by clarifying modifications made by Sage to Sphinx autodoc extension.

I was guessing that this was because `an_element` is marked as ``@`cached_method`.

I expected these subtle differences. I cannot explain the cause of the differences, but know where to look. You can start with 

`vimdiff src/sage_setup/docbuild/ext/sage_autodoc3.py local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` 

and perhaps also with comparing `sage_autodoc3` with the original `sage_autodoc`. 

I would welcome commits to fix these unpleasant changes, after switching to a public branch. 

To understand how an attribute (in the general sense, of a module or of a class) is rendered by Sphinx, note that a  suitable `Documenter` is selected for each attribute in the last lines of the following (in `sage_autodoc`): 

```
    def document_members(self, all_members=False):
        """Generate reST for member documentation.

        If *all_members* is True, do all members, else those given by
        *self.options.members*.
        """
        # set current namespace for finding members
        self.env.temp_data['autodoc:module'] = self.modname
        if self.objpath:
            self.env.temp_data['autodoc:class'] = self.objpath[0]

        want_all = all_members or self.options.inherited_members or \
            self.options.members is ALL
        # find out which members are documentable
        members_check_module, members = self.get_object_members(want_all)

        # remove members given by exclude-members
        if self.options.exclude_members:
            members = [(membername, member) for (membername, member) in members
                       if membername not in self.options.exclude_members]

        # document non-skipped members
        memberdocumenters = []
        for (mname, member, isattr) in self.filter_members(members, want_all): <------------------------
            classes = [cls for cls in itervalues(self.documenters)
                       if cls.can_document_member(member, mname, isattr, self)]  <----------------------
            if not classes:
                # don't know how to document this member
                continue
            # prefer the documenter with the highest priority
            classes.sort(key=lambda cls: cls.priority)                 <----------------------
            # give explicitly separated module name, so that members
            # of inner classes can be documented
            full_mname = self.modname + '::' + \
                '.'.join(self.objpath + [mname])
            documenter = classes[-1](self.directive, full_mname, self.indent)               <---------- look here

            memberdocumenters.append((documenter, isattr))

        ...
```

Can you justify this? In particular, which "orthodox `autodoc`" are you talking about? Given that Sage is not using the latest Sphinx (see #26451 for that), this is a relevant question.

I just meant the one currently shipped with Sage. So not the latest. 

You know what I mean by "sync well" if you "vimdiff" old `sage_autodoc` and then the new `sage_autodoc`,  against Sphinx' `ext/autodoc/__init__py`.

What should be done is to remove the article `Miscellaneous p-adic functions` from the Sage documentation. I may open a ticket for this, if you agree.

<a id='comment:49'></a>Fair enough regarding `padic_lseries`.

Still, there is more documentation which is removed. For example `sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FiniteStateMachine.output_alphabet`

In the sources, there is

```python
    output_alphabet = None
    """
    A list of letters representing the output alphabet of the finite
    state machine.

    It can be set by the parameter ``output_alphabet`` when initializing
    a finite state machine, see :class:`FiniteStateMachine`.

    It can also be set by the method :meth:`determine_alphabets`.

    .. SEEALSO::

        :class:`FiniteStateMachine`,

I understand your reasoning, but given that the commit was made and you hadn't actually (as far as anyone can tell) begun the review the change, why not just incorporate it into your review?  It does look pretty harmless to me and, while it should still have been checked, really doesn't add significant burden to review.

I thought that "I will review it. Please do not make further changes." was clear enough. So yes, I was already building the documentation when that additional commit was pushed.

Can we please not make further fuss about this? This ticket has positive review now, let's keep it that way. It's not perfect and that's fine. And the `pyflakes` warnings are the least of my worries with the Sage docbuilder.
