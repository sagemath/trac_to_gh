- 4. At least two spaces before inline comment : 
l299 `cdef int pi # the position`
l300 `cdef int vi # the vertex`

- 5. Missing whitespace around operator:
l354 and l355 `ith_range_array[i+1]`

**Python question**

```
-            if i == 0:
+            if not i:
```
What is the reason for using `not i` rather than `i == 0` ? \\

`not i` mean `i == 0 or i is None` is it ok to do the same thing in both case ?\\
For what i see `i is None` should never happen but if it do i don't think it should pass silently.

Either way the meaning of my pep8 remarks were "If the goal of the ticket is to be as close as possible to pep8 you should do this" rather than "This is a problem blocking the ticket".
