- 4. At least two spaces before inline comment : 
l299 `cdef int pi # the position`
l300 `cdef int vi # the vertex`

- 5. Missing whitespace around operator:
l354 and l355 `ith_range_array[i+1]`

**Python question**

```
-            if i == 0:
+            if not i:
```
What is the reason for using `not i` rather than `i == 0` ? \\

`not i` mean `i == 0 or i is None` is it ok to do the same thing in both case ?\\
For what i see `i is None` should never happen but if it do i don't think it should pass silently.

Here we have `cdef int i` so it does not matter at all whether you write `i == 0` or `not i`. It's just a matter of style.

The advantage of `i == 0` is that it makes it clear that you're really testing for 0.
