In SageMath 8.5.beta2:

```
sage: R.<x> = Qp(5)[]
sage: R(2).factor()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
PrecisionError: p-adic factorization not well-defined since the discriminant is zero up to the requestion p-adic precision
```
The discriminant is not useful for constant polynomials; we should just return a trivial factorisation.
