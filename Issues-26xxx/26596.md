Using rpy2 instead of manually interacting with the r repl gives us many benefits, the biggest of which is that we don't have to maintain the details of the interface ourselves. This should solve the dputs issue in #25674 and make sage compatible with r 3.4.x as well as 3.5.x (not actually tested yet).

The interface currently still inherits from the Expect interface since untangling that seems non-trivial. It is a bit awkward to force rpy2's output into the output sage expects. That output also isn't documented (it seems like its basically "whatever dput gave us"). I've implemented conversions so that the doctests pass, but there are likely differences between the presentation of r objects that are not covered by the doctesting framework.

All doctests pass now except a `Bad exit: 1` in `sage/combinat/tableau.py` that I can only reproduce when running the whole testsuite. I have no clue what may be causing this. As far as I can see, `tableau.py` doesn't use `r` in any way.

Immediately before the exit the following tests (which are simply the last ones in the file) were run:

```
sage: [ T for T in IncreasingTableaux(3, (1,0,1)) ] ## line 9285 ##
[[[1, 3], [3]]]
sage: [ T for T in IncreasingTableaux(4, (1,0,1,1)) ] ## line 9287 ##

I'm reasonably sure that this matches the old api now, I've compared the output of the available examples. Everything passes except the previously mentioned `tableau.py`. No idea about that.

I would appreciate help debugging this and maybe some manual testing of the interface.

I did some digging into the difference in precision. The difference is:

r('1/10.4').sage() # old interface
0.09615384615384615
r('1/10.4').sage() # new interface

Pretty sure. I removed all the changes except the import statements and it still failed.

Another change is that R is now always initialized (by setting its options) at startup (when `r = R()`) is assigned. I temporarily implemented some lazy initialization to try to work around it, but that didn't fix it either.


The other change is for the same reason, more memory required and the 2G limit is pretty tight.

When testing this on-distro with R 3.5 I encountered an interesting error:

```
matrix(CDF, 0, 0).is_unitary(algorithm="orthonormal")
```

would segfault with `RRuntimeWarning: Error: BLAS/LAPACK routine 'ZGEES ' gave error code -6`. The `from rpy2 import robjects` line is the "cause" for this. That only happened when running the testsuite on-distro, not on sage-the-distro. However I reduced it to this:

```
from rpy2 import robjects; import scipy.linalg; import numpy as np; scipy.linalg.schur(np.empty(shape=[0,0]))

Which will segfault sage-the-distro (or just `./sage -python` as well. I'll try it with the latest openblas master. Wondering how the rpy import may cause this. Maybe it always segfaults and rpy somehow hijacks error handling or something?

tl;dr 

There is a subtle difference of behavior in xerblas as shipped by openblas (as a part of blas)  and netlib's lapack function of the same name (shipped as part of lapack). If you ship an integrated openblas with lapack included you get the base blas function from openblas (that's the one vanilla sage sees). If you have a separate lapack based on netlib you get to load netlib's xerblas first. You may find that if you preload openblas first the problem may go away.

No my distro uses `openblas` as lapack and blas. I've reported this upstream ([scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9466), [rpy2](https://bitbucket.org/rpy2/rpy2/issues/491/importing-rpy2-before-scipy-leads-to).

I would still like to investigate this, but right now I'm working on the GAP 4.10 integration which I believe has higher priority.

<a id='comment:38'></a>
Some notes on the differences:

- slight difference in precision in some cases (see [comment:15])
- `r('NA').sage()` will now actually return `NA` (of type `rpy2.rinterface.NALogicalType`) as opposed to `None` (which it did before)
- `r('NaN').sage()` will now return `nan`, while it threw a `NameError` before
- same thing with `Inf`: name error before, correct behaviour now
- same thing with imaginary numbers: parsing error before, correct behaviour now
- errors were ignored before (because some faulty pattern matching) and are actually handled now
 	- that led to the discovery and fix of a bug: `is_string` was not overriden in `RElement`. Because of that dumping strings didn't work properly. See commit d979fdf70da0476b648d2f703fa7bf00cb9e3d03 for details.

So this brings bugfixes, compatibility to R 3.4 *and* R 3.5 and less maintenance burdon.

From R project website, I gather they are doing a similar to Sage's thing (or even go further, by supplying Clang 6 too) on OSX: supply their own compilers for building from source...
