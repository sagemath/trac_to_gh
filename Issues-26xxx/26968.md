Yes, if there are any bugs resulting from user configuration those should be then reported by users and captured as a regression test: Tests should be isolated as possible and reproducible.

Repeating my comment I accidentally posted in #22652 here:

Replying to [embray](#comment%3A12):
> I still haven't looked at it that deeply but I suspect you're overthinking it.


`env.py` contains these lines:

```
_add_variable_or_fallback('PYTHON_EGG_CACHE',   opj('$DOT_SAGE', '.python-eggs'))
_add_variable_or_fallback('SAGE_STARTUP_FILE',  opj('$DOT_SAGE', 'init.sage'))
```

Which is admittedly way less occurrences than I expected. Still, those would need to be re-evaluated or their usage changed.

> Though the concern about `MAXIMA_USERDIR` is definitely valid.  That's the kind of problem I wanted to address in #22652,


#22652 would be amazing. I don't see why it would necessary fix these issues though. Of course it would make sense to tackle both issues at the same time.

> but every time it's come up it's been easier to just implement a narrow fix rather than a general solution.


Speaking of narrow fixes, for this specific use-case, for this particular issue that should do it (how do I get that nice patch highlighting on trac?):
