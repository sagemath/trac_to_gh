By the way, I am tempted to implement this also for ideals over quotient rings (by lifting to the cover ring, adding the ideal that acts as kernel of the quotient, compute the elimination there and then project again). But i want to hear your thoughts on that because:

1) I am not completely sure if that mathematically makes sense. and

So, what do you think?

I think so.

I am VERY MUCH sure that it is implemented. Actually I clearly remember writing examples a couple of years ago for quotient rings of non-commutative rings. Of course, the general ideal containment problem for two-sided ideals in non-commutative rings is unsolvable. But the code contains slots for a "reduction()" method (or perhaps it was called "reduce()"). And IF that method is implemented, then quotient rings automatically are provided.

I don't have time to look into it right now, but I am sure everything can be found, for example, in `sage.algebras.letterplace` (it provides testing equality of cosets modulo two-sided weighted-homogeneous ideals).

Ouch. Maybe I was totally misunderstanding what this ticket is about. I thought it was about "reduction modulo Gröbner bases" ("computing normal forms"). Now I realise that you talk about elimination of variables, which of course is something completely different.

So, perhaps it is needed to disregard my previous comments...
