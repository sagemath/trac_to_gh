```
We construct a class CombinatorialPolyhedron, which collects several methods for polyhedra depending only on the combinatorial type. Actually, most of the methods will work for atomic, coatomic Eulerian lattices.

Computations can be much faster when avoiding creating explicitly the face lattice.

Example:

```
P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)
P.f_vector()
```

On my machine this takes over 8s, but it should be a matter of ms. For `permutahedron(7)` it takes forever and should also be a matter of ms.

Additionally, one can create the face_lattice much faster. The face_lattice of `permutahedron(7)` should only take few seconds. This is done by creating of lists of all faces and then quickly checking inclusions.

The crucial speed up is obtained by creating bit-vectors for the faces, each bit corresponding to a vertex. Intersection of faces is then only bitwise-and and subset check is (A & ~B == 0). Both steps only take one CPU step per 64/128/256 bits/vertices (depending on the processor). Otherwise the algorithm is pretty similar to current algorithm to create the `hasse_diagram`, except that it avoids double counting (and hence can calculate the `f_vector`) without an explicit list of all faces.

The ticket will prepare, but not use, SIMD-instructions. Enabling them will be a subject of #27103.

FOLLOW-UPS:

- implement calculation of entries in the flag-vector, this might be better, than the calculation in the face_lattice
- Improve the calculation of properties of polytopes that depend on the face-lattice (f-vector,edges, ridges, k-faces in general, edge-graph, etc.)
- Enable SIMD-instructions.

I added examples.

I tried Cython, but didn't get the desired speedup. It was much faster than what is implemented in Polyhedron though. I started doing it in cython, but I couldn't get array access (via pointers) in a speed even close to C. Now with using intrinsics I'm close to 4 times as fast then without intrinsics. The crucial step in the algorithm is subset check as A & ~B == 0 for long bit vectors A and B.

We want to build a Database for Polytopes (similar to FindStat) and thus we want to be able to fastly compute f_vectors even for large polytopes. 
This is the f_vector of a 20-dimensional counter example to the Hirsch conjecture. It only takes about 3 minutes to calculate now:

 (1,
 36425,
 364250,
 1846226,
 6234909,

 1364130,

 8419,

 1)

In Cython I was able to calculate this vector (or more important the edge graph) in something like 3 hours, in C it took me 20 minutes. Then I started doing bitwise operations and intrinsics and it is now down to 3 minutes with AVX2.

As for the CPU instructions:
I'm prechecking the compiler flags. So if nothing works it just falls back to computing with uint64_t which should work on any machine.

As for memory leaks: It seems to work fine now. Python calls the __dealloc__() function at closup and when deleting the class and clears all the alloced memeory in C.

Thanks for going through the effort of building that on your machine.

It seems to me that there are the following issues:
- aligned_alloc as used by me only works for C++11 and needs a different header in C++17
- #include <Python.h> doesn't work at all, which it should, so this seems to be a seperate problem, this will go out, as all the functions requiring python objects where replaced
- new/delete works differently on C++17 or my version is just not clean, I will take a look at whats going on

Should be fixed.

I don't know why I didn't remove Python.h, it sure wasn't needed anymore. (Except that it included stdint). However, the pure inclusion of the Python module in C should not give an error.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A47):
> Still doesn't build on OS X:

>
> Cython would be so much easier.

For me, Cython was not easier. I couldn't get the things done the way I wanted. Once you know what should be done in C exactly, then it is probably easier. Now that I have written the code in C++, I could probably do it in Cython as well. When I searched for specific questions in Cython, I just couldn't get any result, but in C or C++ there are tons of helps on the web that helped me.
I am a complete newbie in programming. It feels to me that I aquired at least half of my knowledge through this project. From Cython to C/C++ I had a speedup of about 20 on large Polytopes, probably just because translating it to pure C/C++ helped me better understand what the machine is doing and can be doing.

If you want to add `-march=native`, it should probably be added as compilation flag for all packages (or at least for Python, such that it applies to all Python packages). If you want to go through with this, you should open a new ticket for that. Also note that the option `-march=native` itself is not portable: there be a check that the compiler actually understands it.\n\n3. The `-O3` option is the default, so that's redundant.\n\n4. You have very long lines in your sources. You should try to wrap them to less than 80 characters per line.\n\n5. You're adding a lot of C/Cython code without a single `sig_on`/`sig_check`. That's suspicious as such code cannot be interrupted. See https://cysignals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interrupt.html#interrupt-handling\n\n6. While you're at it, you could also use the cysignals memory allocation functions instead of `PyMem_...`.\n\n7. `hasse_diagram.cc` contains various trivial functions which could easily be replaced by Cython. For example, the various accessor functions could be replaced by just accessing the attributes in Cython (this requires that the class `CombinatorialPolyhedron` is actually declared in Cython). Also `delete_CombinatorialPolyhedron(C)` could be replaced by just `del C`.\n\n8. This is just advice: it's also possible to just include the `.cc` file in the `.pyx` file using `cdef extern from \"hasse_diagram.cc\"`. That way, you can avoid the `.h` file and you give more optimization opportunities to the compiler, since everything is compiled in one C++ file.\n\n9. I'm very worried about portability: you seem to be using a lot of compiler-specific and CPU-specific code. I don't know whether anything will actually break, but there is a substantial risk.\n\n10.

Some purely technical points about the programming:

1. We generally discourage putting `Extension` parameters in `module_list.py`. Better use `# distutils` declarations in Cython files. See https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html#source-files-and-compilation for examples.

2. `-march=native` is not acceptable since we want to distribute binaries. Moreover, it makes no sense to compile just this specific file with `-march=native`. If you want to add `-march=native`, it should probably be added as compilation flag for all packages (or at least for Python, such that it applies to all Python packages). If you want to go through with this, you should open a new ticket for that. Also note that the option `-march=native` itself is not portable: there be a check that the compiler actually understands it.

3. The `-O3` option is the default, so that's redundant.

4. You have very long lines in your sources. You should try to wrap them to less than 80 characters per line.

5. You're adding a lot of C/Cython code without a single `sig_on`/`sig_check`. That's suspicious as such code cannot be interrupted. See https://cysignals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interrupt.html#interrupt-handling

6. While you're at it, you could also use the cysignals memory allocation functions instead of `PyMem_...`.

7. `hasse_diagram.cc` contains various trivial functions which could easily be replaced by Cython. For example, the various accessor functions could be replaced by just accessing the attributes in Cython (this requires that the class `CombinatorialPolyhedron` is actually declared in Cython). Also `delete_CombinatorialPolyhedron(C)` could be replaced by just `del C`.

8. This is just advice: it's also possible to just include the `.cc` file in the `.pyx` file using `cdef extern from "hasse_diagram.cc"`. That way, you can avoid the `.h` file and you give more optimization opportunities to the compiler, since everything is compiled in one C++ file.

9. I'm very worried about portability: you seem to be using a lot of compiler-specific and CPU-specific code. I don't know whether anything will actually break, but there is a substantial risk.

10. Typo: `memomory` -> `memory`

Just to add to what Vincent said: if your Cython code is substantially slower than your C/C++ code, you're doing it wrong. When using Cython properly, it should have the same speed as pure C/C++.

Thanks for the comments and help.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A55):
> Some purely technical points about the programming:
> 
> 1. We generally discourage putting `Extension` parameters in `module_list.py`. Better use `# distutils` declarations in Cython files. See https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html#source-files-and-compilation for examples.

Done. Once I knew what to look for, I found a good example (combinat/partitions.pyx).
> 
> 2. `-march=native` is not acceptable since we want to distribute binaries. Moreover, it makes no sense to compile just this specific file with `-march=native`. If you want to add `-march=native`, it should probably be added as compilation flag for all packages (or at least for Python, such that it applies to all Python packages). If you want to go through with this, you should open a new ticket for that. Also note that the option `-march=native` itself is not portable: there be a check that the compiler actually understands it.
> 

It took be a bit to figure this one out. A solution would be to use function multiversioning as available in GCC >= 6 (https://hannes.hauswedell.net/post/2017/12/09/fmv/). 

If compiled by GCC >= 6 there would be multiple versions of the code available. At runtime the decision is made according to availability of the intrinsics. This way a build be used by different machines (e.g. Network Versions of it or binaries).

At compile time we can then decide for 64 or 32 bits and check wether it is compiled with GCC >= 6.

> 3. The `-O3` option is the default, so that's redundant.

Done.

> 4. You have very long lines in your sources. You should try to wrap them to less than 80 characters per line.
> 

I will take care of that.

> 5. You're adding a lot of C/Cython code without a single `sig_on`/`sig_check`. That's suspicious as such code cannot be interrupted. See https://cysignals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interrupt.html#interrupt-handling
> 

combinat/partitions.pyx seems to be a good example. There this is done as well. I noticed this problem. When doing long calculations I had to kill sage the hard way, when I wanted to do so.

> 6. While you're at it, you could also use the cysignals memory allocation functions instead of `PyMem_...`.
> 
> 7. `hasse_diagram.cc` contains various trivial functions which could easily be replaced by Cython. For example, the various accessor functions could be replaced by just accessing the attributes in Cython (this requires that the class `CombinatorialPolyhedron` is actually declared in Cython). Also `delete_CombinatorialPolyhedron(C)` could be replaced by just `del C`.

I honestly don't know how to do this. At the moment I am thinking about actually importing the class CombinatorialPolyhedron in C++ a number of times with different macros. This way I avoid the multi-version function being decided on a low level, which would slow things done a lot and would break in-lines etc. I could define the functions in the class a number of times, but this would make it even less readable.

Anyway, I'm still thinking about it and trying to figure out what to do.
> 
> 8. This is just advice: it's also possible to just include the `.cc` file in the `.pyx` file using `cdef extern from "hasse_diagram.cc"`. That way, you can avoid the `.h` file and you give more optimization opportunities to the compiler, since everything is compiled in one C++ file.

Great, I like this much better. For the extension thing, one was supposed to use a header. But now I'm able to work without it. I always found it a pain to work with header and cc.

> 9. I'm very worried about portability: you seem to be using a lot of compiler-specific and CPU-specific code. I don't know whether anything will actually break, but there is a substantial risk.

>

See above. GCC sets up multiple functions and at runtime the correct function is being called. If one does not compile with GCC >= 6 then I suggest not using intrinsics at all.

There are not too many scenarios:
- AVX2 (maybe delete this, if there are no substantial losses doing it with AVX-only, however the instructions are easier with AVX2.)
- AVX, but not AVX2
- popcnt, but not AVX
- SSE4.1
- default

This is 64-bit. I have to check out the scenarios for 32-bit yet.

 
> 10. Typo: `memomory` -> `memory`

Done.

Probably. The more important question is whether something can be calculated or not. If one then wants to generate e.g. the `face_lattice` from the `CombinatorialPolyhedron`, initalizing this is much slower than anything in this module.

So what you are suggesting is the following(?): Leave it as it is and delete `-march=native`. This should then somehow be added to Sage's build process (as an option?), so that one can build a more effective version, if one wants to.

 FOLLOW-UPS:
 
 - improve calculation of entries in the flag-vector, while we are at it.
   This takes for every entry in the flag-vector less time then to construct the face-lattice.
 - Improve the calculation of properties of polytopes that depend on the face-lattice (f-vector,edges, ridges, k-faces in general, edge-graph, etc.)

I suppose it makes sense to disable all the intrinsics for this ticket (not done yet) and enable them later (#27103). This way this ticket does not depend on #27122.

Also, if there is anything not working with `CombinatorialPolyhedron` once `-march=native` gets enabled, this would produce an error message for ticket #27122, which I would like to prevent from happening.

It seems like everything boils down to a face iterator.

At least in C++ there doesn't seems to be a difference between the previous `f_vector` calculation and the calculation now being done by iterating over all faces and then adding at the correct dimension.

I guess the correct 'subclass' of `CombinatorialPolyhedron` should then be an iterator and not a copy of itself in C++.

I guess I could do it all in Cython using `PyMem_Malloc` etc. However, as this does not support any overalignment, the iterator would need more memory then needed. But this seems to be ok. About 30kB extra memory for the iterator over a 20-dimensional Polyhedron with 40 facets. However, when recording all faces of this, the overhead might be almost as big as the actual data size.

This ticket is now pretty much where I want it to be. I still need to go through everything and make comments and clean up.

A `FaceIterator`. This is not a proper iterator, as I want it to be flexible with the output. But basically it iterates over all faces and for each face one can get output like its dimension or facet-representation. The `FaceIterator` is used to calculate the `f_vector`, `edges`, `ridges` etc. Also it calculates `ListOfAllFaces`.

It might be worth adding some timings against the current state-of-the-art implementation in `polymake` to show **how fast** this implementation really is. One striking example is

```
    sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(7)
    sage: P1 = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)
    sage: facets_lst = map(list,P1.facets(names=False))
    sage: P2 = polymake("my $P = new Polytope(VERTICES_IN_FACETS=>%s);"%facets_lst)
    sage: %time P1.f_vector()
    CPU times: user 125 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 125 ms
    Wall time: 125 ms
    (1, 5040, 15120, 16800, 8400, 1806, 126, 1)
    sage: %time P2.F_VECTOR
    CPU times: user 39 ms, sys: 4.71 ms, total: 43.7 ms
    Wall time: 13.4 s
    5040 15120 16800 8400 1806 126
```
This is, of course, just a workaround to access polymake directly from within sage (it requires the experimental package `polymake` to be installed). The same computation in a freshly installed `polymake-3.2`  took roughly the same time.

I am not sure how to include this into the doctests because the difference only becomes strikingly visible when `polymake` takes at least seconds.

`@`Travis: I would appreciate if you could have a look at this ticket and the implementation in C / Cython :-)

<a id='comment:95'>**Comment 95:**</a>
A very general question: How much of this are you actually using stuff that is within Sage (and Cython)? In particular, I am wondering if there is a benefit to separating this out into a little standalone package that gets included in Sage with some linking. To me, you could leave the features that use parts of Sage, e.g., `ridge_graph`, in the Sage implementation part, but have a good part of it independent.

typo? `partitions_c.cc` -> `hasse_diagram.cc`?

```
# The actual algorithm is implemented in the C++ file partitions_c.cc
```

typo: `(Knwon` (also that parenthetical should not be its own sentence but combined with the previous one).

Name conflict:

```
from cpython cimport array
import array
```

For `_data` and `_memory`, could you be more specific than a `void` pointer?

In `ListOfFaces`, `self.data()` -> `self._data`, especially since it is internal (and `data()` is not inlined, but it should be, as with any `cdef` simple accessors).

Do you really need the class `ListOfListOfFaces`? That seems like a bit of overkill as it only is used in 1 place and not for anything useful.

Python convention for error messages should be start with a lowercase letter and no full-stop/period at the end.

You should not have `get_next_level` wrapped in a `sig_on`/`sig_off`. That should do its own signal handling.

Instead of blank catching of exceptions to return `-2`, you should use the builtin Cython syntax to raise errors: e.g., in `integer.pyx`:

```
cpdef int _cmp_(left, right) except -2:
```

I do not think how you are handling the memory is the best way. For example, let us consider `_calculate_f_vector`. Instead of catching an exception raised by that function (which you would make it return an `int` and have `except -1:`) in `f_vector` and letting that code free the memory before propagating the error up, you have a big try/except inside the `_calculate_f_vector`, which then returns okay, and have `f_vector` create a new error.

Any `cdef` that is a `void` cannot raise an error; see the parenthetical above.

You should make a `.pxd` file with the relevant `cdef` class and methods set there. It works like a header file and allows people to `cimport` objects. So that way people can make subclasses in different files.

I might have more comments, but these are what I got from a quick lookover.

I can do so. This was due to a wrong assumption. It turns out (not suprisingly I guess) that

```
_mm256_testc_si256((two),(one));
```
takes just as long as

```
one = _mm256_load_si256((const __m256i*)&(A));
two = _mm256_load_si256((const __m256i*)&(B));
_mm256_testc_si256((two),(one));
```
So I can use `uint64_t` until I actually need registers and than load them directly. This also explains, why people out there don't save stuff in formats like `__m256i *`.

If `MemoryAllocator` works great except for the alignment, you could add alignment support to `MemoryAllocator`.

Since you're using divisions, I strongly recommend to add

```
from __future__ import division
```
to make sure that your code works fine when using Python 3 divisions.

In `char_from_incidence` and `get_vertices_from_incidence_matrix2` I have tried doing it correctly. `char_from_incidence` returns 1 on success and 0 means that something went wrong. `get_vertices_from_incidence_matrix2` returns a Cython-Object and so it es okay not to do the `except`?

How am I going to do this? I changed it to do its own signal handling, but that made everything slow down. To be more precise: Calculating the `f_vector` of the 20-dimensional counterexample now takes 3m 39s instead of 2m 57s. Just adding

and

```
signal(SIGINT, signalHandler);
```
(I commented out the check for `interrupt`, to be certain its just this.) What am I doing wrong? What is the advantage of this approach over `sig_on`/`sig_off` thats worth this increase in time?

Good thing I checked, what this actually means. I do want floor division. So this is not what I want, is it? Instead I should us `//` for "floor division"? I don't think there is a single instance, where I use "true division".

I'm also confused with the comment by Travis. `get_next_level` is implemented in C, so I do think that using `sig_on` and `sig_off` (like it used to be) makes sense.

If you need floor division, then you should use `//` indeed. You should still keep the `from `__future__` import division` to catch mistakes (if you mistakenly use `/` instead of `//` it will behave the same on Python 2 and Python 3).

What Jeroen initially said was correct, I meant for it to have `sig_on`/`sig_off` inside the function, but I misread that it was implemented in C. So you can disregard that comment.

Wasn't sure how to exactly squash pushed commits, but I guess restarting a clean branch does the job.

<a id='comment:5'>**Comment 5:**</a>
I have lots of small comments while reading this code:

1. It would makes things easier to understand if you really removed the vectorization stuff instead of just commenting it out. That way, we can completely focus the review on the generic code (without needing the worry about the commented-out parts). More generally, remove commented-out code like `# cdef tuple lists_facet_repr #might need this for flag-vector`

2. It's really hard to understand what all the code does: I'm missing some kind of "big picture" documentation to explain what this is all about. For example, when I see

```
cdef class FaceIterator:
    cdef uint64_t *face
    cdef int current_dimension, dimension, record_dimension, lowest_dimension
    cdef MemoryAllocator _mem
    cdef uint64_t ***newfaces2
    cdef tuple newfaces_lists
    cdef uint64_t ***newfaces
    cdef uint64_t **forbidden
    cdef size_t *nr_faces
    cdef size_t *nr_forbidden
    cdef int *first_time
    cdef size_t yet_to_yield, face_length, nr_facets, nr_vertices
    cdef size_t *output1
    cdef size_t *output2
    cdef int nr_lines
```
I don't want to review this anymore. You really need to add a lot more comments.

3. The Cython doctests are hard to read: all the output just comes at the end and it's difficult to see which code produced it. You could instead define a bunch of test functions (either in the doctest or in the Cython sources) and then call those from Python.

4. I sometimes wonder if it wouldn't be easier to abstract some things in C++ or Python classes, for example using something like `std::vector<uint64_t>` or `array.array` instead of `uint64_t*`.

5. Do you really need `vertex_to_bit_dictionary`? It's probably more efficient to replace `vertex_to_bit_dictionary[i]` by an inline function

```
cdef inline uint64_t vertex_to_bit_dictionary(int i):
    return (<uint64_t>1) << (64 - i - 1)
```

6. In `char_from_tuple` (and other similar functions), please use `except -1` for exceptions and `return 0` in the non-exceptional case. Then you don't even need to write `return 0` since that's the default.

7. Typos `lenght` -> `length`

8. In various places, you use `int` as indices while most other places use `size_t`. Is there a reason for that? Note that Python typically uses `Py_ssize_t` for loops like that.

9. `return int(bitcount)` is converting a C `size_t` to a Python `int` to a C `int`. Just `return bitcount` should be sufficient.

10. There is no point at all to put `sig_check()` right after `sig_off()` or right before `sig_on()`.

21. Is there a good reason to implement `face_iter` and `faces` separately? Isn't it sufficient to have the iterator only?

In `CombinatorialPolyhedron.f_vector` there is a small description of the basic algorithm. Maybe it is of help.
I will add comments to all those variable declarations.

Without intrinsics this seems to be a good approach. However, I have now idea how to force array.array or vector to keep alignment. Also I never change the size of the `uint64_t*`.

I got a warning about comparison of unsigned and signed integer. This is how I "solved" it. Cython seems to translate `len()` to a signed integer, then I get warnings.
So `Py_ssize_t` is a good type for an index in there? Or just leave it up to the compiler?

I don't care. I just figured, that people want a `faces()` anyway. To me, there is no need to that function. Partly, its there because of historic reasons.

`Py_ssize_t` is the type of `len(something)` in Python. So, if you're doing something like `for i in range(len(something))`, then indeed use `cdef Py_ssize_t i`.

What if you're looking for one face with a specific property, or counting each face with a given property? Then you don't need to generate a list of all faces.

In general, Python seems to move away from returning lists of things to returning views/iterators. For example, `range()` is an iterator in Python 3 but a list in Python 2.

I am aware of advantages of an iterator.

This raises again the question of wether my construction makes sense and I am almost certain, there is a better way of doing so:

So I have a `FaceIterator` that can swiftly go to next face (and return its dimension on default). Before jumping to the next face, we can also grab the vertex-representation, facet-representation. In the future it might be nice to add more functions, but so much for now.

At the moment I have a complicated method `CombinatorialPolyhedron.face_iter()` that yields information of each face depending on a bunch of arguments. But I am almost certain, that this is not a good way of doing it. Probably I should return `FaceIterator`, which is an iterator. What's a good way of implementing an iterator, that can return various outputs? I'm thinking of something like

```
sage: cython('''                            
....: from sage.rings.integer import Integer
....: cdef class FaceIterator:
....:     cdef size_t nr_faces
....:     cdef size_t i
....:     def __init__(self, number):
....:         self.nr_faces = number
....:         self.i = 0
....:     
....:     def __iter__(self):
....:         return self
....:     
....:     def __next__(self):
....:         current = Integer(self.i)
....:         self.i += 1
....:         if self.i > self.nr_faces:
....:             raise StopIteration
....:         else:
....:             return Integer(current)
....:             
....:     next = __next__
....:     
....:     def give_facet_repr(self):
....:         # some actual calculation happening here
....:         return 'this is the facet repr of the current face'
....:         
....:     def give_vertex_repr(self):
....:         # some calculation here
....:         return 'this is the vertex_repr'
....:         
....:     def skip_a_face(self):
....:         # what I'm thinking about is the option
....:         # of not visiting any faces of the current face 
....:         self.i += 1
....: ''')
sage: a = FaceIterator(20)
sage: next(a)
0
sage: next(a)
1
sage: a.skip_a_faces()
sage: a.skip_a_faces()
sage: next(a)
4
sage: a.give_facet_repr()
'this is the facet repr of the current face'
sage: a.give_vertex_repr()
'this is the vertex_repr'

```
I guess I know how to do this, but I don't know, if this any good.

This way the user would actually be able to use the face iterator + I don't have to think of all possible outputs when creating `CombinatorialPolyhedron.face_iter()`. One can easily add more outputs like constructing the `facets` of the current face, or return a `CombinatorialPolyhedron` which is the current face etc.

At the moment, such extensions would be hard to do.

One could also yield a something like `CombinatorialFace`, but I'm a bit worried about the overhead. Also things like "do not revisit subfaces" (i.e. when the face is simplicial and there is really no point in doing so) or setting a maximal dimension etc. are not possible.

Another thing I could do to make life easier: Split this ticket in a number of tickets as good as possible.

So for this ticket there could be "only" the class `CombinatorialPolyhedron` with a `FaceIterator` that calculates the `f_vector`.

Follow up tickets would be
- `edges` and `ridges`
- `hasse_diagram`/`face_lattice`
- maybe even all those accesors in `FaceIterator`

How about it? This would remove at least 1000 lines in the current code for later.

Mainly I just changed `FaceIterator` to be an iterator. This also helped my remove most cython examples.

`FaceIterator` and `ListOfAllFaces` should take care of the special cases themselves now.

`CombinatorialPolyhedron` almost doesn't know anything about dual anymore. This is a way to initialize `FaceIterator`.

I guess Cython takes care of that automatically. I read somewhere, that one should do that and indeed this seems to be true for defining a Python iterator class.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
I am going through the doc right now.

A general issue I noticed:

```diff
 INPUT:
 
-- `foo` -- lorem ipsum
+- ``foo`` -- lorem ipsum
```
so it is formatted as code and not latex. There might be other cases in the docstrings themselves that should be code formatted. These bullet points for `INPUT:` do not, by general Sage convention, end in a period/full-stop.

Another general issue, three `.`'s are needed here:

```diff
         Traceback (most recent call last):
-        ..
+        ...
         ValueError: entries of `tup` are not distinct
```

Typo: <code>\`ouput\`</code>

Instead of doing the `next(it)` a bunch of times, how about doing

```sage
sage: [next(it) for _ in range(14)]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
```

```diff
     The algorithm to visit all proper faces exactly once is roughly
-    equivalent to:
+    equivalent to::
 
-    faces = [set(facet) for facet in self.facets()]
-    ComputeNextStep(facets, [])
+        faces = [set(facet) for facet in self.facets()]
+        ComputeNextStep(facets, [])
```
(This will not be executed as code as there is no leading `sage:`.)
Similar comment for the `ALGORITHM:` block in `FaceIterator`'s class-level docstring.

You can use `bint` for `dual` in `FaceIterator.__init__`.

I would drop the `An` from the repr of `FaceIterator` (this is another general convention we mostly stick to).

```diff
-raise StopIteration()
+raise StopIteration
```

```diff
-Returns the length of the vertex_repr.
+Return the length of the :meth:`vertex_repr`.
```
and similar for `facet_repr`.

You should use `Return` instead of `Returns` (I think the former is called the definitive form of the verb). (I think this is a PEP8 thing; at the very least it is a Sage convention.)

The tests for `vertex_repr_length` and `facet_repr_length` I would say are not so meaningful. I think better tests would be to check it against `it.length_vertex_repr() == len(it.vertex_repr())`.

You might find the `.. WARNING::` environment useful for the `next_face()` docstring.

It is good to add a `TestSuite(foo).run()` call in the `__init__` method doctests.

This is malformatted:

```diff
       * ``nr_lines`` -- for bounded Polyhedra, this should be the
-      default: ``None``. For unbounded Polyhedra, this needs to be set
-      to the correct nr of lines, i.e. the the maximum nr of lines with
-      linearly independent directions in the Polyehdron.
+        default: ``None``. For unbounded Polyhedra, this needs to be set
+        to the correct nr of lines, i.e. the the maximum nr of lines with
+        linearly independent directions in the Polyehdron.
```

```diff
       * ``unbounded`` -- for bounded Polyhedra, this should be the
-      default ``None``. For unbounded Polyhedra, this needs to be set
-      to the correct nr of lines, i.e. the the maximum nr of lines with
-     linearly independent directions in the Polyehdron.
+        default ``None``. For unbounded Polyhedra, this needs to be set
+        to the correct nr of lines, i.e. the the maximum nr of lines with
+        linearly independent directions in the Polyehdron.
```

It is good to spell things out in the doc IMO:

```diff
-Specifying the nr of lines is important::
+Specifying the number of lines is important::
```

There's a few places you use `f_vector` that is plain formatted. I think you either should use <code>\`f\`-vector</code>/`f-vector` or <code>\`\`f_vector\`\`</code>.

```diff
-If `names` is set to True, then names of the vertices are used.
+If ``names`` is ``True``, then names of the vertices are used.
```

In general, do not feel the need to stick to 80 chars/line in code for things like

```
                self._f_vector = \
                    tuple(Integer(f_vector[dim+1-i]) for i in range(dim+2))
```
as I think it makes the code harder to read.

I might have more comments later, but that is what I got for now.

The fail on Darwin is due to an issue, I fixed already (comment 156). Declaring `lenfaces` as constant at function call, might have solved it as well. Also this build issues number of warnings due to python2.7/Python.h being incompatible with C++17. We had those problems before, where a mere `#include "Python.h."` gives trouble on OS X with C++17. Now its only a warning and not an error though.

Both Ubuntu patchbots (44e979ad077a and quasar) use an old version of the files. I don't know why. `chunktype` has long been removed from `helper.cc`.

Thanks, went through the entire document and tried to fix all of those issues.

Replaced `int` by `bint` wherever I use only `True` and `False` anyway.

Added `__reduce__` with and `NotImplementedError` to the `ListOfFaces`, `FaceIterator` and `ListOfAllFaces`. One could try to implement that, but I don't see an advantage of that.

I'm confused: if it's fixed, why does the build fail?

```

This has me wondering, what went wrong.

Probably, I should have included

```
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;
```

in `helper.cc` in order for `calloc` to work the way I use it. Also I should probably `return -1` if `calloc` returns `NULL` and add `except -1` to `get_next_level`. Woudn't give a nice error message yet, but at least prevent thing from crashing if `calloc` returns `NULL`.

Alternatively I could still try to allocate the memory with `int ommitfacearray[lenfaces-1]` and pass `lenfaces` to `get_next_level` as `const size_t`.

A third way would be to allocate the memory with `int *ommitfacearray = new int[lenfaces-1]` and still have `lenfaces` be of type `const size_t`.

A fourth way, would be to allocate the memory in Cython and pass it to the function. Then one could also allocate the array only once for an entire `FaceIterator`.

Is my guess for the `Segmentation fault` even likely?

`new[]` worked fine before, so I tried that. I hope this solves the issue.

I did some googling and got the impression, that `calloc` etc. is not really the C++ way of doing it.

Btw, helper.cc doesn't use anything C++-specific anymore, so if necessary I could switch to C again. At the moment I don't think it matters.

It looks like I stumbled over the same problem at my machine. I changed function names in `helper.cc` and sage build would completely ignore those changes. Meaning I couldn't use the functions by their new names, but I could use them by their old names.

Somewhere `helper.cc` was cached and it was constantly taken from there.

Deleting the cashed files in

`src/build/cythonized/build/cythonized/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron`
and
`sage/src/build/cythonized/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron`

seems to be the solution. The patchbots don't do that I assume.

What's going on?

There seem to be scenarios where `KeyboardInterrupt` cause sage to crash. It will not use CPU anymore, so somehow it seems to work. But it will look exactly like a failed interrupt, so nothing works anymore in that session.

It seems to happen between 0--10 percent of the time, when trying to interrupt:

```
sage: from itertools import combinations
sage: N = combinations(range(200),199)
sage: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(N)
sage: C.dimension()
199
sage: C.f_vector()
```

I have tried to figure it out, but I have no idea, what could have happened.

I hope this is easier to read now. I actually went through all the files.

At the moment the tests with `alarm` are unstable.

I don't know why. Can anyone figure it out. Or should I just remove them? Especially `CombinatorialPolyhedron.f_vector()` seems to be pretty easy to trace.

If anyone cares, here is a list of some of the more important renamings I did:

Maybe this issue of an interrupt not completing might not even be caused by me.\n2. The C++ files are not recompiled when they change (at least not always). I can add a syntax error and the compiler will not notice.\n\nI was thinking about changing the way, I get all the incidences again. This wouldn't be a mayor change, but still a change. Right now, I'm intersecting every face with every facet to get all incidences. It would suffice to intersect every face with all \"siblings\" of some fixed parent. Then again, the examples I could compute with 30GB of RAM all took less than 10 minutes.

Is there anything else I should do at this point?

For some reason, I accidentally added my notes and old files. I removed them in `git` again. But I don't think its worth a push for now.

I see two open problems at the moment:

1. Unstable interrupts in the tests. Remove the tests or fix it. Maybe this issue of an interrupt not completing might not even be caused by me.
2. The C++ files are not recompiled when they change (at least not always). I can add a syntax error and the compiler will not notice.

I was thinking about changing the way, I get all the incidences again. This wouldn't be a mayor change, but still a change. Right now, I'm intersecting every face with every facet to get all incidences. It would suffice to intersect every face with all "siblings" of some fixed parent. Then again, the examples I could compute with 30GB of RAM all took less than 10 minutes. And then it seems to me, it is almost impossible to obtain any useful information from a Hasse diagram of that size. So I'm not sure, if there is even use to optimization at this end. Unless, somebody thinks this should be optimized if possible, I'll leave it as it is. It's at least almost as fast in creating the face lattice as polymake the way it is.

I gave a talk today in the seminar of Michael Joswig's work group.

I added the explanation of the algorithm in pictures. Maybe this is of help. I think it is much better to comprehend than my pseudo code.

I also added the runtime comparison to polymake from the vertex-facet incidences matrix.

I would be thankful for a review and/or comments on what to improve.

Btw, the tests involving `alarm` are still unstable and sometimes fail. Maybe the interrupt is just not stable. But, maybe I also did some mistake. I don't know. There is no desperate need for the tests from my perspective.

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
Main comment:

- the file `base.pyx` is huge. It would be nice to split it.

Technical comments

- no need to inherit from `SageObject` (this is useful if you want your objects to interact with other Sage objects which is is not the case)
- why `calculate_dimension` is not a method of `ListOfFaces`?
- `nr_vertices` sometimes return a SageInteger and sometimes a Python int (because `len(X)` returns a Python integer)
- `set_request_dimension` is a weird name
- Are we supposed to change `set_request_dimension` during iteration as follows

```
sage: P = polytopes.cuboctahedron()
sage: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)
sage: it = C.face_iter()
sage: next(it)
0
sage: it.set_request_dimension(2)
sage: next(it)
2
sage: it.set_request_dimension(1)
sage: next(it)
1
```
  if not this `request_dimension` would better be set in the constructor (`__init__`), if yes then it should be documented what does this do.
- `get_dimension` is a weird name. It would better be more explicit `current_face_dimension` or something similar (no need for the word `get`)

doc of `combinatorial_polyhedron/base.pyx`

- the first line would better be the title of the module (eg look like `rings/integer.pyx`)
- `[...] works on every lattice that is obtained by from [...]`
- Could you precise what the sentence `Representations in this module:` mean. Do you mean that it is the terminology you use in this module?
- `The first bit represent` -> `represents`
- `we started with` -> `we started from`
- I would rather use `compute` rather than `calculate`
- polyhedron used as a noun as no need to be upper cased `Polyhedron` -> `polyhedron`

This is doing a typecast, as it assumes `(signed) long` as input.

I'm using `size_t` in most cases. But I guess for my use case this is just fine.

"All objects in Sage should derive from the Cython extension class `SageObject`"
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_in_python.html?highlight=sageobject

Now I'm a bit confused. The way I understand this now, is that any class a user is intended to see needs to be a `SageObject`. Some Cython class way in the background does not need that.

In my case `CombinatorialPolyhedron` and `FaceIterator` should be `SageObjects`, but other classes do not have to be?

Indeed, for the range of integers you look at you are very far from the overflow.

should I name the module `geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedorn/combinatorial_polyhedron.pyx` then?

The name of the file is fine. I was referring to the first line in the file

```
+CombinatorialPolyhedron gathers several algorithms of Polyhedra depending only
+on the vertex-facet incidences.
```
that should be

```
Combinatorial polyhedron

This module gathers algorithms for polyhedra that only depends on the
vertex-facet incidences.
```

<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
This comment concerns only `CombinatorialPolyhedron` in `base.pxd` and `base.pyx`

I added a small commit on top of your branch which just consists of documentation modifications. You might want to review my changes. When they are important, I discuss them below. In a second commit I upgraded the method `facets` to avoid iterating twice through the faces. You are free to use the commit as you wish and I put them an a distinct branch.

The sentence

```
    # Edges, ridges and incidences are stored in a pointer of pointers.
    # This number determines how many edges are stored in ``edges[0]``,
    # how many ridges are stored in ``ridges[0]`` etc.
    cdef size_t _length_edges_list
```
is a bit unclear. Do you mean that the arrays pointed at `_edges[0]`, `_ridges[0]` and `_face_lattice_incidences[0]` have the same length? 

The attribute `_mem_tuple` is not used. What is it inteded for?


Why this very ambiguous terminology

```
- Vertices              -- ``[vertices, rays, lines]`` of the polyhedron.
```
In `PPL` the use the word *generators* for this (as opposed to *constraints* for equalities and inequalities).

This is very cryptic

```
:class:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.combinatorial_polyhedron.face_iterator.FaceIterator`::

    sage: C.face_iter()
    Iterator over the proper faces of a polyhedron of dimension 4

    sage: C.face_iter(2)
    Iterator over the 2-faces of a polyhedron of dimension 4
```
The above doctest is mostly intended for a user reading the documentation. As a user, I tried the naive

```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(4)
sage: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)
sage: for f in C.face_iter():
....:     print(f)
```
and was quite disappointed to see a list of integers. I think that at this point in the documentation, it is much better to provide a concrete example of computations. If the access to `face_iter` is already for an advanced user then you can just remove the example.

In the documentation of the `ComintorialPolyhedron` class you had three examples dealing with the fact that `nr_lines` is mandatory. I removed the two last and made them inside `TESTS`. You can freely remove them if you feel they are useless.

`is_Polyhedron` (line 275) and `is_LatticePolytope` (line 288) are old style coding from when Sage was created. Just use straight `isinstance`.

At lines 299

```
        else:
            # Input is different from ``Polyhedron`` and ``LatticePolytope``.
            if nr_lines is None:
                # bounded polyhedron
```
it is possible that the user specified `nr_lines=0` in which case you might also want to set `self._unbounded = False`. Also, when `nr_lines < 0` you would better raise a `ValueError`.

At line 324, the sentence is incomplete

```
# At the moment this test only works for input being
```

At line 346, the following test is not exhaustive enough

```
elif isinstance(data, Integer):
```
as it will not catch Python integers

```
sage: CombinatorialPolyhedron(3r)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: argument 2 to map() must support iteration
```
You should be using

```
sage: import numbers
sage: isinstance(3r, numbers.Integral)
True
sage: isinstance(3, numbers.Integral)
True
```


On the class `Polyhedron` the how-many-are-there methods are called 
`n_vertices`, ` n_rays`, `n_lines`, `n_inequalities` (with alias `n_facets`), `n_equations` while you choose `nr_vertices`, `nr_facets`. Why this difference?

line 625-627

```
            return Integer(self._length_Vrep)
        else:
            return Integer(len(self.vertices()))
```
line 737

```
        return Integer(self._nr_facets)
```
you can use `smallInteger`

Thanks.

About names: There are a number of names that should probably changed to be consistent with the (up to date) naming conventions.

How do I call the methods that get the vertices/rays/lines of a face?
How do I call the method that gets the facets it is contained in?

I will change nr_... to n_... all through the files eventually.

I will make this more precise. _edges[0][0] represents the first index of the first edge _edges[0][1] the second of the first _edges[1][0] the first of the second and so on.
_edges[0] stores a total of up _length_edges_list length.

I want to avoid jumping through memory like crazy, but I also want to avoid using too large chunks of continuous memory. Hence this intermediate solution.

It is used. The MemoryAllocators that store edges, ridges and face_lattice_incidences get put there. The module first calculates the edges and on success copies the data. Only then does it also copy the MemoryAllocator. Otherwise, the memory is free again.

In `FaceIterator` I use atoms (which might be generators or constraints depending on whether we do the dual approach or not).
I was thinking about this and then figured that Vrepresentation is a pretty bad name for ``[vertices, rays, lines]`` anyway.
I don't care. I can change this at some point.

No it was not intended to be for an advanced user. I will try setting up the result of the iterater as a class `CombinatorialFace` just like with `Polyhedron.faces`. If this does not have a noticable effect on runtime, I think this is the much better solution.
This would also make `FaceIterator` smaller.

What do I do for matrix?  isinstance(M,sage.matrix.matrix0.Matrix)?

By `nr_lines=0`, I mean that the Polyhedron is unbounded. Maybe this is not a good choice and I should put unbounded as an extra argument for the input.

Thanks. I wasn't aware of this at all. In particual I didn't know of the nice solution. Somewhere else I do a `try: if a == Integer(a)`...

Historic. I changed at at findpoly.org now to be consistent with Polyhedron. I should change this.

Just some small things. I am likely to accept a positive review on next round.

- You use custom bitsets. Why not using the one provided in [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) `sage.data_structures/bitest.[pxi,pxd]`? Most of it already uses optimized routines from GMP.

- The name `ListOfAllFaces` sounds really strange.

- It would be good to simplfy and uniformize string representations
  - CombinatorialPolyhedron

  ```
  Combinatorial type of a polyhedron of dimension 4 with 16 vertices
  ```
    would better be

  ```
  A 4-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron with 16 vertices
  ```
  - FaceIterator

  ```
  Iterator over the 2-faces of a polyhedron of dimension 4
  ```
    would better be

  ```
  Iterator over the 2-faces of a 4-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron
  ```
  - CombinatorialFace

  ```
  Combinatorial type of a 2-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional polyhedron
  ```
    would better be

  ```
  A 2-dimensional face of 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron
  ```

- in `face_iterator.pyx` and `list_of_faces.pyx` there is no need to redefine the terminology already used in `base.pyx`. Just make a reference to the module.

- If the error at line 2012 in of `base.pyx` can happen in a normal run it should be doctested. If not, replace it with a `RuntimeError`.

- The module title should be words (not ListOfAllFaces or ListOfFaces)

I wasn't aware of this at all. At some point I was looking for it but didn't find it.

To compute the f-vector etc. very fast, it seems to be important to not allocate any memory at all during the iteration (I actually should move the one alloc in `get_next_level` to a global property in `FaceIterator` as it will speed things up by about 4 percent).

In order to make this all work, I would have to use `bitset_t` directly.

I guess I could. At the moment, it doesn't seem to me that the code will get a lot easier. Instead of allocating my memory with `MemoryAllocator` I would then allocate it with `Bitset`. The advantage of reinventing the wheel is that I could later enable intrinsics, which would give a speedup of at least 2 on many computers. I don't know how important this is.

This type of error is mostly meant for the case of an interrupt happening (in this case it will not be raised though). I don't expect this to happen ever.

> It would be good to simplfy and uniformize string representations


Here are two more issues with the repr:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(ieqs=[[0,1]]); P
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^1 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 ray
sage: CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)
Combinatorial type of a polyhedron of dimension 1 with 1 vertices
```
Why do you suppress the information about the ray here?

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(ieqs=[[0,1,0]]); P
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex, 1 ray, 1 line
```
This is correct if we consider P to be the product of a single ray starting from the origin and a line. But this polyhedron itself does not have a one-dimensional face (aka vertex) in the usual definition of faces. On the other hand,

```
sage: CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)
Combinatorial type of a polyhedron of dimension 2 with 0 vertices
```
is correct, but suppresses the information about rays and lines.

Also, might it be worth being able to provide the information about atoms, coatoms and ignored facets (if any) in the lattice that is used to iterate through all faces?

Can you be more precise? I don't get what you want.
Should I store the information somewhere, if one does `ignore_subfaces`?
What do you mean by provide the information about atoms and coatoms?

At the moment the `FaceIterator` is just an Iterator with two extra methods (that manipulate iteration). I don't know, how much sense it makes, to provide more methods.

The method `ignored_facet` does not make any sense at the moment. For an unbounded polyhedron, there is no facet at infinity as part of the input. Not providing the facet at infinity works as well (and this is the way the Iterator is set up).

One could add a method, that provides the faces that are currently ignored.

Can we agree on a name, before I change it?

This class stores all faces of the polyhedron to generate then all cover relations for the face lattice. Possibly in the future it can also calculate a specified flag vector.

What would be a good name for it?

`FaceLattice(Creator)`, `CoverRelations`. I can't think of a better name at the moment.

I now give the number of facets. This seems more natural to me, as this is how `CombinatorialPolyhedron` is constructed from the facets. 
This seems to be more meaningful for many unbounded polyhedra as well (unless one wants to count lowest dimensional proper faces as "vertices").

Also it seems hard to determine the difference between vertices and rays from an incidence matrix.

At the moment this module is not optimized for unbounded polyhedra, but I guess this should be left for later (e.g. the vertices are recalculated every time).

The representation has changed to give the number of facets now.
So this output won't happen like this anymore.

Anyway, one has to set the correct `nr_lines`, when giving a list of facets for an unbounded polyhedron.

`if the polyhedron is unbounded, then rays and lines and the extra argument ``nr_lines`` are required`

It his hard to determine from a list, which elements of the `Vrepresentation` are actually vertices and which are rays (and in one instance it is impossible to distinct between `nr_lines = 0` and `nr_lines = 1` just from this input, hence the requirement).
If the polyhedron is not unbounded, than the algorithm can just proceed on the polar polyhedron, this is not possible in the unbounded case.

I think the input arguments should be more intuitive.
I also think this should happen in a follow up ticket.

Instead of doing it all over `n_lines`, one should have another argument `is_bounded`.
I think this is easier to use.

As far as I know there are two ways of solving this.

Either use the macro `__cplusplus` to determine the c++ version and not use `inline` if it is not available. (This would be a quick fix I guess).

Use `-std=c++11` as compile argument.

Any opinions?

Add the `-std=c++11` option to the concerned extension

```
    Extension('sage.geometry.polyhedron.combinatorial_polyhedron.bit_vector_operations.cc',

Some attributes like `bitrep_vertices` might have been an unfortunate choice:

As they are accessed by other classes, I'm forced to compute e.g. `bitrep_vertices` on initialization. If `CombinatorialPolyhedron` was ever to be a parent of `Polyhedron_base` (see #10777), this would force a polyhedron to compute the incidence matrix right away.

From my understanding, the decorator `@lazy_attribute` is not available for extension types directly. I'm thinking of changing those attributes to methods, such that there is a method `bitrep_facets` and an attribute `_bitrep_facets`. This way one can later change this to be lazily evaluated.

Any thoughts?
