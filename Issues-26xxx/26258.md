Since they are enumerated, you should not have to call `sorted` on any of them (it iterates according to the enumeration). So none of these changes should be necessary.

The `L = list(F)` test is not very good. Perhaps a better test would be:

```
sage: F = FiniteSemigroups().example(('a','b','c'))
sage: L = list(F)
sage: L[7].rank()
7
sage: all(x.rank() == i for i,x in enumerate(L))
True
```

The changed tests in `map` destroy one of the key parts of the result of `map`: the iteration order does not change. So I am guessing the heart of the problem is in the iterator for `SymmetricGroup` being a `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` and the non-determinism there. I think you are better changing it to `Compositions(4)` and then using these:

```
sage: R = Compositions(4).map(attrcall('partial_sums'))   # For the generic test
[[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4], [1, 4], [2, 3, 4], [2, 4], [3, 4], [4]]
sage: C = Compositions(4).map(attrcall('major_index')).list()   # For the WARNING:: test
[6, 3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 3, 0]
```
