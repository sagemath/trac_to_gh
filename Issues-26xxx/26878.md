The `_element_constructor` machinery in `Parent` has support both for `P._element_constructor_` being a bound and an unbound method. However, there is exactly one case where an unbound method occurs and that is for `KleshchevPartitions`.

It would be good to simplify the `_element_constructor` handling to always assume a bound method, but then `KleshchevPartitions` must be fixed.
