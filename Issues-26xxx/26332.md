> (A) `ore_algebra` 0.3 is not working with Sage for a wile and upstream does not release versions anymore. 

> (B) Hence, we should [...] fetch `ore_algebra` directly from upstream.

I don't see how premise (A) implies conclusion (B). There are other packages that don't have releasea and which are still packaged normally.

It is an external package with a dependency on Sage. I think people should install it from pip or whatever they like; I don't see the point of having it as a Sage package. And while I try to make sure that the master branch always works with the latest Sage release, the Sage package is broken half of the time.

There are many packages for which this argument could be made, but we still ship them as Sage packages. The advantages of having a Sage package are user friendliness (`sage -i ore_algebra` works) and automatic updates with version checking.

> I try to make sure that the master branch always works with the latest Sage release

But not everybody uses the latest Sage release. You may break stuff if a newer version of `ore_algebra` doesn't work with an older version of Sage.

If it works, yes, except that I personally consider `sage -i` a strictly less user-friendly option than `sage -pip install` (< `pip install` < `apt install`).

Yes, of course. I'm alking about the master branch... Fwiw I also try to keep it compatible with earlier versions when that's easy to do.

PS regarding Thierry's version: I personally don't like the idea of a “package” that actually installs a version that was not checked by the packager, but I won't argue if people want that.
