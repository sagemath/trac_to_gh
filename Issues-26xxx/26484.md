A while-we-are-at-it:

```diff
-    if not n: return
+    if not n:
+        return
-    if n < 0: raise ValueError("n must be non-negative")
+    if n < 0:
+        raise ValueError("n must be non-negative")
```

This is now a grammatical error:

```diff
-    number of colors.
-
-    ::
+    number of colors ::
```
Remove the space before the `::` so it generates a colon after colors.

Can you use Python `set`'s here instead of Sage `Set`'s:

```
            # make the dict into a set for quick uniqueness checking
            S += Set([Set([(k,tuple(C[k])) for k in C])])
```
(or at least for intermediate computations)?

For this change:

```diff
-            raise RuntimeError("It looks like you have found a counterexample to a very old conjecture. Please do not loose it ! Please publish it, and send a post to sage-devel to warn us. I implore you ! Nathann Cohen ")
+            raise RuntimeError("it looks like you have found a counterexample to a very old conjecture. Please do not loose it ! Please publish it, and send a post to sage-devel to warn us. I implore you ! Nathann Cohen ")
```
the `it` should be capitalized because the error message is so long and multiple sentences. Also, you should remove Nathann Cohen from the error message and say "We implore you!".

Everything else LGTM.
