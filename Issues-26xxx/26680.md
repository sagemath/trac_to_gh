We clean (PEP8 and avoid `.vertices` / `.edges`) methods related to graph visualization: `_color_by_label`, `latex_options`, `set_latex_options`, `layout`, `layout_spring`, `layout_ranked`, `layout_extend_randomly`, `layout_circular`, `layout_tree`, `layout_graphviz`, `_layout_bounding_box`, `_circle_embedding`, `_line_embedding`, `graphplot`, `_rich_repr_`, `plot`, `show`, `plot3d`, `show3d`, `_keys_for_vertices`, `graphviz_string`, `graphviz_to_file_named`, and `tachyon_vertex_plot`.

Remaining calls to `.vertices`:
- `layout_circular` calls `_circle_embedding` with a list of vertices ordered by `.vertices`. Changing this will change the layout.

- `_keys_for_vertices` returns a mapping vertex to unique string identifier as required by `dot2tex`. It uses the order of `self.vertices()` to build the mapping. It is then used in `graphviz_string` and `layout_graphviz`. 

Any advice for these 2 cases is more than welcome ;)
