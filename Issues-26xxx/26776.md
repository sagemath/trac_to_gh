Some useful micro-optimizations can be done to `MonoDict` and `TripleDict`:

1. Replace `isinstance(x, KeyedRef)` by `type(x) is KeyedRef`.

2. In `__getitem__` and `__contains__`, do not check whether the `KeyedRef` for the key is dead: we are passed a reference to it as argument, so it must be alive.

3. Replace `PyWeakref_GetObject` by `PyWeakref_GET_OBJECT`.

4. Optimize the hash used in `lookup()` by throwing away useless low-order bits.

We also add an inline function `is_dead_keyedref` for `isinstance(x, KeyedRef) and PyWeakref_GetObject(x) is Py_None` to simplify some code.

In more detail: if we find a dead weakref in `__getitem__` (or `__contains__` which is similar), `lookup()` guarantees that the `id()` of the key in the dict matches the given key. If it's really the same key, then the weakref should not be dead since we have a live reference (passed as argument to `__getitem__`). If it's not the same key, then it must be a recycled `id()`. But that can only happen once the original key has been freed from memory, which happens after the weakref callback, which should remove the entry from the dict.

So I don't see any scenario how a dead weakref could be found in `__getitem__`, but I might be missing something...
