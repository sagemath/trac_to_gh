Experience has shown that the modern modular decomposition linear algorithms are extremely tricky to implement correctly.  Adding an implementation of the much more straightforward O(n<sup>3</sup>)algorithm from Habib and Maurer "On the X-Join decomposition for undirected graphs" would give us a baseline to test against.

Also move modular decomposition into the graph decompositions directory.

Some comments:
- instead of inner function `vertex_set`, use:

```
from itertools import chain
frozenset(chain.from_iterable(loe))
```
- Do you really need to sort vertices ? For instance, the gamma function returns a dictionary keyed by tuples of sorted vertices. Can't you instead use frozensets as keys ? similarly, you could keyed dictionary `components` by frozensets to avoid `e = tuple(sorted((v1, v)))`. Sinc ewe are working on the transition to Python3 that forbid comparison of objects of different types, it is better to avoid sorting when not needed. Also, sorting takes some time.
- When you do `components[old_edge] = components[e]` wouldn't it be more efficient to use union-find (`DisjointSet`) ? If I understand well, you merge groups of edges, right ? 
- what is `either_connected_or_not_connected` ?

Thanks for looking at this.

Your first three points are accurate, and I will fix things accordingly (I'll also change the other places where I use sorted tuples to identify subtrees).  I wasn't aware of `DisjointSet`, it's very cool.

`either_connected_or_disconnected` is a part of the existing modular decomposition infrastructure. It tests if a given vertex is either connected to all the vertices in the module or is disconnected from all the vertices in the module.

A few comments:

- use iterator over vertices and edges when there is no need to create a list

```diff
- pieces = DisjointSet([frozenset(e) for e in graph.edges(labels=False, sort=False)])
- for v in graph.vertices():
+ pieces = DisjointSet(frozenset(e) for e in graph.edge_iterator(labels=False))
+ for v in graph:
```

- Testing if something is 0 or empty can be done like that

```diff
- if graph.order() == 0:
+ if not graph.order():
```

- 

```diff
- elif not graph.complement().is_connected():
-    root = create_series_node()
-    root.children = [habib_maurer_algorithm(graph.subgraph(vertices=sg), g_classes)
-             for sg in graph.complement().connected_components()]
-    return root
+ g_comp = graph.complement()
+ if g_comp.is_connected():
+     root = create_series_node()
+     root.children = [habib_maurer_algorithm(graph.subgraph(vertices=sg), g_classes)
+                 for sg in g_comp.connected_components()]
+     return root
```

- 

```diff
- if g_classes == None:
+ if g_classes is None:
```

- 

```diff
- vertex_set = frozenset(graph.vertices())
+ vertex_set = frozenset(G.vertex_iterator())
```

- `sub.neighbors(v)` -> `sub.neighbor_iterator(v)`

The patchbot can be quite dumb, so don't always read so much into it. Some quick comments:

```diff
         EXAMPLES::

             sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.modular_decomposition import *
             sage: NodeType.PARALLEL

```
(although the `__str__` is actually not being tested because you explicitly need to call `str(NodeType.PARALLEL`, but the method is unnecessary in this case IIRC; worst-case a simple alias `__str__ = __repr__` can be done).

`TODO:` -> `.. TODO::` (and putting the todo part in an indented block).

Your `INPUT:` items should start with a lowercase letter and not end with a period (unless they are multiple sentences).

I think the example graphs, e.g., from Marc Tedder, should be with the usual `EXAMPLES:` block. Moreover, I don't see why you need two `TESTS:` blocks.

I would add a reference to the Habib and Maurer paper.

In a future ticket, we could create a class `ModularDecomposition` that computes de decomposition and provides access to various format of the result (tree, `LabelledRootedTree`, nested tuples, etc.) and ease access to methods like `md_tree_to_graph`.

Ok, I'll fix the cosmetic bugs later tonight.

I am loath to make a sweeping change to the return type until I figure out all the places that modular decomposition is used.  I agree that the rooted tree is a more sensible return type than the nested tuples, but changing the return type will break things in Poset, and possibly other places.  I would be more than willing to do the work, but I think that it should be in another ticket.

The habib-maurer algorithm should be more reliable, the algorithm is much simpler (albeit theoretically slower) than the other algorithm.  It is also much more heavily tested.

I just checked by printing a warning in `sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.modular_decomposition.modular_decomposition` and `.habib_maurer`, and running all doctests (with `--long`): at least in current develop `modular_decomposition` is only called in `sage.graphs.graph.Graph.is_prime` and `sage.graphs.graph.Graph.modular_decomposition`.

So there shouldn't be any problem, but I agree that it's better to do that in a separate ticket.

The output style issue is #27247.

I also added the `....:` stuff there.

There is something very strange:

both `modular_decomposition` and `habib_maurer` return `NORMAL [0]` for the graph with one vertex, but this is manually changed to `PRIME` in the method.  Why so?  A similar thing is done to the empty graph.

I did

```
    __str__ = __repr__
```
(and please excuse me, I wanted to write 'possibly more correct', because I don't know much about python)

For the ordering problem, I think it's best to specify the algorithm explicitely in the doctests:

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().modular_decomposition(algorithm='tedder')
```
or alternatively

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().modular_decomposition(algorithm='habib')
```
and additionally adapt the result.

I corrected the doctests for Python 2 and Python 3. I'm not happy with the solution (mark doctests as py2 or py3), but I don't have a better one.

For me this patch is good to go. With it, we will get a correct algorithm. Further improvements can be done in other tickets.

Can you double check that everything is ok for you so that I can finalize the review ?
