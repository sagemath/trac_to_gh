sage: Permutations(avoiding=[[1,3,2]])
Standard permutations
```
We simply implement an appropriate class.  Now

```
[1,3,2] in Permutations(avoiding=[1,3,2])
```
works as expected.

This is an ugly `__contains__` check:

```
return x in StandardPermutations_avoiding_generic(len(x), self._a)
```
I would just copy the code since it is 2 lines.

You also need to deprecate `self.a`.

There is a reason to this: The code in `StandardPermutations_avoiding_generic` is currently stupid, and it is quite possible that it could be improved (although I am by no means an expert in permutation patterns).  If I copy the stupid implementation, there will be two places to take care of.

Do you insist?

`self.a` was not documented.  Do you insist?

Yes. If that code improves, then you should migrate to a common base class.

No it is not. `StandardPermutations_all_avoiding` and `StandardPermutations_avoiding_generic` are only relatives in the class hierarchy and have no inheritance relationship.
