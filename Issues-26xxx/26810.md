There is a reason to this: The code in `StandardPermutations_avoiding_generic` is currently stupid, and it is quite possible that it could be improved (although I am by no means an expert in permutation patterns).  If I copy the stupid implementation, there will be two places to take care of.

Do you insist?

> You also need to deprecate `self.a`.


`self.a` was not documented.  Do you insist?

Yes. If that code improves, then you should migrate to a common base class.

No it is not. `StandardPermutations_all_avoiding` and `StandardPermutations_avoiding_generic` are only relatives in the class hierarchy and have no inheritance relationship.
