# Issue 24140: Wrong results when using singular functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24377

Keywords: singular

In sage (version 8.1, but 8.0 has the same issue) I have the following code:
R.<x,y>=PolynomialRing?(QQ,order='neglex')
f=(y2+x3)*(y2+x3+x2*y)
singular.lib("all.lib")
f._singular_().bernstein()

I guess this is equivalent to the following singular code
LIB "all.lib";
ring r=0,(x,y),ds;
poly f=(y2+x3)*(y2+x3+x2y)
bernstein(f)

The results differ: -11/7 is a root in the first case, while -4/7 in the second (and I think there are theoretical results that ensure the second one is correct); moreover in both cases, when using bfct -4/7 is the root (bfct uses another algorithm to compute the Bernstein-Sato polynomial). The Singular computations are done using both an external Singular installation and the Sage one.

In other cases I had communication problems between singular and sage leading to output errors, but in this case it produces (a non evident) mathematical wrong result.

After discussion with upstream, it is related to the dependence on orderings of the rings, so I guess it can be closed.
