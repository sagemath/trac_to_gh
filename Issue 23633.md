I don't really like calling `Matrix_integer_sparse` directly.  I still have to check whether I can get comparable speed by removing the local imports in `MatrixSpace.matrix`.  If so, I would like to know why they are there in the first place.

Using a `late_import` function, I get

```
sage: timeit("[elt.to_matrix() for elt in l]", repeat=1, number=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 3.01 s per loop
```


Could some design expert let me know what I should do now?

1. `late_import`: speedup by a factor 3.7, but all calls to `MatrixSpace` benefit.
2. `Matrix_integer_sparse`: speedup by a factor 4.8
3. both

I am for 1. or 3., but do not know which of the two is really better.

Of course, I am willing to run more tests, but I wouldn't know which are expressive.

I have no idea how to use `lazy_import`.  I just pushed my `late_import` implementation, maybe you can guide me.

I have no idea what you mean here.

This would allow to write `matrix(pi)` instead of `pi.to_matrix()`?

`grep` for `lazy_import`. It's self-explanatory and all over Sage.

This is what is done in the `matrix()` construction function. You just check `hasattr(M, "_matrix_")`. So, for example, permutations would be accepted as input with the change proposed below (which, IMO, is very natural).

I did this before I wrote the `late_import` thing:


```
from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
lazy_import('sage.groups.matrix_gps.group_element', 'is_MatrixGroupElement')
lazy_import('sage.modular.arithgroup.arithgroup_element', 'ArithmeticSubgroupElement')
```


but sage crashed on startup.  But I didn't try long - maybe I made a mistake when compiling or so.

You needed to tell Sage that this needs to be resolved at startup (as the error message indicates). This is primarily a temporary solution until more involved changes with the matrix spaces are done (make `_get_matrix_class` into a ``@`lazy_attribute` `Element` so it behaves more like a proper parent and we can then use `MS.element_class` and use the methods `_matrix_`/`matrix` for constructing `matrix` and possibly coercion), which might need some further discussions.

If my changes are good, then I think we can set a positive review.
