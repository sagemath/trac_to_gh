Regarding my second commit:


```
sage: f = QQ[x](69721504*x^8 + 251777664*x^6 + 329532012*x^4 + 184429548*x^2 + 37344321)
sage: %timeit CDF[x](f).roots()
1000 loops, best of 3: 525 µs per loop
sage: %timeit f.roots(CDF)
1000 loops, best of 3: 465 µs per loop
sage: %timeit QQbar[x](f).roots()
10 loops, best of 3: 24.4 ms per loop
sage: %timeit f.roots(QQbar)
10 loops, best of 3: 20.8 ms per loop
```


So using `f.roots(K)` should be better than `K['x'](f)` in pretty much all cases.
