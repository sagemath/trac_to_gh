In the context of permutation groups, support usually refers to the non fixed points; however, for the symmetric group, the support method is inherited from Coxeter groups and returns which Coxeter generators have been used.

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: s = S((1,2,3,4));
sage: s
(1,2,3,4)
sage: s.support()
{1, 2, 3}
```


This is just our usual name conflicts between mathematical fields ...

Potential resolution:
- Rename the `support` method to `coxeter_support`
- Deprecate `support` for now
- In one year or so, implement a `support` method for permutation groups with its usual meaning there.

I am -1 on calling it `coxeter_support()` as that could potentially break a lot of functionality of `SymmetricGroup` as a Coxeter group. I think we are better considering an alternative name for the support as an action on the set `[n]`. Perhaps `support_of_action` or `action_support`? I am more in favor of the first one because it is more natural to discover and will make the user wonder about the difference.

Not breaking backward compatibility is certainly a plus. `support_of_action` is a reasonable alternative. It's just too bad that we can't accommodate the fact that "support" for permutation groups is much more common terminology than for Coxeter groups.

Ah, I had looked for it, but not found it. For a good reason: it's a method on the parent, not the elements. But this indeed suggests using the same name `non_fixed_points` for the method on the elements.
