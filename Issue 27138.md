# Issue 27138: support is ambiguous for symmetric group elements

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27375

Original creator: nthiery

In the context of permutation groups, support usually refers to the non fixed points; however, for the symmetric group, the support method is inherited from Coxeter groups and returns which Coxeter generators have been used.

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: s = S((1,2,3,4));
sage: s
(1,2,3,4)
sage: s.support()
{1, 2, 3}
```


This is just our usual name conflicts between mathematical fields ...

Potential resolution:
- Rename the `support` method to `coxeter_support`
- Deprecate `support` for now
- In one year or so, implement a `support` method for permutation groups with its usual meaning there.

I am -1 on calling it `coxeter_support()` as that could potentially break a lot of functionality of `SymmetricGroup` as a Coxeter group. I think we are better considering an alternative name for the support as an action on the set `[n]`. Perhaps `support_of_action` or `action_support`? I am more in favor of the first one because it is more natural to discover and will make the user wonder about the difference.

I agree with Travis.

Not breaking backward compatibility is certainly a plus. `support_of_action` is a reasonable alternative. It's just too bad that we can't accommodate the fact that "support" for permutation groups is much more common terminology than for Coxeter groups.

```
src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py:    def non_fixed_points(self):

Ah, I had looked for it, but not found it. For a good reason: it's a method on the parent, not the elements. But this indeed suggests using the same name `non_fixed_points` for the method on the elements.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
