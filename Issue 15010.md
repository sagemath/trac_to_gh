# Issue 15010: Introduce a baseclass for singletons

Issue created by migration from Trac.

CC:  nthiery nbruin novoselt

Since some while, we have `sage.categories.category_singleton.Category_singleton`. A singleton is a class that allows the creation of exactly one instance (of any subclass). The technical implementa
tion of `Category_singleton` is roughly like this: In some static `__classcall__`, test that the given class is a direct subclass of `Category_singleton`; then create a (the) instance of the class;
then set the override the classcall of this class and of the class of the instance (which might be a subclass) by a constant function returning the instance.

I suggest to provide this construction scheme generally, in `sage.misc.fast_methods.SingletonClass`. The idea is: If one write a class inheriting from `SingletonClass` then one does not need to think about caching the unique instance or writing a fast hash or writing fast comparison, since this will all be inherited from `SingletonClass`.

I suggest to use it at least on the rational field, which currently has a custom cache, and its hash method is written in Python.

With the branch that I am going to add, I get

```
sage: %timeit RationalField()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 269 ns per loop
sage: %timeit hash(QQ)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 134 ns per loop
sage: %timeit QQ==ZZ
10000000 loops, best of 3: 144 ns per loop
```


With vanilla sage-5.12.b5, it is a lot slower:

```
sage: %timeit RationalField()
10000 loops, best of 3: 82.4 us per loop
sage: %timeit hash(QQ)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 496 ns per loop
sage: %timeit QQ==ZZ
1000000 loops, best of 3: 878 ns per loop
```

It is not "needs review" yet, but I guess it only needs test coverage for the new class.

I did not run make ptest yet, but I have added tests for the new `SingletonClass` and hence change the ticket into "needs review".

It will be needed to change the expected output of several hash functions in the tests, as the hash of QQ is changed `object.__hash__(QQ)` with my branch.

Oops, and much worse: It seems that I forgot to think about unpickling old pickles of QQ!

I stand corrected: THIS seems to work. But the pickle jar broke.

I have now clue what is going wrong here.

I tested saving a rational number in vanilla sage, and I could read the pickle after rebuilding Sage with my branch. However, it seems that some old pickles in the pickle jar manage to create a version of the integer ring without calling its `__init__`. This could be accomplished by directly calling `__new__`. But is this really done somewhere?

I won't have time to review this ticket, but I am all +1 on progress on this direction. Just one thing: the priority is not as high than #10963, and the two patches are likely to conflict with each other, so I'd recommend basing this one on top of #10963.

Cheers,

Why? My branch touches `sage.misc.fast_methods` and `sage.rings.rational_field` and nothing else. I do not aim (yet!) at changing `Category_singleton`, although it would make sense in the long run (i.e., after #10963.

Ah, ok, perfect! Double +1 on this ticket then. Well, as long as it does not eat up review time from you on #10963 :-)

Comment by SimonKing created at 2013-10-02 15:46:07

Nice finding: One of the hash tests was in fact wrong, because it was a test for the hash of a _different_ class!

I am about to fix this now, by testing against the definition of the respective hash functions. So, I am not testing against the result on 64bit and 32 bit machines, since such tests don't seem meaningful to me.

There are even more tests that test against the hash value of an instance of the wrong class!

Comment by SimonKing created at 2013-10-02 20:16:17

There were several hash tests to fix. In all cases, I stopped comparing against a particular number, because
1. the number depends on the architecture (32- versus 64-bit)
2. the number does not show how the hash function works
3. one should test the result of `hash` against the hash function of the class being tested---otherwise (and this happened in at least three examples) one might test an instance of the wrong class.

The tests should work now.

All but one test worked. The failing test was testing against the order of elements of a set. The obvious solution was to use "sorted" in the example. Hence, with the branch that I updated a minute ago, all tests pass for me.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean: isn't that (calling `__new__` but not `__init__`) how unpickling works in general?

* I am a little bit skeptical about tying the singleton behaviour to comparison by identity if `SingletonClass` is meant to be _the_ way to implement singleton classes. Indeed, this makes it virtually unusable for Elements as long as sage keeps abusing `==` to implement semantic (as opposed to syntaxic) equality. And singleton classes descending from Element have at leat one natural use case, namely well-known constants (infinities, pi...). Could you please comment on this choice?
* I don't like having the same explanations and/or tests repeated in several docstrings. I tried to remove redundancies in c5acb88a and 949b7b2aa. But feel free to revert these commits if you disagree!
* The same goes for 207f6b72, where I applied `SingletonClass` to other parents (initially to check how usable it was in practice, but since it's done...).
* Finally, I made a few minor changes in  d9ca799c. Could you please check that none of the things I "fixed" was intentional?

Perhaps Simon can comment at some point, but here are my thoughts.

I would say this is okay as you can always override `__eq__` as necessary, and python's default is to do equality check by id.

> * I don't like having the same explanations and/or tests repeated in several docstrings. I tried to remove redundancies in c5acb88a and 949b7b2aa. But feel free to revert these commits if you disagree!

I moved the pickling test to the class-level doc in order to make it more visible.

I think they were typos.

I've also made some other misc review changes. However I have a question, should this be in `sage/misc` or in `sage/structure` since it feels more like a structural piece of Sage? Otherwise I'm happy with the current state of things (and found similar speedups).

Well, at some point I should perhaps look at the code/doc again...

At #15820 we had a similar discussion, and Nicolas has convinced me with the following: If the structure being implemented is Sage-specific (examples: elements, parents) then it goes into sage.structure. If the structure being implemented would make sense outside of Sage, then it goes into sage.misc (examples: classcall metaclass, sequences of bounded integers as in #15820).

And I'd say that a singleton baseclass makes sense outside of Sage, hence, should go into sage.misc.

Thanks for reminding me of that (and sorry, I let this ticket slip of my radar); Nicolas told me at one time but I couldn't remember which when where.

I agree.

*ping*

Could someone just review my change `0d78737`? I've given a positive review to everything else.


---

Comment by nthiery created at 2014-11-24 12:41:59

I just had a look at 0d78737, and it looks good to me.

I would have two semi-unrelated suggestions though:

- Maybe rename the class to `Singleton` rather than `SingletonClass`: then the name of the class will describe, as is usual, what its instances are, rather than the class itself.

- For the test that is modified in 0d78737: make the inheritance explicit by creating a subclasss rather than trigerring such an inheritance through a call to _refine_category.

Thanks!

Cheers,
