I've compiled sage in `/local/data/krenn/sage-dev/sage-6.1.1` and then moved it to another directory. I am getting the following when testing sage:

```
File "src/sage/dev/test/config.py", line 43, in sage.dev.test.config.DoctestConfig

```
sage --dev checkout --ticket 15901

You have to touch the `src/sage/dev/[test/]` Python files (or remove their `.pyc` files).

This really deserves its own ticket (and btw. is pretty unrelated to relocating Sage; just imagine having different versions of Sage running at the same time).

IMHO Sage's matplotlib must not put its cache into `$HOME` (if at all, it should be in `$DOT_SAGE/.cache/...`), and it should somehow be versioned (with matplotlib's and/or Sage's version in the folder name).

Well, setting up MPL's config dir based on its version in `sage-env` in turn can indeed break upon relocation... :-)

(as it calls Python before `sage-location` is called, and the Python interpreter may try to load libraries that have moved, as I already mentioned elsewhere).

It turns out that this is because the following command in `sage-env` fails (I removed the `2>/dev/null` at the end:

```
"$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/python" -c 'import pkg_resources; pkg_resources.get_distribution("matplotlib").version'

I'm getting

```
.../local/bin/python: error while loading shared libraries: libpython2.7.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```


So apparently `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` isn't set up properly to that time.

The problem in comment:26 was on 6.2.rc0; with 6.2 on a different system I get

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ImportError: cannot import name MAXREPEAT
```

I guess the `MPLCONFIGDIR`-relevant part of `sage-env` should be moved down to a point where all required setting up has been done.
