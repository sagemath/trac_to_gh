I also took the opportunity to remove the deprecation of `from_zero=True` default from #20555.

```
+            By default, the descents are returned as elements in the
+            index set, i.e., starting at `1`. If you want them to
+            start at `0`, set the keyword ``from_zero`` to ``False``.
```


That should be "... to ``True``".

(twice).
