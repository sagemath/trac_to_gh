patchbot is morally green.

I am not sure if this is the right thing to do, but it seems to work.

There are 3 big things to check here:

1. This is more of an issue. You do not seem to be assigning element classes to parents via `Element`. If you run a `TestSuite` on any of the parent objects, I expect a `_test_category` failure because of this. You probably also need to be much more careful about how you create the elements and need to use `ParentObject.element_class`.
2. Equality for `ClonableList` is stronger than for `CombinatorialObject`. In particular, it also compared by parent equality (identity?), which does also allow for coercion. We just overrode equality for comparisons in tableaux (and most other combinatorial objects using `ClonableList`). <rant>(Even all these years later, I still fail to see the benefits of using this. I don't know of a place in Sage that actually uses the cloneable aspects...)</rant>
3. That `str` of the tableau objects works as expected. I don't think there are any doctests confirming this. Could you please add one?

A minor thing is we can probably do `Permutation(list(self))` -> `Permutation(self)`.

This is something that should be done because of the ring structure that species have. (This statement is true, correct?)
