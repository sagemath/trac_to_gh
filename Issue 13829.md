In Singular/Makefile.in there is specific treatment no to link directly to libm but as a counterpart the other needed libs are hardcoded rather than deduced from the autotools NEED_LIBS variable.
And these hardcoded libs include ncurses rather than termcap (which we provided, is correctly detected by configure and put in NEED_LIBS and used on other oses).

That might be fixed in further Singular releases which switched to automake for the Singular folder.

This might be mitigated by #12725 and in future autotools based upstream version but is worth the inclusion I guess.

Typo in `SPKG.txt`:

```
singular-3.1.5.p4
```

should be

```
singular-3-1-5.p4
```

Updated the spkg and put this back to positive_review as the fix is more than trivial.

Could you please confirm that this new spkg is still needed, given #12725?
