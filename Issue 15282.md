Consider a polynomial with two close roots:

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ); pol = x^7-2*(10^20*x-1)^2
sage: pol.roots(RIF)
[(9.999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999?e-21,
  1),
 (1.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001?e-20,
  1),
 (1.14869835499703500680?e8, 1)]
```

and represent one of these roots as an element of `AA`:

```
sage: a = AA.polynomial_root(pol, RIF((0.9e-20,1.0e-20)))
```

Then the upper bound stored internally is smaller than the actual root:

```
sage: a._descr._interval.upper()
9.99999999999999946e-21
```

and indeed we have:

```
sage: pol(a._descr._interval.lower().exact_rational()).sign()
-1
sage: pol(a._descr._interval.lower().exact_rational()).sign()
-1
sage: sage: a.n(50)
...
ValueError: Refining interval that does not bound unique root!
```
