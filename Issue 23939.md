CC:  @tscrim @mantepse

In order to be able to express solution sets from SymPy's `solveset` a set comprehension constructor as equivalent to SymPy's imageset is needed. As the arguments are symbolic the most natural way to do this would be a formal symbolic function named like `set_of_all` taking a term argument and a list argument containing `element_of(...)` function expressions.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24176

The fix to `RealSet.__bool__` in 6995d1e/2a9c49a can go to #31941 (Make empty `RealSet` false).

Unclear to me whether 6995d1e (make `RealSet` inherit from `Set_generic`) should be done

I think the approach on the current branch may be tied a bit too closely to `SR` functions.

I think it's better to first implement:

- `ImageSubset` (as an abstract subobject of the codomain) for arbitrary `Map`s -- this would be a generalization of `ImageManifoldSubset` (#31653). No relation to `SR` (but by relaxing the code from #24171 that only allows some sets to be coerced to `SR`, one would be able to coerce it to `SR`).

- `ConditionSet` (as an abstract subobject of a parent in the `Sets` category) - defined via the element constructor of the parent and an `SR` expression with truth value.

`@`mkoeppe: since you put me into the CC list, would this include symbolic roots of polynomials, given by the minimal polynomial?

I am guessing (because I'm not an expert there) that these would really need a special treatment, because one can compute with them quite well.
