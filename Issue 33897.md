Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34134

Original creator: @DaveWitteMorris

Original creation time: 2022-07-09 01:46:35

Keywords: typo, r, interface, beginner

Lines 347-348 of `src/sage/interfaces/r.py` are

```
    The conversion can handle "not a number", infintiy, imaginary values and
    missing values:
```

Unfortunately, your branch cannot be merged into the current develop branch. (Note that the branch name is red on the ticket web page.) So you should rebase your changes on the current develop branch.

If you do not know how to rebase, another option would be to update to the current develop branch and redo your edit there. (Do `git checkout develop` and `git pull` to get the latest version. Make a new branch with `git checkout -b <new branch name>`, edit this version of `src/sage/interfaces/r.py`, commit the change, and push this branch to trac.)

Also, please put your (real world) full name in the `Authors` field of the ticket.

I pulled the latest version of develop 9.7.beta7 and made the commits from there.

It seems clear that the patchbot errors are not related to this ticket (and I confirmed by running `make testlong` successfully).
