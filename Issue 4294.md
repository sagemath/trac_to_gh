# Issue 4294: sage -t under %pdb

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/4294

Original creator: nthiery

Original creation time: 2008-10-15 11:45:49

Assignee: mabshoff

The title says all: I'd like to run sage -t on a file with %pdb on, so that on the first encountered error it would pop up a debugger to poke around what's the context of the error.

Thanks in advance!

This will work once #12415 is finished (it works now on my machine).
