You most likely just need to add `$LDFLAGS` to the command line.

You mean during the compilation of the library, the compilation of each instance or at running it?

I mean in the command line that you changed in your patch.

You can just test it using `ldd /path/to/binary`

You should **always** add `$LDFLAGS` when creating a binary. That includes shared libraries.

Static libraries (libtides.a) aren't executable so you don't need `$LDFLAGS`.
