# Issue 33354: Colormaps also possible with threejs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33591

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2022-03-29 16:00:53

In the documentation for [implicit 3d plots](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/implicit_plot3d.html) we see some pretty cool colormap examples.  However, there is a warning:

```
Warning This kind of coloring using a colormap can be visualized using Jmol, Tachyon (option viewer='tachyon') and Canvas3D (option viewer='canvas3d' in the notebook).
```

As far as I can tell, this also works with the default threejs as well, so this should be updated.

Thanks, that seems pretty reasonable.  Do you think there are any (current) viewer options which _cannot_ view these kinds of plots?  The only one I can think of even testing is jsmol (as opposed to jmol) but maybe there are some others we should verify on first.

I have no idea. If you manage to test jsmol, please report.

Thanks.    I haven't been able to even test jmol yet but will try to remember to do so soon.  Otherwise this is obviously ready to go.

colors works fine with jmol

That seems to cover [all the options for viewer](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/base.html#sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3d.show) so I guess we are good to go.  Needs rebasing, apparently, but otherwise positive review.
