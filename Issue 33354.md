In the documentation for [implicit 3d plots](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/implicit_plot3d.html) we see some pretty cool colormap examples.  However, there is a warning:

```
Warning This kind of coloring using a colormap can be visualized using Jmol, Tachyon (option viewer='tachyon') and Canvas3D (option viewer='canvas3d' in the notebook).
```

As far as I can tell, this also works with the default threejs as well, so this should be updated.

Thanks, that seems pretty reasonable.  Do you think there are any (current) viewer options which *cannot* view these kinds of plots?  The only one I can think of even testing is jsmol (as opposed to jmol) but maybe there are some others we should verify on first.
