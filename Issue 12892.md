Keywords: documentation

The documentation here http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/search.html should be able to search methods (those not starting with `_`) in the classes. For instance, the following search http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/search.html?q=integer_representation gives zero results even though `integer_representation` is a valid method for an element of `GF(2^p)`.

```
sage: F = GF(2**3, 'a')
sage: b = F.random_element(); b
a^2 + a
sage: b.integer_representation()
6
```

I don't think the problem is that it cannot search in methods. For instance, if you try

```
frobenius
```
you'll see plenty of methods show up. Are you positive that `integer_representation` is documented in the "sage reference"? If you look in the index under "I", you'll see many methods indexed, but not that one. So I guess that `sage.rings.finite_rings.element_givaro.FiniteField_givaroElement` is simply not included there.

My guess was that maybe it only searches and indexes methods which are present in global scope. I will have to look more carefully to see why it is missing some of the methods.

The problem (in this particular case) is that the documentation for these finite fields are not included/built because there's no references in a `.rst` file. Would anyone mind if I reuse this ticket to update the appropriate `.rst` file?

Almost certainly. Something like: "In sage, you can use `search_src` [with a link to its doc] to find functions in **all** of the source code, including private functions (those that begin with a leading underscore '`_`')." Possibly also adding: "If there is a module not linked in this documentation, it is a bug that needs to be reported."

Also `search_def` according to its documentation is the same as `search_src`.

Actually they are different functions. Their input and output formats are similar. The `search_def` searches only function names while the `search_src` searches through the whole source code, matching any line with the search string.

Those `search_*` functions are only available when you're running Sage, while the documentation search page just needs the build documentation — no need for Sage to be running. So that's one reason why they're not integrated, and probably why they shouldn't be.

I'm imagining text like "You can also run `search_src(...)` from while running Sage to search the source code. You can also browse the source code by running `hg_sage.serve()` from Sage."

Re `search_def('blah')`: it is like `search_src('blah')`, but it restricts its search to lines of the form `def blah` or `cdef blah`, so it sees both functions and methods which contain 'blah' in their name.
