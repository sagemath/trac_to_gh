after importing the patch in Sage 5.12, I get with `sage -br`:

Did you apply the dependency #9640?

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

the example in the description no longer gives a Seg. fault, all doctests still pass,
I'm not an expert of the Python-C interface but nevertheless the patch looks fine to me,
thus I give a positive review.
