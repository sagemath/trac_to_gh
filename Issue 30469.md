While working on #30371, I noticed that cblas is not available for Ubuntu 18.04. In fact, `libblas-dev` contains a `README.if-you-look-for-libcblas` with the following content:


```
    Debian science team maintainers have merged the CBLAS ABI into
    the libblas.so shared object. Everything you need from libcblas.so
    can be found in libblas.so . Please link your program against it
    instead. See also

      https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience/LinearAlgebraLibraries
```


So I suggest to migrate/rename cblas to blas. The currently submitted changes worked for an editable install, but they might lead to issues with the build process. So advice how to properly do this migration is  welcome; in fact, feel free to hijack this ticket and push the necessary changes directly.

> Well, the editable install in #30371 uses only system-wide installed libraries, so things in `SAGE_LOCAL` don't matter

As I said in #30371, I think it's best to keep the focus narrow -- make #30371 work completely (i.e., pass doctests) when run from within `./sage -sh` so that `$SAGE_LOCAL` is set to a working installation of the Sage distribution.  

Of course I do understand that currently technical problems prevent you from completing the build.

Still, `make -k` can build everything until you get the error with the pip package or whatever is failing. Then for example the .pc files will be available.

> Would it work to take in `env.py` the first of the libraries `openblas cblas blas` that is found using `pkgconfig.parse`?

Something like this might work.

Making `sage.env.cython_aliases` more flexible is a good approach, I would think.

Note that this will need thorough testing across the supported platforms.

This is going in a good direction but it might conflict with the Sage distribution's support of selecting ATLAS instead of OpenBLAS in `configure`. We can't just go and prefer the openblas.pc without adding a configuration variable that preserves this option.

Its interesting to note that also `./configure` cannot find openblas:
`checking for openblas >= 0.2.20... no`. So I guess it's a more general issue not really related to this ticket.

I just discovered that there is also a reference to `cblas` in `src/sage/misc/cython.py`. Not sure if this also needs to be changed to use the new variable `CBLAS_PC_MODULES`.

Moreover, I would like suggest the following change to `sage_conf.py.in` to make this more reusable.

```
DEFAULT_CBLAS_PC_MODULE = "@SAGE_CBLAS_PC_MODULE" # Set to cblas in configure

def get_cblas_pc_module()
   cblas_pc_modules = [DEFAULT_CBLAS_PC_MODULE, 'cblas', 'openblas', 'blas']
   return next((blas_lib for blas_lib in cblas_pc_modules if pkgconfig.exists(blas_lib)))
