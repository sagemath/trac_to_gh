I made some proof reading, based on the html version that Minh posted at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/8698-tour-de/

* `Die Invertierung der Matrix 2 \times 2 in Sage:` should be replaced by `Die Invertierung einer (2 \times 2)-Matrix in Sage:`.

* `Damit ermittelt Sage eine quadratische Gleichung.` It was not immediately clear to me what "Damit" refers to. Moreover, the equation is not "determined" but "solved". So, perhaps better *Im nächsten Beispiel löst Sage eine quadratische Gleichung.*

* `Sage benötigt weniger als 5 Sekunden um die Anzahl der möglichen Varianten zur Partitionierung von... zu berechnen`: There is a comma missing; I don't think that one would talk about "number of possible **variants** of partitions"; Sage is not only computing the number of partitions, but actually finds the partitions (which is stronger); and I think "partition" is "Partition" in German.

Thanks, Simon... ;-)

I think what's at all meant by "Notebook" has to be explained, too. A typical German reader would first think of his laptop, not a user interface (which is funny if not annoying in the translation of the user guide when talking about `ssh_keygen`...).

It would be nice if you could supply a patch on top of Minh's.

Good idea (and perhaps it would make sense to have this in English, too).

> It would be nice if you could supply a patch on top of Minh's.

Done. 

My patch adds a section on the notebook (I hope I didn't write too much nonsense, because I hardly ever use the notebook) and the two png-plots that were missing.

Minh: Is it OK to first finish this ticket off before focusing on #8660? Or should the two tickets be united at an earlier stage?

Best regards, Simon

Helas.

I just found one typo. I wrote:
"Die Anzahl der Möglichkeiten ist gigantisch, wir geben hier nur die letzten 40 Ziffern an."

Should be "Die Anzahl der Möglichkeiten ist gigantisch, wir geben hier nur die ersten 40 Ziffern an."

But I think this should be fixed once there are more comments of another reviewer.

The Sage tour is much shorter than the installation guide. So I think the tour would be the first to get into the Sage standard documentation. Thank you for reviewing the tour.
