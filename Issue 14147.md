You replace 

```
(j<jmax)
```

by

```
(j<jmax and jmax>0)
```

but as `jmax` is already larger than `j` (which is an unsigned integer) then `jmax` is nonzero. And the same goes for the second test you add. If it makes a difference I don't see how `O_o`

Ahahaha. If you say that it happens... Looks weird, but it's correct indeed ;-)
