# Issue 30981: Run sage-venv-config in currently active python

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31218

Original creator: @tobiasdiez

Original creation time: 2021-01-10 15:38:00

CC:  mkoeppe

Running `./bootstrap` resulted in several warnings of the form
> /mnt/d/Programming/sage/src/bin/sage: /mnt/d/Programming/sage/src/bin/sage-venv-config: /doesnotexist/python3: bad interpreter: No such file or directory

This is fixed by using the currently active python instead.

This is not the right fix. Executing the non-installed copy of `sage-venv-config` is supposed to fail. 

I'll push a new branch
