# Issue 19602: log of complex ball via symbolic ring getting becoming ordinary real number

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19839

```
sage: CBF = ComplexBallField()
sage: log(SR(CBF(0.42))).pyobject().parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

which should not happen. (IMHO some conversion is going on; probably related the missing `.log()` of a complex ball).

Does the problem still occur once #19082 is merged?
