Euh, yes indeed.
This looks different as my problem was with template instantiation.
Here there is an undefined reference.
What tricked me earlier is that the problematic function is the same.

For the record, here is my report to Victor Shoup:
I've been playing for a few moments with NTL 6.2.0 and it looks really nice.
Nonetheless I don't seem able to build singular 3-6-0 on top of it.

Indeed g++ spits:

```
../../../../../../../../include/NTL/vector.h:427:4: error: no matching
function for call to 'NTL::Vec<NTL::Pair<NTL::GF2X, long int>
>::Init(long int&, const NTL::Pair<NTL::GF2X, long int>&, const
NTL::Pair<NTL::GF2X, long int>&)'
../../../../../../../../include/NTL/vector.h:427:4: note: candidates are:

../../../../../../../../include/NTL/vector.h:389:6: note: void

long int>]
../../../../../../../../include/NTL/vector.h:400:6: note:   candidate
expects 2 arguments, 3 provided
```


And looking at the new vector.h from NTL, on line 427, there is indeed
a call to:
Init(n, a, *src);
within the DoSetLength definition.

And no corresponding function in vector.h (whereas there are indeed
three definitions for Init with different signatures.)

Am I missing something here?

Best regards,

Not sure you are missing something. C++ always look like spaghetti to me (in a different way from classic FORTRAN - FORTRAN was abstract spaghetti, C++ is litteral as far as I am concerned). I could be that "DoSetLength" is actually defined in another header and it is not properly included before vector.h or in vector.h itself.

```

Jeroen's failure was on three symbols:

```
NTL::Vec<NTL::ZZ>::DoSetLength(long)
NTL::Vec<NTL::zz_pEX>::DoSetLength(long)
NTL::Vec<NTL::zz_pX>::DoSetLength(long)
```

And they are all present. So two possibilities I see:
* Jeroen's build of ntl was incomplete
* there is an ordering problem in the singular's linking

Jeroen can easily check the first one. The second would involve a little bit more experimentation and cut and paste.

I will try to reproduce this locally.

By the look of it you posted the logs a few seconds before me. Just as an aside I just noticed that libntl.so is currently linked with gcc rather than g++. Not fatal but it leaves a lot of libstdc++ symbols undefined. I'll see if I can come up with something for that tomorrow.

Yup, I've been using it on different systems (one redhat ppc64 and a ubuntu x86_64) for a while now...
In fact the release of 6.2.1 over 6.2.0 was made because I tried to use 6.2.0 and it failed and I contacted Shoup who was very reactive...

With vanilla `g++-4.6.4`, same problem as with Gentoo's `g++-4.6.4`

I think that GCC 4.6.4 is too recent to not support it, so the `DoSetLength` problem should be fixed...

I am guessing the latest release of ntl relies on templating features from recent g++, probably 4.7.x. Basically we would almost require someone with gcc<4.7 to use something that is like ntl 6.1. I'll have a look at the diff between 6.1 and 6.2.1.

I'm not entirely against requiring `g++-4.7` (we do have the GCC spkg after all), but is upstream aware of this? Anyway, if an easy fix is possible for this issue, that would be the best.

OK the configure script we currently ship is insufficient to generate a libtool that can link with g++. I am going to clean the spkg a bit later (yes I'll rebase the patches) but basically I will put this as the new configure.ac

```
AC_INIT(NTL, 6.2.1, victor@shoup.net)
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([1.9 foreign])
AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])
LT_INIT
AC_PROG_CXX
AC_PROG_CC
AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
AC_OUTPUT
```

Looking for the C compiler is possibly over the top but it doesn't hurt. I grossly tested things and with that I now have a clean linking with g++.

Here is the feedboack from Victor:

```
This new issue seems to be related to template instantiation and linking,
which admittedly is a potentially murky area.  I don't think there is
an NTL bug…but it's hard to say.  I haven't tested NTL recently
as a dynamic library -- I almost always use static libraries, just because
it is simpler.  I could imagine that there is some subtle interaction between
template instantiation and dynamic library loading…since it seems
the problem goes away in some versions of gcc, it could be a gcc problem.
If you can send me a simple test that illustrates the problem that would be useful.
If there is anything in the code or the NTL build scrips that would help with this,
I'd be glad to help.

To clarify one point: NTL makes no use of any features not present in the C++98.
standard, and it is only within the last couple of years that I have much 
confidence that C++98 is widely and correctly implemented.
```

and just now:

```
I looked for closely at the ticket.
I see that the code is compiled with the -fno-implicit-templates
flag.  I'm not sure, but that could be a source of the problem...
```

That's singular that is using -fno-implicit-templates. It would be interesting to check if libntl.a is usable. I found the argument about .a compared to .so a bit specious. Symbols can be checked in .a library with "nm" there is just no option to get the non hashed names in the output. But it looks like piping through c++filt works

Not on my side.
I just came back to work this week and had a bunch of other stuff to do, some of them were even Sage related.

I'm sorry, a lot has been said here, but the ticket is getting hairy and I would like that we properly define what the problem is and how to detect it (other than, try to build Singular on top and NTL and see if it fails).
What's not completely clear to me is what the problem actually is when using GCC 4.6.3 (and potentially prior versions:
* is a symbol not getting defined in NTL with some GCC version and templating magic? as Singular needs that symbol it fails to build, and we can just detect the problematic GCC versions by using nm/objdump on the produced NTL .so/.a files.
* is this a problem with template instantiation magic when Singular gets built, so nothing is actually missing from the NTL .so file, but there is some issue with let's say the header of NTL or the way Singular uses them, or the flags it passes to the compiler/linker? (that does not make a lot of sense, but as the situation is not clear to me, I'm just putting here all that goes through my head).

So in the first hypothesis which looks the more reasonable to me, what is the missing symbol?
Can we produce a three lines C file which would fail to link against NTL as Singular does?

I might personally be able to test GCC series between 4.6 and 4.9 on Linux x86_64, maybe ppc64, vanilla FSF and Debian versions.
Not sure I'll have the time to twiddle with pre 4.5 versions.
What about clang? :)

A little more info:
* with Debian's GCC 4.4 and 4.6, only a few symbols get defined;
* with Debian's GCC 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9, a lof of symbols get defined;
* with FSF's GCC 4.3, only a few symbols get defined;
* with FSF's GCC 4.2 and 4.5, a lot of symbols get defined.
So it's kind of unfortunate that GCC behavior varies in that way.

Whatsoever, removing the `-fno-implicit-templates` flag from Singular 3-1-6 build system, let it link to a libntl.so without all the explicit `DoSetLength` symbols.

So I guess the proper fix would be to explicitly list the needed templates in Singular sources (the NTL6 compatibility patch does already this kind of stuff), I'm now trying this solution.
Or we could just get rid of the `-fno-implicit-templates` flag from Singular 3-1-6 build system.
Or do you think, we should make sure NTL always define the whole bunch of symbols.

Not sure how singular-4.x behaves.
