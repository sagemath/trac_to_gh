I tried to make it clear that `self` must be positive definite and showed some examples where things can go awry if that is not the case.

I tempted to mention LLLGram in magma that seems to address this issues, and might a nice alternative through {magma_free}


```
map(eval, magma_free("G, U, r := LLLGram(Matrix(2,2,[0,1,1,0])); print ElementToSequence(G); print ElementToSequence(U); print r;").splitlines())
```

Looks good.  Just a few changes.

I think


```
sage: Matrix(ZZ, [-5, -1, -1, -5]).LLL_gram() # not tested
```


should be


```
sage: Matrix(ZZ, 2, 2, [-5, -1, -1, -5]).LLL_gram() # not tested
```


If you change that and remove all trailing whitespace, I'll give you a positive review.
