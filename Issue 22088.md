# Issue 22088: Replace all pexpect-maxima calls in function/orthogonal-polys

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22325

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-02-08 07:31:13

Now that all functionality of specific orthogonal polys is handled by other than pexpect calls (?, see #17753) let's replace the unneeded calls completely.

I am not sure about this change:

as it seems like you are removing functionality to the user. Specifically, you either need to deprecate the `algorithm='maxima'` input or (IMO better) send it off to Maxima.

Right, I intended delegating but did the wrong thing.

Actually that never worked. Let's open a ticket for it.

Thanks. I agree; we can handle the algorithm issues on a followup.
