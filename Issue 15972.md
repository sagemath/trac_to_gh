Keywords: exchange graph

This function takes a seed for a cluster algebra of finite type with principal coefficients and returns an orientation of its exchange graph that has the structure of a poset. It returns this orientation of the exchange graph as a poset object and as a quiver object.

Changing keywords from "exchange graph" to "cluster, exchange graph".

I have made a working and documented branch from the given file. I am not convinced at all that this is the proper way to do it. Computing first the mutation class and then doing it again looks bad enough.

Thanks Frederic.

Alexander's goal was to have a working version first.  Then we would streamline it together.  Your suggestion to make sure we don't compute the mutation class twice is an apt one.  We will be updating this in the next few weeks (busy with other projects at the moment).

Here is a better (?) version, that does not pre-compute the mutation class.

Some tests seem to fail in sage-6.9. An exception is raised with the very first example:

TypeError: <class 'sage.combinat.cluster_algebra_quiver.cluster_seed.ClusterSeed'> is not hashable

All test passed now on sage-6.9.

Looks ok to me. I removed many blank spaces.
