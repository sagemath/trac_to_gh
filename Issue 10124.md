Unfortunately, the plists were in binary format, so I took the liberty of changing them to xml format and updating the project file so that they (hopefully) won't be converted back.

How do I review this?  What I mean is that I already have the Mac app, so somewhere there is a plist or something that encodes whatever the last setting I had for server starting was.  I don't remember where it is, but I assume if I remove it then it will go back to the default.

So just let me know where that is, and I will remove it and then restart the Sage app, giving (hopefully) positive review!

(On the plus side, opening the plist in the Property List Editor (after applying the patch) did indeed have the correct default, so I could almost give positive review based on that alone.  But not quite.)

Is it `~/org.sagemath.Sage.plist`? I note that currently (before this patch) that file doesn't actually even have a preference for whether the server starts by default...

It's actually ~/Library/Preferences/org.sagemath.Sage.plist and it doesn't save a value there unless you have changed it from the default I believe.  Anyway, you should be able to delete that file and it will give all the defaults again.

Sorry for the imprecision; that's the file I meant.  Well, when I tested this before I changed it from the default a lot :) so I'll definitely want to delete it before I test this.

Okay, all is well.  I understand how the plists update themselves too better now - interesting.  Changing the preference changes the plist, and back works as well.  Positive review.
