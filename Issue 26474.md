# Issue 26474: avoid .vertices() in graph_coloring.py

Issue created by migration from Trac.

After #26484, one call to `.vertices()` was remaining in method `edge_coloring`. As it is used for the relabeling of a clique, we can safely replace it with `list(h)`.

In this ticket, we also do another round of PEP8 cleaning and improvements of math formula for the html doc.

I thought I was in a new branch, but my changes were in `develop`... I need another coffee... Should be OK now.

```
+        sage: sorted(d.keys())
```

could be just

```
+        sage: sorted(d)
```

Otherwise, positive review.
