CC:  tmonteil

In recent years the size of our docker images has increased substantially:

8.4: 579MB
...
9.0: 705MB
...
9.3: 891MB
9.4: 976MB
9.5: 1.45GB

The biggest jump happened with the 9.5 release. The Dockerfile has not really changed in the meantime but something else seems to make that image much bigger than it used to be.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33409

Does the Docker script do `make micro_release`?  That tries to strip the binaries of debugging symbols, but with the new `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/venv-python*` directory it misses many of the relevant libraries. For my own Docker image https://github.com/3-manifolds/sagedocker I had to add:

```
find $SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/venv-python* -type f -exec strip '{}' ';' 2>&1

to keep the size of the image from increasing dramatically from 9.4 to 9.5.

The 9.5 version available on docker is unusable because it it too big and takes too much time to build (it bust the 60 minutes time limit on the gitlab CI runners, see https://gitlab.com/seblabbe/slabbe/-/pipelines)

It would be nice to see if the change propose here allows to reduce the size and usability of the 9.6 image.

The ticket will not be merged until it is reviewed. What you can do is:
- build Sage 
- run `du -sh SAGE_ROOT/local/`

- run `make micro_release`
- run `du -sh SAGE_ROOT/local/`

- apply this ticket
- run `make micro_release`
- run `du -sh SAGE_ROOT/local/`

and see if each iteration saves some space from the previous one.

Ok, I reinstalled and recompiled this version of sage:

$ sage -v

The space taken by local is:

```
$ du -sh local

After installing this ticket, I get:

To summarize,

**9.7.beta3 without this ticket**:


```
$ sage -v
SageMath version 9.7.beta3, Release Date: 2022-06-19
$ du -sh local/
5,8G	local/
$ make micro_release
$ du -sh local/
3,2G	local/
$ du -sh local/var/lib/sage/*
2,2M	local/var/lib/sage/installed
12K	local/var/lib/sage/scripts
2,0G	local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10.3
```


**9.7.beta3 + #33409**:


```
$ sage -v
SageMath version 9.7.beta3, Release Date: 2022-06-19
$ du -sh local
5,8G	local
$ make micro_release
$ du -sh local
2,4G	local
$ du -sh local/var/lib/sage/*
2,2M	local/var/lib/sage/installed
12K	local/var/lib/sage/scripts
1,2G	local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10.3
```


Therefore a gain of 800M was done in the size of `local/var/lib/sage/venv-python3.10.3` with the current branch.
