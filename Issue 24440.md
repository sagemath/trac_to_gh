CC:  vklein

In many functions, integer type checking is done via `isinstance(x, integer_types)` where `integer_types` is sometimes `int` or obtained from the `six` library. This approach is ignoring custom integer types implemented in external libraries such as gmpy2. One solution would be to use `numbers.Integral` instead.

The example of the `factor` function in `sage.arith.misc`

```
sage: import gmpy2
sage: factor(gmpy2.mpz(4))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to factor n
```

How would you do for `factor`?

There are trailing whitespaces that needs to be removed.

In doctests, a comment line must be followed by a linebreak. The following

```
TESTS with numpy and gmpy2 numbers::
    sage: from numpy import int8
```

shoud be changed to

```
Tests with numpy and gmpy2 numbers::

    sage: from numpy import int8
```


There is no need to write `TESTS` in upper case unless it corresponds to the section in the docstring.

You should get rid of `integer_types` in the whole file. This kind of conversion

```
    if isinstance(n, integer_types):
        n = ZZ(n)
```

is better and faster with

```
    n = py_scalar_to_element()
```

(Moreover the former is not working for gmpy2 elements)

The remaining functions works for other reasons. 
\\
For example `is_square` call gmpy2 native `is_square` function. 
But it's true that this solution may be incompatible with another future number type.

The sentence is confusing

```
    Tests with gmpy2 and numpy numbers::

        sage: from numpy import int8
        sage: dedekind_sum(int8(5), int8(7), algorithm='default')
        -1/14
        sage: from gmpy2 import mpz                             # optional - gmpy2
        sage: dedekind_sum(mpz(5), mpz(7), algorithm='default') # optional - gmpy2
        -1/14
```

You say `gmpy2 and numpy` but you test numpy first...
