```
    sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group import GrowthGroup
    sage: A = GrowthGroup('QQ^x * x^ZZ'); A
    sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
    sage: E = GrowthGroup('ZZ^x * x^QQ')
    sage: cm.record_exceptions()
    sage: cm.common_parent(A, E)
    Growth Group QQ^x * x^QQ
    sage: for t in cm.exception_stack():
    ....:     print t
```

brings up

```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    CoercionException: Infinite loop in action of Growth Group QQ^x * x^QQ (parent <class 'sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group_cartesian.UnivariateProduct_with_category'>) and Growth Group ZZ^x * x^QQ (parent <class 'sage.rings.asymptotic.growth_group_cartesian.UnivariateProduct_with_category'>)!
```

It is caught, so it does not make a problem at all, but IMHO shouldn't be there.
