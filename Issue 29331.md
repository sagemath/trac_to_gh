Keywords: inexact polyhedra, precomputed data

Setting up polyhedra with the shortest representation is not always the best choice for inexact polyhedra. Concretely, #29324 introduced a regression:


```
sage: P = polytopes.buckyball(exact=False) 
sage: P+P.center()
/srv/public/kliem/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/geometry/polyhedron/backend_cdd.py:142: UserWarning: This polyhedron data is numerically complicated; cdd could not convert between the inexact V and H representation without loss of data. The resulting object might show inconsistencies.
  warn("This polyhedron data is numerically complicated; cdd could not convert between the inexact V and H representation without loss of data. The resulting object might show inconsistencies.")
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^3 defined as the convex hull of 60 vertices
```


On the other hand `2*P` always threw this warning (also before #29200).

We should use that we are given both Vrepresentation and Hrepresentation in cdd to make things work.
