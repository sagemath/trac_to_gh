Two aims:

* clean the code of tamari_lattices.py (into pep8 standard)

* add TamariLattice as an example so that one can type `posets.TamariLattice(4)`

Looks good. 

The module documentation begins by telling the user how to import `TamariLattice`, however, which is not needed anymore with your new alias. Could you update that too ?

Thanks,

Nathann

`O_o`

Is there any reason why we should have import only `TamariLattices` in `posets.*` and not the generalized ones ?

Thanks Nathann.

I have chosen not to expose the `GeneralizedTamariLattice` in the catalogue of posets, as they are *not classical at all*. So far, only very well known things appear in the catalogue. I think nobody knows about the `GeneralizedTamariLattice` so far, or maybe call some other posets by this name..

Yo !

Okay, makes total sense. I'll make a final pass and change this ticket's status.

Hello !

I added a small commit on top of yours (by the way it looks that you are not using 6.6.beta0 despite what you merge commit claims). It is at public/17761.

If this is fine for you, you can change this ticket's branch and set the ticket to `positive_review`.

Thanks for this patch,

Nathann
