On #17129 I was told that strings for `ValueError` should be incomplete sentences.

After #17053 it seems logical to have `pairs` as a default value, not `integers`.

If I am not mistaken, ordinal product of lattices is a lattice; compare to for example #17142.

I have been told that all input should be documented, i.e. also `other`.

Hello !

Well, first for the poset thing you can be MUCH more efficient. In `Poset.ordinal_sum` you add only edges between the top elements of one and the bottom elements of the other. Why don't you do that here too ?

(please, cache the top/bottom elements of each poset).

Also, `for s in self for s2 in self.lower_covers(s)` should probably be `for s,s in cover_relations_iterator`.

For the graph code, it could be improved by replacing the calls to `add_edge` by one call to `add_edges`. The difference is that `add_edge` supports many kind of inputs (a pair, or two points, or three points) and that `add_edge` checks it at every call (while `add_edges` does it once).

Hello !

Well, this patch looks good to me, and all tests pass. Jory: I tested the product of two `BooleanLattice(5)` and it takes 2.5 seconds. It is still a lot, but better than 17s `:-/`

```
sage: %timeit p.ordinal_product(p)
1 loops, best of 3: 2.46 s per loop
```

I do not understand much what the profiling says, though. It seems that 1.3s is used by the 'has_edge' function (Why ???? `O_o`)

The code of `transitive_reduction` can be rewritten more efficiently, though. Actually, this is a very important point since this function is called every time a poset is created, to build its hasse diagram.

Sorry guys, but I have to give up for tonight. 1am, and I will need my brain tomorrow again. Good night, and thanks for the patch !

Right right, all the commits are his !

By the way, Jakob Kröker just sent me an email about Posets and I told him that you had a half-plan of adding some doc there.

God, I should be sleeping `T_T`
