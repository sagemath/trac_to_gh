I modified the patch:

- use the .tar.gz file from github with version number instead of unversioned .zip file
- use Sage's versions of flint, mpfr, gmp in building the package (if there is no version of one of those in the system paths, then the optional package won't compile).
- Set package version to 2.2.0 to match the name of the top level directory of the .tar.gz file so that no renaming to src is necessary.

In that version, it compiles for me.

Are you planning to provide and include python bindings for the library?

In the [developer guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html#manual-package-build-and-installation), it says "If all went fine, open a ticket, put a link to the original tarball in the ticket and upload a branch with the code under `SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs`." So IMHO, there is nothing else to do.

For the sage spkg, it would probably be easier to have a release on github with that change.

`@`original authors: is there a reason why the status of this patch is not "needs_review"? I'd also like to renew my question on whether you plan to provide python bindings.
