As the summary says. Currently, the file `doc/en/reference/conf.py` explicitly lists all of the subdirectories which contain components of the reference manual. If anyone adds a new component, they have to edit this file, and if they forget, they can get opaque error messages. So instead, the list should be generated on the fly.

To you...

If the folders are sorted (or more precisely, get processed in alphabetical order), you at least get an idea of the progress.

W.r.t. performance:  It certainly doesn't matter *here* (at least currently ;-) ), that's why I wrote *stylewise*.  People<sup>*</sup> tend to get used to such, adding overhead here and there, and at some point it *does* matter.

(<sup>*</sup> which includes people *reading* such code, not necessarily their author(s))

Step out for a few hours and you miss a lot.  ;-)

I just used this to build the reference manual on 5.10.beta5 by nuking `doc/output` and doing


```
sage -docbuild reference inventory
sage -docbuild reference html
```


and it seemed to work just fine.  At least the matroid documentation rendered fine.  So I'm all for a positive review based on my testing.  I'll stay out of the sorted discussion.
