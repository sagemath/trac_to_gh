Assignee: tbd

Keywords: FreeBSD fflas_ffpack bash

While trying to compile sage-5.4beta1 on FreeBSD, it failed because of using "#!/bin/bash".  As I understand it, it should be "#!/usr/bin/env bash".

It is in fflas_ffpack-1.6.0//src/fflas-ffpack-config.in

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13463
