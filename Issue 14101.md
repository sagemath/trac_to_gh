CC:  mjo burcin rws

in Sage 5.7 we get:

```
sage: (x^2).simplify_radical()           
x^2
```

This is wrong (consider x=-1 for example). Even:

```
sage: assume(x<0)
sage: sqrt(x^2).simplify_radical()
x
```


Note: this invalidates a whole part of our book (in french) about Sage at
http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/

This is the problem.

Karl-Dieter, I guess you mean #14308 instead of #14307?

Yes of course, in fact some chapters are already included, see `tests/french_book`.

Other chapters are waiting for work or reviewers: #10983, #11745. Feel free to help!

Jeroen asked a similar question a few months ago:

https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-support/jhCJujRtNA4/discussion

Maxima should notice that `x` is real (if you make the assumption), but it doesn't. The simplification of `sqrt(x^2)` to `abs(x)` relies on the "simplification domain" in Maxima being set to `real` -- in fact, if I remember correctly, that's the only thing the simplification domain does affect. To get the answer from sage <5.6, you'd need,


```
sage: maxima_lib.eval('domain: real;')
'real'
sage: sqrt(x^2).simplify()            
abs(x)
```


It sucks that you have to do that, and we should really add either a global method or a property of `maxima_lib` that lets you change it. That's one solution.

A better approach would be to notice when an expression contains only real variables, and to set the simplification domain appropriately. This could be done in either Maxima or Sage (pynac/ginac), but probably belongs in both. Symbols in sage have an associated domain, too:


```
sage: x = SR.symbol('x', domain='real')
sage: sqrt(x^2)
sqrt(x^2)
```


This never passes through Maxima, so arguably, Sage should simplify it if we can convince Maxima to do the same thing. But it's not at all easy to determine whether an expression is real; otherwise, I would have written it a long time ago! I mainly work over the reals myself and would love to have a solution that doesn't involve manually fooling with Maxima.

before #12780, the default domain was 'real', and `sqrt(x^2).simplify_radical()` was correctly simplified to `abs(x)`.

After #12780, the default domain is that of Maxima (which is 'complex' in Sage 5.9), and `sqrt(x^2).simplify_radical()` is incorrectly simplified to `x`.

I believe the authors of #12780 should fix that issue.

There is no simplification of `sqrt(x^2)` that is equal to `abs(x)`, unless you know that `x` is real. Everywhere else in Sage, `x` is complex. Before sage-5.7, you got what you want, but you want a wrong answer.

We also accept `assume('x is a very pretty boy')`, so I'm not sure we should use that as our guide!

I'm not disagreeing that there should be an easy way to do this. Maxima should just simplify it when `x` is assumed real. That's probably the first bug I would target to get it fixed properly.

A second step would be to have ginac or pynac perform the same simplification on expressions of the simple form `sqrt(x^2)` where `x` is a single symbol and the domain of `x` is 'real'.

while trying to see how we could tell Maxima that `x` is real after `assume(x>0)`, I noticed that the examples with `assume(x,'real')` in Sage are fake:

1) in `misc/functional.py` we have:

```
        sage: a, b, c = var("a, b, c")                                          
        sage: assume((a, 'real'), (b, 'real'), (c, 'real'))                     
        sage: z = a + b*I

```
sage: a, b, c = var("a, b, c")
sage: assume((a, 'real'), (b, 'real'), (c, 'real'))

sage: bool(norm(z).simplify() == a^2 + b^2)

The assumptions aren't needed for the first result, but they are for the last one (the norm of the vector).

The `rectform()` test is also mine, but the reasoning I've forgotten.

> a possible workaround would be to have all SR variables declared complex in Maxima

indeed, maybe we could declare each new variable as complex whenever `var` is called (without `domain` argument or with `domain='complex'`).
This is by the way what the documentation of `var` says:

```
sage: var?
...
   By default, var returns a complex variable. To define real or
   positive variables we can specify the domain as:
```

Maybe we can add a call to `assume` in the function `symbol` of `symbolic/ring.pyx`?

I wonder why `(x<sup>3)</sup>(1/3)` is not simplified for real `x` though...

z<sup>1/n</sup> for z a complex number is defined as the principal branch, which is that having the least argument, see for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root.

Thus the square root of -1 is I, having argument pi/2, whereas -I has argument 3*pi/2.

The cube root of -1 is 1/2 + I*sqrt(3)/2, having argument pi/3.

This is messy largely because we have never decided on what `sqrt` or e.g. `x^(1/3)` is supposed to do, particularly when applied to a symbolic expression.

* Is it a function from the real numbers to the real numbers (choose the positive root)?
* Is it a function from the complex numbers to the complex numbers (choose the principal branch)?
* Is the codomain of `sqrt` the same as a "domain" of its argument? For example, if `x` is a variable with `domain=real`, should `sqrt(x)` be an expression whose domain is `"real"`?
* Do we want `sqrt` and friends to be functions at all? When solving equations, it'd be nice if we had access to both square roots.

etc.

If you ask five different people, you'll get five different answers. I'm wary of any "simplification" that might return an incorrect result to any of those people: simplification should be unambiguous and obviously correct. Any other more-powerful but less-straightforward operation should be called something else, like we've done with `x.canonicalize_radical()`.
