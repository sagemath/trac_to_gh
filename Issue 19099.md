Inserting the braces is a nice start, but it doesn't fix the entire problem. Compare:

```
sage: var("a1,a2")
(a1, a2)
sage:  latex(log( (a1+a1*a2)/a2))
\log\left(\frac{a_{1} a_{2} + a_{1}}{a_{2}}\right)
sage:  latex(lambert_w( (a1+a1*a2)/a2))
\operatorname{W_0}({(a1*a2 + a1)/a2})
```

As you can see a function like "log" processes its arguments further for latex. Just inserting braces doesn't cut it.

In bessel.py, the latex-ing of the arguments is done explicitly:

```
    def _print_latex_(self, n, z):
        return r"\operatorname{J_{%s}}(%s)" % (latex(n), latex(z))
```

That's probably the thing to do for lambert_w too.

Replying to [comment:3 vdelecroix]:
> What is the point of having a separate `n==0` case?
There's a case split for normal printing, suppressing a zero argument:

```
sage: lambert_w(0,x)
lambert_w(x)
sage: lambert_w(1,x)
lambert_w(1, x)
```

Possibly the same was done for latex at some point. I agree that with the current code, the case split can be removed in the latex code.
