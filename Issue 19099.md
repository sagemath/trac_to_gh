Inserting the braces is a nice start, but it doesn't fix the entire problem. Compare:

```
sage: var("a1,a2")
(a1, a2)
sage:  latex(log( (a1+a1*a2)/a2))
\log\left(\frac{a_{1} a_{2} + a_{1}}{a_{2}}\right)
sage:  latex(lambert_w( (a1+a1*a2)/a2))
\operatorname{W_0}({(a1*a2 + a1)/a2})
```
As you can see a function like "log" processes its arguments further for latex. Just inserting braces doesn't cut it.

In bessel.py, the latex-ing of the arguments is done explicitly:

```
    def _print_latex_(self, n, z):
        return r"\operatorname{J_{%s}}(%s)" % (latex(n), latex(z))
```
That's probably the thing to do for lambert_w too.

Replying to [comment:3 vdelecroix]:
> What is the point of having a separate `n==0` case?

There's a case split for normal printing, suppressing a zero argument:

```
sage: lambert_w(0,x)
lambert_w(x)
sage: lambert_w(1,x)
lambert_w(1, x)
```
Possibly the same was done for latex at some point. I agree that with the current code, the case split can be removed in the latex code.

Here is a version with latex applied to the argument.

I have also taken the opportunity to enhance the link with maxima, which now has the other branches of LambertW.

Could you please add doctests for the Maxima additions? When done you can set positive since patchbot is already ok with it.
