The behaviour of `__init__` when called with an iterable `Element` as initializer is not consistent between different types of dense matrices:

```
sage: vec = vector(ZZ, [1])
sage: MatrixSpace(RR, 1, 1)(vec)
[1.00000000000000]
sage: MatrixSpace(CC, 1, 1)(vec)
[1.00000000000000]
sage: MatrixSpace(ZZ, 1, 1)(vec)
[...]
TypeError: unable to coerce entry to an integer
sage: MatrixSpace(QQ, 1, 1)(vec)
[...]
TypeError: entries must be coercible to a list or integer
sage: MatrixSpace(ZZ['t'], 1, 1)(vec)
[1]
```

Specialized versions probably should follow what generic matrices do.
