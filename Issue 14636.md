turn merge squashing on, then merge as you'd normally merge a PR on github.

With subsequent `git rebase`?

can you please answer this important question:

Replying to [comment:42 jdemeyer]:
> Is there actually a place where the "official" sagenb tarballs are hosted? If not, then we can just define my tarball as the official one.

My impression was that, whenever you made a new SageNB release, you just host it somewhere on a personal website. So then I don't see why my sagenb-0.12 on this ticket would be less official than your previous sagenb releases.

But please tell me if I'm wrong...

Yeah, as long as I don't have to create an extra merge commit (which is not possible on GH but should be possible command line, as you say) then that is fine.

I presume one just has to look that it builds and runs. It's merely re-packaging of the same thing, right?

Inconsistent access is a nightmare if you need to get a large file (e.g. current Sage source tarball), as opposed to several small files.

Besides, mind you, much more popular than Sage software distribution systems, e.g. ones for Python, Haskell, OCaml do require internet access, by default. Convenience for the majority (and for developers) ought to come before exotic usage cases.

Hence tarballs on thumb drives.

If/when we make sagenb into an optional or experimental package, I have no objections to doing the same with these dependencies. But until then, in what way is including a dozen packages an inconvenience? It doesn't take up any extra disk space or extra time building Sage since we're already including them, it just adds a few directories in `build/pkgs`. How is this more of an inconvenience than requiring internet access during compilation of Sage?

And how are Sage developers supposed to know about this, if they are going to be traveling and without good internet access for a while? It sounds like a good idea, but I still don't see what it saves vs. making these standard Sage packages (for as long as sagenb is a standard Sage package, but no longer).

I'm not quite sure why the "web-based" is relevant here; why not say "browser-based" instead?  I use my browser all the time without being on the internet - primarily as a Sage GUI, but most browsers now save things for later reading, I often save pages to show to students in situations where wireless isn't working and it opens in the browser, etc.  After all, most people aren't running their local sagenb or Jupyter as a web service.

Anyway, this solution seems to me like a good intermediate solution.
