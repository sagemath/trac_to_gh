The giacpy 0.4.8 interface has a bad sig_on() in Pygen `__inter__`

The giac 1.2.0-15 or later upstream source has an interesting fix for groebner basis: in 1.2.0-13 the answer of gbasis could contain some extra null terms.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18841

Additionally an evaluation bug was fixed
Some particular symbols of the SR such as sqrt could gives problems if they were not evaluated.
Ex:
`libgiac(sqrt(5)/x).factor()` was OK
but
`(sqrt(5)/libgiac(x)).factor()` was 0

indeed I can reproduce this with cython 0.22-p5 while it seemed OK with 0.22-p4. it looks like with this version I need to change in setup.py:
`include_dirs=sage_include_directories()` to
`include_dirs=sage_include_directories()+['.']`
to have a successfull built.

Sorry to have missed this cython change, I was testing with 6.8.beta7.

I think the problem with your package is the `__init__.py` file. You're not supposed to have that in the top-level directory. After removing it, everything works fine without changing the include directory (which you shouldn't do).
