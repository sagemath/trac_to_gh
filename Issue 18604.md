# Issue 18604: giacpy and giac spkg update

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18841

Original creator: frederichan

Original creation time: 2015-07-02 10:26:00

Keywords: giac, giacpy, groebner

The giacpy 0.4.8 interface has a bad sig_on() in Pygen `__inter__`

The giac 1.2.0-15 or later upstream source has an interesting fix for groebner basis: in 1.2.0-13 the answer of gbasis could contain some extra null terms.

Additionally an evaluation bug was fixed
Some particular symbols of the SR such as sqrt could gives problems if they were not evaluated.
Ex:
`libgiac(sqrt(5)/x).factor()` was OK
but
`(sqrt(5)/libgiac(x)).factor()` was 0

So I have updated the spkg-src to pass the `sage-sanity-check-package` test of #18826. To not modify the checksum.ini of the current archive I have keept the tar.gz output instead of changing to .bz2

Also this is wrong:

```/usr/bin/env sage -python
```

Why not simply

```/usr/bin/env python
```

indeed I can reproduce this with cython 0.22-p5 while it seemed OK with 0.22-p4. it looks like with this version I need to change in setup.py:
`include_dirs=sage_include_directories()` to
`include_dirs=sage_include_directories()+['.']`
to have a successfull built.

Sorry to have missed this cython change, I was testing with 6.8.beta7.

Interesting. That might be an unintended side-effect of the Cython change.

I think the problem with your package is the `__init__.py` file. You're not supposed to have that in the top-level directory. After removing it, everything works fine without changing the include directory (which you shouldn't do).

Also: can you just call your package `giacpy-0.5.1` instead of inventing complicated version names like `giacpy-0.5.0p1`?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-07-13 08:15:52

So, to recap, I think the following are needed for `giacpy-0.5.1`:
- revert the change to include directories
- remove the `__init__.py` file
- fix the `#!` line of `setup.py`

OK so I have cleaned this `__init__.py`. thank you for your help
