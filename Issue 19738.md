# Issue 19738: Improve Linear code from parity-check matrix

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dlucas

Original creation time: 2016-01-27 15:30:09

As #19930 introduces a new encoder which computes a generator matrix for codes defined from their generator matrices, it would be nice to update `codes.LinearCodeFromCheckMatrix`.

It could be renamed, made a class, and thus use the encoder described above.

Should the description for this ticket read "...computes a generator matrix for codes defined from their  ~~generator~~ _parity check_ matrices" ?

Yes, nice catch! I changed the description.

Hi David

Which encoder are you mentionning in the description of the ticket ?

Are you suggesting to use the encoder `codes.encoders.LinearCodeParityCheckEncoder` ?

This encoder is deprecated.

Actually, the point was to use the `ParityCheckEncoder` to as a building brick
for some codes, instead of having `LinearCodeFromCheckMatrix`
But as you said, `ParityCheckEncoder` is deprecated, and #21165 deprecates `LinearCodeFromCheckMatrix`.

So, let's set this ticket to `invalid/won't fix`.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
