I dont't understand 's' in "Complexity is `O(n log(n) log(log(n)))` additions/sub**s**tractions in R". Same applies to the change in `convolution.py`.

Isn't there a missing test, when `widget.descriprion = abbrev[0]` has not been noticed?

Obviously. I'll try to have a look (I wrote that code).

I think it's best to revert this change here and leave it to a new ticket: #24466

OK, but what about "substractions"? I think it is an error, but maybe I do not understand English here.

"substractions" -> "subtractions" and "handeled" -> "handled"
