# Issue 13962: use "cp -pR", not "cp -pr"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14166

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2013-02-22 20:01:23

Assignee: leif

Keywords: cp symlink

According to [http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.68/html_node/Limitations-of-Usual-Tools.html#Limitations-of-Usual-Tools](http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.68/html_node/Limitations-of-Usual-Tools.html#Limitations-of-Usual-Tools), we should avoid the "-r" flag for `cp`. On linux, using "-r" or "-R" doesn't make a difference, but on OS X, the man page for cp says that with the -r flag, "it does not correctly copy special files, symbolic links, or fifo's."

As a result, after building from scratch using #6495 on OS X, the various files `doc/en/reference/MODULE/conf.py`, which are all supposed to by symlinks to `doc/en/reference/conf_sub.py`, are copies of that file instead, and the hg repo is not clean. So I'm marking this as a blocker. I think that to fix the real problem, only the Sage library needs to be patched, but we might as well apply the scripts patch as well. I think that the only other instance of "cp -pr" in any spkg is in the R spkg, and I don't think those instances are worth fixing right now.

On Solaris, things are more complicated. If we use `cp -pr`, then it behaves like OS X, i.e., badly. If we use `cp -pR`, then it still doesn't work; instead, `cp -pPR` almost works. The only problem is that file permissions can get messed up, at least when a file in one directory is a link pointing to another directory. Consider this directory TEST:

```
$ ls -l TEST/
total 6
drwxr-xr-x   2 palmieri other          3 Feb 25 04:07 dir/
-rw-r--r--   1 palmieri other         79 Feb 24 21:13 FILE
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:06 link1 -> FILE
$ ls -l TEST/dir/
total 1
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:07 link2 -> FILE
```

Now copy it:

```
$ cp -pPR TEST X
$ ls -l X
total 6
drwxr-xr-x   2 palmieri other          3 Feb 25 04:07 dir/
-rwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other         79 Feb 25 04:06 FILE*
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:08 link1 -> FILE*
$ ls -l X/dir
total 1
lrwxrwxrwx   1 palmieri other          4 Feb 25 04:08 link2 -> FILE
```

Note the permissions on FILE. The way around this seems to be to use `/usr/xpg4/bin/cp -pPR`@` SOURCE TARGET`, naturally.

Let's ignore the scripts patch and just focus on the patch for the Sage library.

Changing keywords from "cp symlink" to "cp symlink OSX Solaris".

There are at least two good ways to test this: start with a fresh Sage 5.8.beta1 tarball, unpack the sage library spkg (spkg/standard/sage-5.8.beta1.spkg), apply this patch, package it back up (with sage -pkg sage-5.8.beta1). Then build Sage. Or do something similar, but start with a built version of Sage. Delete devel/sage and devel/sage-main. Delete spkg/installed/sage-5.8.beta1 and anything more recent. Create a patched version of the Sage spkg, as above. Run `make ptestlong`.

Alternatively, `tar` is more portable than `cp` and usually deals with symbolic links correctly. I know for example PARI use `tar` during the installer for this reason. [I don't know tar well enough](http://www.xkcd.org/1168/), but something along the lines of

```
# tar is the most portable way to copy files
tar c * .hg* | (cd "$DEVEL/sage-main/" && tar x)
```

If you decide to stick with the current approach, please use

```
[ -x /usr/xpg4/bin/cp ]
```

instead of

```
[ $UNAME = "SunOS" ]
```

I like the tar approach. Here's a patch.

With this patch, everything seems to work on sage.math, a few other linux machines on skynet, OpenSolaris (hawk), Solaris (mark), and a few OS X 10.8 boxes I have access to.
