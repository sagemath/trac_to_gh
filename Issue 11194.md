# Issue 11194: Incorrect documentation for enumerated set difference

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11366

Original creator: kcrisman

See [this documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/sets/set.html#sage.sets.set.Set_object.difference), where the definition for set difference and set intersection is the same. 

The actual doctests are correct, I think, it's just some sloppy copying or something in the definition.

A very minor problem, but I believe that the subject line of your patch should read: `Trac #11366: Doc change for set difference in Set.`.
