The issue reported in https://groups.google.com/g/sage-release/c/fXpbYwaqt9o/m/929SlEXcCAAJ is likely caused by the upgrade to singular (#25993).
Upstream singular introduced some rather unfortunate linker flags in 4.1.3 or earlier.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31592

While `/usr and /usr/local` made it back in `DEFAULT_CHECKING_PATH` in `flint-check.m4`, if you use that variable that means they have not been found there previously by the bit that check standard paths - that I have added [https://github.com/Singular/Singular/pull/981](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/pull/981). So, I haven't asked for that re-addition to be removed. If you get to the bit checking `DEFAULT_CHECKING_PATH` they won't be found there anyway.

It would have been nice for `gmp-check.m4` to follow that model. That would also prevent `/usr/lib` and `/usr/local/lib` to ever end up in a `rpath` unless you explicitly pass it as a path to be checked.
