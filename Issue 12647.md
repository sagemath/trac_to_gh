What about performance hit? All latex cells and latex output that was not handled by jsmath will get twice as slow, which kind of concerns me.

On the other hand, as far as I understand we only gain labels/references support within a single cell, not within a whole worksheet.

Will the performance hit be significant? I wonder if anyone will be writing big blocks of latex text in a cell. Even for a single journal-like page (or maybe two such pages), the latex compilation process is plenty fast.

You are right about the fact that the labels will be effective only within the cell. Is it better to be correct than (just a bit more) efficient in this case? After all, if I am writing small pieces of latex on the notebook, I would want it to "just work."

The performance hit is one system call (which seems to be about 0.1sec using cache depending on the system) plus the actual running time of LaTeX. This may seem small, but I think it can be an issue in two situations: a heavily used server for many users and a worksheet with a lot of latex pieces, e.g. all outputs of cells can be run through the actual LaTeX if they are using something not supported by jsmath.

I don't have any numbers to support my concerns and I am not quite sure how to get them, but it seems to me that latex should not be run the second time unless necessary, because usually it is not necessary. And sometimes two times are not sufficient.

Maybe it is best to maintain the status quo, and not make any changes after all.

If we try to parse the latex log file and try to find out if a second or third run is needed then this parsing itself will take some time (disc access, search within file almost till the end for phrase like "rerun to get crossreferenc.", etc). This will defeat the purpose of saving server load by reducing unnecessary latex runs.

Well, if evaluating the same %latex cell the second time would actually run LaTeX the second time, it should not cost any time in execution and would allow using references.

I don't care.

It is choice between compiling more than once (easy fix) and changing the latex build system (big change).

Feel free to close the ticket.
