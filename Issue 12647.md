What about performance hit? All latex cells and latex output that was not handled by jsmath will get twice as slow, which kind of concerns me.

On the other hand, as far as I understand we only gain labels/references support within a single cell, not within a whole worksheet. It seems to me that it is not a very often needed functionality, i.e. you need it only for relatively large block of latex without computational cells in it. Can it be made optional? I.e. if someone needs it, then latex is called twice but only after calling some function, say `latex_calls(2)`.

Will the performance hit be significant? I wonder if anyone will be writing big blocks of latex text in a cell. Even for a single journal-like page (or maybe two such pages), the latex compilation process is plenty fast.

You are right about the fact that the labels will be effective only within the cell. Is it better to be correct than (just a bit more) efficient in this case? After all, if I am writing small pieces of latex on the notebook, I would want it to "just work."

Maybe it is best to maintain the status quo, and not make any changes after all.

If we try to parse the latex log file and try to find out if a second or third run is needed then this parsing itself will take some time (disc access, search within file almost till the end for phrase like "rerun to get crossreferenc.", etc). This will defeat the purpose of saving server load by reducing unnecessary latex runs.

I don't care.

It is choice between compiling more than once (easy fix) and changing the latex build system (big change).

Feel free to close the ticket.
