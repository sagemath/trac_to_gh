# Issue 14557: SkewTableau does follow global_options of Tableaux

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14761

`SkewTableau` should follow the same the conventions set in `Tableaux.global_options` for the method `.pp()`.  In particular, it should follow `convention="French"` displayed in reverse order.  This should be changed in the method `_repr_diagram`

Just double check that everything is done in #14101, I think I ended up taking care of all of it in there. (I hope you haven't done any work on this Mike; sorry if you have.)

This covers .pp() but doesn't cover `latex`, or `display`.  Are you planning on adding those to #14101?

They are done in (the latest version of) #14101:

```
sage: S = SkewTableau([[None, None, 3], [1, 2, 4], [5]]) 
sage: S
[[None, None, 3], [1, 2, 4], [5]]
sage: S.pp()
  .  .  3
  1  2  4
  5
sage: SkewTableaux.global_options(convention="French")
sage: S.pp()
  5
  1  2  4
  .  .  3
sage: SkewTableaux.global_options(display="diagram")
sage: S
  5
  1  2  4
  .  .  3
sage: latex(S) # If you can parse this, you'll see it's in French notation
{\def\lr#1{\multicolumn{1}{|@{\hspace{.6ex}}c@{\hspace{.6ex}}|}{\raisebox{-.3ex}{$#1$}}}
\raisebox{-.6ex}{$\begin{array}[t]{*{3}c}\cline{1-1}
\lr{5}\\\cline{1-3}
\lr{1}&\lr{2}&\lr{4}\\\cline{1-3}
&&\lr{3}\\\cline{3-3}
\end{array}$}
}
```

I'm a little confused about what options are set where.


```
sage: SkewTableaux.global_options(latex="list")
...
ValueError: latex is not an option for skew tableaux
```

gives a traceback error.

That should read "list is not an option ..."


```
sage: Tableaux.global_options(display="diagram")
sage: SkewTableau([[None,1],[2]])
[[None, 1], [2]]
sage: SkewTableaux.global_options(display="diagram")
sage: SkewTableau([[None,1],[2]])
  .  1
  2
sage: SkewTableaux.global_options(display="compact")
...
ValueError: compact is not a valid value for display in the options for skew tableaux
```

I wouldn't know to look for the global options in `SkewTableaux` to set the diagram display given that "convention" and "latex" options can be set in `Tableaux.global_options`

Shouldn't they consistently follow a single global options?

Ah, you're right. They should be much more constistant than they are. Will fix #14101.

Alright they are now the same global options in #14101. I believe we can close this ticket as a duplicate (and any other problems can be posted on #14101).

Hey Mike,

Is everything that you'd want done taken care of in #14101? If so, we should set this to positive review.

Best,

Travis

Yes.  We can close this ticket.  #14101 does a lot more than I expected for this patch.
Thanks for doing all that.

-Mike
