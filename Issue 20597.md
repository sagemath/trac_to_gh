Currently, the plan is to create a new class for the decomposition, and use this to rewrite the ``is_graphic`` function, so that we can return a graph that realizes the matroid.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20834

I don't know how I introduced this runtime error. The function does need to be reworked to make sure that any of the edges in ``Z``, which correspond to parent markers of type 2, 3, or 4 children are on the end(s) of the path.
