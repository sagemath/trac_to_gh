Currently, the plan is to create a new class for the decomposition, and use this to rewrite the ``is_graphic`` function, so that we can return a graph that realizes the matroid.

Just a quick observation as I'm looking at the current code: the filename should be changed to reflect the actual authors of the algorithm.

I don't know how I introduced this runtime error. The function does need to be reworked to make sure that any of the edges in ``Z``, which correspond to parent markers of type 2, 3, or 4 children are on the end(s) of the path.
