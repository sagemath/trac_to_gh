This test seems a little fragile to me:

```
sage: f = S.basis()[0].lift()
sage: e == f
True
```

I think a better test is to scale `f` by `e.leading_coefficient() / f.leading_coefficient()`. Otherwise LGTM.

Fixed ! But If you go that way there is another fragile assumption: the fact that the 0-th idempotent is one whose bi-sided Peirce summand is of dimension 1. I'm checking this fact, but There is no waranty that the algorithm wil allway return the idempotent in the same order. For H4 among the 8 idempotents two of them have summand of dimension 2. Do you think I should write a loop to find such an idempotent ?

That's a good point. Well, how about doing something more simple and just printing the dimension of `S` to emphasize that we are using (and sort of testing) that property?

That's exactly what the line

```
sage: S = A.peirce_summand(e, e); S
Free module generated by {0} over Rational Field
```

is doing.

Ah, right. Actually, we are overthinking this:

```
sage: S.retract(e) in S
True
```

Ideally we should not need the retract, but that is a separate deficiency IMO of `SubmoduleWithBasis` (instead using `CombinatorialFreeModule.__contains__`, which just checks the `parent(x) == self`).

This is a much better tests. Actually the `in S` is not needed. Retract breaks:

```
ValueError: B[map: ...] is not in the image
```

I left it anyway. And fixed a typo elsewhere by the way.

Thank you. Like I said, ideally the test would just be `e in S`, but that is a separate issue.

LGTM modulo `TESTS::` -> `TESTS:` since you have plain-text after it. Addendum: also capitalize Pierce in the `TESTS:` block. Once fixed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
