```
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/bin/gccmpir', needed by `/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/var/lib/sage/installed/arb-2.12.0.p0'.  Stop.
```

From build/make/Makefile:

```
deps_arb =  $(SAGE_LOCAL)/bin/gcc$(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr flint
```

This line reads "`deps_arb = $(MP_LIBRARY) mpfr flint`" in my clang installation.

Because you have a working gcc so the optional built-in gcc is not compiled...
