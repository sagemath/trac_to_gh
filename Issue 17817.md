# Issue 17817: Add is_finite method for the Symbolic Ring

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18054

Original creator: bruno

Original creation time: 2015-03-25 14:34:11

Keywords: is_finite symbolic_ring

In this ticket, I add a method `is_finite()` to the `SymbolicRing`. The necessity for such a method occurs to me in #17840. Of course, the answer is `False`.

Looks good; the only comment I have is that the two lines inside the `EXAMPLES` block should be indented by 4 spaces.
