These shouldn't get picked up (in this case, only the header files matter anyway),
since $SAGE_LOCAL/{include,lib} come first in the -I and -L directives:

configure:8898: gcc -o conftest -O2 -g  -fPIC -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include  -I/usr/local/include -L/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/lib -L/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib conftest.c -lntl -lgmp -lreadline -ltermcap -lm -L/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/lib -lflint -lmpfr -lmpir >&5
In file included from /Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint/fmpz.h:38:0,
                 from conftest.c:94:
/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint/flint.h:74:2: error: #error GMP 5.0.0 or MPIR 2.6.0 or later are required
/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint/flint.h:78:2: error: #error MPFR 3.0.0 or later is required
configure:8898: $? = 1


It would be interesting to see GCC's verbose output (in particular, the list of
include folders) as well as the preprocessed source of that conftest.c, but I
guess it's not that easy to add the appropriate flags there.

It shouldn't at all.  You could move or remove them temporarily though.

Provided Volker's patch solves the issue, probably not worth the effort.

Otherwise I'd say it's a compiler bug, if we can trust what's in `config.log` (i.e., the shown command line leading to the failure).

Jan, you may try whether

```sh

or simply

```sh
gcc -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include -I/usr/local/include -c conftest.c

also fails for you, in a Sage subshell (`./sage --sh`).

Replying to [comment:14 jkeitel]:
> Yep, they both do.

Ouch.  Could you paste the output of

```sh
gcc -v -save-temps -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include -I/usr/local/include -c conftest.c
```

and attach the generated `conftest.i`?

Ah ok, thanks.

So it's pretty specific to "Sage's" GCC, which treats `$SAGE_LOCAL/include` as a system include folder, but not `/usr/local/include`.

One day we should [instead] fix the GCC spkg then... :P
