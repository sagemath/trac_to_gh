After updating to 0.7 in #13176 we should move into the future with 0.8 which will be released soon.

There is an experimental 0.8 spkg at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/iandrus/sage_mode-0.8.spkg

Currently the major goal is to support python.el by fgallina which will be in Emacs 24.2.

The AUCTeX integration is great! But I do notice one problem with emacs 24:

If you don't have org-mode installed and you load a TeX file -- with or without any Sage stuff in it -- I get "Can't find library org". If I then install org-mode, loading a TeX file gives `File mode specification error: (void-function loop)`.

This is with the current state of Ubuntu 13.04: emacs 24.2, AUCTeX 11.87 and org-mode 7.9.2. In Ubuntu 12.10 (versions 23.4, 11.86, 7.8.11, respectively) things work fine.
