Two commonly desired constructions in a Coxeter group are to:
a) Iterate over all elements of a given length - this happens especially in affine or other infinite coxeter groups in order to test hypotheses, construct homogenous elements, etc...
b) Choose a random element, possibly with length specified.  This often occurs to see if a non-special element has a given property.

Iterating over all element sof a given length in particular has a nice solution (due to N. Thiery) and anecdotally has been implemented (usually in an inelegant fashion) by numerous community members in response to short-term problems.

We provide some code implementing these functions!

That's strange; I'm not sure why it isn't there.

The code should be the same used in the `AffinePermutationGroup` for the methods `elements_of_length` and `random_element`.

Example:

sage: A=AffinePermutationGroup(['A',4,1])

sage: len(list(A.elements_of_length(1)))

5

sage: A.random_element(4)

Type A affine permutation with window [0, 4, 3, 2, 6]

Maybe we should then move the code to Coxeter groups, it it works.

Hey Frederic,

I've done some minor tweaks and made it so that `random_element` chooses the length at random in `[0, 1000]` (so the word is not too long) if not specified. LGTM otherwise, so if you're happy with my changes, then positive review.
