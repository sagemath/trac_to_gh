# Issue 31495: ManifoldSubset: New methods declare_empty, declare_nonempty, is_empty, has_defined_points

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31732

A subset is declared empty by giving it (or any superset) an open cover that is an empty family.

A subset is declared nonempty by defining a point on it (or on any subset).

I am not sure whether this is a good point to hook in, but long-term it would be nice to things like Cech cohomology. This construction needs "good covers" which are basically given by contractible intersections. Currently, we cannot determine a subset being contractible (or even connected). But perhaps this is something to consider at this point already?

An idea to do things like this would be to try to break complicated domains into "simple" subsets (for which we can algorithmically verify that they are simply connected) and to then use algebraic topology (e.g., simplicial complexes) on the subsets. At this point, I don't know what properties other than emptiness/nonemptiness really needs to be encoded on the level of a single subset.

Could you please open a new metaticket that collects the rough ideas and updates your progress regarding subsets? I think it would make it easier to keep track, at least for me.

If you don't plan a lot of such tickets, maybe the metaticket #30525 is sufficient.

Matthias already opened #31740 for that. It's a nice overview and as you can see, there are plenty of tickets concerning subsets already. Thanks Matthias!

Mh, for some reason patchbot complains about coverage.

Ah, `is_empty`, `declare_nonempty` and `has_defined_points` do not admit examples/tests.

Thanks! Patchbot is also green.

How exactly is this ticket related to #31743? What exactly are the dependencies you have in mind?

Other than that, looks good to me. Eric, what do you say?

#31743 will certainly depend on the present ticket.
