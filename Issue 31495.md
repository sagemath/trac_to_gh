A subset is declared empty by giving it (or any superset) an open cover that is an empty family.

A subset is declared nonempty by defining a point on it (or on any subset).

I am not sure whether this is a good point to hook in, but long-term it would be nice to things like Cech cohomology. This construction needs "good covers" which are basically given by contractible intersections. Currently, we cannot determine a subset being contractible (or even connected). But perhaps this is something to consider at this point already?

If you don't plan a lot of such tickets, maybe the metaticket #30525 is sufficient.
