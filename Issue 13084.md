Implementation of absolute value (abs), floor (floor) and ceiling (ceil) function for elements in quadratic number field. This depends (not very much) on comparisons in quadratic number fields implemented in tickects #7160 and #13213.

Strangely enough, floor and ceil functions are much faster than abs function! The reason is because the comparison in #13213 which is called in abs is actually very slow.

```
sage: sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2, name='sqrt2')
sage: %timeit abs(sqrt2)
125 loops, best of 3: 2.22 ms per loop
sage: %timeit floor(sqrt2)
625 loops, best of 3: 3.37 µs per loop
```

Does the removal of

```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+1, embedding=CDF.gen()) 
```

as an example mean that one couldn't use this syntax at all any more?  Would number fields from quadratics not automatically be quadratic fields (when mathematically appropriate, I'm excluding `x^2-1` and the like) and inherit these methods, or would that simply not work now?

This syntax is still available. The patch only aims to implement methods abs, floor and ceil for quadratic elements. As an example

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: sqrt2.floor()
1
```

It is yet possible (without the patch) to do

```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: floor(sqrt2)
1
```

But there is a simpler and faster way to do it compared to what floor does (using the real interval field with finer and finer approximations). Note that if the method .floor is present, the the function floor will use it!

Yes, it is the way it is

```
sage: type(NumberField(x^2 + 1, 'a'))
<class 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field.NumberField_quadratic_with_category'>
```
