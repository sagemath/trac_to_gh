# Issue 34049: Cookiecutter for Sage user projects with devcontainer

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34286

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2022-08-06 06:02:18

A cross of
- https://github.com/ilyasotkov/vscode-devcontainer-python-cookiecutter
- https://github.com/mmasdeu/sage_package_template

The devcontainer config would be one of those added in #33671 (sagemath-sage or downstream-...).

Prospective sage users on Windows can use the devcontainer config to automate the Sage install in WSL. VS Code walks you through this.

Also a command `sage --cookiecutter` could be added.

Since the template consists mostly in static files, it should be enough to use github's template repo https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository

That's a great idea, I forgot about those!
