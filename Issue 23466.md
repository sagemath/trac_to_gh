I just checked: the old doctests did not even call the __richcmp__ methods defined.
So I will modify them old doctests.

Btw in any case (old&new) we get:

```
sage: FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,1,matrix.identity(1))==FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,1,matrix.identity(1)*2)
True
```

Is that a bug or a feature? I would consider two quadratic spaces with different inner products
very different and mathematically not equal. After all the inner product is the whole point of this class.
