# Issue 15423: QQbar minpoly() speed depends on PARI stack size

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15660

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2014-01-10 10:13:32

From a doctest in `qqbar.py`:

```
sage: x = polygen(AA)
sage: %time QQbar.polynomial_root(x^5 - x - 1, CIF(RIF(0.1, 0.2), RIF(1.0, 1.1))).imag().minpoly()
CPU times: user 27.48 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 27.52 s
Wall time: 27.77 s
x^20 - 5/8*x^16 - 95/256*x^12 - 625/1024*x^10 - 5/512*x^8 - 1875/8192*x^6 + 25/4096*x^4 - 625/32768*x^2 + 2869/1048576
```


```
sage: pari.allocatemem(1<<30)
PARI stack size set to 1073741824 bytes
sage: x = polygen(AA)
sage: %time QQbar.polynomial_root(x^5 - x - 1, CIF(RIF(0.1, 0.2), RIF(1.0, 1.1))).imag().minpoly()
CPU times: user 2.68 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 2.83 s
Wall time: 2.82 s
x^20 - 5/8*x^16 - 95/256*x^12 - 625/1024*x^10 - 5/512*x^8 - 1875/8192*x^6 + 25/4096*x^4 - 625/32768*x^2 + 2869/1048576
```
