Just why? The default compiler on Debian 9 *is* supported.

When building with our gcc the build then fails later when trying to compile ncurses: http://build.sagemath.org/#/builders/69/builds/1/steps/10/logs/ncurses

Note: has gcc 5.4.0 which will be dropped in #33316

```

vbraun@k8s:~/Buildbot$ gcc --version

Debian 9 has gcc 6.3.0 as the default gcc.

Your gcc says "Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.12". That's not Debian.

I guess thats Ubuntu 16.04.2 then, ESM until April 2026

Yes, #33316 drops support for ubuntu-xenial with its default toolchain.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-05-30 22:31:42

The upgrade path is to use `ubuntu-xenial-toolchain-gcc_9`, see #32074.

Comment by vbraun created at 2022-05-30 22:35:37

Still would be nice if your own ncurses would compile with our own gcc... Maybe check #32137?

I assume we can close it as outdated

It seems Ubuntu 16.04.2 is not there anymore.
