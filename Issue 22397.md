Keywords: Bruhat Tits, Harmonic Cocycles, Overconvergent

The following code illustrates the bug:


```
sage: X = BruhatTitsQuotient(7,2)
sage: H = X.harmonic_cocycles(4,20)
sage: A = X.padic_automorphic_forms(4,20,overconvergent=True)
sage: f = A.lift(H.basis()[0]).modular_form(method='moments')
sage: T.<g> = Qq(7^2,20)
sage: a,b,c,d = X.embed_quaternion(X.get_units_of_order()[1]).change_ring(Qp(7,20)).list()
sage: (c*x + d)^4 * f(x) == f((a*x + b)/(c*x + d)) # Should return True
False
```


The problem arose because of the way distributions work, which get normalized even when the user wishes they weren't. I propose a fix to this.

The bug still seems to occur in other cases, for example here


```

sage: H = X.harmonic_cocycles(4,20)
sage: A = X.padic_automorphic_forms(4,20,overconvergent=True)

sage: T.<x> = Qq(7^2,20)
sage: a,b,c,d = X.embed_quaternion(X.get_units_of_order()[1]).change_ring(Qp(7,20)).list()
sage: (c*x + d)^4 * f(x) - f((a*x + b)/(c*x + d))

or here


```

sage: H = X.harmonic_cocycles(4,20)
sage: A = X.padic_automorphic_forms(4,20,overconvergent=True)

I tried to track down the problem, but didn't suceed. When evaluating the lift of the harmonic cocycle on random matrices, I just noticed that the values for the higher moments seem to be wrong.

I tracked the error. I was trying to be extra careful in the lifting step and it turns out that it's not needed. The old code did not have this "functionality" and that's why it worked!
