IMHO this is pointless, you cannot use Sage without GPLv3+ libraries. So effectively you can only produce a working Sage under GPLv3+, regardless of whether our own library code is GPLv2+ or GPLv3+. I admit that it did confuse me originally, but why should we have to guard against merging any file that is GPLv3+ only?

If somebody still feels strongly about the issue you have my permission to change points.py. But the developer manual should explain the rationale behind that.

Does that mean you give your clear permissions to allow us to change your contributions to the sage library from GPLv3+ to GPLv2+ and update the statement in the reference manual?
