With this ticket, it remains

```
2       E211 whitespace before '('
83      E225 missing whitespace around operator
1       E227 missing whitespace around bitwise or shift operator
11      E402 module level import not at top of file
```

The E221 cannot be avoided. E225 and E227 are related to pointers. E402 is due to the `cimport cython` statement before other imports.

LGTM, although I will caveat this with `[]` is another operator and Python says higher priority operators (in this case, the `+` inside them) do not need spaces around them. Although that is my more official justification for otherwise saying I think it makes the code harder to read and I generally dislike it. `^^;;`

It's certainly because I'm older and need glasses, but I find it easier to read with some spaces ;)

Thanks for the review.
