# Issue 26772: py3: avoid sorting vertices and edges in method treewidth

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27009

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-01-03 14:17:36

CC:  tscrim chapoton

Keywords: py3, graph

We avoid sorting vertices, edges and connected components. The code is better this way, and this fixes a doctest error with py3.

Why do you use `for v in G.vertices(sort=False):` instead of one of the iterators?

Other than that LGTM.

The graph is modified inside the loop over all vertices, so I cannot use an iterator here (at least it's safer this way).
So we can use either `G.vertices(sort=False)` or `list(G)`.
