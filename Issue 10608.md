# Issue 10608: Origin in non-full-dimensional polytopes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10661

Original creator: novoselt

Original creation time: 2011-01-20 04:31:22

Assignee: mhampton

Right now it cannot be determined:

```
sage: print LatticePolytope([(1,0,0), (-1,0,0)]).origin()
None
```

The attached little patch fixes it:

```
sage: print LatticePolytope([(1,0,0), (-1,0,0)]).origin()
2
```

(2 is the index of the origin in the internal list of 3 lattice points.)
