*This is just a rough way of computing Lie superbracket*


Definition:      F.super_bracket(self, x, y)
Source:
        def super_bracket(self, x, y):
            """
            Returns the Lie super bracket `[x, y] = x y -(-1)^{|x||y|} y x` of `x` and `y`.

            INPUT:

             - ``x``, ``y`` -- elements of ``self``

            EXAMPLES::

                sage: F = SuperAlgebrasWithBasis(QQ).example()
                sage: F
                An example of an superalgebra with basis: the free superalgebra on the generators ('a', 'b', 'c') over Rational Field
                sage: a,b,c = F.super_algebra_generators()
                sage: F.super_bracket(a,b)
                B[word: ab] - (-1)^degree(a)*degree(b)B[word: ba]

            This measures the default of commutation between `x` and `y`.
            `F` endowed with the super_bracket operation is a Lie super algebra;
            in particular, it satisfies super Jacobi's identity::

                sage: F.super_bracket( F.super_bracket(a,b), c) + F.super_bracket(F.super_bracket(b,c),a) + F.super_bracket(F.super_bracket(c,a),b)
                0
            """
	      def degree(self,x):
		 if x is even:
		   	0
		 else:
			1
		 
         return x*y - (-1)^{degree(x)*degree(y)}y*x

We need to work  (suggested by tscrim in Lie algebras tickets#14901)

for converting Mathematica codes by Grozman in the website
http://www.equaonline.com/math/SuperLie/

to sage code.

Changing keywords from "Lie superalgebras" to "Lie superalgebras, days60".
