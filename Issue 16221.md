Right now we have this inconsistency. 



```
sage: B=BraidGroup(4)
sage: b=B([1,2,3])
sage: type(b)
<class 'sage.groups.braid.Braid'>
sage: type(b*b)
<class 'sage.groups.braid.BraidGroup_class_with_category.element_class'>
```



Both should be in the same class.

Hello Miguel,

The `TestSuite` is here to detect this kind of things...

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(3)
sage: TestSuite(B).run()
```

The tests are run on elements that are obtained from the method `an_element` or `some_elements`. Right now it uses a generic method which does not rely on `_element_constructor_`. But as you can see (with the old version)

```
sage: TestSuite(B([1,2])).run()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
The following tests failed: _test_category
```


Please, implement in `BraidGroup_class`:
- a method `an_element` that return a braid
- a method `some_elements` that return some braids (built in different ways)
And then put the `TestSuite` test in the `__init__`.

Vincent
