CC:  tscrim dcoudert

Keywords: binary matrix

We move binary_matrix.pxi to binary_matrix.pxd and add a realloc function.

Furthermore we add a few type specifications of the output and use `mp_bitcnt` instead of `Py_ssize_t`, as this is used in bitset_base.pxd.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31200

I'm not sure `binary_matrix.pxd` should contain

```
+from sage.data_structures.binary_matrix cimport *
```


Isn't it necessary to also get a .pyx file, even if empty ?

I don't think a .pyx file is needed. After all, we didn't have it there before.

And `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/face_data_structure.pxd` doesn't have a pyx file for it.
