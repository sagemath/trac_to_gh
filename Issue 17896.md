Keywords: hyperplane arrangements

The Orlik-Solomon algebra is a fundamental invariant for an arrangement, which also enables computing scads of useful information about e.g. the complement.  But it's purely algebraic.  So we should have it (see also #17506).

I didn't know that this algebra could be defined for any matroid! That's really nice.

On the other hand, I'm afraid the code doesn't properly iterate the reduction.

```
            sage: M4 = matroids.CompleteGraphic(4)
            sage: OS = M4.orlik_solomon_algebra(QQ)
            sage: OS._reduce_broken_circuit(frozenset({2,3,4}))
            OS{1, 3, 4} + OS{1, 2, 3} - OS{1, 2, 4}
```

The result is malformed: {1, 3, 4} itself contains a broken circuit, so one of the monomials isn't actually a monomial. Now you could argue that this is an underscored method and might do with malformed results if the method calling it knows what it's doing, but first of all I'm not sure whether the CombinatorialFreeModule framework will keep accepting such monomials in the future, and second I cannot guarantee that the multiplication as you implemented it still works with this implementation of `_reduce_broken_circuit`.

The point is, reducing an element modulo the ideal J(M) is a multistep process, as clearing out one broken circuit might create another. If you do it until no more broken circuits remain, then I think your product is correct (though I'll have to take another look).

Another issue is the `algebra_generators`: You're setting the `i`-th generator to be `self.monomial(frozenset([i]))`, but this too might be malformed. (For example, if `M` is a uniform matroid `U_{n,1} = matroids.Uniform(1,n)`, then all basis elements are equal, which means that they cannot be distinct basis elements.)

I think both of these issues can be fixed at once. Let me do it.

OK, the above points are done.

I am out of time now, so if anyone wants to take this over, feel free to do so. If not, I'll probably return to this in a week or so.

That was going to be my argument.

> but first of all I'm not sure whether the CombinatorialFreeModule framework will keep accepting such monomials in the future,

It should because those checks are expensive and there has to be a way to tell this proposed CFM that you know what you're doing (especially in internal methods like `_from_dict`).

> and second I cannot guarantee that the multiplication as you implemented it still works with this implementation of `_reduce_broken_circuit`.

That is how the product was designed and why it worked. Although now you've basically pushed that into the recursive step. This also has an effect of making it recursive. Have you done some timing benchmarks between the two implementations?

Also this is bad:

```
if not type(S) == frozenset:
```

You should use the pythonic (and more robust if we replace it by some subclass of `frozenset`):

```
if not isinstance(S, frozenset):
```

I can change this though.

> Another issue is the `algebra_generators`: You're setting the `i`-th generator to be `self.monomial(frozenset([i]))`, but this too might be malformed. (For example, if `M` is a uniform matroid `U_{n,1} = matroids.Uniform(1,n)`, then all basis elements are equal, which means that they cannot be distinct basis elements.)

This is a good point. Good catch.

I can easily change this so the default is the base ring of the arrangement, but it can take another base ring as input. Although I think it carries less meaning in terms of studying the arrangement, but I'm not that much of an expert to know for certain.

In other news, I've math-reviewed the ticket. What remains to be done:

- Better doctests, e.g., one that would have caught my bug in `subset_image`. We don't have any nonstandard orderings, and we don't have any interesting matroids. I'd like an example with a matroid given by a graph with 3 vertices and 2 edges between each two distinct vertices.

Whoops, sorry; bad merge. You can safely ignore comment:24.
