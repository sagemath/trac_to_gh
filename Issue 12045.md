Assignee: @aghitza

For prime finite fields, one gets a strange message:

```
sage: P.<x> = GF(5)[]
sage: x/5
Exception ZeroDivisionError: 'Inverse does not exist.' in 'sage.rings.fraction_field_FpT.normalize' ignored
1/0
```

And non-prime finite fields don't complain at all:

```
sage: P.<x> = GF(25,'a')[]
sage: x/5
x
```

It has gotten worse: the first example causes Sage (5.13.beta3) to crash, and when attaching GDB to do the autopsy, GDB crashes too!

The second example still behaves in the same way.

Patch seems to work as advertised.

I think you should add an error message though: I prefer

```
ZeroDivisionError: fraction field element division by zero
```

or

```
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero in finite field
```

or even

```
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero in Finite Field in a of size 5^2
```

to

```
ZeroDivisionError
```

Replying to [comment:9 jdemeyer]:
> I think you should add an error message
Hmm.  For the finite field inversion I really like

```
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero in Finite Field in a of size 5^2
```

so I'll add this.

As for the error message when trying to do *x*/0, what fails here is strictly speaking not a division inside the fraction field, but trying to construct a fraction (from two elements of the polynomial ring) whose denominator is 0.  This is basically an implementation detail, though.

In any case, the existing "fraction field element division by zero" sounds awkward to me.  At the moment I'm undecided between three possibilities:

```
ZeroDivisionError: fraction has denominator 0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero in Univariate Polynomial Ring over Finite Field in a of size 5^2
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero in Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring over Finite Field in a of size 5^2
```

For division by 0 in the polynomial ring, I decided for 'fraction has denominator 0', but because of a different change in `polynomial_element.pyx` (see comment:11), you will only see this message when trying to construct fraction field elements by coercing a pair of elements of the polynomial ring into the fraction field; see the new doctest in `fraction_field_FpT.pyx`.
