----> 1 M.declare_union(U, V, W)

TypeError: declare_union() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
sage: M.declare_union(U, V.union(W))
sage: U.union(V).union(W)
Open subset U_union_V_union_W of the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: U.union(V.union(W))
3-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

I propose to allow more than two arguments for `declare_union`. Furthermore, something went wrong with the commutativity of the union. This should be investigated, too.

Unions of several subsets also appear in another form - as open covers (which are merely lists of subsets and not manifold subsets in their own right). One might ask whether this could be unified as well.

An issue with the existing code is that through a sequence of `declare_union` calls, it is possible to obtain a situation in which two subsets must be the same, although `declare_union` makes a (not very effective) attempt to stop the user from doing so (by checking whether the two arguments are the same).

In terms of the poset of subsets that is defined by the `_subsets` (and `_supersets`) attributes (which is visualized by the code from #31680), this is quite problematic. 

This could be solved by introducing equivalence classes of subsets - for example by keeping the `_subsets` relation acyclic and introducing an `_equal_sets` attribute; loops that update subsets will have to be modified.
The elements of the poset introduced in #31680 then would be equivalence classes of subsets rather than subsets.
