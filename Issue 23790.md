`FGP_Module` was written to model finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain. Currently, only ZZ is tested and works. 
This ticket is to make it work for all PIDs

Issues:
- `.denominator()` over number fields behaves differently from over ZZ.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24027
