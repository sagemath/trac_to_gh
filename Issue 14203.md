# Issue 14203: Test for a GNU tar on Solaris is broken

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14407

Original creator: jpflori

Original creation time: 2013-04-03 13:16:24

Assignee: drkirkby

Keywords: solaris tar

It's done too late in spkg/base/prereq-1.1-install.
Around line 134, one already tries to untar the prereq tarball which will fail with the Sun tar (at least on the Solaris I have access to... I just get "nothing" after tar completed) and exit without giving much clue (the cd command will fail as the directory does not exists).
The tests are only done around line 264.

Since I'm patching prereq anyway at #14406 (what a coincidence!), let's fix both issues there.
