Volker,
Thank you for the work making this mesh with the flask server better.  I have been bogged down with work and getting an upstream fix so that Java applets can act just like the javascript version and have a static image put up first instead of immediately launching the applet.  I have pushed that to Bob Hanson for final approval and folding into the JSmol javascript libraries.  Hopefully, that will be in JSmol/Jmol soon.  It should have no effect on this, but I will start testing what you've put together against that now.

It looks OK except for a some things that have been lost:
1. The use Java clickbox is gone.  People have requested that that be an option and I have pushed a patch upstream that should give exactly the same static image first behavior from the java applet.  
2. The specialized right click menu for Sage has been lost (or did I not push that to my repository).
3. Do we want the message reminding people that they can click to make the image live and right-click for the menu?

I've also got grab to resize working on my system.  I will try to merge it with this.
