# Issue 21752: Remove _richcmp_ from `FastDoubleFunc`

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-11-29 08:32:22

The extension class `FastDoubleFunc` does not inherit from anything, so it doesn't implement anything special for `_richcmp_`. Therefore, we can just remove the `_richcmp_` method.
