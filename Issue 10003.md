Assignee: @williamstein

Keywords: _local_tmpfile, parallel

Using the ``@`parallel` decorator on a function, the Gap instances in the different branches of the function should have distinct files for I/O.

Indeed, under normal circumstances, they are distinct:

```
sage: @parallel
....: def f(n):
....:     return gap._local_tmpfile()
....:
sage: L = [t[1] for t in f(range(5))]
sage: len(set(L))  # this is how it should be
5
```


However, it suffices to call `gap._local_tmpfile()` in the main sage branch in order to break diversity:

```
sage: print gap._local_tmpfile()
/home/king/.sage//temp/gauss/16041//interface//tmp16041
sage: L = [t[1] for t in f(range(5))]
sage: len(set(L))  # this is how it must not be
1
```


The consequences are obvious: Having different processes use the same file for passing command lines must end in a disaster.

I hope it is OK to mark this as blocker. After all, parallelisation and interfaces are both important.

```

Meanwhile, it seems to me that the problem is ultimately caused by setattr/getattr. 

I work with the definition

```
    def _local_tmpfile(self):
        try:
            return self.__local_tmpfile
        except AttributeError:
            self.__local_tmpfile = '%s/tmp'%SAGE_TMP_INTERFACE + str(self.pid())
            return self.__local_tmpfile
```


The following is rather irritating:

1. The attribute !__local_tmpfile can be accessed from within the method, but not from outside.

```
sage: gap._local_tmpfile() is gap._local_tmpfile()
True
sage: gap.__local_tmpfile
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError:
```


2. When setting the attribute !__local_tmpfile from outside, it can not be retrieved from inside the _local_tmpfile method:

```
sage: gap.__local_tmpfile = 'foobar'
sage: gap._local_tmpfile()
'/home/king/.sage//temp/gauss/21283//interface//tmp21285'
sage: gap.__local_tmpfile
'foobar'
```

Now it seems to work! With the patch, I get

1. Caching works

```
  sage: gap._local_tmpfile() is gap._local_tmpfile()
  True
```


2. Different interfaces have different tmpfiles:

```
  sage: gap._local_tmpfile() != singular._local_tmpfile()
  True
```


3. Parallelisation works:

```
  sage: @parallel
  ....: def f(n):
  ....:     return gap._local_tmpfile()
  ....:
  sage: L = [t[1] for t in f(range(5))]
  sage: len(set(L))
  5
  sage: print gap._local_tmpfile()
  /home/king/.sage//temp/gauss/24281//interface//tmp24283
  sage: L = [t[1] for t in f(range(5))]
  sage: len(set(L))
  5 
```


The ideas for my patch are:

1. As before, the name of the file is cached in an attribute !__local_tmpfile.

2. If !__local_tmpfile is not there or is None, then a new filename is created, which depends on pid(). This is different for different interface instances, including different forks of a parallelised function.

3. It must be ensured that the cache is emptied before forking. This is implemented in `Expect.quit()`: !__local_tmpfile is set to None (I tested that !__delattr!__ did not do the job).

I think this is because of Python's [name-mangling](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables):

```python
sage: gap._local_tmpfile()
'/scratch/mpatel/.sage/temp/sage.math.washington.edu/28400//interface//tmp28400'
sage: gap._Expect__local_tmpfile

Thank you! I did not know about this.

Do you think that in the `quit()` method I should now do

```
self.__delattr__('_Expect__local_tmpfile')
```

instead of 

```
self.__local_tmpfile=None
```

?

Or is testing

```
self.__local_tmpfile is None
```

quick enough, so that the patch can stay as it is?
