Much work has been done since the last commit to update the bounds to match more recent work by K. Yu as suggested by a reviewer of our paper. The arXiv variant of our paper is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00977 .

This significantly reduced the pre-LLL bounds but ultimately does not affect the post-LLL bounds.

this is missing underscore after reference

```

```

same here:

```
+    Return the constant Omega' appearing in [AKMRVW].
```

and same here

```
+        The constant ``c13``  in Section 5, [AKMRVW]
```


Please check elsewhere.

The following should have a double ::

```
+    EXAMPLES:
+
+        sage: from sage.rings.number_field.S_unit_solver import mus, Omega_prime
```


This could be `if not npi:`

```
+    if len(npi) == 0:
```



You suppressed empty lines between functions. Please put them back. Outside a class, functions must be separated by 2 empty lines. Inside classes, by just one empty line. This is pep8 official recommandation, that we want to follow.

The typo is still there

```
-    # We build a second dictionary of dictionaries.
+    # We build a second dictionary of dictiories.
```


Another typo here:

```
+        #We narrow down the list unitl only one value rmains
```


Note that pep8 also suggest that comments should look like
`  # this is a comment`
rather than
`#this is a comment`

One spurious dot here:

```
+    See [Sma1998]_., [AKMRVW]_.
```

And here False should have the same style as True

```
+    ``True`` if (1.15) is satisfied, otherwise `False`.
```


Some "Return" first lines are missing a final dot.

Instead of "var", I suggest to use "polygen" to avoid using any symbolic stuff.
