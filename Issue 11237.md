How long should we wait then?  sagenb has existed at least since sage-4.2, released 25 october 2009 (almost 2 years ago).  I think that is sufficient time.

From [this sage-notebook thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-notebook/browse_thread/thread/7e2e94cc66d63cbf/78e24a6e39d2e413?show_docid=78e24a6e39d2e413#):

```

More importantly, it would be very useful if when we remove the code 
from devel/sage/sage/server that is needed to migrate, we include an 
error message that says: "Please migrate this Sage notebook server 
install by installing a version of Sage between 4.3 and 4.8, 
inclusive." 
Incidentally, I also plan to support the format of the sage notebook 
server files from 4.3 indefinitely.  It doesn't involve any version 
specific pickles, etc.

So I guess something here about this.

I'm not clear on what is required. Where would this error message appear? During an upgrade, or when running Sage? Or should we just add something to the top-level README file?

I think we should support the following situation:
1. User has old version sage-x.y.z on his own laptop, runs Sage using the notebook interface.
2. His worksheets are stored in `$DOT_SAGE`.
3. He upgrades Sage to version 5.1 (either by `sage -upgrade` or just reinstalling from scratch).
4. He starts up the new notebook.
5. He finds his worksheets are still there.  Maybe some of his old code doesn't work anymore, but at least it should be there.

We should support this for as old versions as possible.
