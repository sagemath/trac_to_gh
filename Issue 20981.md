The family being a finite enumerated set is not enough to guarantee that the disjoint union is finite.  For example without this branch we have


```
sage: F = Family(range(10), lambda i: ZZ)
sage: D = DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets(F)
sage: F in FiniteEnumeratedSets()
True
sage: D in InfiniteEnumeratedSets()
True
sage: D.cardinality()
+Infinity
```
 
but your patch will change this!!!

Actually the current code is also already buggy since just checking wether family.last() is infinite or not is not enough!


```
sage: F = Family(range(10), lambda i: ZZ if i==0 else Set([]))
sage: D in FiniteEnumeratedSets()
False
sage: F = Family(range(10), lambda i: ZZ if i==0 else Set([]))
sage: D = DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets(F)
sage: D in FiniteEnumeratedSets()
True
sage: D.cardinality()
+Infinity
```


So a correct implementation should check wether all elements in the union are finite and make a FiniteEnumeratedSet in this case and otherwise make an InfiniteEnumeratedSet

As you say the current implementation is buggy, but this ticket has been sitting here for over a year without any one looking at it, so my motivation for working on this is low -- and in any case I can't at the moment because sage won't compile on my computer due to a skylake issue.
