Attachment

Unfortunately, http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/13533/13533_gcc_not_optional.patch does a lot more than remove "optional - gcc", so this isn't just a rollback.

So, Jeroen changed his mind?

Or will he be happy because of #13540?  (I.e., because those previously optional doctests will then automagically get run -- without having to pass additional parameters to `sage -t ...` -- provided the necessary parts, here GCC, are present and functional?)

P.S.:  Just realized #13540 is already in the dependencies; found it by reading #13533 ... :-)

I got the impression that this was a fine change once #13540 went through, though if anyone has objections they're fine to bring up now.

Although then testing Sage will presumably take longer ;-) , I'm ok with it.  (One should probably be able to explicitly _disable_ such tests.  I personally wouldn't like Sage making "arbitrary" internet connections during build or testing, at least by default, but that's #13884, or #13540.)

I'm pretty sure there are a lot more doctests in Sage which require GCC.

Well, then try testing Sage with some "broken" GCC (e.g. `exit 1` in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc`) to see which ones fail, of course _without_ #13540.  One may have to incrementally add `# optional - gcc` tags to get all of them (and leave out those that are just caused by previous failures)...
