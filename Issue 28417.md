It seems to be related to #17339.

When one tries to fix this, the verification that checks

```
Polyhedron(ieqs=[], ambient_dim=1) == Polyhedron(lines=[[1]])
```

in the class `Hrep2Vrep` in `double_description_inhomogeneous.py` will fail.

#17339 fixed the problem.
Since #17339 is on positive review, this also should be on positive review.
