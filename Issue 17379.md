# Issue 17379: Cleanup in the thematic tutorials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17616

This branch reorders the index of thematic tutorials.

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/

Currently, the hierarchy is not very clear between section/subsections, and very big titles have one or two entries (like "geometry").

This branch flattens it a bit, and reorders it:

- "Programming and Design" is renamed to "Introduction to Sage" (right after 'Introduction to Python')

- 'coding theory' is moved to 'combinatorics' (it had a section of its own before)

- 'Modeling mathematics on a computer' is renamed to 'Parents/Elements, Categories and algebraic structures' (the whole of Sage is about modelling mathematics, from symbolics to graph theory)

- A short table of contents is added in the "categories primer" 
  http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/categories/sage/categories/primer.html

- Same for "group theory"
  http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/group_theory.html#group-theory

- Importantly, all doctests of the "coding theory" tutorial were disabled for they began with "Sage :". I changed that, but there are many broken doctests that I cannot fix myself. I will create another ticket for that.

This mostly looks good to me, but
* what is the reason for changing "new algebraic structures" to "new algebraic structure" in `coercion_and_categories.rst`?
* perhaps it would be worth linking to your follow-up ticket in the broken doctests that you marked with `not tested`

Yooooooooo !

Adding typos make it easier for newcomers to make their first contributions.

I do not understand what change you request.

(I will push a commit in a second to add this 's')

Sorry if I wasn't clear. I committed the change I had in mind.

Oh I see. Well, I don't see anything wrong with that.
