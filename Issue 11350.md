some TeX bracket are missing on the exponent. It should be `i^{m[i]`} instead of `i^m[i]`.

Looks good except for a missing "r" at the triple quotes starting the docstring.  Without the "r", the "\frac" isn't rendered properly for me.  I've attached a new patch which includes all of your changes and also adds the "r".
