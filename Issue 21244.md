CC:  @kevindilks

This contains one minimal code change: `order_polynomial` now uses `as_ideals=False`, which is clearly (but only slightly) faster.

Mostly I just unified wordings from "`self`" to "the poset", make expectations always to be a second paragraph ("The poset is expected to be bounded and ranked.") moved some trivial `EXAMPLES` to `TESTS` and added spaces to examples.

This continues the serie of #18925, #18941, #18959, #19141, #19360, #19435, #21197.
