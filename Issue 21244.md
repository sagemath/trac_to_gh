# Issue 21244: Poset documentation polishing: Polynomials

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jmantysalo

This contains one minimal code change: `order_polynomial` now uses `as_ideals=False`, which is clearly (but only slightly) faster.

Mostly I just unified wordings from "`self`" to "the poset", make expectations always to be a second paragraph ("The poset is expected to be bounded and ranked.") moved some trivial `EXAMPLES` to `TESTS` and added spaces to examples.

This continues the serie of #18925, #18941, #18959, #19141, #19360, #19435, #21197.

Kevin: I think that there is another way to look at `chain_polynomial()`, some vector of poset. That is, something we got with `.chain_polynomial().coefficients()`. I think it should be mentioned, but now I forgot the name. Do you remember it?

Was it related to enumerating linear extensions by enumerating the number of saturated, strict chains in the lattice of order ideals?

polynomial is [SageMath](SageMath)

Found it. It is _f-vector_ of a poset, see for example http://www.lehigh.edu/~mas906/papers/defense.ps. I suppose it is worth mentioning, as the question "What integer sequences are f-vector for some poset?" has got attention, and it seems to be never formulated as "What polynomials can are chain polynomial for some poset?".

Replying to [comment:6 chapoton]:
> polynomial is [SageMath](SageMath)

Thanks. This is now also corrected.
