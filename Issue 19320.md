Implement nth_iterate and orbit functions for morphisms/points of products of projective spaces. Also implement nth_iterate_map for morphisms.

Need to fix the merge issue.

From looking through the commits I see a couple things to fix:

in nth_iterate:
these checks are done in __call__ with better coercion, so not needed here.
        if self.codomain()!=f.domain():
            raise TypeError("Point is not defined over domain of function")

use .is_endomorphism() instead:
        if f.domain() != f.codomain():
            raise TypeError("Domain and Codomain of function not equal")

in nth_iterate_map
use is_endomorphism() check

That all checks out fine. Just one thing: I was wrong about __call__ doing the coercion checking. That is true for projective spaces, but not for products. I think you should put that check back in as some weird behavior can occur.

Go ahead and put that back in, then I'll mark this positive.

Alright, I added the check into orbit as well.
