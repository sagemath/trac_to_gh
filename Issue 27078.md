Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

Moving tickets from the Sage 8.8 milestone that have been actively worked on in the last six months to the next release milestone (optimistically).

not convinced by the use of "isinstance" here:

```
-        if self._parent._base.is_finite() and self._parent._base.characteristic() > 1<<29:
+        if n_GetChar(r) > 1<<29 and isinstance(self._parent._base, FiniteField):
```

Ouchâ€”I don't remember at all why I made this change, but I agree that it looks strange. Thank you.

Ok, I removed the redundant test, let's see if the patchbot complains.

The added import

```
+from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_base cimport FiniteField
```

seems not to be used.

Comment by chapoton created at 2020-01-23 20:17:24

and about the change of "is_monomial", is this really the same ? I mean, does "monomial" mean coefficient 1 ?
