So we really to know the matplotlib version number in `sage-env`?

```sh
# Use a matplotlib config directory specific to Sage and specific to
# the version number of matplotlib, by setting the environment
# variable MPLCONFIGDIR. Note that we can't find the version number by
# importing matplotlib, because that could create matplotlib's standard
# config directory. So we use pkg_resources.
"$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python" -c 'import pkg_resources; pkg_resources.get_distribution("matplotlib").version' 2>/dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    MPLVERSION=`"$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python" -c 'import pkg_resources; print (pkg_resources.get_distribution("matplotlib").version)'`
    MPLCONFIGDIR="$DOT_SAGE/matplotlib-$MPLVERSION"
    export MPLCONFIGDIR
    # The directory is created when Sage starts (see sage.misc.misc).
fi
```


Instead, we could just hardcode a version number, analogous to what we do for Jupyter:

```sh
if [ -z "$IPYTHONDIR" ]; then
    # We hardcode a version number in the directory name. The idea is
    # that we keep using the same version number as long as that is
    # possible. Only when some future IPython version really requires
    # a new structure for the $IPYTHONDIR should this version number be
    # changed to the new IPython version.
    export IPYTHONDIR="$DOT_SAGE/ipython-5.0.0"
fi

if [ -z "$JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR" ]; then
    # We hardcode a version number in the directory name. The idea is
    # that we keep using the same version number as long as that is
    # possible. Only when some future Jupyter version really requires
    # a new structure for the $JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR should this version
    # number be changed to the new jupyter_core version.
    export JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR="$DOT_SAGE/jupyter-4.1"
fi
```

I'm not convinced to use #22652 to change the directory every time. Usually, it is considered a feature that a configuration directory remains in the same place.

That was the reason for hardcoding the Jupyter directories: I have some custom configuration and it's not fun if you need to copy it every time that Jupyter is upgraded in Sage.

Jeroen's point is that it's *not* the same number.  The number in the config directory name is the *last* version at which the format of the configuration for that package changed in a significantly-enough backwards-incompatible way that a new configuration is needed.

For example "jupyter-1.5.0" means "configuration for jupyter-1.5.0 and above".  If jupyter 3.0 comes along and changes the layout of its config directory then we add "jupyter-3.0" for config of jupyter 3.0 and above.

This is as opposed to updating the config dir every time a package is updated (especially onerous when we're talking micro version updates that only contain bug fixes).  The config dirs do not track one-to-one with the version of the package.

This is called madness in my book. I would understand these directory names being independent of the minor version, but having in `~/.sage/blah-1.1.1` configuration for `blah-2.3.4` is crazy.

Let's put it this way: At the very least this ticket is just treating matplotlib's config the way we were already treating jupyter/ipython config, so if nothing else it's consistent.  I think it makes sense to name the config dir after the lowest applicable version supported by Sage, but you could just as well name them ".0", ".1", ".2", etc.  This would be a debate for a separate ticket.
