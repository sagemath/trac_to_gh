Here's an initial patch.

Your patch actually breaks doctesting `sage/doctest/forker.py` because of line number changes.

The patch from 16 hours ago failed doctesting, but the one from 11 hours ago fixed those line numbers, at least for me. Can you make sure you used the right patch?

I guess I didn't, but the ticket was at "needs review" when I tried it :-)

I know, sorry, but then I found the doctest errors and fixed them without saying anything, only posting a new patch.
