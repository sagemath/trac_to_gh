As above. Mercurial tracks file permissions, so there is no reason to modify them after unpacking them, as is done in lines 139-141 of `$SAGE_LOCAL/sage-make_devel_packages`. Right?

Continued from #11449.

`make_devel_package` disappeared with the switch to git (commit 48ff645017639d70d9b4a7107ac7fd98d8a871b5).
