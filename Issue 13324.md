See this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/OnhVtHXgdls)

I've been experiencing some problems with logarithmic scale plots 
since the 'semilogy', 'semilogx' and 'loglog' options had been added. 
  For example, when I use the 'semilogy' plot, I can adjust the 'ymax' 
value, but not 'ymin' value. 'ymin' is always set automatically, and 
not always correctly. 


```
dPhi = 6.02e10 * x**(2.481) * exp(-x / 1.205)
plot(dPhi, 0, 20, scale='semilogy', figsize=(5,4), ymin=1e7, ymax=1e11, xmin=0, xmax=20, frame=True)
```

This does appear to fix these particular problems.  I note that

```
sage: plot_loglog(x, (1.1*10**-2, 9990)) 
sage: plot_loglog(x, (1.1*10**-2, 9990), axes_pad=0) 
```

seem to look the same with or without the patch.  But anyway I think this is a decent solution to this problem.  Does need rebase for a little fuzz but for now I'll set it to sage-pending.
