Keywords: categories, modules, free modules

This is just something I wrote while learning how to use triangular module morphisms. Nothing really changed apart from some asserts replaced by ValueErrors (far from systematically...) and some unneeded declarations and imports removed; however, the doc is IMHO more readable now and the doctests cover some less-obvious cases.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15380

OK, so let's do it manually. 5dd0324 *is* the correct HEAD, but http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=public%2Fticket%2F15380&qt=range&q=develop..public%2Fticket%2F15380 will show the old branch which I accidentally uploaded. Sorry guys.

EDIT: unfortunately, clicking on the "branch" field also gives the crap branch instead of the right one. I'm going to do a manual override and change the "Branch" field...

EDIT2: Here, the new branch at least is correct. Sorry for the mess!!
