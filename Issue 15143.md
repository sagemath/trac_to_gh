# Issue 15143: Improving documentation for triangular module morphisms

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: darij

Original creation time: 2013-11-08 00:52:50

CC:  tscrim hivert

Keywords: categories, modules, free modules

This is just something I wrote while learning how to use triangular module morphisms. Nothing really changed apart from some asserts replaced by ValueErrors (far from systematically...) and some unneeded declarations and imports removed; however, the doc is IMHO more readable now and the doctests cover some less-obvious cases.

Hey Darij,

I pushed some more docfixes, so if you're happy with my changes, then it's a positive review.

Best,

Travis

Thanks, Volker, for spotting these. They come from a ValueError text I "improved", but since it wasn't really an improvement, I've just retracted that. Could I ask you for a little favor? The last commit should be easy to review.

OOPS, that's not the commit I wanted to upload! Sorry!

One moment while I'm trying to push force...

OK, so let's do it manually. 5dd0324 *is* the correct HEAD, but http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=public%2Fticket%2F15380&qt=range&q=develop..public%2Fticket%2F15380 will show the old branch which I accidentally uploaded. Sorry guys.

EDIT: unfortunately, clicking on the "branch" field also gives the crap branch instead of the right one. I'm going to do a manual override and change the "Branch" field...

EDIT2: Here, the new branch at least is correct. Sorry for the mess!!
