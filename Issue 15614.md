Coin does not properly initialise variables before solving,
leading to get_variables() segfaulting if it is called before
solving. The fix is to check that the pointer returned is not
NULL.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15851

other backends return 0, and IMHO it's nice to have this consistent...

Why don't you directly do a `return 0.0`?

I would like to control the type of returned value in Cython. I guess 0.0 might be float
rather than double. I suppose making it return the same type always is a good idea, allowing
for faster compiled code.

Then it looks good to me.
