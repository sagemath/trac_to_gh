CC:  @frederichan-IMJPRG parisse

This ticket should prepare Giac for the status of standard package, where it's required to use tarballs from the official site under http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/debian/dists/stable/main/source/

Up to now patches to the tarballs were added and a new tarball created. These patches will now be added by the usual mechanism, i.e. under `build/pkg/giac/patches`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22011

On fedora 25 amd64 I was able to build sage with

```
export MAKE='make -j3'
make
```

At the end giac was also built. I could run

```
make ptestlong
```
  
then I could run

```
env SAGE_CHECK=yes make giacpy
```

On osx 10.12 I could built sage with make but something was missing psutil:

```
[sagelib-7.5.beta5] sys	0m1.710s
cd ../.. && sage-logger -p './sage --docbuild --no-pdf-links all html ' logs/dochtml.log
[dochtml] /Users/frederichan/dev/sage/local/bin/python: No module named psutil; 'sage_setup.docbuild' is a package and cannot be directly executed
make[2]: *** [doc-html] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
```

so I made

```
make psutil
```

then I could build sage successfully, and giac was built. As it seems unreliated to giac I give a positive review
