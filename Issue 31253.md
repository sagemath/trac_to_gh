I haven't tested it yet, but it looks good to me.

It works on OS X, but it should be carefully checked on Cygwin.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.

All good.

```
[openblas-0.3.13] installing. Log file: /cygdrive/d/a/sage/sage/logs/pkgs/openblas-0.3.13.log
  [openblas-0.3.13] successfully installed.
```

Needs review.

(There is an unrelated build failure with pynac - see #32001).
