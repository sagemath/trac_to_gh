If `terminal_echo=True` (default), then Expect skips the first line when parsing the output. However, the Mathematica interface is started with `stty -echo`, so the first line is not the echoed input, but part of the output, so it must not be skipped.


```
sage: mathematica.eval('Print[1]; Print[2]; Print[3]')
2
3
```


Disabling terminal echo fixes this.

This also fixes a whitespace issue in the prompt.

Tested with Mathematica version 11.3.

I have no way to test, but I will assume that you know what you do.
