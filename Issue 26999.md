# Issue 26999: Memory leak when factoring polynomials through pari

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27236

Original creator: edgarcosta

Original creation time: 2019-02-08 11:27:42

Keywords: factor, pari

When trying to factor some polynomials of degree 32, I observed a PariError, that seems to indicate that some pointers were lost.
Further, given that when can workaround this error by forcing `pari` to do something naive beforehand, I believe that is a memory leak. 
However, I'm not sure if the memory leak is in `pari` or `SAGE`'s integration.

Below follows the code how to recreate, and the work around mentioned above.

PS: Why the hell we raise a NotImplementedError in this situation?!? At least we should pass the original message!

Which version of Sage is this?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-02-08 13:46:38

Never mind, confirmed with 8.7.beta2


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-02-08 13:49:26

Changing priority from major to critical.

Comment by edgarcosta created at 2019-02-08 13:53:58

I reproduced this in 8.3 through 8.6.

Thank for updating my description.
I would like to still point out that if you insert the line

```
R([1] + [0]*14 + [1])._pari_with_name().factor() 
```

before the other factor, then everything works fine.

Replying to [comment:6 edgarcosta]:
> I reproduced this in 8.3 through 8.6.

Thanks for the info.

My feeling is that the method `_pari_with_name()` might be the problem, but I can't tell for sure.

I can no longer reproduce this issue. I don't know what fixed it.

there is still a bug, in  version 8.7.beta6, release date: 2019-03-02.

If you try to take a list of the factors:
