Keywords: species, cycle index

In a 2008 paper (see below), Maia and Méndez define an operation on combinatorial species which they dub the "arithmetic product". This operation corresponds to a nice combinatorial operation: the arithmetic product F⊡G corresponds to the species of "F-assemblies of cloned G-structures", which are structures of the partitional composite species F∘G with the additional requirement that all the G-structures be isomorphic.

As shown in the paper, the cycle index of the arithmetic product F⊡G can be computed in terms of the cycle indices of the species F and G. The attached patch adds code to calculate the result of this operation. It includes a doctest which verifies a nontrivial computation related to the species of "regular octopuses".

The sum_generator method takes finite lists, but they need to represent infinite objects, so it assumes that the last element of the list is meant to repeat. Thus, the zero.

Thanks for the update! I'll have to take a closer look at it.

Meanwhile, are you sure you want those `assert`s in lines 606-607? I don't know what a typical use case of this method should be, but I can imagine applying it in a case where the **base ring** is not discrete (i. e., you cannot check for equality) and these `assert`s will throw a NotImplemented. Think of a lazy power series ring in 2 variables implemented as a lazy power series ring over a lazy power series ring; then the base ring itself is lazy and this stuff breaks. I have a similar issue with your #14543 patch. Maybe add a `check_input=True` keyword which can optionally be set to `False` to avoid these `assert`s?

In other news:


```
sage: L = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)                             
sage: L.sum_generator([L([0]),L([1])]).coefficients(10)       
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
sage: L.sum_generator([L([0]),L([1]),L([0])]).coefficients(10)
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```


I don't think the 1 repeats because it's the last element -- it is not, in the second case. I think it repeats because of the "sum" in "sum_generator". But like you, I don't have a clue what's going on with `sum_generator` really (I actually think I have less of a clue than you do). I'll try to ask around in Orsay...

The explanation shows that it is *not* necessary to pad a sequence with zeroes to use `sum_generators` on it; `sum_generator([a,b])` does precisely the same as `sum_generator([a,b,0])`. But this isn't really relevant to this ticket here. What is correct that `L([a,b])` is *not* the same as `L([a,b,0])`, and the latter syntax is the correct one in most realistic cases. This has nothing to do with `sum_generator`. Sorry for the confusion.

I have added some more info to the docstring and the comments, replaced the arXiv link by the proper syntax for arXiv identifiers (hopefully correctly), improved PEP 8 compliance (it's `def f(n)`, not `def f (n)`), and replaced `n/d` for `n//d` (both do the same when d divides n, but the latter is faster). If you agree with these all, please mark this ticket as positive_review.

Alternately, if you'd be willing to put together a new patch, the correction is simple. The lines


```
    # Build a list which has res in the nth slot and 0's before and after
    # to feed to sum_generator
    res_in_seq = [p.zero()]*n + [res, p.zero()]
            
    return self.parent(res_in_seq)
```


should be replaced by the single line


```
    return self.parent.term(res, n)    
```

You want `self.parent().term`, not `self.parent.term`. The fact that `self.parent(res_in_seq)` works (and is equivalent to `self.parent()(res_in_seq)`) is due to syntactic sugar.

You are correct that `self.parent.term(res, n)` works and makes more sense, but it's also 3 times slower than `self.parent(res_in_seq)` (not sure why), so I'd keep what I've written.

Whoops! This is what I get from trying to write code from a browser after a day of workshops.

How strange! I'll add this to my pile of things to investigate once I get back on my feet. Using `res_in_seq` for this is fine for now, though.

Once again, thanks for the feedback and the review!
