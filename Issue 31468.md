Apparently `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base` is a startup module, which is terrible. I chased it down and it seems one needs to do a series of lazy/more careful imports.

- It starts with `sage/schemes/toric/all.py`, which just imports a everything right away.
- `sage/schemes/toric/variety.py` imports `Cone, is_Cone`. Both of them are only needed twice in the entire module and not even in popular places, it seems. (There are other places where `is_Cone` is just imported in the module, although it is only used in special methods.
- `sage/geometry/all.py` could just do a lot more lazy imports (I think all of them should be lazy).
- `sage/geometry/cone.py` could use a lot more careful imports. E.g. `FinitePoset` is imported, but it is only used for the face lattice. In particular the function `is_Cone` could live without all those imports. If your object isn't a cone, you probably won't need them anyway.

  In particular it imports `is_Polyhedron` in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base`.
- Again `sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` imports a lot of stuff that is definetly not needed for `is_Polyhedron`.

Adding some lazy imports above, I can avoid the import of `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base'.

Do I need a deprecation warning that something as `sage.geometry.cone` won't work anymore without prior loading?
