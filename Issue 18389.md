With the fix I proposed here:
https://github.com/osj1961/guava/pull/2
I see a strange discrepancy between GAP and libGAP.
Namely:
* apply the patch from the pull request to `SAGELOCAL/gap/current/pkg/guava/lib`
* download two attachments to somewhere; 
* start Sage in in there, and `load("l.sage")`
* watch `libgap` succeeding, and `gap` failing...

What is going on, any clues?

Hello Dima,

In this patch you add a block of code with is indented with 3 spaces instead of 4, right before a block of code with a 4-spaces indentation. So you have a 'if' inside of a loop, just because of 1 space. The code seems to behave as intended.

This being said, wouldn't it be better to *not* move this big block of code, and just add this?

```
if gap("Length(matCwt)") <= 0: 
    continue

With a 'continue' you do not have to change the indentation of 10 lines of code only because you want to make an assumption.

And I will start minding 'continue' the day Python will be compiled. A language that stores classes methods in a *dictionary* does not deserve this kind of respect.
