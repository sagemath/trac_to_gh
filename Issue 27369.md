# Issue 27369: Align series expansions in tables

When embedding a series expansion in a table, it's sometimes desirable to align the terms so that, for example, all of the x<sup>2</sup> terms align into the same column.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Please provide an example of desired vs current behaviour.
