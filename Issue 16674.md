Updated to new version with the upstream sagenb changes made to sphinx. The method to check it out is in description.

**Note**: this is not the final version of the sagenb package, since I haven't changed the Changelog, and it doesn't contain the changes from upstream ticket https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/218

Still, I am setting it to needs review so that the package itself can be tested against #16396

Uh... actually that's the reverse: the sphinx upgrade over at #16396 gives failing doctests until sagenb (#16911, here) has been upgraded.
