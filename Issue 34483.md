Keywords: khovanov homology grading

The Khovanov homology of a knot or link is an abelian group equipped with a bigrading. Currently, given a link L if we call Kh = L.khovanov_homology() the output is a dictionary of dictionaries and you can find the (I,j) bigrading by calling Kh[i][j]. I propose that an extra parameter 'output_type' be added to the khovanov_homology method with default value 'dict' so that the current way the function is called remains unchanged, but if 'output_type' is set to 'bigraded', then the output is given as an abelian group equipped with a bigrading.
