In #20885, we are working on a new `Polyhedron` backend class, `Polyhedron_normaliz`

Unfortunately all of the examples in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.library` (such as `polytopes.cross_polytope`) do not allow passing a `backend` parameter, so we can't use them for testing.

Here's a first version. I already added tests on the examples where normaliz can do tests right away.
