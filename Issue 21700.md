In #20885, we are working on a new `Polyhedron` backend class, `Polyhedron_normaliz`

Unfortunately all of the examples in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.library` (such as `polytopes.cross_polytope`) do not allow passing a `backend` parameter, so we can't use them for testing.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21937
