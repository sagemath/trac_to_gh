Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2014-06-25 00:41:40

Keywords: sd59, function fields

Currently, we have the following behaviour

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<y> = K[]     
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2-x)
sage: R.<z> = L[]
sage: M.<z> = L.extension(z-1)
sage: R.<z> = K[]
sage: N.<z> = K.extension(z-1)
sage: N is M
True
```
