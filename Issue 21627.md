From jdemeyer in #9536:

 it would make sense to use $PIP_INSTALL for a few more packages where no extra options are needed: fpylll, gambit, sagenb, sagetex.

I think I originally explicitly excluded those packages because it wasn't clear exactly what the impact would be and I didn't take the time to test it.  There should definitely be a ticket for this though.

- fpylll, sagenb, sagetex - pip install seems to work.
 
 - Gambit: pip install fails because of an upstream problem. The installed header file`libgambit.h` uses `#include <config.h>` but that is not an installed header file.
