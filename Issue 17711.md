# Issue 17711: random_element for QuotientRing

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17948

Original creator: bruno

Original creation time: 2015-03-13 16:18:49

Currently, `QuotientRing_generic` has no method `random_element()`, thus the one of the class `Ring` is used, and only integers coerced into the `QuotientRing` are returned. 

I add such a method, mostly copied from the class `PolynomialQuotientRing_generic`.

Is the cover ring necessarily a polynomial ring, as the docstring suggests?

It's not. And I found a bug while adding a new doctest. See the [sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/nc2-I8ZGW8E). I'll wait for answers to my question before continuing with this ticket. Right now, we have the following error:


```python
sage: R.<x> = QQ[sqrt(2)]
sage: p = x + 1/2
sage: Q = R.quo(p)
sage: Q.random_element()
Traceback (most recent call first):
...
ValueError: reduce only defined for integral ideals
```
