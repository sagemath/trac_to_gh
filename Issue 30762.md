Hello! I got the following error:

```python
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()                                                                                                          
sage: g.hyperbolicity()

TypeError: hyperbolicity() takes at least 1 positional argument (0 given)

```


After looking at other cython files it seems that the problem can be fixed by adding `# cython: binding=True` at the beginning of `hyperbolicity.pyx`. Due to my ignorance about cython I don't know if this is the best fix.

In `graph.py` I would put `hyperbolicity` in the category `Distances` rather than `Graph properties` which is essentially used for functions returning a Boolean (like `is_tree`, `is_apex`, etc.).
