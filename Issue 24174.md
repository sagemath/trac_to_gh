# Issue 24174: Move gamma functions into their own file

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-12-21 08:21:53

`factorial`, `gamma`, `log_gamma`, `gamma_inc`, `gamma_inc_lower`, `beta`, `psi` are enough of the same kind to justify their own file. It eases pressure on the general `other.py` file and makes finding their documentation easier.

You will need to add deprecations saying the import locations have moved (`lazy_import` has an argument to do that). Also, you should add `absolute_import` to the new file's `__future__` import(s). (Personally, I don't like the relative imports as it makes it less explicit, but I don't really care, so don't feel like you need to change/revert.)

Patchbot is (morally) green and this is mostly just a big move ticket. Let's hope this doesn't conflict with anything.
