# Issue 23410: wrong category for parent of composition of number field endomorphisms

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23647

namely

```
sage: K.<a, b> = NumberField([x^2 - 2, x^2 - 3])
sage: e, u, v, w = End(K)
sage: e.abs_hom().parent().category()
Category of homsets of number fields
sage: u.abs_hom().parent().category()
Category of homsets of number fields
sage: v.abs_hom().parent().category()
Category of homsets of number fields
sage: (v*v).abs_hom().parent().category()
Category of homsets of unital magmas and additive unital additive magmas
```

The last one should be the same as the other ones..

Travis, can you help, please ? This prevents from using richcmp for number fields morphisms.

So the problem comes down to this:

```
sage: v.parent() is End(K)
True
sage: v.parent() is Hom(K, K, category=NumberFields())
True
sage: (v*v).parent() == End(K)
True
sage: Hom(K, K, category=Rings()) is End(K)  # The issue
False
sage: Hom(K, K, category=Rings()) is (v*v).parent()
True
```

The source of which, when you go down `_composition_`, comes from this:

```
sage: v.category_for()  # Which calls
Category of rings
sage: v.parent().homset_category()
Category of rings
```

The latter should be `NumberFields()`, not `Rings()` because the subclass

```
sage.rings.number_field.morphism.NumberFieldHomset
```

does not pass `NumberFields()` as its category. However, I tried passing the category of the domain, but this causes failures because `ComplexLazyField` is not a number field and issues with `CyclotomicField` that I don't understand.

Do you have branch for what you tried ?

No, I don't as it didn't work. However, I basically just added this to `number_field/morphism.py`:

```python
class NumberFieldHomset(RingHomset_generic):  # This was already there
    def __init__(self, R, S, category=None):
        if category is None:
            from sage.categories.number_fields import NumberFields
            category = NumberFields()
        RingHomset_generic(self, R, S, category)
```

and the other variant I tried was

```python
    def __init__(self, R, S, category=None):
        if category is None:
            category = R.category()
        RingHomset_generic(self, R, S, category)
```

I have made another try, that causes interesting doctest failures:

```
Failed example:
    G = End(K); G
Expected:
    Automorphism group of Cyclotomic Field of order 12 and degree 4
Got:
    Set of Homomorphisms from Cyclotomic Field of order 12 and degree 4 to Cyclotomic Field of order 12 and degree 4
```


EDIT: ok, ok. This is indeed a group.

in vanilla sage:

```
sage: End(QQ)
Set of Homomorphisms from Rational Field to Rational Field
sage: End(QuadraticField(7))
Automorphism group of Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - 7
sage: End(CyclotomicField(7))
Automorphism group of Cyclotomic Field of order 7 and degree 6
sage: End(UniversalCyclotomicField())
Set of Homomorphisms from Universal Cyclotomic Field to Universal Cyclotomic Field
sage: End(GF(5))
Automorphism group of Finite Field of size 5
```

This does work, but it is a very big hack IMO. I think it might be worth trying to do a more comprehensive fix. At least as a first step, we can put QQ in `NumberFields`: #23761.

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-08-30 21:01:20

I believe `UniversalCyclotomicField()` is not a number field as I believe is an infinite-dimensional field extension of *Q*.

This seems to work (somehow `.__init__` was forgotten in the previous tentatives)

But 
- it does not fix the problem in #23875
- it may behave uncorrectly for morphisms from number fields to rings that are  not fields

Green patchbot. Travis, do you think that this is good enough ?

We could also try to find the best category given the target category..


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-09-19 15:22:33

I think it improves things and is fairly close to a proper (IMO) fix of determining the category directly from the input. We can worry about doing more if this becomes an issue again somewhere else.
