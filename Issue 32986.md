I confirm the new default is better:

```
sage: %timeit E.weierstrass_p(prec=1000, algorithm='fast')
268 ms ± 580 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
sage: %timeit E.weierstrass_p(prec=1000, algorithm='pari')
58.3 ms ± 160 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
sage: %timeit E.weierstrass_p(prec=1000, algorithm='quadratic')
86.4 ms ± 167 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
sage: %timeit E.weierstrass_p(prec=1000)
57.7 ms ± 197 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```


While reviewing, I noticed typos in the documentation:

```
sage: E.weierstrass_p??
```


I suggest to fix as follows:


```diff
-        - ``mprec`` - precision
+        - ``prec`` - precision

-        - ``algorithm`` - string (default:``None``) an algorithm identifier
-                      indicating using the ``pari``, ``fast`` or ``quadratic``
-                      algorithm. If the algorithm is ``None``, then this
-                      function determines the best algorithm to use.

Because for any user that get there, it is force one more step to get the possible values which is very often a question that comes to mind. Also, for normal user, they might just not be able to get to this other method.

In summary, I think it is better to leave it with an explicit list even if the information is doubled.

Thanks for the changes.

I still have some comments with respect to coding conventions in sage with respect to documentation. Sorry if it is troublesome: it is just some details.

The following change

```diff
-        - ``algorithm`` - string (default:``None``) an algorithm identifier
+        - ``algorithm`` -- string or (default) ``None``: an algorithm
```

does not respect the coding convention for the documentation. See https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html To be more precise, please keep `string (default:``None``)` as is (twice).

Also, it would more exact to write 
```'pari'```
```'fast'```
```'quadratic'```
as opposed to 
```pari```
```fast```
```quadratic```. Observe that ```None``` is okay, since it is not about the string ```'None'```.
