I'm currently trying to get a feel of the work involved. Here are some comments and questions. Please correct any wrong assumptions:
- dcoudert already has a Cython implementation (https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32169#comment:40) of computing the edge connectivity of a digraph, but it lacks comments and doctests. Since this work has already been done, there's no need to implement the Round Robin algorithm for edge connectivity stated in Gabow's paper, right?

- Continuing from where dcoudert stopped, work on the second part of the paper about extracting the k-edge-disjoint spanning trees.
- There currently exists an ILP approach for edge-disjoint spanning trees in Sage. Will this be removed or kept for comparison purposes?

Welcome to Sagemath.

I don't think this is the best place to comment the project (email ?), but let me give some answers:
- I will open a ticket as soon as I can with the code I have, and yes, it's best to start from it to develop the second part of the paper (it uses it)
- the ILP formulations will remain for comparison purposes
- Other algorithms can certainly be developed if times allows.
