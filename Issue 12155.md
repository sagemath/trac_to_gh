# Issue 12155: Improve loading page of Mac App

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The current loading page of the Mac App is hideous and not as informative as it could be.  Also the link to `localhost:8000` will soon become `localhost:8080` with the new flask notebook (see #11080).  Both of these should be fixed without remorse.

Let it be so.

More or less all looks ok.  In line 127 we have

```
<p> If the server is already runn
```

but I think HTML will ignore the extra whitespace.  I assume the CSS is all pretty nice; is there a reason not to use default sizes for things like h1, h2, h3?

It's taking too long for the dmg to build, so I'll have to finish the review tomorrow morning.  Also modulo whether port 8080 actually is the new flask port, but #12310 and other references would seem to cover this if I make the new notebook a dependency.  That makes this and #11080 dependencies of each other, but I think that's appropriate.

Unless... what about [comment:84:ticket:11080]?  That's not addressed here, is it addressed elsewhere?  Otherwise you might want to make this still port 8000 so it can get merged and address that where you take care of the other issue.

Yes it should ignore the whitespace.  As to sizes of h1, etc. I just modified some css from sagemath.org so that I would get the colors right and they had changed the sizes.

I think that's probably right.

That's not addressed here, nor elsewhere.  When I finally got 5.0.beta1 to build and tested it, it wasn't a problem.  I'm going to comment on it over there as well now that you reminded me.

Now that I think about it people might run older versions of Sage and then it would be port 8000 anyway.  It would be easy to put 2 links.  I'm not sure it's worth it though since they should never have to click the link, and the server be running on a different port anyway since 8000 or 8080 might have been taken by something else (e.g. `hg serve`).  It's trivial to add it, but I don't want to do it if it means you will have to build the dmg again to review it.  FWIW you can set `SAGE_APP_DMG` to no to avoid building the dmg, though it still takes forever to build the application itself.

I'm not worried about the port; anyone who knows that much and is intentionally using an _older_ (?!) version of Sage is going to know to use another port.  

Ok, then.  It looks great!  The tips are amusing, though hopefully people won't have to go through all of them, and they don't seem to appear _completely_ randomly.

As to building, my understanding is that `SAGE_APP_DMG=no` still builds Sage as a tgz, just not a dmg.  Anyway.

I guess this line has a typo: "Sometimes that best way to solve find a bug is to explain it to a rubber duck "

Is this because it's waiting on #11080?  Just clarifying - that would certainly make sense.

Unmerging this from sage-5.2 due to the serious security issue at #13270.
