# Issue 21582: Symbolical erfc() implementation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2016-11-04 14:30:00

People need to manipulate statistical distribution functions as in https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35407/use-cumulative-distribution-functions/ 
To provide the means a symbolical version of `erfc` is necessary. The current `error_fcn()` is only numerical.

The name `error_fcn` is nonstandard. I think it should be deprecated with an appropriate warning.

A couple minor things in the documentation in `error.py`:

1) One LaTeX instance of `\text` should be `\operatorname`

2) Five instances of code markdown in the AUTHORS section need double back ticks instead of single.

In `error.py`, there is no reason to deprecate `error_fcn` there. I would do that in the original location. You should also have `lazy_imports` deprecations that redirect to the new location.

Do you have an idea why the patchbot's startup_modules plugin still triggers?

I tried but I don't think `lazy_import`'s deprecation arg does what I think you're trying to do.

I was going to try, but then I felt lazy and the current version works just fine. I made a few documentation tweaks. If my changes are good with you, then you can set a positive review.

Looks good and tests in `functions` are fine. Thanks for the help with this.
