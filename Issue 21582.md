The name `error_fcn` is nonstandard. I think it should be deprecated with an appropriate warning.

A couple minor things in the documentation in `error.py`:

1) One LaTeX instance of `\text` should be `\operatorname`

2) Five instances of code markdown in the AUTHORS section need double back ticks instead of single.
