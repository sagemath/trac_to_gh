It's _Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno_ not _Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno*n*_.

The attached patch also removes trailing white spaces and uses a python3 compatible syntax to raise errors.

Please no unnecessary whitespace changes. This only serves to break other people's patches.

I removed the whitespace changes. Let's hope we get rid of the trailing whitespaces when moving to git.

The `%`-operator is deprecated in py3, so I guess we are not fully compliant. But its better than before ;-)
