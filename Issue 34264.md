I would say yes. At least it is on the same footing with respect to `VectoFieldFreeModule` as `FiniteRankDualFreeModule` is with respect to `FiniteRankFreeModule`.

LGTM. 
In the main docstring of `diff_form_module.py` it would be nice to add that the specific case p=1 of M parallelizable is implemented via `VectorFieldDualFreeModule`. 
You may also want to update the `AUTHORS` field.

Thanks for the changes and sorry for the delay in the feedback. Just one typo in the docstring of `DiffFormFreeModule`:

```diff
-   For the special case of `-forms, use the class :class:`VectorFieldDualFreeModule`.
+   For the special case of `1-forms, use the class :class:`VectorFieldDualFreeModule`.
