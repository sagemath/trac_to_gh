# Issue 20461: Revise initialization of generic algebraic curves

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20698

Revise the Curve function used for initializing generic algebraic curves to allow passing an ambient space in which to construct the curve. Also modify how the curve function works when passing in a subscheme so the ambient space of that subscheme is used instead of creating a new one.

Additionally, implement curve functions for affine/projective space for initializing curves in those ambient spaces.

Just a couple things here:

In the docs

- doc build error


```
OSError: [plane_cur] /home/ben/sage/sage-dev/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/schemes/plane_curves/constructor.py:docstring of sage.schemes.plane_curves.constructor.Curve:16: ERROR: Unexpected indentation.
```


- also variables names should be in double quote, single quote are for math type setting

also some issues with the error messsages

- Your raise is failing

```
A.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
X=A.subscheme([x^3 + y^3 + z^3,x-y])
C = Curve(X);C
```


- the line wrap messed up the spacing


```
A.<x,y,z> = AffineSpace(QQ,3)
A2.<u,v,w,t>=AffineSpace(QQ,4)
C = Curve(x^3 + y^3 + z^3,A2);C
```


I didn't encounter any functionality issues.

Thanks, the issues should be resolved now.

well, the docs compile, but the formatting isn't right.

- affine_space/curve
- projective_space/curve
- constructor/curve

take a look at the inputs.

Oops, sorry. I changed the spacing and indentation, and the docs look better now.
