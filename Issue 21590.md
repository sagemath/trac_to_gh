Two minor things:
- Use `.. MATH::` as we are trying to be consistent with the dev guide.
- I think "QQbar" should either be ```QQbar``` or the corresponding latex version.

Once fixed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

I just noticed that you neither do detection of `flint` in `configure` or link to the `flint` library. Meaning that `libpynac.so` is actually underlinked. This may prove a problem for people using `--as-needed` in their `LDFLAGS` and the gold linker. See #20646 for a  discussion of a similar situation. 

The ticket is good to go for now but I will consider making a PR to solve these issues in 0.7.1.
