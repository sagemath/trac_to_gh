See [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/evIMO7NEFNc/5zG5gETvAAAJ](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/evIMO7NEFNc/5zG5gETvAAAJ). As reported there:

```
sage: BooleanFunction([0]).algebraic_normal_form()
ValueError: Number of variables must be greater than 1.
```

because PolyBoRi doesn't like polynomial rings in 0 variables (the doc of PolyBoRi seems a little pessimistic: it also excludes one variable, but that seems to be handled fine in practice)

One solution would be to just return the corresponding constant in GF(2).

Returning not a polynomial but the GF(2) element might cause unexpected errors, where code relies on methods offered by the polynomial class (e.g. `degree()`).
