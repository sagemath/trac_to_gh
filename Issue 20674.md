I'm not sure why this is useful.  sage-the-distribution should contain only Python 2, or only Python 3, but not both.  In either case `pip` is `pip`, and will use the correct Python.

Unless we *do* want to switch to allowing both Python 2 and Python 3.

Note you can also do `sage -python -m 'pip'` to invoke pip.  So I don't think this is needed really.
