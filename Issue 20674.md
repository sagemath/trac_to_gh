We have

sage -pip

but it may be useful for the py3 transition to also have

sage -pip3

I'm not sure why this is useful.  sage-the-distribution should contain only Python 2, or only Python 3, but not both.  In either case `pip` is `pip`, and will use the correct Python.

Unless we _do_ want to switch to allowing both Python 2 and Python 3.

Note you can also do `sage -python -m 'pip'` to invoke pip.  So I don't think this is needed really.

ok, then let us close this as invalid. Sorry for the noise.

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
