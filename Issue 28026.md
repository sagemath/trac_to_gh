Please use "Return" and not "Returns".


Also, what is this piece of code doing ? Only the last line is used...

```
+        polys = self._polys
+        max_degree = 0
+        for poly in polys:
+            if poly.degree() > max_degree:
+                max_degree = poly.degree()
+        return self.as_scheme_morphism().degree()
```

I thought I had deleted that code. It's gone now.

This code works fine for polynomials, but affine maps can be rational...


```
A.<x,y>=AffineSpace(QQ,2)
f=DynamicalSystem_affine([x,y/(1+x^2)])
f.degree()
```

Looks good.

Tests pass and docs build.
