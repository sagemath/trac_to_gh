# Issue 21412: Doctest continuation marker / groups

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21649

Original creator: jmantysalo

Every grepping of source code is easier if there is just one way to do something. Also some user might wonder if there is a difference between `...` and `....:`. Hence I suggest mass change from old-style doctest continuation lines.

This part does that in groups folder.

Done by


```
find src/sage/groups/ -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' | xargs perl -e 's|^( *)\.\.\.  |\1....:|g;' -p -i.bak
```
