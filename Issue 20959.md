The branch attempts to upgrade the autotools versions. Building currently fails because libtool 2.4.3's patches against gnulib stuff do not apply cleanly when gnulib is too new.

Did you ever find a workaround to the issue of libtool 2.4.3 and gnulib?  I have an idea for that that I'm testing now.

Here's my idea--it worked for me.  The idea is that there is an optional gnulib version appended to the libtool version (with a `+`).  If given, it will check out that tag from the gnulib repo before building (otherwise it defaults to the master branch, which worked for all but libtool 2.4.3 anyways).

I admit the syntax is a bit awkward and am open to other ideas.  I just didn't want to hard-code a special case *just* for this version (though that might be acceptable as well given that it ended up being the only one affected AFAICT).

"all of them" = all versions or all currently failing versions?

which gnullib version would you want to use?

I propose to make autotools experimental and drop it some day. I don't think we should put too much effort into upgrading this.

If somebody else wants to take over with the upgrade (and has a system where this actually builds) they should feel free to take over of course :)
