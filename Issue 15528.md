The PARI package in Sage contains two databases (`galdata` and `seadata-small`). These should be separated and the packaging simplified.

We already have a `pari-2.5.5.tar.bz2` tarball. Since it is checksummed we can't replace it without breaking other builds. This shoud be done in conjuction with the next Pari update.

Since it will simplify the next upgrade, why not simply rename the tarball to something else? Can we call it `pari-2.5.5b.tar.bz2` or something?

That would work, too. But you can simplify the next upgrade just as well by starting with this branch.

But less so, since the probability of merge conflicts (I just resolved one) increases the longer that this branch does not get merged. And other people who want to work on PARI might not know about this ticket.

I did notice that the new `pari-2.5.5.tar.bz2` had the same name but a different checksum, but didn't run into problems because I downloaded the new one by hand before checking out this branch.  Should have tried harder to play the unsuspecting user... 8-)
