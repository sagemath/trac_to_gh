Two things: `__classcall_private__` needs a doctest:

```
sage: Necklaces([2,1,1]) is Necklaces(Composition([2,1,1]))
True
```

I think you should just (attempt to) convert into a `Composition` when `content` is not a `Composition`.

Also, I was told at some point that it is better to have `UniqueRepresentation` be before `Parent`, but I don't remember precisely why (and don't feel like you have to change it).
