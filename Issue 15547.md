# Issue 15547: Use `in` instead of deprecated `has_key()`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15784

Original creator: aapitzsch

Original creation time: 2014-02-03 22:15:17

Keywords: python3

The *dict.has_key()* is not supported in Python 3.0, in favor of the `key in d` idiom which was introduced in 2.2. [Formal deprecation](http://docs.pythonsprints.com/python3_porting/py-porting.html#replacing-dict-has-key) of *dict.has_key()* began in 2.6.

Hey Andr√© I am willing to review this as I am in debt for the review of the patch bomb that brought python 2.7 in sage. Did you use a script to automate this or was it a long labor in between between grep?

Hallo, I started with _2to3_. But this had some problems with pyx files. So I used _grep_ to find the remaining `has_key()`.

OK I also saw the removal of comments and other stuff. Do you consider this finished or you are tracking more instances?

There are two more `has_key`. One in _misc/cachefunc.pyx_ which I don't know how to handle and one in _sets/family.py_ which behaves different from the also included `__contains__`, so I skipped this as well. These can be fixed in another ticket (if necessary).

Patchbot seem happy enough about this ticket as far as I can see. Unless I don't know how to read the output.
