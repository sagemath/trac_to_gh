# Issue 29660: database_stein_watkins_mini installation is broken

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29897

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2020-06-19 04:54:49

This packages `spkg-install.in` contains only

```
# Use spkg-install file of database_stein_watkins
. "$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/database_stein_watkins/spkg-install"
```

There is no such `spkg-install` file, so replace this whole file with a symlink to `database_stein_watkins/spkg-install.in`.
