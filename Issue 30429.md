Good idea to separate this into a new ticket.

While working on #30371, I noticed that most cython files using singular cannot be compiled without pynac. So maybe these should be combined.

Also, I think, there should be distributions for GAP, CCObject, linbox, ratpoints, zn_poly and mari.

What do you think about renaming sage_setup: distribution to sage_setup: dependency? I think this better reflects the purpose. The distribution is then generated based on which dependencies are available. Another idea would be to use `distutils: libraries` which already contains some of the dependencies anyway (e.g. arb, gmp, flint).

I think they should be separate because I really want to be able to make singular optional. pynac, on the other hand, is essential for our symbolics implementation.

Yes, please add to the list in the ticket description with explanation (what is CCObject?)

> What do you think about renaming sage_setup: distribution to sage_setup: dependency?

No, I wouldn't like that. As soon as you start with declaring "dependencies", there will be combinatorial explosion from the combinations of such dependencies. I really want a well-designed partition of the source files into (relatively few) disjoint distributions. This is crucial for the modularization -- each distribution will eventually be separately compilable and installable package on PyPI.

Ok, makes sense.
Which distribution should be assigned to files that have two dependencies (e.g use pynac and singular)?

My idea was that the cython file declares which dependencies it has, and in the setup.py file you have a list of distributions and their dependencies. If all dependencies are met, that particular distribution is built. E.g. distribution "sage-singular" relies on "pynac" and "singular". (That's only a feeling, but it feels strange to have distributions determined by dependencies and not by a theme or subject, e.g. "sage-singular" vs "sage-symbolic calculation". But you have a better overview, so I trust you there.)

I've added the above distributions to the list.

Perhaps, but there is actually an important "political" (open source community) reason for this design too. By naming these components after major libraries that provide the features, we make these libraries and their important role for Sage more visible to end users. Attribution tends to be an important motivating factor to developers of these libraries.

When I wrote this, I didn't recall that singular's `libfactory` is actually a dependency of pynac. So I think you are right, it's best to have pynac and singular in one distribution (for now, at least).
