not sure whether these can be ignored.

This is more or less a duplicate of #20324. If you want, we could fix the Cython issue without fixing `add_variable` more generally. But #20324 has bigger plans for fixing `add_variable` which should also fix the Cython warnings.

Do you plan to fix this? If not, we might as well let it be and hope that somebody will address it in #20324.
