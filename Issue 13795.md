# Issue 13795: Ideal membership for univariate polynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13999

Original creator: hivert

Keywords: Ideal, univariate polynomial


```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: p, q = 4 + 3*x + x^2, 1 + x^2
sage: I = R.ideal([p, q])
sage: S = R.quotient_ring(I)
sage: S(p) == S(0)
False
```

This is plain wrong !

```
sage: p in I

I left a todo in #12510 deactivating some generic tests (`TestSuite`) in

```
sage/rings/quotient_ring.py
```

Those generic test should be reinstated when this ticket is fixed.
