# Issue 22533: Fix functools32 spkg-install

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22770

Original creator: jhpalmieri

The spkg-install script for functools32 uses `-n` for a `not` operator`; it should instead use `!`.

The proposed change in #22582 is better, especially since we now install both python 2 and python 3 by default. Here is a branch with just that change, or we can see if #22582 gets positively reviewed, in which case this will be a duplicate.

This is from Volker's branch at #22582, and I am willing to give it a positive review, plus Frédéric positively reviewed this change before.
