Usage of `list` in\\
`zipped_coords = list(zip(*self))` in *src/sage/combinat/tiling.py* and in\\
`Slist = list(zip([g.ideal() for g in C.gens()], C.invariants()))` in *src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py* seems unnecessary.

In both cases, it is necessary, because one can use an iterator only once.
And we need it twice.
