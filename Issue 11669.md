It only determines lattices, , in fact, if the "new basis" element doesn't give an integral lattice, and error message is raised.  So this best fix would be changing the ticket name to "Generates Quadratic Lattice."

I'm having a hard time understanding what this means:

```
Determines the quadratic lattice spanned by the vectors in `L`
with the same underlying quadratic space as the lattice given.
```

especially because the output is a quadratic form and not a lattice.
