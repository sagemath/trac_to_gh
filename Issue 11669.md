This function take a list of vectors, L, and a quadratic Lattice, M.  It returns a new lattice with the underlying space QQM but spanned by the vectors L.

The patch bilinear_map.patch comes from the ticket #11863. So, I have listed that as a dependency for the patch for the convenience of the reviewers.

There is a little confusion in the description -- should you say: determines the quadratic form and not lattice?

It only determines lattices, , in fact, if the "new basis" element doesn't give an integral lattice, and error message is raised.  So this best fix would be changing the ticket name to "Generates Quadratic Lattice."

I'm having a hard time understanding what this means:

```
Determines the quadratic lattice spanned by the vectors in `L`
with the same underlying quadratic space as the lattice given.
```

especially because the output is a quadratic form and not a lattice.

```
sage: QuadraticForm(matrix(ZZ,2,[2,1,1,2]))
Quadratic form in 2 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients: 
[ 1 1 ]
[ * 1 ]
sage: qf = QuadraticForm(matrix(ZZ,2,[2,1,1,2]))
sage: matrix(ZZ,2,[1,1,0,1])
[1 1]
[0 1]
sage: t = matrix(ZZ,2,[1,1,0,1])
sage: qf(t)
Quadratic form in 2 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients: 
[ 1 3 ]
[ * 3 ]
```

The functionality already exists.
