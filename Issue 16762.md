Hey Robert, I also made a few very small such typo fixes as 'experimental' gh pull requests... but can Volker merge them here?  Or do you think we'll have to also make a "native" Sage branch on Trac?  Maybe cherry-picking or something?

My release management scripts assume that the trac ticket fields are filled out (including author/reviewer name, description, and branch)...

Hopefully all set!  But there needs to be a way to automate this too.
