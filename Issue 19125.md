Yes, there are way too many re-implementations of this in Sage. My eventual goal is to replace all "real/complex root refining" code in Sage by this new `refine_root()` function. But I'm not there yet...

You probably know that, but just in case: it is not strictly true that you cannot use the interval Newton method and must switch to bisection when the slope interval contains zero. Another option is to interpret 1/[-a,b] as a kind of ”projective interval” containing ∞ (which gives rise to two disjoint complex intervals after intersecting with the previous estimate, so you'll still need to deal with several pieces).

IMHO, `refine_root` is a bad name. I would expect such function to refine an interval that is already known to contain a (possibly unique) root... What about `isolating_interval_from_approximate_root` or something similar?

On the other hand, there are some possible alternative in the real case that does not involve convergence of Newton algorithm (and might already be implemented elsewhere). Namely `p` has a unique root in an interval `[a, b]` if the following holds:
1. the sign of `sgn(p(a)) * sgn(p(b)) = -1`
2. the interval `p'([a,b])` does not contain zero
It is also possible to replace 2 with Descartes rules of sign (which is a more expensive).
