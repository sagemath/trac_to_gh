Yes, I am outsourcing of course. The point is of course to apply the matrix to other potential polytopes as it was the idea behind the problem that led to this ticket.

Further, it is an "unfair" comparison, since `minimal=True` **does** **more**, since it really computes the minimal polynomial (which is not done for polytopes if I am not mistaken, you might disagree here, it has been a while).

But cool that it seems to be a bit faster for larger stuff. :)

Could you perhaps fix this:

```
-found 0 pyflakes errors in the modified files
+src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py:4793:17 local variable 'R' is assigned to but never used
```


Instead of adopting this syntax

```
+        - ``minimal`` (boolean, default = False) --
```

I would propse changing `affine_hull_projection` to standard syntax.

Forgot spaces:

```diff
-                    new_ring = number_field_elements_from_algebraics(A.list(),embedded=True,minimal=True)[0]
+                    new_ring = number_field_elements_from_algebraics(A.list(), embedded=True, minimal=True)[0]
```


Also the previous is a super long line. Maybe you can change this along with

```
 return linear_transformation(matrix(self.base_ring(), self.dim(), self.dim(), self.base_ring().one())), self.ambient_space().zero()
```
