Désolé Frederic, I found some more (mistake in my regexp) at the same time you reviewed.  And now I have more questions:

* I didn't fix those in `pyx` files, is that OK or should I fix those, too?

* There are several occurrences of the same pattern with `TESTS:`, but I don't see any consequences.  Should I fix them, too?

OK, I just saw that the ones in `pyx` files need to be fixed, too.

I think I'm done.

(the failure in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.library.Polytopes.icosahedron` does not occur on my computer and should be unrelated)

OMG, such a patchbomb now... What did you do ??? Why all these whitespace changes ?? Why all these splitting of EXAMPLES lines ???

This is a wrong change (and this happens several times)

```
-        r"""
-        Return the index of this polytope in the internal database of 2- or
+        r"""Return the index of this polytope in the internal database of 2- or
```

I'm sorry, I guess this was stupid.

I figured that at least some of the bad `EXAMPLES:` blocks messed up the documentation, and I thought that `EXAMPLES: (some text)` was not correct.  And my editor did the rest :-(

So, I guess it's best if I undo all changes except those `EXAMPLES:` -> `EXAMPLES::` which are appropriate?

If you prefer, I could also undo commit ​2dd1dfd	which concerns the modfications in `src.sage.libs`, which probably don't show up in the documentation anyway.

Instead of undoing bad changes, better just squash the patch to one commit. Otherwise it will break `git blame`.

done!

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-01-07 08:30:20

In `ntl_ZZ_pEX.pyx`, you have one `EXAMPLES::` _without_ an indented block. That's very bad as it will break docbuilding.

Also, I don't think that this is correct:

```
            sage: f.left_shift(5)
            [[] [] [] [] [] [3 2] [1 2] [1 2]]

            A negative left shift is a right shift.
            sage: f.left_shift(-2)
            [[1 2]]
```

(this "A negative..." occurs twice like this)

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-01-07 08:35:12

The double indentation in `src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx` (which already existed before, not blaming you) is also wrong. It should be

```
EXAMPLES:
 
A simple example::
 
    sage: from sage.doctest.fixtures import reproducible_repr
```

Retarging tickets optimistically to the next milestone.  If you are responsible for this ticket (either its reporter or owner) and don't believe you are likely to complete this ticket before the next release (8.7) please retarget this ticket's milestone to sage-pending or sage-wishlist.
