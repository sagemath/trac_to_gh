Hello,

Hello,

once the bot is green again, and if you agree with my review patch, you can set a positive review

OK, this one goes in first, then! Rebase the rest of stuff pending in `age/graphs/generators/smallgraphs.py`.

Hello guys ! I improved my drawing scripts and ended up finding two nice layouts for these graphs. I hope that you will not mind my setting this ticket back to "needs_review", if only for a very short patch `:-)`
