80 columns mode

```diff
+    If ``act_to_right`` is ``False``, the group `G \rtimes H` is specified by a homomorphism `\psi\in \mathrm{Hom}(H,\mathrm{Aut}(G))`
```


This line could also be reformatted

```diff
+        return GroupSemidirectProduct(self.cartesian_factors()[1], self.cartesian_factors()[0], twist=self._twist, act_to_right=not self.act_to_right(), prefix0=self._prefix1, prefix1=self._prefix0, print_tuple=self._print_tuple, category=self._category)
```

The last commit (`6768cb8`) accidentally removed a space
between ```H``` and `using`:


```diff
-    Return the semidirect product of the groups ``G`` and ``H`` using the homomorphism ``twist``.
+    Return the semidirect product of the groups ``G`` and ``H``using the homomorphism ``twist``.
```


Please restore it (in a follow-up if this is already being merged by Volker).

And maybe wrap this:

```diff
             if x in CommutativeAdditiveGroups():
-                error = error + ". Please change the commutative additive group %s into a multiplicative group using the functor sage.groups.group_exp.GroupExp" % x
+                error += (". Please change the commutative additive group "
                           f"{x} into a multiplicative group using the "
                           "functor 'sage.groups.group_exp.GroupExp'")
             raise TypeError(error)
```
