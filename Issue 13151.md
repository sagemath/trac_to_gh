Assignee: tbd

The latest release package is docutils-0.9.1.tgz. It was released on 2012-06-17.

The actual docutils version in Sage (since 4.7.1 #10166) is 0.7 released on 2009-10-11 

One should make sure to avoid the problem fixed at #11660 (docutils files not world-readable).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13323

A new spkg version is here :

I still haven't build sage from source with this new package. I will change the status to needs review once I did it.

Ok, it is not so easy. Sage compiles fine. But, Sphinx v1.1.2 has trouble building the documentation with the version 0.9.1 of docutils. Here is a part of `dochtml.log` :
