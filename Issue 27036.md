Presently SymmetricGroupRepresentation and SymmetricGroupAlgebra can only be found either by googling or by looking through the combinat's module index. 

By right they should be better visible, and SymmetricGroupRepresentation should be cross-linked in Groups docs.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
