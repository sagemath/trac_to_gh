While packaging sage for nixos, I needed to configure some paths in addition to the already provided environment variables. Specifically I added `COMBINATORIAL_DESIGN_DATA_DIR`, `CREMONA_MINI_DATA_DIR`, `CREMONA_LARGE_DATA_DIR`, `JMOL_DIR`, `JSMOL_DIR`, `MATHJAX_DIR` and`THREEJS_DIR`.

I think those changes should be included in the sage distribution.

gh-timokau, nice work. It'd be great to have more of these things configurable.

I wonder what should be the general approach here. I guess it would be good to have an example that we can follow in the future for other SPGKs:

Should some things be set at `./configure`-time and not be modifiable through environment variables? What should be configurable through environment variables? How should these be named? Should they all be `SAGE_*`? Or are they sufficiently general that it makes sense to drop the `SAGE_` prefix?

For the nix package I stopped using `make` and `./configure` altogether. Currently they (especially the makefile) just complicate things and provide little value if you want to use system packages.

If the configure script would be able to *reliably* determine these values, that'd be nice. Especially if you could then run sage without importing a shell file (and thus using it as a normal python package). I know `env.py` is intended for this, but that doesn't work as soon as some pats are non-standard.

For now I picked the least intrusive way to be able to package sage with as little patching as possible.

There are  a couple of instances that are glaring to me because 
 1) I provide my own minimal `sage-env` and anything that isn't useful has been thrown out. That includes `GP_DATA_DIR` and `SINGULARPATH`. Never used that before.\\

 2) I don't include it in the default environment.

When working on `env.py` we basically reduced the use of `os.environ` to what was strictly necessary.
So in the extra work I had on my plate
* GAP_BINARY, you changed what to find to something different. gap is admittedly not a particularly well packaged software but using the gap in PATH was good for me.
* MAXIMA_FAS, you actually introduce a more stringent check here. The issue is clearly on Gentoo side in some ways but it introduce the always problematic use of `lib` when on distro it could be `lib64` (there is not a really good solution to that particular one so let it live).

It only uses ECLDIR as a default for MAXIMA_FAS, so your issue is actually with MAXIMA_FAS right?

Since our ecl is installed to a versioned subdir of /usr/lib (which is the default upstream behavior, the /usr/lib/ecl symlink is Sage specific), we are forced to keep track of the ecl version in the Sage build script, and update and rebuild the package for every single ecl version bump.

Can't you just use a shell glob for the version, or are you using multiple maxima versions at the same time?

We could revert to the old behaviour in case MAXIMA_FAS and ECLDIR are both unset. Unfortunately I wont be able to implement that myself, because I dislocated my shoulder. Typing with one hand is no fun, let alone coding.

What do you mean by this? ecl doesn't accept glob in the path of 'require'

The problem is that 'unsetting' it now requires more patching, since you're also setting it in env.py. From my POW this is a step backwards in both
- making sage work with unpatched dependencies (since it relies on the sage-specific /usr/lib/ecl path)
- making sage more distribution-friendly (since it requires more patching to make it work with distro packages)

Anyway, I've opened #26100 with a proposed simple solution
