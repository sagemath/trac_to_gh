To make the logic in `src/setup.py` easier, we should just symlink the numpy includes (which are in `local/lib/python/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy` to `local/include/numpy`.

It always felt strange that there isn't a way to get to the numpy include location from numpy itself. Is it just because we are ignorant? If not it seems to be a case of something missing to me.

Of course with sage you can afford the short-cut to `local/include` I cannot when I can numpy installed for various versions of python. I'd like to see if numpy provides a mechanism first.

`numpy.get_include()` is what we are after.

FranÃ§ois, I don't quite understand what you're trying to say. Are you saying that it's a bad idea to symlink numpy's headers in `$SAGE_LOCAL/include/numpy`?

Does the Python version even matter for the C includes of `numpy`?

The only python packages that I know have headers and install under `include` are
* python itself under python$version
* pynac (python 2.7 only)
* polybori (python 2.7 only)

Apart from numpy and cython I cannot think of any other python packages that install headers and those two definitely don't do it under `$prefix/include`. Because some of the headers in these can depend on the version of python I don't think it will happen anytime soon.

After inspection of my system I got one header that is shared between version of python under `/usr/include`: `pygobject/pygobject.h`. There is only one switch inside that depends on the version of python used if I read the thing correctly. So it can be done.

Anyway the patch looks very good to me and it get the right head counts of `numpy_depends` (26) in `module_list.py`. 

The only thing you forgot is that bit of code in `sage/misc/cython.py`

```
include_dirs = [os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL,'include','csage'),
                os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL,'include'), \
                os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL,'include','python'+platform.python_version().rsplit('.', 1)[0]), \
                os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL,'lib','python','site-packages','numpy','core','include'), \
                os.path.join(SAGE_SRC,'sage','ext'), \
                os.path.join(SAGE_SRC), \
                os.path.join(SAGE_SRC,'sage','gsl')]
