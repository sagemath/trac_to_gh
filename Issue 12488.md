```
sage: R.<x> = GF(5)[]
sage: (1+x)^(5^2)
x^25 + 1
sage: (1+x)^(5^3)     # 
x^125 + 1
sage: f = (x+1)^(5^8)
sage: f = (x+1)^(5^9)
sage: f = (x+1)^(5^10)    # quite slow
sage: f

One could similarly optimize multivariate polynomial powering.

This seems duplicate of #7253. Should maybe close one of the tickets.

I put a positive review to close this ticket since #7253 has the exact same purpose.
