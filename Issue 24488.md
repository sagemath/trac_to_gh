Power poset is meet-semilattice, of course -- meet of elements is the "intersection" of posets.

Ok, looks good. Is this poset selfdual, or not ?

Is the `PowerPoset` the same as the picture on page 8 of 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07995.pdf

?

No, this is different thing. Elements of this poset are posets. The bottom element is the antichain on elements `1..n` (actually `0..n-1`), and maximal elements are all `n!` chains.

Wouldn't it be good to add a line to the doc explaining why it is a semilattice?

It would.

Volker doesn't like modifying tickets already in positive review, so I will combine this with some other changes.
