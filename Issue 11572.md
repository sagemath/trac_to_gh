Cygwin fails on the new file introduced in #9180.  We need 

```
libraries = ['gmp']
```

in that extension in `module_list.py` for this to build properly.

My pleasure - it was nice to find something I could actually fix for once!    Thanks to Mike having shown me the way at Days 31 on a similar ticket.

You can make it up by reviewing #11119, which should be *very* easy to finish off :)  Or even by checking that the links in #11245 are hard (should be enough to finish the review), and/or checking the spkg construction in #11497, etc.  It would be *so* nice to just be able to type "make" and only have to fix the build at Maxima.  Then we just have to figure out #11551 and #9167...  not to mention that now my Win 7 computer fails at importing sage.misc.random, before it even gets to initializing I, which is new to me...
