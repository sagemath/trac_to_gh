# Issue 11572: Add library gmp needed for real interval absolute

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11744

Cygwin fails on the new file introduced in #9180.  We need 

```
libraries = ['gmp']
```

in that extension in `module_list.py` for this to build properly.

Ready for review!  I guess we COULD wait until someone actually tests this on Cygwin, or perhaps the author of #9180 could confirm that gmpz things need to be defined for said pyx file to compile properly.  Anyway, ready for review :)

From the code at #9180, it's clear that it requires GMP.  Looks good to me.

My pleasure - it was nice to find something I could actually fix for once!    Thanks to Mike having shown me the way at Days 31 on a similar ticket.

You can make it up by reviewing #11119, which should be _very_ easy to finish off :)  Or even by checking that the links in #11245 are hard (should be enough to finish the review), and/or checking the spkg construction in #11497, etc.  It would be _so_ nice to just be able to type "make" and only have to fix the build at Maxima.  Then we just have to figure out #11551 and #9167...  not to mention that now my Win 7 computer fails at importing sage.misc.random, before it even gets to initializing I, which is new to me...
