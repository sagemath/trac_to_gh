I have to check it more carefully, but in principle it looks good.

How does libgap handle memory session limit now? Are we still limited by some -o option?

Its still a fixed memory pool, with details of the size depending on whats available at startup.

GAP always used an arbitrary limit for the number of cosets, and never filled all available memory. Whether or not you hit the coset limit depends on if `4096000` cosets fit RAM or not.

I have tested it, and the result is that the sage session quits.

That should be the same behavior as without the patch, if GAP runs out of memory then it aborts (we should probably catch that, but its unrelated to this ticket).

Can you try a smaller limit?

It seems to work fine with smaller limits. Maybe there should be a smaller default limit? I think it is preferable that the default behaviour is to raise an error than to crash the session.
