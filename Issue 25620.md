On Cygwin I tried doing `./sage -f mpir` and everything broke.

This is because my C compiler uses mpc and mpfr, and on Cygwin (see #25816) at least, it ends up using Sage's mpc and mpfr DLLs.  This may be less of a problem on other platforms but I haven't given much thought to it yet.

The mpc and mpfr DLLs in Sage break when Sage's mpir gets uninstalled, so it's necessary *at a minimum* to also uninstall mpc and mpfr.  But at that point it might also make sense to recursively uninstall *anything* that depends on mpir.  This seems reasonable given that they'll have to be re-built anyways.

Can you give more details :-)

I disagree with your solution: it just needs to reorder the operations from

1. Uninstall
2. Build
3. Install

to

1. Build
2. Uninstall
3. Install

That shouldn't break anything.

If this is not easy to fix, maybe we should just disable the uninstall feature for now?

I think I did in the description.  By "everything" I mean that as soon as mpir's configure tries to detect a C compiler, gcc breaks because it's loading DLLs from `$SAGE_LOCAL` (ugh), and those DLLs are in turn compiled against the mpir from Sage, and are incompatible with my system's GMP.

The problem here is my system's gcc using libraries from Sage, when it really shouldn't.  But this is a little difficult to avoid, unless I can patch things somewhere so that executables from the system such as gcc or git are explicitly *not* run with Sage's environment modifications (e.g. to `$PATH`).  I believe this is less of a problem on Linux.

> I disagree with your solution: it just needs to reorder the operations from

Why?  I think it's a rather sensible solution.

> 1. Uninstall
> 2. Build
> 3. Install
> 
> to
> 
> 1. Build
> 2. Uninstall
> 3. Install

It sort of depends on what you mean by "order of operations".  Currently, `sage-spkg` does the second process, which is certainly my preference.  (This process has its own problems, e.g. when building Python--this is partly Python's fault, and partly our fault for not providing better isolation between build and runtime environments.)

However, when you run `./sage -f` like I did, it manually calls `make <pkg>-clean` before calling `make <pkg>`.  Perhaps it shouldn't.  

I don't consider this a blocker though, unless the problem can be reproduced other than on Cygwin, since I'm pretty much the only person who does development on Cygwin, and this isn't a normal use case.

A few additional thoughts:

a) As for sage-gcc, recursively uninstalling all dependents doubly makes sense.  If you rebuild mpir you have to rebuild gcc anyways.

b) I'm thinking at the very least recursive uninstall should happen for all the "toolchain-deps"

c) Something I think would make all of this work better (either instead of, or parallel to separate packages), would be to have a separate install prefix, either under `$SAGE_LOCAL` or parallel to `$SAGE_LOCAL` or all toolchain dependencies.

I'll try to reproduce that on x86_64, as I don't have access to that architecture.  But I see what you're saying in general.

There are two cases here:

* without sage-gcc
* with sage-gcc

The reason I focused here on Cygwin is that this a problem for Cygwin even *without* sage-gcc due to problems with the DLL search path on Windows.  It non-sage-gcc should not have any problem on Linux.

But it is a problem certainly for sage-gcc if it's built against a sage-mpir that is not compatible somehow or other with the system's libgmp.


This all goes back to (one of) Sage's original sins, which is that you're building software packages in a build environment that is also the installation target.

I actually kind of agree with Volker on this one :)  But I'm also sympathetic to it since:

a) I broke it.

b) I was bitten by this issue myself, and on Cygwin it can rather badly break patchbots since it affects Cygwin even without installing sage-gcc.

I'm sorry but you'll have to live with that.  Read the docs?  With GNU make functions, if you ignore the `$` (or at least, understand that the function call is treated the same as any other variable expansion), and the commas, then it reads more or less like LISP:

`(if (filter <the-dependency> TOOLCHAIN_DEPS) --keep-existing)`

where `filter` expands to `<the-dependency>` if it is found in `TOOLCHAIN_DEPS`, and `if` expands to its second argument if its first argument is non-empty (or to its optional third argument if the first argument is empty).

Are you getting that *with* this patch, or on bare 8.3.rc1.

Either way that's normal.  That's just what `sage-spkg-uninstall` says if it can't find `local/var/lib/sage/installed/mpir-<whatever>`.  As far is it knows there's nothing to uninstall.

I think I've addressed all of these:

[x] removed `xz` from `TOOLCHAIN_DEPS`

[x] used `$(MAKE) $(inst_pkg)` for each package in `TOOLCHAIN_DEPS` (serially)

[x] updated the comment; though I don't know if what it says now is really any better (I think it is though)

Understanding this syntactically is not the same as actually understanding it semantically. Whenever I try to review this ticket, I also end up realizing that there is no way to be sure that this `Makefile` syntax does what it is supposed to do.

And your suggestion to run `make -f build/make/Makefile -n DEBUG_RULES=1` would be useful if it would actually do what it said: the `toolchain-deps` rules that you change on this ticket do not appear there.

That's just for printing the automatically generated rules, not for printing every rule in the makefile, not statically-defined targets, like `toolchain-deps`.

I'm not sure what's unclear about that target.

I believe your intentions are sincere, but I still find this objection very confusing.  I feel like you're just stubbornly refusing to learn for some reason, because I find it easy to understand, and to check; maybe just not as easy as, say, a Python script.  I don't know if that's what's going on; that's just what it feels like to me.  Maybe a tutorial on make would help; I don't know.

Anyways, I think that discussion is outside the scope of this ticket.

Actually, the more I think about it, I think we should avoid adding yet another environment variable for now.  Is this something we actually need?  If there's not an obvious use case for setting this flag for all packages I think it should be avoided.  The name `SAGE_KEEP_EXISTING` is also very unclear as to what it does.  Keep existing what?  In the context of the `sage-spkg` script it makes sense, but it's very unobvious otherwise.
