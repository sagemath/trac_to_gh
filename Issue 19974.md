I noticed that you closed #19700 to move its resolution here, you might want to do the same with #19134.

In #24742, I am disallowing strings. So `0.0` should work but not `"0"`.

I'm removing issue 5 since that's just `QQbar(3.0)` versus `ZZ(3.0)`. That has nothing to do with matrices.

And 1. is subtly wrong with the current version of #24742:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 2)
sage: p = pari('[1, 2; 3, 4]')
sage: M(p)
[1 3]
[2 4]
