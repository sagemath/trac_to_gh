Keywords: topological manifolds

This ticket implements scalar fields on topological manifolds. This is a follow up of ticket #18529 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). See the meta-ticket #18528 for an overview.
By *scalar field*, it is meant a continuous map f: M --> K, where K is a topological field and M a topological manifold over K.

This ticket implements the following Python classes:
- `CoordFunction`: abstract base class for coordinate functions, i.e. functions
  V\subset K<sup>n</sup> --> K, where V is some chart codomain and n=dim(M)
  - `CoordFunctionSymb`: symbolic coordinate functions
- `MultiCoordFunction`: functions V\subset K<sup>n</sup> --> K<sup>m</sup>, where V is some chart codomain and m some
  positive integer
- `ScalarFieldAlgebra`: set C<sup>0</sup>(M) of scalar fields M --> K as a commutative algebra over K 
  (Parent class)
- `ScalarField`: scalar field M --> K (Element class)
Internally, `ScalarField`'s are described by their coordinate representations in various charts, which are implemented as a dictionary of `CoordFunction`'s, with the charts as keys. 
At the moment, there is only one concrete class for coordinate functions: `CoordFunctionSymb` (functions described by symbolic expressions of the coordinates), but in the future there should be numerical coordinate functions (hence the abstract base class `CoordFunction`).

Yay, finally had time to go through this. So, compared to the previous ticket, there is a lot less to discuss. I've mostly pushed a bunch of documentation changes on my last commit. However, I think there are still a few things to do.

- I am guessing there will eventually be another subclass of `CoordFunction`? At present, there does not seem to be a reason to have an ABC. Moreover, you could probably make any numerical coordinate chart be `._express` with the appropriate methods. However, I am wondering if there should be a parent for `CoordFunction` (and have `CoordFunction` be a subclass of `AlgebraElement`), which would allow you to not duplicate code and use the coercion framework. Actually, perhaps `CoordFunction` should be a subclass of `Morphism`.

  Also, I converted the methods in `CoordFunction` to ``@`abstract_method` since these get picked up by the `TestSuite` as opposed to raising a `NotImplementedError`. (I haven't fixed the doctests yet in case the ABC gets removed.)

- I understand why you want to put "the" in the string representations (e.g., in `ScalarFieldAlgebra`) because it is how we would say it (in English), but this breaks convention with other parts of Sage. Moreover, it implies a certain amount of uniqueness to the manifold. However, there could be 2 different manifolds with the same dimension, name, etc.

- Similarly, in the docstrings, we should change "the *" to "this *" (sorry I didn't catch this previously).

- I don't like `omit_function_args` and `nice_derivatives` being included in the global namespace. I think these are better converted to global options. The question becomes what to attach the global options to. I am thinking `Manifold` (a function is a Python object too, so we can attach data to it) and `TopologicalManifold`. Either that, or we just have one object `ManifoldOptions` into the global namespace (but I am less favorable to this option).

- There are failing doctests in `utilities.py` likely due to recent changes in the symbolic function code (independent of my changes).

There's still likely a few more things that might need a little bit of attention, but I am pretty sure these are all of the main points.

At present, there does not seem to be a reason to have an ABC.\n\nYes there will be other subclasses of `CoordFunction`: a major project is to have a subclass for numerical functions, in order to deal with numerical manifolds (for instance computer-generated spacetimes on a grid).

Thank you very much for working on this !

Yes there will be other subclasses of `CoordFunction`: a major project is to have a subclass for numerical functions, in order to deal with numerical manifolds (for instance computer-generated spacetimes on a grid). This was the very purpose for creating this ABC: it provides the unique interface with the rest of tensor calculus on manifolds, factoring out what has to be implemented by a concrete class (the abstract methods). So I think it is important to maintain the ABC.

However, I am wondering if there should be a parent for `CoordFunction` (and have `CoordFunction` be a subclass of `AlgebraElement`), which would allow you to not duplicate code and use the coercion framework. Actually, perhaps `CoordFunction` should be a subclass of `Morphism`.

OK, I will give a try to this, introducing the proper algebra (no time to do it right now, though...)

Thanks. I didn't know about this.

Agreed.

`TopologicalManifold` sounds good, since this where the charts live in the current approach.

Indeed this reflects some bug in the latest pynac (cf. #20456); fortunately it is fixed by #20475; so if the latter is merged before the current ticket, we can leave the doctests as they are.

I guess what I am asking is how much of concrete class `CoordFunctionSym` can be lifted to the ABC?

It should be a fairly small class; a parent that takes a chart as input. I can work on this for my next commit.

When you say "the manifold," you are saying there is a unique manifold. Context makes it clear exactly which manifold you're talking about (and hence unique), but for something like documentation, "this manifold" better defines what you are reference (although personally, I would just replace it by ```self```...).

Not much: I would say that `CoordFunctionSymb` is optimal: everything that could be lifted to the ABC `CoordFunction` is already  there.

> Your changes look good to me. So if everything propagates up nicely. Then you can set a positive review (unfortunately it seems like this won't get into 7.2 :/).

Good news: I've propagated the changes to all tickets up to #19209 (pseudo-Riemannian metrics): everything works fine! (this was also the occasion to move all print instructions to Python3 syntax and to correct the bibliographic references according to #20496). So everything is OK for me.
