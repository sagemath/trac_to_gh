I added "graphs/graph_plot.py" to the reference manual, and fixed many syntax errors (particularly bulleted lists). 



However, one error persists when building the documentation, and I have been unable to fix it.

 `<autodoc>:0: ERROR: Unexpected indentation.`

I think you need to add a blank line:

```diff
diff --git a/sage/graphs/graph_plot.py b/sage/graphs/graph_plot.py
--- a/sage/graphs/graph_plot.py
+++ b/sage/graphs/graph_plot.py
@@ -775,6 +775,7 @@ class GraphPlot(SageObject):

Thanks, John.  Can you look at the error at #8046 as well when you get a chance?  We have been totally baffled over here trying to figure out where these Sphinx errors occur; the messages are essentially useless when you get to these last few in each file because there are no line numbers.

Anyway, Peter, you can fix that tomorrow morning then and then I'll check it out on my install.

I added the line break, and the documentation now builds without error. 

First, apply


`trac_11487_graphPlotReferenceAddition.patch`


and then apply


`trac_11487_linebreakInsertionFix.patch`

John, thank you for finding that problem!

I somehow destroyed my documentation by deleting a single .rst file that didn't matter, but earlier we had already checked that this was the correct fix and all looks good.  Positive review.
