Thanks, John.  Can you look at the error at #8046 as well when you get a chance?  We have been totally baffled over here trying to figure out where these Sphinx errors occur; the messages are essentially useless when you get to these last few in each file because there are no line numbers.

Anyway, Peter, you can fix that tomorrow morning then and then I'll check it out on my install.
