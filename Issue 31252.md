Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

I don't think anything I wrote there is really important. If you feel lazy about any of these, feel free to ignore a comment ;)

I know I am slightly late to the party, but I think this is a better idiom since it is more robust: (You don't need to change this if this remains at a positive review.)

```
-        if category is None:
-            category = Groups().Commutative()
+        category = Groups().Commutative().or_subcategory(category)
```


Also, the patchbot reports an error with 9.4.beta0:

```

Is this an actual error?
