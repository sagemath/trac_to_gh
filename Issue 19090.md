This ticket implements two inhomogeneous bases of the symmetric functions, one called the `irreducible_character` and the other `induced_trivial_character` and shorthands `st` and `ht`.  These bases play the roll for the symmetric group realized as permutation matrices that the Schur functions play to the character of the irreducible Gl_n representations.

In addition, two methods are added to the symmetric function element class.  One `eval_at_permutation_roots` that evaluates a symmetric function at the roots of unity of a permutation matrix with a given cycle type and the other, `eval_at_permutation_roots`, interprets a symmetric function as a symmetric group character and computes the Frobenius image.
