# Issue 24002: Implement soliton cellular automata

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24239

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2017-11-19 08:12:33

CC:  sage-combinat aschilling bsalisbury01

Keywords: soliton cellular automata crystals

Connected with Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals, mathematical physics, and dynamical systems. We have the infrastructure by using the rigged configuration bijection. So we should implement SCAs.

I fixed some typos in the documentation and added a new doctest to reflect Example 3.4 from `[LS2017]_`.  If you are okay with these changes, then please set the ticket to positive review on my behalf.
