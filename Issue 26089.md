The problem is that `current_randstate().seed()` provides longs, and apparently networkx does not like it:


```
sage: graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(50,2)
ValueError: 337906337582125808005456054818180223663L cannot be used to generate a random.Random instance
```


However it likes instances of `random.Random` objects which are provided by `current_randstate().python_random()`.

Maybe should i use `current_randstate().c_random()` which is a 31bit-only integer, or `current_randstate().python_random() % sys.maxint`.

I guess that they do not support long because they are going to support Python 3 only.

With this patch I'm getting lots of test suite errors on Arch:

ValueError: <sage.cpython._py2_random.Random object at 0x561e012e8f50> cannot be used to generate a random.Random instance

Running the test code directly in Sage works fine. Using c_random() instead of python_random() makes the tests pass.
