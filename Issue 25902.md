Yes, but is this the Right Thing To Do(tm), compared for example `# python 3` comments?

Good question. Should we continue from area to another (now posets, next matrices, then groups...), or from problem to another? For print function Frédéric used the latter way.

Ok to fix all doctests output with generators or ok to let this ticket as it is ?

`@`jmantysalo
I suggest to set Component field to python3 it is handy to have a global view of what is done or not in py3.

OK. And anyways, this is perlable task so can be done again if conflicts with another patch. Done with


```
egrep '<generator object [[:alnum:]_]+ at' src/sage -R -l | xargs perl -e 's|<generator object ([[:alnum:]_]+) at |<generator object ...\1 at |g;' -p -i.bak
