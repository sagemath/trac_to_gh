CC:  @tobiasdiez slelievre dimpase jhpalmieri

Along the same lines as #30859 for debian, 
this is for several purposes:

- Test proper isolation of our build (i.e., the presence of unused system packages do not break our build) using `tox -e ...-maximal` - to reveal errors such as #30745 (homebrew: Errors when homebrew's ntl, flint, or ecl are installed in /usr/local)
- Testing sagelib without Sage-the-distribution (similar to #28745/#30845 for conda)
- Preparation for tickets that will add `spkg-configure.m4`

(from #30371)

Well, it's easy to implement in `build/bin/sage-print-system-package-command` - in order to give both advice for users and set up the -maximal environment. I think I'll implement this in the polymake ticket.
