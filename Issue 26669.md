Keywords: pinfo, introspection, documentation, IPython, R, macaulay2

For some interfaces, using the IPython `%pinfo`/`%pinfo2` magic or the questionmark syntax for viewing the help and source code fails with an `AttributeError` (see below).

The interfaces R and Macaulay2 are affected by this, possibly others as well.

This bug occurs in the console as well as the Jupyter notebook. The oldstyle notebook does not seem to be affected. Possibly related: #11913 and #10860.

I found the bug to be caused by `sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec` returning `None` in this case, which apparently is not supported by IPython.

Here is the stack trace:
