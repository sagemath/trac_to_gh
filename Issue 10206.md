# Issue 10206: Sage silently fails when passing wrong side for cayley_graph

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: hivert

Original creation time: 2010-11-03 10:40:11

Assignee: hivert

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: Cayley graph

The following is expected

```
sage: S2 = SymmetricGroup(2)
sage: G = S2.cayley_graph()
sage: G.edges()
[((), (1,2), 1), ((1,2), (), 1)]
sage: G = S2.cayley_graph(side="twosided")
sage: G.edges()
[((), (1,2), (1, 'right')), ((1,2), (), (1, 'right'))]
```

However if a wrong parameter is given to side, a graph with no edges is returned rather than raising an error:

```
sage: G = S2.cayley_graph(side="both")
sage: G.edges()
[]
```

After the patch

```
sage: S2 = SymmetricGroup(2)
sage: G = S2.cayley_graph(side="both")
