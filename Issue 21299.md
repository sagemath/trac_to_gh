#21479 allows to set `--prefix`, but of course we can't write to `/usr/local` because we aren't root at 'make' time. (See also #21495.)

So, for people who really want all software in /usr/local, we could just point them to https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/ in the documentation.
Haven't used that in 10 years, but looks like it is still maintained.
