Wow, getting more and more inefficient (memory footprint, number of system calls/filesystem accesses).  (W.r.t. reinventing the wheel, we should probably consider dynamically creating Makefiles to build the Sage library... ;-) )

You could at least cache the mapping of library names to their (existing, probably single) pathnames (and reuse them instead of creating hundreds of copies); if there's a shared library, you don't have to record another potential static one of the same library -- on *nix at least.  Not sure whether hardcoding the library folders (`SAGE_LOCAL/lib*/`) there makes sense, or is appropriate.

After all, not relying on (say) timestamps of headers but recompiling and relinking on every change of a shared library is pretty much against one of their purposes.




`libFOO.dll` is not the convention used on Windows AFAIK; we may specialize according to the platform, also avoiding unnecessary calls of `glob()`.




Do you want to keep the verbose listing of (lengthy!) dependencies by default?




You've renamed the parameter `library_order` to `library_sort_key`, the docstring of `wrap_create_extension_list()` doesn't yet reflect that change.

I'd love to, but I think neither upstream Cython nor upstream distutils will want to support that.

> You could at least cache the mapping of library names to their (existing, probably single) pathnames
Right.

> if there's a shared library, you don't have to record another potential static one of the same library -- on *nix at least.
Well, it doesn't really hurt either. It's just to be safe.

> After all, not relying on (say) timestamps of headers but recompiling and relinking on every change of a shared library is pretty much against one of their purposes.
Again, you are right but I don't see an easy way to express this in the build system.

> Do you want to keep the verbose listing of (lengthy!) dependencies by default?
Which "verbose listing of (lengthy!) dependencies"?

I just checked

```
find local/ -type f |xargs ls -l --sort=time
```


and the only old files were from `numpy`. So everything except numpy seems to install everything with recent timestamps.

As we have seen, you can easily add `distutils: libraries = foo bar` **without** making the modules *depend* (in distutils' sense) on the libraries (i.e., their proper headers).

> As we have seen, you can easily add `distutils: libraries = foo bar` **without** making the modules *depend* (in distutils' sense) on the libraries (i.e., their proper headers).

Right, **and this was the reason I created this ticket**.

Some testing would be nice, e.g. use gcc include dependency output and compare with linked libraries.
