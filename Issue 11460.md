# Issue 11460: conf.py in thematics tutorial overwrites jsmath macros

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11632

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2011-07-26 22:03:45

Assignee: mvngu

Because of the line 

```
html_theme_options['jsmath_macros'] = ["mathfrak : ['\\\\mathbf{#1}', 1]"]
```

in `thematics_tutorials/conf.py`, existing jsmath macros are overwritten, so Sage-specific macros like `\QQ` don't work.  The attached patch fixes this.

Hi john,

Is there any missing dependencies ? On 

```
popcorn-*evel/sage-review $ sage -version
```

with just the patch applied I get:

```
Exception occurred:
  File "/home/florent/src/Sage/sage/devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/conf.py", line 35, in <module>
    html_theme_options['jsmath_macros'].append("mathfrak : ['\\\\mathbf{#1}', 1]")
KeyError: 'jsmath_macros'
The full traceback has been saved in /tmp/sphinx-err-IGtEC6.log, if you want to report the issue to the developers.
```

| Sage Version 4.7, Release Date: 2011-05-23                         |
Or should it be applied on some dev version ?

I can't reproduce this; I've tried on two different machines with vanilla versions of Sage 4.7.  (I wrote the patch based on 4.7.1.rc0, but I don't think anything relevant has changed since 4.7.)  I can change the patch to

```diff
diff --git a/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/conf.py b/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/conf.py
--- a/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/conf.py
+++ b/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/conf.py

if you think that would be a good idea.

Replying to [comment:2 jhpalmieri]:

Yes, please do it.  The problem mentioned by hivert is reproducible with sage-4.7.2.alpha3 (note you need to delete the `devel/sage/doc/output` directory before testing).
