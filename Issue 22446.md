Building upon #22658 (Support interface coercion `polymake(X)` for `Polyhedron`), we provide a backend in `backend_polymake.py` that does all `Polyhedron` computations using polymake (in particular, the initial computation of the double description).

For quadratic field extensions of the rationals, this backend should be faster than the generic implementation in Python (unless the pexpect overhead dominates). 


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22683

Two things I see:

- `def _polymake_` is missing doctests.
- In `__iter__`, you should use ```self``` in the docstrings. You also don't need to have an `INPUT:` block since there essentially no input.

Otherwise LGTM modulo the dependency.

which itself comes from #22630. Volker is currently testing the ticket so don't touch it now. If it is accepted as is, could we have a follow up to import `LCM_list` directly from `sage.arith.functions`? Although if I have problems with `lazy_import`, I will be fighting symptoms rather than the disease by doing that.
