# Issue 27812: polynomial is_zero() ignores exceptions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28049

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2019-06-24 13:40:43

`Polynomial.is_zero()`, `is_one()` and `is_term()` run arbitrary Python code, so exceptions can occur. We should add a Cython `except` declaration to pass exceptions.
