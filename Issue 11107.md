# Issue 11107: Convex Hulls, Hull number in graphs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11279

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2011-05-01 20:30:13

This ticket implements a method to compute the hull number of a graph. As it requires to compute many convex hulls, a corresponding hull method is defined too. As computing many hulls is a mess unless you can cache some useful information, these methods are defined inside of a convexity_properties class, which I hope I documented enough `:-)`

If you feel some things are badly named or should be rearranged, please tell me. I thought about this code for a while, and even though it works somehow well I am still not satisfied with it `:-)`

(The file convexity_properties is added to the reference manual, and explains most of what the code does)

The patch is working and I believe it should be merged into sage.

Right ! It's now rebased on top of #11944, in Sage 4.8.alpha0 `:-)`

There is a small issue with the formatting of the documentation:

```
docstring of sage.graphs.convexity_properties.ConvexityProperties:29: (WARNING/2) Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.
```

Sorry about that ! It's fixed in the updated version `:-)`
