This is definitely a bug, which could be fixed.  In the meantime, as a workround 
you might just do

"<p>Let  $a < b$.</p>"

since that will look better anyways.

I can't tell if I'm seeing the same problem or not, so I have a new ticket which might be related: #4316.

When testing the problem in #4316:

```
%html 
some math: $x<y$.
```

I get the message 

```
NameError: global name 'cgi' is not defined
```

More importantly, when testing the problem reported here, I don't see a change in behavior: after editing the worksheet and typing 

```
<p> Let <i>a&lt;b</i>.</p>
```

in between cells and saving, it looks fine, but when I click "Edit" again, the `&lt;` has turned into `<`, and it is printed wrong.

Mike's patch above breaks %html mode since it assumes you literally want "<" every time you write it.  That means you can't type `<b>hello</b>`.  I like it better the other way (before), that demanded that you type &lt; instead of <.

This is somewhat of a moot point now that TinyMCE is in.

Changing priority from minor to critical.

I've attached a patch which fixes the quoting issue for the Edit button.  Basically, we need to escape ampersands as well as less thans.

Positive review, fixes the problem for me.  Explanation makes sense too, although interestingly I never saw e.g. &lt anywhere, whether in TinyMCE or in the Edit button, or even in "View Source", when this problem occurred.

Looks good to me, too.

kcrisman: that was the problem.  There should have &lt; things in the Edit view.

Merged trac_4245-html-escape.patch only in Sage 3.3.alpha6.

Cheers,
