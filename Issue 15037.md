# Issue 15037: prime finite fields have atomic representation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15274

This should return true:

```
sage: GF(3)._repr_option('element_is_atomic')
False
```

There are some hacks in the `_repr_` method of polynomials that might not be necessary if all base rings would properly declare whether they are atomic.
