Apparently 

```
**It is very important that the names of the symbolic links in Sage's folders**
** be precisely as indicated. If the names differ, Sage will not notice that**
**the files are present**
```

is not achieving the desired effect in `.rst` format.

The `**` does work across linebreaks, but the `**`, linebreak `**` is likely getting read incorrectly. The fix should just be removing all but the first and last `**`.

(Side note, the `.bashrc` part bullet points are not correctly aligned.)

This fix is fine. The actual problem was the space near the beginning of the second line (`**[space]be precisely as indicated ...`).
