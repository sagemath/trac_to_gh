Oops, I accidentally got the same commits in both #20031 and #20032. Actually, I might just close #20032 and make that part of the present ticket. It fits the theme of "wrapping new Arb functions" and it's a fairly simple (and hopefully uncontroversial) change anyway.

I think that's it. I could think of more methods to add, but they don't need to go in this ticket.

would you please use the new style doc-test continuation `....:`
(see patchbot report for where the old-style `...̀` appears in your branch)
