I have just made a few documentation tweaks.

I think that computing and storing all of that information would take more time since it is done in Python than the binomial computation time (done at at most the C level if not a lower level). So I don't think it is worthwhile to do this right now unless we already have efficient code to generate Pascal's triangle.

However, if you do want a way to get more speed with minimal changes, I would suggest moving all of the helper functions to the Hasse diagram. That way you are working with integer labels and directly on the underlying digraph.

Convention for the list of methods is to refer to it as "the poset", not "a poset", or "this poset".

`atkinson` method doc-string is missing the grave character for the last use of i-th.

Not going to make those changes right away until I'm finished getting reacquainted with this code and checking things over again.

There is no such convention, or at least once that is followed. `unwrap` uses "this poset" and the "a poset" makes grammatical sense here. However, I am +1 for having more uniformity.

Stefan (gh-sgrosser) should be soon moving stuff to the Hasse diagram backend, so give him a few days to do this.

How have you been doing Kevin?

I'll wait until that gets done, then. Only other thing I noticed was that `spectrum` could maybe use a better non-trivial example than BooleanLattice, since it's not immediately obvious what element '5' should correspond to.
