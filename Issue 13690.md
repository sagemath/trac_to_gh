The few remaining instances of this error are tracked at #13786. In this case,


```
sage: R = Integers(100)
sage: R(0)^0
...
ArithmeticError: 0^0 is undefined.
```

This will fail if the modulus is 1 as we are looking for a precomputed value at index 1 (python numbering) in a table of length modulus = 1...
Ok, Integers(1) is not the more interesting ring, but...

Maybe we should add a doctest for the cornercase?

Updated patch with jpflori's fix and a new doctest

Thanks, I added doctests for the mod-1 case. I also put double backticks around `0^0` per tscrim's comment in #13786.
