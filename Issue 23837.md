Minor thing, but I think it improves the readability:

```diff
-             all(alphabet.unrank(i) > alphabet.unrank(j) for
-                 i in range(min(36, alphabet.cardinality()))
+             all(alphabet.unrank(i) > alphabet.unrank(j)
+                 for i in range(min(36, alphabet.cardinality()))
                  for j in range(i)))):
```

Otherwise LGTM.
