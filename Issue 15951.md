# Issue 15951: Move the non-canonical method of EllipticCurve in EllipticCurve.abelian_group()

Keywords: elliptic curve, unique

As discussed in the ticket #11474, we should move the gens method of EllipticCurve in the concrete group returned by EllipticCurve.abelian_group, since we want EllipticCurve to be unique and the generators are not canonical.
