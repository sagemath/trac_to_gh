# Issue 16373: Trouble with multiple branches per ticket

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16610

Original creator: gagern

Original creation time: 2014-07-03 15:07:56

For #16533 I created a second branch so I could redesign the changes while keeping my previous work for reference. So I created a second local git branch, pushe dthat to the trac server.

`./sage -dev push` refused to change the branch associated with the ticket, so I did that manually in comment:14:ticket:16533. Now if I push updates, `sage` tells me:


```
$ ./sage -dev push --ticket 16533 --remote-branch u/gagern/ticket/16533b
About to push the branch "ticket/16533b" to "u/gagern/ticket/16533b" for ticket #16533. However, your local branch for ticket #16533 seems
to be "ticket/16533".
 Do you really want to proceed? [yes/No] yes

#  Use "sage --dev checkout --ticket=16533 --branch=ticket/16533b" to permanently set "ticket/16533b" as the branch associated to ticket
#  #16533.
```


But when I try that suggested command, it fails as well:


```
$ ./sage --dev checkout --ticket=16533 --branch=ticket/16533b
base must not be specified if branch is an existing branch
```


This doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me, since I didn't specify a base, did I?

It would be nice if sage would suggest a command which actually works as suggested. And I would very much welcome some simple command to only change the branch associated with a ticket.

wontfix because of removal of dev scripts, see â€‹https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/JtVWAdvw-3A
