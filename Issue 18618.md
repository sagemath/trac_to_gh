There is no easy way to get the set of edges in a `breadth_first_search` traversal of the graph.
What about an optional parameter so it also return a set of edges of some breadth first search?

Similarly, for the other set of searches too. 
This is useful if there are information stored on the edges instead of vertices.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18855

Say the graph has edges ab, ac, cd, bd, bc

```

a----b--\
 \   |   \
  \--c----d
```


If we do a breadth first search from `a`, one of the possible breadth first search trees is

```

a----b--\
 \       \
  \--c    d
```

The edges in the tree are ab, ac, bd. The function should return those edges.

- you must document parameter edges

- you must document the fact that some combinations of parameters are not possible like `edges=True` and `report_distance=True`

- some spaces are needed for the quality of the code. See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style for more details

I forgot to review the last version.

- We usually use `ValueError` and not `Exception` and I think it is more appropriate here
- in the `TESTS::` block, can you add a test showing that the error is raised in such case
- at the end of the method, you added 2 extra empty lines before `def depth_first_search`. There is no need for that.

Hello,

for doctests raising errors, the correct way to write it is:

```diff
-            sage: G = Graph({1:[2,3],2:[4,5],3:[6,7]})
-            sage: list(G.breadth_first_search(1, report_distance=True, edges=True))
-            ValueError: parameters edges and report_distance cannot be True simultaneously
+            sage: G = Graph([(0, 1)])
+            sage: list(G.breadth_first_search(1, report_distance=True, edges=True))
+            Traceback (most recent call last):
+            ...
+            ValueError: parameters edges and report_distance cannot be True simultaneously
```
Have you checked that your code passes doctests before pushing the last commit ? For instance, you can do 
`sage -btp --long src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` to tests `generic_graph.py` (including doctests marked as long), or `sage -btp --long src/sage/graphs/` to test the full graph module.

Which one ? if you are working with Python2, you should not have any failing doctests except for those related to what is modified in this ticket.

I just checked again, it was actually a single error which is related to 

```
OperationalError: unable to open database file
```
I have not downloaded any database (if it needs to be downloaded explicitly).
\\
Also, no doctests failed related to the modified ticket.
