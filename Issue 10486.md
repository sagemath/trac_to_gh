As discussed in #10528 the sage0 interface doesn't always return exactly the same thing.

I get

```
mderickx@sage:/levi/scratch/robertwb/buildbot/sage-4.6$ ./sage -t devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/sage0.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/sage0.py"

All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 9.8 seconds

The mercurial branch changes sometimes cause of patchbot. It would be good to rule out that explaination. Could you help with that Robert?

No, it's not a duplicate. At 10528 the apparent problem is solved by making the doctests less rigid. But the real problem is not fixed there. With the real problem being that the piece of code:

```
sage: sage0.clear('x')
sage: sage0.get('x')
```
Returns:

```
"...NameError: name 'x' is not defined" 
}}} in some setups and
{{{
'...NameError: name \'x\' is not defined'
}}} in other setups.
