As discussed in #10528 the sage0 interface doesn't always return exactly the same thing.

The mercurial branch changes sometimes cause of patchbot. It would be good to rule out that explaination. Could you help with that Robert?

No, it's not a duplicate. At 10528 the apparent problem is solved by making the doctests less rigid. But the real problem is not fixed there. With the real problem being that the piece of code:

```
sage: sage0.clear('x')
sage: sage0.get('x')
```

Returns:

```
"...NameError: name 'x' is not defined" 
}}} in some setups and
{{{
'...NameError: name \'x\' is not defined'
}}} in other setups.
