# Issue 21698: implement round for number field elements with real embedding

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2016-11-22 19:57:01

CC:  mkoeppe slabbe

Keywords: days79

Real embedded element has a floor and ceil but no round (= nearest integer)

```
sage: a = QuadraticField(2).gen()
sage: a.floor()
1
sage: a.ceil()
2
sage: a.round()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element_quadratic.NumberFieldElement_quadratic' object has no attribute 'round'
```

Hi Vincent,

This looks good to me. All test passed on Sage7.5.b3. Up to the reaction of the bot, you can set it to positive review.

I can reproduce the doctest failure.

But I can not reproduce the problem on the command line:

```
sage: a = 9/11
sage: round(a)
1
sage: round(K3(a))
1
```

Can someone can give me ssh access to an OSX computer? This really needs to be fixed!!

I was using my desktop at work when I reproduced the error earlier today which runs Ubuntu.

Don't you get the same error on your machine?

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2016-12-23 22:06:05

Indeed, I am able to reproduce it and has nothing to do with the current branch

```
Failed example:
    K3(9/11) - 0
Expected:
    9/11
Got:
    -1/2*sqrt3 + 9/11
```



---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2016-12-23 22:21:24

Even better ;-)

```
Failed example:
    K3.zero()
Expected:
    0
Got:
    1/2*sqrt3
```

I do not have access anymore to my Ubuntu machine to test the problem I had earlier.

All tests passed on my OSX. Positive review.
