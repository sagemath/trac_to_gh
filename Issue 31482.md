Original creator: tscrim

CC:  sage-combinat bump aschilling nthiery chapoton slabbe

Keywords: crystals, latex

We have the following:

```
sage: K = crystals.KirillovReshetikhin(['A',2,1], 2,1)
sage: view(K)
/sage-build/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/misc/decorators.py:491:
 DeprecationWarning: parameter {'backward':True} (in edge_options) is deprecated.
 Use {'dir':'back'} instead.
See https://trac.sagemath.org/31381 for details.
  return func(*args, **options)
```

We update the edge option function according to #31381.
