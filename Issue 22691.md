Conversion between gmpy2 and sage integers:
- Implement method `__mpz__` on sage integer: return an gmpy2 mpz 
- Implement method `__mpq__` on sage rational: return an gmpy2 mpq
- Implement constructor for sage integer and rational with respectively mpz and mpq parameters.
- Provide coercion.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22928

Looks good. Some small remarks.

1) For the error about missing `gmpy2` you can use `PackageNotFoundError` from `sage.misc.package`

2) `add __mpz__() to class Rational` should be `add __mpq__() to class Rational`

3) You have an indentation problem here

``` 
Coercion for gmpy2 numbers    
    sage: from gmpy2 import * # optional - gmpy2
    sage: a, b = cm.canonical_coercion(mpz(5), 10) # optional - gmpy2
    sage: a, b # optional - gmpy2
```

It should be

```
Coercion for gmpy2 numbers::

    sage: from gmpy2 import * # optional - gmpy2
    sage: a, b = cm.canonical_coercion(mpz(5), 10) # optional - gmpy2
    sage: a, b # optional - gmpy2
```


4) There should be tests for `a + b`, `a * b`, `a / b` when one of `a` or `b` is from Sage and the other from `gmpy2`

5) Couldn't you share

```
#Handle gmpy2 objects
elif is_gmpy2_type(type(x)):
    return self.canonical_coercion(py_scalar_to_element(x), y)
elif is_gmpy2_type(type(y)):
    return self.canonical_coercion(x, py_scalar_to_element(y))
```

  with the associated code that deals with numpy types?

With [PR #137 from gmpy2](https://github.com/aleaxit/gmpy/pull/137)

- you can get rid of the function `get_gmpy2_path()` and most of the declarations in `sage/libs/gmpy2.pxd`.

- you can add tests for conversions using the methods `__mpz__` and `__mpq__`

```
sage: import gmpy2
sage: gmpy2.mpz(23)
```

  and

```
sage: import gmpy2
sage: gmpy2.mpq(12/14)    
```

Not sure. Why do we provide coercion for `numpy`? It is convenient to have `Integer('2') + gmpy2.mpz('3')` working.

It is not only faster, it is much easier to read.

The concerned code is the following

```
elif MPQ_Check(<PyObject *> x):
    mpq_set(self.value, MPQ(<MPQ_Object *> x))
elif MPZ_Check(<PyObject *> x):
    self.__set_value(integer.Integer(x), base)
```

I don't see the logic in converting `x` to a Sage Integer and then calling `__set_value` instead of using the straightforward `mpq_set_z(...)`.

BTW, I don't understand your comment. What should be an evolution of `set_from_Integer`? An integer is a rational with denominator 1. This will not change in any near future.

Not sure if there is a clear difference in readability between the two options, 
by the way there are many recursive call in this function.

Another reason for the present choice was to be consistent with numpy.integer processing.
When modifying an existing code i tend to stick to the preceding coding style,
(And having a standard processing for all int type is an understandable design choice).
On the other hand in numpy.integer case doing a recursive call seems to be most concise way to do it, 
wich as you demonstrated is not the case for gmpy2 mpz.

That being said i got your point and prefer your solution.

```

Then my program will not compile.

But should we really use [ComplexNumber](ComplexNumber) this way ?\\
This call the function create_ComplexNumber and his first parameter is supposed to be the real part only.
\\
In your call the first parameter is the whole complex number.
\\
Secondly create_ComplexNumber always try to convert the parameters (real and imag) into string before calling the [ComplexNumber](ComplexNumber) constructor. \\
Given that if you try to call ComplexNumber() with another complex type as parameter you will get the same result :


```
sage: cn = ComplexNumber(5,4)
sage: ComplexNumber(cn)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce to a ComplexNumber: <type 'str'>
```

That being said the gmpy2's precision is not currently transmitted with `RR` function.

The only fix i see so far would be do a new `mpfr_init2` during `_set ` call. It's a little ugly :

```
#real_mpfr.pyx line 1467
   elif HAVE_GMPY2 and type(x) is gmpy2.mpfr:
       self._parent = self._parent.to_prec(x.precision)
       mpfr_init2(self.value, x.precision)
       mpfr_set(self.value, (<gmpy2.mpfr>x).f, parent.rnd)
```


Or we can assume the user shoud do that :


```
sage: R = RealField(128)
sage: R(gmpy2.mpfr(gmpy2.mpq('1/3'), precision=128))
0.33333333333333333333333333333333333333
sage: _.prec()

You do not need to put `# optional - gmpy2` everywhere. Only where you explicitely need `gmpy2`.

Could you also doctest the fact that the composition of conversions `Sage number -> gmpy2 number -> Sage number` is the identity when precisions are set appropriately (ie we get back an equal element)? For example

```
sage: MPCF = MPComplexField(63)
sage: x = MPCF('15.64E+128', '15.64E+128')
sage: y = mpc(x)         # optional - gmpy2
sage: y.precision        # optional - gmpy2
(63, 63)
sage: MPCF(y) == x       # optional - gmpy2
True
```

And also the other way around `gmpy2 number -> Sage number -> gmpy2 number`

```
sage: x = gmpy2.mpc('1.324+4e50j', precision=(70,70))  # optional - gmpy2
sage: y = ComplexField(70)(x)                          # optional - gmpy2
sage: gmpy2.mpc(y) == x                                # optional - gmpy2
True

Are you sure that `precision` means the same thing on both sides?

I think that the problem is that we just copy the values of real and imag part and both of them are `gmpy2.mpfr` with their own precision.


```
sage: x = gmpy2.mpc('1.324+4e50j', precision=(70,70))
sage: x.precision
(70, 70)
sage: x.real.precision
53
sage: x.imag.precision
53
sage: x
mpc('1.3240000000000000000005+3.9999999999999999999976e+50j',(70,70))
sage: x.real, x.imag
(mpfr('1.3240000000000001'), mpfr('4.0000000000000003e+50'))
```


`MPComplexField` works fine because it use mpc_set and not two mpfr_set.

Indeed, `mpc/types.pxd` does not contain the distutils directive for libraries. Since `types.pxd` is included in all other files in `mpc/` it makes more sense to have the directive in this file rather than in `__init__.pxd`.

No because not everybody using that header will need every library. It seems overkill to require gmp and mpfr and mpc if you only ever use the `mpz_t` type.

I was thinking about something else: it is trivial to replace `mpc_set_fr_fr` by two `mpfr_set` calls. So maybe we could just do that. I'll try to create a PR for gmpy2.

Using `mpc_set_fr_fr` would impose to link against mpfr. A cleaner possibility is to split the `gmpy2` headers into 3 headers `gmpy2.gmp`, `gmpy2.mpfr` and `gmpy2.mpc`. Each of them with a proper distutils directive.

I guess you mean "using `mpfr_set` would impose to link against mpfr".

But that is in fact a very logical requirement, since the input type of `GMPy_MPC_From_mpfr` is `mpfr_t`. So you already need to have an `mpfr_t` in order to use that function, which makes it likely that you are using MPFR already.

I would say
- create a patch and add it to gmpy2
- move the ticket in needs review
- wait for the PR to be accepted before setting it to positive review
The rationale is that we are currently testing gmpy2 integration. At the time it stabilizes, we should ask for a new release and remove all of Sage patches.

This sentence makes me sad and worried at the same time. It shows that you absolutely do not understand what `import_gmpy2()` does.

The *real reason* that you don't need `import_gmpy2()` in that file is that you are simply not calling any gmpy2 functions in that Cython module.

Unfortunately, it's not easy to properly fix. The basic problem is that the `cimport` is parsed very very early in the Cython build system, at a point where macros like `HAVE_GMPY2` are not considered yet.
