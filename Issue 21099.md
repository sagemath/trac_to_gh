AFAIK, everywhere else in Sage `some_elements` returns a list. Plus, an iterator is something difficult for beginners to work with in general, and (in principle) `some_elements` are suppose to return things that are easy for beginners to play around with.

```
sage: ZZ.some_elements()
<generator object _some_elements_from_iterator at 0x7f68fd924af0>
sage: QQ.some_elements()
<generator object some_elements at 0x7f68fd946550>
```


(...and iterators/generators would be more Python3... ;) )

Lists are still perfectly valid Python3 (although things become "views", which are still not iterators/generators). :P

Uggg...I think it is somewhat unfortunate that we have that. I'm still of the opinion `some_elements` should return a list, but this doesn't make anything worse. So if the patchbot comes back clean or all tests pass, you can set this to a positive review on my behalf.
