I cannot reproduce that on Linux. Are you using some unusual compiler or environment variables?

I'll test it on your OSX machine now.

Got it. It's a race condition with parallel builds.

Thanks for the report.

Fixed in two ways:

1. Instead of doing `make check` (which does a temporary installation), we run `make check-install` in Sage, which checks the installed version of `cysignals`.

2. The race condition with `make check` is fixed upstream.

Resolution: fixed
