# Issue 31993: --disable-r should disable pcre

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32230

I think R is the only package that needs pcre,


```
$ find ./ -name dependencies | xargs grep -l pcre
./pkgs/r/dependencies
```


So it can probably be disabled with `--disable-r`, too.

Are we ever going to make R an optional package? If so, the same makes sense for pcre.

Duplicating all of R's forward- and reverse-dependencies in `configure.ac` is really a disaster waiting to happen, but adding "pcre" to the list at least makes it a better-executed disaster.

Yes, I agree. R is probably safe because nobody has been updating this spkg in a long time anyway.
But `--disable-notebook` is probably already in need of updating -- the dependencies of Jupyter change rapidly.
