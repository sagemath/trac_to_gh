# Issue 18317: Python 3 preparation: Most functions of module {{{string}}} are gone in Py3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18554

Original creator: wluebbe

Original creation time: 2015-05-30 17:38:46

Use of `string` module functions like `join()` must be replaced by the corresponding `string` methods.

`from string import join` will fail. Those imports must be removed.

Uses like `print(string.join(a_list)` must be changed to `print("".join(a_list)`.

The following functions are reoved:

```
capitalize|center|count|expandtabs|find|index|join|
ljust|lower|lstrip|maketrans|replace|rfind|rindex|rjust|rsplit|
rstrip|split|strip|swapcase|translate|upper|zfill
```

LGTM. (I didn't even know such a module existed before this ticket; I had learned these as methods of strings.)

Merge conflict, probably #18531

Not quite surprising, but there was hope ...
I am going to wait for 6.8.beta3.

I merged with Sage-6.8.beta3 and successfully tested `all-long`.
Therefore I changed the ticket again to positive-review.
