In #12963 a possible issue of the patch is mentioned.

Unfortunately, the suggested patch reintroduced some flaws of os.popen, in particular the one of #12963.
Please use the upstream patch from https://bitbucket.org/brickenstein/polybori/changeset/ae7a475cd687 instead.

Indeed, it's caused by p3.

Diff between logs of p2 and logs of p3: http://wstein.org/home/keshav/files/polybori-log.3.diff.xz

Meanwhile, #13124 had superseded this issue, so I think this ticket should be marked as a duplicate.
