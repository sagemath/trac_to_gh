These file describes the conda environment (conda package dependencies):

`src/environment.yml` - describes packages needed for doing sagelib development. 

`environment.yml` - describes packages for sage-the-distribution development. In addition to `src/environment.yml`, this would include packages such as `automake`.

First of all, I think it's great to explore ways to provide an //alternative// to the SPKG system. I have been wanting to use conda for this for a long time.

I have not used conda-debug a lot but I think a combination of `conda debug [sagelib-recipe]`, `conda install sage`, `conda remove sagelib --force` should essentially do the right thing here as well.

No, the default is already to use the "system" package when it is available and deemed suitable by the configure test.
It can be changed to using the sage distribution's package by using `configure --with-system-glpk=no`.

This works reasonably well already (this is on macOS Mojave, with current miniconda 3). 
I had the problem that `automake` and `aclocal` installed by conda segfault, so I bootstrapped Sage using the homebrew binaries.
Then, running `configure`, most packages that have `spkg-configure` scripts recognize the installed conda packages, with the following exceptions:

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PERL_TERM_READLINE_GNU
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PARI_SEADATA_SMALL
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GF2X
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_LIBSEMIGROUPS
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PATCH
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_ISL
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_PARI*
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_ECLIB
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_LCALC
```

Then, a parallel `make` succesfully compiled 135 packages but got stuck on `ecl-16.1.2.p5`, `openblas-0.3.6.p0`, and `tachyon-0.98.9.p7`.
