Looks like that's not the issue. `build_ext` is first run with the options that we give and then `build_ext` is run again without the options we give. Not sure why it is run twice.

A fix for this would be to move `bdist_wheel` before `build_ext`.

```
python setup.py bdist_wheel build_ext <options>
```

instead of

```
python setup.py build_ext <options> bdist_wheel
```
