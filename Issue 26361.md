# Issue 26361: Cannot Open Notebook

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: @robotdna

Original creation time: 2018-10-30 03:57:48

Installed Sage through:
https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/sage

with Anaconda. 

In terminal, typed "sage" which functioned as expected and then "notebook()" which then proceeded to fail and throw an error:



```
sage: notebook()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should I just be using "sage --notebook=jupyter" instead? If so, please remove "ype "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface." in the startup message as it fails and it is misleading.
