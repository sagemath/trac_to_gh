and where does one ask for V[0]?

I'd rather apply `list()` to an iterator; e.g. wouldn't this (from comment 2) work in python3?

```
    if clique_partition:
        lines = map(lambda x: filter(lambda t: t[0]+x*t[1]==0, V),
                     filter(lambda z: z != 0, Fq))
        return (G, list(lines), v0)
```

this does not look like a right change

`x` from `V` is gone and replaced by `z` from `Fq` in `t[0]+x*t[1]==0`.

It's really baffling kind of errors message...

--------------

I was able to build sage`@`py3 capable of doctesting, following comment 14, with added #24343 and #24922.

Well, there are maybe thousands of issues remaining, some small and some big. Unicode problems are a large part of that. If we could fix the 3 tiny problems here quickly, I would prefer.

I believe we should first be able to test that these fixes actually work on py3, too, hence the dependence. Once libgap works, this should be a breeze to fix everything py3-related here.

Moreover I actually like the code using filters, as it is using iterators (on py3) rather than explicit lists, which might lead to various performance gains.
So I am not ready to just give it up, especially as trivial fixes like applying `list()` to an iterator are always possible and are much less intrusive.

I am sorry, but indiscriminate replacing of iterators with eager iterable data structures is code vandalism, as it potentially degrades performance, and does more harm than good.

Once the ability to properly test the code arrives, it becomes very easy.

It's not "code vandalism".  Currently the changes Frédéric has made here is just replacing some code with the exact equivalent (on Python 2) code that also works on Python 3.  If you believe these algorithms can be improved by the use of iterators you're welcome to take a stab at it, but as currently written that is not the case.  I can certainly see a couple small opportunities here, but it is not a priority as there is no regression here--the higher priority right now is getting Python 3 working.
