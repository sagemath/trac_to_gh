I was looking in the SAGE Tutorial and the SAGE Reference
Manual.  Perhaps something could be put there also?

I have considered making it so "press shift-enter to evaluate" is prominently
displayed for new users until they've done it a few times, when it disappears.
Thoughts?

Changing type from defect to enhancement.

It's prominently featured in the Notebook "Help" page. Should this be closed?

Yes.  Also this ticket was before the "evaluate" link existed.  Closing...
