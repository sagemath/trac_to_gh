Checks whether `self` is a Markov chain where the transition
probabilities are modeled as input labels.

`on_duplicate_transition` must be
`duplicate_transition_add_input` and the sum of the input weights
of the transitions leaving a state must add up to 1.

Review: changed spacings (PEP8), made minor modifications to the code. Cross-reviewed by cheuberg.

Everything looks good; doctests pass, docu checked, coverage checked.
