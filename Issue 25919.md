# Issue 25919: 0.0 is printed with too many digits

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26156

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2018-08-29 12:53:11


```
sage: RR(0).str(digits=3)
'0.000'
```


This is trivial to fix, but then it causes hundreds of doctest failures since every real zero is printed with one less digit.

It is a little annoying to have that one special case just to make this less of a patchbomb. However, we can always address that on a later ticket as it is the precedent.

On the other hand, do you really care whether it's `0.000000000000000` or `0.00000000000000`? What's important is that the number of digits is correct when you specifically ask for a given number of digits.
