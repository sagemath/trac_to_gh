Though "suboptimal",

```sh

Hi all, the rebased patch I posted was definitely needed, on my own Cygwin64 install at least, to let some Python dependencies of the notebook build.
Note though that Python is still very broken on Cygwin64.
A bunch of its testsuite fail, but I would not assume that the patch worsened anything.
Surely some other patches from the Cygwin folk are needed but I have no time to devote to investigating that now.
A first step would be if the Cygwin distributed Python also fails part of its testsuite or not.

Can you confirm that installation of the new spkg (with #16415) works on Cygwin?

If so, please set both tickets to "positive review" (unless there are other issues I don't know of).

You didn't get it, but the new/updated branch looks clean[er] (apart from having a weird commit history).

If we'd provide URLs to them...

Ideally we would have "checksums" for all kinds of tarballs (along with the URLs) whether offered by upstream / 3rd party ("almost" mirrors) or (just) us, and/or provide a checksum for the *uncompressed* tarball.

> Its bad enough that our retarded build system can't deal with the upstream `.tgz` ending.

Yes, it's sad we still don't fully support MS-DOS.

> But at least now the checksum is still the same as on python.org (they don't offer bz2 downloads).

Which is an upstream bug we used to fix... ;-)




Ceterum censeo Sage should support (and use) `.xz` (as btw. a couple of included packages do since quite some time IIRC).

for me it only works with the #16474#comment:3 patch applied.
Note that however I have this ticket's (#16260) branch merged over #16440 rather than over the current beta (6.3.beta3).
Without the latter the docs won't build for me.
