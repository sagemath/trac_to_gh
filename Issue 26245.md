Indeed. This has been a problem for as long as I've been working on the Python 3 port, and it's not clear to me why.  I suspect it has mostly to do with the import system.  On the one hand, the new import system has some caching to reduce the number of syscalls needed for many `import` calls.  OTOH that cache has to be filled in the first place, and that might still be slower in the extreme case of Sage.  I need to investigate this but haven't even started to yet.

Since #26908 this is vastly improved.  Startup time is still a bit slower than on Python 2, but it's much more marginal, and it might be harder to track down any specific deficiencies in this area.  Though I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from trying.

I still believe there are big gains to be made in general with lazy imports.  I don't think we need to really import *everything* that makes up the Sage global namespace if we can replace most of it with proxies.
