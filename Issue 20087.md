`add_col` and `add_variable` both add a variable to the problem; but `add_col` only allows to add a column with no name; whereas `add_variable` only allows to add a column with no coefficients. 
There should be one function (`add_variable`, probably - see #20296 for a possible interface) that can do both; should then deprecate `add_col`. 
Note that `add_col` is not used by `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`; it is only used in doctests of the backends.  
(Also compare with `add_linear_constraint`, which takes a zipped index/coefficient list, whereas `add_col` takes two parallel lists.)
