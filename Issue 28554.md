I can't seem to push to trac at the moment, so I'm attaching the patch.

I am not opposed to this. Is there any arguments against this change? Is caching that important here?

Note that it's still caching (which I think is important), it just does not use `sage.misc.cachefunc`.

I asked about caching because it was mentioned in #25828. If this does caching too I don't see any other obstacles. We may as well move on with it.
