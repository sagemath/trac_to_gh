sage: K.<phi> = NumberField(x^2-x-1)
sage: a = phi
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,a,27*a-43,-80*a+128])
sage: latex(E)

See the `\phiy`.  Not good

This is not a problem about `latex()`.  

```
sage: var('phi,y')
(phi, y)
sage: phi*y
phi*y
sage: latex(phi*y)
\phi y
```

It's a problem in `E.latex()`:

```

        elif b[2]:
            s += "+ %sy "%a[2]
```

Umm, yeah.  Probably the intended use case is 

```
sage: L.<z>=NumberField(x^2-x-1)
sage: b = z
sage: F = EllipticCurve([0,0,b,27*b-43,-80*b+128])
sage: latex(F)
y^2 + zy = x^3 + \left(27 z - 43\right)x + \left(-80 z + 128\right) 
```

So do you think that a one-whitespace change would fix this?  (Actually, there are a few similar places.)
