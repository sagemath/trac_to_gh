Keywords: logic, logicparser, prefix, infix

In the patch for this ticket, the functions recover_formula and prefix_to_infix are added to logicparser.py in the logic module.  The function recover_formula allows for the recovery of a boolean formula from its parse tree.  The function prefix_to_infix converts a parse tree from prefix form to infix form. Here are some examples.


```python
sage: import sage.logic.logicparser as logicparser
sage: t = ['->', ['~', 'a'], ['|', 'c', ['~', 'd']]]
sage: logicparser.recover_formula(t)
'~a->(c|~d)'
```



```python
sage: import sage.logic.logicparser as logicparser
sage: t = ['->', ['~', 'a'], ['|', 'c', ['~', 'd']]]
sage: logicparser.prefix_to_infix(t)
[['~', 'a'], '->', ['c', '|', ['~', 'd']]]
```

* trivial typo: "argrument" (in multiple places!)
 
* delete parens here: "prefix_to_infix() takes a parse tree as input"
 
* Someday somebody should change this... `type(tree[1]) is ListType` to `isinstance(tree[1], list)`.
