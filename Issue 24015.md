Work around the cyclic dependency of the Sage `Integer` class and the coercion model by introducing a new Cython header `integer_fake` with a minimal interface to `Integer` by doing a lazy import of `sage.rings.integer`.

Is the only dependency of the `Integer` on the coercion model from the ``@`coerce_binop` of `xgcd`? If so, I think we should do the import and manually call the coercion within `xgcd`. We might get a little performance hit, but I think it is a much more sustainable solution than hacking around the lack of good ways to break circular dependencies (i.e., header files or pre-declarations). Or is it more structural because `integer.p*` imports from `element.p*`?

Maybe it's not used a lot currently, but I would like to use it more. For example, #24247 requires this because you really want to special-case powering to an integer exponent. So that ticket is the real motivation for this one.

And note that breaking circular `cimports` is even harder since Cython gives you less control over the order. And you cannot locally do a `cimport` inside a function.
