`git grep 'def copy'` reveals a number of classes that define ad-hoc `copy` methods but not `__copy__` methods. Hence, they do not implement the copy protocol https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html, so `copy.copy` will resort to pickling/unpickling for making a copy.

For classes whose instances are immutable, see #13811 instead.

It seems this might be a long-awaited followup to #111?
