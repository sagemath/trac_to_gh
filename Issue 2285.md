# Issue 2285: add "--trace-children=yes" back for memcheck in sage-doctest

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/2285

At some point I did remove "--trace-children=yes" from sage-doctest to investigate some issue and via `-sdist` it actually got committed to the repo. Fix that.

Cheers,

Michael
