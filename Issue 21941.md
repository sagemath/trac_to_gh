The current recommendation seems to be to use

indeed, as indicated in #21610, one can get away with toplevel `make -jNUM`, but
only after some work, and assuming `make`'s version is at least 4.2.1.

I run `make -j10` all the time on OS X Sierra (`make` version 3.81) without doing anything else and have no apparent problems. Does that just mean that the process falls back to a single job for parts of the build, like the documentation?

With plain `make -j10` documentation takes 1284 seconds to build, with `export` it takes 1155 seconds. Not enough of a difference for me to stop using the simpler command.

My bad, documentation build apparently somehow gets hold of '-j10'---you could see this
by looking at 'top' output and observing about 10 python processes running.

What would matter is building of Sage packages - each of them would be built with '-j1'.

I did `make distclean` followed by `make -j8` on an 8-core Linux machine
I got, with `MAKE` set to `make -j8`

```
real    41m35.245s
user    259m17.166s

```
real    55m40.123s

Two very minor things:

- We are trying to standardize `.. NOTE::` instead of `.. note::`.
- Some of your line breaks make some lines unnaturally short to me.

The more important of the two is the first one.

Well, instead of arguing here, make a ticket to fix this Sage-wise :-)
With about 25% for `note::` vs 75% for `NOTE::`, it's a bit premature to make a fuss about it.

`A NOTE block for tips/tricks (optional).`

Does it say it must be all-caps? No. Actually I don't like all-caps, they scream too much at your face...
