Hi Frédéric,
thank you very much for pointing this out. This ticket was made in a rush only to show how to make one to the audience of SageDays64.5 and was not polished enough. According to what happened at that workshop it is also superseded by several improvements in ClusterSeed. I will live it as it is for the moment and push more changes later on if if they are needed.
Thank
S.
