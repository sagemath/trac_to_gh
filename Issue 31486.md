# Issue 31486: Patterson Decoder for binary Goppa codes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31723

CC:  caruso dimpase

Keywords: coding theory, goppa codes, patterson decoder;

Decoder for binary Goppa codes whose defining polynomials are square free which uses Patterson decoding algorithm in order to correct errors in words.
The Patterson decoder makes use of the terminated extended Euclidean algorithm.
For further details see 

N. Patterson: The algebraic decoding of Goppa codes, IEEE Transactions on
Information Theory 21.2 (1975), pp. 203-207.

Johan S. H. Rosenkilde gave us a feedback on the first draft of this decoder and also suggested us possible reviewers. 
So, we would like to thank him.

Could you post a branch, rather than an attachment?

The method `_partial_xgcd_gen` is called only once; is it really useful to have a special method for this? (Something that makes more sense according to me is to have a general shared function for this task which could be defined for example in the class handling univariate polynomials; but, more simply, you can just put your code directly in the caller method `_decode_to_code_and_message`.)

Another general remark is that the documentation is not always correctly formatted.
See https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content for details.
In addition you should probably add TESTS sections (in the documentation) for checking that errors are handled correctly.

Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
