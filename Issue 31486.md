CC:  @xcaruso @dimpase

Keywords: coding theory, goppa codes, patterson decoder;

Decoder for binary Goppa codes whose defining polynomials are square free which uses Patterson decoding algorithm in order to correct errors in words.
The Patterson decoder makes use of the terminated extended Euclidean algorithm.
For further details see 

N. Patterson: The algebraic decoding of Goppa codes, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 21.2 (1975), pp. 203-207.

Johan S. H. Rosenkilde gave us a feedback on the first draft of this decoder and also suggested us possible reviewers. 
So, we would like to thank him.

The method `_partial_xgcd_gen` is called only once; is it really useful to have a special method for this? (Something that makes more sense according to me is to have a general shared function for this task which could be defined for example in the class handling univariate polynomials; but, more simply, you can just put your code directly in the caller method `_decode_to_code_and_message`.)

Another general remark is that the documentation is not always correctly formatted.
See https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#the-docstring-of-a-function-content for details.
In addition you should probably add TESTS sections (in the documentation) for checking that errors are handled correctly.
