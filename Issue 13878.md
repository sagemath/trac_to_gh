The following crashes Sage hard:

```
sage: i = CDF.0
sage: fz=animate([line([zeta(s+i*t) for t in srange(0,50,0.01)]) for s in srange(0,0.9,0.01)],xmin=-1.5,ymin=-2,xmax=2.5,ymax=2)
  ***   the PARI stack overflows !
  current stack size: 16000000 (15.259 Mbytes)
  [hint] you can increase GP stack with allocatemem()

  ***   Error in the PARI system. End of program.
```

This looks good, and the following change means that our eta function now agrees with Mathematica (and PARI as well)


```
-            sage: CDF(10^15,0.1).eta()     # slightly random-ish arch dependent output
-            -0.121339721991 - 0.19619461894*I   
+            sage: CDF(10^15, 0.1).eta()  # abs tol 1e-10
+            -0.115342592727 - 0.19977923088*I
