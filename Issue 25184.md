This is very strange

factorial(18446744073709551616)
```

Hi Vincent,

LGTM. Some minor remarks though:


```

```


Missing space.


```
         one it is the product of every k-th terms down from self to
-        k. The recursive definition is used to extend this function to
+        1. The recursive definition is used to extend this function to

Maybe move the 1 to the previous line.


```
+                try:
+                    res = method()
+                except Exception:
+                    pass
```


Are you sure you want to catch all exceptions? I think `ValueError` and `ArithmeticError` should be enough.

Here I just wanted to catch the `OverflowError` from factorial...

I'm not sure I understand your reply. Isn't that a reason to restrict the exceptions you are catching? (Note that `OverflowError` is a subclass of `ArithmeticError`.)

(And why did you remove the definition of the multifactorial in the last commit?)

Not always a good thing to work late at night :-)

Works with the restricted version. I am happy with it.
