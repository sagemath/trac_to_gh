Keywords: Integrable Representations, Twisted Affine Lie Algebras

This ticket will continue the support for integrable representations of affine Lie algebras by implementing the twisted affine cases. The untwisted cases were implemented in #15806 and #18398. See also #18000.

Valentin Buciumas has figured out what needs to be done to get the code working for the twisted affine case.

I've done my reviewer changes, and I obtained some good speed improvements:

```
sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',5,2]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[0]+Lambda[1]+Lambda[3])
sage: %time V.print_strings()
...
CPU times: user 3.14 s, sys: 28.5 ms, total: 3.16 s
Wall time: 3.11 s

sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',8,2]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[0]+Lambda[3])
sage: %time V.print_strings()
...
CPU times: user 8.66 s, sys: 44.2 ms, total: 8.7 s
Wall time: 8.66 s
```

Before:

```
sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',5,2]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[0]+Lambda[1]+Lambda[3])
sage: %time V.print_strings()
...
CPU times: user 3.6 s, sys: 35.7 ms, total: 3.64 s
Wall time: 3.57 s

sage: Lambda = RootSystem(['A',8,2]).weight_lattice(extended=true).fundamental_weights()
sage: V = IntegrableRepresentation(Lambda[0]+Lambda[3])
sage: %time V.print_strings()
...
CPU times: user 10 s, sys: 68.6 ms, total: 10.1 s
Wall time: 10 s
```

If you happy with my changes, then you can set a positive review.
