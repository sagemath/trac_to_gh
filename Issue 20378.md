There are at least _some_ [formulas for Bessel derivatives with respect to order](http://dlmf.nist.gov/10.38), though [some of their forms](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/4019/derivate-bessel-function-with-respect-to-order) are not particularly [helpful](http://functions.wolfram.com/Bessel-TypeFunctions/BesselK/20/01/01/) without some other things working properly like series of digammas (apparently).

Thanks to Grant Ellis for [this link](http://blog.wolfram.com/2016/05/16/new-derivatives-of-the-bessel-functions-have-been-discovered-with-the-help-of-the-wolfram-language/) and paper title with some information on more derivatives:

> Higher derivatives of the Bessel functions with respect to the order
