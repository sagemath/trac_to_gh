Branching rules for Lie groups are mostly already implemented in `weyl_characters`. That is, if G is a Lie group and H a subgroup (maximal without loss of generality) we can compute the branching rule from `G => H` in most cases, always if G is of classical type, and sometimes if G is an exceptional group.

The branching rule `F4 => B4` seems to be broken. One purpose of this ticket is to fix this.

The following rules are not implemented yet. The other purpose of these is to implement the four
rules `G => G2 x H` where `G=F4,E6,E7,E8` and `H=A1,A2,C2,F4`. The remaining 15 unimplemented may be implemented in later tickets.


```
E6 => C4 , A2 , G2 , A2xG2
E7 => A2 , A1 , A1 , A1xF4 , G2xC3 , A1xG2 , A1xA1
E8 => G2xF4 , C7 , A1xA2 , A1 , A1 , A1                                                           
F4 => A1 , A1xG2

The principal changes for this ticket are listed above. This comment contains a list of other less important changes.

In both the thematic tutorial and the docstring, hand written rules are discussed. It is omitted to say that the rule should map the positive Weyl chamber into the positive Weyl chamber. The doc should be revised on this point. (It is not *necessary* for the rule to map dominant weights into the positive Weyl chamber but it is desirable.)

In thematic tutorial and docstring, we should explain how to branch `B_r => D_r` and `D_r => B_{r-1`}. This should
go in the section orthogonal-and-symplectic-subgroups-of-orthogonal-and-symplectic-groups of the thematic tutorial.
The r=4 case should be used as an example.

Some doctests in weyl_characters are marked "long time" with obsolete timing information. For example the doctest [F4(fw).branch(B3,rule="levi") for fw in F4.fundamental_weights()] is given with the timing information 36s. This takes less than a second on my laptop. These misleading timings should be removed.

Branching (rule="levi") from E6 to A5 currently returns an error message, but this branching rule should be implemented.

Branching from composite type needs work: for example, branching from AxB to A or B should be implemented.

Is there an easy way to apply a `BranchingRule` to a representation (i.e. a `WeylCharacterRing.element_class`)? This seems like it would be one of the most common use cases:

```
sage: rule = branching_rule("A3", "C2", "symmetric")
sage: rep = WeylCharacterRing("A3")(1,0,0,0)
sage: rule.branch(rep)   # does not exist
sage: rep.branch(rule)   # does not work
sage: rule(rep)          # somewhat unexpected result
[0, 0]
```

The only thing I can come up with is the slightly awkward

```
sage: rep.branch(WeylCharacterRing(rule.Stype()), rule=rule)
C2(1,0)
```

The `BranchingRule.__call__` could check for the parent of the argument and simply return the branched representation.

Hopefully all branching rules to maximal subgroups are either implemented or
constructable as plethysms, but branching to a nonmaximal Levi may or may not
be implemented. For example, one of the G2 Levi's is implemented, the other not.
(Neither Levi is a maximal subgroup.)

I'll have to correct the documentation per your comment.

> sage: rep.branch(rule)   # does not work

You do need to construct the `WeylCharacterRing` you are branching to. The following works.

```
sage: br = branching_rule("A3", "C2", "symmetric")
sage: [A3,C2] = [WeylCharacterRing(x,style="coroots") for x in ["A3","C2"]]
sage: rep=A3(1,0,0,0); rep
A3(1,0,0)
sage: rep.branch(C2, rule=br)
C2(1,0)
```


> sage: rule.branch(rep)   # does not exist

It does seem like an excellent idea for `branch` to also be a method of the branching rule and I'll try to implement that.
