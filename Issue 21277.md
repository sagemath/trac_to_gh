Thierry, do you have preliminary code?

Would it be possible to have some basic help message including examples:


```
$ sage -rst2ipynb -h
usage: rst2ipynb [-o OUTPUT] [-k KERNEL] [-v] [-d] [input]
rst2ipynb: error: unrecognized arguments: -h
```


like


```
$ sage -rst2sws -h
Usage: 

    sage -rst2sws [options] <source> <destination>

Generates Sage worksheet (.sws) from standalone reStructuredText source.

Example:

    sage -rst2sws file.rst file.sws

Remarks:

    About LaTeX:

        You can put LaTeX expression between backticks "`", dollar signs
        "$" or double dollar signs "$$". Math role is not supported yet
        (get involved!).

        Examples: `\\alpha`, $\\beta$ or $$\\gamma$$.

    About backslashes:

        In reStructuredText, backslashes must be escaped, otherwise they
        are ignored. This is not quite practical for Sage's purposes
        since backslashes are never escaped in the docstrings. If you
        write `\alpha`, $\beta$ or $$\gamma$$, add the line

            ..  escape-backslashes

        to the file and this script will consider all backslashes
        escaped. Alternatively, you may use the available options.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --escape-backslashes  Escape all backslashes in the input file before
                        execution. Default: disabled.
  --no-escape-backslashes
                        Disable escaping all backslashes in the input file
                        before execution. This overrides the presence of the
                        line '.. escape-backslashes' in the file, which can
                        also be used to escape all backslashes in the file.
```

Sorry for the miscoordination; there was a unique occasion (Sage Days 79 are finishing just now) to sprint with Sébastien with fast face-to-face discussions to polish the details. But you are right, I should have asked for confirmation on your side.

For the record: I just pushed on the rst2ipynb github repo the following changes:
- rst2ipynb -h documentation
- experimental support for Python (continuation) prompts (Sébastien: please try and shake!)
- support for rst2ipynb input output

I let you decide whether you prefer to include that in #21513 and update #21513 accordingly or leave that for later. In the first case, I'll do a new release of rst2ipynb. I'll be on and off the network the next three days, but should be able to squeeze that within 24 hours after notice.

Dear Thierry, Nicolas,

After thinking about this, I suggest to merge into Sage the commit `017ecb7681c0159927cf8c5e6bf15391c651056e` which does not include Thierry's commit `​c0fe2a0`. Indeed, I asked for some nice help `sage -rst2ipynb -h` message, but after reconsideration I believe this is not the role of the bash code to do this. For the same reason as `sage -ipython -h` will give you the same thing as `ipython -h`. Therefore, I suggest to postpone the better help message to another ticket which will consist in updating `rst2ipynb` to a new version.

I wait for your approval before to do any change on this ticket.

(Git question: no branch are pointing to the commit `017ecb7681`, do I have to create a branch that links to this commit, or is the commit hash enough?)
