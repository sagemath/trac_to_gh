Keywords: unit group

The following choice of generators for two trivial groups is somewhat inconsistent:

```
sage: Zmod(1).unit_gens()
(0,)
sage: Zmod(2).unit_gens()
()
```

It would be better to use the empty set as a set of generators for the unit group of `Zmod(1)` as well.

The main adaptation that this requires is that `DirichletGroup(1).0` no longer works (this group is also generated by the empty set) and needs to be changed to `DirichletGroup(1)[0]`.
