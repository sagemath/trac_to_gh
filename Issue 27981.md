# Issue 27981: fix awali installation procedure to provide files list

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28218

The uninstaller looks in `local/var/lib/sage/installed/awali-*`
for a list of files to unstall. However, it seems to contain no files:

```
{
    "package_name": "awali",
    "package_version": "1.0.2-190218",
    "install_date": "Sat Jul 20 10:44:01 BST 2019",
    "system_uname": "Linux hilbert 5.1.12-gentoo #1 SMP Fri Jun 21 19:27:38 BST 2019 x86_64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6600U CPU @ 2.60GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux",
    "sage_version": "SageMath version 8.9.beta2, Release Date: 2019-07-10",
    "test_result": "",
    "files": [
        
    ]
}
```

I suspect `cmake` in spkg-install of awali should be `sdh_cmake`. Checking if it helps now.

one needs to double-check if all the files installed are actually removed.
I can confirm that most are removed by `make awali-clean` after installing it with this patch applied.

Could you double check that `awalipy` also get uninstalled? (there are 3 files in site-packages, a `.so`, a `.py` and an egg). The install procedure of `awalipy` uses distutils (which does not provide any uninstall procedure).

no, it doesn't get uninstalled, `local/lib/python*/site-packages/awalipy*` files still linger on. And they are not listed in `local/var/lib/sage/installed/awali-*`.

One way around it would be to add `spkg-legacy-uninstall` file, although, strictly speaking, simply removing these files there is not completely kosher.
(Although `spkg-legacy-uninstall` does this kind of removal).

I read somewhere that `distutils2` have an uninstall feature, but I have no idea what `distutils2` is.

Sorry, `spkg-legacy-uninstall` won't work (it only is called if there is no `files` field in the JSON file `local/var/lib/sage/installed/awali-*`, but we do get `files` field, it's just these `awalipy` files are not present there.

Perhaps Erik can comment on this, it looks to me like a bug in `sdh_make_install`...

I have no idea what this package is, but it sounds like it just doesn't fully perform a [DESTDIR](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html) installation properly.

Whatever you do you just need to make sure that when the package is "installed" it correctly installs all files to the temporary root given by SAGE_DESTDIR (most of the `sdh_` commands take care of this automatically, for packages that do things in a standard way).

Your package should not be installing files directly into `SAGE_LOCAL`.  If it's doing that then its build script is wrong.

it uses cmake, and one needs to supply the installation prefix to it. everything is done with sdh_ scripts, so it could be an upstream bug, or an sdh_cmake bug...

I don't have time right now to look at it in detail, but just from a quick glance of its CMakeLists.txt it is doing some complicated customizations that definitely don't seem to support DESTDIR-like installs.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
