Does this conflict with #34535 (which is just waiting on a patchbot to get to it before being at a positive review)?

I guess that it will, indeed. Damn.

ok, no longer conflicting as not touching the same file

If you can pull back those changes on top of #34535, and if the patchbot then passes here, I would simply set both as a positive review.

#34535 is now positively reviewed. What do you want to do for this ticket?

Comment by chapoton created at 2022-09-19 14:02:20

I made so that there is no conflict, so the tickets are independant now

I wasn't sure if you wanted to just bring back in your other changes (if you still had them somewhere) and just resolve the conflict here and now.

Anyways, positive review. If you want to bring the other changes back, then I can easily re-review.
