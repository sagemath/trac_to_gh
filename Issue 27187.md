I don't think it's a good idea to define new neighbor iterators in this file.
It might be better to properly extend the functionalities of `neighbors` and `neighbor_iterator`.

Also, your method `neighbors_of_a_set` do the same as `.vertex_boundary()`, except that it returns a set instead of a list.

Thanks for the comments.

Currently I assume that the vertices of the input graph are sortable, in order for some procedure to have deterministic output, which is required for the correctness of the algorithm. The procedure removes vertices one by one in increasing order until a property is met.

Is there a fast and easy way to sort the vertices in any case, for instance using some integer used internally to represent a vertex? Otherwise I could define an arbitrary order at the beginning, but that looks cumbersome.
Or can I assume that `.vertices()` always returns the vertices in the same order? (I guess not.)

method `_peel`
- as you mix sets and lists in the output. Use sets only
- instead of `set(G.vertices())`, use `set(G)`. No need to sort here
- `peeling = [(None, G.vertices())]` should be `(None, set(G))]`, right ?
- `while H.order() > 0:` -> `while H:`

Some parts can be simplified like:

```diff
-            for L in tree_search(H, plng, dom, i + 1):
-                yield L
+            yield from tree_search(H, plng, dom, i + 1)
```


I'm really not in favor of adding new vertex iterators methods. Instead, you could add parameter `closed=True/False` to `neighbor_iterator` and `vertex_boundary`.

Now, concerning the sorting, and in view of your code, you could relabel your graph and use the mapping before returning the result. Then, you can sort integers safely if needed.

```
int_to_vertex = list(G)
vertex_to_int = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(int_to_vertex)}
G = G.relabel(perm=vertex_to_int)
...
for dom in tree_search(G, peeling, set(), 0):
    # we generate the leaves of the search tree that are descendant of (empty set, 0)
    yield dom[0], {int_to_vertex[i] for i in dom[1]}
```

- why adding `lazy_import("sage.graphs.domination", "minimal_dominating_sets")` in `src/sage/graphs/all.py` ? I think that `minimal_dominating_sets` should be a method of `Graph`.

- a possible error that prevent to build the doc

```diff
-    r'''
+    r"""
```

and of course the block ends with `"""` and not `'''`.

- In `minimal_dominating_sets`, please document more precisely the input parameters. What's the goal of `to_dominate` ? `work_on_copy` ?

- please revert modifications in `src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py`. These modifications introduce trailing white spaces...

- in `is_dominating` input parameters and documented parameters are not the same. Futhermore, you should be more explicit that by default we want to dominate the vertices of `self`.
  For instance

```
Check whether ``p_dominating`` is a dominating set of ``self``.

When ``p_dominates`` is specified, check instead if ``p_dominating``
 dominates the vertices in ``p_dominates``.
```


  I'm not convince by the choice of the names `p_dominating` and `p_dominates`.

- in `is_redundant`, you should define `has_private` as a set, and add it `dominator[v][1]` in the `for v in focus` loop. Then, you just have to check if `has_private != dom`.

The code has been greatly improved but I still have some comments. Sorry for that.

- We can improve the readability

+        """
```




- in `is_dominating`:

```diff
-        Check if a set is a dominating set.
+        Check whether ``dom`` is a dominating set of ``self``.
```

and you can remove that sentence from the output block. Actually, the output block is not necessary, and you could just say in the description of the method that this method can be used to check whether `dom` dominates a subset of vertices of the graph.

- you can simply do

```diff
-        return to_dom == set()
+        return not to_dom
```


- since you assume that `focus` has no repeated verices, you should better use a `set`. The test `v in focus` will be faster`.

- a simpler version

```diff
-        dominator = dict()
-        for v in focus:
-            dominator[v] = (0, None)  # Initialization
+        # Initialization
+        dominator = {v: (0, None) for v in focus}
```



- I suggest the following simplification (the text can be improved)

```diff
-        # Now we can compute with_private, the set of vertices of dom
-        # that have a private neighbor in focus
-        with_private = set()
-        for v in focus:
-            # Here we do care neither about vertices dominated by more
-            # than one vertex of dom (they are not private neighbor of
-            # anybody) nor about vertices not dominated by dom (idem).
-            if dominator[v][0] == 1:
-                # If v is dominated only by one vertex x,
-                # then v is a private neighbor of x
-                with_private.add(dominator[v][1])
+        # We now compute the subset of vertices of dom that have a
+        # private neighbor in focus. A vertex v in dom has a private
+        # neighbor in focus if it is dominated by a unique vertex,
+        # that is if dominator[v][0] == 1
+        with_private = {dominator[v][1] for v in focus is dominator[v][0] == 1}
```


- why not doing this:

```diff
-        return (neighbor
-                for neighbor in self.neighbor_iterator(vertex, closed=True)
-                if neighbor not in closed_neighborhood_vs)
+        return set(self.neighbors(vertex, closed=True)).difference(closed_neighborhood_vs)
```
