Burcin, are you sure that the source is not shown? The source actually is


```
class PowerSeriesRing_domain(PowerSeriesRing_generic, integral_domain.IntegralDomain):
      pass
```


The only problem is that there may be no line break after the "pass", the doc string is appended immediately.

On the one hand, one may think that this ticket is invalid (because the source code *is* printed). However, there is no line break after the source code, which means that it is difficult to read. I suggest to keep the ticket and change the purpose into "add an appropriate line break".
