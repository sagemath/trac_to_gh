The code looks good. Let us wait for a patchbot to run on it.

No clue why the blocks patchbot complains. Docs build and look fine to me. 
Can you spot it?

If you look at the report, it is complaining about the `try :`, which should not have the space before the colon.

Also some very trivial formatting things since you'll want to make a push: 1) there are 2 blank lines before the `.. NOTE::` and 2) `Return the defining homomorphism into self.` should have ```self```.
