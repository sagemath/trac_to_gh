If you look at the report, it is complaining about the `try :`, which should not have the space before the colon.

Also some very trivial formatting things since you'll want to make a push: 1) there are 2 blank lines before the `.. NOTE::` and 2) `Return the defining homomorphism into self.` should have ```self```.
