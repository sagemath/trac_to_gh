gsl-2.5 does not pass self-tests on my 32bit VM.

Upstream report with log files: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gsl/2019-08/msg00005.html

Upgrading to 2.6 does not fix the issue.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

There is still an error in `gsl-2.7` regarding `multifit_nlinear` test-suite.
