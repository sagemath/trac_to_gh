Currently, the pretty printing of tableau does not work with entries with more than 3 digits:

```
sage: T = Tableau([[1523, 1, 2],[1,12341, -2]])
sage: T.pp()
1523  1  2
  112341 -2
```

We fix that here.

use instead `.reverse` ?

compute the widths before doing the French reversion ? otherwise T_str[0] may be short ?
