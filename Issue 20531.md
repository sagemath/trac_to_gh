Currently, the pretty printing of tableau does not work with entries with more than 3 digits:

```
sage: T = Tableau([[1523, 1, 2],[1,12341, -2]])
sage: T.pp()
1523  1  2
  112341 -2
```

We fix that here.

I also went through and updated all of the places `pp` was called so the output matched exactly, which is why there are so many changes.

* maybe in

```
str_tab = reversed(str_tab)
```

use instead `.reverse` ?

* maybe in 

```
+        str_tt = [T._repr_diagram().split('\n') for T in self]
+        if TableauTuples.global_options('convention') == "French":
+            for T_str in str_tt:
+                T_str.reverse()
+        widths = [len(T_str[0]) for T_str in str_tt]
```

compute the widths before doing the French reversion ? otherwise T_str[0] may be short ?
