Currently, the pretty printing of tableau does not work with entries with more than 3 digits:

```
sage: T = Tableau([[1523, 1, 2],[1,12341, -2]])
sage: T.pp()
1523  1  2
  112341 -2
```

We fix that here.

I also went through and updated all of the places `pp` was called so the output matched exactly, which is why there are so many changes.

* maybe in

use instead `.reverse` ?

* maybe in 

```

compute the widths before doing the French reversion ? otherwise T_str[0] may be short ?
