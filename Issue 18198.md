Pari test diff file (rnfkummer-dyn.dif is identical)

I assume this is on `arando`?

I seem to get a lot of failures with that snapshot on x86_64

```
        compat-sta.dif
        elliptic-sta.dif
        ellpadic-sta.dif
        factor-sta.dif
        factormod-sta.dif
        help-sta.dif
        ideal-sta.dif
        linear-sta.dif
        mathnf-sta.dif
        nffactor-sta.dif
        nfields-sta.dif
        rnf-sta.dif
        whatnow-sta.dif
        compat-dyn.dif
        elliptic-dyn.dif
        ellpadic-dyn.dif
        factor-dyn.dif
        factormod-dyn.dif
        help-dyn.dif
        ideal-dyn.dif
        linear-dyn.dif
        mathnf-dyn.dif
        nffactor-dyn.dif
        nfields-dyn.dif
        rnf-dyn.dif
        whatnow-dyn.dif
```

It looks like it is all about formatting of the output. Extra space here different line break there. Am I doing something wrong?

No idea, but it works for me. You should probably send the diffs.

I get exactly the same pulling git master so I will.

One possible explanation would be a broken GCC. You should try a different version (or build Sage with `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes`)

I don't believe a broken compiler would produce formatting error where things are of by one space. But I have a suspect, I have been running my tests on gentoo - and usually for something like pari there is no difference compared to sage - but I recently upgraded to gmp 6.0.0a because of a stupid dependency. I am willing to bet that's the culprit.

Looks good, and PARI test suite and Sage doctests pass on 32-bit ARM with GNU/Linux.  I didn't check whether the test suite used to fail on the same machine, though.  [Edit: I just checked, and it did fail.]
