Did you check the documentation output? I am a bit worried about the docstrings with `\*` in them (e.g., `act_on_polynomial()`).

It displays `f(self*x)`.

However, I realize that this ticket changes some `"""` to `r"""` in some cdef and coded functions which are not in the html documentation. Is it really needed ? I assume it does not hurt.

Good, I was just being paranoid. Thanks. Yes, that's fine, and it makes it easier if they ever get included in the public doc.
