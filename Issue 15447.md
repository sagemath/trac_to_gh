# Issue 15447: Remove support for SAGE_FORTRAN

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

In order to simplify the build system, let's remove support for `SAGE_FORTRAN` and `SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB`. These environment variables have been deprecated since Sage 5.3 (more than a year).

Looks ok.

Maybe a little too much removal in the rubiks install script but that's also for obscure stuff, so I don't mind.
