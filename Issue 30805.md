Keywords: sd111

(split out from #30930)

Although `pandoc` is installed in the system and is correctly detected by `./configure`, it recommends installing it anyway.

This is due to the duplication of `pandoc` in the `_recommended` spkg.

In this ticket, we remove this duplication.  As a result, when the system package is installed, `./configure` will no longer recommend installing it.

We add pandoc separately to the autogenerated part of the documentation that is about "recommended system packages".

what made (?) a difference in a previous beta might not be needed any more,
