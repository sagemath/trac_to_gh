hmm, shouldn't we have a generic function to build a graph from a 2-intersection code?
(you basically have it in the body already...)

We can have one if you feel like adding it. What I fear the most is writing the doc, personally... e.g. define it properly.

So as it is only used once for the moment.

I really would want a properly documented generic function. As you just wrote this code, you know what it does, and I don't. I'd help with improving the doc, no problem...

Here are my last 30 minutes, just because you requested it.

Since you wanted an independent function, there are holes that you can help fill: the matrix is currentl a matrix of homogeneous coordinates but the zeroes must not be anywhere (if I remember correctly), and that needs to be explained properly. There is also an obvious need of a doctest.

Feel free to change the function's arguments if you do not want a matrix but something else instead.

please have a look at the public/19311 trac git branch.
The last commit is the fix/docs etc. If you are happy with it please make it
into positive reviewed one.

for the record, GQs of type `T_2*(O)` are a case of this construction (for `O` a 0-2 intersection set in PG(2,q)). This ought to be unified, eventually.
