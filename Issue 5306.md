CC:  @loefflerd mtaranes

Following #4688 which wrapped the pari functions ideallog and idealstar, we need to provide functions which access these cleanly from Sage's NumberField and NumberFieldFractionalIdeal classes.

Maite Aranes and John Cremona are working on this and will post a patch based on 3.3 + #4688.

The patch applies cleanly to 3.4.1.rc1, and all tests in sage/rings/number_field pass. However, there is a trivial little problem: the documentation won't build -- Sphinx crashes on trying to read number_field_ideal.py. The obvious suspect is the accented character in Maite Aranes' name in the docstring for invertible_residues_mod_units. It processes fine with the accent removed.

Also: a pedantic docstring issue -- for invertible_residues_mod_units, the docstring says: "Returns an iterator through a list of invertible residues modulo the integral ideal self and the list of units u." Firstly, I don't think that's very clear -- there's a confusion between residue classes and representatives for them. Secondly, does the list of units need to be a subgroup? I suggest: "Returns an iterator through a set of representatives for the units modulo the integral ideal self and the subgroup generated by the list of units u".

Similarly I'm not very happy with the docstring for "reduce": from what it says, one might expect to get back an element of some quotient ring structure. It should probably say something closer to what the Pari documentation says, i.e. something like "Given an element `f` of the ambient number field, find an element `g` such that `f - g` belongs to the (integral) ideal self, and `g` is small." I think that's a better explanation of what it's actually doing, particularly since it isn't generally the case that I.reduce(x) is one of the representatives returned by I.residues() (if x is non-integral but coprime to I). It might even be worth adding the remark that reduced representatives aren't necessarily unique into the docstring.

These are only very small glitches, though; with these fixed I'd be happy to give a positive review.

At risk of being really ridiculously pedantic: there's a typo in the new docstring for invertible_residues_mod_units (and invertible_residues): "represnting".

Also, as for our terminological confusion, I think that the whole thing can be explained more clearly by *not* distinguishing between "units" and "invertible residues". You're clearly thinking of taking the quotient of a local unit group by the image of a subgroup of the global units; but the function as coded here works perfectly well for finding any quotient of the form (O_K / I)^* / U where U is an arbitrary subgroup of (O_K / I)^*. E.g.


```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x - 1)
sage: I = K.ideal(5)
sage: list(I.invertible_residues_mod_units([4]))
[1, 2]
```


The fact that 4 isn't a unit in K is no problem. And this makes it easier to avoid getting tied up in terminological knots: we can now just drop all mention of "units", and call it "invertible_residues_mod", with the docstring

"Returns an iterator through a set of representatives for the group of invertible residues modulo this ideal, modulo the subgroup generated by the elements in the list u."

I think I've tortured you (and Maite) enough now: I'll write a patch myself for this change, and if you agree it's OK we'll call it a +ve review. 

(I'll also fix a micro-bug: the invertible_residues function ignores its second argument -- it always calls invertible_residues_mod_units with reduce = True.)
