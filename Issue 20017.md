Keywords: p-adic L-functions

There are a few issues about p-adic L-function for elliptic curves. One is that the coefficient ring of supersingular series should be an p-adic Eisenstein field rather than a quotient field.

Changing keywords from "p-adic L-functions" to "days71, p-adic L-functions".

Is the coefficient ring issue resolved by #20244?  What other changes should be made for p-adic L-functions of elliptic curves?

Oh, there is a lot to do, I discovered. 
The #20244 will be independent as I will call extension directly rather than `root_field`.

The main issue is the normalisation for p-adic L-function involving negative modular symbols. They are used when a quadratic twist is used and that happens even for `E.sha().an_padic(p)`. I am close to resolving this.

The major outstanding issue that I will not change here is #4656 which makes some coefficients (with negative precision sometimes) disappear from the series.

This is ready for review.

Apart from cosmetic changes in documentation and code, this does the following

* The negative modular symbols are now correctly normalised. `[r]^-` is the quotient of the imaginary part of `2 pi i int_oo^0 f(z)dz` by the imaginary part of the period on the imaginary axis with smallest positive imaginary part.

* The output of a `series` for a supersingular p-adic L-function is now an element in the Eisenstein ring generated by the root of the Frobenius polynomial. In particular, they are printed alpha-adically.

Some minor remarks:
* You added a few chunks of commented out code. These should be removed I guess. If they can't then there should at least be a comment what they are about.
* `_poly()` has no complete docstring (in particular no doctests)
* You need to set your author in the ticket

Without understanding all the details, everything else seems alright. Feel free to set to postitive review yourself once you adressed the above.

Thanks Julian. I tested all long again and it was fine.

Doctests fail (just as in the patchbot, click on the yellow questionmark in the ticket description)

I can't work on this for a week at least. The resolution is that the file `padic_lseries.py` should be the one in this branch.

I have changed old style doctests ("...") in ell_modular_symbols.py to the new style ("....:"). This should turn the patchbot greener.
