doc does not build, because `hecke_eigenvalue_field` is not formatted properly.

EDIT: same problem in random_element

* please avoid using $ signs, use backticks ``` instead

* missing `::` in the doc of `isomorphic_order`

* in `random_element` doc, wrong position and formatting for `OUTPUT:`, that should be before the examples.
