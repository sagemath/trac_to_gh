Keywords: tolerance doctest

When testing the file

```
"""
EXAMPLES:

The name blah is undefined::

    sage: blah+blah
    blahblah

Here's a doctest that is out of tolerance::

    sage: 100+10000000000 # abs tol 0.1
    10000000000
    sage: 1+1
    2
"""
```

I get

```
File "/Users/marcostreng/tmp/test.sage", line 6:
    sage: blah+blah
Out of tolerance 10000000000.0 vs 10000000100.0
```

So the error of "blah is undefined" is not printed, while the "out of tolerance" is printed for the wrong test.

Also, there is a bug when a test with tolerance is the last test:

```
"""
EXAMPLES:

Doctests with tolerance cannot be followed by empty lines::

    sage: 100+10000000000 # rel tol 0.1
    10000000000
"""
```

yields

I consider this a feature, not a bug. If we're going to allow arithmetic expressions, where do we draw the line?


```
sage: 1e16    # rel tol 1e-10
100000000^2
sage: 1e16    # rel tol 1e-10
4e15 + 6e15
sage: 1e16    # rel tol 1e-10
solve(1e16 - x, x)[0].rhs()
```


There is also the advantage of being able to write


```
sage: "%g is less than %g" % (sqrt(2), pi)   # rel tol .01
'1.41 is less than 3.14'
```


which is possible because we do a match on floating point literals.

+1 (for the reasons Robert mentions)

Jeroen, could appropriately change the documentation in [trac_13899-doctest-rebase.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/13899/trac_13899-doctest-rebase.patch)?
