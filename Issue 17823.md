Bonsoir Nadia,

I do not quite understand why you opened this new ticket. Is it exactly the same purpose as for ticket #16935? Furtheromre, in this ticket there seems to be a problem with the branch field which does not appear in the ticket description.

Vincent

This is a duplicate of #16935. Creating a new branch does not need the creation of a new ticket!
