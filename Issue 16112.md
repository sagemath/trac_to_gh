Keywords: UniqueFactory pickle

Currently `UniqueFactory`'s unpickling protocol is to call `generic_factory_unpickle()`, whose first argument *must* be an instance of `UniqueFactory`. However we might want to change the object in the global namespace, let's say to a function, and then we will not be able to unpickle any  thing beforehand (`register_unpickle_override` can not help here because the pickle info is `(UniqueFactory`, `generic_factory_unpickle)`). Came up in #15289.

Travis, you have been inserted as "Author", but I think you did not provide code. So, I took the liberty to replace your name by mine, and attach a branch. The new doctest demonstrates how to replace a unique factory by unique representation and correctly unpickle.

Okay I've just put in both versions. I've implemented something similar to `register_unpickle_override()` (which I've called `register_factory_unpickle()`). This way we can handle when the factory is removed from the global namespace (such as for name change). If you could check that and agree, then we can set this to positive review. Thanks.

With the current branch, we provide two ways to deal with old pickles of `UniqueFactory`: If we replace the old factory by something new that has the same name, is in the same module and can process the same input as the `UniqueFactory`, then nothing more needs to be done (that's my contribution). Moreover, it is possible to override unpickling so that a new callable is used for unpickling *even if the old factory is still there* (that's your contribution).
