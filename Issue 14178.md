#11498 made "ASCII-art" strings look reasonably well when displayed via LaTeX methods. One of the changes was damaged in #9774, resulting in invalid LaTeX code that works in MathJax, but not in SageTeX. Let's fix it again.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14382

You might want to have a look at #13624; it replaces \verb back to \text to help dot2tex. Not really your business, but maybe it would make sense to use \text in the easy cases, with no \phantom's? This is quite more readable!

With this patch, running `view(RubiksCube())` from the command line produces output in which the numbers are lined up, but the horizontal lines are too short: LaTeX is turning each pair of dashes `--` into an "en-dash". If you want to use this approach, maybe you need to use `{-}{-}` instead of `--`.

From the notebook, I don't see anything useful, but that may be specific to this machine. I'll try it on another machine eventually.

From SageTeX, it works, but it requires the package `amsmath` because of the `\text{...}` command. I'm not sure that's ideal.

Does anyone recall any reason to use `\text{\tt }` rather than `\texttt{ }`? The latter should be eventually supported by MathJax (i.e. they plan to do it) while the former is a more general problem of not supporting nested font switches or something like that. Directly from LaTeX it seems to be identical.

I am also puzzled by combining of dashes - it does not happen for hand-written code or via SageTeX, why does it happen for `view`???
