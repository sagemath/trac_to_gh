Keywords: division by zero, AA

Sometimes dividing by zero in AA results in returning an object which prints as

```
[-infinity .. +infinity]
```

Other times it the ZeroDivisionError is raised.

I am not sure what the "[-infinity .. +infinity]" object is and as far as I can tell there are no methods in AA to test for it, so my feeling is that this return is erroneous. I believe that dividing by zero should always be handled in a consistent way, which it is not as the following example illustrates:


```
sage: a = QQbar(1)
sage: b = QQbar(1+I)
sage: (b.imag()-a.imag())/(b.real()-a.real())
[-infinity .. +infinity]
sage: denom = b.real()-a.real()
sage: numer = b.imag()-a.imag()
sage: numer/denom
[-infinity .. +infinity]
sage: denom == 0
True
sage: numer == 1
True
sage: numer/denom
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
<
```


The above example clearly indicates that simply testing the value of variables in AA (which you would naively guess has no effect on their internal state) changes the outcome of division (by zero). Reminds me of quantum mechanics...

I think this is a significant issue because people unaware of the possibility of a [-infinity .. +infinity] return will not test for it.

There is a lazyness mechanism of the computations in `QQbar`, which does not compute (costly) exactifications unless it is required to save time, see for example:


```
sage: a = QQbar(2)
sage: b = a.sqrt()
sage: b
1.414213562373095?
sage: b^2
2.000000000000000?
sage: b^2 < 4       # this is fast because Sage does not need exactifying b^2 for deciding
True
sage: b^2
2.000000000000000?
sage: b^2 == 2      # this exact computation requires exactification, of course the better internal representation is kept for further computations
True
sage: b^2
```


I admit that in your case, an error is delayed, but i guess that in a "true" computation process, the error will happen anyway later. Exactifying to catch such error on-time might slow down every `QQbar` computation.

In case a division is performed, we must check for nonzeroness. Otherwise, we can easily end up with inconsistent results if automatic simplification happen later.
