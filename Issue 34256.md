Two little things:

```diff
-        Returns the family `( f(\mathtt{self}[i]) )_{i \in I}`, where
-        `I` is the index set of self.
+        Return the family `( f(\mathtt{self}[i]) )_{i \in I}`, where
+        `I` is the index set of ``self``.
 
         The result is again a :class:`TrivialFamily`.
 
         EXAMPLES::
 
             sage: from sage.sets.family import TrivialFamily
             sage: f = TrivialFamily(['a', 'b', 'd'])
             sage: g = f.map(lambda x: x + '1'); g
             Family ('a1', 'b1', 'd1')
         """
-        return Family(tuple(f(x) for x in self._enumeration), name=name)
+        return Family(tuple([f(x) for x in self._enumeration]), name=name)
```

(Don't ask me why the `tuple([x in foo])` is faster than `tuple(x in foo)`, but it is.)
