CC:  @vbraun @novoselt

The methods `span` and `span_of_basis` of `ToricLattice_generic` should work when given a `base_ring` and such a `base_ring` must be given whenever the elements of the basis are not integers.

This is needed in preparation of #17585, where

```
sage: N = ToricLattice(3)
sage: Ns = N.span_of_basis([(1,2,3)])
sage: Ns.span_of_basis([(2,4,0)])
Sublattice <N(2, 4, 0)>
sage: Ns.span_of_basis([(1/5,2/5,0), (1/7,1/7,0)])
```
will become an error, since the ring is assumed to be `ZZ` but the elements are actually rationals.

I don't think such complications are necessary and what exactly is the point of this ticket? The example from the descriptions currently gives

```
sage: sage: N = ToricLattice(3)
sage: sage: Ns = N.span_of_basis([(1,2,3)])
sage: sage: Ns.span_of_basis([(1/5,2/5,0), (1/7,1/7,0)])
Sublattice <(1/5, 2/5, 0), (1/7, 1/7, 0)>
```
and perhaps this can be claimed as a bug unrelated to any coming changes - there is nothing wrong with the span call on fractional vectors, but calling it a sublattice is strange/wrong (even if it looks to me that I am the one who allowed it). The solution should be, I think: try to return a sublattice and if it does not work because given vectors are not integral or a different ring is requested - return a free module with the same dimension etc.

In particular there will be no need to mess with the morphism code at all.

It is a bit unfortunate that we have

```
sage: N.change_ring(QQ) is N.dual().change_ring(QQ)
True
```
but fixing it is quite a bit of work, since basically I want named modules which are isomorphic but have no canonical isomorphism, as it is the case with ``N`` and ``N.dual()``.

What's wrong is this:

```
sage: N = ToricLattice(3)
sage: Ns = N.span_of_basis([(1,2,3)])
sage: M1 = Ns.span_of_basis([(1,2,0), (1,1,0)])
sage: type(M1.basis()[0])
<type 'sage.geometry.toric_lattice_element.ToricLatticeElement'>
sage: M2 = Ns.span_of_basis([(1/5,2/5,0), (1/7,1/7,0)])
sage: type(M2.basis()[0])
<type 'sage.modules.vector_rational_dense.Vector_rational_dense'>
```
You have a `ToricLattice_generic`, but the basis consists simply of rational vectors, having nothing to do with lattices. The fact that this does *not* raise an exception is a bug which I'm fixing in #17585: if `ToricLattice_generic` states `Element = ToricLatticeElement`, the module code shouldn't change this.

> The solution should be, I think: try to return a sublattice and if it does not work because given vectors are not integral or a different ring is requested - return a free module with the same dimension etc.

That *could* be a solution, but I prefer to be explicit. With my solution, you at least know and expect that the result won't be a toric lattice.

The span of given vectors over given field should either exist or not, and what it is should not depend on some strange keyword parameter whose existence is impossible to guess (and documenting them is not quite a solution - who will read `span` documentation for each class they use???

Toric lattices were designed to implement "named" copies of `ZZ^n` and their sublattices and (free) quotients. `Sublattice <(1/5, 2/5, 0), (1/7, 1/7, 0)>` or some generic toric lattice on these vectors most probably just should not exist.

My objection is to `toric` in `M.span(..., toric=True/False)` as obscure.

Whether it is OK to call `M.span(...)` for vectors not in `M` but in `M.change_ring(QQ)` is a more general question. Certainly it should be possible to make a module of integral combinations of rational vectors. The question is what should be the interface for it.

What exactly is the problem? I see two:
1. `N.span` works at all for elements that do not generate a submodule of `N`.
2. `N.span` for a toric lattice returns a non-toric thing.
But 1 is the way Sage works, so if it is changed it is better be changed everywhere and it will break a lot of user code too. As for 2 - writing custom classes for `N \otimes QQ` and its submodule would be useful, but is not the top priority for me personally and we managed to go a long way in toric stuff without implementing it...

Mainly the fact that the difference between returning a toric lattice and a free module is done very implicitly. In particular, there is no way to force the returning of a free module (as opposed to a toric lattice).

Sage is supposed to have the philosophy that the *type* of the output should only depend on the *type* of the input, not the *values* of the input.

In what situations will you **want** a non-toric output from a toric span? The reason for its current presence at all is that we don't have a toric implementation for the ambient vector space. One it is implemented, there will be no non-toric output at all. A technically clean resolution to it meanwhile is to raise `NotImplementedError` for some input, but I'd rather not.

I have no idea, I don't use this code, I only created this ticket because it broke #17585.
