* are you sure you need wrapping by list here:

```
+    N = list(range(n))
```

and there

```
+    classes = list(range(k))
```

and again later

* you should not remove this import

```
-from sage.numerical.mip import MIPSolverException
```

as it makes pyflakes unhappy

* This can be further simplified using `if not ...` :

```
+                    if len(list(set(classe) & set(g.neighbor_iterator(deg[-1])))) == 0:
```


* do not use `lambda` declarations, but functions:

```
E = lambda x,y : frozenset((x,y))
```

and the same in other frozen wrappers.

Thank you for the comments.
- about `list(range(...))`: If `range` becomes an iterator, then we can iterate only once on `classes`. Right ? I changed the code to use explicitly `range(k)`.

- I moved the import of `MIPSolverException` and `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` at the top of the file, and removed other imports.

> * This can be further simplified using `if not ...` :
- actually, we can do even better with 

```
if set(classe).isdisjoint(g.neighbor_iterator(deg[-1])):
```


 
> * do not use `lambda` declarations, but functions:
I did the modification (and will do in #26282, #26284, #26285), but what's the reason for that ?

Well, this a pep8 recommendation, so not anything important. No need to change it everywhere in other tickets.

You should not do the following, for keeping the coherence with other lines before and after it (this is not the first line of a docstring)
