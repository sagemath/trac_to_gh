See my comments on #10828 
I'm not saying this needs work, as it might not do, but if its anything like the matplotlib case, a lot of unnecessary files get copied. 

We should clarify this before marking this for review.

The mpmath docs contain just the standalone built files, not the full doc source directory.

See #11197 for building docs after Sage is built.
