In the "Upload worksheet" page, there's a box that says "Or enter the URL of a worksheet file on the web:" If you give that box an https URL, it fails if SSL is not available, both with the old Twistd notebook and the new Flask-based one.

Old notebook: fails with Internal Server Error.

Flask notebook: fails with blank page. The server log shows that 
urllib.py is throwing an IOError exception because it doesn't know how to handle 'https'.

If Sage wasn't built with SSL support, this should at least fail with a reasonable error message.
