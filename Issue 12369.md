Such a command is likely to be a mistake, but the error message is irrelevant and is triggered by using a function name `Sequence` in `isinstance`. The attached patch removes this test as sequences are instances of lists and are correctly recognized anyway.

sage: basis = eigen[0][1]
sage: basis

Sorry Rob, how about this alternative patch? It affects mostly the same lines, but instead of removing `Sequence` gets rid of this `isinstance` completely. My reasoning for this:
* the present tests are wrong as stated in the description: the condition is either True or raises a confusing exception, not the intended one;
* the same check is repeated all over the place in functions that do nothing with the input except passing it further down - this makes it difficult to get the real processing place and figure out what has to be done;
* `isinstance` in general is not encouraged in Python - in my situation I have a perfectly good class resembling a tuple and working flawlessly if I get rid of these checks (in fact, `PointCollection` can be more suitable as a container for bases of modules than `Sequence`, although I don't intend to push this direction);
* totally wrong input still will produce some exception, e.g. using dictionaries gives "no span for integers" message;
* all tests pass with this alternative patch.

If you agree with my reasons, I'd rather use this solution.

I find the error message in the doctest still somewhat cryptic.  Here's a simplified explanation of what happens:
    

```
sage: span(QQ, [0])            
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class' object has no attribute 'span'
```


It appears that the span() **function** in free_module.pyx  mostly tries to find an appropriate parent for the generators, and then hands everything off to the .span() **method** of the parent.

So here, the integer zero is construed to be the first generator, and the class of integers has no span method.

What do you think of checking if the first generator is a list, or if it is a free module element (`is_FreeModuleElement`), before proceeding with a supposed parent?  This would allow an informative error message, such as - "generators must be lists of ring elements, or free module elements"

I like the looks of the new version.  I did discover one problem.


```
sage: V = span(ZZ, [[1,2,3/4]])
sage: V
Free module of degree 3 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[  1   2 3/4]
```


I think this can be fixed by passing `R` into the final `span` method in the return (rather than `base_ring`.)  This should have been caught by the span method, which seems to be the real fault here, I've isolated that at #12688.

I might write a few more doctests for the span() function as part of final testing for this.

1.  I look at this ticket a bit more with an eye to merging it as-is.
2.  I add some documentation on #12688 extending this change.
