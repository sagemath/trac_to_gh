... such as homebrew's NTL (#29104).

Builds with NTL_THREADS breaks Singular (as observed in #29104).

The other checks are about performance degradation that we should not accept.

the wise thing is to enable TLS as much as possible, IMHO. The configuration with enabled TLS on NTL, pari, and flint used to work, IIRC.
