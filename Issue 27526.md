To simplify installation of polymake, we add some required CPAN packages. 

Including recursive dependencies, these are 103 packages, a total of 7.5 MB of source archives, which we pack up as the source tar ball of the new spkg `perl_cpan_polymake_prereq`.
The source tar ball (attached) also contains a copy of the self-contained `cpanm` Perl script, which is used for installing the packages.
If `SAGE_CHECK=no`, only about 35 packages are installed. The rest of the dependencies are for testing.

Using an `spkg-configure.m4`, it is downloaded and installed only if the Perl packages are not already present on the system.

The `spkg-install` installs the packages via the package dependencies mechanism. If some of the packages are already installed in some version on the system, we do not install a newer version.

To try out:

```
   wget -P upstream https://trac.sagemath.org/raw-attachment/ticket/27763/perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-2019-05-19.tar.gz
```

I'd suggest to have appropriate `spkg-configure.m4`, to avoid installing extra...

By the way, could you provide  `spkg-configure.m4` for `perl_term_readline_gnu`, and other already present as packages `polymake` deps (perl or not)?

Do you have a suggestion how to install these CPAN packages if they are not available?
There seems to be a large number of dependencies that each of the listed packages pulls in -- but probably many are "standard" on any system that has perl installed.

I have only used  `cpan -i`, which asks whether to install system wide or in the user's home directory.
Here's some info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/540640/how-can-i-install-a-cpan-module-into-a-local-directory

I used something like this for `perl_term_readline_gnu`, but this is not going through cpan.

I don't know, it seems one needs to setup some `local::lib` magic, otherwise I keep getting errors trying to to install into `/usr/local`.

`local::lib` is a Perl module that apparently allows one to use non-standard directories for module installation, it might not be in by default (e.g. it's not in Gentoo, one needs to install it).

Anyhow - for checking in autoconf which perl modules are installed, one can use [AX_PROG_PERL_MODULES](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/ax_prog_perl_modules.html)

polymake itself does check for the packages needed at build time in its configure script.
The MongoDB package is checked at run time of polymake for the optional polyDB feature.

```

The challenge in this ticket is to make the installation of missing Perl packages not depend on internet access.
Here's a possible approach.

First install `App::cpanminus`. 
Then 

```
cpanm --local-lib-contained $PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT --exclude-vendor --save-dists $PARTIAL_CPAN_MIRROR XML::Writer XML::LibXML XML::LibXSLT File::Slurp Term::ReadLine::Gnu JSON SVG MongoDB
```
will (1) download and install these prerequisites in $PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT,
(2) save the source packages in a directory tree $PARTIAL_CPAN_MIRROR.

These are 58 packages, a total of 5 MB of source archives, which we can pack up as the source tar ball of the new spkg `perl_cpan_polymake_prereq`. 

Then figure out how to install with plain `cpan` (not `cpanm`, which is not available out of the box on macOS) using this local partial CPAN mirror.

yes, I understand this, but I imagine the only conflicts of this sort are possible if you run polymake as a python extension, that loads a wrong dll at runtime.

As I don't know how the polymake interface works, I can't tell whether this is the case.

In any case, could you explain where these *.so parts of perl packages may be found, so that I can look at them with ldd/otool ?

Yes, I met `system package`.

Ok, so here is the outcome.

I ran the command 

`perl -e "use Term::ReadLine; Term::ReadLine->get_all_function_names"`

before uninstalling `perl_term_readline_gnu`: No output.

After uninstalling (inside of sage shell using the `sage-spkg-uninstall` command) I still get no output.

Things now seems to work flawlessly using the interface though.

Running `./configure`, I do check the `(configure check)`.

Ok, so now it seems to catch the system `Term ReadLine`. I believe I know how it happened: I did install the perl libraries using `cpan -i XML::Writer XML::LibXML XML::LibXSLT File::Slurp JSON SVG` as the `sage -info polymake` suggested, but then, the installation of the polymake package was not preceeded by a rerun of `./configure` to catch the libraries that are now meanwhile to be found in my PATH?

well, this is by (somewhat unfortunate) design. Once you updated ./configure by installing/updating a `spkg-configure.m4` file in build/pkgs/foo/
and you have foo installed in Sage and as a system package, the only way to switch from Sage-installed to system foo is to manually uninstall Sage's foo, and then re-run configure (othewise configure would check, and succeed in this, for Sage's foo first).

The main reason for that that some people do not want to retire the old `sage -f foo` as a way to install/update a package, see e.g. #27373...

For installing the modules, yes. But the `cpanm` script is fatpacked with all its prerequisite libraries, including `local::lib`.

For using the modules, no. We just modify the environment variable `PERL5LIB`.

A user would install local::lib into their local library by "bootstrapping" https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib#The-bootstrapping-technique

I have attached a log of a failed installation of polymake on macOS Mojave after pulling this ticket and doing the following steps.

- pulled the branch on this ticket
- downloaded the tarball perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-2019-05-19.tar.gz and put it in the upstream folder
- in upstream folder typed `rm perl_cpan_polymake_prereq_2019_05_13.tar.gz`
- in my sage directory typed `make build`
- typed `./sage -f perl_term_readline_gnu`
- typed `./sage -i polymake`

perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-2019-05-19 installed successfully.

why would you download the file, and then delete it? A typo?

I wonder why you have C++14 in your CXXFLAGS.
Do you by any chance have CXXFLAGS environment variable set to something non-empty?

From `sage -info polymake`:

```
On Mac OS X, to build Term::Readline::Gnu, on macOS 10.14 (Mojave), one
needs to do the following:

 sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /

or a "fatal error: 'EXTERN.h' file not found" will be signalled.
```

I think that you shouldn't have the build fail; you should instead test for the headers and provide a helpful error message if they're not present. I doubt that most users will know to use `sage -info polymake`.

Also, the error message is out-of-date: the current version of OS X is 10.15, and there is no directory `Packages` in `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/`.

After a clean installation of 9.1.beta2, running `sage -i polymake` finishes with success and installs both

- perl_cpan_polymake_prereq...............2019-05-19 (2019-05-19)
- perl_term_readline_gnu..................1.35 (1.35)

Now, trying out polymake in sage essentially does not work...

- Tab completion on `polymake.` does not work (which is an improvement, before it used to kill sage)
- If I type `c = polytopes.cube(backend='polymake')` it simply never finishes. Thought I can kill it succesfully with ctrl+c.

Starting sage anew and trying:
- `p = Polyhedron(vertices= [[0],[1]],backend='polymake')` also simply never gives back the prompt.

Without starting sage anew, if I simply repeat the previous operation, I get directly:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: argument should be integer or bytes-like object, not 'str'

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):

...

*That said*, I have to mention that I do not have jupymake installed which is an optional package:

jupymake................................0.9 (not_installed)

I wanted to try a simple "sage -i polymake" from a virgin install to see how it would perform...

My os is debian-buster. As far as the installation goes, it seems that polymake runs fine under `sage -polymake`...
