Keywords: spkg-configure; ECL; Maxima

I tried to use ECL and Maxima from system packages as suggested by #27330, but without success for the moment.

The spkg-configure.m4 are trivial (see attachments), but the problems occur during build:

In [dochtml] [manifolds] this error is produced:


```
	RuntimeError: ECL says: The function SET-LOCALE-SUBDIR is undefined
```


Actually this error is reproducible out of the Sage's build mechanism:



```
$ ecl
> (require 'maxima)
> (in-package :maxima)
MAXIMA> (set-locale-subdir)
Condition of type: UNDEFINED-FUNCTION
The function MAXIMA::SET-LOCALE-SUBDIR is undefined.
```


According to Maxima's code, set-locale-subdir is defined in src/init-cl.lisp and:


```
	     ;; If a file is declared as private-file it is loaded
	     ;; from the build tree (which makes an out-of-tree
	     ;; build possible), but not compiled (which means
	     ;; that with ECL or ABCL it won't end up in the final image)
	     ;; => no out-of-tree build for ECL.
```


Maybe someone with lisp-flu could patch it, if possible?

I ran into the same problem with `MAXIMA_FAS`, which should default to the `SAGE_LOCAL` path where the Maxima SPKG installs it.

I've worked around this in the latest commit but it's pretty ugly. I made the SPKG location the default again, undoing part of #26100. That works because `SAGE_LOCAL` is available in `env.py`.

But there are two other things you might want to set `MAXIMA_FAS` to: an unusual but correct path, and "no path." Setting it to the correct path is easy, but now "no path" is achieved by setting `MAXIMA_FAS = <junk>` in sage_conf, and counting on the fallback in `maxima_lib.py`.

I'm certainly open to other ideas. If we decide to keep the workaround, `@`arojas in particular should make sure I didn't mess anything up too badly for distro packages.

This passes tests with my system ECL and SPKG maxima on Gentoo.

Hi,
 Looks good as far as the Arch distro package is concerned. `ecl_eval("(require 'maxima \"{}\")".format(MAXIMA_FAS))` fails because the ecl modules are in the default upstream path `/usr/lib/ecl-${version}`, but then `ecl_eval("(require 'maxima)")` succeeds.

I would think (hope) that the current solution is more complicated than needed.

Distributions are able to install maxima in a way that a simple `(REQUIRE :MAXIMA)` works in ecl.
(Note that this is not just a search for a `maxima.fasl` but rather goes through `EXT:*MODULE-PROVIDER-FUNCTIONS*` into which system definition facilities such as MK:DEFSYSTEM or ASDF hook.)

If the Sage distribution has to install maxima, then we install the FASL in a custom directory and set the variable `MAXIMA_FAS` to the correct value in `sage_conf`. No defaults should be set in `env.py`.

Instead of the `try`/`except` in `maxima_lib.py`, just dispatch on empty/nonempty value of `MAXIMA_FAS`.

Kenzo is optional so I wouldn't guess as to when it stopped working. Some of its tests fail; for example, `sage/interfaces/kenzo.py` has


```

Digging deeper, I probably just broke kenzo with the ECL spkg.

Our ECL spkg bundles ASDF, and the bundled version works OK. But if the system copy of ECL is used and if that system copy does **not** bundle ASDF, then there's a backwards-incompatible API change in the ASDF `make-build` function which has been deprecated for a while (and now exists only for the sake of backwards-compatibility with ECL).

Ultimately the `make-build` function takes a `type` argument (was `:fasl` but I changed it to `:fasb`) and passes it to another function called `select-bundle-operation`. In the bundled copy of ASDF, it looks like


```cl
  ;; Find the operation that produces a given bundle-type                                                                                                                    
  (defun select-bundle-operation (type &optional monolithic)
    (ecase type
      ((:dll :shared-library)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-dll-op 'dll-op))
      ((:lib :static-library)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-lib-op 'lib-op))
      ((:fasl)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-compile-bundle-op 'compile-bundle-op))
      ((:image)
       'image-op)
      ((:program)
       'program-op)))
```


but in my unbundled ASDF, it's


```cl
  ;; Find the operation that produces a given bundle-type                                                                                                                    
  (defun select-bundle-operation (type &optional monolithic)
    (ecase type
      ((:dll :shared-library)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-dll-op 'dll-op))
      ((:lib :static-library)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-lib-op 'lib-op))
      ((:fasb)
       (if monolithic 'monolithic-compile-bundle-op 'compile-bundle-op))
      ((:image)
       'image-op)
      ((:program)
       'program-op))))
```


To avoid having to support both, one idea that comes to mind is that we could take a newer version of `asdf.lisp` and copy it over the bundled version in the ECL spkg. Then `:fasb` would work in both of the situations above. However it would still fail if the system ECL is using a bundled `asdf.lisp`. Patching kenzo's `compile.lisp` to try both is likely the only reliable way.

As we currently do not have plans to ship additional Common Lisp libraries in the Sage distribution, I think we should not do unbundling work on ECL but stick with upstream.

Yes, I agree, this seems to be the way to go. You can use `HANDLER-CASE` for this http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/m_hand_1.htm

Paging `@`mmcarco :o

* The original kenzo upstream is at https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Kenzo/
* Our SPKG points to https://github.com/gheber/kenzo
* The release itself comes from https://github.com/miguelmarco/kenzo/

The ASDF docs say that `program-op` and `program-system` should replace `make-build`. Those functions are available in the bundled copy of ASDF as well, so another good long-term option would be for kenzo upstream to switch to them (if possible).

To clarify this:

What we maintain (by "we" I mean Ana Romeno, Julian Cuevas, Jose Divason and myself) is a small fork of Kenzo, modified to be compatible with ECL, easier to install, and some extra features to allow a better interface with Sage.

I am not fluent in lisp myself, but will talk about this issues with the rest of the team. Maybe we can modify the package to make it more installation friendly.

I have done some tests on that. Might release a new version with this change in a few days, after some testing.

So, to make sure: can you confirm that changing from 



```
(asdf:make-build :kenzo :type :fasl :monolithic t :move-here #P".")
```


to 

```
(asdf:operate 'asdf:monolithic-compile-bundle-op :kenzo)
```


in the `compile.lisp` file would solve the problem?
