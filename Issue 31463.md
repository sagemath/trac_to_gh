# Issue 31463: eigenvalue defined in sage/matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx is incorrectly called in sage/modules/free_module_morphism.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31700

Original creator: @shashankbalaji02

Keywords: eigenvalues

In Sage 9.2, I encountered the following bug:


```
m = matrix([[1 - 2 * i, 2, 3 - i], [0, -1 + i, 4], [3, i, -1]])
t = linear_transformation(m)
t.eigenvalues()
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-c9bd1ed2c26c> in <module>
----> 1 t.eigenvalues()

~/sage/sage-9.2/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sage/modules/free_module_morphism.py in eigenvalues(self, extend)
    445         if self.base_ring().is_field():
    446             if self.is_endomorphism():
--> 447                 return self.matrix().eigenvalues(extend=extend)
    448             else:
    449                 raise TypeError("not an endomorphism")

TypeError: eigenvalues() takes no keyword arguments
```



The reason being, eigenvalue(self) defined in sage/matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx is called as eigenvalue(extend=extend) in sage/modules/free_module_morphism.py. Hence the argument mismatch.

Hello. The `Authors` field is intended for the person who contributes code to the git branch not the person who creates the report. Do you plan to fix the problem yourself?

Please add to the documentation that the keyword argument is ignored.
