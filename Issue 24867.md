```
sage: factor((x+1)^5-1)
(x^4 + 5*x^3 + 10*x^2 + 10*x + 5)*x
sage: L.<pi> = Qp(5).extension(x^4 + 5*x^3 + 10*x^2 + 10*x + 5)
sage: (pi+1).multiplicative_order()  # should be 5
+Infinity
```

Writing this implementation, I also noticed that the methods `zeta` and `zeta_order` are not implemented for extensions of `Qp`. But I think this is definitely for another ticket...
