This is basically undocumented and hence basically only used by the authors of the script.

Given that our git/trac workflow is such a hurdle to beginners and also apparently currently broken for new developers, it is critical that we document the more user-friendly GitLab MR workflow.

Some material from `workflows.rst` (forking etc.) can be adapted to provide the gitlab workflow

it seems that this workflow is semi-broken now, as it sort of needs a working [GitLab](GitLab) runner.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Closing this as there has been no interest in it.

If I am not mistaken, people working on p-adics often use that workflow.

Yes, we are using this workflow. You don't need a working runner for this workflow.
