I know, i hesitated between the two syntax and, as it is an `EXAMPLES::`, have think that the `# py2`-`# py3` syntax might be clearer for the end-user.

I don't have a strong opinion on it, tell me what you prefer. If the past cases you talk about are also `EXAMPLES::` we should stick with the `decode('ascii')` solution for consistency.

Yes, I think consistency is best.  There are a few other cases that also, rather than relying on the `repr`, just do like


```
sage: E.read() == b'Hello\r\n'
True
```


or whatever.  This will also work the same on Python 2 and 3.

I have thought of adding a helper to the test framework to deal with `b`-prefixed strings as it does with `u`-strings, but it turns out they are relatively uncommon in the majority of the test suite.

I think it is needed because on Python 2 `.decode(...)` will return a unicode string literal, and the doctest parser *does* treat this as relevant on Python 2.  The only thing it does w.r.t. u-prefixes is on Python 3 it strips them from the expected output.

I usually avoid the issue by using `print(...)` instead, but i think this is fine as-is.
