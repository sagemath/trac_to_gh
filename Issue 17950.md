The contents of sage/graphs/planarity_c is not Sage source but a copy of John Boyer's planarity code [1]. This branch turns it into a (standard) spkg.

A standard package. This code is already part of Sage.

Helloooooo,

> Well, the spkg is still not built by default (see `build/deps` and `build/install`).

Right! Fixed.

> Did you report your changes upstream?

No I didn't, and for two reasons:
1) What we have in Sage is apparently an old version of the files. When building the first version of this package (without autotools) I tried to use the new ones, but did not figure out how they should be compiled.

2) The makefiles this archive contains are only made to build everything as a shared library, while upstream also builds an independent executable and maybe some other things. They probably wouldn't like what I wrote.

I plan to do both, however, and I will start by sending them an email to ask whether they would accept such a pull request. Then I will try to figure out how to make it all work properly, and we will update our version of this package.

Okay, I thought that this was only a *part* of Nauty and that the author has negociated specific bits with Brendan McKay to have this license, but it seems that there is indeed a non-GPL compatible usage restriction (against military applications) in `nauty.h`.

That's twice in two days that I learn that a massive amount of work was done for naught.

Sorry for that. I will write to the author. And I guess we should go back to the initial sources (which do not include Nauty). And there is this malloc problem to solve.
