This should return `-I`, not `I`:

```
sage: K.<j> = QuadraticField(-1, embedding=CC(0,-1))
sage: SR(j)
I
```

Works under Sage 9.2, so maybe related to

Indeed, the following method on gaussian integers looks bad

Hmm, if I remember right, the `GaussianInteger` class was intended for ℚ[i] *with its standard embedding*, so I think there is something else.
