By #23706, each matrix space MS prescribes an implementation. It is important that each matrix whose parent is MS uses that implementation, for otherwise comparison breaks, as in the following example:

```
sage: from sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense import Matrix_gfpn_dense
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(2), 1, 2)
sage: M = Matrix_gfpn_dense(MS, [1,1])
sage: MS2 = MatrixSpace(GF(2), 2, 2)
sage: M2 = Matrix_gfpn_dense(MS2, [1,1,1,1])
sage: M == M[0:1]
True
sage: M == M2[0:1]
False
sage: M.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 1 by 2 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 2
sage: M2[0:1].parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 1 by 2 dense matrices over Finite Field of size 2 (using Matrix_gfpn_dense)
sage: _ == __
False
```

Of course, the above example is a wrong usage. However, the helper function `mtx_unpickle` would incorrectly create a `Matrix_gfpn_dense` in a generic matrix space. The (new) purpose of this ticket is to fix it...

I guess the `matrix` constructor should be provided with an `implementation` keyword, too.

Two matrix spaces with the same base ring, number of rows and number of columns are clearly canonically isomorphic, even if they have different implementations. Thus, there should be a coercion in at least one direction. That's the same in other parts of Sage, e.g., polynomials:

```
sage: R1 = PolynomialRing(ZZ,'x',implementation='NTL')
sage: R2 = PolynomialRing(ZZ,'x',implementation='FLINT')
sage: R3 = PolynomialRing(ZZ,'x',implementation='singular')
sage: R3

To be fair, that statement only holds for matrices that have been created with an old version of my group cohomology spkg (that's why I care...).

So, I suggest one should deal with this ticket as follows:

- modify mtx_unpickle(), so that very old pickles are automatically unpickled with a matrix space that matches the implementation.
- For newer Matrix_gfpn_dense pickles (those which store the matrix space, rather than only the field size and the row/column numbers), nothing needs to change in mtx_unpickle.
- The creation of matrices as demonstrated in the ticket description shouldn't be supported: Matrices are to be constructed via the matrix space or some constructor.

I added #24359 as a dependency, because it affects some tests happening in the file that I modified.

The new test passes, and I suppose it is ready for review!

You should never initialize by yourself `M = Matrix_gfpn_dense(MS, [1,1])`. This might lead to crash. Each parent has its own element class. Your third point "If a matrix space MS has a matrix class doesn't match the class of a matrix M, ..." should never happen.

As you noticed, the comparison problem is due to the fact that I forbade coercions (it was simpler that way).

```
sage: M1 = MatrixSpace(GF(2), 1, implementation='generic')
sage: M2 = MatrixSpace(GF(2), 1, implementation='m4ri')
sage: M1 == M2
False
sage: M1.one() == M2.one()
False
```
A reasonable possibility is to allow coercions from matrix space with alternative implementation to the one with the default implementation. But this will not help for comparing matrices with two alternative implementations.

It would, if we were including the `implementation` in the matrix space construction functor, and would let `merge()` always return the default implementation, unless the two to-be-merged matrix space construction functors have both *the same* non-default implementation.
