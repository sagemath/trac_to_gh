# Issue 12116: hg_sage and friends should unset HGPLAIN

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12288

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Assignee: jason

This is a followup to #12058.  When you run `hg_sage.log()` in Sage, it runs the command `hg` which has been installed in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.  It does not run `sage --hg`.  Therefore, because of the changes in #12058, the variable `HGPLAIN` is set to "yes", so the pager is turned off.  We should instead either run `sage --hg` or unset `HGPLAIN` when running commands using `hg_sage`.

I think that approach 1 is better, since then we can further modify how Sage's hg is used by customizing the `sage-sage` script, as in #12058.

Is there any particular reason to do approach 2?  I'm realizing that this would only turn up in log or diff with a long diff.   

Anyway, approach 1 certainly fixes the issue for log and diff.  Could there be any other consequences?

I agree that approach 1 is better.

Replying to [comment:3 kcrisman]:
> Is there any particular reason to do approach 2? 

I don't think so.  Both approaches occurred to me, they were both easy to implement, so I wrote both.  Then I decided that I liked approach 1 better, but I also thought I should put them both here, in case someone thought of a good reason to use approach 2 instead.

I'm posting a new version of the first patch; the only difference is a comment explaining what's going on.  (If people decide that approach 2 is better, we should add a similar comment to that, too.)

version 1: use "sage --hg" instead of "hg" to run Mercurial

Obviously, some doctests in `sage/misc/hg.py` need to be fixed.

Changing status from needs_work to positive_review.

Okay, this was easy to fix.  Apply [attachment:trac_12288-sage-hg.patch] and [attachment:trac_12288-reviewer.patch].  Passes all tests in sage/misc.

Here's a new patch which also fixes the output of doctests marked "not tested", not just the ones which failed before.  Can we use this one instead?
