Overindented:

```
    TESTS::

            sage: Lambda[1]
            e[0] + e['deltacheck']
```
Also, sorting in the ambient space by `str` will lead to strange results for rank 11 and higher; e.g., `e[0] + e[1] + e[10] + e[2]` from

```
sage: sorted([0,10,1,2], key=str)
[0, 1, 10, 2]
```
A better solution IMO would be one of the following:

```python
key=lambda x: float('inf') if isinstance(x, str) else x
key=lambda x: -1 if isinstance(x, str) else x
```
