Currently Sage uses 2-Sweep algorithm for finding a Lower bound for diameter, We can find a more tighter lower bound for diameter using 4-Sweep algorithm, as suggested in this paper: https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Laurent.Viennot/road/papers/ifub.pdf 

This algorithm also improves average complexity for finding diameter for a graph by providing a better source for iFUB algorithm, as shown in the paper.

The current implementation of iFUB uses `multi-sweep` (not `2-sweep`), that do at least `4-sweep`.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

I propose to close this ticket. The proposed improvement of iFUB is what we already do.
