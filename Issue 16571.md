I can reproduce this with TeXlive-2013

Same error with TexLive-2014. The latex docs tell us to use `\setactivedoublequote`

This now works in both old and new-style babel-italian.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

This works for me (at least, it compiles and looks okay) with TeXLive-2012.  I don't have 2013 or 2014 but I can verify it doesn't regress.  The code is correct assuming the command is the right one.  Is that enough for positive review, or should John verify it works for him?

By the way, I don't see this or the Turkish or Portuguese version of this at http://www.sagemath.org/help.html#SageStandardDoc ...
