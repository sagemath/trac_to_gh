here we might want to check that NTL is built with gf2x. However, it appears that it's only question of better performance, not an exta API, if it gf2x is linked.

nesting of `AC_...` tests is wrong.

This is ready for review now. Note that often external NTL packages are built without `gf2x`, but `gf2x` is merely an optimisation. 

Perhaps, to be completely on the safe side, `spkg-configure` should check whether `gf2x` is in, and if it is, only use system's NTL if `gf2x` will come from the system, too.
(But I  don't know how to check whether `gf2x` is used in NTL, at least not in an OS-independent way).

Comment by fbissey created at 2019-04-19 07:37:29

Minor remark (it all looks ok) why keep `--with-ntl="$SAGE_NTL_PREFIX"` instead of using `$SAGE_CONFIGURE_NTL` like everywhere else in `flint`?

Because `$SAGE_CONFIGURE_NTL` is empty if NTL comes from the system, but `flint` must have `--with-ntl` to build NTL interface.

Thank you for your answer. Once we get some bots reports I think we can move to a positive review.

Comment by embray created at 2019-05-10 15:09:06

Trying to get this to work now.  I rebased it on current develop and reworked it similarly to #27259.  I also have it check if we are installing the gf2x SPKG or not (we really need a utility macro for dependency handling).

But I get this:


```
configure: === checking whether to install the ntl SPKG ===
checking installing gmp/mpir? ... no
checking installing gf2x? ... no
checking NTL/ZZ.h usability... yes
checking NTL/ZZ.h presence... yes
checking for NTL/ZZ.h... yes
```


but then nothing.  I don't see any output related to the `AC_LINK_IFELSE` and `AC_RUN_IFELSE` commands.  I guess one of them is failing (I will check config.log next).

I guess these macros just don't have any default output?  If not, we should add some.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-05-10 15:23:26

gf2x is not compulsory for NTL. It works without it, too. So just don't do it.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-05-10 15:28:05

In fact, it's why it's not possible to check whether gf2x is used with NTL in any "normal" way, (one does not want to run ldd on the library, right?)


---

Comment by embray created at 2019-05-10 15:30:31

I see the problem; I messed up the NTL version check stuff you did.

I don't even know what gf2x is so I'll take your word for it and remove that part.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-05-10 15:34:42

gf2x does fast arithmetic for finite fields of even order. So without it NTL is a bit slower on these very special problems, that's all.


---

Comment by embray created at 2019-05-10 15:48:05

Out of curiosity, where did you come up with 3.10 as the minimum version of NTL?  The version in Sage is 11.3.2, and the system package I have has 10.5.0.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-05-10 16:03:55

Fedora 26 has NTL 10.3 (I guess you didn't mean 3.10...).


---

Comment by embray created at 2019-05-10 17:26:05

Rebased and incorporated #27641.  Also fixed the version check, which didn't have correct logic.

Right, you had 10.3.  I guess I was having a dyslexic moment.  I'll fix that.

I am wondering why one needs these m4_push/popdefs...


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-05-11 21:58:19

OK, this works. I've merged mpfr+mpc+ntl in the branch `u/dimpase/build/mpfr-mpc-ntl`
(which is not automatic) and tested it, as well.

Should we go ahead and set that as the branch for _this_ ticket, or create a new one just for updating the configure version?

I think it's not strictly necessary I'm just trying to avoid unnecessary cluttering of the macro namespace.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-05-13 13:20:34

well, we need to sort out the unfortunate merging of #27642, which seems to lead to merge conflicts here. (and for mpfr+mpc alone, too). Only after this is done, we can proceed here, I think.


---

Comment by embray created at 2019-05-13 14:32:49

I'm still surprised it would lead to merge conflicts, much less any that are non-trivial.  I'll have a look...

Caught a bug - the tests were sometimes passing due to more libs in LIBS, it seems.
Now it should be OK. Please review.


---

Comment by embray created at 2019-05-14 06:51:07

Are you saying flint's configure actually breaks if you *don't* pass a `--with-ntl` option, even if it's empty?

I had removed that while squashing because it looked like a mistake to me.


---

Comment by embray created at 2019-05-14 06:56:12

Also please avoid adding unnecessary merge commits. I'll just rebase this again...


---

Comment by embray created at 2019-05-14 07:07:10

I see. It doesn't even enable the NTL interface if you don't pass `--with-ntl`. Also if you use `--with-ntl` without an argument it assumes you want `/usr/local` which is also not so good. It might be mostly harmless but I want to double-check because that could be confusing. 

There are several things that are not so good about flint's hand-written configure script. I've offered to redo it with autoconf but Bill Hart complained that he didn't want to have to learn autoconf. And while I can completely understand the sentiment I think the fact is it would be better and much simpler if it did use autoconf. There's nothing much fancy it needs to do...

yes, it won’t link ntl unless ‘—with-ntl’ is present.

the joys of dealing dealings with hand-written configure scripts.

Welcome! You are not the first one to offer. The worst thing about it, is that it infects "descendant" projects such as `arb`. `arb`'s configure script is just a tweaked version of the `flint` script.

Yes, I think this is ok now.  I'm still a little perturbed by the situation with flint but I think this will do for now.  I'll rebase #27822.

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-06-11 12:53:14

with clang on OSX, I just saw a failure to recognise NTL, due to c++ in the test called without `-std=gnu++11`.

Adding `AC_REQUIRE([SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC])` just above `AC_REQUIRE([SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GMP])` in NTL's spkg-configure.m4 fixes this.

But this seems to be a not very consistent way to do thing, as `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC` ought to be called before the any other library tests. Do we have a way to force this?


---

Comment by embray created at 2019-06-11 14:41:57

It might work to just manually call `AC_REQUIRE([SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC])` right at the beginning of `SAGE_SPKG_COLLECT`.

hmm, no, this does not work, as at this moment `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC` is not defined.

I am thinking of putting it into `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`, but this means it's a recursive call, so the only way I can think of would be avoid the recursion:
to define essentially a copy of 
`SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`, without this call, and then define `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC` using this copy. After  this  `AC_REQUIRE(...)` would not involve a recursion.

I have opened #28005 to deal with this.
