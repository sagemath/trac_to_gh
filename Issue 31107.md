Thanks for testing! I'll try a clean rebuild of the documentation and see if I can reproduce it on Catalina as well. 

For reference, the trick for bisecting was to use

```
make build && ./sage -docbuild --keep-going all html ; ./sage -docbuild all html
```
the first `--keep-going` was necessary so that `WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree` does not stop the whole process.
