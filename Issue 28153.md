# Issue 28153: Taylor series should raise an error if derivative not defined.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28390

Original creator: klui

Original creation time: 2019-08-23 17:05:34

Keywords: taylor series polynomial

I think an error should be raised in the following example:

```python
sage: f(x) = x**(1/3); f
x |--> x^(1/3)
sage: f(x, 0, 3)
x^(1/3)
```

I'm not familiar with this notation for Taylor polynomials (which is surprising) but anyway to make it clear:

```
f.taylor(x,0,3)
x |--> x^(1/3)
```

For what it's worth, `f.series(x,3)` gives an error.

I have no idea where I got my made up notation for Taylor polynomials from. You're totally right. Fixed! Thanks!
