One of the students in my Computational Number Theory course is working on this for her final project.  Updates to come in the next few months....

See also #13615.  The work there is also nearly complete, and will complement what is planned on this ticket.  However the patch we will provide at #13615 involves some code refactoring, essentially moving lines 3881-end of sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_cur_isogeny.py to another file, and this will need to be taken into account to avoid merge conflicts.
