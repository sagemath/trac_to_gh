# Issue 12843: Metaticket: revamp workflow / switch to git

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13015

Original creator: kini

Original creation time: 2012-05-25 20:12:53

Assignee: jason

Keywords: git workflow

We plan to revamp the development workflow for Sage, involving a few separate (big) changes:

- switch to git (switch to using commits and a history graph for collaboration rather than patch files)
- consolidate our repositories into a single repository
- simplified development interface
- etc. (many other ideas)

This ticket description needs to be expanded...

Help develop scripts and other things related to this project at http://github.com/kini/sage-workflow . We are not making subtickets because this is such a big change that it won't really make sense to get most of this stuff into Sage until after the switchover to git and a single repo, and also because collaboration is faster this way.

Those four spkgs are treated differently in the git layout, so the current (or future) spkg-install scripts are irrelevant.

These are the patches that I'm importing that are not merged in 5.9.beta1: #14226, #13031, #14316, #14331.

So those are the most vital.

Updating dependencies field to remove circular dependencies etc.

Changing keywords from "git workflow" to "git workflow, sd51".

I'm adding a branch to this that is just the merge of all dependencies.

I'll be using `public/sage-git/master` as the base branch for SD53 this week. I just integrated Sage-5.12.beta, the newly-renamed dev scripts, and made sure all doctests pass.

Please don't break it during this week :-)
