Keywords: git workflow

We plan to revamp the development workflow for Sage, involving a few separate (big) changes:

- switch to git (switch to using commits and a history graph for collaboration rather than patch files)
- consolidate our repositories into a single repository
- simplified development interface
- etc. (many other ideas)

This ticket description needs to be expanded...

Help develop scripts and other things related to this project at http://github.com/kini/sage-workflow . We are not making subtickets because this is such a big change that it won't really make sense to get most of this stuff into Sage until after the switchover to git and a single repo, and also because collaboration is faster this way.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13015

Those four spkgs are treated differently in the git layout, so the current (or future) spkg-install scripts are irrelevant.

These are the patches that I'm importing that are not merged in 5.9.beta1: #14226, #13031, #14316, #14331.

So those are the most vital.
