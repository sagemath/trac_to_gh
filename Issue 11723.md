Keywords: p-adic, hash

Extensions of p-adic numbers seem to be unhashable, and this becomes a problem when used in cached methods. For example, the following code raises a TypeError:

```
sage: K.<a>=Qq(3^2)
sage: M=Matrix(K,1,1,1)
sage: print M
```

Can you clean up the formatting of the docstrings a bit? There's a general convention that long lines in docstrings (except doctests!) should be wrapped at 80 columns and trailing whitespace removed. Other than that this looks fine to me.

As soon as the dictionary gets resized in a way that lets those two hashes end up in the same bin, it'll be a toss-up which answer you get back from either `DISC(f)` or `DISC(g)`.

Three remarks:
- It looks like the hash maximally only contain about 3 decimal digits of information. That's way too small! Hash table lookups are based on having `O(1)` elements in the bins. To give you an idea of how small the constant in the `O(1)` should be: Python's dictionaries make sure that the average bin size in 0.7 (smaller than 1). You're fighting the birthday paradox here, so don't underestimate the likelyhood of collisions. Anyway, when using more than 1000 elements in a dictionary, the proposed hash will let dictionaries just degrade to a linear search, but with way larger memory overhead.
- It may seem that having hashes depend on precision (which isn't taken into account in equality testing!) is a mild condition, but it's not. If you have a large matrix or other aggregate element, you can easily end up with some small precision elements in there. This will lead to very confusing situation where a dict lookup doesn't find your key, but you know you have a key that's equal to a stored one. Of course, if you're relying on equality in p-adic computations you've already lost ...
- Caching functions on equality of arguments is a very bad idea with the p-adics. If I construct a known invertible matrix to too low a precision, I'll get determinant 0. If subsequently I construct the same matrix to higher precision, a cached determinant function would recognize the argument as equal to one he'd seem before (because equality is only to lowest common precision) and would just give me the 0 back. 

Properties 2 and 3 conspire to hide the problem a bit:

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def DISC(f):
....:         return discriminant(f)
....: 
sage: K=Qp(2,500)
sage: P.<x>=K[]
sage: f=(1+O(2^200))*x^2-(2^200+O(2^200))
sage: DISC(f)
0
sage: g=(1+O(2^300))*x^2-(2^200+O(2^300))
sage: DISC(g)
2^202 + O(2^302)
sage: 
sage: hash(f), hash(g)
(15360174650385708, 15377766836429868)
sage: f == g
True
```
so the entry under f isn't found when looking up g because they end up being stored in different bins, so the difference in hash is enough to distinguish them. As soon as the dictionary gets resized in a way that lets those two hashes end up in the same bin, it'll be a toss-up which answer you get back from either `DISC(f)` or `DISC(g)`. Oh course, by then it will be very painful to track down what happened.

To show that functions that depend on more of their arguments than just equality should not be cached:

```
sage: a=3
sage: b=GF(5)(3)
sage: @cached_function
....: def test(a):
....:         return a^2
....: 
sage: [test(a),test(b)]
[9, 9]
sage: test.clear_cache()
sage: [test(b),test(a)]
[4, 4]
```

Ok, I hadn't thought about that. But IMHO thats more of an issue with having two separate and competing ways of specifying precision, one in the parent and one in the element:

```
sage: O(3).parent()(3)
3 + O(3^21)
```

I don't have a good answer right now either, but it once again shows the importance of this issue. We need to fix our failure to adhere to Python's convention about comparison and hashes.

I guess this happens because it is possible to specify precision in the element at all.\n\n> Replying to [comment:44 saraedum]:\n> > I agree that disabling hashing has its drawbacks but I do not see an alternative.\n\n> I don't have a good answer right now either, but it once again shows the importance of this issue.\n> We need to fix our failure to adhere to Python's convention about comparison and hashes.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes you want `a==b` to mean, `a` is essentially the same as `b`, say in an algorithm that doese `while(x!=0)`, and sometimes to you want it to mean `a` is indistinguishable from `b`. The latter is maybe what you want in dictionary lookups. But not always, for example if you have a dict which maps powers of `x`, the variable in a polynomial ring, to whatever, then you probably do not care about the precision of the `1` coefficient.\nSo what I'm trying to say is that precision is tricky. Sure, many algorithms might just throw an exception if we disable hashing. But would they really work correctly otherwise? Whenever we make a dictionary lookup with elements with precision, it seems that we need to decide on a case by case basis which version of `==` would produce the right result. Throwing an exception and requiring people to explicitly specify what they want to happen seems to be a better solution IMO.",

Is it really about competing ways? I guess this happens because it is possible to specify precision in the element at all.

The problem is that sometimes you want `a==b` to mean, `a` is essentially the same as `b`, say in an algorithm that doese `while(x!=0)`, and sometimes to you want it to mean `a` is indistinguishable from `b`. The latter is maybe what you want in dictionary lookups. But not always, for example if you have a dict which maps powers of `x`, the variable in a polynomial ring, to whatever, then you probably do not care about the precision of the `1` coefficient.
So what I'm trying to say is that precision is tricky. Sure, many algorithms might just throw an exception if we disable hashing. But would they really work correctly otherwise? Whenever we make a dictionary lookup with elements with precision, it seems that we need to decide on a case by case basis which version of `==` would produce the right result. Throwing an exception and requiring people to explicitly specify what they want to happen seems to be a better solution IMO.
