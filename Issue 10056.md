CC:  @johanrosenkilde

This line is in the interact.py file in sagenb:


```
from sage.misc.misc import decorator_defaults
```


#9907 moved this to sage.misc.decorators, so the import location should be changed after it is merged.

Mike,

I started to review that ticket, but I'm puzzled since

```
sage: from sage.misc.misc import decorator_defaults
```

still works. Shouldn't it fail?

Also, shouldn't the patch include a doctest?

The reason it doesn't fail is because sage.misc.misc contains an import statement, importing decorator_defaults among other (line 2735). This was introduced in #9907 for backwards compatibility, in case users assumed that these decorators would still be in sage.misc.misc. I assumed this would be a temporary thing, just as for keyword and attribute changes. #9907 was merged 14 months ago, so this is longer than the deprecation lifetime, but on the other hand, no deprecation warning has been issued to users doing the wrong thing for these past 14 months.

Maybe that's just me, but isn't it a bit too much including a doctest just for a relocation of a function? It's still the same function.
