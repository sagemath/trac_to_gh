Encode just once, if it's necessary.  Apply to *sage* repository.

Attachment

The patch uses the recently added (cf. #7249, #8051) `sagenb.misc.encoded_str` to avoid attempting to re-encode encoded strings.

I haven't tested this extensively, but it appears to fix the problem above.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

From `sagenb.misc.misc`:

```python
def encoded_str(obj, encoding='utf-8'):
    if isinstance(obj, unicode):
        return obj.encode(encoding, 'ignore')
    return str(obj)

def unicode_str(obj, encoding='utf-8'):
    if isinstance(obj, str):
        return obj.decode(encoding, 'ignore')
    elif isinstance(obj, unicode):
        return obj
    return unicode(obj)
```

I haven't tested it extensively either, but it looks okay. See #8083 for a related notebook issue and #8130 for a related command-line issue.

Seems good, works for me. Tested on the top of #8051
