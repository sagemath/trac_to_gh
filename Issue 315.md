When the new calculus package comes online, it would be nice if there were wizards that could me through what I wanted to do. For the commandline maybe there could say a wizard for starting up the notebook. If I used it, I would be asked different questions based on do I want a public notebook, advanced, simple, name, description, etc. Once I answered all the questions, the wizard would return me back to the commandline and have all the code I need ready for me to execute.

I think this is basically just a Python question.  One can write interactive Python programs
that use SAGE as a library...
