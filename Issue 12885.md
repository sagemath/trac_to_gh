Keywords: regression introspection

Introspection used to be more or less immediate, and now something like


```
sage: gcd?<ENTER>
```


in the sage command line takes a few seconds.

"used to be" means that this slowdown happened sometime between 4.7.1 and 5.0, and probably between 4.8 and 5.0.

I don't know right now if we have the same regression in the notebook.

As another point of reference: If I run `sage -ipython` and then try `str?`, I get the docstring immediately. If I then do

`from sage.all import *`

the same thing now takes a second or two.

Has there been a change to that function recently? Or am I misinterpreting the figures (I am not sure if \"cumtime\" and \"percall\" include the time for calling sub-functions).",

I did

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getdoc
sage: %prun L = sage_getdoc(gcd)
```

which, I thought, should reveal what is happening under the hood.

However, I don't really understand the outcome:

So, it seems much time is spent in the function "format". Has there been a change to that function recently? Or am I misinterpreting the figures (I am not sure if "cumtime" and "percall" include the time for calling sub-functions).

Could you produce a similar report for sage-4.8? If the slow down happened in sage-5.0 the most likely candidate would be python itself.

Dropping the caches first is not a good way of timing this. The problem is not with disk access, but something else, so a better test is to get the docstring twice, and use the second timing.

I now think that the change is should be in either 5.0beta7 or 5.0beta8...

Ok. Here they are again. Haven't dropped caches this time. The sage libraries are already loaded so, the `sage -q` gives the sage prompt quickly.

So it appears that the regression happened somewhere in 5.0beta8. #9128 seems like it touched a lot of stuff related to this, so it is a possible candidate for the cause of the regression.

Try running the sage_getdoc function a few times in a row with the same input on 4.7 and 5.0 (or just using the question mark) and you should see the difference. You really need to do it a few times in a row, though. The first time may be slow because it is reading from disk (a "warm cache" from starting up sage is not enough to prevent this) but it should not remain slow.

As I just reported [on sage-devel](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/59498), #9128 apparently also introduced a pretty large memory leak - every docstring lookup with "?" in the console leaks 56 MB of memory. This patch fixes the leak.

This patch seems to take care of my complaints nicely. I don't know what is actually going on with it, though, so I hope that someone who does know will give it a review.

The 56 MB memory leak is worrying, though, and we should figure out why that was happening. Does someone know?

If this also solves the fact that building the doc now uses a HUGE amount of memory, I'd vote for this ticket being critical.

Nevermind, the doc building problem is already present in 4.8 so is completely unrelated, I mixed two different threads on sage-devel.

This is related to docbuilding using a lot of memory, but it doesn't solve that problem. It suggests that the problem comes from using intersphinx, and this might help someone track down the exact issue. Is there a ticket open for this issue?

I wan't to have a close look at this one (understanding why there is a such a huge slowdown/memleak). It seems that the intersphinx database is recreated at each run (which is very bad wrt speed, caching the result should be doable) and not garbage collected (which is even worse). But I can't manage to find the time to do it. I is clearly critical or blocker. I'm soory, I didn't find the time to even apply the patch.

If so, I think we should look for a better solution because not calling `find_sage_dangling_links` breaks hundreds of links (see #9128).

Sorry that my machine is very fast and that I didn't notice the problem when writing #9128.

Before applying the patch, executing `sage.algebras.group_algebra_new.GroupAlgebra.one_basis?` (or the same but with `??`) in the notebook displays something which looks like a link, but is broken, at least for me running Chrome or Firefox on OS X 10.7. The link is of the form 

```
localhost:8000/FULL_PATH_TO_REFERENCE_MANUAL/sage/categories/algebras_with_basis.html#sage.categories.algebras_with_basis.AlgebrasWithBasis.ParentMethods.one_basis
```

It should probably be of the form

```
localhost:8000/doc/static/reference/sage/categories/...
```

That is, the desired behavior is currently broken.

After applying the patch, there is no link at all.

So I would propose that we use this fix for now, since it speeds things up, prevents a memory leak, and doesn't disable anything which currently works. Then later when you have time, we can work on tracking down the memory leak, reinstating intersphinx in the notebook, and fixing the links so that they actually work.
