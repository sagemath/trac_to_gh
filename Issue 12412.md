# Issue 12412: coercing large numbers into elements of GF fails

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12584

Original creator: dsm

Original creation time: 2012-02-25 20:18:04

Assignee: davidloeffler


```

sage: GF(2**16,'a')(2**63-2)
0
sage: GF(2**16,'a')(2**63-1)
1
sage: GF(2**16,'a')(2**63)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OverflowError                             Traceback (most recent call last)
[...]
OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int

```


Note that this is backend-dependent:


```

sage: FF = sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_ext_pari.FiniteField_ext_pari
sage: FF(2**16,'a')(2**63)
0
sage: FF(2**32,'a')(2**100)
0
sage: GF(2**16,'a') == FF(2**16, 'a')
True
```


See [this ask.sagemath.question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1176/nist-b-283-elliptic-curve) for a case in the wild.

Maybe you could use the trac role :


```
We check that :trac:`12584` is fixed.
```

Good suggestion.  Fixed now.

Please move the check into a `TESTS:` block since it is not an example, and end the text line with a double colon `::` as below:

```
TESTS:

We check that :trac:`12584` is fixed::

    sage: k(2^63)
    0
```


Functionally it looks good. Thanks. 

Travis

Fixed.  Good catch on the double colon.

Changing status from needs_work to needs_review.

One last minor thing, you have an extra space before `TESTS:`.

I actually had a tab, since I'd just edited the patch file and my emacs doesn't know tabs in patch files are still evil.

It should be fixed now.
