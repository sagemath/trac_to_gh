# Issue 16298: get rid of who_asked parameter in combinatorial design

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2014-06-25 10:52:05

CC:  ncohen brett

There is no need of the `who_asked` parameter in the functions `orthogonal_array`, `mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares` and `transversal_design` since all recursive functions belong to the `orthogonal_array`.

This will be in conflict with #16559.

Ok, not a too big conflict. The hardest part was not the changes to `wilson_construction`. Do you agree on having `master_design=None` in `wilson_construction` (see my commit)?

Ok... much better now. Building the MOLS is even faster!

It's a good idea but it is 1) unrelated to this ticket 2) in conflict with the already tricky #16559. Thus it would be better to do this change after that ticket.

There is no reason to handle product decomposition and the `find_wilson_*` functions differently from the other constructions.

Right. So I implemented a function that we will have to remove as soon as wilson_decomposition accept None as a master design...
It will also help the merge with #16559

Needs review.

And I rewrote history at `u/vdelecroix/16535v2`.

EDIT: I loooooove `git rebase -i` !!

Yo !

- You can add `n1<=n2` in `find_product`

- This should be a link to the constructor's doc


```
+    - Wilson constructions with 0, 1 or 2 truncated groups
     - :func:`construction_3_3`
```

- `to the Wilson's` --> to Wilson's

- :func:`simple_wilson_construction` (with 0,1, or 2 truncated columns)

- `- ``k,n`` (integers) -- see above.` stop making style changes. You don't like my style, I don't like yours, but mine was there first so respect that. Otherwise we will just stop changing stuff to our linking.

By the way #16503 must be reviewed first.

HMmmmm.... Volker, it woud be cool if you could give us the releases you work with. For us, when it's closed we can "forget about it" but then you come and tell us that it needs to be rebased on a ticket that does not appear anywhere on trac ... This problems comes from #16446.

This should be corrected in #16528 and not here.

True ! I will add a commit.

Okay, well. Then back to `positive_review`, as the problem has been fixed in #16528.

Thanks for handling this... and you are right: it is hard to take care of closed ticket not in the development release! Would be cool if we had access to the alpha branch with all the closed tickets merged.

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-06-29 00:32:08

If you deprecate something then you should have the foresight to not use it in your current development. There is no "alpha" branch, only a work in progress that almost certainly will have parts of its history rewritten until the next beta is ready.

What if you learnt that that patch was written before the one which deprecated this function ? 

Nathann

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-06-29 12:36:59

The chronological order doesn't really matter. You could have merged this (older) ticket into the branch that deprecates the function. And there is of course no law against going back to the older branch and avoiding the deprecated functionality in the first place. Really we are talking about a ~2 week time window until the next beta release. There will always be rare cases where branches that are about to be merged conflict, and if you forgot that you authored the conflict yourself then the release manager will remind you ;-)

Your previous comment was the following

> If you deprecate something then you should have the foresight to not use it in your current development.

I explained to you why it was groundless.

We just try to add code to Sage, and we try to ensure it passes tests at all times, and the doc, but there is a lot of commits involved and building the pdf doc, for instance, is not instantaneous. I also wanted to tell you how closing tickets without making a release after can complicate our work, and so I did.

Understand what you will.
