CC:  ncohen brett

There is no need of the `who_asked` parameter in the functions `orthogonal_array`, `mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares` and `transversal_design` since all recursive functions belong to the `orthogonal_array`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16535

Right. So I implemented a function that we will have to remove as soon as wilson_decomposition accept None as a master design...
It will also help the merge with #16559

Thanks for handling this... and you are right: it is hard to take care of closed ticket not in the development release! Would be cool if we had access to the alpha branch with all the closed tickets merged.

Your previous comment was the following

> If you deprecate something then you should have the foresight to not use it in your current development.

I explained to you why it was groundless.

We just try to add code to Sage, and we try to ensure it passes tests at all times, and the doc, but there is a lot of commits involved and building the pdf doc, for instance, is not instantaneous. I also wanted to tell you how closing tickets without making a release after can complicate our work, and so I did.

Understand what you will.
