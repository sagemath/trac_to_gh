# Issue 13425: provide xgcd for new polynomial rings through _xgcd_univariate_polynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13629

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2012-10-19 20:27:51

Assignee: AlexGhitza

CC:  boerner

Currently, to add xgcd functionality for a new polynomial ring, one needs to add a specialized subclass of PolynomialElement.

The attached patch allows rings to provide a `_xgcd_univariate_polynomial` method which will be called by PolynomialElement to compute xgcds.

This is similar to #10635, #13442.

the arguments for `sage.categories.fields._xgcd_univariate_polynomial` were incompatible with the way it is used; I've changed them in a way that seems to be working

There's a typo in the documentation of `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx`: 

```diff
+ Compute an extended gcd of this polynomialn and ``other``.
```


Otherwise, I've the same comment as for [ticket:13442#comment:15 #13442] on `self` versus `this polynomial`.

Also, the `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` blocks should not be indented (cf. comment:12:ticket:13442).

After resolving merge conflicts, one doctest fails due to the bug mentioned in #18461.


---

Comment by pbruin created at 2015-05-20 19:00:49

The current branch passes all tests.  However, I'm wondering whether `Field._xgcd_univariate_polynomial` shouldn't be implemented as well (cf. #18461) for performance reasons.


---

Comment by pbruin created at 2015-05-21 12:19:15

I implemented `Field._xgcd_univariate_polynomial` and got a noticeable speed increase.  However, while writing doctests I ran into #18467.

I'm happy with the current state of the ticket, but it is probably good if someone checks my last two commits before this can get a positive review.

Comment by bruno created at 2015-05-27 15:36:22

With the current state of this ticket, there are two implementations of `_xgcd_univariate_polynomial`, one in the class `Field` (in `src/sage/rings/rings.pyx`) and one in the class `ParentMethods` of the class `Fields` (in `src/sage/categories/fields.py`). 

1. In which case(s) will each of these implementations be used?
2. Is the implementation in `Fields` really needed?

I note that the exact same questions are equally relevant for the positive-reviewed (by myself!) ticket #18461. I simply did not think of that issue before.

The implementation in `sage.rings.ring.Field` is used if the base ring inherits from `Field`.
The implementation in `sage.categories.fields.Fields.ParentMethods` is used if the base ring is a field but does not inherit from `Field`; the method is then looked up by the category framework.

The latter situation is sometimes detected only at runtime:

```
sage: R = Zmod(7)
sage: R._xgcd_univariate_polynomial
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'IntegerModRing_generic_with_category' object has no attribute '_xgcd_univariate_polynomial'
sage: R in Fields()
True
sage: R._xgcd_univariate_polynomial
<bound method IntegerModRing_generic_with_category._xgcd_univariate_polynomial of Ring of integers modulo 7>
```

I suspect it is a feature (to avoid a potentially costly primality test) and not a bug that the method only appears after we have forced `R` to refine its category...
> 2. Is the implementation in `Fields` really needed?
I think it is, as the above example shows.
> I note that the exact same questions are equally relevant for the positive-reviewed (by myself!) ticket #18461. I simply did not think of that issue before.
I did have the above picture in mind when working on both tickets, and I am afraid the situation is unavoidable without lots of refactoring.

One thing that could be done to reduce duplication is making `quo_rem` the primitive operation that base rings of polynomial rings should implement, instead of the two operations `_[x]gcd_univariate_polynomial`.  That would be something for a follow-up ticket, though.

OK, thank you for the explanation.

I am not sure what would be the best solution to avoid code duplication in such cases, though I totally agree that it does not belong to this ticket! 

I'm running tests to check everything is OK.

The current branch does not pass the tests. The failed test is in `src/sage/rings/ring.pyx`, lines 2196-2203:


```python
sage: for A in (RR, CC, QQbar):
....:     g = A._gcd_univariate_polynomial
....:     R.<x> = A[]
....:     z = R.zero()
....:     assert(g(2*x, 2*x^2) == x and
....:            g(z, 2*x) == x and
....:            g(2*x, z) == x and
....:            g(z, z) == z)
```


More precisely, I've got the following severe bug:


```python
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: z, h = R(0), R(1/2)
sage: (xx, hh, zz) = RR._xgcd_univariate_polynomial(2*x, 2*x^2)
sage: zz == z
False
sage: zz-z
BOOOM! (SegFault)
```


The crash log is empty.

You have to merge #18467 (which is also in 6.8.beta1)...

Hmmm, there my git knowledge is not sufficient I guess. So let me take the opportunity to ask a few questions:

1. My `develop` branch is up-to-date (6.8.beta1). When I switch to this branch (`git checkout t/13629/...`) I need to recompile a lot. I there a way to decrease the compilation needed to work on such tickets?
2. Since the ticket depends on #18467, shouldn't you add a commit to merge #18467?
3. What is the correct (or the best one if there are several) way to merge #18467, so that I can correctly test this branch?

Thanks in advance!

OK, I've been able to test the ticket with #18467 merged and all tests pass. This is fine to me!

`git pull trac u/pbruin/13629-xgcd_univariate_polynomial`; this merges with the branch that you have currently checked out (`develop` in this case)
> 2. Since the ticket depends on #18467, shouldn't you add a commit to merge #18467?
People have differing opinions about this; I prefer to avoid unnecessary merge commits.
> 3. What is the correct (or the best one if there are several) way to merge #18467, so that I can correctly test this branch?
If you used the command as in (1) this should not be necessary, but in general you can do `git pull trac BRANCH` where `BRANCH` is the name of the branch on Trac that you want to merge.  (If you want to merge a local branch, the analogous command is `git merge BRANCH`.)

Thank you for the clarifications. One point still:

Doesn't this modify my _local_ `develop` branch? What I did finally to review the ticket is to create a new branch (`git branch ticket/13629`), then pull your branch (`git trac pull 13629`, which I guess does the same as what you propose). So finally this is close to what you mention. 

My question though: Isn't it _dangerous_ to modify the local `develop` branch? (I wouldn't like to take the risk to mess up some things I do not understand ;-).)

Thanks again!

Yes, I should have said that you should create a new branch first, which seems to be what you did (but be careful to check out the branch first with `git checkout ticket/13629`; you can actually create the new branch at the same time with `git checkout -b 13629`).

Right, I did not mention the `git checkout ticket/13629` that I indeed did. Thanks again, and thank you for the shortcut! The way it works is now clearer.
