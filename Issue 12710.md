Hi Christian--

Your code is checking that all the off-diagonal entries in the input matrix are strictly negative.  That seems a bit over-enthusiastic.  

A doctest for the new functionality would also be good.

Hugh

Hi Hugh!

Thanks for bringing back my/our attention to this ticket!

I will be too busy to actively work on this patch in the next two weeks, but feel free to take it over and review/finish it if you like! I will now provide a version that you can work with (in particular, I deleted the dependency). Of course, you can as well wait until I finish the patch, if you prefer.

Best, Christian

Hi Travis,

This patch does not pass all of it's doctests.  Also, is it a good idea to add a note to the documentation saying that only Cartan matrices whose Cartan types are implemented in Sage are legal input?  For example, the Cartan matrix 

```
CartanMatrix([[2,-3],[-3,2]])
```

yields an error.  Can you also provide an example of inputting a Cartan matrix and an index set in the documentation?
