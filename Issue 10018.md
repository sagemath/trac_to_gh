Try this and wait 1 hour (estimated)


```
sage: variance([1] * 2^18)
```


This should be fast.

Actually, I get a docbuild warning:

```
/mnt/usb1/scratch/mpatel/tmp/sage-4.6.alpha1-working/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/stats/basic_stats.py:docstring of sage.stats.basic_stats.variance:53: (WARNING/2) Literal block expected; none found.
```

I've unmerged the patch.
