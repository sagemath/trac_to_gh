The maxima spkg creates a maxima-noreadline executable, which is an old hack. This should go away.

I might work on it myself, but first I must ask on which maxima spkg I should base my work on (a question which will disappear with the git transition...)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14556

I don't know.  I only just now got back online after the US holiday weekend and tried upgrading.

Fair enough, but partially the reason for removal was that it was an undocumented fix. I really dislike "workarounds" without any reference to a ticket or clues what the problem is. And I even looked on the ticket numbers from the spkg, but couldn't find any reference to this problem on any Trac ticket.

I spent some time with hgview to scan the hg repo of the maxima spkg. This is in the initial commit on 23/07/2007 by wstein

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" ]; then
   echo "Now building maxima; this takes a few minutes"
   echo "Since we're using OS X and there is a very weird"
   echo "bug with buffered output while building maxima,"
   echo "you will not be able to see the output of the build"
   echo "as it occurs.  Don't worry, the build process did"
   echo "not hang."
   make > output.log
else
   make
fi
```

And the second commit of the repo has the following change, also by wstein on 2/11/2007

neither have trac tickets. trac tickets are vaguely mentioned in the commit message on occasion in 2008 and 2009, they are regulary in commit message in 2010 and the first time SPKG.txt quote a trac ticket is 13/02/2011. When did Jeroen become the release manager already???

That was some archeology. The work around has been in the spkg since 2007. maxima on a gentoo prefix on OS X doesn't have any buffering problems at build time.

The rest of the log is completely ordinary, same as always.  At this point I'm just asking for someone else to test upgrading for this spkg.

Indeed,

```
$ ls spkg/build/maxima-5.29.1.p3/src/src/binary-ecl/
maxima-package.c	maxima-package.data	maxima-package.eclh
```

Weirdly, now as I try to reinstall the p1 spkg, I get the same problem! Of course, it doesn't show up on the screen, but in error.log it's there, and the `binary-ecl` folder has the same three files.

Is it possible we have to touch ecl first so that it upgrades when upgrading this?  I don't see why, but I'll try that next.

The ecl/maxima building problem again. ecl has been updated in beta2 so it shouldn't have been a problem updating from beta4. Did you move sage at some point before upgrading?

Yes, because I had upgraded several times in a row and then renamed the folder.

I'll be mostly offline for a few days now, so I won't be able to reproduce this, but I am pretty certain that somehow this was the issue.
