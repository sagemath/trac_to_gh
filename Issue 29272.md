Keywords: hyperelliptic, rational points

I believe this is the same issue as #26677 but for Hyperelliptic curves

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ); 
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(R([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]), R([1, 1, 0, 1]));
sage: C.rational_points(bound=10)

--- Big traceback ---

Plain curve was actually intentional, I just meant its a `Curve` not a `HyperellipticCurve`.

I thought about that, but then I did the following:

```
sage: from sage.schemes.curves.constructor import Curve                         
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]                                                               
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(R([0,-1,1,0,1,-2,1]), R([1]))                      
sage: C                                                                         
Hyperelliptic Curve over Rational Field defined by y^2 + y = x^6 - 2*x^5 + x^4 + x^2 - x
sage: Curve(C)                                                                  
Projective Plane Curve over Rational Field defined by -x0^6 + 2*x0^5*x2 - x0^4*x2^2 - x0^2*x2^4 + x1^2*x2^4 + x0*x2^5 + x1*x2^5
```
So what you're computing is not just a "plain" curve but in fact a "plane" curve.
