# Issue 20513: Fix re group indexing with Sage Integers

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20750

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-06-01 13:44:01

CC:  jhpalmieri

This breaks:

```
sage: import re
sage: p = re.compile('(a)b')
sage: m = p.match('ab')
sage: m.group(0)
IndexError: no such group
```

The reason is that the `re` module does not handle Sage Integers:

```
sage: m.group(int(0))
'ab'
```

This looks good to me and appears to fix the problem. I have not run the modified Python test suite yet, but everything else looks okay. Thanks for working on this!

Late reaction. This is so weird on the sage-on-gentoo front. With python 2.7.10 the doctest without problem and without the patch to python. Python 2.7.12 enters stable and now the doctest fails if I don't patch python. I am weirded out on that one.

Replying to [comment:8 fbissey]:
> With python 2.7.10 the doctest [passes?] without problem and without the patch to python.

Are you really sure about that? I find that very hard to believe. It certainly doesn't work in Sage without the Python patch.

I verified on a machine that I had with sage 7.4 but still on python 2.7.10 an hour ago. By now it has probably been upgraded but I have been wondering about those two doctests failing suddenly for the last week and a bit on my main machine before tracking it to here and discovering the date of the merge. I am not sure what is in python 2.7.10 from gentoo that makes those tests pass I must say. Especially when 2.7.12 then fails.

But it is more of a curiosity.
