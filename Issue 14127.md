# Issue 14127: remove explict references to SAGE_ROOT in the doctesting framework

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The new doctesting framework expects the sage library's source code to be in `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage` which will no longer be the case once we switch layouts. Using the `SAGE_SRC` environment variable will make the transition much easier.

Definitely want this in. We didn't spend so much time on #13432 to be undone by the patch bomb from the new doctesting frame work. We want it ASAP. Thanks for spotting it Andrew and thanks for the review David.

Hopefully it doesn't interfere with any of the follow up of #12415.

I missed one disguised reference in my first patch, so I've attached a fix for that.
