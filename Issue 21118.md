Note that the file doesn't even have long tests.

For me still passes quickly in 7.4.beta0, but not beta2.  (Don't have a beta1 at hand right now.)

Hmmm, the following takes a few seconds:

sage: g = Graph(multiedges=True)
sage: g.add_edges([(0,1,1),(1,5,2),(5,3,3),(5,2,4),(2,4,5),(0,2,6),(0,3,7),(0,4,8),(0,5,9)])
sage: g.tutte_polynomial()(1,1)
52
```


And afterwards this gives an *immediate* answer:

```
sage: g.spanning_trees_count()
52
```

The only test that follows doesn't take time either:

```
sage: P = graphs.CycleGraph(5)
sage: P.tutte_polynomial() # indirect doctest
x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + y
```

With `./sage -t --verbose` (=> same tests, just shorter time-out) I'm getting

So which parts differ in your SoG installation?

(The file itself by the way hasn't changed recently, AFAICT.)

Sure, I meant backends...  (Not sure what's used at all.)


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-27 21:01:15

Ah, while there's not a single process actually doing something, I now see frequent calls of `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pip list`...  WTF?

(So apparently it is continually looked up whether an optional backend is available / installed.)

Steve, do you have the `bliss` useflag on in SoG?

I was just going to copy you. No, I don't have `bliss` enabled.

Yep, I see this too.

`GenericGraph.canonical_label()` (from which `HasseDiagram` indirectly inherits) seems to be the culprit here:


```python
        from sage.misc.package import is_package_installed
        if (algorithm == 'bliss'           or  # explicit request; or
            (algorithm is None             and # default choice
             is_package_installed('bliss') and
             not edge_labels)):
            if edge_labels:
                raise ValueError("bliss cannot be used when edge_labels is True")
            try:
                from sage.graphs.bliss import canonical_form
            except ImportError:
                raise ImportError("You must install the 'bliss' package to run this command.")
            return canonical_form(self, partition, return_graph, certificate)

    ...
```


Did they ever hear of caching results?

(We could of course also mark all tests `# optional -- internet`... B) )

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-08-27 22:09:52

Graphs are mutable, so we cannot cache the results in the graph. IIRC, the reason why we are getting a canonical labeling is so we can cache things for the Tutte polynomial. However, we could split out the check for existence of `bliss` into the Tutte polynomial computation and pass the corresponding choice of algorithm.

... together with the [commit](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=46c1a6fbf9ec7861f65fe131a1ef8f6b0d9ce7c4) from #19213 leading to:

    installed.update(pip_installed_packages()) ##### here 'pip' gets called #####
    return installed

Stuff using `is_package_installed` is broken inside vanilla sagemath? Do you know how much it makes me my day :) I don't think I need to plug #20382, most people here are aware of it.

That doesn't matter; whether specific backends are available could be cached in a "static" property (here presumably of `GenericGraph`) or even a module variable, if not in `misc.package` itself (whether some _package_ is installed).

While a package could perhaps get _installed_ during runtime, it certainly won't (or _shouldn't<sup>TM</sup>_) get _removed_ while Sage is running.

Nothing is broken, it's just things have sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowed down.

We have to adjust the timeouts accordingly, and mark more tests `# long time`.

Ah, sorry, I misunderstood what you were asking to cache. Yes, I agree that we should cache the results of the existence of (optional) packages. We currently do this for `dot2tex` (#18570).

Please review #21289


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-08-30 13:35:23

This should be solved by #21289, to be confirmed

Changing status from new to needs_review.

OK, without #21289

```
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/tutte_polynomial.py
    [105 tests, 1621.87 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1622.0 seconds
    cpu time: 26.9 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 1621.9 seconds
```

and with #21289 I now get

```
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/tutte_polynomial.py
    [105 tests, 3.45 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 3.6 seconds
    cpu time: 3.4 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 3.4 seconds
```

So this seems to fix `tutte_polynomial.py`.
