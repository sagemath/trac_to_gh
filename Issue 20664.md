CC:  azi jdemeyer vdelecroix kcrisman dimpase chapoton stumpc5 moritz vbraun

New upstream archive: http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/bliss/bliss-0.73.zip (we have 0.72)

Upstream bliss does not have a proper build system (in particular no 'make install').
"spkg-install" installs header files with generic names such as "graph.hh" flat into $SAGE_LOCAL/include/

Debian has https://packages.debian.org/sid/math/bliss
which autotoolizes the package and adjust the include file location.
This matches where Polymake (#20892) expects the header files.

We should really be using Debian as our upstream for this package.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20901

A shared library, proper include files location, and as a result works as a prerequisite for polymake.
New upstream version -- but upstream is silent about what has changed compared to 0.72.

OK, I've changed it to using upstream + a patch.
Unfortunately our patches cannot be as elegant as Debian's because we cannot rely on the availability of autotools. So my patch has to ship the whole autogenerated build system.
