This seem to be OK and tests passed, so feel free to mark as positive review (to be sure I did not do that, as this was not yet in needs review -state). The branch is shown in red, but I suppose it's just trac again.

Sidenote: You corrected one "implemenation", but there are "implmentation" left in `src/sage/sets/recursively_enumerated_set.pyx` and `src/sage/combinat/affine_permutation.py`. Found by


```
egrep -R -w 'imp[a-z]+ion' src/sage -o --no-filename | sort | uniq -c
```

ok, I rebased (trivial conflict) and corrected the two typos. Setting to need_review now.
