In `build/pkgs/coxeter3/spkg-install`, the line

```
sed -i "s|@SAGE_LOCAL@|$SAGE_LOCAL|g" directories.h
```

does not work on OS X because `sed -i` is not portable. (It prints an error and continues, and it does not change the file `directories.h`.) On OS X, the following works:

```
sed -e "s|@SAGE_LOCAL@|$SAGE_LOCAL|g" -i '' directories.h
```

but I'm not sure this works with GNU sed.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25321

Does someone know a portable invocation of sed that would work here?
Otherwise, could we detect the OS, and use an appropriate invocation?

The [answer by kine](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22084103) to that
StackOverflow question creates an extra file that then needs to be deleted.

The [answer by nwinkler](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51060063) there
might be better, but it has had no upvotes at StackOverflow.

The extra file is in a temporary build directory, so unless you use the `-s` flag when installing, who cares? And if you do use the `-s` flag, you probably know what you're doing.

This is a change to the `spkg-install` file, not to the actual coxeter3 package. So no PR to merge.
