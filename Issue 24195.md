# Issue 24195: let category handles is_finite/cardinality for rings

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24432

We remove a lot of `is_finite` and `cardinality` that can be dealt with the `ParentMethods` of category. Sometimes we have to properly refine it. Sometimes we had to refine the categories with `.Finite()` or `.Infinite()`.

I tried to rebase this on top of develop. I hope I didn't screw up in some way.

What's the status of this now? Does this essentially need review?

Some update is needed. For example the following make no sense

```diff
-_NumberFields = NumberFields()
+# even though number fields are infinite, it seems delicate
+# to have it automatically understood by the category
+# see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/-ZtXuXan6cg
+_NumberFields = NumberFields().Infinite()
```

as

```
sage: NumberFields() is NumberFields().Infinite()
True
```
