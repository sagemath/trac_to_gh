That `configure` keeps suggesting packages from the `_recommended` dummy package is because `build/pkgs/_recommended/spkg-configure.m4` does not check anything.

To improve this, tests need to be added for the presence of the various recommended packages in the system. Either in `build/pkgs/_recommended/spkg-configure.m4` or in individual "script packages" similar to `build/pkgs/pandoc`.
