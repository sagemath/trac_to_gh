When tensoring chain complexes, tensor products of two `0 x n` matrices don't work correctly:

```
sage: C = ChainComplex({0: matrix(ZZ, 0, 1)}, degree=-1)
sage: ascii_art(C)
 0 <-- C_0 <-- 0 
sage: C.homology()
{0: Z}

sage: C.tensor(C)
Trivial chain complex over Integer Ring
sage: C.tensor(C).homology()
{}
```

So, I should not try to optimize if it is a `0 x n` differential matrix; those still carry useful information.
