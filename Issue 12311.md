# Issue 12311: Workaround #12482 causing history-dependent behaviour of Family

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12483

Original creator: nthiery

Original creation time: 2012-02-09 16:19:52

Assignee: sage-combinat

Without the workaround (or a fix to #12482):

```
            sage: P = Partitions(3)
            sage: Family(P, lambda x: x).category()
            Category of enumerated sets
            sage: Family(P, lambda x: x).category()
            Category of finite enumerated sets
```


Gasp.
