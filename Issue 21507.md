# Issue 21507: make zx a standard package

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: charpent

Original creation time: 2016-10-23 06:44:17

Rationale :

* `R` is a standard package.
* It now depends on `liblzma` (see #20523).
* `liblzma` is available through `xz`.
* Therefore `R` depends on `xz`.
* A standard package cannot depend on an optional package

Therefore `xz` has to become standard. QED.

Trivial patch to follow shortly (Real_World(TM) _adjuvante_)...

Passes `ptestlong` with two transient errors, as usual :


```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 99.8 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 99.8 src/sage/categories/sets_cat.py  # Bad exit: 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```


which both pÃ¢ss standalone with no error.

==> `needs_review`

A notice about this should be posted to sage-devel, but I am in favor of this change.

The outcome of the poll on sage-devel seems to have been positive, so I'm setting this to positive review.
(I'd like to use xz for a CGAL package, #18197.)
