```
Rationale :

* `R` is a standard package.
* It now depends on `liblzma` (see #20523).
* `liblzma` is available through `xz`.
* Therefore `R` depends on `xz`.
* A standard package cannot depend on an optional package

Therefore `xz` has to become standard. QED.

Trivial patch to follow shortly (Real_World(TM) *adjuvante*)...

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21744

Passes `ptestlong` with two transient errors, as usual :


```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 99.8 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 99.8 src/sage/categories/sets_cat.py  # Bad exit: 2
