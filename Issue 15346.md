Keywords: linear constraint, mixed integer linear program

Hello,

I'd like to have sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearConstraint to be a hashable type for the following reasons:


1)  When adding constraints to an instance of a MixedIntegerLinearProgram, it is not necessary to add the same or equivalent constraint multiple times.  A hash could be used to determine distinct linear constraints that are added into a MILP instance.  
2) By having hashable linear constraints, one could allow for linear constraints to be added into sets (http://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html) or used as keys in dictionaries.


Thanks,
Clinton

`sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearConstraint` is now a hashable type.

```python
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: c = (b[0] <= b[1] <= 2)
sage: c.__hash__()
8748240900236
sage: c.__hash__
<method-wrapper '__hash__' of sage.numerical.linear_functions.LinearConstraint object at 0x7f4dbca908c0>
```


I think we have https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=682ba3e7b8aaf84ba181ac16b8630aefb695c940 to thank for the update.

IMHO, typically solvers are able to deal with multiple constraints, etc.

Also, constraints are really held in the backend, and in fact they can get modified once they are processed.
