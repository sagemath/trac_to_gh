Upstream has recently bumped giac to 1.9.0 (https://xcas.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=2775) but there is no significant difference from 1.7.0-57 and doctests pass just fine on 9.6.rc0.

Maybe `GIAC_MAX_VERSION` should be removed?

See #33877 for a problem arising from using the system's giac 1.9.x.
