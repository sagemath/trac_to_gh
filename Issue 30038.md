Turns out that an `AssertionError` is inapropriate to raise when immutable elements are tried to be changed (see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AssertionError)):

> exception AssertionError
>    Raised when an assert statement fails.

since no `assert` statements are involved. A better choice would be a `ValueError`. Apart from the new immutability implementations, this would also depend on #30239 because the `AssertionError` due to immutability is catched there. The easiest way, I think, is to substitute them all at once after the immutability tickets have been finished (find & replace).

What about the pyflakes errors? It has nothing to do with the ticket, but shouldn't that be polished at some point?

No problem.

Yes, but that is something for another ticket. You probably can take care of all of those at once for the manifolds folder.
