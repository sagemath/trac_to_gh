# Issue 17734: Infinite recursion when taking a resultant over a complicated base ring

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2015-03-17 09:49:43

Keywords: infinite recursion polynomial resultant

The following resultant computation leads to an infinite recursion:

```
sage: A.<a,c> = Frac(PolynomialRing(QQ,'a,c'))
sage: B.<d,e> = PolynomialRing(A,'d,e')
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(B,'x')
sage: (a*d*x^2+a+e+1).resultant(-4*c^2*x+1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```

(This is independent of #17817.)
