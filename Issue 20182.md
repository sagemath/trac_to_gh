We have type A -> B -> G:

```
sage: M = CoxeterMatrix(['A',2])
sage: CoxeterMatrix(matrix(M)).coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['B', 2]
sage: M = CoxeterMatrix(['B',2])
sage: CoxeterMatrix(matrix(M)).coxeter_type()
Coxeter type of ['G', 2]
```

This occurred only in rank 2, and we were just not checking the entries correctly.
