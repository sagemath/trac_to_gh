With my limited knowledge of Cython, I'm not sure why it seems to help that much more in the case of rationals, or if this is the right thing to do at all (though the generated code looks okay to me).

Why call this object `the_integer_ring` instead of `ZZ`?

I don't know, I kept the name and didn't really look at the rest of the file or anything.
