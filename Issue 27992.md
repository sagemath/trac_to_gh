The generalized shifted prime tableau defined by BRUCE E. SAGAN is similar to the already existing shifted prime tableau in [SageMath](SageMath) except for the fact that we can also have primed entries in the main diagonal.

Python variable naming conventions: `primedDiagonal` -> `primed_diagonal`. However, the primed diagonal is something that is stored with the parent, so it should not also be stored with the element. So you can get it with `self.parent()._primed_diagonal`.

The `__iter__` `EXAMPLES::` needs a blankline after it.
