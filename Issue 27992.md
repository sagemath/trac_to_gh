Python variable naming conventions: `primedDiagonal` -> `primed_diagonal`. However, the primed diagonal is something that is stored with the parent, so it should not also be stored with the element. So you can get it with `self.parent()._primed_diagonal`.

The `__iter__` `EXAMPLES::` needs a blankline after it.
