The test can take a very long time because it's possible that a randomly generated graph has a vertex of degree one. The warning in the documentation of `find_hamiltonian()` says that the function could loop endlessly when the input graph has a vertex of degree one. So something like the following is likely to loop endlessly.


```python
sage: from sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx import find_hamiltonian as fh
sage: def long_test(n):
....:     for i in range(n):
....:         G = graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)
....:         _ = fh(G, find_path=True)
....:         
sage: long_test(1)
```


We need to avoid using graphs that have a vertex of degree one. Something like the following should reduce the runtime of the doctest.


```python
sage: from sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx import find_hamiltonian as fh
sage: for i in range(100):  # long time
...       G = graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)
...       while 1 in G.degree():
...           G = graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)
...       _ = fh(G, find_path=True)
```


But even then, `graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)` could generate a graph with a vertex that has no out-neighbours. An exception similar to the following would then be returned (see #10206):


```python
sage: from sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx import find_hamiltonian as fh
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)
sage: while 1 in G.degree():
....:     G = graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)
....:

The attached patch makes sure that when choosing a random vertex, the chosen vertex must have at least one out-neighbour. It also reduces the runtime to a "reasonable" amount.




I came across a non-reproducible segfault with the following code:


```python
sage: from sage.graphs.generic_graph_pyx import find_hamiltonian as fh
sage: def long_test(n):
....:     for i in range(n):
....:         G = graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)
....:         while 1 in G.degree():
....:             G = graphs.RandomGNP(20, 0.1)
....:         _ = fh(G, find_path=True)
....:         
sage: %time long_test(200)


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
```
