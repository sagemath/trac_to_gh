# Issue 21594: indexed free group: allow repetitions of generators in input

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2016-11-07 09:50:44

We want

```
sage: G = Groups().Commutative().free(index_set=ZZ)
sage: G([(1, 3), (1, -5)])
F[1]^-2
```

but get `F[1]^-5` currently.

It looks like I was been overly gracious with copying when `x` is a `dict` as well. However, you need to clear out 0 exponents (which actually is a bug with the current code).
