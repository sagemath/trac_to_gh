Fedora claims to use the exact same source files as we do. Maybe some linking didn't work out.

Replying to [comment:9 dimpase]:
> perhaps a test based on `CErrorInfo::text` in comment:5 is doable.

no, apparently it is not the case, this patch is there.
I tried the following on Fedora 30 (brial 1.2.5)

```
#include <iostream>
#include <polybori/except/CErrorInfo.h>
int main () {
	polybori::CErrorInfo foo;
    std::cout << polybori::CTypes::last_error << "\n";
	std::cout << foo.text(-1) << "\n";
	return 1;
}

```

and it prints

```
clpc171[/tmp]$ g++ bri.cc -lbrial
clpc171[/tmp]$ ./a.out 
12
Unknown error occured.
```


no crash.

I think this is because -1 is interpreted as unsigned. At least my compiler interprets `errornum_type` as unsigned. This would also explain why this specific patch is needed only on some seldom architectures.
