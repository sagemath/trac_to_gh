# Issue 26494: Cartesian product of polynomial quotient rings no longer works

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26731

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2018-11-21 15:28:06

The following used to work in SageMath 8.3, but in SageMath 8.4 one gets an error:

```
from sage.categories.all import cartesian_product, CommutativeRings
L.<a> = Qp(17, prec=8).extension(x^2+17, prec=8)
R.<x> = L[]
category = CommutativeRings().CartesianProducts()
cartesian_product([R.quotient(x), R.quotient(x)], category=category)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: <class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_quotient_ring.PolynomialQuotientRing_generic_with_category'> is not hashable and does not implement _cache_key()
```
