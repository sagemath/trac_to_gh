For an infinite polynomial ring of the form k[x_0,x_1,...] it is useful to have degree(x_n) = n (or n+1 to have finite dimensional graded components). This is quite common in the study of arc spaces for example. A quick look at sage/rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial.py and it seems that this should be easily implemented. I am forcing this degree scheme with the attached patch. It would be useful to have an implementation where one passes a weight (say k) for each variable (say x) and then one has degree(x_n) = k+n.
