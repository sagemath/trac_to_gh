As reported in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/_UAIbMIKjEU/PBaAI28sBAAJ

In the spkg-install script for pip we set


```
export PYTHONPATH=`cd src && pwd`
```


This invocation is broken if you have the `CDPATH` variable set in bash it will auto-echo the new path cd'd into.

It would be better to just do something like `PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)/src"`.
