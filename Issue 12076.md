# Issue 12076: Do not run "make -q" when upgrading

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2012-01-02 19:48:05

Assignee: GeorgSWeber

The script `spkg/install` contains the lines

```
# Skip the rest if nothing to do (i.e., to [re]build):
# If "make" doesn't understand the -q option (although we require
# GNU make, which supports it), it should exit with a non-zero status
# which is not a problem.
if ${MAKE:-make} -q -f standard/deps $1; then
    echo "Nothing to (re)build / all up-to-date."
    exit 0
fi
```


This runs `make` with the `-q` option, which (via the makefile `spkg/standard/deps`) in turn runs `sage-spkg`.  When upgrading, the file `sage-spkg` is not automatically upgraded, so we can have an old `sage-spkg` which does not understand the `-q` option which causes build failures.

Successfully tested building from scratch and upgrading from sage-4.5.1.

Why did #12016 cause this?  Is it because of all of the plus signs in spkg/standard/deps?

Unless I made a mistake, I was able to upgrade from 4.4 and 4.5.3 to Sage 4.8.alpha6 plus #9958 and its prerequisites (since that's what I was looking at earlier).  I was also able to upgrade after applying the patch here.  The patch looks okay to me, but I'm not sure it should be a blocker.

Yes.  Those plus signs mark a make rule as recursive.

Perhaps I should have been more clear.  The upgrade might work without this patch, but you will see a failed build attempt for example in `spkg/logs/patch-2.5.9.p2.log`.

Meaning "positive review"?

> I'm not sure it should be a blocker.
I disagree since it causes non-fatal build errors.  Seeing a scary message "An error occured... please contact sage-devel..." isn't good.  Besides, this might possibly lead to an actual build failure.
