# Issue 18094: Introduce initial distribution for Markov chains

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18331

Keywords: Markov chain, initial distribution

We introduce the attribute `FSMState.initial_probability`. It is the probability of starting in this state of a Markov chain.
In `FiniteStateMachine.is_Markov_chain`, we additionally check whether the sum of the initial probabilities over all states is one or all initial probabilities are set to None.

Added a few reviewer commits. Please cross-check.

I think that copying states and comparing states should also take `initial_probability` into account.

I reviewed your changes in [c550d1e](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=c550d1eb25fb4444f9133a3fccce44fe1aac9d96) and added more doctests for `__copy__`.

Please cross-review my changes.
