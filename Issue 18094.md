Keywords: Markov chain, initial distribution

We introduce the attribute `FSMState.initial_probability`. It is the probability of starting in this state of a Markov chain.
In `FiniteStateMachine.is_Markov_chain`, we additionally check whether the sum of the initial probabilities over all states is one or all initial probabilities are set to None.
