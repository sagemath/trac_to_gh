Keywords: quiver representation

Currently, we only allow acyclic quivers when creating a quiver representation. The aim is to lift that restriction to the possible extent.

The key for implementation probably is to use enumerated families (rather than lists/tuples) for the basis of the resulting vector space.

It is already possible to define a representation of a cyclic quiver by assigning finite-dimensional vector spaces to each vertex and assigning matrices (defining a transformation) to each arrow.

What is currently not possible is to provide the right-module that is given, say, by all paths that start at vertex `v` (the result is a projective indecomposable module). Reason is that the current code would first try to create vector space basis of the to-be-created module (=representation) by forming the **list** of all paths starting at `v`. Of course, that list may be infinite in the case of a cyclic quiver, thus, the code is doomed.

My guess is (by looking at the current code) that what we really need is a container that represents a vector space basis for the module, so that we can
- use the basis as a cache key (quiver representations use a `UniqueFactory`)
- test whether a path of the quiver belongs to the basis
- iterate over the basis elements

The previous commit provides these three features for families of paths that are closed under multiplication from the right, and a similar thing would be needed for left-closed path families as well.

Seemingly the branch doesn't merge with the latest beta. Sigh. I am trying to merge and will then try to develop the branch further. My plan is:

Implement `.cardinality()` for left/right closed families. Recall that the left/right closed families represent the vector space bases given by (dual) paths. Hence, the cardinality corresponds to the dimension of the vertex vector spaces.

And then, there should be (or there already is) a method computing the action of a path on a path algebra element. This should use matrix multiplication or some more explicit computation with path concatenation, depending on whether or not the dimensions are finite.

Wow. It's now four years of bit rot.

I guess the attempt to fix the issue should start from scratch.
