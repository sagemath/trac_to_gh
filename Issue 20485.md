see [this sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/lAHT1sENv9w):

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(GF(4), ('x', 'y'))
sage: x, y = R.gens()
sage: I = R.ideal([x^2 + y^2, x + y^3])
sage: S = R.quotient(I, 'ab')
sage: a, b = S.gens()
sage: c, d, e = a + b^2, a*b, b^2
sage: c*(d + e) == c*d + c*e
False
```

The problem is `QuotientRingElement._cmp_`, where it is assumed that the reduction of an element with respect to an ideal I is a unique representative of its residue class modulo I. In general, it is not.

First try. Seems to work for the most part, except for one doctest

```
            sage: F.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, implementation='letterplace')
            sage: I = F*[x*y+y*z,x^2+x*y-y*x-y^2]*F
            sage: Q = F.quo(I)
            sage: Q.0^4    # indirect doctest
            ArithmeticError: Can only subtract elements of the same degree
```

which I think is a bug in the implementation of Q: if you can only work in the homogeneous parts, it's a disjoint union of modules; not a ring, and it shouldn't have any business trying to use ring machinery.

I thought that the letterplace implementation of free algebras does provide a normal form. Thus, there shouldn't be a problem involved here. Or am I missing something?
