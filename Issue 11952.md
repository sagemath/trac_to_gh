Just for clarification, does this work with either python-2.6 or 2.7 or does it require python-2.7?

It should have nothing to do with Python, it is simply a problem that I _discovered_ because of the Python upgrade.

I backed out that portion of [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/9958/trac_9958-fixing_numericalnoise-part1_p2.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/9958/trac_9958-fixing_numericalnoise-part1_p2.patch) from #9958 that touched sage/modular/modform/eis_series.py in my build of sage-4.8.alpha3 with python-2.7 and applied the eisenstein patch of this ticket. Testing the touched file passes on x86 and amd64


```
./sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/modular/modform/eis_series.py
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage-main/sage/modular/modform/eis_series.py"
         [2.6 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```

I've assembled a team of people at SD35 to do some modular forms patch reviewing, and we saw this one. Could you perhaps give us a tiny bit of background on what's going on here and why the change is needed?

Frithjof and I both looked at this during SD35, and it looks fine. There is some oddness in the `eisenstein_series_lseries` code -- it is weird that the prec argument is used as both a power series precision and a real-number precision -- but we both feel that is orthogonal to this patch.
