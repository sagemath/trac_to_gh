Could we give up on `Mathematica().is_present()`
after say a minute?

Mathematica is installed on that machine
but requires a password or token to start.

Running `math` in a shell session goes:

```
$ math
Mathematica 12.1.1 Kernel for Linux x86 (64-bit)
Copyright 1988-2020 Wolfram Research, Inc.

Mathematica 12.1.1 Kernel cannot find a valid password.

For automatic Web Activation enter your activation key
(enter return to skip Web Activation):
```


This is likely what makes the feature detection hang.
