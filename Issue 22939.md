# Issue 22939: Stop using cysignals .pxi files (part 7)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23176

Follow-up to #22806 and #22896: we should stop using the deprecated files `cysignals/memory.pxi` and `cysignals/signals.pxi`.

Given the large number of files which need to be changed, this is done in parts.

-----------------

This was split off from #23127 after some issues were found.
