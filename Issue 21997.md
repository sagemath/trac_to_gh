I believe the whitespace part of changes like this:

```diff
-        return sum([b*arg**a for (a,b) in enumerate(help3)])
+        return sum(b * arg ** a for a, b in enumerate(help3))
```

actually make the code less readable (on first glance, it looks more like a typo). PEP 8 actually says we should consider only putting space around the lowest priority operator, and I would write this as

```
        return sum(b * arg**a for a, b in enumerate(help3))
```
