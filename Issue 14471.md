Keywords: free groups, finitely presented groups

Somebody that was using finitely presented groups pointed me the following behaviour (which was very confusing for him):

```
sage: F1.<a,b,c>=FreeGroup()
sage: F2.<a,b>=FreeGroup()
sage: r=a*b/a
sage: r.parent()
Free Group on generators {a, b}
sage: r in F1
True
sage: F1/[r]

```

This is because the relations are not converted to the free group.

This patch just converts the relations to the parent, solving this and, besides, allowing things like 

```
sage: F1/[[1,2,3,-1,-2,-3],[1,3]]
Finitely presented group < a, b, c | a*b*c*a^-1*b^-1*c^-1, a*c >
```

This ticket prompts the following question:

```
sage: F1.<a> = FreeGroup()
sage: F2.<b> = FreeGroup()
sage: F1.quotient([b])
Finitely presented group < a | a >
```

Should this be the intended behavior, or should the user get a warning about `b` not being a generator of `F1`.

Perhaps this is the root cause:

```
sage: F1(b)
a
```

Yes, that is indeed a problem (maybe worth anothet ticket?). In fact, it is a potentially more confusing behaviour:

```
sage: F.<a,b>=FreeGroup()
sage: G.<b,a>=FreeGroup()
sage: F(a)
b
```

The reason is that FreeGroup._self_element_constructor_ just considers the Tietze list of the argument, and constructs the element of self with the same list. Maybe we should include a test to check if all the generators of the argument are generators of self, and in that case, make the appropriate translation.

Thanks for the explanation.  Yes, that example looks even worse!

Definitely another ticket - the wording here just suggested the experiment so I tossed it on.  Let's not add anymore to this.  Let me know if you want me to initiate a ticket (though, I won't be writing the fix).
