Concretely, I am missing the crucial `save` function, which writes a polymake object out as an XML file.

These functions are made available in #24905 .... but `save` is still not accessible - that's shadowed by the Sage method of the same name.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Docstring of `PolymakeFunctionElement::__call__`:

```
        We consider both member functions of an element and global functions
        bound to an element::

            sage: p = polymake.rand_sphere(3, 13, seed=12)      # optional - polymake
            sage: p.get_schedule('"VERTICES"')                    # optional - polymake  # random
            sensitivity check for VertexPerm
            cdd.convex_hull.canon: POINTED, RAYS, LINEALITY_SPACE : INPUT_RAYS
            sage: p.minkowski_sum_fukuda(p).F_VECTOR            # optional - polymake
            13 33 22
```

Is this useful at all? This seems to cause the `bounding_box` clash.

```
