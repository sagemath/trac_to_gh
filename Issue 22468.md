Keywords: days84

Examples for current failures:

```
    sage: polymake.application("tropical")
    sage: p = polymake.cartesian_product(polymake("uniform_linear_space<Max>(3,2)"),
    ....:                                polymake("uniform_linear_space<Max>(3,1)"))
```
Fails because `cartesian_product` is a Sage method already.

```
    sage: polymake.application("polytope")
    sage: c = polymake.cube(3)
    sage: c.save("cube3.poly")
```
Fails because `save` is a Sage method already.

```
    sage: polymake.application("tropical")
    sage: l = polymake("uniform_linear_space<Min>(3,2)")
    sage: l.bounding_box(1)                    
```
Clashes with the polymake global function of the same name.

These functions are made available in #24905 .... but `save` is still not accessible - that's shadowed by the Sage method of the same name.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Docstring of `PolymakeFunctionElement::__call__`:

```
        We consider both member functions of an element and global functions
        bound to an element::

            sage: p = polymake.rand_sphere(3, 13, seed=12)      # optional - polymake
            sage: p.get_schedule('"VERTICES"')                    # optional - polymake  # random
            sensitivity check for VertexPerm

            13 33 22
```
Is this useful at all? This seems to cause the `bounding_box` clash.
