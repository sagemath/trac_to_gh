Keywords: ascii unicode art

Tableaux have nice unicode art, but skew tableaux do not. This makes the `ascii_art_table` method of `Tableau` into a general purpose method for printing tables.

patchbot also complains about missing first lines for the encoding declarations, but I am not sure at all if this is pertinent still
