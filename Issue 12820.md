Assignee: @williamstein

I reported the issue to upstream and proposed a patch, for details, see http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1317

I suggested a patch to not call mp_set_memory_functions if it will be a noop (when not handling signals), and upstream suggests fixing it in sagemath side by saving and restoring pointers when calling pari_init_opts.

Sage simply removes the mp_set_memory_functions call in the pari spkg, but I believe my proposed solution is better, and I am doing it in my work to build a sagemath package using system wide packages.
