The cross-intersection of two
      such partitions `P=\{P_1,P_2,P_3\}` and `P'=\{P'_1,P'_2,P'_3\}` being
      defined as `\{P_i\cap P_j: 1\leq i,j\leq 3\}`,

there is something strange in this definition: the 2nd part does not use `P'` at all.
Also, a space before `\cap` will make it more readable online.

well, the branch is not public, and you complain bitterly when I start changing the branch on your ticket to something else, so it seems to be quicker to let you fix it :-)

IMHO, these ` cap ` and ` cup ` ought to be replaced by unicode symbols. I wonder if this would break html or pdf docs...
