The cross-intersection of two
      such partitions `P=\{P_1,P_2,P_3\}` and `P'=\{P'_1,P'_2,P'_3\}` being
      defined as `\{P_i\cap P_j: 1\leq i,j\leq 3\}`,

there is something strange in this definition: the 2nd part does not use `P'` at all.
Also, a space before `\cap` will make it more readable online.

right, but how about the space in front of `\cap` ? It really does make a difference for online docs (ones you get from sage: blah?)

well, the branch is not public, and you complain bitterly when I start changing the branch on your ticket to something else, so it seems to be quicker to let you fix it :-)

IMHO, these ` cap ` and ` cup ` ought to be replaced by unicode symbols. I wonder if this would break html or pdf docs...

Hmmmmmm... That makes sense. You should ask that on sage-devel.

there is a missing `\` after `i` in 

```
 into `\{\{a,b,c\},\{d,e,f\},\{g,h,i}\}`. The cross-intersection of two
```

fixed in the last commit of `public/19350`

I checked that pdf docs build with this fix.
