That's a configuration that was causing trouble in #29706 and is so far not tested in the [GitHub](GitHub) CI tests.

I'll repeat a comment I made at #29706: I really needed an environment without homebrew to replicate the failures; just having a minimal homebrew installation, or having one with temporarily moved `pkgconfig` directories, wasn't enough to get the failures.

(So I'm emphasizing that I'm agreeing with the summary: "without homebrew".)

Looks reasonable.

Can you provide an example of this ticket in action (you probably have been using it already anyway?).

What's `symengine_py`?

The `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES` adjustments are used in #29766.
