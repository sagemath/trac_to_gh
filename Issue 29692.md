I'll repeat a comment I made at #29706: I really needed an environment without homebrew to replicate the failures; just having a minimal homebrew installation, or having one with temporarily moved `pkgconfig` directories, wasn't enough to get the failures.

(So I'm emphasizing that I'm agreeing with the summary: "without homebrew".)
