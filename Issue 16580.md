New OA ! 

Right now the patch is a bit "virtual" as there as so many dependencies (all of them broken by the last release) that it is impossible to base something on top of that. But the code is there, and it will just need to be rebased when all dependencies will be dealt with.

Small review commit at `u/vdelecroix/16817`... and *then* you can set to positive review.

(I removed the last commit which produced hellish conflicts with #16846. We will integrate it to another ticket)
