# Issue 22797: Remove "sage --bdist" from top-level README.md

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2017-05-19 14:58:21

Sage's top-level README.md file mentions using `sage --bdist`, which no longer exists (as of #20163). This should be cleaned up.
