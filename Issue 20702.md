```
The eval function of `SphericalHarmonic` uses pexpect-Maxima:

```
        if n in ZZ and m in ZZ and n > -1:
            if abs(m) > n:
                return ZZ(0)
            return maxima("spherical_harmonic({},{},{},{})".format(
                ZZ(n), ZZ(m), maxima(theta), maxima(phi))).sage()
```

This should be replaced by `maxima_lib` or something different without Maxima.

Part of #17753.

The only calls to `atan2(x,y)` are in `revolution_plot3d()` and if I remove all its doctests it still crashes on build at this point, so I no longer know where to look. Either the 3d plot number 35 or the uncompiled `plot3d.rst` would be necessary.

Apart from the bug at hand I think Pynac's `atan2_eval` should return unsigned infinity instead of throwing an exception. There is a reason `atan2(0,0)` is called however.

The new code makes `Y` expand immediately, and the `real/imag` calls then really blow it up.

```
sage: x=abs(real(Y))
sage: x.subs(theta==0)
...
RuntimeError: arctan2_eval(): arctan2(0,0) encountered
sage: y=abs(imag(Y))
sage: y.subs(theta==0)
...
RuntimeError: arctan2_eval(): arctan2(0,0) encountered
sage: Y
1/4*sqrt(6)*sqrt(5)*sqrt(sin(theta)^2)*cos(theta)*e^(I*phi)/sqrt(pi)
sage: Y.subs(theta==0)
0
```

So it seems the `real/imag` expansions produce results in some cases that are not defined at zero, so are not correct.
