An aside about the rapid-fire update problem mentioned at [comment:1:ticket:7267 #7267].  Even if `auto_update=False`, the browser piles on callbacks.  This is understandable.  But clicking "Update" before the browser runs through the backlog --- when the "spinner" is still active --- sends the queued events to the server.
