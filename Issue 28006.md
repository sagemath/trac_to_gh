# Issue 28006: Accelerate `is_cactus()`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28243

Original creator: @r-barnes

Original creation time: 2019-07-23 21:04:29

Keywords: cactus

[This proof](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-prove-that-for-the-cactus-graph-number-of-edges-is-at-most-floor-1-5*-n-1-n-number-of-vertices-floor-is-rounding-down) could be used to accelerate `is_cactus()` by providing a quick O(1) check that can detect a large class of graphs which are not cactuses. This, in turn, would be helpful for situations where `is_cactus()` is applied to large graphs.

(I have not yet found an academic citation for the theorem.)

Changing component from group theory to graph theory.

If you are not able to double check the proof, it's better to find a reference (article, school book, etc.). This looks like a class exercise...

Actually, fill free to add the test without reference. This result is well known and often used as an exercise. Furthermore, this is a tight bound and we have graphs reaching it.

```
sage: for n in range(1, 10):
....:     G = graphs.FriendshipGraph(n)
....:     G.size() == 3 * (G.order() - 1) / 2
....:     
True

Replying to [comment:8 gh-tabus]:
Here it is. Is there anything else that should be done?

For this simple test, this is enough.
