Your check doesn't result in any speedup when the list passes as it has to check every element and has to double check when it fails. I think you're better off just running the filter directly:

```python
ieqs = [ v for v in list if not all(self._is_zero(x) for x in v) ]
```

The other option would be a more hybrid approach like this:

```python
for i,v in enumerate(ieqs):
    if all(self._is_zero(x) for x in v):
        ieqs = ieqs[:i] + [v for v in ieqs[i+1:] if all(self._is_zero(x) for x in v))
        break
```

Although I think always filtering is best because it is the simplest code-wise.
