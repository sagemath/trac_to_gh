The combinat reference manual pages have some confusing aspects. The [root systems page](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/root_system/__init__.html#sage-combinat-root-system), for example: if I look at the table of contents, I see

- Root system data for folded Cartan types
- Root system data for reducible Cartan types

but if I visit the first of those pages, the "Next topic" is a different page altogether, "Root system data for Cartan types with marked nodes". This last page does not appear anywhere in the table of contents, by the way, so it's not clear how anyone is supposed to find it without just accidentally stumbling across it.

I haven't done a systematic study of these pages, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were more such instances. I think these arise from conflicts between the pages generated from the `__init__.py` files and those coming from `src/doc/en/reference/combinat/module_list.rst`.
