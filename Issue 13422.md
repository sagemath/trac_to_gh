# Issue 13422: implement gcd for padics

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13626

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2012-10-19 14:27:32

Assignee: roed

Currently, there is no gcd for padic numbers:

```
sage: R = Zp(3)
sage: R.one().gcd(R.zero())
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.padics.padic_capped_relative_element.pAdicCappedRelativeElement' object has no attribute 'gcd'
```


The attached patch implements it.

rebased and converted to git branch; minor changes to authorship/copyright lines

merges cleanly from master branch (sage 6.0), although there seems to be a problem with the trac merging plugin . . . I've tried with and without including the commits from #13441

Julian,

I get the following


```
sage: R=Zp(3)
sage: a=R(O(3^3))
sage: a.gcd(3^4)
3^3 + O(3^23)
```


In this case, I would expect that the gcd is O(3^3), because a is an element of valuation at least 3. What do you think?

Also, if I compare your branch with develop there are two unused import statements:


```
from sage.libs.pari.gen import PariError
import sage.rings.rational_field
```

Thanks for having a look at this. You are right. I changed the behaviour.

The code looks good now, I have made some small changes. Julian, if you agree with my changes, put the ticket in positive review
