# Issue 23063: non-absolute import in BasisExchangeMatroid

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23300

Original creator: Stefan

Original creation time: 2017-06-21 16:59:36

CC:  rudi yomcat zgershkoff

Keywords: import, isomorphism, matroids

The following should not give an error:

```
sage: N = Matroid(field=GF(3), reduced_matrix=[[1,1],[1,-1]])
sage: M = matroids.Uniform(2,4)
sage: N._isomorphism(M)
```

The problem is a non-absolute import statement.

Fixed this. Turns out another instance occurred in the _is_isomorphism method in the same file, which I also fixed.

The methods work without errors when I compare basis exchange matroids to rank matroids, circuit closure matroids, and prototype graphic matroids.

Reviewer name.

However, I would say a better (well, at least cleaner IMO) idiom is to just import what you need

```diff
-            from . import basis_matroid
-            ot = basis_matroid.BasisMatroid(other)
+            from .basis_matroid import BasisMatroid
+            ot = BasisMatroid(other)
```
