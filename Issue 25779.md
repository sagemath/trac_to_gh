This fixes a few errors that occurred in Python 3, and in the process performs some other cleanup tasks that stood out in this module, though there's lots more cleaning up that could be done here.

This doesn't fix *all* the tests for this module on Python 3, as there are still some failures due to sets being displayed in different orders and things like that--but most of them seem trivial.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26016

FWIW, perhaps if nothing else those guidelines need to be revisited or slightly reworded.

I do actually rather like these `help()` methods.  I have no idea why they just happen to be on classes for sandpiles.  I guess whoever implemented this module wanted it--or maybe it came from a separate package that wasn't originally part of Sage.

My inclination is almost to move the `_sandpile_help()` function to a generic method on `SageObject` (in which case then yes, it *would* get an `EXAMPLES` section in the docstring), and have all these classes inherit from `SageObject`.
