# Issue 34478: tox.ini: Add gentoo-python3.11

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34715

Original creator: @sheerluck

Original creation time: 2022-11-02 14:16:44

Similar to #32838 but this time thanks to `docker.yml` we need two one-liners only

Branch for this ticket can be formed from ​[single commit in fork](https://github.com/sheerluck/sage/commit/e2d38e282ff701f3c79970eca7c54b5613d49526).

To test this ticket one needs #33842 and also to **bump LT_VERSION to 3.12.0**

```diff

```

and it seems like sagemath is not ready for that yet :(
