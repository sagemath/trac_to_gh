Building sage outputs a lot. Especially in highly parallelized builds, the output is not very useful. 

We should have an option to silence the build. 
Then it should simply say:

```
[cvxopt-1.1.8.p1] Logging to '/Users/mkoeppe/cvs/sage/logs/pkgs/cvxopt-1.1.8.p1.log'
[cvxopt-1.1.8.p1] Using cached file /Users/mkoeppe/cvs/sage/upstream/cvxopt-1.1.8.tar.gz
[cvxopt-1.1.8.p1] Setting up build directory for cvxopt-1.1.8.p1
[cvxopt-1.1.8.p1] Building and installing
[cvxopt-1.1.8.p1] Installation completed
```


A possible interface is to mimic [Automake silent rules](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Automake-Silent-Rules.html#Automake-Silent-Rules):
`make V=0` 
would request the silent mode. `./configure --enable-silent-rules` would make this the default.

Two comments: 

- in the past (see #12729, for example), there were objections (by Jeroen, and maybe others) to not producing the full `install.log` file as is done now: this can be useful for debugging race conditions.

- I think the output hard to read. I would like something like the proposed output at #12729 better. That is, change

```
Running 'sage-spkg mpc-1.0.3.p0', output appears in /path/to/SAGE_ROOT/log/pkgs/mpc-1.0.3.p0.log ...
Running 'sage-spkg mpc-1.0.3.p0', output appears in /path/to/SAGE_ROOT/log/pkgs/mpc-1.0.3.p0.log ... done
```

 to something like

```
[mpc-1.0.3.p0] installing. Log file: logs/pkgs/mpc-1.0.3.p0.log
  [mpc-1.0.3.p0] installed successfully.
```

 The path to the log file should be given relative to `SAGE_ROOT`, which shortens the message, making it less likely that the line wraps, since line-wrapping is part of what makes the output hard to read.

Okay, so I assume that if this is merged, `configure` will automatically be updated.

This doesn't silence warnings, maybe it's not silencing STDERR, only STDOUT. So I see messages on the screen like

```
make[3]: warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
make[3]: `/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/TESTING/sage/local/var/lib/sage/installed/zlib-1.2.8.p0' is up to date.
```

I want to see warnings if there is a serious problem, but it would be nice if I didn't have to see these minor ones.

I'm also seeing many lines of the form

```
cp /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/TESTING/sage/src/ext/doctest/invalid/syntax_error.tachyon /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/TESTING/sage/local/share/sage/ext/doctest/invalid/syntax_error.tachyon
```

I guess they come from the target `$(SAGE_EXTCODE)`. I think that output should be silenced, too, or at least abbreviated ("[sage-extcode] installing...").
