CC:  @vbraun @tornaria

As discussed in #32973, the default value of `--warn-long` is roughly a minute, independent of the `--long` flag. Our developers' guide suggests that even a "long time" test should complete in under five seconds,

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/doctesting.html#optional-arguments

so I think it's fair to warn about non-long-time tests that take longer than (say) ten seconds.

Volker, any idea why we used wall time for the limit rather than CPU time? It's making it a bit awkward to pick a multiplier when no timing information is available (which is usually the case for me).

If you're referring to psutil, it's mainly a C package and consists of nothing BUT platform-specific code. The version we had was almost five years out of date and required a huge unmaintained patch that was rejected entirely by upstream. I'll take the ten lines we have now instead.

Worst case, we can get the information from the OSX kernel with a another five lines of code.

Yes but if mkoeppe ever gets hit by a bus, the rest of us will be crushed under 25 hours/day of package upgrades and maintenance. I appreciate all you do, but there's a huge cost to every additional dependency measured over the years.

There's a point after which I agree, but assuming that the package itself causes zero problems: every distro needs to package it and keep it upgraded, and every user needs to install it every time they build sage (wasting time, space, and bandwidth), and every upstream release usually gets a ticket->branch->test->review cycle within sage itself.

The total amount of code we're talking about is less than the text files in `build/pkgs/psutil` contained. It's in a non-critical location in a pseudo-private, non-user-facing function. We'll go years without ever thinking about it.

I ran this on GH but the actions page has been failing to load for a week. I've reported it to GH and a fix is "being worked on." Aside from that, I think it's ready for review.

In the spirit of "do no harm," I have avoided outputting CPU time statistics wherever possible to avoid outputting confusing numbers on macOS. Nevertheless, in context, the lack of fast CPU time for subprocesses on macOS is not a deal-breaker: the only situation where it will be missed is if a subprocess takes a lot of CPU and would normally violate the `--warn-long` limit, and instead appears to run fast on macOS. But the status quo is that using wall time already makes `--warn-long` useless; and false negatives are not harmful. If the purpose of `--warn-long` is to prevent slow tests from being added to sage, then we only need `--warn-long` to trigger *somewhere* (e.g. the patchbots), and not *everywhere*. Overlooking the occasional warning for certain tests on one platform isn't contrary to that goal, and in any case is not worse than what we already have -- no usable warnings at all.

Of course I'll open a follow-up ticket for adding the macOS accounting should anyone care to do it.
