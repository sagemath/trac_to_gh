I am not convinced there is much point in abstract methods, which leads to duplication of examples and tests, but in any way:

- `leaving_coefficients` has wrong documentation

Replying to [comment:5 novoselt]:
> I am not convinced there is much point in abstract methods, which leads to duplication of examples and tests,

I think it's quite nice in combination with `_test_not_implemented_methods` and as a documentation of the interface.

> - `leaving_coefficients` has wrong documentation
> - `column_coefficients` has wrong documentation twice

Fixed.

It would be nice if documentation of abstract methods somehow "propagated" to concrete implementations so that there were no copy-pasted duplication. But that's of course orthogonal to this ticket.

I suppose one could copy `__doc__` from the abstract method to the concrete one, but I'm not sure whether the patchbot that watches over code coverage would be happy.
