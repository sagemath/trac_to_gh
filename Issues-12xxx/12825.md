1. GCC-4.7.x on ia64 is very broken.  We should install GCC in this case.  Note that currently it won't actually work as MPIR and MPFR fail to build with gcc-4.7.x on ia64.  For MPIR, see #11616; for MPFR, see #12837.

2. When Debian multiarch is detected, do not install GCC.  The stderr of "gcc -v -E -x c /dev/null" says:

Maybe a leading space or `grep '[^=]/usr/include/.'` is sufficient?

The multiarch detection works on Ubuntu 11.10, x86-64, and Ubuntu 12.04, i386. I also tested this on Arch Linux, which just upgraded to gcc 4.7, and it correctly decided to install our gcc spkg.

Note that Ubuntu 11.04 (with gcc-4.5.2) uses the multiarch stuff, and your script misses that because it looks for version 4.6.*. However, the compilation seems to work properly. (That was Ubuntu's first multiarch release, so perhaps the "old method" still worked there?) Also, I don't think we need to prioritize support for that release.

So, positive review, unless someone objects to building our gcc if the system gcc is older than 4.4.

I'd still change the `grep` pattern to not match typical `--with-gxx-include-dir` `configure` options.

Btw., it seems Ubuntu / Debian changed the multi-arch stuff in 12.04 such that there only setting `LIBRARY_PATH`  would be necessary (unless one created symbolic links for `crt?.o`); i.e., there's now a symbolic link from `/usr/include/asm/` to (e.g.) `x86_64-linux-gnu/asm/`.  (Dan, can you confirm that?  In your case it would presumably be a link to `i386-linux-gnu/asm/`.)

---

According to GCC bugzilla, the two bugs referred to for [FSF] GCC 4.6.![01] are both fixed in 4.6.1, so I'm not sure whether 4.6.1 would be [too] broken for Sage, or on which platforms.

Hmmm, `gcc` should actually be `$CC`, since we tested the version of the latter (and would use that one to build GCC anyway).

The `grep` should be ok, although the safest way would probably be to search for (literally) `multiarch`, which is contained in the configure options (e.g. `--enable-multiarch`), and/or the command line of `cc1` (`-imultiarch <system triplet>`).

GCC 4.6.1 as released doesn't have these bugs, but pre-releases of GCC-4.6.1 do still have those bugs.  Basically I provided a work-around for this GCC bug in some spkg but somebody still had problems because he had a pre-release of GCC 4.6.1 (I don't know whether it came with the system or whether he installed it himself).

Positive review to attachment:12825_change_include_grep.patch, which works correctly in Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04.

> Btw., it seems Ubuntu / Debian changed the multi-arch stuff in 12.04 such that there only setting `LIBRARY_PATH`  would be necessary (unless one created symbolic links for `crt?.o`); i.e., there's now a symbolic link from `/usr/include/asm/` to (e.g.) `x86_64-linux-gnu/asm/`.

In my 12.04 virtual machine, there's no symlink in `/usr/include`. If I don't set the include paths, gcc fails to build. I don't know about Debian, as I don't have any Debian VMs installed.
