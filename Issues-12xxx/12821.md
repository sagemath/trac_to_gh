If CC="gcc -m32" (for example), then the following will fail:

```
$ testcc.sh $CC
Usage: spkg/bin/testcc.sh name_or_path_to_the_C_compiler
[...]
```

We should allow `testcc.sh` to accept multiple arguments and use all of them to run the C compiler (similarly for `testcxx.sh`): 

**Apply** [attachment:12821_testcc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12821/12821_testcc.patch) to the SAGE_ROOT repository.

We also need to fix libm4rie, which does `testcc.sh "$CC"`:

<a id='comment:5'>**Comment 5:**</a>
Stylewise, I'd use `[ $# -lt  1 ]`.

The usage should say "`$0 name_or_path_to_the_C_compiler [optional arguments]`".

I'd also use `$@` instead of `"$@"`, then quoting `$CC` doesn't hurt (so you wouldn't have to change the M4RIE spkg either), and the latter won't work as probably expected.

It's also a bit funny to use `grep ... | sed ...`; a single invocation of `sed` is sufficient.  (At least he didn't use `... | cat | ...` ;-) )

I think quoting `$CC` should hurt because it's wrong.

One must not run

```
"$CC" foo.c -o foo
```
so I think one should also not run

```
testcc.sh "$CC"
```

You can't say it's wrong.  But using `"$@"` would only make sense if one e.g. did

```sh
testcc.sh "$CC" "some argument with spaces" otherargument
# (if $CC is actually a single pathname with spaces in it)

# or, likewise
testcc.sh $CC "some argument with spaces" otherargument
```
which I think nobody will do.

Positive review for the patch to `testcc.sh` **if you remove the extra `grep`**... ;-)




The (patch to the) M4RIE spkg needs work anyway:

```sh
if [ "$COMPILER"  = "GNU" ] ; then 
    ...
```

(`testcc.sh` never returns `GNU`, at most `GCC`.)

The test for the compiler used in M4RIE's `spkg-install` to add specific flags is still a bit weird; you could just use `testcflags.sh` for all of this, although `+ z` is currently a bit problematic (in case the space is really required), because `testcflags.sh` tests the flags one by one, and passing `"+ z"` as a single parameter to it might not work either, since the compiler most probably doesn't expect it to be passed as a single argument.

But the quoting in `testcflags.sh` wouldn't work as expected anyway, so you could just omit the quotes there *when calling the compiler* with previous and the currently to be tested flags.






If `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, `-O0` should be **ap**pended to `CFLAGS`, as it was.

I'd move the usage instructions from the comment into the error message given if `CC` isn't set, and add `$# -eq 0` (or `$# -lt 1`) to the test, such that calling `testcflags.sh` without arguments outputs its usage.

A few more comments:

* The scripts could respect `TMP` and `TMPDIR` if set.

* On Cygwin `-o foo` will create `foo.exe`, so that should (also) be removed.

* Using `sed -n '/^[A-Z]/s/ *gp'` is much faster than `sed -n 's/ *g;/^[A-Z]/p'`.

* In `spkg/install`, there should be a way to bypass the installation of GCC (if the compiler isn't GCC), e.g. if `SAGE_PORT=yes` (?).  Or is there already such?

Doesn't look like.  (Although one can set `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no`.)

Quite unrelated, but from `spkg/install` (i.e., while we're at it):

```sh
if [ -z "$SAGE_FORTRAN" ]; then
    if command -v gfortran >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
        SAGE_FORTRAN=gfortran
    elif command -v g95 >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
        SAGE_FORTRAN=g95
    elif command -v g77 >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
        SAGE_FORTRAN=g77
    fi
fi
```
ignores settings of `FC` and `F77`, the standard variables containing the Fortran compiler.

The created `sage_fortran` script hardcodes `-m64` (and ignores `FFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, `F77FLAGS` etc.).

Don't know whether that's really intentional, but also the *current setting* of `SAGE_FORTRAN` is hardcoded into the script, such that later changing `SAGE_FORTRAN` has no effect.

You're certainly right that there are some issues here, but that's totally outside of the scope of this ticket.

What's `TMP`?  I agree on `TMPDIR`, which is the standard way of specifying a temporary directory.

> On Cygwin `-o foo` will create `foo.exe`, so that should (also) be removed.

Fair enough.

Those two commands aren't equivalent.

> In `spkg/install`, there should be a way to bypass the installation of GCC.

You can set `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no`.

I apparently had trailing spaces on the lines with compiler names...

```sh
sed -n '/^[A-Z]/s/[ ]*//gp'
```
does it, although we shouldn't have spaces on these lines anyway (in which case the substitution of course would be superfluous).

New version of [attachment:12821_testcc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12821/12821_testcc.patch) needs review.

I disagree about appending `-O0`.  I think the user's `CFLAGS` should always override the SPKG's `CFLAGS` without exceptions.  What if the user for some reason wants `--enable-debug` but still `-O2`?

In any case, the following would be very inconsistent:

```sh
if [ "x$SAGE_DEBUG" = "xyes" ]; then
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -O0"
   ENABLE_DEBUG="--enable-debug"
else
   CFLAGS="-O2 $CFLAGS"
   ENABLE_DEBUG=""
fi
```

That's stupid:

'foobar' is not a recognized processor for this target (ignoring processor)
