```
The format for optional tests is:

```
sage:   the_test   # optional - package_or_other_name
```
But in databases/symbolic_data.py, we find

```
sage: search_src('optional', 'database_symbo')
databases/symbolic_data.py:33:    sage: sd = SymbolicData(); sd # optional requires database_symbolic_data
databases/symbolic_data.py:36:    sage: sd.ZeroDim__example_1 # optional requires database_symbolic_data
databases/symbolic_data.py:39:    sage: sd.Katsura_3 # optional requires database_symbolic_data
...
```

Using "requires" doesn't work, though you can optional put that after the dash.

All optional doctests in symbolic_data.py:

```

Before the patch:


```
$ sage -t -verbose -only-optional=database_symbolic_data symbolic_data.py 
sage -t -verbose -only-optional=database_symbolic_data "devel/sage-devel/sage/databases/symbolic_data.py"
	 [0.1 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 0.1 seconds
```

And after the patch,

```
$ sage -t -verbose -only-optional=database_symbolic_data symbolic_data.py
...
31 passed and 0 failed.
```

His is the better patch.
