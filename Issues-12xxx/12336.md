```
The format for optional tests is:

```
sage:   the_test   # optional - package_or_other_name
```
But in databases/symbolic_data.py, we find

```
sage: search_src('optional', 'database_symbo')
databases/symbolic_data.py:33:    sage: sd = SymbolicData(); sd # optional requires database_symbolic_data
databases/symbolic_data.py:36:    sage: sd.ZeroDim__example_1 # optional requires database_symbolic_data
databases/symbolic_data.py:39:    sage: sd.Katsura_3 # optional requires database_symbolic_data
...
```

Using "requires" doesn't work, though you can optional put that after the dash.

All optional doctests in symbolic_data.py:

```
$ sage -t -verbose -only-optional symbolic_data.py
...
31 passed and 0 failed.
```

Before the patch:


```
$ sage -t -verbose -only-optional=database_symbolic_data symbolic_data.py 
sage -t -verbose -only-optional=database_symbolic_data "devel/sage-devel/sage/databases/symbolic_data.py"
	 [0.1 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 0.1 seconds
```

And after the patch,

```
$ sage -t -verbose -only-optional=database_symbolic_data symbolic_data.py
...
31 passed and 0 failed.
```

His is the better patch.

It's annoying for me to review documentation from home thanks to #12276 (I have to rebuild a chunk of my system or the HTML looks like hell), but I can do it tonight. I've got to build beta2 anyway.

I know this is silly, but since the patch touches them all, can you change EXAMPLE to EXAMPLES? At least for the one with multiple examples (I prefer them to be consistent, but don't care all that much).

Other than that, the patch is fine and the new docs look great.
