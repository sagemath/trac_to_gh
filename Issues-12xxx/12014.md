The `__iter__()` method in `devel/sage/sage/coding/linear_code.py` tries to return the codewords standard form of the code. Is there a reason why it does so? This should be left to the gen_mat to provide a systematic generator matrix.

The `list()` method on the other hand doesn't call `__iter__()` at all. It instead calls a more generic method which is actually quite slow. (See [a short discussion in sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/wmaSLdlkn-c/3Nu8Kx8DKZMJ))

I am attaching a patch which makes it faster and makes `list()` call `__iter__()`.

As for the speedup, here is an example. The functions in Sage are the unpatched versions. `list_codewords()` is a function implemented in the file that is loaded with `load( )` and this contains the `iterate()` method present in the patch. (Updated timings after adding this ticket and #13417).

```
sage: C = ReedSolomonCode(7, 3, GF(8, 'a'))
sage: timeit('list(C.__iter__())')         
5 loops, best of 3: 75.8 ms per loop

sage: from code_functions import list_codewords # the previous patch.
sage: timeit('list_codewords(C)') 
625 loops, best of 3: 1.4 ms per loop

sage: C = ReedSolomonCode(7, 3, GF(8, 'a')) # this new patch after adding #13417
sage: timeit('list(C.__iter__())')
625 loops, best of 3: 553 µs per loop
```

In fact, the original patch didn't break any doctests in `devel/sage/sage/coding`. I checked that it also fixes this bug mentioned in the [Sage public notebook bugreports](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA):

''It seems like iterating over the dual of a LinearCode gives a different result from iterating over the .list() of the dual code.
Here is a test case:''

```
sage: G = matrix(GF(2), [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],                        
....: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]])
sage: C = LinearCode(G)
sage: Cperp = C.dual_code()
sage: Cperp_iter = list(iter(Cperp))
sage: Cperp_iter == Cperp.list()
False
sage: Cperp_iter_tuples = map(tuple, Cperp)
sage: Cperp_list_tuples = map(tuple, Cperp.list())
sage: Cperp_iter_tuples == Cperp_list_tuples 
False
```
*According to the documentation by doing `help(Cperp.list)` and `help(Cperp.__iter__)`, they should both be returning the same collection.*

So, I am setting this patch up for review.

The current code for the codeword list does not call GAP. This patch also does not call GAP. I think if it did call, it would be even slower.
