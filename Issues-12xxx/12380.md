The file `sage/combinat/words/nfactor_enumerable_word.py` and its class `Word_nfactor_enumerable` were introduced by ticket #8604. Just when it got merged into Sage, I realized it was a mistake. This class should not exist. The fact that its name was ugly was an indice. All those methods should be in a Language class (see #12225). It would get things a lot cleaner.

Only the class `FiniteWord_class` was inheriting from it, so it farly easy to fix : just move the 14 methods from one class to the other.

Note : this change will be unnoticed by the user.

Ticket #13073 just changed one line in the file `sage/combinat/words/nfactor_enumerable_word.py`, so the patch here does not apply anymore. I just updated the patch (under another name) with the following affected changes :

```diff
$ diff 12380_move_nfactors_methods-sl.patch 12380_move_nfactors_methods-sl-updated.patch 
426c426
< +        from sage.graphs.all import DiGraph
---
> +        from sage.graphs.digraph import DiGraph
1181c1181
< -        from sage.graphs.all import DiGraph
---
> -        from sage.graphs.digraph import DiGraph
```

The reviewer's patch still applies over the new updated one. I agree with the changes made by the reviewer. All tests pass in `sage/combinat/words`. Documentation builds fine. I give a positive review to the reviewer's patch.

Apply 12380_move_nfactors_methods-sl-updated.patch trac_12380_reviewer.patch

Because of changes made for #13073, I will not change the status of the ticket to positive review. I give André a last look at it.
