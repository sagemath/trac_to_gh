1. When testing the file

```
"""
EXAMPLES:

The name blah is undefined::

    sage: blah+blah
    blahblah

Here's a doctest that is out of tolerance::

    sage: 100+10000000000 # abs tol 0.1
    10000000000
    sage: 1+1
    2
"""
```
I get

```
File "/Users/marcostreng/tmp/test.sage", line 6:
    sage: blah+blah
Out of tolerance 10000000000.0 vs 10000000100.0
```
So the error of "blah is undefined" is not printed, while the "out of tolerance" is printed for the wrong test.

2. Also, there is a bug when a test with tolerance is the last test:

```
"""
EXAMPLES:

Doctests with tolerance cannot be followed by empty lines::

    sage: 100+10000000000 # rel tol 0.1
    10000000000
"""
```
yields

```
  File "/Users/marcostreng/.sage//tmp/test_71331.py", line 58
    ... ''', res, 0.1, 're
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

3. The following is documented to work, but actually doesn't work:

```
"""
sage: 1e16     # relative tol 1e-10
10^16

"""
```
Testing this gives

I consider this a feature, not a bug. If we're going to allow arithmetic expressions, where do we draw the line?

```
sage: 1e16    # rel tol 1e-10
100000000^2
sage: 1e16    # rel tol 1e-10
4e15 + 6e15
sage: 1e16    # rel tol 1e-10
solve(1e16 - x, x)[0].rhs()
```

There is also the advantage of being able to write

```
sage: "%g is less than %g" % (sqrt(2), pi)   # rel tol .01
'1.41 is less than 3.14'
```

which is possible because we do a match on floating point literals.

Jeroen, could appropriately change the documentation in [trac_13899-doctest-rebase.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket13899/trac_13899-doctest-rebase.patch.gz)?
