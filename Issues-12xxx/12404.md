The method `is_squarefree()` is incorrect for polynomials over function fields over finite fields:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(GF(3))
sage: R.<T> = K[]
sage: f=T^3-x
sage: f.factor(proof=False)
T^3 + 2*x
sage: f.is_squarefree()
False
```

The method `is_squarefree()` returns `self.derivative().gcd(self).degree() <= 0`. In the example the derivative vanishes which leads to the incorrect behaviour.

As a quick workaround one can do:

```
True in [d>=2 for (f,d) in f.factor(proof=False)]
```

<a id='comment:9'></a>
the documentation of `is_squarefree` says that `f` is not square-free if `g^2`
divides `f` where `g` is a non-unit. In particular `4*x` is not considered
square free by `is_squarefree`, but it is by `squarefree_decomposition`:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: f = 4*x
sage: f.is_squarefree()
False
sage: f.squarefree_decomposition()
(4) * x
```

Sage should be coherent in that matter. Personally I prefer not to decompose the coefficient content.

Moreover the following produces an error:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: f = 2*x^2
sage: f.is_squarefree()
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'is_zero'
```

That is true. I also noted this inconsistency. To not break existing code, I'd rather add a warning section in the docstring. Generally I agree that having `squarefree_decomposition()` factor the content is not what one wants for most purposes.

Would you be ok with just adding a warning and an example showing this problem?

This should not happen when applying the dependency #12988.

Julian, there is a typo in ` trac_12404_warning.patch`: `not to consider to content`
should read `not to consider the content`.

Would it break a lot of code if `is_squarefree` returns False for `4*x`?
Did you try?

Paul
