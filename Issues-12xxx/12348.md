<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

This is how the sparse matrix is being stored:

```
        [...]

        self._matrix = <mpq_vector*> sage_malloc(parent.nrows()*sizeof(mpq_vector))

        [...]
 
        for i from 0 <= i < parent.nrows():
            mpq_vector_init(&self._matrix[i], self._ncols, 0)

```

This even introduces a subtle slowdown when the object is lost because of the deallocation, which puzzled me for some time:

```
            for i from 0 <= i < self._nrows:
                mpq_vector_clear(&self._matrix[i])

```

I wonder if this is indirectly responsible for some of the surprisingly slow sparse routines.
