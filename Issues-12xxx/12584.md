Note that this is backend-dependent:

```

sage: FF = sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_ext_pari.FiniteField_ext_pari
sage: FF(2**16,'a')(2**63)
0
sage: FF(2**32,'a')(2**100)
0
sage: GF(2**16,'a') == FF(2**16, 'a')
True
```

Please move the check into a `TESTS:` block since it is not an example, and end the text line with a double colon `::` as below:

```

We check that :trac:`12584` is fixed::
