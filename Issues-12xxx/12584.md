OverflowError                             Traceback (most recent call last)

OverflowError: long int too large to convert to int

```

Note that this is backend-dependent:

```

sage: FF = sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_ext_pari.FiniteField_ext_pari
sage: FF(2**16,'a')(2**63)
0
sage: FF(2**32,'a')(2**100)
0
sage: GF(2**16,'a') == FF(2**16, 'a')
True
```
