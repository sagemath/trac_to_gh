Please move the check into a `TESTS:` block since it is not an example, and end the text line with a double colon `::` as below:

```
TESTS:

We check that :trac:`12584` is fixed::

    sage: k(2^63)
    0
```

Functionally it looks good. Thanks.

I actually had a tab, since I'd just edited the patch file and my emacs doesn't know tabs in patch files are still evil.

It should be fixed now.
