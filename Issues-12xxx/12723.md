I posted a diff of python-2.7.2.p5 against python-2.7.2.p4 as an attachment.  The actual spkg is available [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/roed/python-2.7.2.p5.spkg).  

Unfortunately it doesn't succeed in installing, and I don't understand why.  I get

```

Skipping patch.

But I didn't touch that patch....  Help would be appreciated, since I haven't updated spkgs very often.
