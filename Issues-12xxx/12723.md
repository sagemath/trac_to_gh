**Attachment:** [python-2.7.2.p5_review.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12723/python-2.7.2.p5_review.patch.gz)

I posted a diff of python-2.7.2.p5 against python-2.7.2.p4 as an attachment.  The actual spkg is available [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/roed/python-2.7.2.p5.spkg).  

Unfortunately it doesn't succeed in installing, and I don't understand why.  I get

```

Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n]

Skipping patch.
2 out of 2 hunks ignored -- saving rejects to file Lib/distutils/command/sdist.py.rej
Error: Patch "../patches/Lib.distutils.command.sdist.patch" failed to apply.
```

But I didn't touch that patch....  Help would be appreciated, since I haven't updated spkgs very often.
