```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: E.period_lattice?
...
Docstring:
       Returns the period lattice of the elliptic curve.
    
       INPUT:
    
       * "embedding" - ignored (for compatibility with the period_lattice
         function for elliptic_curve_number_field)
    
       OUTPUT:
    
       (period lattice) The PeriodLattice_ell object associated to this
       elliptic curve (with respect to the natural embedding of QQ into
       RR).
...
```
The documentation speaks of "the" period lattice of E, but to define a period lattice one needs an invariant differential as well.  From the documentation, it is not clear to me which differential is chosen here.

It could be either that or a NÃ©ron differential, or perhaps people use other normalizations.  I really didn't know which one was chosen or what is considered to be "standard" here.  Thanks for clarifying!
