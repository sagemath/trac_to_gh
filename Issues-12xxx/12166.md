sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: E.period_lattice?
...
Docstring:
       Returns the period lattice of the elliptic curve.
    
       INPUT:
    
       * "embedding" - ignored (for compatibility with the period_lattice
         function for elliptic_curve_number_field)
    
       OUTPUT:
    
       (period lattice) The PeriodLattice_ell object associated to this
       elliptic curve (with respect to the natural embedding of QQ into
       RR).
...
```
The documentation speaks of "the" period lattice of E, but to define a period lattice one needs an invariant differential as well.  From the documentation, it is not clear to me which differential is chosen here.

How pedantic you are!  Of course it means dx/(2y+a1*x+a3), what else?  But feel free to change that (just as I have corrected the title of this ticket).  Don't forget to also look at the function for elliptic curves over number fields (where there is a lot about choosing the real or complex embedding).

It could be either that or a NÃ©ron differential, or perhaps people use other normalizations.  I really didn't know which one was chosen or what is considered to be "standard" here.  Thanks for clarifying!
