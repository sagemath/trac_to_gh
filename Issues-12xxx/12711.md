Summary says it all.  This will make it so that if you attach foo.sage to a worksheet, then you can type 

```
load foo.sage
```
which is desirable, and better than requiring 

```
load DATA+"foo.sage"
```

This is probably not really a Sage ticket, due to where this code will need to go, which is in the code in the notebook server right after it sets the DATA variable.   I just want to record this important feature request (from users) before I forgot.  Sorry.
