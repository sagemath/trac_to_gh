The Cplex Backend (cplex_backend.pxd) allows CPLEX to invoke the maximum number of threads on the system. This might be quite difficulty on a cluster, e.g. condor managed system.

Already found the parameter its:

int CPX_PARAM_THREADS = 1067

PXsetintparam(....,CPX_PARAM_THREADS, #Params);

We could add a parameter to MixedIntegerLinearProgram(..., solver_parameter=Params(#Threads...)...)?
