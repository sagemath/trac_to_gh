The code to create all the illustrations in the forthcoming popular trade book "What is Riemann's Hypothesis?" by Mazur-Stein (to be published by Princeton University Press) is here:  

   http://code.google.com/p/purplesage/source/browse/#hg%2Fpsage%2Frh%2Fmazur_stein

The point of this ticket is to rewrite the code so it is up to snuff for inclusion in Sage, and include it in the core Sage library.  Also, we should add some corresponding interacts to the interact library.
