SVD segfaults depending on the size of a matrix over CDF

```
sage: a = random_matrix(CDF,13,24)
sage: t = a.SVD()
sage: a = random_matrix(CDF,13,22)
sage: t = a.SVD()                 
sage: a = random_matrix(CDF,13,23)
sage: t = a.SVD() 
Boom!
```

It also fails for 30x50 matrices. This happens on debian i386 and x86_64

It was an upstream error that has been fixed in scipy 0.11 that is already in Sage.
It has its own doctest in scipy.
