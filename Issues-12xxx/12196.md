The latex generated for quadratic fields is unclear.

```
sage: Q = QuadraticField(7)
sage: latex(Q)
\Bold{Q}[\sqrt{7}]/(\sqrt{7}^{2} - 7)
```

Compare this with the latex generated for cyclotomic fields:

```
sage: C = CyclotomicField(7)
sage: latex(C)
\Bold{Q}(\zeta_{7})
```

I do not want to change the positive review. But, is it more common the expresion \Bold{Q}[\sqrt{7}]? with brackets [] instead of parenthesis ().

This is also somehow more related with the Sage shortcut to construct some number fields by the command QQ[sqrt(7)].

Just commenting...
