```
When building Sage within a directory with a long name, singular fails to build on OS X 10.4.  For example:

```
$ pwd
/Users/jdemeyer/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-sage-4.8
```

This problem was discovered by the newly added "moufang" (UGent) buildbot.

This is because of a problem with `src/factory/configure` and is fixed by generating `configure` with a more recent `autoconf` version.

Obviously, you shouldn't.  Now that upstream made the same change, you can consider the patch as coming from upstream.

Done.
