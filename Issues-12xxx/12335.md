The doctests in `devel/sage/sage/databases/jones.py` are marked "#optional - jones_database".  These test the optional package `database_jones_numfield-v4.spkg`, so they *should* be labeled "#optional - database_jones_numfield". 

For the record, this was my fault (William Stein) in #4588.  Sorry. 

Apply only attachment:12335.patch. The Macaulay2 fixes are basically irrelevant until that spkg is fixed.
