```
Create a new folder (say, /home/simon/SAGE/work/tests/) and create a file test.pyx with the content

```
class bla(type):
    pass
```

Start sage, attach the file, and you will find something like

```
sage: attach test.pyx
Compiling ./test.pyx...
sage: bla.__module__
'sage: attach test.pyx
Compiling ./test.pyx...
sage: bla.__module__
'_home_simon_SAGE_work_tests_test_pyx_0'
```

Then, create an `__init__.py` file in the same folder. You will find

```
sage: attach test.pyx
Compiling ./test.pyx...
sage: bla.__module__
'_home_simon_SAGE_work_tests_test_pyx._home_simon_SAGE_work_tests_test_pyx_0'
sage: sys.modules.has_key(bla.__module__)
False
```

In fact, even if `__init__.py` is present, the module is still known under the "short" name, but the class doesn't know about it:

```
sage: import _home_simon_SAGE_work_tests_test_pyx_0
sage: _home_simon_SAGE_work_tests_test_pyx_0.bla
<class '_home_simon_SAGE_work_tests_test_pyx._home_simon_SAGE_work_tests_test_pyx_0.bla'>
```

Please change the component if you think that there is one that fits less bad than "misc"...

I'm not yet sure whether that's really a bug, or just confusing.  (If I understand correctly, the presence of an `__init__.py` file was unintentional in your case.)

The behaviour should probably also depend on whether some directory of the path to the attached file is in `PYTHONPATH`.  Haven't yet looked at the code though.




[W.r.t. the component:  "User interface" seems a candidate as well.]

Btw., the output of (in your case)

```
sage: bla?
```
looks different as well, depending on whether an `__init__.py` file is present in the same directory.

*Without* one, there's also:

```
Loaded File:	/home/leif/.sage/temp/sleepless/16739/spyx/_tmp_foo_foo_pyx/_tmp_foo_foo_pyx_0.so
Source File:	/home/leif/.sage/temp/sleepless/16739/spyx/_tmp_foo_foo_pyx/_tmp_foo_foo_pyx_0.so
```
(The attached file is `/tmp/foo/foo.pyx`.)

with an `__init__.py` file present.  (My dummy class is called `bar` rather than `bla`.)

In the temporary build directory, also a symbolic link to `__init__.py` is created:

```

`setup.py` there looks "clean".

So I'm pretty sure -- if at all -- *distutils* are to blame for the unexpected behaviour, although it seems quite reasonable to me.

Nope, actually *Cython* is causing this, since the following does **not** solve your problem (if it really is one):

```diff
diff --git a/sage/misc/cython.py b/sage/misc/cython.py
--- a/sage/misc/cython.py
+++ b/sage/misc/cython.py
@@ -432,6 +432,11 @@

+
 extra_link_args =  ['-L' + SAGE_LOCAL + '/lib']

```

You can verify that Cython changes the module name depending on whether an `__init__.py` file is present by

```sh
$ sage --sh -c 'cython test.pyx' && grep '^#.*__Pyx_MODULE_NAME' test.c`
```

Although it is not yet clear to me how Cython finds the `__init__.py` if I remove it from the temporary build directory, as there's only the symbolic link to the "unrelated" original `.pyx` source file, but probably Cython somehow "knows" about the relation.

No, I'd rather say it's a "user error"... ;-)

Seriously, my above patch didn't work because the link was removed just too late (since I initially thought the problem was caused by distutils, which it is not).

Currently changing the patch to remove the (in your opinion) undesirable link to `__init__.py` earlier, such that `cython`, when invoked, won't see it.

That wouldn't be a solution. Perhaps the user *wants* (for some reason) to have it in the folder (in particular, it is no user error).

I believe that it should simply not matter for attaching files whether or not `__init__.py` is there. Of course, if you have a Python file and want that you can import (not attach) it, then you would create the `__init__.py` (this is why I created it, anyway).

Attaching a file should be independent from importing, and both should simultaneously be possible. So, unlinking `__init__.py` is bad.

Up to yesterday, I was in the belief that "attaching a pyx-file" means that

1. the file is copied into a temporary directory,
2. the compilation is done there, and
3. the module is imported from the temporary directory.

Since the temporary directory would not contain `__init__.py`, there should be no problem, isn't it?

In the temporary build folder?  Not sure whether there are situations where this is needed.

This one works for me:

```

No idea whether it breaks anything else.  Note that you have to run `./sage -b` after changing the file, which in turn causes (for whatever reason) dozens of extension modules to get rebuilt.

In case having `__init__.py` in the temporary build directory is desirable, we could just restore the link after Cython has been run.

Importing in the usual way should still work, since you don't import from the temporary directory, do you?

That's correct.  But in addition, symbolic links to any(!) file in the directory containing the attached file are created in the temporary directory (since e.g. you otherwise wouldn't be able to import or include other files in that directory from the attached file).  Above, I've only changed that part.

That's what I was saying.  (Unless you try to `import __init__` in the attached file...)

I see! So, you are not unlinking it from the original directory.

> That's what I was saying.  (Unless you try to `import __init__` in the attached file...)


Hm. Difficult to tell. If you have files `foo.pyx` and `bar.py` in your folder, and in `foo.pyx` you want to do `from bar import Bar`, then I guess you need to have `__init__.py` in *the folder in which the compilation happens*, isn't it? So, there are situations in which the presence of `__init__.py` in the temporary folder (via a symbolic link) makes sense.

The best solution would be to patch Cython, so that the wrong naming of modules does not occur (in some post above, I think it was shown that the naming is chosen by Cython, not by distutils).

Of course there are other, probably smarter (though not necessarily simpler) ways to achieve this, e.g. by modifying `sys.path` for the attached module, and by passing according `-I` options to `cython` (although I think the generated `setup.py` already takes care of the latter).

I don't think Cython is wrong by what it does, as `__init__.py` files belong to the package (and hence directory) they're contained in, i.e. `.../<package_name>/__init__.py` belongs to `<package_name>`.  

Consequently, all `.py` and `.pyx` files there also belong to that package, hence their module names get the package prefix.

That should IMHO be solvable by importing / loading the module differently, although I think you run into the same if for example you create links to extension modules and import from these rather than their original location.  So I'm not sure if it really is an error.
