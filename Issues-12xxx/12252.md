```
For example,

```
sage: K = NumberField(x^2 +1, 'i'); K
Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: latex(K)
\Bold{Q}[i]/(i^{2} + 1)
```

Some might smirk at this.   Another worse one:

```
sage: latex(QuadraticField(-1))
\Bold{Q}[\sqrt{-1}]/(\sqrt{-1}^{2} + 1)
```


Component: **number fields**
