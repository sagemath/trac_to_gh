sage built on a FreeBSD 64 bit machine fails the test

```
sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/combinat/partition.py"
```

After some googling, I get the impression that long double is at best flaky on FreeBSD.

I am going to suggest the following patch, although it is perhaps not necessary for the i386 version of FreeBSD.

```
