**Attachment:** [trac_12061-doctest_interfaces_psage.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12061/trac_12061-doctest_interfaces_psage.patch.gz)

Form some reason doctesting this file goes into an infinite recursion with twisted, but all the commands work on the Sage command line. I had to run it like this to see the output `.sage/tmp/psage_26566.py` is the file Sage created while trying to doctest.

```
PYTHONVERBOSE=1 ~/Installations/sage-4.7.2/sage -python psage_26566.py 2>&1 | tee ~/test.out
```

And `~/test.out` contains in particular this output just before the infinite recursion starts:

Two functions are not directly or indirectly doctested: `PSage._send_nowait()` and `PSageElement.is_locked()`. Is the latter class even used??

Why add `time.sleep(10)`?

If you do, you also need to add "# long time".

I did this after testing many different inputs and this was one input which doesn't take too long but which also doesn't give the result immediately. So, `time.sleep(10)` is there to wait until the computations are all over.

Is there a better way to test this? Otherwise, I will add `# long time` as you suggested.

There seems to be some weird problem with trac. I am unable to upload the original file since it contained

```
:trac:`1991`
```
instead of

```
:trac:`#1991`
```

Even after I did that change, I am unable to upload it as a .patch file. So I renamed the file and it works.
