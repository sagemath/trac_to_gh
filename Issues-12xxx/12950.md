There is a new Pynac release which contains fixes to:

* #11155: `abs(pi+I) -> pi + I` (upstream from Alexei Sheplyakov)
* #11423: `atan2(0,0)` should be undefined (by Volker Braun)
* #11919: pickling of user defined symbolic functions without custom methods
* #12303: beta should remain symbolic for exact input
* a fix to use Python for comparing Python objects wrapped in numerics (by Jean-Pierre Flori
* complete rewrite of code handling various types of infinity (by Volker Braun)

Following the comments [in this thread on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/WCSK5rRn8h8/discussion), the release without the upstream mercurial directories is available as a tarball:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.2.4.tar.bz2

A tentative spkg is available at:

http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/pynac-0.2.4.spkg

It also adds an .hgignore file to exclude tracking of the src directory.

I've made a tentative spkg available at http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/pynac-0.2.4.spkg  which adds an .hgignore file to exclude the src directory from tracking.

I've had a quick look at the patches which look good overall.
I'll post a patch fixing some (mainly very minor) typos asap.

Oh, so now I'm a little lost.
Some patches are included here and other on the original tickets...
It's surely logical, but I just discovered that.

Anyway, the dependencies between the tickets should be clearly stated and written into the corresponding trac field.
For example, do we really want to merge #11919 now? cos I don't think reviewing this ticket will take ages...
Or, this ticket can not be merged without fixing the atan2 stuff causing failures in revolution_plot3d which is in fact also mentioned in the comments of #11423 .

Thanks for looking into this!

I tried to put all the patches required to make the new version work with Sage on this ticket. If I didn't screw up, the rest should be nonessential, doctests, etc. It used to be a major hassle to create patches for each ticket separately, upload them, then make a ticket with an spkg etc. I think this way is easier for everyone.

> Anyway, the dependencies between the tickets should be clearly stated and written into the corresponding trac field.

I don't think the patch attached to #11919 is necessary. But I'm reluctant to make changes to that ticket while this is being reviewed.

> Or, this ticket can not be merged without fixing the atan2 stuff causing failures in revolution_plot3d which is in fact also mentioned in the comments of #11423 .

This should depend on the yet to be opened ticket mentioned in [#11423 comment:6](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/11423#comment:6). But, changing the plot3d stuff to handle errors in the numerical evaluation phase is a big change (AFAIK, Titus actually had a go at it.), and it is very much independent of a Pynac release, apart from the minor issue that one of the doctests there happened to call `atan2()`.

> Or, do we really want the three lines patch of #11155 there with #12950 as a dependency rather than here?

The doctests on #11155 are minor, so we left that patch out of this ticket. Just now, I made that ticket depend on this one and gave it a positive review.

<div id="comment:11" align="right">Comment 11</div>

I've just uploaded a fix for the revolution_plot3d problem.

When the revolution axis goes through (0,0,0), the previous behaviour was correct although obtained through the general formula which in fact should not have made sense.
In fact the (0,0,0) case is the simplest one, no "complicated" formula for the to be drawn surface has to be deduced from the curve formula.
 
The proposed fix is to treat the special case (0,0,0) separately as far as the phase calculation is concerned.

(PS: We posted more or less at the same time, so this post might seem strange)

<div id="comment:12" align="right">Comment 12</div>

A little concern about the effect of the new numeric ordering, if I understand correctly what happens (not really sure about the initialization of the complex I).
Now the complex I is compared at the Python level.
There it is a root of x2+1, and Sage always returns 1 when you compare whatever*I and whatever_different*I, that is : 5*I > 3*I is true, but so is I > 3*I.

This explains the changes in some doctest output, but I'm concerned that this will surely lead to problems in the pynac internal ordering...

Further rants: in fact in (quadratic) number fields at least we always have whatever > whatever else true and whatever < whatever else false.
Indeed, the `_cmp_` functions test for equality, that is completely understandable because there's no reason to decide that a root of a polynomial is "positive" or "negative" without chosing an embedding somewhere...

But I is defined with embedding=CC.gen(), i.e. the usual definition, and so we have CC(I) considered as "positive" (no surprise here...).

<div id="comment:20" align="right">Comment 20</div>

While updating #11143 I ran into the following issue which occurs when the patches here and the new pynac spkg are installed:

```
sage: integral(e^(-x)*log(x+1), x, 0, oo)
...
ValueError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints; using the 'assume' command before integral evaluation *may* help (example of legal syntax is 'as
sume(Infinity>0)', see `assume?` for more details)
Is  Infinity  positive, negative, or zero?
```

It looks like there is something going on with the conversion of `oo` to `inf` in maxima.

---

Another comment: why are the instances of `Infinity` in the doctest patches here changed to `infinity`. Isn't the upper case `Infinity` the "canonical" Sage infinity?

Did you want to open a ticket about these, or was this just a point of clarification?

On an unrelated note, I'm a little confused as to why all the patches ended up here.  I understand that this is convenient, but what happens then is that a whole bunch of tickets are closed as "sage-invalid/dup" and really they weren't dups at all, they just happened to be fixed by this spkg.  

At any rate, I recommend making sure that such tickets (like #11423, #9547, #12303) are given a normal milestone - even though the fix is here, that didn't make the ticket and its authors/reviewers less valid somehow.

Feel free to change them back to a different milestone. I also hesitated before changing to duplicate/invalid/wontfix. I just needed a way to indicate to Jeroen that these are tickets that can be closed without any work. I also tried to make the authors of those tickets were acknowledged here.
