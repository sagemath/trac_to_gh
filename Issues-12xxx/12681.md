The horrible `Makefile` still uses `CC` for compiling C++ (as well as C), and hardcodes it to `g++`.

The updated spkg (p10) fixes this by using `$(CXX)` for compiling C++, and allows both `CC` and `CXX` in the `Makefile` to get overridden by their respective environment settings.

### lcalc-1.23.p10 (Leif Leonhardy, March 17th 2012)
* #12681: Fix hard-coded 'g++'.
  The (patched) Makefile now uses $(CXX) (which *defaults* to 'g++')
  for compiling and linking C++, $(CC) (which *defaults* to 'gcc') for
  compiling C, although the latter is [currently] hardly used.
  See also "Special Update/Build Instructions" above. (We could now also
  set `INSTALL_DIR` and use 'make install'...)

I apologize in case there are already pending changes to the Lcalc spkg; haven't searched for such (also since the p9 is quite new).

Replying to [@orlitzky](#comment%3A2):
> Same comment as on ratpoints: I think we should avoid adding patches unless absolutely necessary.

Lcalc is a special case in many ways (cf. my reply on #12682), and we have to patch the Makefile anyway (since there's still no `configure`, and therefore the Makefile is supposed to get edited).

Michael Rubinstein would certainly be happy if we sent him some generic solution, but so far nobody found the time for such, as mentioned.




> (Using `$CXX` instead of `g++` is obviously correct; although we should report that upstream too.)

We already did so, IIRC...
Btw., haven't yet looked at the 1.3 (beta) version, which I think is still work in progress.
We can certainly contribute to that, although e.g. Jeroen rejected to make patches more upstream-friendly, i.e. generic (w.r.t. supporting different PARI versions).  Also took me some time to convince people to use `-lgmp` instead of `-lmpir`.
