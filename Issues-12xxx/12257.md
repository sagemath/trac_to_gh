This is just a doctest of a fix already in main Sage.

Original description:

This is really bad

```
sage: 1.0 * pi
pi
sage: sin(1.0 * pi)
0
```
This is good:

```
sage: maxima('sin(%pi*1.0)')
sin(1.0*%pi)
sage: maxima('1.0*%pi')
1.0*%pi
```

This is likely the fault of ginac doing something stupid with 1.0 == 1. 

Ken Ribet pointed this out during the JMM 2012 meeting.

<a id='comment:1'></a>There are two sides to this. Doing the multiplication and printing the coefficient.

GiNaC takes a shortcut when the coefficient is 1 and skips multiplication. There is a Python callback function (`sage.symbolics.pynac.py_get_parent_char`) to check the characteristic of the parent. Pynac forces the operation for positive characteristic. If we return a positive integer from that function when the parent is inexact, the multiplication will go through.

If a coefficient is 1, we don't print it. So the printing code in pynac needs to be changed to print inexact coefficients. This is now [pynac issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/issue/4/).

Even when all these are sorted out, `sin(1.0*pi)` might still return 0. Since `bool(1.0*pi == pi)` will probably be True.

so again if there were a way to have Pynac return "the right" zero...  I think this is kind of philosophy difference is at the root of several little coercion buglets.

There may be a general problem, not only for constants:

```
sage: 1.000000*(x+2)
x + 2
sage: 2.000000*(x+2)
2.00000000000000*x + 4.00000000000000
```
Is this intended?

    "body": "<a id='comment:19'></a>> It should be that sin(1.0*pi)  returns 0.0.  We can fix this somehow. I'm not worried about printing. \n\nEven without this patch, we now get (thanks to Pynac upgrade\n\n```\nsage: sin(1.0*pi)\nsin(1.00000000000000*pi)\n```\nwhich is perhaps also not ideal, if we wanted `0.00000000000` as in the original intent (I guess) of this ticket.  So while I agree that one bug is fixed, perhaps this could be repurposed for that - unless we want to say that `sin(1.0*pi)` is not exact so we don't actually know it's `0.0`, but I feel we don't do that with other things.

<a id='comment:19'></a>> It should be that sin(1.0*pi)  returns 0.0.  We can fix this somehow. I'm not worried about printing. 

Even without this patch, we now get (thanks to Pynac upgrade

```
sage: sin(1.0*pi)
sin(1.00000000000000*pi)
```
which is perhaps also not ideal, if we wanted `0.00000000000` as in the original intent (I guess) of this ticket.  So while I agree that one bug is fixed, perhaps this could be repurposed for that - unless we want to say that `sin(1.0*pi)` is not exact so we don't actually know it's `0.0`, but I feel we don't do that with other things.  For instance, even after the Pynac upgrade in #18362, we have

```
sage: 0.0*pi
0
```
which is really what is at issue here, I guess.  Or?

I don't think you can expect `0.00000000000` but rather `1.22464679914735e-16` which is what you get with `sin(1.0*pi).n()`. I think it's Sage convention (?) that any FP value in an expression should have the effect of automatically applying `N()` to it.

Yes.

The original ticket was about `1.0`. I added to this cases with `-1.0` and `0.0` but when fixing stopped short of fixing the `0.0` cases because they seemed quite different from `+/-1` and I first wanted to fix where I had a good overview without risk of introducing bugs. So, I think it better if we open a ticket for `0.0` because this case may need a separate discussion.

```
only integer +/- 1 gets special treatment
