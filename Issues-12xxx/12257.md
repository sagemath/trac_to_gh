This is just a doctest of a fix already in main Sage.

Original description:

This is really bad

```
sage: 1.0 * pi
pi
sage: sin(1.0 * pi)
0
```
This is good:

```
sage: maxima('sin(%pi*1.0)')
sin(1.0*%pi)
sage: maxima('1.0*%pi')
1.0*%pi
```

This is likely the fault of ginac doing something stupid with 1.0 == 1. 

Ken Ribet pointed this out during the JMM 2012 meeting.

There are two sides to this. Doing the multiplication and printing the coefficient.

GiNaC takes a shortcut when the coefficient is 1 and skips multiplication. There is a Python callback function (`sage.symbolics.pynac.py_get_parent_char`) to check the characteristic of the parent. Pynac forces the operation for positive characteristic. If we return a positive integer from that function when the parent is inexact, the multiplication will go through.

If a coefficient is 1, we don't print it. So the printing code in pynac needs to be changed to print inexact coefficients. This is now [pynac issue #4](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac/issue/4/).

Even when all these are sorted out, `sin(1.0*pi)` might still return 0. Since `bool(1.0*pi == pi)` will probably be True.

Here is another idea.  In [the Ginac source](http://www.ginac.de/reference/mul_8cpp_source.html#l00442), we have

```
00464     } else if (seq_size==1 && overall_coeff.is_equal(_ex1)) {
00465         // *(x;1) -> x
00466         return recombine_pair_to_ex(*(seq.begin()));
```
and that could be somehow changed.  And the other issue is [here](http://www.ginac.de/reference/inifcns__trans_8cpp_source.html#l00303)

```
00319         if (z.is_equal(*_num0_p))  // sin(0)       -> 0
00320             return _ex0;
```
so again if there were a way to have Pynac return "the right" zero...  I think this is kind of philosophy difference is at the root of several little coercion buglets.

There may be a general problem, not only for constants:

```
sage: 1.000000*(x+2)
x + 2
sage: 2.000000*(x+2)
2.00000000000000*x + 4.00000000000000
```
Is this intended?

Even without this patch, we now get (thanks to Pynac upgrade

```
sage: sin(1.0*pi)
sin(1.00000000000000*pi)
```
which is perhaps also not ideal, if we wanted `0.00000000000` as in the original intent (I guess) of this ticket.

For instance, even after the Pynac upgrade in #18362, we have

```
sage: 0.0*pi
0
```
which is really what is at issue here, I guess.  Or?

I don't think you can expect `0.00000000000` but rather `1.22464679914735e-16` which is what you get with `sin(1.0*pi).n()`. I think it's Sage convention (?) that any FP value in an expression should have the effect of automatically applying `N()` to it.

Yes.

The original ticket was about `1.0`. I added to this cases with `-1.0` and `0.0` but when fixing stopped short of fixing the `0.0` cases because they seemed quite different from `+/-1` and I first wanted to fix where I had a good overview without risk of introducing bugs. So, I think it better if we open a ticket for `0.0` because this case may need a separate discussion.

No, I thought wrong, because I cannot find any function that expands an argument containing a FP number and a constant automatically (contrary to FP only).

But this is clearly another ticket and the introduced behaviour of `sin(1.0*pi)` with this ticket is exactly in line with all other functions and arguments at the moment.

I think you need to be slightly more clear what you mean

```

```
floating point numbers +/- 1.0 are treated differently from integers +/- 1
```
