The upstream `Makefile` defines `CC` to `gcc`, which could be overridden by using `make CC="$CC" ...` in `spkg-install` (similar for `INSTALL_DIR`, which the `Makefile` defines to `/usr/local`).

The updated spkg patches the `Makefile` to let `CC` just *default* to `gcc`, and take the value of the environment variable `CC` if the latter is defined (which is *always* the case in Sage, but that doesn't matter).  Similar for `INSTALL_DIR`, such that `spkg-install` can (and does now) make use of the `install-lib` target, also quoting the target filenames to allow spaces in `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

I've also cleaned up `SPKG.txt` and `spkg-install` a little; the latter now also uses `$MAKE` instead of `make`.

I'm not sure whether we should add running some tests (there's a `test` target which does use the built library), or even add an `spkg-check` script; if so, perhaps on a follow-up ticket.  [See also my comment in `SPKG.txt`.]

### ratpoints-2.1.3.p3 (Leif Leonhardy, March 17th 2012)
* #12682: Patch `Makefile` such that the `CC` (and `INSTALL_DIR`) environment
  variable(s) override(s) the setting in the Makefile.
* Some clean-up; use `$MAKE` instead of `make`, also install the library
  with `make` (i.e., `$MAKE`) rather than "by hand".
* TODO:
  - The Makefile has a `test` target; don't know whether we should
    run some tests, and whether it's worth an `spkg-check` script (for
    which we'd presumably have to duplicate the whole `CCFLAGS*` setup).

I think you mean nested functions.  "inline functions" are perfectly fine C99 or C++.
