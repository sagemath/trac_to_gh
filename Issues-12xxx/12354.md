Of course, a big change like this should at least have a vote and discussion on sage-devel.

Rob Beezer points out the preparser doesn't deal so well with newlines, so this patch breaks this valid python syntax:

```
sage: ["1","2","\n;"
....: "2","4"]
....: 
....: 
....: 
....: 
```

and it never quits.
