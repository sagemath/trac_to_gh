PolyBoRi's next minor release is out now.
There were no changes of the interface between PolyBoRi 0.8.0 and 0.8.1, so we just have to update the sources from here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/polybori/files/polybori/0.8.1

### Current spkg
* **Install** http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.8.1.p1.spkg

This also fixes building with GCC-4.7.0, see #12751 for the GCC-4.7.0 metaticket.

A patch might become part of upstream sources eventually.
But `custom.py` is a user configuration file, which will never be upstream itself (of course the mechanism already supported there). 
Of course, we can generate a patch against `/dev/null`. but does it really makes sense?

Ok, answering myself: it's part of the directory `patch`, so of course one should consider it as a patch to upstream. There's no `config` directory mention here http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html , so patching is the only option here.

Should `CCFLAGS` be `CFLAGS`?  If I fix this, I get a similar error for `GD_LIBS`. I ended up applying the following patch:

The spkg-install file is odd, though: some places it refers to `CFLAGS`, others to `CCFLAGS`, so I'm not sure my changes are correct. In any case, it worked on OpenSolaris, but on Solaris I got the same error as before ("Could not detect type sizes"). This may be related to #12369.

Actually only the `pbori` module needs to get rebuilt; while `touch`ing `$SAGE_LOCAL/include/polybori.h` doesn't help, touching `$SAGE_LOCAL/include/polybori/*` does (afterwards running `./sage -b`).




Also builds with GCC 4.7.0 (Sage 5.0.beta10, Ubuntu 10.04.4 x86_64).

I noticed that different flags get passed to `gcc`/`g++` depending on GCC's version, or probably the settings of `CC` and `CXX`.  Seems rather a side-effect than intended behaviour...

W.r.t. M4RI's flags:  It should be sufficient to only pass / add the contents of `__M4RI_SIMD_CFLAGS`, and probably only when compiling *some* of the modules.

`long long` arises from M4RI, but M4RI assumes C99 which knows `long long`. But this is a known problem, I'll add `-Wno-long-long` back to the custom flags in the spkg. (I removed it, because `PolyBoRi` 0.8.1 was improved to be compatible wit c++98.)

This is not related to the upgrade, so I'd prefer a new ticket on this.

This part is now #12799, so I add this as dependency and remove the work issue.

IIRC the problem isn't only *which* files the `pbori` module depends on, but also that the headers have their original file date from upstream, i.e., aren't generated during build nor (currently) `touch`ed from `spkg-install`, such that they'll usually be older than a present `pbori` module.

If one doesn't want to change the timestamps, one could make the `pbori` module just (or also) depend on the `.so` (without a version suffix), since the (target of the) latter will always have a fresh modification time.

The libraries are already listed as `libraries=['polybori', 'polybori_groebner', 'gd', 'png12', 'm4ri']`. Aren't they considered as dependencies anyway?

Of course the libraries are listed, since they need to get linked to the module, but Cython doesn't automatically consider *their* timestamps for dependency checking, i.e., which modules need to get rebuilt.
