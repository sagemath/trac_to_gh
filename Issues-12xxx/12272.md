Add `# long time` in various places, where it is obviously needed (tests taking several seconds).

This should be merged at the end of the sage-5.0 release cycle.

Some of these are behaving suspiciously. For example, this one obviously works:

```
gantu sage-main $ sage -t sage/combinat/root_system/root_system.py
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/root_system/root_system.py"
	 [12.7 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 12.7 seconds

gantu sage-main $ sage -hg qpush
applying 12272_long_time.patch
now at: 12272_long_time.patch

gantu sage-main $ sage -t sage/combinat/root_system/root_system.py
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/root_system/root_system.py"
	 [2.0 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 2.0 seconds
```

Down by around ten seconds. But this one?

```
gantu sage-main $ sage -t sage/categories/pushout.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/categories/pushout.py"       
	 [4.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.3 seconds

	 [4.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.3 seconds
```


And what are these?

```
# sometimes very slow (up to 60s on sage.math, 2012)
```

```
# takes a while but caches stuff (21s on sage.math, 2012)

`# long time` serves purposes beyond that:
1. non-long tests are actually used, for example the patchbot does non-long tests only.
2. "long time" serves as documentation to the user that some command is supposed to take a long time.
3. keeping track of the runtime of these tests makes it possible to detect regressions.  For example, for the `integral_points()` tests, it was marked as taking 35s but I found it actually took 50s.  I agree "long time" isn't the best solution for this, but it's the best we currently have.

Thanks for checking.

> * sage/combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py
 
Removed `# long time` here.

> * sage/crypto/mq/sr.py
> * sage/geometry/triangulation/point_configuration.py
> * sage/groups/matrix_gps/matrix_group.py
> * sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py

These already had `# long time`, I just changed or added the time.  So the "before" and "after" are meaningless because they are both not running the changed tests.

Anybody feels like giving this a final review?

I also removed one extra `# long time` from `sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` as #12888 considerably speeds it up.
