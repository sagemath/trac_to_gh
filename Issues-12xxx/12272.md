Some of these are behaving suspiciously. For example, this one obviously works:

```
gantu sage-main $ sage -t sage/combinat/root_system/root_system.py
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/root_system/root_system.py"
	 [12.7 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 12.7 seconds

gantu sage-main $ sage -hg qpush

now at: 12272_long_time.patch

gantu sage-main $ sage -t sage/combinat/root_system/root_system.py
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/root_system/root_system.py"
	 [2.0 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 2.0 seconds
```

Down by around ten seconds. But this one?

```
gantu sage-main $ sage -t sage/categories/pushout.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/categories/pushout.py"       
	 [4.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.3 seconds

gantu sage-main $ sage -hg qpush

now at: 12272_long_time.patch

gantu sage-main $ sage -t sage/categories/pushout.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/categories/pushout.py"       
	 [4.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.3 seconds
```


And what are these?

```
# sometimes very slow (up to 60s on sage.math, 2012)
```

```
# takes a while but caches stuff (21s on sage.math, 2012) 
```

"`sage.math, 2012` is pretty well-defined.  Agreed that it doesn't mean anything to the casual Sage user, but developers can get an account on sage.math so they can check timings.  And "Intel corei7" is way too little information.  You would need information on the precise processor type, the operation system version, maybe versions of glibc/gcc,...

Here are the before (left) and after (right) timings on my desktop. There's obviously some deviation, but it looks like we can skip marking a few as `long time`.

I'll leave it up to your discretion. It's fine now, or if you want to remove any, I'll look it over again and give it a +review.

I got here too late to help, it seems.  I think we might want a discussion on sage-devel about the role of long tests.  Whenever I test a beta build I run all the long tests anyway (what's the point otherwise?), and casual users will not run any tests.

`# long time` serves purposes beyond that:
1. non-long tests are actually used, for example the patchbot does non-long tests only.
2. "long time" serves as documentation to the user that some command is supposed to take a long time.
3. keeping track of the runtime of these tests makes it possible to detect regressions.  For example, for the `integral_points()` tests, it was marked as taking 35s but I found it actually took 50s.  I agree "long time" isn't the best solution for this, but it's the best we currently have.

Thanks for checking.

> * sage/combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py

Removed `# long time` here.

> * sage/crypto/mq/sr.py
> * sage/geometry/triangulation/point_configuration.py
> * sage/groups/matrix_gps/matrix_group.py
> * sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py

These already had `# long time`, I just changed or added the time.  So the "before" and "after" are meaningless because they are both not running the changed tests.

Anybody feels like giving this a final review?

Attachment: **[12272_long_time.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12272/12272_long_time.patch.gz)**

I also removed one extra `# long time` from `sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` as #12888 considerably speeds it up.
