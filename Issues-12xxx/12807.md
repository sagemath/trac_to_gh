```
In sage 4.8 the following computation gives 1/2, while the right result is -3/2:

```
sage: a = exp(i*2*pi/3)
sage: b = exp(i*pi/3)
sage: c = 2*a-b
sage: c.real()
1/2
```

Doing the computation numerically gives the right result:

```
sage: N(c).real()
-1.50000000000000
```
and asking maxima directly also works:

```
sage: (c.maxima_methods().rectform()).real()
-3/2
```

This is sage 4.8 running on Fedora 16, linux 3.1.0-7.fc16.x86_64 SMP.

Depends on #18362

This gets really weird, actually.

```
sage: a.real()
-1/2
sage: b.real()
1/2
sage: (a-b).real() # good
-1
sage: (a-2*b).real() # good
-3/2
sage: (a-3*b).real()  # ho-hum
-2
sage: (2*a-b).real() # yikes
1/2
sage: (3*a-b).real()  # what?
3/4
sage: (4*a-b).real()  # consistent...
1
sage: (5*a-b).real()  # ?!?!?
5/4
sage: (-a-b).real()  # seeing but not believing
-1/4
sage: (-2*a-b).real()
-1/2
sage: (-3*a-b).real()
-3/4
sage: (2*a).real()  # okay
-1
sage: (2*a+b).real()  #  okay
-1/2
sage: (3*a+b).real()
-1
sage: (4*a+b).real()
-3/2
```
This is consistent with Pynac somehow thinking that `a.real()==1/4` when preceded by a positive constant and `-1/4` when given a negative constant.  But only when part of a sum including `-b`, with `+b` it's fine.

I tried to figure out what it was but so far no luck.

Actually and surprisingly what's happening is that the simplified values of the `exp` expressions (`1/2` and `-1/2`) and their coefficients are all multiplied together on final evaluation:

```
sage: (4*exp(i*pi/3)-4*exp(i*2*pi/3)).real_part()
4
sage: (6*exp(i*pi/3)-6*exp(i*2*pi/3)).real_part()
9
```
This is evident in the GiNaC source, this line(https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/master/ginac/add.cpp#L432):

```
    oc = oc.mul(ex_to<numeric>(j->rest)).mul(ex_to<numeric>(j->coeff));
```
is so rarely executed that e.g. only three doctests in `symbolic/` touch it but don't trigger the bug because the expressions are too short.

The fix will be in Pynac-0.3.7.
