Seems like your inputs and outputs are smashed together.

So this ticket is specifically about latexing a matrix?  Could you add that in the title to narrow down the scope?

It's not just about the TeX.  The first row should read `[1 0.9000etc 1/5 x^2]`, but the first and third elements aren't being treated the same way as they are in the other rows.

I figured we used the `Sequence.universe` for this.  Here's the problem in `Sequence`.

```
            for i in range(len(x)-1):
                try:
                    x[i], x[i+1] = coerce.canonical_coercion(x[i],x[i+1])
```
This is fine for stepwise finding a universe, but what it does is try to coerce things one by one, instead of looking at all of them as a whole (which is probably slower, of course).

I say that there must be an easy way to fix the matrix code so that we don't call `Sequence` immediately, but first use it to find a `universe`, then make the new `Sequence` as in your code.  That would fix this ticket.

Then we could have a different ticket or sage-devel discussion on whether this `Sequence` behavior is, in fact, a bug.

Got it. In sage.matrix.constructor.py:

```
           entries = []
           for v in args[0]:
               entries.extend(v)
```
is how the list is created.  Then `prepare` is used to make this into a list and base ring, and that is where `Sequence` is used.

But the problem is that this means it takes the whole flattened list of entries in the matrix and does the step-by-step sequence construction.

We could just have it find the universe for the sequence and then make the sequence again.  That could be a big slowdown, though.  On the other hand, if someone is not specifying the ring ahead of time (this all happens only if `elif len(args) == 1:` then they probably aren't as interested in speed, are they?  

Thoughts?
