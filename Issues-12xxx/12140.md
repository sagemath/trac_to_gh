This patch switches computations in symmetric functions from symmetric to lrcalc which is now standard package in Sage.

The following code causes a segmentation fault:

```
sage: s = SFASchur(QQ)
sage: s([[], []])
```
or

```
sage: s([]).skew_by(s([]))
```
which should be s[] but instead causes a segmentation fault.

The calculation of an expansion of a skew Schur function in the Schur 
basis done with the symmetrica package.  

The bug comes from the calculation of a skew Schur function indexed 
by two empty partitions.  To fix this bug we change the computation from the
symmetrica package to lrcalc which should be faster and more robust.
lrcalc is a package that was integrated into sage in version 5.2.beta1.

Timing tests for computing expansions of skew Schur functions indicate
that for large partitions there are significant speed improvements
by using lrcalc instead of symmetrica.
example:
Without this patch applied:

```
sage: timeit('s([[9,9,8,8,7,7,6,6,5,5,4,3,2,1],[6,5,4,3,2]])')
5 loops, best of 3: 5.06 s per loop
```
With this patch applied:

```
sage: timeit('s([[9,9,8,8,7,7,6,6,5,5,4,3,2,1],[6,5,4,3,2]])')            
5 loops, best of 3: 978 ms per loop
```
- In classical.py the construction of a skew Schur function now calls 
lrcalc.skew instead of symmetrica.part_part_skewschur

- doc tests were added to check base cases in sfa.py and classical.py

Yikes. Thanks for the report.

Can you confirm that the compilation runs smoothly without the patch?
I.e. that this is not an issue of Symmetrica itself?

Jeroen, since I do not have this linux version at hand, could you please confirm that the compilation runs smoothly without the patch applied?

+The bug comes from the calculation of a skew Schur function indexed

+lrcalc is a package that was integrated into sage in version 5.2.beta1.
