This patch switches computations in symmetric functions from symmetric to lrcalc which is now standard package in Sage.

The following code causes a segmentation fault:

```
sage: s = SFASchur(QQ)
sage: s([[], []])
```
or

```
sage: s([]).skew_by(s([]))
```
which should be s[] but instead causes a segmentation fault.

The calculation of an expansion of a skew Schur function in the Schur 
basis done with the symmetrica package.  

The bug comes from the calculation of a skew Schur function indexed 
by two empty partitions.  To fix this bug we change the computation from the
symmetrica package to lrcalc which should be faster and more robust.
lrcalc is a package that was integrated into sage in version 5.2.beta1.

Timing tests for computing expansions of skew Schur functions indicate
that for large partitions there are significant speed improvements
by using lrcalc instead of symmetrica.
example:
Without this patch applied:

```
sage: timeit('s([[9,9,8,8,7,7,6,6,5,5,4,3,2,1],[6,5,4,3,2]])')
5 loops, best of 3: 5.06 s per loop
```
With this patch applied:

```
sage: timeit('s([[9,9,8,8,7,7,6,6,5,5,4,3,2,1],[6,5,4,3,2]])')            
5 loops, best of 3: 978 ms per loop
```
- In classical.py the construction of a skew Schur function now calls 
lrcalc.skew instead of symmetrica.part_part_skewschur

- doc tests were added to check base cases in sfa.py and classical.py

Jeroen, since I do not have this linux version at hand, could you please confirm that the compilation runs smoothly without the patch applied?

This is a buildbot machine, so yes, Sage builds and works 100% fine without this patch. I'll be honest that I also have no idea what causes this problem.

Ok, I guess we should not waste time and this, and just jump on the occasion to do the right thing, namely to use lrcalc. I just implemented the little changed requested by Jeroen on #11563, so I guess that's ok to add it as a dependency.

What do you think?

-which should be s[] but instead causes the segmentation fault.
+The calculation of an expansion of a skew Schur function in the Schur 
+basis done with the symmetrica package.  
 
+The bug comes from the calculation of a skew Schur function indexed 
+by two empty partitions.  To fix this bug we change the computation from the
+symmetrica package to lrcalc which should be faster and more robust.
+lrcalc is a package that was integrated into sage in version 5.2.beta1.
+
+Timing tests for computing expansions of skew Schur functions indicate
+that for large partitions there are significant speed improvements
+by using lrcalc instead of symmetrica.
+example:
+Without this patch applied:
+
+```
+sage: timeit('s([[9,9,8,8,7,7,6,6,5,5,4,3,2,1],[6,5,4,3,2]])')

+5 loops, best of 3: 978 ms per loop
+```
+- In classical.py the construction of a skew Schur function now calls 
+lrcalc.skew instead of symmetrica.part_part_skewschur

+- doc tests were added to check base cases in sfa.py and classical.py
