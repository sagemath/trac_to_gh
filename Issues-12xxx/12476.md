Helloooooooooooo !!!

I added two modifications (which did not appear to make much of a difference) but also make the code slightly easier to read. There already was a reference, I added another, no one is hurt `:-)`

If you are ok with this second set of modifications you can set the ticket to "positive_review".

I folded the reviewer's patch in the original patch.
All test pass and the new code is semantically equivalent, but way faster.
Positive review! Thanks!
