find_fit calls len(variables) which is not defined for piecewise functions. There is a variable "length" that is equivalent. If the function passed to find_fit is piecewise it should call "length" instead of "len(variables)".

It would be great if you could post an example of what *should* work, by the way, just for reference.  Thanks!
