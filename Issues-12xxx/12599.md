After a second thougnt, I think you should add git=true to your [diff] section in .hgrc and regenerate the patch so that the mode change is reflected in the hg log.

FYI, such a setting is set by default in hg within sage by #11121

If you don't fell inclined to do so, I'll understand because you might also consider that your sentence in SPKG.txt is talkative enough.

As far as I can tell, mode changes are never reflected in hg log, regardless of the `git=true` setting.

Sorry, I was not clear.

It's obviously not reflected in what hg log outputs but in what hg diff -rx:y would with git=true.

It's also true that this is generated on the fly, so my comment was kind of meaningless, I was just surprised the diff you posted here did not include that change (and anyway you must have generated it with the git=true option but only on SPKG.txt and not all the repo).

So I'm putting that back to positive review.
