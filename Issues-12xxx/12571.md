```
The shifted shuffle of two permutations can be expressed as a right permutohedron interval. We implements a method that computes in this way the shifted shuffle of two permutations.

Note that this improve the efficiency of the former way to compute shifted shuffle of permutations:

```
sage: p1 = Permutations(10).random_element()
sage: p2 = Permutations(7).random_element()
```

```
sage: _ = [Permutation(p) for p in Word(p1).shifted_shuffle(Word(p2))]
```

takes about 19.95 s CPU time on my computer, but

```
sage: _ = p1.shifted_shuffle(p2)
```

takes about 3.94 s CPU time.


We also implements Loday-Ronco's over and under operations on permutations.

Hi Samuele,

Good to have you onboard ! 

- First of all, if you want a review you should check the `needs-review` button below. 

- when you put some example under the title `EXAMPLES::`
there is no need to but them in `TESTS::`. Both are tested alike.

- You should add a rubric `INPUT::` explaining what `other` can
be. Here I think it could be a `Permutations`, a `list`, a `tuple`
or any `iterable`. A few examples demonstrating this should also be added
(see
[documentation strings](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings) for the precise syntax).

- Are you sure that you didn't mixed up the convention for over/under ? To
break the ambiguity, I'd rather call them `shifted_concatenation` and
`shifted_anti_concatenation`. Or maybe only one function
`shifted_concatenation`, with an optional parameter `shift` which can
be either `"left"` or `"right"`. Or even
`shift_right (True by default)`...
What do you think ? Maybe it is worth asking for a vote on
`Sage-combinat-devel`.

- You should add a ".. SEEALSO::" rubric linking the three functions one to
the other (see also #12078 ;-)

- Finally, You could add some consistency tests checking that for some
relatively large permutations, the cardinality of the interval in the correct
binomial coefficient.

Sorry for this long list of requests, once you gets used to Sage, you'll do all
of this without thinking of it.

And many thanks for taking care of this.

Florent

Quite a few functions take an argument side="left"/"right", more often
than not the default being "right". If

```
    x.shifted_concatenation(y, side="right")
```

sounds unambiguous enough about the shift being on y (and not the
concatenation being on the right), I vote for this. Otherwise
shift="left"/"right"

Cheers,
                      Nicolas
