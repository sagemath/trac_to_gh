There currently lacks an implementation of the (cartesian) product of posets.

```
sage: P2=Posets.ChainPoset(2)

sage: P4=Posets.ChainPoset(4)

sage: Q=P2.product(P4)

```
This should return a poset with 8 elements, with Hasse diagram a 2 x 4 grid.

It would be nice to have a fast enough procedure for this.
