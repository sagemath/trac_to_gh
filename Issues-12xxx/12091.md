This ticket was originally started to address problems now dealt with in #13646. 
Still, the following (chained inequalities don't work) needs to be fixed:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[0] <= b[1] <= 2  # This is not ok
x_1 <= 2
sage: (b[0] <= b[1] <= 2).constraints # Not ok
[x_1, 2]
sage: 1 >= b[1] >= 2*b[0] # Not ok (note that without #13646 this returns False)
2 x_0 <= x_1
sage: b[2] >= b[1] >= 2*b[0]  # Not ok
2 x_0 <= x_1
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>I spent days already on this problem, so I should at least update the ticket. This does not work because of.... that :

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[2] + b[4] >= 5
5 <= x_0 +x_1
sage: 5 <= b[2] + b[4]
True
```

It is as easy as that. And of course, calling ``p.add_constraint(True)`` can not do anything useful. That comes from the fact that the way it is implemented the comparison methods I wrote for the LP variables are totally ignored when there is an integer on the left of the equation.

I went through hell (aka the coercion system) to make it work, and after getting back from hell (writing new classes, using categories, parents objets, elements objects, ...) Sage finally understood that it has to coerce integers to "LinearFunction" objects before applying the ``<=`` operation.

I was happy at this point. And then I noticed that when I typed ``3*b[i]`` in Sage, it first converted the "3" to a ``LinearFunction`` object and then tried to multiply linear functions between themselves. And multiply linear functions is *never* a good idea.

So unless there is a magical way to make it work (without destroying all the code... I mean, even reaching that former point amounted to something like 100 additional lines of code totally exclusively dealing with categories and coercion), I'd stand for big "DO NOT PUT AN INTEGER BY ITSELF ON THE LEFT SIDE OF A LP INEQUALITY" in the doc.

But I'd prefer to find a magical way, of course..

How come? The LP inequalities have LP variables. So one of the tokens will be such a variable...

My understanding is this:

When you start with `5 <= b[0]` your program will see the *number* 5 not an object from the class `LinearConstraint` or `LinearFunction`. So, `LinearConstraint.__le__` won't be called. This is ok when you have the opposite `b[0] >= 5`.

well, anyway. Actually, I don't see why Sage library files can't be .sage file, is it some kind of religion?  (OK, you'd need to preparse them once, I guess).

It's obviously makes things unnecessarily verbose to rely upon Python's idea of what a well-formed mathematical expression might be.

+1

That's precisely why I had to create a "Sum" function for LP variables. Because I refused to add n variables in n^2 times, and that it is the only way to do it with __add__ methods. And this "Sum" method fixes the problem but is a bad solution.

<a id='comment:22'></a>The problem with the `a <= b <= c` is actually a problem with python. According to [this](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0207/), chained inequalities behave as follows:

```

According to one of my colleagues this behavior is different in python-3 (and that python-3 has the behavior we want), but I haven't checked (I will need to install python-3).

indeed! What about more convoluted cases:

```
sage: b[0] <= 555/11*b[1] >= 2
2 <= x_0 <= 555/11*x_1
sage: b[0] <= 555/11*b[1] == 2
555/11*x_1 == 2
```
the 1st one ought to become 2 inequalities, and the 2nd an inequality and an equation.
In both cases, the behaviour is rather strange...

Well, I don't know how easy is to make these work, or at least throw an error.

Anything wrong with having that much more in the inequalities class? 

Potentially one would also want to have `<` and `>` and a proper integration with Sage's polyhedra.

Your patch also inspires a grand plan for [linear matrix inequalities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_matrix_inequality) in Sage...

<a id='comment:34'></a>Attachment [trac_12091_constraints_parents.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket12091/trac_12091_constraints_parents.patch) by @vbraun created at 2012-11-06 17:41:43

I've removed the "cdef double c" in `show()`, so the following works:

```
            sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver= 'ppl')
            sage: x = p.new_variable()
            sage: p.set_objective(x[1] + 1/2*x[2])
            sage: p.add_constraint(-3/5*x[1] + 2/7*x[2], max=2/5)
            sage: p.show()
            Maximization:
              x_0 + 1/2 x_1
            Constraints:
              constraint_0: -3/5 x_0 + 2/7 x_1 <= 2/5
            Variables:
              x_0 is a continuous variable (min=0, max=+oo)
              x_1 is a continuous variable (min=0, max=+oo)
```
