There is absolutely no reason for `$SAGE_ROOT/ipythonrc` to be in the root repo.  It would better be moved to `$SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/dotsage/ipython`.  The idea then being that the whole contents of `extcode/dotsage` would be copied to `$DOT_SAGE`.

Apply all 4 patches below to the respective repositories.

Did you mean instead

```
local/lib/python/site-packages/IPython
```

The `ipython` files currently in `SAGE_ROOT` actually differ quite a bit from the files in that directory, so I'm not sure we can simply copy the files from `ipython`.

Also, there is a file `$SAGE_ROOT/ipython/ipythonrc-scipy` which isn't anywhere else (not even in the scipy spkg).
