The Odd graph, `O_3`, is the Petersen Graph, which has girth 5.

```
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: P.girth()
5
sage: K = graphs.OddGraph(3)
sage: K.is_isomorphic(P)
True
sage: K.girth()
+Infinity
```

But the result implies there are no cycles in K.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Turns out it was rather straightforward to collect vertices already examined in the main loop as the keys of a dictionary (`seen`).  Then problematic comparison that assumed integer value vertices is just replace by a check on the presence of the vertex as a key in the dictionary.

Some rudimentary timings on 4.8.alpha3

Heawood Graph (n=14):
  Stock - 823 us; Patched - 839 us

Odd Graph, `O_7`, relabeled (n=1716):
  Stock - 612 ms; Patched - 633 ms

So no real harm has been done for graphs with integer vertices.

However, with the patch, and without relabeling, `O_7` takes 2.44 s.  Pretty bad you might say.  However, consider that it takes 9.5 s to relabel the graph! (Which is the current work-around.)  So not so bad really.  ;-)

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hellooooo !!

Well, this patch does the trick for this implementation and fixed the bug, hence it's good to go !

On the other hand, this kind of things will really need to be rewritten decently in Cython... To give an idea, the work done by this Python function is more or less (actually, less) than the work done by the "diameter" function, which has been rewritten not so long ago. 

```
sage: g = graphs.OddGraph(7)
sage: %timeit g.diameter()
5 loops, best of 3: 155 ms per loop
```

Well, thank you very much for this bugfix though `:-)`

well, I discussed at the Sage Days in Seattle in Jan 2011 one possible speedup, namely, for graphs with known automorphisms these kinds of computations can be done orbit-wise. But nothing has been done in this direction...

Hmmm... `:-/`

Well, I thought about this too while thinking about this specific problem : to obtain the girth of a vertex-transitive graph one BFS is actually sufficient instead of n, but well... Computing the automorphism group to improve girth computations seems a bit expensive though.

no, the point is that a group is already known (e.g. as it is for the Odd graphs). Then to represent a graph one just needs to store the representatives of
the orbits on the edges of the graph. This allows one to compute with graphs one cannot even store in memory, if all the edges are stored! It's matter of designing a reasonable backend that tackles this.

A short answer is that I look for substructures satisfying certain properties. E.g., maximum cliques, or some convex substructures...

I'd like the students to be able to determine girth (by-hand) for things like the Odd Graph.  Thus, having Sage to help with this is very useful.


one can rely on GAP's package GRAPE for this (ideally, it should even be possible to write a backend based on it).
I showed a bit of this on #9136, constructing the Schlaefli graph.

So having them "read-only" would meet many of my purposes.  And Dima's idea to carry more group-theoretic information is a good one, though it seems a big job to figure out how to do that "right" and then exploit it consistently.


One idea might be a GRAPE-based graph backend.
