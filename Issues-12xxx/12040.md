TypeError: Argument 'other' has incorrect type (expected sage.rings.polynomial.polydict.ETuple, got tuple)

The problem arises from the type of the return argument for f.degrees():

sage: type(f.degrees())
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polydict.ETuple'>

In contrast for a polynomial over QQ:

sage: Pxy.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2)
sage: f = y^2 - x*(x-1)*(x-2)
sage: type(f.degrees())
<type 'tuple'>
```
The elliptic curve example above is a red herring, except to show that this unexpected and inconsistent return type is likely to create major issues elsewhere.  I can imagine a resolution to this particular issue by defining a coercion from tuples so that the comparison does not fail, but someone knowledgeable about the design of polynomial rings and/or coercions needs to look at this.  Note that a coercion does exist and parent(x.degrees())((1,0)) == x.degrees() returns True.
