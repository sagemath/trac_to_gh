This patch fixes the parent and element classes for Hom categories to
be purely abstract, and simplifies the Hom logic:

- Unified the logic for selecting the class when building a Homset
  (e.g. Homset, RingHomset, HeckeModuleHomspace, ...). This is now
  systematically done through the _Hom_ hook. The logic still has a
  fundamental flaw, but that's for the later #10668.
- The cache for Hom is handled at a single point in Hom
  In particular, homsets created via the _Hom_ hook are now unique.
- If category is None, Hom simply calls itself with the meet of the
  categories of the parent, which removes a cache handling duplication
  in the code
- Parent.Hom calls  Hom directly (removes duplicate _Hom_ logic).
- ParentWithBase.Hom was redundant and is gone.
- Reduce the footprint of the current trick to delegate
  Hom(F,F)(on_basis=...) to module_morphism, allow for the diagonal
  option too, an make sure the homset category is set properly.
- Update a doctest in sage.modules.vector_space_homspace to take into
  account that homsets created via _Hom_ are now unique.
- Scheme is (apparently) an abstract base class; so it should not be
  instantiated. I changed some doctests in
  sage.schemes.generic.SchemeMorphism to use instead the concrete
  Spec(ZZ). Those doctests were breaking because Scheme does not
  implement equality, which is required for Hom caching.

As a byproduct, the HeckeModules category does not import any more
HeckeModulesHomspace, which was a recurrent source of import loops.

With #12808, #12875 and #12877 applied on top of sage-5.1.notebook, all doctests pass. But when adding the patch from here, there are two problems:

```
	sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx"
	sage -t  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx"
```
Namely:

```
sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx" 
**********************************************************************
File "/mnt/local/king/SAGE/experiment/notebook/sage-5.1.notebook/devel/sage/sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx", line 469:

**********************************************************************
```
and

```
sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx"
**********************************************************************
File "/mnt/local/king/SAGE/experiment/notebook/sage-5.1.notebook/devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx", line 418:

So, apparently it is only a single problem.

Yeah, I know (see comment 3 above). I feel quite stuck with those
failures, and would really appreciate if you could investigate them
since you know much better than me the caching for Singular rings.

Since there is a positive review for #11521 and #715 (which belong together and have otherwise no pending dependency), could you consider to rebase your patch relative to #11521?

Why do you import Sets (new line 221)?

Do I understand correctly: If Hom receives None as category, then you determine the category as the meet of the categories of domain and codomain, and call Hom again. Did you test that the calling overhead does not matter?

I made some additional cosmetic changes in a reviewer patch.

Further questions:

In sage/category/hecke_modules.py, you refer to ticket number ??? for fixing _test_zero and _test_elements. In sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py, you leave a reference to trac open as well. Have the tickets now been created? I didn't fix that yet.

I see that you rename `Rings.HomCategory.ParentMethods.__new__` into `__new__bx`. Does that mean the ugly `__new__` method ought to be removed (finally!)?
But then, shouldn't `__getnewargs__` be removed as well?

Please tell whether you want to address these questions in an additional patch. And  I hope you agree with adding #715, #11521 and #12215 to the dependencies? Only #12215 needs review (hint...).

If you do agree, then put this to *positive review*, please.

I tried whether one can remove the `__new__` and `__getnewargs__` methods. However, when doing so, one gets a reproducible timeout in the tests for sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py - that's the only error.

So, better keep it as it is.

Recall: I would give it a positive review, if you agree with the additional dependencies.

Unless removing __getnewargs__ turns out to be hard, I'd rather fix all of the above right now.
Feel free to experiment: I won't download the patches before Monday.

I have uploaded a reviewer's patch which fixes the trac ticket numbers, and removes completely Rings.HomCategory. I could not reproduce the timeout:

```

Can you check again?

If you are happy with the change, please fold everything, and set a positive review.

Did you include your trac_12876-reviewer.patch (which fixes those backticks) in between trac_12876_category-fix_abstract_class-nt-rel11521.patch and trac_12876_category-fix_abstract_class-nt-rel11521-review-nt.patch?

This looks like the errors I was getting when I had removed completely
Rings.HomCategory. Can you double check that you have the latest
version of the reviewer patch from trac and that categories/rings.py
indeed has an (empty) class Rings.Homcategory?

With sage-5.3.b2 plus #715, #11521, #12215, #12313, #13370, #13378 and the patches from here, I get

```
make ptest
...
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_ring.py # 0 doctests failed
        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/categories/hecke_modules.py # 1 doctests failed
```

The error in hecke_modules.py is due to

```
NotImplementedError: please implement _an_element_ for Set of Morphisms from Modular Forms space of dimension 3 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(7) of weight 4 over Rational Field to Modular Forms space of dimension 3 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(7) of weight 4 over Rational Field in Category of Hecke modules over Rational Field
```

The error in expect/r.py looks strange to me:

```
sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py
**********************************************************************
File "/mnt/local/king/SAGE/prereleases/sage-5.3.beta2/devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/r.py", line 1169:
    sage: os.path.realpath(tmpdir) == sageobj(r.getwd())
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   7 in __main__.example_43
```
The error is not reproducible, at least not if I run the test individually.

In infinite_polynomial_ring.py one gets a segfault. One does *not* get a segfault when running the tests with `--verbose`. But gdb yields the following backtrace:

Could very well be that this is (once again) due to the new weak caches. But I will also rerun without #13370 and #13378.

Got it!

Infinite polynomial rings were using `WeakKeyDict` in `_has_coerce_map_from_`for caching whether there is a coercion. That has probably been a bad idea, because the methods that are really used (`has_coerce_map`) have a cache anyway.

Removing the additional cache fixes the segfault.

Feel free to just skip the failing tests and mention them, say on #12879.

And thanks a lot for all the work you put in rebasing/finalizing this patch! I'll try to look at it tomorrow.

From Nicolas' comment on #12879, I understood that he accepts to make the `TestSuite` temporarily silent and leave a proper fix to the number theorists. I guess that's a healthy attitude...

I hope that Nicolas also likes the fix for infinite polynomial rings.

Some questions, Nicolas:

The first patch contains

```
sage: category = FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis(QQ) 
sage: X = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3], category = category);   X.rename("X") 
sage: Y = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3,4], category = category); Y.rename("Y") 
sage: H = Hom(X, Y) 
sage: H.zero().category_for() 
Category of finite dimensional modules with basis over Rational Field
```
Why are X and Y renamed? There is yet another location where things are renamed, namely

```
Diagonal functions can be constructed using the ``diagonal`` option:: 

    sage: X = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3,4]); X.rename("X") 
    sage: Y = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3,4], key="Y"); Y.rename("Y") 
    sage: H = Hom(X, Y)
```
Here, I also wonder about the "key" argument.

In sage.rings.ring.pyx, you state:

```
    """
    This temporary alias is here for those instances of :class:`Ring`
    that are not yet properly in the :class:`Rings`() category.

    TESTS::

        sage: A = Ring(ZZ)
        sage: A._Hom_.__module__
        'sage.categories.rings'
        sage: Hom(A,A).__class__
        <class 'sage.rings.homset.RingHomset_generic_with_category'>
    """
    _Hom_ = Rings.ParentMethods.__dict__['_Hom_']
```
Are there any rings that do not initialise the category, after #9138? Hence, what would happen without that alias? Perhaps I'll test it, after finishing the tests for the original patches.

Here is the problem with removing the nasty alias:

```
sage: A.<a,b> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: A._is_category_initialized()
False
sage: isinstance(A,Ring)
True
```

Hence, apparently `Ring.__init__` is not called on `PowerSeriesRing`. That's nasty, but I think in order to make any progress it would be better to leave that to a different ticket.

Hi Simon,

Sorry, I am slow answering; I was immersed all afternoon in tracking
down a nasty bug where UniqueRepresentation was violated. It turned
out that the UniqueRepresentation dict had to equal entries in its
keys (gasp), and that was due to a tricky mro order for a non trivial
inheritance involving Category_singleton and FastHash which got the
hash to change over time ... Anyway ...

I do this fairly systematically in the tests in modules_with_basis. It
makes it immediate to check that the domain and codomain are set
properly when looking at the repr of a morphism or homset. They key is
to force the domain and codomain to be distinct (otherwise, and this
happened to me, if the code accidently interchanges the two it will
get unnoticed).

Well, and for good or bad, once you rename a given parent in a
doctest, you have to rename consistently this parent in all other
doctests in the same file. Or to call X.rename() at the end of the
doctest.

Thanks for fixing the space. Apparently, there is some sort of
consensus for using .. TODO:: rather than .. todo:: (same thing
for seealso, ...).

I have checked the change on infinite polynomial rings, and am ok with
it.

Do you mind folding all patches together? Now that we have checked the
little steps, that will leave a better overview for the future. And
that will take care of the commit messages :-)

(or I can do it, but I need to get the latest beta version first).

And then, it's ready for positive review! Yippee!

I don't think you need any beta version if you want to add a commit message. I think editing the patch and replacing the line `[mq]: trac_12876_category-fix_abstract_class-nt-rel11521-review-nt.patch` by, say `#12876: Use generic code for sage.categories.rings.Rings.HomCategory` would be enough.

Why folding? Perhaps that's a question to the release manager. But are four patches substantially more difficult to merge than one patch?

It's not so much about the release manager than for whoever will come
back to this ticket in the future, and will want to have a synthetic
view of what the patch(es) does.

Separate patches are temporarily good for incremental review. They can
be interesting too in the long run when they do independent
changes. But when they pile on top of each other (typically for
trivial typo fixes) it goes in the way of the reader. Typically (s)he
will read the main patch, see a typo, wonder if it has been fixed,
will have to dig through the followup patches, think about the order
in which they are to be applied, etc.

Excellent, thanks!

Is there any of the old patches that you would like to keep for posterity, or should I just wipe them up?

Concerning the other error, perhaps one can add the following patch:

Is there a way to find out what singular_function or what cached method are involved?

That's rather strange, but I guess that's the problem of the GAP spkg.

In any case, I don't see a segfault. Not on my laptop, not on the machine in my office, not on bsd.math.

The work issue was "understand the crash of r". I think it *is* now understood, because it could be solved by using `os.realpath` in some test, where apparently a relative path was stored.

All segfaults that I have seen are gone because of #13447. But it would be nice if Volker's patchbot could try it again, because it seems to have a tendency to break in a different way than my machines.

I have read the patch carefully in the past, and all tests pass, with the patches stated in[comment:97](#comment%3A97).

Hence: Positive review, I'd say.

I just uploaded a rebased patch. This patch sounds almost good to go.

Still, there are a couple failing tests which all boil to the following little design issue:

Take as typical situation A to be Rings().parent_class, and B to be some NumberField parent class. Assume that P is an instance of A resp. B and that:

- A implements _Hom_ so that P._Hom_(codomain) is a RingHomset if codomain is a ring
- B implements _Hom_ so that P._Hom_(codomain) is a NumberFieldHomset if codomain is a NumberField

Let P be an instance of B and codomain a ring. With the current logic Hom(P, codomain) will
try the later, which will fail, but won't proceed to try the former. So the result will be a plain Homset, and not a RingHomset as desired.

For some reasons this situation did not appear a year ago. Presumably some tests were added in the mean time. Or we did not run the tests with --long ...

What's the best way out?

- Option 1: Walk the mro of the class of P, and call cls._Hom_(P, codomain) in turn until something does not fail

- Option 2: change the protocol so that the _Hom_ method should call super instead of failing if they cannot handle the situation

- Option 3: ???

Cheers,
                                          Nicolas

Two failures were actually trivial:

- A trivial doctest in
  devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/coercion_and_categories.rst
- More skips were needed in the new TestSuite(H) in line 114 of sage.categories.hecke_modules
  (some new test methods that require the currently missing an_element were added since last year)

I implemented a simplistic protocol for the above issue. If P._Hom_ fails, then try category.parent_class._Hom_. This is sufficient for the other failing test in Parent.

Other than this, the attached patch is a straightforward rebase of the previous one. So to finalize the review it would suffice to:

- glance at the above change
- recheck sage.categories.homset.Hom

I am currently running the long tests, but I expect everything to pass.

Almost done!

I don't think that the reference to #9970 should be removed.  It's okay to put in a different test for now if that helps things, but it doesn't remove the underlying problem in our parsing that wjp has a tentative patch for there, so we shouldn't just completely not mention it.  See [this comment](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9970#comment:20) by Simon for background.

From the commit message:
- If category is None, Hom simply calls itself with the meet of the
  categories of the parent, which removes a cache handling duplication.

I don't know if that's a good idea. Duplicating the cache costs virtually nothing (because all objects, categories and homsets involved are there anyway), but it speeds up the most commonly used case, namely category=None. Computing the meet of the underlying categories is expensive, even though it is cached.

Well, most categories actually don't define a HomCategory. I did not
strip the now trivial HomCategory in Schemes just as to avoid having
to fix some trivial doctest failures elsewhere (without it, a
Hom(scheme,scheme) was downgraded to the category of homsets of sets).

> This could be for a different ticket, though. I just wonder.


Yup. At this point we have very little use cases of HomCategories, and
I don't have a good view on how often this gadget will be used, and
thus what the sane default should be. So I would indeed leave things
untouched for now until we have more experience.
