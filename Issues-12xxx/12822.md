Portuguese translation of "Tutorial".

The current version of the translation includes "the first revision" and a minor modification (incorporating a suggestion above). "The first revision" originated from a discussion at sage-devel:

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
In `doc/pt/tutorial/programming.rst`

Removed untranslated "preparsing", should have used "pré-processamento".

I know I commented about "macro" not having a proper translation in pt_BR, but it is already so commonly used, that it should be better to use it instead of "função" (english function).

Remaining looks good, but I still make considerations about conversion and coercion, that by themselves are also confusing in english, and pt_BR makes things worse by having several translations for coercion, most of which are about forced to do something, slavering, etc :-)

It is also funny that "coercion" accordingly to sage documentation stand for "implicit conversion", but common lisp has the function "coerce" that is used for "explicit conversion".

I have rebase the #12502.

IMHO, it best to translate the comments of the codes, e.g., in the place of

```
    sage: 2**3    #  ** means exponent
```
should be use

```
    sage: 2**3    #  ** indica potenciação
```

<a id='comment:20'>Comment 20:</a>
Here is a git branch. I have made sure that all tests pass.

There remains some work in the latex.rst file to replace reference to JSMath by references to MathJax.

> Anyone have a sense of what is still needed here?  It's rather impressively complete.

In the file latex.rst, there are references to the obsolete **jsMath**, which was replaced by **MathJax** in more recent versions. This has to be updated in the translation.

You are right, the above report is not clear at all (but thanks to the people that worked on this nevertheless). I think that the other issues that were raised are solved. For instance, the presence of obsolete \ to break lines, and old notation for line continuation in the sage prompt. I did a search on the files and I believe this is solved.

As far as I know, the only remaining issue is the reference to the obsolete jsMath. (I am going to fix this until the end of the week.)

Also, there is a bad link - dive into Python now is at http://www.diveintopython.net/

Martin Albrecht (malb@informatik.uni-bremen.de) is probably old, though also probably still in the regular tutorial.

Finally, numerous doctest failures - mostly trivial related to graphics, but quite a few others related to Pari and other stuff as well.

https://docs.python.org/devguide/ seems to be the best link nowadays for the way one actually develops Python, I couldn't even easily find "Guido, Some Guys, and a Mailing List: How Python is Developed" on the official Python site.

http://sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/coercion_and_categories.html is the new link for tour_coercion.html and of course the Portuguese for that link ( como um arquivo Sage.) would not be quite right.

altermundus link is now http://altermundus.com/pages/tkz/graph/ (in latex.html)

Both links to the Python documentation at programming.html#dicionarios are dead

sagetex.html has `(este link deve levá-lo a uma cópia local do guia de instalação para mais informações de como proceder.` but in any case "este link" is wrong because there is no pt installation guide.  I say remove that whole bit.

Sorry for the laundry list, but I find that you and I have a good workflow on this sort of thing!  It's really very close to being done, thanks for helping shepherd some of these less-popular tickets to completion.

I don't think this matters. The issue is that <code>:envvar:\`EDITOR\`</code> can create a cross-reference to an entry in a construction like `.. envvar:: name`. We only use the <code>:envvar:\`...\`</code> markup to typeset environment variables consistently, not for the cross-referencing. So in fact you will get lots of such errors if you build the installation manual with `--warn-links`, because there are lots of environment variables discussed there.
