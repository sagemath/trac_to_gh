Delsarte bound for codes, aka Linear Programming bound, is easy to implement in Sage.

To work well in big dimensions, one needs an arbitrary precision LP solver. We use an LP backend to PPL, which is available in Sage since #12533.

I think the `Krawtchouk` polynomial could be computed explicitly by not making repeated calls to `binomial`. This should speed it up. I have something like this in mind:

```
def Krawtchouk2(n,q,l,i):
    # Use the expression in equation (55) of MacWilliams & Sloane, pg 151
    # We write jth term = some_factor * (j-1)th term
    kraw = jth_term = (q-1)**l * binomial(n, l) # j=0
    for j in range(1,l+1):
        jth_term *= -q*(l-j+1)*(i-j+1)/((q-1)*j*(n-j+1))
        kraw += jth_term
    return kraw

n,q,l,i = 10,8,7,5
timeit('Krawtchouk2(n,q,l,i)')
timeit('Krawtchouk (n,q,l,i)')
print Krawtchouk2(n,q,l,i) == Krawtchouk(n,q,l,i)

625 loops, best of 3: 53.3 µs per loop
625 loops, best of 3: 205 µs per loop
True
```

I noticed that sage handles nonintegral components in the binomial, so the expression for the `Krawtchouk` already works with nonintegral `n` and `x`.

```
n,q,l,i = 10.6,8,7,5.4
#timeit('Krawtchouk3(n,q,l,i)')
timeit('Krawtchouk2(n,q,l,i)')
timeit('Krawtchouk (n,q,l,i)')
print Krawtchouk2(n,q,l,i) == Krawtchouk(n,q,l,i)
print Krawtchouk2(n,q,l,i), Krawtchouk(n,q,l,i)

625 loops, best of 3: 382 µs per loop
125 loops, best of 3: 4.74 ms per loop
False
93582.0160001147 93582.0159999999

It's probably even faster to compute by using recurrence relations, but I don't think it's important here: LP solving timing clearly dominates the rest. 

By the way, would it be interesting to include an option to compute bounds on codes with a prescribed forbidden

The point is that someone might try to use these polynomials more generally in a separate context. They are not defined anywhere else in Sage, so anyone who tries to use them will use this one.

Wow! You have the Johnson scheme too?! Sure, add them all in!! Do you use the polynomials used by Aaltonen?

LP for permutation codes would be interesting. There are not too many good results known there. IIRC, it uses Charlier polynomials.

EDIT: FWIW, it is Charlier polynomials.

Actually, I have most discrete orthogonal polynomials arising in the classical P- and Q- polynomial schemes 
[implemented](https://bitbucket.org/dimpase/qcode/src/9e3b79dc71992aa2a8ea170dbd13f9f373772411/aw.sage?at=default), although it's neither polished nor optimized.

Please review. I added a Kravchouck speedup, and cleaned up docstrings as requested.

Thanks for the update. I have some general comments. Will look into this patch in more detail too.
1. There are lot of trailing whitespaces. The patchbot will complain. :)
2. What is the point of this portion of the code? Can't it be replaced by `kk = ZZ(log(q, q_base))`?

```python
   kk = 0
   while q_base**kk < q:
      kk += 1
```
3. There is another bit further down:

```python
      m = -1
      while q_base**(m+1) < bd:
        m += 1
      if q_base**(m+1) == bd:
        m += 1
```
4. Also, I don't think this deprecation is necessary any more. The ticket you cited is over 2 years old.

```diff
-def dimension_upper_bound(n,d,q):
+@rename_keyword(deprecation=6094, method="algorithm")
+def dimension_upper_bound(n,d,q,algorithm=None):
```

**Edit:** Sorry. It seems `ZZ` doesn't work but `int(log(..))` does work.

I blindly copied from `sage/coding/code_bounds.py`
Should the whole file be cleaned out of these?
By the way, plural `methods` slipped through this decorator...

yes, it is basically what it does; this is also needed to do a Gomory-style cut which might be available due to the corresponding rounding.

Ok. I am finally getting some time to look into this again. Here are some comments.
1. `Krawtchouk` is missing a doctest.
2. There is no need of `\` in `def delsarte_bound_...`
3. There are still many trailing whitespaces. If you use vim then you can try this command `:%s/[ ]\+$//`
4. <code>   - \`\`q\`\` -- the length of the alphabet</code> -- this should be "the *size* of the alphabet"
    Also I think the the options `q` and `d` can be swapped to be in the order in which they appear
    in the function definition.
5. <code>- \`\`solver\`\` -- the LP/ILP solved </code> --- this should be *solver*.
   What other solvers are present? They should be listed as options in this
   variable.
6. `The bound on the size of the F_2-codes` --- this should be *<code>\`F_2\`</code>*
7.  <code> - \`\`return_data\`\` </code> --- As it is currently written in the description, it is unclear what this is returning. It looks like the first component is an MIP variable (and not a vector), and the second component is the MILP itself. At a first glance in your doctests, it looks like we need to understand how the MILP works in order to get the values of the weight distribution. Should we just return the weight distribution itself?  A weight distribution vector can be returned by doing `p.get_values(a).values()`.
8. The backend should automatically handle "isinteger=True" at least so that it is functional. Currently I get a very generic Exception (why is this only "Exception"?). Maybe it is automatically handled in a later version of sage? I will have to check against 5.6.beta1 and higher:

```
Exception: This backend does not handle integer variables ! Read the doc !
```
9. Why do we need the second function? We already discussed this off-ticket - I will wait for your generic function.
10. `(**this option is currenly disabled, cf. trac #13667**). ` --- it should be *<code>:trac:\`13667\`</code>* since it will be in the documentation.
21. `    Parameter "algorithm" has the same meaning as in codesize_upper_bound() ` --- This should be *<code>:func:\`codesize_upper_bound\`</code>*.
32. `      print "Wrong q_base=", q_base, " for q=", q, kk` --- This can be formatted python3 style as

```
      print "Wrong q_base={} for q={} {}".format(q_base, q, kk)
```
13. According to the patchbot this needs rebasing against some higher version of 5.6. I have only beta0 here; I will check it against rc1 after I have compiled that.
24. EDIT: I forgot.. the deprecation notice should go. It has been two years. If code_bounds needs to be cleaned then I can do that.

EDIT: Update backticks in 6., 10., 11.

The PPL backend does not handle ILP. One might want to improve the way it reports this error, but not on this ticket.

hmm, what function do you mean? there is an internal function which is not exported; I don't think it needs a doctest, does it?

>

where?

I have no idea. Is there a stated policy on this?
