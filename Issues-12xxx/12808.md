When a class `C` is an instance of `ClasscallMetaclass`, then for any constructor call, the system currently looks for `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__` in `C`. This adds quite an overhead and this could be cached, assuming no one modifies `C` (which seems reasonable). Improving this speeds up, in particular, all call to the constructor of a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`, eg. many parents, all categories...

I'm finishing the patch, I've added a large optimization for the other branch
where there is no `__classcall__`

Here are the results in the basis case (no `__classcall__`)::

```
sage: class Rien(object):
...       pass
sage: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass
sage: class NOCALL(object):
...      __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
...      pass

Standard Python class:

sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.7 ms per loop

Currently:

sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 15.9 ms per loop

Cython version:

sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 3.59 ms per loop

Cython optimized version:

sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.76 ms per loop
```
So I'm 5% only slower than normal class.

Here are the results in the basis case (no `__classcall__`)::

```
sage: class CALL(object):
...       __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
...       @staticmethod
...       def __classcall_private__(cls, arg):
...           arg = arg + arg
...           return arg

Currently:

sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 8.7 ms per loop

Cython version:

sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 4.33 ms per loop

Cython optimized version (no mesurable difference from the preceding):

sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 4.34 ms per loop
```
Here I'm twice as fast as before.

I'm cleanup the patch (doctests) an will post it shortly.

Hi Florent!

I know the patch is preliminary, but here are two comments:

In the new file classcall_metaclass_cy.pyx, it is not explained what `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__` do, and when to implement which. Actually, I have never used `__classcall_private__` myself.

In the old python version of classcall_metaclass, you move `__call__` to `__call__disable`. Why do you not completely remove the slow Python call method?

Or ideally, one could try to provide a generalised metaclass framework in Sage. Namely, one could think of having different small metaclasses, each providing a particular feature. For example:

* We have `NestedMetaclass`.
* We already have `__classcall__` (perhaps resulting in a unique parent structure or in a dynamic class).
* At #11794, I suggest a metaclass that provides a fast cached hash.
* Just "brainstorming": Perhaps it would be a useful feature for debugging to print which Python methods are called of a particular instance. I could imagine a metaclass that could be used to *temporarily* switch that feature on.

And if we have different "small" metaclasses then it would be useful to combine them. But that's a problem for Python: If A, B and C have different metaclasses, you can not simply have a class definition like

```
    class D(A,B,C): pass
```

This is (I guess) why `ClasscallMetaclass` inherits from `NestedMetaclass`. But Ticket #11794 provides examples for a different and more skalable solution: *Make metaclasses dynamic!*

So, what I mean by a generalised metaclass framework in Sage is:
* Implement a base class `SageMetaclass`, from which all metaclasses (such as `NestedMetaclass` and `ClasscallMetaclass` and `FastHashMetaclass`) are derived.
* Make it so that if A, B, C are classes with different metaclasses (all derived from `SageMetaclass`) can be used as base classes for a new class. In that way, the features provided by metaclasses could be freely combined.

But I guess that's a topic for a different ticket...

Yes it is. We discussed last week with Nicolas of switching the inheritance
order here. That is using only `NestedMetaclass` for Categories. I still have
to check that this doesn't break pickling of Parent with a nested Element.

Hi Simon,

I just uploaded an updated patch. I still have to lauch the tests (but I've to run for a train now) and to check the documentation. The code together with the timings should hopefully be the final version here.
I'll put the needs review after the tests and doc rereading.

Thanks for your remarks.

 When a class `C` is an instance of `ClasscallMetaclass`, then for any constructor call, the system currently looks for `__classcall__` and `__classcall_private__` in `C`. This adds quite an overhead and this could be cached, assuming no one modifies `C` (which seems reasonable). Improving this speeds up, in particular, all call to the constructor of a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`, eg. many parents, all categories...

Good news: All doctests pass.

I am astonished that the C-level way of calling `type.__call__` is so much faster. That suggests to cythonise sage.structure.dynamic_class as well, so that dynamic classes are created more quickly! Shall this be done on a different ticket?

Hi Simon,

Thanks for your in depth review.

Replying to [SimonKing](#comment%3A20):
> Some further questions (in addition to my question about the rÃ´le of _included_private_doc_):


This is a tentative inclusion of the doc of the special methods (see
[this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/b1cf6b2243bba673?hl=en) on sage devel.

> Why is `__all__ = ['ClasscallType', 'ClasscallMetaclass', 'typecall', 'timeCall']` added? Isn't importing also possible without that? Or is it needed to make `from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import *` work?


I just want to hide the few class I wrote here for timing (CRef, C2, C3,
C2C). With this line, they are neither imported with import *, nor documented.

There is this discussion about cleaning up the way metaclass are defined and
used in Sage. I just wanted to keep features separate. Should we decide to
merge or rewrite the metaclass architecture, I'd rather to keep this for a
different ticket.

You mean `cpdef inline` (we may want to call it from Python) ? I had the
impression from C that this inline doesn't do anything if the function is
defined in a different module. More precisely, in C/C++ inline only work if
the function is defined in `.h` instead of `.c`. Does Cython do
anything for that ?

Not that I know of.

> I just wanted to keep features separate.


Well, I actually think cythoning `NestedClassMetaclass` is *less* intrusive than your patch.

Compare: You have to *add* a new cdef class `ClasscallType` and change the inheritance of `ClasscallMetaclass`. I suggest to change `NestedClassMetaclass` into a cdef class, keep the inheritance of `ClasscallMetaclass`, and avoid the addition of `ClasscallType`.

I think I will test it...

I expected it to be inlined, if it is defined cpdef inline in the pxd file, and then cimported into another cython file. But I don't know if that is really done, actually.

Except that at some point Nicolas suggested to keep NestedClassMetaclass for
Categories... The truth is that I've currently no idea on the good way
metaclass should be organized in Sage. So I tried to avoid any interface
changes. I was even surprised that the Cythonizing work so well without
breaking anything in Sage. Now If you think there is a better/faster
way. Please give it a try.

Hi Simon,

> Also, when `nested_pickle` calls `modify_for_nested_pickle`, it always looks up `sys.modules[...]` - thus, why not store `sys.modules` in a `cdef dict` variable?!


Does this give a large speed-up ? I would guess that the dict search is the
bottleneck, but without serious profiling one cannot be sure.

Sure ! ClasscallType was for me a step before doing more in depth change in
the Metaclass infrastructure. I was quite scared to do those in depth change

Let's test:

```
sage: cython("""
....: import sys
....: cdef D = sys.modules
....: d = sys.modules
....: def test1(name):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i from 0<=i<1000000:
....:         a = D[name]
....: def test2(name):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i from 0<=i<1000000:
....:         a = d[name]
....: def test3(name):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i from 0<=i<1000000:
....:         a = sys.modules[name]
....: """)
sage: name = "sage"
sage: %time test1(name)
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02 s
sage: %time test2(name)
CPU times: user 0.08 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.08 s
Wall time: 0.08 s
sage: %time test3(name)
CPU times: user 0.11 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.11 s
Wall time: 0.12 s
""")
```

Conclusion: Assigning `sys.modules` to a Python variable brings a speed-up of 1/3, and assigning it to a Cython variable brings a speed-up of 5/6. So, the speed-up obtained from Cython is indeed huge.

"Easy" means that one can really just change def into cdef. And in addition to that, I tried to call some frequently used routine directly, in order to avoid a calling overhead, and also I cpdefined that routine.

My preference is to do it on one ticket (the common topic being "cdefine `ClasscallMetaclass`", which of course also involves cdefining `NestedClassMetaclass`).

Concerning clean review: I would provide a patch that is to be applied before your patch (dealing with nested classes) and another one to be applied after your patch (refactoring the bases of classcall metaclass).

Hence, we can easily cross-review, which is considered to be "clean".

Cool ! So my intuition where wrong. This is something I don't feel very
comfortable with Python. When I try to predict which part of the code should
be optimized I'm too often wrong. I remember being much better at that in
MuPAD. I have the impression that Python is not very predictable, but maybe
it's just me. I guess I need to optimize more code.

<a id='comment:40'></a>
We suggested the following approaches towards getting fast metaclasses.

* You suggested: "Let a metaclass be a Python class that gets fast methods from a Cython class"
* I suggested: "Implement the metaclass directly in Cython" (you showed how it works)

Here, I study the question whether we should expect a significant speed difference in the two approaches.

Let the following be put in a pyx file that we attach to a Sage session:

```
cdef class T1:
    def __call__(self, x):
        return x

cdef class T2:
    def __hash__(self):
        return 123

cdef class T3:
    def __add__(self, x):
        return self

cdef class T4:
    def test(self, x):
        return x
```

Hence, we have Cython classes, the first three of them providing typical "magical" methods, the fourth a custom method. In the Sage session, we derive a Python class from the four classes, and, to make it more "realistic", we give a second base.

```
sage: C1 = type("C1",(T1,Parent),{})
sage: C2 = type("C2",(T2,Parent),{})
sage: C3 = type("C3",(T3,Parent),{})
sage: C4 = type("C4",(T4,Parent),{})
```

C1,...,C4 correspond to metaclasses implemented as you suggest, T1,...,T4 as I suggest.

It could be that in future we want to have meta-metaclasses, which would allow to mix the metaclasses. Hence, I am also considering new classes derived from C1,...,C4 resp. from T1,...,T4:

```
sage: Cdirect = type("Cdirect",(T1,T2,T3,T4,Parent),{})
sage: Cindirect = type("Cindirect",(C1,C2,C3,C4),{})       
```
Let us create instances of each class:

```
sage: c1 = C1()
sage: c2 = C2()
sage: c3 = C3()
sage: c4 = C4()
sage: t1 = T1()
sage: t2 = T2() 
sage: t3 = T3()
sage: t4 = T4()
sage: ci = Cindirect()
sage: cd = Cdirect()  
```

Now for the timings. First, the call method:

```
sage: timeit("a = c1(3)", number=300000)    
300000 loops, best of 3: 280 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = t1(3)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 277 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = ci(3)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 279 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = cd(3)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 278 ns per loop
```

Next, the hash:

```
sage: timeit("a = hash(c2)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 87.6 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = hash(t2)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 85.9 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = hash(ci)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 83.6 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = hash(cd)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 99.7 ns per loop
```

Arithmetics:

```
sage: timeit("a = c3+c3", number=300000)   
300000 loops, best of 3: 149 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = t3+t3", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 83 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = ci+ci", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 77.8 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = cd+cd", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 77.4 ns per loop
```

And a non-magical method:

```
sage: timeit("a = c4.test(4)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 327 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = t4.test(4)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 285 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = ci.test(4)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 444 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a = cd.test(4)", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 364 ns per loop
```

Summary:

For the magical methods, there is no significant speed difference between our suggestions (with exception of addition, but that result looks strange, and I don't really believe it). This would even hold if (in future) we would consider to create metaclasses "dynamically" (i.e., in the same way as I have created `Cindirect` and `Cdirect` above).

It only pays off to *directly* implement stuff in Cython, if non-magical methods are concerned. But I doubt that we want non-magical methods for metaclasses.

So, the decision between our suggestions must rely on different reasons: Which one is simpler and easier to maintain? The plus of my suggestion is that it is direct, i.e., there are less layers of indirection. The plus of your suggestion is that it works without creating an extension type for builtin types.

After a break, I will attach my two patches, and then the discussion can start...

I have attached my two patches. Your patch and my patch actually turn out to be independent.

Purpose of my first patch: Make `NestedClassMetaclass` an extension type of type, and avoid some calling overhead during its creation.

Purpose of my second patch: Make `ClasscallMetclass` an extension type as well, directly derived from `NestedClassMetaclass`.

**__Timings__**

With **sage-5.1.notebook unpatched**, I get for Florent's examples

```
sage: class Rien(object):
....:     pass
....:
sage: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass
sage: class NOCALL(object):
....:     __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
....:     pass
....:
sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.74 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 16.7 ms per loop
sage: class CALL(object):
....:     __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
....:     @staticmethod
....:     def __classcall_private__(cls, arg):
....:         arg = arg + arg
....:         return arg
....:
sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 9.05 ms per loop
```
Here is something with `__classcall__` instead of `__classcall_private__`, and in a way that has less overhead than `arg+arg`:

```
sage: class NewCall(object):
....:     __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
....:     @staticmethod
....:     def __classcall__(cls, C):
....:         return C
....:
sage: C = ZZ.__class__
sage: timeit("a = NewCall(C)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 878 ns per loop
```
And finally a "nested class" example:

```
sage: from sage.misc.nested_class import NestedClassMetaclass
sage: def test_nest():
....:     class A:
....:         __metaclass__ = NestedClassMetaclass
....:         class B:
....:             pass
....:
sage: %timeit test_nest()
625 loops, best of 3: 33.1 Âµs per loop
```

Now, the same examples with my first patch:

```
sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.76 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 18.3 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
25 loops, best of 3: 10.7 ms per loop
sage: %timeit test_nest()
625 loops, best of 3: 23.6 Âµs per loop
```

Now, with your patch only:

```
sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.77 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 2.05 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 4.34 ms per loop
sage: timeit("a = NewCall(C)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 889 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_nest()
625 loops, best of 3: 32.8 Âµs per loop
```

Thus, our patches treat orthogonal aspects. Now, the first two patches together:

```
sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.78 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 2 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 4.34 ms per loop
sage: timeit("a = NewCall(C)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 895 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_nest()
625 loops, best of 3: 23.6 Âµs per loop
```

And with all three patches:

```
sage: %timeit [Rien() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 1.75 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [NOCALL() for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 2.08 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [CALL(i) for i in range(10000)]
125 loops, best of 3: 4.44 ms per loop
sage: timeit("a = NewCall(C)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 897 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_nest()
625 loops, best of 3: 23.6 Âµs per loop
```

__CONCLUSION__

My first patch does improve the time spent for the creation of a nested class. Your patch improves a lot of things for classcall metaclass. My second patch makes (I think) the inheritance a bit clearer, but it does not provide a speed-up. The reason is explained in my previous post.

I fully agree that it is clearer. There may be however some speed penalty with
getting rid of `ClasscallType` if we need at some point to construct a lot
of classes which need the classcall trick but without nested classes. I don't
know if this usecase is realistic at all. Do you have any idea on this
question ? I don't even know if the current dynamic class allows it. Anyway,
there won't be any overhead from the point of view of the instances creation
and, manipulation but there may be when creating the **classes**
themselves. Therefore I think we should measure the relative price of creating
**classes** which `ClasscallType` vs `ClasscallMetaclass`. I'll
investigate this while reviewing your patch.

So my current opinion is: we should do the timing while we can easily do
it. Then if nothing is measurable with the current Sage usage, but measurable
with some weird one, we should remove `ClasscallType` (any unused code and
moreover confusing code shouldn't remain) keeping somewhere a note saying that
if the weird usecase appear (which I don't really believe) we should separate
`ClasscallType` vs `ClasscallMetaclass`.

Cheers,

Florent

Well, the problem is as I have explained in the sage-combinat-devel thread. Some classes would actually not use more than the `__call__` method (so, morally, `ClasscallMetaclass` should only do this one thing), while some would only need nesting or another `__init__` (so, `NestedClassMetaclass` should only do this one thing), and others only need a custom `__reduce__` method (so, `DynamicMetaclass` should only to this one thing).

However, in typical applications, we want to construct a class that simultaneously derives from classes with different metaclasses. That is only possible if we have metaclasses that combine different features. Hence, `ClasscallMetaclass` inherits from `NestedClassMetaclass` (although it often does not need nesting), and there is an additional `DynamicClasscallMetaclass`, just to cope with dynamic classes that have a classcall.

I'd really like to have these combined metaclasses created automatically, hence, using a meta-metaclass.

Concerning time penalty: As I have demonstrated above, there is no time penalty for special methods of a class C that are inherited from different Cython classes - even if the inheritance is indirect. A speed penalty only seems to occur, if one has an *indirect* inheritance of *non-magical* methods.

Hence, if C is actually used as a metaclass, I would expect that both approaches (defining the fast magical methods in `ClasscallType` and other auxiliar types or directly in `ClasscallMetaclass` and other metaclasses) are equal, speed-wise.

See above: There *is* need for combined metaclasses, even though in some applications a pure one-trick metaclass would be enough.

Well, the timings that I presented were for a class C, and I measured some methods (e.g. `__call__`) of its instances. However, I think the same observations will hold if C actually is a *meta*class, and we would measure `__call__` etc. of its instances (which are classes).

But of course the time for creating (not just for calling) the instances matters as well.

Cheers,

Simon

See `__call__`, `__hash__` and `__add__`. I only found a speed penalty for inherited non-magical methods.\n\nHowever, the creation of instances is indeed A LOT faster for cdef classes than for Python classes. Recall the definition of T1, ..., T4, C1, ..., C4, Cdirect and Cindirect.

Let's test:\n\n```\nsage: cython(\"\"\"\n....: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass\n....: def test_creation():\n....:     class A:\n....:         __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass  \n....:         @staticmethod\n....:         def __classcall__(cls, x):\n....:             return x\n....: \"\"\")    \n```\n\nWithout patches:\n\n```\nsage: timeit(\"test_creation()\", number=10000)\n10000 loops, best of 3: 41.7 \u00b5s per loop\n```\n\nWith your patch only:\n\n```\nsage: timeit(\"test_creation()\", number=10000)\n10000 loops, best of 3: 45.8 \u00b5s per loop\n```\n\nWith the first two patches:\n\n```\nsage: timeit(\"test_creation()\", number=10000)\n10000 loops, best of 3: 38.5 \u00b5s per loop\n```\n\nWith all three patches:\n\n```\nsage: timeit(\"test_creation()\", number=10000) \n10000 loops, best of 3: 38.5 \u00b5s per loop\n```\n\nAnd when cimporting the metaclass (which of course only works with all three patches):\n\n```\nsage: cython(\"\"\"\n....: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass cimport ClasscallMetaclass\n....: def test_creation():\n....:     class A:\n....:         __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass  \n....:         @staticmethod\n....:         def __classcall__(cls, x):\n....:             return x\n....: \"\"\")    \nsage: timeit(\"test_creation()\", number=10000)\n10000 loops, best of 3: 38.2 \u00b5s per loop\n```\n\nIn other words: It seems that directly cdefining the metaclasses is not only clearer than the use of `ClasscallType`, but it is indeed a little (but not much) faster.",

In my previous posts, I have demonstrated that some "magical" methods are equally fast for a cdef class and for a python class that inherits from the cdef class. See `__call__`, `__hash__` and `__add__`. I only found a speed penalty for inherited non-magical methods.

However, the creation of instances is indeed A LOT faster for cdef classes than for Python classes. Recall the definition of T1, ..., T4, C1, ..., C4, Cdirect and Cindirect. We get

sage: timeit("a = Cindirect()", number=300000)
300000 loops, best of 3: 20.1 Âµs per loop
```

According to these timings, I would expect that the creation of classes with an actual cdef metaclass (as with my second patch) is faster than the creation of classes with a Python metaclass that inherits from a cdef class (like `ClasscallType`). Let's test:

```
sage: cython("""
....: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass
....: def test_creation():
....:     class A:
....:         __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass  
....:         @staticmethod
....:         def __classcall__(cls, x):
....:             return x
....: """)    
```

Without patches:

```
sage: timeit("test_creation()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 41.7 Âµs per loop
```

With your patch only:

```
sage: timeit("test_creation()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 45.8 Âµs per loop
```

With the first two patches:

```
sage: timeit("test_creation()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.5 Âµs per loop
```

With all three patches:

```
sage: timeit("test_creation()", number=10000) 
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.5 Âµs per loop
```

And when cimporting the metaclass (which of course only works with all three patches):

```
sage: cython("""
....: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass cimport ClasscallMetaclass
....: def test_creation():
....:     class A:
....:         __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass  
....:         @staticmethod
....:         def __classcall__(cls, x):
....:             return x
....: """)    
sage: timeit("test_creation()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 38.2 Âµs per loop
```

In other words: It seems that directly cdefining the metaclasses is not only clearer than the use of `ClasscallType`, but it is indeed a little (but not much) faster.

Hi Simon,

Thanks again for those very precise timing measures. I'm sorry I wasn't
completely clear on the timing I wanted to have. Here is what I hope is a
clearer explanation:

There is a common usage of `ClasscallMetaclass` and
`__classcall_private__` for elements in order to delegate the creation to
the parent. For example, the call

```
sage: PerfectMatching([(1,2),(3,4)])
PerfectMatching [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
```
actually create the parent:

```
sage: P4 = PerfectMatchings(4); P4
Set of perfect matchings of {1, 2, 3, 4}
```
And calls

```
sage: P4([(1,2),(3,4)])
PerfectMatching [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
```
This is done by a classcall trick. There isn't currently a lot of this trick
in Sage library but many more are coming from the Sage-combinat queue.

Now I don't see any element class having a nested class. So in an ideal world,
we'd like to have `PerfectMatching` in `ClasscallMetaclass` but not in
`NestedClassMetaclass`. From your timings, I clearly see that being in
`NestedClassMetaclass` doesn't impact creation of the element, but I was
wondering how it impact the creation of the class `element_class`
itself. As I said, I don't currently see any usecase where we will create a
lot of `element_class` but who knows...

So here are the timings:

```
sage: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallType
sage: from sage.structure.element import Element

sage: %timeit  type('toto', (Element,), {})
625 loops, best of 3: 25.9 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit  ClasscallType('toto', (Element,), {})
625 loops, best of 3: 31 Âµs per loop
```
With your patch cdefing `NestedclassMetaclass`, there is a slight overhead
in being in `NestedClassMetaclass`:

```
sage: %timeit  ClasscallMetaclass('toto', (Element,), {})
625 loops, best of 3: 36.9 Âµs per loop
```
The overhead is quite similar when `NestedclassMetaclass` is not cdef:

```
sage: %timeit  ClasscallMetaclass('toto', (Element,), {})
625 loops, best of 3: 37.2 Âµs per loop
```
Now this case is not very realistic since there are no methods in the new
class. Let's put some by getting a realistic dictionary:

```
sage: dct = dict(PerfectMatching.__dict__)
sage: len(dct)
24
```
With a cdef `NestedclassMetaclass`

```
sage: %timeit  type('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 27 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit  ClasscallType('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 31.7 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit  ClasscallMetaclass('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 48.9 Âµs per loop
```
Without a cdef `NestedclassMetaclass`

```
sage: %timeit  type('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 28.8 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit  ClasscallType('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 32.5 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit  ClasscallMetaclass('toto', (Element,), dct)
625 loops, best of 3: 50.6 Âµs per loop
```


As a conclusion in some realistic usecases: the slowdown for having
`ClasscallMetaclass` systematically inheriting from
`NestedclassMetaclass`, that is no `ClasscallType` is 48.9 Âµs vs 31.7
Âµs. This is non negligible (after all calling the
`modify_for_nested_pickle` indeed has a cost) but much less that I
expected. Since I see no realistic usage in creating a lot of such classes, I
think I'm Ok with your second patch. I'd like to have Nicolas opinion on that,
since he is the one that raised this question.

I'm reviewing your two patches (after having lunch).

Good example! That's exactly along the lines of the [sage-combinat thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/ae09de5a608525e5) I started: We have common use cases in which we want to combine the nested class feature with the classcall feature, and thus someone has decided to make classcall inherit from nested class, although there are examples in which this is not needed.

Instead, one could either create a pure classcall metaclass on the one hand, and a combined `ClasscallNestedClassMetaclass` on the other hand: This is similar to the `DynamicClasscallMetaclass`, which is a combined class for `DynamicMetaclass` and `ClasscallMetaclass`. Of course, having "pure" `ClasscallMetaclass`, `NestedClassMetaclass` and `DynamicMetaclass`, we would need to create four combined metaclasses to cover all potential use cases.

Or: We could have a meta-metaclass that creates the combined metaclasses automatically...
