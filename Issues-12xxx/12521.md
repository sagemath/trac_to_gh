Currently, we use MPFR or Ginac to evaluate `log_gamma`, but this returns `NaN` for negative input with even ceiling.

```
sage: log_gamma(-2.1)
NaN
sage: log_gamma(-3.1)
0.400311696703985
sage: log_gamma(-4.1)

['ginac']
sage: log_gamma(CC(-2.1))
1.53171380819509 + 3.14159265358979*I
```
We can use mpmath or something other trick to get this to work, now that #10075 has a  nice symbolic function available.  See #10072 for where we originally got better numerical evaluation.

```
sage: mpmath.loggamma(-2.1)
mpc(real='1.5317138081950856', imag='-9.4247779607693793')
```
Putting as defect because there is a log gamma for negative numbers, though we should talk about branches...

Apply: [attachment: trac_12521_3.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12521/trac_12521_3.patch.gz)

There is now also the arb option:

```
sage: x=ComplexBallField(53)(-2.1)
sage: %timeit _ = x.log_gamma()
The slowest run took 8.11 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.15 Âµs per loop
sage: x.log_gamma()
[1.53171380819509 +/- 5.52e-15] + [-9.42477796076938 +/- 2.48e-15]*I

I cannot reproduce some examples from the description with Sage 4.8:

sage: from sage.misc.citation import get_systems

Do you use a different version? Did you apply some patches?

Yes, I guess this is after #10075.  There is the same problem before that patch, but the systems and outputs will be different.   In particular, inheriting from the parent of the input (which most generic `Function` classes do) if it has a method of the same name (which `CC` does) makes this change.

There is no patch, so this doesn't depend on #10075 in that sense, but I will put it anyway so that it's clear.  Thanks!

by the way, MPFR provides two functions: `mpfr_lngamma` indeed returns `NaN` between
`-2k-1` and `-2k` for `k` a non-negative integer.

However there is another function `mpfr_lgamma` which returns `log(abs(gamma(x)))`,
and separately the sign of `gamma(x)`. It suffices to add `pi*I` when the sign is
negative.

This would solve the problem at least for real input.

There is a related issue with the beta function:

```
sage: beta(-1.3,-0.4)
NaN
sage: (gamma(-1.3) * gamma(-0.4)) / gamma(-1.3 - 0.4) # expected functionality
-4.92909641669610
```

This is presumably because GiNaC uses `exp(log_gamma(-1.3)+log_gamma(-0.4)-log_gamma(-1.3-0.4))` to evaluate, and `gamma(-0.4)` is negative. I'm confused as to why it works fine in the GiNaC interactive shell though.

Changing to critical because the documentation claims that it's the principal branch, which is mathematically wrong.

Paul, could you please comment on this code for `sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx`?


```
    def log_gamma(self):
        cdef RealNumber x = self._new()
        cdef int sign
        parent = (<RealField_class>self._parent)
        if parent.__prec > SIG_PREC_THRESHOLD: sig_on()
        mpfr_lgamma(x.value, &sign, self.value, parent.rnd)
        if parent.__prec > SIG_PREC_THRESHOLD: sig_off()
        if not mpfr_sgn(self.value) < 0:
            return x
        cdef RealNumber v = self._new()
        mpfr_div_si((<RealNumber>v).value, self.value, 2, parent.rnd)
        return parent.complex_field()(x, parent.pi() *
                                      (2 * (v - 1).ceil() + 1))
```

This correctly computes the principal branch. However, I'm concerned about precision; the result of `lgamma` is presumably guaranteed to be correct up to the precision of the input, but after doing some arithmetic it might not be. Is there any way to fix this?

Dear Eviatar,

I see no argument to tell the precision of the output in this function, thus I guess the result should be computed to the precision of the input.

Then the real part seems fine to me.

For the imaginary part, you create the variable `v` with the same precision than the input I guess.
In `v-1` you might have a problem if `v` is very large, then `v-1` rounded will equal `v`,
and `(v-1).ceil()` will equal `v` too. Thus the result will be too large by `2pi`.

Paul

The patchbot complains about old style doctest continuation.

Since you need to edit the patch anyway... In the `py_lgamma` function from `pynac.pyx`, you don't need to import `call` from `mpmath` or `parent` from `sage.structure.coerce`. These are already available as `mpmath_utils.call` and `parent_c`.

Thanks for the patch! Great work noticing that we don't actually compute the principal branch.
