Currently, we use MPFR or Ginac to evaluate `log_gamma`, but this returns `NaN` for negative input with even ceiling.

```
sage: log_gamma(-2.1)
NaN
sage: log_gamma(-3.1)
0.400311696703985
sage: log_gamma(-4.1)
NaN
sage: log_gamma(-5.1)
-2.63991581673655
sage: log_gamma(-21/10).n()
NaN
sage: get_systems('log_gamma(-21/10).n()')
['ginac']
sage: log_gamma(CC(-2.1))
1.53171380819509 + 3.14159265358979*I
```
We can use mpmath or something other trick to get this to work, now that #10075 has a  nice symbolic function available.  See #10072 for where we originally got better numerical evaluation.

```
sage: mpmath.loggamma(-2.1)
mpc(real='1.5317138081950856', imag='-9.4247779607693793')
```
Putting as defect because there is a log gamma for negative numbers, though we should talk about branches...

Apply: [attachment: trac_12521_3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12521/trac_12521_3.patch.gz)

There is now also the arb option:

```
sage: x=ComplexBallField(53)(-2.1)
sage: %timeit _ = x.log_gamma()
The slowest run took 8.11 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.15 Âµs per loop
sage: x.log_gamma()
[1.53171380819509 +/- 5.52e-15] + [-9.42477796076938 +/- 2.48e-15]*I
```

by the way, MPFR provides two functions: `mpfr_lngamma` indeed returns `NaN` between
`-2k-1` and `-2k` for `k` a non-negative integer.

However there is another function `mpfr_lgamma` which returns `log(abs(gamma(x)))`,
and separately the sign of `gamma(x)`. It suffices to add `pi*I` when the sign is
negative.

This would solve the problem at least for real input.

There is a related issue with the beta function:

```
sage: beta(-1.3,-0.4)
NaN
sage: (gamma(-1.3) * gamma(-0.4)) / gamma(-1.3 - 0.4) # expected functionality
-4.92909641669610
```

This is presumably because GiNaC uses `exp(log_gamma(-1.3)+log_gamma(-0.4)-log_gamma(-1.3-0.4))` to evaluate, and `gamma(-0.4)` is negative. I'm confused as to why it works fine in the GiNaC interactive shell though.

Paul, could you please comment on this code for `sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx`?


```
    def log_gamma(self):
        cdef RealNumber x = self._new()
        cdef int sign
        parent = (<RealField_class>self._parent)
        if parent.__prec > SIG_PREC_THRESHOLD: sig_on()
        mpfr_lgamma(x.value, &sign, self.value, parent.rnd)
        if parent.__prec > SIG_PREC_THRESHOLD: sig_off()
        if not mpfr_sgn(self.value) < 0:
            return x
        cdef RealNumber v = self._new()
        mpfr_div_si((<RealNumber>v).value, self.value, 2, parent.rnd)
        return parent.complex_field()(x, parent.pi() *
                                      (2 * (v - 1).ceil() + 1))
```

This correctly computes the principal branch. However, I'm concerned about precision; the result of `lgamma` is presumably guaranteed to be correct up to the precision of the input, but after doing some arithmetic it might not be. Is there any way to fix this?

Dear Eviatar,

I see no argument to tell the precision of the output in this function, thus I guess the result should be computed to the precision of the input.

Then the real part seems fine to me.

For the imaginary part, you create the variable `v` with the same precision than the input I guess.
In `v-1` you might have a problem if `v` is very large, then `v-1` rounded will equal `v`,
and `(v-1).ceil()` will equal `v` too. Thus the result will be too large by `2pi`.

Paul
