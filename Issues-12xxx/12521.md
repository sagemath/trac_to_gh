Currently, we use MPFR or Ginac to evaluate `log_gamma`, but this returns `NaN` for negative input with even ceiling.

```
sage: log_gamma(-2.1)
NaN
sage: log_gamma(-3.1)
0.400311696703985
sage: log_gamma(-4.1)
NaN
sage: log_gamma(-5.1)
-2.63991581673655
sage: log_gamma(-21/10).n()
NaN
sage: get_systems('log_gamma(-21/10).n()')
['ginac']
sage: log_gamma(CC(-2.1))
1.53171380819509 + 3.14159265358979*I
```
We can use mpmath or something other trick to get this to work, now that #10075 has a  nice symbolic function available.  See #10072 for where we originally got better numerical evaluation.

```
sage: mpmath.loggamma(-2.1)
mpc(real='1.5317138081950856', imag='-9.4247779607693793')
```
Putting as defect because there is a log gamma for negative numbers, though we should talk about branches...

Apply: [attachment:trac_12521_3.patch]

There is now also the arb option:

```
sage: x=ComplexBallField(53)(-2.1)
sage: %timeit _ = x.log_gamma()
The slowest run took 8.11 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 8.15 µs per loop

Yes, I guess this is after #10075.  There is the same problem before that patch, but the systems and outputs will be different.   In particular, inheriting from the parent of the input (which most generic `Function` classes do) if it has a method of the same name (which `CC` does) makes this change.

There is no patch, so this doesn't depend on #10075 in that sense, but I will put it anyway so that it's clear.  Thanks!

by the way, MPFR provides two functions: `mpfr_lngamma` indeed returns `NaN` between
`-2k-1` and `-2k` for `k` a non-negative integer.

However there is another function `mpfr_lgamma` which returns `log(abs(gamma(x)))`,
and separately the sign of `gamma(x)`. It suffices to add `pi*I` when the sign is
negative.

This would solve the problem at least for real input.

There is a related issue with the beta function:

```
sage: beta(-1.3,-0.4)
NaN
sage: (gamma(-1.3) * gamma(-0.4)) / gamma(-1.3 - 0.4) # expected functionality
-4.92909641669610
```

This is presumably because GiNaC uses `exp(log_gamma(-1.3)+log_gamma(-0.4)-log_gamma(-1.3-0.4))` to evaluate, and `gamma(-0.4)` is negative. I'm confused as to why it works fine in the GiNaC interactive shell though.

Dear Eviatar,

I see no argument to tell the precision of the output in this function, thus I guess the result should be computed to the precision of the input.

Then the real part seems fine to me.

For the imaginary part, you create the variable `v` with the same precision than the input I guess.
In `v-1` you might have a problem if `v` is very large, then `v-1` rounded will equal `v`,
and `(v-1).ceil()` will equal `v` too. Thus the result will be too large by `2pi`.

The patchbot complains about old style doctest continuation.

Since you need to edit the patch anyway... In the `py_lgamma` function from `pynac.pyx`, you don't need to import `call` from `mpmath` or `parent` from `sage.structure.coerce`. These are already available as `mpmath_utils.call` and `parent_c`.

Thanks for the patch! Great work noticing that we don't actually compute the principal branch.

Thanks!

I had already fixed the doctest continuation and overwrote the previous patch, but the patchbot didn't test it again.

I fixed the import issue. I also noticed that the results for Python `float` and `complex` were inconsistent, so I fixed that and added some tests.

Also, it seems the algorithm for complex numbers is much faster than for real numbers, so we should probably use the complex algorithm for all inputs:

```
sage: a=RealField(53)(2.5); timeit('log_gamma(a)')
625 loops, best of 3: 118 µs per loop
sage: a=ComplexField(53)(2.5); timeit('log_gamma(a)')
625 loops, best of 3: 112 µs per loop
```

```
sage: a=RealField(10**4)(2.5); timeit('log_gamma(a)')
5 loops, best of 3: 506 ms per loop
sage: a=ComplexField(10**4)(2.5); timeit('log_gamma(a)')
625 loops, best of 3: 782 µs per loop
