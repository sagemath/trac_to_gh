Keywords: solver parameters

Several requests for solver options to use as parameters for GLPK prompt us to allow the user to set quite a few parameters.

In addition, the name for the solver parameter in ticket #12309 (`preprocessing`) isn't very accurate (we didn't think it through carefully enough at the time) so that option will change, too.

I propose to change/enable the following solver options. See the GLPK documentation for details on each option, and note that most have two names: one to correspond to GLPK, one for legibility.

* glpk's solver
  * default is `glp_intopt`, as at present
  * `simplex_first`: setting this to `True` makes the solver invoke `glp_simplex` before `glp_intopt`
    * useful to avoid problems in glpk
    * **replaces** current `preprocessing` parameter
  * `simplex_only`: setting this to `True makes the solver invoke `glp_simplex` **instead** of `glp_intopt`

* glpk's `intopt` solver
  * `msg_level` or `verbosity`
  * `br_tech` or `branching`
  * `bt_tech` or `backtracking`
  * `pp_tech` or `preprocessing`
  * `fp_heur` or `feasibility_pump`
  * `gmi_cuts` or `gomory_cuts`
  * `mir_cuts` or `mixed_int_rounding_cuts`
  * `cov_cuts` or `mixed_cover_cuts`
  * `clq_cuts` or `clique_cuts`
  * `tol_int` or `absolute_tolerance`
  * `tol_obj` or `relative_tolerance`
  * `mip_gap` or `mip_gap_tolerance`
  * `tm_lim` or `time_limit`
  * `out_freq` or `output_frequency`
  * `presolve` or `mip_presolver`
  * `binarize`

* glpk's `simplex` solver
  * `msg_level` or `verbosity`
  * `meth` or `primal_v_dual`
  * `pricing`
  * `r_test` or `ratio_test`
  * `tol_bnd` or `tolerance_primal`
  * `tol_dj` or `tolerance_dual`
  * `tol_piv` or `tolerance_pivot`
  * `obj_ll` or `obj_lower_limit`
  * `obj_ul` or `obj_upper_limit`
  * `it_lim` or `iteration_limit`
  * `tm_lim` or `time_limit`
  * `out_frq` or `output_frequency`
  * `out_dly` or `output_delay`
  * `presolve`

Feel free to suggest better names, or that we stick with only the GLPK names, etc.

Raniere,

I don't like the idea of using strings for the solver parameter name. This is primarily for efficiency reasons; you have to remember that in my projects, I create a lot of small LPs, & don't want to deal with the string comparisons when an integer comparison will do much better.

I will upload another patch in a little bit (I finally figured out how to do it) and you can tell me what you think of this approach.

Argh. Expressed myself badly: I meant,

Although, given that the name is passed as a string, that may be a dumb objection.

Did you try whether it really makes a difference in practice ? I mean, if you replace the arguments by integers and feed it with the right integer, is it really faster ? I am afraid of Python's own efficiency, and I wonder if this may not be the real bottleneck :-)

John,
using strings for name and value was my first and only ideia of how to do GLPKBackend.solver_parameter work with MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solver_parameter with not import GLPKBackend module.
For some parameter that only two values are avaliable it's possible to use True and False as values.

The declaration of the `solve()` method of the `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` class is

```
    def solve(self, solver=None, log=0, objective_only=False):
```
Within the function we have

```
        self._backend.set_verbosity(log)
```
Makes sense, you say, right? Well, no, for three reasons:

1. It renders moot the `msg_lev` solver paramter.
2. It's a bit weird to initialize `log`  to 0, since the solvers are already initialized to shut up in `__cinit__` .
3. Someone might want to see whether the solver is making any progress, by setting the verbosity through the solver parameter, rather than through `solve()` .

IMHO, the user ought to have that option; otherwise, there's no point to allowing a `msg_level` option at all. This is easily fixed, too: change the default value of `log` to `None`, and then the code to,

```
        if log != None:
          self._backend.set_verbosity(log)
```
This should retain compatibility with the previous setup.

What do you guys think?

While working on this tonight, I realized that mip.pyx expects the `timelimit` parameter for both CPLEX and GLPK to be in seconds. To get around this, I added a new parameter, `timelimit_intopt` and `timelimit_simplex`; these accept milliseconds.

I also added a couple of new doctests, one to test this difference.

I would like to doctest output when we set `msg_level` to something other than `...off`, but apparently the doctest facility doesn't recognize output produced by linked C code, only output produced by Python or Cython. If anyone has an idea on how to make that work, let me know.

Otherwise, I guess this is ready. (I've tested it with some of my own code, too.)

NEEDS REVIEW.

Hmmm... Why do you name this parameter timelimit_intopt or timelimit_simplex and not timelimit_seconds, or something like that ? What does it specifically have to do with simplex or intopt ? I think it would be better to have only one parameter for timelimit, and if you think that milliseconds are better what about having only one parameter which accepts milliseconds ? By the way, it is already possible to define the timelimit up to milisecond with this argument. The code actually multiplies the input by 1000 before updating GLPK's value `:-)`

Attachment [trac_12736_more_solver_options_for_glpk.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket12736/trac_12736_more_solver_options_for_glpk.patch) by @johnperry-math created at 2012-04-12 22:37:18

I've uploaded a new patch that restores things as they were.

Also, perhaps you wrote the wrong thing earlier: it occurred to me later that I might have uploaded the wrong patch... This one is definitely different, as you can find the GLP_ETMLIM and GLP_EITLIM signals used.

I looked at the generated html documentation, and it looked great! So, if you're okay with the current patch, I think we can award it a positive review?

Helloooooooo John !!

Well, if you also agree with my changes then I guess this patch can go ! I regret that it is hard to test these timelimit exceptions, though I did a test myself by modifying a hard LP and solving it with a time limit. The exception is indeed thrown, and besides the last message printed by GLPK is 

```
TIME LIMIT EXCEEDED; SEARCH TERMINATED
```
So well... It will show anyway `:-)`

On the practical side, all doctests pass with GLPK as the default solver, the documentation is nice, well. Good addition `:-)`
