Adding a Testsuite run in #12876 in the documentation of
sage.categories.hecke_modules.HeckeModules.ParentMethods._Hom_
revealed the following bug:

```
sage: M = ModularForms(Gamma0(7), 4)

`TestSuite(H).run()` also fails for "_test_elements".

With that approach, I get

```

        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar/homspace.py # 1 doctests failed

        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/hecke_operator_on_qexp.py # 2 doctests failed
```
which isn't so bad, because most of them fail due to new class names from the category framework.

Suggestion: I provide a small reviewer patch at #12876 making the `TestSuite` skip more tests, and then a proper solution will be dealt with here.

Here is one particularly nasty thing. I stored some objects involved in errors. Reloading them, I find the following in a patched version (as suggested above):

```
sage: A = load("/home/king/SAGE/work/categories/modformA")
sage: B = load("/home/king/SAGE/work/categories/modformB")
sage: A
Modular Symbols space of dimension 3 and level 5, weight 7, character [i], sign 1, over Number Field in c with defining polynomial x^2 - 402*i over its base field
sage: B
Modular Symbols space of dimension 3 and level 5, weight 7, character [i], sign 1, over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: A.boundary_space().dimension()
0
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: x = polygen(K); L.<c> = K.extension(x^2 - 402*i)
sage: chi = DirichletGroup(5, K).gen(0)
sage: N = Newforms(chi, 7, base_ring = L)
sage: Newforms(chi, 7, names='a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Unable to coerce x (=[-1]
[-1]  
[-1]) to a morphism in Set of Morphisms from Modular Symbols space of dimension 3 and level 5, weight 7, character [i], sign 1, over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 to Boundary Modular Symbols space of level 5, weight 7, character [i] and dimension 1 over Number Field in c with defining polynomial x^2 - 402*i over its base field in Category of commutative additive groups
sage: A.boundary_space().dimension()
1
```
Hence, `A.boundary_space()` used to be of dimension zero, but during the computation, it is turned into dimension one!

That does not happen without the patch:

```
sage: A = load("/home/king/SAGE/work/categories/modformA")
sage: B = load("/home/king/SAGE/work/categories/modformB")
sage: A.boundary_space().dimension()
0
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: x = polygen(K); L.<c> = K.extension(x^2 - 402*i)
sage: chi = DirichletGroup(5, K).gen(0)
sage: N = Newforms(chi, 7, base_ring = L)
sage: Newforms(chi, 7, names='a')
[q + a0*q^2 + (i*a0 - 5*i + 5)*q^3 + ((-5*i - 5)*a0 + 24*i)*q^4 + ((10*i - 5)*a0 - 40*i - 55)*q^5 + O(q^6)]
sage: A.boundary_space().dimension()
0
```

Further digging reveals: `A.boundary_space().dimension()` is indeed *not* constant! It relies on a list of known generators, that may grow. But with my patch, the homset assumes that the dimensions are constant. Bad me.

@koffie `TestSuite` runs a bunch of "standard" tests on the object (i.e., all of the `_test_*` methods of an object) as a consistency check. Also, if you add your (real) name to the reviewers.

@fchapoton I believe we are now claiming it passes the `TestSuite`, so I think we should explicitly add that as a doctest.

Could we add a `TestSuite` that skips the `_test_elements` (this is done for other Homsets too)?
