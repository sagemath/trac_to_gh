Adding a Testsuite run in #12876 in the documentation of
sage.categories.hecke_modules.HeckeModules.ParentMethods._Hom_
revealed the following bug:

```

`TestSuite(H).run()` also fails for "_test_elements".

Nicolas suggested to me to move this from #12876 to here. I found the following steps needed:

* Make `HeckeModule_generic` inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`. I guess it was for a reason that William did not always want modular forms being cached (there *is* a cache, but it isn't always used). Since nowadays the cache has weak keys, it shouldn't be so bad. I'll ask on sage-nt.
* Provide the Hecke homsets with a `__reduce__` method, so that (after the Hecke modules being unique) the homsets are identical.
* Provide the Hecke homsets with an `Element` attribute, and let the constructors return instances of the `element_class`. Note that there is only *one* type of morphisms being returned, hence, having a default element class absolutely makes sense.
* It was impossible to override the custom `__call__` method of Hecke homsets by a proper `_element_construtor_`, since there is yet another custon `__call__` method up in the class hierarchy.
* Provide the Hecke homsets with a `zero()` method - the default one wouldn't work.
* Provide the Hecke homsets with an `_an_element_` method. The idea is: Domain and codomain have a known dimension, and the morphisms are given by matrices anyway. Hence, I construct the corresponding matrix space (which I made a lazy attribute to the Hecke homsets), take `an_element` from the matrix space, and return the corresponding morphism.

With that approach, I get

```
        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/abvar/homspace.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/constructor.py # 3 doctests failed

        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/hecke_operator_on_qexp.py # 2 doctests failed
```
which isn't so bad, because most of them fail due to new class names from the category framework.

Suggestion: I provide a small reviewer patch at #12876 making the `TestSuite` skip more tests, and then a proper solution will be dealt with here.

Sorry, that was wrong. More nasty errors happen as well.

Here is one particularly nasty thing. I stored some objects involved in errors. Reloading them, I find the following in a patched version (as suggested above):

```
sage: A = load("/home/king/SAGE/work/categories/modformA")
sage: B = load("/home/king/SAGE/work/categories/modformB")
sage: A
Modular Symbols space of dimension 3 and level 5, weight 7, character [i], sign 1, over Number Field in c with defining polynomial x^2 - 402*i over its base field
sage: B
Modular Symbols space of dimension 3 and level 5, weight 7, character [i], sign 1, over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: A.boundary_space().dimension()
0
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: x = polygen(K); L.<c> = K.extension(x^2 - 402*i)
sage: chi = DirichletGroup(5, K).gen(0)
sage: N = Newforms(chi, 7, base_ring = L)
sage: Newforms(chi, 7, names='a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Unable to coerce x (=[-1]
[-1]  
[-1]) to a morphism in Set of Morphisms from Modular Symbols space of dimension 3 and level 5, weight 7, character [i], sign 1, over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 to Boundary Modular Symbols space of level 5, weight 7, character [i] and dimension 1 over Number Field in c with defining polynomial x^2 - 402*i over its base field in Category of commutative additive groups
sage: A.boundary_space().dimension()
1
```
Hence, `A.boundary_space()` used to be of dimension zero, but during the computation, it is turned into dimension one!

That does not happen without the patch:

```
sage: A = load("/home/king/SAGE/work/categories/modformA")
sage: B = load("/home/king/SAGE/work/categories/modformB")
sage: A.boundary_space().dimension()
0
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: x = polygen(K); L.<c> = K.extension(x^2 - 402*i)
sage: chi = DirichletGroup(5, K).gen(0)
sage: N = Newforms(chi, 7, base_ring = L)
sage: Newforms(chi, 7, names='a')
[q + a0*q^2 + (i*a0 - 5*i + 5)*q^3 + ((-5*i - 5)*a0 + 24*i)*q^4 + ((10*i - 5)*a0 - 40*i - 55)*q^5 + O(q^6)]
sage: A.boundary_space().dimension()
0
```

Further digging reveals: `A.boundary_space().dimension()` is indeed *not* constant! It relies on a list of known generators, that may grow. But with my patch, the homset assumes that the dimensions are constant. Bad me.

`@`mderickx `TestSuite` runs a bunch of "standard" tests on the object (i.e., all of the `_test_*` methods of an object) as a consistency check. Also, if you add your (real) name to the reviewers.

`@`chapoton I believe we are now claiming it passes the `TestSuite`, so I think we should explicitly add that as a doctest.

That is a common issue for Homsets because of it creating elements that are not specifically an instance of its unique `Element` class. Currently, we don't have the infastructure to really work around this.

Could we add a `TestSuite` that skips the `_test_elements` (this is done for other Homsets too)?
