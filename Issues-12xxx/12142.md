Let us perform a simple addition of finite field elements that are represented using PARI.

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(3^11)
sage: x = F.random_element()
sage: y = F.random_element()
sage: %timeit x + y
625 loops, best of 3: 13.2 µs per loop
```
Let us now measure how much time the *actual* addition takes:

```
sage: vx = x._FiniteField_ext_pariElement__value
sage: vy = y._FiniteField_ext_pariElement__value
sage: %timeit vx + vy
625 loops, best of 3: 4.6 µs per loop
```
This means two thirds of the execution time is used to wrap a ribbon around the result and only one third for the actual addition!

But in fact Pari has a faster implementation for finite fields than this!  This was already mentioned at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/e2dbbc72caeb589a

```
sage: def pari_ffelt(x): parix=pari(x); return parix.lift().subst(parix.variable(), "ffgen((%s).mod)"%parix) 

sage: px = pari_ffelt(x)
sage: py = pari_ffelt(y)
sage: %timeit px + py
625 loops, best of 3: 2.43 µs per loop
```
For multiplication, we have the following timings:

```
sage: %timeit x * y
625 loops, best of 3: 18.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit vx * vy
625 loops, best of 3: 8.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit px * py
625 loops, best of 3: 3.33 µs per loop
```

This ticket implements an interface to PARI's FFELT type for non-prime finite fields.  It can be tested by constructing finite fields as follows, for *p* prime and *n* >= 2:

```
sage: F.<a> = FiniteField(p^n, impl='pari_ffelt')
```
This implementation should probably become the default for non-prime finite fields of characteristic > 2 and cardinality > 2<sup>16</sup>, superseding the existing PARI polmod implementation.  This switch is the goal of ticket #14888.

I have been working on an interface to PARI's implementation of finite fields (`t_FFELT`).  Like for the other interfaces (except the existing PARI polmod implementation), the field class is written in Python and the element class in Cython.  I hope to upload a patch soon after cleaning up the documentation and fixing a minor problem.

The speed improvement for addition and multiplication relative to the current implementation appears to vary roughly from a factor 3 to a factor 12, depending on the size of the field.

For small fields, this PARI interface is (of course) much slower than Givaro (a factor 4-6 for **F**_{3<sup>10</sup>}).  For fields of characteristic 2, it is slower than NTL+gf2x, but the difference is not that dramatic.

Maybe we could take this opportunity to fix it as well and so increase coverage.

Yes, it works and there are doctests.  Finite field elements are not implemented as type `gen` (as in `libs/pari/gen.pyx`), so the fact that pickling does not work for a `gen` that happens to be a `t_FFELT` does not affect this ticket.

Actually the doctest coverage of all files in `sage/rings/finite_rings` is 100%, except `integer_mod.pyx`, which has a coverage of only 99/150 functions.  Apart from that, I think I saw one or two colons that should be double colons.  I don't think it is really worth the trouble to spend time on that in this ticket.
