Let us perform a simple addition of finite field elements that are represented using PARI.

```
sage: F.<a> = GF(3^11)
sage: x = F.random_element()
sage: y = F.random_element()
sage: %timeit x + y
625 loops, best of 3: 13.2 µs per loop
```
Let us now measure how much time the *actual* addition takes:

```
sage: vx = x._FiniteField_ext_pariElement__value
sage: vy = y._FiniteField_ext_pariElement__value
sage: %timeit vx + vy
625 loops, best of 3: 4.6 µs per loop
```
This means two thirds of the execution time is used to wrap a ribbon around the result and only one third for the actual addition!

But in fact Pari has a faster implementation for finite fields than this!  This was already mentioned at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/e2dbbc72caeb589a

```
sage: def pari_ffelt(x): parix=pari(x); return parix.lift().subst(parix.variable(), "ffgen((%s).mod)"%parix) 

sage: px = pari_ffelt(x)
sage: py = pari_ffelt(y)
sage: %timeit px + py
625 loops, best of 3: 2.43 µs per loop
```
For multiplication, we have the following timings:

```
sage: %timeit x * y
625 loops, best of 3: 18.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit vx * vy
625 loops, best of 3: 8.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit px * py
625 loops, best of 3: 3.33 µs per loop
```

This ticket implements an interface to PARI's FFELT type for non-prime finite fields.  It can be tested by constructing finite fields as follows, for *p* prime and *n* >= 2:

```
sage: F.<a> = FiniteField(p^n, impl='pari_ffelt')
```
This implementation should probably become the default for non-prime finite fields of characteristic > 2 and cardinality > 2<sup>16</sup>, superseding the existing PARI polmod implementation.  This switch is the goal of ticket #14888.

I have been working on an interface to PARI's implementation of finite fields (`t_FFELT`).  Like for the other interfaces (except the existing PARI polmod implementation), the field class is written in Python and the element class in Cython.  I hope to upload a patch soon after cleaning up the documentation and fixing a minor problem.

The speed improvement for addition and multiplication relative to the current implementation appears to vary roughly from a factor 3 to a factor 12, depending on the size of the field.

For small fields, this PARI interface is (of course) much slower than Givaro (a factor 4-6 for **F**_{3<sup>10</sup>}).  For fields of characteristic 2, it is slower than NTL+gf2x, but the difference is not that dramatic.

Here are some timings for addition and multiplication in the various implementations:

```

all times in microseconds

Addition:  %timeit -c -r 1 x + y

This change looks ok to me, and is very well documented.

I did not really pay attention to the doctests missing as you were copying from a large previous Sage file.
Maybe we could take this opportunity to fix it as well and so increase coverage.

Actually the doctest coverage of all files in `sage/rings/finite_rings` is 100%, except `integer_mod.pyx`, which has a coverage of only 99/150 functions.  Apart from that, I think I saw one or two colons that should be double colons.  I don't think it is really worth the trouble to spend time on that in this ticket.
