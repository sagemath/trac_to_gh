There are several improvements that would be good to make, including but not limited to:

1. Forking rather than starting up a new Sage each time.
2. Customizable comparison rather than mutating doctests into new doctests (e.g. followup to #10952). 
3. Eliminate need to write temporary files for every doctested file.
4. Constant headaches caused by the difference in doctesting library vs. non-library files. 
5. The ability to drop into a debugger if a doctest raises an exception.

Ready for review!

There are still a few known issues:

* valgrinding under sage -t doesn't work.  I haven't used valgrind much and don't know how to resolve this.
* The fix at #13147 probably needs work: I'm getting a failure in `sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular` to do with garbage collection.  I'm working on it.
* I'm in the process of updating the developer guide.

But I wanted to get some other people involved in reviewing.

This may be a silly question, but how do I use the new framework? Don't we need changes to the scripts repo, too?  (If I just run `sage -t FILES`, I don't see the various messages, like `Doctesting ...`, that should be printed by `run_doctests` are not printed, so `sage -t` is not yet using the new framework.)

One of the patches also didn't apply cleanly to 5.1.beta5:

I don't think it needs to be, but it makes it easy to test (and debug) doctests from within Sage:

```
sage: run_doctests(sage.rings.integer)
...
```

Am I doing something wrong?

    Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
    This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug

    want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.

Remaining problems:

* #13145 needs work, generating some doctest failures related to deallocating multivariate polynomials
* hg_sage seems to be broken, causing the --new option to fail
* valgrinding `sage -t` doesn't work; I'm not sure whether it did before
* The new code doesn't support xml output

I'll see if I find more when running `sage -t --all`.

Use `sys.stdout.flush()` (and/or the same for `stderr`) before `os.system()` to overcome this.  The difference is probably that my output was sent to a pipe, as opposed to directly to the terminal. In the latter case, flushing is automatic.

True, I might not have applied all patches correctly.

> Design question: when running tests in parallel, failed examples are printed as they arise, meaning that examples from different files are intermingled.  Is this a problem that needs to be fixed?

It might not be truly a problem, but I prefer the current model where the tests for one file are grouped.

A very useful feature from the previous doctester which is missing here is that `--verbose` actually shows the output as the test is running.  So when it gets stuck somewhere, you actually see that it gets stuck.  Currently, the whole test result is simply dumped at the end.

Also: previously, line numbers were shown with `--verbose` (albeit in a very bad way).

One more feature-request: with `--verbose`, show the time taken *for each single test*, i.e. I would like

```

    EllipticCurve('900d1').integral_points()
Expecting:
    [(-11 : 27 : 1), (-4 : 34 : 1), (4 : 18 : 1), (16 : 54 : 1)]
ok [0.10s]
Trying (line 243):
    E=EllipticCurve([-879984,319138704])

Trying (line 255):
    P1=E.point((540,1188)); P2=E.point((576,1836))
Expecting nothing

It's totally okay for me to disallow `--verbose` in parallel tests.

If I do `cython('sig_on()')` at the command line nothing happens.  Is it supposed to crash Sage?

A "real" interrupt would interrupt also the master process, a fake doctest-interrupt only the child process.  That's an easy way to distinguish.

Let me elaborate: #10030 added a check to the doctesting code which checks

```
sage: sig_on_count()
0
```
after each doctest (i.e. it appends this to every doctest), to ensure there are no unbalanced `sig_on()`s.  Could you add this also to your doctesting framework?

The main point of `--serial` is that it allows you to debug problems in the doctesting framework without worrying about multiprocessing.  :-)

I'm also using it for `--gdb` since it makes the tracebacks simpler, though I'm not sure that's necessary.

Do you ever use `sage -t` with valgrind?  I'm not sure exactly what's wrong with `sage -t --valgrind <FILENAME>`.

I just tried changing the interrupt handling so that `KeyboardInterrupt` is handled in the parent process and it doesn't work as well: there's extraneous printing happening when the doctest framework thinks it's just printing an unexpected exception, and I don't see a good way to get rid of it.

I think the current handling of KeyboardInterrupts is fine.

When doing `make ptest` and `make ptestlong`, all doctests are run but there is no summary at the end.  The processes end with exit code 132 (which usually means an Illegal Instruction but probably not here).

I thought I'd solved the sporadic problem in sage.tests.interrupt by increasing the delays in `test_sig_block_outside_sig_on`: after the change I ran `sage -tp --sagenb --long devel/sage/doc/common devel/sage/doc/[a-z][a-z] devel/sage/sage` 10 times with no failures (where before there had been 5 failures in `interrupt.pyx`).

Jeroen, would you be willing to take a look at it since you wrote the tests in that file?

All the other tests pass for me, with the exception of startup.py.

Just one failure remaining related to this ticket:

```
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage/sage/doctest/control.py", line 258, in sage.doctest.control.DocTestController.add_files
Failed example:
    DC = DocTestController(DD, [])
Expected nothing
Got:
    Unable to open logfile at /release/merger/sage-5.1-12415/home/.sage//tmp/test.log
    Proceeding without logging.
sage -t devel/sage/sage/ext/gmp.pxi
    [0 tests, 0.0 s]
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of  15 in sage.doctest.control.DocTestController.add_files
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
sage -t devel/sage/sage/doctest/control.py
    [115 tests, 3.6 s]
```

But also the formatting of the above failure looks strange:

1) Why does

```
sage -t devel/sage/sage/ext/gmp.pxi
    [0 tests, 0.0 s]
```
appear in the middle of the failure?

2) Could you format the output as

```
sage -t devel/sage/sage/doctest/control.py
**********************************************************************
[...failure...]
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of  15 in sage.doctest.control.DocTestController.add_files
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
    [115 tests, 3.6 s]
```

I would even shorten the last two lines to

```
    [115 tests, 1 failed, 3.6 s]
```

And I would add a function like

```
def count_noun(number, noun):
    if number == 1:
        return "1 %s"%noun
    else:
        return "%d %ss"%(number,noun)
```
So you can do

```
print count_noun(n, 'item'), "had failures"
```

The `KeyboardInterrupt` example [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/doctest/keyboardinterrupt.py](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/doctest/keyboardinterrupt.py) still doesn't work correctly:

```
Running doctests with ID 2012-07-13-10-53-02-ed232e22.
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t /home/jdemeyer/doctest/keyboardinterrupt.py
    Unexpected KeyboardInterrupt raised in file
********************************************************************************

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1.1 seconds

    cumulative wall time: 0.0 seconds
```
The expected result is that the test passes.  I don't mind if you don't fix this (currently, it's also broken), but I thought you should know...

That's because your expected output has an extra colon.  If you delete the trailing colon it passes tests.

With the extra colon it's an unexpected `KeyboardInterrupt`.

Here's my current status on the `interrupt.pyx` problem.

* It occurs only if `interrupt.pyx` is not the first file being tested (so `sage -t rings/big_oh.py tests/interrupt.pyx` will show it for example)
* The segfault is actually caused by the test at line 694 of `interrupt.pyx`: `sage: test_sig_block()`
 
I tried looking into the signal handling code but got lost.  Any ideas?

I have no problem with that interpretation.  But in some sense it is related to the new doctesting framework since we weren't using Python's multiprocessing module before.

I think I've fixed the display hook problem.  I just ran make ptestlong and found some errors; I'm looking into them and will report back.

I'm working on some general documentation, but some help on the `annihilate` method would be useful, since I know nothing about process control groups.

There is a lot of

In fact, the whole block

try:
    if output_semaphore is not None:
        output_semaphore.acquire()
    do_something()
finally:

I vote to completely remove the `--serial` option since for me the only effect is that it makes the code more complicated. Consider for example:

```
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            if result_pipe is None:
                # We're in serial mode
                raise
            # Otherwise, we've been started by a worker: we'll return the result in the finally block
            result = 0, DictAsObject(dict(err='ctlC')), ""
[...]
        finally:
            if result_pipe is None:
                return result
            else:
                result_pipe.put(result, False)
```

If I want to fix `KeyboardInterrupt`s in doctests, I now have to think about *two* code paths instead of one.

Answering my own question, it seems that N `DocTestWorkers` are started with `make -j N`.

But I don't understand the design choice of having **two levels** of multiprocessing: one from the master process to the `DocTestWorker` and one from the `DocTestWorker` to the `DocTestTask`.

I surely need to think more about this, but I propose a redesign with only one level of multiprocessing, completely bypassing the `DocTestWorker` class. This would give the benefits of "serial" processing while still allowing parallel doctests.

Hi Jeroen,
Sorry for the slow response time: I've had a visitor here in Calgary who's leaving this evening.  I've started writing up overall documentation, and will work on it tonight.

In answer to your question about two layers of multiprocessing, the reason is to insulate the controlling process from segfaults and serious failures in the files being tested.  If we come up with a design that satisfies that goal and also allows testing with multiple processes through `sage -t -p N` I'm happy to change things.  I certainly wouldn't call myself an expert on writing multi-process code.

I'll write more this evening, and also review #14079 and #14080.

I think the word "output" is badly overused (there is the standard output, the file `output=os.tmpfile()`, the string `output` referring to the *contents* of the `output` file and `delayed_output`).

I propose to rename:
- `delayed_output` to `messages`
- `output` (the file) to `outtmpfile` (or `tmpoutfile`?)

And am I right that `delayed_output` is empty in normal mode when there are no doctest failures?

Some comments: 
* For compatibility with Python's `doctest` module, `summarize` should take `verbose` as the first argument and `msgfile` as an optional second argument.
* It's `sage.ext.pselecter` rather than `sage.ext.pselect, unless you changed #14079.
* Currently I get a timeout whenever I run tests on a file.
* Why did you disable the code that sets `following` in `_parallel_dispatch`?

Overall, I think the changes are good ones.

Fair enough. I never considered this compatibility, so it is quite possible that I introduced more incompatibilities.

> * It's `sage.ext.pselecter` rather than `sage.ext.pselect, unless you changed #14079.
 
Yes, I did change #14079 but didn't realise that I hadn't uploaded the new patch. Anyway, I am looking into the problem on OS X.

> * Currently I get a timeout whenever I run tests on a file.
 
Could be the same OS-dependent problem as the one you reported in #14079.

> * Why did you disable the code that sets `following` in `_parallel_dispatch`?
 
Simply because it is work in progress, new tests are needed. My `DocTestWorker` has a substantially different function from the old `DocTestWorker`, so I cannot recycle the tests.

I noticed a change in behaviour and I'm wondering whether it is intentional.

Old doctesting framework outputs like:

```
sage -t file.py
<messages>
         [4.1 s]
```

New doctesting framework outputs like:

```
<messages>
sage -t file.py
    [1 test, 1 failure, 1.7 s]
```

I dislike the last way of outputting, especially in `--verbose` mode, because there is no mention of what file is being tested. You see:

```
Running doctests with ID 2013-02-13-12-55-39-de348564.
Doctesting 1 file.
Trying (line 2):    cython('sig_on()')
Expecting nothing
ok [1.61 s]
...
```
"line 2" of which file?...

Adding the number of tests and number of failures was intentional (to which I assume you don't object).  The change in order is an artifact of the code that delayed printing.  When there are lots of processes running parallel, you can't output 

```
sage -t file.py
```

before starting testing, since the messages will get mixed up.  I agree that the line describing which file is being tested should come at the beginning.

OK, so you agree with

```
sage -t file.py
<messages>
    [1 test, 1 failure, 1.7 s]
```

I would move the part of `report()` which prints the "sage -t ..." header to a new function `report_start()` (for example) and then correct the logic in `forker.py` to call that function at the appropriate time. Does that sound good?

Sounds good.  Presumably it will get printed to the `msgfile` before all of the other messages and then actually printed to the screen in whatever way is appropriate.

I'm running tests on OS X 10.6.8 with sage 5.7.beta1.

* Your changes to `sage.calculus.test_sympy` break doctests on my machine: they were correct before the change.  Presumably these results are system dependent and should be changed somehow.
* I get a bad exit in sage.misc.interpreter at line 132 (in `get_test_shell()`): it prints out a bunch of help text from IPython, ending with

```
[SageTerminalApp] Bad config encountered during initialization:
[SageTerminalApp] Unrecognized flag: '--all'
```
I'm not really sure what's happening here: perhaps it's related to the IPython upgrade?
* The same thing happens in `sage.misc.sage_extension` at line 22.
* There's still an error in `sagenb.notebook.worksheet` line 196: `sagenb.notebook` has no attribute `misc`.  I've seen this before and it should be easy to fix.
* There are problems running some tests in `sage.doctest.control` that may go away with your new code.  If not I have fixes for them.

How is [attachment:12415_review.patch] coming along?

I think it works well for normal testing. I still have to think about `--debug` and things like `--gdb`.  It seems it will be necessary to have a serial mode for example for `--gdb`, so  I have to put that back in.  I would also like to force `--serial` when `--debug` is used, mainly to simplify the code.

But first I'm going to look at #14079 on OS X.

I fixed it by temporarily turning off unicode in pretting printing.  I updated the patch with this change.

Nope: applying #14070 fixed the problem.

> Good, then please fix it.

Okay, the easy fix I remembered is to add a line to sagenb.notebook.worksheet:

```
         EXAMPLES: We test the constructor via an indirect doctest::
 
             sage: nb = sagenb.notebook.notebook.Notebook(tmp_dir()+'.sagenb')
+            sage: import sagenb.notebook.misc
             sage: sagenb.notebook.misc.notebook = nb
             sage: W = nb.create_new_worksheet('Test with unicode ěščřžýáíéďĎ', 'admin')
             sage: W

```

I haven't made any changes to `sagenb` for a long time.  I assume this would require a new spkg?

> > How is [attachment:12415_review.patch] coming along?

> I think it works well for normal testing. I still have to think about `--debug` and things like `--gdb`.

Makes sense.

> I haven't made any changes to `sagenb` for a long time.  I assume this would require a new spkg?

No, sagenb is now officially a separate project. I have sent a patch to "upstream" sagenb.

New major update of my code. Now adds support for `--debug`.

I removed `SagePdb` since the motivation of the output-redirection in the Python doctesting framework seems to be doctesting `Pdb` itself, not running a debugger inside the doctesting framework. For the new doctesting framework, we just need to stop spoofing before entering the debugger and start spoofing after the debugger is finished and that's all.

I have been thinking about the encoding warnings (and encodings in doctests in general). I think there are two options:
1. either we ignore the Cython warnings and continue working with pure strings,
2. or we make the doctester completely Unicode-aware.

I don't really see any middle ground. I'm inclined to go for the first option initially, but eventually migrating to the second option *in a different ticket*.

But I'm open to opinions on this.

With these patches + the patched sagenb (https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/84), I get just one sporadic failure:

```
sage -t --long devel/sage/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py
**********************************************************************
File "devel/sage/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py", line 2188, in sage.homology.simplicial_complex.SimplicialComplex.is_cohen_macaulay

    False
Got:
    Exception OSError: (10, 'No child processes') in <generator object __call__ at 0x646f1e0> ignored
    False
**********************************************************************
```

I have not investigated, but I assume it must be some strange interaction between the `DocTestWorker` processes and the `cohen_macaulay` subprocesses.

Since `bsd.math` has been down for a while (now it is back up), I haven't been able to look into the OS X issues.

I guess the only remaining issue is `--gdb` (and `--valgrind`...) support.

What's the point of running optional tests without optional "sage" tests? Because that would badly fail with code like

```
sage: a = some_object()
sage: a.some_standard_method()
sage: a.use_mypackage()  # optional: mypackage
```
(only the last line would be executed)

Are all doctests supposed to be written like

```
sage: a = some_object()
sage: a.some_standard_method()

sage: a = some_object()  # optional: mypackage
sage: a.use_mypackage()  # optional: mypackage
```

Sorry, but I don't get it `O_o`

After this patch is applied, will all files be skipped if SAGE_ROOT contains a `/.` somewhere, even if it is not a `/.hg` ?

> Okay, good, then I suggest that we close #13928 as a duplicate of this one, or at least close #13928 when this one is merged.


Gloops. That answers my question too `:-)`

Then I will set #13928 to "positive review/duplicate", as I can safely have faith in our release manager and this patch `:-)`

It used to work and I used it at some point to deal with the nice random failures caused by the introduction of weak caches of #715.
Note the optional spkg we currently propose is really old (and surely dysfunctional on most systems), but there's an update rotting at #13060.

Here's a review patch which adds doctests for the four functions that were missing them and makes a few other minor changes.  Other than this, I'm happy with Jeroen's changes.

Could you do me a favour since I don't have access to an OS X 10.8 system:

Remove that `import readline` statement and run

```
./sage -btp N --long devel/sage/sage/doctest devel/sage/sage/tests
```
in the following ways:
1. Normal doctest run in the terminal, let it finish
2. Interrupt (CTRL-C) the tests somewhere in the middle of the run
3. Pipe the output through `less`: `./sage -tp 2 ... | less`
And all this both with `-p 1` and with `-p N` for some `N > 1`.

For [attachment:12415_test.patch], you never run some of the files in the test directory (`sig_on.rst` and `sleep_and_raise.rst`).  Otherwise they look good.

Without the `import readline` statement, I got one nonrepeatable failure with `sage -btp 2 ...` (probably has nothing to do with readline, but have you seen this before?):

With or without the `import readline` statement, I see this when piping through `less`, with `-btp 1` or `-btp 2`:

```
Installing c_lib
ESC[?1034hscons: `install' is up to date.
```

Except for the nonrepeatable failure, I see no difference with or without `import readline`.

That actually looks serious, I'll have a look.

That's before the doctester starts, so it's not our problem.

Is the `[[?1034h` control code gone when you remove `import readline`?

This patch breaks the fixdoctests script. The problem is that the strings which sage-fixdoctests searches for in order to identify the line numbers have changed with the new output implemented in the current patch. 

I have just uploaded the patch #10589 which makes ```sage -fixdoctests``` work properly with the new doctest output (as stated on the ticket for #10589, the main point of this patch is to fix some different problems with fixdoctests).

`--only-optional` was replaced by `--optional`. The old documentation was very unclear about what `--optional` and `--only-optional` did, so we basically just implemented what we could understand.
