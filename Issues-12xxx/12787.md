I already cleaned up `SPKG.txt`, `spkg-install` and `spkg-check` at #9906; this just complicates rebasing, again, as you also made some of the changes I made there, but not all of them.

FWIW, #9906, which really wasn't that hard to review, as I intentionally did *not* upgrade R or RPy there, rottens anyway...

It shouldn't be that much work to rebase, `spkg-install` and `spkg-check` aren't that big...
