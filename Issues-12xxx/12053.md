What is `reduce()` supposed to do? I don't understand that function.

This is a little alarming:

```
sage: ~R.ideal(5) * 5
Fractional ideal (5^-1) of 5-adic Field with capped relative precision 20
```

But I see fractional ideals are not implemented. Perhaps there should be a `NotImplementedError` somewhere rather than manifestly incorrect behaviour. Is this fixed in a later patch?

I agree with saraedum's comment above, but for the moment it wouldn't hurt for it to live in padics/, especially as all that code is under heavy active development at the moment.

It wouldn't hurt to add some doctests to cover some unramified and ramified extensions of Zp (I tried a few myself and everything seems to work).

Apart from these issues the patch looks good to me.
