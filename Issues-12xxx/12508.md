```
The code currently says:

```
        a = D[iter(D).next()]
        if hasattr(a,'parent') and hasattr(a.parent(),'zero'):
            zero = a.parent().zero()
        else:
            zero = 0
    for_removal = [key for key in D if D[key] == zero]
    for key in for_removal:
        del D[key]    
```
If it's robust, using `bool(x)` that is `__nonzero__` could be faster.

Depends on #12510

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

did you do some tests?

Within Sage, I get

sage: D = dict( (i,i) for i in range(100000) ) 
sage: zero = 0
sage: %timeit for_removal = [key for key in D if D[key] == zero]
25 loops, best of 3: 23.2 ms per loop
sage: %timeit for_removal = [key for key in D if D[key].__nonzero__() ]
25 loops, best of 3: 36.8 ms per loop

But calling `__nonzero__` in python is much slower than is cython, isn't it?

> did you do some tests?

Actually not Yet... However:

```
sage: D = dict( (i,i) for i in srange(100000) )
sage: zero = 0
sage: %timeit for_removal = [key for key in D if D[key] == zero]
25 loops, best of 3: 15 ms per loop
sage: %timeit for_removal = [key for key in D if D[key].__nonzero__() ]
25 loops, best of 3: 27.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit for_removal = [key for key in D if not D[key] ]
25 loops, best of 3: 8.78 ms per loop
```
Two remarks:

- Using sage integer (ie `srange`) is more realistic than python
  `int`.

- I actually meant `bool(D[key])` which calls implicitely
  `__nonzero__` in an optimized way, rather than calling explicitely it.

Of course, we still have to check how it behave in Cython.

Cheers,

Florent

If you don't know it, here is what I call by optimized way:

```
sage: class bla(object):
....:      def __nonzero__(self): 
....:           print "bla.__nonzero__ called"
....:           return True
....: 
sage: b = bla()
sage: if b: print "ok"
....: 
bla.__nonzero__ called
ok
```
But:

```
sage: b.__nonzero__ = lambda self: False
sage: if b: print "ok"
....: 
bla.__nonzero__ called
ok
```
So the lookup in `b.__dict__` is bypassed (see
[special method lookup](http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-lookup-for-new-style-classes)),
which allows for much faster non zero test than calling `__nonzero__`
explicitely. I'm pretty sure Cython optimize that too.
