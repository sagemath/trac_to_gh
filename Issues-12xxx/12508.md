```
The code currently says:

```
        a = D[iter(D).next()]
        if hasattr(a,'parent') and hasattr(a.parent(),'zero'):
            zero = a.parent().zero()
        else:
            zero = 0
    for_removal = [key for key in D if D[key] == zero]
    for key in for_removal:
        del D[key]    
```
If it's robust, using `bool(x)` that is `__nonzero__` could be faster.

Depends on #12510

did you do some tests?

Within Sage, I get

sage: D = dict( (i,i) for i in range(100000) ) 
sage: zero = 0
sage: %timeit for_removal = [key for key in D if D[key] == zero]
25 loops, best of 3: 23.2 ms per loop
sage: %timeit for_removal = [key for key in D if D[key].__nonzero__() ]
25 loops, best of 3: 36.8 ms per loop

But calling `__nonzero__` in python is much slower than is cython, isn't it?

> did you do some tests?

Actually not Yet... However:

```
sage: D = dict( (i,i) for i in srange(100000) )
sage: zero = 0
sage: %timeit for_removal = [key for key in D if D[key] == zero]
25 loops, best of 3: 15 ms per loop
sage: %timeit for_removal = [key for key in D if D[key].__nonzero__() ]
25 loops, best of 3: 27.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit for_removal = [key for key in D if not D[key] ]
25 loops, best of 3: 8.78 ms per loop
```
Two remarks:

- Using sage integer (ie `srange`) is more realistic than python
  `int`.

- I actually meant `bool(D[key])` which calls implicitely
  `__nonzero__` in an optimized way, rather than calling explicitely it.

Of course, we still have to check how it behave in Cython.

Cheers,

Florent

If you don't know it, here is what I call by optimized way:

```
sage: class bla(object):
....:      def __nonzero__(self): 
....:           print "bla.__nonzero__ called"
....:           return True
....: 
sage: b = bla()
sage: if b: print "ok"
....: 
bla.__nonzero__ called
ok
```
But:

```
sage: b.__nonzero__ = lambda self: False
sage: if b: print "ok"
....: 
bla.__nonzero__ called
ok
```
So the lookup in `b.__dict__` is bypassed (see
[special method lookup](http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-lookup-for-new-style-classes)),
which allows for much faster non zero test than calling `__nonzero__`
explicitely. I'm pretty sure Cython optimize that too.

It's Python's specification, so it definitely should return what we want. Now the best way to be sure that it does is to add it in the generic tests for object in the category `FreeModules()`. Since now, thanks to Simon all rings conform with categories, adding a test here should catch all problems.
