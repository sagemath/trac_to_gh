Here is a patch which seems to fix a number of problems with the p-adic logarithm and exponential.

They are generic functions that should work with all of current p-adic types.

We get run times about x20/x80 faster than the current implementation (in the cases where the current implementation worked).

**Apply**

OK, I messed up (and I blame for it (my inexperience with ?) mercurial queues). After some manual cherry picking I got a patch that can be applied against 5.0beta8 and passes the tests. I might have messed some of the doc formatting, if you spot any regression let me know and I'll fix it.

I will the previous (completely broken) patch with a (presumably working, now) new one.

I have modified the patch so that it works with the newer versions (the method is_unit() got changed into is_padic_unit() and that prevented the patch from apply seamelessly).

Please could someone review it? I have been using this functionality for the past six months and it works fine. They are useful functions to have and the review should be very quick...

I found several issues. I added a patch which should fix them:

* log sometimes didn't work in the capped-absolute case (especially over extension fields)
* the bound `max_term` in `_exp` was incorrect which made `exp` and `log` not inverse to each other in some cases
* the capped-absolute/fixed-mod implementation of `exp` somehow didn't get some of the digits right (I tried to find out why, but couldn't figure it out). I rewrote `_exp` which is now shorter and works in the cases that didn't work before. In particular it doesn't lift the input to the integers anymore. Is there a reason why we should work over the integers?
* I believe that the check for convergence of the exponential series was incorrect.

Apart from that, I tried to simplify the code in a few places and turned the cached values into actual `cached_methods` -- if someone dislikes that latter change, I don't mind undoing it.
