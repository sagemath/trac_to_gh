This came up as part of my review of #12043, but it's of independent interest.

The level 1 Eisenstein series can be normalized in three natural ways: so the linear coefficient is 1; so the constant term is 1; or so the coefficients are integers with no common factor. Renormalizing is no problem if you're working over QQ but over finite characteristic base rings it is a total pain (try computing E<sub>p-1</sub> mod p<sup>2</sup>).

The patch below modifies ` eisenstein_series_qexp ` so the following works:

```
sage: eisenstein_series_qexp(6, 5, normalization="constant") 
1 - 504*q - 16632*q^2 - 122976*q^3 - 532728*q^4 + O(q^5)
sage: eisenstein_series_qexp(6, 10, K=Zmod(49), normalization="constant")        
1 + 35*q + 28*q^2 + 14*q^3 + 42*q^5 + 21*q^6 + 35*q^7 + 35*q^8 + 7*q^9 + O(q^10)
```

David,

This is great.  I have run into this exact thing before and worked around it; it will be good to have it properly in Sage.

I have one minor request: would you mind including a Hasse invariant example, e.g.:

```
sage: eisenstein_series_qexp(12, 50, K=GF(13), normalization="constant")
1 + O(q^50)
```

For some reason it feels like it belongs here.

Some of these don't work on OS X 10.4 PPC (and I'm guessing all other 32-bit systems):

This isn't so much a bug in the code, as a preexisting bug in polynomials over `GF(2)` which my code has just revealed:

```
sage: R.<x> = Zmod(2)[]
sage: R([2^80]) # boom!
```
Curiously there is no problem with moduli other than 2.
