<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
On Mac I don't get an error, but it hangs and eventually consumes all resources, so fair enough!  

This patch gives

```
sage: timeit("RealField(53)(0.05).nth_root(7 * 10^8)")
625 loops, best of 3: 69.2 Âµs per loop
```

One question I have is whether this is the most appropriate test with this precision.

```
sage: RealField(53)(0.05).nth_root(7 * 10^8) 
0.999999995720382
sage: _^(7*10^8)
0.0499999991341384
```
Is that good enough?  

Otherwise this is fine, passes tests, etc. on 5.0.beta1.

It'll be difficult to get a more accurate answer with that precision.  Let's turn the last 2 into a 3:

```
sage: 0.999999995720383^(7*10^8)
0.0500000185630449
```
