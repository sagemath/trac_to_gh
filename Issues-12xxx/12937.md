On certain systems, e.g., Fedora with libreadline.so.5 systemwide, when building
sqlite, the sqlite3 binary points to libreadline.so.5.  However, Sage ships libreadline.so.6.  The fix is trivial -- just define LDFLAGS, as we always should do.  (Why we don't in ./install is beyond me...)

Obviously, `-I $SAGE_LOCAL/lib` should be `-L $SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.  This couldn't have solved any problem.
