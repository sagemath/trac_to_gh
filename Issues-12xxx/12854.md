Plotting has severely slowed down since sage-4.8.

For example the following command (inspired on a doctest from
devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py):

```
sage: timeit('''plot(sin(x),(x,0,2*pi),ticks=pi/3,tick_formatter=pi).save("/tmp/1.png")''', number=1, repeat=20)
```

It's annoying to measure this as the timing has quite a large standard
deviation.  But on boxen.math, with sage-4.8, the best case timing is
about 1 second, while with sage-5.0.beta13, the best case timing is
about 1.5 seconds.

This is due to the change in attachment:trac-11915-matplotlib-1.1.0-upgrade.patch:ticket:11915 that reads

```
figure.tight_layout() 
```
Comment it out and see the times go down.  See #11915 for the rationale behind adding this, which I will point out was not arbitrary.

So should we simply keep the `tight_layout()` and live with it?
