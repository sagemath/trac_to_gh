```

the doctest creates a directory and sets permissions to 0000. if running as root no error is thrown when accessing this directory, hence the failure of the doctest.

Proposed fix: check if running the test as root or flag example as no test

I attached a patch which fixes the error when run as root. However there is no warning about running tests as root which was suggested on sage-devel. 

Example:
WARNING: You are running doctests as root!
It is strongly advised to stop and run the tests as restricted user
Are you sure you want to continue as root (y/n)?

There was another ticket mentioned (#5155), maybe it should be implemented there?
