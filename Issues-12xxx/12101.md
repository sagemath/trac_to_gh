RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```
If I make the zero matrix instead, it cuts off at the matrix init instead, not getting into the complex and pynac stuff.

I don't know why this is the particular thing that returns.  I do know why we have an infinite recursion.

```
        from sage.symbolic.ring import SR
        return self.change_ring(SR).exp()
```
is the entire code in matrix2.pyx for the exponential method of a generic matrix.  And the doctests only test dense matrices, whose coercion to the symbolic ring have nice exp methods.  But sparse ones don't go anywhere.

```
sage: type(D)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_sparse.Matrix_generic_sparse'>
sage: C = D.change_ring(SR)
sage: type(C)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_sparse.Matrix_generic_sparse'>
```
I guess the answer would be to change this code to make sparse matrices dense?

```
sage: D.change_ring(SR).dense_matrix().exp()
[e]
```
Yup.  Patch coming up.

I don't think silently converting the sparse input matrix to a dense one is a good idea. We should define an `exp()` method for sparse symbolic matrices to avoid this infinite recursion.

Here is the code for the `exp()` method of `Matrix_symbolic_dense`:

```python
    def exp(self):
        if not self.is_square():
            raise ValueError, "exp only defined on square matrices"
        if self.nrows() == 0:
            return self
        # Maxima's matrixexp function chokes on floating point numbers
        # so we automatically convert floats to rationals by passing
        # keepfloat: false
        m = self._maxima_(maxima)
        z = maxima('matrixexp(%s), keepfloat: false'%m.name())
        if self.nrows() == 1:
            # We do the following, because Maxima stupidly exp's 1x1
            # matrices into non-matrices!
            z = maxima('matrix([%s])'%z.name())

        return z._sage_()
```

It would be great if we could avoid calling maxima for this. How hard would it be to implement what maxima does natively in Sage? Here is the code for the `matrixexp` maxima function:

http://maxima.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=maxima/maxima;a=blob;f=share/linearalgebra/matrixexp.lisp;hb=HEAD

Another option is to find a way to convert a sparse matrix to Maxima and still use its `matrixexp()` implementation. Does Maxima have a sparse matrix constructor?

Hi, this is still an issue with recent versions of sagemath (8.8).
I think it would be a good idea to implement some proper error handling to tell the user what is going on. I don't really understand the code but printing our a message like
  exp for sparse matrice is not implemented, please convert to a dense matrix using .dense_matrix()
would go a long way to make sage user friendly in this case.

Personally, I am not that interested in this, as I think the change in #28935, although not ideal, is good enough for now. I think there are more important problems to solve regarding `exp`, for example the method currently only works for very small or structured matrices, so the conversion to a dense representation is not necessarily the bottleneck:

```
sage: matrix.random(ZZ, 4).exp()   # does not terminate in a reasonable amount of time
...
sage: matrix.random(ZZ, 5).exp()   # fails
...
TypeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: Unable to find the spectrum
```
Besides, the exponential of a sparse matrix is not necessarily sparse again, although sometimes it is:

```
sage: matrix.random(ZZ, 20, density=.25, sparse=True).change_ring(RDF).exp().density()
1
```

Computing the matrix exponential symbolically seems like a difficult problem in general.
