When computing the smith form of a matrix (over a finite field) it promts an error

```python
sage: AA = matrix(Zmod(2), [[1,1],[1,0],[0,1]])
sage: AA.smith_form()
```

It promts

```

```

It seems that the "Matrix_mod" submatrix method doesn't have "ncols" and "nrows" as optional parameters (like the base Matrix class).

I used Sage 4.8.0 in an Ubuntu 12.04 (32 bits).

I'm sorry I didn't realized before, but it also was necessary to change the output in order to work properly.
(Should I open another ticket?)

Before the last patch:

```python
sage: A = matrix([[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]])
sage: B = matrix(Zmod(2), [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]])
sage: A.submatrix(2,2)
[]
sage: A.submatrix(2,2).ncols()
0
sage: A.submatrix(2,2).nrows()
1
sage: B
[]
sage: B.submatrix(2,2).ncols()
0
sage: B.submatrix(2,2).nrows()
0
```

After the patch

```python
sage: B.submatrix(2,2)
[]
sage: B.submatrix(2,2).ncols()
0
sage: B.submatrix(2,2).nrows()
1
```

With that done, the smith_form method worked with some (easy) examples.
