The upcoming patch adds a line to the output of `sage -coverageall`, with the number of untested functions.  It also fixes a plural.  Here is an example of the new output:

```

linear_code.py: 82% (52 of 63)
sd_codes.py: 20% (1 of 5)

With the exact number of untested functions we don't have to estimate `scr` by

```
scr = 0
```

```
i = y.rfind(':')
j = y.rfind('%')
scr += int(y[i+1:j]) * float(n)
```
and should use

```
scr = (total - untested) * 100
```
instead.

Also take note of #5859.
