# Issue 12268: Make a "release" directory in the sagenb repo that generates a new proper sagenb spkg

The top level of the sagenb spkg does not have an hg repository, which is very confusing since all spkg's are supposed to.  It turns out that spkg-install is autogenerated and SPKG.txt is in sagenb's own repository, i.e., in `sagenb-0.9.0/src/sagenb/SPKG.txt`.

Jason Grout and William Stein discussed this for a while and propose the following plan:

1. Create a directory `sagenb-0.9.0/src/sagenb/release/sage`
2. Put spkg-dist, SPKG.txt there, along with a small hg repo that contains SPKG.txt and spkg-install.
3. Use this new spkg-dist script to generate a proper sagenb spkg in the usual way.  However, it will copy over the hg repo created in 2, then check in spkg-install and SPKG.txt.   

The motivation for this is so that the sagenb spkg is the same as the other ones, which could be important for automated tools that make a directory of spkg's, etc.
