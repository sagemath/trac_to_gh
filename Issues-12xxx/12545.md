I (wstein) wrote code for psage that can compute p-adic L-series to low precision using the standard Riemann sums algorithm.  This is only for the good ordinary case.  The code is much faster than the existing "mostly pure python" code in Sage already.   The point of this ticket is to port this code from psage to sage proper, improve the code a lot, and make it more general (e.g., support dimension > 1).

Today I stumbled on this. The links are broken, the text is a bit cryptic. My understanding is that the plan was to improve the code for computing the p-adic L-function of an elliptic curve over Q. William had code that was faster than what was (and is) in sage now. But this was never transferred over.

In the meantime, overconvergent modular symbols were added (see #812) but the are not yet optimal either (see #20865). These were also added to pari not long ago.

Instead of trying to port old, unreachable code over, we should work on the ones above, in particular adding an interface for pari's implementation.

This ticket should be closed as "won't fix".
