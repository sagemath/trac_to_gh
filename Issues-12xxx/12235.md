Helloooooooo !!!

After three days coding a *loooot* of things that may (or may not) prove useful later, I noticed there was a quick way to fix this crazy slowness in "strongly_connected_components".

I hope I will be able to improve it a bit more later, but I noticed many importants things that need fixing while working on this patch.

NetworkX

```
sage: import networkx
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(1000,.1).networkx_graph()
sage: %timeit networkx.strongly_connected_components(g)
5 loops, best of 3: 103 ms per loop
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(1000,.1).networkx_graph()
sage: %timeit networkx.strongly_connected_components(g)
5 loops, best of 3: 102 ms per loop
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(1000,.1).networkx_graph()
sage: %timeit networkx.strongly_connected_components(g)
5 loops, best of 3: 103 ms per loop
```

Before (Sage)

```
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(1000,.1)
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
5 loops, best of 3: 186 ms per loop
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(1000,.1)
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
5 loops, best of 3: 183 ms per loop
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(1000,.1)
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
5 loops, best of 3: 184 ms per loop
```

After (Sage)

```
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(1000,.1)
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
25 loops, best of 3: 28.9 ms per loop
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(1000,.1)
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
25 loops, best of 3: 28.4 ms per loop
sage: g = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(1000,.1)
sage: %timeit g.strongly_connected_components()
25 loops, best of 3: 29.8 ms per loop
```

I also added a LONG doctests that checks the computations are correct by comparing the result with NetworkX

```

Now, there are many things left to improve in the library, but I hope this settles the SCC issue reported in

I did several experiments on various sizes of GNP graphs with various density. The results are corrects and it is faster than networkx.

Good work !
