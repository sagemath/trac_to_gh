Noticed in Sage 4.8:

```

sage: a=-17
sage: %timeit s = sign(a)  
125 loops, best of 3: 757 µs per loop
sage: %timeit s = a//abs(a) 
625 loops, best of 3: 246 ns per loop
```
thus computing `sign(a)` with `a//abs(a)` is 3000 faster!!!

Hmmm.  Well, it helps, but you still lose a lot going from something(sign) to sign(something):

```
# unpatched
sage: %timeit s = sign(2)
5 loops, best of 3: 427 µs per loop
```

```
# with .sign() using mpz_sgn
sage: %timeit s = sign(2)
625 loops, best of 3: 47.4 µs per loop
sage: %timeit s = 2.sign()
625 loops, best of 3: 352 ns per loop

```

Function calls are slow. :-/

Attached a patch to add sign() methods to QQ and ZZ. The sign(x) function is still really slow because

```
sage: sign.__call__??
    def __call__(self, *args, coerce=True, hold=False):
        """
        Evaluates this function at the given arguments.
        
        We coerce the arguments into symbolic expressions if coerce=True, then
        call the Pynac evaluation method, which in turn passes the arguments to
        a custom automatic evaluation method if ``_eval_()`` is defined.
```

in other words, it creates SR(x) and a ginac representation of the call before finally calling x.sign(). Ugh, I've filed #13933.

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
Robert, thanks, I see a speedup of a factor of more than 10 on my example:

```
sage: a=-17
sage: %timeit s = sign(a)  
625 loops, best of 3: 41 µs per loop
sage: %timeit s = a//abs(a) 
625 loops, best of 3: 257 ns per loop
```

However I wonder about the need of the "pool" cache for integers in [-5,100], since the speedup is "only" about 20%:

```
sage: a=100                 
sage: %timeit s = sign(a)   
625 loops, best of 3: 34.7 µs per loop
sage: a=101                 
sage: %timeit s = sign(a)   
625 loops, best of 3: 41.5 µs per loop
```
