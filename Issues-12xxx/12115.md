```
The recent MPIR versions can only be built shared OR static on Cygwin, not both.
Moreover, MPIR configure scripts gets confused if Cygwin, which is only 32 bits, is ran on a 64 bits Windows.

Hence the following spkg sets ABI=32 (to tackle the second problem) and only builds a shared version of the library (to tackle the first one).

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/mpir-2.4.0.p7.spkg

Updated spkg based on this one at #13137.
Please use the one there.

However, given that this has something to do with yasm, perhaps the new yasm would fix it?  Or is this something that would be fixed by rebasing?  (I don't see anything about forking, but I don't know how to interpret assembler (!) messages.)

this is a typical assembler error (something to do with the misconfiguration/mismatch of commands for particular hardware).
Nothing to do with Cygwin per se. Hopefully can be fixed by yasm upgrade.

Updated spkg based on mpir-2.4.0.p6 available at
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/mpir-2.4.0.p7.spkg

This chooses to build the shared library only and sets ABI=32 on Cygwin.

Attachment: **[spkg.diff.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12115/spkg.diff.gz)**

On my Cygwin, the new spkg hangs on 

```
Checking what CFLAGS MPIR would use if they were empty...
```
This might have to do with the fact that my 32-bit Win 7 is run in a VMWare VM, rather than being a "real" iron, but this is certainly 
not good, one way or another.

Any ideas what can be tried to see what's wrong? 

EDIT: perhaps I was not patient enough. I tried doing `../../sage -f mpir-2.4.0.p7.spkg` and it this part worked OK, although I waited 30 minutes or so.

moreover the spkg runs it a first time redirecting its output to some file to get the default flags...
