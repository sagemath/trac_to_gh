Reported (in slightly different form) on [ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/964/lenlist-ceillog42-bugs):

```
sage: %timeit floor(log(3)/log(2))
625 loops, best of 3: 586 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit floor(log(4)/log(2))
5 loops, best of 3: 3.79 s per loop
```

This happens because ceil and floor first try to increase the precision of a coercion of the input argument to a `RealInterval` by 100 bits from 53 to 20000 before finally trying a full_simplify, which succeeds.  The `RealInterval` rounds all fail because the interval is always of the form (2 - epsilon, 2 + epsilon) and endpoints have different ceilings.

With the branch applied `math.floor` and `numpy.floor` are used directly

```
sage: floor(1.2r)
1.0
sage: type(_)
<type 'float'>
```
which is distinct from the current Sage behavior

```
sage: floor(1.2r)
1
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

I'm not sure if this should go to this ticket, but the following never returns:

```
sage: z
(11/9*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2) + 3)^(1/3) + 1/3/(11/9*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2) + 3)^(1/3) - 1
sage: floor(z)

Even `floor(z, maximum_bits=53)` loops infinitely.
Should I open a separate ticket?

Whereas the following actually works

```
sage: bool(z == 1)
True
```

> Should I open a separate ticket?

I think that "very slow" includes "infinite amount of time". For me it is worth it to also fix this kind of endless loops in this ticket.

That is not a problem. Tickets can have different status: `closed`, `positive_review`, `needs_review`, `needs_work`, `new`. If there is no branch associated to a ticket it makes no sense to keep it into "needs review" state. (I already changed it to needs_work)

Indeed, your code was good... and there is a bug somewhere else in the conversion from `SR` to the real interval fields:

```
sage: RealIntervalField(256)(SR(10^50 + 10^(-50))).is_int()
(True, 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
```

Sorry, I was wrong. The method `is_int` is **not** intended to test if the interval is actually restricted to one integer! It only tests if the interval contains only one integer.

I pushed a tiny fix because we currently have

```
sage: log(8) / log(2) == 3
False
```

You mean that there is no way to check that `expr1 == expr2`? I do not want to copy/paste anything from other place. If testing equality is not available, there is a big problem.

Using `cmp` for that purpose is a bad idea. The purpose of `cmp` in Python 2 is to sort things out. Not to compare.

I'd say it probably is a bug. As to whether you should file a bug report, I don't knowâI doubt anyone really reads them, and the issue is probably already covered somewhere in the myriad of known bugs with comparisons...

Hi Vincent,

Sorry for my unclear comments above, I didn't look closely enough at your code before posting them.

Beside the issue with comparisons raised by Ralf, I find the code on your branch a bit complicated, and I don't like the fact that you drop the `maximum_bits` parameters at the risk of looping forever if you cannot prove that the input is an integer. I pushed to `u/mmezzarobba/12121-ceil` a rough attempt to fix these issues (in the case of `ceil` only at the moment, and not well tested yet), please tell me what you think of it.

an `assert` does not cost anything. And `unique_integer` silently fails if the interval does not enclose a unique integer.

> * is it really better to have an absolute bound for the diameter that makes us suspect we found an exact integer, rather than something that depends on the precision?

the precision of what? there is the field used for the evaluation which is different from the diameter of the interval. If you have more than one integer in your interval which one are you using to test equality?

> * why do you insist on using `==` on symbolic expressions instead of `is_trivial_zero()`?

Because I want to check equality with an integer. Not if it is a trivial equality.

> * are you sure you want to raise an error when `maximum_bits` does not suffice to conclude? this is a symbolic function that may be buried deep in the middle of a symbolic expression; returning unevaluated seems more reasonable to me...

Done with an example.

> * do we really need two loops that do essentially the same thing (including raising errors with the exact same message)?

The equality test is potentially costly. And we want to avoid it as much as possible. In particular, it makes no sense to test this equality within each step of the loop as it is in your version. On a related note, I noticed that for `round` you need to test equality with elements of `ZZ + 1/2`.

The precision of the interval computation, i.e. `bits`. The idea being that if we found an interval of width (say) 2â»Â²â° containing an integer by computing with 1000 bits of precision, we may want to see if the width of the interval keeps decreasing when the precision increases and only run the symbolic part of the algorithm if that's the case. But I agree that this is a very minor issue at best.

I mean using `is_trivial_zero()` after calling `full_simplify()` & co, as in my version: this is safer than relying on `==` and essentially as powerful.

Yesâas I said, my version was just a rough sketch of the changes I'd b tempted to make, nothing finished. As the code I was starting with used to loop forever in the typical situation where mine would do the symbolic test repeatedly (that is, `x` â â¤ integer but we don't manage to prove it), I thought the additional cost would be acceptable. `;-)` But anyway, it is not hard to do the test only once while avoiding the code duplication.

> On a related note, I noticed that for `round` you need to test equality with elements of `ZZ + 1/2`. 

Couldn't you just compute ceil(x-1/2)?

---

Now for some comments on the current code:

* To summarize the above, I still think the main logic in `incremental_rounding()` could be shortened to something like (not tested):

```
    unique_rounding = getattr(RealIntervalFieldElement, 'unique_' + mode)
    r = RR.one() >> 20

    bits = 64
    candidate = None
    while bits < maximum_bits:
        interval = RealIntervalField(bits)(x) # may raise a TypeError
        try:
            return unique_rounding(interval)
        except ValueError:
            pass
        if candidate is None and interval.absolute_diameter() > r:
            candidate = interval.unique_integer()
            try:
                delta = x - candidate
                if (delta.is_zero()
                        or SR(delta).full_simplify().canonicalize_radical()
                                    .is_trivial_zero()
                        or QQbar(delta).is_zero()):
                    return candidate
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    pass
        bits *= 2
```

* I'd also make `incremental_rounding()` private and dispense with the argument checking (and perhaps move it to `real_mpfi` if your plan is to use it from elsewhere)âbut I'm okay with keeping it as it is. An advantage of making it private is that you could take the âunique roundingâ function on intervals as input instead of accessing it via `getattr()`. Another option would be to introduce a common base class for `Function_floor`, `Function_ceil` and `Function_round`.

* I'm a little uneasy about the changes you made to `BuiltinFunction.__call__()`. The fact that it used to convert non-Element inputs to Elements looks intentional and pretty reasonable to me. Is it really necessary to change that behavior? That being said, I'm a bit lost in the maze of `Function.__call__`, `BuiltinFunction.__call__`, `_eval_`, `_evalf_`, `_evalf_try_` and friends, so if you tell me you are confident that the change is correct I'll trust you!

* If these changes stay, then I guess this

```
if module is not None:
    func = getattr(module, self._name, None)
    if func is None and self._alt_name is not None:
        func = getattr(module, self._name, None)
                                    ^^^^^
```
  should be `_alt_name`.

* Note that these changes also make

```
sage: sin(numpy.int32(0))
0.0
```
  which is at odds with

```
sage: sin(ZZ(0)).parent()
Integer Ring
```
  (perhaps not ideal, but predictable at least).

* In `Function_*`, what is the point of calling `_evalf_()` from `_eval_()`?

* And why isn't the logic for choosing `maximum_bits` in `_evalf_()` the same in `floor`, `ceil` and `round`?

* I wouldn't bother with checking that `x` is not a relation. First, `_eval_()` methods of individual functions are probably not the right place for that (either `BuiltinFunction.__call__()` or perhaps methods `ceil()`, `floor()` etc. in a future subclass `RelationalExpression` of `Expression` would be more reasonable). Besides, various other nonsensical inputs (e.g. series, booleans) are accepted without error, so it is a bit strange to have an ad hoc check dealing with this one.

I may be mistaken but actually `_eval_` calls `_evalf_` here which is a completely different matter.

 This happens because ceil and floor first try to increase the precision of a coercion of the input argument to a `RealInterval` by 100 bits from 53 to 20000 before finally trying a full_simplify, which succeeds.  The `RealInterval` rounds all fail because the interval is always of the form (2 - epsilon, 2 + epsilon) and endpoints have different ceilings.
-
-The proposal is to:
-- first found an interval of reasonably small diameter (arbitrarily set to 2<sup>-30</sup>) and see whether this is enough to decide the ceiling
-- then check equality with the only available candidate (possibly doing some simplification)
-- start further refinement of the interval
 
 With the branch applied `math.floor` and `numpy.floor` are used directly

Rebased on the last beta (which includes #21216).

I slightly modified `incremental_rounding`. The simplification part is implemented outside. As soon as there is a reliable `is_zero` available for elements of SR (as it is the case for `QQbar` with `is_zero`) we could make it cleaner.

Hi Vincent,

Sorry for taking so long to reply once again. The code is starting to look really good to me overall, but calling the buggy `is_zero()` causes regressions such as:

```
sage: foo = sin(1 + 10^(-30)) - sin(1)
sage: ceil(foo)
0
sage: floor(foo)
0
```
I know we already talked about that above, but are you sure you don't want `incremental_rounding()` to use `is_trivial_zero()` (probably after some simplification) instead?

Ralf, what do you call the "symbolic property" of `frac`?

On the other hand I have comments about the previous code of `frac`
- it is the role of the function `floor` to call the method `floor` if needed. There is no need to redo it now and then
- special casing `int` and `float` when the generic `x - floor(x)` does work is weird (not mentioning that this was not tested). In this case I would prefer that it behaves like floor and ceil (ie frac(float) returning float). The previous version returned Sage integer, why is that?

I let the `frac(x + y)` not be transformed in `x + y - floor(x + y)` in my new last commit. Please tell me if you like it better.

For me unreliable was "sometimes there are false negative". But it is not only that as there are "false positive". Meaning that

```
def is_zero(x):
    return randint(0, 1)
```
is equally good.

That it can be part of expressions. In the first version of your "fix frac" commit you unconditionally expanded `frac(...)` and forced the user to use `hold=True` to get the symbolic `frac()`.

> I let the `frac(x + y)` not be transformed in `x + y - floor(x + y)` in my new last commit. Please tell me if you like it better.

I do!

In #16397 I implemented this already in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/comparison.pyx#L291 to have some code usable for `__nonzero__` later.

A minor suggestion: perhaps make `rounding()` to `_rounding()`?

Also, I'm not sure how bad the existing implementation of `floor()` and friends is, but unless it is really terrible, I'd prefer to either avoid relying on `is_zero()` (even with known bugs marked as such) or to have `is_zero()` fixed before merging this ticket.

I think I don't follow you, sorry. The code you link to looks like it is intended to sort expressions for printing etc., not to provide reliable mathematical results, isn't it? Besides (but this is starting to be off-topic for this ticket), I'm tempted to think that, for non-relational expressions at least, `__nonzero__()` should simply be the negation of `is_trivial_zero()`.
