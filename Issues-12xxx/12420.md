Running sage-4.8 shows the banner as sage-4.7.2.

One option is to furtively change the tarball on the website with the correct banner file :)

The other option is to make the jump to 5.0 when the time comes.

i think this is a frivolous ticket. I downloaded another sage-4.8 some other time and it shows up the version correctly. Not sure how the first download turned out to have the wrong banner.

Are you sure the problem was with the banner?  I guess that you simply ran a different version of Sage on your computer, or somehow mixed up different Sage versions on your machine.

Thanks for closing the ticket.
