Running sage-4.8 shows the banner as sage-4.7.2.

The other option is to make the jump to 5.0 when the time comes.

i think this is a frivolous ticket. I downloaded another sage-4.8 some other time and it shows up the version correctly. Not sure how the first download turned out to have the wrong banner.
