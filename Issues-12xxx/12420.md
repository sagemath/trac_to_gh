Running sage-4.8 shows the banner as sage-4.7.2.

The other option is to make the jump to 5.0 when the time comes.

Are you sure the problem was with the banner?  I guess that you simply ran a different version of Sage on your computer, or somehow mixed up different Sage versions on your machine.

Thanks for closing the ticket.
