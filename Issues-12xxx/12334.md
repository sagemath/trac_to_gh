Looking at the optional tests of the Lie package, shows many that aren't properly marked with "requires LiE" (and many are):

```
sage: search_src('optional', 'lie')
...
interfaces/lie.py:359:            sage: lie._read_info_files(use_disk_cache=False) #optional -- requires LiE
interfaces/lie.py:360:            sage: lie._trait_names_list #optional
interfaces/lie.py:504:            sage: lie.trait_names() #optional -- requires LiE
interfaces/lie.py:521:            sage: lie._an_element_impl() #optional -- requires LiE
interfaces/lie.py:533:            sage: lie.read(filename)  #optional -- requires LiE
interfaces/lie.py:534:            sage: lie.get('x')        #optional
```

The point of this ticket is to make them all be marked "#optional -- requires LiE".  Pretty easy.  

I think this ticket should get a positive review even if 

```
  sage -t -only_optional=LiE lie.py
```
doesn't pass.  Fixing any failures in the lie interface (if there are any) should be a separate ticket.
