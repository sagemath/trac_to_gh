The following is Sage-specific code in cvxopt's `setup.py`:

```
if os.popen('sage_fortran --version').read()[:3]=='G95':
    libraries = ['m','lapack','gsl','gslcblas','blas','f95']
    GCC_LIB_DIR=SAGE_LIB
    if os.path.exists(GCC_LIB_DIR + "/gcc-lib"):
       GCC_LIB_DIR += "/gcc-lib/"
       GCC_LIB_DIR += os.listdir(GCC_LIB_DIR)[0] + "/"
       GCC_LIB_DIR += os.listdir(GCC_LIB_DIR)[0] + "/"
    libdirs = [ATLAS_LIB_DIR,GCC_LIB_DIR]
elif os.environ['UNAME'] == 'CYGWIN':
    libraries = ['lapack','gsl','gslcblas','blas', 'gfortran']
else:
    libraries = ['m','lapack','gsl','blas','gslcblas','cblas','gfortran','atlas']
```

At the end, `cblas` and `atlas` are added, even though they aren't installed on Darwin.  This causes a build failure for cvxopt on OS X 10.4 with #12369 (without #12369, the first "if" evaluates to True).

In this ticket, I also fixed the "spkg-check" script, which will now actually fail if there is a failure.

In spkg-install, these lines should be removed:

```
# Solaris-specific and other patches
cp -p patches/cvxopt.h src/src/C/

# patch to use always use GSL's random
cp -p patches/__init__.py src/src/python/

# setting Sage-specific libraries locations, etc.
cp -p patches/setup.py src/src/
```
since they are taken care of by patch.

Am I correct in saying that this was caused by Darwin being determined by the presence of G95, which is no longer the right way to do this (or perhaps it never was --- mea culpa then...) ?

Regarding the failures of tests on OSX 10.7 (see #12011): it would be great if the exact Sage version (gcc/clang?) /Xcode version/hardware state (32 vs 64 bits) on these are reported. As it looks at the moment, that there is a bug in Apple-supplied

In my experience, the tests fail on every OS X 10.7 machine I've tried, with Xcode 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, with both gcc and clang.

That would be unfortunate. I also wonder why we don't see doctest failures elsewhere in Sage if there are bugs in these libraries.

here is a beautiful OSX 10.7-specific bug (got it on sqrt5 with Sage 5.0.beta6):
(the syntax const-M, for M a matrix, is supposed to replace each M_ij with const-M_ij)

```
from cvxopt import matrix
b=matrix([ 1.00e+00, 1.63e-01, 2.83e-01, 9.47e-01, 2.32e-01, 4.85e-01,
9.57e-01, 7.44e-01])
c=1.-b
print "b :\n", b
print "1-b:\n", c


b :
[ 1.00e+00]
[ 1.63e-01]
[ 2.83e-01]
[ 9.47e-01]
[ 2.32e-01]
[ 4.85e-01]
[ 9.57e-01]
[ 7.44e-01]

1-b:
[-1.00e+00]
[-1.63e-01]
[-2.83e-01]
[-9.47e-01]
[-2.32e-01]
[-4.85e-01]
[-9.57e-01]
[-7.44e-01]
```

Interestingly, a shorter vector b works OK...

Do you have any idea what goes wrong here?
(this is actually the bug responsible for failure of "acent" test in [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/cvxopt-1.1.3.log))

In fact, it turns out to be a CVXOPT bug. Please see this
[message](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/f1XvpcK0KxE/oSFsKrA7MfkJ) and this [discussion](https://discussions.apple.com/message/17795537))

So we do not need Atlas on OSX 10.7, after all (or at least not yet).

Can we link cvxopt against Apple's cblas (aka "-framework Accelerate") on MacOSX?
I suppose inclusion of gslcblas in the list of libaries means we use this very slow beast...

Are you sure?  If we're not using Apple's BLAS, how do you explain that cvxopt fails its self-tests only on OS X 10.7?

Anyway: let me also clarify that I'm simply restoring the old behaviour, such that `cvxopt` builds with GCC 4.6.2.  So if there really is something to be done, I prefer to get this ticket reviewed as-is and continue on a different ticket.

`-lblas` links against Apple's "classical" BLAS (which you call with Fortran conventions), and use names ending with '_'. And 
that's how CVXOPT makes these fateful calls to daxpy(). 

Actually, it occurs to me now that it's GSL extension of CVXOPT that needs its GSLCBLAS, nothing else.
Sorry for noise. Please disregard my request on this.

Positive review. 
I'd like to coordinate the upgrade to (now available) cvxopt 1.1.4 with them fixing the OSX 10.7-specific bug.
