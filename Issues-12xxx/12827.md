Currently the `Animation` class only animates `Graphics` objects, and throws an error for `Graphics3d`, `GraphicsArray`, and `Tachyon` objects.  The behavior of this class should be improved to accept any Sage object whose `save` method produces an image.

See this [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/9TzVOj70ADU) thread for the beginning of this discussion, including some discussion of possible solutions.

A first patch is up now, which makes the type-checking of the Animate class more inclusive.  However I am now leaning toward a different idea:  adding an `img()` method to each of the major graphics classes defined as follows:

```
def img(self, *args, **kwds):
    return self.save(*args, **kwds)
```

Then for the Animation class, or other situations where an image representation of an object is required, one would call the `img()` method, and reject the object if it has no such method.  To handle new object types, one would implement an `img()` method for those types.  As I understand them, this is more closely aligned with the principles of object-oriented programming, and thus more appropriate for Sage library code.

I would appreciate hearing further thoughts on the relative merits of the current patch v.s. the `img()` method idea, as well as thoughts on naming this method (other suggestions are `save_as_bitmap()` and `render_image()`).  Maybe the name should be prefixed or suffixed with an underscore too?

OK, I'm afraid the following if a bit of distraction of your core goal.
Without reading any documentation, I would expect G.img() to return an "image object", rather than the G.save_as_bitmap("filename"). Of course save_as_bitmap still needs to be told in what format the bitmap should be saved.

I'm not sure we have an appropriate "image object". We do have PIL in sage. Try `import Image`. Would it make sense to interface with their types for an "img" return value?

Obviously, having a "convert to bitmap object" protocol implemented for all graphics-type objects, together with a save-to-file option on the bitmap object, would give you the required infrastructure to produce animations. It may not be the most efficient (or even sufficiently efficient) way of doing it, though ...

I can understand if you don't want to mess with bitmap objects (whatever they should be) and just settle for a way to dump a bitmap representation of objects into a file. However, you might not want to use "img" then, reserving that word for when someone does want to do that.

Hmm, yes I see your point.  Thanks for the tip about PIL -- that package does seem to provide a pretty good `Image` object, which is created by reading an image.  So one might do something like the following:

```
def img(self, filename, *args, **kwds):
    self.save(filename=filename, *args, **kwds)
    from PIL import Image
    im = Image.open(filename)
    return im
```

Maybe this is the wrong way to go about it though, since the `save()` and `show()` methods of the resulting `Image` object would re-save the image to a file, wasting a lot of time.  `Image` also has the capability to read an image from a stream or a buffer, but I don't know how to create such things from Sage's graphics objects.

On the other hand, the current `show()` method of Sage's graphics objects saves the image to a file before showing it, so this implementation would be following that precedent.

A more rudimentary compromise might be to have a method which saves the image and returns the system path to the image:

```
def img(self, filename, *args, **kwds):
    self.save(filename=filename, *args, **kwds)
    return filename
```


At this stage, I've given three different possible `img` methods, and I can see now how each one establishes a different protocol.  Since this ticket is probably not the right place to try to establish a protocol, I think I'll try to use a different name.  I'm really having a hard time warming up to the term "bitmap" though.

My take on this is that G.image() should return an image object.  I haven't looked at PIL, but I would expect an image object to have a publicly accessible .type value that tells the image type and a .data or .imgdata that contains the binary representation of the image.  I would suggest that we want graphics objects to have two routines G.image(type =XXX, height=XXX, width=XXX, **kwds) and G.save_image(type=XXX, filename=XXX, height=XXX, width=XXX, **kwds).  I suppose the height and width could have default values.  G.save_image should return a success value, but raise an exception on failure.

The new branch is ready for review!  It rebases the previous patch to sage 5.13.beta4.  It includes other minor improvements to documentation and internal methods.

With this patch, the `Animate` class can create an animation from any iterable of objects which have a `save_image` method.  Such a method is added to several of the base classes for different graphics types: `sage.plot.graphics.Graphics`, `sage.plot.graphics.GraphicsArray`, `sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3d`, `sage.plot.plot3d.tachyon.Tachyon`.

Attached some animated gifs to show what the new patch can do.  Code is below.  It's also worth mentioning that this patch fixes some doctest errors in the `Animation.ffmpeg()` method.  These are caused by a change in the way `tmp_filename` works, and the way file extensions are handled ('.gif' v.s. 'gif') elsewhere in sage.  These bugs cause `animate` to break when `convert` is not available but `ffmpeg` is (e.g. on the sage cell servers).

Examples that this patch makes possible:

Animate graphics arrays show accumulation of area under a curve.

```
f(x) = 8*(x-4)^2 - 25
F(x) = f.integrate(x)
a,b = 0,7
M = max((_.find_local_maximum(a,b)[0] for _ in (f,F)))
m = min((_.find_local_minimum(a,b)[0] for _ in (f,F)))
bounding_pts = point([(a,0),(b,0),(0,m),(0,M)],color='black')

def fplot(t):
    return plot(f,a,a + t*(b-a),fill=True) + plot(f,a,b) + \
        line([(a + t*(b-a),0),(a + t*(b-a),f(a + t*(b-a)))],thickness=2) + bounding_pts

def Fplot(t):
    return plot(F,a,a + t*(b-a),color='green') + \
        point((a + t*(b-a),F(a + t*(b-a))),color='green',size=15) + bounding_pts

accumulation = animate((graphics_array([fplot(t),Fplot(t)]) for t in sxrange(.01,1,.05)))
accumulation.show()
```

Animate parametric surfaces and curves to draw a torus knot.

```
var('u,v');
a,b = 2,1 # outer and inner radii
x = (a + b*cos(u))*cos(v)
y = (a + b*cos(u))*sin(v)
z = b*sin(u)
T = parametric_plot3d([x,y,z], (u,0,2*pi),(v,0,2*pi), opacity=.6,aspect_ratio=1) 

var('t');
c = (2*t,3*t)
s = [_.subs(dict(zip((u,v),c))) for _ in (x,y,z)]
curve = lambda d: parametric_plot(s,(t,0,2*pi*d),color='red',thickness=2,plot_points=400)

K = animate((T+curve(d) for d in sxrange(.01,1.1,.05)))
K.show()
```

Animate Tachyon scenes to show the twisted cubic.

```
def tw_cubic(t):
    q = Tachyon(camera_center=(-2,3,1),xres=500,yres=500)
    q.light((1,1,11), 1,(1,0,1))
    q.light((1,5,1), .5,(0,1,1))
    q.texture('mirror', ambient=0.05, diffuse=0.05, specular=.9, opacity=0.9, color=(.8,.8,.8))
    q.texture('w',color=(1,1,1))
    q.plane((0,0,-2),(0,0,1),'w')
    q.plane((0,-2,0),(0,1,0),'w')
    for i in srange(-1,t,0.05):
        q.sphere((i,i^2-0.5,i^3), 0.1, 'mirror')
    return q

W = animate([tw_cubic(t) for t in srange(-1,1.5,.1)])
W.show()
```

First, overall it looks pretty good to me.

Second, a typo: on the third line of `animate.py`, "iteratable" should be "iterable".

Third, I'm having problems with ffmpeg; this is on OS X 10.9. To try to fix them, I installed the latest version (from the git repo) of ffmpeg, but the problems persist.

- the `-loop_output` flag leads to the error `Unrecognized option 'loop_output'.` The man page says 

```
       -loop_output number_of_times
           Repeatedly loop output for formats that support looping such as
           animated GIF (0 will loop the output infinitely).  This option is
           deprecated, use -loop.
```
 Of course, the man page doesn't say anything at all about `-loop` so I don't know exactly how to use it, but just changing `-loop_output` to `-loop` produces a valid animated file. (I also don't know how long the `-loop` option has been available, so if we switch to that, will we just be breaking old versions of ffmpeg, or will it affect fairly recent ones?)

- the `-g 3` option leads to `Codec AVOption g (set the group of picture (GOP) size) specified for input file #0 (/Users/palmieri/.sage/temp/Macintosh-001b639d44a1.local/67838/dir_lolwRD/%08d.png) is not a decoding option.` Removing this option completely works. (I also can't find it in the man page, so I don't know what it's supposed to do. The man page is really not very good.)

hmmm, these are frustrating problems although it sounds like they exist independently of this patch.  I'll have to look into them tomorrow.

Perhaps we could check the ffmpeg version and raise an error if it's too old.

It seems that this change occurred in summer 2011, appearing in ffmpeg version 0.9 -- here's the [commit on github](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/f5302e5dcf6572e9424d51d152bffc570cd75ce6).  I'm not sure of the best course, but the ffmpeg developers didn't make the change backward-compatible so I'm inclined to do the same and blame them.  Checking the ffmpeg version is annoying because it can be a number like `1.2.2` or a string like `git-2013-06-29-53fd1ab`.  Who knows if there are yet other ways that ffmpeg reports its version.  My current best idea is to just add a note about version 0.9 or higher in the documentation -- I'll do that in the next commit.

> - the `-g 3` option 


I get no error with or without this option on my ffmpeg version (A), but do get the error with this option on version (B).  After some googling, it seems that this option controls the number of frames between keyframes, which is useful to adjust for streaming video.  Seems like this is not important enough to include as a default setting in sage, so I've dropped it in the previous commit.

> - the `-pix_fmt rgb24` option 


Note that this option is applied by sage only for gifs.  For my version (A), I have no warning message at all.  For (B) I have a similar warning message to yours, but it says "auto-selecting format 'rgb8'".  The ffmpeg documentation (for what it's worth) says that ffmpeg will automatically choose a new value if the given one is not available (implying that it will not raise an error, only a warning).

Importantly, my version (A), but not (B), raises an error if this value is not set.  It seemed like the best course of action would add this as an argument to `Animate.ffmpeg` so that it can have a reasonable default value but be easily adjusted depending on the installation.  I've done this in the previous commit.

> - the gif file produced by ffmpeg


The examples I produce with version (A) look pretty good to me, but the ones produced with (B) are bad as you describe (the rotating ellipses example is worse; parts of the ellipses change color and disappear as they rotate).  I don't know what to do about this though.  Increasing the thickness of the plotted curves helped substantially, but the output was still not great.  It's possible there are some ffmpeg options which could improve things, but I haven't been able to find them.

I had a better idea while working on this:  the user can set `iterations=None` and/or `pix_fmt=None` to stop sage from doing anything at all with these options.  Then they can be set to whatever the user wants with `ffmpeg_options`.  In this way, we support recent (as of summer 2011) versions of ffmpeg by default, but allow motivated people to work with an older version.  If pix_fmt somehow causes trouble in a way I don't foresee, it can be disabled too.

The previous commit passes all (optional=sage,ffmpeg) tests in `animate.py` with both of my ffmpeg installations.
