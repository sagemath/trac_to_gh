The contents of the prereq tarball are currently not under revision control.  Fix this.  Only non-automatically generated files are put under revision control, these are:

```
C .hgignore
C .hgtags
C Makefile.am
C configure.ac
C m4/ax_c_check_flag.m4
C m4/ax_gcc_option.m4
C m4/ax_gcc_version.m4
C m4/ax_gxx_option.m4
C m4/ax_gxx_version.m4
C m4/ax_prog_perl_version.m4
```

Further changes:

1. In `configure.ac`, comment `AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config.h])` as we don't need this header.

2. Remove some unneeded files, in particular the `autom4te.cache` directory.

3. Compress the `prereq` tarball using gzip.  Note that gzip has always been a dependency of Sage, since the `bzip2` package is gzip-compressed.

**Apply** [attachment:12739_prereq_tar_gz.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12739/12739_prereq_tar_gz.patch) to the `SAGE_ROOT` repository

**Delete** the old `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/prereq-0.9.tar`

**Download** [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/prereq-0.9.tar.gz](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/prereq-0.9.tar.gz) to `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base`
