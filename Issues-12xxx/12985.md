Yes, and if the ecl is built without unicode support, it should be a minor overhead noop, as it would attempt to convert a base string to a base string :-)
There are some comments from Juan at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3526370&group_id=30035&atid=398053 that may be of interest, about possible issues with unprotected lisp objects.

Juan's of course right in being concerned that objects are protected against garbage collection while alive. As far as I know, Boehm does watch the C stack for pointers, so a local variable pointing to the string should protect it against garbage collection while in scope.

I'm pretty sure that every `ecl_base_string_pointer_safe` occurs in a context where a python string object is required. Cython injects a `PyBytes_FromString` for that, which copies the content into a Python allocated object. The ECL-managed object is thus extremely short lived and during its life, is referenced by a local C variable (i.e., is referenced on the C stack). Boehm is supposed to watch the C stack for references, so it is protected against GC during its life.

If the reference returned by `ecl_base_string_pointer_safe` were to be stored in, say, a malloc'd location (or Python managed memory) such protection is no longer guaranteed. This is why `EclObject.set_obj` makes the little `remove_node`/`insert_node_after` dance, which ensures that a reference to the underlying ecl-object is stored within memory watched by Boehm-GC.

**EDIT**: Actually, I see what Juan is worried about: `ecl_base_string_pointer_safe` is a pointer to the string *content*, not the ecl string object. So yes, explicitly assigning the result of `cl_write_to_string` to a local variable, as he suggests, is probably a good idea.

The whole unicode problem would of course be much more elegantly solved by directly converting ecl unicode strings to python unicode strings and back. Given our use of ecl (maxima), there would be very little actual gain from doing so.

    RuntimeError: ECL says: Console interrupt

Condition of type: SIMPLE-TYPE-ERROR
In function MAKE-FOREIGN-DATA-FROM-ARRAY, the value of argument is
        "Console interrupt."
which is not of expected type BASE-STRING
Available restarts:

1. (USE-VALUE) Supply a new value of type BASE-STRING.

and it stays at that prompt until I interrupt it.

I cannot test it right now as I am still fighting to get a lot of packages updated in fedora, but will try to switch from sage-5.0.1 to 5.1.beta as soon as possible. The failure could be the requirement of some extra patch, or, the "interrupt after delay" may need some kind of "non interrruptible" code block when making the conversion.

But the error message appears to tell it somehow got a t_string where a t_base_string was expected, so, probably the ecl-unicode patch needs to be extended for 5.1.beta6.

Hopefully, `sage/libs/ecl.pxd` diff from 5.1.beta6 to 5.0.1 will show where the probem is, or, a new test case is triggering some unexpected condition.

Isn't this just a case of missed conversions? On line 256 we have

```
    if ecl_nvalues > 1:
        raise RuntimeError, "ECL says: "+ecl_base_string_pointer_safe(ecl_values(1))
    else:
        return ecl_values(0)
```
(this occurs in `ecl_safe_eval`, `ecl_safe_funcall`, `ecl_safe_apply`) and none of the patches here seem to touch that line. The second value will be ECL's error string, which is probably a unicode string if ECL uses unicode. Two solutions:

* Change the definitions of the LISP routines `sage-safe-eval` and friend (line 212 and further) to already convert the error message to base_string, e.g.:

```
        (defun sage-safe-eval (form)
            (handler-case
                (values (eval form))
                (serious-condition (cnd)
                    (values nil (si:coerce-to-base-string (princ-to-string cnd))))))
```
I don't think in this case we need to store the reference to `ecl_values(1)`, because the value itself is in a "last value returned" buffer by ecl and all we're doing is reaching into it to get a string pointer and copy it into a python string. No opportunity for ecl to invalidate the `values` buffer.

* do the conversion in the python routines:

```
cdef cl_object ecl_safe_eval(cl_object form) except NULL:
    cdef cl_object s 
    ecl_sig_on()
    cl_funcall(2,safe_eval_clobj,form)
    ecl_sig_off()

    if ecl_nvalues > 1:
        s = si_coerce_to_base_string(ecl_values(1))
        raise RuntimeError, "ECL says: "+ecl_base_string_pointer_safe(s)
    else:
        return ecl_values(0)
```

With ecl-12.7.1 it just hangs at the same spot even without unicode so there may be something deeper going on there. Haven't tried the new patch it did go under my radar unnoticed so I don't know if it will solve the problem yet.

I noticed later I submitted a patch with tabs instead of spaces in a few places but left it as an exercise for the reader to correct :-)

It appears to work in my current Fedora build

```
$ rpm -q sagemath ecl
sagemath-5.2-1.fc18.x86_64
ecl-12.2.1-4.fc18.x86_64
```
Running it I see:

```

The following tests failed:


        sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/libs/ecl.pyx"

```
Also takes 2.8s in the second run...

I suspect it should be ecl-2.7.1, but there may be a few other variables involving gc and glibc version.

I did not look at ecl-2.7.1 yet, but maybe need a patch equivalent to

http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ecl.git/tree/ecl-12.2.1-signal_handling_thread.patch

Should not be required as sagemath should already have an equivalent patch, and the above patch was required to make maxima ecl backend not hang.

It is supposed to be a noop if ecl is built without unicode support.
AFAIR I made tests with unicode disabled and applying the propsed patch, but it should be wise to test it again.

May be your maxima patch deals with that.
If I use an ecl compiled without unicode and this patch at the same time we there are unresolved symbol because of the declaration

```
cl_object si_coerce_to_base_string(cl_object x) 
```
in ecl.pxd. It won't be there if ecl is compiled without unicode. I may have to crosscheck that if that particular bit is nasty or not.

  The fedora package has an explicit `--enable-unicode`. The fact that ecl was failing `make check` if using `--disable-unicode` was an ecl bug.

> Would that be an acceptable resolution to this ticket, or should we re-enable it with this fix eventually?  (Currently I'd say #13324  is higher-priority so that we might actually have a chance at getting Cygwin up to speed...)


The patch must work with ecl compiled with or without unicode (the patch reason is to not break sagemath if ecl was built with unicode enabled), but the patch was causing a link failure if using an ecl older than 12.2.

-The current ECL spkg disables unicode support, while it is enabled upstream. The patch [attachment:trac_12985_ecl_unicode_5.10.beta4.patch] makes sage work correctly whether the ecl spkg enables unicode or not. The [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpuydt/ecl-12.12.1.p4.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpuydt/ecl-12.12.1.p4.spkg) spkg is compiled with unicode support -- which means less difference with upstream, and is hence better for people packaging sage in various distributions.
+The current ECL spkg disables unicode support, while it is enabled upstream. 
 
-To review, apply [attachment:trac_12985_ecl_unicode_5.10.beta4.patch] and use [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpuydt/ecl-12.12.1.p4.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpuydt/ecl-12.12.1.p4.spkg) (recompile maxima afterwards if not from scratch).
