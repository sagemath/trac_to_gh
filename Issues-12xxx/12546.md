The `<=` and `>=` inequalities are not properly handled in `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` - essentially in both `sage.numerical.mip.LinearConstraint` and `sage.numerical.mip.LinearFunction`. Here is an example:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: b[0] <= b[1] <= 2  # This is not ok
x_1 <= 2
sage: (b[0] <= b[1] <= 2).constraints # Not ok
[x_1, 2]
sage: b[0] >= b[1] # This is ok
x_1 <= x_0
sage: 1 >= b[1]    # This is not since it starts with a constant
False
sage: 1 >= b[1] >= 2*b[0] # Not ok
False
sage: b[2] >= b[1] >= 2*b[0]  # Not ok
2 x_0 <= x_1
```
