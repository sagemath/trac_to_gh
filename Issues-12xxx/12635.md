No harm in removing cruft. Positive review from me. There doesn't seem to be any mention of the removed files in the remaining files. Typical command I used (in zsh):

```
...tions/sage-5.0.beta2 [1] > LC_ALL="C" grep -rnIw 'sageenv' ^(devel)/**/*.py | grep -v 'local/lib'
...tions/sage-5.0.beta2 [1] >
