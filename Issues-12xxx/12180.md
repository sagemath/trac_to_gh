Helloooooooo !!!

I think I fixed it already `:-)`

It must beeeee....... #11950 !

Currently, in Sage 5.0-beta2 :

```
sage: m=Matrix(3,[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0])
sage: g=DiGraph(m)
sage: g.is_directed_acyclic(certificate=True)
(True, [0, 2, 1])
```

Note that since #30479 we have `digraphs.RandomDirectedAcyclicGraph`. It might be helpful if you plan to add tests to `is_directed_acyclic`.

Also, I think this ticket should be in `graph theory` and not `combinatorics`.
