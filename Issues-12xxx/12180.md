Currently we have:

```
sage: m=Matrix(3,[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0])
sage: g=DiGraph(m)
sage: g.is_directed_acyclic(certificate=True)
(True, [0, 1, 2, 1])
```

Component: **combinatorics**

Keywords: **sd35**

Helloooooooo !!!

I think I fixed it already `:-)`

It must beeeee....... #11950 !

Currently, in Sage 5.0-beta2 :

```
sage: m=Matrix(3,[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0])
sage: g=DiGraph(m)
sage: g.is_directed_acyclic(certificate=True)
(True, [0, 2, 1])
```
