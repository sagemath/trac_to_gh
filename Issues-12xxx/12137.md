Is there a particular reason why you are adding the `+` to some commands in the makefile?

```
-       $(recurse) 
+       +$(recurse) 
```
I'm fine with it as it helps debugging, but it shouldn't change whether or not the Singular spkg builds.

To fix the warning

```
make[1]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.
```
The problem is that `make` doesn't recognize it as a recursive rule because the command is the result of a variable expansion.

> I'm fine with it as it helps debugging

Debugging, how?

> but it shouldn't change whether or not the Singular spkg builds.
True.  But it does fit with the theme of fixing parallel building.
