Fixed one issue, hit another.  It seems Singular's Makefiles are very broken.  Looks like a "$MAKE -j1" is in order.

Is there a particular reason why you are adding the `+` to some commands in the makefile?

```
-       $(recurse) 
+       +$(recurse) 
```
I'm fine with it as it helps debugging, but it shouldn't change whether or not the Singular spkg builds.

To fix the warning

```
make[1]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.
```
The problem is that `make` doesn't recognize it as a recursive rule because the command is the result of a variable expansion.

> I'm fine with it as it helps debugging
