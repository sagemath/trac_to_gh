Is there a particular reason why you are adding the `+` to some commands in the makefile?

```
-       $(recurse) 
+       +$(recurse) 
```
I'm fine with it as it helps debugging, but it shouldn't change whether or not the Singular spkg builds.

> Is there a particular reason why you are adding the `+` to some commands in the makefile?

To fix the warning

```
make[1]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.
```
The problem is that `make` doesn't recognize it as a recursive rule because the command is the result of a variable expansion.

Debugging, how?

True.  But it does fit with the theme of fixing parallel building.

I guess the usual use for `+` rules is to execute the command even if you run `make --just-print`. I hadn't thought about the make job server, this is indeed modified as well.
