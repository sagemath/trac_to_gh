At some Sage/Singular days there was a push to make Singular compile in parallel and it worked. Perhaps it got broken recently, but the Singular developers do fix these bugs. Hence, they should be reported upstream and fixed,not worked around by "make -j1".

Is there a particular reason why you are adding the `+` to some commands in the makefile?

```
-       $(recurse) 
+       +$(recurse) 
```
I'm fine with it as it helps debugging, but it shouldn't change whether or not the Singular spkg builds.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A12):
> Is there a particular reason why you are adding the `+` to some commands in the makefile?

To fix the warning

```
make[1]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.
```
The problem is that `make` doesn't recognize it as a recursive rule because the command is the result of a variable expansion.

Debugging, how?

True.  But it does fit with the theme of fixing parallel building.

I guess the usual use for `+` rules is to execute the command even if you run `make --just-print`. I hadn't thought about the make job server, this is indeed modified as well.
