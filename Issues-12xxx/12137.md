Is there a particular reason why you are adding the `+` to some commands in the makefile?

```
-       $(recurse) 
+       +$(recurse) 
```
I'm fine with it as it helps debugging, but it shouldn't change whether or not the Singular spkg builds.

To fix the warning

```
make[1]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.
```
The problem is that `make` doesn't recognize it as a recursive rule because the command is the result of a variable expansion.

> I'm fine with it as it helps debugging

Debugging, how?

> but it shouldn't change whether or not the Singular spkg builds.

True.  But it does fit with the theme of fixing parallel building.

This also works for me.  I could force the old version to fail when building in parallel (on sage.math: `MAKEFLAGS='j -l8' ./sage -f ...`, and similar on OS X).  With the new spkg, it has built every time on sage.math (using both `-l30` and `-l2`).  On OS X, I had one failure with the new spkg using `-l8`, although I've had 4 successful builds that way.  The machine only has 2 cores, so `-l8` is probably a bad setting anyway.  With `-l2` on that machine, no problems.
