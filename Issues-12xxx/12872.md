(2) In the examples, there is only one:-) What do you think of 
the following idea: In the examples, compare your graph with

in the orientation of the graph. (I prefer the orientation in the

sage: E = [(i, 10+p(i)) for i in range(1,11)]

However, the labels (0-9) do not match the permutation set (1-10). Shouldn't they match?

I'm able to install the patch on 5.0.beta14, but shouldn't you had some tests to the function?

Also:

* You could use capitalize() in tests to ease usage.

Arggggggggggggggggggggg !!!

Oh. Well, because it is the word that the guys from Sage-combinat picked the most naturally. I like permutations but that's their stuff much more than mine, so that they hold for True is true for me `:-D`

>  * You could use capitalize() in tests to ease usage.


Hmmmm. Well, I think that it had some meaning to do this for our LP solvers because we never know which letters should be upper case and which one are not (Gurobi or GUROBI ? Cplex or CPLEX), but let's not add a layer of administration to *all* the functions that take a parameter like that. I added a "else" statement though, so that there is an exception raised if the given string does not match any of the good ones. These arguments are always lower-case anyway.

Patch updated !

<a id='comment:26'></a>Hi Natann,

thanks for working on that! Here are some further comments:

1. for the braid representation: I would think of options for orientation being X-to-Y for X,Y being top,bottom or bottom,top or left-right or right-left. Also, I think of a braid in a different way: order the inversions in some order (say lex) and then swap two strings at a time. This produces pictures like on the wiki page for the braid group, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_group.

2. A second way of drawing the chord diagram is by having two vertices (i,"in") and (i,"out") for each letter. The pic then becomes a matching of 2n points placed on a circle.

3. do you think of implementing the Rothe (or inversion) diagram Florent mentioned?

4. The one-line notation is also nice when just drawing arcs between points.

Maybe at least points 3 and 4 might only be worth implementing when doing it in latex/tikz - but this might also apply to 1.

Feel free to say that you don't want to do it, I might then start looking at it one day...

Best, Christian

You mean the kind of drawings produced by my patch on pseudolines (#12090) ? `:-P`

I will not code that twice, but that feature of pseudolines can be exposed in the .show method of course !

Actually I only needed to plot permutations as done by the initial patch, that is the ``algorithm="braid"`` version of the current patch. I implemented others because it did not seem to be the universal way to draw them but besides that I will stay as clear from graphical codes as I can `:-P`

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun !!!
