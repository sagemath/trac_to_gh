One of the easiest dimension formulas is for the dimension of `S_2(Gamma(p))`.  However, in Sage, computing this dimension is shockingly slow.  For example,

```
sage: time Gamma(7).dimension_cusp_forms()
3
Time: CPU 17.27 s, Wall: 17.30 s
sage: time dimension_cusp_forms(Gamma(7),2)
3
Time: CPU 17.22 s, Wall: 17.25 s
```

Fix this.

<a id='comment:1'></a>This is fixed by #10546. With #10546 installed,

```
sage: time Gamma(17777).dimension_cusp_forms()
233722059481
Time: CPU 0.00 s, Wall: 0.00 s
```

So I propose we close this ticket.
