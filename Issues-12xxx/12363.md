 We should upgrade PARI in Sage to this latest version.  It also happens that this is needed to compile PARI with gcc-4.6.2 (see #12369).

In principle this looks okay and it works on a few different machines.  Skynet seems to be down right now, so I can't test it on a very wide range of platforms, though.

It seems to work now.  Anyway, I already tested this on most of the Skynet machines and once it's merged it will be tested again before the release.

Let K be the number field **Q**[y]/(y<sup>2</sup> + y + 1).

Let L be the relative number field K[x]/(x<sup>4</sup> + y*x + 2).

We can also write L = {**Q**[y]/(y<sup>2</sup> + y + 1)}[x]/(x<sup>4</sup> + y*x + 2) (braces added for clarity).

Now consider the element x*y in L, we ask for its relative representation in PARI.  Given the above, the correct answer is

```
Mod(Mod(y, y^2 + y + 1)*x, x^4 + y*x + 2)
```

So, the new answer to the doctest is more correct than the old.
