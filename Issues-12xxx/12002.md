Same as #11972 but for the "scripts" repository.

Directories should be created using

```
try:
    os.makedirs(PATH)
except OSError:
    if not os.path.isdir(PATH): 
        raise
```

In sage-ptest, the code

```python
    if os.path.isdir(TMP):  # used to be os.path.exists(TMP)
        shutil.rmtree(TMP)
    os.makedirs(TMP)
```
will now fail if TMP exists but is not a directory.  Is this okay?  I wouldn't mind just deleting TMP regardless, in which case the code should probably be

```python
try:
    shutil.rmtree(TMP)
except ....
```
or perhaps

```python
shutil.rmtree(tmp, ignore_errors=True)
```
Otherwise it looks okay to me.

My idea was that TMP should never be an ordinary file.  If it ever happens that TMP is a file, then something must have gone badly wrong.

We still have the possibility of a race condition, though:

```python
  if os.path.isdir(TMP):   # suppose TMP does not exist at this point
      shutil.rmtree(TMP)
  # but suppose by now TMP exists
  os.makedirs(TMP)
```
Instead maybe this?

```python
  try:
     os.makedirs(TMP)
  except OSError:
     if os.path.isdir(TMP):
        shutil.rmtree(TMP)
        os.makedirs(TMP)
     else:
        raise
```

There is still a race condition (between the `rmtree` and `makedirs`) but I don't think this can be avoided here.  But I like your code, using a nice `try`/`except` block.
