The following specification is valid:

```
sage: Set0  = species.SetSpecies()
sage: Set1  = species.SetSpecies(min=1)
sage: Set2  = species.SetSpecies(min=2)
sage: Four = species.CombinatorialSpecies()
sage: Four.define(Set2(Four) + Set1*Set0(Four))
```
However, the following code breaks

```
sage: Four.generating_series()[1]
[...]
ValueError: generator already executing
```
Strangely enough, adding some seemingly unrelated instruction work
around it::

```
sage: Set0  = species.SetSpecies()
sage: Set1  = species.SetSpecies(min=1)
sage: Set2  = species.SetSpecies(min=2)

sage: Set2(Set1).generating_series()[1]
0

sage: Four = species.CombinatorialSpecies()
sage: Four.define(Set2(Four) + Set1*Set0(Four))
sage: Four.generating_series()[1]
1
sage: Four.generating_series()[4]
52/3
sage: Four.generating_series()
x + 2*x^2 + 16/3*x^3 + 52/3*x^4 + O(x^5)
```

Yes, this already works.  However, you have to be explicit about the valuation of `Four` now, because it cannot determine that it doesn't have valuation 0.

(I admit I don't see right now whether it should be able to determine that the valuation is not 0 - do you?)

Hm, I think it should know that the valuation is greater than 0.  The valuation of `Set1 * Set0(Four)` is greater than zero, because the valuation of `Set1` is.

`Set2` is not a polynomial (because it is not 'exact'), so `Set2.__call__` is only defined if its argument has valuation at least 1.  Thus we might as well assume that its valuation is at least 1.

I'm not sure yet.

We actually thought about this situation (I forgot), and introduced a `check` parameter for `__call__`.  Of course, it is not passed by the species code.

I am still not sure what the best solution might be.
