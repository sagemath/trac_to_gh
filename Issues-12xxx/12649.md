The following specification is valid:

```
sage: Set0  = species.SetSpecies()
sage: Set1  = species.SetSpecies(min=1)
sage: Set2  = species.SetSpecies(min=2)
sage: Four = species.CombinatorialSpecies()
sage: Four.define(Set2(Four) + Set1*Set0(Four))
```
However, the following code breaks

```
sage: Four.generating_series()[1]
[...]
ValueError: generator already executing
```
Strangely enough, adding some seemingly unrelated instruction work
around it::

```
sage: Set0  = species.SetSpecies()
sage: Set1  = species.SetSpecies(min=1)
sage: Set2  = species.SetSpecies(min=2)

sage: Set2(Set1).generating_series()[1]
0

sage: Four = species.CombinatorialSpecies()
sage: Four.define(Set2(Four) + Set1*Set0(Four))
sage: Four.generating_series()[1]
1
sage: Four.generating_series()[4]
52/3
sage: Four.generating_series()
x + 2*x^2 + 16/3*x^3 + 52/3*x^4 + O(x^5)
```

Here is a smaller code which triggers the problem:

```
Z     = species.SingletonSpecies()
Set2  = species.SetSpecies(min=2)
NMult   = species.CombinatorialSpecies()
NMult.define(Set2(Z+NMult))
NMult.generating_series()[0]

will this be fixed by the recent refactoring ?

maybe check also other tickets with "species" keyword ?

Yes, this already works.  However, you have to be explicit about the valuation of `Four` now, because it cannot determine that it doesn't have valuation 0.

(I admit I don't see right now whether it should be able to determine that the valuation is not 0 - do you?)

We actually thought about this situation (I forgot), and introduced a `check` parameter for `__call__`.  Of course, it is not passed by the species code.

I am still not sure what the best solution might be.
