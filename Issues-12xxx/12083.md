I recently had to draw polytopes for my work.

Many drawing tools already exist. But none of them satisfied me.

So far, I wrote a method that takes a polytope in 3d and a view-angle (taken from Jmol) and outputs a .tex file containing a TikZ image of the polytope.

The method should also be able to deal with 2-polytopes.

The result is highly customizable: colors, edge style, vertices style, etc...

First review: I made the suggested corrections. They are present in the patch trac12083_tikz_polytope_review.patch

Test passed on version 4.7.2

I just need to adapt the code a little bit. It is already mostly written and works with 'quite' big examples: A3,B3 and H3 permutahedra.

I just need to sit and do it: it should be there in a week or so...

If it contains multiple lines, all\n       the lines after the first need to be indented.\n\n     - ``y`` - integer (default: 2) the ...\n\n    OUTPUT:\n\n    integer -- the ...\n```\n\nSo, first say what is the type. Then, say what is the default (inside <code>\\`\\`</code> quotes. Then, give the description.\n\nFor the output, just say the type and what it is. The part <code>\\`\\`tikz_pic\\`\\`</code> is not necessary.\n\n11. The description of `view` argument could be improved.\n\n```\n- ``view`` -- a list of length 3 representing a vector; \n```\n\nI know it is a vector. Is it the camera position? Is it the view angle? Is it the axis for the rotation?\n\n12. I think the type of what you return should be a `LatexExpr` instead of `str`. \n\n```\nfrom sage.misc.latex import LatexExpr\n```\n\nCompare `latex(Image1)` to `latex(LatexExpr(Image1))`. Because, sagetex\nwill call `latex` function on your output...\n\n\nBonne f\u00eate !",

1. Testing the file `polyhedra.py` creates junk in the working directory.

```
cd sage-4.8/devel/sage-slabbe/sage/geometry 
sage -t polyhedra.py
ls *.tex 
polytope-tikz.tex       polytope-tikz2.tex      polytope-tikz3.tex               
```

Saving files in your test is not necessary. I suggest you do the test like this instead :

```python
sage: P1 = polytopes.small_rhombicuboctahedron()   
sage: t = P1.tikz([1,3,5], 175, scale=4)           
sage: type(t)                                      
<type 'str'>                                       
sage: print '\n'.join(t.splitlines()[:4])          
\begin{tikzpicture}%                               
        [x={(-0.939161cm, 0.244762cm)},            
        y={(0.097442cm, -0.482887cm)},             
        z={(0.329367cm, 0.840780cm)},                                          
```

If you want to keep those line in the doc (a good idea a believe), I suggest you mark them as untested :

```
sage: open('polytope-tikz2.tex', 'w').write(Image2)    # not tested
```

2. You import `n` but you don't use it. (If you really needed it, I would have suggest to import the equivalent alias `numerical_approx` instead because the variable `n` is often used as an integer in the code...) But since you don't use it, just remove the import.

```diff
 from subprocess import Popen, PIPE                 
 from sage.misc.all import tmp_filename             
-from sage.misc.functional import norm              
+from sage.misc.functional import norm, n           
 from sage.misc.package import is_package_installed 
```

3. Testing the file `polyhedra.py` is not significantly longer than before : Great!

sage-4.8:

```
$ sage -t polyhedra.py
sage -t  "devel/sage-slabbe/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py"
         [58.0 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------                 
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 58.0 seconds
```

sage-4.8 + your patch:

```
$ sage -t polyhedra.py
sage -t  "devel/sage-slabbe/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py"
         [58.6 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------                 
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 58.6 seconds
```

4. You import VectorSpace but vector could do the job...

```diff
 from sage.modules.free_module_element import vector         
+from sage.modules.free_module import VectorSpace            
 from sage.matrix.constructor import matrix, identity_matrix 
```

In your code, you write :

```
V = VectorSpace(RDF,3) 
view_vector = V(view)  
```

I suggest you change this to :

```
view_vector = vector(RDF, view)
```

5. Every methods must have doctests:

```
$ sage -coverage polyhedra.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------
polyhedra.py
SCORE polyhedra.py: 98% (214 of 217)

Missing doctests:
         * _tikz_2d(self, scale, edge_color, facet_color, opacity, vertex_color, axis):
         * _tikz_2d_in_3d(self, view, rot_angle, scale, edge_color, facet_color, opacity, vertex_color, axis):
         * _tikz_3d_in_3d(self, view, rot_angle, scale, edge_color, facet_color, opacity, vertex_color, axis):

----------------------------------------------------------------------

```

6. I tested my script `tikz2pdf` on the above 3 junk tex files created by the doctest. Pdf files were created without problem. Pictures look great!

7. Building the documentation creates 2 warnings :

```
$ sage -docbuild reference html
...
/Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-4.8/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py:docstring
of sage.geometry.polyhedra.Polyhedron.tikz:26: WARNING: Inline literal

of sage.geometry.polyhedra.Polyhedron.tikz:27: WARNING: Inline literal

...
```

I believe the problem comes from this :

```diff
+            2) Select ``Console`;        
+            3) Select the tab ``State`;  
```

8. Change this 

```
            It read something like:
                                             
            moveto 0.0 {x y z angle} Scale   
```

to

```
            It read something like::
                                             
                moveto 0.0 {x y z angle} Scale   
```

It will look nicer in the documentation.

9. I suggest to change the variable name `rot_angle` to `angle`.

10. Input block do not follow the coding convention.

See www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html

I suggest you follow this example :

```
    INPUT:

     - ``x`` - integer (default: 1) the description of the
       argument x goes here.  If it contains multiple lines, all
       the lines after the first need to be indented.

     - ``y`` - integer (default: 2) the ...

    OUTPUT:

    integer -- the ...
```

So, first say what is the type. Then, say what is the default (inside <code>\`\`</code> quotes. Then, give the description.

For the output, just say the type and what it is. The part <code>\`\`tikz_pic\`\`</code> is not necessary.

11. The description of `view` argument could be improved.

```
- ``view`` -- a list of length 3 representing a vector; 
```

I know it is a vector. Is it the camera position? Is it the view angle? Is it the axis for the rotation?

12. I think the type of what you return should be a `LatexExpr` instead of `str`. 

```
from sage.misc.latex import LatexExpr
```

Compare `latex(Image1)` to `latex(LatexExpr(Image1))`. Because, sagetex
will call `latex` function on your output...


Bonne fête !

So, today I used the reviewed patch to draw a polytope using the library decorations of tikz.

I realized that I was sloppy to implement the edges; they are drawn twice. This also makes the compilation in LaTeX slower.

I will write a patch for version 5.3 that does not have repetitions (and containing the improvements in the rebased version).

So, here is the rebased version of the patch.

I solved a few problems:
The vertices and edges appeared twice before (sloppy implementation);
There was one vertex not drawn in the first (unholy) rebased version;
The facets were badly drawn (problem with vertices naming in the code);
The back edges were badly recognized.

I looked at the compiled tikz output examples and now everything seems in order.

All tests passed on 5.4.1

One thing I don't really like though is the fact that we need to pass to projections to access the tikz method. Perhaps a wrapper would do the thing?

The PDF doc doesn't build:

```
! Package inputenc Error: Keyboard character used is undefined
(inputenc)                in inputencoding `utf8'.

See the inputenc package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

```
To fix this, use `r"""` docstrings instead of `"""`.
