Currently, `sage-sdist` uses

```
/tmp/sage-VERSION
```
as temporary directory, leading to all sorts of race conditions.

I propose to use instead

```
/tmp/sage-sdist-$$/sage-VERSION
```

Why not go all the way and use

```
TOP=`mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/sage-sdist-XXXXX"`
```
This would then also be safe on multi-user systems regardless of umask.

Apparently mktemp isn't POSIX (!?!) but then without it you can't securely create temp files (without the temp directory hack). So everybody in his right mind will have a version of mktemp, I'd say.
