Currently, `sage-sdist` uses

```
/tmp/sage-VERSION
```
as temporary directory, leading to all sorts of race conditions.

I propose to use instead

```
/tmp/sage-sdist-$$/sage-VERSION
```

Why not go all the way and use

TOP=`mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/sage-sdist-XXXXX"`
```
This would then also be safe on multi-user systems regardless of umask.
