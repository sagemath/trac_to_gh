Part of metaticket #12024.  While this ticket doesn't technically depend on #12260 and #12261, those element_ext_pari.py and integer_mod.pyx were split off into those two tickets.

This ticket addresses the files:

```
finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx: 96% (61 of 63)
finite_rings/element_ntl_gf2e.pyx: 94% (53 of 56)
finite_rings/finite_field_givaro.py: 95% (20 of 21)
finite_rings/homset.py: 87% (7 of 8)
finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py: 75% (33 of 44)
```

Apply 12262-rebase.patch, 12262-review.patch

This needed some minor rebasing to apply to 5.0.beta8 (I think because of #11900). Anyway, it's good stuff. I've uploaded my rebased version, and a reviewer patch that doctests one file that somehow escaped, and makes a minor, matter-of-taste change to the doctesting of `_repr_` for homsets. If David or anyone else can sign off on my reviewer patch, then we can give this a positive review.

With both patches installed, every file in `finite_rings` gets 100% coverage except `integer_mod.pyx`, cf #12260.
