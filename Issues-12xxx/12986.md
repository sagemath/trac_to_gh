There are various and differing failures when testing `latex.py` using `-randorder`.

Note that John Palimieri's patch at #11311 improves things substantially: with that patch applied, I only seem to get the following error (sometimes):

```
sage -t --randorder "devel/sage-reviews/sage/misc/latex.py"
