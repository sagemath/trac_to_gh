on some machines we get the following:

```
sage: RealIntervalField(53)(-1) > RR(1)
False
sage: RealIntervalField(54)(-1) > RR(1)
True
```
The second answer `True` is clearly wrong.

If your machine gets the correct answer `False` in both cases, then it most probably gives:

```
sage: RealIntervalField(53)(1) > RR(-1)
True
sage: RealIntervalField(54)(1) > RR(-1)
False
```
where the second answer `False` is wrong.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

after some investigation, the function `_richcmp` in `structure/element.pyx`
computes `r = cmp(type(left), type(right))`, which gives `r=-1` on sage.math,
and `r=1` on my workstation (both with Sage 4.8).

Note that the *types* only are compared, thus by swapping the values I can produce a
bug on sage.math too:

```
sage: RealIntervalField(54)(1) > RR(-1)
False
```

Something is badly wrong by comparing the types, not the values. Here we need help from someone more fluent in the Sage internals.

Are we talking about this piece of code (line 840)

```
            except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
                r = cmp(type(left), type(right))
                if r == 0:
                    r = -1
```
As far as I know comparing type when you cannot compare the values is standard python behavior and is implemented in other places such as sets/set.py

```
    def __cmp__(self, right):
        r"""
        Compare self and right.

        If right is not a Set compare types.  If right is also a Set,
        returns comparison on the underlying objects.

        .. note::

           If `X < Y` is true this does *not* necessarily mean
           that `X` is a subset of `Y`.  Also, any two sets can be
           compared still, but the result need not be meaningful
           if they are not equal. 

        EXAMPLES:
            sage: Set(ZZ) == Set(QQ)
            False
            sage: Set(ZZ) < Set(QQ)
            True
            sage: Primes() == Set(QQ)
            False

        The following is random, illustrating that comparison of
        sets is not the subset relation, when they are not equal::
        
            sage: Primes() < Set(QQ)             # random
            True or False
        """
        if not isinstance(right, Set_object):
            return cmp(type(self), type(right))
        return cmp(self.__object, right.__object)
```
The comparison of type can be machine dependent as far as I remember which explain the inconsistencies. I guess it would be nice to try to get
* a better answer
* a better comparison

Francois,

> Are we talking about this piece of code (line 840) [...]

yes exactly. But in this case the comparison of numerical values (the point interval
[-1.0, -1.0] and the real 1.0) is well defined, thus I do not understand why the code returns
a comparison of *types* which is machine dependent. And moreover I don't understand how the
doctests could work before (see comment 50 in #12171).
