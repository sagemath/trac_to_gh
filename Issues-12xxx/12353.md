on some machines we get the following:

```
sage: RealIntervalField(53)(-1) > RR(1)
False
sage: RealIntervalField(54)(-1) > RR(1)
True
```
The second answer `True` is clearly wrong.

If your machine gets the correct answer `False` in both cases, then it most probably gives:

```
sage: RealIntervalField(53)(1) > RR(-1)
True
sage: RealIntervalField(54)(1) > RR(-1)
False
```
where the second answer `False` is wrong.

<a id='comment:4'></a>after some investigation, the function `_richcmp` in `structure/element.pyx`
computes `r = cmp(type(left), type(right))`, which gives `r=-1` on sage.math,
and `r=1` on my workstation (both with Sage 4.8).

Note that the *types* only are compared, thus by swapping the values I can produce a
bug on sage.math too:

```
sage: RealIntervalField(54)(1) > RR(-1)
False
```

Something is badly wrong by comparing the types, not the values. Here we need help from someone more fluent in the Sage internals.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Are we talking about this piece of code (line 840)

```
            except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
                r = cmp(type(left), type(right))
                if r == 0:
                    r = -1
```
As far as I know comparing type when you cannot compare the values is standard python behavior and is implemented in other places such as sets/set.py

```
    def __cmp__(self, right):
        r"""
        Compare self and right.

        If right is not a Set compare types.  If right is also a Set,
        returns comparison on the underlying objects.

        .. note::

           If `X < Y` is true this does *not* necessarily mean
           that `X` is a subset of `Y`.  Also, any two sets can be
           compared still, but the result need not be meaningful
           if they are not equal. 

        EXAMPLES:
            sage: Set(ZZ) == Set(QQ)
            False
            sage: Set(ZZ) < Set(QQ)
            True
            sage: Primes() == Set(QQ)
            False

        The following is random, illustrating that comparison of
        sets is not the subset relation, when they are not equal::
        
            sage: Primes() < Set(QQ)             # random
            True or False
        """
        if not isinstance(right, Set_object):
            return cmp(type(self), type(right))
        return cmp(self.__object, right.__object)
```
The comparison of type can be machine dependent as far as I remember which explain the inconsistencies. I guess it would be nice to try to get
* a better answer
* a better comparison

yes exactly. But in this case the comparison of numerical values (the point interval
[-1.0, -1.0] and the real 1.0) is well defined, thus I do not understand why the code returns
a comparison of *types* which is machine dependent. And moreover I don't understand how the
doctests could work before (see comment 50 in #12171).
