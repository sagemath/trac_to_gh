We need to upgrade IPython to the shiny new thing. Well, not really - the shiny new thing was 0.11, and 0.13 is now stable. It's been mostly rewritten and is now a lot more modular, as I understand it. Definitely worth using in Sage.

Note: To use the QT console (`sage -ipython qtconsole`), you need qt/qt-devel in your base OS install, the optional zeromq/pyzmq spkgs from #12843, and the optional sip/PyQt spkgs from #13022.

Install the IPython 0.13.1 spkg at [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/ipython-0.13.1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/ipython-0.13.1.spkg)

Would be nice but we need some porting, here is what typically happen if you try to use ipython-0.12 with sage (we had several reports in sage-on-gentoo before I pinned down the version used by sage):

```

Replying to [@jasongrout](#comment:39):
> Maybe the problem is in the IPython 0.12.1->0.13 changes.

On sage-5.0.rc0, I managed to apply the three patches and sage starts correctly. So I guess it's not a matter of IPython 0.13 changes. Although, the sage prompt is not in color anymore (my file .sage/ipython/ipythonrc is set to dark background color).

Is the ipython notebook suppose to work? How should I test it?

Also, doing `sage -ipython notebook` creates this error :

```
$ sage -ipython notebook
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ImportError: The IPython Notebook requires tornado >= 2.1.0

In Sage before this patch, the sage notebook, the Python command line, etc., we have:

```
for i in range(10):
    i
```
outputs the numbers up to 10.

With the new Ipython spkg, etc., we don't.  

```
sage: for i in range(10): i
sage: 
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.07s, Wall time 2m3.22s).
blastoff:sage wstein$ sage -ipython
Python 2.7.2 (default, May 17 2012, 13:12:30) 
In [1]: for i in range(10): i
In [2]: 
```

I'm disappointed, especially because I thought this through and in sagews I recently wrote code so this works correctly in a single cell, even if there are several instances of this.  It's a matter of passing the 'single' option to exec, as is documented in the Python reference.  I wonder why they screwed this up in Ipython 0.12...?

Anyway, I'm not saying this is a show stopper at all - I want the new ipython in sage.  I'm just a little concerned that literally the first thing I tried shows that they made what I consider a bad design choice.  Hopefully it was just bad luck.

I've also renamed trac_13013_ROOT_configuration_files.patch (wrong ticket number) and added a patch to auto-dedent and eval in loops. Now the following works:

Fernando Perez responded: 

BTW, regarding William's comment, that was not a mistake or omission: it was a very deliberate choice we made after lots of thought. Given that we manage numbered prompts and history, and that matplotlib produces so many plots as side effects, after much experimentation we found it worked much better to only execute with 'interactive' mode the last block.

Sage doesn't distinguish stdout from python sys.displayhook, so the opposite behavior may be more desirable, but we actually consider that a 'bad design choice' of sage, because it loses an important distinction and the cache management of output history.

So in summary: our choice is actually sensible and consistent given IPython's internal design :)

And here is Fernando's response:

Precisely so that if the last block has a loop, it doesn't produce multiple `Out [NN]` cells.  We want to keep a one-to-one mapping between a cell and its output.  For example it's quite common to write code like:

```
for i in x:
  plot(x[i], label='blah_i')
```

If we compile that as 'single', we'd get all the Matplotlib line collection results piling up at the bottom, one for each plot call.

We played a *lot* with various options, and settled on this behavior after much experimentation.  After 2 years of using it, I remain convinced it's the right solution *for us*.  Not to say that Sage can't make a different choice that works better for you guys, of course!

Hi fbissey, sorry for hijacking this a bit, but i had exactly the same problem over and over again. What I just found out (and I think it really helps) is to temporarily disable the paths containing ".local" in sys.path in the sage-ipython file. The reason is, that ipython seems to import the "site package" (disable it for pure python via "-S"), because that's where my ipython 0.13 is.

So, by adding this to sage-ipython you I have both at the same time:

```
~~~ after import sys
oldpath = sys.path
sys.path = filter(lambda s : '.local' not in s, sys.path)
import IPython
sys.path = oldpath
```

<div id="comment:83" align="right">comment:83</div>

My 2 cents, after I forced myself to use this for the last few weeks on my laptop.  I have found the new ipython to be pretty annoying.  The cut and paste behavior and lack of autoindent at the command line is pretty painful.   The thing that made me finally give up and revert to the old 0.10 ipython was when I hit control-c at the wrong moment when starting Sage, and somehow the ipython history sqlite database got in a weird locked state.  Nothing I could think to do (including deleting $HOME/.sage/ipython) got this unstuck.  Maybe rebooting would have worked; I don't know.   I'm concerned about how stable and well-tested in the wild the new ipython is.     Proceed with caution.

Two more issues:

- when Sage starts, any lines in my init.sage file are echoed to the screen after the first "sage:" prompt. They aren't executed until I hit the return key:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 5.2, Release Date: 2012-07-25                         |
| Type "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface.        |
| Type "help()" for help.                                            |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: # Here is the beginning of init.sage.

2+2

# Here is another comment

a = 5

# Here is the end of init.sage.
```
 At this point, hitting <RETURN> inserts a 4, a newline, and the "sage:" prompt, and `a` is defined to be 5.

- when I evaluate or `plot` a graphics object, two plot windows are opened:

```
sage: P = plot(sin(x), (x, 0, 10))
sage: P  # opens up two windows showing the same plot. Note also the blank line.

sage: plot(P) # also opens up two windows.

sage: show(P)  # opens up only one window.

Okay, I think my "take2" patch significantly cleans things up and makes things more modular and more "IPythonic".

In particular, this seems to work nicely: do `sage -ipython notebook` to launch the ipython notebook, then evaluate `%load_ext sage.misc.sage_extension`. All preparsing is turned on, etc.  It's great!

There should probably be a bit more documentation in the sage_extension file, and full doctests should be run.  But I think it's ready for other people to hammer on it too.

Here is one issue: something broke in `sage -startuptime`.  I'm not sure it's IPython's fault, though.

Oh, and I was working from IPython master, not IPython 0.13.  I hope that doesn't put a wrench in the works...

But I reverted the "import sage" that #13459 does in [attachment: trac_12719-scripts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12719/trac_12719-scripts.patch.gz), and it still works fine for me (running sage in devel/sage and then `import sage` actually imports the site-packages sage).

I guess one reason to turn off the preparser for magic lines is so that in a line like

```

the "1" doesn't get preparsed. I don't know how the old "time" command was written; did it just call "%time"? If so, maybe that was to allow lines starting with "time" to be preparsed.

The matrix-printing seems to work now, but I'm seeing a few other doctest failures:

```
sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/sage0.py
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/palmieri/12719/sage-5.4.rc1/devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/sage0.py", line 489:

Expected:
    <built-in method gcd of sage.rings.integer.Integer object at 0x...>
Got:
    <function gcd>
**********************************************************************
```
and several failures in sage_extension.py, which would take up too much room to include here.

I think the errors in `sage_extension.py` are because file names in `%runfile foo` are being preparsed: for example, the first error message is pretty long, but it ends with

```
IOError: did not find file '/home/palmieri/.sage/temp/sage.math.washington.edu/Integer(21508)/dir_0/run_cell.py' to load or attach

The same thing happens with `%attach`, and I assume also with the other magic functions which take file names as arguments.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

I don't understand the `sage0.py` failure. Does the new IPython have a different default print representation for some objects? Before the  patches here:

```
sage: a = 4
sage: a.gcd
<built-in method gcd of sage.rings.integer.Integer object at 0x480e330>
sage: a.gcd?
Type:		builtin_function_or_method
Base Class:	<type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
String Form:	<built-in method gcd of sage.rings.integer.Integer object at 0x480e330>
Namespace:	Interactive
Definition:	a.gcd(self, n)
Docstring:
     ...
```
With the patches:

```
sage: a = 4
sage: a.gcd
<function gcd>
sage: a.gcd?
Type:       builtin_function_or_method
String Form:<built-in method gcd of sage.rings.integer.Integer object at 0x5b7c5a0>
Definition: a.gcd(self, n)
Docstring:
   ...
```
With the old version, the print rep for `a.gcd` is the same as what's labeled the "String Form" when you do `a.gcd?`. With the new version, the print rep has changed but the "String Form" has not. I'm also confused by this behavior (with the patches):

```
sage: a = 4
sage: G = a.gcd
sage: G.__repr__()
'<built-in method gcd of sage.rings.integer.Integer object at 0x4b685a0>'
sage: G
<function gcd>
sage: str(G)
'<built-in method gcd of sage.rings.integer.Integer object at 0x4b685a0>'
```
Why isn't `G` printed using its `__repr__` method?

I've tried out some other objects (e.g., matrices and elements of the Steenrod algebra) and my guess is that the print representations for methods defined in pyx files are getting changed to `<function ...>`, while those defined in py files haven't changed. Any ideas why? Looking at `ipython-0.10.2.p1/src/IPython/UserConfig/ipythonrc`, I see the configuration option `object_info_string_level 0`, which looks relevant, but we're not using this style of configuration, right?

We need another patch, since the pager in IPython has moved. One instance of this was fixed in one of the patches, but we need to fix others.

Note the change to sagedoc.py; this needs to be tested.

I don't know. Even in previous versions of Sage:

```
sage: type(4.gcd)
<type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
```
I wonder if changing this would require patching Cython. If we knew where the methods for Cython methods were defined, maybe we could just define a method `_repr_pretty_`, as described in https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/lib/pretty.py#L27. Line 3737-3740 of `local/lib/python/site-packages/Cython/Compiler/Nodes.py` says

```
        is_builtin_function_or_method = "PyCFunction_Check(%s)" % func_node_temp
        is_overridden = "(PyCFunction_GET_FUNCTION(%s) != (PyCFunction)%s)" % (
            func_node_temp, self.py_func.entry.func_cname)
        code.putln("if (!%s || %s) {" % (is_builtin_function_or_method, is_overridden))
```
Is this relevant?

Alternatively, we could patch the file "pretty.py", modifying the definition of `_type_pprinters` somehow, although I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, we could temporarily accept the new print representation for Cython-defined methods, and create a new ticket for fixing this. It seems like a small issue to me, and maybe it shouldn't hold up the rest of this ticket.

On the [Cython users](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/cython-users/lVEMHM5keNI/discussion) mailing list, in which I essentially quoted Jason's message to the IPython list, Bradley Froehle says

```
There's nothing to be done in Cython here.  As you point out, 
a.seed is a builtin (i.e. compiled) method and type(a.seed) returns
`builtin_function_or_method` correctly.
```
So I think our options are

- hack pretty.py
- wait for a real IPython fix
- change the doctests to match the current output for now, and open a new ticket to fix this later.

Preferences? Am I missing any good choices?

In `SageInteractiveShell.system_raw`, does `libraries` refer to a global or is that variable simply unused?  Since `false` isn't guaranteed to return exit status 1 (on Solaris, it returns 255, POSIX specifies it must be non-zero), the doctest must be changed to something more portable. I also don't see this function discussed on #975.

```
by

```
os.access(FILE, os.X_OK):
```
since you want to check for an *executable* file.

I don't know whether we can assume bash, I would go for Posix `/bin/sh` compatible.

For example

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$SAGE_ORIG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH";

is bash-specific and I'm not sure about

```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$SAGE_ORIG_LD_LIBRARY_PATH"  ...

I have one mild complaint: if I do

```
sage: note[TAB]

it doesn't complete to "notebook" anymore, saying that "%notebook" is also a valid completion. Would it be possible, here or on a followup ticket, to rename the "%notebook" magic command to "%ipython_notebook" or something similar?

```
"""string

does no preparsing on the second line because IPython doesn't do transformations for the second line (since it's inside quotes).  IPython admits that this is a hackish and fragile strategy, and they are working on the issue.  For example, they are implementing [AST transformers](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2301) and [stateful line transformers](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2447).

This seems to cause some problems on OpenSolaris.

First a doctest time-out:

```
Trying:
    sage0.eval('2+2')###line 320:_sage_    sage: sage0.eval('2+2')
Expecting:
    '4'
[...hangs...]
```

Interrupting this and restarting Sage gives:

Oops, Sage crashed. We do our best to make it stable, but...

A crash report was automatically generated with the following information:
  - A verbatim copy of the crash traceback.
  - A copy of your input history during this session.
  - Data on your current Sage configuration.

It was left in the file named:
        '/export/home/buildbot/.sage/ipython-new/Sage_crash_report.txt'
If you can email this file to the developers, the information in it will help
them in understanding and correcting the problem.

You can mail it to: sage-support at sage-support@googlegroups.com
with the subject 'Sage Crash Report'.

If you want to do it now, the following command will work (under Unix):
mail -s 'Sage Crash Report' sage-support@googlegroups.com < /export/home/buildbot/.sage/ipython-new/Sage_crash_report.txt

To ensure accurate tracking of this issue, please file a report about it at:
http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac

Hit <Enter> to quit (your terminal may close)
```

Removing `$HOME/.sage` fixed that.

Can someone test something really quick with the official version of the ticket, if it's convenient?

Do:

```
1; 2
```

Does it print out both 1 and 2 in both the command line and the notebook?  Right now, aleph only prints out 2, and I've narrowed it down to how IPython handles the 'print out the last expression' (IPython prints out the last expression, while Sage prints out the last physical line).

Hello,

I just want to confirm that this is expected with this ticket:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 5.6, Release Date: 2013-01-21                         |
| Type "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface.        |
| Type "help()" for help.                                            |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: exit
'Use Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF), %Exit, or %Quit to exit without confirmation.'
sage: 
```
Was "just exit for exit" a feature of old IPython or Sage?
