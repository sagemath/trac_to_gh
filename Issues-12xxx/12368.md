I agree with R. Andrew, so I'm copying `$CFLAGS` to `$CCFLAGS` in `spkg-install`.  Needs review.

Yes, but I guess sage-5.0.beta2 is too old.  I'll let somebody else referee this:

```
deep:~ wstein$ cd s/spkg/bin/
deep:bin wstein$ ls
json_bundle.py	sage-env	testcc.sh	text-collapse
sage		sage-spkg	testcxx.sh	text-expand
deep:bin wstein$ sage -version
