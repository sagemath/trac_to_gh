I'm not sure.  However, if he did then he would be changing how the spkg-install scripts works from before.   It did not used to append to CCFLAGS -- it always wrote it from scratch.    So I think appending or not is orthogonal to refereeing this patch; it could be another ticket. 

My question is: what the heck is testcflags.sh?   It doesn't exist on my OS X 10.7 install, or in Sage-5.0x as far as I can tell, or in this spkg...  So I can't referee this package.

Did you look in `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin`?

I agree with R. Andrew, so I'm copying `$CFLAGS` to `$CCFLAGS` in `spkg-install`.  Needs review.

Note that I did not mark it as needs work, I definitely agree that it is not necessary for refereeing this ticket.  I would have given it a positive review regardless (since it did what it was supposed to do), but since it is a trivial change that improves the build process, and since he was already touching the CCFLAGS variable, I figured it couldn't hurt to actually have the global CFLAGS respected.

Yes, but I guess sage-5.0.beta2 is too old.  I'll let somebody else referee this:

```
deep:~ wstein$ cd s/spkg/bin/
deep:bin wstein$ ls
json_bundle.py	sage-env	testcc.sh	text-collapse
sage		sage-spkg	testcxx.sh	text-expand
deep:bin wstein$ sage -version
