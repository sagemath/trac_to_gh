This will break if `$CC` includes arguments:

```
compilerinclude = Popen([os.environ['CC'], '--print-file-name=include'], stdout=PIPE)
```

What's the point of the `use_gnu`, `use_sun` stuff??  What does "tools" do anyway?

True, thankfully this is a trivial fix if we assume there are no spaces in compiler path.
> What's the point of the `use_gnu`, `use_sun` stuff??  What does "tools" do anyway?

By default scons searches the system and to set up its environment, if you specify tools it skips this search and just sets stuff up with the given tools. Currently all this does is speed up the configuring process, but this can be used to make sage respect the CC, CXX, LD, AR,... variables.

The SConstruct file doesn't work.  First make a symbolic link "gplusplus" to "g++".  Then:

```
jdemeyer@arcanis:/usr/local/src/sage-5.0.beta1$ gplusplus --version
gplusplus (GCC) 4.6.3 20120123 (prerelease)

jdemeyer@arcanis:/usr/local/src/sage-5.0.beta1$ CXX="gplusplus" ./sage -b

----------------------------------------------------------
sage: Building and installing modified Sage library files.


Installing c_lib
AttributeError: SConsEnvironment instance has no attribute 'SharedLibrary':
  File "/usr/local/src/sage-5.0.beta1/devel/sage-main/c_lib/SConstruct", line 138:
    lib = env.SharedLibrary( "csage", [ "src/" + x for x in srcFiles ],
ERROR: There was an error building c_lib.

```

So, I think

```
# the following two lines should probably be replaced with a better test
```
should actually be done.  You should check features, not names of executables.

I really don't understand the utter brokenness of this "tools" variable.  I should show this to every person who claims that autoconf sucks.

Anyway, `c_lib` still doesn't build with clang:

```
bsd:sage-5.0.beta4-gcc jdemeyer$ CC=clang ./sage -b

The Sun compilers don't understand `--version`.  They do report their version with `-V`.  The output is something like

```
cc: Sun C 5.9 SunOS_sparc Patch 124867-01 2007/07/12

or

```
c99: Sun C 5.10 SunOS_i386 2009/06/03

So grepping for "sunos" should be fine.

Should be fixed now, although sage still doesn't build with clang (although I'm fairly confident this is due to other spkgs at this point).

I also threw in something to test for suncc, but I can't test it, so if you can let me know how it works, that would be great.

Related, and equally important:

If `CFLAGS` are set (even to `""`), Python's `CFLAGS` are dropped, which include `-fno-strict-aliasing`, which means that you currently always have to manually add `-fno-strict-aliasing` when setting/modifying `CFLAGS` (and building with GCC), since otherwise invalid code is generated for (at least some) Cython modules.

(`-fstrict-aliasing` in contrast is *enabled* by most of GCC's `O`-levels.)

Luckily, if you build Python with `CC` or `CXX` set, the Sage library just picks up these settings, so I personally never had trouble with the main topic of this ticket, while other spkgs (like Lcalc, ratpoints, zn_poly and even Singular!) still suck...

According to `spkg/standard/deps`, no.
