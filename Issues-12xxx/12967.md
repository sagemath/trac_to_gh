We have 

```
sage: bool(pi<Infinity)
False
sage: bool(pi>Infinity)
True
```
which is obviously wrong. It seems that the problem only occurs with `pi`, because the following give correct results

```
sage: bool(pi<2*pi)
True
sage: bool(2*pi<Infinity)
True
sage: bool(e<Infinity)  
True
sage: bool(e<pi)
True
```

ATM, this is caused by #11506:

```
sage: pi.pyobject()
pi
sage: type(pi.pyobject())
<class 'sage.symbolic.constants.Pi'>
sage: pi.pyobject() < oo        
False
sage: pi.pyobject() > oo
True
```

With #12950,  comparison of infinities in Pynac changed. Now I get:

```
sage: bool(pi>Infinity)
False
sage: bool(pi<Infinity) 
False
```

which is better. I hope with the ordering patches in the Pynac queue this will improve.

The results of comparison with `e` is not relevant in this case. `e` is not a constant in Pynac, it is the `exp()` function. Once you form the relational expression `e < Infinity`, the comparison is handled differently.

I suggest adding a patch with doctests reflecting the new behavior with #12950 and closing this ticket when #12950 is merged.

| Sage Version 5.4.1, Release Date: 2012-11-15                       |
| Type "notebook()" for the browser-based notebook interface.        |

----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: bool(pi < infinity)
False
sage: bool(oo < pi)
False
```
That is what should actually be tested, as Burcin points out.  Also, I feel like this is unintuitive enough of behavior (that pi is more or less incomparable with infinity and not like this)

```
sage: bool(2< oo)
True
```
that we should say something to that effect here, maybe even elsewhere in comparison doc where we have other examples saying that `>` gives `False` if we can't prove it's `True`.

I'm also wondering whether this is really "fixed" and deserves that doctest status.

I agree.  This comparison is apparently done by Pynac.  Using Maxima gives the correct result:

```
sage: e = (SR(pi) < SR(Infinity)); e
pi < +Infinity
sage: bool(e)
False
sage: maxima(e)
%pi<inf
sage: bool(maxima(e))
True
```
(This is not fixed by #11506, by the way.)

You will understand this all cannot be part of this ticket.
EDIT: Actually the failing doctests support your opinion, and probably I better adapt the tests to the new behaviour.

It was wrong to always raise an exception when an interval was compared. The reason why `pi in RIF` was `True` rather lies in `structure.parent.py:Parent.contains()` where the line

```
EQ = (x2 == x)
```
didn't account for symbolics and should read

```
EQ = bool(x2 == x)
```
This uncovers another bug in `Expression.nonzero()` which shows as

```
sage: bool(sqrt(2)==CC(sqrt(2)))
False
```
because `sqrt(2) == 1.41421356237309` is `False`. Any ideas how to fit this in the current code?

Reboot. This branch has clean logic handling all relations that can be decided without Maxima. I have left in the call to Pynac's `relational_to_bool` although it could possibly replaced too. The branch depends on #17984.

However, there is one doctest failure:

```
File "src/sage/structure/parent.pyx", line 1224, in sage.structure.parent.Parent.__contains__
Failed example:
    pi in RIF # there is no element of RIF equal to pi
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
```
It is caused because `Parent.__contains__` assumes wrongly that all
equations that are of type `Expression` must be true, and `pi == RIF(pi)` isn't.
In develop this is masked by code catching all kinds of exceptions that hides the fact that the conversion of the relation to Maxima throws an exception. The code takes this to mean that `pi == RIF(pi)` is `False`. In contrast this branch determines without invoking Maxima correctly that the relation is `False` but the fact no exception is thrown leads to `Parent.__contains__` returning `True`! Since it's clearly wrong here to throw an exception just to oblige `Parent.__contains__` that method in turn must be fixed.

It would be if users wanted `x in RR/CC` to mean `x element of real/complex field of exactly this precision` but the overwhelming majority want it to mean `x element of real/complex field regardless of precision`.

But currently the precision is already taken care of in this way:

```
sage: pi.n(10) in RR
True
sage: pi.n(100) in RealField(50)
True
```
Isn't this what you want to keep as the correct behaviour?

Maybe we should discourage users from using `x in RR`.  There is the following alternative:

```
sage: pi.is_real()
True
```

Only if you identify `RR` with the mathematical field **R** of real numbers.  If we are serious about presenting `RR` as a certain set of numbers that is quite different from the mathematical field **R** (for example, `Infinity in RR` already returns `True`), then we can just let `pi in RR` return `False`, emphatically warn users about this, and say that different methods are needed to decide if an expression represents a mathematical real number.

Exactly. If we want consistency across Sage, then the semantics of `x in RR` *cannot* be "`x` is a real number"; it must be "`x` is an element of the parent `RR`" or something similar.

Not at all; I often find that a good first step towards fundamentally fixing a bug is trying to *remove* hacks that someone else put in to make a specific example work.

I disagree that no good model presents itself; defining `x in P` as `bool(P(x) == x)` seems like a good programming model to me, since it is simple and predictable.

The more I think about it, the more the fundamental problem does not seem to be membership testing, but *comparison* between real numbers defined in different approximations of the real numbers.  Do we want `RR(sqrt(2))` to be equal to `SR(sqrt(2))` or not?  And what about `RR(1/3)` and `QQ(1/3)`?
