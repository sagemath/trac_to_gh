I find the first patch a bit difficult to understand due to mixing several things defining the embedding: a cone and two dictionaries of rays. Also `defining_cone` argument is not documented in the constructor of the orbit morphism.

Orbits are in 1:1 correspondence with cones of the original fan, so it makes perfect sense to pass this information and store it (as it is currently done in the patch).

Mathematically, this is all that is needed, but since we have so far issues with supporting quotient lattices and instead the fan of the orbit lives in a "regular lattice", we need to keep the correspondence somehow. As it is done by some matrix, perhaps that's what we need to pass to the constructor and store.

Instead, the current version constructs a codomain_ray->domain_ray dictionary, it is passed to the constructor and constructor reverses it into domain_ray->codomain_index dictionary. Note that the map does not have to be one-to-one for non-simplicial fans, so this dictionary just picks some random representative for a domain ray. The choice may affect the decision on whether embedding can be realized as a polynomial map or not.

I also think it is confusing to store non-primitive generators for rays and treat a ray as not found if a non-primitive generator is found. We do represent rays throughout the code just by their generators, but it is always assumed that they are normalized.

As a feature request it would be nice to have support for maps given by homogeneous polynomials in the other direction, i.e. a map from the 12 orbit of P112 to P1 can be given as (0:z1:z2) -> (z1^2:z2) and this will work for all orbits with powers corresponding to that "non-primitivity of generators". Or is it already implemented and I am missing something?

Anyway, concretely: how about passing and storing `defining_cone` and `projection_matrix` as base pieces of data and relying on them for consecutive computations?

For the second patch:
1. `relative_star_generators` does not have INPUT/OUTPUT and in general it would be nice to have a clear description of what it does.
2. Can we please rename `fiber` to `generic_fiber`? (I would expect that `fiber` would return a particular one based on some input.) Also - why the documentation says that it returns a connected component, isn't it unique for a generic fiber?
3. I also got confused by `fiber_component` name thinking it computes the fiber over points corresponding to higher-dimensional cones of the codomain. After some more thinking and reading I think that it is indeed the correct name, but would be nice to describe in the documentation the structure of non-generic fibers and why it makes more sense to work with components corresponding to domain cones rather than fibers of codomain ones.
4. `fiber_component` and `fiber_dimension` also lack INPUT/OUTPUT blocks.
5. `SchemeMorphism_fan_fiber_toric_variety` input documentation does not match the code.
6. Perhaps the name of the class can be changed to `..._fiber_component_...` since it does not operate with the whole fiber.
7. "Defined by embedding the fiber irreducible component defined by the primitive preimage cone 1-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 4-d lattice N." does not read. While I was trying to reformulate it, I became unsure of this class at all. Isn't it just about embedding a torus orbit closure into the original toric variety? I.e. the toric morphism and fibers are not important?

There were failures due to the switch to `PointCollection`, I've fixed them (added `__add__`).

How about the following?
* `fiber_generic()` returns (X, N) where X is a toric variety corresponding to the kernel fan and N is the number of copies if the whole torus of the codomain is covered surjectively and 0 otherwise.
* `fiber_component(domain_cone)` returns (X, N) where N is always some positive number of copies, since here we specify a domain cone and there are definitely some components corresponding to it, in particular `fiber_component(domain_origin)` will return the number of components of the fiber over distinguished point of the `codomain_origin`, even if `fiber_generic` returns (X, 0), meaning that over non-distinguished points there are likely empty fibers.
* `fiber_dimension(codomain_cone)` returns -1 (or -intinity?) if the corresponding orbit of the codomain is not covered surjectively.
* `fiber_graph(codomain_cone)` returns an empty graph is the corresponding orbit is not covered surjectively.

It seems like there is a natural way to factor a morphism into a surjection and an injection, first map to the image fan and then embed the image in the codomain. The error raised in the `fiber_...()` methods could direct the users then to do this.

There isn't really a universally accepted definition of "fibration", it depends on the category you are in. In algebraic topology it is a morphism with the homotopy lifting property, but in algebraic geometry the underlying topological space of a fibration usually is not a fibration in the topology sense. As another data point, [Danilov&Shafarevich define a fibration of curves](http://books.google.com/books?id=ZhzXJHUgcRUC&lpg=PA137&ots=aWMqiSqste&dq=fibration%20of%20curves&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q=fibration%20of%20curves&f=false) to be onto. 

Also, *elliptic fibration* definitely implies surjective to me. Or, in other words, if you excise complete preimages in the codomain then this is not what I would call an elliptic fibration. Though of course YMMV.

Regardless of the category, I think "fibration" ought to mean that one is not dealing with the most general morphism but with a suitable morphism such that the preimages can be thought of as being parametrized by the base. To me, this means that you definitely want the morphism to be surjective or at least dominant.

In algebraic geometry, a fibration needs not be equidimensional (or *flat* in the sense of commutative algebra). This is different from the topologist's fibrations.

Well, I guess what I suggest boils down to:
* *fibration* - a surjective equidimensional morphism, a "global in codomain" property check by `is_fibration`;
* *fiber* - a preimage of a single point, a "local in codomain" construction well-defined for any morphism, regardless of its relation to fibrations in any category. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Fiber.html is an easy to find reference, although not as authoritative as Danilov&Shafarevich ;-)

Maybe it is a bit unfortunate that they have the same root, kind of like reduced/reducible, but calling it `preimage_component(domain_cone)` is not clear enough since then it may mean full preimage of an orbit or its closure, and something like `point_preimage_component(domain_cone)` is incomprehensible.

> E.g. take a blowup of a plane and consider the map from one of the charts to the plane. How will it factor???

I don't understand what the problem is. This should factor into the inclusion of the one chart in the blow-up (injective), and the blow-down morphism (surjective). That is:

```
Fan([ Cone([(1,0),(1,1)]) ])
  -> 
    Fan([ Cone([(1,0),(1,1)]), Cone([(1,1),(0,1)]) ])
      ->
        Fan([ Cone([(1,0),(0,1)]) ])
```

That's what you have suggested earlier and this is also the factorization used in HLY paper. The intermediate variety is clearly defined: intersect the codomain fan with the linear subspace spanned by the map of lattices. Works fine when both fans of domain/codomain are complete.

Now for the blowup chart you propose to replace a map between two affine varieties induced by the identity matrix with a reverse factorization - first inclusion, then surjection, going through an intermediate non-affine variety. How is this intermediate variety defined/constructed in general?

How about this compromise between surjective/general morphisms support - compute fibers only for dominant ones. For a toric morphism being dominant implies:
* surjection between tori, thus
* surjection onto any torus orbit if it was hit at all, so
* fiber/preimage over any point of any orbit is the same, including the case when it is empty.
So there is no confusion with returning something when distinguished points have something over them and some others don't. In terms of #14353 factorization, this means supporting compositions of surjective and birational factors, but throwing exceptions if the last injective factor is not an identity map on tori/lattices.

In particular, a blowup chart will be supported with single point fiber over the torus, single point fiber over one of the axis, empty fiber over another axis, and an affine line fiber over the origin. Awesome example for some intro classes ;-)
