There are **lots** of files in `devel/sage/.hgignore` which no longer exist.

Also, we should add `MANIFEST` which is created by `sage -sdist`.

`pull` is no longer in `.hgignore` with my patch.

The `.h` files are auto-generated by Cython and should not be in the MANIFEST.

I have no idea about `.sconsign.dblite`
