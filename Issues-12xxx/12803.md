This is a bug in Singular 3.1.7 (fixed in 4.0.1, see ticket #17254):

```
R.<xe,xv> = ZZ[]

J = Ideal(4*xv^3+3*xv^2, 3*xe*xv^2+xe-2*xv);

I  = Ideal(-3, -3*xv-1, -3);
I2 = Ideal(-3, -3*xv-1);
assert( I  == I2 )

Q1 = J.quotient(I) # wrong
Q2 = J.quotient(I2)

assert( Q1 == Q2 ) # fails
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>This bug (and some others) are fixed in recent [Singular](https://github.com/Singular/Sources):

```
ring rng = integer,(x,y,z),dp;
ideal A = x^2, x*y, x*z;
ideal B = x;
quotient(A,B);
//_[1]=z
//_[2]=y
//_[3]=x
```
(offtopic: are all known Singular-bugs reported [upstream](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/newticket)? )

However, I recall that there are some issues when considering updating Singular :
- there is no stable/official release yet 
- in sage-devel (?, cannot currently find the post I had in mind) it was mentioned that the libSingular interface changed significantly in comparison to v 3.1.6
