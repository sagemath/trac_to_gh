```
The down option is broken in order_ideal_complement_generators due to
a glitch:

```
    sage: P = Poset( ( [1,2,3], [ [1,3], [2,3] ] ) )
    sage: sage: P.order_ideal_complement_generators([1,2], direction='up')
    set([3])
    sage: P.order_ideal_complement_generators([1,2], direction='down')
    set([3])
```

The result should be [] in the later case.

Here is a modified patch, that should pass all tests and is fully documented.

There is an annoying issue with the names of the methods "upper_ideal", "lower_ideal", "order_ideal", "order_filter"

Hi Frédéric,

Thank you for getting this patch ready for submission!

One small technical issue is that the header of the patch needs to start with 
#14828: ... description of the patch ...
Could you change this?

I am not so happy about the naming conventions that you used. Could you please give me references that use order filter and order ideal? Why don't you like upper set and lower set? That seems like a standard name, see

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_set

Best,

Anne

Oh, I have not seen your answer, for some reason.

I will take care of the header question soon.

Concerning terminology, it seems that confusion is everywhere, see for instance 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_ideal

saying "The terms order ideal, order filter, semi-ideal, down-set and decreasing subset are sometimes used for arbitrary lower or upper sets"

So far, in sage, we have the following definition (in P.order_ideal?)

I is an order ideal if, for any x in I and y such that y <= x, then y is in I.

So I have tried to stick at this convention and not to introduce two competing notations in sage. I do not like upper set and lower set because of the word set, which does not has the idea of closure. I do not like order ideal and order filter because I never remember which one is which. I would like to use upper ideal and lower ideal, but nobody seems to use that. This is rather boring.

Hi Frederic.

I agree that this naming thing is a pain; which is actually what
stopped me from cleaning this earlier. Thanks for pushing it forward ...

order_ideal and order_filter are definitely bad for the reason you
mention (which one is up, which one is down). So at least this is
settled: we want to move away from those.

upper_set and lower_set has the advantage of being unambiguous and
relatively clear (though I see your point about "closures"). So I
would vote for this.  But ...  we also would want to be able to pass
upper/lower as argument, and I agree that ``set(dir="up")`` really
does not make sense :-) And ``upper_set(dir='down') is not great
either.

I am really not keen with "ideal" because it has two conflicting
meanings. But it's been in Sage for a while and we already do
ideal(side="left/right") in rings/monoids, so ideal(dir="up/down") is
consistent.

Would we have a nice method name for the other definition of ideal
(e.g. a upper set such that any meet of two elements is also in it)?

Cheers,
                                 Nicolas

The other definition of "order filter" is not quite that: it says "an upper set such that any two elements have a common lowest bound in the upper set"

It seems to imply (for finite posets) that it has a unique minimal element, and that this other definition could be called a "principal upper ideal" or "principal upper set".

There are subtle issues for infinite posets, but should we be concerned about that ?

Oops, you are right; I formulated this to fast.

> It seems to imply (for finite posets) that it has a unique minimal element, and that this other definition could be called a "principal upper ideal" or "principal upper set".


Indeed.

> There are subtle issues for infinite posets, but should we be concerned about that ?


Not right now. But that will come! So it would be good to know that there exist a plan, even if we don't know right away which plan it should be.

Here is new patch, with correct header.

I have chosen to do the following:

- keep the names "order_ideal" and "order_filter" for backward compatibility
- introduce "upper_set" and "lower_set" as aliases
- use the names "ideal_of_subset" and "ideals_of_subsets" for generic cases

This is clearly not at all coherent. Should we try to reach coherence in this ticket, or should we rather use this ticket to solve the issue that has been raised ?

Shouldn't that ``gens`` be ``elements`` now?
