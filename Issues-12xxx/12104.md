I don't think that this is a problem with `randstate` per se -- my guess is that there's another extension module which fails to import due to not being able to find a correct library.  Going into a Sage shell and using "cygcheck" would be one way to find this.  I believe this is was the symptom with FLINT, NTL, etc.

Some of the linking is screwed up. For instance:

```
$ cygcheck ./csage.dll
C:\cygwin\usr\local\sage\sage-4.7.2\local\lib\csage.dll
  C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll
    C:\Windows\system32\ADVAPI32.DLL
      C:\Windows\system32\msvcrt.dll
 [.... lots of system stuff ...]
  C:\cygwin\bin\cyggcc_s-1.dll
  C:\cygwin\bin\cygstdc++-6.dll
  C:\cygwin\usr\local\sage\sage-4.7.2\local\bin\cyggmp-3.dll
  C:\cygwin\usr\local\sage\sage-4.7.2\local\bin\libpython2.6.dll
cygcheck: track_down: could not find libntl.dll
```

And on c_lib.dll cygcheck also reports that it can't find libntl.dll 

Indeed, there is no libntl.dll. There is an .dll.a file, despite the fact that it's a dynamic library. Some misnaming has occurred. Renaming local/lib/libntl.dll.a to 
local/lib/libntl.dll fixes this particular error.
Fortunately, the other *dll.a files are actual archive files, I checked this. So this   should be traced to the ntl spkg.

OK, so after this libntl fix and rebasing, I see that ./sage -python -v
dies when I do from sage import *.
As follows: 

```
$ ./sage -python -v

dlopen("/usr/local/sage/sage-4.7.2/local/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload/readline.dll", 2);

>>> from sage import *
[......]
import sage.monoids # precompiled from /usr/local/sage/sage-4.7.2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/monoids/__init__.pyc

```
and that's where it silently dies.

Any clues?

> Indeed, there is no libntl.dll. There is an .dll.a file, despite the fact that it's a dynamic library. Some misnaming has occurred. Renaming local/lib/libntl.dll.a to local/lib/libntl.dll fixes this particular error.

I use

for this, at least I think that's the syntax.

> looks familiar?

Umm, yes!  The following is all I needed to see:

```
init_pynac_I
```
It's #11551.   I spent MANY hours on this over the summer without much luck.

Great, that means we're back where we were before - Mike Hansen already knew about this probably 9 months ago, so luckily we've managed to get *back* to that point :)

My recommendation, if the randstate thing does turn out to be #11635, is to close this ticket as a duplicate.

Since [4.8.alpha3](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-4.8.alpha3/sage-4.8.alpha3/spkg/standard/) still has the (unpatched) ntl 5.5.2, I think that #11635 should solve the problem.  

Dima, if you can confirm that and the #11551 being the other issue, we should close this ticket as a dup.  I'm setting things in such a way that you can just set to positive review if that's the case.
