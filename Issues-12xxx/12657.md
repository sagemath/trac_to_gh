The Frobenius automorphism of *p*-adic fields was added in #8241.  The implementation is horribly inefficient and should use Hensel lifting directly rather than decomposing into a list of Teichmuller representatives.

This optimization should probably wait on #12555.

Depends on #14304

The method that needs to be improved is `frobenius_unram` in `src/sage/libs/linkages/padics/unram_shared.pxi`.  This may want to wait on some more p-adic polynomial developments, but could also be done now.

I don't understand why you need to redo Newton iteration in `frobenius_unram`.

Alternatively, instead of storing the powers of `frob_a` in a dictonary, you can use Horner scheme.

I just tested the Horner method and it is roughly 10 times slower in Zq(5<sup>100</sup>,100). It seems that multiplying elements of the extension by elements in Q_p is very fast, but multiplying elements in the extension is generally slow. Cacheing the expensive multiplications  (and maybe performing more multiplications over all) appears to be a good strategy in very high degree.

Fantastic! I see your implementation of Horner is much better than what I was doing, and I have reproduced the performance increase on k8s: After `_frob_gen()` is cached, your scheme computes frobenius of random elements of ` Zq(5^100,100) ` in approximately 60 ms, while the previous method was taking 800ms. Your current implementation is definitely the way to go (and is roughly 1000 times faster than what is currently in Sage)

maybe the iteration `+    for i in range(len(coefs)):`
could be replaced by just `+    for ci in coefs:` ?
