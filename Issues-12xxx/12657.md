The Frobenius automorphism of *p*-adic fields was added in #8241.  The implementation is horribly inefficient and should use Hensel lifting directly rather than decomposing into a list of Teichmuller representatives.

This optimization should probably wait on #12555.

The method that needs to be improved is `frobenius_unram` in `src/sage/libs/linkages/padics/unram_shared.pxi`.  This may want to wait on some more p-adic polynomial developments, but could also be done now.

I don't understand why you need to redo Newton iteration in `frobenius_unram`.

Alternatively, instead of storing the powers of `frob_a` in a dictonary, you can use Horner scheme.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:16'></a>\nWe redid the Newton iteration in _frob_gen() because that was easier (for me) than finding & adapting an existing method. The only method I see is .hensel_lift(p,e) in  sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial, and I don't see the advantage of adapting that.\n\nAs for the horner scheme--our experiments suggested that the expensive operation was multiplication (in large degree unramified extensions). For example, In R.<a> = Zq(37<sup>100</sup>,100), addition of two random elements takes ~80 micro seconds, while muliplication takes ~80 milli seconds. My naive guess is that cacheing the powers of frob_a in the dictionary and paying the cost of addition will be much faster than paying the repeated cost of multiplication. In any case, storing the powers in a dict or computing the polynomials via horner are much faster than the previous method of computing frobenius.",

We redid the Newton iteration in _frob_gen() because that was easier (for me) than finding & adapting an existing method. The only method I see is .hensel_lift(p,e) in  sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial, and I don't see the advantage of adapting that.

As for the horner scheme--our experiments suggested that the expensive operation was multiplication (in large degree unramified extensions). For example, In R.<a> = Zq(37<sup>100</sup>,100), addition of two random elements takes ~80 micro seconds, while muliplication takes ~80 milli seconds. My naive guess is that cacheing the powers of frob_a in the dictionary and paying the cost of addition will be much faster than paying the repeated cost of multiplication. In any case, storing the powers in a dict or computing the polynomials via horner are much faster than the previous method of computing frobenius.

I just tested the Horner method and it is roughly 10 times slower in Zq(5<sup>100</sup>,100). It seems that multiplying elements of the extension by elements in Q_p is very fast, but multiplying elements in the extension is generally slow. Cacheing the expensive multiplications  (and maybe performing more multiplications over all) appears to be a good strategy in very high degree.
