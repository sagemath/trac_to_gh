The Frobenius automorphism of *p*-adic fields was added in #8241.  The implementation is horribly inefficient and should use Hensel lifting directly rather than decomposing into a list of Teichmuller representatives.

This optimization should probably wait on #12555.

Depends on #14304

The method that needs to be improved is `frobenius_unram` in `src/sage/libs/linkages/padics/unram_shared.pxi`.  This may want to wait on some more p-adic polynomial developments, but could also be done now.

I don't understand why you need to redo Newton iteration in `frobenius_unram`.

Alternatively, instead of storing the powers of `frob_a` in a dictonary, you can use Horner scheme.

I just tested the Horner method and it is roughly 10 times slower in Zq(5<sup>100</sup>,100). It seems that multiplying elements of the extension by elements in Q_p is very fast, but multiplying elements in the extension is generally slow. Cacheing the expensive multiplications  (and maybe performing more multiplications over all) appears to be a good strategy in very high degree.
