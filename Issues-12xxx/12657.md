The Frobenius automorphism of *p*-adic fields was added in #8241.  The implementation is horribly inefficient and should use Hensel lifting directly rather than decomposing into a list of Teichmuller representatives.

This optimization should probably wait on #12555.

I just tested the Horner method and it is roughly 10 times slower in Zq(5<sup>100</sup>,100). It seems that multiplying elements of the extension by elements in Q_p is very fast, but multiplying elements in the extension is generally slow. Cacheing the expensive multiplications  (and maybe performing more multiplications over all) appears to be a good strategy in very high degree.

    "body": "<a id='comment:21'></a>Let me disagree :-).\n\nOn my laptop, with your current implementation, it takes about 1s to compute the Frobenius of a random element over `Zq(5^100,100)` (without taking in account the computation of the Frobenius of the generator) while it takes less than 0.1s using the Horner scheme (cf implementation attached). It is then about 10 times faster.\n\nBy the way, as far as I understand, an element of Zq is representated as P(a) where a is the generator and P is a polynomial over Z. What we do currently is to write all the coefficients of P in radix p (this is done by the method `list`), and then just after recompose them into actual integers. It would be better to avoid this useful computation and access directly to the coefficients of P but I'm not sure it's easy to do it.",

<a id='comment:21'></a>Let me disagree :-).

On my laptop, with your current implementation, it takes about 1s to compute the Frobenius of a random element over `Zq(5^100,100)` (without taking in account the computation of the Frobenius of the generator) while it takes less than 0.1s using the Horner scheme (cf implementation attached). It is then about 10 times faster.

By the way, as far as I understand, an element of Zq is representated as P(a) where a is the generator and P is a polynomial over Z. What we do currently is to write all the coefficients of P in radix p (this is done by the method `list`), and then just after recompose them into actual integers. It would be better to avoid this useful computation and access directly to the coefficients of P but I'm not sure it's easy to do it.
