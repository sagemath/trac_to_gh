The Frobenius automorphism of *p*-adic fields was added in #8241.  The implementation is horribly inefficient and should use Hensel lifting directly rather than decomposing into a list of Teichmuller representatives.

This optimization should probably wait on #12555.

I wanted to say that you redid Newton iteration in `_frob_gen()` and in `frobenius_unram()`. Is there a reason for that? 

> As for the horner scheme--our experiments suggested that the expensive operation was multiplication (in large degree unramified extensions). For example, In R.<a> = Zq(37<sup>100</sup>,100), addition of two random elements takes ~80 micro seconds, while muliplication takes ~80 milli seconds. My naive guess is that cacheing the powers of frob_a in the dictionary and paying the cost of addition will be much faster than paying the repeated cost of multiplication. In any case, storing the powers in a dict or computing the polynomials via horner are much faster than the previous method of computing frobenius.


I don't understand why Horner method is more costly in terms of multiplications. On the contrary, I think that it is (a bit) less costly.
