The Frobenius automorphism of *p*-adic fields was added in #8241.  The implementation is horribly inefficient and should use Hensel lifting directly rather than decomposing into a list of Teichmuller representatives.

This optimization should probably wait on #12555.

Depends on #14304

The method that needs to be improved is `frobenius_unram` in `src/sage/libs/linkages/padics/unram_shared.pxi`.  This may want to wait on some more p-adic polynomial developments, but could also be done now.

I don't understand why you need to redo Newton iteration in `frobenius_unram`.

Alternatively, instead of storing the powers of `frob_a` in a dictonary, you can use Horner scheme.

I just tested the Horner method and it is roughly 10 times slower in Zq(5<sup>100</sup>,100). It seems that multiplying elements of the extension by elements in Q_p is very fast, but multiplying elements in the extension is generally slow. Cacheing the expensive multiplications  (and maybe performing more multiplications over all) appears to be a good strategy in very high degree.

Fantastic! I see your implementation of Horner is much better than what I was doing, and I have reproduced the performance increase on k8s: After `_frob_gen()` is cached, your scheme computes frobenius of random elements of ` Zq(5^100,100) ` in approximately 60 ms, while the previous method was taking 800ms. Your current implementation is definitely the way to go (and is roughly 1000 times faster than what is currently in Sage)

Replying to [@xcaruso](#comment%3A21):
> Let me disagree :-).

> On my laptop, with your current implementation, it takes about 1s to compute the Frobenius of a random element over `Zq(5^100,100)` (without taking in account the computation of the Frobenius of the generator) while it takes less than 0.1s using the Horner scheme (cf implementation attached). It is then about 10 times faster.

> By the way, as far as I understand, an element of Zq is representated as P(a) where a is the generator and P is a polynomial over Z. What we do currently is to write all the coefficients of P in radix p (this is done by the method `list`), and then just after recompose them into actual integers. It would be better to avoid this useful computation and access directly to the coefficients of P but I'm not sure it's easy to do it.

maybe the iteration `+    for i in range(len(coefs)):`
could be replaced by just `+    for ci in coefs:` ?
