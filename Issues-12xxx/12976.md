Define

```
sage: P.<x,y>=QQ[]
sage: J = P*[P.random_element() for _ in range(100)]
```

**__Hash is broken__**

`J.__hash__` is:

```
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(str(self))
```
However, `J.__cmp__` does the mathematically correct thing and relies on comparison of Gröbner bases.

Hence, two ideals with different string representation can be equal. That's bad!

```
sage: I = P*J.groebner_basis()
sage: I == J
True
sage: hash(I)==hash(J)
False
```

**__Hash is slow__**

Computing the string representation is unnecessarily slow - by a factor of 3000:

```
sage: %timeit h = hash(J)
125 loops, best of 3: 4.03 ms per loop
sage: g = J.gens()
sage: %timeit h = hash(g)
625 loops, best of 3: 1.84 µs per loop
```

**__Question__**

If the hash is requested then typically (in dictionaries etc) one would like to compare as well. Hence, the Gröbner basis will be computed anyway. I suggest to rely on the hash of the Gröbner basis. Timing (if the Gröbner basis is already cached):

```
sage: %timeit h = hash(J.groebner_basis())
625 loops, best of 3: 2.31 µs per loop
```

The question is whether the hash can rely on a Gröbner basis.

Moreover, I suggest to cache the hash.

I guess both suggestions would break many things. With the first suggestion, in particular we had to decide how to deal with Singular attributes for use in Singular functions (see #12977).

I guess Burcin and Michael have an opinion on hashing ideals as well...
