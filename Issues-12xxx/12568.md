I am using sage 4.8 with GNU make 3.81. When I am in `SAGE_ROOT`, if I type the commands `make test` or `make micro_release`, the shell returns an error. For `make micro_release`, the it returns the following output:

```
. local/bin/sage-env && local/bin/sage-micro_release
local/bin/sage-env: 289: Bad substitution
mkdir: cannot create directory `//matplotlib-1.0.1': Permission denied
local/bin/sage-env: 475: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
make: *** [micro_release] Error 2
```
For `make test`, it returns a longer output which ends with:

```
. local/bin/sage-env && sage-maketest
local/bin/sage-env: 289: Bad substitution
mkdir: cannot create directory `//matplotlib-1.0.1': Permission denied
local/bin/sage-env: 475: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
make: *** [test] Error 2
```
The problem appears to be because make runs each command as a sh script, but that sage-env is a bash script. A similar error message appears if I type `. local/bin/sage-env` in interactive sh.

I was a little too fast on this.
Are we sure that bash will be installed on every system sage supports (and is it a sage dependency) ?
I fear that explicitely calling bash might fail even if a compatible shell is installed.

I think a better solution would be modify the sage-env header to something like "#! /usr/bin/env bash".
By the way, this file should be executable.

What's more mysterious is why it tries to strip libpython now.
It was updated to 2.7 in the 5.0 series but is still readonly.

In fact it did already segfault with 4.8.
It's just that because I used system atlas libs with my 4.8 install, it did fail before.
