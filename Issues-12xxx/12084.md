Ticket #8334 inappropriately changed the following test in `sage/tests/french_book/number_theory.py`:

```
sage: R = GF(9,name='x'); R
Finite Field in x of size 3^2
sage: Q.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(3))
sage: R2 = GF(9,name='x',modulus=x^2+1); R2
Finite Field in x of size 3^2
sage: p = R(x+1); R2(p)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to coerce from a finite field other than the prime subfield
```
to instead raise a `NotImplementedError`.  The original behavior was restored in #8335, but that ticket has stagnated.

We add a patch to restore the original error message and type.

David, on top of 4.7.2 it works for me:

```
[zimmerma@coing finite_rings]$ sage -t finite_field_givaro.py
sage -t  "devel/sage-12084/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_givaro.py"
         [4.8 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.8 seconds
```
Did you apply another patch which would be in conflict with that one?
