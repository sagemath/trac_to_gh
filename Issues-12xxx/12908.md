```
In the LaTeX representation of a multivariate polynomial is an unnecessary blank when variable is concatenated with a `-`, see 

```
sage: R.<X,Y> = ZZ[]
sage: latex(X-Y)
X -  Y
sage: latex(X^2-X)
X^{2} -  X
```
It does not happen with `+`

```
sage: latex(X+Y)
X + Y
```
or with a constant

```
sage: latex(X-1) 
X - 1
```
In the univarate case the problem does not appear.

Note that this "wrong" output is no problem (i.e. a correct input for LaTeX)

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Does this really need a fix? The latex output can be used in two ways:
1. Input to a latex document.
2. Display on the notebook with typeset.
In both the cases, the output will be fine.

The attached patch removes the unnecessary blank.

But now we also have

```
sage: latex(-X^2-X)
-X^{2} - X
```
instead of

```
sage: latex(-X^2-X)
- X^{2} - X
```
Is this reasonable or should we find a solution to keep the blank between the leading variable and its sign ("`-`")?

So why do we need one if it's a multivariate polynomial?

IMO it should be consistent.

Replying to [@a-andre](#comment%3A4):

Yes, and this means that there is always exactly one space, if it is missing, it is the same "bug" as with double spaces or even worse since it makes reading more difficult and interferes with word wrapping.

A more useful LaTeX alteration than decreasing spaces would be getting rid of `{}` around singletons, i.e. instead of `x_{1}^{2}` it would be better to have `x_1^2`, again for reasons of readability and subsequent "manual manipulations". Macaulay2 is making such a change, as can be seen in one of the failing tests here:

```

On a side note, I would like to vote that the space between the sign and leading term should not be there.  I am new to sage and trac, but I prefer

```
-X - Y
```
as opposed to

```
- X - Y
```

The leading negative indicates an inverse where as the subtraction between objects is an operation (adding an inverse).  That is:

```
-X + -Y = -X - Y
```

Since the original patch has the same problems applying, I will change the status to needs work.

Are there any particular style guidelines that recommend smaller space for unitary minus? I personally prefer the same space as for binary for consistency.

FWIW, Don Knuth doesn't use spaces in his `TeXbook`. A better style guide you won't get.

Dear Durgesh,

1) Welcome aboard !

2) About your proposal :

Replying to [@durgeshra](#comment%3A20):

[ Snip... ]

> Done.

A better way to pass that information would have been to change the state of the ticket to `needs_work` : this way, all people working (or having worked) on that ticket would have received the (useful) info that a proposed fix needed review.

I'll try to have a look later this week-end (possibly today).

[ Snip... ]

> Sorry for the nitpicks but that's why it's nice for new contributors to start with an easy ticket :)  Looks like you're almost there.

Ahem...

Apart from (justifiable) nitpickings, this (correct) fix breaks three other doctests that rely on a specific latex representation :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 144.0 src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/graded_ring_element.py  # 1 doctest failed

sage -t --long --warn-long 144.0 src/sage/algebras/weyl_algebra.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Here are the errors :

In all cases, the change introduced by the  ticket gives a correct LaTeX representation, differing just by the amount of space. These doctests should be fixed.
