A function like

```
cpdef long foo()
```
will confuse the coverage script: it will look for "long foo" in the docstring instead of "foo".

**Apply** [attachment: 12755_coverage_cython.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12755/12755_coverage_cython.patch.gz) to the SCRIPTS repository.
