An adic language is a symbolic counterpart to the renormalization in dynamics and generalize what are called "substitution fixed point" (roughly implemented in sage/combinat/words/). Such kind of languages are described by an infinite sequence of substitutions and many algorithms exist
* enumeration of words of length n
* enumeration of left/right special factors
* synchronization delays
* ...

Particular cases should be consider apart:
* Sturmian languages
* Interval Exchange Transformations
* Free Group Automorphisms
* ...
