<a id='comment:33'></a>Finally, I've implemented a faster algorithm with better complexity with respect to `p`.

I've also added doctests demonstrating that the computation of the `n`th root works over various fields (including those having, or having almost, `p`th or `p^2`th roots of unity).

There are still failing doctests but they are due to the bug reported in #25990.
