I've tried to break changes into several patches, although they got bigger and bigger. However, despite of the total size, these patches should be easy to review as they don't do anything deep - a few conversion methods, a few deprecations, and a lot of doctest changes due to different output formatting.

Personally, I am quite pleased with the results - while some calls got a few more characters, one of the most important methods for cones and fans now produces convenient output with a detailed but not repeated description of the ambient lattice. This worked especially well for quotients and sublattices, whose description was not obvious from ray output before. Hopefully, that's not just my point of view and the changes are objectively for the best ;-)

I have #11599 in the beginning of my queue now, so this ticket is based on top of it.

After sleeping on it and thinking some more:

Overriding `_repr_` is not acceptable, as it makes computations not reproducible by others (unless they also do the same overriding, but understanding it requires some knowledge of Sage internal conventions).

Looking at matrices with rays/points/vectors as columns is not just my invention, e.g. PALP, which is familiar to a number of people, does it as well as long as the matrix fits the terminal. Then it switches to row vectors (the switch, I think, is quite confusing). It is also quite common practice in linear algebra as I was reminded recently having to cover some classes. And that's why Rob Beezer added `column_matrix` constructor.

So I think that:
* The representation should not change depending on dimension or number of rays.
* To make it fit on the terminal, it is better to use one line per ray.
* I still think that it is the best for typeset notebook version to have rays as columns, so I really want to have it as an option.
* I don't see what is the problem with having a function like `sage.geometry.point_collection.default_representation` which allows you switch between lists and matrices or anything else, it just makes Sage more flexible and provides a standard way of adjusting it rather than hacking its guts.
* It is indeed confusing when `rays.matrix()` returns the transpose of the matrix in representation.

To address all of this, I propose:
* Default text output as was shown above, in particular, that's what will be used in all doctests.
* Default LaTeX output similar to it, packing it into array for alignment.
* Add a method `rays.column_matrix()` which returns the matrix with rays as columns. This would make it consistent with `matrix(rays)` and `column_matrix(rays)`.
* Add a function for changing the output to other forms, most of all "rays as columns" which will refer to the method `column_matrix`  to describe it: all confusion should be gone, I'll be happy, and the default output will be as you prefer, so to me it sounds like a reasonable compromise.

It could be awesome to draw vertical lines between columns to indicate the direction of rays, but jsMath swallows them, so what's the point...

Replying to [novoselt](#comment%3A22):
> PALP, which is familiar to a number of people, does it as well as long as the matrix fits the terminal. Then it switches to row vectors (the switch, I think, is quite confusing).

Thats why PALP suddenly returns transposed matrices?? Is that anywhere documented? I've observed this behavior but never figured out why PALP does that. That is really a terrible design choice for a program so technical that most people will want to parse its output.

> * I don't see what is the problem with having a function like `sage.geometry.point_collection.default_representation` which allows you switch between lists and matrices or anything else

The way I see it, the only difference between 

```
sage.geometry.point_collection.default_representation = my_print_func
``` 
and 

```
sage.geometry.cone.ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone._repr_ = my_print_func
```
is that I'll never discover the former, while the latter is the familiar monkey-patching that you can do with any Python module. If you really want to call it `default_representation` then I'm not totally opposed, but nobody is going to use it because nobody is going to find out that its there.

This patch breaks the following code:

```
P3 = toric_varieties.P(3)
Sigma3 = P3.fan()
point_rays = [sum(sigma.rays()) for sigma in Sigma3]
BlP3 = P3.resolve(new_rays=point_rays)
K = BlP3.Kaehler_cone()
K._split_ambient_lattice()
```
The reason is that the ray matrix is constructed over rational field (because K lives in the rational divisor class group) and Smith form does not do what was intended. I am not yet sure what has to be tweaked here. It seems that creating a cone explicitly in some rational vector space `V` rather than some sublattice of it is completely reasonable. But it is still possible to choose ray generators in the sublattice, I guess in `span(ZZ, V.gens())`?..

OK, how about this variant:
* class method `PointCollection.output_format` that affects both text and LaTeX representation and is visible to those who will look at TAB-completion;
* default text representation as described above, with line breaks and coordinate alignment;
* default LaTeX representation as a tuple (i.e. as it was but with lattice subscript) - aligning coordinates which are wrapped in \left( and \right) it a bit hard, those who want alignment are welcome to switch to matrices.

The new patch does all this and fixes all doctests in `point_collection` module so they show how it works now. If you are OK with this look and approach, I'll fix doctest formatting in all other files.
