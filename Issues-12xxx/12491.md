Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A7):
> What's up with the indirect stuff?  I assume this is for `sage -coverage`?


Yes, exactly. The review patch looks good to me.

By the way, is it an issue that the instances of the `_Coordinates` class don't seem to be picklable?

But if I add a `TestSuite` doctest, it fails: if I make this change:
