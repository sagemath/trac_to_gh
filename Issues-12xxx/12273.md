Kent Morrison tried to get the length of a Python list but of course then you have to know `len` is the command.  We should either/or/and:
* Have a command in functional notation that is more obvious to non-Python folks
* Somehow have a dot-tab-completion command for this (probably not possible)
* Add something really obvious in several places in the documentation, since he couldn't find it and is smart.
