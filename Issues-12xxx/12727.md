This is far from being critical but

```
Verify that Trac #12727 is fixed:: 
```
could be better written as

```
Verify that :trac:`12727` is fixed:: 
```
which setup the link !

Apply trac_12727-whitespace-removed.patch

William's patch had trailing whitespace on one line, which the patchbot didn't like. Other than that it's fine -- I extend my positive review to this new patch.
