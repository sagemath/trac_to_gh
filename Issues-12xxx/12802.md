There seems to be no way to test containment of ideals in the class MPolynomialIdeal in `sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal`.  One might expect the comparison operators (e.g. `I<J` ) to do this, but in fact what they do is to compare the Groebner bases as sequences of polynomials, which is counterintuitive. For example:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I=(x*y)*R; J=(x,y)*R; I<J
False
sage: I=(y+1)*R; J=(x,y)*R; I<J
True
```
This is implemented in the `__cmp__` method, which is not up to the task of doing subset comparison, since `__cmp__` is only suitable for total orderings.

To do it right would seem to require implementing Python's "rich comparison" methods, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, etc.

For example:

```
from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal import MPolynomialIdeal

def IsSubset(I,J):
  for g in I.gens()
    if not g in J: return False
  return True

def IsSuperset(I,J):
  return IsSubset(J,I)

def IsProperSubset(I,J):
  return I!=J and IsSubset(I,J)

def IsProperSuperset(I,J):
  return I!J and IsSuperset(I,J)

setattr(MPolynomialIdeal,'__le__',IsSubset)
setattr(MPolynomialIdeal,'__lt__',IsProperSubset)
setattr(MPolynomialIdeal,'__ge__',IsSuperset)
setattr(MPolynomialIdeal,'__gt__',IsProperSuperset)
```
With these we now get the expected behavior:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I=(x*y)*R; J=(x,y)*R; I<J
True
sage: I=(y+1)*R; J=(x,y)*R; I<J
False
```
The patch supplied gives a solution via Groebner bases, and also fixes #12839.

Okay, so the problems were real, but were discovered because there's a very weird test of elements of quadratic number fields: basically, if a and b are distinct elements of a quadratic number field, then a>b and b>a are always true:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
sage: a > a + 1
True
```
That strikes me as really, really **odd** behavior.

Anyway, I'm about to upload a new patch that undoes the stupidity I did to `sage.rings.ideal.py`, adds some documentation to the `__cmp__` function in `Ideal_generic`, then takes care of the things that need taking care of down in `sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_idea.py`.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

To help the reviewer(s), here are the non-whitespace changes.

1. In `sage/rings/ideal.py`, I added a docstring & doctest to `Ideal_generic`'s `__cmp__`.
2. In `sage/rings/polynomial/multipolynomial_ideal.py`, I
   a. redefined `__cmp__` to rely on `__lt__`, `__gt__`, and `__eq__`;
   b. changed `__eq__` to test whether each ideal is a subset of the other;
   c. changed `__gt__` to test whether `other` is a subset of `self`; and
   d. moved the old code for `__eq__` to `__lt__`, where it now checks whether each polynomial in the Groebner basis of `self` reduces to 0 modulo the Groebner basis of `other`. Here, I also had to move a `try...except` loop around, because of a strange `AttributeError` related to caching, raised **only** by the doctests of `pbori.pyx`.

On my machine all the doctests of `sage/rings` pass with this patch. I haven't doctested everything, though.

1. `__cmp__` does not return the result of ``self == other`` contrary to what is written. I also think that the test should call cmp directly, since `==` does not always lead to `cmp`.
2. In `__lt__` the documentation says "We use ideal membership to test whether the generators of each ideal appears in the other." while only one of the containment directions should be checked.

Compare #12976: If you work on comparison of ideals, you should perhaps also consider the fact that ideals evaluating as equal may have different hash, because the hash relies on the string representation (hence, on the generators), but the comparison relies on Gröbner bases. So, the hash is broken (and is rather slow, too).

Also, there is one thing you didn't fix: If the Gröbner basis of *only one* of the two to-be-compared ideals is not in the cache, then a *copy* of the two ideals is created using degrevlex term order, and then the Gröbner basis is computed in the supposedly easier order. However, the ring change happens even if the ideals already are in degrevlex order, and moreover the result of the Gröbner basis computation is not cached. For that problem, I had already opened #12987.

By the way, good that you do *not* try to change comparison of polynomial ideals into a generator-wise comparison - the ticket description let the impression arise that you want to drop Gröbner bases.

How should one proceed? Fix the "useless double-computation of Gröbner bases of copies of ideals" here? Then this ticket is "needs work", and #12987 is a duplicate. Or fix it at #12987? Then I have to add this ticket as a new dependency for #12987.

Possible idea: One could create an attribute `_gb_by_term_order_` that is a dictionary storing the Gröbner bases of an ideal with respect to different orders. Hence, when doing a comparison and computing the Gröbner basis of a *copy* of ideal J in "degrevlex" order (while J lives in a ring with different order), then `J._gb_by_term_order_["degrevlex"]` should store the result.

A related topic: Avoid using comparison and hash when passing argument attributes in singular_function. See #12977 (needs review).

Another thing: This ticket's component should be "commutative algebra", not "algebra". And I guess Martin should be Cc.

So, the hash is broken (and is rather slow, too).

I don't understand the issue with the hash, probably because I don't know anything about how Sage hashes rings, ideals, etc. I can look into this, but: the code ignores the hash altogether, and a Groebner basis is only computed for a copy; the original ideal is untouched. So, how could this patch break the hash?

When I run the example you provide in #12987, I get this:

```
sage: %timeit J==J2
5 loops, best of 3: 534 ms per loop
sage: _ = J.groebner_basis()
sage: %timeit J==J2
5 loops, best of 3: 533 ms per loop
sage: _ = J2.groebner_basis()
sage: %timeit J==J2
5 loops, best of 3: 533 ms per loop
```
So it's even worse than you say; it's not that I didn't fix it; I've actually broken something there. (I don't think this is the hash; correct me if I'm wrong.) That third timeit is definitely a lot slower with this patch installed.

IMHO, rings and ideals ought to be independent of term orderings, which the user ought to be able to switch without creating a new ring & ideal. A Groebner basis of an ideal could be stored in a dictionary for each different term ordering requested. As far as I can tell, this isn't possible now, and I don't know if it's feasible at all, given the reliance on Singular.

But, your proposal:

> One could create an attribute `_gb_by_term_order_` that is a dictionary storing the Gröbner bases of an ideal with respect to different orders.

...seems similar. Do you think a long-term fix of making rings independent of term orderings would be worth looking at?

> Hence, when doing a comparison and computing the Gröbner basis of a *copy* of ideal J in "degrevlex" order (while J lives in a ring with different order), then `J._gb_by_term_order_["degrevlex"]` should store the result.

This can, of course, be done now. I will try to work on it over the next few days.

> By the way, good that you do *not* try to change comparison of polynomial ideals into a generator-wise comparison - the ticket description let the impression arise that you want to drop Gröbner bases.

FWIW, I didn't write that part. I wrote the part where I said we *would* use Groebner bases. ;-)

> How should one proceed? Fix the "useless double-computation of Gröbner bases of copies of ideals" here? Then this ticket is "needs work", and #12987 is a duplicate. Or fix it at #12987? Then I have to add this ticket as a new dependency for #12987.

I think it better to mark #12987 as a duplicate in that case, the same way #12839 is a duplicate, and fix this issue here, at least with your proposed approach. I can certainly do that.

> Another thing: This ticket's component should be "commutative algebra"...

I agree.

>

That's how Python uses the hash: Python's dictionaries and sets are hash tables. Hence, whenever you use an ideal J (or any other object) as a key in a dictionary D or put it into a set S, then the hash is computed, and the object is put into a "bucket" that corresponds to the hash value.

If you then have an object G (say, the ideal that is given by the reduced Gröbner basis of J) and want to test whether G is in D or S (say, `D[G]` or `G in S`), then the hash of G is computed, and then **only the bucket corresponding to the hash of G** is searched for an equal object. The buckets typically are very small. Hence, if you have a quick hash function then searching in a set is much faster than searching in a list.

Now, a problem arises if `G==J` but `hash(G)!=hash(J)`: G and J may end up in *different* buckets, and thus `G in S` would return False, even though `J in S and J==G`.

Summary: It is required by Python that the hash values of equal objects are equal. Otherwise, the hash is called "broken".

> I can look into this, but: the code ignores the hash altogether, and a Groebner basis is only computed for a copy; the original ideal is untouched. So, how could this patch break the hash?

I did not claim that the patch breaks the hash. I merely stated that the hash **is** broken (see #12976), and I asked whether we should extend the patch here so that the hash is fixed, or whether we leave the hash broken for now.

No, there is no hash involved here.

That sounds nice at first glance. However, it would be awkward to ask for providing a term order as a new argument to the groebner_basis() method. And there are many algorithms that rely on Gröbner bases. So, I believe having a default term order for each ring (and thus have different rings for different term orders) is fine, IMHO.

I see; the hash has been broken a while. I can suggest a quick hash function, actually: compute a Groebner basis of the *homogenized* ideal **up to degree** *d* for some small value of *d*. (Standard homogenization, if there's any doubt.)

Figuring out a good value of *d* would be the hard part.

Alternately, *d* could be computed based on the generators, though I'm not sure how to do that quite yet. (max degree + 1? could get very, very expensive for some ideals)

This seems to me the safest way to provide a relatively quick signature for an ideal that ensures equal ideals with different presentations are in the same bucket, at the cost of several distinct ideals sharing the same bucket.

I wasn't thinking of eliminating a a *default* ordering for a ring that extends automatically to its ideals; that makes sense. I would just like the option to switch the default ordering of a ring or ideal, without having to create a new ring and/or ideal, *and* retaining the previously-computed Groebner basis, if desired.

This annoyance has actually come up in my work. I suspect a fix would require a serious re-thinking, since so many things rely on Groebner bases, and many have likely been written with the current framework in mind.

Perhaps one could make ideals non-hashable? After all, what one needs in applications (to my experience) is the tuple of generators of the ideal.

OK.

Sorry, have to catch a bus. I hope I don't forget to answer later. But perhaps Nicolas beats me to it?

My understanding of what you wrote is that several objects can occupy the same hash value, and when comparisons need to be made, something more computationally expensive is called: `__eq__`, perhaps. (I wasn't sure exactly which.) That strikes me as what [this page](http://wiki.python.org/moin/DictionaryKeys) is saying, too, though I am not entirely sure.

We'd have to pick a "good" term order for the hash, just as we currently pick a "good" term order to test whether ideals are equal, if no Groebner basis currently exists.

> And how should one choose * d* ? After all, if you compute a Gröbner basis out to degree * d*  but there are further elements in higher degree, then the * complete*  Gröbner basis will have a different hash.

Well, yes, I said that, myself.

But the homogenized ideals' Groebner bases are different, regardless of degree. If one dehomogenizes, it works out, but this is already getting pretty ugly.

I'm okay with that, too. Are ideals mutable? If so, the answer is easy.

To my thinking, ideals *are* hashable in principle; just use a Groebner basis wrt to any order at all. It's the computation of the hash that's potentially horrifying. Do you know if Python calls `__hash__` when the ideal is created, or when it's actually required? If it's the latter, rather than the former, we could simply compute a hash by computing the degrevlex Groebner basis, and be done with it. No one would encounter the performance penalty until they actually tried to use it.

I don't think they are mutable.

Yes, that's exactly the problem. One can compare ideals and can compute a reasonable hash effectively, but probably there is no way to do that efficiently in a way that preserves the mathematical notion of equality of ideals (namely: Equality as a sub-set of a ring).

> Do you know if Python calls `__hash__` when the ideal is created, or when it's actually required?

No. The hash is only computed when it is needed (hence, when the ideal is put into a set or dictionary). The following toy example should illustrate what is called when:

```
sage: class Foo:
....:     def __init__(self, n):
....:         self.n = n
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         print "computing hash for",self.n
....:         return int(self.n%10)
....:     def __cmp__(self, other):
....:         print "comparing",self.n,"with",other.n
....:         return cmp(self.n, other.n)
....:     
sage: a = Foo(5)
sage: b = Foo(6)
sage: c = Foo(15)
sage: a2 = Foo(5)
sage: a == a2
comparing 5 with 5
True
sage: a == b
comparing 5 with 6
False
sage: D = {}
sage: D[a] = 1
computing hash for 5
sage: D[a]
computing hash for 5
1
sage: D[b] = 2
computing hash for 6
sage: D[c] = 5
computing hash for 15
comparing 5 with 15
```

As you can see in the last line, the hash of c is computed, which I made coincide with the hash of a. So, they are put into the same hash bucket, and thus a comparison happens. But the line before, no comparison happens, because the hash bucket for b is empty when it is added to the dictionary.

In particular, normally the hash is not computed during initialisation. However, due to caching a lot of stuff in the category and coercion framework, it could very well be that the hash is created during `__init__`. I don't think that is the case for ideals, though.

> If it's the latter, rather than the former, we could simply compute a hash by computing the degrevlex Groebner basis, and be done with it. No one would encounter the performance penalty until they actually tried to use it...

... which is not unlikely. Currently, ideals *are* used in dictionaries, for example in singular_function, when trying to convince Singular that the given generators of some ideal form a Gröbner basis. That's why I try to provide a faster (though syntactically less elegant) way to provide information on the arguments of singular_function (see #12977).

I'm about to upload a new patch that uses Simon's `_gb_by_ordering` idea. Here are the timings on the same machine as the other day:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
<+ 30*y + 25, 1/400*x^4*y^4 - 1/5*x^5*y^2 - 1/20*x^4*y^3 + 4*x^6 + 2*x^5*y + 11/20*x^4*y^2 - 12*x^5 - 3*x^4*y + 9*x^4]*P

sage: _ = J.groebner_basis()
sage: %timeit J==J2         
625 loops, best of 3: 372 µs per loop
sage: _ = J2.groebner_basis()
sage: %timeit J==J2
625 loops, best of 3: 362 µs per loop
```
A more than 1000-fold increase. :-)

All tests in sage/rings pass muster, as do the tests in schemes that had failed the other day.

That just leads to silently incorrect code. If you want to sort on `id` you can do sort(L,key=id)

```
sage: sorted([-10,-11,123,124,1000],key=id)
[123, -10, -11, 124, 1000]
sage: sorted([-10,-11,123,124,1000],key=id)
[124, 1000, 123, -10, -11]
sage: sorted([-10,-11,123,124,1000],key=id)
[-11, 124, 123, -10, 1000]
```
I'm curious to see a useful application of this.

This is all a bit off-topic, though. There IS precedent in python to use `<` for partial ordering.

```
sage: set([2])<set([1,2,3])
True
sage: set([1,2,3])<set([3])
False
sage: set([1,2,3])<set([4,5])
False
sage: set([4,5])<set([1,2,3])
False
```
so supporting this for ideals should be fine. I'd throw an error if the ideals are "incompatible" for comparison (according to coercion rules for common covering structure, I'd say), but `False` would be consistent too (it's a partial ordering, after all).
