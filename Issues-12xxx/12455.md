As discussed in [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/f458d0f9cfd89c9a).

Currently sage can evaluate airy functions numerically:

```
sage: airy_ai(1.4)
0.0820380498076
```

but it doesn't work symbolically

```
sage: airy_ai(x)
...
TypeError: Cannot evaluate symbolic expression to a numeric value.
```

We should make it symbolical for both airy_ai and airy_bi, as well as their derivatives.

Depends on #12289
Depends on #17130

Attachment: **[trac_12455-symbolic_airy.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12455/trac_12455-symbolic_airy.patch.gz)**

I've added a patch, which should do the job, but it has a few shortcomings:

1.-The resulting symbolic functions seem to remain on hold:

```
sage: airy_ai(1.0)
airy_ai(1.00000000000000)
```
You need to force it to evaluate:

```
sage: airy_ai(1.0).n()
0.135292416313
```

2.- This doesn't work:

```
sage: airy_ai(2.0).n(digits=100)
0.0349241304233
```
3.- There is no evaluation for airy_ai_prime or airy_bi_prime

4.- I'm not sure about how should the functions be called, some possible schemes are

{ai,bi,aip,bip}
{ai,bai,aip,baip}
{airy_ai,airy_bi,airy_ai_prime,airy_bi_prime}

And also whether the latex representation should be capitalized or not. I chose the third scheme, and capitalized typesetting.

On second thought, I think it would be better to use the airy equation to calculate derivatives or order higher than 1. Like

```
sage: airy_ai(2,x)
x*airy_ai(x)
sage: airy_ai(3,x)
airy_ai(x)+x*airy_ai_prime(x)
sage: diff(airy_ai(x),x,2)
x*airy_ai(x)
sage: diff(airy_ai(x),x,3)
airy_ai(x)+x*airy_ai_prime(x)
```

which is very likey to be the way mpmath calculates higher order derivatives. Integrals however, would be returned as:

```
sage: airy_ai(-1,x)
airy_ai(-1,x)
sage: integral(airy_ai(x),x)
airy_ai(-1,x)
```

what do you think?

However, the first part (the initialization methods) is important for our coverage.   You can just do a couple from the big examples that you have.

Do these pass doctests?  I'm surprised that

It looks like they do:

```
oscar@oscar-netbook:~$ sage -coverage airy.py
sage -t  "/home/oscar/sage/my_patches/airy.py"

I'm just surprised this doesn't cause trouble.  

On another note, this apparently does something weird when applied to 5.0.beta4.   Namely, Sage won't start:

```

ImportError: cannot import name sin
Error importing ipy_profile_sage - perhaps you should run %upgrade?

I'll spare you the rest of the traceback.  I think there is some kind of circular import thing going on here, but I don't understand imports that well.  Perhaps moving the import of airy to further down (after trig functions) would help - that's a totally uninformed guess, of course.

Hi Oscar,
I haven't looked over your patch very closely yet, but I plan to. One comment on first glance: in several places you call

```
return mpmath_utils.call(airy_bi_mpmath, x, derivative=1, parent=RR) 
```

but I think we want to preserve the parent of `x` instead of forcing it to be `RR`. Importing the `parent` function from `sage.structure.coerce` using a different name like `sage_parent` (because as burcin pointed out in one of my tickets, parent is the name of the parameter in `_evalf_`) and doing something like

```
from sage.structure.coerce import parent as sage_parent
R = parent or sage_parent(x)
return mpmath_utils.call(airy_bi_mpmath, x, derivative=1, parent=R)

would do the trick I think.

I found the cause of the problem in comment [comment:17]. There is a circular import going on because

```
from airy import airy_ai, airy_bi
```
occurs at the top of `sage/functions/all.py`. If you move it to the bottom of the file, sage starts just fine.

There a several doctests that fail, however. Oscar, I think that running `sage -coverage` only checks to see if there are doctest for every function, it doesn't actually run the tests. Use

```
sage -t devel/sage/sage/functions/airy.py
```

to run the tests and get feedback.

Okay, I'm posting this for future reference.  I've attempted to preserve as much as possible of the original code while switching to the "new-style" dictionary-argument .n() approach we're working on in #12289, but I'm setting it to "needs work" myself while we think through some of the consequences of the switch.  Some of the `_evalf_` stuff violates DRY and I'm not yet sure of the best way to deal with it.

As well, the patch currently segfaults in testing when it computes beta(0.5, 0.5) due to some problem with the current #12289 package, which I suspect is unrelated.  But I think the new approach is beginning to take shape.

New patch, which should pass all doctests once #12289 is merged.

It makes the following changes:
* Changing an incorrect `airy_bi` identity
* Adding `airy.py` to the documentation
* Checking whether `n` is an integer (for some reason mpmath is able to evaluate numerically with non-integral `n`)
* Formatting changes
* Removing the parent's precision check because it wasn't used
* Removing the check for the `parent` keyword because Burcin told me to

Eviatar, how much would you say still needs to be reviewed?  (In the sense that you have not yet given it positive review.)  Just your patch?

(I'm running doctests now.)

```
Return the `\alpha`-th order fractional derivative with respect to `z`.
```
"Fractional", right?  So ... ?  Plus, you do *not* make this change in airy_bi, only airy_ai, for some reason.

Another question:

```
sage: (plot(airy_bi(x), (x, -10, 5)) +\ 
```
Are we allowing this kind of continuation in doctests still?  I can't remember but seem to recall something about this being a problem.

Otherwise this all seems fine.

[attachment: trac_12455-airy_review.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12455/trac_12455-airy_review.patch.gz) fixes a couple of problems:

* `airy_{a,b}i_general` should evaluate to `airy_{a,b}i_simple`, `airy_{a,b}i_prime`, etc. depending on the first parameter

* differentiating `airy_{a,b}i_general` in the first parameter is not allowed

This is still needs work because we use indirect doctests everywhere. There is no reason to go through the `airy_{a,b}i` wrapper functions.

It's useless, especially when scipy is implemented as algorithm. OTOH, it introduces more code paths to test and deepens a dependency that is unwanted.

Oh, and scipy is a bit faster:

```
sage: timeit("airy_bi(2).n(algorithm='maxima')")
625 loops, best of 3: 685 µs per loop
sage: timeit("airy_bi(2).n(algorithm='scipy')")
625 loops, best of 3: 124 µs per loop
```

Everything was reviewed up to my recent changes:

* merged develop
* removal of maxima and inclusion of scipy for numerics
* replacement of indirect with direct doctests (still 100% coverage)
* removal of hold_derivate keyword from `airy_ai/bi_general()` where it wasn't implemented (it is still in `airy_ai/bi()` wrapper functions
* small index at the top of documentation for orientation, because of confusing presentation order of functions, which cannot be controlled, sadly

So please review.

a typo in line 5 of the doc:

```
Airy functions are solutions to the differential equation `f''(z) +f(z)x=0`.
```
The differential equation is wrong, should be `f'' - x f = 0`

Strange typo.

A quick look at old and new code shows 1. `ValueError`, 2. `NotImplementedError`, 3. `assert`. So, this needs to be unified to `NotImplementedError`.
