As discussed in [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/f458d0f9cfd89c9a).

Currently sage can evaluate airy functions numerically:

```
sage: airy_ai(1.4)
0.0820380498076
```

but it doesn't work symbolically

```
sage: airy_ai(x)
...
TypeError: Cannot evaluate symbolic expression to a numeric value.
```

We should make it symbolical for both airy_ai and airy_bi, as well as their derivatives.

Attachment [trac_12455-symbolic_airy.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket12455/trac_12455-symbolic_airy.patch) by olazo created at 2012-02-07 08:05:17

I've added a patch, which should do the job, but it has a few shortcomings:

1.-The resulting symbolic functions seem to remain on hold:

```
sage: airy_ai(1.0)
airy_ai(1.00000000000000)
```
You need to force it to evaluate:

```
sage: airy_ai(1.0).n()
0.135292416313
```

2.- This doesn't work:

```
sage: airy_ai(2.0).n(digits=100)
0.0349241304233
```
3.- There is no evaluation for airy_ai_prime or airy_bi_prime

4.- I'm not sure about how should the functions be called, some possible schemes are

{ai,bi,aip,bip}
{ai,bai,aip,baip}
{airy_ai,airy_bi,airy_ai_prime,airy_bi_prime}

And also whether the latex representation should be capitalized or not. I chose the third scheme, and capitalized typesetting.

On second thought, I think it would be better to use the airy equation to calculate derivatives or order higher than 1. Like

```
sage: airy_ai(2,x)
x*airy_ai(x)
sage: airy_ai(3,x)
airy_ai(x)+x*airy_ai_prime(x)
sage: diff(airy_ai(x),x,2)
x*airy_ai(x)
sage: diff(airy_ai(x),x,3)
airy_ai(x)+x*airy_ai_prime(x)
```

which is very likey to be the way mpmath calculates higher order derivatives. Integrals however, would be returned as:

```
sage: airy_ai(-1,x)
airy_ai(-1,x)
sage: integral(airy_ai(x),x)
airy_ai(-1,x)
```

what do you think?

I just added a new patch. The new version includes generalized derivatives, evaluation with mpmath, and special values of the functions and their derivatives. Just a one doubt, the coverage is:

```
oscar@oscar-netbook:~$ sage -coverage airy.py
SCORE /home/oscar/sage/my_patches/airy.py: 76% (20 of 26)

Missing documentation:
	 * __init__(self):
	 * __init__(self):
	 * __init__(self):
	 * __init__(self):

Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):

	 * _eval_(self, x):
	 * _evalf_(self, x, parent=None):
	 * _derivative_(self, x, diff_param=None):

	 * _derivative_(self, x, diff_param=None):

	 * _derivative_(self, alpha, *args, **kwds):
	 * _eval_(self, alpha, *args):
	 * _evalf_(self, alpha, x, parent=None):
```

Is that important?

```

However, the first part (the initialization methods) is important for our coverage.   You can just do a couple from the big examples that you have.

Do these pass doctests?  I'm surprised that 

```
sage: airy_ai_simple= FunctionAiryAiSimple()
```
would work when you run tests, assuming you didn't import `FunctionAiryAiSimple` into the global namespace.

Anyway, overall on a quick glance this looks great; unfortunately, I won't have time to review it properly soon - hopefully someone else will, because you put a lot of great work into it and we should totally have these symbolic.  Thanks!

It looks like they do:

```
oscar@oscar-netbook:~$ sage -coverage airy.py
sage -t  "/home/oscar/sage/my_patches/airy.py"              
	 [51.5 s]

All tests passed!

```
Why shouldn't they? I'll take care of the __init__ functions.

I'm just surprised this doesn't cause trouble.  

On another note, this apparently does something weird when applied to 5.0.beta4.   Namely, Sage won't start:

```
---> 65 from sage.functions.all import sin, cos

ImportError: cannot import name sin
Error importing ipy_profile_sage - perhaps you should run %upgrade?

New patch, which should pass all doctests once #12289 is merged.

It makes the following changes:
* Changing an incorrect `airy_bi` identity
* Adding `airy.py` to the documentation
* Checking whether `n` is an integer (for some reason mpmath is able to evaluate numerically with non-integral `n`)
* Formatting changes
* Removing the parent's precision check because it wasn't used
* Removing the check for the `parent` keyword because Burcin told me to

But this is even in the documentation you wrote!

```
Return the `\alpha`-th order fractional derivative with respect to `z`.
```
"Fractional", right?  So ... ?  Plus, you do *not* make this change in airy_bi, only airy_ai, for some reason.

Another question:

```
sage: (plot(airy_bi(x), (x, -10, 5)) +\ 
```
Are we allowing this kind of continuation in doctests still?  I can't remember but seem to recall something about this being a problem.

Otherwise this all seems fine.

[attachment:trac_12455-airy_review.patch] fixes a couple of problems:

* `airy_{a,b}i_general` should evaluate to `airy_{a,b}i_simple`, `airy_{a,b}i_prime`, etc. depending on the first parameter

* differentiating `airy_{a,b}i_general` in the first parameter is not allowed

* `_evalf_` should not raise errors for unrecognized algorithm argument


This is still needs work because we use indirect doctests everywhere. There is no reason to go through the `airy_{a,b}i` wrapper functions. We should call the symbolic functions directly in the doctests. There are also a lot of code paths that are not tested. I changed the fractional order behavior, but didn't need to change any doctests.

It would be great if someone else can fix/add doctests. I will move on to something else now.

Replying to [benjaminfjones](#comment%3A43):

It's useless, especially when scipy is implemented as algorithm. OTOH, it introduces more code paths to test and deepens a dependency that is unwanted.

Oh, and scipy is a bit faster:

```
sage: timeit("airy_bi(2).n(algorithm='maxima')")
625 loops, best of 3: 685 µs per loop
sage: timeit("airy_bi(2).n(algorithm='scipy')")
625 loops, best of 3: 124 µs per loop
```

Everything was reviewed up to my recent changes:

* merged develop
* removal of maxima and inclusion of scipy for numerics
* replacement of indirect with direct doctests (still 100% coverage)
* removal of hold_derivate keyword from `airy_ai/bi_general()` where it wasn't implemented (it is still in `airy_ai/bi()` wrapper functions
* small index at the top of documentation for orientation, because of confusing presentation order of functions, which cannot be controlled, sadly

So please review.

a typo in line 5 of the doc:

```
Airy functions are solutions to the differential equation `f''(z) +f(z)x=0`.

The differential equation is wrong, should be `f'' - x f = 0`

Strange typo.
> * Raising a `ValueError` in `FunctionAiryAiGeneral._derivative_` when `diff_param == 0` may not be the most appropriate, since (if I'm not mistaken) the partial derivative would make sense mathematically.
 
A quick look at old and new code shows 1. `ValueError`, 2. `NotImplementedError`, 3. `assert`. So, this needs to be unified to `NotImplementedError`.
> One last thing: IMO `hold_derivative` should be `True` by default in `airy_ai` and `airy_bi`, except perhaps when the differentiation order is one. But I don't know if that's consistent with the way things are done in other parts of sage symbolics. Thoughts?

I believe the code of this ticket is the only one that has such a parameter, so please feel free to improve it.

I have looked at your patch and it's fine, so if you think the rest is OK please set positive.
