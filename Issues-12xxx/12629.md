Linbox has its infamous commentator, regularly causing trouble on various systems.  This commentator can be disabled by building with `-DDISABLE_COMMENTATOR`, this is done in the parts of the Sage library which use Linbox.

But Linbox itself is compiled with the commentator enabled.  The problem is that commentator-enabled code is not compatible with commentator-disabled code because of C++ constructors/destructors.

This causes problems in particular with GCC-4.6.3 (#12369) on OS X 10.4 PPC, but problems with the Linbox commentator have been observed on different systems too.

Proposed solution: **always** disable the commentator by using `-DDISABLE_COMMENTATOR` in the Linbox spkg.  A patch is needed (backported from Linbox-1.2.2) to actually allow building Linbox like this.
