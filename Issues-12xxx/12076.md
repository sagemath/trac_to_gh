I did. And the relocation appears to work properly. I'm mostly just curious about the difference in the `.pc` file.

But Dan and I agree that

```
        config = config.replace(SAGE_ROOT_absolute, "${SAGE_ROOT}")
```
seems to not be happening here for some reason.  But maybe we are parsing it wrong.
