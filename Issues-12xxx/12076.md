The patch here appears to fix the problem, but I notice that the `ogg.pc` file looks a little different from all the others:

```
drake@sagenb:~/s/y5.1.b0/local/lib/pkgconfig$ grep ^prefix= *
bdw-gc.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
freetype2.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
gnutls-extra.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
gnutls.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
gsl.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
libpng12.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
libpng.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
m4ri.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
ogg.pc:prefix=/home/drake/s/5.1b0/local
opencdk.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
pynac.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
python-2.7.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
python.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
sqlite3.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
zlib.pc:prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
```

Observe that only `ogg.pc` has the original `SAGE_ROOT` in its `prefix`; all other files have `prefix` in terms of `SAGE_ROOT`. Is that what we want? Is that okay?

I did. And the relocation appears to work properly. I'm mostly just curious about the difference in the `.pc` file.

I can confirm this problem, and that this patch fixes it, and the patch seems right, just abstracting out something.

But Dan and I agree that

```
        config = config.replace(SAGE_ROOT_absolute, "${SAGE_ROOT}")
```
seems to not be happening here for some reason.  But maybe we are parsing it wrong.
