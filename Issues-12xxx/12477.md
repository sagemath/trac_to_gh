Well, it's as the title says...

The patch just fixes it in the obvious way, and moves some code around to make it easier to read.

(reported by Nicolas Thiéry)

```
sage: g = Graph({1:[2,3]})
sage: rel = {1:'a', 2:'b'}
sage: g.relabel(rel)
sage: g.vertices()
[3, 'a', 'b']
sage: rel
{1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 3}
```
