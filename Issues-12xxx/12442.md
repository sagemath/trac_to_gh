This breaks building with clang.

I've posted an spkg fixes this (and #12441) at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/singular-3-1-3-3.p5.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/singular-3-1-3-3.p5.spkg). (This is a review spkg in case there are more issues with clang down the road.)
