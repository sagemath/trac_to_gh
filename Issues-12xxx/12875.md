Before the patch, the following was wrong (probably introduced by #9138):

```
    sage: End(J0(37)).homset_category()
    Join of Category of hom sets in Category of sets and Category of rings
```

After the patch:

```
    sage: End(J0(37)).homset_category()
    Category of modular abelian varieties over Rational Field
```

In both cases, we have, as desired:

```
    sage: End(J0(37)).category()
    Join of Category of hom sets in Category of sets and Category of rings
```

By the way, this removes a direct call to _Hom_, using Hom instead, preparing for #11935.

Note: #11935 depends on this ticket.

Some small criticism: The commit message does not mention the ticket number. Apart from that, the patch looks fine, and I am now running doctests.
