There are evidently many examples in which computing `P.height()`, for `P` a point on an elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(5)) yields a completely wrong answer.

I cannot remember who implemented this, but have looked at the code recently and it is using the standard Silverman algorithm.

I think it is likely that there is already a ticket for this.

A little `hg blame sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py` and `hg history sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py` shows that this code comes from #8496 , merged in sage-4.4.alpha1. The next change to this file happened with #8827 in a later release. I have verified that the example in the ticket gives the same result on sage-4.4, so the error has been there all along.
Note that:

```
sage: [P.height(precision=p) for p in [53..70]]
[1.35648516097058, 1.37988660372465, 1.392904136135677,
 1.388358180620918, 1.390651822960756, 1.3901262440498197,
 1.3886249896939375, 1.3887137996432686, 1.38889123047486600,
 1.38868605331097548, 1.38879145662338488, 1.38876788728230994,

```
so the computation is probably not really wrong. It's probably just a matter of precision estimates being off.

This is also pretty damning:

```
sage: (3*P).height()/P.height()
9.19316602595430
sage: (2*P).height()/P.height()
4.09522243754782
```

My guess is that the local contributions from the finite primes are fine (each is rational times log(p)), it's just the (two) real places.  One could compare with the real local heights as computed by Magma to verify this.

I was a little hasty.  There's no problem in the non-arch local height being an exact log:

```
sage: P.nonarchimedian_local_height()
1/2*log(25)
sage: P.nonarchimedian_local_height(prec=53)
1.60943791243410
sage: RR(P.nonarchimedian_local_height())   
1.60943791243410
```
is all correct.  The problem is with this:

```
sage: P.archimedian_local_height()          
-0.2206607955468278522013468194382
sage: P.archimedian_local_height(prec=53)
-0.252952751464
```
where the first is correct as this shows:

```
sage: P.archimedian_local_height()+ P.nonarchimedian_local_height(prec=53)
1.38877711688727
```
but the second is not.

It seems to be a numerical stability problem.  With the same example, and using the first embedding of K, we have, first to default 53-bit precision:

3.5527136788e-15
```
while at 100-bit precision:

```
sage: bb2,bb4,bb6,bb8                              
(1.5278640450004206071816526625, -128195.88857503147164756896321, -2.5017379541668653550777130780e7, -4.1181022505609323099570853156e9)

```
This means that whenever we evaluate one of the four polynomials (which coefficients are essentially the b-invariants) at some point we may lose precision badly.

One way out would be to use a "working precision" higher than the requested precision.  Another would be to use algebraic values instead of approximate ones for t,z,w in the algorithm, which is likely to be slow, but I will try it.

A better solution for the longer term would be to implement Mestre's AGM algorithm instead BUT this only exists at present  for real embeddings (I have worked on extending to the complex case, but that is still in progress).

The original precision problem seems to be solved by the patch, but there is a remaining problem if the given place `v` has lower precision than `prec` (the answer ends with a string of zeroes):

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-1)
sage: v = [0, a + 1, 1, 28665*a - 46382, 2797026*a - 4525688]
sage: E = EllipticCurve(v)
sage: P = E([72*a - 509/5, -682/25*a - 434/25])
sage: P.archimedian_local_height(v=K.places()[1],prec=1000)
2.81105581458853745263599796447519791747641640992814370122945754557165333149900887291328934930695388487942633879651281942220091469088330120430293759305481969374444866348067978423230783846520353108644485473632812500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
The precision of `v` shouldn't influence the result, of course.

Also, the default value of `prec` used when applying Silverman's Theorem 4.2 is currently the precision of the refined place `vv`, but it suffices to take the same default precision to which the result is returned, namely the precision of `v`.

I wrote a patch that fixes both issues; I am now going to test it.
