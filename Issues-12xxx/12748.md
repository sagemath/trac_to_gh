[Ben Hutz](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/1fe4a837a625754c) pointed out the following:

```
sage: R.<x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1,a0,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8>=PolynomialRing(QQ,order=TermOrder('degrevlex', 6) + TermOrder('degrevlex',10))sage: I = Ideal([a0])
sage: x1 in I
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Segmentation fault
```

So, two problems:

* I think a `ValueError` should be raised if one tries to define a polynomial ring in 15 variables, but provide a term order for 16 variables.
* One should try to have a less scary error message. Ben understood that he got a segmentation fault, but if I understand correctly one really gets not more than a harmless `RuntimeError`.

Towards a review:

* The patch does apply to sage-5.0.beta13.
* The fix looks fine to me.
* I am now running `make test`, and at least the first couple of tests pass.
* The patch removes an abundance of redundant whitespace. That's good, but let's hope that the patch goes in soon, since otherwise it may soon bit rot.

All tests pass. Some criticism:

* The error is raised during initalisation, but the error message claims that the error occurs in the copy constructor.
* In fact, I think the error *should* be raised in the copy constructor.
* One should use the :trac: directive.

So, I think I'm going to produce a reviewer patch. But I think, when moving the error from `__init__` to `__copy`, that my patch will require a (cross) review.

I experimented with moving the error to the `__copy` method. However, it turns out that

```
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py # 23 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.pyx # 9 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx # 2 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py # 2 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx # 5 doctests failed
```
because the copy method is called with (say) 6 variables on an input of (say) 5 variables.

Question: If T is a term order with a known number of variables, do we really want that `T.__copy(t)` works, where t is a term order with a different number of variables?

If the answer is "yes", then I give your patch a positive review and provide a small reviewer patch using the :trac: directive.

If the answer is "no", then what shall we do? Apparently the `__copy` method *is* called with different numbers of variables. Shall we deal with that on a different ticket or here?

The following use cases come to mind:
* homogenisation
* specialisation of a ring to those variables actually appearing in a set of polynomials
* `change_ring()` in general

So I vote "yes".

My emphasis was on copy **constructor**, i.e., not in `__copy` which is an internal function but when one calls `T = TermOrder(T)`

>  * One should use the :trac: directive.


Ah, thanks for the reminder. I can updated the patch or review your reviewers patch.
