[Ben Hutz](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/1fe4a837a625754c) pointed out the following:

```
sage: R.<x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1,a0,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8>=PolynomialRing(QQ,order=TermOrder('degrevlex', 6) + TermOrder('degrevlex',10))sage: I = Ideal([a0])
sage: x1 in I
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Segmentation fault
```

So, two problems:

* I think a `ValueError` should be raised if one tries to define a polynomial ring in 15 variables, but provide a term order for 16 variables.
* One should try to have a less scary error message. Ben understood that he got a segmentation fault, but if I understand correctly one really gets not more than a harmless `RuntimeError`.

All tests pass. Some criticism:

* In fact, I think the error *should* be raised in the copy constructor.
* One should use the :trac: directive.

So, I think I'm going to produce a reviewer patch. But I think, when moving the error from `__init__` to `__copy`, that my patch will require a (cross) review.

I experimented with moving the error to the `__copy` method. However, it turns out that

```
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py # 23 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.pyx # 9 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx # 2 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py # 2 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx # 5 doctests failed
```
because the copy method is called with (say) 6 variables on an input of (say) 5 variables.

Question: If T is a term order with a known number of variables, do we really want that `T.__copy(t)` works, where t is a term order with a different number of variables?

If the answer is "yes", then I give your patch a positive review and provide a small reviewer patch using the :trac: directive.

If the answer is "no", then what shall we do? Apparently the `__copy` method *is* called with different numbers of variables. Shall we deal with that on a different ticket or here?

The following use cases come to mind:
* homogenisation
* specialisation of a ring to those variables actually appearing in a set of polynomials
* `change_ring()` in general

So I vote "yes".

My emphasis was on copy **constructor**, i.e., not in `__copy` which is an internal function but when one calls `T = TermOrder(T)`

> * One should use the :trac: directive.

Ah, thanks for the reminder. I can updated the patch or review your reviewers patch.
