Hellooooooo Nicolas !!

Well, I think that if I read the docstring about "facade" in its current state I would not think that this may be the reason why the types of my elements are changed. I believe it would be better to let the explanation about what this parameter does (which you improved yourself) stay near the description of the "facade" parameter, otherwise the message by itself is not that clear....

What do you think ?

Oh, and I should be in Orsay around the end of next week. Will you be back in France by then ? `:-)`

I did not want to have examples or something too long in the INPUT
description, otherwise it's hard getting an overview. Now, feel free
to add a short link "See rubric ... below for details" though.

> Oh, and I should be in Orsay around the end of next week. Will you be back in France by then ? `:-)`

Back and away again! I am leaving Wednesday.

But if you come to Orsay in September, we will have plenty of time to
work together :-)
