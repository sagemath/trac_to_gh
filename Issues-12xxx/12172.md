John Palmeri reports that, with the R package from #12057, this doctest is problematic (line 352):

```
    sage: s = r.eval('capabilities("png")') # Should be on Linux and Solaris
```
On his Mac OS X 10.6.8 box, doctesting this starts up the X server but does not display any actual graphics. This is new: it didn't do this in Sage 4.8.alpha3.

This does not happen on all OSX machines. The intented R configuration on OSX is without X11 support, and only Aqua capabilities. 

It might be a bug or misconfiguration in the X installation that it opens up even though nobody is draw a window.

This can be avoided by unsetting `DISPLAY` in the R session, but then R does no longer report png output capabilities:

```
> Sys.unsetenv("DISPLAY") 
> capabilities("png")
  png 
FALSE 
> capabilities("aqua")
aqua 
TRUE 
```
Its unclear whether that would really be an issue in Sage.

Somebody with a Mac might want to trace where exactly R starts up the X server. The equivalent of strace on Linux seems to be http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/dtruss.1m.html

```
sage -sh
dtruss -f R
```

When I run "dtruss -f R", it exits immediately â€” it doesn't enter an interactive mode where I can give it commands. 

Meanwhile, we could unconditionally disable X11 on Darwin in spkg-install. I can produce a new spkg if people think this is a reasonable solution.

Yes, we should only need Aqua on Darwin for R graphics.  We'd need to test this on a few systems - in particular yours! - but I don't see why this should cause trouble.

The patch looks ok, modulo my usual having to look up shell syntax.  (Trifle annoying that someone forgot to update the version number in the GPL listing, but I'm not going to mess with that since it wasn't done on the upgrade.)

The problem is that I can't test whether it fixes the problem, really. With Sage 4.8:

```
$./sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py"                  
	 [9.7 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 9.7 seconds
```
Even though I have the offending file!
