```
sage: x, y = QQ['x','y'].gens()
sage: f = x*y
sage: f.is_squarefree()
False
sage: f = (x+y)*(x+3)
sage: f.is_squarefree()
False
```

This may be related to an inconsistency in the Singular sqrfree function, which sometimes includes a unit in the square free factorization, but other times does not.
