On OS X 10.6.8 I cannot install this spkg in sage-4.8.alpha3 (I build the alpha3 from source so the old spkg does install).

Doing

```
md:sage-4.8.alpha3 maarten$ ./sage -f ../sage-4.8.alpha4/spkg/standard/r-2.14.0.p0.spkg
```

Hangs as described on:  http://pastebin.com/7K7qLMJh

The guilty command is: /Users/maarten/Downloads//sage-4.8.alpha3/spkg/build/r-2.14.0.p0/src/bin/exec/R --no-restore --slave --args nextArg--pkglocknextArg--data-compress=xznextArg--byte-compilenextArg-lnextArg../../../librarynextArgMASS.tgz

This was introduced by #12057 since alpha3 builds ok on this setup.

For reference, on other OS X 10.6.8 systems thus far this has not happened.  If anyone hears of another, we'd definitely like to know.

So this ticket should be changed to "WorksForMe" or whatever?


FWIW, this R spkg keeps segfaulting for me (when byte-compiling the base package) with GCC 4.7.x (FSF 4.7.0 local install or the new optional GCC 4.7.1 spkg) on Ubuntu 10.04.4 x86_64.  I don't recall when or which R spkg did install, but presumably some previous definitely did a while ago.
