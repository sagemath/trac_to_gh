1. Added a test for a C99 compiler, since some packages require that.

2. Remove the useless checks for bison and flex (in the past, we did the checks but didn't fail if these programs weren't found).

3. We don't need to check gcc/g++/gfortran versions if we're building GCC.  Use the environment variable `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` (introduced in #12369) for this.

4. Make the script portable, so it doesn't require bash (instead of #12621, which proposed to force `bash`).

Sage may not need it, but the rest of the prereq build system does:

```
prereq-0.9 $ make
(CDPATH="${ZSH_VERSION+.}:" && cd . && /bin/sh /home/mjo/src/sage-4.8.alpha3/spkg/build/prereq-0.9/missing --run autoheader)
autom4te-2.68: need GNU m4 1.4 or later: /usr/bin/m4
autoheader-2.68: '/usr/bin/autom4te-2.68' failed with exit status: 1
make: *** [config.h.in] Error 1
```

We could probably ship a pre-built `configure` and `Makefile` rather than rely on autotools, but this is black magic to me and I don't understand the tradeoffs involved.

Not really, you just need to run it **once**, it is sufficient if the developer of the new `prereq` package runs it before shipping it into Sage.

<a id='comment:21'>Comment 21:</a>
A few comments: 

1) Testing with: 

```
if [ "$SAGE_BUILD_DIR" = "" ]; then 
```

is bad practice. Testing on "" can fail under some admittedly obscure circumstances. Better would be 

```
if [ "x$SAGE_BUILD_DIR" = x ]; then 
```

2) Are we 100% sure m4 is not needed? I have some recollection of it being needed somewhere. If not, this 
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/faq/faq-usage.html
needs modifying, as that specifically says to install m4. The configure script was clearly written with this in mind too. 

I can't judge all the implications of all the changes, but looking at the diffs only, I can't see anything that looks as though it will be a problem.  

A couple of minor points, one could address if one wanted to: 

a) The Solaris page should now really be to Oracle and not Sun, but it's no big deal. 

b) Although William was annoyed when Sage would not build with gcc 3.4 series due to "ratpoints", and was keen to get Sage working with gcc 3.4.x, I think the chances of that happening are very remote now. There is too much code that will not compile with such an old version of gcc. So one could consider removing all the checks associated with gcc 3.4.x, and simply accept that gcc 4.0.1 is the minimum version. That could take quite a bit of code out, and would mean that SAGE_USE_OLD_GCC could be removed from the list of environment variables. 

So I can't see anything wrong, with the exception of how SAGE_BUILD_DIR is tested. 

Assuming John and Jeroen are happy with each others changes, and the SAGE_BUILD_DIR issue is fixed, I think this should be set to positive review.
