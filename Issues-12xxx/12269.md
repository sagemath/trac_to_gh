```
sage: x = var('x')
sage: K1.<a1> = CyclotomicField(11)
sage: K2.<a2> = K1.extension(x^2 - 3)
sage: K3.<a3> = K2.extension(x^2 + 1) # Let's make a big relative number field
sage: t=a1+6*a2+a3*a1                 # with a complicated element.
sage: L = K3.absolute_field('b')
sage: L(t)
# The code at #11869 takes 12 seconds to compute roots of a
# polynomial, and then doesn't use them.
# TypeError: No compatible natural embeddings found for Number Field in b with .... and Complex Lazy Field
sage: L.structure()                   # However, the correct conversion map is available and works almost instantly
#(Isomorphism map:... , Isomorphism map: ...)
sage: L.structure()[1](t)
# big output
sage: L.gen() + t                     # It would be good if one of the structure maps is a coercion, but they aren't at the moment
# TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '+': ....
sage: K3(L.gen())                     # There are similar problems in the other direction
# TypeError: Cannot coerce element into this number field
sage: L.structure()[0](L.gen())       # for which the structure maps also work.
# a3 - a2 + a1
```

So this ticket is meant to:

* make both structure maps into conversions
* maybe make one or both of the structure maps into a coercion

Speeding up #11869 is not really related and is #12270.

That would fix it, but I don't think it would be very fast, as it would still use `.roots()` / #11869.

Wouldn't it be better to use the category/coercion framework here? I suppose all that is needed it to store the `.structure()` homomorphisms in the appropriate place (wherever that is, cc: Simon) as conversion maps. The structure homomorphisms are computed already, and using them is very fast.

Still, inheriting embeddings as in #11876 is certainly useful, so I think it is best to do both.

The map `absolute_field().structure()[1]` (from relative to absolute) cannot be a *coercion*, because it would lead to non-commuting diagrams of coercions. In sage-4.8.alpha4:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-2, embedding=-1)
sage: L.<b> = NumberField(x^2-2, embedding=1)
sage: xK = K['x'].gen()
sage: xL = L['x'].gen()
sage: M.<c> = NumberField(xK^2-3)
sage: N.<d> = NumberField(xL^2-3)
sage: O = M.absolute_field('e')
sage: P = N.absolute_field('e')
sage: b_in_a = K(0)+b
sage: map1 = O.structure()[1]
sage: map2 = P.structure()[1]
sage: b_in_a in map1.domain()
# True
sage: b in map2.domain()
# True
sage: map1(b_in_a) - map2(b)
# e^3 - 9*e, which is non-zero, so the diagrams don't commute!
```
Fast *conversions* in both directions would be very useful though. And maybe coercion from absolute to relative?

Sorry, I did not answer Marco's question yet.

Is it the case that the map is already known at initialisation time? Then, you could use (depending on whether you want a conversion or a coercion or an action) `sage.structure.parent.Parent.register_conversion(...)` or `...register_coercion(...)` or `...register_action(...)`. But note that it might be tricky to find the right moment for using these methods: They raise an error if the coercion framework was used before invoking the methods.

If the maps are not available at initialisation time (or if otherwise initialisation takes too much time), you could implement either `_convert_map_from_` or `_coerce_map_from_` -- see the documentation of both methods in `sage.structure.parent.Parent` for the expected return values. The advantage is that the map would only be constructed when needed.

Concerning "coercion or conversion between relative and absolute number fields", I think there has been at least one thread on sage-nt and also a trac ticket devoted to that subject.

Don't know, I'll have to dig through the code some more.

Thanks, I don't know that ticket/thread. I have found

The first two are about coercions between number fields, but don't say anything about relative versus absolute. The third is about conversions, again no relative versus absolute.

I also did another search on trac, and could only find the tickets I created last week: #12269 (this ticket) and #12271 (same, but for relativize).

> `structure()[1]` cannot be a coercion, because it would lead to non-commuting diagrams of coercions.

Actually, maybe it is the coercion between O to P that shouldn't be there! All of the following maps are natural
` O <--> M <-- K <--> L --> N <--> P `
and a map between O and P sending generator to generator does not commute with the abovementioned natural maps.

Some more about O and P:

```
sage: O
Number Field in e with defining polynomial x^4 - 10*x^2 + 1
sage: P
Number Field in e with defining polynomial x^4 - 10*x^2 + 1
sage: O is P
False
sage: O == P
True
sage: RR(O.structure()[1].domain().base_field().gen())
-1.41421356237309
sage: RR(P.structure()[1].domain().base_field().gen())
1.41421356237309
```
O and P are really different, I don't understand True for "==" here. Is that a bug?

```
sage: K is L
False
sage: K == L
False
```

Right. And here it is (in sage.structure.parent, lines 2300-2303):

```
                connection = None
                if EltPair(mor._domain, S, "coerce") not in _coerce_test_dict:

So, apparently someone intended to write "connecting = None", but wrote "connection = None". Can you try whether writing "connecting = None" fixes the problem?
