In this ticket:
- we make `expr.substitute(in_dict, **kwds)` as `expr.substitute(*args, **kwds)` and make it accepts any kind of arguments (symbolic equalities, dictionnaries or lists of them)
- we deprecate `subs_expr` as a duplicate of `subs`

This came up as a method of passing solutions from solve back into symbolic equations:

```
    f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100*(y - x^2)^2
    solution = solve([f.diff(ar) for ar in f.args()],f.args())[0]

Gives me a list of solutions as:

    [x=1;y=1]

Is there any way to programatically substitute this list of equalities back into f?
```

The solution provided by Michael Orlitzky was 

```
f(x,y).subs_expr(*solution)
```

Anycase, as noted by Michael, it would be nice if subs had the same behaviour:

```
Passing it one equation does work,

  sage: f.subs(x == 1)
  y + z + 1

But more than one doesn't,

  sage: f.subs(x == 1, y == 2)
  ...
  TypeError: substitute() takes at most 1 positional argument (2 given)

I guess all that's missing is the ability to pass it multiple equations,
like `subs_expr`. It would probably be easy to add that ability to
`subs` if you want to create a ticket for something.
```


With the branch applied we have:

```
sage: f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100*(y - x^2)^2
sage: solution = solve([f.diff(ar) for ar in f.args()],f.args())
sage: solution
[[x == 1, y == 1]]
sage: f.subs(solution[0])
(x, y) |--> 0
```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

`subs_expr` is already just doing a bit of preprocessing and then calling `subs`, so if the interface of `subs` is changed to accept a wider variety of input then subs_expr can simply be done away with. I'd say

```
subs(self,*args,**kwargs):
   for k in args:
       if is_symbolic_equation(k):
            kwargs[k.lhs()]=k.rhs() # but signal an error if key k is already present
       elif is_dict(k):
            add entries of k to kwargs # but signal error any key in k is already in kwargs.
       elif is_iterable(k):
            for e in k:
                if is_symbolic_equation(e):
                    same as before
                else:
                    error
       else:
            error
   ...
```
Note that behaviour at the moment is a bit random:

```
sage: x.subs({x:1})
1
sage: x.subs({x:1},x=2)
2
sage: x.subs(x==1,x=2)
1
sage: x.subs(x=1,x=2)
SyntaxError: keyword argument repeated
```

Some Cython limitations made this more of an event than it had to be, but the patch implements the requested feature and Nils' suggestions from comment 1.

When you pass `subs()` a list, it's processed recursively, which has the nice side effect of allowing you to call `solve()` and pass the result to `subs()` without caring about the form of the return value.

The new `subs()` throws an error on conflicting substitutions... nobody reads the documentation unless they have to so I think it's better to alert the user that he's likely making a mistake.

Hello,

I updated the patch as a git branch (trivial conflict) and I propose some cleanup in a second commit. Tell me what you think.

Hi Marc,

There is some difference of designs.

- in your version, the rightmost occurrence of a substitution takes precedence, while in Michael's one an error is raised
- you deprecate `subs_expr` and `substitute_expression` (I think this is good)
- is this a bug or a feature?

```
sage: var('x,y,t')
sage: A = cos(x) + sin(y) + x^2 + y^2 + t
sage: A.subs({x^2 + y^2: t})
x^2 + y^2 + t + cos(x) + sin(y)
sage: A.subs({cos(x) + x^2 + sin(y) + t + + y^2: 1})
1
```
- I like very much the presence of examples involving maple and mathematica

Vincent

`@`Vincent: Most of your changes look fine to me, thanks for picking this up again. I have a few comments:

1. When making multiple duplicate substitutions, all of the errors are no longer reported. This used to work like,

```
sage: d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
sage: d2 = {'b': 1, 'a': 2}
sage: _subs_safe_merge(d1, d2)
ValueError: Duplicate substitutions given: a, b
```

showing that both `a` and `b` had duplicate substitituons. Now it only shows the error for `a`:

```
ValueError: duplicate substitutions a->1 and a->2
```

The test "We should report all such conflicts..." was intended to show that =)

2. I like the fact that you show the whole substitution in the error, e.g. `ValueError: duplicate substitutions a->b and a->c`, but I think the arrow notation is confusing. I can't tell at a glance whether `a` or `b` is the variable. In some programming languages, the arrow is used to mean "take the value of `a` and put that into `b`." In other contexts, you could think of it as "take `a` and make it become `b`", which is actually the reverse substitution.

Above, you can deduce which is which (if you think for a minute), but you can also wind up with `ValueError: duplicate substitutions x->y and x->y` where it's totally ambiguous.

Is there some other notation that people generally agree on? Maybe the colon-equals, which defines the thing on the left to be equal to the thing on the right? For example, `x := 3` would mean that `x` is being defined to be `3`; i.e. `3` is substituted for `x`. It's a slight abuse of notation, but we can think of `:=` as "make the thing on the left equal the thing on the right from now on." That's basically what a substitution is.

3. My "And finally, a list containing one of everything" test was meant to show that we can handle all three types (symbolic equality, a dict, and another list) at the same time. You noticed that I forgot tuples (thanks!), but can we do them all at the same time? For example,

```
sage: w, x, y, z = SR.var('w, x, y, z')
sage: _subs_make_dict([w == 1, {x: 1}, [y == 1], (z == 1,)])
{w: 1, y: 1, x: 1, z: 1}
```
4. I agree that we can deprecate the other substitution methods `subs_expr` and `substitute_expression`.

That's it, thanks again for taking the time to work on this.

This is not really doable and makes no sense if there are a lot of arguments like

```
sage: expr.subs((a == b), [a == c, x == 3], {a: 4})
```
The dictionary of substitutions is constructed sequentially.

I just removed the problematic doctest. If you prefer to report all collisions, please tell me why...

You are perfectly right. This is now a whole sentence

```
duplicate substitution for a, got values 1 and 2
```

> 3. My "And finally, a list containing one of everything" test was meant to show that we can handle all three types (symbolic equality, a dict, and another list) at the same time. You noticed that I forgot tuples (thanks!), but can we do them all at the same time? For example,


There is a now a doctest for that.

> 4. I agree that we can deprecate the other substitution methods `subs_expr` and `substitute_expression`.

Done.

It can be annoying to have to retry the call to `subs()` over and over again getting a different error every time. But it's not a big deal to me.

I made a few more changes noted in the commit messages.. everything seems OK otherwise, pending a ptestlong. I also rebased on top of the develop branch to get a clean commit history.

Hello,

I do not agree with your `05492f4` and `0d34382`. First of all, if something is wrong, then it is not a big deal to go through the dictionaries again. Your version is way much too complicated. Please do something along

```
dup = [k for k in d2 if k in d1]
if dup:
    k = min(dup)   
    msg = "duplicate substitution for {}, got values {} and {}"
    raise ValueError(msg.format(k, d1[k], d2[k]))
```
And you can remark that I iterated over `d2` and this was intentional. The dictionary `d1` is intended to be large compared to `d2` (think about `expr.subs(u == 18, v == 15, w == 19, x == 1, y == 2, z == 3)`). In your commit you reversed that. And you should know that to get the minimum of a list you do not need to sort it ;-) Was the call to `sorted` intentional compared to `min`?

If you have access to `Maple/Mathematica` I would be curious to know what they do for

```
sage: (x + x^2 + x^4).subs(x + x^2 == 2)
```

The other changes are fine to me.

Vincent

The dictionary `d1` is intended to be large compared to `d2` (think about `expr.subs(u == 18, v == 15, w == 19, x == 1, y == 2, z == 3)`). In your commit you reversed that. And you should know that to get the minimum of a list you do not need to sort it ;-) Was the call to `sorted` intentional compared to `min`?

I guess I wasn't very clear in my commit message =)

The original code was,

```
if any(k in d1 for k in d2):
    k = (k for k in d1 if k in d2).next()
    raise ValueError...
```

The first `any(k in d1 for k in d2)` is probably O(m*n), since it (potentially) has to look through all of both dictionaries to see if there are any duplicates. Then,

```
    k = (k for k in d1 if k in d2).next()
```

**also** looks through both dictionaries, essentially to do the same thing: to see if there are any duplicates, but this time we write down the first duplicate key.

Since we're going to find the first duplicate key *anyway*, we don't need to do the first `any` check. If the dupe is toward the end of the list, the `any`less version could be a lot faster. Once the `any` check is gone, my version isn't much different than yours. But since I've removed the `any` check, I no longer know that `next()` is safe in

```
k = (k for k in d1 if k in d2).next()
```

because it could throw a `StopIteration` exception. Instead of catching the exception, I chose to use a "for ... in" loop iteration:

```
for k in (k for k in d1 if k in d2)
``` 

That achieves the same thing without having to check whether or not there were any dupes. I tested it with some big dictionaries and it is a little faster. But since I can't force a dupe to be "at the end" of a dictionary, I can't check the worst-case.

In any case, I'm going to push another version that should be faster and simpler than both =)

You are wrong. A dictionary is a hash table not a list. Assuming that there is no collision this is a O(m) where m=size(d2).

Right, but doesn't this

```
k in d1 for k in d2
```

do the `d1[k]` lookup (which is O(n)) m times, once for each key in `d2`?

The lookup is O(1). And once for each key in d2 gives O(m). There is no for loop on d1, isn't it?

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A35):

> The lookup is O(1). And once for each key in d2 gives O(m). There is no for loop on d1, isn't it?

Ah, I was using the worst-case O(n) instead of the average O(1).



> Looks good to me. Can I add a commit to show a more relevant example about comparisons of maple/mathematica with respect to substitution?

Sure.

Sorry for the delay!

I added a more complete example comparing maxima/maple/mathematica. Tested with the last version of maple but I do not have access to Mathematica. So it lacks some test.

I think I am done. So I let you review my last commit.

note: it is based on 6.7.rc0
