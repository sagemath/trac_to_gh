```
In this ticket:
- we make `expr.substitute(in_dict, **kwds)` as `expr.substitute(*args, **kwds)` and make it accepts any kind of arguments (symbolic equalities, dictionnaries or lists of them)
- we deprecate `subs_expr` as a duplicate of `subs`

This came up as a method of passing solutions from solve back into symbolic equations:

```
    f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100*(y - x^2)^2
    solution = solve([f.diff(ar) for ar in f.args()],f.args())[0]

Gives me a list of solutions as:

    [x=1;y=1]

Is there any way to programatically substitute this list of equalities back into f?
```

The solution provided by Michael Orlitzky was 

```
f(x,y).subs_expr(*solution)
```

Anycase, as noted by Michael, it would be nice if subs had the same behaviour:

```
Passing it one equation does work,

  sage: f.subs(x == 1)
  y + z + 1

But more than one doesn't,

  sage: f.subs(x == 1, y == 2)
  ...
  TypeError: substitute() takes at most 1 positional argument (2 given)

I guess all that's missing is the ability to pass it multiple equations,
like `subs_expr`. It would probably be easy to add that ability to
`subs` if you want to create a ticket for something.
```


With the branch applied we have:

```
sage: f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100*(y - x^2)^2
sage: solution = solve([f.diff(ar) for ar in f.args()],f.args())
sage: solution
[[x == 1, y == 1]]
sage: f.subs(solution[0])
(x, y) |--> 0
```

`subs_expr` is already just doing a bit of preprocessing and then calling `subs`, so if the interface of `subs` is changed to accept a wider variety of input then subs_expr can simply be done away with. I'd say

```
subs(self,*args,**kwargs):
   for k in args:
       if is_symbolic_equation(k):
            kwargs[k.lhs()]=k.rhs() # but signal an error if key k is already present
       elif is_dict(k):
            add entries of k to kwargs # but signal error any key in k is already in kwargs.
       elif is_iterable(k):
            for e in k:
                if is_symbolic_equation(e):
                    same as before
                else:
                    error
       else:
            error
   ...
```
Note that behaviour at the moment is a bit random:

```
sage: x.subs({x:1})
1
sage: x.subs({x:1},x=2)
2
sage: x.subs(x==1,x=2)
1
sage: x.subs(x=1,x=2)
SyntaxError: keyword argument repeated
```

I would argue that we accept the weird behaviour in the cases above, but document it.

Most users are *(hopefully)* unlikely to use such mixed arguments, and trying to predict the desired behaviour of those that do will probably result in the wrong answer.

Some Cython limitations made this more of an event than it had to be, but the patch implements the requested feature and Nils' suggestions from comment 1.

When you pass `subs()` a list, it's processed recursively, which has the nice side effect of allowing you to call `solve()` and pass the result to `subs()` without caring about the form of the return value.

The new `subs()` throws an error on conflicting substitutions... nobody reads the documentation unless they have to so I think it's better to alert the user that he's likely making a mistake.

Hello,

I updated the patch as a git branch (trivial conflict) and I propose some cleanup in a second commit. Tell me what you think.

Hi Marc,

There is some difference of designs.

- in your version, the rightmost occurrence of a substitution takes precedence, while in Michael's one an error is raised
- you deprecate `subs_expr` and `substitute_expression` (I think this is good)
- is this a bug or a feature?

```
sage: var('x,y,t')
sage: A = cos(x) + sin(y) + x^2 + y^2 + t
sage: A.subs({x^2 + y^2: t})
x^2 + y^2 + t + cos(x) + sin(y)
sage: A.subs({cos(x) + x^2 + sin(y) + t + + y^2: 1})
1
```
- I like very much the presence of examples involving maple and mathematica

Vincent

`@`Vincent: Most of your changes look fine to me, thanks for picking this up again. I have a few comments:

1. When making multiple duplicate substitutions, all of the errors are no longer reported. This used to work like,

```
sage: d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
sage: d2 = {'b': 1, 'a': 2}
sage: _subs_safe_merge(d1, d2)
ValueError: Duplicate substitutions given: a, b
```

showing that both `a` and `b` had duplicate substitituons. Now it only shows the error for `a`:

```
ValueError: duplicate substitutions a->1 and a->2
```

The test "We should report all such conflicts..." was intended to show that =)

2. I like the fact that you show the whole substitution in the error, e.g. `ValueError: duplicate substitutions a->b and a->c`, but I think the arrow notation is confusing. I can't tell at a glance whether `a` or `b` is the variable. In some programming languages, the arrow is used to mean "take the value of `a` and put that into `b`." In other contexts, you could think of it as "take `a` and make it become `b`", which is actually the reverse substitution.

Above, you can deduce which is which (if you think for a minute), but you can also wind up with `ValueError: duplicate substitutions x->y and x->y` where it's totally ambiguous.

Is there some other notation that people generally agree on? Maybe the colon-equals, which defines the thing on the left to be equal to the thing on the right? For example, `x := 3` would mean that `x` is being defined to be `3`; i.e. `3` is substituted for `x`. It's a slight abuse of notation, but we can think of `:=` as "make the thing on the left equal the thing on the right from now on." That's basically what a substitution is.

3. My "And finally, a list containing one of everything" test was meant to show that we can handle all three types (symbolic equality, a dict, and another list) at the same time. You noticed that I forgot tuples (thanks!), but can we do them all at the same time? For example,

```
sage: w, x, y, z = SR.var('w, x, y, z')
sage: _subs_make_dict([w == 1, {x: 1}, [y == 1], (z == 1,)])
{w: 1, y: 1, x: 1, z: 1}
```
4. I agree that we can deprecate the other substitution methods `subs_expr` and `substitute_expression`.

That's it, thanks again for taking the time to work on this.

This is not really doable and makes no sense if there are a lot of arguments like

```
sage: expr.subs((a == b), [a == c, x == 3], {a: 4})
```
The dictionary of substitutions is constructed sequentially.

I just removed the problematic doctest. If you prefer to report all collisions, please tell me why...
 
> 2. I like the fact that you show the whole substitution in the error, e.g. `ValueError: duplicate substitutions a->b and a->c`, but I think the arrow notation is confusing. 


You are perfectly right. This is now a whole sentence

```
duplicate substitution for a, got values 1 and 2
```

> 3. My "And finally, a list containing one of everything" test was meant to show that we can handle all three types (symbolic equality, a dict, and another list) at the same time. You noticed that I forgot tuples (thanks!), but can we do them all at the same time? For example,



There is a now a doctest for that.

It can be annoying to have to retry the call to `subs()` over and over again getting a different error every time. But it's not a big deal to me.

I made a few more changes noted in the commit messages.. everything seems OK otherwise, pending a ptestlong. I also rebased on top of the develop branch to get a clean commit history.

Hello,

I do not agree with your `05492f4` and `0d34382`. First of all, if something is wrong, then it is not a big deal to go through the dictionaries again. Your version is way much too complicated. Please do something along

```
dup = [k for k in d2 if k in d1]
if dup:
    k = min(dup)   
    msg = "duplicate substitution for {}, got values {} and {}"
    raise ValueError(msg.format(k, d1[k], d2[k]))
```
And you can remark that I iterated over `d2` and this was intentional. The dictionary `d1` is intended to be large compared to `d2` (think about `expr.subs(u == 18, v == 15, w == 19, x == 1, y == 2, z == 3)`). In your commit you reversed that. And you should know that to get the minimum of a list you do not need to sort it ;-) Was the call to `sorted` intentional compared to `min`?

If you have access to `Maple/Mathematica` I would be curious to know what they do for

```
sage: (x + x^2 + x^4).subs(x + x^2 == 2)
```

The other changes are fine to me.

Vincent

I guess I wasn't very clear in my commit message =)

The original code was,

```
if any(k in d1 for k in d2):
    k = (k for k in d1 if k in d2).next()
    raise ValueError...
```

The first `any(k in d1 for k in d2)` is probably O(m*n), since it (potentially) has to look through all of both dictionaries to see if there are any duplicates. Then,

```
    k = (k for k in d1 if k in d2).next()
```

**also** looks through both dictionaries, essentially to do the same thing: to see if there are any duplicates, but this time we write down the first duplicate key.

Since we're going to find the first duplicate key *anyway*, we don't need to do the first `any` check. If the dupe is toward the end of the list, the `any`less version could be a lot faster. Once the `any` check is gone, my version isn't much different than yours. But since I've removed the `any` check, I no longer know that `next()` is safe in

```
k = (k for k in d1 if k in d2).next()
```

because it could throw a `StopIteration` exception. Instead of catching the exception, I chose to use a "for ... in" loop iteration:

```
for k in (k for k in d1 if k in d2)
``` 

That achieves the same thing without having to check whether or not there were any dupes. I tested it with some big dictionaries and it is a little faster. But since I can't force a dupe to be "at the end" of a dictionary, I can't check the worst-case.

In any case, I'm going to push another version that should be faster and simpler than both =)

You are wrong. A dictionary is a hash table not a list. Assuming that there is no collision this is a O(m) where m=size(d2).

Right, but doesn't this

```
k in d1 for k in d2
```

do the `d1[k]` lookup (which is O(n)) m times, once for each key in `d2`?

The lookup is O(1). And once for each key in d2 gives O(m). There is no for loop on d1, isn't it?

Sorry for the delay!

I added a more complete example comparing maxima/maple/mathematica. Tested with the last version of maple but I do not have access to Mathematica. So it lacks some test.

I think I am done. So I let you review my last commit.

note: it is based on 6.7.rc0
