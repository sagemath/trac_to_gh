```
sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py"
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
         [360.2 s] 
```

This doctest runs out of time on my PC. looking inside and doing doctests manually I found that there are 2 function calls which use the bunch of the time

```
S.resolution()
```
and

```
S.betti()
```

those functions are called in several docstrings with similar parameters.

propsed fix is to write a TEST section which test those functions once and flag the other Examples as no test

I wrote a patch where I have flagged the worst offenders in sandpile.py as # test long.
So they will get tested when doing -ptestlong

time for all tests of the module dropped from >360 sec to 55 sec on my machine
cheers

I used `sage -t -timeit` and found some other places that are to blame for most of the runtime. In general the runtime wasn't as bad with the latest (unpatched) alpha anymore for me.
Anyway, if you're ok with these additions, feel free to set it to positive review.
