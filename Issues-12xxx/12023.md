sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py"
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
         [360.2 s] 
```

This doctest runs out of time on my PC. looking inside and doing doctests manually I found that there are 2 function calls which use the bunch of the time

```
S.resolution()
```
and

```
S.betti()
```

those functions are called in several docstrings with similar parameters.

propsed fix is to write a TEST section which test those functions once and flag the other Examples as no test

I wrote a patch where I have flagged the worst offenders in sandpile.py as # test long.
So they will get tested when doing -ptestlong

time for all tests of the module dropped from >360 sec to 55 sec on my machine
cheers
