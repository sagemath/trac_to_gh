```
sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py"
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
         [360.2 s] 
```

This doctest runs out of time on my PC. looking inside and doing doctests manually I found that there are 2 function calls which use the bunch of the time

```
S.resolution()
```
and

```
S.betti()
```

those functions are called in several docstrings with similar parameters.

propsed fix is to write a TEST section which test those functions once and flag the other Examples as no test

    "body": "<a id='comment:14'></a>\nI agree with the `*firing_graph` doctests as those take over 1.25s on my laptop, and the `show`'s I'm okay with (although those really should be a call to `plot`). The `resolution` takes ~0.7s, which is borderline for me because it is testing functionality.
