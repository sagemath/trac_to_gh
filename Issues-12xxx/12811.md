1.) The norm of an ideal in quaternion algebra is off by a factor of 2

```
sage: A.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(-1,-1)
sage: I = A.ideal([i,j,k,1/2 + 1/2*i + 1/2*j + 1/2*k])      # this is actually an order, so has reduced norm 1
sage: I.left_order()
sage: I.norm()
2
```

The reason is that the norm is computed from d(I)=n(I)<sup>2</sup>  d(R) where R is the left- or right-order of I and d(I) = \sqrt{ abs{det(tr(x_i \conj{x_j}))} } for a ZZ-basis (x_i) of I. But the matrix returned by gram_matrix() that is actually used in the computation has as entries 2*tr(x_i \conj{x_j}), thus the determinant is off by a factor of 16 and the resulting reduced norm off by a factor of 2

2.) Omitting the line 'I.left_order()' in the previous example gives a RuntimeError:

```
sage: A.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(-1,-1)
sage: I = A.ideal([i,j,k,1/2 + 1/2*i + 1/2*j + 1/2*k]) 
sage: I.norm()

   1695         self.__quaternion_order = A
   1696         return A

RuntimeError: unable to determine quaternion order of ideal without known order
```

This is because neither the left- nor the right-order of I have been computed at this point. There is however no mathematical reason why this should fail.

The patch corrects both mentioned problems, and adds a doctest to test for this.

Some of the old doctests seem to have wrong values for the norm (which is why they passed). I changed them and cross-checked with Magma that the ideals appearing in the doctests indeed have the new values as reduced norms.

You could add an additonal doc-test with " # optional - magma" as comment, so that the mentioned cross-check is also included.

I updated the patch to do this for the first doctest.

I also noticed that the other 'optional - magma' doctests fail on my Version of Magma (V2.18-4) because the output format has slightly changed from what Sage expects, but I suppose the fix for that should not be mixed with this ticket.
