In `/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py` (as per #11869), when converting number field elements, the parts
 
* List of candidates for K(x)
* Find a common field F into which KF and LF both embed
 
are independent. The first can be very slow, while the second is likely to fail. So I propose to swap these two parts.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A1):
> I'm a but confused.  Exactly where and when are roots unneccessarily computed?

In `/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py` (as per #11869) the parts

* "# List of candidates for K(x)" and
* "# Find a common field F into which KF and LF both embed."

are independent. The first can be very slow, while the second is likely to fail. So I propose to swap these two parts.
