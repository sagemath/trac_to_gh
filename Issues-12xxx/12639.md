I was hacking happily in python in a directory. Then I decided I wanted to use that code with sage, and set PYTHONPATH to point to it. And sage still didn't find it...

The reason is that sage-env overwrites PYTHONPATH instead of prepending to it.

In more detail: first, use `SAGE_PATH` for this rather than `PYTHONPATH`. Second, this ticket should probably be closed as invalid or as a duplicate of #3784.
