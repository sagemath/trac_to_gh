Ticket #11601 made some changes to congruence subgroups and broke some stuff that dims.py depends on, which resulted in breaking dimension_new_cusp_forms when the character is trivial and the level is 1 or 2.

It seems like bigger levels work fine...

```
sage: dimension_new_cusp_forms(DirichletGroup(3)(1), 12)

sage: dimension_new_cusp_forms(DirichletGroup(4)(1), 12)
