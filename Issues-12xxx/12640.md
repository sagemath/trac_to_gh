Ticket #11601 made some changes to congruence subgroups and broke some stuff that dims.py depends on, which resulted in breaking dimension_new_cusp_forms when the character is trivial and the level is 1 or 2.

It seems like bigger levels work fine...

```

Just for the record: that "somebody" was me, at ticket #11601. From that ticket description:

"Some "rationalisation" is also included: e.g. one can no longer create Gamma1(1) or GammaH(11, [2]), which previously existed as less-functional duplicates of SL2Z and Gamma0(11)."
