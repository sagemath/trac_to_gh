Hello,

I think I found a bug in Sage 4.8, more specifically in polybori. Polybori terminates with a "segmentation fault". I have attached the input (sparse polynomials) and the output. I can reproduce the error with this specific input.

For smaller instances (i.e. less variables, less equations), the programme runs fine and the output is correct.

The machine has about 256 GB RAM, uses an AMD Opteron(TM) Processor 6276 @ 2.3 GHz and runs under Linux 2.6.32-220.2.1.el6.x86_64. 

If you need any more info: Please drop me a line!

Best,
Christopher

Maybe #11575 already fixed that (still it works only for sage-5.0).
