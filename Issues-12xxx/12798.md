1. `list_plot3d` plots extra points at the horizontal x-y plane. This seems to stem from the default value of 0.0 that is assigned in the code. See [this post](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/RAdolRdjSTk/discussion).

2. This function also does not take in `color` or `rgbcolor` as keywords. Rest of the plot commands including `plot`, `list_plot`, `plot3d` do take in these keywords.

First attached patch fixes both these problems, second one fixes more doc and clarifies output.

Actually, `color` and the other keywords will never override `texture`. `color` will be used only when `texture` is not present, and `color` is present. As it is setup, if `texture` is provided, then the others should be ignored. Actually, maybe we should do this explicitly and remove the other keywords if they are present. Something like

```
if texture == 'automatic':
    if 'color' in kwds:
        texture = kwds.pop('color')
        if 'rgbcolor' in kwds:
            del kwds['rgbcolor']
     ...
texture = rgbcolor(texture)
if 'color' in kwds:
    del kwds['color']
...
```
Does that sound reasonable?

I have no idea why this was done. Was it some bug in matplotlib earlier? Was it just an oversight? For an empty plot, I suppose you would not want there to be plot points at 0.0!

Sorry for the inaccuracy, of course that is what I meant.

Yes, as long as we document it.  We do similar things lots of other places.

Hmm, looking at your plots from the post, I think I know.  The idea was probably to have the `list_plot` cause a list to be plotted and then have the plot be zero elsewhere.  Then there is the weird interpolation thing going on.  Anyway, this makes things interpretable, though I'm not sure the original was really that useful, due to the output.  I wonder who has used this in the past...

Okay, I think this idea is okay.  William says to defer to what Mathematica appears to do, since this is where the function was inspired, many years ago.

```
There will be holes in the surface corresponding to array elements that do not represent explicit height values.
```
And see [here](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/ListPlot3D.html), the second example - clearly not continued beyond the three points given.

Ok. I updated the patch to fix the color in 3D lines.

The other problem with interpolation and `num_points` is something that I don't know how to fix. Giving a high value of `num_points` gives a very good and accurate plot, but is also very slow. I have added some notes regarding this in the documentation of `list_plot3d`.

Great, color works now - nice catch.

It turns out that the documentation for what this function actually does is *insanely* bad.  I'm going to upload a patch clarifying what it actually does, which is not intuitive at all.

As for the issue you are seeing, I think it's very interesting.  Notice that the box that comes up *does* have the right dimensions to incorporate all three points, even when you don't specify `num_points`!

Here is what is going on - I've printed out the `vals`.  All those `nan` guys will lead to not much of a plot.

```
sage: sage: list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],interpolation_type='linear')
[[ -1.00000000e+00              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]
 [             nan   6.66133815e-16              nan              nan               nan              nan]
 [             nan              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]
 [             nan              nan              nan   2.00000000e+00               nan              nan]
 [             nan              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]
 [             nan              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]]
```
So you pick your poison here.  Either you get something that does have the right points, but then also has everything else be extended by zero, or you don't do that, but the algorithm fails in certain cases.  This will happen whenever the "box" in question is a lot bigger than the projection of the actual points to the xy-plane.

```
sage: sage: list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)]) # bad
sage: sage: list_plot3d([(0,5,1), (5,5,4), (-1,-5,-1)]) # good
```

I'm good with your work.  If you like my changes, sign off as a reviewer and we'll get this in.

So you think that the massive slowdown is caused by the few added doctests here, not by the changes in code in this ticket?  That could be tested.

I can't test it since it is apparently only visible on the solaris arch.

Yes. It will be good to test if `num_points=400` in the same doctest command without this patch still leads to the massive slowdown. I can't test it since it is apparently only visible on the solaris arch. The command that is desired to be doctested is

```
sage: list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],num_points=400) # long time
```

There is one workaround (even with the resource leak) and that is to decrease the value of `num_points` in the current patch.

On Solaris SPARC, sage-5.1.beta0:

```
sage: time list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],num_points=400)

Time: CPU 23.91 s, Wall: 34.13 s
```
same machine, sage-5.1.beta3 + this patch:

```
sage: time list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],num_points=400)

Time: CPU 39.62 s, Wall: 50.75 s
```

So, there is a slowdown. But perhaps more importantly, the time to doctest the file `list_plot3d.py` increased by much more than this.  So I'm guessing with this patch, the time to doctest is much more than the sum of the times of the individual commands.

This is befuddling. The main time consuming doctest that is added is the `num_points=400` one. And here are the doctest times. The starting point is sage-5.2.alpha0 with these patches added, on an `Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU          6400  `@` 2.13GHz` ubuntu 12.04.
1. First, with `f.default_value = 0.0` missing from the file (this is the change introduced by the patches in this ticket).

```
...age-5.2.alpha0/devel/sage» ../../sage -b >& /dev/null 
...age-5.2.alpha0/devel/sage» ../../sage -t -long sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py 
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py"
	 [13.5 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 13.5 seconds
```
2. Second test with `f.default_value = 0.0`. Note that at this point, the extra examples introduced by the patches in this ticket are still there in the file.

```
...age-5.2.alpha0/devel/sage» ../../sage -b >& /dev/null 
...age-5.2.alpha0/devel/sage» ../../sage -t -long sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py

	 [16.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 16.3 seconds
```
3. Third, with `f.default_value = float('inf')`, and otherwise the patches in this ticket are still applied, i.e., the extra examples are still present.

```
...age-5.2.alpha0/devel/sage» ../../sage -b >& /dev/null 
...age-5.2.alpha0/devel/sage» ../../sage -t -long sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py 
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py"
	 [12.8 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 12.8 seconds
```
4. Finally, with all the patches unapplied. This is vanilla sage-5.2.alpha0 and hence the examples introduced by the patches in this ticket are not present.

```
...age-5.2.alpha0/devel/sage» hg qpop -a
popping trac_12798-more-doc.2.patch
popping trac_12798-fix_extraneous_points_and_kwds_in_list_plot3d.patch

...age-5.2.alpha0/devel/sage» ../../sage -b >& /dev/null 
...age-5.2.alpha0/devel/sage» ../../sage -t -long sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py 
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py"
	 [6.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 6.3 seconds
```
Note that correct plots are generated only by 1. and 3. At least on this machine, both 1. and 3. are faster than the code already present in vanilla sage-5.2.alpha0. It is only the example with `num_points=400` that introduces the slowdown.

So, I am attaching an updated patch which reduces the `num_points`. Here is the time taken for this new one. Notice that the time taken is *lower* than the vanilla sage-5.2.alpha0, even though the number of examples doctested has increased.

Attachment [12798_doc.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket12798/12798_doc.patch) by @jdemeyer created at 2012-06-26 13:02:26

I can absolutely confirm that the slowdown on Solaris SPARC is caused by [attachment:12798_change.patch], not by the added doctests.

It is confusing alright. I am getting speedups on intel but you are getting slowdowns on sparc. Sorry for bothering you so much. Can you do the following test since you have access to the sparc:
1. Change line 467 and 488 of [attachment:12798_change.patch] with the following version and check if it is still slow.

```
f.default_value = float('inf')
```
This is the only alternative solution I have for the incorrect plots otherwise generated.

I guess the method `sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface.ParametricSurface.triangulate()` should be fixed not to add any faces of which the coordinates are not all finite numbers.  However, I'm having a hard time understanding that method.

Because now we are sending a list of faces to be plotted full of `NaN`s:

```
sage: G = list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],num_points=100)
sage: G.triangulate()
sage: G.face_list()

```

I think this is a true bug (and this might even have been the reason for the old `default_value`).

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A40):
> That is a good question.  You can check it out in the code, there is some stuff in graphics.py or plot.py with `DOCTEST_MODE`.  Computing the plot objects is very fast, you are right.  And plot3d of course is even different from that.


I had a look at the files. For 3D plot, the `DOCTEST_MODE` saves the output in every possible file format - tachyon, java3d and jmol. This is evident from the code in `sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx`.

Attachment [trac_12798-dont_pass_nan_to_ParametricSurface.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket12798/trac_12798-dont_pass_nan_to_ParametricSurface.patch) by @ppurka created at 2012-06-26 17:39:33

`@`jdemeyer: can you test the [attachment:trac_12798-dont_pass_nan_to_ParametricSurface.patch new patch] I have put up. I prevent `nan`s from being passed on to the `ParametricSurface` class. Since I based it on 5.1beta5 (don't have 5.2alpha0 at home right now), you may apply the previous two patches (either ours, or yours) and then apply this new patch.

Why I opted for this - modifying `ParametricSurface` has a high probability of introducing more bugs than fixing the one already present. If we modify it, then one option is to put checks for nan or inf in line 588 (as of the 5.1beta5) of `parametric_surface.pyx`

```
                    res.x, res.y, res.z = self.f(uu, vv)
```
But doing so implies that we also need to modify `urange, vrange, n` and `m` in that file, and I believe that this requires a major editing of the code.

It seemed better/safer to actually modify `list_plot3d` instead of `ParametricSurface`.

That extra patch doesn't seem to have changed anything.  You can check for yourself with:

```
sage: G = list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],num_points=100)

There should be no `nan`s in that list.

I had a fresh look at this ticket. The last patch that I posted which trims the `xvals` and `yvals` on the basis of whether there are `nan`s or not, is actually incorrect. This can be tested on a simple 3D plot:

```
list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (1,0,0), (0,1,0)], num_points=5)
```
The output is a square instead of a triangle and the square persists even for `num_points=100`. This is because we trim the x and y values. Without the third patch, the earlier patches in this ticket actually gives a correct plot (even for such a low value of `num_points=5`).

As for the presence of `nan`s. This is all correct and there is no contradiction or error here. If you look at what is going on, there is a matrix being created called `vals` which contains all possible z values corresponding to `x in xvals` and `y in yvals` which should appear in our 3D plot. In the simple example above, `xvals = [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]` and `yvals` is the same. So **all** possible points `(x,y)` with `x` and `y` taking values from `xvals` and `yvals`, respectively, is the cartesian product `xvals x yvals` and it will will include points like `(0.75, 0.75)` or `(0.75, 1)`, etc, which should have no corresponding finite value in `vals`.

So, every time the ranges of `x` and `y` do not form a square, there will be `nan`s in the matrix `vals`, and this can not be avoided if you want an accurate plot. So, it is pointless to try and remove `nan`s.

If most of the points are invalid then you should of course use a different base grid, but I think thats not the scope of this ticket. The way I understand it, this ticket is about a fast rectangular base grid that doesn't fall flat on its face if there is a pole somewhere.
