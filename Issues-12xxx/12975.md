```
sage: cython?
...
       For example:
    
          #clang C++
          #clib givaro
          #cinclude /usr/local/include/
          #cargs -ggdb
          #cfile foo.c
...
```

That's misleading, as Cython does only accept `#clang c++` but not `#clang C++`. Thank you, Burcin, for pointing that out!

I attached a new patch which should allow `cython()` to accept `#clang C++` as well as `#clang c++`. I have no clue how to doctest this.

My reviewer patch will contain a test such as this:

```
    TESTS:

    Before :trac:`12975`, it would have beeen needed to write ``#clang c++``,
    but upper case ``C++`` has resulted in an error::

        sage: from sage.all import SAGE_ROOT
        sage: code = [                     
        ... "#clang C++",
        ... "#cinclude %s/local/include/singular %s/local/include/factory"%(SAGE_ROOT,SAGE_ROOT),
        ... "#clib m readline singular givaro ntl gmpxx gmp",
        ... "from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular cimport MPolynomial_libsingular",
        ... "from sage.libs.singular.polynomial cimport singular_polynomial_pow",
        ... "def test(MPolynomial_libsingular p):",
        ... "    singular_polynomial_pow(&p._poly, p._poly, 2, p._parent_ring)"]
        sage: cython(os.linesep.join(code))

    The function ``test`` now manipulates internal C data of polynomials,
    squaring them::

        sage: P.<x,y>=QQ[]
        sage: test(x)
        sage: x
        x^2
```
But with your current patch, one would still need c++, not C++.
