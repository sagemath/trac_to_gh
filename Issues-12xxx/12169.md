Hello,

this patch was not set as `needs review` but was apparently waiting for it.

I wrote a small review patch mainly adding missing tests.

We now need someone to finalize the review.

Hellooooooooo !!!

Could you add the HararyGraph to the list of graph constructors at the beginning of the file ? As it is it does not appear in the index `:-)`

Once this is done, this patch can go !
