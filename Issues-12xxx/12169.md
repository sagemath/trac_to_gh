this patch was not set as `needs review` but was apparently waiting for it.

I wrote a small review patch mainly adding missing tests.

We now need someone to finalize the review.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hellooooooooo !!!

Could you add the HararyGraph to the list of graph constructors at the beginning of the file ? As it is it does not appear in the index `:-)`

Once this is done, this patch can go !
