note that this doesn't apply to 5.0.beta3, since the `sage-sage` script has been deprecated. It looks like the relevant bit needs to be applied to `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage` for 5.0.

Sorry, the issue I reported the last time is a non-issue (you just have to wait a bit longer for the Tee background process to notice that it's finished). 

But there is an amusing bug which I spotted when running a patchbot under 5.0.beta10. The function that compares version numbers just splits on "." and sorts alphabetically, and hence it thinks beta1 < beta10 < beta2! This caused a bunch of spurious "Apply Failed" warnings when it tried to apply patches from tickets that had already been merged (listed as dependencies of open tickets). See for example the first of the two runs for ticket #10527.

The fix is to add the lines

```python
a = a.replace("beta", "beta.")
b = b.replace("beta", "beta.")
```

to util.compare_versions.

The updated patch does that. (It also is a bit more strict about catching a `ValueError` when doing `int(s)`, which probably isn't a big deal, but it seems like a good idea.)

Is there a way how "state" could be preserved across patchbot runs?  Could it happen that the patchbot tests ticket X and somehow ticket X has a bug causing failures in *following* tickets the patchbot tests?  Because it looks like this is happening here.

I did 600 test runs of `maxima_abstract.py` on vanilla sage-5.1.beta2 and found no error.  Nobody has reported this bug on the mailing list and I haven't seen it on the buildbot with sage-5.1.beta2 or earlier.  So I conclude that the bug is introduced by a not-yet-merged ticket.

Since it is extremely unlikely that all the tickets in kini's list above cause the same bug, the most logical explanation is that somehow one ticket corrupted further patchbot runs.

My desktop does about 10 tickets/hour, each of which adds a `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-<ticket>` directory of about 330MB. Is there a reason why the patchbot does not delete these? It kind of adds up, we are talking about >50 GB per day. Or should I get another harddisk to run the patchbot on?

About the `maxima_abstract.py` error, I never observed it here. It might be a 32-bit issue (I'm running Fedora 17 x86_64). Although perhaps far-fetched, there is another bug where the sage-maxima interface goes into an infinite recursion (#13097).

Even with these issues I'd be in favor of merging this ticket. Its useful functionality and it works for most. We can polish it in a follow-up ticket.

My patchbot processed 236 tickets so far and I'm at 80 gigabytes:

```
[patchbot@volker-desktop sage-5.1.beta3]$ du -sh .
79G	.
[patchbot@volker-desktop sage-5.1.beta3]$ mount | grep /home
/dev/sdc1 on /home type ext4 (rw,relatime,seclabel,data=ordered)
```
Thats already accounting for hardlinks, `du` is smart enough to only count the linked file once. Turning this off (and overcounting) yields

```
[patchbot@volker-desktop sage-5.1.beta3]$ du -shl .
336G	.
```
So it should probably stop just below 100G, still acceptable I think.

Well, this is a defect in sage -clone (which should hopefully go away with git). I'm not quite sure how 

```
sage -clone ticket
[test ticket]
sage -b main
sage -clone newticket
```

would have different behavior from 

```
sage -clone ticket
[test ticket]
sage -b main
rm -rf /path/to/deve/sage-ticket
sage -clone newticket
```

though I have seen issues with the build directory getting messed up when files are added and then removed.

I'm not sure I see what the problem is; is the issue that the files aren't extracted in the spkg itself? That shouldn't matter at all, as they're in the history which is what's used to install the spkg.

Because we have always done things that way, and I don't see any reason why we should make an exception for the patchbot files.

Surely our installation/packaging procedure can be improved, but that's the topic of #13015, not of this ticket.

Adding a spkg requires changes to `spkg/standard/deps` and `spkg/install`.

Leaving `$SAGE_LOCAL` unquoted is not so good:

```
$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/patchbot/patchbot.py
```

Better is

```
"$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/patchbot/patchbot.py"
```
