```
The various parallel aspects of Sage should be controlled by setting the `-j` (possible also `-l`) flags in `MAKE` or `MAKEFLAGS`.  That is, if `MAKE='make -j16'`, then

- running `make` will build spkg's in parallel, using 16 processes (this was done in #11959).  This is standard `make` behaviour, but we need to patch `spkg/standard/deps` to ensure that `make` recognizes that we are doing a recursive make.

- running `make ptestlong` or `sage -tp 0 <files>` will doctest in parallel using 16 threads.  If the `-j` flag in `MAKE` is not set, then determine the number of threads as before: `min(8, cpu_count())`.

- running `./sage -b` will build the Sage library using 16 threads. If the `-j` flag in `MAKE` is not set, then use only 1 thread.

**Testing this ticket**: you can set the environment variable `SAGE_NUM_CORES` to the number of cores you want to pretend to have.  For example, running

```
SAGE_NUM_CORES=24 make ptestlong
```
should run 8 threads (see `sage-num-threads.py`; this is undocumented because the only purpose I see is for testing this ticket).

**Notes**:
With the patches applied, building spkgs in parallel works well, except for race conditions in:
* python (#12096)
* singular (#12137)
* zlib (#12138)
* mpir (#12139)
* atlas on Solaris (#12312)
and a "jobserver unavailable" warning in:
* ntl
* singular (#12137)
* rubiks

If you run "sage -tp <files>", should you use 1 process or more than 1?  The "-tp" option means "parallel", so perhaps the default should be more than 1 in this case.  In other cases (like docbuilding, for example), the default should be 1.

Here are new patches.  These use `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` if it is set, and otherwise try to extract a number from `MAKE`.  (My method for doing this is probably not ideal, but the options  This is done in sage-env.  Running `sage -b` should use this setting now, also.

I don't know how to get the number of threads from

```
make -j16 ptestlong
```
so I removed that from the "to do" list in the ticket description.

In the file sage-ptest, I removed the "FIXME" comment in

```python
    try:
        # FIXME: Nice, but <NUMTHREADS> should immediately follow '-tp' etc.,
        #        i.e., be the next argument. We might have file or directory
        #        names that properly convert to an int...
        numthreads = int(argv[1])
        infiles = argv[2:]
    except ValueError: # can't convert first arg to an integer: arg was probably omitted
        numthreads = 1
```
The script sage-ptest doesn't get a "tp" argument; it is instead called by sage-sage, and the way it is called, the first argument to sage-ptest is precisely what ever came after "-tp".  So I don't think anything needs fixing.  If we ever rewrite sage-sage (#21) to properly parse arguments, we can make sure that "-tp" has a default numerical argument of zero.

1) If you are going to use the string "auto" for automatic, you might as well use "infinite" for infinite, instead of zero.

1b) Alternatively: use 0 for automatic (as is sage -tp 0) and 999999 for unlimited.  This would mean less special-case code, since a value like 999999 is more than what a user would normally specify (for the forseeable future).

4) Why did you change

```

to

```
sage-build "$@"

in the `sage_build()` function in `sage-sage`?

5) You reverted a lot of changes that I made to `doc/en/developer/doctesting.rst`. Why?  I actually **tried** all the examples in the documentation and pasted the exact output I got (on `sage.math.washington.edu`).

I am planning to work further on this, so don't change any code yet.  But please give your opinion.

Sounds good to me.

Okay.

That was a mistake.

> 5) You reverted a lot of changes that I made to `doc/en/developer/doctesting.rst`. Why?  I actually **tried** all the examples in the documentation and pasted the exact output I got (on `sage.math.washington.edu`).

Some of them I disagreed with, like the complete removal of the section "Beyond the Sage library".  So I started from scratch, at which point I just put in the changes that I felt were relevant to the ticket or easy for me to change.  Probably I should have started with your patch and added the section (with modifications) back in.

It looks like #9739 broke doctesting of .sage files.  We should fix that (not on this ticket).

I installed these patches on sage.math and set `MAKE='make -j12'`.  Then I ran `make ptestlong`, and the log file for the testing says "Doctesting 2857 files doing 2 jobs in parallel".  Running `./sage -tp --long ...` uses 12 threads, as it should.

If I remove the redirection of stderr to null in sage-env, when calling sage-num-threads, I see this:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/usb1/scratch/palmieri/12016/test1/sage-4.8.X/local/bin/sage-num-threads.py", line 144, in <module>

    if MAKEFLAGS[0] != '-':
IndexError: string index out of range
```
This seems to fix the problem for me:

Without this one, if you do `export MAKE='make -j'` and then `make ptestlong`, although it says it's using 0 threads, it actually starts up 999999 threads (to do nothing, as far as I can tell).

This looks good to me.  Is it ready for review?  Am I allowed to review it since I wrote early drafts of some of the patches?

For a future ticket, it would be nice if you could set `MAKE='make -j -lN'`, for some reasonable choice of `N`, and have it work.  When I try this, I have problems with the following spkgs, and I'm not sure why:

- zlib on OS X (2 cores) fails most of the time with `MAKE='make -j -l3'`. [Here's a log.](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/zlib-1.2.5.log)
- singular on sage.math fails all of the time, I think, with `MAKE='make -j -l30'`. [Here's a log.](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/singular-3-1-3-3.p1.log)

(The Sage spkg used to fail before the latest round of patches using the `-l` setting for a cap on the number of threads, and the same goes for parallel doctesting.  Setting `MAKE='make -j'` still causes these failures.  Should we just regard this setting as too dangerous, or try to stop the failures by putting a cap on the number of processes if `-j` is present but set to "unlimited" and `-l` is missing?)

These failures are not related to this ticket; they fail with or without the patches.  But the ticket makes it more appealing to just set `MAKE` as above.

Question for both cases: does MAKE="make -jN" work for various values of N?  Because I don't see a fundamental difference between "make -jN" and "make -j -lN".

> (The Sage spkg used to fail before the latest round of patches using the `-l` setting for a cap on the number of threads, and the same goes for parallel doctesting.  Setting `MAKE='make -j'` still causes these failures.  Should we just regard this setting as too dangerous?

Yes.  Since "make" will simply run as many threads as it can, I think Sage should do the same, no matter how stupid that is.

One reason is that `make -j -lN` puts a limit on starting new processes, and that might be what's causing the problems.  I could force the old zlib spkg to fail on sage.math by running `MAKEFLAGS='j -l2' ./sage -f ...` but not with `MAKEFLAGS='j -l30' ...`.  I don't know if setting `MAKE="$MAKE -j1 -l` in spkg-install is the right way to fix this for problematic spkgs (like singular?), but it might be worth trying.

Well, this would only be needed if the user does something very silly like

```
MAKE="make --dry-run" ./sage -f ...
```

> More importantly, on OpenSolaris, or at least on David Kirkby's machine hawk, the default 'grep' command doesn't take a `-e` option.  Can we just omit it?

Probably yes, but it might be safer to replace the leading space by a `[ ]`.
