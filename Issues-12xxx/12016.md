The various parallel aspects of Sage should be controlled by setting the `-j` (possible also `-l`) flags in `MAKE` or `MAKEFLAGS`.  That is, if `MAKE='make -j16'`, then

- running `make` will build spkg's in parallel, using 16 processes (this was done in #11959).  This is standard `make` behaviour, but we need to patch `spkg/standard/deps` to ensure that `make` recognizes that we are doing a recursive make.

- running `make ptestlong` or `sage -tp 0 <files>` will doctest in parallel using 16 threads.  If the `-j` flag in `MAKE` is not set, then determine the number of threads as before: `min(8, cpu_count())`.

- running `./sage -b` will build the Sage library using 16 threads. If the `-j` flag in `MAKE` is not set, then use only 1 thread.

**Testing this ticket**: you can set the environment variable `SAGE_NUM_CORES` to the number of cores you want to pretend to have.  For example, running

```
SAGE_NUM_CORES=24 make ptestlong
```
should run 8 threads (see `sage-num-threads.py`; this is undocumented because the only purpose I see is for testing this ticket).

**Notes**:
With the patches applied, building spkgs in parallel works well, except for race conditions in:
* python (#12096)
* singular (#12137)
* zlib (#12138)
* mpir (#12139)
* atlas on Solaris (#12312)
and a "jobserver unavailable" warning in:
* ntl
* singular (#12137)
* rubiks

**Apply**:
1. [attachment:12016-root.patch] to the `SAGE_ROOT` repository.
2. [attachment:12016-base.patch] to `spkg/base`.
3. [attachment:12016-scripts.patch] and [attachment:trac_12016-scripts-ref.patch] to the `SCRIPTS` repository.
4. [attachment:12016-sage.patch] to the Sage library.

Sounds okay.

If you run "sage -tp <files>", should you use 1 process or more than 1?  The "-tp" option means "parallel", so perhaps the default should be more than 1 in this case.  In other cases (like docbuilding, for example), the default should be 1.

Here are new patches.  These use `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` if it is set, and otherwise try to extract a number from `MAKE`.  (My method for doing this is probably not ideal, but the options  This is done in sage-env.  Running `sage -b` should use this setting now, also.

I don't know how to get the number of threads from

```
make -j16 ptestlong
```
so I removed that from the "to do" list in the ticket description.

In the file sage-ptest, I removed the "FIXME" comment in

```python
    try:
        # FIXME: Nice, but <NUMTHREADS> should immediately follow '-tp' etc.,
        #        i.e., be the next argument. We might have file or directory

    except ValueError: # can't convert first arg to an integer: arg was probably omitted
        numthreads = 1
```
The script sage-ptest doesn't get a "tp" argument; it is instead called by sage-sage, and the way it is called, the first argument to sage-ptest is precisely what ever came after "-tp".  So I don't think anything needs fixing.  If we ever rewrite sage-sage (#21) to properly parse arguments, we can make sure that "-tp" has a default numerical argument of zero.

I am planning to work further on this, so don't change any code yet.  But please give your opinion.

Sounds good to me.

> 2) In `sage-ptest`, unlimited really should be unlimited.  Not max(8, # of cpus).


Okay.

> 3) We should also do the following long-needed fix here: setting `MAKE` to `make -j16` is very standard in Sage circles, but not actually the prefered way according to the GNU make folks.  One really should use `MAKEFLAGS` instead (similar to the distinction between `CC` and `CFLAGS`).  This is why you often see an error like "make -jN forced in sub-make.  Disabling job server mode" (freely quoted from my mind).  So, when `MAKEFLAGS` exists, assume that make understands the flags and **do not pass flags** in `MAKE`.


I'm willing to try that, especially if you write the patch instead of me :)

That was a mistake.

> 5) You reverted a lot of changes that I made to `doc/en/developer/doctesting.rst`. Why?  I actually **tried** all the examples in the documentation and pasted the exact output I got (on `sage.math.washington.edu`).  Surely, this is better than keeping the outdated (and in many cases totally wrong) output.


Some of them I disagreed with, like the complete removal of the section "Beyond the Sage library".  So I started from scratch, at which point I just put in the changes that I felt were relevant to the ticket or easy for me to change.  Probably I should have started with your patch and added the section (with modifications) back in.

It looks like #9739 broke doctesting of .sage files.  We should fix that (not on this ticket).

Without this one, if you do `export MAKE='make -j'` and then `make ptestlong`, although it says it's using 0 threads, it actually starts up 999999 threads (to do nothing, as far as I can tell).

I get lots of doctest failures and warnings using `make -j`, along the lines of `OSError: [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable` and `/bin/sh: Cannot fork`, but I guess this is to be expected?  Maybe we should put some sort of cap on the number of threads to use for doctesting?

Question for both cases: does MAKE="make -jN" work for various values of N?  Because I don't see a fundamental difference between "make -jN" and "make -j -lN".

Well, this would only be needed if the user does something very silly like

```
MAKE="make --dry-run" ./sage -f ...
```

> More importantly, on OpenSolaris, or at least on David Kirkby's machine hawk, the default 'grep' command doesn't take a `-e` option.  Can we just omit it?

Probably yes, but it might be safer to replace the leading space by a `[ ]`.
