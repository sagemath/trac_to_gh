This arose from some of the discussion at #12421. In summary: we don't need to mention `license()` in the Sage banner.  Instead, we should mention the `help()` command.  I also added basic information about using `less` with introspection to the help message.

Apply [[attachment:12445_doublequote.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12445/12445_doublequote.patch), and [attachment:trac_12445-ref2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12445/ac5bec42215443699975eea8f516645d.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12445/ca981ea1f7042452dc6705ee727a68f3.patch),) to the main Sage library.

Note that the new browser won't appear when you start Sage unless you produce a Sage distribution with `sage --sdist ...` or `sage --bdist ...`. To look at the new banner, type `banner()` while running Sage. The old banner:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 5.0.beta2, Release Date: 2012-02-03                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
After the patch:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------

| Type 'notebook()' for the browser-based notebook interface.        |

I'm wondering whether the following looks better:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 5.0.beta14, Release Date: 2012-04-27                  |

| Type help() for help.                                              |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
as opposed to

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 5.0.beta14, Release Date: 2012-04-27                  |
| Type 'notebook()' for the browser-based notebook interface.        |

I like this.  jhpalmieri *always* knows how to add actual helpful documentation that is not too verbose.

This changes the help message after `sage -br` ~~but for some reason it doesn't actually change the banner~~ and now I read [comment:2](#comment%3A2).  

As for the quotes, I don't have a strong opinion either and this seems reasonable.  I guess if we get emails asking for how to use help we'll need to change it!

All the sage/misc/ tests pass, and so although I'm going to run all of them now I'll put this as positive review.  I don't think it's a problem we don't test these, because in theory Sage should work fine without the very very long process of building documentation (why oh why is that not parallelized yet?).
