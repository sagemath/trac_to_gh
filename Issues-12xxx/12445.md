This arose from some of the discussion at #12421. In summary: we don't need to mention `license()` in the Sage banner.  Instead, we should mention the `help()` command.  I also added basic information about using `less` with introspection to the help message.

Apply [attachment:trac_12445-banner.patch], [attachment:12445_doublequote.patch], and [attachment:trac_12445-ref2.patch] to the main Sage library.
