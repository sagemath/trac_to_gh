This arose from some of the discussion at #12421. In summary: we don't need to mention `license()` in the Sage banner.  Instead, we should mention the `help()` command.  I also added basic information about using `less` with introspection to the help message.

Apply [attachment: trac_12445-banner.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12445/trac_12445-banner.patch.gz), [attachment: 12445_doublequote.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12445/12445_doublequote.patch.gz), and [attachment: trac_12445-ref2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12445/trac_12445-ref2.patch.gz) to the main Sage library.

Component: **misc**

Keywords: **banner help**

Author: **John Palmieri, Jeroen Demeyer**

I like this.  jhpalmieri *always* knows how to add actual helpful documentation that is not too verbose.

This changes the help message after `sage -br` ~~but for some reason it doesn't actually change the banner~~ and now I read [comment:2](#comment%3A2).  

As for the quotes, I don't have a strong opinion either and this seems reasonable.  I guess if we get emails asking for how to use help we'll need to change it!

All the sage/misc/ tests pass, and so although I'm going to run all of them now I'll put this as positive review.  I don't think it's a problem we don't test these, because in theory Sage should work fine without the very very long process of building documentation (why oh why is that not parallelized yet?).

- A doctest fails because of the changes to lines 93-94 of banner.py: the old doctest ended in "...", while the new one doesn't, so it doesn't handle banners for beta versions (which include "Warning: this is a prerelease version...").
- Also, you were a little over-enthusiastic with search-and-replace: `function"s`, line 1413, and `Python"s`, line 1425, of sagedoc.py.
