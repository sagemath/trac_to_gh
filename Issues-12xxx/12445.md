This arose from some of the discussion at #12421. In summary: we don't need to mention `license()` in the Sage banner.  Instead, we should mention the `help()` command.  I also added basic information about using `less` with introspection to the help message.

Apply [attachment:trac_12445-banner.patch], [attachment:12445_doublequote.patch], and [attachment:trac_12445-ref2.patch] to the main Sage library.

**Assignee:** @jasongrout

**Keywords:** banner help

Note that the new browser won't appear when you start Sage unless you produce a Sage distribution with `sage --sdist ...` or `sage --bdist ...`. To look at the new banner, type `banner()` while running Sage. The old banner:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 5.0.beta2, Release Date: 2012-02-03                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
After the patch:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 5.0.beta2, Release Date: 2012-02-03                   |
| Type 'notebook()' for the browser-based notebook interface.        |
| Type 'help()' for help.                                            |

```
as opposed to

Sorry, John.\n\nThese changes seem fine as long as they apply.  I assume that the banner change in the most recent patch is only needed for betas, but will it cause a non-beta doctest to fail, since there won't be any dot-dot-dot to dot-dot-dot?",

Hmm, maybe that whole "couldn't take your changes because someone else changed it in the meantime" was useful after all, huh?  Sorry, John.

These changes seem fine as long as they apply.  I assume that the banner change in the most recent patch is only needed for betas, but will it cause a non-beta doctest to fail, since there won't be any dot-dot-dot to dot-dot-dot?

I think this should be okay.  I don't have any "beta" versions on hand right now but this seems like the right fix.

I added Jeroen to the author for his contribution.

Aack!
