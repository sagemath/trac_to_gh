I already have an spkg working around this, as well as using `ecl -norc ...` as recommended by an ECL developer.

To reproduce the problem, just try something like

```sh
$ env LDFLAGS="-DFOO -DBAR" ./sage -f spkg/standard/maxima-5.26.0.p0.spkg
```

**New spkg:** [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/maxima-5.26.0.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/maxima-5.26.0.p1.spkg)

**md5sum:** `e0dd8b63928fbef1ffa52420f1313c48  maxima-5.26.0.p1.spkg`

### maxima-5.26.0.p1 (Leif Leonhardy, March 25th 2012)
* #12759: Unset `LDFLAGS` if it contains multiple words.
  (ECL's still get used in that case, but don't break the build.)
* Use `ecl -norc ...` throughout `spkg-install`, as recommended by Juanjo.
  We set the environment variable `ECL` to this, which *might* get used by
  Makefiles as well -- to be checked.
  (I.e., we might have to pass e.g. `ECL="$ECL"` when invoking
  `make` to override Makefile settings, in case that's desired.)
* Use `cp -pf ...` to preserve permissions and to avoid errors if files
  already exist (read-only).
* Add some error checks, messages and comments; quote more variables.

Looks like the main issue (i.e., multiple words in `LDFLAGS`) meanwhile got fixed upstream (as of Maxima 5.29.1, see #13364);  I'll probably try to incorporate the other fixes into the Maxima spkg there.
