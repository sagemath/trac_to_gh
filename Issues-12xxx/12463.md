First of all, polyhedron `__eq__` documentation is wrong. It states

```
    def __eq__(self, other):
        """
        Test whether ``self`` is a strict sub-polyhedron of ``other``.
```

This does not correspond with the actual code nor the test.

Morevover, intersection of polyhedra produces output with wrong internal representation.

```
sage: P=Polyhedron([[0,0]], rays=[[1,1]])
sage: Q1=Polyhedron([[0,0],[1,1]])
sage: Q2=Polyhedron([[1,0],[0,1]])
sage: Q=Q1.intersection(Q2)
sage: Q==P
True
sage: Q < P
False
```

It seems that now inequality/containment are checked correctly, but the documentation of `__eq__` still has a typo.
