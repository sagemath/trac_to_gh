This patch fixes an obvious typo in discover_action. Alas, it's in a seldom used branch, and I could not extract a suitable regression test (I stumbled on the issue with a large coercion graph using quite some experimental code). And even then, the regression would not necessarily robustly catch the broken branch.

If someone wants to play further, here is the kind of thing I (unsuccessfully) tried:

```
class P(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        Parent.__init__(self, category=Sets())
    Element=ElementWrapper
A = P(); a = A("a")
B = P(); b = A("b")
C = P(); c = A("c")
D = P(); d = A("d")
Hom(A,B)(lambda x: b).register_as_coercion()
Hom(B,C)(lambda x: c).register_as_coercion()
Hom(C,D)(lambda x: d).register_as_coercion()
Hom(D,A)(lambda x: a).register_as_coercion()
```

But I guess this patch is obvious enough to could go as is
