This patch fixes an obvious typo in discover_action. Alas, it's in a seldom used branch, and I could not extract a suitable regression test (I stumbled on the issue with a large coercion graph using quite some experimental code). And even then, the regression would not necessarily robustly catch the broken branch.

If someone wants to play further, here is the kind of thing I (unsuccessfully) tried:

```
class P(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        Parent.__init__(self, category=Sets())
    Element=ElementWrapper
A = P(); a = A("a")
B = P(); b = A("b")
C = P(); c = A("c")
D = P(); d = A("d")
Hom(A,B)(lambda x: b).register_as_coercion()
Hom(B,C)(lambda x: c).register_as_coercion()
Hom(C,D)(lambda x: d).register_as_coercion()
Hom(D,A)(lambda x: a).register_as_coercion()
```

But I guess this patch is obvious enough to could go as is

Here is a minimal example which illustrates the problem:

```

....:     Element=ElementWrapper
....:

With the patch, the output is now (as it should be):

sage: Hom(B, A)(lambda x: a).register_as_coercion()
sage: Hom(C, B)(lambda x: b).register_as_coercion()
sage: Hom(D, C)(lambda x: c).register_as_coercion()
sage: A(d)
'a'
```
This could be added as a doctest to detect the problem, but maybe it's not necessary for such a clear typo. I would also note that [this comment](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7420#comment:3) from #7420 points out a cleaner way to fix the problem, but this patch is fine too.
