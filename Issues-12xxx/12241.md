This ticket implements exp, log, and derivative of multivariate power series:

```
sage: T.<a,b> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ,2)
sage: f = a + b + a^2*b
sage: f = a + b + a^2*b + T.O(4)
sage: f.derivative(a)
1 + 2*a*b + O(a, b)^3
sage: exp(f)
1 + a + b + 1/2*a^2 + a*b + 1/2*b^2 + 1/6*a^3 + 3/2*a^2*b + 1/2*a*b^2 + 1/6*b^3 + O(a, b)^4
sage: log(1+f)
a + b - 1/2*a^2 - a*b - 1/2*b^2 + 1/3*a^3 + 2*a^2*b + a*b^2 + 1/3*b^3 + O(a, b)^4

This is good -- thanks for working on it!  Here are some comments:


## derivative

Looks great!


## pow
* I think the default behavior should be same as repeated multiplication by self -- is there a good reason not to do this?

* Also, when precision is much larger than valuation, `pow` is slower than repeated multiplication anyway:

```
sage: R.<a,b,c> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: f = a+R.random_element(100)
sage: f
a - a^23*c^11 + a^29*b^8*c^55 + 2*a^36*b^54*c^6 + O(a, b, c)^100
sage: %timeit f^10
5 loops, best of 3: 95.8 ms per loop
sage: %timeit f.pow(10)
5 loops, best of 3: 215 ms per loop
```
I think this should be addressed by rewriting `pow` to use `_bg_value`, as has been done with `_mul_`.


* Unexpected behavior when requesting larger precision from `pow`:

```
sage: f = a*R.random_element(); f
2*a^3*b - 7*a^3*b^4*c^3 - 3*a^6*b^6 - 109*a^3*b^3*c^6 - 2*a*b^9*c^2 + O(a, b, c)^13
sage: f^2
4*a^6*b^2 - 28*a^6*b^5*c^3 - 12*a^9*b^7 - 436*a^6*b^4*c^6 - 8*a^4*b^10*c^2 + O(a, b, c)^17
sage: f.pow(2,prec=17)
4*a^6*b^2 + O(a, b, c)^13
```

## exp / log

* The warning about constant coefficients is confusing and vague.  I would prefer something more straightforward like:  "If `f` has constant coefficient `c`, and `exp(c)` is transcendental, then `exp(f)` would have to be a power series over the Symbolic Ring.  These are not yet implemented and therefore such cases raise an error:"

* Another workaround for this limitation is to change base ring to one which is closed under exponentiation, such as RR or CC:

```
sage: R.<a,b,c> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: f = 2+R.random_element()
sage: exp(f)
 . . .
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Symbolic Ring' and 'Multivariate Power Series Ring in a, b, c over Rational Field'
sage: S = R.change_ring(CC)
sage: f = S(f)
sage: exp(f)
7.38905609893065 + (-7.38905609893065)*a*b^3*c + (-22.1671682967919)*a^6*b^2*c + (-7.38905609893065)*a^5*b^2*c^2 + (-7.38905609893065)*b^2*c^7 + 3.69452804946533*a^2*b^6*c^2 + (-7.38905609893065)*a*b^10 + O(a, b, c)^12
```


* For elements with infinite precision, consider using `default_prec` if no precision is specified:

```
sage: R.<a,b,c> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: R.default_prec()
12
```


* The implementation seems unnecessarily slow, because of repeated calls to `pow`:  For precision `n`, calling `pow` for each term will require a total of something like `n^2` multiplications of the input with itself.  But these functions should require only `n`.  Here is a suggested alternate implementation for `log`:

```
def fast_log(f):
    prec = f.prec()
    x = 1-f
    r = 1
    logx = 0
    for i in range(1,prec):
        r = r*x + R.O(prec)
        log += r/i
    return -logx
```

```
sage: f = 1+R.random_element(30); f
1 - 6*a^5*b^2*c^7 + a^14*b^13 + O(a, b, c)^30
sage: %timeit log(f)
5 loops, best of 3: 224 ms per loop
sage: %timeit fast_log(f)
25 loops, best of 3: 26.4 ms per loop
sage: fast_log(f) == log(f)
True
```

And this might be faster if you use `_bg_value` to do the multiplication here too.
