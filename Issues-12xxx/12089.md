Singular does not build on Cygwin because libkernel and libhtmlhelp are not found.
Indeed an include path which is set to ../kernel on generic systems is set to /bin on Cygwin.

Use the spkg at
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/singular-3-1-5.p1.spkg
which fixes this.

sage: After decompressing the directory singular-3-1-3-3.p1-cygwindraft does not exist
This means that the corresponding .spkg needs to be downloaded
again.

I think you have to name the spkg the same as the folder which is compressed.  I'll try renaming the folder and trying it again.

Dima, I'll test this just now, but if it builds, then I think it would just require you to sign off on it.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I don't really agree with the solution developed here.

My guess is that the Makefile.in is just broken because a -L../kernel on generic system got transformed into -L/bin.

I'll post an updated spkg based on the updated Singular spkg by Jeroen at #13237 with that approach when my new build on Cygwin fails at Singular.
I'll report upstream as well.

We could also close this ticket and directly integrate your patch into Jeroen spkg from #13237 (which already includes other patches from singular trac/your github(? don't know the relation between them)).
Anyway, even if we don't, we'll have for Jeroen skpg to get positive review.
