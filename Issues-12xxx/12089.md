Singular does not build on Cygwin because libkernel and libhtmlhelp are not found.
Indeed an include path which is set to ../kernel on generic systems is set to /bin on Cygwin.

Use the spkg at
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/singular-3-1-5.p1.spkg
which fixes this.

Depends on #13237

The draft package is malformed somehow.

```
sage: After decompressing the directory singular-3-1-3-3.p1-cygwindraft does not exist
This means that the corresponding .spkg needs to be downloaded
again.
```
I think you have to name the spkg the same as the folder which is compressed.  I'll try renaming the folder and trying it again.

I've done exactly that same thing in making spkgs before!  Spkg is updated at [singular-3-1-3-3.p2.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/singular-3-1-3-3.p2.spkg).  The new patch only is applied on Cygwin.  Diff attached for reference in review.

Dima, I'll test this just now, but if it builds, then I think it would just require you to sign off on it.

Dima or Volker or someone, can you report this upstream?

I don't really agree with the solution developed here.

My guess is that the Makefile.in is just broken because a -L../kernel on generic system got transformed into -L/bin.

I'll post an updated spkg based on the updated Singular spkg by Jeroen at #13237 with that approach when my new build on Cygwin fails at Singular.
I'll report upstream as well.

You can try the spkg available at:
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/singular-3-1-5.p1.spkg

As it is based on the spkg from #13237 which has uncommitted changes, I've not committed anything yet either.
However I'll attached the diffs here.
