Singular does not build on Cygwin because libkernel and libhtmlhelp are not found.
Indeed an include path which is set to ../kernel on generic systems is set to /bin on Cygwin.

Use the spkg at
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/singular-3-1-5.p1.spkg
which fixes this.

**CC:**  @vbraun @kcrisman alexanderdreyer @jdemeyer

**Keywords:** singular, cygwin, spkg

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

**Reviewer:** Karl-Dieter Crisman, Dmitrii Pasechnik, Jean-Pierre Flori

**Author:** Dmitrii Pasechnik, Karl-Dieter Crisman, Jean-Pierre Flori

**Merged:** sage-5.4.beta0

**Dependencies:** #13237

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12089

The draft package is malformed somehow.

This means that the corresponding .spkg needs to be downloaded

I think you have to name the spkg the same as the folder which is compressed.  I'll try renaming the folder and trying it again.

Dima, I'll test this just now, but if it builds, then I think it would just require you to sign off on it.

Dima or Volker or someone, can you report this upstream?

I don't really agree with the solution developed here.

My guess is that the Makefile.in is just broken because a -L../kernel on generic system got transformed into -L/bin.

I'll post an updated spkg based on the updated Singular spkg by Jeroen at #13237 with that approach when my new build on Cygwin fails at Singular.
I'll report upstream as well.

You can try the spkg available at:

As it is based on the spkg from #13237 which has uncommitted changes, I've not committed anything yet either.
However I'll attached the diffs here.

-singular-3-1-3-3.p1 does not build on Cygwin, as Singular's internal libraries libkernel and libhtmlhelp are now built as static, and they cannot be linked using the usual -l syntax. Rather, one needs to list them much like .o files.
+Singular does not build on Cygwin because libkernel and libhtmlhelp are not found.
+Indeed an include path which is set to ../kernel on generic systems is set to /bin on Cygwin.
 
-Spkg is available at [singular-3-1-3-3.p2.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/singular-3-1-3-3.p2.spkg).
