Here is the problem:

```
sage: P1 = toric_varieties.P1()
sage: print sum([P1.divisor(1)])
V(s) + V(t)
```
Which I think comes from

```
sage: print P1.divisor(1).parent()(0)
V(s)
```
Perhaps, we can allow creation of divisors by indices of rays/variables, but only in the form `P1.divisor(0)`? Since zero in the group of divisors should be just zero and other integers don't really make sense.

Hi Volker,

I looked through the code and a possible solution is to catch integers in `_element_constructor_` of `ToricDivisorGroup` instead of passing them down to `ToricDivisor`. "Catch" means replace 0 with `None` to construct the trivial divisor and raise an exception for anything else.

It is not very elegant, but keeps current functionality and `X.divisor(i)` returning the divisor of the i-th ray still seems quite reasonable to me, while `X.divisor_group()(i)` is questionable.

If you agree, I'll make the change and try to make it clear in the documentation of all the methods involved.

I'd prefer to get rid of integer arguments in it altogether, there are already enough ways to construct a toric divisor.
