<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
Just wondering why you omitted the message given by `spkg-install` from the description; this is a long-known minor bug and already fixed upstream, "just for us" btw., in a (this-)bug-fix-only release.

It would have been hardly more work to just upgrade to 2.1.4 (or later), thereby finally fixing the bug instead of working around it.
