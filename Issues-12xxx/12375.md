The build of the GUI (`xcas`) has been disabled in the `spkg-install` to minimize the dependencies.

**Sage packages**:
* [http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/sage/giac-1.2.0.13.tar.gz](http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/sage/giac-1.2.0.13.tar.gz)

The Sage `giac` package was built with `spkg-src` from the original giac 1.2.0-13 source:

I believe that these examples are using the pexpect (communications through string) giac interface that is already in sage. So you just need an external giac program in your path. It could be installed from this spkg but by other ways also.

But you  also need to create the following directory in you sage install:

      sage/local/share/sage/ext/giac  and   sage/local/share/sage/ext/giac/user 


I have added a new version of the spkg with 1.1.1 giac sources.

I have updated the giac spkg to the current giac version (1.1.2 testing) but I have tested this only on linux, in particular I don't have informations on os 10.9 (although I can compile this giac version on freebsd11)
[https://www.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/sage/giac-1.1.2.spkg](https://www.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/sage/giac-1.1.2.spkg)

sample test:

```

It does not work on OSX 10.9, with "standard" Sage complier, i.e. gcc 4.7.3.
I still get things like

```
index.h:559:11: error: 'hash_map' in namespace 'std' does not name a type
```

(I also tried on Linux with gcc 4.8.something, and it worked there)
I'll try the experimental Sage gcc 4.8.1 package, see if it helps.

thank you, 
it could be a configure problem. could you have a look in your src/src/config.h about the values of this define

```
/* Define if <unordered_map> header is available */
#define C11_UNORDERED_MAP 1

...

/* Define if <ext/hash_map> header is aviailable */
#define EXT_HASH_MAP 1

/* Define if <hash_map> header is aviailable */
/* #undef HASH_MAP */

...

/* Define if <tr1/unordered_map> header is available */
#define UNORDERED_MAP 1

```

or try to force to 

#include <unordered_map>

in src/src/index.h
to see if the compilation goes on?

the 1st of these is undefined, the rest are defined in my case.

Probably your (and Redhat's) version of g++ is somehow different from the "normal" g++, and this makes the difference.

by the way, https://www.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/sage/giac-1.1.2.spkg is down.
Could you host it somewhere else?

On linux ubuntu 12.04 with gcc I have the same config.h as yours. 
(the previous config posted was with clang on freebsd, sorry I though it was closer to yours)

But I could have the same error as yours on os 10.7 with sage 5.6 and the sage gcc. 
I believe that the problem is this !defined(__APPLE__) line 47 of index.h

```
#if defined UNORDERED_MAP && !defined(__APPLE__) && !defined(__clang__) && !defined(VISUALC)
```

so it blocks the use of tr1/unordered_map.

I'have got success with the spkg and sage 5.6 on os 10.7 by changing  line 47 with:

```
#if defined UNORDERED_MAP && !defined(__clang__) && !defined(VISUALC)
```

does it works for you also?

NB: The link seems repaired, sorry I still have bad internet now.

yes it does. 

The spkg still needs a bit of cleaning though.
Also, currently it is an "old style" spkg.

If there is a "canonical" version of giac-1.1.2 somewhere it's better to provide it as the upstream tarball, and create patches; this is the "new style" of spkgs. See http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html

hello, so I have worked (and generated checksums) with the following upstream source

 [http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac/giac-1.1.1.tar.gz](http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac/giac-1.1.1.tar.gz)

(closed the 9 july 2014) because the 1.1.2 file will still evolve.

I have put the spkg scripts there:

[https://www.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/sage/giac.tar.bz2](https://www.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/sage/giac.tar.bz2)

For the cython interface giacpy, I have put the upstream source file:

[https://www.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/giacpy/sage/giacpy-0.4.tar.gz](https://www.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/giacpy/sage/giacpy-0.4.tar.gz)

and the spkg scripts there:

[https://www.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/giacpy/sage/giacpy.tar.bz2](https://www.imj-prg.fr/~frederic.han/xcas/giacpy/sage/giacpy.tar.bz2)

is it the correct way to distribute new spkg?

I got success with sage 6.2 on ubuntu 12.04 amd64 and osx 10.7.

Did you look at

http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html

The scripts should come as a git branch for the Sage git tree, so that they can be "installed" by doing git checkout, more or less, and certainly not by untarring tarballs...

Sorry for this mess with the git branch, but I am lost. I first could do:

git trac checkout 12375

but I failed to push (I though it was a space problem so I tried to change the branch name) but now I have a Couldn't find remote ref public/giac_spkg

I have also tried to create a new one with:
 git trac create 'giac new style spkg' -b public/giac_spkg
(ticket 16771)
and I could do: git trac checkout 16771

but when I do

git trac push

I have:

Do you use git trac extension (https://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command) ?

Do you have your ssh key etc already uploaded to trac, and are able to checkout stuff?

If this is working, the usual guess would be that one cannot have a space in the branch name. You may try pushing to public/blah instead.

Yes I have used git-trac and uploaded my pub key, but most likely I have an ssh problem. I have made many tries, and may be my key manager started to offer the bad keys but now here is my last situation from start:


```
macbookito(fred)$ git-trac config --user 'Han Frederic' --pass 'XXXXXXXXXX'
Saved trac username.
Saved trac password.
Trac xmlrpc URL:
    http://trac.sagemath.org/xmlrpc (anonymous)
    http://trac.sagemath.org/login/xmlrpc (authenticated)
    realm sage.math.washington.edu
Username: Han Frederic
Password: XXXXXXXXX
Retrieving SSH keys...
    2048 b4:a3:58:12:d8:ae:5d:51:36:1b:99:4b:77:1a:d3:b9  fred@macbookito (RSA)
macbookito(fred)$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command.git (push)
trac	git://trac.sagemath.org/sage.git (fetch)
trac	git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git (push)
macbookito(fred)$ 

```
so trac found my public key and to check that I have the corresponding private key:

```
macbookito(fred)$ ssh-keygen -l 
Enter file in which the key is (/home/fred/.ssh/id_rsa): /home/fred/.ssh/id_rsa-trac
2048 b4:a3:58:12:d8:ae:5d:51:36:1b:99:4b:77:1a:d3:b9  fred@macbookito (RSA)
```

but if I try to test ssh as in the sage doc the offering key fails

```
macbookito(fred)$ ssh -v -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa-trac git@trac.sagemath.org info

could my key manager (during my first tries) had started to offer too many bad keys so that I am blacklisted or I may have miss some config problem.

So you never see

```

in the log above?

When I try the same, I see

```
debug1: Server host key: RSA 97:e0:9a:4e:40:7f:00:63:f7:b9:e6:cf:dd:cb:d2:6c

seems like we are connecting to  different ssh servers...

to get giac to compile on my Debian system, I had to

```
apt-get install libtool gettext
```
Is this (more precisely, what extra libs need to be installed, compared to the standard Sage setup) mentioned in the spkg docs?

In giac's SPKG.txt I see

```
== Dependencies == 
  * gettext, readline, gmp 
  * giac will benefits of ntl, pari, mpfr, gsl, lapack but they should be already installed by sage.
```

gmp (more precisely, its clone) is provided by Sage (and so it should be removed from the fist *'d line.

the 2nd *'d line has a typo: "benefits" -> "benefit"

Yes I can reproduce all these diffs outside sage so it is not a problem of the spkg. For the loss in precision I have reported it on xcas forum to know if it is a long term change or a bug so I wait a little to know if it should be changed in giac.py.

But I have also looked at the cython interface and I found a problem that I didn't have with sage 5.11.

in the .pyx module I did:

```
cdef extern from "csage/interrupt.h":
    void setup_sage_signal_handler "setup_sage_signal_handler"()
setup_sage_signal_handler()
```
and it worked fine with sage 5.11. But with my sage 6.2, even if I do this in an empty module tutu.pyx, then after doing in sage:

```
import tutu
```
hitting a control-c in the prompt quits sage. Is there some way to set the good signal handler for interruptions?

you can just set up higher tolerance in the corresponding doctests.

did you check in 
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_cython.html#interrupt-and-signal-handling

It could be that things got changed there since 5.11 (I don't know for sure; ask on sage-develop if problems persist here). Do you do `sign_on` and `sign_off`  ?

Thank you for your answers, I have found more hints. In fact it is not a problem of sage 5.11 versus sage 6.2 but:

If giac is compiled without pari support then all is fine (without setup_sage_signal_handler()) while if I compile giac with pari support then I have the following problem (after hitting control-c).

```
sage: import giacpy
// Giac share root-directory:/usr/local/sage-6.2/local/share/giac/
// Using keyword file /usr/local/sage-6.2/local/share/giac/doc/fr/keywords
// Giac share root-directory:/usr/local/sage-6.2/local/share/giac/
Help file /usr/local/sage-6.2/local/share/giac/doc/fr/aide_cas not found
Added 0 synonyms
sage:   ***   user interrupt.
```
so it seems that my problem is that pari got the signal (there is no such message in giac sources).
is there a way to restore the signal to sage?

<div id="comment:67" align="right">comment:67</div>

In `spkg-install` you should properly document the reason why you add `--disable-pari`: the reason is that giac initializes the PARI library and Sage also does the same thing, leading to conflicts (these conflicts include but are not limited to interrupts).

As I said before, I don't like commented out code like

```
#./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --disable-gui --disable-gmpxx
```

There is also this line:

```
echo >&2 "Error installing libGAP."
```

In the giacpy `spkg-install`, you can remove

```
sage setup.py build_ext


if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    exit 1
fi
```

Thank you for your comments. I have asked B. Parisse to consider to offer the possibility to not initialize pari, it would be better to do this upstream. But with the current version of giac I have not noticed a loss of performance in symbolic computations, grobner basis... with --disable-pari.

I have also found a (minimal) conversion from giac to SR that the pexpect interface can do and not giacpy, so I plan to add this.

and some modifications in giacpy (because giac has an internal lock for pari, and it had to be resetted after an interruption) I can experience good results (both with giacpy and the external giac)
So I'd like to know how do you deal with the other similar situations to be coherent.

For the giac spkg, I believe that disabling pari for 1 year is not a big problem. Or whould you prefer some environment variable to let the choice during the install step? (But my feeling is that nobody will notice this possibility)

Cheers

Has this patch been submitted upstream to giac? If not, please do that and put a link to your upstream report on this ticket.

Why 1 year?

So I have submitted it: [http://xcas.e.ujf-grenoble.fr/XCAS/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1539](http://xcas.e.ujf-grenoble.fr/XCAS/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1539)

The current status is that the patch is included in the upstream source 1.1.2 08-Oct-2014 16:45. (it is not a frozen source)

Well it was just a rough estimate because one year ago I didn't knew any giac functions using pari that were not already in sage via pari. But now I saw some solve and resultant are also using pari, and I believe that it will increase.

> I froze version 1.1.2 2 days ago, but a few bugs were discovered just after (HP Prime bugs, geogebra regression tests and a bug from pocketcas), therefore I decided to update the tarball and stable binaries yesterday.

You should **never** update released tarballs. If there are bugs, just release 1.1.3 then.

It shouldn't. You really should change your release management procedures to fix this.

Why not add the subsubsubrelease number to the tarball name (`giac-1.1.2-8.tar.gz`)? Or, you could drop version numbers altogether and use dates (`giac-20141009.tar.gz`) like some other projects do.

But absolutely: **never** change a released tarball, no matter how bad/broken it is.

e.g. put the following in `configure.ac` and `Makefile.am`:

```
REVNUM=`date +%Y%m%d`
AC_SUBST(REVNUM)
```
then `$(REVNUM)` can be used in naming the tarball the `dist` target.

I mainly don't understand why you don't simply increase the version number. The second release of 1.1.2 should have been 1.1.3 and the most recent version should have been 1.1.4.

I don't understand: all you need to do to update the version number is to change one line in `configure.in` (and then obviously rerun the whole building process).
How does this take a couple of hours of your time, is hard to see.

What exactly do you need changed in your building procedure? And how would making it dependent on e.g. the date make it any faster?

And how often do they report a bug you already fixed, just because they have no means to see if you did an update of the tarball?

This won't give Sage a way to keep it up to day, as we certainly would have no idea whether a you did a hidden update of the tarball.

I believe that the situation would be less confusing if the current source tarball was not numbered (ex: giac-snapshot.tar.gz) or dated numbered.
(Except the ambiguity of the latest name, I can confirm that the older tarball were always trustworthy for checksums.)

Now you distribute binaries in your stable debian repo, (if I do dpkg-buildpackage it creates a giac_1.1.2-8.tar.gz source package) so could't you add it in your stable debian repo when you release a new stable package?

re-distributors can just refer to the tarball of the source published by the author, and distribute binaries.

GPL is also about **providing the source**, and the author can violate this rather easily. And the author would violate this part of GPL in this way, for after the change he did to the tarball of x.y.z, without bumping up the version, the sources don't match the binaries.

GPL is not only a copyright licence.
By releasing under GPL, the **author** has an obligation to release the source code (and moreover in the "preferred form"). You are not doing this, as I clearly explained.

Thank you!

I realize that on the computers where I tested my git built there is a ccobject.h in 
local/include/csage
but on a another one it is not there and the built of giacpy fails with this header not found because giacpy cimports Integer (and not ccobject.h directly)
Do you have any idea of what I should do?
Thanks
