Type polygon.options for a dictionary of the default options for polygons. 
```
This seems to not be correct.

```
sage: polygon.options
---------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'options'
```
We should fix the documentation to 

```
sage: sage.plot.polygon.polygon2d.options
{'alpha': 1, 'legend_label': None, 'rgbcolor': (0, 0, 1), 'thickness': 0}
```
or something else that fixes this.

```

sage: polygon2d.options

```
But for some reason the `options` never changed.

I've asked about this on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/3a4aa8c203c36c52).  But in any case if that doesn't work, it is also that way on disk and others (I've checked), so that wouldn't hold things up on this.  

Anyway, that means we just have to change to `polygon2d.reset()` and `polygon3d.reset()`.
