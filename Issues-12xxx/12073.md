If I use the generators for the exceptional group G_2(F_3) in its natural 7-dimensional representation over F_3 in the MatrixGroup constructor, the order of the group returned is 8491392 (twice what it should be). However, if I use the same generators through the gap console within sage, I get the correct size.

same problems for other finite fields of prime order

```
sage: p=5; L = [gap(GF(p)(i)) for i in range(p)]; L
[0*Z(5), Z(5)^0, Z(5), Z(5)^3, Z(5)^2]
```
versus

```
gap> p:=5; [0..p-1]*Z(p);
5
[ 0*Z(5), Z(5), Z(5)^2, Z(5)^0, Z(5)^3 ]
```
**EDIT**
Note also that 

```
gap> One(ZmodnZ(5));
Z(5)^0
gap> One(Z(5));
Z(5)^0
gap> One(GF(5));
Z(5)^0
```
So our conversion seems to be consistent with gap..

ok, so this must come from a confusion: in Gap, Z(5) is not the one of the finite field, but a generator of the group of invertible elements. This means that your matrices are not the correct ones, I think.

I propose to close this as invalid.

<a id='comment:13'>Comment 13:</a>
Confirmed:

```
gap> One(GF(5));
Z(5)^0
```
and replacing by the above yields:

```
gap> Order(Group( m1, m2 ));
8491392
```


From the [GAP manual](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap59.html):

> The root returned by `Z` is a generator of the multiplicative group of the finite field with p<sup>d</sup> elements, which is cyclic.
