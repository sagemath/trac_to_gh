As I think http://480.sagenb.org/home/pub/137/ amply illustrates, the mere existence of the untested and very buggy module sage.media.wav causes more confusion than it is worth for now.  It would be best to remove it from Sage, and only add something back as a result of a new (probably student) project to do things right.

Alternatively, doctest the code.  I've attached a patch to delete it, but maybe that is too draconian.

This is (very tangentially) related to #7668 and [this interact by Marshall](http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/misc#Hearingatrigonometricidentity).

Given that it's not the worst to eventually have easy-to-use wave handling, perhaps it would be appropriate to split the difference between doctesting and deleting.   Could one simply comment out all the code and raise (doctested?) `NotImplementedError`s for everything here?
