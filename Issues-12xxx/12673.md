As I think http://480.sagenb.org/home/pub/137/ amply illustrates, the mere existence of the untested and very buggy module sage.media.wav causes more confusion than it is worth for now.  It would be best to remove it from Sage, and only add something back as a result of a new (probably student) project to do things right.
