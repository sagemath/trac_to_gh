```
Currently, import_statements yields a name error if the class is not
imported in the Sage interpreter namespace. For example.

```
   sage: import_statements(ClonableIntArray)
   NameError: name 'ClonableIntArray' is not defined
```

With this patch, one can specify the object as a string, and the object
is looked up in all (imported) Sage modules.

```
    sage: import_statements("ClonableIntArray")
```

See the documentation for more examples.

This patch implements several heuristics to better handle ambiguous
names.
