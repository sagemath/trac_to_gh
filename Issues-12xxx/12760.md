This is due to a trivial programming error.  I already have an spkg fixing this, along with a moderate clean-up of the spkg.

See #12751 for the GCC-4.7.0 metaticket.

* #12760: Fix erroneous unconditional export of `CXXFLAG64`, which is now in

  export `CFLAG64`, which is only used within `spkg-install`.)
* Add further TODOs... ;-)

### gfan-0.4plus.p2 (Leif Leonhardy, March 25th 2012)
* #12760: Correct trivial C++ programming error to make gfan build with
  GCC 4.7.0.

That's one reason why I cc'ed the spkg maintainers... ;-) 

Note that Gfan 0.4plus is of late 2009; Gfan 0.5 was released more than a year ago.  Haven't checked whether the latter fixes the C++11 issues, but since it introduces new functionality (and probably also new bugs), I haven't tried using that.

Wuuuuu... Cleaned up a bit too much.

Needs correction w.r.t. exporting `CFLAG64` and especially `CXXFLAG64` (which is used in the patched Makefile), otherwise build fails on ia64 and most probably also 32-bit systems.

<a id='comment:9'></a>
From my updated `SPKG.txt`:

```
TODO:
 * Use `patch` to apply patches (then also add GNU patch to the dependencies).
 * Clean up `spkg-install` further w.r.t. installation etc.
 * Probably remove `CXXFLAG64` from the (patched) Makefile; instead put it
   into `LDFLAGS` and use these in the Makefile.
 * The Makefile is still suboptimal; e.g. Sage-specific values shouldn't be
   hardcoded into it.  That way we could provide a clean patch for upstream,
   and would later only have to change/set `make` variables in `spkg-install`,
   without the need to patch the Makefile at all for Sage.
   Also `CXXFLAGS` aren't used in, i.e. ignored by the current Makefile.
```

I'll probably fix *some* of these *here* **later**<sup>TM</sup> as well, especially item 1, and perhaps also items 3 and 2, but because of #11395, I won't do much more at the moment.
