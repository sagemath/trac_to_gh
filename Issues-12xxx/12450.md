<a id='comment:1'></a>Plan:
  
1. Implement the algorithm and make sure it passes a wide range of tests.  Done.

2. Get coverage to 100% so it can be included in Sage.  

3. Open a new ticket to rewrite key parts using Cython and more intelligent algorithms (in some cases), which should be dramatically faster, since most of the code is simple integer manipulation.
