There is no need to make full paths explicit - it is even an hindrance when one moves things around.

Since sage-env already sets PATH correctly, let's just use that.

The use of 'command' to test for the presence of an executable in the path is portable, as documented in this [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/592620/check-if-a-program-exists-from-a-bash-script).

With the current situation, sage-env makes sure the rest of sage has a good environment to work, but sage-sage decides it knows better and shortcuts it.

This is one of the situations I denounced on the sage-devel mailing-list, where sage is supposed to be modular but in fact isn't, because the modules don't just depend on each other's work : there are hidden, subtle places where they do their own thing.

I have a few patches up my sleeve to move things around ; they're not supposed to go upstream anytime soon. But they make some hidden things appear, so I fix them, and as it's interesting for upstream, I report immediately, with a proper fix, independent of my experiments.

To be fully honest, the goal of my not-for-upstream experiments is precisely to find modularity problems and fix them...

Julien, I'm not sure whether you're aware of that, but your patch changes in at least *some* situations the *fully intentional* behavior.

For example, a couple of Sage components / programs are *optional*, like e.g. `kash` or `Macaulay2`, and it is **not** intended to run a system-wide / non-Sage version of `kash` (that might be found along `PATH`) if one types `sage --kash`.  (Although I admit that the current response in case Sage's version *isn't* installed -- *"File not found"* -- is quite odd, i.e., not very user-friendly.)

In other cases a path is prepended *to make sure* we really run the correct instance of a Sage script, namely that of the *"current"* Sage installation, given by `SAGE_ROOT` (or `SAGE_LOCAL`), or to make sure our assumptions about the current directory (or other variable settings) are correct -- especially since different people develop things, sometimes perhaps too independently.  Not very pythonic, but similar to `assert()`, which at least *signals* errors [before things get worse and untraceable].

Redundancy is *necessary* to achieve some robustness, catch (and hopefully appropriately handle) errors when they occur, or as early as possible, e.g. if a script or program doesn't exist where it is supposed to be located, since we cannot rule out an installation gets messed up -- probably by Sage itself, due to bugs, if not by a user...

Well, in fact I did answer, but apparently I wasn't clear enough ; let's rephrase it with arrays.

The current situation is :
|         |             |            |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| in-sage | out-of-sage | what runs? |
| yes | yes | in-sage |
| yes | no  | in-sage |
| no | yes | error |
| no | no | error |

with my patch :
|         |             |            |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| in-sage | out-of-sage | what runs? |
| yes | yes | in-sage |
| yes | no  | in-sage |
| no | yes | out-of-sage |
| no | no | error |

and additionnally, using PATH instead of putting the PATH inside removes implicit dependencies, which makes sage really more modular (things can move around and that won't break).

> using PATH instead of putting the PATH inside removes implicit dependencies, which makes sage really more modular (things can move around and that won't break).

I don't really understand what you want to "move around".

As mentioned, the explicit paths, although (or because they are -- in a perfect world) redundant, are for safety reasons, since they lead to errors if a script is missing, i.e., not where it is supposed to be located.  That's IMHO just fine.  And I don't see what you want to make "more modular" there.

W.r.t. `sage --PROGRAM`:

If you want to run a system-wide installed version of R, type (*outside of* a Sage subshell) `R`.

If you want to run Sage's version of R, type `sage --R`, or type `R` from within a Sage subshell.

Same for optional components.  The following part of your patch is IMHO plain wrong:

Similar for *standard* components (and other scripts) of Sage, since if -- for whatever reason -- `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/<program>` is missing, which **is** an error, no other program along the path which happens to have the same name should be run; instead, an appropriate error message should be printed.

If you want to "move things around", why not create symbolic links in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`?

Or you have to be more explicit with *what* you want to move, or what should be more customizable.

Sigh.

First, you still mention "test -x" although I pointed out it's not the recommended way to check for an executable.

Second, as I already pointed out, my patch makes sage run sage versions by default if available. And if not available in sage, if they are available on the system, use that. The only error case is the one where indeed, it is really not available. That makes sense.

There seem to be a high dose of paranoia in sage developers about everything that doesn't come out of sage.

You still have to show me why I should be more cautious about running /usr/bin/kash : after all, sage runs on the system bash and uses the system libc! And for that last one, there are definitive reports where that gives problems and failed doctests -- I know it well, it's on ubuntu/ARM and I did the port!

My point is simple : from a sage-whatever-beta_n to sage-whatever-beta_{n+1}, 90% of the spkg are the same. So if I could make foo-3.14.spkg install in $HOME/sage/foo-3.14 and make the rest of sage use that (this is modularity -- the contrary of a one-block where nothing can move an hair's width without everything collapsing), then that means I can gain 90% of build time. And I have the room to have more versions of sage installed simultaneously.

And maintaining a big chunk of symlinks is a bad solution to a wrong problem.

You "pointed out" without saying why.  I think `test -x` is used perfectly here.

That's not really the point.  Within Sage, we have more control over the versions of the optional packages.  Also, nothing prevents you from running in a shell (either a Sage shell or not):

```
$ kash
```
It's as easy as that.

> My point is simple : from a sage-whatever-beta_n to sage-whatever-beta_{n+1}, 90% of the spkg are the same.

And I have the room to have more versions of sage installed simultaneously.

You could play with environment variables to solve this: apply patch #12647 and write in your `.sage/sagerc`:

```
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/sage/foo-3.14/local/bin"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/sage/foo-3.14/local/lib"
```
or something like this.

Why do you **insist** on running

```
sage --kash
```
as opposed to

```
kash
```

I don't insist on running "sage --kash".

I ran "make ptestlong" and it tried to run things using "sage --something".

Kash wasn't the problem ; I don't remember if it was ecl or scons... or something else... Of course the test failed : even though I made sure in sage-env it had what it takes in the PATH, the script didn't even see it!

I claim sage-as-it-is is broken because it can't accept a small change in a place without breaking in an unrelated place for no serious reason.

My patch doesn't break sage-as-it-is, and makes it more easy to modify in the future: tomorrow, you'll decide to put the executables in $SAGE/whatever/bin instead of $SAGE_LOCAL/bin. Of course, you'll modify sage-env to cope with the change. And it will still not work. Why? Because that script doesn't care about sage-env, it does it's own thing... and I claim that is wrong.

My patch makes it possible to change where sage finds executables in one sensible place instead of several.

I'm not telling you: "There is a theoretical issue, drop everything you do and work on it for me!". I'm telling you : "I made private changes, hit a practical issue, and even though you might not have met it yet, there's a chance you will, and here is a simple nice fix."

Does it sound that unreasonable?

That's simply bu!**sh!**.  First of all, I did mention `command -v` as well, and more importantly, `test -x` and `command` have different use cases.  Nobody claimed that `command` wasn't portable; we use it in many places of Sage -- *where it is appropriate*.




> You "pointed out" without saying why.  I think `test -x` is used perfectly here.

It is.




> > Second, as I already pointed out, my patch makes sage run sage versions by default if available. And if not available in sage, if they are available on the system, use that. The only error case is the one where indeed, it is really not available.

> As I (and leif, for once I agree with him)

:-)

> have said, sage --COMMAND is supposed to run the Sage version of COMMAND.

And if `sage --PROGRAM` should run external versions at all, then the help messages would have to be changed as well, which your patch **doesn't**, although it changes the (btw. intuitive) behavior:

```sh
     echo "  -kash [...]         -- run Sage's Kash with given arguments"
...
     echo "  -M2 [...]           -- run Sage's Macaulay2 with given arguments"
```

(And if there happen to be system-wide versions along the path, there's no mention that Sage's optional packages could be installed [in case they aren't already].  People frequently have completely outdated, incompatible or broken versions installed -- sometimes even not to their knowledge, which is *one* reason Sage ships such a lot, or at least offers such components as optional packages.)  




> > There seem to be a high dose of paranoia in sage developers about everything that doesn't come out of sage.

Sometimes for good reason; see above.

And as mentioned, it's better to not blindly trust even the Sage installation itself, since its integrity is not necessarily an invariant, especially if users (and developers, which most people of the Sage community intentionally don't differentiate) "play" with it.

Not in an "unrelated place", nor for no reason: `ptestlong` checks whether the installation went (or is still) ok, and testing whether programs installed by Sage *are* where they belong (or have been installed), and whether they work, is just part of that.

If you change their locations, you'd obviously also have to change these tests.

Oh, dear, that was the thing I missed to understand!

Ok, so when "make ptestlong" runs "sage --something", it really checks :
1. things are at the right place ;
2. things work ;
3. things work correctly.

I was only considering points 2 and 3 since the beginning! My patch does indeed break point 1.

Now, I still think there are things to fix :
1. checking that something was installed at the right place should be done by something.spkg, not in somewhere unrelated -- that will cover 1 where it should be covered ;
2. and then my patch should be applied, because now the implicit constraint will be satisfied in an explicit way by a proper test somewhere.

<div id="comment:24" align="right">Comment 24</div>

How about introducing `SAGE_BINARIES_PATH`? (to be optionally set by the user; containing a colon-separated list of directories to search for *Sage* programs and scripts)

(`sage-env` would probably *pre*pend e.g. `"$SAGE_LOCAL/bin:"` if `SAGE_BINARIES_PATH` is non-empty, otherwise set it to the former.)

Then we could use (logically)

```sh
PATH="$SAGE_BINARIES_PATH" command -v FOO >/dev/null || echo "Sage's FOO is not installed..."
```
or

```sh
PATH="$SAGE_BINARIES_PATH" command FOO
# exit status 127 would (usually) tell that FOO wasn't found (along $SAGE_BINARIES_PATH)
```
and similar.

A potential problem being that FOO would inherit the modified `PATH` in the second example; we could therefore also use

```sh
prog=`PATH="$SAGE_BINARIES_PATH" command -v FOO`
if [[ -z $prog ]]; then
    # FOO isn't installed anywhere along $SAGE_BINARIES_PATH
else
    # found; for example run FOO:
    $prog
fi
```




Better names appreciated.  `SAGE_PATH` is unfortunately already used for a slightly different purpose.

The build system proposed in http://wiki.sagemath.org/BuildSystemSEP (#14796), provides options to disable packages (and falling back to already installed things outside of sage). also sage (the library) needs to work without the distribution.

Finally, under some circumstances, sage --PROGRAM needs to just use plain $PATH. And it always should.

So lets solve this problem at its root:
* sage (the distribution) places a dummy into $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/p for all enabled packages p, if such a file doesnt exist (or more dummies if needed)
* installation of a package will replace these dummies
* sage (the distribution) clears these dummies upon disabling a package (which also triggers uninstall)
* sage (the environment) just sets PATH=$(SAGE_LOCAL)/bin:$PATH (as it currently does)
* sage (the library) works outside sage (the distribution) without headache

To deal with even more paranoia, sage (the distribution) could also include a list of header and library locations for each package. Placed in a similar way, respective files could make sure gcc won't fall back to /usr/include or /usr/lib without your consent.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A34):
> Is it subsumed by #14796?

yes, in #14796, '$PATH' is used to locate executables. it is a good idea to to so, whether or not a dummy wall or a configuarable toplevel build system exists.

... and while you/someone are/is at it: the code may be reworded to

```
arg=${1/--/-}
case $arg in
    -axiom|-combinat|-gap|-gp|-singular|-sqlite3|-twistd|-ecl|\
    -kash|-maxima|-mwrank|-M2|-scons|-python|-ipython|-R)
        shift
        exec "${arg#-}" "$@"
    ;;
    -lisp)
        shift
        exec "ecl" "$@"
    ;;
esac
```
, so it will even fit on a single screen.

IMHO the whole `sage -foo` script is a mistake. If you want to use Sage's version of binaries, you put them into your path, should be as easy as that. Of course this assumes proper rpaths for libraries instead of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` hack.

In any case, until then we should just implement the proposed workaround.

- if you run `sage --kash`, should it run a system version of kash if Sage's optional kash spkg hasn't been installed, or not?

DWIM (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM) is pretty unambiguous here. Having typed that command, do I want kash to run or do I want to get some obscure error even though kash is actually on my computer?

- in the old version there was some redundancy: the path to `gap`, for example, was explicit, to make sure that Sage's version of GAP was used. Is this redundancy important?

Thats really just a corollary to the first point---we should make the best effort to get gap up and running, otherwise our user interface is crap.

- the message for `sage --help` says that `sage --M2` (for example) runs "Sage's Macaulay2", but this is no longer accurate with the current patch.

This is now #15538
