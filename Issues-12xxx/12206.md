I've discovered that even after building dozen(s) of packages, I still can't do

```
$ ./sage -sh
```
or even

```
$ ./sage -i <packagename>
```
in Sage anymore.  This is annoying.  The reason is because the sage_scripts spkg is not getting installed. 

Looking at the spkg-install for this package shows that it has a strange dependency setup:  (1) if sage is being upgraded, *then* this package depends on Mercurial being installed, but (2) if this is a fresh install, then this package does not depend on Mercurial being installed.    In case (1), Mercurial is of course installed, so the dependency is always satisfied.  

I just looked at spkg/deps and the deps line for this spkg is:

```
$(INST)/$(SAGE_SCRIPTS): $(BASE)
        +$(PIPE) "$(SAGE_SPKG) $(SAGE_SCRIPTS) 2>&1" "tee -a $(SAGE_LOGS)/$(SAGE_SCRIPTS).log"
```

So the change I'm suggesting in this patch is minimal and shouldn't cause any trouble.

Anyway, I very strongly object to sage_scripts getting installed late in the process or having any dependencies.

The hg dependency is only needed on upgrade, at which point we definitely already have hg installed. 

If you have done a lot of porting work on Sage (as I have over the years), you'll realize pretty quickly the critical importance of having "sage -sh" and "sage -i" (and friends) all work as early as possible.

E.g., if I do \"sage -i foo.spkg\", then sage-pkg or something like that gets called.  \n\nBoth sage-spkg and sage-env are already in SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base, and will be moved (in #11073) to the root repo, so they are present right from the start.  I think Jeroen's point is to make sure that the really crucial scripts \u2014 these two and sage-sage \u2014 are in the root repo, since we need these two, and as you note, we might also want sage-sage, at the start of the build process.\n\nCan you think of other scripts that are useful to have in the middle of the build process?\n\nAnyway, moving sage-sage to the root repo might accomplish what you're trying to do here, but more reliably, without just hoping that changing the order in the prerequisites will have the desired effect.  (We can also reorder the prereqs as in this patch \u2013 this ticket should be merged \u2013 but Jeroen's idea also seems good.)\n\n> 2.

Both sage-spkg and sage-env are already in SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base, and will be moved (in #11073) to the root repo, so they are present right from the start.  I think Jeroen's point is to make sure that the really crucial scripts — these two and sage-sage — are in the root repo, since we need these two, and as you note, we might also want sage-sage, at the start of the build process.

Can you think of other scripts that are useful to have in the middle of the build process?

Anyway, moving sage-sage to the root repo might accomplish what you're trying to do here, but more reliably, without just hoping that changing the order in the prerequisites will have the desired effect.  (We can also reorder the prereqs as in this patch – this ticket should be merged – but Jeroen's idea also seems good.)

> 2. Regarding #11073 -- let's just NOT make sage_scripts depend on sage_root. Why should it? 

I wonder if we can make sage_scripts depend on sage_root only when upgrading, not in a build from scratch.

I see.  I had completely missed the point.  If both "sage -i" and "sage -sh" work from the start, I'll be very happy.  I can't really think of anything else that one needs that early.   Thanks for clarifying this!
