Nice ticket description.

Note that Sage's readline spkg intentionally **doesn't use** the termcap shipped with Sage (which only builds a *static* library), so this ticket is in principle invalid as it suggests (or manifests) false assumptions.

Well, that's far from clear when reading `spkg/standard/deps`.  I don't think it's a problem though to have readline depend on termcap, in case we ever change our mind on readline/termcap.
