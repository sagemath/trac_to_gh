`LyndonWords`, when applied to a composition starting with 0's, gives a wrong result, e.g.:

```
for w in LyndonWords(list([0,1])):
    print w
```
return 1 instead of 2, and in a similar vein

```
for w in LyndonWords(list([0,2])):
    print w
```
return '12' 

The problem is also described here : http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/5c4b691a692b56b0#

The problem is that necklace._sfc() ignores 0's at the begining of a list.

A modified lyndon_word.py file which fix the problem is attached.
