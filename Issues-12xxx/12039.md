I was googling for `LazyFormat` when I stumbled here.

One remark: There is no need to use `LazyFormat` if the result is a plain string. Just use the string itself. The purpose of `LazyFormat` is the following: when you have 

```
lz=LazyFormat("... %s ...")%(obj)
``` 
it defers the computation of `__repr__(obj)` until one call `__repr__(lz)`. So that, 

```
LazyFormat("Message")%(())
``` 
is really some kind of overkill.

A followup for my last remark. The idea of `LazyFormat` is to be able to
print counter examples in the error message for `TestSuite` when a property is
wrong, without drastically slowing down the tests. I would therefore suggest
to replace

```python
tester.assertTrue(self(a, self(b, v)) == self(a*b, v), 
                  LazyFormat("Multiplication is not associative")%(())) 
```  
by

```python
tester.assertTrue(self(a, self(b, v)) == self(a*b, v), 
    LazyFormat("Multiplication is not associative: %s*(%s*%s) != (%s*%s)*%s")%(a,b,v,a,b,v))
```
And similarly for the other one.

Also in the category directory, the usage is to place the example in the
subdirectory examples. An action isn't really a category, but I think it would
be good to have all the examples there. Moreover, don't forget to add your
very nice example in the reference manual (file: `doc/en/reference/categories.rst`).

By the way: thanks a lot for writing all this nice documentation.

More remarks:

- There is an empty `Example::` section for `_extend_G(self, K):`.

- you should put hyperlinks ref for <code>:class:`sage.matrix.action.MatrixMatrixAction`</code>  line 14 in `sage/categories/action.pyx`, as well as in

 ```
 17	See sage.structure.coerce_actions and sage.matrix.action for examples of Actions  
 18	used in the coercion system, and sage.structure.coerce and sage.structure.parent 
 19	for the code that uses them. 
 ```
 Note: I didn't look exhaustively for missing hyperlinks.

Sorry for asking all these modifications. More review tomorrow morning, I'm off to bed.

I guess the problem is that #715 was merged in 5.1.beta0
This ticket also brings notable changes to the Action class and adds a bunch of doc to the file, so rebasing this ticket might be non trivial (from what I've seen of the patches, the changes are even more intrusive than what was done in #715).
