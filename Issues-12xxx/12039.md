I was googling for `LazyFormat` when I stumbled here.

One remark: There is no need to use `LazyFormat` if the result is a plain string. Just use the string itself. The purpose of `LazyFormat` is the following: when you have 

```
lz=LazyFormat("... %s ...")%(obj)
``` 
it defers the computation of `__repr__(obj)` until one call `__repr__(lz)`. So that, 

```
LazyFormat("Message")%(())
``` 
is really some kind of overkill.

A followup for my last remark. The idea of `LazyFormat` is to be able to
print counter examples in the error message for `TestSuite` when a property is
wrong, without drastically slowing down the tests. I would therefore suggest
to replace

```python
tester.assertTrue(self(a, self(b, v)) == self(a*b, v), 
                  LazyFormat("Multiplication is not associative")%(())) 
```  
by

```python
tester.assertTrue(self(a, self(b, v)) == self(a*b, v), 
    LazyFormat("Multiplication is not associative: %s*(%s*%s) != (%s*%s)*%s")%(a,b,v,a,b,v))
```
And similarly for the other one.

Also in the category directory, the usage is to place the example in the
subdirectory examples. An action isn't really a category, but I think it would
be good to have all the examples there. Moreover, don't forget to add your
very nice example in the reference manual (file: `doc/en/reference/categories.rst`).

By the way: thanks a lot for writing all this nice documentation.

More remarks:

- There is an empty `Example::` section for `_extend_G(self, K):`.

- you should put hyperlinks ref for `:class:`sage.matrix.action.MatrixMatrixAction``  line 14 in `sage/categories/action.pyx`, as well as in
 {{{
 17	See sage.structure.coerce_actions and sage.matrix.action for examples of Actions  
 18	used in the coercion system, and sage.structure.coerce and sage.structure.parent 
 19	for the code that uses them. 
 }}}
 Note: I didn't look exhaustively for missing hyperlinks.

Sorry for asking all these modifications. More review tomorrow morning, I'm off to bed.

I guess the problem is that #715 was merged in 5.1.beta0
