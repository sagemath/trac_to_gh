<a id='comment:5'>**Comment 5:**</a>
here is a fix : http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/ratpoints-2.1.3.tar.bz2
(I moved the only nested function outside; it works with gcc, and passes the tests (in sage)). Wonder how it goes with clang...

Still needs a bit of cleaning.

Honestly, it doesn't. Reducing your number of dependencies because another one, better maintained, can provide the same functionality is not controversial in my opinion. Who doesn't like less maintenance.

The PARI developers are not just "anybody" :-) I trust that they know number theory. Besides, the way that I understand things, the code in PARI is actually based on this `ratpoints` package. They didn't write it from scratch.

"better" maintained? I don't think that `ratpoints` is maintained *at all* given that the latest release is from 2011.
