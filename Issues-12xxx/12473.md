Honestly, it doesn't. Reducing your number of dependencies because another one, better maintained, can provide the same functionality is not controversial in my opinion. Who doesn't like less maintenance.

ratpoints implements a very tricky mathematics, not something anybody can write. Having more than one implementation is a blessing.

The PARI developers are not just "anybody" :-) I trust that they know number theory. Besides, the way that I understand things, the code in PARI is actually based on this `ratpoints` package. They didn't write it from scratch.

"better" maintained? I don't think that `ratpoints` is maintained *at all* given that the latest release is from 2011.
