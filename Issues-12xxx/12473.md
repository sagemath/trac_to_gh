here is a fix : http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/ratpoints-2.1.3.tar.bz2
(I moved the only nested function outside; it works with gcc, and passes the tests (in sage)). Wonder how it goes with clang...

Still needs a bit of cleaning.

Yes indeed, it looks like I messed up when importing Dima's branch.

As for the version bump. Yes I know we could do that. But really we didn't change any functionality, we just made it possible to compile with other compilers. But OK the patch is not trivial.

"better" maintained? I don't think that `ratpoints` is maintained *at all* given that the latest release is from 2011.
