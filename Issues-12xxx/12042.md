** *** Please close (fixed) *** **

With the last VM images there was a change from Vmware to Virtual Box.

THere is still plenty of old documentation around, especially on the homepage.

To avoid confusion and angry people it would be wise to make an consistent update.

I emailed H. Schilly to please remove all stray Readme Files with the exception of Readme-Virtualbox.txt.
Of course there is probably some info elsewhere (wikki?). Considering the fact that the VM is the single most downloaded version of sage it would deserve better dokumentation (e.g. test and Howto for the main virtualisation software (VirtualBox, Vmware, Quemu-kvm, Xen).

Found another
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/binary.html

for further instructions on installing Sage on Windows. Be sure to read the file README.txt.

where the README.tyt link is broken

http://www.sagemath.org/download-windows.html
says:
To run Sage on Microsoft Windows you need the following:

1. VirtualBox for Windows or VMWare Player
2. Then run the downloaded VirtualBox or VMWare Distribution of Sage and follow 

Best to remove VMware from this description, or stat something like:
"Currently the use of VirtualBox is supported, although other Virtualisation tools (like VMWare Player or Quemu-kvm are possible." a native speaker should write this :-)

2 links for additional instructions are broken!

http://www.sagemath.org/download.html
also broken link for additional instructions

What about this?

I think though, there should be still a change in the homepage in the following paragraph:
****[http://sagemath.org/download-windows.html](http://sagemath.org/download-windows.html)****

Usage
To run Sage on Microsoft Windows you need the following:

1. VirtualBox for Windows >> or VMWare Player << :: suggested: just skip this 
2. Then run the downloaded VirtualBox >>or VMWare Distribution<< of Sage and follow these additional instructions. :: suggested: just skip this

>> Note: Please read these additional instructions. << ::This is a dublication of the previous, suggestion is to skip it.


:: also the following part is not really up to date:

>>Another possibility is to run Sage inside Wubi. Wubi is a Linux Ubuntu installation inside Windows.<< :: comment: Wubi is definitly possible, but the last time I tested to to run the precombiled binaries in a Wubi install it failed.

Sage depends on many components which are not yet available for Microsoft Windows. A native port is in the works. The current VirtualBox Image provides you with an encapsulated and tested system and contains everything and needs nearly no configuration. 

:: I would just write like this:
Sage depends on many components which are not (yet?) available for Microsoft Windows. The current VirtualBox Image provides you with an encapsulated and tested system and contains everything and needs nearly no configuration.

Other Methods to run Sage on a Windows system:
In developement:  Cygwin port of Sage (join the effort)
Tested: Use the Sage Live CD / USB
Beta: Use the windows installer of the Live CD to have a dual boot system. (read instructions here)
Other methods which were successfully applied, but may or may not work for you:
Virtual Images provided by the Community: Gentoo or Puppy Linux
Ubuntu Wubi install
Andlinux/Colinux

And on
**[http://sagemath.org/download.html](http://sagemath.org/download.html)**

there is

Microsoft Windows  	
# To run Sage on Microsoft Windows you need the following: Image of a Sage installation for virtualization
# Read these additional instructions.
Sage depends on many components which are not yet available for Microsoft Windows. A native port is in the works. The current >>VMware<< Image provides you with an encapsulated and solid tested system and contains everything and needs nearly no configuration. 

this should be replaced by >>Virtual<<, then it is neutral.

The example html file looks good, huge improvement. Some suggestions:

"downloaded *ova image* of Sage" --> "Sage ".ova" file that you can download on the Sage download page". (may be easier to understand for average Windows user)

"current VirtualBox Image" --> "Sage VirtualBox installation" (may be easier to understand for average Windows user)

"and contains" --> ", which contains" (too many "and"s)

"In developement: Help efforts for a": depelopment has only 3 e's, I don't know what "Help efforts for a" means, perhaps just remove these 4 words?

Suggested change to [http://sagemath.org/download.html](http://sagemath.org/download.html) is very good.

I think "It allows to use" should be "It allows you to use" or "It enables you to use".

In the "Other -- unsupported ..." part, I would put the Live CD options at the end, as they require the users to exit Windows. At least they should be right below each other.

This text - including the links were ment as suggestion or a base for discussion (2 months ago). In the meantime focus has changed quite a bit, from the never ending story Cygwin to an improved Virtual Image.  I am absolutely ignorant of the technical requirements and details of the homepage.So I believe the text on the homepage could use an immediate improvement, please optimize links etc as necessary and possible.

Also I think A final text should get approved by Volker Braun. He maintains the VM image and I know thats a lot of work, so the text should not be published without his consent.

Hi Harald, if you could make these changes, I think as soon as possible would be best. We are currently pointing potential users in the wrong direction with the word VMWare in step 1.

@mstreng: i modified the download-windows.html page, according to the last version by emil. looks good so far.

`@`emil: just for the future, better don't bother editing the html. you modified the rendered output, not the actual page at that location. also, there are tags like ol, ul, li and h3 for the layout that you have actually meant :-)

also, i modified the download.html page. i think you have just missed that? there is a shortened version of this page now.

Thanks!

I suppose we can have this ticket closed as "fixed" now? Or are there more pages that refer to VMWare?

@haraldschilly

Sorry for my ignorance about thos html things.

How can I edit html code on the homepage directly? I guess I lack permissions ...

more pages (only small things):

at the download page maybe remove the readme-virtualbox.txt, it is redundant with the readme.text.

http://wiki.sagemath.org/faq has two questions which mention VMware, Those refer to the older ubuntu based machine. The info is currently outdated, but not wrong. Maybe add something like:

This info may be outdated because Sage uses a VirtualBox image since version 4.7.1
