PariError:  (5)
```
This bug was probably introduced with the recent Pari upgrade, as older versions of Sage do output `False`.

I've reported it upstream as this is clearly a Pari bug:

```
? issquarefree(0)
  ***   at top-level: issquarefree(0)
  ***                 ^---------------
  *** issquarefree: zero argument in an arithmetic function.
  ***   Break loop: type 'break' to go back to GP
```

In older Pari versions we do get 0 as output.
