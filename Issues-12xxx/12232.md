I'm not sure if this is working as intended but in its current form the interrupt command interrupts the entire worksheet with no option to interrupt a particular cell. This can be a problem if you have a steady stream of computations on the queue and you only need to interrupt one of them. I suggest that the interrupt command accept an optional cell argument to indicate that a specific cell is to be interrupted; otherwise interrupt the worksheet to remain consistent with the current behavior.

Attachment: **[trac_12232_interrupt_behavior.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12232/trac_12232_interrupt_behavior.patch.gz)**

The `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb` that is shipped with current versions of Sage is no longer under development. It has been superseded by the so-called Flask notebook, which has been rewritten during 2011 to use Flask as its webapp backend. Development is currently being migrated from Google Code to GitHub: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb

While it is not shipped with Sage, the Flask notebook can be installed into Sage with some effort (see instructions at http://code.google.com/r/jasongrout-flask-sagenb/ ). This has been done on, for example, http://sagenb.org/ .

So it is probably more worthwhile for you to hack on the Flask notebook. Unfortunately the code you are patching is [marked as broken](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/blob/master/sagenb/simple/twist.py#L8), so a lot more work would be required, it seems.

Sorry about this not being self-evident from the documentation / other sources...

Thanks for the update, kini.

If the simple server API ever gets ported to the Flask version, I hope this issue and #9785 are taken into account so that the same mistakes are not repeated. Otherwise, I have found the simple server API to be quite useful.

    "body": "<a id='comment:11'>Comment 11:</a>\nwrt sage tickets vs sagenb tickets, I feel like sagenb might be reabsorbed into sage at some point. People split it off as a separate project so they could rapidly redo it in Flask, but development has really trailed off since that big push in 2011, and Sage is switching to git anyway so sagenb doesn't need to be a separate project to take advantage of DVCS nimbleness. Plus now there's cloud.sagemath.org and the ipython notebook so in the future sagenb might be fighting a war on two fronts (as a multi-user UI and a single-user UI respectively) to stay relevant as a project. Just my impression of the situation, which could of course be completely wrong. I'm not paying much attention to the Sage world recently...\n\nAnyway, another option is just to say the simple server API has been removed and mark all these tickets as invalid.",

<a id='comment:11'>Comment 11:</a>
wrt sage tickets vs sagenb tickets, I feel like sagenb might be reabsorbed into sage at some point. People split it off as a separate project so they could rapidly redo it in Flask, but development has really trailed off since that big push in 2011, and Sage is switching to git anyway so sagenb doesn't need to be a separate project to take advantage of DVCS nimbleness. Plus now there's cloud.sagemath.org and the ipython notebook so in the future sagenb might be fighting a war on two fronts (as a multi-user UI and a single-user UI respectively) to stay relevant as a project. Just my impression of the situation, which could of course be completely wrong. I'm not paying much attention to the Sage world recently...

Anyway, another option is just to say the simple server API has been removed and mark all these tickets as invalid.

Also, note that at least some of the code still is in sagenb/simple/twist.py and likely will stay there, so the opportunity is still there to "port" it.
