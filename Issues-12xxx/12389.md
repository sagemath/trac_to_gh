Attachment: **[trac_12389.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12389/trac_12389.patch.gz)**

Without the patch, I observe the same error than the reported one.

With the patch:

```
sage: sub = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: sub.complement().chromatic_number(algorithm="MILP")
5
```

So I give a positive review.
