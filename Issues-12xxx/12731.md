Maxima's `abs_integrate` contributed package gives us lots of nice new integrals, but also really breaks a lot of stuff, apparently.  Add to this list as you see fit:
* #13733 Incorrect integral in Maxima
* #11590 Integrating the sgn() function can produce incorrect results
* #14591 cosh integral incorrect because of abs_integrate
* #16643 integrate() infinite loop
* #17183 Yet another abs_integrate trig integral problem
* #17468 Strange integration error/hang with log(abs(sin(x)))
* #17511 Get integral of abs(sin(x)) and abs(cos(x)) right
* #17910
* #23271
* #24117
* This is also blocking update to maxima 5.42, #26625

Old:

Can someone more knowledgeable about using maxima for integration determine what the right warning to show is and when to show it?  See #12691 for what a stopgap is.

I'm not really sure that this is appropriate for a stopgap.  I mean, unless we put in a catch for the *specific* form like `integrate(x * sgn(x^2 - 1/4), x, -1, 0)`, we would have to put in a stopgap for the entire integration, which is ridiculous.  

Unless we checked for the signum function with nonlinear operands in it sometime... but that's more than I have time to parse now.

Does that sound reasonable?

Yes, and it's the only option because that package causes so much collateral damage, not only in `integrate`. Turning it off only triggers a few minor doctest failures, most of them (9) in `interfaces/maxima_lib.py`.

This commit removes the package, fixes/moves doctests. I have put those doctests testing the `abs_integrate` package into the wishlist #17910.

If someone is not comfortable doing this "silently", using expression tree walking I could add checks for `abs` and `sgn` and output ... what? Note, some integrals are now solved by Maxima proper.

what is about a kind of  experimental mode in sage ?
if enabled by the user, functions like above became available, otherwise they stay out.

Personally, I'm against accepting broken or half-baked functionality because as rws says, it is too destructive. I'm experiencing this everyday with Singular CAS. People start using new functionality (which is often only experimental ) and then  **almost everything** is broken and cannot be easily fixed. Tests? Ahahaha !!

I would rather disable this than have it give wrong answers, but it looks like it should be possible to emit a warning only when abs_integrate is actually used. According to the [Maxima documentation](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/de/maxima_31.html#SEC218), there is a list of extra integration methods that maxima will attempt if the standard `integrate` fails:

```
Option variable: extra_integration_methods

    Default value: ['signum_int, 'abs_integrate_use_if]

    The list extra_integration_methods is a list of functions for integration. When integrate is unable to find an antiderivative, Maxima uses the methods in extra_integration_methods to attempt to determine an antiderivative. 
```

If we set this variable to the empty list, then no additional integrations will be attempted by Maxima (by default). But, we can still try them ourselves. So we could,

1. Try the standard Maxima `integrate`, and save the result.
2. Try `signum_int`, and see if the result matches the first one. If it does, ignore it. Otherwise, emit a warning and return the answer.
3. Try `abs_integrate_use_if`, and see if the result matches the first one. If it does, ignore it. Otherwise, emit a warning and return the answer.

Otherwise, emit a warning and return the answer.\n\nThat's an excellent find and it allows us to have much finer grained control over what integration methods should be tried. However, I'm not so sure that \"printing a warning\" is the right solution. There's a problem with stopgap messages in general:\n- they just get printed. They can easily get lost if a lot of other output gets printed.\n- they only get printed once. We're dealing here with an issue that only applies to certain integrals. We assume you're OK as long as the message is printed. When you run into the message, then the result you're looking at at that moment is suspect. After that one, the message doesn't get printed anymore, so you should consider all subsequent results suspect. However, since the behaviour is much more similar to the pre-message situation, it's easy to think that fresh computations in the same session are NOT suspect.\n\nI think it is better to simply NOT try the suspect integration methods upon a normal integral invocation and only resort to them when a special command/flag is given, e.g.:\n\n```\nsage: integrate(abs(sin(x)),x,0,pi)\nintegrate(abs(sin(x)), x, 0, pi)\nsage: integrate(abs(sin(x)),x,0,pi, algorithm=\"spaced_out_maxima\")\n0\n```\nor whatever access method we want to use (and whatever result we get from that).\n\nIn any case, we also need to clear `extra_definite_integration_methods`.",

Replying to [@orlitzky](#comment%3A23):

That's an excellent find and it allows us to have much finer grained control over what integration methods should be tried. However, I'm not so sure that "printing a warning" is the right solution. There's a problem with stopgap messages in general:
- they just get printed. They can easily get lost if a lot of other output gets printed.
- they only get printed once. We're dealing here with an issue that only applies to certain integrals. We assume you're OK as long as the message is printed. When you run into the message, then the result you're looking at at that moment is suspect. After that one, the message doesn't get printed anymore, so you should consider all subsequent results suspect. However, since the behaviour is much more similar to the pre-message situation, it's easy to think that fresh computations in the same session are NOT suspect.

I think it is better to simply NOT try the suspect integration methods upon a normal integral invocation and only resort to them when a special command/flag is given, e.g.:

```
sage: integrate(abs(sin(x)),x,0,pi)
integrate(abs(sin(x)), x, 0, pi)
sage: integrate(abs(sin(x)),x,0,pi, algorithm="spaced_out_maxima")
0
```
or whatever access method we want to use (and whatever result we get from that).

In any case, we also need to clear `extra_definite_integration_methods`.

Is that ticket really needs_review ? The last comments point to a needs_work.

And notice that a needs_review ticket with no author won't suit Volker :-P

It won't, because it will always return something like this:

```
sage: integrate(1/(1 + abs(x+1) + abs(x-1)),x)
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'if(-(_SAGE_VAR_x+1)>0,-log(1-2*_SAGE_VAR_x)/2+log(3)-2/3,if(-(_SAGE_VAR_x-1)>0,_SAGE_VAR_x/3+log(3)/2-1/3,log(2*_SAGE_VAR_x+1)/2))' in Sage

I would be in favor of this, and would give positive review to changes disabling by default but allowing this.  I think it would be pretty easy to implement, in fact.
* Keep `abs_integrate` loading initially in `maxima_lib.py`.
* Immediately set the two `methods` to `[]`, perhaps right with `init_code.append('nolabels : true')` a few lines later.
* Then add an integrator in `src/sage/symbolic/integration/external.py`, something like

```
def maxima_absint_integrator(expression, v, a=None, b=None):
    from sage.calculus.calculus import maxima
    maxima.eval("extra_definite_integration_methods=['abs_defint]")
    maxima.eval("extra_integration_methods=['signum_int]") # NOT using the if variant
    if not isinstance(expression, Expression):
        expression = SR(expression)
    if a is None:
        result = maxima.sr_integral(expression,v)
    else:
        result = maxima.sr_integral(expression, v, a, b)
    maxima.eval("extra_definite_integration_methods=[]")
    maxima.eval("extra_integration_methods=[]") # NOT using the if variant
    return result._sage_()
```
* Then in `src/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py` just add

```
import sage.symbolic.integration.external as external
available_integrators['maxima'] = external.maxima_integrator
available_integrators['maxima_absint'] = external.maxima_absint_integrator
available_integrators['sympy'] = external.sympy_integrator
available_integrators['mathematica_free'] = external.mma_free_integrator
available_integrators['fricas'] = external.fricas_integrator
```
  and port doctests, with a humongous warning not to use this unless you are willing to check answers numerically or something.

That could, in principle, be a separate ticket, but I would want them to depend upon each other.  Also, that wouldn't remove the necessity of #17910.

By the way, it's interesting that http://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2242/#8ddc suggests that adding `'integrate` to the methods lists could actually do at least some of these integrals...

Thanks - I wish there was a better fix than disabling.   Can you briefly comment on 
* The removal of the radexpand example
* the `known bug` ones
I'm sure they are quite logical but a quick glance fails to reveal it, as opposed to where you put the unevaluated integral in to replace the `abs_integrate` behavior.

Or maybe this was already present behavior and you really did just refresh this, in which case no worries.  It seems like [comment:33](#comment%3A33) was the last substantive part of the discussion and memory fails.

Tagging by `known bug` allows to remember that one could hope for the answer displayed. I think Jeroen suggested to keep the doctest in this way, rather than remove them.

And the `radexpand` example no longer works without `abs_integrate`, just returning unevaluated.
