The python spkg should not use parallel "make install".  This is claimed to be fixed in the spkg, but it actually isn't done properly.  There are some comments in `spkg-install` about how to fix it.

Also, the python library should be installed with writable permission 0755, instead of 0555.

To make the redirection work properly.  The following are equivalent:

```
A >/dev/null && B >/dev/null
```

```
{ A && B; } >/dev/null
```
But are **not** equivalent to

```
A && B >/dev/null
```

I am looking at the spkg right now. It compiles fine and the patch look good. I have only one minor request about SPKG.txt before setting this to positive review.
From the current SPKG.txt:

```
=== Patches ===

 * cPickle.c.patch, pickle.py.patch: These add support for pickling
   classes with a metaclass via copy_reg. These have been submitted
   upstream: http://bugs.python.org/issue7689
 * locale.py: Work around import failures for locales
 * readline-spacebug.patch: Fix issue where a space is inserted
   after tab completing at the command line. This is merged upstream
   and can be removed as soon as a Python newer than 2.6.4 is used.
 * readline-Itanium-fix.patch: Fix Itanium specific readline
   extension problem.
 * sdist.py.patch: Make sure that sdist copies over the .hg directory.
 * socket.py.patch: Work around an SSL issue.
 * Makefile.pre.in.patch:  Fixes http://bugs.python.org/issue1628484
   This was merged upstream for Python 2.6.6 and 2.7.
 * socketmodule.c Makes sure some things are defined before trying to compile
   them. This was to work around a failure of _socket to build on OpenSolaris.
   see  http://bugs.python.org/issue8852 and Sage trac #9041 and #9022
 * setup.py.multiarch.patch: Library search dir is expanded on Debian
   and derivatives with multiarch (see #11243, #11447).
   This requires 'dpkg-architecture' to be installed on the affected systems.
   (Since the patch origins from Python 2.7, it can certainly be removed
   when we upgrade to that. But the patch then won't apply anymore anyway.)
```
The section about Makefile.pre.in should mention your bit about installing things 0755.
