The python spkg should not use parallel "make install".  This is claimed to be fixed in the spkg, but it actually isn't done properly.  There are some comments in `spkg-install` about how to fix it.

Also, the python library should be installed with writable permission 0755, instead of 0555.

Yeah, sorry for that...

To make the redirection work properly.  The following are equivalent:

```
A >/dev/null && B >/dev/null
```

```
{ A && B; } >/dev/null
```
But are **not** equivalent to

```
A && B >/dev/null
```

I am looking at the spkg right now. It compiles fine and the patch look good. I have only one minor request about SPKG.txt before setting this to positive review.
From the current SPKG.txt:

```
### Patches

 * cPickle.c.patch, pickle.py.patch: These add support for pickling
   classes with a metaclass via copy_reg. These have been submitted
   upstream: http://bugs.python.org/issue7689
 * locale.py: Work around import failures for locales
 * readline-spacebug.patch: Fix issue where a space is inserted
   after tab completing at the command line. This is merged upstream
   and can be removed as soon as a Python newer than 2.6.4 is used.
 * readline-Itanium-fix.patch: Fix Itanium specific readline
   extension problem.
 * sdist.py.patch: Make sure that sdist copies over the .hg directory.
 * socket.py.patch: Work around an SSL issue.
 * Makefile.pre.in.patch:  Fixes http://bugs.python.org/issue1628484
   This was merged upstream for Python 2.6.6 and 2.7.
 * socketmodule.c Makes sure some things are defined before trying to compile
   them. This was to work around a failure of _socket to build on OpenSolaris.
   see  http://bugs.python.org/issue8852 and Sage trac #9041 and #9022
 * setup.py.multiarch.patch: Library search dir is expanded on Debian
   and derivatives with multiarch (see #11243, #11447).
   This requires 'dpkg-architecture' to be installed on the affected systems.
   (Since the patch origins from Python 2.7, it can certainly be removed
   when we upgrade to that. But the patch then won't apply anymore anyway.)
```
The section about Makefile.pre.in should mention your bit about installing things 0755.
