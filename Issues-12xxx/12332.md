the documentation on MixedIntegerLinearProgram().new_variable does not mention that by default the corresponding variables are assumed to be nonnegative.

The only place this is mentioned is [LP Thematic Tutorial](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html).  It says:
"By default, all the LP variables are assumed to be non-negative reals. They can be defined as binary through the parameter binary=True (or integer with integer=True). Lower and upper bounds can be defined or re-defined (for instance when you want some variables to be negative) using the methods set_min and set_max."

This must appear in regular docs, too.

it's still quite inconsistent, the use of `self` and ```MixedIntegerLinearProgram``` in docstrings.
There does not seem any logic behind these different uses, at least not to me.

Shouldn't we consistently write `self` there?

Actually, I think we should *not* write {{self}} at all. It should be explicitly written what function or class it is.

well, if so, then we should make the docstings consistent in the whole file...
