There are special formulas to apply for quotients of gamma values, since those quotients can be pretty reasonable even though the numerator and denominator are too big, for example:

```
sage: binomial(float(1000),float(1001))
nan
sage: binomial(1000,1001)
0
```
and:

```
sage: binomial(float(1001),float(1000))
nan
sage: binomial(1001,1000)
1001
```

So, it seems to be some overflow problems in arm? Should we just change the example

```
a = binomial(RR(1140000.78), 42000000)
```
to the one below which works on arm? After all, what this is testing is that the binomial is fast, which is well tested even with something that is half the size of the previous one

```
a = binomial(RR(1140000.78), 23310031)
