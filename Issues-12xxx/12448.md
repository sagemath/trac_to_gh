There are special formulas to apply for quotients of gamma values, since those quotients can be pretty reasonable even though the numerator and denominator are too big, for example:

```
sage: binomial(float(1000),float(1001))
nan
sage: binomial(1000,1001)
0
```
and:

```
sage: binomial(float(1001),float(1000))
nan
sage: binomial(1001,1000)
1001
```

There are several things to say about the matter:
1. for m an integer, indeed the formula you give is correct.
2. but it's possible to define the binomial with m non-integer using gamma-functions, and I think that's what the one who coded the current floating code had in mind.
3. my patch is about partially unwinding the gamma factors like you mention (with step by step simplification which avoids overflows) before finally calling the gamma function with small parameters.
4. but my patch should only start looping when the parameters are indeed big (or it will be slow) and use symmetry so binomial(float(1001),float(1)) works.

Patching and compiling are ok on amd64 and armv7l.

On amd64, doctesting is ok, but on arm, the line 3143:
  a = binomial(RR(1140000.78), 42000000)
makes the line 3213 (added by the patch):

It's the .binomial part which raises an error : binomial(RR(1140000.78), 23310031) works, but binomial(RR(1140000.78), 23310032) raises the error (dichotomy).

So, it seems to be some overflow problems in arm? Should we just change the example

```
a = binomial(RR(1140000.78), 42000000)
```
to the one below which works on arm? After all, what this is testing is that the binomial is fast, which is well tested even with something that is half the size of the previous one

```
a = binomial(RR(1140000.78), 23310031)
```

Or, does this point to some problem in pari?
