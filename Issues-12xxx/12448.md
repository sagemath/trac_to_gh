There are special formulas to apply for quotients of gamma values, since those quotients can be pretty reasonable even though the numerator and denominator are too big, for example:

```
sage: binomial(float(1000),float(1001))
nan
sage: binomial(1000,1001)
0
```
and:

```
sage: binomial(float(1001),float(1000))
nan
sage: binomial(1001,1000)
1001
```

Patching and compiling are ok on amd64 and armv7l.

On amd64, doctesting is ok, but on arm, the line 3143:
  a = binomial(RR(1140000.78), 42000000)
makes the line 3213 (added by the patch):
  return P(pari(x).binomial(m))
raise an error "ParriError: (15)".

It's the .binomial part which raises an error : binomial(RR(1140000.78), 23310031) works, but binomial(RR(1140000.78), 23310032) raises the error (dichotomy).

> It's the .binomial part which raises an error : binomial(RR(1140000.78), 23310031) works, but binomial(RR(1140000.78), 23310032) raises the error (dichotomy).

So, it seems to be some overflow problems in arm? Should we just change the example

```
a = binomial(RR(1140000.78), 42000000)
```
to the one below which works on arm? After all, what this is testing is that the binomial is fast, which is well tested even with something that is half the size of the previous one

```
a = binomial(RR(1140000.78), 23310031)
```

Or, does this point to some problem in pari?
