In the `FiniteField` constructor, it is first checked whether the order is a prime power, and then whether it is prime.  If the order is prime, this means that the primality of the order will be checked twice.

For some reason the patch keep failing to apply, I've upgraded sage to 7.4.2 to be sure, but it still doesn't apply. I get

```

```
I'm assuming I'm doing something wrong or something, so someone else can take the reviewing over while I try to sort out the problem on my machine.
