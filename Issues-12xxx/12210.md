In the `FiniteField` constructor, it is first checked whether the order is a prime power, and then whether it is prime.  If the order is prime, this means that the primality of the order will be checked twice.

Depends on #11784

For some reason the patch keep failing to apply, I've upgraded sage to 7.4.2 to be sure, but it still doesn't apply. I get

```
applying /storage/florian/12210_GF_p_is_prime.patch
patching file sage/rings/finite_rings/constructor.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 288
Hunk #2 FAILED at 345
Hunk #3 FAILED at 381
3 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/finite_rings/constructor.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply

```
I'm assuming I'm doing something wrong or something, so someone else can take the reviewing over while I try to sort out the problem on my machine.
