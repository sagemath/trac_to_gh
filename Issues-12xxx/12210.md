In the `FiniteField` constructor, it is first checked whether the order is a prime power, and then whether it is prime.  If the order is prime, this means that the primality of the order will be checked twice.

For some reason the patch keep failing to apply, I've upgraded sage to 7.4.2 to be sure, but it still doesn't apply. I get

```
applying /storage/florian/12210_GF_p_is_prime.patch
patching file sage/rings/finite_rings/constructor.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 288
Hunk #2 FAILED at 345
Hunk #3 FAILED at 381
3 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/finite_rings/constructor.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply

```
I'm assuming I'm doing something wrong or something, so someone else can take the reviewing over while I try to sort out the problem on my machine.
