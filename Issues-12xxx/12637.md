On Solaris, running `rm -rf DIR` fails if `DIR` is in the path of the current working directory. This happens in sage-spkg, so the temporary build directories `$SAGE_BUILD_DIR/$PKG_NAME` don't get deleted.  Fix this by running `cd ...` first.

Could you just add a comment like

```
# On Solaris, the current working directory cannot be deleted,
# so we "cd" out of $SAGE_BUILD_DIR/$PKG_NAME, see #12637.
