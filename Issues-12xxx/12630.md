This will add classes dealing with quivers, quiver algebras, representations of quivers, elements of these representations, homomorphisms between these representations, and spaces of homomorphisms between these representations.

There's a lot here that is really easily computable.  We can compute socles, quotients, radicals, duals, and more for any finite dimensional representation.  We can compute projective covers of modules so Auslander-Rieten translations have been implemented and there's certainly potential for future enhancements dealing with homology and cohomology.  There's only so much I can say here but everything is fully documented and should be self explanatory.

Two shortcomings are that quivers need to be acyclic (to keep things finite dimensional) and this code does not handle quivers with relations.  As far as quivers with relations go there are comments in the code detailing what should be done to implement that.  It's well within the reach of Sage, I just don't have the time to do it at the moment.

__About the commits__

The second commit is supposed to split the code into chewable bits (so that maintenance and cythonization will become easier), introduces a parent structure for the paths of a quiver (namely: a free small category), makes paths inherit from Element (but *not* from `UniqueRepresentation`!) and fixes some tests. The third commit uses Sage's infrastructure for morphisms and homsets of representations, and it reduces the pollution of the global namespace.

We are currently slowly getting a large project into sage dealing with (the combinatorics of) cluster algebras and quivers, see #10298. In particular, we also have a class quiver (#10538). I think both classes should be merged as they both deal with acyclic quivers. To be more precice, we deal with skew-symmetrizable matrices and the corresponding labeled quivers, while you seem to focus on the simply-laced version.

I can definitely to the review for this patch, and I propose to sit down (virtually together) and merge both concepts. This means make one being dependent of the other.

I also want to remark that Franco Saliola has as well quite some code on quiver representations that we might want to merge (if it is not subsumed). We also have currently a project of implementing the knitting algorithm for quivers without cycles which is currently based on Franco's implementation.

<a id='comment:11'></a>I added comparisons to the QuiverPath class and CombinatorialFreeModuleElement should use should now use those comparisons to determine the order that monomials are printed in.  I think previously the order was based on the id of the elements which explains why the patchbot could be getting different output then I was.

Because I thought that the failing doctest was of the kind "display a set or dict that is returned by some method". In that case, the only problem would be a non-unique string representation.

But now I was looking at the actual error the patchbot complained about, and I see that the error went beyond that. If I understand correctly, you have a set, and transform it into a tuple in order to use it in a cache key, and then you display the cache key in one test, right?

Then you are right that the innards ought to be changed, because if you used non-ordered tuples for a cache key then the cache was broken.

Note that there is an immutable version of sets, called "frozenset". It can be used in cache keys! It is faster to compare two frozensets than to have two tuples, one of them sorted, sort the second tuple, and compare then:

```
sage: S = frozenset(randint(1,10000) for _ in range(1000))
sage: T = deepcopy(S)
sage: %timeit S==T
625 loops, best of 3: 33.8 µs per loop
sage: S2 = tuple(S)
sage: T2 = sorted(tuple(S))
sage: T2==S2
False
sage: sorted(S2)==T2
True
sage: %timeit sorted(S2)==T2
625 loops, best of 3: 312 µs per loop
```

Hence, if the cache access is time critical, then you could consider to use frozenset (which would mean to be careful in the doctest, because again the doctest would test against the non-unique string representation of the cache key). But if time is no problem, then using *sorted* tuples in the cache keys is fine.

<a id='comment:21'></a>Hello everyone,

I just want to point out that development of this patch is continuing on the sage-combinat queue. I put this patch up on the queue as well as the recent code that Jim wrote to interface with QPA. The patches are named (subject to change, of course):

- 12630_quivers.patch
- qpa_interface-fs.patch
- 12630_quivers_review-fs.patch

Some work is needed to merge these two patches; the idea being that one should delegate anything that Sage can't do to QPA. So some re-organization and categorification of the code is necessary. I started this with my review patch.

JStarx has done an incredible amount of great work with these two patches and we really should get these into Sage. Thank you, JStarx!

Thank you for updating this patch.  I had a quick question.  Was the main change a rebase so that this applies on Sage 5.6 or were there other changes that we should be aware of?


Also, I should mention that as of Sage 5.6, ticket #10538 has been merged in that handles the ClusterQuiver class.  This class is "Quivers" for those users interested in cluster algebra methods.  We decided to change this from the previous "Quiver" because of the name conflict with this patch.

In the future, it probably would make sense to have methods allowing the user to go from a ClusterQuiver to a Quiver or vice-versa.

P.S. By the way, I will be at Sage Days at ICERM next week, and in case any developers would like to discuss this further there, I'd be more than happy.

It consists of replacing a test "if not(xx)" by a test "if xx=None or xx=False"

This test was checking the existence of a coercion.

This was failing because of #9016: "make morphisms hashable", which was introduced in 5.6.beta1

<a id='comment:31'></a>In the past few weeks (or even months) I have been a bit too busy with other things. So, I'm sorry for my silence.

Let me try to summarise what your code does (correct me if I am wrong) and ask my questions on it, followed by a summary of what I soon need for my project. Then I suggest a code structure that might be useful (but is perhaps biased, as it is influenced from my project). Hopefully we can then make a plan how to avoid duplication of work.

__What the code provides__

* a `QuiverFactory`, that returns immutable quivers (a new sub-class of `DiGraph`) and uses caching. The factory refuses to create quivers with loops.
* algebras of acyclic quivers (thus, finite dimensional) and their elements; no quotient algebras.
* representation of acyclic quivers.
* a class `QuiverPath`, that is a `UniqueRepresentation` and defines multiplication and stuff, but does not implement the elements of anything.
* various classes that together implement representation of quivers, homsets etc.

The code is entirely in Python, so, does likely not address speed. Having quotients of acyclic quiver algebras is considered phase 2, having quotients of general quivers is considered phase 3. It is stated that most of the quiver code would work with cycles, only the algebras would need significant changes.

__Questions on your code__

* You state that most of the code would work with cyclic quivers. So, why do you require acyclicity *everywhere*? Why don't you just provide a (cached) method `is_acyclic` that is called when you really need acylicity, raising an error if there are cycles?
* What is the rôle of `QuiverPath`? It is not inheriting from any algebraic base class, and is not even the element of anything. I'd rather expect that a `QuiverPath` is element of a `Quiver`.
* Why do you use `UniqueRepresentation` on `QuiverPath`? Assume that you have two quivers, and assume they are labelled in such a way that both quivers contain a path that starts at vertex 1 and ends at vertex 2 with edge sequence a, b, c, d. Would you really say that these two paths, that belong to totally different quivers, are *identical*?

__What I need **soon**__

I try to provide an efficient implementation of my non-commutative version of the F5 algorithm for modules over basic algebras (hence, modules over finite dimensional quotients of quiver algebras). The background is that the F5 algorithm (in contrast to other Gröbner basis algorithms) would also allow to compute a minimal generating set for the module (actually: Loewy layers of the module), provided that a negative degree monomial ordering is used. The quivers I'm working with will typically contain cycles.

Hence, I need
* Quivers. Would be good to have a unique representation and immutability. *Must* allow cycles.
* The algebraic structure formed by the paths in a quiver, subject to concatenation of paths. How to call it? Florent suggests "monoidoid", I suggest "multimonoid". In any case, it is an associative magma. It might be possible to identify the quiver with this algebraic structure; hence, a quiver would not just be a digraph, but would also inherit from some algebraic base class and would belong to the category of associative magmas. Of course I want elements of this algebraic structure.
* I need to be able to choose a monomial ordering on the paths (i.e., compatible with concatenation of paths). It *must* be possible to choose an ordering that first compares paths by *negative* length.
* Quiver algebras, i.e., the algebra generated by the afore-mentioned associative magma that is given by the paths in a quiver, with a monomial ordering inherited from the ordering of paths. I guess that some generic (and already existing!) code would just work.
* Finite dimensional quotients of quiver algebras, and their elements.
* Modules over finite dimensional quotients of quiver algebras. Note that modules over non-commutative rings are currently not implemented.

__My speed requirements__

The following operations should be super fast:

In the quiver (considered as an associative magma)
* concatenation of paths
* comparison of paths
* hashing of paths
* test whether a given path w starts with a given path v

Speed in the quiver algebra is not essential (hence, I could really live with slow generic code here). However, multiplication in the finite dimensional path algebra quotients should be very fast.

__Suggested code structure__

* Quivers are not just finite digraphs, but they should IMHO be identified with the associative magma given by path concatenation. Hence, the base class `Quiver_generic` should use a unique factory and inherit from `DiGraph` (this is what you do) *and* should inherit from Parent, being initialised in the category `AssociativeMagmas()` (create this category, if it does not exist already).
* `QuiverPath` should use some algebraic base class and should be used to construct the element class of a quiver.
* `QuiverPath` should be cythoned. I have some experimental code, that unfortunately is spread over different machines. Approaches that I tested:
  - Encode a path as an integer (if the quiver has n arrows then you read the integer as an n-adic number, and the sequence of digits yields the sequence of arrows in the path
  - Encode a path as `*unsigned char`. Hence, you have a list of at most 255 arrows of your quiver, and a sequence of bytes corresponds to a sequence of arrows.
  - Same as the previous, but use a dense representation: If you have less arrows, then squeeze several arrows into one byte. By consequence, you need less memory.
  - Number the arrows *locally*. Hence, if you are at a certain vertex, then your numbering takes into account only the outgoing arrows that start at this vertex. Hence, if you use `*unsigned char`, then you can work with quivers that may have much more than 255 arrows, as long as each vertex has not more than 255 outgoing arrows.
  - Same as the previous, but use a dense representation.

  It seems to be that the last approach was best for my applications, but I really need to test again, as the code rotted for a couple of months.
* We could use (existing?) general code for obtaining the quiver algebra of a general quiver, and use your code if the quiver happens to be acyclic.
* I have experimental code (rotting since months) for finite dimensional quotients of quiver algebras. Multiplication in the quotient is implemented by matrix multiplication, and a vector space basis of the algebra quotient is given by those paths that are not leading monomial of a quotient relation.

__Plans to combine work__

It seems that our projects intersect only in one point: We use quivers. You would proceed with representations of acyclic quivers (which is not in my focus), while I would proceed with finite dimensional quotients of quiver algebras (which is not in your focus).

But we could combine forces in the implementation of quivers. Do you think it would work for you that your `QuiverFactory` is modified such that it also allows to create quivers with cycles? Would it work for you that `Quiver_generic` inherits from both `DiGraph` and `Parent` and is initialised as an associative magma, using `QuiverPath` as element class? Would it work for you that `QuiverPath` is cythoned, using whatever dense representation as described above, with comparison by negative length? I think your code concerning representations for the special case of acyclic quivers would still work.

In any case, I should try to reconstruct my experimental code...

<a id='comment:32'></a>From the documentation of the patch:

```
 	9	A Quiver is a directed graph used for representation theory.  In Sage a Quiver 
 	10	is different from a directed graph in the following ways: 
 	11	 
 	12	- The vertices of a DiGraph are arbitrary sage objects, but the vertices of a 
 	13	  Quiver must be labeled by integers. 
 	14	 
 	15	- DiGraphs can have cycles (paths that start and end at the same vertex) and 
 	16	  even loops (edges whose initial and terminal vertices are equal).  In this 
 	17	  implementation a Quiver must be acyclic (and can not have loops). 
 	18	 
 	19	- The edges of a DiGraph are labeled with arbitrary sage objects or None if no 
 	20	  label is specified.  Each edge of a Quiver must be labeled with a nonempty 
 	21	  string.  The label cannot begin with 'e_' or contain '*' and distinct edges 
 	22	  must have distinct labels. 
 	23	 
 	24	- DiGraphs do not have a unique representation in Sage; Quivers do. 
```
All these properties could easily be enforced by using a `UniqueFactory` that returns plain immutable digraphs. Given the above specification, I really don't see the need to create `Quiver_generic` as a sub-class of `DiGraph`.

<a id='comment:33'></a>I am both puzzled and impressed: Aren't modules in Sage currently only defined over commutative algebras? But then, why does it work to let `QuiverRep_generic` inherit from sage.modules.module.Module?

Concerning the location of the class definitions, I think that one should not squeeze all code into sage.modules.quiver_module: This file should only contain `QuiverRep_generic` and related definitions, but not `Quiver_generic`, `QuiverPath` or `QuiverAlgebra`:

- If one thinks that a quiver is a graph, then it should be defined somewhere in sage.graphs. If one thinks that a quiver is an associative magma that also happens to be a graph (I'd prefer this point of view!), then one might create a new section sage.magmas for it, or simply put it into sage.monoids.
- A quiver algebra is an algebra. Hence, it should be put into sage.algebras.
- If one thinks of `QuiverPath` as an element of a quiver-the-associative-magma, then it should be put into the same section (sage.magmas or sage.monoids) and used as element_class of quiver-the-associative-magma; but even in this case, `QuiverPath` and quiver-the-associative-magma should be defined in different files, so that it will later be easier to change `QuiverPath` into optimized Cython code.

IMHO, the code will be much easier to maintain when it was divided into smaller parts distributed into appropriate sections of Sage.

It is nice that calling certain methods of `DiGraph` results in an attribute error. But it would be even nicer if one would obtain the attribute error *before* calling the method. This is how it could be achieved:

```

<a id='comment:50'></a>Here are the current failures:

```

sage -t sage/quivers/representation.py  # 450 doctests failed
sage -t sage/quivers/homspace.py  # 127 doctests failed

sage -t sage/quivers/algebra.py  # 78 doctests failed
sage -t sage/quivers/morphism.py  # 290 doctests failed
```

Scary. But I guess most of them are due to change of syntax. In the original code, one was able to create a paths without reference to a quiver, and then multiply them. In the new code, one needs to have a quiver, get the associated free small category, and construct elements of it. I think this is cleaner. And after all, in real applications, we *have* a quiver.

In this case, one wants the "contracted" semigroup algebra (where the 0 of the algebra is identified with the zero of the semigroup).

How to organise work?

I'd suggest that I continue working on the second patch, until stuff works with the current implementation of path algebras. And in a third patch, one could then (try to) do everything with contracted semigroup algebras.

Other suggestion?

Here are some last corrections from the previous patch. The import statements are a bit cleaner (?) and I fixed some doctest errors. Because it is a little patch, I've merged it with the previous one.

```
sage -t quiver.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

This last one seems to be only a _repr_ problem. The object which is returned looks correct.

<a id='comment:80'></a>It may be that the last remaining doctest is just a problem with _repr_. However, the returned representation really looks fishy, it looks like the quiver involved is broken. So, let's investigate what is happening.

Note that I think the following test should be rewritten anyway.

The simple reason is that the user would first need to learn where to import it from. But `hom` is a method that the user has very likely seen before in Sage.

```
    sage: Q2 = Quiver({1:{2:['a', 'b']}})
    sage: M2 = QuiverRep(QQ, Q2, {1: QQ^2, 2: QQ^1}, {(1, 2, 'a'): [1, 0], (1, 2, 'b'): [0, 1]})
    sage: P2 = Q2.P(QQ, 1)
    sage: from sage.quivers.morphism import QuiverRepHom
    sage: f = QuiverRepHom(P2, M2, {1:[1, 1], 2:[[1], [1]]})
    sage: f.linear_dual()
Expect:
    Homomorphism of representations of Quiver on 2 vertices
Got:
    Homomorphism of representations of Quiver on Reverse of ()
```

The underlying problem seems to be this:

```
sage: Q2.reverse()
Quiver on Reverse of ()
```

So, let's have a look at the `reverse()` method.

            name = ''

Our digraph has no given name, and thus its reverse gets the name `Reverse of ()`.

So, it is not convenient, but I think we should not worry about it.

OK. This makes sense.

In order to not duplicate work, I propose that I "refactor the factory" now and directly incorporate the change (`boundary=()`) and the fix for the only failing test.

The default should work, provided that coercion has properly been implemented. There is a `_coerce_map_from_` method, that seems to do the right thing.\n\n- `_Hom_` should not raise an error, when the codomain is not a quiver representation. Instead, it should return some `sage.categories.homset.Homset` (or `HomsetWithBase`, because we have a base?)\n\n- `sage.modules.module.Module` has a `base_ring` method, and I see no need to overload it.\n\n- For implementing `an_element`, the method `_an_element_` should be implemented.\n\n- For a quiver representation `R`, `R.an_element()`, `R.zero()` and `R.gens()` do not return instances of `R.element_class`.

<a id='comment:89'></a>Some random remarks on `QuiverRep_generic`:

- My personal preference is to use `UniqueRepresentation`, not `UniqueFactory`, but personal preferences may be negotiable. I worry about pickling, since in fact there is no `loads(dumps(...))==...` test in the sources, and no `TestSuite(...).run()`.

- I don't see why there is a need to provide a `__contains__` method. The default should work, provided that coercion has properly been implemented. There is a `_coerce_map_from_` method, that seems to do the right thing.

- `_Hom_` should not raise an error, when the codomain is not a quiver representation. Instead, it should return some `sage.categories.homset.Homset` (or `HomsetWithBase`, because we have a base?)

- `sage.modules.module.Module` has a `base_ring` method, and I see no need to overload it.

- For implementing `an_element`, the method `_an_element_` should be implemented.

- For a quiver representation `R`, `R.an_element()`, `R.zero()` and `R.gens()` do not return instances of `R.element_class`. So, `TestSuite(R)` will complain.

- It seems that `hom()` and `Hom()` are not needed, since the default implementation would work (since there is `_Hom_` implemented).

<a id='comment:95'></a>I have provided a new patch. To make reviewing easier, I kept it separate. Once the review is done, we can think of folding it, to make it easier for the release manager.

__What the new patch does__

* To avoid pollution of the global namespace, *only* Quiver is imported at startup. There is really no need to import `QuiverRep` or `QuiverRepHom`. Instead, the user is supposed to first create a quiver Q, and then use `R = Q.representation(...)` or `R.hom(...)` to create representations and their morphisms. By consequence, there were many trivial fixes for the doctests needed.

* In order to make `R.hom(S)` work with Sage's default infrastructure, it is needed to implement a method `natural_map()` for the homset `R.Hom(S)`. And this homset should be returned by a method `R._Hom_(S)`. Caching is actually not needed, because this is done in `sage.categories.homset.Hom`. Hence, **TODO:** Remove the `UniqueFactory`!!

* There is a default `sage.structure.parent.Parent.hom`, and there is no need to overload it. In particular, the hom() method provided by the old patch expected its arguments in the wrong order. The default is: *First* the data defining the morphism, *second* the codomain.

* an_element() should be implemented by providing _an_element_().

* There is a default `__contains__` method for parents, and there is usually no need to overload it (instead, one should implement coercions). Hence, I removed some of them. There is still `__contains__` for `FreeSmallCategory`, because it needs to extend what `DiGraph.__contains__` is doing. **TODO:** Check whether homspaces could do without the custom `__contains__`!

* Speaking of default infrastructure: Elements should be created by either doing arithmetic on the generators of a parent, or by calling the parent with appropriate data, but not by passing these data to the *underlying class* of the elements (which does not coincide with the element class in many cases). **TODO:** Try to make `TestSuite()` work.

* Speedup: I have already mentioned above that `list(self._vector[startdim:startdim + rows*cols])` is a lot slower than `self._vector.list()[startdim:startdim + rows*cols]`.

* There is a default `zero` method, that caches the zero of a parent. So, there should be no need to overload it. However, some methods start with `self.zero()` and then change it in-place. That's of course not allowed with a cached element, and hence I had to replace `self.zero()` with a non-cached `self()`.

I think, in spite of the above TODOs, I put it as "needs review" for now, and wait for your comments. For the record, I give positive review to those parts of the code that I did not change (hence, to most of the code inside of methods, as I was mainly changing the structure of the code base and the semantics of few methods that are important for Sage's infrastructure).

The update of the third patch implements this short term solution.

Still TODO:

- I found that still some tests start with importing Quiver. This is not needed. Quiver, in contrast to everything else of the new stuff, is in the global namespace.
- Get rid of the unique factory
- Now, as element_class is available for the Homspaces, use it! Hence, do not create `QuiverRepHom`, but always create homomorphisms by means of the element_class.

Changes with respect to last time:
- The invalid path now evaluates as zero in the path algebra. This was the last obstruction for `TestSuite`, and now there is a `TestSuite` test for all parents (free small category, algebra, representation, homspace) involved in this patch. This was done by overloading the `_monomial()` method of an algebra.
- I added a `cardinality()` method for free small categories, such that the dimension of a path algebra A becomes available.

Well, I guess by keeping the patches separate, I intended to make reviewing easier. In fact, the code introduced by the first patch is totally reworked and put into different files by the second patch.

Anyway, the resulting code is mainly the contents of sage/quivers/, which is

```
ls sage/quivers/
algebra.py  all.py  free_small_category.py  homspace.py  __init__.py  morphism.py  paths.pxd  paths.pyx  quiver.py  representation.py
```
If I am not mistaken, changes in other locations are relatively small, namely:
- insert `Quiver` (and *only* `Quiver`, but not all the other stuff such as `FreeSmallCategory` or `QuiverRep`) into the global namespace
- make the modules in sage.quivers part of the documentation.

Best regards,
Simon

If they are, shouldn't one set the attribute `._immutable` to the graph, so that the hash won't complain about mutability?\n\n\nNo, they are not. Only the backend is immutable, the graph itself isn't.

Let me rephrase my question: Probably, if one really wants to play dirty, one could change edge labels. But is it possible to change edge labels by using "official" (non-underscore) methods of the graph? If it is impossible, then I'd say the graph is immutable.

And concerning edge labels: Yes, I need them for the constructions of quiver
algebras and so on.

So, if it is possible to change the edge labels of a "static_sparse" digraph
by using non-underscore method, then I'd say we *can't* work with digraph
(and need a sub-class or something else).

> Embedding, layout, name, allowing or not multiple edges/loops.


This won't matter for me. Actually, if you compare digraphs ("=="), would the
embedding, layout, name and so on be taken into account?

Let me rephrase my needs: For me, it is important that one can't (by
non-underscore methods) change the ==-equivalence class of the graph. If this
is the case, then it is immutable.

> My problem with the patch at #14535, is that decorators on methods that are
> heavily used could impact ALL graphs


The stuff here is not related with #14535 (which is probably just a bad idea).

> I don't really know what these methods do, to be honest.. Do they apply to
> all digraphs, for a start ?


AFAIK, there is no mathematical difference between a quiver and a digraph. And
of course, for any digraph, you can construct the algebra whose monoids
correspond to directed paths, which are multiplied by concatenation (yielding
zero if the end/startpoints don't match): The quiver algebra.

So, yes, the mathematical notions here make sense for all digraphs.

But, as you know, I like `UniqueRepresentation`. And since the digraph together with a
base ring is enough to determine the quiver algebra, I would like to use the
digraph as a cache key.

Hence, from the implementation point of view, "quiver algebra" and friends
will only make sense for all *immutable* digraphs.

> And do you think that you would ever want the digraphs you use to have anything to do with the parent/element stuff and facades ? 


No. For me, the digraphs are just labels for some algebra.

Note that with the patches from here, `Quiver` is not a parent. The only
parents occuring here are `FreeSmallCategory`, `QuiverRepresentation` and
`QuiverAlgebra`---none of them are digraphs.

> Most importantly, do you really think that you want to inherit from DiGraph? You can use the backends without inheriting from DiGraph objects, and in particular you wouldn't have 10000 unrelated methods in your objects.


Well, a quiver *is* the same as a digraph. So, I believe it totally makes
sense to have 10000 unrelated methods.

And yes, I also believe that digraph should
have even more methods, namely in addition: A method returning the quiver algebra
over a given ring and some methods being able to construct representations of the
quiver.

The only reason for introducing a subclass `Quiver` of `DiGraph` was the
concern about mutability.

> And you could have a method from quivers to graph if you ever want to do things like computing a hamiltonian circuit in your quivers ? `:-P`


Sure. But there is no mathematical reason to create a new python class for
quivers. The only reason to do so was in the code.

__Conclusive question__

Do we have digraphs with the property that it is impossible to change the ==-equivalence class by using non-underscore methods? If we have, then I'd suggest to add a few more methods to them. And don't worry, I won't turn digraphs into parents or facades... :)

Good question. I hope not. I don't have Sage right now (it's compiling), but if 
g = graphs.PetersenGraph(); g == Graph(g.edges())
says True, then we are sage and these are not taken into account.

Though it would make sense to prevent anybody from changing the embedding/layout in an immutable graph anyway. Let's pretend, at the very least `:-P`

You can definitely do that if the graph has mutable edge labels.

Yeaaah, but then you aren't using methods "officially" supported by the graph. If you like, you can even mutate an integer: I recall a worksheet in which William demonstrated mutating an Integer.

Did you just say that you made the static backend support multiple edges just for me? (blush) Thank you!

> And most of this patch headaches, as usual, come from multiple edges, loops and labels. I personally hate them with all my heart `:-P`


OK, but they naturally occur in algebra. Algebra causes headaches, too ;-)

For example, if you have a finite group whose order is a power of a prime p, then the group algebra over GF(p) can be described as a quotient of a quiver algebra *with a single vertex*. So, all edges are loops.

I totally agree.

Good news for me:

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph(); g == Graph(g.edges())
True
```

That's what I want. Namely, the generator names of the quiver algebra are
obtained from the edge and vertex labels. And if they change, then the algebra
should change as well. Hence, the labels *should* be checked in "==".

That's not what I meant. You can of course obtain the edge label by
non-underscore methods, but in order to *mutate* the returned label, you need to do more.

Hmmmm. I'd think one shouldn't say that an immutable graph "allows"
loops/multiple edges. Either it *has* loops or it has not---if it has not,
it will certainly not allow to create a loop, since it is immutable.

Then why would you call them digraphs? `:-P`

Seriously, I guess there are just two mathematical communities. Graph
theorists would call them digraph, I guess, but algebraist would call them quivers.

I'd need to look at the code. At least there would be

- `.free_small_category()`: This is the set of directed paths with
  multiplication by concatenation. I was told on sage-combinat-devel that I
  shouldn't call it "path magma" but "free small category".
- `.quiver_algebra(R)` (or just `.algebra(R)`?): Return the monomial algebra
  over R whose monomials are given by the free small category
- `.quiver_representation(...)`: Create a module over the quiver algebra.
- Currently there are some short-cuts for creating a quiver
  representation. For example, the vertices of the quiver/digraph are in
  one-to-one correspondence to the simple modules of the quiver algebra. And
  the projective covers of the simple modules are important as well.

If I recall correctly, we have 3 shortcuts, so, this would result in 6
additional methods.

Disadvantage of moving stuff to Digraph: It would again give rise to
refactoring the code. I guess this is not other people's problem ... `:-/`

Right, you could always say that you have a class `FreeSmallCategory`
inheriting from `UniqueRepresentation`, and then `G.free_small_category()`
should return `FreeSmallCategory(G)` if G is immutable,
but `FreeSmallCategory(immutable_copy(G))` otherwise.

Because currently I am algebraist. I used to be a low-dimensional topologist,
and I think these guys did not come to a conclusion whether it is digraph or
quiver (I heard naming them both ways when I was young).

Makes sense. I would agree that having a method on the quiver/digraph is
actually a short-cut.

I admit that.

Multiple labelled loops on a vertices. Ahahah. I owe other headaches to that while coding #14953 `:-P`

I agree with you. However, the current implementation checks that these flags are equal in `__eq__`. So you will probably have to modify it a bit in case the graphs are static.

Dans it would produce weird things like :

sage: g == h
False
sage: Graph(g,immutable=True) == Graph(g,immutable=True)
True

Or perhaps we should just give up saying that two graphs are different just because of these flags... Would probably make more sense, actually.

I somehow agree. An argument against "path magma" was the fact that this particular magma is associative. And "associative path magma" sounds not good to me.

This would have been my choice, too. But sadly it is a monoid if and only if the quiver has precisely one vertex (which is certainly not always the case).

It could be that you have answered the following question already; in this case please give me a remainder: Is #14806 really enough to have immutable graphs, in the sense of "official methods such as `add_vertex` will not be able to change the ==- and cmp-classes of the graph"?

Note that I don't care about the possibility to have mutable labels and change these in-place. This is a misuse that is in the user's own responsibility.

If you answer this question affirmatively, then the question is what we shall do with the hash:

```
sage: g = graphs.CompleteGraph(400)                                 
sage: gi = Graph(g,data_structure="static_sparse")
sage: hash(gi)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: graphs are mutable, and thus not hashable
```
So, if you answer my question affirmatively, then apparently the flag `gi._immutable` should be set to `True` when using the immutable graph backend. Shall I open a new ticket for this?

And what is the preferred way of creating an immutable copy? Is it (as above) `Graph(g, data_structure="static_sparse")`? Or is there a faster way to create an immutable copy?

Best regards,
Simon

At this point I would go for either path_partial_monoid (if it
includes the empty path as identity) or path_partial_semigroup. It
will be easily found by someone interested by paths, and the "monoid"
or "semigroup" piece will highlight the associative multiplicative
structure and the presence, or not, of an identity.

I am even tempted by the shorter path_monoid or path_semigroup.
Granted, this is an abuse. But this abuse is pretty obvious to anyone
familiar with paths endowed with the concatenation product; also I
have often heard this abuse made by mathematicians. As for those that
don't know that are not familiar with path concatenation we can hope
that they will read the documentation where this will be written in
bold.

Just decide among those four the one that pleases you most!

I like path_algebra too, and it's consistent with the above. I'd say
it's fair at this point to change this name.

My feeling:

- Provide the feature as ....algebra.representation() now.
- Add .quiver_representation() later, as an alias, if there really is a
  popular request for it.

Ahem. As I needed pointers and advice myself I asked Nicolas, who should shortly give his advice on the namind problems.

He will answer that too.

Ahem. There is a "faster" way for the user, but all are equally shameful from the point of view of computer speed. Any input that the `Graph` constructor accepts can be used with `data_structure="static_sparse"` : a normal graph will first be built, THEN its backend will be replaced by a static one. So yeah, not very efficient. That's because the C-level method to create a static sparse graph only takes Graphs as an input.

If you think it should be made faster one trick would be to work directly on the internal dictionary into which Sage temporarily stores the input data before creating the non-static sparse graph backend.

Granted, it definitely came up during a discussion between the two of us :-)
Luckily we know more now, which made me change my mind in this
specific context.

On the other hand, I guess I will keep the name FreeSmallCategories
when we will get to create this category.

Why? AFAIK, a semigroup is the same as an associative magma (which we have
here). It is not needed to have an identity in a semigroup. Hence, it is no
abuse at all. And I think path semigroup is both short and descriptive, and relatively easy to guess.

I feel tempted to call it path semigroup.

Nobody has complained since you posted your comment (hence, 7 weeks ago). I'd
say that in this case we are entitled to change the terminology towards
something that we both find more common, namely "path algebra" rather than
"quiver algebra".

In other words: Nathann, Nicolas and I all agree that that it is the path
algebra that is represented, not the quiver.

It's an abuse because it's only a *partial* semigroup (with the
product of two non consecutive paths giving None).

Great, thanks!

<a id='comment:2'></a>This ticket currently adds a separate class Quiver, inheriting from `UniqueRepresentation` and from `DiGraph`, and the main reason was the fact that immutable graphs have been missing when Jim Stark provided the original implementation.

But now we have immutable graphs. So, now I would prefer to remove the new Quiver class, and instead add two methods to DiGraph, namely
- .semigroup(),that returns the (partial) semigroup formed by the paths-with-composition, and 
- .algebra(), that would be a short-cut for .semigroup().algebra()

I would not like to turn quivers into a `UniqueRepresentation`. I mean, what's the point? `DiGraphs` are no parents, and hence the "unique parent" mantra won't apply to them. Only the path semigroup and the path algebra should be `UniqueParent`, but not the underlying quiver.

This is a question mainly to Nathann: Could you live with two additional methods for `DiGraph`? I think the discussion on this ticket suggest the answer "yes", but to be on the safe side I'm asking again...

I would like to see the following workflow for constructing a quiver representation:
- Create a digraph (aka quiver) `Q`
- Create a path algebra `P = Q.algebra(k)` over a field `k`
- Create a representation of `P` via `P.representation(...)`.

This would avoid adding more stuff to the global namespace and is, I think, the natural way to construct a quiver representation.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hi Nathann, Simon,

Just random suggestions. Adding those methods to digraphs sounds
reasonable, with slightly more explict names like
`Q.path_semigroup()` and `Q.path_algebra()`. The latter could
possibly be `Q.path_semigroup().algebra(QQ)`.

For `Q.all_paths()`, it depends on the meaning. If it's about
listing the paths, we can just do `Q.path_semigroup().list()`.  If
it's about modelling the set of paths, but without the (partial)
semigroup structure given by concatenation, then `Q.paths()` seems
reasonable.

I believe that listing the paths (in the sense of: concatenation of arrows, with multiple different paths between the same vertices) should be the job of the path-semigroup: After all, these are the elements of the path-semigroup.

So, I would prefer to *not* add it as a new method of `DiGraph` (perhaps calling it `all_quiver_paths()`) and of course I would prefer to *not* override the `all_paths()` method of `DiGraph`, but I'd prefer to let it be a `PathSemigroup` method.

> Then again, just for user-friendliness reasons, you cannot reasonably ask a user to know what a semigroup is in order to enumerate the paths of a graph.



That's the point. It seems that there are two different notions of "paths of a graph". One notion is "sequence of vertices that are met along the path", another notion is "sequence of directed edges that are travelled along the path".

If I see that correctly, the current implementation of `all_paths()` for digraphs does the former, but the path-semigroup relies on the latter.

So, let me re-formulate my question to you. 
1. Do you want a new method called, say, `DiGraph.all_quiver_paths()` or `DiGraph.all_arrow_sequences()` that returns what the path semigroup needs?
2. Do you want me to replace the current `DiGraph.all_paths()` so that it returns what the path semigroup needs?
3. Do you want that the path semigroup computes its underlying data on its own, without introducing a new method of `DiGraph`?

I'd be surprised if you answer "yes" to 1., and shocked if you replied "yes" to 2. Thus, I suppose you prefer 3., but perhaps I am mistaken.

What about `DiGraph.all_paths(edges=True)` ?

You are a free man and if I complain a lot I don't own the graph code. I just care about it. This `all_paths` function has probably been created because somebody needed it, and if you just replace it with what you need instead we are going nowhere.

> 3. Do you want that the path semigroup computes its underlying data on its own, without introducing a new method of `DiGraph`?


Well, you are free to do whatever you want with the code of this semigroup. Right now the `all_paths` method returns a list of paths (be it with vertices or edges), and if you want to do anything fast with your semigroup you probably need to implement your own data structure to store it better. 

If it is a data structure which is efficient to store path independently of what you do with it semigroup structure, well, then it should probably be called `AllPaths` or something rather than semigroup. Then, your semi-group can use this data structure, by class inheritance or anything you like.

In the current code, it *is* stored in a (Python) list, and I totally agree
that this is bad. But I want to see this code move forward, and the code has
been refactored often enough.

So, I want a preliminary but slow version (that apparently is useful to
people, or otherwise Jim Stark had not provided the code) and then replace it
with something faster.

I have an implementation using two different kinds of storing it as `*long`,
in compressed form. In both implementations, concatenation, comparison and
sub-path test are fast enough for me...

But this will be on a new ticket, since otherwise I don't see a chance of

`O_o`

What can you do with the `*list*` of paths ? Even checking whether a path is in the list is probably faster by using the graph itself `O_o`

You misunderstood: I don't intend to keep a list containing paths. But currently, a path is implemented as a list of edges, and an edge is a triple "startpoint, endpoint, label". Instead, a path should be a `*long`, at least in my applications.

> Are you open to "bets" on the meaning of "later" ? `:-P`


A month, maybe two. It must not be much longer, since my grant is centred around an implementation of Faugère's F5 algorithm, generalised for path algebra quotients (punch line: in contrast to other famous Gröbner basis algorithms, F5 can compute minimal generating sets for modules).

So, I have a financial interest in having a decent implementation of path algebras soon. And in fact I have something, but it should be rebased on top of this ticket (currently, my own implementation is independent of this ticket, which means there is some code duplication).

`list(digraphs.Circuit(5).edge_iterator(1))` ?

Paths. Not Walks. Paths do not self-intersect.

<a id='comment:8'></a>With the new branch, all tests should pass.

The changes with respect to the previous state:

- I have removed the `Quiver` class. Rationale: Mathematically, a quiver is a multi-digraph. We need it to be immutable, but meanwhile Sage provides immutable digraphs. So, we can use `DiGraph` as entry point for the code: `DiGraph.path_semigroup()` returns the partial semigroup formed by the paths of the quiver, subject to concatenation.

Technically (with multiple vertices) it only is a partial semigroup, but there currently is no category of partial semigroups, and I think it would be splitting hairs to *not* use the category of semigroups for it.
- Jim (the original author) has not commented since a long time, hence, I hope it is not too much of a problem that I renamed one central notion: I believe "path algebra" is more commonly used than "quiver algebra".
- For reasons discussed above, it is better to not have an "invalid path". Hence, if we now provide invalid data to the constructor, then an error is raised. If we try to multiply paths that can't be concatenated, then "None" is returned, according to advice of Nicolas.

I believe this ticket is now ready for review (again). From my perspective, the organisation of the code makes sense (no distinction of digraph and quiver, paths are put into a separate module that will later be cythonised, representations respectively path algebras are put into separate modules, too, and the coercion framework is implemented).

The reviewer should please have a look at the documentation. I have put some documentation into `__init__.py`, which is hopefully the right thing to do to document a module that has sub-modules.

To be done in a follow-up ticket: The current code certainly is too slow. I have some preliminary faster Cython code that I plan to rebase on top of this branch. This should then also provide Gröbner bases for modules over path algebra quotients---specifically an F5 algorithm (in my latest article, I prove that F5 can compute Loewy layers for modules over basic algebras).

<a id='comment:2'></a>I've taken the liberty to fix some grammar. Also, I changed "free small category" to "path semigroup" a couple times, and I believe it would help to do the same everywhere else or explain how the path semigroup becomes a free small category explicitly (it's a bit confusing because the order of the edges in how one usually writes a path is the opposite of the order in which one composes arrows in a category).

Absolutely! I thought I had completely removed all references to the term "free small category". If it isn't fixed yet, then it needs work.

```
        In addition, the free algebra of a subquiver coerces into the
        algebra.
```
If "free algebra" means "path algebra", this is redundant as the same is claimed by the previous paragraph.

In other news, someone please check that everything works fine for the empty quiver...

<a id='comment:6'></a>I changed the doc again. Simon, can you keep working on the public/combinat/quivers branch? Otherwise the branch field is getting changed over and over here -- I certainly cannot push onto a branch in your namespace.

Do you think the following notions are now well-documented enough:
1) what "path" means in the context of quivers;
2) what "partial semigroup" means and that the path semigroup is a such?
By "well-documented enough" I mean, in particular, that the documentation is in those places where one would be looking for it.

I don't understand why we have two ways to compute paths in a path semigroup:

```
    def all_paths(self, start=None, end=None):
```
on the one hand, and

```
    def iter_paths_by_length_and_startpoint(self, d, v):
    def iter_paths_by_length_and_endpoint(self, d, v):
```
on the other. Does the former have any advantages at all, such as speed in the acyclic case? All I can say is that it is broken even in the acyclic case:

```
sage: Q = DiGraph({i: {i+1: "a"+str(i)} for i in range(2)})
sage: Q.edges()
[(0, 1, 'a0'), (1, 2, 'a1')]
sage: Q.path_semigroup().all_paths()
[e_0, a, 0, a*a, a*1, 0*a, 0*1, e_1, a, 1, e_2]
```
Apparently somewhere deep in the code it believes that every edge label is one character long. And it seems to check for acyclicity twice (and, for some reason, also checks for absence of loops?). Either way, is there a reason for this method to exist?

As I have stated above: I keep forgetting how to teach git to push to the right location, and the dev scripts will not push to a public place.

So, please tell me how I can push to a public branch.

I don't recall exactly, but if I recall correctly I added the iteration methods in order to have something that works in the acyclic case. I have just looked at the code: all_paths does not use the iterative methods. Perhaps it should!

Wow, that's very bad and needs to be fixed. Note that `list(Q.path_semigroup())` gives the correct result.

It shouldn't.

??

In `all_paths`, I only see one location where it is tested (however, it is tested in each round of the recursion, which is bad).

> (and, for some reason, also checks for absence of loops?).


If I recall correctly, when the code was written, the graph code did say that a loop does not count as a cycle. But apparently this has changed. So, perhaps we can remove the `has_loops()` test.

> Either way, is there a reason for this method to exist?


For `all_paths`? Hm. When I think about it, I guess the iterator of the path semigroup is all what we need.

It seems that either we need an `_element_constructor_` method for `QuiverRep_generic`, or we need to do something with `QuiverRepElement.__init__`. Namely, the following works:

```
sage: z = R(M.zero()._elems)
sage: z._elems
{1: ()}
sage: M.zero()._elems
{1: (0)}
```
And similarly

```
sage: m = M.an_element()
sage: R(m)
<HANGS>
sage: R(m._elems)
Element of quiver representation
sage: _._elems
{1: ()}
sage: m._elems
{1: (1)}
```
I think according to the specification of a quotient Q of X, it should always be possible to convert any element of X into Q.

I suggest to do a typetest for the input of `QuiverRepElement.__init__`.

`QuiverRepHom` overrides `__call__`, which is very bad. When implementing a map, one should only overload `_call_` and `_call_with_args` and a third method that I forgot and makes, e.g., a ring map applicable to ideals in the ring.

Why is that a problem in `Parent.__call__`? Well, `Parent.__call__` assumes that the convert map is well-implemented and thus tries to save a few CPU cycles by directly calling `_call_` (not `__call__`) of the map.

Obvious solution: Move `QuiverRepHom.__call__` to `QuiverRepHom._call_` resp. `QuiverRepHom._call_with_args`.

<a id='comment:4'></a>+1 on the recent changes (making the elements immutable; making set_element private, having a real hash function, ...)!

Just a random suggestions / questions:

- Maybe  `QuiverRepElement` could inherit from `ElementWrapper`? That would give it e.g. the hash for free.
- Is speed critical enough to motivate inheriting from ModuleElement?
- is there a reason to use `UniqueFactory` rather than `UniqueRepresentation`?
- _iadd_ and _isub_ change the element in place and therefore break immutability.
  Are those methods really necessary?
- In this file: vaector -> vector

I am done with my teaching, and will have some time starting from March 1st. If the review is not finished by then, let me know which piece need review and I'll work on it.

Cheers,
                                   Nicolas

No idea about this. I don't know how it works.

> - Is speed critical enough to motivate inheriting from ModuleElement?


We are talking about `QuiverRepElement`, right? Well, eventually this should become faster, too (but first, I'll focus on paths). After all, I plan to implement an F5 algorithm for modules over path algebras, and speed will be absolutely critical. But this could actually require more trickery (even free-lists, to save the time that is vasted for creating and deleting elements)---so much that it could be that internally I will use classes that will not be exposed to the user. So, perhaps internally I will use a class (certainly Cython cdef class) that has almost nothing to do with the current implementation.

> - is there a reason to use `UniqueFactory` rather than `UniqueRepresentation`?


We have long code to create a cache key, and we have long code to create an object from a given key (which involves choosing among different implementations). I think `UniqueFactory` is a better tool, since (in contrast to `UniqueRepresentation`) it allows for a clean separation between the two requirements "create key" and "create object".

However, one should do one thing: Let it inherit from `WithEqualityById`.

> - _iadd_ and _isub_ change the element in place and therefore break immutability.


Ouch, that's bad.

>   Are those methods really necessary?


Well, `_add_` should be enough (then, `a+=b` will assign `a+b` to a new instance under the old name `a`, but would not change `a` in place). Having in place addition mutate `a` makes sense in some time-critical applications, but of course not when it is hashable (in particular when the hash is cached!).

I'll have a second look at the file, to see if there are more cases of mutation.

Thank you in advance!

It's really just a simple base class that handle the trivial stuff
when one wants to implement an element whose data structure consists
of a single object (e.g. a tuple). See ElementWrapper?

> We are talking about `QuiverRepElement`, right? Well, eventually this should become faster, too (but first, I'll focus on paths). After all, I plan to implement an F5 algorithm for modules over path algebras, and speed will be absolutely critical. But this could actually require more trickery (even free-lists, to save the time that is vasted for creating and deleting elements)---so much that it could be that internally I will use classes that will not be exposed to the user. So, perhaps internally I will use a class (certainly Cython cdef class) that has almost nothing to do with the current implementation.


Oh I see; I mistakenly thought it was modeling an element representing
a quiver representation. Not an element thereof. Now I see the
potential need for speed.

Ok. At some point we should think about whether we could make a better
distinction in UniqueRepresentation. But that's of course for later.

Good question.

Is this how modules are added to the docs nowadays (`:doc:`Quviers <quivers/index>``)? I didn't know that.

<a id='comment:0'></a>Hi!

With #15801 and this ticket, I am getting the following error:

```
        sage: Q = DiGraph({1:{3:['a']}, 2:{3:['b']}}).path_semigroup()
        sage: spaces = {1: QQ^2, 2: QQ^3, 3: QQ^2}
        sage: maps = {(1, 3, 'a'): (QQ^2).Hom(QQ^2).identity(), (2, 3, 'b'): [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]}
        sage: M = Q.representation(QQ, spaces, maps)
	sage: TestSuite(M).run()
	Failure in _test_category:
	...
	The following tests failed: _test_category
```

And indeed:

```
sage: M in M.category()
False
```

This is due to the following (apparent?) inconsistency:

```
sage: M.category().base_ring()
Path algebra of Multi-digraph on 3 vertices over Rational Field
sage: M.base_ring()
Rational Field
```

Question: which one do we want to change?

Cheers,
                               Nicolas

Ok.

> But, please fix this in #15801 and not here, as this ticket is closed already.


I agree the fix belongs to a followup ticket, and I am fine putting it
in #15801. Would you have a chance to handle it though? I had a quick
try, and am not sure of the repercussions: in particular, to avoid
ambiguities, should the current `_base_ring` attribute and the
associated `base_ring` method be renamed to something like
`base_ring_of_representation`?

I fixed the docbuilding issues in #10963/#15801, and the latter is
fair game for you if you feel like it.

Cheers,
                                   Nicolas

<a id='comment:4'></a>Thinking twice about my first feelings ... For a quiver
representation, I would also tend to have `base_ring` return QQ above,
and the rep be accordingly in `Modules(QQ)`. So far, in Sage,
`Modules(R)` is about which ring `R` we do the linear algebra with, compute
bases, etc. Later on we will have a proper hierarchy of categories for
representations (well, I have some stuff in the Sage-Combinat queue),
and then it will be time to put the quiver representations in the
appropriate category of this hierarchy.

The case of `QQ[x]^3` is a bit different, since we really do the
linear algebra over `QQ[x]`.

No strong opinion though ...
