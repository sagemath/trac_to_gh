version 5.0 beta7

sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realizations.py
element methods to_positive_chamber, reduced_word
may give infinite loops for affine root systems

```
R=sage.combinat.root_system.all.RootSystem(['A',1,1])
rl = R.root_lattice()
mu = rl.from_vector(vector([0,1]))
mu.to_positive_chamber()
```

For elements of a root lattice realization:
1. Added method reflect which reflects across a hyperplane orthogonal
to a (co)root.
2. Renamed to_positive_chamber to to_dominant_chamber, and added case checking
for affine root systems which prevents infinite looping. Root systems
that are not finite and not affine are not checked.
3. Added method weyl_action which acts on a vector by a Weyl group element.
4. Added method weyl_stabilizer which returns indices of simple reflections
fixing a weight.

Hi Mark,

> where the function input will lead to an infinite loop?
> Can I just assert conditions that will ensure things like that
> don't happen, or should I emit a more precise error?
> Pointing me to example code will suffice.

Sorry for my delayed answer. In the affine case, please add a test on
level; something like:

```
     assert not self.parent().is_affine() or self.level() >= 0, "This element is not in the orbit of the fundamental chamber"
```

For the general Kac-Moody case: I think we can assume that a user
playing with those has some non trivial background. In that case, and
unless there is a cheap and easy to implement test as in the affine
case, it would be perfectly fine to write in the documentation
something like:

```
    INPUT:

    - ``self`` -- an element in the orbit of the fundamental chamber

    .. warning::

        The behavior of this method is not specified if ``self`` is
	not in the orbit of the fundamental chamber (the algorithm may
	run in an infinite loop). This never occurs for finite root
	systems. For affine Weyl groups, an element is in the orbit of
	the fundamental chamber iff it is of positive level (see
	:meth:`level`), and this is currently checked, but do not rely
	on it::

	     sage: ...
```

Otherwise put: as long as it is well documented, it is preferable for
power users to have a feature that needs to be used with care, than no
feature. Sage should be usable as a race car for those who wants one.

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

Hi Mark,

Here are some comments. First of all, I moved your patch up in the queue since presumably
you want it to go into Sage soon. Then I can do the testing on the sage-combinat queue.

- Please use "hg qrefresh -e" and add a description of the changes you made. This should
appear at the beginning of the file. The same description can then be used on the trac
server once you upload it there.

- Nicolas once told me that every method should have a one-line short description.
  Then a more detailed description can follow. So for example in your new method
  "def reflection" have one line with a description

   Also, for consistency in
 	"Reflect ``self`` across the hyperplane orthogonal to `root`."
  should it be "Reflects ...."?

- Please use the syntax

    .. warning::

  for the warning.

Also, there are doctest failures
