```
When a CallableSymbolicExpressionRing is created with only one variable, arguments is still plural and an extra comma is printed.

Correct, #variable > 1:

```
sage: CallableSymbolicExpressionRing([var('q p')])
Callable function ring with arguments (q, p)
```

Incorrect:

```
sage: CallableSymbolicExpressionRing([var('q')])
Callable function ring with arguments (q,)
```

The extra comma, I *suspect*, is because the repr returns something like "... arguments (%s)" % variable_tuple. This is what would be expected of a singular tuple.

Should be easy to fix.  Maybe you can add this to the reference manual at the place you suggest, too.

Otherwise this is fine, though if you're already doing it you may want to switch to Python 3 string formatting - up to you.
