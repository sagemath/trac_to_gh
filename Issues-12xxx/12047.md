<div id="comment:0"></div>

Currently, in sage-4.7.2:

```
sage: integral_numerical(log(x), 0, 0)
(nan, nan)
```

Mathematically, the integral should certainly be zero: there is a
primitive function which is continuous and defined at 0.  Symbolically, we can compute the integral correctly:

```
sage: integral(log(x), (x,0,0))
0
```

So I would like to add a special-case check for `integral_numerical()`: if the interval of integration is a point, then always return 0.

I realize that this means that also the integral of 1/x from 0 to 0
would be 0, even though 1/x has no continuous primitive at 0.  But
according to the Lebesgue theory of integration, I think this is not
even a problem.

Also: remove various unused things from the file `sage/gsl/integration.pyx` and clean up the documentation.

Was that Fourier stuff ever going to be used?  Or is it elsewhere?   I didn't really look at it. 

Considering that

```
sage: integral(1/x,x,0,0)
0
```
already, I guess we should do this.  Are there *any* symbolic integrals on a point that Maxima doesn't give 0 for?

I'll review this more formally - especially the doc stuff, which seems good at a quick glance - if I get a chance, otherwise someone else feel free to do so!

Replying to [@orlitzky](#comment%3A11):
> Positive review from me, then, although this is my first review so you may want a second opinion.

First time for everything, right?  I guess this patch is pretty safe, it makes only a small functional change to Sage.  If all doctests pass and the documentation builds and looks okay (which is the case), then this patch should be merged.

Thanks for the review!

@orlitzky:

Given the author and his current role, I'm sure this isn't an issue, but one thing to make sure to do with things that change the reference manual is to do 

```
sage -docbuild reference html
```
or the like, just to check that links look right and there isn't a misplaced colon or something.  

Looking forward to seeing many more reviews - and other contributions? - from you!  Thanks for helping.
