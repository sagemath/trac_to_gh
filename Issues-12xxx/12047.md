Currently, in sage-4.7.2:

```
sage: integral_numerical(log(x), 0, 0)
(nan, nan)
```

Mathematically, the integral should certainly be zero: there is a
primitive function which is continuous and defined at 0.  Symbolically, we can compute the integral correctly:

```
sage: integral(log(x), (x,0,0))
0
```

So I would like to add a special-case check for `integral_numerical()`: if the interval of integration is a point, then always return 0.

I realize that this means that also the integral of 1/x from 0 to 0
would be 0, even though 1/x has no continuous primitive at 0.  But
according to the Lebesgue theory of integration, I think this is not
even a problem.

Also: remove various unused things from the file `sage/gsl/integration.pyx` and clean up the documentation.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Was that Fourier stuff ever going to be used?  Or is it elsewhere?   I didn't really look at it. 

Considering that

```
sage: integral(1/x,x,0,0)
0
```
already, I guess we should do this.  Are there *any* symbolic integrals on a point that Maxima doesn't give 0 for?

I'll review this more formally - especially the doc stuff, which seems good at a quick glance - if I get a chance, otherwise someone else feel free to do so!
