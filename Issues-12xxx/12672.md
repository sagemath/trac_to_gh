Currently, the standard PPL spkg only builds the C++ interface. However, `CLooG-PPL` (see #12666) needs the C-header `ppl_c.h` as well.

Therefore I suggest to slightly modify the install script of our PPL spkg:

* Do `make install` instead of `make install-strip` -- I admit that I am not sure whether this is needed, and perhaps `make install-strip` yields faster code. A reviewer should comment on that.
* Modify the configuration options, such that the C interface is built.

Interestingly, when I tried doc tests with a Sage version that used massive optimization (via graphite), a lot of tests went a lot slower (by a factor of 2 in some cases) than without the optimization.

I had the impression that the particularly bad cases were related to polyhedra. Therefore, I try to build ppl with `make install-strip` again, and keep my fingers crossed that it will improve the situation.

That's too fragile, nobody guarantees that this is the only system with a bad `m4`.

If you create a patch, I'll be happy to review it. Note that we already require the *existence* of `m4` in prereq (MPIR needs it).

Here is a first try.

But it doesn't work, because the extended bash test doesn't quite do what we want.

```
$ if [[ 1.4.11 > 1.4.5 ]]; then echo "bigger"; fi
$
```
I cringe at the more comprehensive solutions to this problem I found on the internet, though.   The `sort -V` command might have been helpful, but that flag isn't universally available.
