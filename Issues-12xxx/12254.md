At the elliptic curve workshop, many people were disturbed by this:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a')
sage: E.torsion_subgroup() == AdditiveAbelianGroup([5])
```

The problem is that equality is just comparing invariants.

I would be very much more disturbed if the output was False (it is True, by the way).  I think this is entirely consistent with the good output:

```
sage: AdditiveAbelianGroup([5])
Additive abelian group isomorphic to Z/5
sage: E.torsion_subgroup()
Torsion Subgroup isomorphic to Z/5 associated to the Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10*x - 20 over Rational Field
```

It may be that back in 2012 the torsion subgroup still described itself as a multiplicative group, which was Bad and got fixed, but I do not remember when.

If William (who reported this) agrees we can make it another "don't fix".

We have now

```
sage: sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a')
sage: sage: E.torsion_subgroup() == AdditiveAbelianGroup([5])
True
```

and this should be closed. The issue is longer present.
