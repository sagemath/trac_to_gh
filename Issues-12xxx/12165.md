This bug is about a non-obvious, wierd behavior when plotting a certain type of weighted graph.

I posted this on Google groups here:  http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/fc6d0a7e2911984c/22914ce6373dd5c0

This code results in a graph plotted with the  (single) edges labeled with the weight between each pair of vertices:

```
M = Matrix([[0,1,-1,5],[1,0,-1/2,-1],[-1,-1/2,0,2],[5,-1,2,0]])  
G = Graph(M,sparse=True)  
G.plot(edge_labels=True)
```
Whereas this code does not and instead has multi-edges labeled "None":

```
M = Matrix([[0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0]])  
G = Graph(M,sparse=True)  
G.plot(edge_labels=True)
```
Here was the answer I got for reference:

I think it's something like this (take with grain of salt, I'm bad at  multitasking):  Briefly, it's not interpreting the second matrix as a weighted  adjacency matrix.  If you specifically tell it that it is, say by  

```
M = Matrix([[0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0]])  
G = Graph(M,weighted=True)
```
it should behave.  Less briefly: the code in graph.py uses the following logic to decide  whether these two are weighted or not:

  if format == 'adjacency_matrix':
    entries = uniq(data.list())  for e in entries:
      try:
        e = int(e)  assert e >= 0
      except:
        if weighted is False:
          raise ValueError ("Non-weighted graph's"+  " adjacency matrix must have only nonnegative"+  " integer entries")
        weighted = True  if multiedges is None: multiedges = False  break

IOW, to decide if it should set weighted to True, it loops over each  entry and (1) tries to convert it to an integer, and (2) asserts that  it's non-negative.  If either of those fail, then it decides that  weighted should be True (in this case weighted starts as None).  So the first graph works because the nonnegative check fails (or the  integral check fails, I'm too lazy to confirm what direction the  matrix entries are iterated in..)  The second graph's matrix is  integral and nonnegative, so it sneaks through, and things get silly  after that.  Would you like to open a bug report on trac?  This should be easy to fix.  Doug
