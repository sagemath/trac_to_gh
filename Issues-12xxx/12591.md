The code

```
g = circle((0,0),1,rgbcolor='red',fill=True, alpha=0.5)
graphics_array([g,g,g]).show()
```
produces three circles, the first two with color 0xFF7F7F (html-color-code), the third one with color 0xFF3F3F (html-color-code). But all three should have the same color.

The culprit was the line

```
        g.save(filename, dpi=dpi, figure=figure, sub=subplot,
               verify=do_verify, axes=axes, **kwds)
```

in sage/plot/graphics.py. Here g was defined inside the previous loop, so after the loop it gets once again the last value.

I have just extracted the last object by stopping the loop one step before.

Noted.  I tried getting rid of that last call to `save` and instead doing all in the loop, but that didn't work.  Probably we'll need to directly import stuff like

```
            from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
            figure.set_canvas(FigureCanvasAgg(figure))
            # this messes up the aspect ratio!
            #figure.canvas.mpl_connect('draw_event', pad_for_tick_labels)

            # tight_layout adjusts the *subplot* parameters so ticks aren't cut off, etc.
            figure.tight_layout()

            opts = dict(dpi=dpi, transparent=transparent)
            if fig_tight is True:
                opts['bbox_inches'] = 'tight'
            if self._bbox_extra_artists:
                opts['bbox_extra_artists'] = self._bbox_extra_artists

            figure.savefig(filename, **opts)
```
from the singular graphics object save code.

Yes, this works, though one has to (for now) get rid of the transparent and I just got rid of the last two if clauses since they didn't seem relevant to the array case for now.

Actually, it turns out that fixing this ticket makes that issue even worse.  It's only in that save command which I just removed that all these extra options get used at all!  So the "right" fix for this would fix both; the current fix would leave that the same but still have the problem mentioned.

Your current fix, though, as far as I can tell, doesn't really make things *worse*, because for me in vanilla Sage I get for the command you mention in this comment
> Note that the legend in the third picture is no longer duplicated, but does not look the same:

that it just has two of the weird legends, so one weird legend is better than duplicated weird legends, right?

Let me know what you think; properly doctested (well, mentioned in a tests section, though perhaps we could extract the last element of a graphics array and check that it just has one figure), this change is a step in the right direction, I think.
