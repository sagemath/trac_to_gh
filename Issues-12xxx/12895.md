With this patch, a category can implement a nested class SubcategoryMethods that provides methods for all subcategories of this category (similar to ParentMethods that provides methods for all parents of all subcategories of this category).

This is implemented by updating the class of each category C, at the end of its initialization, to insert C.subcategory_class as superclass (like what is done for Parents and Elements).

This is a bit tricky, since the super_categories method needs to be called during the initialization.

The patch is under finalization on http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/

Hi Simon,

I have just been through the patch on the Sage-Combinat queue (same as here previously, but rebased a couple times). I improved a bit the documentation and fixed three remaining doctests failures and reposted. On my side, it's good to go. Please review!

Note: the patch includes two small fixes in sage.combinat.sf which I am going to ask Anne to double check.

Cheers,
                                            Nicolas
