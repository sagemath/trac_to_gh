<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

I have upgraded the patches a little, to include all the patches from the python27 port in FreeBSD.  The extra stuff isn't needed to make python on sage build and pass all the internal tests.  But maybe it fixes some other problems for sage python on FreeBSD that we don't know about.  (Looking at the file sizes, I think it is only the setup.py patch that is different.)
