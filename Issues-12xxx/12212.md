Colormaps work for `plot3d`, but not for `implicit_plot3d` or `parametric_plot3d`.  

Compare the following:

```
sage: var('r v')
sage: cmsel = [colormaps['autumn'](i) for i in sxrange(0,1,0.05)]
sage: p = plot3d(0.2*(r**2 + v**2) + cos(2*r)*sin(2*v),(r,-2,2), (v,-2,2), adaptive=True, color=cmsel, plot_points=10, opacity=0.9)
sage: p2 = sphere((0,0,0),1,color='black',opacity=0.5)
sage: (p+p2).show(aspect_ratio=(1,1,1), figsize=[7,3])
```


```
sage: cmsel = [colormaps['autumn'](i) for i in sxrange(0,1,0.05)]
sage: var('x,y,z')
sage: implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2==4, (x, -3, 3), (y, -3,3), (z, -3,3), color=cmsel)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (49, 0))

I've noticed that the functionality for dealing with a color map can be found in the `plot3d_adaptive` method in `sage.plot.plot3d.plot3d` (notice the `adaptive=True` keyword in the above).  This code only supposes that the graphical object is an instance of `IndexFaceSet`, and so it's not too hard to take out the code and apply it to parametric plots and implicit plots as well.

In fact, building upon the original idea one can apply color maps that vary not just in the z-direction, but according to the level sets of some arbitrary function.  This is nice, for instance, if you want to paint a surface according to its curvature.  And the original idea can also be adapted to gradually vary other texture attributes (for instance opacity) according to some scalar function.

I've put this functionality into a class tentatively called `GradualTextureTransform`, but since I'm not entirely happy with the class layout, I wanted to ask for your input before turning this into a full-fledged patch.  I've put all of my code into a [sagenb worksheet](http://www.sagenb.org/home/pub/3910) and I've also uploaded some sample images.  

One issue with the worksheet is that the JMOL applet crashes (at least in my browser) after rendering a bunch of colormapped images.  This could be because the colormap algorithm basically splits each surface into 10s or 100s of parts and colors those pieces individually, so having too many of these processed images around may be too much for the applet...

This is great!  Indeed my original interest was to color by some other function :)

Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A11):

Thanks for getting this started.  Could you clarify what you think the work issues are?  Maybe we just need to set up the other plot commands to call this when they are given colormaps for the `color` argument?

Do you have any timings for applying these textures?  Is the code reasonably fast?

Hello,

I have worked hard, and managed to modify the class IndexFaceSet, so that it can handle colored faces (one face per color). One can now give one more parameter to IndexFaceSet, which is a texture list. This is only preliminary, as this new behaviour can only be viewed with tachyon, and from the texture only the color is used.

Is there somebody familiar with jmol syntax and wanting to help ?

I have introduced a new argument for a pair (coloring function, colormap) in parametric plot. This can produce that (in tachyon and x3d only for the moment):

After reading the doc of jmol here

http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs/#isosurfacesurfaceobject--surfacedata-derivedisosurfaces

I am rather pessimistic about achieving to transmit colored surfaces to jmol. Currently, we send `pmesh` files to jmol. Using this format, there seems to be no way to give a color to every face (other than horrible splitting : one `pmesh` file for every color). 

One other possibility would be to use `obj` files instead. But jmol is using the `obj` format in a strange (bad?) way : colors are coded in the **names** of the groups, instead of using the material `mtl` file. To do this, one would need to group faces according to their colors, which would take some work to code.

This same work would probably also be necessary just to make sure that the `obj` file output works correctly for colored surfaces.

I have not yet understood if the `json` format allows to deal eeasily with colored surfaces.

This is fantastic!!  I'm excited to try it out :)

I wouldn't worry too much about jmol -- I think that eventually Sage will transition to another interactive 3d viewer since java support is declining anyway.  For example, I believe sagemath cloud uses three.js.

Hello,

I have still not taken care of the jmol issue, which seems to be hard without changing jmol itself.

I have changed the json output in IndexFaceSet, which is a private format used in the notebook for the viewer `'canvas3d'`. I have also proposed the corresponding changes on sagenb.

The `'canvas3d'` viewer (using `json` output with colors defined here and a patched `sagenb`) results look good, but there seems to be a little problem in the notebook. Here is one example

```
from sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface import ParametricSurface
cm = colormaps.autumn
def c(x,y): return sin(x*y)**2
def g(x,y): return x, y, x**2 + y**2
P1 = ParametricSurface(g, (srange(-10,10,0.1), srange(-5,5.0,0.1)),(c,cm))
```
When one defines several parametric surfaces, say P1 and P2. Try P1.show(viewer='canvas3d') inside one cell. Then change **this cell** to P2.show(viewer='canvas3d'). It will still show P1 and will never change, whatever you do to P1. No such problem inside a new cell. Seems to be some caching problem.

Thanks for this pointer; I find that on very large tickets it pays just to look at diffs so seeing the changes is easy.  Interestingly, now the diffs look correct as well - they definitely didn't before - so I am confused!  So I'm quite sorry for the noise.

On a related note, I would recommend adding something about Jmol not working with this in "main" documentation, like

```
+       One can use the keyword ``colordata`` to color the surface using a
+       coloring function and a colormap::
```
or 

```
+One can instead provide a coloring function and a color map::
+
```
Also, do you want to include src/sage/plot/texture_map.py in the reference manual like you've added index_face_set, or is that all internals better left out?  You (or the original author) spent a lot of time on it so I'm sure it's fine if you do.  (Or did I screw up again and it is actually there? I *think* I didn't miss it...)

Hello,

I have polished the doc a little bit more, and included `texture_map` in the doc. In my opinion this is getting closer to the `needs_review` status. It is already quite a big "patch".

True.  What would you say still needs review (e.g., which commits)?  Remember, you yourself can review jvkersch's contributions.

Thanks for all the work here -- I've been testing it too and I'm really impressed with the progress!  Here are some things that I think still need to be addressed:

* I think there need to be some more doctests that verify the coloring of triangles is working.  At the moment, if some bug stopped colors from being applied to triangles, I think most of the doctests would still pass.  Maybe at least you could add tests in `IndexFaceSet` for `tachyon_repr`, `obj`, and `x3d_geometry` similar to the one for `json_repr`.

* Was `IndexFaceSet.dual` broken before this patch?  Is there another ticket open for it?

* The argument `texture_list` for `IndexFaceSet.__init__` displaces the argument `enclosed`, which technically means that the new behavior is not backwards-compatible.  I'm sorry to bring this up, because I think it's a really annoying detail, but I think Sage policy is that there should be a deprecation period in case someone somewhere is using `S = IndexFaceSet(face_list, point_list, False)`.  One thing would be to add a check `if type(texture_list) is bool:..." which issues a deprecation warning and fixes the arguments.  Or, maybe better, put the texture argument after the enclosure one, and always use it as a keyword.

* Since colormaps don't work with jmol, I think the demonstrations in parametric_plot3d and elsewhere should specifiy a viewer where they do work.  For example:

```
sage: u,v = var('u,v')
sage: col = rainbow(10, 'rgbtuple')
sage: def cf(u,v): return sin(u^2 + v^2)**2
sage: parametric_plot3d((u, u+v, v), (u, -3,3), (v, -3, 3), colordata=(cf, colormaps.PiYG), viewer='tachyon')
```

* Why do this example and some others look so bad?  I think the first examples (the ones users are most likely to see) should be chosen to look really good.  If specifying a large number of plot points and marking #long or #optional is necessary, then I think that's better than fast but low-quality examples.  (Fast, low-quality examples are good for automatic testing, in parts of the documentation that new users are not likely to start with.)

* The syntax for colormaps of plotted functions (e.g. with `plot3d`) and parametric surfaces should be the same if at all possible.  Since `plot3d` calls `parametric_plot3d`, they should use the same code for colormaps.  Also check `plot3d_adaptive` to see what it's doing.

* In `parametric_plot3d`, wouldn't it be more consistent to use `color_data` for the argument name, rather than `colordata`?  I know `colormap` is an established argument name (coming from matplot lib, I think), but I think it's better to use Sage's convention if possible.

* `ImplicitSurface` is derived from `IndexFaceSet`, so it should be reasonably straightforward to get colormaps for implicit plots working too.  Is there a good way to do it without just duplicating the code from `ParametricSurface`?  There seems to already be some duplicated code between them.  Maybe there needs to be some other kind of `PlotSurface` class that contains the common code?

Thanks for your comments. I have adressed some of them

It is not really broken, just a bit fragile. I put a working doctest.

This is not as straightforward as it may look. It would be great to do that, but the code for implicit plot is very sophisticated, and it is not easy to see where to put the color assignment of faces.

PLUS:

I have reformatted texture_map so that the use of colormaps is simpler.

Can you post a link to that discussion, if it is on a world-readable list?  Just in case it is, if you contacted privately of course there is no need to do so.

This was a private mail exchange. The conclusion by Bob Hanson is

Later this week it will appear in Jmol 14.2.5.

So it would be great to have #16003 and #16004 use this Jmol version.

Great!!  I think there is some codesmell here though, both in duplicated code and in the inconsistent interface.

Niles, is this easy for you to implement?  I don't want to have this held up unduly, though you are right that the interface should be consistent for colors.

Let me see what I see as the status here:
* Needs chapoton to verify what he has already positively reviewed.  (That is presumably everything he didn't write.)
* Niles can mention if this is the only thing he is worried about, or whether other changes still need review (or doctests needed), etc.
* I'm surprised that something like `float_to_integer` doesn't already exist, I recall we used some very similar hacks before.  Huh.
* Leave jmol incorporation to another ticket, now that I see the commits that "set up" jmol don't actually require it - this will allow us to get this in without

Unfortunately, no, I don't think this will be easy.  This ticket has been open for 3 years, and there's been an **amazing** amount of progress in the last month, but I think we need to be patient and make sure that when we establish new functionality we do so in a way that is carefully-considered and well-polished.

Thanks, Niles.  I didn't realize there was anything backwards-incompatible here, just additional keywords, but I take your point.

Unrelated and very minor note: in parametric_plot3d.py there is a superfluous variable declaration

```
+           sage: u,v = var('u,v')
```
which should be removed.

Niles, was the color keyword in json what you were referring to, or something else?

I think I was unclear -- sorry.  As I understand it, the code here isn't backward incompatible.  What I meant is that the uniform interface I envision probably isn't compatible with the current interface.  So the idea to release now, fix later (which I generally support!) would mean that we can't "fix" until after a year of deprecation.  

And I think this is about more than interface -- I think the code may have to be reorganized, with some methods moved to different classes, and there would need to be deprecation for that as well.  

I'm really frustrated about this too -- I'd hate to see this rot for another 3 years -- but I just can't convince myself it's good to release this as is.  Do you disagree?

But I don't know that these are insurmountable.  I mean, how else *could* one give not just a cmap/color, but also a way to actually allocate it?  I guess one could require using it post-hoc like in texture_map.py but I don't think that is necessary.

Also, I have now actually read through a lot more of the code as a whole.  I see three things.
* Awesome added (needed) documentation and cleanup everywhere, very nice
* Joris' original texture map file, which seems to be used nowhere else and allows one to apply such a transform *after* creating a graphics object

Sorry, but I really do not see what I could do to improve things here.

The Texture class is there to handle a single texture. It makes no sense to feed it with a colormap. So it is not possible to use the color keyword for a colormap, because the color keyword is handled by the Texture class.

I really think that the `global_texture` dichotomy makes sense, as it is not at all the same thing to use a single Texture or one Texture for every vertex.

Maybe one could make something like a class `TextureValuedFunction`, but this seems a bit heavy to me.

I would like to put this ticket back to `needs review`.

Correct, this is #11275 which for some reason I didn't report upstream when I realized it a few days ago.

Ah -- this must be one source of our miscommunication.  As I understand it, a texture is a color-valued function on a surface.  So I guess what you mean by a single texture is what I would call a *constant* texture.  And I don't think it would be heavy to make a class which treats textures in the more general sense.  The code for this is, as I recall, already existing in what you've written, but has been duplicated in various places because there isn't a single class for it.

<a id='comment:77'></a>
I've thought more about this now.  First, here are some observations:



* `plot3d_adaptive`, `TrianglePlot`, and the rest of tri_plot.py
   - This code is disjoint from the rest of the plotting code and needs
    to be integrated at some point in the future.
   - Makes use of `IndexFaceSet.partition`, but that method isn't used
     anywhere else, except now in `GradualTextureTransform`


* Each face in an `IndexFaceSet` has a color attribute, but no other
  texture attributes (namely opacity, but also ambient, diffuse,
  specular)
  - The color_data argument, as it currently stands, directly sets
    this color attribute for each face as its constructed in
    `ParametricSurface.triangulate` or `ImplicitSurface.triangulate`
  - The two different triangulation methods differ substantially, and
    therefore probably shouldn't be unified
  - This approach (adding data to triangles) can only set color
    values, not other texture values, unless `IndexFaceSet` is expanded
  - I believe this is also connected to the problem of viewing with jmol, but I'm not completely sure.
  - Surfaces constructed with `plot3d_adaptive` are triangulated with a different codebase (tri_plot.py) and then converted to `IndexFaceSet` objects.

* `IndexFaceSet` is a subclass of `PrimitiveObject` (as in graphics
  primitive), and hence has support for arbitrary texture information
  via `PrimitiveObject.set_texture`.
  - This sets the same texture information for *all* faces in a given
    `IndexFaceSet` instance.
  - The code in `plot3d_adaptive`, and hence also in
    `GradualTextureTransform` which copies it, makes a different
    instance of `IndexFaceSet` for each texture (e.g. color).  These are
    combined in a `Graphics3dGroup`.
  - Grouping triangles by texture makes some sense because often
    there will be many triangles with the same texture.
  - `plot3d_adaptive` and `GradualTextureTransform` use the method
    `IndexFaceSet.partition` to partition triangles according to the
    values of a scalar function.  In both cases this is done after a
    single `IndexFaceSet` has been constructed.

* The `color_data` approach (setting attributes of individual faces as
  they're constructed) is faster than the `GradualTextureTransform`
  approach by nearly a factor of 2 (or 1/2; see timings below).
  - This makes sense, given that `GradualTextureTransform` has to
    construct the triangulation first and then partition it.
  - The `color_data` approach might be more memory-intensive, but I
    don't know how to measure this.


---

It could be possible to combine these two approaches:

* Partition triangles according to texture and hence take advantage of
  the more robust support for textures in the graphics classes.

* Construct this partition during the triangulation process, rather
  than after the fact.

Before I start working on this, please let me know if you have suggestions or concerns about this idea.

Thanks!

Oops, forgot the timing stuff.

First, general setup:

```
# setup
var('r v')
cmsel = [colormaps['autumn'](i) for i in sxrange(0,1,0.05)]
f(r,v) = 0.2*(r**2 + v**2) + cos(2*r)*sin(2*v)

from sage.plot.plot3d.texture_map import ColormapTransform
CMT = ColormapTransform(colormaps.autumn, 'height_z')

clebsch(x,y,z) = 81*(x^3+y^3+z^3)-189*(x^2*y+x^2*z+y^2*x+y^2*z+z^2*x+z^2*y) +54*x*y*z+126*(x*y+x*z+y*z)-9*(x^2+y^2+z^2)-9*(x+y+z)+1
def R(x,y,z): return z

```

Now compare no colormap, colormap with plot3d_adaptive, the color_data approach, and the `GradualTextureTransform` approach:

```
sage: # base
sage: %time q = plot3d(f,(r,-2,2), (v,-2,2))
CPU times: user 1.91 ms, sys: 75 µs, total: 1.98 ms
Wall time: 1.93 ms

sage: # with adaptive
sage: %time p = plot3d(f,(r,-2,2), (v,-2,2), adaptive=True, color=cmsel)
CPU times: user 29.2 ms, sys: 6.52 ms, total: 35.7 ms
Wall time: 31 ms

sage: # with color_data
sage: % time s = parametric_plot3d((r,v,f),(r,-2,2), (v,-2,2), color_data=(cf,colormaps.PiYG))
CPU times: user 1.89 ms, sys: 74 µs, total: 1.96 ms
Wall time: 1.92 ms

sage: # with GTT
sage: %time t = CMT.apply(parametric_plot3d((r,v,f),(r,-2,2), (v,-2,2)))
CPU times: user 4.55 ms, sys: 911 µs, total: 5.46 ms
Wall time: 4.84 ms

sage: %time t = CMT.apply(s)
CPU times: user 2.29 ms, sys: 724 µs, total: 3.01 ms
Wall time: 2.67 ms

```


An example that takes longer to plot, to see how adding colormap affects the time:

```

sage: %time k = implicit_plot3d(clebsch, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2), (z,-2,2))
CPU times: user 6.71 ms, sys: 292 µs, total: 7 ms
Wall time: 6.88 ms

sage: %time m = implicit_plot3d(clebsch, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2), (z,-2,2), color_data=(R,cm))
CPU times: user 7.89 ms, sys: 371 µs, total: 8.26 ms
Wall time: 7.98 ms

sage: %time j = CMT.apply(k)
CPU times: user 12.5 ms, sys: 2.86 ms, total: 15.3 ms
Wall time: 13.2 ms
```

Well, I've been thinking about this approach, and the fact that it would produce a different `IndexFaceSet` for every texture value.

Wow, that is a lot smarter.  I don't know if we can do that in pure Python, though.

I think we can keep that file in but remove it from the manual... I mean, as I see it (if I recall correctly), it does allow things to be applied after the fact, which could actually be useful (rather than starting a new plot from scratch).

chapoton, what do you think about Niles' ideas?  I will be happy to check out the upstream sagenb ticket as well once I know that this solution is agreeable to both of you.

I have corrected one failing doctest related to Mobius band.

I am happy with the solution of using `color` instead of `color_data`.

I do not have a strong opinion about keeping or not the `texture_map` file. Maybe I would prefer to keep it, as it is the only way to get a transparency effect so far. But this should not stop the progress here. So either way is ok for me.

I think that we still do not ship a recent enough version of jmol that could accept the color information. Is this true ?

It would be good to have #7744 at our disposal in order to be able to save x3d files properly.

Do you really think it's ready to be part of the Sage library?  Joris said he wasn't happy with the class layout, and it hasn't changed substantially.

It was claimed that the functionality was in version 14.2.5 -- I don't know how to upgrade jmol though.

I have got two different info versions:

Later this week it will appear in Jmol 14.2.5. (10th of august)

Released as https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol-beta/Jmol%2014.3/Jmol%2014.3.6/

(the 18th of august)

I am not sure I understand their numbering system..

But this was probably just after the jmol we ship now (jmol-14.2.4_2014.08.03.tar.bz2)

I upgraded jmol successfully, but no colormaps.  However I did notice a serious problem with the try/except checks for the color keyword: `TypeError` is the error when something doesn't have `len()`.  I've fixed that now.

p.s.  If someone else wants to try upgrading jmol, there's a little more to it than what Karl said, but not much.  You have to make the tarball in the right way, and this is described in `build/pkgs/jmol/SPKGS.txt`.  You also have to update the version number in `build/pkgs/jmol/package-version.txt`.

I was asking Jonathan and chapoton, of course, as that was my point too.  I'm sure chapoton or myself would be happy to turn that into a patch, we both have some experience with that.   But if it's not identifiable, then that sort of misses the point.

> new feature: pmesh files can contain triangle colors


which should in fact already **be** in the version Niles made!  Maybe the interface is not as obvious?  At any rate, that should definitely be in 14.2.9, according to this.  It must be around commit r19940 (see the [browser](https://sourceforge.net/p/jmol/code/commit_browser)) but I can't find it.

Probably you need to delete your cache; you may still not have the latest jQuery, that is usually what caused this various times for people using the develop stuff.

It also occurs to me that if jmol ended up working, we would need to amend this branch anyway, because there are several references to how jmol does *not* work!  If we can resolve it within a week I say let's do so, otherwise I think it's better to have this in with the various warnings against using jmol BUT working hard at resolving that, since most people would be using that.

Okay, jmol does indeed 'work' (though without the colormap) in command line and notebook, though the Tachyon pic is the static piece in the notebook, I think. 

```
sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface import ParametricSurface
sage: cm = colormaps.autumn
sage: def c(x,y): return sin(x*y)**2
sage: def g(x,y): return x, y, x**2 + y**2
sage: P1 = ParametricSurface(g, (srange(-10,10,0.1), srange(-5,5.0,0.1)),color=(c,cm))
sage: P1.show() 
```
However,

```
sage: sage: var('x,y,z')
(x, y, z)
sage: t = (sin(2*y+3*z)**2).function(x,y,z)
sage: cm = colormaps.gist_rainbow
sage: sage: implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2==4, (x, -3, 3), (y, -3,3), (z, -3,3), color=(t,cm))
```
doesn't.  Given that this is supposed to work with Tachyon, it should presumably at least fail gracefully for Jmol.  Is this maybe a difference between parametric and implicit plotting?

Thus this should work right if the commands generated to load the pmesh are correct.  The issue is with the .jmol script file being generated.

Does this one works for you in jmol ? It works for me !

```
sage: t = (1-sin(2*x*y+3*z)**2).function(x,y,z)
sage: cm = colormaps.autumn
sage: G = ImplicitSurface(x^2 + y^2 + z^2, (x,-2, 2), (y,-2, 2), (z,-2, 2), contour=4, color=(t,cm))
sage: G.show()
```

But fails with `cm = colormaps.terrain`

And your example of [comment:115](#comment%3A115) works with `colormaps.YlOrBr`

So this could be a problem with color ranges.. Maybe for colors not fitting in int ?

But the "bad" colormaps work for parametric surfaces..

* Amend the doc to remove suggestions jmol doesn't work
* Add extra examples to show various viewers working (possibly not tested if they rely on the notebook like canvas3d)
* Add an example warning of a colormap that does *not* work with jmol for whatever reason.

I'll double-check all this works in the notebook next.

Interestingly, even the ones that give a 'blank' jmol from the command line give a more-or-less black object of the right shape in jsmol.  That is very interesting - one can test it by switching in the notebook from load 3d live or not.

Though also in my testing some that worked in command line turned black in notebook... strange.

This confirms my thought that for some choices of colormaps and color evaluation functions the colormaps just don't work right with jmol (too large of values or too close to zero or whatever).   For instance,

```
var('x,y,z')
t = (x+y+z).function(x,y,z)
cm = colormaps.terrain
implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2==4, (x, -3, 3), (y, -3,3), (z, -3,3), color=(t,cm))
```
works fine in jsmol and jmol, while with the sin functions you were using it does not.  I think the "blank" ones are ones where the values are too close to zero, or something like that.  Switch to

```
cm = colormaps.flag
```
and you will have a big surprise - Tachyon, jmol, and jsmol are all different!

Little progress.

The problem appears using only the pmesh files and not the script. So the problem is in the pmesh files.

1) it seems that Jmol does not like the color 0 at all. Replacing 0 by 1 enhances things a little bit. This is a symptomatic cure of only part of the problem.

2) but the example of [comment:115](#comment%3A115) still does not work

I suspect that there could be some problem inside Jmol about the treatment of colored pmesh. It may be difficult to investigate without close contact with the Jmol team.

Here is a new simple testing case

```
var('x,y,z')
t = z.function(x,y,z)
cm = colormaps.flag
P = implicit_plot3d(z-x*x-y*y,(x,-2,2),(y,-2,2),(z,-1,4),color=(t,cm))
```
Was not working with Jmol
Now works correctly with Jmol
Produces spectacular unexpected special effects with Jsmol

Well, I guess.  My feeling is that the warning and the fact that not too many colormaps are bad is okay.  Though I think it does need a bit more testing in the jsmol, which seems to be the most annoying.  If I'm lucky I can even make a list of "bad" colormaps.

It's pretty clear they are in jmol somewhere, since the other viewers work very nicely.

Sorry, the warning needs to be in `parametric_surface.pyx` too, and changed since jmol is sort of working.

In that file, you say
> Note that the coloring function should have values between 0 and 1. This value is passed to the chosen colormap.

Is that maybe the problem we are having?  What happens with values outside that - is it done 'modulo 1' or something else?

In implicit_plot I would put the examples of this in the example section, maybe after the `smooth=True` example.

In parametric plot 3d the examples need to be dealt with anyway, and the indentation is not right when you view it.

```
    EXAMPLES: We demonstrate each of the four ways to call this
    function.


    #. A space curve defined by three functions of 1 variable:

       ::

           sage: parametric_plot3d( (sin, cos, lambda u: u/10), (0, 20))
           Graphics3d Object

       Note above the lambda function, which creates a callable Python
       function that sends `u` to `u/10`.

    #. Next we draw the same plot as above, but using symbolic
       functions:

       ::

           sage: u = var('u')
           sage: parametric_plot3d( (sin(u), cos(u), u/10), (u, 0, 20))
           Graphics3d Object

    #. We draw a parametric surface using 3 Python functions (defined
       using lambda):

       ::

           sage: f = (lambda u,v: cos(u), lambda u,v: sin(u)+cos(v), lambda u,v: sin(v))
           sage: parametric_plot3d(f, (0, 2*pi), (-pi, pi))
           Graphics3d Object

```
up to here is fine, but 

```
    #. The surface, but with a mesh:

       ::

           sage: u, v = var('u,v')
           sage: parametric_plot3d((cos(u), sin(u) + cos(v), sin(v)), (u, 0, 2*pi), (v, -pi, pi), mesh=True)
           Graphics3d Object
```
should just be an example later.  This one is the true "fourth way to call the function".

```

    #. The same surface, but where the defining functions are
       symbolic:

       ::

           sage: u, v = var('u,v')
           sage: parametric_plot3d((cos(u), sin(u) + cos(v), sin(v)), (u, 0, 2*pi), (v, -pi, pi))
           Graphics3d Object
```
Everything after that is indented too far, up until

```
    We call the space curve function but with polynomials instead of
    symbolic variables.
```
including all the added examples.

I have done the following:

- take a failing example of pmesh file

- replace all the colors by a fixed one using a text editor

and then it worked.

I think that our color numbers are valid (between 0 and `2**24`)

So it seems that the import process of jmol is broken somewhere. I have contacted upstream on the subject.

Try this.

```

t = sin(z).function(x,y,z)
@interact
def _(cm = [colormaps[c] for c in colormaps],v = ['jmol','tachyon']):
    show(implicit_plot3d(z-x*x-y*y,(x,-2,2),(y,-2,2),(z,-1,4),color=(t,cm),viewer=v))
```
(Could be slow.)

I don't know if I like having a switch to 1, though, as most of the colormaps seem to mostly care about 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 as color values.   (Switch the function about to `z` instead of `sin(z)` to see this.)  That could be a somewhat bizarre change.  What if you switched it from 0 to 0.01 or something like that?

For instance,

```
var('x,y,z')
t = SR(0).function(x,y,z)
implicit_plot3d(z-x*x-y*y,(x,-2,2),(y,-2,2),(z,-1,4),color=(t,colormaps.terrain)) # or flag or whatever
```
this seems to work fine.  Changing to `SR(1)` gives quite a different color!  So I would recommend not putting in that bit where you check for the `0` color - especially since the other viewers work fine!  No need to mess them up.

Anyway, as far as I'm concerned the fault here clearly lies with jmol or jsmol, and is not so horrible as to keep us from putting this in.

A branch to use that version of jmol is available under the name `public/12212-experimental`

It seems inded to solve our problems. This probably needs more testing. Upstream is waiting for our feedback. One can hope that this will get into a stable release.

A **stable jmol** is available here

​​http://chapoton.perso.math.cnrs.fr/jmol-14.2.11_2015.01.20.tar.bz2

As far as I can tell, this works very well.

This seems to be ready to go ! I will now update the branch here.

Interestingly, looking at the very initial example,

```
sage: cmsel = [colormaps['autumn'](i) for i in sxrange(0,1,0.05)]
sage: var('x,y,z')
sage: implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2==4, (x, -3, 3), (y, -3,3), (z, -3,3), color=cmsel)
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
```
still happens, since we need a tuple or something.  But weirdly, this is the only way to get colormaps to work with `plot3d` itself!  (As opposed to doing a "trivial" parametric plot.)

So... are we saying that we now have colormaps, after a Herculean effort, for implicit and parametric plots, but not for "regular" plots?  There is nothing in http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.html that would suggest we do.

Needless to say, I am *not* holding this up for that, but I have also to say that the complete lack of documentation (William's comment in [Niles original question speaks to this](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/7581/use-a-colormap-for-implicit_plot3d/)) for the `plot3d` side definitely requires another ticket, and hopefully even the same syntax could work, despite what I now agree with Niles is definitely messed-up internals on such things.
