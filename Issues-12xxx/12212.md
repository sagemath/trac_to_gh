Keywords: colormap, plot

Colormaps work for `plot3d`, but not for `implicit_plot3d` or `parametric_plot3d`.  

Compare the following:

```
sage: var('r v')
sage: cmsel = [colormaps['autumn'](i) for i in sxrange(0,1,0.05)]
sage: p = plot3d(0.2*(r**2 + v**2) + cos(2*r)*sin(2*v),(r,-2,2), (v,-2,2), adaptive=True, color=cmsel, plot_points=10, opacity=0.9)
sage: p2 = sphere((0,0,0),1,color='black',opacity=0.5)
sage: (p+p2).show(aspect_ratio=(1,1,1), figsize=[7,3])
```


```
sage: cmsel = [colormaps['autumn'](i) for i in sxrange(0,1,0.05)]
sage: var('x,y,z')
sage: implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2==4, (x, -3, 3), (y, -3,3), (z, -3,3), color=cmsel)
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (49, 0))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

```

I've played with this a little bit now, and it seems reasonably fast in my simple tests.

I realized that using an arbitrary scalar function (e.g. curvature) for the colormap only works for implicit surfaces, not parametrized surfaces.  If I understand correctly, this is a fundamental limitation of this approach, because it applies colors only *after* the surface is constructed and therefore only has access to coordinates in 3-space, not the parametrization that was used to produce them.

Hello,

I have worked hard, and managed to modify the class IndexFaceSet, so that it can handle colored faces (one face per color). One can now give one more parameter to IndexFaceSet, which is a texture list. This is only preliminary, as this new behaviour can only be viewed with tachyon, and from the texture only the color is used.

Is there somebody familiar with jmol syntax and wanting to help ?

After reading the doc of jmol here

http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs/#isosurfacesurfaceobject--surfacedata-derivedisosurfaces

I am rather pessimistic about achieving to transmit colored surfaces to jmol. Currently, we send `pmesh` files to jmol. Using this format, there seems to be no way to give a color to every face (other than horrible splitting : one `pmesh` file for every color). 

One other possibility would be to use `obj` files instead.

To do this, one would need to group faces according to their colors, which would take some work to code.

This same work would probably also be necessary just to make sure that the `obj` file output works correctly for colored surfaces.

I have not yet understood if the `json` format allows to deal eeasily with colored surfaces.

This is fantastic!!  I'm excited to try it out :)

Thanks for all the work here -- I've been testing it too and I'm really impressed with the progress!  Here are some things that I think still need to be addressed:

* I think there need to be some more doctests that verify the coloring of triangles is working.  At the moment, if some bug stopped colors from being applied to triangles, I think most of the doctests would still pass.  Maybe at least you could add tests in `IndexFaceSet` for `tachyon_repr`, `obj`, and `x3d_geometry` similar to the one for `json_repr`.

* Was `IndexFaceSet.dual` broken before this patch?  Is there another ticket open for it?

* The argument `texture_list` for `IndexFaceSet.__init__` displaces the argument `enclosed`, which technically means that the new behavior is not backwards-compatible.  I'm sorry to bring this up, because I think it's a really annoying detail, but I think Sage policy is that there should be a deprecation period in case someone somewhere is using `S = IndexFaceSet(face_list, point_list, False)`.  One thing would be to add a check `if type(texture_list) is bool:..." which issues a deprecation warning and fixes the arguments.  Or, maybe better, put the texture argument after the enclosure one, and always use it as a keyword.

* Since colormaps don't work with jmol, I think the demonstrations in parametric_plot3d and elsewhere should specifiy a viewer where they do work.  For example:

```
sage: u,v = var('u,v')
sage: col = rainbow(10, 'rgbtuple')
sage: def cf(u,v): return sin(u^2 + v^2)**2
sage: parametric_plot3d((u, u+v, v), (u, -3,3), (v, -3, 3), colordata=(cf, colormaps.PiYG), viewer='tachyon')
```

* Why do this example and some others look so bad?  I think the first examples (the ones users are most likely to see) should be chosen to look really good.  If specifying a large number of plot points and marking #long or #optional is necessary, then I think that's better than fast but low-quality examples.  (Fast, low-quality examples are good for automatic testing, in parts of the documentation that new users are not likely to start with.)

* The syntax for colormaps of plotted functions (e.g. with `plot3d`) and parametric surfaces should be the same if at all possible.  Since `plot3d` calls `parametric_plot3d`, they should use the same code for colormaps.  Also check `plot3d_adaptive` to see what it's doing.

* `ImplicitSurface` is derived from `IndexFaceSet`, so it should be reasonably straightforward to get colormaps for implicit plots working too.  Is there a good way to do it without just duplicating the code from `ParametricSurface`?  There seems to already be some duplicated code between them.  Maybe there needs to be some other kind of `PlotSurface` class that contains the common code?

I'm sorry to bring this up, because I think it's a really annoying detail, but I think Sage policy is that there should be a deprecation period in case someone somewhere is using `S = IndexFaceSet(face_list, point_list, False)`.  One thing would be to add a check `if type(texture_list) is bool:..." which issues a deprecation warning and fixes the arguments.  Or, maybe better, put the texture argument after the enclosure one, and always use it as a keyword.


I have changed the order to keep "enclosed" before "texture_list"
 
> * Since colormaps don't work with jmol, I think the demonstrations in parametric_plot3d and elsewhere should specifiy a viewer where they do work.  For example:
> 
> 
> ```
> sage: u,v = var('u,v')
> sage: col = rainbow(10, 'rgbtuple')
> sage: def cf(u,v): return sin(u^2 + v^2)**2
> sage: parametric_plot3d((u, u+v, v), (u, -3,3), (v, -3, 3), colordata=(cf, colormaps.PiYG), viewer='tachyon')
> ```


I have added lines with `P.show(viewer='tachyon')` where appropriate
 
> * Why do this example and some others look so bad?  I think the first examples (the ones users are most likely to see) should be chosen to look really good.  If specifying a large number of plot points and marking #long or #optional is necessary, then I think that's better than fast but low-quality examples.  (Fast, low-quality examples are good for automatic testing, in parts of the documentation that new users are not likely to start with.)


I have tried to enhance the quality of examples
 
> * The syntax for colormaps of plotted functions (e.g. with `plot3d`) and parametric surfaces should be the same if at all possible.  Since `plot3d` calls `parametric_plot3d`, they should use the same code for colormaps.  Also check `plot3d_adaptive` to see what it's doing.


This is a difficult point. Achieving coeherence would be great, but I do not think that I am able to do that. For another ticket ?

> * In `parametric_plot3d`, wouldn't it be more consistent to use `color_data` for the argument name, rather than `colordata`?  I know `colormap` is an established argument name (coming from matplot lib, I think), but I think it's better to use Sage's convention if possible.


I have switched to color_data
 
> * `ImplicitSurface` is derived from `IndexFaceSet`, so it should be reasonably straightforward to get colormaps for implicit plots working too.  Is there a good way to do it without just duplicating the code from `ParametricSurface`?  There seems to already be some duplicated code between them.  Maybe there needs to be some other kind of `PlotSurface` class that contains the common code?


This is not as straightforward as it may look. It would be great to do that, but the code for implicit plot is very sophisticated, and it is not easy to see where to put the color assignment of faces.

PLUS:

I have reformatted texture_map so that the use of colormaps is simpler.

Niles, is this easy for you to implement?  I don't want to have this held up unduly, though you are right that the interface should be consistent for colors.

Let me see what I see as the status here:

Replying to [comment:59 kcrisman]:
> Thanks, Niles.  I didn't realize there was anything backwards-incompatible here, just additional keywords, 


I think I was unclear -- sorry.  As I understand it, the code here isn't backward incompatible.  What I meant is that the uniform interface I envision probably isn't compatible with the current interface.  So the idea to release now, fix later (which I generally support!) would mean that we can't "fix" until after a year of deprecation.  

And I think this is about more than interface -- I think the code may have to be reorganized, with some methods moved to different classes, and there would need to be deprecation for that as well.  

I'm really frustrated about this too -- I'd hate to see this rot for another 3 years -- but I just can't convince myself it's good to release this as is.  Do you disagree?

Sorry, but I really do not see what I could do to improve things here.

The Texture class is there to handle a single texture. It makes no sense to feed it with a colormap. So it is not possible to use the color keyword for a colormap, because the color keyword is handled by the Texture class.

I really think that the `global_texture` dichotomy makes sense, as it is not at all the same thing to use a single Texture or one Texture for every vertex.

Maybe one could make something like a class `TextureValuedFunction`, but this seems a bit heavy to me.

I would like to put this ticket back to `needs review`.

}
```

I've thought more about this now.  First, here are some observations:



* `plot3d_adaptive`, `TrianglePlot`, and the rest of tri_plot.py
   - This code is disjoint from the rest of the plotting code and needs
    to be integrated at some point in the future.
   - Makes use of `IndexFaceSet.partition`, but that method isn't used
     anywhere else, except now in `GradualTextureTransform`


* Each face in an `IndexFaceSet` has a color attribute, but no other
  texture attributes (namely opacity, but also ambient, diffuse,
  specular)
  - The color_data argument, as it currently stands, directly sets
    this color attribute for each face as its constructed in
    `ParametricSurface.triangulate` or `ImplicitSurface.triangulate`
  - The two different triangulation methods differ substantially, and
    therefore probably shouldn't be unified
  - This approach (adding data to triangles) can only set color
    values, not other texture values, unless `IndexFaceSet` is expanded
  - I believe this is also connected to the problem of viewing with jmol, but I'm not completely sure.
  - Surfaces constructed with `plot3d_adaptive` are triangulated with a different codebase (tri_plot.py) and then converted to `IndexFaceSet` objects.

* `IndexFaceSet` is a subclass of `PrimitiveObject` (as in graphics
  primitive), and hence has support for arbitrary texture information
  via `PrimitiveObject.set_texture`.
  - This sets the same texture information for *all* faces in a given
    `IndexFaceSet` instance.
  - The code in `plot3d_adaptive`, and hence also in
    `GradualTextureTransform` which copies it, makes a different
    instance of `IndexFaceSet` for each texture (e.g. color).  These are
    combined in a `Graphics3dGroup`.
  - Grouping triangles by texture makes some sense because often
    there will be many triangles with the same texture.
  - `plot3d_adaptive` and `GradualTextureTransform` use the method
    `IndexFaceSet.partition` to partition triangles according to the
    values of a scalar function.  In both cases this is done after a
    single `IndexFaceSet` has been constructed.

* The `color_data` approach (setting attributes of individual faces as
  they're constructed) is faster than the `GradualTextureTransform`
  approach by nearly a factor of 2 (or 1/2; see timings below).
  - This makes sense, given that `GradualTextureTransform` has to
    construct the triangulation first and then partition it.
  - The `color_data` approach might be more memory-intensive, but I
    don't know how to measure this.


---

It could be possible to combine these two approaches:

* Partition triangles according to texture and hence take advantage of
  the more robust support for textures in the graphics classes.

* Construct this partition during the triangulation process, rather
  than after the fact.

Before I start working on this, please let me know if you have suggestions or concerns about this idea.

Thanks!

Oops, forgot the timing stuff.

First, general setup:

```
# setup
var('r v')
cmsel = [colormaps['autumn'](i) for i in sxrange(0,1,0.05)]
f(r,v) = 0.2*(r**2 + v**2) + cos(2*r)*sin(2*v)

from sage.plot.plot3d.texture_map import ColormapTransform
CMT = ColormapTransform(colormaps.autumn, 'height_z')

clebsch(x,y,z) = 81*(x^3+y^3+z^3)-189*(x^2*y+x^2*z+y^2*x+y^2*z+z^2*x+z^2*y) +54*x*y*z+126*(x*y+x*z+y*z)-9*(x^2+y^2+z^2)-9*(x+y+z)+1
def R(x,y,z): return z

```

Now compare no colormap, colormap with plot3d_adaptive, the color_data approach, and the `GradualTextureTransform` approach:

```
sage: # base
sage: %time q = plot3d(f,(r,-2,2), (v,-2,2))
CPU times: user 1.91 ms, sys: 75 µs, total: 1.98 ms
Wall time: 1.93 ms

sage: # with adaptive
sage: %time p = plot3d(f,(r,-2,2), (v,-2,2), adaptive=True, color=cmsel)
CPU times: user 29.2 ms, sys: 6.52 ms, total: 35.7 ms
Wall time: 31 ms

sage: # with color_data
sage: % time s = parametric_plot3d((r,v,f),(r,-2,2), (v,-2,2), color_data=(cf,colormaps.PiYG))
CPU times: user 1.89 ms, sys: 74 µs, total: 1.96 ms
Wall time: 1.92 ms

sage: # with GTT
sage: %time t = CMT.apply(parametric_plot3d((r,v,f),(r,-2,2), (v,-2,2)))
CPU times: user 4.55 ms, sys: 911 µs, total: 5.46 ms
Wall time: 4.84 ms

sage: %time t = CMT.apply(s)
CPU times: user 2.29 ms, sys: 724 µs, total: 3.01 ms
Wall time: 2.67 ms

```


An example that takes longer to plot, to see how adding colormap affects the time:

```

sage: %time k = implicit_plot3d(clebsch, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2), (z,-2,2))
CPU times: user 6.71 ms, sys: 292 µs, total: 7 ms
Wall time: 6.88 ms

sage: %time m = implicit_plot3d(clebsch, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2), (z,-2,2), color_data=(R,cm))
CPU times: user 7.89 ms, sys: 371 µs, total: 8.26 ms
Wall time: 7.98 ms

sage: %time j = CMT.apply(k)
CPU times: user 12.5 ms, sys: 2.86 ms, total: 15.3 ms
Wall time: 13.2 ms
```

Well, I've been thinking about this approach, and the fact that it would produce a different `IndexFaceSet` for every texture value.  If only one texture parameter were to vary (e.g. color), then maybe the number of different objects would be manageable (around 20 different colors looks ok and is fast).  But varying two or more attributes quickly puts the number of objects into the hundreds, and that's too many (too slow).  Moreover, partitioning in this way looses the global structure of the object (this is used, e.g. in the triangulation code for `ParametricSurface` to see whether the surface is enclosed or not).

I also think it's worth noting the way tachyon handles textures, since presumably its author is more experienced than we are with these kinds of issues.  Tachyon has a list of textures, and each object has a pointer to the texture which should be applied to it.  I believe other rendering software works this way too  (see `Graphics3d.texture_set` and `Graphics3dGroup.texture_set`).  This is similar to the way `IndexFaceSet` handles faces (storing pointers to vertices, rather than the vertices themselves).

So maybe the ideal way forward would be to have each face of an `IndexFaceSet` have a pointer to a texture with the relevant color, opacity, etc.  But it would be wasteful to do this by adding a new texture for every single face.


Anyway, now I've spent a nontrivial number of hours thinking about this, and I don't see an easy way forward.  I'm just generally unhappy with the way textures are handled in the 3d plotting code, and that's not an issue for this ticket.

I have corrected one failing doctest related to Mobius band.

I am happy with the solution of using `color` instead of `color_data`.

I do not have a strong opinion about keeping or not the `texture_map` file. Maybe I would prefer to keep it, as it is the only way to get a transparency effect so far. But this should not stop the progress here. So either way is ok for me.

I think that we still do not ship a recent enough version of jmol that could accept the color information. Is this true ?

It would be good to have #7744 at our disposal in order to be able to save x3d files properly.

p.s.  If someone else wants to try upgrading jmol, there's a little more to it than what Karl said, but not much.  You have to make the tarball in the right way, and this is described in `build/pkgs/jmol/SPKGS.txt`.  You also have to update the version number in `build/pkgs/jmol/package-version.txt`.

which should in fact already **be** in the version Niles made!  Maybe the interface is not as obvious?  At any rate, that should definitely be in 14.2.9, according to this.  It must be around commit r19940 (see the [browser](https://sourceforge.net/p/jmol/code/commit_browser)) but I can't find it.

It also occurs to me that if jmol ended up working, we would need to amend this branch anyway, because there are several references to how jmol does *not* work!  If we can resolve it within a week I say let's do so, otherwise I think it's better to have this in with the various warnings against using jmol BUT working hard at resolving that, since most people would be using that.

Okay, jmol does indeed 'work' (though without the colormap) in command line and notebook, though the Tachyon pic is the static piece in the notebook, I think. 

```
sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface import ParametricSurface
sage: cm = colormaps.autumn
sage: def c(x,y): return sin(x*y)**2
sage: def g(x,y): return x, y, x**2 + y**2
sage: P1 = ParametricSurface(g, (srange(-10,10,0.1), srange(-5,5.0,0.1)),color=(c,cm))
sage: P1.show() 
```
However,

```
sage: sage: var('x,y,z')
(x, y, z)
sage: t = (sin(2*y+3*z)**2).function(x,y,z)
sage: cm = colormaps.gist_rainbow
sage: sage: implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2==4, (x, -3, 3), (y, -3,3), (z, -3,3), color=(t,cm))
```
doesn't.  Given that this is supposed to work with Tachyon, it should presumably at least fail gracefully for Jmol.  Is this maybe a difference between parametric and implicit plotting?

I got essentially what is shown in comment 51 (it may be inside out) from `nice_shell-obj_1.pmesh`.  I just did a simple pmesh "path_to_file" command in the Jmol 14.2.7 console to get this. I verified that it also works with JSmol-14.2.7 inside of sage by uploading the pmesh as a data file and then issuing the command `pmesh "/home/<user_name>/<worksheet_number>/data/nice_shell-obj_1.pmesh"` in the console of a running JSmol.  I also had to issue a `pmesh fullylit` command after the load to get the outside of the shell bright.

Thus this should work right if the commands generated to load the pmesh are correct.  The issue is with the .jmol script file being generated.

sage: t = (1-sin(2*x*y+3*z)**2).function(x,y,z)

But fails with `cm = colormaps.terrain`

And your example of comment:115 works with `colormaps.YlOrBr`

So this could be a problem with color ranges.. Maybe for colors not fitting in int ?

But the "bad" colormaps work for parametric surfaces..

This confirms my thought that for some choices of colormaps and color evaluation functions the colormaps just don't work right with jmol (too large of values or too close to zero or whatever).   For instance,

```
var('x,y,z')
t = (x+y+z).function(x,y,z)
cm = colormaps.terrain
implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2==4, (x, -3, 3), (y, -3,3), (z, -3,3), color=(t,cm))
```
works fine in jsmol and jmol, while with the sin functions you were using it does not.  I think the "blank" ones are ones where the values are too close to zero, or something like that.  Switch to

```
cm = colormaps.flag
```
and you will have a big surprise - Tachyon, jmol, and jsmol are all different!

Little progress.

The problem appears using only the pmesh files and not the script. So the problem is in the pmesh files.

1) it seems that Jmol does not like the color 0 at all. Replacing 0 by 1 enhances things a little bit. This is a symptomatic cure of only part of the problem.

2) but the example of comment:115 still does not work

I suspect that there could be some problem inside Jmol about the treatment of colored pmesh. It may be difficult to investigate without close contact with the Jmol team.

Here is a new simple testing case

```
var('x,y,z')
t = z.function(x,y,z)
cm = colormaps.flag
P = implicit_plot3d(z-x*x-y*y,(x,-2,2),(y,-2,2),(z,-1,4),color=(t,cm))
```
Was not working with Jmol
Now works correctly with Jmol
Produces spectacular unexpected special effects with Jsmol

Sorry, the warning needs to be in `parametric_surface.pyx` too, and changed since jmol is sort of working.

In that file, you say
> Note that the coloring function should have values between 0 and 1. This value is passed to the chosen colormap.

Is that maybe the problem we are having?  What happens with values outside that - is it done 'modulo 1' or something else?

In implicit_plot I would put the examples of this in the example section, maybe after the `smooth=True` example.

In parametric plot 3d the examples need to be dealt with anyway, and the indentation is not right when you view it.

```
    EXAMPLES: We demonstrate each of the four ways to call this
    function.


    #. A space curve defined by three functions of 1 variable:

       ::

           sage: parametric_plot3d( (sin, cos, lambda u: u/10), (0, 20))
           Graphics3d Object

       Note above the lambda function, which creates a callable Python
       function that sends `u` to `u/10`.

    #. Next we draw the same plot as above, but using symbolic
       functions:

       ::

           sage: u = var('u')
           sage: parametric_plot3d( (sin(u), cos(u), u/10), (u, 0, 20))
           Graphics3d Object

    #. We draw a parametric surface using 3 Python functions (defined
       using lambda):

       ::

           sage: f = (lambda u,v: cos(u), lambda u,v: sin(u)+cos(v), lambda u,v: sin(v))
           sage: parametric_plot3d(f, (0, 2*pi), (-pi, pi))
           Graphics3d Object

```
up to here is fine, but 

```
    #. The surface, but with a mesh:

       ::

           sage: u, v = var('u,v')
           sage: parametric_plot3d((cos(u), sin(u) + cos(v), sin(v)), (u, 0, 2*pi), (v, -pi, pi), mesh=True)
           Graphics3d Object
```
should just be an example later.  This one is the true "fourth way to call the function".

```

    #. The same surface, but where the defining functions are
       symbolic:

       ::

           sage: u, v = var('u,v')
           sage: parametric_plot3d((cos(u), sin(u) + cos(v), sin(v)), (u, 0, 2*pi), (v, -pi, pi))
           Graphics3d Object
```
Everything after that is indented too far, up until

```
    We call the space curve function but with polynomials instead of
    symbolic variables.
```
including all the added examples.

I have done the following:

- take a failing example of pmesh file

- replace all the colors by a fixed one using a text editor

and then it worked.

I think that our color numbers are valid (between 0 and `2**24`)

So it seems that the import process of jmol is broken somewhere. I have contacted upstream on the subject.

Try this.

```
var('x,y,z')
t = sin(z).function(x,y,z)
@interact
def _(cm = [colormaps[c] for c in colormaps],v = ['jmol','tachyon']):
    show(implicit_plot3d(z-x*x-y*y,(x,-2,2),(y,-2,2),(z,-1,4),color=(t,cm),viewer=v))
```
(Could be slow.)

I don't know if I like having a switch to 1, though, as most of the colormaps seem to mostly care about 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 as color values.   (Switch the function about to `z` instead of `sin(z)` to see this.)  That could be a somewhat bizarre change.  What if you switched it from 0 to 0.01 or something like that?

For instance,

```
var('x,y,z')
t = SR(0).function(x,y,z)
implicit_plot3d(z-x*x-y*y,(x,-2,2),(y,-2,2),(z,-1,4),color=(t,colormaps.terrain)) # or flag or whatever
```
this seems to work fine.  Changing to `SR(1)` gives quite a different color!  So I would recommend not putting in that bit where you check for the `0` color - especially since the other viewers work fine!  No need to mess them up.

Anyway, as far as I'm concerned the fault here clearly lies with jmol or jsmol, and is not so horrible as to keep us from putting this in.

One can also not that the colors do not look quite the same between the viewers. Maybe a difference in global lighting ?\n\nConcerning setting the color 0 to 1 : it happens inside a jmol specific function, and after the color has been turned into an integer between `0` and `2**24`. So changing 0 to 1 here does not affect at all the other viewers, and should only change total black into almost total black, so should not have any visible effect on jmol output (except making it work slightly more often).\n\nI am also not quite satisfied with this buggy behaviour, but something is better than nothing.

Thanks for the interactive. Here is a slightly modified version, with canvas3D and colormap names

```
var('x,y,z')
t = sin(z).function(x,y,z)
@interact
def _(cm=[colormaps[c].name for c in colormaps], v=['jmol', 'tachyon', 'canvas3d']):
     show(implicit_plot3d(z-x*x-y*y,(x,-2,2),(y,-2,2),(z,-1,4),color=(t,colormaps[cm]),viewer=v))
```
One can note the canvas3d does not have the same viewpoint. One can also not that the colors do not look quite the same between the viewers. Maybe a difference in global lighting ?

Concerning setting the color 0 to 1 : it happens inside a jmol specific function, and after the color has been turned into an integer between `0` and `2**24`. So changing 0 to 1 here does not affect at all the other viewers, and should only change total black into almost total black, so should not have any visible effect on jmol output (except making it work slightly more often).

I am also not quite satisfied with this buggy behaviour, but something is better than nothing. Nevertheless it could still be that the problem is in our dialog with jmol and not in jmol itself : are we coding the colors correctly ? I thought so, but maybe this needs to be checked. I have tried to navigate the jmol code, but did not manage to find something useful about color encoding.
