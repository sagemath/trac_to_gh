Maybe it is best to maintain the status quo, and not make any changes after all.

If we try to parse the latex log file and try to find out if a second or third run is needed then this parsing itself will take some time (disc access, search within file almost till the end for phrase like "rerun to get crossreferenc.", etc). This will defeat the purpose of saving server load by reducing unnecessary latex runs.

I don't care.

It is choice between compiling more than once (easy fix) and changing the latex build system (big change).

Feel free to close the ticket.
