1. The `detach` method is only able to detach filenames with absolute paths whereas `attach` is able to take in relative paths

2. Secondly, the `detach` method could be made to accept lists so that all the attached files can be removed in one invocation:

```
detach(attached_files())
```

* It says `"To see a list of attached files, call attached_files()"`. Technically, `attached_files()` *is* a list, so it doesn't make any sense to call it.  It would be technically correct  to write "To see a list of attached files, call the attached_files function" or "To see a list of attached files, type attached_files()."

* This violates Python idioms:

```
    if type(filename) in [list, tuple]:
```
It should be `if isinstance(filename, (list, tuple))`.

* Instead, you could do:

```
if isinstance(filename, basestring):
    filelist = [filename]
else:
    filelist = [str(x) for x in filename]
```
which would (a) work on any iterable (e.g., a generator expression), and (b) ensure that each entry in filelist is a string.

I think this should be orthogonal to the IPython upgrade, but we'll see.

Hi,

Sorry to nitpick again, but can you add a test that illustrates the error case, e.g., 

```
   sage: detach('nonexistent_file.sage')
   ... error
```

With that, we should be good to go!
