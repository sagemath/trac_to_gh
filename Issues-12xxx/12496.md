<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
This is my first time submitting a patch: feedback welcome!

Added 8 doctests, out of 10 that were missing. The 2 still missing are:

* `__cinit__(self)`
* `__richcmp__(left, right, int op)`

I have no idea what `__cinit__` and `__richcmp__` do, when/how they are called, ... and how to write any relevant doctest for them.

The command `sage -coverage` returns 2 missing docs and 5 possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests).

Hi!

I am also pretty new to contributing to Sage, and to reviewing.  So I have some comments, but they might not all really need to be dealt with.  I guess the things that confused me might confuse other people as well, but there's no reason for a non-expert to be looking at some of these things, so maybe it's not really a problem.  On the other hand, probably no one will get around to touching this documentation again for a long time, so it makes sense to try to make it as good as possible now.  

There are some methods which I couldn't figure out what they were supposed to do (mathematically speaking): degree, absolute_degree, parameter.

There are some methods for which it would be useful (I think) to explain more clearly what the arguments are.  
* gen: what is n?
* completion what is prec?  (well, I figured out it was precision)
* crt_basis: what does the xgcd parameter do?  
* !__getitem!__: what is x?
* _is_valid_homomorphism_: what are the arguments?
* extension: what are the arguments?

There are a few places where I wanted to change the wording:
* "to a void" (in cdef void): I think this should be "to avoid"
* "The default distribution is on average 50% `\pm 1`" (in random_element):  I'm not sure what this means.  If it means "is either 1 or -1 50% of the time on average" then it contradicts the discussion above, which says each of 1, 0, -1 occurs 20% of the time.  Also, maybe it would be good to include some link to where the reader could find out about the available distributions.
* "Return the order in the number field defined by poly generated (as a ring) by a root of poly." (in extension) I had trouble making sense of this.  I think something like "Given a polynomial as input, return the order generated by a root of the polynomial in the number field defined by the polynomial." would be clearer.  

_randomize_mpz could do with more detailed documentation (I think).

`_cmp_` could also do with more documentation -- I couldn't figure out what it was doing.

I am still perplexed about `_cmp_` is doing.  

It is clear that parameter() is returning 1, but I don't understand what it means.

<a id='comment:8'>**Comment 8:**</a>
A lot of functions are missing their input/output blocks, which should be added if we're trying to improve the documentation.  The functions `random_element` and `completion` especially have input specifications but aren't in the right form.

The conventions for documentation strings are [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings).  If you fix the two functions I mentioned (and feel free to fix more than that :) ) I'll give the ticket a positive review.
