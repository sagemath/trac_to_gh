Hello,

There is a problem with polybori in sage-5.0.beta11. It crashes with the following error message:

```

TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing
```


The error can be consistently created with the following sage code:


```
# problem, if only a part of the variables appears in the problem

# slightly too large ring
pR.<s0s0, s0s1, s0s2, s0s3, s0s4, s0s5, s0s6, s0s7, s1s0, s1s1, s1s2, s1s3, s1s4, s1s5, s1s6, s1s7, s2s0, s2s1, s2s2, s2s3, s3s0, s3s1, s3s2, s3s3> = BooleanPolynomialRing()

# a problem instance
problem = [s1s0*s1s1, s0s0*s0s1 + s0s0 + s0s1 + s2s0 + s3s0*s3s1 + s3s0 + s3s1, s1s1 + s2s0 + s3s0 + s3s1 + 1, s0s0*s0s1 + s1s1 + s3s0*s3s1 + s3s0, s0s1 + s1s0 + s1s1 + s3s0, s0s0*s0s1 + s0s0 + s0s1 + s1s1 + s2s0 + s3s1, s0s1 + s1s0, s0s0*s0s1 + s0s0 + s0s1 + s1s0 + s2s0 + s3s1, s0s0 + s2s0 + s3s0*s3s1 + s3s0 + 1, s0s0 + s1s1]

# try to solve via Groebner
I = ideal(problem)
B = I.groebner_basis() # crashes exactly here
print B
```


I guess it's a problem when converting the result back from polybori to Sage.

I use sage 5.0-beta11 on a 64 bit machine, namely
* AMD Opteron(TM) Processor 6276 @ 2.3 GHz
* Linux 2.6.32-220.2.1.el6.x86_64
sage 5.0 was built directly from the sources.

Best,
Christopher
