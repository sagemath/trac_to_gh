Hello,

There is a problem with polybori in sage-5.0.beta11. It crashes with the following error message:

```


The error can be consistently created with the following sage code:


```
# problem, if only a part of the variables appears in the problem

# slightly too large ring
pR.<s0s0, s0s1, s0s2, s0s3, s0s4, s0s5, s0s6, s0s7, s1s0, s1s1, s1s2, s1s3, s1s4, s1s5, s1s6, s1s7, s2s0, s2s1, s2s2, s2s3, s3s0, s3s1, s3s2, s3s3> = BooleanPolynomialRing()

# a problem instance
problem = [s1s0*s1s1, s0s0*s0s1 + s0s0 + s0s1 + s2s0 + s3s0*s3s1 + s3s0 + s3s1, s1s1 + s2s0 + s3s0 + s3s1 + 1, s0s0*s0s1 + s1s1 + s3s0*s3s1 + s3s0, s0s1 + s1s0 + s1s1 + s3s0, s0s0*s0s1 + s0s0 + s0s1 + s1s1 + s2s0 + s3s1, s0s1 + s1s0, s0s0*s0s1 + s0s0 + s0s1 + s1s0 + s2s0 + s3s1, s0s0 + s2s0 + s3s0*s3s1 + s3s0 + 1, s0s0 + s1s1]

# try to solve via Groebner
I = ideal(problem)
B = I.groebner_basis() # crashes exactly here
print B
```


I guess it's a problem when converting the result back from polybori to Sage.

I use sage 5.0-beta11 on a 64 bit machine, namely
* AMD Opteron(TM) Processor 6276 @ 2.3 GHz
* Linux 2.6.32-220.2.1.el6.x86_64
sage 5.0 was built directly from the sources.

Best,
Christopher

well, it's quite mysterious where the set came from in the crashing...
I looked at the code, and it uses sets with much caution.

By the way, for most PolyBoRi code, you can use an immense number of extra variables and
it will not affect performance too much.
