<div id="comment:0"></div>

The central assumptions for any hash function is: If two objects are equal then they must have the same hash. That assumption is violated for matrix spaces:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 10)
sage: N = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 10,sparse=True)
sage: N
Full MatrixSpace of 10 by 10 sparse matrices over Integer Ring
sage: M
Full MatrixSpace of 10 by 10 dense matrices over Integer Ring
sage: M == N
True
sage: hash(M)==hash(N)
False
```

That has to be fixed. Moreover, the hash of matrix spaces is rather sluggish and should thus be improved speed-wise:

```
sage: %timeit hash(M)
625 loops, best of 3: 13.8 µs per loop
```

The root of both evils is the generic `__hash__` method inherited from `SageObject`:

```
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.__repr__())
```

Attachment: **[trac12290_matrixspace_hash.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12290/trac12290_matrixspace_hash.patch.gz)**

With my patch, the `__hash__` method returns the hash of the same data that are used for comparison of matrix spaces. Hence, we have the new doc test

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 10)
sage: N = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 10,sparse=True)
sage: M == N
True
sage: hash(M)==hash(N)
True
```

Now about speed. If one computes the hash value over and over again by

```python
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self.base(),self.__nrows, self.__ncols))
```
then the timing is

```
sage: timeit("hash(M)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.72 µs per loop
```

If the hash value is stored in a single underscore attribute, such as

```python
    def __hash__(self):
        try:
            return self._hash
        except AttributeError:
            self._hash = h = hash((self.base(),self.__nrows, self.__ncols))
        return h
```
then one gets

```
sage: timeit("hash(M)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 801 ns per loop
```

With a double-underscore `__hash` instead of `_hash`, one has

```
sage: timeit("hash(M)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 712 ns per loop
```

With directly accessing the `__dict__` such as

```python
    def __hash__(self):
        try:
            return self.__dict__['_hash']
        except KeyError:
            self.__dict__['_hash'] = h = hash((self.base(),self.__nrows, self.__ncols))
        return h
```
one has

```
sage: timeit("hash(M)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 611 ns per loop
```
and with the patch, one has

```
sage: timeit("hash(M)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 547 ns per loop
```

How is that possible? Apparently a "try-except" block has some overhead. Hence, simply returning a lazy attribute (which is solution of my patch) is fastest. Note that it is not possible to use `@`cached_method on the `__hash__` method.

Needs review (although I still need to run full doctests)!

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

Interesting indeed.

Without the patch, one has

```
sage: M1 = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 5,6, sparse=True)
sage: M2 = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 5,6, sparse=False)
sage: M1==M2
True
sage: D = {M1:1,M2:2}
sage: len(D)
2
```
Obvious reason: M1 and M2 are equal (so then the length of D should be one, not two!), but they have different hash and are thus in different buckets of the dictionary.

With my patch, they have the same hash, and by consequence they yield the same dictionary item - and that is bad for coercion! Hence, non-unique parents strike again...

The problem could be fixed by turning matrix spaces into unique parents (which would be the straight-forward thing to do).

I just asked [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/958cb2d828daf0c5) for permission to make matrix spaces unique. Adding a dense and a sparse matrix would not be a problem for the coercion model.

I have attached a patch that follows a totally different approach: Use `UniqueRepresentation` as a base class for matrix spaces!

Advantage: One gets `__hash__`, `__cmp__` and `__reduce__` for free, and the hash is even faster than with my previous patch.

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 10)
sage: N = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 10,sparse=True)
sage: M == N
False
sage: timeit("hash(M)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 511 ns per loop
```

The price to pay (as one can see in the example): The spaces of dense versus sparse matrices are not considered equal anymore. For applications, this shouldn't matter, since the coercion model can easily deal with it. In fact, I like the new behaviour a lot better than the old behaviour!

Old:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 10)
sage: N = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 10,sparse=True)
sage: a = M.random_element()
sage: b = N.random_element()
sage: (a+b).parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 10 by 10 dense matrices over Integer Ring
sage: (b+a).parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 10 by 10 sparse matrices over Integer Ring
```
The parent of the sum depends on the order of summands!!

But with the new patch, one has

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 10)
sage: N = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 10,sparse=True)
sage: a = M.random_element()
sage: b = N.random_element()
sage: (a+b).parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 10 by 10 dense matrices over Integer Ring
sage: (b+a).parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 10 by 10 dense matrices over Integer Ring
```
independent of the summation order.

I had to change some existing doctests in a trivial way, and then the whole test suite passes. Ready for review!

This looks good, and I have doctests running on it as I write; but can you tell us what's going on with the new doctest at line 334 of `matrix_integer_2x2`?
