This is taken from the google notebook bug report page.

```
sage: limit(tanh(x),x=0)            
x
```
On the other hand, this works

```
sage: limit(tanh(x),x=0,taylor=True)            
0
```
It is a bug in Maxima, and is still present in sage-5.0beta8. This beta apparently has maxima-5.26, the latest released version of Maxima.

---

Update: It has been fixed upstream. It is in maxima-5.27

Usually they do in fact add tests for bug fixes.  Nonetheless, Sage has a long history of adding redundancy.  For instance, if we for some reason switched to sympy or native limits, we would still want this to work.  Or if somehow Maxima *didn't* test for exactly the same thing, we would notice if a very similar version worked but this failed.

I agree. Even if the doctest is redundant, better test twice than not at all.
