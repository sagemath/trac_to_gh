This is taken from the google notebook bug report page.

```
sage: limit(tanh(x),x=0)            
x
```
On the other hand, this works

```
sage: limit(tanh(x),x=0,taylor=True)            
0
```
It is a bug in Maxima, and is still present in sage-5.0beta8. This beta apparently has maxima-5.26, the latest released version of Maxima.

---

Update: It has been fixed upstream. It is in maxima-5.27
