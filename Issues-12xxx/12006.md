Running

```
./sage -t -only-optional=magma devel/sage/sage
```
on a recent build of sage-4.7.2 where magma-2.17-13 (recent
release) is installed (skynet/eno) gives the following errors:

```
The following tests failed:


        sage -t -only-optional=magma "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx"

I've posted a new patch with it changed to 'a'

> and "optional - magma" is missing.

The test doesn't actually require magma (all it does is raise an exception), so it is not marked optional.
