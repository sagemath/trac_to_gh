Running

```
./sage -t -only-optional=magma devel/sage/sage
```
on a recent build of sage-4.7.2 where magma-2.17-13 (recent
release) is installed (skynet/eno) gives the following errors:

```
The following tests failed:


        sage -t -only-optional=magma "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx"
        sage -t -only-optional=magma "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/magma.py"

I've posted a new patch with it changed to 'a'
