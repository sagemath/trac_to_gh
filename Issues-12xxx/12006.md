> The test added to sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx is incorrect: 'c' is not defined, 


I've posted a new patch with it changed to 'a'

> and "optional - magma" is missing.


The test doesn't actually require magma (all it does is raise an exception), so it is not marked optional.
