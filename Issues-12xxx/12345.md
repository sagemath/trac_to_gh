Umm, even without this patch I get

```
sage: import sympy
sage: bool(SR(-oo) == -sympy.oo)
True
sage: bool(-oo == -sympy.oo)
True
```
Am I missing something?  How is that an indirect doctest?

That said, the integral works fine now and the tests pass.

Ah, those were merely mirroring the +oo cases.  Really they were only testing whether the negation worked; it was the integral test which was really verifying the success.  However, we can test it explicitly by adding.

```
    sage: bool((-oo)._sympy_() == -sympy.oo)
    True
```

which fails without the patch.  Modified to incorporate this.
