<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Umm, even without this patch I get

```
sage: import sympy
sage: bool(SR(-oo) == -sympy.oo)
True
sage: bool(-oo == -sympy.oo)
True
```
Am I missing something?  How is that an indirect doctest?

That said, the integral works fine now and the tests pass.

```
    sage: bool((-oo)._sympy_() == -sympy.oo)
