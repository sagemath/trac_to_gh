Keywords: round symbolic precision RR beginner, sd40.5

We have

```
sage: u = sqrt(43203735824841025516773866131535024) #add one digit
sage: floor(u)
207855083711803944
sage: round(u) # ?? smaller than floor(u)! No warning message...
207855083711803936
sage: r = round(u)
sage: ceil(u)
207855083711803945
```
Numbers with one digit less work

```
sage: t=sqrt(4320373582484102551677386613153502)
sage: floor(t)
65729548777426599
sage: round(t) #everything as expected, floor ≤ round ≤ ceil
65729548777426600
sage: ceil(t)
65729548777426600
```
The docstring/source code of the symbolic round mentions that behavior

```
Definition:     u.round(self)
Source:
    def round(self):
        """
        Round this expression to the nearest integer.

        This method evaluates an expression in ``RR`` first and rounds
        the result. This may lead to misleading results.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: t = sqrt(Integer('1'*1000)).round(); t
            3333333333333333056287287783757109595393...

         This is off by a huge margin::

            sage: (Integer('1'*1000) - t^2).ndigits()
            984
        """
        #FIXME: can we do better?
```

This was reported on [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/s-A22yzFnbY/discussion) by Lorenzo. I created a ticket here, since I didn't find one for that behavior (but maybe I missed it...).

It might be best to do something along the lines of:

```
def round(self):
    return floor(self+1/2)
```

but there's the possibility that that addition causes problems with inexact arithmetic.

Thanks Mike! This looks great.

Just by reading the code, I have one minor problem: Isn't the test `self > 0` too costly if the expression still contains variables? Maybe we should convert to `RR` first and do the comparison there, similar to the way Gonzalo handled this in #9627. This would also raise an error earlier instead of going through maxima for the comparison and waiting for floor or ceil to complain.

Maybe you could try converting to RIF first instead and then do the full test if that interval contains zero.  Checking to see if there are variables should also be really quick.  I'll put up a patch that does this.

Just before we put this to bed, I noticed a quirk involving negative numbers.  We typically truncate toward zero, like Python:

```

Python 2.7.2 (v2.7.2:8527427914a2, Jun 11 2011, 15:22:34)

>>> from fractions import Fraction
>>> int(-1)

>>> int(Fraction(-99, 100))
0
```

But our int-ing is a little more sensitive:

```

sage: int(-1)
-1
sage: int(-0.99)
0
sage: int(SR(-99/100))
0
sage: -0.99 == -99/100
True
sage: int(-99/100) # ??
-1

```
