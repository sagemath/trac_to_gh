With the attached patch we have:

```
sage: f=function('f')
sage: g=function('g')
sage: fx=diff(f(x),x).operator()
sage: fx(g(x))
D[0](f)(g(x))
sage: I=fx(g(x)).integrate(x)
sage: I
integrate(D[0](f)(g(x)), x)
```
but unfortunately:

```
sage: I.simplify()
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'integrate(at(diff(f(t0),t0,1),[t0=g(x)]),x)' in Sage
```
The problem here is in `symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string`. Maxima's syntax allows a sequence as an argument for multiple substitutions, but the string-based parser is unable to handle that.
`max_to_sr` and `sr_to_max` do the trick already, which is why "I" can be defined in the first place. `simplify` still uses the strings-based conversion, hence the problem. Any experts on the parser of maxima strings want to weigh in? In short, the maxima expression

```
at( f(x,y,z), [x=u,y=v,z=w])
```
is valid, but is currently not accepted by the string-based parser.

and `t` seemed sufficiently neutral for that.

sage: f = function('f')

The approach looks correct to me, I've just added a bunch of doctests and fixed some small issues:

* A failing doctest due to an extra space.
* The p_arg parser couldn't handle val = [x]
* Logic duplicated in `max_at_to_sage()` and `calculus.at()`

I get two deprecation warnings from my spline code, but one of them occurs on the lines that #12801 modifies, so we can fix them there.

If the review patch is OK, the original is for me.

Thanks! that was a typo that crept in.

A nice idea, but have you tested what your solution does with "val = a = 1" ? I think the result will be (val,(a,1)), which is probably not what is intended (it should be a syntax error).

I did think about a `p_list_or_expr` which peeks to the next token and dispatches to p_list, p_expr etc. Note that we have to be careful with accepting tuples. Otherwise
`f( (a,1) )` and `f( a=1 )` both get parsed to the same form.

One way to avoid that is to let p_arg parse `a=1` to `{a:1}`. I don't think Parser ever generates dicts. However, by now we're solving non-existent problems. So perhaps simply not accepting tuples in p_arg (as it is now) is the simpler solution.

>  * Logic duplicated in `max_at_to_sage()` and `calculus.at()`


Don't import `sage.calculus` into `maxima_lib`, because the reverse import is already in effect. I don't think a bit of logic duplication here is so problematic, since the input the routines in maxima_lib have to deal with is much better controlled than the other ones. `maxima_lib` has the potential for much better optimizations. So perhaps leaving it as it was is simplest and acceptable?

Thanks for your work.

Indeed. I'll revert this and remove its doctest. It used to return `('val', a)` or I would add a doctest for the syntax error.

We're doing a lazy_import of maxima_lib in calculus, though, or is there still a reason to avoid it? I'll just revert that too if so.

I know I had trouble with it before, with dummy_integral. You're right that the lazy import might have fixed the issue there.

My main argument against sharing the code would be to keep the logic simple. The routines `symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string` and `max_to_sr` both serve to translate maxima expressions to SR expressions and they do so independently by design (ideally, we can eventually rip out the entire string-based conversion). In this case we're finding that both need to translate `at` to a `subs` method call. In both cases, the translation is straightforward. If you find that the translation step is too involved to replicate, the proper place to fix it would be to add, for instance, an "at" method to SR that accepts input closer to what `symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string` and `max_to_sr` find. I don't think that's necessary (and it's nicer to keep SR as lean as possible).
