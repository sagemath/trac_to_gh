`spkg-install` could be beautified.

It lacks `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and the usual sanity check (`if [This is the Trac macro *-z "$SAGE_LOCAL" * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#-z "$SAGE_LOCAL" -macro); then ...`), and error messages should be redirected to `stderr`.

I'd also split the build (`make`) from `make install`.

Ooops, I searched for "git" on trac but have apparently been too slow with creating the ticket (or trac lied, as it sometimes does).

Sorry for the noise, or is anybody going to further work on this ticket?

On sage.math, the Python path is hardcoded, as you noted in sage-devel. So this uses the system Python, and so fails to build for me.

On OS X Lion with sage-5.0.beta13, I see this:

I don't know why it's picking up files in /opt and /sw; I don't reference those directories in any environment variables. Oh, according to the Makefile, it looks like we should set `NO_FINK` and `NO_DARWIN_PORTS`, at least on Darwin. Putting `export NO_FINK=yes` (and similar for `NO_DARWIN_PORTS`) in spkg-install fixes the installation on this machine.

This should not be needed:

```
CPPFLAGS="-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include $CPPFLAGS"
LDFLAGS="-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib $LDFLAGS"
```

Also, why use `#!/usr/bin/env sh`?  Forcing `bash` (like everywhere else in Sage) might be slightly more portable.
