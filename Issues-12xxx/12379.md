Assignee: jason, ncohen, rlm

Keywords: graph, MILP, chromatic_number

The following page in the documentation (and the sage docstring for this method)
[https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph.html](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph.html)
states chromatic_number uses the less efficient DLX algorithm by default, as opposed to the MILP algorithm that is sometimes more efficient.

Here, we add the `'parallel'` algorithm that executes all algorithms in parallel and returns the answer as soon as one of the algorithm terminates.

Additionally, someone should probably do a code check to see if there are other methods and functions that use default algorithms that are less efficient than already-written MILP alternatives.

A student in my class -- Andrew Johnson -- looked at doing this ticket.  But he was surprised to find that your assertion that 

```
g = graphs.CubeGraph(11)
time g.chromatic_number(algorithm='DLX')
Time: CPU 0.27 s, Wall: 0.27 s
time g.chromatic_number(algorithm='MILP')
Time: CPU 0.06 s, Wall: 0.06 s
```

But the next one has DLX way ahead:

```
g = graphs.RandomGNP(30, .4)
time g.chromatic_number(algorithm='DLX')
Time: CPU 1.37 s, Wall: 1.37 s
time g.chromatic_number(algorithm='MILP')
Time: CPU 11.29 s, Wall: 11.30 s
```

I just wrote this:

```
def use_all(f, algorithms):
    @parallel(len(algorithms), verbose=False)
    def h(alg):
        return f(algorithm=alg)
    for input, output in h(algorithms):
        return output, input[0][0]
```

which one can use like this:

```
set_random_seed(0)
g = graphs.RandomGNP(20, .5)
time use_all(g.chromatic_number, ['DLX', 'MILP', 'CP'])
```

This way all algorithms get run, and the first to finish is used.  This could be useful.  Perhaps my function above could go in devel/sage-main/sage/parallel/algorithm.py and provide a way to easily implement an algorithm="parallel" option.
