The following page in the documentation (and the sage docstring for this method)
[https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph.html](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph.html)
states chromatic_number uses the less efficient DLX algorithm by default, as opposed to the MILP algorithm that is sometimes more efficient.

Here, we add the `'parallel'` algorithm that executes all algorithms in parallel and returns the answer as soon as one of the algorithm terminates.

A student in my class -- Andrew Johnson -- looked at doing this ticket.  But he was surprised to find that your assertion that 

```
g = graphs.CubeGraph(11)
time g.chromatic_number(algorithm='DLX')
Time: CPU 0.27 s, Wall: 0.27 s
time g.chromatic_number(algorithm='MILP')
Time: CPU 0.06 s, Wall: 0.06 s
```

But the next one has DLX way ahead:

```
g = graphs.RandomGNP(30, .4)
time g.chromatic_number(algorithm='DLX')
Time: CPU 1.37 s, Wall: 1.37 s
time g.chromatic_number(algorithm='MILP')

I just wrote this:

```
def use_all(f, algorithms):
    @parallel(len(algorithms), verbose=False)
    def h(alg):
        return f(algorithm=alg)
    for input, output in h(algorithms):
        return output, input[0][0]
```

which one can use like this:

```
set_random_seed(0)
g = graphs.RandomGNP(20, .5)
time use_all(g.chromatic_number, ['DLX', 'MILP', 'CP'])
```

This way all algorithms get run, and the first to finish is used.  This could be useful.  Perhaps my function above could go in devel/sage-main/sage/parallel/algorithm.py and provide a way to easily implement an algorithm="parallel" option.

To see that there is no clear winner between `DLX` and `MILP` (with `cplex` as default solver):

```
sage: from collections import Counter
sage: count = Counter()
sage: def use_all(f, algorithms):
....:     @parallel(len(algorithms), verbose=False)
....:     def h(alg):
....:         return f(algorithm=alg)
....:     for input, output in h(algorithms):
....:         return output, input[0][0]
sage: for i in range(100):
....:     g = graphs.RandomGNP(20, .5)
....:     c, algo = use_all(g.chromatic_number, ['DLX', 'MILP', 'CP'])
....:     count[algo] += 1
sage: count
Counter({'DLX': 79, 'MILP': 21})
sage: count = Counter()
sage: for i in range(100):
....:     g = graphs.RandomGNP(30, .4)
....:     c, algo = use_all(g.chromatic_number, ['DLX', 'MILP', 'CP'])
....:     count[algo] += 1
sage: count
Counter({'MILP': 74, 'DLX': 26})
```
