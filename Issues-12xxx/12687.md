Can you remind me how I can access the skynet machines? t2 seems to be unavailable.

And what is needed to do in order to build Sage on `OpenSolaris`? IIRC, one needs to set some environment variables.

We turned t2 off again because the UPS's in the math server room were dying after the power outage, and t2 draws quite a lot of power.  They are still not happy.   We probably won't be able to turn t2 on until we buy new UPS's.   The sysadmins are working with a company (APS) to get an estimate done. 

To connect to skynet, connect to sage.math  or boxen.math then ssh to skynet, e.g., 

```
   ssh skynet
```

> And what is needed to do in order to build Sage on `OpenSolaris`? IIRC, one needs to set some environment variables.


I don't think we have any OpenSolaris installs anywhere right now.   ?

Too bad. I do have a skynet account (I have already built sage on some of the skynet machines), but apparently I can not recall my login data.

I am quite puzzled about that error. It seems to me that the patch does work, even on Solaris. Note that in the failing doc test, it is expected that a `RuntimeError` be raised with the error message `Singular terminated unexpectedly while reading in a large line`, and in fact it *is* raised.

However, on `OpenSolaris`, but apparently not on other machines, it seems that the underlying error in Singular is displayed as well. Any idea why?

You mean these lines?

```diff

That would mean: On some machines Singular raises a `RuntimeError`, while in the same setting on `OpenSolaris` it is raising a `TypeError`. Odd.

The other way around, I mean.
