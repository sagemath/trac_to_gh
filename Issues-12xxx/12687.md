Can you remind me how I can access the skynet machines? t2 seems to be unavailable.

And what is needed to do in order to build Sage on `OpenSolaris`? IIRC, one needs to set some environment variables.

We turned t2 off again because the UPS's in the math server room were dying after the power outage, and t2 draws quite a lot of power.  They are still not happy.   We probably won't be able to turn t2 on until we buy new UPS's.   The sysadmins are working with a company (APS) to get an estimate done. 

To connect to skynet, connect to sage.math  or boxen.math then ssh to skynet, e.g., 

```
   ssh skynet
```

> And what is needed to do in order to build Sage on `OpenSolaris`? IIRC, one needs to set some environment variables.

I don't think we have any OpenSolaris installs anywhere right now.   ?

Too bad. I do have a skynet account (I have already built sage on some of the skynet machines), but apparently I can not recall my login data.

I am quite puzzled about that error. It seems to me that the patch does work, even on Solaris. Note that in the failing doc test, it is expected that a `RuntimeError` be raised with the error message `Singular terminated unexpectedly while reading in a large line`, and in fact it *is* raised.

> Well, #10296 has several code paths to raise the exception.  In some cases, the singular error message is added, in other cases not.  I don't think this is a big deal.  I would be happy to solve this using "..."

You mean these lines?

```diff
sage/interfaces/expect.py

diff --git a/sage/interfaces/expect.py b/sage/interfaces/expect.py

 	735	            elif restart_if_needed==True: # the subprocess might have crashed 
 	736	                try: 
 	737	                    self._synchronize() 
 	738	                    return self._post_process_from_file(self._eval_line_using_file(line, restart_if_needed=False)) 
 	739	                except RuntimeError, msg: 
 	740	                    raise RuntimeError, '%s terminated unexpectedly while reading in a large line:\n%s'%(self,msg[0]) 
 	741	                except TypeError: 
 	742	                    pass 
659	743	            raise RuntimeError, '%s terminated unexpectedly while reading in a large line'%self 
```
That would mean: On some machines Singular raises a `RuntimeError`, while in the same setting on `OpenSolaris` it is raising a `TypeError`. Odd.

The other way around, I mean.

I can not test on openSolaris. But just for the record: The patch looks ok to me, as we have seen that the only difference was what kind of error Singular raises.

Well, I can not test on openSolaris. From that perspective, I am not entitled to review it. I can only say that it looks ok. If the build bot does not complain, it is a positive review.
