Jason - what is the status of the last one? Will it be pushed to get "standard" or there is still work to be done there and with your switch nobody is available to steer it?

The first two were definitely lacking features, in particular "things that don't scale with zoom" plus some transparency issues.

Thanks :-) I am interested in enhancing the capabilities of SageManifolds (#14865), which is still under development, so I guess the most natural thing would be to somehow use threejs locally. Probably this question was asked already many times, but what is the current status of threejs in sage notebook (local ipython notebook)?

Probably this question was asked already many times, but what is the current status of threejs in sage notebook (local ipython notebook)?\n\nThe Sagenb is not really at all an Ipython notebook, though it may have inspired earlier versions thereof.  Anyway, the current status is that you can get it to work - see the examples above - but no one has put time into this.  Partly because the sagenb is in maintenance mode currently (though it would be nice to have it more actively developed) but also because of the slight backwards functionality loss involved as you see in previous comments.",

> Thanks :-) I am interested in enhancing the capabilities of SageManifolds (#14865), which is still under development, so I guess the most natural thing would be to somehow use threejs locally. Probably this question was asked already many times, but what is the current status of threejs in sage notebook (local ipython notebook)?

The Sagenb is not really at all an Ipython notebook, though it may have inspired earlier versions thereof.  Anyway, the current status is that you can get it to work - see the examples above - but no one has put time into this.  Partly because the sagenb is in maintenance mode currently (though it would be nice to have it more actively developed) but also because of the slight backwards functionality loss involved as you see in previous comments.

A question: is it possible to customize the axes labels (e.g. via the keyword argument `axes_labels`, as in 2D plots)?

See e.g. [here](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/32890/axes-labels-on-3d-plots/) - this would be a very good enhancement, though I guess it would have to then depend on the backend.

Can you think of anything it does *not* do?  I seem to recall that there were things jsmol did with shading etc. that three.js couldn't, when this was discussed ~ 5 years ago.

Yes, `set_axes_labels` is the (not very satisfactory) workaround I wrote to deal with this when using Jmol ;-)

>- this would be a very good enhancement, though I guess it would have to then depend on the backend.

Maybe not: looking at the source code, in line 155 of `src/sage/plot/plot3d/threejs.py`, there is

```
addLabel( 'x=' + ( xMid ).toFixed(d).toString(), xMid, b[1].y+offset, a[2]*b[0].z );
```

It seems easy to replace `'x='` by another string.

Not at the moment. I'll play with it further.

It's good to know about this project, but I'm aiming for something more general and not focused just on notebooks. Matplotlib lets you create and save image files for 2d plots. I'd like something equivalent for 3d plots, which for Three.js is a self-contained HTML file.

I would find it difficult to believe that current Three.js can't match anything in Jmol.

Thanks for trying it out! I'm trying to decide between reading the `show()` options of the plots fed into `threejs()` or just have a separate dictionary, but should probably do the latter. That would include options for setting axes labels, setting digits after the decimal in labels, turning off axes labels altogether, turning off the bounding box and setting an explicit aspect ratio in all directions.

There is already automatic scaling in the z-direction to avoid the tall thin box that appears in the current version on the cell server (and SMC), but that can easily be overridden. I can also easily add face colors to support surfaces with color maps. Lights for the scene are meant to be customizable as well and can stand some additional improvement.

The initial camera position is not yet completely adaptive to the possible variety of input plots, so ideas on that would be welcome.

We most definitely want this in, so please keep working!!!

Note that we have optional threejs package (SageMathCell is using it) - if we have a functioning viewer we can easily make is standard as it is small and very fast to install.

Interface-wise let's stick to `show` for the actual showing of stuff and `plot/plot3d` for producing plots that can be further manipulated. `threejs` command if it exists at all should do something like set up a low-level threejs scene that can be tweaked as advanced users please.

A scene in Sage is a collection of `Graphics3d` objects. Three.js, like Jmol/JSmol, is merely a way to render the scene. I don't see the use for command to set up a separate Three.js scene from scratch.

Until this Three.js viewer is integrated into the Rich Output backend, I don't have a way to display the scene without a command other than `show`, which will default to Jmol/JSmol. That can change later once an initial version is working acceptably. I've spent enough time reading the Rich Output backend to know where to make those changes, and at that point `show` can then be set to default to a Three.js viewer if desired. For now I need the separate command!

It would be nice to have some (customizable) ticks along the bounding box, but this is probably somewhat tricky and should be the topic of another ticket.

Besides, what about `text3d`? 

At the moment, when running `threejs` from the Jupyter notebook, the 3d plot is rendered in another tab of the browser. Could it be embedded in the notebook instead? (maybe this is related to the Rich Output issue). 

Thanks again for your work on this!

Indeed!

This object does not have a `json_repr` and that would be overkill anyway. I can easily add optional text labels like those on the frame, but would need to think about how to automatically extract `text3d` from other `Graphics3d` objects.
> At the moment, when running `threejs` from the Jupyter notebook, the 3d plot is rendered in another tab of the browser. Could it be embedded in the notebook instead? (maybe this is related to the Rich Output issue). 

It can certainly be embedded, and that is precisely dependent on integration with the Rich Output backend. To be done.

I've now implement several basic display options:

`frame` (bool) display bounding box or not

`aspect_ratio` (list) individual aspect multipliers for each axis

`axes_labels` (list) labels to display. If set to false, all labels are removed.

`decimals` (integer) decimal points in labels

`opacity` (float) overall opacity for surfaces. Currently set for the entire scene.

I've also updated the temporary `threejs()` command so that it has the new options. This command will be maintained until integration with both notebook backends is complete.

This is easily fixed by adding a second pair of `script` tags pointing to a local source. Since Three.js does not currently download during the build process, adding this feature will have to change that and is more appropriate for another ticket.

Rawgit.com is hardly some random site for GitHub people. That being said it's irrelevant where the code is hosted as long as it is available somewhere.

Eric, there's a bit more work to be done:

1) All numeric input parameters need to be made JSON serializable. This is easy to do.

2) The Three.js `Geometry` that I used for convenience needs to be replaced with `BufferGeometry`. This will improve use of available memory and avoid possible browser issues, as well as prepare for stability in notebooks. This is straightforward.

3) The code used for `line` objects needs to be completely rewritten. There is a hardware driver limitation on Windows machines that prevents rendering of line thickness in WebGL that is not going away soon, and I'm still thinking about the best way around this. Andrey certainly won't approve this ticket without line thickness rendering decently across hardware platforms, and I agree with him on that. 

4) Notebook integration needs to be added and tested. Since I am not familiar with the details of notebooks, this may not be straightforward without input from those more familiar. Adding a few Three.js files to a notebook page should be easy, but more than that may require modifying how the notebook dynamically handles `iframe` content. That might also be better dealt with on a separate ticket.

I've been distracted in the last couple weeks with trying to transpile Sage libraries with Emscripten for use directly in the browser, but since that's more work that I thought it would be I can set it aside for awhile and get back to this!

True, Windows line thickness could be its own ticket, and making three.js the default viewer could be another ticket depending on it.

Excellent. A recent

Turns out the `BufferGeometry` isn't necessary for getting this working in notebooks. I've added some basic integration for both notebook types parallel to how JSmol is embedded in each.

Caveat: WebGL is limited to 16 active contexts at a time, so while all the data is in the notebooks the figures may not be active until the cell is reevaluated. I have a basic idea of how to fix this in the future, but it would require a modification to the notebooks themselves which would be a separate ticket.

I haven't worked on the line thickness issue yet.

Thank you for all these improvements! 
It's nice to have `viewer='threejs'` among the `show` options!

There is an issue when plotting the sum of two objects that are themselves sums: only the first object is shown:


```
plot1 = line([(0,0,0), (0,1,0)]) + line([(0,1,0), (1,0,0)])
plot2 = line([(0,0,1), (0,1,1)]) + line([(0,1,1), (1,0,1)])
show(plot1 + plot2, viewer='threejs')  # only plot1 is shown
show(plot2 + plot1, viewer='threejs')  # only plot2 is shown
```

Another issue with sums: the option `opacity` (and maybe other options) is propagated to all objects. For instance in

show(cube() + sphere((2,0,0), opacity=0.2), viewer='threejs')

the cube is displayed with an opacity of 0.2.

There are also some missing doctests, as revealed by `sage -coverage src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx`:

Currently the code is setting global values for all optional keywords and this should of course change for `opacity` and `thickness`. The behavior you're seeing is because an option set in the `_extra_kwds` for one graph propagates up to the corresponding dictionary for the group, with the last occurrence of a setting taking precedence over previous settings.

I'd like to keep the option of a global setting for `opacity` and `thickness` and extract the settings for each component graph as an override, if that sounds reasonable.

One other question is what do to with the remaining settings, which I'm assuming should be global. Leave the default behavior that the last graph sets them all or try to change the existing behavior for graphics groups?

Also, should `aspect_ratio` be settable for each graph? That doesn't make much sense to me but would anyone expect that? The code for that would get messy.

If you're asking about summing several objects in one graph and them having different aspect ratios, I would definitely say no.  I think that somewhere in the 2d code the last explicit aspect ratio is the one used, and this might even be documented.  By the way, I'll note that in experimenting just now I couldn't get "last explicit aspect ratio" less than one to be recognized, only in single graphs...

IMHO, one should distinguish two kinds of options:
- those that are inherently global, like `aspect_ratio`, `axes_labels`, etc.
- those that pertain to individual objects, like `opacity`, `thickness`, etc.
I would vote for not propagating the "individual" options to all objects in a sum. Imagine for instance a plot with a lot of lines with the default thickness. Then one adds a line of thickness 3 and suddenly, all lines appear with that thickness. Even if documented, this is most surprising to the user. Being obliged to specify `thickness=1` for all the lines of the first group to overcome this would be cumbersome and somehow would contradict the concept of default value. One could argue for a new option, e.g. `global_thickness`, to force all individual objects to be drawn with a given thickness, but this is clearly beyond the scope of this ticket. 

Just for curiosity: how is it that, in the current settings, Jmol and Tachyon treat `opacity` in a sum as a genuine individual option, contrary to the three.js viewer? (note also that the three.js viewer of SMC behaves in the same way as Jmol and Tachyon).

> Opacity issue should now be fixed, 

It seems that there is still an issue with opacity:

```
show(cube() + sphere((2,0,0), opacity=0.2), viewer='threejs')
```
draws the sphere with an opacity of 1.

Besides, in the same plot, the lower bound of the frame box x-axis is displayed as -1, while it should be -0.5 (since -0.5 is the cube's min(x)). Maybe a round-off issue? 

> along with an irritating negative zero that appeared in the labels of Eric's test notebook.

This one is fixed indeed. Thanks!

I think I've found the minimal changes necessary to get this to work. The `_extra_kwds` for `ParametricSurface` (which is used for `sphere()`) and `ImplicitSurface` were both empty when their respective `json_repr`s were called, so I set them both explicitly in the `__init__` functions.

Let me insist: since xmin=-0.5 and xmax=3.0, the half-way is x=1.75.

OK, thanks.

Very good. The `opacity` option works well now!

By the way, what about `thickness`? It does not seem to be effective at the moment, even on a Linux computer (cf. [comment:69](#comment:69)):

```
show(line([(0,0,0), (1,1,1)]) + line([(1,0,0), (1,1,1)], thickness=4),

displays two lines of thickness 1, while replacing `'threejs'` by `'jmol'` or `'tachyon'` shows correctly the second line thicker than the first one.

Well, not completely: in the example

show(cube(opacity=0.2) + sphere((2,0,0)), viewer='threejs')

the sphere is totally hidden by the cube. Again `viewer='jmol'` works fine in this case.

If you rotate the figure to put the cube in front of the sphere, you cannot see the sphere through it, i.e. the cube is fully opaque:

On the contrary, with jmol, you can see the sphere through the cube:

Note that if you permute the cube and the sphere in the graphic sum, i.e. run

```
show(sphere((2,0,0)) + cube(opacity=0.2), viewer='threejs')
```
it works well (the output is similar to the jmol one above).

The keyword `thickness` is missing from `_extra_kwds` for objects created with `line3d` but not strangely enough for `parametric_plot3d` which calls `line3d`: a quirk of keyword arguments. I've added it explicitly for the purposes of this ticket.

A better way to handle this situation is to define `json_repr` for `Line` and `Point` just as it already exists for `IndexFaceSet`. That would require a complete rewrite of `_rich_repr_threejs` and I'd rather do that on a separate ticket, so hopefully the simple change to `line3d` is sufficient for a first version.

If the lower endpoint were xmin=0 the midpoint would be 1.5, right? If the lower endpont moves up to +.5 then I agree the midpoint would be 1.75, but if the lower endpoint moves below zero to -.5 then the midpoint moves below 1.5 to 1.25.

In the process of fixing a line thickness problem, I came across an existing keyword `radius` for drawing lines. This already solves the problem of drawing thicker lines since they are rendered as cylindrical segments.

Line thickness in WebGL is very hardware dependent even apart from the Windows problem. It will max out around 10 on Mac OS X, with higher values not having any effect. There's no problem leaving `linethickness` in place for those who want to use it, but the `radius` option is perhaps better and works already.

Thanks for the `radius` and `thickness` options! IMHO this is very close to positive review. A few last points, maybe some of them can be defered to another ticket:

- The documentation about the use of `threejs` in the 3D Graphics section of the
  reference manual is rather poor. It would be nice to have an entry (even a small one) in 
  the  "Backends" subsection (for the time being there is only one such entry: 
  "The Tachyon 3D Ray Tracer"), in particular to document options like `decimals`, which are
  specific to `threejs`. 
- As discussed in [comment:63](#comment:63), an internet connection is required (by 
  `src/sage/plot/plot3d/threejs_template.html`) to access to the files 
  [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/build/three.js) and 
  [OrbitControls.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js). Apparently these files are released under a MIT license. Is it
  possible/meaningful to integrate a copy of them in Sage's sources files, so that
  the threejs viewer can be used off-line?
- What about `text3d`, which seems to be the last major missing functionality?. Would this
  require another ticket?
- The `save` method of 3D graphic objects, which generates a static png image, does not accept 
  the option `viewer='threejs'`:

  ```
  sphere().save('figure.png', viewer='jmol')     # OK
  sphere().save('figure.png', viewer='tachyon')  # OK
  sphere().save('figure.png', viewer='threejs') 
  ValueError: cannot use viewer=threejs to render image

The tachyon entry is there because its class is a separate Python file. I could make a separate file for Three.js but it won't have anything but documentation and examples, since all of the code is in `Graphics3d._rich_repr_threejs`.

This is a planned feature and there is a standard [method](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1014203/best-way-to-use-googles-hosted-jquery-but-fall-back-to-my-hosted-library-on-go) for switching to local JavaScript when there is no connection.

I've added basic support for this, with the caveat that it only works when `text3d` is not the only object viewed. This is because `text3d` is a packaged in a `TransformationGroup` and the process of flattening the input mangles the text location stored in the property `_trans`. The current behavior appears to work like Jmol but I'm not completely happy with it. The `text3d` object modifies the bounding box for the entire `GraphicsGroup3d`, so the text often ends up sitting on the frame.

Jmol and Tachyon are their own renderers, so they are capable of producing preview images. The rendering of Three.js occurs entirely in the browser, so this Python method is never going to work for it. What I can add later is a right-context menu for the HTML page that will save image data to a file. That would best be done as a separate ticket.

OK, but note that one can set up a pure documentation file, with only docstrings and no Python code; an example is `src/sage/plot/plot3d/examples.py`. Maybe you should just add a few lines to that file.

OK very good.

OK, thank you very much for the addition of `text3d`!

OK fine. 

Playing with the latest version, I've noticed an issue with `point3d`: running

```
show(cube() + point3d((0,0,1)), viewer='threejs')
```
results in a frame box that is too high: z_max = 2, whereas it should be 1. With Jmol or Tachyon, the frame box is fine.

Documentation is now in a separate file and can be accessed easily from a link in the "Backends" section of the index. I've also added a couple live examples for the HTML version. I'll add more later after other fixes/features are addressed on future tickets, particularly making the viewer work offline.

I also made some changes to remove the JavaScript `eval` function from the template. I had it there for convenience but don't want an insecure method in the final version.

Thanks a lot for all these changes!
The documentation looks very nice.
As revealed by the patchbot, there are however 2 doctest errors in `src/doc/en/reference/plot3d/threejs.rst` (I could reproduce those on my computer). Once this is fixed, I would go for a positive review.
