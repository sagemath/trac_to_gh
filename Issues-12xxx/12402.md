Jason - what is the status of the last one? Will it be pushed to get "standard" or there is still work to be done there and with your switch nobody is available to steer it?

The first two were definitely lacking features, in particular "things that don't scale with zoom" plus some transparency issues.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:23'></a>\nHere's some basic Three.js support for `Graphics3d` objects. It is modeled on the corresponding function in SageMathCell: simply use `threejs()` to wrap any combination of points, lines and surfaces. This will save an HTML file with the JavaScript needed to render the scene and open it in a browser.\n\nThere are a great many features that can be added in the future, but I first would like to see how much interest there is in this.

Here's some basic Three.js support for `Graphics3d` objects. It is modeled on the corresponding function in SageMathCell: simply use `threejs()` to wrap any combination of points, lines and surfaces. This will save an HTML file with the JavaScript needed to render the scene and open it in a browser.

There are a great many features that can be added in the future, but I first would like to see how much interest there is in this. There have been problems surfacing with Jmol (#20978 for example) and I certainly think it would be preferable to have a native viewer that can be updated more quickly. The HTML format is also more portable than Jmol files, since it only requires a modern browser to run.

This version relies on an external CDN to retrieve the Three.js library, since it does not currently download to the hard drive during the build process. I'll need help on figuring out how to change that at some point, since I'm sure people will want to be able to view saved files offline.

Yes, `set_axes_labels` is the (not very satisfactory) workaround I wrote to deal with this when using Jmol ;-)

>- this would be a very good enhancement, though I guess it would have to then depend on the backend.


Maybe not: looking at the source code, in line 155 of `src/sage/plot/plot3d/threejs.py`, there is

```
addLabel( 'x=' + ( xMid ).toFixed(d).toString(), xMid, b[1].y+offset, a[2]*b[0].z );
```

It seems easy to replace `'x='` by another string.

Not at the moment. I'll play with it further.

It's good to know about this project, but I'm aiming for something more general and not focused just on notebooks. Matplotlib lets you create and save image files for 2d plots. I'd like something equivalent for 3d plots, which for Three.js is a self-contained HTML file.

We most definitely want this in, so please keep working!!!

Note that we have optional threejs package (SageMathCell is using it) - if we have a functioning viewer we can easily make is standard as it is small and very fast to install.

Interface-wise let's stick to `show` for the actual showing of stuff and `plot/plot3d` for producing plots that can be further manipulated. `threejs` command if it exists at all should do something like set up a low-level threejs scene that can be tweaked as advanced users please. Presumably, it is possible to just pass some HTML/JavaScript code that will be inserted into generated files?

<a id='comment:36'></a>
So it seems that at the moment opacity is ignored and line thickness is not taken into account - is it possible to implement these?

Also when I scale the image text grows/shrinks and then "becomes normal again" - is it possible to always keep it the same size throughout the transition?

Opacity should be simple. Line thickness can be included, but will not be consistent across operating systems because of a limitation in Microsoft's implementation of WebGL.

A scene in Sage is a collection of `Graphics3d` objects. Three.js, like Jmol/JSmol, is merely a way to render the scene. I don't see the use for command to set up a separate Three.js scene from scratch.

Until this Three.js viewer is integrated into the Rich Output backend, I don't have a way to display the scene without a command other than `show`, which will default to Jmol/JSmol. That can change later once an initial version is working acceptably. I've spent enough time reading the Rich Output backend to know where to make those changes, and at that point `show` can then be set to default to a Three.js viewer if desired. For now I need the separate command!

It would be nice to have some (customizable) ticks along the bounding box, but this is probably somewhat tricky and should be the topic of another ticket.

Besides, what about `text3d`? 

At the moment, when running `threejs` from the Jupyter notebook, the 3d plot is rendered in another tab of the browser. Could it be embedded in the notebook instead? (maybe this is related to the Rich Output issue). 

Thanks again for your work on this!

Indeed!

This object does not have a `json_repr` and that would be overkill anyway. I can easily add optional text labels like those on the frame, but would need to think about how to automatically extract `text3d` from other `Graphics3d` objects.

I've now implement several basic display options:

`frame` (bool) display bounding box or not

`aspect_ratio` (list) individual aspect multipliers for each axis

`axes_labels` (list) labels to display. If set to false, all labels are removed.

`decimals` (integer) decimal points in labels

`opacity` (float) overall opacity for surfaces. Currently set for the entire scene.

I've also updated the temporary `threejs()` command so that it has the new options. This command will be maintained until integration with both notebook backends is complete.

    "body": "<a id='comment:63'></a>\nI somehow just looked at this for a few minutes -- take or leave these comments.  Feel free to ignore them...\n\nThe first thing I see (in https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/plot/plot3d/threejs_template.html?id=67930e843d29652f143c67329aaf32be4ab120a8) is:\n\n```\n<script src=http://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r80/build/three.js></script>\n<script src=http://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r80/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js></script>\n```\n\nA concern is that this won't work offline -- 3d graphics will just be completely broken without an external internet connection.   Also, this is making 3d graphics display in Sage depend on \"some random site\" (rawgit.com) which says on their page: \"The catch: this is a free service, so there are no uptime or support guarantees.\"...\n\nThis provides absolutely no Jupyter notebook integration at all as far as I can tell.  It's just creating a single standalone local website for the image and popping that up in the users browser.   If you do something more serious that does try to integrate with Jupyter, you might find it is a lot of work to get Chrome with more than about 10+ 3d plots on the same page..   That was a big problem when I implemented WebGL based 3d graphics for SageMathCloud, which involved quite a bit of work (involving great care with the renderer, swapping things out with static png's etc.).  When you're just trying to get a demo working you don't worry about such scale.  However, if you're teaching, you can easily have many plots in one notebook.   Anyway, this is one reason that the SMC Javascript is longer and more complicated.\n\nAnother question is how much of 3d plot rendering have you actually implemented?   For example, I recently added arrowheads to lines to SMC, since I had missed those and you expect them when plotting 3d vector fields.   I don't see any code in threejs_template.html for that. \n\n\nI guess you just only support WebGL, even though three.js can support canvas too....  Maybe that's fine these days, but again supporting both is something I put a lot of work into. \n  \n\n\nThe SMC implementation: \n\n- client side -- https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/blob/master/src/smc-webapp/3d.coffee\n- server side -- https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/blob/master/src/smc_sagews/smc_sagews/graphics.py",

I somehow just looked at this for a few minutes -- take or leave these comments.  Feel free to ignore them...

The first thing I see (in https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/plot/plot3d/threejs_template.html?id=67930e843d29652f143c67329aaf32be4ab120a8) is:

```
<script src=http://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r80/build/three.js></script>
<script src=http://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/r80/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js></script>
```

A concern is that this won't work offline -- 3d graphics will just be completely broken without an external internet connection.   Also, this is making 3d graphics display in Sage depend on "some random site" (rawgit.com) which says on their page: "The catch: this is a free service, so there are no uptime or support guarantees."...

This provides absolutely no Jupyter notebook integration at all as far as I can tell.  It's just creating a single standalone local website for the image and popping that up in the users browser.   If you do something more serious that does try to integrate with Jupyter, you might find it is a lot of work to get Chrome with more than about 10+ 3d plots on the same page..   That was a big problem when I implemented WebGL based 3d graphics for SageMathCloud, which involved quite a bit of work (involving great care with the renderer, swapping things out with static png's etc.).  When you're just trying to get a demo working you don't worry about such scale.  However, if you're teaching, you can easily have many plots in one notebook.   Anyway, this is one reason that the SMC Javascript is longer and more complicated.

Another question is how much of 3d plot rendering have you actually implemented?   For example, I recently added arrowheads to lines to SMC, since I had missed those and you expect them when plotting 3d vector fields.   I don't see any code in threejs_template.html for that. 


I guess you just only support WebGL, even though three.js can support canvas too....  Maybe that's fine these days, but again supporting both is something I put a lot of work into. 
  


The SMC implementation:

- server side -- https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/blob/master/src/smc_sagews/smc_sagews/graphics.py

This is easily fixed by adding a second pair of `script` tags pointing to a local source. Since Three.js does not currently download during the build process, adding this feature will have to change that and is more appropriate for another ticket.

Eric, there's a bit more work to be done:

1) All numeric input parameters need to be made JSON serializable. This is easy to do.

2) The Three.js `Geometry` that I used for convenience needs to be replaced with `BufferGeometry`. This will improve use of available memory and avoid possible browser issues, as well as prepare for stability in notebooks. This is straightforward.

3) The code used for `line` objects needs to be completely rewritten. There is a hardware driver limitation on Windows machines that prevents rendering of line thickness in WebGL that is not going away soon, and I'm still thinking about the best way around this. Andrey certainly won't approve this ticket without line thickness rendering decently across hardware platforms, and I agree with him on that. 

4) Notebook integration needs to be added and tested. Since I am not familiar with the details of notebooks, this may not be straightforward without input from those more familiar. Adding a few Three.js files to a notebook page should be easy, but more than that may require modifying how the notebook dynamically handles `iframe` content. That might also be better dealt with on a separate ticket.

I've been distracted in the last couple weeks with trying to transpile Sage libraries with Emscripten for use directly in the browser, but since that's more work that I thought it would be I can set it aside for awhile and get back to this!

Turns out the `BufferGeometry` isn't necessary for getting this working in notebooks. I've added some basic integration for both notebook types parallel to how JSmol is embedded in each.

Caveat: WebGL is limited to 16 active contexts at a time, so while all the data is in the notebooks the figures may not be active until the cell is reevaluated. I have a basic idea of how to fix this in the future, but it would require a modification to the notebooks themselves which would be a separate ticket.

I haven't worked on the line thickness issue yet.

Thank you for all these improvements! 
It's nice to have `viewer='threejs'` among the `show` options!

There is an issue when plotting the sum of two objects that are themselves sums: only the first object is shown:


```
plot1 = line([(0,0,0), (0,1,0)]) + line([(0,1,0), (1,0,0)])
plot2 = line([(0,0,1), (0,1,1)]) + line([(0,1,1), (1,0,1)])
show(plot1 + plot2, viewer='threejs')  # only plot1 is shown
show(plot2 + plot1, viewer='threejs')  # only plot2 is shown
```

In any case, this is somehow related to the three.js viewer, since neither jmol nor tachyon have this issue.

Currently the code is setting global values for all optional keywords and this should of course change for `opacity` and `thickness`. The behavior you're seeing is because an option set in the `_extra_kwds` for one graph propagates up to the corresponding dictionary for the group, with the last occurrence of a setting taking precedence over previous settings.

I'd like to keep the option of a global setting for `opacity` and `thickness` and extract the settings for each component graph as an override, if that sounds reasonable.

One other question is what do to with the remaining settings, which I'm assuming should be global. Leave the default behavior that the last graph sets them all or try to change the existing behavior for graphics groups?

Also, should `aspect_ratio` be settable for each graph? That doesn't make much sense to me but would anyone expect that? The code for that would get messy.

IMHO, one should distinguish two kinds of options:
- those that are inherently global, like `aspect_ratio`, `axes_labels`, etc.
- those that pertain to individual objects, like `opacity`, `thickness`, etc.
I would vote for not propagating the "individual" options to all objects in a sum. Imagine for instance a plot with a lot of lines with the default thickness. Then one adds a line of thickness 3 and suddenly, all lines appear with that thickness. Even if documented, this is most surprising to the user. Being obliged to specify `thickness=1` for all the lines of the first group to overcome this would be cumbersome and somehow would contradict the concept of default value. One could argue for a new option, e.g. `global_thickness`, to force all individual objects to be drawn with a given thickness, but this is clearly beyond the scope of this ticket. 

Just for curiosity: how is it that, in the current settings, Jmol and Tachyon treat `opacity` in a sum as a genuine individual option, contrary to the three.js viewer? (note also that the three.js viewer of SMC behaves in the same way as Jmol and Tachyon).

It seems that there is still an issue with opacity:

```
show(cube() + sphere((2,0,0), opacity=0.2), viewer='threejs')
```
draws the sphere with an opacity of 1.

Besides, in the same plot, the lower bound of the frame box x-axis is displayed as -1, while it should be -0.5 (since -0.5 is the cube's min(x)). Maybe a round-off issue?

> This is an explicit round-off in the JavaScript: the option `decimals` for the number of decimal points in labels defaults to zero. I thought that `decimals` might be a useful option, for example when the bounding box returns an irrational number. Either the `decimals` option can be removed entirely or only applied when explicity set.

IMHO, it's a very usefull option and it should be maintained.
Could the default be set to 1? This would solve the above issue (i.e. x_min appears as -0.5).

That's why the `-0` was turning up in your notebook: the number before rounding was a bit less than zero.


Even in the current settings, there seems to be some issue with that: considering again the example of[comment:90](#comment%3A90) with `decimals=2`, we get the label `x=1.25`, while it should be `x=1.75`.

Do you think this is reasonable for the current ticket?

I think I've found the minimal changes necessary to get this to work. The `_extra_kwds` for `ParametricSurface` (which is used for `sphere()`) and `ImplicitSurface` were both empty when their respective `json_repr`s were called, so I set them both explicitly in the `__init__` functions.

Let me insist: since xmin=-0.5 and xmax=3.0, the half-way is x=1.75.

Very good. The `opacity` option works well now!

By the way, what about `thickness`? It does not seem to be effective at the moment, even on a Linux computer (cf.[comment:69](#comment%3A69)):

```
show(line([(0,0,0), (1,1,1)]) + line([(1,0,0), (1,1,1)], thickness=4), 
     viewer='threejs')
```
displays two lines of thickness 1, while replacing `'threejs'` by `'jmol'` or `'tachyon'` shows correctly the second line thicker than the first one.

Well, not completely: in the example

show(cube(opacity=0.2) + sphere((2,0,0)), viewer='threejs')

the sphere is totally hidden by the cube. Again `viewer='jmol'` works fine in this case.

If you rotate the figure to put the cube in front of the sphere, you cannot see the sphere through it, i.e. the cube is fully opaque:

The keyword `thickness` is missing from `_extra_kwds` for objects created with `line3d` but not strangely enough for `parametric_plot3d` which calls `line3d`: a quirk of keyword arguments. I've added it explicitly for the purposes of this ticket.

A better way to handle this situation is to define `json_repr` for `Line` and `Point` just as it already exists for `IndexFaceSet`. That would require a complete rewrite of `_rich_repr_threejs` and I'd rather do that on a separate ticket, so hopefully the simple change to `line3d` is sufficient for a first version.

If the lower endpoint were xmin=0 the midpoint would be 1.5, right? If the lower endpont moves up to +.5 then I agree the midpoint would be 1.75, but if the lower endpoint moves below zero to -.5 then the midpoint moves below 1.5 to 1.25.

In the process of fixing a line thickness problem, I came across an existing keyword `radius` for drawing lines. This already solves the problem of drawing thicker lines since they are rendered as cylindrical segments.

Line thickness in WebGL is very hardware dependent even apart from the Windows problem. It will max out around 10 on Mac OS X, with higher values not having any effect. There's no problem leaving `linethickness` in place for those who want to use it, but the `radius` option is perhaps better and works already.

Thanks for the `radius` and `thickness` options! IMHO this is very close to positive review. A few last points, maybe some of them can be defered to another ticket:

- The documentation about the use of `threejs` in the 3D Graphics section of the
  reference manual is rather poor. It would be nice to have an entry (even a small one) in 
  the  "Backends" subsection (for the time being there is only one such entry: 
  "The Tachyon 3D Ray Tracer"), in particular to document options like `decimals`, which are
  specific to `threejs`. 
- As discussed in[comment:63](#comment%3A63), an internet connection is required (by 
  `src/sage/plot/plot3d/threejs_template.html`) to access to the files 
  [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/build/three.js) and 
  [OrbitControls.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js). Apparently these files are released under a MIT license. Is it
  possible/meaningful to integrate a copy of them in Sage's sources files, so that
  the threejs viewer can be used off-line?
- What about `text3d`, which seems to be the last major missing functionality?. Would this
  require another ticket?
- The `save` method of 3D graphic objects, which generates a static png image, does not accept 
  the option `viewer='threejs'`:
  {{{
  sphere().save('figure.png', viewer='jmol')     # OK
  sphere().save('figure.png', viewer='tachyon')  # OK
  sphere().save('figure.png', viewer='threejs') 
  ValueError: cannot use viewer=threejs to render image

The tachyon entry is there because its class is a separate Python file. I could make a separate file for Three.js but it won't have anything but documentation and examples, since all of the code is in `Graphics3d._rich_repr_threejs`.

This is a planned feature and there is a standard [method](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1014203/best-way-to-use-googles-hosted-jquery-but-fall-back-to-my-hosted-library-on-go) for switching to local JavaScript when there is no connection.

I've added basic support for this, with the caveat that it only works when `text3d` is not the only object viewed. This is because `text3d` is a packaged in a `TransformationGroup` and the process of flattening the input mangles the text location stored in the property `_trans`. The current behavior appears to work like Jmol but I'm not completely happy with it. The `text3d` object modifies the bounding box for the entire `GraphicsGroup3d`, so the text often ends up sitting on the frame. A future feature would be to add a `labels` global option that would be an array of text objects that could be placed anywhere, even outside the frame.

Jmol and Tachyon are their own renderers, so they are capable of producing preview images. The rendering of Three.js occurs entirely in the browser, so this Python method is never going to work for it. What I can add later is a right-context menu for the HTML page that will save image data to a file. That would best be done as a separate ticket.

OK, but note that one can set up a pure documentation file, with only docstrings and no Python code; an example is `src/sage/plot/plot3d/examples.py`. Maybe you should just add a few lines to that file.

OK very good.

OK, thank you very much for the addition of `text3d`!

OK fine. 

Playing with the latest version, I've noticed an issue with `point3d`: running

```
show(cube() + point3d((0,0,1)), viewer='threejs')
```
results in a frame box that is too high: z_max = 2, whereas it should be 1. With Jmol or Tachyon, the frame box is fine.

The original commit had a function to move points off the bounding frame to help me determine that the points were being rendered. Since this is unexpected behavior, I've removed that function.

PS: I've updated the [notebook about plotting fields on the 2-sphere](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/egourgoulhon/SageMathTest/blob/master/Worksheets/test_sphere_threejs.ipynb), which works very well (note that since Sage 7.5.beta4, you do no longer need to install SageManifolds to run it).

is bad, as SAGE_SRC should not be used at runtime: all these files should be installed in SAGE_LOCAL, oe whatever the right place is.
