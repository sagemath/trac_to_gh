It sort of works, but it isn't included by default.   It will be soon though, so that anybody can at least test out some minimal functionality.  I'll post when that happens.

Jason - what is the status of the last one? Will it be pushed to get "standard" or there is still work to be done there and with your switch nobody is available to steer it?

The first two were definitely lacking features, in particular "things that don't scale with zoom" plus some transparency issues.

Here's some basic Three.js support for `Graphics3d` objects. It is modeled on the corresponding function in SageMathCell: simply use `threejs()` to wrap any combination of points, lines and surfaces. This will save an HTML file with the JavaScript needed to render the scene and open it in a browser.

There are a great many features that can be added in the future, but I first would like to see how much interest there is in this. There have been problems surfacing with Jmol (#20978 for example) and I certainly think it would be preferable to have a native viewer that can be updated more quickly. The HTML format is also more portable than Jmol files, since it only requires a modern browser to run.

This version relies on an external CDN to retrieve the Three.js library, since it does not currently download to the hard drive during the build process. I'll need help on figuring out how to change that at some point, since I'm sure people will want to be able to view saved files offline.

See e.g. [here](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/32890/axes-labels-on-3d-plots/) - this would be a very good enhancement, though I guess it would have to then depend on the backend.

Can you think of anything it does *not* do?  I seem to recall that there were things jsmol did with shading etc. that three.js couldn't, when this was discussed ~ 5 years ago.

Yes, `set_axes_labels` is the (not very satisfactory) workaround I wrote to deal with this when using Jmol ;-)

>- this would be a very good enhancement, though I guess it would have to then depend on the backend.


Maybe not: looking at the source code, in line 155 of `src/sage/plot/plot3d/threejs.py`, there is

```
addLabel( 'x=' + ( xMid ).toFixed(d).toString(), xMid, b[1].y+offset, a[2]*b[0].z );
```

It seems easy to replace `'x='` by another string.

Not at the moment. I'll play with it further.

It's good to know about this project, but I'm aiming for something more general and not focused just on notebooks. Matplotlib lets you create and save image files for 2d plots. I'd like something equivalent for 3d plots, which for Three.js is a self-contained HTML file.

We most definitely want this in, so please keep working!!!

Note that we have optional threejs package (SageMathCell is using it) - if we have a functioning viewer we can easily make is standard as it is small and very fast to install.

Interface-wise let's stick to `show` for the actual showing of stuff and `plot/plot3d` for producing plots that can be further manipulated. `threejs` command if it exists at all should do something like set up a low-level threejs scene that can be tweaked as advanced users please.

Indeed!

This is easily fixed by adding a second pair of `script` tags pointing to a local source. Since Three.js does not currently download during the build process, adding this feature will have to change that and is more appropriate for another ticket.
>Also, this is making 3d graphics display in Sage depend on "some random site" (rawgit.com) which says on their page: "The catch: this is a free service, so there are no uptime or support guarantees."...

Rawgit.com is hardly some random site for GitHub people. That being said it's irrelevant where the code is hosted as long as it is available somewhere. The intent is to make the interactive image as portable as a PNG, so it can't depend entirely on one's local installation: an external CDN link is vital.

The process here of creating 3D images exactly parallels that of 2D plots: a file is generated, saved to disc and displayed in the best possible viewer as determined by the rich output backend. It's not a local website, it's a file that can be saved and used elsewhere as desired, exactly as for static 2D plots.

Eric, there's a bit more work to be done:

1) All numeric input parameters need to be made JSON serializable. This is easy to do.

2) The Three.js `Geometry` that I used for convenience needs to be replaced with `BufferGeometry`. This will improve use of available memory and avoid possible browser issues, as well as prepare for stability in notebooks. This is straightforward.

3) The code used for `line` objects needs to be completely rewritten. There is a hardware driver limitation on Windows machines that prevents rendering of line thickness in WebGL that is not going away soon, and I'm still thinking about the best way around this. Andrey certainly won't approve this ticket without line thickness rendering decently across hardware platforms, and I agree with him on that. 

4) Notebook integration needs to be added and tested. Since I am not familiar with the details of notebooks, this may not be straightforward without input from those more familiar. Adding a few Three.js files to a notebook page should be easy, but more than that may require modifying how the notebook dynamically handles `iframe` content. That might also be better dealt with on a separate ticket.

I've been distracted in the last couple weeks with trying to transpile Sage libraries with Emscripten for use directly in the browser, but since that's more work that I thought it would be I can set it aside for awhile and get back to this!

It's nice to have `viewer='threejs'` among the `show` options!

There is an issue when plotting the sum of two objects that are themselves sums: only the first object is shown:


```
plot1 = line([(0,0,0), (0,1,0)]) + line([(0,1,0), (1,0,0)])
plot2 = line([(0,0,1), (0,1,1)]) + line([(0,1,1), (1,0,1)])

Another issue with sums: the option `opacity` (and maybe other options) is propagated to all objects. For instance in 

```
show(cube() + sphere((2,0,0), opacity=0.2), viewer='threejs') 
```
the cube is displayed with an opacity of 0.2.

Currently the code is setting global values for all optional keywords and this should of course change for `opacity` and `thickness`. The behavior you're seeing is because an option set in the `_extra_kwds` for one graph propagates up to the corresponding dictionary for the group, with the last occurrence of a setting taking precedence over previous settings.

I'd like to keep the option of a global setting for `opacity` and `thickness` and extract the settings for each component graph as an override, if that sounds reasonable.

One other question is what do to with the remaining settings, which I'm assuming should be global. Leave the default behavior that the last graph sets them all or try to change the existing behavior for graphics groups?

Also, should `aspect_ratio` be settable for each graph? That doesn't make much sense to me but would anyone expect that? The code for that would get messy.

IMHO, one should distinguish two kinds of options:
- those that are inherently global, like `aspect_ratio`, `axes_labels`, etc.
- those that pertain to individual objects, like `opacity`, `thickness`, etc.
I would vote for not propagating the "individual" options to all objects in a sum. Imagine for instance a plot with a lot of lines with the default thickness. Then one adds a line of thickness 3 and suddenly, all lines appear with that thickness. Even if documented, this is most surprising to the user. Being obliged to specify `thickness=1` for all the lines of the first group to overcome this would be cumbersome and somehow would contradict the concept of default value.

Just for curiosity: how is it that, in the current settings, Jmol and Tachyon treat `opacity` in a sum as a genuine individual option, contrary to the three.js viewer? (note also that the three.js viewer of SMC behaves in the same way as Jmol and Tachyon).

It seems that there is still an issue with opacity:

```
show(cube() + sphere((2,0,0), opacity=0.2), viewer='threejs')
```
draws the sphere with an opacity of 1.

Besides, in the same plot, the lower bound of the frame box x-axis is displayed as -1, while it should be -0.5 (since -0.5 is the cube's min(x)). Maybe a round-off issue?

Let me insist: since xmin=-0.5 and xmax=3.0, the half-way is x=1.75.

Very good. The `opacity` option works well now!

By the way, what about `thickness`? It does not seem to be effective at the moment, even on a Linux computer (cf. comment:69):

```
show(line([(0,0,0), (1,1,1)]) + line([(1,0,0), (1,1,1)], thickness=4), 
     viewer='threejs')
```
displays two lines of thickness 1, while replacing `'threejs'` by `'jmol'` or `'tachyon'` shows correctly the second line thicker than the first one.

Well, not completely: in the example

```
show(cube(opacity=0.2) + sphere((2,0,0)), viewer='threejs')
```
the sphere is totally hidden by the cube. Again `viewer='jmol'` works fine in this case.

If you rotate the figure to put the cube in front of the sphere, you cannot see the sphere through it, i.e. the cube is fully opaque:

On the contrary, with jmol, you can see the sphere through the cube:

The keyword `thickness` is missing from `_extra_kwds` for objects created with `line3d` but not strangely enough for `parametric_plot3d` which calls `line3d`: a quirk of keyword arguments. I've added it explicitly for the purposes of this ticket.

A better way to handle this situation is to define `json_repr` for `Line` and `Point` just as it already exists for `IndexFaceSet`.

If the lower endpoint were xmin=0 the midpoint would be 1.5, right? If the lower endpont moves up to +.5 then I agree the midpoint would be 1.75, but if the lower endpoint moves below zero to -.5 then the midpoint moves below 1.5 to 1.25.

In the process of fixing a line thickness problem, I came across an existing keyword `radius` for drawing lines. This already solves the problem of drawing thicker lines since they are rendered as cylindrical segments.

Line thickness in WebGL is very hardware dependent even apart from the Windows problem. It will max out around 10 on Mac OS X, with higher values not having any effect. There's no problem leaving `linethickness` in place for those who want to use it, but the `radius` option is perhaps better and works already.

Thanks for the `radius` and `thickness` options! IMHO this is very close to positive review. A few last points, maybe some of them can be defered to another ticket:

- The documentation about the use of `threejs` in the 3D Graphics section of the
  reference manual is rather poor. It would be nice to have an entry (even a small one) in 
  the  "Backends" subsection (for the time being there is only one such entry: 
  "The Tachyon 3D Ray Tracer"), in particular to document options like `decimals`, which are
  specific to `threejs`. 
- As discussed in comment:63, an internet connection is required (by

The tachyon entry is there because its class is a separate Python file. I could make a separate file for Three.js but it won't have anything but documentation and examples, since all of the code is in `Graphics3d._rich_repr_threejs`.

This is a planned feature and there is a standard [method](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1014203/best-way-to-use-googles-hosted-jquery-but-fall-back-to-my-hosted-library-on-go) for switching to local JavaScript when there is no connection.

I've added basic support for this, with the caveat that it only works when `text3d` is not the only object viewed. This is because `text3d` is a packaged in a `TransformationGroup` and the process of flattening the input mangles the text location stored in the property `_trans`. The current behavior appears to work like Jmol but I'm not completely happy with it. The `text3d` object modifies the bounding box for the entire `GraphicsGroup3d`, so the text often ends up sitting on the frame.

Jmol and Tachyon are their own renderers, so they are capable of producing preview images. The rendering of Three.js occurs entirely in the browser, so this Python method is never going to work for it. What I can add later is a right-context menu for the HTML page that will save image data to a file. That would best be done as a separate ticket.

OK, but note that one can set up a pure documentation file, with only docstrings and no Python code; an example is `src/sage/plot/plot3d/examples.py`. Maybe you should just add a few lines to that file.

OK very good.

OK, thank you very much for the addition of `text3d`!

OK fine. 

Playing with the latest version, I've noticed an issue with `point3d`: running

```
show(cube() + point3d((0,0,1)), viewer='threejs')
```
results in a frame box that is too high: z_max = 2, whereas it should be 1. With Jmol or Tachyon, the frame box is fine.

The original commit had a function to move points off the bounding frame to help me determine that the points were being rendered. Since this is unexpected behavior, I've removed that function.

There is a `threejs` (optional) package in Sage already. Do you really need to fetch files from a CDN (without user prior consent), and not those provided by the package ? What would be missing ?
