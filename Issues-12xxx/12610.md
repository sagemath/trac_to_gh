<a id='comment:2'></a>Here are some remaining problems:

1) To use in Sage the implemented class BaxterPermutations, I have to execute 

```
from sage.combinat.permutation import BaxterPermutations
```
How can I ensure that the class is directly visible?

2) The command

```
TestSuite(BaxterPermutations(3)).run()
```
returns, among other,

```
The following tests failed: _test_an_element, _test_enumerated_set_iter_cardinality
```
How can I fix this?

See sage/combinat/all.py

(a separate question is whether we want to import this by default)

Try: 

```
    sage: P = BaxterPermutations(3)
    sage: P._test_an_element()
```

And see the specific error message. `import pdb; pdb.pm()` is your friend too to  examine the stack trace. See also `TestSuite?` for debugging tips.
