False

Singular seems to have issues with square-free factorization over ZZ:

   ? not implemented
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 3: `sqrfree(p);`
```
This might be implemented in a more recent version, don't know about that. Looking at the Singular source there is a `isSqrFreeZ` function in the factory that should do the right thing. Its not clear to me why the code path doesn't end up there.

Over QQ it works fine:

```
> ring Q = 0,(x,y),dp;
> poly p = x^2+y^2;
> sqrfree(p);
_[1]=x2+y2
```
I haven't found a way to test square-freeness (as opposed to compute the squarefree factorization) from the Singular command line, is this function not exposed to the Singular interpreter?

Integer coefficients are relatively new in Singular. Many fuctions do not work with them. In this case, Singular raises an error using a callback function (see `sage.libs.singular.singular.libsingular_error_callback`). Unfortunately we do not check for it and return wrong results.

A workaround, suggested by Martin Lee, for this immediate problem is to `change_ring(QQ)` and call `is_squarefree()` there.

If there isn't a ticket already about handling errors raised in libsingular, we should open one. Note that the magical function interface (the one you get through `sage.libs.singular.ff.*`) can handle Singular errors. It's only direct C library calls that should check explicitly if Singular raised an error. Perhaps we can solve it by wrapping the declarations in `sage/libs/singular/singular-cdefs.pxi` in a preprocessor macro which calls `PyErr_Occured()` after raising an exception in `libsingular_error_callback()`.

the same problem happens over finite fields:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(2)[]
sage: f=x+y
sage: f.is_squarefree()
False
```
If `is_squarefree` is wrong, it should be simply disabled.
