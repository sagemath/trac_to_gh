The maximal_order function of QuaternionOrder can produce incorrect results.
It is implemented by means of an explicit formula, which expects not just the algebra to be ramified precisely at one finite prime p and infinity, but also expect the invariants a=i<sup>2</sup> and b=j<sup>2</sup> to have a special form. Not all the necessary conditions are checked by the code.

E.g. the following is obviously not an order since it contains non-integral elements:

```
sage: A.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(17)
sage: print A.invariants()
(-3, -17)
sage: R = A.maximal_order()
sage: b = R.basis()
sage: print b
(1/2 + 1/2*j, 1/2*i + 1/2*k, -1/3*j - 1/3*k, k)
sage: b[0]*b[1]
9/2*i
sage: (b[0]*b[1]).reduced_norm() 
243/4
```

But this is ok, because now the invariants are as in Pizer's paper:

```
sage: A.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(-17,-3)
sage: print A.maximal_order().basis()
(1/2 + 1/2*j, 1/2*i + 1/2*k, -1/3*j - 1/3*k, k)
```

This could be fixed by simply swapping (i,j) in the formula depending on the invariants, but the invariants can deviate from the required form in more than one way, again possibly resulting in failure of the formula:

```
sage: A.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(-17*9,-3)
sage: print A.maximal_order().basis()
(1/2 + 1/2*j, 1/2*i + 1/2*k, -1/3*j - 1/3*k, k)
sage: print (-1/3*j - 1/3*k).reduced_norm()
154/3
```

The patch does the following:

* Move `maximal_order` from `brandt.py` to `quaternion_algebra.py`.

* Fix `maximal_order` to raise a NotImplementedError if the invariants are not of the expected form

* Add checks in `*__init__*` of QuaternionOrder to verify if the given basis actually is the basis of an order (this would have catched the bug earlier).

* Fix all the doctests that were expecting the mathematically incorrect results.
