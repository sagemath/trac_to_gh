This patch adds one graph constructor and an interesting embedding for it. This one took a loooooooottt of sweat, but I'm learning a lot of tricks to create new embeddings :-)

Oh, and the patch also adds a helper method which I plan on using very often for other patches : it sets the position of some points so that they are on a circle of given center and radius.. This will *really* be useful for many embeddings `:-)`

You wrote it already ? `:-D`

I see `:-D`

by the way : you can actually space points differently with this patch. That's more or less what I did in the embedding : you create two cicles with different shifts `:-)`

Well, perhaps the _circle thing will have to be modified too.. 

And GOD, the 11cage is really something `O_o`
