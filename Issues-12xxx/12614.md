I tried your patch, and it doesn't look like it works : I still have the bzip2 and prereq sources in $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/build, although they have been built long ago.

Where is $SAGE_BUILD_DIR defined?

Shouldn't it be $BUILD, as used in the rest of the bzip2-1.0.5-install script?

Aside: is it normal that neither bzip2 nor prereq prints "Successfully installed ..." when it succeeds, as do all other spkg?

Sorry, I forgot to list #4949 as a dependency. That ticket changes `$BUILD` to `$SAGE_BUILD_DIR`.

I don't know about "normal". The issue is that most spkgs are installed by the script `sage-spkg`, but `prereq` and `bzip2` are not, because (for example) `sage-spkg` tries to bunzip spkgs, so we shouldn't use it on `bzip2`.

I know how to apply a patch, and I tested it on a just-untarred sage -- the fact that you forgot the patch dependency is definitely the reason why it failed. I'm not sure I'll have the time to give it another go right now.

Notice that I generally untar tar.* (and spkg) files with "tar xaf <filename>" -- the 'a' meaning 'automatic decompression method', so I don't have to tell it what to do (no xzf, no xjf).

If that 'a' switch is available in the tar implementation of all sage platforms :
* sage-spkg could use that switch (instead of the complicated "bunzip2 | tar" it uses now;
* bzip2 could be made an almost-normal spkg, just different in that it's the only one which isn't a .tar.bz2 but a .tar.gz

Wouldn't that fix that bug nicely too?

<div id="comment:5" align="right">Comment 5</div>

I'm really not sure the 'a' option is standard ; and  the might not be either, so indeed one probably has to use the bunzip2 | tar trick :-/

Still, the current sage-spkg does :

```
bunzip2 -c "$PKG_SRC" 2>/dev/null | tar fx${UNTAR_VERBOSE} -  2>/dev/null
if [ ! -d "$PKG_NAME" ]; then
    tar fx${UNTAR_VERBOSE} "$PKG_SRC"
fi
```

but perhaps it could do :

```
tar fx${UNTAR_VERBOSE} "$PKG_SRC"
if [ ! -d "$PKG_NAME" ]; then
  tar fxz${UNTAR_VERBOSE} "$PKG_SRC"
fi

if [ ! -d "$PKG_NAME" ]; then
  bunzip2 -c "$PKG_SRC" 2>/dev/null | tar fx${UNTAR_VERBOSE} -  2>/dev/null
fi
```

That way it could handle three levels of compressions -- and if bzip2 is the first package it meets, then it could handle it, and then the rest of the packages would work with the last step.
