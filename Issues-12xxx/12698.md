As we found out in [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/12369#comment:189](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/12369#comment:189), you cannot use the Sage shell to install Sage packages.

The problem is that `sage-env` has some conditional commands.  One of these commands is setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.  With #12405, only existing directories are added to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.  Upon entering the Sage shell, `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` might not exist yet, so that directory isn't added. Since now `SAGE_ENV_SOURCED=1`, the variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not changed anymore.  Similarly, `PYTHONHOME` and `PYTHONPATH` are only set when Python has been installed.

This ticket is about adding a warning when running `sage --sh`.  After the patch:

```
$ ./sage --sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

The comment about not running `make` seems to conflict with the error message in `sage-spkg`:

```
Instead, the following commands setup all environment variables
correctly and load a subshell for you to debug the error:
  (cd '`pwd`' && '$SAGE_ROOT/sage' -sh)
When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the subshell.
```
(It's not clear what should be done to "debug the error", but running `make` seems like a natural thing to do.)  Not running `sage -i ...` makes sense, but can you clarify the issue about running `make`?

I meant Sage's top-level "make" (or "make" inside `SAGE_ROOT/spkg` with #10492).  Running "make" inside a spkg directory is fine, and indeed one is encouraged to use the Sage shell for that.

So the wording should be improved.
