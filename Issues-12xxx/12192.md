<a id='comment:5'>**Comment 5:**</a>
A few things:

- Add `fpickle` documentation by modifying `misc.rst`.

- Remove the second colon `:` from `pickle_code()`.

- Use automatic trac linking <code>:trac:\`11716\`</code>.

- Use <code>\`\`None\`\`</code> in code format in the documentation (only place I see this not used it in `unpickleMethod()` inputs)

Thanks.

See #11845. Pickling involving python code objects are problematic, because python code objects do not give the same portability guarantees that proper pickling requires. It can still be very useful, though, and the code on that ticket is a bit more robust in the face of closures etc. Perhaps evaluate how much of #11845 we want and merge these two tickets?
