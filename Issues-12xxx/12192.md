<a id='comment:5'></a>A few things:

- Add `fpickle` documentation by modifying `misc.rst`.

- Remove the second colon `:` from `pickle_code()`.

- Use automatic trac linking `:trac:`11716``.

- Use ```None``` in code format in the documentation (only place I see this not used it in `unpickleMethod()` inputs)

Thanks.
