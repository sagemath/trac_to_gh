This is looks great, but here are some (relatively minor) gripes:

- In the changes to integer.pyx, the variable "broken" is assigned to but never used. 

- The patchbot is grumbling about some lines with trailing whitespace.

- There are some TeX formulae marked with $ signs rather than backticks.

- The docstring for `fetch_int` in the cython file has been rewritten and is now much more comprehensible, but the docstring for the same function in the new python file is still the old rather confusing one.

- Given that you've put in the work to Sphinxify the docstrings, maybe we should add the new python file `finite_field_ntl_gf2e.py` to the reference manual? (This might be better off on a new ticket, since it makes no sense to have some backends and not others in the reference manual, and doing the others will be lots of work.)

- A brief docstring for `cdef class Cache_ntl_gf2e(SageObject):` would be nice, explaining briefly why the class exists.
