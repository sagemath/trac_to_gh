For integers modulo n there is a `rational_reconstruction` method:

```
sage: R = IntegerModRing(97)
sage: a = R(2) / R(3)
sage: a.rational_reconstruction()
2/3
```
However for polynomials the corresponding method is named
`rational_reconstruct`:

```
sage: K.<x> = R[]            
sage: x.rational_reconstruct(x,4,4)
(0, 1)
```
The naming is incoherent.

doesn't work for me. The example fails. Is `.lift()` necessary? 

In the header of the docstring, "to its parent" seems wrong. You meant P for the quotient ring P/m? I think it is called "cover (ring)" but I am not sure. Certainly it is not "parent".
