Problem:

I got a pre-built 10.6 Sage from here: [http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http://wstein.org/home/wstein/tmp/sage-4.7.3.alpha1-x86_64-Darwin.dmg&usg=AFQjCNGZr8xE-ECiC8ecV7TPI5nOamLiNQ](http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http://wstein.org/home/wstein/tmp/sage-4.7.3.alpha1-x86_64-Darwin.dmg&usg=AFQjCNGZr8xE-ECiC8ecV7TPI5nOamLiNQ).  Even though I'm on Lion, this installs and runs correctly.
But when I tried `./sage -b`, it fails when compiling `devel/sage/misc/darwin_memory_usage.c`.

Details:

The error is that that file contains the line `#include <mach/task_info.h>`, which, on Lion, assumes that the symbol `vm_extmod_statistics_data_t` has already been defined.

Fix:

To define that symbol, we need to first `#include <mach/vm_statistics.h>`.  It is simple to insert such a line at the beginning of `darwin_memory_usage.c`, right before the first `#include`.  Doing so fixes the problem.  See tiny attached patch.  Jason Grout was kind enough to test the same change on his 10.6 machine, and verify that the change doesn't screw up the build there.

Looks good for OSX 10.6 (since sage -b is successful with this change and then sage starts up).  Someone with 10.7 should probably also review this.
