Does this just mean defining coxeter_diagram in the files type_H.py and friends ?

I forgot actually, but yes, I guess so!

We will also want a CoxeterDiagram to be a valid cartan type as well (I don't know what's the status there), but that might be for another ticket.

In sage 6.2.beta3:

```
sage: H3 = CartanType(['H',3])
sage: H3.coxeter_diagram()
Graph on 3 vertices
sage: I7 = CartanType(['I',7])
sage: I7.coxeter_diagram()
Graph on 2 vertices
```
So maybe this ticket could be closed ?
