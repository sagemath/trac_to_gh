Matrices over `QQ` do not have a method `LLL(...)` like matrices over `ZZ`. Here is a simple implementation:

1. get rid of the denominator
2. call the `LLL` method of integer matrices
3. set the denominator back.

Note: in previous version it was suggested that such an approach might be useful for matrices over `RR`. But it is not completely clear how to do that efficiently.

No. A strategy could be the following: For matrices over `QQ` you can multiply by the least common multiple of all denominators to get a matrix over `ZZ`, then apply LLL, and then scale back. For matrices over the reals (which are of finite precision), do also some scaling to get an integer-matrix.

It would definitely be good to have this!  For QQ, the proposed strategy obviously works.  For RR, it probably needs some thought what sort of scaling to do here.  For instance, if the matrix has very large as well as very small entries.

For RR there is no perfect way to do this; the inexact nature of floating point arithmetic can make things extremely unpleasant.

Andy suggested the following.   Scale and round the input matrix so that the largest entry has about 300 (or so?) bits.  Then augment it with the identity matrix and perform LLL on the augmented matrix.  The augmented part then contains the basis transformation that has to be performed.  Perform this transformation on the input matrix and repeat the procedure until things do not improve anymore (e.g. when the largest entry doesn't decrease anymore).

This sounds good as a general idea, but may fail big time in specific cases, for instance if the input L is an orthogonal sum L1 + L2 with L1 generated by very small vectors and L2 consisting of very large vectors.
