Using sage-4.8

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: I = R*[x^2-y, 2*y]
sage: J = R*[x^2+y, 2*y]
```

`I` and `J` are visibly the same ideal, but Sage finds different reduced Groebner bases:

```
sage: I.groebner_basis()
[x^2 - y, 2*y]
sage: J.groebner_basis()
[x^2 + y, 2*y]
sage: I == J   // should say True
False
```

Depends on #12802

Correct me if I am wrong, but you cannot have a reduced Groebner basis over a ring that is not a field. Besides, the ideals are *not* the same, even if their varieties are.

Singular seems to feel this way:

* Singular is computing the basis.
* According to Remark 1.6.14 in *A **Singular** Introduction to Commutative Algebra*, if you want to compute a *standard basis over a ring* which is merely Noetherian (not necessarily a field, as in Definition 1.6.1), you need to have agreement of leading *terms* (which includes coefficients), not leading *monomials*.
* See this answer in [the Singular forums](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1750&p=2349&hilit=std+integer#p2349).

Macaulay also feels this way:

* I installed Macaulay2, computed groebner bases for both I and J, and got the same thing singular computes.
* Macaulay2's [webpage](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.4/share/doc/Macaulay2/Macaulay2Doc/html/_simple_sp__Groebner_spbasis_spcomputations_spover_spvarious_springs.html) implies the same.

Unless I'm wrong, this is not a bug.

*Edit:* I had ring and field switched in the first sentence.

This was a dumb thing to say, & I had doubts almost immediately after hitting the Submit button. In fact, Macaulay2 recognizes I==J, even though it computes different gb's. Singular does not recognize this.

Hello

I'm still of the opinion that what I wrote about reduced Groebner bases in integer rings is correct, given the behavior of Singular and Macaulay2.

That said, the incorrect conclusion that `I != J` is easily fixed, using the algorithm I outlined. I have uploaded a patch to #12802 that does precisely this.

Assuming that what I've done there is correct, is there a way to mark this patch as a duplicate, or something similar?
