It would be useful to have a system-wide default plotting color.  For example, when embedding in latex, you want all the default line colors that are now blue to be black instead.

This patch implements a sage.plot.colors.DEFAULTCOLOR variable that is used, instead of specifying blue in every object.

This patch avoids touching objects that don't have the default color blue so that it won't be very controversial.  Cleaning up the graphics in Sage is a much bigger project...

```

       Parses the color.
    
       It transforms a valid color string into a color object and a color
       object into an RBG tuple of length 3. Otherwise, it multiplies the
       info by the base color.
    
```

On the other issue - before:

```
sage: [t.color for t in G.texture_set()]
[RGB color (1.0, 0.0, 0.0), RGB color (1.0, 0.0, 0.0), RGB color (1.0, 1.0, 0.0)]
```
after:

```
sage: [t.color for t in G.texture_set()]
[(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0, 0.0)]
```
This really won't break anything in the initialization of `Texture` where this is used?

---
Also, I just found a doctest typo, unnoticed because of the fact that `Texture` pretty much takes any input without complaining.  You didn't do this, but we should fix it here.

```

        sage: Texture(ambiant=0.7)
        Texture(texture..., 6666ff)
```

I'm waffling about whether I should back out the texture changes (I don't have time now to dive deeply into the 3d plotting).  What do you think?  I can just put an extra test in there that returns the default color if no color is passed in.

I've attached a patch which takes care of the typo and docs.

I think that is the easier solution for now.  I assume that most people wouldn't care, but I think there was some method to the way it's returned, so that the same parsing function could be used in a few different contexts.  I don't know whether `parse_color` is used outside of the initialization of `Texture`, but I think it would be unfortunate for attributes of `Texture`s to change format without discussion somewhere by someone who uses them.

If you do change that back, please give the new patch a different name, because then we have this other fix still on Trac for easy reference later.

> I've attached a patch which takes care of the typo and docs.

Except there was a typo there from before this ticket which I just noticed.  Aargh!

```
What is RBG, kcrisman?  Silly... This would be needed no matter how you deal with `parse_color`.
