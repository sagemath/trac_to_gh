Nils -- I'm using sage-4.8.alpha5. 

1. I'm good with series as the name

2. I would like timings to always be in seconds (?), since otherwise it could be confusing to compare.  Is that what happens now?  Or are you proposing they *not* be in seconds?

3. I just copied your example in which you used "mean"...  but using something else might be useful. 

There's a lot of good ideas on sage-devel.  I could even see adding a "warm_up" option to timeit, where it runs something else first to warm things up and improve timing quality.
