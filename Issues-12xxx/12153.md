Hm, seems that between 4.7.1 and 4.7.2 there have been some changes to sage_timeit. The patch doesn't apply for me. Just a few thoughts:
* is "series" the right name? the compatibility with `stats.TimeSeries` seems to suggest so.
* should "series" be scaled with the units `s.stats[4]` ?
* don't use "mean" to illustrate statistics possibilities. "median" is almost certainly more meaningful since it doesn't depend on a metric, only on ordering. It is less sensitive to crazy outliers.

Nils -- I'm using sage-4.8.alpha5. 

1. I'm good with series as the name

2. I would like timings to always be in seconds (?), since otherwise it could be confusing to compare.  Is that what happens now?  Or are you proposing they *not* be in seconds?

3. I just copied your example in which you used "mean"...  but using something else might be useful. 

There's a lot of good ideas on sage-devel.  I could even see adding a "warm_up" option to timeit, where it runs something else first to warm things up and improve timing quality.

Works for me on 4.6.alpha6 on sage.math. It can be made fancier of course, but the present patch already provides the basic functionality.
