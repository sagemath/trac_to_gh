```
sage: is_Monoid(ZZ)   # not technical math meaning of monoid 
False
```

Does this work for any set-like objects? Wouldn't it depend on the operation?

I think this gives the wrong impression (if I read it correctly) that the test fails due to a technicality rather than because the test simply doesn't make sense.

There are binary operations that make ZZ a monoid, right?

The comment is "# not technical math meaning of monoid".   Perhaps a clearer comment would be:

```
   "The technical math meaning of monoid has no bearing whatsoever on the result: it's a typecheck which is not satisfied by ZZ since it does not inherit from Monoid_class."

That's even better. In hindsight, I see that the original comment was intended read "this does not test whether or not ZZ is mathematically a monoid." I missed it the first time around, though, so better to make it explicit for the next guy.

Your patch applies on 5.0.beta2 without problem. The tests pass. I added a review patch that:

- adds an entry in /doc/en/reference/monoids.rst to appear in the doc,
- changes the title "Base class for all monoids" to "Monoids", to be coherent with other titles of the page in the doc (Free Monoids, ...),
- change the comment for is_Monoid(ZZ) according to the previous discussion,
- replaces some """ to r""" (in case some latex appear next),
- formats the variables,
- removes trailing spaces.

As for me, it is ok to consider the ticket as solved. If you agree with the changes, i let you add a positive review.
