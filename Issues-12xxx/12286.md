The docstring for the global `factorial` function claims that an optional keyword `algorithm` can be specified, but currently this raises an error.

...
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
```

```
sage: factorial(10, algorithm='gmp')
...
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
```
