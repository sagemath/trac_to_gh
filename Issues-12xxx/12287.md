Example:

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: A = np.random.randint(2,size=(2,2))
sage: B = matrix(QQ,A)
sage: B.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring
```

Expected result would be matrix over the rationals:

```
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
```

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
In sage/matrix/constructor.py line 606 (sage-4.7.2):

```
    if isinstance(args[0], numpy.ndarray):
```
If this is true, then the ring argument to matrix() will be ignored
and <numpy array>.dtype determines the ring for the matrix. F.ex:

```
   elif str_dtype.count('int') == 1:
                    m = matrix(ZZ, [list(row) for row in list(num_array)])
```
