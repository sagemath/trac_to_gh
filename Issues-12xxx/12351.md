Using sage-4.7.2

```
sage: P = Poset([[1,2],[4],[3],[4],[]])
sage: P(0) == int(0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'parent'
```

This error is raised when ploting a poset :

```
sage: m = WordMorphism('a->abb,b->ba')
sage: w = m.fixed_point('a')
sage: prefix = Word(list(w[:100]))
sage: pals = prefix.palindromes()
sage: poset = Poset((pals, lambda x,y: x.is_factor(y)))
sage: H = poset.hasse_diagram()
sage: H.plot()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'parent'
```

The problem was in the comparison of poset elements. Comparing a poset element with any object that has no parent (for example, comparison with a Python int) resulted in an error.

I thought the straight forward way to fix it is: Use `sage.structure.element.parent(bla)` instead of `bla.parent()`.

With the patch, plotting the Hasse diagram  works, and the bug fix is doctested. Needs review, then!

Great!

I tested it (on sage-4.7.2) and it solves the problem. All tests pass on `sage/combinat` repository. Documentation builds fine. Positive review.

But now, I get another problem. When the package `sage -i dot2tex` is installed the method `layout_graphviz` gets called by `plot` and it seems broken for another reason. But this should be another ticket :

```
sage: H.plot()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'iteritems'
```

which is also obtained by doing

```
sage: H.layout_graphviz()    # require dot2tex
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'iteritems'
```

Since #10998 does not touch the `__eq__` method, I suggest that one first checks whether the bug triggered by comparing a poset element with a Python int is really fixed by #10998.

I just tested that the error vanishes with #10998. From that point of view, one could suggest that the ticket be resolved as duplicate.

On the other hand, having `parent(bla)` instead of `bla.parent()` is another layer of security and won't hurt.

I leave the decision to you.

I don't mind. In case we go for it, we might as well use "sage.structure.sage_object.have_same_parent".

Attachment [trac_12351-doctest.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12351/trac_12351-doctest.patch) by @loefflerd created at 2012-03-12 21:28:51

The new code from #10998 already uses `have_same_parent`. So all that's left to do here is to add a doctest to prevent the error happening again. I've uploaded a patch for that.
