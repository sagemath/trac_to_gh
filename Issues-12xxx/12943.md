If rho and mu are partitions, rho/mu is supposed to return the skew partition rho/mu.  It tries to check that mu is of the right shape for it to be able to do this, but it does this check using the dominates() method, which tests dominance order not inclusion order.  This is not so serious, in that if rho contains mu, then it does also dominate mu, so it will always let correct calculations go through.  The error is then caught by SkewPartition, which realizes it's been handed invalid data.  So this is not actually so bad.  

However, the same thing happens when T is a tableau and you calculate T/mu, and there, it causes a "list index out of range". 

```
sage: rho = Partition((3,2,1))
sage: mu = Partition((2,1,1,1))
sage: rho/mu
ValueError: invalid skew partition: [[3, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1, 1]]

sage: t=Tableau([[1,2,3],[4,5],[6]])
sage: t/mu                         
IndexError: list index out of range
```

Hi Andrew--

I improved the grammar as you requested.  I also realized that I had somehow gotten things out of order in the tableau patch -- it was checking that the inputs were sensible after it had started processing them, rather than before.  I fixed this too.  I would therefore prefer that you set the positive review yourself, if you don't mind.  

Thanks for reviewing this.  I apologize for wasting everyone's time with this ticket, which is a rather minuscule improvement.  I will try to restrain myself from indulging in similar tidying impulses in the future.  

cheers,

Hugh

I usually prefer separate tickets for separate issues, which is much easier to review (but needs slightly more effort for the author).

Hi Hugh.

The patch looks good. I ran tests with the initial patch -- they passed -- but haven't done retested the patch. The patchbot doesn't seem to want to run the tests for me either and I am not sure how to make it do so.

Assuming that the tests all pass, I give it a positive review.

Also, I agree with Nicolas and Jeroen that large patches should be avoided (even though I seem to have mainly large patches in the queue...)

Andrew

For the patchbot:

Apply  trac_12943-skew-partition-construction-bug-ht.patch

Thanks, Andrew!

I tried to run the patchbot on my machine, but didn't do it right, which is the explanation for the red blob that has appeared.  I will try to do it again, right, and make the red blob go away.
