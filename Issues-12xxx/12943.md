# Issue 12943: Tableau_class.__div__,  Partition_class.__div__ are checking domination when they should check inclusion

If rho and mu are partitions, rho/mu is supposed to return the skew partition rho/mu.  It tries to check that mu is of the right shape for it to be able to do this, but it does this check using the dominates() method, which tests dominance order not inclusion order.  This is not so serious, in that if rho contains mu, then it does also dominate mu, so it will always let correct calculations go through.  The error is then caught by SkewPartition, which realizes it's been handed invalid data.  So this is not actually so bad.  

However, the same thing happens when T is a tableau and you calculate T/mu, and there, it causes a "list index out of range". 

```
sage: rho = Partition((3,2,1))
sage: mu = Partition((2,1,1,1))
sage: rho/mu
ValueError: invalid skew partition: [[3, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1, 1]]

sage: t=Tableau([[1,2,3],[4,5],[6]])
sage: t/mu                         
IndexError: list index out of range

Hi Hugh.

The patch looks good. I ran tests with the initial patch -- they passed -- but haven't done retested the patch. The patchbot doesn't seem to want to run the tests for me either and I am not sure how to make it do so.

Assuming that the tests all pass, I give it a positive review.

Also, I agree with Nicolas and Jeroen that large patches should be avoided (even though I seem to have mainly large patches in the queue...)
