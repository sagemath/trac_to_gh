I took sage-5.0.beta9, replaced the ppl package by the one from #12672, added the cloog-ppl package from #12666, replaced the glpk package by the one from #12703, added a new libelf spkg, added the mpc and gcc spkgs from #12369 and modified the gcc spkg such that the gcc is built with support of loop optimization (graphite) and lto.

Then, I tried to build Sage with rather high optimization:

```
king@mpc622:/mnt/local/king/SAGE/testinggcc/lto/sage-5.0.beta9$ echo $CFLAGS
-O3 -march=native -floop-interchange -floop-strip-mine -floop-block -fno-strict-aliasing -flto
king@mpc622:/mnt/local/king/SAGE/testinggcc/lto/sage-5.0.beta9$ echo $CXXFLAGS
-O3 -march=native -floop-interchange -floop-strip-mine -floop-block -fno-strict-aliasing -flto
king@mpc622:/mnt/local/king/SAGE/testinggcc/lto/sage-5.0.beta9$ echo $LDFLAGS
-flto
```

It was needed to temporarily remove `-flto` in order to build Singular (see #12738). Later, R failed to build - see this [install log](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/SAGE/install_logs/r-2.14.0.p2.log).

<a id='comment:1'></a>I don't know R at all. In particular, in contrast to Singular at #12738, I did not look at the source code and have no idea how compiler or linker flags are dealt with in R.

What I find suspicious in the log is that only "gcc" is named in lines such as

```
gcc -std=gnu99 -Wl,--export-dynamic -fopenmp  -L/mnt/local/king/SAGE/testinggcc/lto/sage-5.0.beta9/local/lib/ -flto -o R.bin Rmain.o -L../../lib -lR 
```
Can we be sure that really the "correct" gcc, namely the one in `SAGE_LOCAL/...` created by the gcc spkg is used? Namely, my system gcc does not support LTO.

I don't understand: At what point do I need to provide `-fuse-linker-plugin`? It has not been part of my C(XX)FLAGS and has not been a configuration option to the gcc from the spkg, it I recall correctly.

Sorry, now I recall your comments from #12703, where you say that some (not all) packages would need `-fuse-linker-plugin` added to `LDFLAGS` in order to work with -lto.

However, how problematic is that my ld is slightly too old? Would it refuse to work with `-fuse-linker-plugin`?  Will it ignore that flag?

I guess Sage shouldn't also add another 60MB or so for a binutils spkg, isn't it?

Explicitly specifying `-fuse-linker-plugin` seems to only be necessary in case you updated binutils (or your `ld`, or used some older version during the GCC build) after building GCC.

From the GCC manual:

  `-fuse-linker-plugin`

    Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time optimization. This option relies on the linker plugin support in linker that is available in gold or in GNU ld 2.21 or newer.

    This option enables the extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing more code to the link-time optimizer. This information specifies what symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic linking). Resulting code quality improvements on binaries (and shared libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar to `-fwhole-program`. See `-flto` for a description of the effect of this flag and how to use it.

    This option is enabled by default when LTO support in GCC is enabled and GCC was configured for use with a linker supporting plugins (GNU ld 2.21 or newer or gold).




It's IMHO a minor issue anyway.




> However, how problematic is that my ld is slightly too old? Would it refuse to work with `-fuse-linker-plugin`?  Will it ignore that flag?


Nope, GCC will exit with an error *if you specify `-fuse-linker-plugin`* but the present linker doesn't support it.



 
> I guess Sage shouldn't also add another 60MB or so for a binutils spkg, isn't it?


We need a standard LaTeX / TeXLive package, too. ;-)

No, seriously, we could of course also offer an *optional* binutils package, but that's not that important, although the GCC package may refuse to build on systems with too incapable versions of the programs provided by binutils.
