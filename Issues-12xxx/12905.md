Geoff reported on http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1170/memory-blowup-with-milp memory leaks in Sage. Turns out there were two to solve, and one of them was fixed in #12903.
The other one comes from Cliquer and is solved with this patch. Here's what it does :

* Solves memory leaks reported by Geoff
* Incidentally updates Cliquer to version 1.21
* Incidentally removes Sage's code that was formerly directly inserted in the original Cliquer files. This code is now inserted during the SPKG installation from patches located in the SPKG's patches/ folder. 

As a result, no one should be scared anymore of running the following lines :

```
for i in range(2000):
    print get_memory_usage()
    _ = graphs.RandomGNP(30,.2).cliques_maximum()
```

```
for i in range(2000):
    print get_memory_usage()
    _ = graphs.RandomGNP(30,.2).clique_number()
```

```
for i in range(2000):
    print get_memory_usage()
    _ = graphs.RandomGNP(30,.2).clique_maximum()
```
Apply:
* [attachment:trac_12905.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12905/trac_12905.patch)

Install the new version of Cliquer:
* http://www.steinertriples.fr/ncohen/cliquer-1.21.p0.spkg

Depends on #13188

OK, the method for installing the package is

`sage -i <package.spkg>`

or when the package is already installed (as for cliquer):

`sage -f <package.spkg>`


The patch is working perfectly and the memory usage remains constant. Excellent! I give positive review.

The spkg should be rebased on cliquer-1.2.p11.spkg (which is in sage-5.1 or later).

Also: normally, the version number of your spkg should be cliquer-1.21.p0.spkg (not p11).
