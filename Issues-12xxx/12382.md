Graphics3d.tachyon and Graphics3d.mtl_str both join string representations of the textures in Graphics3d.texture_set().  The order of elements pulled out of texture_set() can be different.

I'm not quite sure why this happens - all is fine with or without on Mac, I know `set` is system-dependent? - but this definitely is a good fix and it's correct in the doctest.  Can you tell me where it *didn't* work?  I assume this was discovered due to a doctest failure, but it must have been on an uncommon platform, perhaps?

Anyway, modulo that, positive review.

Ok, but I mean on what platform?  I'm concerned to try to test that this works properly everywhere.  Any other details would be helpful.

It was on OS X 10.6, but using different doctesting code (that hasn't been posted to #12415 yet).  Currently I don't know of any platforms where this problem arises.  The objective of this ticket is to make #12415 less of a patch-bomb.  :-)
