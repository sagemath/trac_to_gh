See [this sage-release thread and posts by Marco Streng](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/7a3905744b6c6e9f).   This bug is caused by #10923.

sage -t -only-optional=magma 
"devel/sage/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py" 
was fine on beta2, but fails on beta3. This file has no magma doctests, 
but does have mathematica and maple doctests. The issue seems to be 
related to the doctesting framework, but I don't see any relevant 
tickets mentioned below. Could someone check whether this test works for 
them? 
Here's the traceback: 
sage -t -only-optional=magma 
"devel/sage/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py" 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
   File "/storage/marco/sage-5.0.beta3/local/bin/sage-doctest", line

This is verified on several systems.

I think the count is still wrong. I added a print statement to sage-doctest that lists the lines and the corresponding modifiers:

```
    print "Printing lines and their modifiers"
    for i in range(len(t)):
        print "\n ========\n line:"
        print t[i]
        print "---\n comment:"
        print comment_modifiers[i]
    print "in total, there were %s lines with %s modifiers" % (len(t), len(comment_modifiers))
    print "remaining lines:"
    print t[len(comment_modifiers):]
    print "remaining modifiers:"
    print comment_modifiers[len(t):]
```
Lines with tol give a mismatch, even with the patch.

As a consequence, the following file passes all tests with `sage -t -only-optional=magma`, while it should fail!

```
def dummy():
    """

    Test whether or not optional doctests and `abs tol` get along.


        sage: 1+1 # rel tol 1e-10
        2
        sage: 2+2 # optional - requires magma and is wrong
        1

    """
    pass
```
(13 lines, 15 modifiers, and the magma modifiers ended up on empty lines at the end, hence the pass with `-only-optional=magma`)

The file fails the test with `sage -t -optional`, as that runs all lines, regardless of modifiers. The file passes the test with `sage -t`.

If you have a doctest marked "# optional - requires magma and is wrong", then it is *supposed* to only get tested if you run something like

```
sage -t --only-optional=requires,magma,and,is,wrong ...
```
Actually, there is a bug so it only gets tested if you run

```
sage -t --only-optional=requiresmagmaandiswrong ...
```
In any case, it's not surprising that your file passed doctests: the optional doctest wasn't run, because you didn't give the right command-line flags.

When I try your file with

```
sage -t --only-optional=requiresmagmaandiswrong ...
```
I get a doctest failure.

See #11615 for a fix to make `--only-optional=requires,magma,and,is,wrong` work; the patch there also allows you to omit "requires" from this list.

<a id='comment:16'>**Comment 16:**</a>
**Attachment:** [trac_12493.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12493/trac_12493.patch.gz)

All tests pass with the patch. But since this changes the doctesting framework, I needed to construct a doctest that is supposed to fail, and check whether it gives the correct failures. This made me stumble upon many problems with tol in doctesting.

Take this example:

```
"""
EXAMPLES:

The name blah is undefined::

    sage: blah+blah
    blahblah

Here's a doctest that is out of tolerance::

    sage: 100+10000000000 # abs tol 0.1
    10000000000
    sage: 1+1
    2
"""
```
The output when doctesting is

```
File "/home/marco/sage-5.0.beta11/small.sage", line 6:
    sage: blah+blah
Out of tolerance 10000000000.0 vs 10000000100.0
```
So the out of tolerance is mentioned for the wrong test. And the error of the test "blah+blah" is not even listed.

It gets worse if you remove the part that says

```
    sage: 1+1
    2
```
Then the python file produced for doctesting has a syntax error due to a blank line after the tolerance output.

```
  File "/home/marco/.sage//tmp/small_8271.py", line 63
    ... ''', res, 0.1, 'ab
```
Any test with tolerance followed by a blank line will produce a syntax error and end the doctesting of the whole file.

I guess I will have to work harder to find a set of doctests that avoids these issues, but still adequately tests whether [attachment:trac_12493.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12493/trac_12493.patch) is a good idea.
