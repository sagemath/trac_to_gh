I am afraid I cannot accept that. You are mistaken in thinking the function should have been `void`

```
static int rec01(INT ni, OP vec)
/* to compute number of partitions */
{
    INT erg = OK;
    if (ni<0) return;
    if (not EMPTYP(S_V_I(vec,ni))) return;
    else if (ni<=1) M_I_I(1,S_V_I(vec,ni));
    else {

        INT m,og;
        og = ni/3+3;
        m_i_i(0,S_V_I(vec,ni));

        for (m=1;m<og;m++)
        {
            INT j;
            j = ni-m*(3*m-1)/2;
            if (j<0) break;
            if (m%2==0) { ADDINVERS_APPLY(S_V_I(vec,j));
                          ADD_APPLY(S_V_I(vec,j),S_V_I(vec,ni));
                          ADDINVERS_APPLY(S_V_I(vec,j));
                        }
            else          ADD_APPLY(S_V_I(vec,j),S_V_I(vec,ni));
            j = ni-m*(3*m+1)/2;
            if (j<0) break;
            if (m%2==0) { ADDINVERS_APPLY(S_V_I(vec,j));
                          ADD_APPLY(S_V_I(vec,j),S_V_I(vec,ni));
                          ADDINVERS_APPLY(S_V_I(vec,j));
                        }
            else          ADD_APPLY(S_V_I(vec,j),S_V_I(vec,ni));
            }
        }
    ENDR("internal:rec01");
}
```
The error here is in thinking that there is only a couple of instances of `return;` in the function and that you reach the end of it without a `return`. But `ENDR` is a macro defined in `macro.h`

```
#define ENDR(a) endr_ende: if (erg != OK) EDC(a); return erg;
```
So you have a final `return` of an integer value. It is just hidden. By default `gcc` converts the `return;` statements to `return 0;` in that case and that's what we should do.

And we don't want to add that flag to `spkg-install`.
