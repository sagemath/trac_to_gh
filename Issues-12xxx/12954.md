The OSX binary sage-5.0-OSX-64bit-10.6-x86_64-Darwin.dmg dies in MPFR on Core 2 Duo processors.  This is because the MPIR spkg only checks `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` on Linux systems.

### mpir-2.4.0.p4 (Jeroen Demeyer, 26 May 2012)
* Trac #12954: when SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes on systems which don't support
  --enable-fat, compile a generic binary (not assuming any particular
  CPU) by passing the output of configfsf.guess to the --build option
  of ./configure.
* Disable SAGE_FAT_BINARY when bootstrapping GCC.
* Rename MPIR_EXTRA_OPTS to MPIR_CONFIGURE.
* Add configure options directly to MPIR_CONFIGURE, no longer use
  SAGE_CONF_OPTS for this.
* When user specifies CFLAGS, append them to MPIR's flags instead of
  completely replacing MPIR's flags.
* Remove $default_cflags and get_processor_specific_cflags().

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

Can you disassemble to see which instruction failed?

This MPFR binary was built with

```
-Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -O2 -m64 -march=corei7 -mtune=corei7 
```

MPIR was built with

```
-O2 -m64 -march=corei7 -mtune=corei7
```

So, SAGE_FAT_BINARY indeed doesn't work as it should.

If you tell me how to do that (explicit commands) I have the offending binary on the right CPU and could at least get you a dump of the info that came out.

`SAGE_FAT_BINARY` should be synonymous with `SAGE_GENERIC_BINARY`, though for historical reasons it isn't named well. From http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html:

SAGE_FAT_BINARY - to prepare a binary distribution that will run on the widest range of target machines, set this variable to "yes"

I think right now you don't remove advanced `CFLAGS` on linux platfroms if `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` is set.

MPIR actually does support "fat binaries" in the true sense on x86 systems: building a library with code for different processors, determining at run-time which one to use.

Why do we have to set CFLAGS at all, then?

Also, is this really true? With all CFLAGS turned on won't the compiler potentially emit advanced instructions in the surrounding library code, outside of the time-critical algorithms?

The surrounding library code is compiled with basic CFLAGS, without setting `-march` at all.  But the critical routines are compiled several times for various processors.

```

popcnt is SSE4.2, so Core 2 Duo don't have it. Btw on Linux I can do 

```
[~]$ objdump -d sage/local/lib/libmpir.so | grep popcnt
   45200:	f3 4c 0f b8 04 cf    	popcnt (%rdi,%rcx,8),%r8
   45206:	f3 4c 0f b8 4c cf 08 	popcnt 0x8(%rdi,%rcx,8),%r9
[...]
```
and I believe the equivalent command on OSX would be `otool -tV`. Shouldn't we add some script to `sage -bdist` that checks for the absence of, say, SSE >= 4 instructions?

yes, that's right (except it's not .so, but .dylb)

```
$ otool -tV local/lib/libmpir.dylib | grep popcnt

> SAGE_FAT_BINARY - to prepare a binary distribution that will run on the widest range of target machines, set this variable to "yes"

That description is certainly insufficient (or, to be more precise, one shouldn't read it from right to left).  One should in general not prepare "fat" binaries on relatively new (e.g. Core i7) CPUs -- unless one knows what one's doing... ;-)

IMHO the main purpose of `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` is to avoid the use of processor-specific ("hand-written") *assembly code* (and prevent Sage from using things like `-march=native`); it's still up to the *distributor* to make sure the compiler is targeted to the *desired* CPU family (whichever that is).




Doing some "sanity check" upon `sage -bdist` isn't all bad, but of course heavily depends on what (limited) architecture a specific binary distribution is supposed to be run on.

I never liked `MPIR_EXTRA_OPTS` (for additional options to be passed to MPIR's `configure`), but it's named like this for consistency with other spkgs, i.e., historical reasons.  A couple of spkgs (or every spkg that supports such) use `${PKG_NAME}_EXTRA_OPTS`.
