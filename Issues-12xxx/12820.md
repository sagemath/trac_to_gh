```

The problem seems to be an outdated XCode version which has a broken GCC.  Building with clang instead succeeded.  Therefore, I propose to set "CC=clang" by default on OS X 10.7 or later in sage-env.

Shouldn't that currently only be done if we really (decide to) build the GCC spkg, i.e., in `spkg/install` (rather than `sage-env`)?

(Sage currently wouldn't fully build with Clang [3.x].)

Also, are all possible versions of XCode's Clang capable of building GCC?

P.S.: The new spkgs for building Sage with GCC 4.7.x (see meta-ticket #12751) also fix *part of* the issues we have with `clang`.

(The LinBox spkg at #12762 would still need work in order to build with `clang`, as it currently just adds `-fpermissive` to get around C++11 issues.)

Or in `sage-env` but depending on `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN`.

> (Sage currently wouldn't fully build with Clang [3.x].)

It doesn't build with Apple's GCC either... but you might have a point, in case somebody decides to install a custom GCC outside of Sage.

> Also, are all possible versions of XCode's Clang capable of building GCC?

I'm not sure.  But at least one person reported being able to build GCC with Apple's Clang but not with Apple's GCC.

Quoting William:

  *I dropped this [Sage 5.0.beta13] on my OS X 10.7.x laptop, didn't type anything special, typed "make ptestlong", and came back later to see "All tests passed!".  I.e., it built perfectly.*

  *Note that I've upgraded both the OS and XCode to the latest released version on this laptop.  I think this is reasonable to require by anybody building Sage from source on OS X 10.7, given that XCode is free.*

Something worth to add to the README(?) / installation instructions.

Perhaps some might have a broken [Apple] GCC, while others may have a Clang version of Apple not suited to build GCC.  Or just add that one should install the latest version of XCode on MacOS X 10.7.x, as William suggested.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A8):

Patch looks ok (and applies to beta13), I just still wonder whether that shouldn't simply be done in `spkg/install` (where also `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` is set; it isn't set anywhere else).

Is there any scenario where a script sourcing `sage-env` (or called by one which does) would need `CC=clang` if `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN=yes`, but **isn't** (indirectly) called by `spkg/install` / the "second level" `make`?  (Probably you have some further plans...)

I don't think I'm going to actually test that (on Lion), so rather "theoretical" positive review.  (If someone objects, of course feel free to revert it.)
