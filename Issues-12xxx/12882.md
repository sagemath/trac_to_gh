Your code is checking that all the off-diagonal entries in the input matrix are strictly negative.  That seems a bit over-enthusiastic.

Hi Hugh!

Thanks for bringing back my/our attention to this ticket!

I will be too busy to actively work on this patch in the next two weeks, but feel free to take it over and review/finish it if you like! I will now provide a version that you can work with (in particular, I deleted the dependency). Of course, you can as well wait until I finish the patch, if you prefer.

Best, Christian
