Hi Christian--

Your code is checking that all the off-diagonal entries in the input matrix are strictly negative.  That seems a bit over-enthusiastic.  

A doctest for the new functionality would also be good.

Hugh

Hi Hugh!

Thanks for bringing back my/our attention to this ticket!

I will be too busy to actively work on this patch in the next two weeks, but feel free to take it over and review/finish it if you like! I will now provide a version that you can work with (in particular, I deleted the dependency). Of course, you can as well wait until I finish the patch, if you prefer.

Best, Christian

Hi Travis,

This patch does not pass all of it's doctests.  Also, is it a good idea to add a note to the documentation saying that only Cartan matrices whose Cartan types are implemented in Sage are legal input?  For example, the Cartan matrix 

```
CartanMatrix([[2,-3],[-3,2]])
```
yields an error.  Can you also provide an example of inputting a Cartan matrix and an index set in the documentation?  

-Ben

I ran the tests again on `5.12.beta0` on the entire root_system folder with following patches applied:

```
applying trac_14610-LSenergy-ms.patch
applying trac9107_nesting_nested_classes.patch
applying trac_9107_fix_cross_reference.patch
applying trac_14787-gyw_stats-bs.patch
applying trac_14787-pdf_fix-ts.patch
applying trac_14573-path_realizations-ts.patch
applying trac_11407-list_clone_improve-fh.patch
applying trac_14516-crystals_speedup-ts.patch
applying trac_12882-matrix_as_dynkin_diagram-ts.patch
```
All tests passed

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 235.7 seconds
    cpu time: 212.6 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 233.4 seconds
```
and in particular:

```
sage -t --long root_system/dynkin_diagram.py
    [88 tests, 0.53 s]
```
I also copied and ran those tests in Sage directly, and received the expected result:

```
sage: CII = CartanMatrix([[2, -3], [-4, 2]])
sage: DII = DynkinDiagram(CII, (-1, 'x'))
sage: DII.index_set()
('x', -1)
```
