Old versions (at least till 4.47) fail to build when link-time optimization (LTO, `gcc -flto ...`) is enabled.

While `configure` shows an error message, it continues normally and doesn't exit with an error.  Only later during the build, a shell syntax error caused by `libtool` makes the build finally fail.
 
New versions have been re-autotoolized with more recent autotools.

New versions also unconditionally use their own zlib, this is circumvented by patching in the spirit of what Red Hat does.

Finally we let GLPK build shared lib on Cygwin.

## To also motivate the upgrade:

GLPK 4.47 (release date: Sep 09, 2011)

        The new API routine `glp_intfeas1()` was added to the package.
        This routine is a tentative implementation of the integer (0-1)
        feasibility solver based on the CNF-SAT solver (which currently
        is MiniSat). It may be used in the same way as `glp_intopt()` to
        find either any integer feasible solution or a solution, for
        which the objective function is not worse than the specified
value. Detailed description of this routine can be found in the
        document *"CNF Satisfiability Problem"*, which is included in the
        distribution (see `doc/cnfsat.pdf`).

        The following two options were added to `glpsol`:

        `--minisat`        translate 0-1 feasibility problem to CNF-SAT
                           problem and solve it with `glp_intfeas1()`/MiniSat
                           (if the problem instance is already in CNF-SAT
                           format, no translation is performed)

        `--objbnd bound`   add inequality obj <= bound (minimization) or
                           obj >= bound (maximization) to 0-1 feasibility
                           problem (this option assumes `--minisat`)

        The paint-by-numbers puzzle model (`pbn.mod`) included in the
        distribution is a nice example of the 0-1 feasibility problem,
        which can be efficiently solved with `glp_intfeas1()`/MiniSat. This
        model along with a brief instruction (`pbn.pdf`) and benchmark
        examples from <webpbn.com> encoded in GNU MathProg (`*.dat`) can
        be found in subdirectory `examples/pbn/`.

        The `glpsol` lp/mip solver was modified to bypass postprocessing
        of MathProg models if the solution reported is neither optimal
        nor feasible.

        A minor bug in `examples/Makefile.am` was fixed to correctly
        build glpk in a separate directory. Thanks to Marco Atzeri
        <marco.atzeri@gmail.com> for bug report and patch.

GLPK 4.46 (release date: Aug 09, 2011)

        The following new API routines were added:

        `glp_read_cnfsat()`    read CNF-SAT problem data in DIMACS format
        `glp_check_cnfsat()`   check for CNF-SAT problem instance
        `glp_write_cnfsat()`   write CNF-SAT problem data in DIMACS format
        `glp_minisat1()`       solve CNF-SAT problem instance with MiniSat

        The routine `glp_minisat1()` is a driver to MiniSat, a CNF-SAT
        solver developed by Niklas Een and Niklas Sorensson, Chalmers
        University of Technology, Sweden. This routine is similar to
        the routine `glp_intopt()`, however, it is intended to solve a 0-1
        programming problem instance, which is the MIP translation of
        a CNF-SAT problem instance.

        Detailed description of these new API routines can be found in
        the document *"CNF Satisfiability Problem"*, which is included in
        the distribution (see files `doc/cnfsat.tex` and `doc/cnfsat.pdf`).

        The following new `glpsol` command-line options were added:

        `--cnf filename`      read CNF-SAT problem instance in DIMACS
                              format from filename and translate it to MIP
        `--wcnf filename`     write CNF-SAT problem instance in DIMACS
                              format to filename
        `--minisat`           solve CNF-SAT problem instance with MiniSat
                              solver

        The zlib compression library (version 1.2.5) was ANSIfied,
        modified according to GLPK requirements and included in the
        distribution as an external software module. Thus, now this
        feature is platform independent.

        Some bugs were fixed in the SQL table driver. Thanks to Xypron
        <xypron.glpk@gmx.de>.

GLPK 4.45 (release date: Dec 05, 2010)

        This is a bug-fix release.

        Several bugs/typos were fixed. Thanks to
        Xypron <xypron.glpk@gmx.de>,
        Robbie Morrison <robbie@actrix.co.nz>, and
        Ali Baharev <ali.baharev@gmail.com> for reports.

        Some glpk documents was re-formatted and merged into a single
document. Now the glpk documentation consists of the following
        three main documents (all included in the distribution):

        GLPK: Reference Manual

        GLPK: Graph and Network Routines

        Modeling Language GNU MathProg: Language Reference

I am currently making an experiment with sage-5.0.beta8:

- Use the modified ppl package from #12672
- Use the optional cloog_ppl spkg from #12666
- Use a new libelf spkg (not posted yet)
- Modify the gcc spkg from #12369 such that it is built with graphite and lto support
- Use the glpk spkg from here
- Build Sage (or at least the parts that come after the gcc spkg) with `-O2 -march=native -flto`, and perhaps in another experiment also with `-floop*`.
- Test whether -flto actually yields code that is noticeably faster in, say, `sage -testall`.

I've so far only tried with a GCC built with PPL 0.12.  With `-floop-flatten`, I get PPL errors for GSL, PALP and rubiks, and PARI's test suite fails (as well as `libs/pari/gen.pyx` if the PARI package was built with that); the other options work.

Both should be enabled by default (provided GCC finds the prerequisites); haven't looked how Jeroen configures, though.

I don't think you'll see overwhelming speedup; individual tests (and other code) might run significantly faster.

Compile time is very likely to increase, since with LTO you effectively compile twice, and object files will of course get larger.  (The GCC you build might be faster than your default one, though, so probably hard to compare.)  Also note that `-g`, i.e., meaningful debugging, is said to currently not work well with LTO.  (But *specifying* `-g` in addition doesn't lead to errors; a couple of packages add it by themselves.)

(Some packages or parts of them ignore `CFLAGS` you provide, so won't benefit from loop optimization and LTO at all.  To use LTO for *static* libraries -- upon linking to them -- as well, you need GNU `ld` >= 2.21 and have to specify `-fuse-linker-plugin`.)

Thank you for your hint! Indeed, Singular failed to build (more precisely: to link) with `C(XX)FLAGS="-O2 -march=native -flto", but did work with `-O3 -march=native`.

I'm looking forward :(

The problem seems to be that gcc does not automatically picks up the installed packages. So, my suggestion is to test in spkg-install what parts of ppl, cloog-ppl and libelf are installed, and modify the options passed to `./configure` (such as `--with-cloog=... --enable-lto`) accordingly. But this is not done yet.
 
Also, currently one can only say via an environment variable: "Build sage with the gcc spkg." But one can not say "Build cloog-ppl and libelf first!".

What I would like to see is a syntax like

```
$ make cloog_ppl libelf gcc all
```
which would automatically try to download (to be created) optional cloog_ppl and libelf spkgs, build them, then build gcc, and then proceed with the rest of Sage.

> I don't think you'll see overwhelming speedup; individual tests (and other code) might run significantly faster.

`-march=native` only resulted in 3% gain...
 
> Compile time is very likely to increase, since with LTO you effectively compile twice, and object files will of course get larger.  (The GCC you build might be faster than your default one, though, so probably hard to compare.)

The default one on my system does not support lto or graphite.

Well, if you happen to have the desired `gcc`/`g++` [first] in your `PATH` (which certainly should be the case for *Sage's* GCC), it is picked up.  But if you only set e.g. `CC=gcc-4.6.3` etc., these packages use whatever `command -v gcc` etc. yield, i.e., either the system-wide default one, or Sage's in case it is installed.




FWIW, you can of course also just copy these new spkgs into `spkg/standard/` of your preferred Sage installation.

W.r.t. `-flto` in `LDFLAGS`: You don't have to add it there for *most* packages, only some may need this in addition (also `-fuse-linker-plugin` btw.).

In any case, if you omit it, the build must not fail.  Only LTO may simply not happen.

P.S.: If the build error is reproducible with that, preferably with `MAKE="make -j1"`, as the flood of warnings already messes up the log.

Btw., parts of Singular still seem to disrespect `CXXFLAGS`, i.e., *some* C++ sources are compiled only using `CPPFLAGS`.

OK. Then, *before* changing MAKE I will add CPPFLAGS.

However, what I see in the logs is that the -flto option is *not* passed to the linker, whereas it *is* passed to the compiler. Anyway, comments would be better at #12738.

What version of autotools did you use to reconfigure the build system?
Even with quite recent ones, I still get a failing behavior...
That is a test with nm fails iduring configure, but the build goes on and fails during the final linking.

Sorry for the delay...

I *think* I meanwhile do not even have the machine I tested this on.  But the versions I used should be reproducible from the autotools-generated files [in my spkg]... ;-)

> Even with quite recent ones, I still get a failing behavior...
> That is a test with nm fails iduring configure, but the build goes on and fails during the final linking.

That pretty much sounds like the original failure.

FWIW, I don't think I ever used `-flto` as part of `CC`, "just" in `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`.

Does your linker (and compiler) at all support LTO?  (GCC version?  binutils version?)




I'll see whether I find the time to look into this again the next days; certainly not today, and presumably not tomorrow.

Ahem, from `SPKG.txt`:

```
To update the autotools[-generated] files, do the following: 
 
    cd src/ 
    libtoolize --copy --force 
    aclocal -I m4 
    autoconf 
    autoheader 
    automake --add-missing --copy 

(You'll of course need current versions of m4, libtool, autoconf and 
automake to produce files that support/work with LTO.  To check this, 
it is sufficient to try `CFLAGS="-flto" ./configure && make`; you need 
a recent version of GCC supporting LTO as well.) 

And don't forget to afterwards remove left-over temporary files: 

    make distclean 
    rm -rf autom4te.cache config.h.in~ 

(I used m4 1.4.16, libtool 2.4.2, autoconf 2.68 and automake 1.11.3 
to update the files for the glpk-4.47.p0 spkg.) -leif (03/2012)

I checked that on my systems all the autotools stuff are recent enough, so it is not the problem, unless newer version of some of these tools got broken back.

I think it is the original error you got back in 2012.
Basically looking like what I saw here:
* http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-glpk/2012-03/msg00000.html
During configure, a test involving `nm -B` parsing the output of GCC fails, and then during make:

Yep, `CFLAGS=-flto` should work, provided your compiler and linker support it (binutils at least >=2.22 should, GCC needs to be configured accordingly -- AFAIK Sage's isn't).  Not sure right now whether `LDFLAGS=-flto [-fuse-linker-plugin]` was needed, too, but in any case omitting it shouldn't cause any error.

> Or it's just that binutils 2.23 don't support LTO :)

They should.

What should I look for in `gcc -v`?
My debian's one spits:

```

FWIW, with vanilla GLPK 4.55, `CFLAGS=-flto` works for me with GCC 4.7.4, but fails with GCC 4.9.1 (both with binutils 2.22).

There've been major changes to LTO over time IIRC, so while the "new" errors are annoying, they're probably not too surprising.

But it's a minor issue anyway, and apparently meanwhile modifying `CFLAGS` is sufficient to get around the failure, as opposed to modifying the sources which previously was necessary.

You still have "GLPK Simplex Optimizer, v4.44" so it seems you have forgotten that bit. I doubt it would be caught by the tolerance. My own request would be for the version to be tested as "4....".

It works: the relative tolerance of `3e-2` is sufficient to consider 4.44 and 4.55 equal.

The statements

```
* As of version 4.55, zlib is included in the GLPK sources, and *that*
version is unconditionally compiled into the GLPK library, so there's
no "external" dependency on it
```
and

```
* zlib.patch: don't build the included zlib library.
```
seem to contradict eachother.

I think I misunderstood the tolerance. I always thought it was absolute tolerance $\Delta$x but you are saying it is relative as in $\Delta$x/x, then yes it makes it pass but it probably still should be changed.

It works for me.
It could indeed fail on system where `touch *` will de very slow and the timestamp very precise.
Trying to touch the right files by hand is a nightmare, there are just too many dependencies.
I've tried reading the magical overly complicated Makefile generated by autotools but always seemed to miss something.

Replying to [ticket:12703 leif]:
> New versions also unconditionally use their own zlib

Is this really a problem? I'm asking because this is a non-trivial patch which no longer applies against a newer GLPK (version 4.57, just released). If we don't strictly need it, I would rather remove that patch.
