This is a combinatorial implementation of the affine symmetric group, providing a second implementation of the WeylGroup(['A',k,1]), but quite a bit faster.  Also included are combinatorial implmenetations of affine types B,C,D and G.  Extension to types E and F should be possible.

It looks like that Affine Permutations really need to be integrated into the sage file system. At the moment this seems to be a stand-alone patch!

Hi Tom,

Without looking at the mathematics yet, here are some Sage specific requirements that your patch does not yet fulfill:

- You need 100% coverage:

```
$affine_permutations anne$ sage -coverage affine_permutations.py 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
affine_permutations.py
ERROR: Please add a `TestSuite(s).run()` doctest.
SCORE affine_permutations.py: 95% (46 of 48)

Missing doctests:
	 * __init__(self, parent, lst, check=True):
	 * random_element(self, n):


Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
	 * _repr_(self):
	 * check(self):
	 * lower_covers(self,side="right"):
	 * _element_constructor_(self, *args, **keywords):
	 * _repr_(self):
	 * is_crystallographic(self):
	 * _an_element_(self):
```

- The preamble of your patch needs to start with #12940: Title + then a summary of what this patch implements.

- The indents of your tests are not right for many of your methods. You need

```
    EXAMPLES::

        sage: ....
```
Look at your documentation by building it via 

```
sage -docbuild reference html
```
I can already see many places where you forgot ` for math display such as in `\ZZ`.

So much for now,

Anne

Hi Tom!

For the directory structure, you may want to follow that of permutation groups. Something like:

```
    sage/groups/affine_permutation_groups/affine_permutation.py
                                          affine_symmetric_group.py
                                          affine_permutation_group.py
```

Which just made me think: is there a way to generalize the algorithmic
for permutation groups (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_generating_set) to subgroups of
the affine symmetric group? Hmm, if this hasn't been done yet, that
could be a fun research project. Of course, the obvious first
candidates to play with would be the affine coxeter groups realized as
groups of permutations as we had discussed in Montreal.

Cheers,

Hello!

I've been trying to get this expanded and finished up.  The following changes happened lately:

* Changed the names of things to AffinePermutation and AffinePermutationGroup, because:
* I added affine permutation groups of types ABCDG.  (E and F are in Eriksson, but are ugly; I want to think about whether there's a cleaner way to go about these ones.)
* Everything is just in the file affine_permutations.py, which sits directly in sage/combinat

I'm now getting a problem I can't figure out, though: Sage is refusing to import the AffinePermutationGroup name.  It doesn't seem to be previously defined, and when I disable all of the import statements I still get an error (so it can't be an import loop; also, nothing calls my file...).  I can manually attach the file just fine, too.

I've stared at this a good long time and haven't been able to figure out what's going wrong...

Anne tries to write: Don't you mean non-twisted rather than non-exceptional? Type G is exceptional!

Hi Tom,

I just answered your question on sage-combinat. In short, you need to remove some old files left over from your /combinat/affine_permutations/ directory by hand since it gets confused about the file and the directory.

Also, to be consistent with permutation.py, core.py, etc, shouldn't your file be called affine_permutation.py (without the s)?

In the documentation of AffinePermuation you says

```
    These are combinatorial implmentations of the affine Weyl groups of
    non-exceptional type as permutations of the set of all integers.
    the basic algorithms are derived from Bjorner and Brenti's `Combinatorics
    of Coxeter Groups.'
```

Don't you mean non-twisted rather than non-exceptional. Type G is exceptional!

Best,

Anne

Hi Tom,

Here are some more comments about your patch:

-  is_i_grassmannian(i=0, side='right') needs a description of the input (like the i).

- Please explain the input of to_weyl_group_element(W=None)

- has_right_descent has a description of an option which is not there ('right' or 'left').
Same for has_left_descent.

- Everywhere in the file you seem to use OPTIONS:. This should be replaced by or combined with INPUT. Also, as far as I know the syntax is

```
- ``variable`` -- description of what it does.
```

Tom, could you make the above changes? Also, I left a review patch called trac_12940-review-as.patch on the sage-combinat queue. Please fold it into the rebased patch on the sage-combinat queue.

Thanks!

This has been discussed before, but I can't find the discussion anymore. There is some discussion at [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/944592/best-practice-for-python-assert/945135#945135](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/944592/best-practice-for-python-assert/945135#945135)

Assertions (and this is not specific to Sage or Python) are internal checks for code correctness. Don't forget that assertions can be turned off (run Python with `-O` switch) and you don't want user code to depend on whether on not assertions are enabled.

I think of assertion failures as serious as a crash due to a Segmentation Fault: it is always a bug in the program if one occurs.

Most of the assertions in this ticket should be replaced by something of the form

```
if not some_condition:
    raise ValueError("some_condition failed")
```
or `TypeError` depending on the kind of error.

Please don't use `ClonableArray` as an example, it shouldn't be using assertions that way.

Hi Jeroen,

Thank you for your comments! The asserts in the check methods of ClonableArrays/Lists seem to be in a grey area, since they are used for both the user input check as well as internal checks. Is assert ok here? If not, I would strongly suggest to change the documentation of ClonableArray to show how things are supposed to be used!

Thank you,

If this is the accepted usage of asserts vs ValueErrors in Sage, they should be written up as such in the developer's guide; there wasn't any way for me to know this was the local convention.  Additionally, a bug+patch should be made for the Cloneable Array class.

It's not a local convention, it is a general convention independent of Sage or Python. I think you will find that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)#Comparison_with_error_handling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)#Comparison_with_error_handling) mostly agrees with me.

I don't understand what you mean with this.

> It's a very, very different situation from taking user input from, say, a web form and getting an Assertion Error.

Why? What makes calling `AffinePermutationGroup()` so different from filling in a web form?

> I have, as a user, definitely used statements like ``X._test_whatever()``, which, as you say, are fine to have assert statements.

Underscored methods are supposed to be private, so you're expected to know what you're doing. Everything I said applies to using public, documented functions. Of course, everything can happen if you mess with internal data structures.

> It's not a bug in my code if buggy input fails to run.

That's perhaps a matter of opinion. Would you find it a bug in the `rm` command if it crashed with a Segmentation Fault if the file could not be found? Would you find it a bug in your web browser if it crashed every time you fill in a non-existing URL?

Perhaps this should be a `NotImplementedError`:

```
raise ValueError('Cartan type provided is not implemented as an affine permutation group.')
```
