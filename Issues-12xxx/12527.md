Before the patch:

```
    sage: sage: P = ZZ['x']
    sage: R = P.fraction_field()
    sage: %timeit R.is_exact()
    625 loops, best of 3: 3.7 µs per loop
```

After the patch:

```
    sage: R=FractionField(ZZ['x'])
    sage: %timeit R.is_exact()
    625 loops, best of 3: 485 ns per loop
```

Thank you Simon King for #11115!

This is non negligible because `is_exact` is called basically each
time an element is constructed or arithmetic is performed. Here we
have a 10% improvement on constructing an element:

Before the patch:

```
    sage: x = P.gen()
    sage: y = x+1
    sage: %timeit R(x,y,coerce=False)
    625 loops, best of 3: 17.7 µs per loop
```

After the patch:

```
    sage: x = P.gen()
    sage: y = x+1
    sage: %timeit R(x,y,coerce=False)
    625 loops, best of 3: 16 µs per loop
```
