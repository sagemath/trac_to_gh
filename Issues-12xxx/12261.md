I'm finding it hard to find any problems with this that aren't nearly trivial.  Comments that may or may not warrant addressing:
* Typo 

  ```
  The has of this element 
  ```
* `def __compat(self, other):` removed because...?  (I assume this is obvious to someone familiar with this code, but they haven't reviewed this.)
* I really like that you actually mention that the doctests are indirect when they are.  We need to do that more.
* You got 'em:

```
$ ../../sage -coverage ../../devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_ext_pari.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------
../../devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_ext_pari.py
SCORE ../../devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_ext_pari.py: 100% (31 of 31)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
   and testing seems fine.
* Although not really part of this ticket, one *could* add this to the reference manual; if so, might as well change `See self.square_root()` to <code>See :meth:\`square_root\`</code> or whatever the right syntax is.
* Really picky; is it Pari or pari, officially?  I feel like this was unified at some point in our docs.
* There is a typo that has nothing to do with this ticket but should be fixed - `probabalistic`
 
Let me know what you want to deal with on a refresh (probably at least the typos) and otherwise this should go in.

That's ok.    Patch is fine.

I don't feel comfortable giving final positive review because of the `__compat` issue - again, I'm sure this is obvious to those in the know, but I don't want to be responsible for removing a function it turns out is crucial to someone (even an underscore function).

Also (less crucially) now I realize that I think the [folks in Bordeaux](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/) *really* want PARI and not Pari... I just don't know, and hate all that stuff, but it's probably important to them.

Jeroen probably also won't accept this due to the commit "message".  I'm really sorry... I know from experience how much work doctest upgrades end up taking when you think they will be a 5-minute job.

No problem.  I'm not convinced that we need to worry about the `__compat` function since it's a double underscore method (and does something useful only to coercion), but oh well: I added a deprecation warning instead.

I also updated the commit message and changed Pari to PARI.

As I suspected, changing `raise` to `Raise` would cause problems.

```
