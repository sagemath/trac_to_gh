Ultimately, we should provide the user a nice way to set this. In the meantime, I'd like to clean up a few places where we play fast and loose with it:

* `simplify_radical()` and `simplify_log()` set the domain to 'real' before the round trip through Maxima and back. This has no effect on any doctest (radcan ignores `domain` anyway).

* Expression.expand_log() sets the domain to 'real' when it's called, and 'complex' when it returns. We should make a note of the previous value rather than assuming it is 'complex' when the method is called.

Dr. Fateman recently (March 14) mentioned on the Maxima list that `radcan` was written before Maxima's assumptions framework, and that all simplification takes place outside of `radcan`.

I think we can allow the switch where it makes sense. I left the `domain: real;` call in `expand_log()` alone because it only makes sense to call `expand_log()` on a real argument.

With `simplify_log()`, it's less clear. Right now, if I do,

```
sage: f = sqrt(x**2)
sage: f
sqrt(x^2)
sage: f.simplify_log()
abs(x)
```

we silently convert the expression to the reals. This isn't a result of the log simplification algorithm; it's a side effect of setting the domain to real (which provides no other *tested* benefits).

Obviously assuming that you're working over the reals can allow some simplifications, but we should just make that available to the user rather than doing it arbitrarily in some simplification functions but not others.

See #14305.  Apparently radcan does *not* ignore domain after all.

```
(%i1) radcan(sqrt(x^2));
(%o1)                               abs(x)
(%i2) domain:complex;
(%o2)                               complex
(%i3) radcan(sqrt(x^2));
(%o3)                                  x
```
This is true in the current Maxima (5.29.1) as well as the older 5.26 series in Sage 5.1/5.2.

if `x` is assumed to be real the correct answer for `sqrt(x^2)` is `abs(x)`.

However if `x` is assumed to be complex, the correct answer is either `x` or `-x`,
more precisely the one with a positive real part (or a nonnegative imaginary part if the real part is zero). Then if `x` is non-real the answer `abs(x)` is wrong, since this is the norm of `x`, and the norm is real. Consider for example `x = -3+4*I`, whose norm is 5, but whose square root is `3-4*I`.

Maple 15 gives:

```
> assume(x,real);
> simplify(sqrt(x^2));
                                    | x~ |

> assume(x,complex);  
> simplify(sqrt(x^2));
                                  csgn(x~) x~
```

If this ticket did change the default domain of symbolic variables from real to complex, this is a **MAJOR** change.

Again, according to symbolics experts (as opposed to functions experts) like Fateman, there is no such thing as `abs(x)`, only `x` or `-x`, and one then chooses a branch - arbitrarily, but consistently.  At least, so I understand that argument.

Which is what is given here, since one doesn't know a priori whether `x` has + or - real part, etc.  So Maxima picks `x`.

The default domain has been complex for a long, long time.  It was just exposed here that we didn't do that in `simplify_radical` - presumably to avoid the very behavior you are noticing at #14305, but we must have forgotten that.

Note also that I am not advocating for a particular resolution here, just trying to summarize the arguments and previous behavior.

I believe when one chooses `x` for `sqrt(x^2)`, one can always find some inconsistency. For example:

```
sage: e=sqrt(x^2)-sqrt((x+2)^2)
sage: e.simplify_radical()     
-2
sage: e(x=-1)                  
0
```

You are probably right.  I would encourage you to take this up with the Maxima developers on their list, because I personally want to know whether it's even worth thinking about this, or whether mjo is really right and we should just can `simplify_radical`, or perhaps relegate it to the deepest recesses of Tartarus.

Prior to this patch, `simplify_radical()` was doing two unrelated things:

1. Setting the maxima simplification domain to 'real'.
2. Calling radcan().

There was one doctest within sage that incorrectly relied on this, #12845. You can see that I fixed it by making the assumption explicit. It looks like the example in #14305 is doing the same thing. If you expect,

```
sage: sqrt(x^2).simplify_radical()
abs(x)
```

then you're relying on the implicit conversion to `domain:real;` which this ticket changed. You have no reason to expect `sqrt(x^2) == abs(x)` unless you assume that `x` is real, and we don't. The simplification domain in sage has always been 'complex', except where these sneaky functions twiddled it behind your back. Without the assumption that we're dealing with real numbers, `sqrt(x^2)` should simply be left alone. As noted above, you can't "simplify" it without screwing something up.

The real problem in #14305 is that without said assumption, `radcan()` will do something ridiculous. That's what `radcan()` does. **If you want correct answers, don't use `radcan()`**. The `radcan()` function does something very specific, and it works as documented. What it doesn't do is "simplification," and it has no business in sage under the name `simplify_foo()`. Please help me kill it: #12737.

Michael,

ok, we will modify our book, taking into account that by default symbolic variables are considered complex.

However I'm not happy with this ticket (#12780). Before we had (say in 5.1):

```
sage: assume(x,'real')
sage: sqrt(x^2).simplify_radical()
abs(x)
```
This was correct. And now (say in 5.8):

```
sage: assume(x,'real')
sage: sqrt(x^2).simplify_radical()
x
```
This is wrong, thus we have a regression with this ticket.

Paul

Note: I didn't call `radcan`, but `simplify_radical`...

I agree 100% that the current answer is wrong.. nothing with "simplify" in the name should convert `sqrt(x^2)` to `x`. But the previous behavior was also wrong. You can leave off the assumption that `x` is real, and this will still happen:

```
sage: sqrt(x^2).simplify_radical()
abs(x)
```

It's less wrong, maybe. But still wrong. In fact, the underlying call to `radcan()` wasn't doing anything here. The "simplification" is actually due to the silent switch to the reals. To see this, you can set the Maxima domain, and send your expression for a round trip through Maxima and back. This is in a current version of sage: 

```
sage: maxima_lib.eval('domain: real;')
'real'
sage: maxima_lib(sqrt(x^2))
abs(x)
```

Now that we've fixed *that* bug (in this ticket), the expression `sqrt(x^2)` is passed verbatim to `radcan()`. *Now*, it has something to mangle. And it does. It gives you `x` back. So ultimately, the previous, more-correct behavior was the result of a lesser bug preventing `radcan()` from doing more damage.
