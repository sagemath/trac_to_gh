I think the default behavior of `eigenvectors_right()` should be sane. Current behavior varies wildly.

1. For example this fails:

```
sage: matrix([ [2, 1], [1, 2.0]]).eigenvectors_right()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

NotImplementedError: eigenspaces cannot be computed reliably for inexact rings such as Real Field with 53 bits of precision,
consult numerical or symbolic matrix classes for other options
```

2. *[Neglect this case. It is a typo. Keeping it here so that the references from the comments below make sense]* This also fails but with a different error:

```
sage: matrix( [ [1.0, 0], [0.1, 2.0] ] ).right_eigenvector()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense' object has no attribute 'right_eigenvector'
```

3. Using RDF gives a sane output:

```
sage: matrix(RDF, [ [2, 1], [1, 2]]).eigenvectors_right()
[(3.0, [(0.707106781187, 0.707106781187)], 1), (1.0, [(-0.707106781187, 0.707106781187)], 1)]
```

4. But not using RDF in this case gives an output that appears "broken":

```
sage: matrix([ [2, 1], [1, 2]]).eigenvectors_right()                           
[(3, [
(1, 1)
], 1), (1, [
(1, -1)
], 1)]
```

In my opinion, by default all matrices should be made to belong to RDF or CDF if the field is not specified, so that most of the functionality can be availed.

The output in the last example appears "broken" because at some stage this function is called with **cr=True**, and this inserts a carriage return after every eigenvector:

```
Sequence(vecs, universe=V, check = False, immutable=True, cr=True)
```

(2): This just a typo in the method name used in the example.

```
matrix( [ [1.0, 0], [0.1, 2.0] ] ).right_eigenvectors()
```

will behave identically to (1).  (Note plural.)

(4): I have never liked the use of Sequence with `cr=True` for the basis vectors of an eigenspace in these calls.  IIRC, it would be easy to strip out, but a bunch of doctests would need reformatting.  In fact, right now it is *harder* to doctest this sort of output for large instances since the output from Sequence does not include as many whitespace characters that can be used to rearrange the output.  This might be a good question to pose to sage-devel with an eye to removing it?

(1) vs (3):  For RDF/CDF matrices there is no notion of a geometric multiplicity for an eigenvalue.  You will see that every eigenvalue comes back with a single eigenvector, implying that they have geometric multiplicty one.  So changing the base ring to RDF/CDF should be a conscious decision, in my mind.  The current "problem" with (1) is that absent a specified base ring, the choice is made to use RR, not RDF, and matrices over RR are not as capable as over RDF:

```
sage: A = matrix([ [2, 1], [1, 2.0]])
sage: A.base_ring() == RR
True
```

Maybe the error message in (1) could be improved to specifically suggest RDF, CDF or SR?

Then how about the other option? Use RDF only if the code when run over RR returns with `NotImplementedError`? This would leave the `ZZ` or `QQ` case alone.

Converting from RR to RDF could mean a massive loss of precision (it seems possible, I checked).  So there are two situations:
    
(1) A matrix is entered with decimals and no base ring.  User gets RR matrix.  Eigenvalues are poorly implemented, eigenvectors quit.

(2) A matrix has RR entries to a high precision and the user likes it this way.  Eigenvalues gives a warning (good), eigenvectors fails (better than a poor implementaion IMHO).

How about the following to satisfy both situations?  Implement all the eigenstuff for RR/CC matrices by doing a conversion immediately, and then using output of the RDF/CDF routines.  Maybe with a one-time warning like we do now for eigenvalues over RR/CC and good documentation.  That way, if anybody ever gets excited about implementing numerical routines properly for RR/CC, the conversion will get replaced.

Sounds good.  Maybe the RDF/CDF changes should go on a new ticket, since this seems like a good place to house any dealings with Sequence(cr=True)?  In any event, include me as a cc on anything you do and I'll try to look at it.

I don't know if this is related, but why does

```
sage: matrix(ZZ, [[6, -5], [1, 2]]).eigenvectors_right()
[(4 - 1*I, [(1, 0.4000000000000000? + 0.2000000000000000?*I)], 1),
 (4 + 1*I, [(1, 0.4000000000000000? - 0.2000000000000000?*I)], 1)]
```

return inexact eigenvectors? They could be computed exactly. Doing the same in SR returns exact results, but shouldn't matrices over ZZ or QQ try to get exact eigenvectors when possible?

The output looks similar, though not exactly the same in terms of relative positioning of elements, for all of `ZZ`, `QQ`, and `RDF`.
