Observe this:

```
sage: D=DirichletGroup(20);
sage: g=D[7].extend(400); #order 4 character
sage: M=ModularSymbols(g,2,sign=1).cuspidal_subspace()

TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

   5399         except (TypeError, AttributeError), msg:
   5400             pass

   5402 
   5403     def _coerce_from_str(self, x):
TypeError: <type 'NoneType'>
```

Debugging we see that the problem is that this code in matrix_space.py:

```
    479         if entries is None or entries == 0:
    480             if self._copy_zero: # faster to copy than to create a new one.
    481                 return self.zero_matrix().__copy__()
    482             else:
--> 483                 return self.__matrix_class(self, None, coerce=coerce, copy=copy)
```
That None in the last line is then coerced for some reason into a number field (Cyclotomic Field of order 4 and degree) which makes no sense now...   

This bug was introduced in #11589.

I figured this out.  This bug was introduced by #11589 (by Simon King and Martin Albrecht).   Basically the zero_matrix() method's code was "mangled/changed" (?) when being copied into the `__init__` method by replacing "0" by "None".  This breaks the code, since there is no reason that None be coercible into a ring R, and I don't think that has to be supported because, e.g., in Python `int(None)` is an error.   Also, this is a weird change since the zero_matrix method in the new code still uses 0. 

Patch coming up.

The fix for #12000 also works for this particular example.    I really hope that all other matrix types (now and in the future) respect this None convention, since they will all have the same problem if we go with the #12000 fix rather than the fix here.  We could add documentation in the file matrix/docs.py that reflects what should happen with None, and we should try to add a test that things work with several different types.

It would be nice to define a list of 100 (say) various rings in a file in the tests directory.  Then the test could be

```
sage: from sage.tests.examples import commutative_rings0
sage: for R in commutative_rings0:
