Observe this:

```
sage: D=DirichletGroup(20);
sage: g=D[7].extend(400); #order 4 character
sage: M=ModularSymbols(g,2,sign=1).cuspidal_subspace()
sage: N=M.new_subspace()
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/mnt/usb1/scratch/wstein/ref/sage-4.8.alpha2-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.pyc in _coerce_non_number_field_element_in(self, x)
   5399         except (TypeError, AttributeError), msg:
   5400             pass
-> 5401         raise TypeError, type(x)
   5402 
   5403     def _coerce_from_str(self, x):
TypeError: <type 'NoneType'>
```

Debugging we see that the problem is that this code in matrix_space.py:

```
    479         if entries is None or entries == 0:
    480             if self._copy_zero: # faster to copy than to create a new one.
    481                 return self.zero_matrix().__copy__()
    482             else:
--> 483                 return self.__matrix_class(self, None, coerce=coerce, copy=copy)
```
That None in the last line is then coerced for some reason into a number field (Cyclotomic Field of order 4 and degree) which makes no sense now...   

This bug was introduced in #11589.

I figured this out.  This bug was introduced by #11589 (by Simon King and Martin Albrecht).   Basically the zero_matrix() method's code was "mangled/changed" (?) when being copied into the `__init__` method by replacing "0" by "None".  This breaks the code, since there is no reason that None be coercible into a ring R, and I don't think that has to be supported because, e.g., in Python `int(None)` is an error.   Also, this is a weird change since the zero_matrix method in the new code still uses 0. 

Patch coming up.

The fix for #12000 also works for this particular example.    I really hope that all other matrix types (now and in the future) respect this None convention, since they will all have the same problem if we go with the #12000 fix rather than the fix here.  We could add documentation in the file matrix/docs.py that reflects what should happen with None, and we should try to add a test that things work with several different types.

It would be nice to define a list of 100 (say) various rings in a file in the tests directory.  Then the test could be

```
sage: from sage.tests.examples import commutative_rings0
sage: for R in commutative_rings0: 
         do something
```

Then people could add new rings to that list, and tests all over may benefit.  

And in addition to rings, we could assemble many other lists of examples of objects in that file.

This could be on another ticket.
