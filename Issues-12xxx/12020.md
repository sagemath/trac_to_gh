Observe this:

```
sage: D=DirichletGroup(20);
sage: g=D[7].extend(400); #order 4 character
sage: M=ModularSymbols(g,2,sign=1).cuspidal_subspace()
sage: N=M.new_subspace()
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

   5399         except (TypeError, AttributeError), msg:
   5400             pass
-> 5401         raise TypeError, type(x)
   5402 
   5403     def _coerce_from_str(self, x):
TypeError: <type 'NoneType'>
```

Debugging we see that the problem is that this code in matrix_space.py:

```
    479         if entries is None or entries == 0:
    480             if self._copy_zero: # faster to copy than to create a new one.
    481                 return self.zero_matrix().__copy__()
    482             else:
--> 483                 return self.__matrix_class(self, None, coerce=coerce, copy=copy)
```
That None in the last line is then coerced for some reason into a number field (Cyclotomic Field of order 4 and degree) which makes no sense now...   

This bug was introduced in #11589.

Woops --  I agree with not giving this a positive review.  

It would be good to have a test that runs through a large number of base rings.
