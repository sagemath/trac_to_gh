Hi Anne,

There are some problems with the doc:

Note: if you cite the same paper in two different function, you should either put the reference at the beginning of the file and link to it, or put two different refs. I usually use the second methods which is not very satisfactory.

Hi Florent,

Thanks for looking at this. This should be fixed now in the new version of the patch. Also, /combinat/posets/linear_extensions should now appear in the documentation.

If you have comments on how to use ClonableIntArray, let me know!

Comment by Nicolas: 

"If this suits you, please do the similar change in the evacuation
method, and add some example(s) with a Poset having arbitrary labels,
and that's good to go!"

I did those changes and fixed the last doc string failures.

So I am setting a positive review.

Well, this comment was not exactly about *those* changes. But I am
indeed very happy with that final version, so ok for the positive
review! Thanks for your further work on that patch.

You will find on the sage-combinat patch server a reviewers patch with
some final suggestions of documentation improvements (beside some
minor details; it felt useful to pinpoint that the result of
evacuation and promotion was a poset). Fold in whatever you like,
throw away the rest, and set back a positive review on my behalf.

Hi Jeroen,

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A22):
> Milestone changed from sage-5.0 to sage-5.1

We understand that the two following requests are quite antagonist,
yet we would very much appreciate if this patch (which is fairly
harmless) could be merged in 5.0, and 5.0 could be released
soon. Indeed, the implemented feature will be one of the themes of
Sage Days 38 (Anne will give a talk about them); so it would be
practical to have them in vanilla Sage.

If a choice has to be done between the two requests, then our
preference is for 5.0 to be released soon.

Thanks for your hard work!

                  Nicolas

I don't think such a big patch can ever be harmless, but I'll try it.

> If a choice has to be done between the two requests

Certainly not, as this ticket is not likely to influence the release date of sage-5.0.

To be totally honest, I wouldn't count on sage-5.0 to be released by Sage Days 38.  It could be, but then we quickly need some progress with the blocker tickets.

Thanks, I appreciate that! 

(by harmless, I mean't that it sure could be broken by itself, but by nature it's unlikely to have any influence any other parts of Sage, and thus break something preexisting without it getting detected by the testsuite)

> To be totally honest, I wouldn't count on sage-5.0 to be released by Sage Days 38.  It could be, but then we quickly need some progress with the blocker tickets.

Ok. At least one should be fixed soon: Florent just told me he found why the argspec had disapeared in the sphinx-compiled documentation :-)
