The `_combine_kwds` method for animations fails if `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, or `ymax` is only set for one of the dictionaries in the arguments.  For example:

```
sage: a = animate([plot(x^2 + n) for n in range(4)])
sage: b = animate([circle((0,i),1,hue=0) for i in srange(0,2,0.4)],  xmin=0, ymin=-1, xmax=1, ymax=3, figsize=[1,2])
sage: a*b
```
leads to an error.  The fix is to call `min` and `max` with argument `values` rather than `*values`: if `values` is equal to `[0]`, then `min(values)` returns 0, while `min(*values)` raises an error.
