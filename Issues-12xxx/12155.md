Nathann,

Looks good.  Testing right now.  What do you think of adding something to the TESTS section for each graph that keeps somebody from thinking it would be cool to change these constructions back to returning `BipartiteGraph` instances?  Just build one and take the complement with a reference to this ticket.  I guess this is where a test suite would help - taking the complement in the test suite would keep somebody from ever making a new construction like these.

Is there someplace that shows how to convert a plain graph into a bipartite graph?  (I have not looked.) In other words

```
G = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(3, 4)
H = BipartiteGraph(G)
```

Or maybe a way to do the conversion by giving the partition, so that there is no real computation to find it?  If there are any methods for the BipartiteGraph class which are specialized for that situation, it'd be good to document how to easily get to those.  Lots of travel for the next 5 weeks, but I'll try to stay with this one.

Rob

OOps.... Shame on me `:-/`

It is fixed in this patch, which also contains tests.

Btw, there is some doc for the BipartiteGraph class there 
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/bipartite_graph.html

but I have to admit I am really not a big fan of this class... It just prevents somebody from using some operations at the cost of many problems (that most of the functions inherited by BipartiteGraph just do not work), and I really believe that "keeping a graph bipartite" should be something you should do yourself when you need it, and not put it inside of the graph class. That's the problem with graph properties, if you want to ensure that they are kept throughout the object's life you have to double check every operation. This being said, check that a graph is bipartite is probably one of the cheapest tests there is.

Everything looks good now.  Positive review.

> but I have to admit I am really not a big fan of this class... 

After this experience, I agree.  It might be nice to use this class to carry around the bipartition, and specialized methods for algorithms that are much faster ona bipartite graph, but enforcing the bipartition through operations seems to great a burden.
