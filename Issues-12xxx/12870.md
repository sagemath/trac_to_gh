REPORT:

(this is long, but there is really only one trivial change I want made.)

1. Delete this file -- why is it there?

```
-rw-r-----  1 wstein wstein  21M 2012-04-19 05:20 openssl-1.0.1a.tar
```

2. It builds fine on sage.math (64-bit ubuntu).

3. It fails to build on OS X 10.7.3 after building sage-5.0.pre15 out of the box:

```

************************************************************************
Error installing package openssl-1.0.1a
```

This looks like some OS version detection code is wrong? Note `gcc: error: unrecognized option ‘-arch’`.  Exactly the same problem happens with the openssl-1.0.0.p0 that we currently have in the optional package repo.


4. On Ubuntu 64-bit (sage.math), I tried rebuilding Python after building the new openssl, and that worked fine and did include openssl support. 

5. I ran all doctests on ubuntu 64-bit and that worked fine.  This isn't surprising, since I think no doctests use openssl. 

6. On OS X 10.6, I tried this:

```
bsd:sage-5.0.beta8 wstein$ ./sage -i  http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mariah/spkg/openssl-1.0.1a.spkg
```
and it worked fine. 

7. It would be nice if there was an ".hgignore" file since

```
$ hg status
? openssl-1.0.1a.spkg
? openssl-1.0.1a/SPKG.txt
? openssl-1.0.1a/openssl-1.0.1a.tar
? openssl-1.0.1a/src/ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
? openssl-1.0.1a/src/CHANGES
? openssl-1.0.1a/src/CHANGES.SSLeay
? openssl-1.0.1a/src/Configure
...
```

SUMMARY: The OS X 10.7.3 issue looks serious, but should not hold this back, because it is already in the current openssl optional package; it should be considered a new bug on a separate ticket.   Otherwise, we just need to delete the upstream tarball which is there for no reason.  Since this is an optional spkg, and we still don't officially support OS X 10.7.3, I don't consider this a total blocker for a positive review. 

THUS: Positive review contingent on deleting that one tar file.

The spkg posted by William supercedes my spkg.  (William's spkg
removes a tar file that I mistakenly left in the spkg.)

I have removed my spkg from the Description.

I am setting this back to positive review because William gave it
a positive review.
