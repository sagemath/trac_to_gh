In ticket #10623, some methods for integer factorization were moved to a separated file. Still, the sage library still calls some of them

_factor_trial_division in integer.pyx function squarefree_part

_factor_cunningham in finite_field_base.pyx and element_base.pyx

These methods should call to the proper functions in factorint.pyx

Line 1002 in **sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod.pyx** is too long.

In the same file:

```
sage: a.nth_root(2,False,True,'Johnston',False)
```
should probably be

```
sage: a.nth_root(2,False,True,'Johnston',True)
```
to use cunningham.

```
``sage -i cunningham_tables``}}} without version number
is enough.

Please, also remove trailing white spaces about which patchbot is complaining.

I suppose this is ready for review.

All tests passed including the `-only_optional=cunningham` ones.

Looks good to me!
