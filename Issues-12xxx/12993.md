This should return True:

```
sage: P = Poset(([1,2,3,4],[[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]), facade = True)
sage: P.is_ranked()
False
```

Anne's suggestion from this [thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-combinat-devel/XsMrxKdvl1A/discussion) on sage-combinat-devel:

    For a finite poset perhaps the easiest would be to

- start with a random element in the poset, assign rank 0
- look at all covers and cocovers and assign the rank according to the recurrence rank(x) = rank(y) + 1 if x covers y.
- repeat with the new elements
- if at any point an element is reached again and is assigned a different value from before, the poset is not graded; otherwise continue with new elements

Hello Darij,

I took a quick look at your code and have a few comments.

1. You should add the poset that Anne provided illustrating the bug as a doctest in the examples section. This way, it is guaranteed to work in all future versions of Sage.

2. I see that you are trying to create a list of empty lists. An easier and more efficient way to do this is:

   [ [] for x in range(n) ]

3. I see you are using these lists to construct lists of upper and lower covers. I think you should just use the `upper_covers` and `lower_covers` methods for posets, or the `neighbors_out` `neighbours_in` methods for Hasse diagrams.

4. I would probably use a dictionary for `rank_fcn` instead of a list. This way you don't have to create a list of the required length beforehand.

5. Your code first creates a function and then tests it to see if it is a rank function. Is it possible to do the tests as you are creating the function so that in case the poset is not graded, then we get an error as soon as one is detected? I haven't given it much thought. Maybe it isn't as efficient?

Christian,

Nice idea to use the `rank_function` for the plot method!

I don't like this loop:

```
579	                for i,j in edges:           # to find new elements, we run through all edges of the Hasse diagram
580	                    if i in rank_fcn:
                            ...
589	                    else: 
590	                        if j in rank_fcn:   # as above 
```
This means that you will be looking at edges multiple times until one of them has been assigned a rank. You are also looking at edges in other connected components. If there are several connected components, then this will take too long. For example,

```
sage: P = lambda n : Poset([range(n), [(i,i+1) for i in range(0,n,2)]])
sage: time p = P(10000); p
Time: CPU 2.32 s, Wall: 2.32 s
Finite poset containing 10000 elements
sage: time p.is_ranked()
True
Time: CPU 13.35 s, Wall: 13.36 s
```
With Darij and Anne's patch, this only takes 0.99s.

I'm preparing a patch right now to address this.

That is right -- I first had taken the connected components into account as Darij and Anne did it, but in the examples I had it was always faster to not first compute th connected components.

I guess that for larger posets, it is worth first computing the connected components (but only because that is done in the backbone of graphs and thus really fast), and also deleting edges that are not needed anymore.

Do you first want me to put these things in my algo, or do you wanna do it?

Here is a review patch. Apply on top of Christian's review patch (which goes on top of Anne's).

It looks at each edge exactly twice.

I also updated the documentation for Poset.rank_function.

Christian: I see you didn't run the doctests. I had to fix your attempt at using rank_function for plotting.

Also, there is a pickling error that got introduced by your patch in posets.py, but I can't replicated it from within Sage. I don't have time to debug this now, so go ahead and try to sort it out.

**Edit:** Here is the doctest failure message:

Hi Christian and Franco,

Thank you for your review patches and investigating this! Franco, conversely, can I ask
you to push your review patch to the sage-combinat queue? That would be easier for me and we
can fold all patches once everyone is happy!

I'll be traveling back to Davis soon (from Oberwolfach), so might not have internet in the meantime.

Anne

your code is certainly cleaner than mine was!

Thanks for pushing my patch.

The algorithm starts with some vertex, and propagates the value of the rank function along incoming *and* outgoing edges. If there is a unique minimal vertex in each connected component, then we could just use outgoing edges starting from that minimal vertex. Otherwise, we have to go backwards along some edges.

Great idea. What about "see also" sections for is_graded and is_ranked that point to each other? Perhaps this is what you meant by "add a link"?

Hi!

The following seems the line causing the pickling failure

+        rank_function = self.rank_function()

So I will remove the height function stuff that Christian added, since I have no idea how to fix this pickling failure otherwise.

Could you please review the new patch?

Thanks,

Anne
