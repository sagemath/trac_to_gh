Since `sage-env` sources `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-check-64`, it makes sense to move the latter file to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin`.  I also propose to rename the file to "sage-arch-env".  I would like to support a SAGE32 flag (see #12726) and it makes sense to use the same file for this.

Further changes:
1. use `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage-64.txt` as indicator file for `SAGE64` instead of `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/sage-64.txt` (`sage-64.txt` looks more like a configuration file than a library).
2. remove all "echo" statements from `sage-check-64` (they were being redirected to /dev/null anyway).
3. move the sourcing of this file up in sage-env, before the compiler flags are set.  This would allow changing the default compiler flags, depending on `SAGE64` or other future architecture flags.
4. remove sourcing of `sage-check-64` from `local/bin/sage-build`.  The latter script is only called from `spkg/bin/sage` at which point `SAGE64` is already set if needed.
5. remove all uname checks: don't make a difference between OS X, Solaris and other systems (it doesn't mean `SAGE64` is supported on all systems of course).
6. if SAGE64 is set to "no", delete sage-64.txt.

Added items 5 and 6.

One idea from #10303 that I disagree with is to source `sage-check-64` (now `sage-arch-env`) only in `sage-spkg` and `sage-build`, i.e. when a package is being built.  I think it can be useful even within Sage, for example to compile Cython files.

Well, Cython should take `CFLAGS` etc. from distutils, i.e., Python.

Doesn't really make sense to change the settings (`SAGE64` or whatever) afterwards or inbetween.  Either you do (or have) a 64-bit build, or not.  The original purpose of the `sage-64.txt` file is exactly to avoid mixing up 32-bit and 64-bit builds (although there are certainly better ways to achieve this).

Shouldn't there be at least a warning if `SAGE64` is set to `"no"` but `sage-64.txt` already exists?

Since this is exactly what we want to avoid: Mixing up both.

I believe in the philosophy of "user is always right".  If the user *intentionally* set `SAGE64=yes` and then later `SAGE64=no`, we assume he knows what he's doing.

Perhaps, but I think it's not impossible that some Sage library code or user code wants to look at `SAGE64`.  However, I'm not going to insist on this.  I just want this ticket to get reviewed and merged, unlike #10303.
