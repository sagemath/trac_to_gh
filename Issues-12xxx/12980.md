Here is a review patch! If you agree with it, then we can change this ticket to positive review.

Other than reformatting, I added the word "Graph" to the method name, as in the case of the Biggs-Smith graph. I also edited the docstring a bit for language, and modified the `_line_embedding` function to be a bit faster.
