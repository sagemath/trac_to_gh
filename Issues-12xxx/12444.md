At least some of these instances break the build with GCC 4.7.0 (without `-fpermissive`) as well, hence I also made an spkg fixing these (hundreds?) at #12761, along with a major clean-up of the spkg.

I can't tell whether I've changed all instances you catched, but I fixed all such that Givaro's test suite as well as the Sage library would build with GCC 4.7.0.
