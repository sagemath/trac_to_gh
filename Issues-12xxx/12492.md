```
sage: sq=polytopes.n_cube(2)
sage: sq.vertices()
[[1, 1], [-1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, -1]]
sage: sq.radius()
2*sqrt(2)
sage: Polyhedron([[p0+1,p1] for p0,p1 in sq.vertices()]).radius()
2*sqrt(3)
sage: Polyhedron([[p0+10,p1] for p0,p1 in sq.vertices()]).radius()
2*sqrt(102)
```

The radius of the unit square is of course `sqrt(2)`. I have no idea what the current code is trying to do, so I'm rewriting it.

Running tests. The code block in the description now looks like this:

```
sage: sq=polytopes.n_cube(2)
sage: sq.vertices() 
[[1, 1], [-1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, -1]]
sage: sq.radius()
sqrt(2)
sage: Polyhedron([[p0+1,p1] for p0,p1 in sq.vertices()]).radius()
sqrt(2)
sage: Polyhedron([[p0+10,p1] for p0,p1 in sq.vertices()]).radius()
sqrt(2)
```

And just to show that it can produce numbers other than `sqrt(2)`:

```
sage: Polyhedron([[p0*3+10,p1*3] for p0,p1 in sq.vertices()]).radius()
3*sqrt(2)
```
