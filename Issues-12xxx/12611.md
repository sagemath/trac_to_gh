It would be convenient to have an optional parameter specifying a prime in the two functions mentioned in the summary. In this way, the code:

sage: x.valuation(5)

would work regardless of `x` being an Integer or a 5-adic. I attach a patch that implements this.

Looks good.  The one change I would suggest is to explain in the docstring that the reason for allowing p as input is for consistency with the valuation methods on integer and rational.
