This "if" will never be true (as you already special-cased it above), so this block can be removed:

```
        if [ $DARWIN_VERSION -gt 10 ]; then
           echo "Probably you need Xcode 4.3 (or later)"
           echo "Also, make sure you install Xcode's"
           echo "Command Line Tools -- see Sage's README.txt."
