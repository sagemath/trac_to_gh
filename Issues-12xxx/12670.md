After building and running many versions of Sage, my `.sage` directory is littered with files with names like

```
_Applications_sage_builds_sage-5.0.beta7-gcc_devel_sage-main-lazy_import_cache.pickle
```
We should instead store these in a subdirectory of `.sage`. The attached patch makes this change.

Hi John,

I noticed the same for me. Thanks for tacking care of that. By the way, in my `.sage` the mentioned file are all only 6 bytes long which seems to be rather small for a cache. Is it normal ? Is the cache actually working ?
