That makes the code non-portable ; the patch I provide adds either signed or unsigned in each place, which makes the ARM platform pass the tests happily.

Notice that it does fix the current problem but there are still two problems with the code:
1. in vertex_separation.pyx, we still have "minimums[i] = n" which is an unsigned char getting an unsigned int ;
2. in vertex_separation.pyx, we still have "tmp_count = <unsigned char> popcount(i)", where popcount returns an "int".

Eh, this patch is basically mine with s/unsigned char/uint8_t/g and s/signed char/int8_t/g, so it's no surprise it passes the tests.

But it also means it has all the problems of the original code, plus the ones of my patch.

When I read the patched code, I see the following (potential or real) problems :
1. there are loops on "int" counters from 0 to a cardinal (they should be the same type as the cardinal);
2. the implementation of pop_count uses magical values which seem to assume a definite sizeof(int);
3. there are "int" which are in fact bit arrays ; it should probably be "unsigned int" ;
4. there are arrays which are indexed by above, so I'm not sure there is no risk there (though there is a test to bail out in case of problems, 8*sizeof(int)).

If I remember well, the current doctests just use graphs of cardinal up to 8, so we can only detect signed/unsigned issues, but not other ones.

I'll try to work on a bigger patch ; I'm updating the summary of that ticket to reflect that much more ambitious scope.

Don't you think it is going a bit too far ? You are refusing to compare unsigned char with integers, for some reason bit arrays "should be" unsigned int and not "int"...

And even if the ansers of some methods do not require more than 8 bits that is no reason why we should force the user to deal with int8_t instead of regular integers...

I agree that the argument of popcount should be redefined to int32_t though.

And for bit arrays, I didn't write they "should be" but "should probably be", which is even weaker: I'm not convinced.

Well, the thing with "char" is that it has a "meaning", it represents characters, and that's why there is a difference on your architecture. What I mean by using char is actually "a 8-bits integer", which can be unsigned at times. But what is the point of saving 3 bytes on an integer counter ?

Well.... You sent a patch while setting the ticket to "needs_work", so you tell me `^^;`

I tried to answer the points you made in your 4 items list. I think (a very personal advice) that points 1, 3 and 4 have more to do with theology than with programming (there is nothing that makes me worry in any of them, except that any patch fixing them would made the way harder to read) and the remark you made in 2 is right for me, and can be fixed with the trick I gave two comments above.

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A23):

That's not clear from looking at the code.

> and I thought it was better to write a popcount function for "int" than to write a popcount function for int32_fast_t, so here it is. This function just tests the size of an int before returning its result.

That's my question: why do the test?  Why not just do

```
cdef inline int popcount(int i): 
    return __builtin_popcount(i) 
```

Also: there are portability issues: `__builtin_popcount()` is a GCC extension, certainly not supported by all compilers.

Arggggg ! `O_O;;;`

Well... I uploaded a new patch but I would like to have your advice on that. I added a new function whose purpose is only to test popcount32, but the test is *LONG* (around 5 minutes) so I flagged it with "not tested". I thought it was too long even for a "long" flag. It tries "all 32bits integers" and computes popcount in two different ways, to check for correction.

Really?  I highly doubt that you can write something which is faster than `__builtin_popcount()`.

Well, it is not like I have an explanation for that, it is too low-level for me. If I were to try to find an answer I would say that the function implemented is inline while builtin_popcount is necessarily a function to be called.

Of course, nothing beats using __builtin_popcount with a popcount instruction enabled on the processor, as it is directly translated to a function call.

Ok, now I made these tests a long time ago and it is actually very easy to check. I will post that in a second.

Yooooooo !!!

Well, I just did the tests, and you can find attached the patch I used to do that. I actually first did the tests by replacing "return popcount32" in the code by "return \_\_builtin_popcount", and there was no difference that I could see in the runtimes of path_decomposition. I was about to say "ok you are right, there is no difference after all", but short of my natural dislike of acknowledging my own mistakes, I was really convinced that there was a real diference between the two.

And it turns out that if I did not see the difference anymore, it is because of some change I made late in the path_decomposition algorithm (a previous version was *MUCH* slower than the current one), and this popcount is not the critical function anymore.
The "stupid test" (try many integers, compute what's left afterwards) is clear enough though :

```
sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.vertex_separation import test_handmade, test_builtin
sage: time test_builtin()                                                                       
-805306368
Time: CPU 5.94 s, Wall: 5.95 s
sage: time test_handmade()                                                                      
-805306368
Time: CPU 1.85 s, Wall: 1.85 s
```

Of course, these tests are immediately destroyed if you are lucky enough to compile the code on a machine with the popcnt instruction enabled... But so far I found no way to do that in a way that would not make the code crash on a machine that does *not* have it enabled.
