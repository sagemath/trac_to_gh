The following was found out here:
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-release/browse_thread/thread/e2a87c73dc1625f2

```
* PolyBoRi fails to build due to stricter (C++11) scoping / name look-up rules.
    Unfortunately PolyBoRi doesn't honor CXXFLAGS, so I had to use CXX="g++-4.7.0 -fpermissive" to make the spkg build. 
```

The scoping issue should be fixed here:
https://bitbucket.org/brickenstein/polybori/changeset/43b3931ceed7/raw/

Also, we should support CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS (ANd CPPFLAGS?) in the spkg.

### Current spkg
* **Install** http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/spkg/polybori-0.8.0.p2.spkg

**Assignee:** @alexanderdreyer

**CC:**  @nexttime PolyBoRi @malb @burcin

**Keywords:** C++11 GCC 4.7.0 CXXFLAGS -fpermissive

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

**Reviewer:** Leif Leonhardy

**Author:** Alexander Dreyer

Ok, did so.  "Global" `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` are properly added now, and upstream patches fixing the name look-up issue get applied.

The last revision isn't tagged yet (which the merge script then will do later), but more importantly, `SPKG.txt` lacks a new changelog entry.
