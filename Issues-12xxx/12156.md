An object of type `LatexExpr` should be pretty-printed as-is, that is

```
sage: pretty_print(LatexExpr('x^2 + 1'))
```
should really typeset `"x^2 + 1"` instead of displaying the string `"x^2 + 1"`.

Also, import `LatexExpr` globally.

In what situations does the space matter in math mode? It seems to me that if both were valid expressions before, then they can be separated by a space without any harm...

If there are situations when space does not work, which I think are quite rare since I cannot think of any, one always has an option of converting things to strings, doing anything there and then assembling them back.

Problem solved by using `r"""` instead of `"""`.

Concerning adding: you are right, I did not consider that we are using math mode all the time.  But you should use `_add_` (single underscores).  I don't know why, but Sage does it this way.
