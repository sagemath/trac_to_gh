An object of type `LatexExpr` should be pretty-printed as-is, that is

```
sage: pretty_print(LatexExpr('x^2 + 1'))
```
should really typeset `"x^2 + 1"` instead of displaying the string `"x^2 + 1"`.

Also, import `LatexExpr` globally.

If we do add the last patch (which is a bit beyond the title of this ticket), then I think that we MUST add a space between concatenated expressions: if you join "x" and "y" into "xy" it may be exactly what you need, but "\alpha" and "x" get joined into "\alphax" which is not a valid code any more (as I have "discovered" at #9478). Plus spaces (or even new lines) help reading the code and adjusting it if necessary.

I also was actually surprised that `"\frac{x}2"` works, I would put it as `"\frac{x}{2}"`, although it is just a personal preference, I guess ;-)

If there are situations when space does not work, which I think are quite rare since I cannot think of any, one always has an option of converting things to strings, doing anything there and then assembling them back.

Problem solved by using `r"""` instead of `"""`.

Concerning adding: you are right, I did not consider that we are using math mode all the time.  But you should use `_add_` (single underscores).  I don't know why, but Sage does it this way.

I guess you are patching some 4.8alpha version of sage. I was patching 4.7.2, so I had to modify the patch [attachment:12156_fix_latex.patch] for `sage/modular/dirichlet.py` to read as:

```diff
diff --git a/sage/modular/dirichlet.py b/sage/modular/dirichlet.py
--- a/sage/modular/dirichlet.py

@@ -511,7 +511,7 @@

This, along with #12197 makes it pass the doctests. So, positive review from me too.
