```
An object of type `LatexExpr` should be pretty-printed as-is, that is

```
sage: pretty_print(LatexExpr('x^2 + 1'))
```
should really typeset `"x^2 + 1"` instead of displaying the string `"x^2 + 1"`.

Also, import `LatexExpr` globally.

In what situations does the space matter in math mode? It seems to me that if both were valid expressions before, then they can be separated by a space without any harm... As I understand `{}` will do the same, but it will make the code much uglier, `x{}y` is not as cool as `x y`. And I think that readability of the LaTeX output is a valid concern since I quite regularly take some Sage generated code and then do some manual tweaking. For example - take a long polynomial and then typeset it in an align-environment in a paper. In editors that auto-wrap lines on spaces it is also preferable to have just a space separator.

If there are situations when space does not work, which I think are quite rare since I cannot think of any, one always has an option of converting things to strings, doing anything there and then assembling them back. On a related note, it would be nice to have automatic vertical assembling of such expressions as well, but it is definitely beyond this ticket.

Replying to [novoselt](#comment%3A13):
> Which patch does break the PDF manual? The last one or all of them?


Problem solved by using `r"""` instead of `"""`.

Concerning adding: you are right, I did not consider that we are using math mode all the time.  But you should use `_add_` (single underscores).  I don't know why, but Sage does it this way.

As mentioned by novoselt, `_add_` does not work. I tried it out just now. Updated the patch.

New patch also allows str + LatexExpr additions, which needed a few changes in various places inside Sage.  I left one more substantial change for differential forms at #12197.

Needs review.

I think I'll join the patch party: I'm attaching a patch which rewords a few docstrings. Otherwise, everything looks good to me.  With the patch at #12197 and all of the patches here, all tests pass.

I'm willing to give everything but my patch a positive review.

I guess you are patching some 4.8alpha version of sage. I was patching 4.7.2, so I had to modify the patch [attachment:12156_fix_latex.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12156/12156_fix_latex.patch) for `sage/modular/dirichlet.py` to read as:
