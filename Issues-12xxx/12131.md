Some distributions set up autotools to install libraries into `%{prefix}/lib64`, which breaks Sage's assumption that libraries are installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`. In particular, OpenSuse64 according to this thread https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/LS-u8E77NJQ/discussion

It seems like we have two options:
* Always call `./configure --libdir='${prefix}/lib'` to explicitly specify the library directory, or
* Set up a symlink `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib64` -> `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.

The symlink is the lazy thing to do but will probably break again with the next architectural change. Fixing the configure call seems the right thing to do but will need some work to patch up all spkgs.

Note that I based the r-package on the version from #12057 (which has already been fixed); note that #12057 also contains a patch that needs to be applied.

Similarly, the mpir package is based on the version from #12139.

Volker has posted an [updated readline spkg](http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/readline-6.2.p2.spkg). It use

```
./configure --libdir="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"
```

Similarly, I changed the python-2.6.4 spkg (not posted yet).

I wonder: Is the `--libdir=..." option is also valid on Solaris?

Meanwhile, my `openSUSE` laptop is in the middle of building Atlas. Hence, it looks good, so far!

Great! Meanwhile I have a new python-2.6.4.p12.spkg and an mpir-1.2.2.p8.spkg. The next problem is that ecl can't find libgc, so that's the next thing I have to modify.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">Comment 9</div>

I made some progress by modifying the following spkgs:

* readline (I used Volker's version)
* python
* mpir
* boehm_gc
* givaro
* mpfr
* mpfi
* r

Now it hangs in the Sage library code, more precisely: In M4RI. Therefore I am Cc'ing Martin. I will try to modify the M4RI spkg (and then probably M4RIE, too).

My install.log is [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/SAGE/install_logs/4.8.alpha3/install.log.4), probably with some leftovers of previous build attempts.

<div id="comment:11" align="right">Comment 11</div>

According to [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/2d2faef04efb3494/f55374ff728ebc27), we could make this a blocker for sage-5.0.

The sage installation on my `openSUSE` laptop is now almost completed, but just as I write this line, there is yet another library that can't be found.

Here is the suggested work plan:

**__New package versions__**

Use the following updated spkgs (the first is contributed by Volker, and I'll provide the others probably later today:

* python-2.6.4.p12.spkg
* mpir-1.2.2.p8.spkg
* boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p1.spkg
* givaro-3.2.13rc2.p3.spkg
* mpfr-2.4.2.p0.spkg
* mpfi-1.3.4-cvs20071125.p9.spkg
* r-2.10.1.p5.spkg
* libm4ri-2011004.p0.spkg
* libm4rie-2011004.p0.spkg
* cddlib-094f.p9.spkg
* maxima-5.23.2.p3.spkg
* ecl-11.1.2.cvs20111120.p1.spkg
* libpng-1.2.35.p4.spkg
* iml-1.0.1.p14.spkg
* pynac-0.2.3.p0.spkg
* linbox-1.1.6.p6.spkg
* glpk-4.44.p0.spkg

Perhaps there will be more than that, but so far it seems to work: Sage is already creating the docs!

**__Testing__**

In addition to the new spkgs, I have `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` defined. It would be interesting to know whether it would also work without defining it.

I have a new mpir spkg at #12139 which does **not** fix the `--libdir` issue, but gives you something to work with.  The package needs review, by the way :-)

I wonder one thing: There is `.../local/lib/` and `.../local/lib64/`. Certainly there are two different lib directories for a reason. So, is it really safe to put everything into `.../local/lib/`?

I did not change executability of spkg-check in givaro and did not change the permissions if cddlib, gd and iml. But if you like, I can take care of that.

> Apart from giving you a 50% chance of having the wrong library first in the library path

We already have a 99% chance or so of having the first two components wrong:

```
/usr/local/src/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/R/lib:/usr/local/src/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/openmpi:/usr/local/src/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/
```

Besides, nobody said that `lib64` had to come first.

> and will break once somebody uses a more descriptive library path :-)

True, but the `lib32`/`lib64` multilib is very standard.

In any case, it is absolutely needed for gcc: #12405.
