Some distributions set up autotools to install libraries into `%{prefix}/lib64`, which breaks Sage's assumption that libraries are installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`. In particular, OpenSuse64 according to this thread https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/LS-u8E77NJQ/discussion

It seems like we have two options:
* Always call `./configure --libdir='${prefix}/lib'` to explicitly specify the library directory, or
* Set up a symlink `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib64` -> `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.

The symlink is the lazy thing to do but will probably break again with the next architectural change. Fixing the configure call seems the right thing to do but will need some work to patch up all spkgs.

Note that I based the r-package on the version from #12057 (which has already been fixed); note that #12057 also contains a patch that needs to be applied.

Similarly, the mpir package is based on the version from #12139.

Volker has posted an [updated readline spkg](http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/readline-6.2.p2.spkg). It use

```
./configure --libdir="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"
```

Similarly, I changed the python-2.6.4 spkg (not posted yet).

I wonder: Is the `--libdir=..." option is also valid on Solaris?

Meanwhile, my `openSUSE` laptop is in the middle of building Atlas. Hence, it looks good, so far!

Great! Meanwhile I have a new python-2.6.4.p12.spkg and an mpir-1.2.2.p8.spkg. The next problem is that ecl can't find libgc, so that's the next thing I have to modify.

I made some progress by modifying the following spkgs:

* readline (I used Volker's version)
* python
* mpir
* boehm_gc
* givaro
* mpfr
* mpfi
* r

Now it hangs in the Sage library code, more precisely: In M4RI. Therefore I am Cc'ing Martin. I will try to modify the M4RI spkg (and then probably M4RIE, too).

My install.log is [here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/SAGE/install_logs/4.8.alpha3/install.log.4), probably with some leftovers of previous build attempts.

According to [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/2d2faef04efb3494/f55374ff728ebc27), we could make this a blocker for sage-5.0.

The sage installation on my `openSUSE` laptop is now almost completed, but just as I write this line, there is yet another library that can't be found.

Here is the suggested work plan:

**__New package versions__**

Use the following updated spkgs (the first is contributed by Volker, and I'll provide the others probably later today:

* python-2.6.4.p12.spkg
* mpir-1.2.2.p8.spkg
* boehm_gc-7.2.alpha6.p1.spkg
* givaro-3.2.13rc2.p3.spkg
* mpfr-2.4.2.p0.spkg
* mpfi-1.3.4-cvs20071125.p9.spkg
* r-2.10.1.p5.spkg
* libm4ri-2011004.p0.spkg
* libm4rie-2011004.p0.spkg
* cddlib-094f.p9.spkg
* maxima-5.23.2.p3.spkg
* ecl-11.1.2.cvs20111120.p1.spkg
* libpng-1.2.35.p4.spkg
* iml-1.0.1.p14.spkg
* pynac-0.2.3.p0.spkg
* linbox-1.1.6.p6.spkg
* glpk-4.44.p0.spkg

Perhaps there will be more than that, but so far it seems to work: Sage is already creating the docs!

**__Testing__**

In addition to the new spkgs, I have `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` defined. It would be interesting to know whether it would also work without defining it.

Question: Martin seems to suggest to use `--libdir="${prefix}/lib"` rather than `--libdir="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"` in `M4RI(E)`. Is this a rule that applies to other packages as well?

Not mpir, since I started with alpha3 (which does contain the new mpir).

Why is mpir-1.2.2.p8 from #11964 not in alpha3, even though it is supposed to be merged in alpha0?

Nevermind me, I just tried to say: whatever you do for standard packages, it should work for M4RI(E). I don't know which one is better of the two options you mentioned above.

I will now get the updated packages from the other tickets and modify them. Because of coordination with #12139, I will not post a new mpir here, but leave it to Jeroen to insert `--libdir` into mpir.

With the new package versions that I have posted on my sage.math account (see ticket description), `local/lib64/` remains empty, and more importantly all long tests pass.

I noticed that #12139 is now fixed. Therefore I will provide a new mpir version based on that. So, not "needs review" yet...

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A52):
> Apart from giving you a 50% chance of having the wrong library first in the library path

We already have a 99% chance or so of having the first two components wrong:

```
/usr/local/src/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/R/lib:/usr/local/src/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/openmpi:/usr/local/src/sage-5.0.beta1/local/lib/
```

Besides, nobody said that `lib64` had to come first.

> and will break once somebody uses a more descriptive library path :-)

True, but the `lib32`/`lib64` multilib is very standard.

In any case, it is absolutely needed for gcc: #12405.
