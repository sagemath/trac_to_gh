The problem is this branch:

```
    if self._value < 2:
        if self._value == 0:
            return RDF(-1)/RDF(0)
        if self._value < 0:
            return RDF(0)/RDF(0)
        sig_on() 
        a = self._new_c(gsl_sf_log_1plusx(self._value - 1) / log_of_base) 
        sig_off() 
        return a
```

When self._value is small enough, self._value-1 becomes -1 and we get the log of 0. Frankly, even before this happens we lose precision unnecessarily:

```

Probably the simplest fix is to use the 1+x trick only when the argument is actually close to 1. Simply changing the condition to

    if 0.5 <= self._value < 2:

will change the above results to the less exciting but more useful

Any objections?  Performance seems similar for values which previously would have used gsl_sf_log_1plusx but now simply use gsl_sf_log.

Fixes the bug!

I think a better doctest would be to check that it is below one ulp:

```
sage: def check_error(x):
...         log_RDF = CDF(x).log().real()
...     log_exact = log(x.n(1000))
...     return abs(log_RDF-log_exact) <= log_RDF.ulp() 
sage: all( check_error( RDF(2^x) ) for x in range(-100,100) )
True
```

Also, instead of dividing `0/0` why not return `RDF.NaN()`?

I tried `CDF(x).log().real()` for fun but of course want to test `RDF(x).log()`, thats my fault.

The whole branch calling `gsl_sf_log_1plusx(self._value - 1)` for values close to 1 nonsense. Sure the `gsl_sf_log_1plusx` function is more accurate, but now all the error comes from the numerically unstable `self._value - 1`.

Also the doctests fail for me, and I need to set the bound at 2*ulp for it to pass.

Finally, you must doctest `check_error(x)` and not `check_error(RDF(x))`. Otherwise, the exact log value (for the comparison) is computed at the wrong value:

```
sage: x = 0.999
sage: x.parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: x.n(100)   # as expected
0.99900000000000000000000000000
sage: RDF(x).n(100)   # not the intended value of x.n(100)
0.99899999999999999911182158030
```

Updated patch follows...

Too early in the morning ;-)

We have to use `check_error(RDF(x))` and not `check_error(x)` so that the arbitrary-precision floating point value is the same as the double precision floating point number, not the other way round. I fixed this in the updated patch. 

Now also the doctest works with `<= 1*ulp` precision!

Hey, I'm in no position to object: I was trying to preserve the "1+1e-100" case when we're already in RDF and there *is* no "1+1e-100", only 1, which doesn't make a great deal of sense. `:-)`  

Works for me.  Positive review.
