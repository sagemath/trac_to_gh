This is just horrible code (`sage/misc/misc.py`):

```
def branch_current_hg():
    """
    Return the current hg Mercurial branch name. If the branch is
    'main', which is the default branch, then just '' is returned.
    """
    try:
        s = os.popen('ls -l %s/devel/sage'%os.environ['SAGE_ROOT']).read()
    except IOError:
        # this happens when running sage under gdb on macs
        return 'gdb'
    if 'No such file or directory' in s:
        raise RuntimeError, "unable to determine branch?!"
    # do ls -l and look for a symlink, which `ls` represents by a '->'
    i = s.rfind('->')
    if i == -1:
        raise RuntimeError, "unable to determine branch?!"
    s = s[i+2:]
    i = s.find('-')
    if i == -1:
        return ''
    br = s[i+1:].strip()
    return br
```

For one, this clearly needs an "os.readlink()" instead of parsing "ls" output.  The "gdb" is also broken, since the string "gdb" doesn't contain "->".  Also the documentation is wrong: is the branch is "main", then "main" is returned.

Could you use

raise RuntimeError("Unable to determine branch")
```
to have less work in the future (when we are moving to Python 3).
