First of all: make ptestlong works with the two new spkgs (even though I have a few other patches applied...).

Here is a small timing.

Vanilla Sage-5.0.rc0:

```
sage: K = GF(2)
sage: %time A = random_matrix(K,20000,20000)
CPU times: user 0.29 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.31 s
Wall time: 0.31 s
sage: %time B = random_matrix(K,20000,20000)
CPU times: user 0.23 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 0.26 s
Wall time: 0.27 s
sage: %time (A*B).rank()
CPU times: user 11.70 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 11.75 s
Wall time: 11.81 s
19937
```

Sage-5.0.beta13 with the new spkgs (and some other patches that shouldn't affect the timing for matrix multiplication):

```
sage: K = GF(2)
sage: %time A = random_matrix(K,20000,20000)
CPU times: user 0.30 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 0.33 s
Wall time: 0.33 s
sage: %time B = random_matrix(K,20000,20000)
CPU times: user 0.32 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.33 s
Wall time: 0.33 s
sage: %time (A*B).rank()
CPU times: user 11.70 s, sys: 0.10 s, total: 11.80 s
Wall time: 11.83 s
19937
```
Well, at least there is no slow-down...

Do you claim that the new version of M4RI is faster? You do claim a speed-up for M4RIE, on #12841.

No, M4RI shouldn't have changed (at least the stuff, only bugfixes & refactoring. 

That said, there's a new function for inverting upper triangular matrices which is much faster than the generic method, but it's not exposed yet. I need to implement the same for lower triangular matrices, then we can speed up inversions in general.

Furthermore, M4RI ships its own PNG reader/writer now which is much faster than what we have in Sage and uses much less memory. Again, it's not used yet. This patch just gets the new version in.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A24):
> Why are you using `PKG_CHECK_MODULES()` to check for PNG support in `configure.ac`?  Why not `AC_CHECK_LIB()` or `AC_SEARCH_LIBS()`?

We are doing both. We try `pkg-config` first and if that fails we fall back to `AC_CHECK_LIB`. In your log above, `PKG_CHECK_MODULES()` fails to find libpng and `AC_CHECK_LIB()` finds it.

Actually, it's not quite like that.  `PKG_CHECK_MODULES()` found `libpng12`  but you still try to link with `-lpng` instead of `-lpng12` (the first failure comes from the `libpng14` check).  `AC_CHECK_LIB()` isn't called (but it would fail).

Could someone please review this. I am looking into updating LinBox and updating M4RIE is a requirement for that (long story involving Givaro).

That's strange, it doesn't check?

I had to update SPKG because I didn't add "-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include" before but we need it now because of the PNG dependency. The newest SPKG installs fine on geom.math which doesn't have a system libpng-dev.

I've tried this on Fedora 17 (which doesn't have libpng12 either, its up to libpng15 now) and configure works as intended:

```
checking whether to build with PNG support... yes
checking for pkg-config... /usr/bin/pkg-config
checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes
checking for PNG... yes
```
Jeroen, you might have overlooked this part in the log since it comes after the lengthy "checking for cache sizes...".

I'm building on eno right now and if it works I'll set this ticket to positive review.
