The Python spkg is notorious for never, ever passing SAGE_CHECK tests. There are always several test failures that really just indicate that certain extra software (tcl, for example) isn't installed. These errors are harmless, and fortunately we can easily avoid those tests. In `spkg-check`, we need 

```
make EXTRATESTOPTS="-x test_foo -x test_bar" test
```
to exclude tests `foo` and `bar` from running.

We need to decide what tests to exclude, on what platforms, and then change the spkg so that it succeeds with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`.

Let me point out the obvious: whatever you do on this ticket should of course be based on Python 2.7.2 at #9958.

More testing:

- on sage.math and hawk (OpenSolaris on x86): `test_distutils` was the only failure.
- on several skynet machines (cicero, eno, sextus, taurus), `test_distutils` and `test_urllib2_localnet` failed.
- on several other skynet machines (cleo, iras: the itanium machines): the same failures as in the previous case, and also `test_io`.
- on skynet machine flavius, testing hangs apparently at `test_io`.
- on skynet machine mark (SunOS on sparc), same failures as for cicero et al., and also `test_socket`, `test_sunaudiodev`, `test_uuid`.
- on skynet machine silius (Linux on ppc64, not an officially supported platform for Sage), testing seems to have crashed, so it didn't print a report of which tests failed.

Here's the report on OS X 10.4 PPC.

```
2 tests failed:
    test_ctypes test_distutils
37 tests skipped:
    test_aepack test_al test_applesingle test_bsddb test_bsddb3
    test_cd test_cl test_codecmaps_cn test_codecmaps_hk
    test_codecmaps_jp test_codecmaps_kr test_codecmaps_tw test_curses

    test_socketserver test_startfile test_sunaudiodev test_timeout
    test_tk test_ttk_guionly test_urllib2net test_urllibnet
    test_winreg test_winsound test_zipfile64
5 skips unexpected on darwin:
    test_aepack test_applesingle test_macos test_scriptpackages
    test_ttk_guionly
```
I would agree that it is surprising that `test_macos` would be skipped on ... Mac OS.  Anyway, no surprises.

It would be nice to have documented here (and/or in SPKG.txt or something) exactly why we think each of them are okay to skip.

Thanks! I'll be sure to work with that.

Yes, we should definitely document the reasoning in SPKG.txt.
