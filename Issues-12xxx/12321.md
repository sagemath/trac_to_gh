The Python spkg is notorious for never, ever passing SAGE_CHECK tests. There are always several test failures that really just indicate that certain extra software (tcl, for example) isn't installed. These errors are harmless, and fortunately we can easily avoid those tests. In `spkg-check`, we need 

```
make EXTRATESTOPTS="-x test_foo -x test_bar" test
```
to exclude tests `foo` and `bar` from running.

We need to decide what tests to exclude, on what platforms, and then change the spkg so that it succeeds with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`.

More testing:

- on sage.math and hawk (OpenSolaris on x86): `test_distutils` was the only failure.
- on several skynet machines (cicero, eno, sextus, taurus), `test_distutils` and `test_urllib2_localnet` failed.
- on several other skynet machines (cleo, iras: the itanium machines): the same failures as in the previous case, and also `test_io`.
- on skynet machine flavius, testing hangs apparently at `test_io`.
- on skynet machine mark (SunOS on sparc), same failures as for cicero et al., and also `test_socket`, `test_sunaudiodev`, `test_uuid`.
- on skynet machine silius (Linux on ppc64, not an officially supported platform for Sage), testing seems to have crashed, so it didn't print a report of which tests failed.

Here's the report on OS X 10.4 PPC.

5 skips unexpected on darwin:
    test_aepack test_applesingle test_macos test_scriptpackages
    test_ttk_guionly
```
I would agree that it is surprising that `test_macos` would be skipped on ... Mac OS.  Anyway, no surprises.

It would be nice to have documented here (and/or in SPKG.txt or something) exactly why we think each of them are okay to skip.
