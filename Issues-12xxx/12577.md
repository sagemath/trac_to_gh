It would be nice if the  `_convert()` method of symbolic expressions were made visible (and possibly renamed, if "convert" is too general). This has come up in two or three times before, and I needed it long before I bothered to ask for help:

I wonder if, rather than just directly expose `_convert`, there could either be a flag for `numerical_approx`, or some sister-method to `numerical_approx` which is similar but only converts already numerical terms in the expression (as `_convert` itself does).  But the API should be more user-friendly, more along the lines of `numerical_approx`.

The problem with `numerical_approx` is it ends with some checks like:

```
        # we have to consider constants as well, since infinity is a constant
        # in pynac
        if is_a_numeric(x._gobj):
            res = py_object_from_numeric(x._gobj)
        elif  is_a_constant(x._gobj):
            res = x.pyobject()
        else:
            raise TypeError("cannot evaluate symbolic expression numerically")
```

where the last case is what you get if you tried to convert some arbitrary expression (like a polynomial, or solution to a DE) to "numerical".

So yes, what we probably want here is something more like `_convert`, but still a wrapper around it that specifies the allowed keyword arguments, and is maybe specifically geared toward arbitrary-precision numerical results.

I think it's useful in general to be able to change "back" from an approximate ring to an exact one. A trivial example:

```
sage: f = RR(1)*x
sage: f
1.00000000000000*x
sage: f._convert(QQ)
x
```

But I agree that the user interface is key. The name "convert" is no good -- it's too general anyway but doesn't tell you what's being converted. Partially as a result of those two things, it's also not discoverable via tab-completion.

The best altername name that I've been able to come up with so far is `change_ring_of_constants`. It mirrors the `change_ring` method for e.g. vectors and matrices, and will be obviously what you want if you see it in the tab-completion list.

The benefit of `change_ring...` is that it's name is "obvious" if you're familiar with the same functionality for lattices, matrices, vectors, modules, etc. It's been years, but I'd like to think that when I was looking for this method, I tried `expr.change<tab>` first. And for better or worse, the ring-changing methods already return a copy rather than switching the ring in-place:

```
sage: A = identity_matrix(QQ,3)
sage: A.change_ring(ZZ)
[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]
sage: A.base_ring()
Rational Field
```

So, returning a copy is at least consistent. But aside from the nominal similarity to `change_ring`, I don't have a strong preference for the name. Something like `expr.with_constants_in_ring(R)` could also work.

Removing the "beginner" tag from old tickets. Some could be returned to beginner-friendly status by adding a comment about what needs to be done. Some others might be easy for an experienced developer to finish.

Related ticket: #24850.
