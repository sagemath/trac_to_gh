Part of metaticket #12024.

Just a bunch of little classes for working with "optimized" polynomials, which is actually used somewhere, evidently.  Not a single example.  Either doctest it completely, by following how it is used by polynomial_element.pyx, or delete it because maybe fast_callable is better?  But watch out for large degree, since fast_callable segfaults if the degree is large, so this polynomial_compiled.pyx might have some real value.

Component: **algebra**
