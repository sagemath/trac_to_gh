The script `spkg/install` contains the lines

```
# Skip the rest if nothing to do (i.e., to [re]build):
# If "make" doesn't understand the -q option (although we require
# GNU make, which supports it), it should exit with a non-zero status
# which is not a problem.
if ${MAKE:-make} -q -f standard/deps $1; then
    echo "Nothing to (re)build / all up-to-date."
    exit 0
fi
```

This runs `make` with the `-q` option, which (via the makefile `spkg/standard/deps`) in turn runs `sage-spkg`.  This changed recently, before #12016 `make -q` didn't run `sage-spkg`.

When upgrading, the file `sage-spkg` is not automatically upgraded, so we can have an old `sage-spkg` which does not understand the `-q` option which causes build errors (only visible in the log files), for example in `spkg/logs/patch-2.5.9.p2.log`.

This is a problem introduced by #12016.

I disagree since it causes non-fatal build errors.  Seeing a scary message "An error occured... please contact sage-devel..." isn't good.  Besides, this might possibly lead to an actual build failure.
