```
Consider the following:

```
sage: f(x) = x; f
x |--> x
sage: integral(f, x)
x |--> 1/2*x^2
sage: integral(f, x, 0, 1)
x |--> 1/2
```
The last integral has not "happened" to be constant - it does not depend on x mathematically, so it should not depend on x in Sage.

Multivariate case:

```
sage: f(x, y) = x + y
sage: f
(x, y) |--> x + y
sage: integral(f, x, 0, 1)
(x, y) |--> y + 1/2
sage: _(3)
y + 1/2 
```
`integral(...)` here should return a symbolic function that depends on y only, so that the last evaluation gives `7/2` (and there are no warning about unnamed evaluation - the order of variables is the same as for the original function with one variable dropped).

The offending lines are

```
    if is_CallableSymbolicExpressionRing(self._parent):
        return self._parent(integral(ring.SR(self), *args, **kwds))
```
So if we start with at function depending on x and y, the result will also be a function depending on x and y. 

The question is now in distinguishing definite and indefinite integrals, as they have to be treated differently.

```
