1. The output of this new method is another curve over QQ, which is isomorphic over QQbar, but possibly not isomorphic over QQ. That is not clear from the documentation.
   2. Also, why is it called "reduce_poly" and not simply "reduce"?
   3. Related to 1. it would be great to also have a function that gives something isomorphic over QQ, and in that case also an isomorphism defined over QQ. This could be done with the same function if you make it (for example) "def reduce(self, rational=True, isomorphism=False)".

I'd say 1. is required for a positive review. 3 may be something for a later ticket if it is too much work.

Created ticket #12209 for number 3.

It is called reduce_poly as there is already a general scheme method called reduce whichÂ  

"Return the corresponding reduced algebraic space associated to this scheme."
