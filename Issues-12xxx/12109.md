I've implemented a function for evaluating cyclotomic polynomials without having to explicitly create the polynomial: this gives both memory and speed savings for large n.

Some lines are to long. Maximum line length should be 79 characters.

<code>\`n\`th</code> creates a bad rendered reference manual (HTML), <code>\`n\`-th</code> should work.

`\divides` seems to be an unknown command. Reference manual (HTML) shows

```
System Message: WARNING/2 (\Phi_n(x) = \prod_{d \divides n} (x^d - 1)^{\mu(n / d)})
```
use `\mid` instead.

There is a double "that" in `parity_divisors()`.

Please add an example for `_x = Integer(x)` fails.

Not necessary for positive review but could you also change

```
raise *Error, "..."
```
to

```
raise *Error("...")
```

I changed comments and documentation to less than 79 characters, but left a couple of code snippets longer than that since they were less than 85 and I thought that introducing a line break would make it less clear.  Let me know if you want me to change it.

Apply 12109.2.patch only.

I've changed it so that it tries to just call PARI (and fixed the timeout problem).  But that won't always work, since not every ring in Sage can convert to PARI.

I don't strongly object to just falling back on `cyclotomic_polynomial` in this case, but the current code will provide a speedup in some cases.  Of course those cases are probably rarely of interest....

I'd prefer to keep your generic code in if it really handles some corner cases better than going through `cyclotomic_polynomial`.
Could provide an example of a ring where this additional code would be of interest?
