I doubt that this is possible to stopgap very well.  I mean, the only way to really tell is to solve the equation!  It's probably unsolvable in some appropriate sense even to determine when such missed solutions might happen. 

I don't think it's appropriate to *always* add the warning.  That would imply solve is totally unreliable, which isn't true - it is often quite good.  But having a documenting of the bug seems appropriate.  Maybe I'm already forgetting how stopgaps are implemented, though.

Stopgaps are implemented by just showing a warning to the user (but only the first time that a warning for a given ticket would be triggered).  At whatever point in the code where it's appropriate, you call stopgap.  See #12691.

I would also like to avoid displaying a warning every time the user calls solve.

I'm not sure what the right solution is here though.
