The zn_poly spkg currently does not respect the `CC` environment variable, we should fix this (for instance for #12426).

**New spkg:** [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/zn_poly-0.9.p8.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/zn_poly-0.9.p8.spkg)

**md5sum:** `f0a331ed68c28b748c2d3ca3bade9865  zn_poly-0.9.p8.spkg`

### zn_poly-0.9.p8 (Leif Leonhardy, April 20th, 2012)
* #12433: Further reviewer changes / additions.
* Work around GCC 4.7.0 bug on ia64 (by almost completely disabling optimi-
  zation if the compiler is GCC 4.7.x, of course only on that platform); cf.
  #12751, #12765.
* Add a patch to avoid conflicting definitions (i.e., redundant `typedefs`)
  of `ulong`, by changing `ulong` to a macro.
* Don't hardcode the zn_poly version number in `spkg-install`; instead read
  it from the file `VERSION`, like the generated `makefile` does.
* Remove some of the code previously just commented out, as well as some
  obsolete comments.
* Document patches (and correct ticket reference in an old changelog entry).

### zn_poly-0.9.p7 (Leif Leonhardy, April 8th, 2012)
* #12433: Reviewer changes.
* Restore upstream sources. (One file in `src/tune/` was already patched.)
* Remove the obsolete Debian `dist/` directory.
* Use `patch` to apply the patches.
* Remove `patches/` from `.hgignore`! (And remove the prepatched files.)
* Add Python to the dependencies, since (some) Python is needed to create
  the Makefile during build / `configure`.  (`spkg/standard/deps` already
  reflects this.)
* Rework (upstream's) `makemakefile.py` to create a proper Makefile,
  respecting `CC`, `CXX`, `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS` etc. with their
  *usual* meaning (i.e., not using `CPP` to compile C++!), and using `LDFLAGS`
  consistently, also not hardcoding e.g. `-m64` (which was added by Sage).
* Do not add `-O3` to `CFLAGS` (in `spkg-install`) without the possibility to
  get overridden by user-provided `CFLAGS`.  Also honor `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` by
  completely disabling optimization in that case.
* Fix typo in `spkg-check`, which certainly would break building the test
  program when `SAGE64=yes`.  (Although it is actually already built from
  within `spkg-install`.)
* Clean up `spkg-install` and `spkg-check`; redirect error messages to
  `stderr`, add more error checks, use `$MAKE` in `spkg-check` as well,
  quote more environment variables, use `cp [-f]` instead of `$CP`, don't
  create an absolute symbolic link on Cygwin.

I don't think so.
