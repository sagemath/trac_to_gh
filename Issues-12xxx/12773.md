Despite of patchbot complains, the new patch passes all tests for me on Sage-5.0.beta11 and documentation builds and looks OK as well.

There is some inconsistency in how it appears in the list of interfaces: "R Interface" as opposed to "Interface to X" for most (but not all) others.

I think that we should not prohibit top-level imports - if it is something that is used in a module often or it is in a time-critical function, such imports are better, as far as I understand.

However it is a separate issue and I think that the new patch is a reasonable work-around for including R interface into documentation. So positive review again.
