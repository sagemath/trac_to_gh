The R/Sage interface is not in the reference manual, which is really unfortunate!

Apply [attachment:trac_12773-r.patch] and [attachment:trac_12773-ref.patch] to the Sage library.

Despite of patchbot complains, the new patch passes all tests for me on Sage-5.0.beta11 and documentation builds and looks OK as well.

There is some inconsistency in how it appears in the list of interfaces: "R Interface" as opposed to "Interface to X" for most (but not all) others.
