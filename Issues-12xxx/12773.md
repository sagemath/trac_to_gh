Despite of patchbot complains, the new patch passes all tests for me on Sage-5.0.beta11 and documentation builds and looks OK as well.

There is some inconsistency in how it appears in the list of interfaces: "R Interface" as opposed to "Interface to X" for most (but not all) others.

Here's a patch which fixes the problem. With the various patches to Sphinx (for example, #12489), when you import a function at the top level, its documentation seems to get imported, too. So this patch moves some of those top-level imports to just where they are needed.

I think that we should not prohibit top-level imports - if it is something that is used in a module often or it is in a time-critical function, such imports are better, as far as I understand.

However it is a separate issue and I think that the new patch is a reasonable work-around for including R interface into documentation. So positive review again.
