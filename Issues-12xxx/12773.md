Despite of patchbot complains, the new patch passes all tests for me on Sage-5.0.beta11 and documentation builds and looks OK as well.

There is some inconsistency in how it appears in the list of interfaces: "R Interface" as opposed to "Interface to X" for most (but not all) others.

The best thing to do is to check each file in the reference manual (!) to see that we don't have lots of redundant documentation lying around. I suppose one could just grep for top-level imports and check those files. I have no idea how big a problem it is; I haven't seen any other problems doing a little spot-checking, and I don't know what triggered the problem with this file.  (Adding `from keyword import iskeyword` in another file, say `sage/interfaces/tachyon.py`, also causes problems in that file.)",

I think that it's best to avoid top-level imports. The best thing to do is to check each file in the reference manual (!) to see that we don't have lots of redundant documentation lying around. I suppose one could just grep for top-level imports and check those files. I have no idea how big a problem it is; I haven't seen any other problems doing a little spot-checking, and I don't know what triggered the problem with this file.  (Adding `from keyword import iskeyword` in another file, say `sage/interfaces/tachyon.py`, also causes problems in that file.)

I think that we should not prohibit top-level imports - if it is something that is used in a module often or it is in a time-critical function, such imports are better, as far as I understand.

However it is a separate issue and I think that the new patch is a reasonable work-around for including R interface into documentation. So positive review again.
