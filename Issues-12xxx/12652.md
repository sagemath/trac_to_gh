experimental spkg vtk is seriously old, apparently still from times Sage used Python 2.5. 

Needless to say, it doesn't work any more, and the corresponding docs in [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/numerical_sage/installation_linux.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/numerical_sage/installation_linux.html) are obsolete. 
Yet people still [try](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/ERprElsUCL4/discussion) to follow these...
