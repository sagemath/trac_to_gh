```
Applying #9054 to sage 4.7.2 factorization does not work anymore in some cases:

```
sage: k.<x> = FunctionField(GF(5))
sage: R.<y> = k[]
sage: (y^3-x^3+x).factor(proof=False)
NotImplementedError: proof = True factorization not implemented.  Call factor with proof=False.
```

The problem is that with #10635 the `proof` parameter is not passed on anymore to `_factor_univariate_polynomial()`. As a workaround one can of course call `k._factor_univariate_polynomial((f,proof=False)` directly.

I must have been working with an old version of #9054. The behaviour described above does actually not happen with the current version of #9054. This ticket can be closed. Sorry.
