The M4RIE (cf. #9562) test script has dependencies on some libraries which are not made explicit in `spkg/standard/deps` or `SPKG.txt`. These include (at least) Givaro, NTL and GMP/MPIR. Since the Sage build script doesn't know about these dependencies, this means that building Sage in parallel with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` can fail.
