The M4RIE (cf. #9562) test script has dependencies on some libraries which are not made explicit in `spkg/standard/deps` or `SPKG.txt`. These include (at least) Givaro, NTL and GMP/MPIR. Since the Sage build script doesn't know about these dependencies, this means that building Sage in parallel with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` can fail.

**Apply** [attachment: trac12245_m4rie_fix_deps.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12245/trac12245_m4rie_fix_deps.2.patch.gz) to Sage root repository.
