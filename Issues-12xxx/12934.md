Some components of Sage, e.g., libsingular, link in the systemwide libtermcap.so dynamically instead of statically linking the libtermcap.a that is built by the Sage termcap spkg.  This is a *big problem* when building a binary on a system that has libtermcap.so and trying to run it on another system that does not have that so.

Solution?: Modifying the spkg-install script for termcap so it also builds the so libraries. 

* See also #12725, which changes the termcap spkg...
