The scripts `sage-sdist` and `sage-bdist` create a directory within `$SAGE_ROOT/dist` and then pack that directory in a tarball.  The result is that `dist` contains both the original directory as well as the tarball.  Currently, `sage-rsyncdist` removes this directory.  Change the behaviour such that it keeps the directory.

Use case: in the release management script, `dist/sage-rsync` would contain all extracted spkgs.  This would allow for an easy check that every spkg is hg-clean, that there are no uncommitted changes.

Making this a blocker for immediate release-management use.
