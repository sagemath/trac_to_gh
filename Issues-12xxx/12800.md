`spkg-install` needs some work; see my attached reviewer patch.

Doesn't make sense to comment out the `patch` loop; I wouldn't have deleted the `patches/` directory either (but my patch doesn't restore it).

If `../patches` is either empty or non-existent, then `../patches/*` will expand literally to "`../patches/*`".  Since "`../patches/*`" isn't a file, the line

```
[ -f "$patch" ] || continue
```
will ensure that there are no error messages.

Yes, but it then would make more sense to `break` rather than `continue`.

But to perform some loop-invariant code motion, it would be better to just use

```sh
ls ../patches/*.patch &>/dev/null &&
echo "Applying patches to upstream source..." &&
for patch in ../patches/*.patch; do
    ...
```

Although in that case also `[ -f "$patch" ]` yields true, so `continue` isn't reached.

I don't think there is anything wrong with my code.  It's simple and actually catches more special cases than your proposals (such as `patches/foo.patch` being a directory).

Well, I think the only "special cases" we want to (or have to) handle here are:

* `../patches/` doesn't exist.

* The directory exists, but it is empty, or at least doesn't contain files matching `*.patch`.


(I won't insist on changing the `continue`, but it seems more natural [and actually is more efficient] to place a single test outside the loop.  Also, conditionally printing "Applying patches..." seems reasonable to me.)

If you wanted to go triple-safe, you'd have to use `[ -r "$patch" ]` instead of `[ -f ... ]`.

I don't have the same problem on `hawk`.  Are you using `/usr/local/bin/gcc`, i.e. gcc 4.4.3 on hawk?

Compiling with `CC=suncc` should also work.
