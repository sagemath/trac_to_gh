Leif, I added almost all of your changes, the spkg is at the same location.  I patched the `patch` loop in a different way, now it is:

```
# Apply all patches
for patch in ../patches/*.patch; do
    [ -f "$patch" ] || continue
    basename "$patch"
    if ! patch -p1 <"$patch"; then
        echo >&2 "Error: patch '$patch' failed to apply."
        exit 1

done

Does that loop works even if the ../patches/ directory is empty? Or does it give a file not found error? Not that it matters as long as there is a patch, but that's the first thing that came to my mind reading this...

If `../patches` is either empty or non-existent, then `../patches/*` will expand literally to "`../patches/*`".  Since "`../patches/*`" isn't a file, the line

```
[ -f "$patch" ] || continue
```
will ensure that there are no error messages.

Yes, but it then would make more sense to `break` rather than `continue`.

But to perform some loop-invariant code motion, it would be better to just use

```sh
ls ../patches/*.patch &>/dev/null &&
echo "Applying patches to upstream source..." &&
for patch in ../patches/*.patch; do
    ...
```

Well, I think the only "special cases" we want to (or have to) handle here are:

* `../patches/` doesn't exist.

* The directory exists, but it is empty, or at least doesn't contain files matching `*.patch`.


(I won't insist on changing the `continue`, but it seems more natural [and actually is more efficient] to place a single test outside the loop.  Also, conditionally printing "Applying patches..." seems reasonable to me.)

If you wanted to go triple-safe, you'd have to use `[ -r "$patch" ]` instead of `[ -f ... ]`.
