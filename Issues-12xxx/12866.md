In Magma:

```
Br:=BrandtModule(2,7);
g:=Br.1-Br.2;
InnerProduct(g,g);
6
```
In Sage:

```
Br = BrandtModule(2,7)
g1,g2 = Br.basis()
g = g1-g2
print g1,g2
print g.monodromy_pairing(g)
(1, 0) (0, 1)
2
```

I rebased Aly's patch to sage-6.4.beta1. I added a series of commits to fix a typo in her patch, add some explanation of the computation that is being done, and then an asymptotic improvement so that the monodromy pairing can be computed in O(n) rather than O(n<sup>2</sup>) ideal computations.
