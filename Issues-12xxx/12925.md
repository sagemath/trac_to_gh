I just pushed a reviewer patch on the queue doing that and a couple other minor improvements.
If you are happy we my changes, I guess we can fold everything together, and declare it as done.

I am heading for the CRM now.

We have discussed this quite some with the Sage-Combinat people.
Here is the rationale for putting a thematic tutorial in the Sage
sources when there is a natural spot for it ("transversal" tutorials
should definitely go in the thematic tutorial directory):

- It's available from `sage: sage.combinat.tutorial?`
  which I find a very desirable feature.

- It keeps it close to the related sources. Among the advantages are:
  - a curious reader browsing the sources will find it
  - running `sage -t` on sage.combinat will run the tests there
  - grepping or query/replacing through sage/combinat will find it

- It's possible to refer to it from the reference manual (ok, that's a
  bad argument: linking the thematic tutorials from the reference
  manual ought to be possible, but this is another story).

Note that we already have a `sage.rings.padics.tutorial`.

Of course, this tutorial should be linked from the thematic tutorial
index. The reason I did not do it right away is that there is a patch
with other tutorials coming shortly which includes a bit of
reorganization of the that index, and I wanted to avoid trivial
conflicts.

What do you think?

I am putting this back to needs review, and let you put it back to positive review.

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

If it were in thematic tutorials, something like this still ought to be doable (say, using `sage.combinat.tutorial()` instead), using modifications of the commands from sagedoc.py that allow `tutorial()` to open the tutorial.

Anyway, my original question was, as I said, a matter of curiosity, not a criticism. I don't mind setting this back to "positive review", although it would be good (on another ticket – please cc me if you open one) to tidy up the documentation in the ways you seem to suggest in your comment. And the code in sagedoc.py could be modified to allow easy opening of the various thematic tutorials.

Yeah, but it's really not as good: you need to teach people yet
another way to access documentation. The user should just need to know
about '?'.

I definitely was a good question. And I wanted to take the time to
answer since others are likely to ask it as well :-)

Thanks for your interest. I hope to get to this done soon: we want this to be in Sage for the
Sage Days in July! Now, I'll be traveling around the next couple

In the upcoming updated patch, I have fixed the tutorial to not test at all one of the longest tests (it was marked random anyway), and to avoid a recomputation in another long test. I used the occasion to record the time needed for the other long tests. On my machine running the tests with -long goes from 65s down to 35s. I guess that should do the job.

Jeroen: since the change is essentially trivial and is only about doctests (see diff below), do you mind reviewing it, just to make the merge cycle faster?

Thanks!

Hugh: feel free to beat Jeroen :-)

I really would like to see this in 5.1, for the upcoming Sage Days 40.
