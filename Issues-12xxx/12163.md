From [this conversation](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/abe39e9167ab386c) on sage-devel :

```
Using n() sometimes returns the wrong number of digits

This is correct:

sage: a = n(golden_ratio, digits=5000)
sage: len(str(a))
5001

This is not:

sage: a = n(golden_ratio, digits=5000000)
sage: len(str(a))
4999989

Any clue?

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
I think that this is in fact a dup of (or at any rate should be solved by the patch at) #10164 :) caused by the BDFL not reading all the posts in a thread carefully enough :)  Presumably this fixes it.

By the way, the doctests at that ticket are themselves quite entertaining.

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
With #10164:

```
sage:  a = n(golden_ratio, digits=5000)
sage: len(str(a))
5001
sage: a = n(golden_ratio, digits=5000000)
lsage: len(str(a))
5000004
```
So let's close as a dup.
