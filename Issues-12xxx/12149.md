The optimizations in #10314 ignored the fact that floating point numbers can be nan, which leads to it being trivial to completely crash Sage.  I ran into exactly this when doing real work, so I'm annoyed. 

```
sage: float('nan') > 1

Program received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.
0x00007fff89c3b82a in __kill ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007fff89c3b82a in __kill ()

```

The traceback points to this code integer.pyx:

```
            elif PyFloat_CheckExact(left):
                c = -mpz_cmp_d((<Integer>right).value, PyFloat_AsDouble(left))
```

There is similar code a few lines down for the other direction, hence this also crashes

```

To me, using signal handling instead of simply checking whether or not the float is a nan (using isfinite) is a much worse solution to this problem.    Do you think otherwise, and if so, why?

I was not proposing it as a solution to this problem, just to add the signal handling in addition as an extra safeguard.

Ideally there would have been `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` already, such that this ticket would say:

```
sage: float('nan') > 1
Tracback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: Floating Point Error
```
which doesn't crash Sage.

`float('nan')` does not result in an error. Comparison must not result in an error, according to Python specifications, if I remember correctly.

Hence, using sigon/sigoff seems the wrong thing to do, because of the raised floating point error. In addition: Wouldn't sigon/sigoff slow the code down? I don't know by how much, though.

Within Cython code, sig_on/sig_off is **never** the wrong thing to do.  It might be unneeded, might slow things down, but it is never wrong.

Yes, it would.  Typically, the slowdown is in the 10ns~20ns range which is very little unless it's done in a tight loop.

OK, let me rephrase it: It is wrong to use sig_on/sig_off in comparison code without "try-except". And, if I am not mistaken, "try-except" adds another small overhead. I presume that comparison occurs very frequently in many applications, and thus I'd go for speed.

That's to say: We should test both versions, William's and the "try-sigon-sigoff-except" version, and compare timings.

> Why is that?

Because comparison in Python must not result in an error, if I remember correctly the Python specifications.

Here are timings, using `a = 1, b = 2, c = 1".

Vanilla sage-4.8.alpha3:

```
sage: timeit("a==b",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 271 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==c",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 268 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==x",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 13.8 µs per loop
```

William's patch:

```
sage: timeit("a==b",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 260 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==c",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 266 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==x",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 14.7 µs per loop
```

try-sigon-sigoff-except:

```
sage: timeit("a==b",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 272 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==c",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 266 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==x",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 13.6 µs per loop
```

So, it is not really that much of a difference.

So it's a minor issue about specifications, not a big deal.  Doing something against the Python specifications isn't an issue if you're trying to avoid complete crashes of Sage.

It's like airbags: sure, people might have hearing problems because of an airbag deployment, but that's a minor issue compared to what the airbag prevents.

Here are better timings (I hope):

Unpatched 4.8.alpha3:

```
sage: a = 1
sage: b = float(1)
sage: c = float(2.5)
sage: timeit("a==b",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 320 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==c",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 323 ns per loop
```

With William's patch:

```
sage: a = 1
sage: b = float(1)
sage: c = float(2.5)
sage: d = float('nan')
sage: timeit("a==b",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 336 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==c",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 333 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==d",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 281 ns per loop
```

With the sig_on/off alternative:

```
sage: a = 1
sage: b = float(1)
sage: c = float(2.5)
sage: d = float('nan')
sage: timeit("a==b",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 369 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==c",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 369 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==c",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 369 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a==d",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.92 µs per loop
```

I don't know the standard deviation of these timings (does "timeit" offer such statistics?) - when repeating the tests, I sometimes got 380 ns, not 369 ns.

But the timings seem to suggest that William's patch is 10% faster in the "number" case and is a lot faster in the "not a number" case.

By the way: it's almost impossible that simply adding `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` would make the execution time jump from 281ns to 3.92µs, so probably you did something wrong there.

Don't forget the time for catching the error. My code looks like

```
               try:
                   sig_on()
                   c = mpz_cmp_d((<Integer>left).value, PyFloat_AsDouble(right))

               except RuntimeError:
                   return False
```
I doubt that this is obviously wrong, provided that we want to return "False" instead of letting the runtime error be raised.
