I've been unable to reproduce that, so I don't know how I got Pari's self-tests to pass that one time.

It seems to me that our current viable choices are

1. Test whether the platform is Lion, and if so, turn off optimization.  (Using `-O0` should work; I don't know about `-O1`, but I'm testing that now.)

2. Test whether the platform is Lion, and if so, turn off optimization for the single file causing problems.

3. Test whether the platform is Lion and the compiler is a bad one (I'm not sure what qualifies beyond the current GCC/LLVM thing in !XCode), and if so, turn off optimization.

I can prepare an spkg doing the first of these, but I'm not sure about how to do #2 the right way, and I don't know enough about which compiler(s) are bad and which are good to do #3.

It's pretty painful to deal with anything else on OS X.  We couldn't even really use the fink or macports gcc, because we currently require people to rename or remove from their path anything in /sw.

Unless we create an spkg "gcc" which works properly with Sage.  I noticed somebody made an experimental package "gcc" but I haven't tried it.

If the problem is a single file, the file [should be](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-1108/msg00007.html) `src/src/kernel/none/gcdll.c`.  I tried compiling just that file with `-O0`, but I still got self test failures -- not as many, but a few:

```
ell-sta.dif
ell.dyn.dif
```
To build this way, I patched the file `src/src/kernel/gmp/MakeLVL1.SH`, adding in the `-O0` flag.

For what it's worth, on this particular machine, it took about 19 minutes to run self tests after compiling all of Pari with `-O0`, and it took about 15 minutes compiling most with `-O3` and just the one file with `-O0`.

I consider option 3 a total non-option unless there is a fully working alternative GCC spkg available.   If there were, that would be the way to go.  I posted to sage-devel to see if anybody has something like this.

- Should we make this change only for Pari, or should we do this when building all of Sage?  I have a feeling we do it on a case-by-case basis, since I think that not all spkgs respect the CC variable.  I tried it with cvxopt (see #12011), and it didn't seem to help, but it's worth exploring more...

I've posted an spkg which tests whether we're using an 'LLVM' version of gcc 4.2.1.

Hmm, but see [Georg's post](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/d9a00d4bb84474c4/f88220b8e72e5b12?show_docid=f88220b8e72e5b12) about this on sage-devel:

```
Stay with the old "FSF-flavor" Apple version of gcc v4.2.1 "build 
5666.3", as has been included in XCode 3.2.6, 4.0. and 4.1 (but no 
longer from 4.2 onwards), and that gcc42 package. 
```
So maybe this will go away, and we might not want to rely on it.
