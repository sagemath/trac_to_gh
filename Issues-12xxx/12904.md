This is great diagnosis and a nice terse doctest.   I've looked through this a fair amount and the only obvious problem (other than the doctest failure below) I can find is that 

```
sage: timeit('colors.has_key("blue")')
625 loops, best of 3: 205 ns per loop
sage: timeit('"blue" in colors')
625 loops, best of 3: 230 ns per loop
```
and more or less this is true all the time.  I don't know if there is any documentation on which is uniformly faster?  In some sense the second seems more "Pythonic" but OO syntax is nice too...

I also wonder why the switch to the new Python error raising but not the new formatting :) but that is really totally unimportant.

But did you run tests?

```

```
I have a feeling that this is also indicative:

```
sage: colors['blue']
RGB color (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
sage: Color('blue')
RGB color (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
sage: type(colors['blue'])

sage: type(Color('blue'))
<class 'sage.plot.colors.Color'>
sage: colors['blue'] == Color('blue')
False
```
Anyway, I'm a little surprised because `colors` has a constructor from `Color`... but needs work.

What do you mean by *new formatting*?

`has_key` is deprecated, see [docs.python](http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=has_key#dict.has_key), that's why I replaced it.
BTW, I got

```
sage: timeit('colors.has_key("blue")') 
625 loops, best of 3: 186 ns per loop
sage: timeit('"blue" in colors')      
625 loops, best of 3: 187 ns per loop
```
