This is needed for #12369 (and would probably have provided an easier fix for #12131): I can't convince gcc-4.4.6 to install its libraries in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`, it always uses `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib64` on `sage.math.washington.edu`.

Volker, in your GCC spkg, you copy files from `lib64` to `lib`.  This suffers from all the problems you mentioned here.  It has the additional problem that you need to decide *which* files you copy.

So I still think changing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is the best solution.  But I'm certainly open to suggestions...

Yes, that would make a lot of sense.

No.

Exactly, there might be some subtleties with parallel builds though.  But GCC (the package this is about) normally isn't built in parallel with anything else, so it doesn't really matter.

Even with parallel builds, if `deps` is correct, then if two packages are built at the same time, they shouldn't install things in `local/lib64` that the other one needs. There could be a race condition in creating `local/lib64`, I suppose, but that should be avoidable.
