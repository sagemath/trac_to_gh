This is a rather subtle issue, related to Solaris' headers, and the fact that GCC (4.7.0) now defines `__cplusplus` to `199711L`, while previous versions defined it to just `1`.

If `__cplusplus >= 199711L`, a lot of overloaded (originally C) functions like `div()` and `log()` get defined in the `std` namespace (if one includes `math.h`), e.g.

```c++
float std::log(float);             // logf() in C
double std::log(double);           // log() in C
long double std::log(long double); // logl() in C
```
which is correct in the first place, but on Solaris these also end up in the **global** namespace:

```c++
// /usr/include/math.h

...

#if __cplusplus >= 199711L
...
using std::log;
...
#endif

```

Now FLINTQS happens to call `log()` with an `unsigned long` (without a cast) in one place, and with the overloaded functions present as well, the call gets ambiguous.  The obvious, trivial fix is to just cast the argument to a `double`, such that `double log(double)` gets called (as before).

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/flintqs-20070817.p7.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/flintqs-20070817.p7.spkg)

### flintqs-20070817.p7 (Jeroen Demeyer, 25 May 2012)
* Trac #12855: Only call log() on float or double types.  This works
  around a problem with Solaris' libc where log() in C++ is overloaded
  for float, double and long double but not integer types.
* Use `patch` for patching, use standard template for spkg-install.
* Don't retry the build upon failure on x86_64, which seems pointless
  after #11351.

The diff looks good as far as it goes, and #9544 (based on this) installs fine and passes relevant tests on OS X 10.6.  

I can't test whether this actually works on Solaris or know whether these fixes are right, have to take your word for it. The Mac fix isn't mentioned on this ticket, either, and I can't check if it's necessary or actually fixes anything.

Finally, is `flintqs-gcc-4.3-fix.patch` still in use?    It apparently was *not* actually applied before?  At least that's what the diff seems to indicate.  That patch was added over 4 years ago, and I'm not even sure whether we allow people to build with gcc-4.3...  In fact, 

```
$ hg log -p spkg-install | less 
```
indicates that maybe the patch was *never* applied.  ???  Or maybe the fix was simply applied in source (against regulations)?

Anyway, what do you think about that patch?  Obviously it still applies, and maybe doesn't cause any trouble.

For positive review, should someone else try it on Solaris?  Also we would need just informational update on the Mac and extra patch as mentioned above.

I just built GCC-4.7.1 (see #13150) on `mark` (Solaris SPARC) and then built this FLINTQS spkg with GCC-4.7.1 and it worked.  This was starting from sage-5.1.beta0.
