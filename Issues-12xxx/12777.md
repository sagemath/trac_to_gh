<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
when recompiling Sage with this patch, I got a warning that variables f and n were referenced before assignment. Maybe it happened before this patch.

Some comments on the patch itself:

"The Elliptic Curve Method for Integer Factorization (GMP-ECM)": please replace GMP-ECM by ECM, since GMP-ECM is only **one implementation** of the ECM algorithm.

"Try to find a factor of a number": it would be better to say "integer", or even "positive integer".

"number to be factored": replace by "integer to be factored"

About the example with the factor from 2<sup>167</sup>-1: the B1 bound 1e5 is not enough to ensure
the factor 2349023 will always be found. By Hasse theorem, the group order can be as large
as 2352089, and since GMP-ECM only guarantees a torsion of 12, B1=196003 is needed to ensure
the factor 2349023 is always found, whatever the curve (unfortunately, the current interface
does not allow to specify the chosen curve).

"The following number is a Mersenne prime, so we will not find any factors": this is not
entirely true, it might be that we find the input number itself if we are lucky.

For the example with the two prime factors of 2<sup>179</sup>-1, in fact B1=1e4 ensures we will find always both of them, as any value B1 >= 113. I suggest using B1=10 instead.

`ecmfactor(N/11, 100, verbose=True)`: please replace `N/11` by `N//11`.

Depends what you mean.  If the `ecm_factor()` algorithm would be run to the end, then yes.  But it's possible the algorithm stops after step 1 when only one factor is found.  So you don't always get 359 * 1433 as factor.

<a id='comment:13'>**Comment 13:**</a>
about comment [comment:11]: I only considered Step 1 in my analysis,
since B1 controls Step 1 only. Thus B1=113 is enough to find **both** 359
and 1433 in Step 1.

But in some rare cases it can happen that some factor is found during the
initial computation **before** Step 1 is started. In such a case indeed only
359 or 1433 can be returned. Experimentally this seems to happen in only 1%
of the cases.

you are right, but it might be that a future version of GMP-ECM changes the default B2
value for B1=1e5.
