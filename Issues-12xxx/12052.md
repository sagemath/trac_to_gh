Keywords: word, language, symbolic dynamics

This ticket is a prerequisite to further development in the combinatorics of words and symbolic dynamical systems (adic language, SFT, ...). It concerns the implementation of a class "Language" (= graded set of words) as a Parent and a class "Word" as Element.

Three categories are created: Languages, FactorialLanguages and Shifts that gather several methods of finite and infinite words. For speed reason there are base Cython classes for
* finite word (in sage.combinat.words.finite_word)
* infinite word (in sage.combinat.words.infinite_word)
* language (in sage.combinat.languages.language) 

Every implementation must inherit from the class above (it is check in the TestSuite of the related categories).

The previous code of Word is dispatched between the ElementMethods of the category and the Cython class FiniteWord. The choice has been made for sake of optimization.

- #12225 : finite and lazy languages
- #12227 : adic languages

    "body": "I started the review. Here is a first bunch of comments.\n\n1. **Goal of the ticket: Categories in `sage/combinat/words` library.** The goal of this patch reimplements the code structure of `sage/combinat/words` using categories. It also adds classes for languages which is a good thing that I would need for my own research. It touches other files outside of this folder. It also depends on some particular tickets fixing bugs in Cython (#13957) and other patches that apply on similar files which do not commute with this huge patch. Moreover since it is a huge patch touching many files, it prevents any user/developper to change any code in `sage/combinat/words` without creating conflicts. So I hope this will not take forever to get reviewed because meanwhile it prevents the evolution of the actual code.\n\n2. **Content of the patch.** It is a huge patch (1.3MG). It modifies 40 files, add 27 files and removes 6 files (see detailed list below). It is hard for any reviewer to make sure he doesn't miss a problem possibly added by the patch.

I started the review. Here is a first bunch of comments.

1. **Goal of the ticket: Categories in `sage/combinat/words` library.** The goal of this patch reimplements the code structure of `sage/combinat/words` using categories. It also adds classes for languages which is a good thing that I would need for my own research. It touches other files outside of this folder. It also depends on some particular tickets fixing bugs in Cython (#13957) and other patches that apply on similar files which do not commute with this huge patch. Moreover since it is a huge patch touching many files, it prevents any user/developper to change any code in `sage/combinat/words` without creating conflicts. So I hope this will not take forever to get reviewed because meanwhile it prevents the evolution of the actual code.

2. **Content of the patch.** It is a huge patch (1.3MG). It modifies 40 files, add 27 files and removes 6 files (see detailed list below). It is hard for any reviewer to make sure he doesn't miss a problem possibly added by the patch. Is there a way to cut the patch in different chunks (tickets) which could make it more easy to get it into Sage because easier for reviewers?

For what reason each of these tests are failing? If it is because of a string repr that changed, this should be reverted and postpone in another ticket. If it is some hidden method starting with an underscore that was change : ok. If some result of `type(something)` changed because the class name has changed : ok. But if it is a normal method, it should still work after the ticket.
