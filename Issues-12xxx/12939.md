This simple change solves the problem.  But before it can be positively reviewed the docstring needs changing.  It should explain that substitution of a singleton tuple or list is allowed for compatibility with substitution in polynomials with more than one variable (the fact that this currently works for tuples is not documented), and doctests for each need case including.
