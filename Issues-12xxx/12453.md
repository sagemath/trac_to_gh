Why that ? Because :

* Integer Vectors have no element class
* Integer Vectors elements must be immutable and hashable
* Clean the old code with new specification
* Add documentation
* Deal with coeherence beetween extra arguments of the constructor
* ...

<a id='comment:13'></a>Before this branch

```
sage: %time _=list(IntegerVectors(5,22))
CPU times: user 1.78 s, sys: 8 ms, total: 1.78 s
Wall time: 1.81 s
```

After the branch

```
sage: %time _=list(IntegerVectors(5,22))
CPU times: user 19.3 s, sys: 60 ms, total: 19.4 s
Wall time: 19.6 s
```

With a 5-lines code

```
from itertools import combinations
def integervectors(n,k):
    L = n+k-1
    for x in combinations(range(L),k-1):
        l = [x[i] - x[i-1]-1 for i in range(1,k-1)]
        l.insert(0,x[0])
        l.append(L-x[-1]-1)
        yield l

sage: %time _=list(integervectors(5,22))
CPU times: user 492 ms, sys: 16 ms, total: 508 ms
Wall time: 515 ms
```

I think this can be classified as a severe regression. Besides,  it is probably better to avoid this kind of stuff present in your branch:

```
for c in IntegerVectors(self.size - k, i-1):
    c = list(c)
```

If you only want the data, don't generate complex objects in the first place.

<a id='comment:21'></a>> By your convention, I mean revlex.


Me and quite a lot of people (wikipedia, dictionaries, phone books, Python) seem to agree on what a lexicographic ordering is `:-P`

It looks like `IntegerVector` returns them in decreasing lexicographic order, so I guess that's what you call "revlex" (sorry I always mix colex and revlex).

What about computing the complement of x ? In Python  it wastes a lot of time, but the algorithm works.... `:-P`

```
def integervectors(n,k):
    L = n+k-1
    for x in combinations(range(L),L-(k-1)):
        x_complement = []
        j = 0
        for i in range(L):
            if x[j] == i:
                if j < L-(k-1)-1:
		    j += 1
		continue
            else:
                x_complement.append(i)
	x = x_complement
        l = [x[i] - x[i-1]-1 for i in range(1,k-1)]
        l.insert(0,x[0])
        l.append(L-x[-1]-1)
        yield l

sage: list(integervectors(5,5)) == [list(map(int,x)) for x in IntegerVectors(5,5)]
True
```

No, sorry. Your branch contains 14 commits, almost all of which are entitled "Merge with develop".
