Before this branch

```
sage: %time _=list(IntegerVectors(5,22))
CPU times: user 1.78 s, sys: 8 ms, total: 1.78 s
Wall time: 1.81 s
```

After the branch

```
sage: %time _=list(IntegerVectors(5,22))
CPU times: user 19.3 s, sys: 60 ms, total: 19.4 s
Wall time: 19.6 s
```

With a 5-lines code

```
from itertools import combinations
def integervectors(n,k):
    L = n+k-1
    for x in combinations(range(L),k-1):
        l = [x[i] - x[i-1]-1 for i in range(1,k-1)]
        l.insert(0,x[0])
        l.append(L-x[-1]-1)
        yield l

sage: %time _=list(integervectors(5,22))
CPU times: user 492 ms, sys: 16 ms, total: 508 ms
Wall time: 515 ms
```

I think this can be classified as a severe regression. Besides,  it is probably better to avoid this kind of stuff present in your branch:

```
for c in IntegerVectors(self.size - k, i-1):
    c = list(c)
```

If you only want the data, don't generate complex objects in the first place.

Me and quite a lot of people (wikipedia, dictionaries, phone books, Python) seem to agree on what a lexicographic ordering is `:-P`

It looks like `IntegerVector` returns them in decreasing lexicographic order, so I guess that's what you call "revlex" (sorry I always mix colex and revlex).

What about computing the complement of x ? In Python  it wastes a lot of time, but the algorithm works.... `:-P`

```
def integervectors(n,k):
    L = n+k-1
    for x in combinations(range(L),L-(k-1)):
        x_complement = []
        j = 0
        for i in range(L):
            if x[j] == i:
                if j < L-(k-1)-1:
		    j += 1
		continue
            else:
                x_complement.append(i)
	x = x_complement
        l = [x[i] - x[i-1]-1 for i in range(1,k-1)]
        l.insert(0,x[0])
        l.append(L-x[-1]-1)
        yield l

sage: list(integervectors(5,5)) == [list(map(int,x)) for x in IntegerVectors(5,5)]
True
```

I thought I had a method but it didn't work. Python's `itertool` forces it through lex ordering, so I just did a brute compute and reverse (which is far less than ideal). I'll look into your revised algorithm tonight.

Hello !

> I've implemented your algorithm and everything seems to work. Can you do the rest of the review for this?

No, sorry. Your branch contains 14 commits, almost all of which are entitled "Merge with develop". Besides, I see some code in your branch in which you just change the indentation, and so it seems that I should not re-review all that code, but given how your branch is made I have no way to know what needs an actual review.

Besides, I can spend time on the review of any "local" thing (like this enumeration algorithm) and I will do it gladly if you have anything specific in mind, but I hate parents, elements and almost anything that is immutable. I am the last person you want to review code like that.

I would start to make unpleasant reviews like: "It has been reported on Sage-devel that having a cached function return a UniqueRepresentation object resulted in a memory leak. Clearly those integer vectors will be used by cached function, so you are creating a new memory leak until this finally gets fixed".

So I'm sorry but you probably want somebody else to review this ticket.

typo "yeilds Python"

I am not sure I am able to do a review. This is rather large a ticket..

Would you please provide some timings ? I am still a lot worried about that.

And explain again what is gained, maybe at the loss of some speed ?

after

```

<a id='comment:62'>Comment 62:</a>
That is around what I am getting as well. The advantage is that this is now a proper parent class with elements and fits into the rest of Sage. If you want to have the speed but not the parent/element overhead, I provided an iterator for that:

```
sage: %timeit list(IntegerVectors(5,22))
1 loop, best of 3: 238 ms per loop
sage: from sage.combinat.integer_vector import integer_vectors_nk_fast_iter
sage: %timeit list(integer_vectors_nk_fast_iter(5,22))
10 loops, best of 3: 63.7 ms per loop
```
Old:

```
sage: %timeit list(IntegerVectors(5,22))
10 loops, best of 3: 76.4 ms per loop
```

Although if you use `int` and Cython, you can get a *very* fast iterator. Although converting those back to `Integer`'s was actually slower than working directly with `Integer`'s.

I now see the problem with why that was taking so long. The class I'm using actually stores the input data as `int`'s, not `Integer`'s. So I think I need to change the base class for the elements.
