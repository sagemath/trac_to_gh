Given a vector space V and a polyhedron P, the dimension of P is the dimension of its affine hull, i.e. the smallest affine subspace of V in which P can live. (For a reference, see G.M. Ziegler's book "Lectures on Polytopes" p.5)

Right now, the dimension of a Polyhedron is defined as:

```
    def dim(self):
        """
        Return the dimension of the polyhedron.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: simplex = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0]])
            sage: simplex.dim()
            3
            sage: simplex.ambient_dim()
            4
       """
        return self.ambient_dim() - self.n_equations()
```

But this is obviously not the truthful definition. With the way things are now, this leads to various problems such as:

```
sage: P1=Polyhedron(vertices=[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])
sage: P2=Polyhedron(vertices=[[2,0,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,2]])
sage: Inter=P1.intersection(P2)
sage: Inter
The empty polyhedron in QQ^3.
sage: Inter.dim()
1
```

While the right answer should be -1.

One can produce many other examples...
