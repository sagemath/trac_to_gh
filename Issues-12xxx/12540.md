1. Dense backend doesn't support edge labels, but add_edge(1, 2, 3) passes and behaves like add_edge(1, 2, None). (#12387)
2. ~~Adding a loop to a graph with allows_loops=False do nothing.~~
3. Adding an already present edge to a graph with allows_multiedges=False do nothing.
4. (Other?)

Is this the proper behavior?

No answer here, so I ask explicitly again about (2).

In `SparseGraphBackend`, for example, the following lines appear in the `add_edge` method:

```python
        if (not self.loops(None)) and u_int == v_int:
            return
```

This means that if the backend does not allow loops, the `add_edge` method silently ignore the added edge.  By default, `SparseGraphBackend` does not allow loops.

Is this a wanted behaviour?

If not, there are couple of ways to handle this:

1. raise from inside the backend method
2. warn (somehow) from inside the backend method
3. let the backend return `False` (or whatever) in case the edge was not added, and let the graph itself notice it and raise/warn
