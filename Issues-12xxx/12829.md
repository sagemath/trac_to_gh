The following is very wrong code (from `sage/rings/real_mpfi.pyx`)

```
# todo: The <object> coerce is evidently to get around a weird bug in SageX (?)   
mpfi_interv_q(self.value, <object>rat.value, <object>rat1.value) 
```

Surprisingly, it only breaks on PPC64.  See #11705 for more context.

Keywords: **ppc64 big endian mpfi**
