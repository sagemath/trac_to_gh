sage: (1/(t^2 + 6*t + 9)).factor()
t + 3^-2
```

Attachment: **[trac_12317_factorization_printing_fix.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12317/trac_12317_factorization_printing_fix.patch.gz)**

The defect (which applies only to a single negative power of a "prime") is very simple to fix, after which
