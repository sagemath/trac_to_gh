```

Should that be added to the others?  Likely.

I agree about `_lines`.  It's not used anywhere.

```

sage: search_src('\._lines')
databases/stein_watkins.py:202:        sage: l = sage.databases.stein_watkins._lines("\n some \ntext")

This has been in Sage practically from the beginning, though.  cc:ing William, but I suppose we can leave it in for now.

<a id='comment:4'></a>In testing this, I spotted that the instructions at the head of the file for installing the mini Stein-Watkins database are wrong: instead of

```
sage -i stein-watkins-ecdb-mini
```
it should be

```
sage -i database_stein_watkins_mini.p0
```
(at least, I tried various permutations and that's the only one I could find that worked). 

More seriously, the download link for the full database, [http://modular.ucsd.edu/sagedb/](http://modular.ucsd.edu/sagedb/), seems to be dead; and one of the new doctests *fails* if only the mini Stein-Watkins database, not the full one, is installed.

I suggest we seek clarification of this on sage-devel before going any further with this ticket.

I answered this on sage-nt:

```
The problem is the name of the package is missing a version number: it
should be something like
database_stein_watkins_mini-VERSION.p0.spkg

(where VERSION should be a date like 20120314 if there is no real
version number)
```

I think that for now this solution is appropriate, given that the instructions are clear (or will be, once I submit a reviewer patch for the underscores).

It will take me a while to download the actual database to make sure that tests do pass then :)
