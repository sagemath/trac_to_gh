In general, this looks good.  However, I have a suspicion that it may not actually work.  Note that all the original doctests at the top have

```
# optional - stein_watkins_database
```
Should that be added to the others?  Likely.

I agree about `_lines`.  It's not used anywhere.

```

sage: search_src('\._lines')
databases/stein_watkins.py:202:        sage: l = sage.databases.stein_watkins._lines("\n some \ntext")
geometry/cone.py:392:        cone._lines = lines
geometry/cone.py:2765:            self._lines = lines
geometry/cone.py:2766:        return self._lines
geometry/polyhedra.py:3054:            return self._lines
geometry/polyhedra.py:3056:            self._lines = [list(x) for x in self.line_generator()]
geometry/polyhedra.py:3057:            return self._lines   
interfaces/qepcad.py:2183:        self._lines = lines
```
This has been in Sage practically from the beginning, though.  cc:ing William, but I suppose we can leave it in for now.

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
In testing this, I spotted that the instructions at the head of the file for installing the mini Stein-Watkins database are wrong: instead of

```
sage -i stein-watkins-ecdb-mini
```
it should be

```
sage -i database_stein_watkins_mini.p0
```
(at least, I tried various permutations and that's the only one I could find that worked). 

More seriously, the download link for the full database, [http://modular.ucsd.edu/sagedb/](http://modular.ucsd.edu/sagedb/), seems to be dead; and one of the new doctests *fails* if only the mini Stein-Watkins database, not the full one, is installed.

I suggest we seek clarification of this on sage-devel before going any further with this ticket.

Here's a patch which updates the web links, and adds a short explanation of what the `ecdb_num_curves` function actually does. We should probably sit on this one until the trivial issue with "sage -i" not automatically downloading the right version of the mini spkg is fixed, since we might then have to change the instructions here. (I guess reporting this on sage-nt counts as "upstream"?)

Replying to [@loefflerd](#comment%3A5):
> We should probably sit on this one until the trivial issue with "sage -i" not automatically downloading the right version of the mini spkg is fixed

I answered this on sage-nt:

```
The problem is the name of the package is missing a version number: it
should be something like
database_stein_watkins_mini-VERSION.p0.spkg

(where VERSION should be a date like 20120314 if there is no real
version number)
```

same without the p0.  However, checking the list of optional packages shows that

```

However, that is not enough to pass the tests.  It's not clear to me if there is a bug that none of the tests seems to work with it, or not.

> Who is able to change the offending file name?

I think that for now this solution is appropriate, given that the instructions are clear (or will be, once I submit a reviewer patch for the underscores).

It will take me a while to download the actual database to make sure that tests do pass then :)

Right, but the point is that the mini package doesn't allow all tests to pass, only the "big" one, which is called stein-watkins-ecdb.spkg.  I didn't want to go against the flow and use ecdb when no previous tests did.  The tests without the optional do pass under normal conditions (without either spkg installed), so I don't know that needs to be fixed.

I didn't read this as the sage -i command needing a fix - the thread referenced makes it clear that the "right" fix is to rename that spkg database_stein_watkins_mini-1.p0 or something.

Anyway, this isn't that important to me, so I am not really motivated to do any other fixing on it.  It's probably not worth the effort, honestly.

I didn't say you needed to rename the package, but at least in the documentation give a "sage -i" command which works:

```
sage -i http://modular.math.washington.edu/sagedb/stein-watkins-ecdb.spkg
```
and

```
sage -i database_stein_watkins_mini.p0
```
(you might have unintentionally changed that last command)

I don't think it's particularly important to fix this ticket, but I always find it a pity to leave tickets "almost ready" when they are fairly trivial to fix.

Yup, you are totally right, glad I asked for review!  I'll fix that too.

Agreed; what I meant was that it wasn't important to bikeshed here.

I know why I missed that erroneous change - because I had already changed that line to put underscores in, so I wasn't surprised to see the diff at that spot.  Thanks a lot for catching that.

All is well now?  I did check that the "big" command works and change a little verbiage appropriately.
