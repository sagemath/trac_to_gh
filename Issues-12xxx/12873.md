If an interrupt occurs during a 387 FPU computation or during an MMX computation (which also uses the FPU registers), then some of the FPU registers will be occupied.  This may lead to failures with subsequent FPU compuations, see for example #12777.  Some operating systems (e.g. Linux and OS X 10.6) restore the FPU state when an interrupt occurs, but on Solaris this is not the case.

The proposed solution is to clear the FPU "tag word" (using the `EMMS` or `FFREE` instructions) in the signal handler.

To see the problem in action, compile [attachment:emms.c] on i686 hardware with

```
gcc -march=pentium2 -m32 -mfpmath=387 -lm emms.c -o emms
```

**Apply** [attachment:12873_emms.patch]

**Obsoleted** by #13076 and fixed in a better way.

Well, actually it's not so clear whether `longjmp()` should restore the FPU state.  I'll try to see whether I can reproduce the problem on Linux i686.
