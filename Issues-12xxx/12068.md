The code for numerator is currently

```python
def numerator(self):
        """
        Returns the numerator of this symbolic expression.  If the
[...]
        """
        return self.parent()(self._maxima_().num())
```
Using Pynac should be much faster.

The patch wraps numer, denom, numer_denom and normal from GiNaC and fixes a
bunch of wrong sphinx markup in `expression.pyx`.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

Ginac's behavior is not the same has Maxima: given `1 + 1/(x + 1)`

- Maxima returns `1 + 1/(x + 1)` as numerator and `1` as denominator;

- Ginac returns `x + 2` as numerator and `x + 1` as denominator.

I think both are useful. My patch keeps the current behavior. Is this what we want ?

Hi Burcin,

The uploaded patch should fix everything.  [attachment: trac_12068-numer_denom_fix-fh.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12068/trac_12068-numer_denom_fix-fh.patch.gz)

<div id="comment:12" align="right">Comment 12</div>

The changes to the previous patch seem fine, docs are good, tests pass.  In fact, it's a very nice patch.  

The only problem I spied is in the last hunk:

```
         - ``self`` -- the symbolic expression converting from 
         - ``target`` -- (default None) the symbolic expression
```
is too far indented.  If you're going to fix all of this stuff, you might as well make these at the same indentation level as INPUT, such as in the second-to-last hunk.

In fact, I'm attaching a reviewer patch to fix this.

I wonder if there is a more 'obvious' name for `normalize` that could be an alias... anyway, not for this ticket.  Assuming that Burcin has no objections, positive review other than this.

Hi Karl-Dieter,

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A12):
> The changes to the previous patch seem fine, docs are good, tests pass.  In fact, it's a very nice patch.  

Thanks !

> The only problem I spied is in the last hunk:


  ```
           - ``self`` -- the symbolic expression converting from 
           - ``target`` -- (default None) the symbolic expression
  ```
> is too far indented.  If you're going to fix all of this stuff, you might as well make these at the same indentation level as INPUT, such as in the second-to-last hunk.

> In fact, I'm attaching a reviewer patch to fix this.

Should't someone review your trivial reviewer patch before putting positive review ? Anyway, It is an obvious patch and I did review it. So I confirm your positive review.

In every CAS I used, I've always been confused by simplify, normal, combine... I guess Sage isn't an exception.

Naturally, anyone could decide that \"reviewer patch X needs review\" if they felt it was nontrivial.",

No, reviewers are usually allowed to make VERY trivial changes, esp. to fix doc, without 'formal' other review, otherwise we would take even longer to review things than normal.  Naturally, anyone could decide that "reviewer patch X needs review" if they felt it was nontrivial.
