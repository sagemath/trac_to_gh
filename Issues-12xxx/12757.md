The problem was that the posets appeared by default with a dark blue color on vertices which was not very pretty and made it difficult to read because the text was still in black.

Actually, the problem was coming from a little bug on Graph plot :

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_vertex(1)
sage: G.plot()
sage: G.plot(vertex_colors=None)

```
Giving "vertex_colors=None" didn't give the same result as not sending any vertex_colors. In the first case, the default behaviour of the graph plot (which gives some king of pale beige to the vertices) was not followed and for some reason the ugly blue appeared.Â 

To fix it, I had to make a small change to the graph_plot.py in the way arguments were tested. It seems that all argument are tested the same way but I don't know if it is causing any trouble for other arguments so I only changed the "vertex_colors" test. 

I didn't add any tests because I don't know how to test that the plot of a graph is done with blue or with some other color...
