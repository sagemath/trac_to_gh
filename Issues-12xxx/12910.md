}
```
When I create a graph with a list of edges, the empty list is not accepted as input:

```
Graph([])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: list index out of range
```
The same input doesn't work for `DiGraph`, either.

Empty dictionaries work in both cases.

Waiting for the results of the doctest...

I think in line 364 of `digraph.py` #12910 should be mentioned, too; the same in `graph.py`.

I hope I'm not to picky (since I think it is not really relevant for anything running), but in the output of the patchbot you can find

`Ticket number not in first line of comments: trac12910.patch`

According to the Developer Guide it should be

`Trac 1234: whatever`

So, can you change that. From my side, then, it is a positive review.
