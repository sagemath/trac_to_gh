The `gdmodule` spkg should not use `/sw/include` as include path, as some Fink stuff there can interfere badly with Sage.  Analogously, we shouldn't use `/usr/local/include`.

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/gdmodule-0.56.p8.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/gdmodule-0.56.p8.spkg)
([diff](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12909/gdmodule-0.56.p7-p8.diff))

### gdmodule-0.56.p8 (Robert Bradshaw, Jeroen Demeyer, 6 May 2012)
* Trac #12909: Setup.py: don't use non-system prefixes
  /sw and /usr/local to look for include files or libraries.
* Use standard template for spkg-install, use patch for patching.
* Restore upstream sources.  The pre-existing changes to src/Setup.py
  have been moved to Setup.py.patch
* _gdmodule.c: Undo change of #include <gd.h> to #include "gd.h"
