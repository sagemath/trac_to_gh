The goal of this ticket is to reimplement elements of Zp and Qp using the ideas from sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_template.pxi.  This should make p-adics in Sage both easier to maintain and easier to add new classes.

The final patch should not affect the external interface to Zp and Qp.

Now includes capped absolute and fixed modulus elements.  There are a few problems remaining:

* `teichmuller_list` is disabled since it had a bug and I didn't want to fix it at the time.  I'll track this down later.
* Some coercions aren't working since the element class has changed.

This version should be enough for Justin to compare the performance of the templated and non-templated versions.  I'm now going to create another patch on top of this which removes the untemplated versions.

Sorry for the long delay: I've been mostly working on research rather than Sage this summer.

I was unable to reproduce the documentation problem that you observed by running `sage -docbuild reference html`.  Is there something I should do instead, or somewhere with a more complete log of the problem?  I'm not quite sure what needs to be fixed.

I did go through and change most of the dollar signs in the p-adics directory to backticks, and updated these patches against Sage 5.10.

I've pushed a hopefully correctly rebased branch to:
* u/jpflori/12555

The problem is with commit fcf7972 "adapt miscellaneous files in the Sage library" which deals with Pari stuff.
Note sure from which trac ticket this is: <hint hint> put trac ticket number into git commit messages...
I'll fix it later today (currently my touchpad does not click, I cannot reboot, and tabbing all over the place is not so nice).

> <hint hint> put trac ticket number into git commit messages...

If you have to ask people, that's not going to work. When I started as release manager, I asked that and people forgot, were lazy, put the wrong number... or worse: got angry because I was complaining over such trivial things like ticket numbers in commit messages.

I learned that the only feasible solution is to have a system which automatically added the ticket number to the commit message. With git that cannot be done (that would be rewriting history), but at least automating the mapping commit -> ticket number could be done some other way.

    Trac #15185: Clean up interface to the PARI library
    
    The file `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx` is too big and contains too many
    different things.  For clarity and maintainability, it should be split
    into two parts:
    - `gen.pyx` containing the class `gen`;
    - `pari_instance.pyx` containing the class `PariInstance` and some
    utility functions;
    More cleaning-up will be done in #15461.

That example (and testing the files) now works for me, so it's back to positive review.

EDIT - also I don't think `.pxi` files are run as part of doctesting?

There are a number of other power series bugs that have been waiting in one way or another for rewriting of padics.  Could someone here take a look and comment on the appropriate tickets?  They do not seem to be resolved by this one.

#9457: Buggy equality of power series -- The fix seems straightforward, but causes a bizarre doctest failure in `sha_tate.py`

#4656: Power series over p-adics treat inexact zeros inconsistently -- The fix here causes the same doctest to fail.

#8198:  p-adic precision is dropped when matrix acts on vector -- Possibly a root cause of the previous two bugs.

#5075: Polynomials over inexact rings truncate inexact leading zeroes -- This was somehow fixed for polynomials over p-adics, but polynomials over other power series still have the issue.  David Roe commented that it may be fixed as part of a larger patch (I hope there's not another one after this!)
