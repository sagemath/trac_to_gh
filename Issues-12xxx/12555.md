The goal of this ticket is to reimplement elements of Zp and Qp using the ideas from sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_template.pxi.  This should make p-adics in Sage both easier to maintain and easier to add new classes.

The final patch should not affect the external interface to Zp and Qp.

* `teichmuller_list` is disabled since it had a bug and I didn't want to fix it at the time.  I'll track this down later.

This version should be enough for Justin to compare the performance of the templated and non-templated versions.  I'm now going to create another patch on top of this which removes the untemplated versions.

Sorry for the long delay: I've been mostly working on research rather than Sage this summer.

I was unable to reproduce the documentation problem that you observed by running `sage -docbuild reference html`.  Is there something I should do instead, or somewhere with a more complete log of the problem?  I'm not quite sure what needs to be fixed.

I did go through and change most of the dollar signs in the p-adics directory to backticks, and updated these patches against Sage 5.10.

> <hint hint> put trac ticket number into git commit messages...

If you have to ask people, that's not going to work. When I started as release manager, I asked that and people forgot, were lazy, put the wrong number... or worse: got angry because I was complaining over such trivial things like ticket numbers in commit messages.

I learned that the only feasible solution is to have a system which automatically added the ticket number to the commit message. With git that cannot be done (that would be rewriting history), but at least automating the mapping commit -> ticket number could be done some other way.

    Trac #15185: Clean up interface to the PARI library
    
    The file `sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx` is too big and contains too many
    different things.  For clarity and maintainability, it should be split
    into two parts:
    - `gen.pyx` containing the class `gen`;
    - `pari_instance.pyx` containing the class `PariInstance` and some
    utility functions;
    More cleaning-up will be done in #15461.

<a id='comment:86'></a>There are a number of other power series bugs that have been waiting in one way or another for rewriting of padics.  Could someone here take a look and comment on the appropriate tickets?  They do not seem to be resolved by this one.

#9457: Buggy equality of power series -- The fix seems straightforward, but causes a bizarre doctest failure in `sha_tate.py`

#4656: Power series over p-adics treat inexact zeros inconsistently -- The fix here causes the same doctest to fail.

#8198:  p-adic precision is dropped when matrix acts on vector -- Possibly a root cause of the previous two bugs.

#5075: Polynomials over inexact rings truncate inexact leading zeroes -- This was somehow fixed for polynomials over p-adics, but polynomials over other power series still have the issue.  David Roe commented that it may be fixed as part of a larger patch (I hope there's not another one after this!)
