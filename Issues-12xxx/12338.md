These tests should all be marked `# optional - frobby`, but none of them are:

```
sage: search_src('frobby')
misc/citation.pyx:26:systems['Frobby'] = ['sage.interfaces.frobby']
interfaces/frobby.py:18:    The official source for Frobby is \url{http://www.broune.com/frobby},
interfaces/frobby.py:42:                sage: frobby("analyze", input="vars x,y,z;[x^2,x*y];", #optional
interfaces/frobby.py:46:            We get an exception if frobby reports an error.
interfaces/frobby.py:47:                sage: frobby("do_dishes") #optional
interfaces/frobby.py:56:        command = ['frobby'] + action.split()
interfaces/frobby.py:96:                sage: decom = frobby.irreducible_decomposition(id) #optional
interfaces/frobby.py:109:                ...       decom0 = frobby.irreducible_decomposition(id0) #optional
interfaces/frobby.py:119:                ...       decom1 = frobby.irreducible_decomposition(id1) #optional
interfaces/frobby.py:124:        frobby_input = self._ideal_to_string(monomial_ideal)
interfaces/frobby.py:125:        frobby_output = self('irrdecom', input=frobby_input)
interfaces/frobby.py:126:        return self._parse_ideals(frobby_output, monomial_ideal.ring())
interfaces/frobby.py:146:            sage: parsed_ideals = frobby._parse_ideals(string, ring) #optional
interfaces/frobby.py:172:                sage: parsed_matrix = frobby._parse_4ti2_matrix(string) #optional
interfaces/frobby.py:179:                sage: frobby._parse_4ti2_matrix(string) #optional
interfaces/frobby.py:219:            sage: frobby._ideal_to_string(id) == "2 3\n2 0 0\n1 1 1\n" #optional
interfaces/frobby.py:249:            sage: frobby._monomial_to_string(monomial) == '2 0 1\n' #optional
interfaces/frobby.py:266:frobby = Frobby()
interfaces/all.py:3:from frobby import frobby
```
Once done, one should be able to test them with

```
 sage -t -only_optional=frobby frobby.py
```

Fixed by #14841.
