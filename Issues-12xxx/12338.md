These tests should all be marked `# optional - frobby`, but none of them are:

```
sage: search_src('frobby')

interfaces/frobby.py:46:            We get an exception if frobby reports an error.
interfaces/frobby.py:47:                sage: frobby("do_dishes") #optional

interfaces/frobby.py:125:        frobby_output = self('irrdecom', input=frobby_input)
interfaces/frobby.py:126:        return self._parse_ideals(frobby_output, monomial_ideal.ring())
interfaces/frobby.py:146:            sage: parsed_ideals = frobby._parse_ideals(string, ring) #optional
interfaces/frobby.py:172:                sage: parsed_matrix = frobby._parse_4ti2_matrix(string) #optional

interfaces/frobby.py:266:frobby = Frobby()
interfaces/all.py:3:from frobby import frobby
```
Once done, one should be able to test them with

```
 sage -t -only_optional=frobby frobby.py
```

Fixed by #14841.

However, not all tests actually always pass with the new package at #13007 - see the comment there.  I'm not saying we should revert the review there, since it actually builds more places now, but at any rate probably we should fix more than just the frobby tests being marked this way - fixing them with the doctests themselves broken is pointless.  So it's no longer "very easy", sadly.
