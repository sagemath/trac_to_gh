Various enhancements to Coxeter groups and Weyl groups.

1. Computes inversions for Coxeter and Weyl groups. They occur in three forms: reflections, roots, and coroots. 

New Coxeter group element methods:

categories/coxeter_groups.py

apply_conjugation_by_simple_reflection 

inversions_as_reflections 

left_inversions_as_reflections

New Weyl group element methods: 

categories/weyl_groups.py

reflection_to_root 

reflection_to_coroot 

inversions 


New root space element method: 

combinat/root_system/root_space.py

associated_reflection



Bruhat covering relations have an associated inversion. Accordingly,
we have added versions of the Coxeter group element methods bruhat_lower_covers and bruhat_upper_covers which incorporate the inversion data:

New Coxeter group element methods:

categories/coxeter_groups.py

bruhat_lower_covers_reflections

bruhat_upper_covers_reflections


New Weyl group element methods:

categories/weyl_groups.py

bruhat_lower_covers_coroots

bruhat_upper_covers_coroots


2. Installs the Demazure or 0-Hecke product for Coxeter groups

New Coxeter group parent method:

categories/coxeter_groups.py


demazure_product

New Coxeter group element methods:

categories/coxeter_groups.py

apply_demazure_product

min_demazure_product_greater


3. Computes canonical lifts from quotients by parabolic subgroups.
This requires Deodhar's recovery of the Bruhat order on a Coxeter group from that on a parabolic subgroup and the quotient by that subgroup.

New Coxeter group element methods:

categories/coxeter_groups.py

deodhar_factor_element

deodhar_lift_up

deodhar_lift_down


4. Small changes for root systems

sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realizations.py:

new parent method:

positive_roots_by_height

modified the calling convention for weyl_action

sage/combinat/root_system/root_space.py:

new element method:

max_coroot_le

Hi Mark,

I also went through categories/weyl_groups and made some minor changes. The only interesting is: I merged reflection_to_coroot into reflection_to_root and added an optional argument.

I hope to finish my review tonight...

btw: the patch needs to be rebased for sage-5.3.beta0 once we finish it.

Best, Christian

Hi,

concerning the modifications in RootLatticeRealizations:

- why don't we move this file into categories? (this might be answered somewhere else but I don't remember right now)

- shouldn't we implement the various methods for roots (roots, positive_roots, negative_roots, -_parabolic, -_nonparabolic, ...) right away as well for general Coxeter groups? It looks like we are not very far from that anyway (I actually do some rudimentary implementation in my other patch on Coxeter groups, but this part would perfectly fit here)

What are cocovers? should the new methods be named instead bruhat_upper_covers_* / bruhat_lower_covers_* for consistency with posets?

Cheers,
                                 Nicolas

Regarding Comment 6, first question: I don't know. (Nicolas, can you answer this?)
However I tried to put certain things involving root systems into
categories and had my first encounter with import loops.
Comment 6 second question: Since I don't know how much work it would take (and since my methods
use root data, which is more information than the Cartan data needed for a Coxeter group) 
my vote is to finalize this patch without the extension to Coxeter groups.

Regarding Comment 12: Cocovers are what you are calling "lower covers" and covers are what you are calling
"upper covers". I can change the names if you insist.

I didn't change anything yet. 
The only additional changes I was planning to make (but have not yet made)
were the method renamings that Nicolas suggested.

You should not use "assert" for bad user input, only to check for actual bugs. Bad input should probably give a `ValueError` instead. The correct use for `assert` is to check for conditions which you *know* are true if the program wouldn't have bugs.

If there is any way at all to reproduce an `AssertionError` using documented public functions, that is by definition a bug.
