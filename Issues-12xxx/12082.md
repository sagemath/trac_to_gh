In script, I also remove the symlinks "sage.bin", "sage_pari" and "sage_singular" since these are nowhere used.  Also I remove the script "sage-cleantmp" which is nowhere used and hasn't been edited since 2006.

After applying this patch, the release manager should run [attachment:fixdate.sh] once in the sage_scripts and extcode repositories to reset the modification times of the hg-tracked files.

Regarding the use of `cp -pr`, on OS X, the man page for cp (from "BSD General Commands Manual") says

```
COMPATIBILITY
     Historic versions of the cp utility had a -r option.  This implementation supports that
     option; however, its use is strongly discouraged, as it does not correctly copy special
     files, symbolic links, or fifo's.
```
It would be better to use `cp -pR`, I think.  (This also seems consistent with what I can find on the internet about POSIX standard options for cp.)
