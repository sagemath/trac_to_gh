This patch fixes a "problem" with empty graphs when fed to the new distances computation methods added in #12052.

The cases "n == 0" are avoided, and some flags are added so that the exceptions are indeed forwarded by the C methods. They were not, which is the reason why it was not found before `:-p`

The patch is OK but incomplete.
This is what is expected with your patch. 

```
sage: G.shortest_path_all_pairs()

This is a missing part of your patch.

OK, the patch is working correctly.

Concerning the radius / diameter / .... of the empty graph, this is a question of definitions: should it raise an error, or return 0, or +infty ???
I propose to let such question for future patchs according to others preferences.

Best,
D.
