This patch fixes a "problem" with empty graphs when fed to the new distances computation methods added in #12052.

The cases "n == 0" are avoided, and some flags are added so that the exceptions are indeed forwarded by the C methods. They were not, which is the reason why it was not found before `:-p`

Hi Nathann,

The patch is OK but incomplete.
This is what is expected with your patch. 

```
sage: G.shortest_path_all_pairs()
({}, {})
```

This is a missing part of your patch. 

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.distance_all_pairs()

OK, the patch is working correctly.

Concerning the radius / diameter / .... of the empty graph, this is a question of definitions: should it raise an error, or return 0, or +infty ???
I propose to let such question for future patchs according to others preferences.

Best,
D.

Hellooooooo !!!

Agreed ! As for whether we should return 0 or +infty, I think the best behaviour is to raise an exception meaning "We could have returned 0, or returned +oo, but what you need to know is that the code probably isn't doing what you expect" `:-)`

Thanks for the review !!!
