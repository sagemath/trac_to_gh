This patch fixes a "problem" with empty graphs when fed to the new distances computation methods added in #12052.

The cases "n == 0" are avoided, and some flags are added so that the exceptions are indeed forwarded by the C methods. They were not, which is the reason why it was not found before `:-p`

Hi Nathann,

The patch is OK but incomplete.
This is what is expected with your patch. 

```
sage: G.shortest_path_all_pairs()
({}, {})
```

This is a missing part of your patch. 

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.distance_all_pairs()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Helloooooo !!!

Well, actually this bug has a different source : the "average distance" in a graph is the sum of the distances between each pair of nodes, divided by the number of pairs, and of course the "number of pairs" is zero when the graph has less than 2 vertices. It also seemed like "radius" had no meaning on empty graphs so I changed it too, but the other ones I checked were ok `:-)`

Attachment: **[trac_12244.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12244/trac_12244.patch.gz)**

OK, the patch is working correctly.

Concerning the radius / diameter / .... of the empty graph, this is a question of definitions: should it raise an error, or return 0, or +infty ???
I propose to let such question for future patchs according to others preferences.

Best,
D.

Hellooooooo !!!

Agreed ! As for whether we should return 0 or +infty, I think the best behaviour is to raise an exception meaning "We could have returned 0, or returned +oo, but what you need to know is that the code probably isn't doing what you expect" `:-)`

Thanks for the review !!!
