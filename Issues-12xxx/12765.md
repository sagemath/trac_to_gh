This is likely a GCC bug, see [http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48496](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48496)

There is a work-around (by essentially disabling all optimization) spkg at #11616.

See #12751 for the GCC-4.7.0 metaticket.

The MPIR 2.4.0.**p2** spkg at #11616 now includes a work-around for this bug (*almost* completely disabling optimization on Linux ia64 with GCC 4.7.**x**).

Despite that, after a second try with `-fno-strict-aliasing -O3` (and again at least parts of these errors), the spkg is reported to have successfully been installed... ?

And that's *not* upstream.  From `spkg-install` (which is a mess):

```sh
...
CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -g -fPIC -O3 -L."; export CFLAGS
LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS"; export LDFLAGS
...

OMG.

Jeroen, should I open separate (GCC 4.7 on ia64) tickets for these, or perhaps just one meta-ticket?

FLINT and zn_poly are currently "under construction" anyway; Andrew Ohana slightly fixed these just to respect `CC` and `CXX` for the `clang` port, so we could also do (little) changes on those open tickets.

(For FLINT there's also the ARM port ticket, which upgrades to 1.5.2 and thereby makes a couple of changes unnecessary, or at least different, with less effort.  I also have an old, broadly cleaned-up FLINT 1.5.2 spkg, which I believe would need some work, at least some rebasing.)

[GMP-ECM, MPFR and PARI seem to build with `-O0 [-finline-functions -fschedule-insns]` in `C/CPP/CXXFLAGS`, without further changes to their `spkg-install` or Makefiles etc.; haven't yet tried with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` though.]

To be honest, I don't care too much about these issues...  It makes more sense to open a ticket to blacklist GCC-4.7.0 on ia64, i.e. build Sage's GCC-4.6.3 in this case.

I'm currently building an svn version of GCC-4.7.x to see whether the problem is fixed.

Forgot: A fixed zn_poly spkg (not yet taking care of GCC 4.7.0 on ia64 IIRC) is available at #12433, still needing review.  (The main purpose of that ticket was to make zn_poly respect `CC` etc.; it now also does a major clean-up.)
