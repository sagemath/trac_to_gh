This ticket provides the following advanced interactive features to Jmol in the notebook:

1. Initial display is a static image created by Jmol (if a javaVM is available on the server) or Tachyon. This means all browsers and devices will at least be able to see a 3-D image.
2. The live applet can be loaded by clicking on a "Make Interactive..." button.
3. Colors can be changed without recalculating
4. spin on checkbox
5. high quality checkbox
6. Meshes can be displayed without recalculating (no sparkles either :))
7. Transparency can be adjusted without recalculating
8. Applet size can be adjusted
9. Applet can be displayed in its own window
10. Can download a file that the Jmol application can open to recreate the exact view shown on the web page.  This allows for more sophisticated manipulation and the semi-automatic creation of web pages that include this live 3-D image.
11. Solves memory problems associated with opening too many Jmols at once, by automatically putting Jmols that are not being used to sleep.

**Explicit Installation Instructions for <=sage-5.1:**

1. Install the flask notebook by following the instructions at #11080.
2. Then do the following to apply the patches and install an updated version of Jmol.

I've tried these patches on top 5.0.beta6 and #11080. I believe the patch to jmol_lib.js in [trac_12299_adv_jmol_nb.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12299/trac_12299_adv_jmol_nb.patch.gz) appears twice. If I delete the first occurrence everything applies and the png images generated by Tachyon appear in the notebook. If I click the "Make Interactive" button then the 3-D jmol images appear. I noticed that the first image to always appear, even if a cell is reevaluated, is the png generated image. "Make Interactive" must be clicked to get the jmol image. If a jmol image is present in a cell, reevaluating that cell will display a png image. "Make Interactive" must be clicked again to recover the jmol image. If after clicking "Download this view" from the "Advanced Controls" and saving the jmol image there then appears in the lower right corner of the applet a "Jmol_S" the wasn't present initially. When clicked this gives a jmol menu. I believe this is part of jmol. I've seen it on sage-on-gentoo where jmol-12.0.45 is used. I'm not sure why it suddenly appears after the indicated action.

I have manually deleted the extra patch to jmol_lib.js and uploaded a correct version.  I've been having trouble patching on top of #11080 patches.  I believe I ran afoul of unfinished queues.  Anyway, I think this correction is the last fix related to that.  \n\nComments:\n\n1) The red \"Jmol_S\" logo in the bottom right corner indicates that the signed applet has been loaded and has access to the user's directory tree.  I believe I can turn it off, but think it is a bad idea.  I want to be reminded that I am using an applet that can send stuff from my disk to the server. The menu is the same as the right-click menu that is always available with Jmol.\n\n2) If we want to have an image as the default so that all devices will see something, users will have to deal with requesting it become interactive each time the cell is recalculated.  The notebook+sage presently insists on reloading Jmol each time a recalculation is done.  In order to do this properly we would need to have a separate div in the notebook for applets and not kill the applet unless it is not being used.  Then Jmol would not revert to the starting over state each time a recalculation is done.  I think that is another ticket for after these changes go in.\n\n3) Would reloading with a static image be less of an issue if the .png was the same quality as the Jmol image?  I'm working on generating static images using Jmol on the server if a Java Virtual Machine is installed on the server.  Many details like graceful fallback, probably to Tachyon,  are still being worked out.\n\nDoes this answer your questions or generate in suggestions for what needs work?",

You are correct about the error in the adv_jmol_nb.patch.  I have manually deleted the extra patch to jmol_lib.js and uploaded a correct version.  I've been having trouble patching on top of #11080 patches.  I believe I ran afoul of unfinished queues.  Anyway, I think this correction is the last fix related to that.  

Comments:

1) The red "Jmol_S" logo in the bottom right corner indicates that the signed applet has been loaded and has access to the user's directory tree.

The menu is the same as the right-click menu that is always available with Jmol.

The notebook+sage presently insists on reloading Jmol each time a recalculation is done.  In order to do this properly we would need to have a separate div in the notebook for applets and not kill the applet unless it is not being used.  Then Jmol would not revert to the starting over state each time a recalculation is done.  I think that is another ticket for after these changes go in.

3) Would reloading with a static image be less of an issue if the .png was the same quality as the Jmol image?  I'm working on generating static images using Jmol on the server if a Java Virtual Machine is installed on the server.  Many details like graceful fallback, probably to Tachyon,  are still being worked out.

Does this answer your questions or generate in suggestions for what needs work?

If you are running locally you should see the JmolData application launch to generate the static image.  So I think that answers my question about your test environment (local with a JVM available, right?).  What browser are you running and did you run the notebook in secure mode?  I assume you are getting the "Trying to launch JmolApplet#X..." dialogs?  This means your browser is not getting the applets from the server or is taking a very long time to load them.

Okay, I will still have to look at what happens if "old" Jmols live in a directory, but at least it does, in fact, work.  

I have to say that it is already, even after limited testing:
* Really cool to be able to do the mesh, color, spin, everything from that advanced screen immediately - I don't think three.js will do all that right away.  I remember this from testing last summer, too, but it's still nice it still works.  And the extra features of the right-click menu - setting x, y, z spin separately?  Nice.
* Really *annoying* that even the very first Jmol on a worksheet, even a new one I create on a new worksheet (!) has the clunky "make active" thing which takes ages.  We have to wait a while for 3D graphics anyway; let's not make it longer.  Is there *any* way to make at least the first Jmol detected be a real Jmol, or is that a pipe dream?

Other minor things noticed thus far: 
* If you resize the applet using the right-click menu (say, to 200%) then the advanced menu on the right does not resize with it, which can lead to things being not very visible.  Also makes it very hard to find the right-click menu.
* Thinking out loud... should even more things from the right-click menu be on the advanced menu?  That could be another ticket, but if it's really easy to do.  Especially showing the axes would be REALLY nice as an option, since the axes Sage provides are (as we discussed at #9238) just plain wrong.
* I think the right-click menu needs to be reorganized.  In particular, "View" to me implies I will get to pick things to view - like axes and boxes. Now that I see what it actually does, it's really cool, but maybe "Views" would be better for that, and "Show" for some of the other options in "Style".  That said, some of the things under "Style" do make sense.  
* In the right-click menu, why can't "Color" do the color of the plot itself?   I was ambivalent about "Color" being a top-level one, but if it can only color the subsidiary objects, that's probably not ideal to have at the top level.

But the basic functionality is fine as before, so hopefully we can get this in for Sage 5.2 along with the new notebook - let's keep our fingers crossed.  strogdon, if you're out there, this would be great to test.

Finally, I will put this as "needs work" for two reasons:
* First, because it looks like your stuff for the sagenb has not been [reported upstream](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/search?q=jmol) and made a pull request.  I know, you just learned Mercurial, and now they're making you use Git... I **truly** feel your pain, and am very annoyed about it.

* Second, although I mentioned it obliquely in [comment:14](#comment%3A14), I think I was too subtle - [attachment: trac_12299_adv_jmol_nb.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12299/trac_12299_adv_jmol_nb.patch.gz) is also still "double-committed".

These are the steps you can follow:
1. If you don't have a fork of the [sagemath/sagenb](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb) github, then go to this page and click on "fork" on the top right. This will create a fork of this git repository inside your account.
2. In your own machine, clone your fork using

```
git clone git://github.com/<your username>/sagenb sagenb-github
```
In particular, you can follow [the directions here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-notebook/J9OHFqY2ufQ/gPijLnwyaOcJ) if you don't have a git repo.
3. Next, make the changes to the files you want (for instance you may apply your patch manually) and then commit your changes using

```
git add <filenames> # In case you have introduced new files
git commit -a -m "commit message"
```
4. Then push your changes to your own github repo using

```
git push -u origin
```
5. Finally go to your github page and click on "Pull Request" on the top. This will create the pull request to sagemath/sagenb repository.

You can commit and push changes to the github page and the pull request will be updated automatically with your new changes. Because of this feature you can also decide to create a separate git branch and put a pull request only from that branch, so that other changes that you are working on don't get affected or included in the pull request.

If you are unclear about anything, just ask. I, kini, ohanar, are available on #sagemath too and will be glad to help. If you already know how to use git and github, then sorry for wasting your time. :)

I've finally installed the flask notebook and the patches from this ticket on top of Sage-5.0. At one point things were changing too quickly for me to keep up but the situation now seems to be fairly stable. I have the following observations:

1. The png images I see when a worksheet is first loaded are of much higher quality than what I observed with previous versions. This is nice.
2. Occasionally, when an applet is made Interactive and the controls are toggled to "Download this view", if the download is cancelled then the Advanced controls disappear. The cell has to be re-evaluated to recover the controls. This usually happens after a first "Make Interactive" request for any one applet. Subsequent requests to Download do not seem to cause the Advanced controls to disappear.
3. When a download is requested I get two requests to save when I cancel saving the jmol file.
4. Is anyone able to get the grid to appear on the small red sphere for

```
x, y = var('x y');W = plot3d(sin(pi*((x)^2+(y)^2))/2,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1), color='purple', opacity=0.8);S = sphere((0,0,0),size=0.3, color='red', aspect_ratio=[1,1,1]);show(W + S, figsize=4)
```
If no objections, I'll set myself as a reviewer also (provided I can figure out how to do that) since I've spent some time understanding and implementing items from the ticket.

I believe the sphere is a sphere object, which is not a surface defined by a bunch of vertices and triangles, thus there is no mesh to display.  If Sage were to calculate it as a pmesh surface rather than use the Jmol builtin, then there would be a mesh.

You were right, it was the Jmol placeholder.  I really find that annoying.

> * Nothing else worked - lots of messages about restarting Jmol and so forth. At one point I even got a JmolData java applet starting outside the browser window.
> Too late now to see what I did wrong, but wanted to let you know all was not flawless :( sorry.

I had the same problems on the same worksheet.  This worksheet had only five Jmols, but took a million years to load (well, over a minute) and then I get the following.

```
Jmol Applet #0 is having trouble loading.  Will retry once.

Second attempt to finish launch of Jmol Applet #0 failed.  Recommend reevaluating the cell manually.
```
Same for all Jmols.  Some didn't even make the static images.  Even re-evaluating doesn't help at all - it does create the image, but as soon as I make it "live" I get the same horrible messages.

Note that in the new worksheet, I am just fine, and the little Jmol logo shows up properly in the upper left corner - not ever in this old worksheet, or only with the briefest of appearances.  Notice that in old **interacts** everything works fine, presumably because these are indeed newly generated!

---

Question about implementation.  How much work does Jmol have to do to generate all those static images **every** time that one opens a worksheet?  In theory, once there is an image (png, I guess) generated, it should just stay in the cell's folder and be displayed; we certainly don't want to create a new one each time, any more than we do this for 2D plots.  Though even with a largish sheet it doesn't seem to take super long, a little delay.

Have you tried using this on "old" worksheets with Jmols?  This seems to be the problem I have, consistently; any Jmols from the old notebook (by which old Jmol is presumably meant) don't work.

---


More minor issues.
* When I sleep an image, it doesn't come back with the advanced controls if I had them up.  Is there any way to "save" that state, or is it too hard?
* Although it's pretty clear by the content, it's a little hard to see which tab you are on in the advanced controls sometimes.  Maybe the shading could be slightly different.
* In interacts, I think there is no point to having the initial static image.  I have no idea if there is a way to detect this, but presumably one wouldn't have asked for this to be evaluated if one wasn't going to use it.
* The opening of the "JmolData" app each time is a little annoying.
* When doing 

```
implicit_plot3d(x^2+y^2+z^2==16,(x,-5,5),(y,-5,5),(z,-5,5),color='green',plot_points=200)
```
   I got

```
viewer handling error condition: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```
   Maybe I'm being overoptimistic; the docs don't even have any with 100 `plot_points`.
* On the plus side, the thing where only four Jmols are active at a time is working fine.  I notice that it deactivates the one furthest down or something, not the oldest one.

---

I have to say that I'm by far the most concerned about the "old worksheets" issue.  Second is the "automatically every image is static" - couldn't at least the *first* one be "live"? - but nearly everything else could be considered an enhancement request.  Let me know what stuff I've mentioned is worth discussing here.

Update: at least sometimes re-evaluating seems to remove the problem.  But it isn't consistent, needs more testing.

We potentially could get rid of this with significant browser detection and a complete reworking of how Jmol is called for when a cell is recalculated.  The problem is related to the fact that the applet is completely reloaded each time a cell is recalculated, rather than just passing it new data.  This means it is very easy to get out of sync with what the server is sending to the applet.  Many of the problems with the old Jmol relate to this.

As your comments below suggest this appears to be a problem with old worksheets that have not been reevaluated.  We might be able to put something into the notebook code that puts up a message suggesting the worksheet be re-evaluated if it does not have the data necessary for static images.  I tried to put a message in the "alt" field for the images, but most browser now seem to ignore that.  I think I can put a check into the cell code that would deal with this.

Jmol only generates the image when a cell is evaluated.  When you open a worksheet that was previously evaluated using these enhancements the images are already there.

Actually it picks the one farthest from the cell you most recently evaluated that includes a Jmol.  It can be above or below the cell you are working on.

I agree that this should be a priority.  I think there are solutions.  What behavior would be best: 1) A pop-up suggestion to reevaluate old worksheets to update 3-D plots; 2) Attempt to update plots without reevaluation; 3) Automatically reevaluate worksheets with 3-D plots in them?

Right, and I assume that passing it new info would be a pretty sizable change in how we use it.

> I would prefer to put this off as an additional enhancement.

Now that I understand the technical issue better, I guess I would agree in some sense, but I figure it's buyer beware on the `@`interact cells.  Having to do an extra click every time would get really old really fast with them.  Maybe we could ask on sage-devel about the tradeoff, though perhaps (as usual with polls on sage-devel) we wouldn't get many takers...

We definitely need to fix this.  Again, I even had trouble with some worksheets even after re-evaluation.

It should be pretty easy for you to test this.  Just open an old Sage, make a new worksheet with Jmols, close it, stop Sage, restart your new Jmol Sage, and see what happens.   I figure you have more diagnostic tools than I will.

> Jmol only generates the image when a cell is evaluated.  When you open a worksheet that was previously evaluated using these enhancements the images are already there.

Great.

> The application can certainly handle more.  I'll see if I can change the memory allocation to allow for larger images...That is a little odd as we use Jmol in web pages to look at things with many more points, atoms and surfaces...

No, it's 100 points *per axis*, so one million points are evaluated and the presumably however many of them are on the sphere must be plotted.  I think that's why we don't even have it in the docs, because it would take a long time.  But it does seem to work in the old Jmol in Sage (just tried it in vanilla 5.0).

Definitely not 3.  1 also seems less than desirable unless it was only when there had been a Jmol before, and one could reliably detect it was from an earlier version of Jmol.  How would 2 work?

The major issue I am worried about is reliability of the applets when an unsigned applet is used in a secure environment.  Browsers and Java are getting much more finicky about mixed modes.  I've seen some cases where the applet will not launch under https if it is not signed.  I need to know whether this is enough of a problem to spend some time on.

Is the test server you link to with `secure=True` or `False`?  I guess since it's http, not https, it's `False`?

> Is the test server you link to with `secure=True` or `False`?  I guess since it's http, not https, it's `False`?

Correct.  Let's get other issues dealt with before the signed issue.

Here's an interesting thing I wasn't expecting.

```
More than 9 Jmols have been launched on the worksheet since it was last openned. Unable to get a static image from Jmol#0 You might want to try Chrome as this problem does not exist with Chrome on MacOS.
```
And indeed, a few have a little message to that effect, and no static image.  Looks like something added on the previous ticket, though I'm using Safari, not FF, on Mac.

So one could sort of jam up a worksheet.  I was able to get all the plots to vanish by playing a little game where I chased them around, and then got the advanced menu to try to generate a static image, which would (intentionally, I guess) fail.  What is the story behind this?  Can Jmol not detect that there are no longer any live images, and hence try again to generate a static one, or would this be hard to work around?

I do note that quitting and reopening the page gives normal behavior.  But just restarting inside the worksheet doesn't.

I tried to recreate strogdon's signed applet issue.  I couldn't get exactly that, but I did note that once the signed applet has been requested (not downloaded, as in his), there doesn't seem to be any way to go back to the unsigned applet - even reevaluating the cell doesn't do it.

I also tried to see if I could get away from the problems with old Jmols, but try as I might it wouldn't work.  Re-evaluating will sometimes generate a png for the next time one opens the page, but I can't get it to consistently "just work".  Now sometimes even new cells in this old worksheet give the same error message.  It's puzzling and frustrating.

I uploaded it to the test server first.  I tried to share it with you, but maybe you didn't have an account on it.  I'll email it as well.  It doesn't work right there, either.

By the way, I got

```
Jmol Applet #0 is having trouble loading.  Will retry once.
```
on the test server for a new worksheet, but then it eventually did come up fine and so forth.

Remind me why we aren't loading the "High Quality" view right away?  I'm sure there's a good reason, but it just looks so much nicer that I'm surprised we don't just use it by default.

Since this seems to be related to issues of IE8 handling jquery functions differently depending on where they are on the page, I don't think I can fix this easily.

Did you at least get the warning that things were not likely to work?  It should have read something like:
"Many of the advanced 3-D viewing functions DO NOT work in Internet Explorer..."
Or are things failing before then?

Update: gutow discovered this was due to a weird Geogebra applet embedding attempt left in that particular worksheet that for some reason was causing the trouble.

Also, based on the sage-devel discussion, sounds like people are ok with not having immediate interaction, and obviously Jonathan is worry about overlapping requests to Jmol.  I'm still not sure this is advisable, but be it on their heads.

I'd still ask for some reorganization of the menus but that is probably for another ticket, given the current state of the applet in 5.0 being much more difficult to follow than this new one, which only needs tweaking.

At least some people are reporting success on FF on Linux.  Apparently some Opera has trouble there.  But maybe Linux is okay, then, at least many of them.

What remains to look at:
* Someone to do at least brief testing on Windows 7.  I will eventually be able to do that, but I'm not sure when yet.
* The signed/unsigned issue.
* The secure/insecure notebook issue, if it needs more testing.
* *Someone* has to create an upstream pull thingie - the ticket is already open on github.  I think that it would be easiest for kini to do this :) but maybe we should wait until it otherwise has positive review.

I think this is resolved.  I cannot reproduce the hangs I sometimes saw.  There is no question that loading an unsigned applet causes the initial load to slow down, but after that there seems to be no trouble.

I was going to try, but see a problem.  This ticket requires changes to both the notebook and Sage.  The pull would just be for notebook, right?
> * Anything else?  This is looking good, it would be great to get it in 5.2 along with the new notebook.

I'm going to clear the two work issues and replace with "decide default display quality".  See this google thread

 You're right, it's failing before that.
* We do need the final doctests - can be very skimpy.  
* Jonathan, I'm wondering whether it's worth creating a new error class for this one specific error of not having the JVM.  I mean, your string is so informative, you could just raise a very generic error with that message.  Also, it would eliminate two needed doctests :)

This is looking really close to ready, though.

I've been able to reproduce the "signed/unsigned" applet issue under [comment:41](#comment%3A41) and [comment:42](#comment%3A42)  on ubuntu 12.04. I don't ususally use ubuntu but had access to an installation. The behavior was observed with FF and chromium. I know there are quite a number of Sage users that install from ubuntu. I was not able to get the "Download this view" to a jmol to work at all unless I manually installed oracle-java-jre. Ubuntu only provides the

```
File reader was not found:org.jmol.adapter.readers.molxyz.XyzReader

and there were similar complaints in the terminal window from which Sage was started. After this happens no applet can be made interactive.

Thanks.  I'll try again.  So far I haven't been able to reproduce this on MacOS or Linux. If I can reproduce it I'll have a chance of fixing it.

Another scenario that leads me to believe what I'm seeing is not a "signed/unsigned" applet issue:

1. load a worksheet with 5 applets
2. make the applets interactive buy starting from the top and working to the bottom of the      worksheet - the applets will be unsigned.
3. the first applet should now be sleeping, re-evaluate the second applet's cell (this applet should not be sleeping) and make the applet interactive. Here is where I get the problem. I get a pop-up and nothing more can be made interactive.

This can be reproduced if the applets are singed as well. Yet another approach that may shed some light provided someone can get it to behave as here:

1. load a worksheet with 5 applets
2. make the applets interactive, from top to bottom, in the order 1 - 5 - 2 - 4 - 3
3. the first applet should be sleeping but the second one should be interactive
4. re-evaluate the second applet's cell and make the applet interactive
5. Here I only get 3 interactive applets, regardless of how many are made interactive.

This is a linux install from a gentoo-prefix where the host OS is debian. The browser is FF.

I can reproduce this on Mac OS with Safari.

```
could not find applet jmolApplet1
```
After that once in a while I was able to get one to show up interactive, but most just have

```
Loading Jmol 3-D viewer...
```
where the applet would be, and then of course eventually, as it's Safari,

```
More than 9 Jmols have been launched on the worksheet since it was last openned. Unable to get a static image from Jmol#1 You might want to try Chrome as this problem does not exist with Chrome on MacOS.
```
which incidentally has a typo (extra "n").

The last command was just for me to check that the author/date/etc. looked correct, as well as the number of lines added/removed and number of files changed. There was a minor discrepancy in the larger patch, but it looks like it was just an instance of trailing whitespace being added which disappeared when git fixed the whitespace changes.

There are many places where the update could be getting messed up.  At least I know what to look for now.  And  you are correct, this should have nothing to do with whether the applets are signed or not.

I think I've fixed it.  I found quite a few places I missed where the server could get out of sync with the browser.  Please try my test server [TestServer](http://gutow.no-ip.org:8080) before I make a patch.  Thanks.

Surprisingly, it doesn't!  I think acting oddly is different from acting badly :)

I've been messing with the "high quality" issue.  So, it does look enough better that it's hard not to want it, especially since memory should not be an issue at this point.  I do see the speckles with the mesh on.  However, they only appear with the mesh, and only with the *black* mesh - I can't get it with any other mesh, not even the darker grays.

Maybe we could keep the high-quality if the mesh defaults to one of those colors?  Or is there an "xor" we could set, not allowed to use high quality and mesh at the same time if the color is so and so?  That seems to be a little limiting, though.

The black mesh speckles have their value too - we could hypnotize people at the Joint Meetings booths...

Yup, this happens to everybody!  Great, though - I would have been surprised had this been different.

> Decided to keep JmolData specific error as may need it for movie generation.

Sorry, still 'needs work'.  *Every* method needs doctesting.  In particular, the JmolDataError needs a docstring and test in its `__init__` and `__str__` methods.  I'm really sorry this is so annoying.  For the init, just print `self.value` or something; you can also put `# indirect doctest` as a comment after the test (not the result) for the ones that don't use the actual name of the method.

Also, you'll need to change things like

```
EXAMPLES:: 
Create a JmolData object 
:: 
    sage: from sage.interfaces.jmoldata import JmolData 
```
should look like

```
EXAMPLES:

Create a JmolData object:: 

    sage: from sage.interfaces.jmoldata import JmolData 
```
Note the single colon except directly before the doctest, and the blank line before the actual test.

Will increasing the Jmol memory cause problems?   I don't have time to do any more Jmol testing right now, how much more memory are we talking, where does it live?

No biggy. I hope to have time to get to it tomorrow.  Have a research student in all day working on building a high-powered node (8 cores) for our quantum mechanics cluster.
> Will increasing the Jmol memory cause problems?   I don't have time to do any more Jmol testing right now, how much more memory are we talking, where does it live?

This just brings the memory used by the image generating application up to what is used by the applet in the browser (512 MB of heap--much can be virtual).  Anyway, the image generating application should now be able to handle data sets at least as big as the applet.  It should have no effect on the in browser memory issues.

Okay, I've created a reviewer patch.  Now I know the formatting is right because I added this to the reference manual and looked.

I also made some linebreaks earlier, made one set of tests optional because they require the internet (I've checked this), and made the file temporary that wasn't before.

So in theory, this should be wonderful.  Only now I've horribly broken something, because these files in the `os.path.exists` tests no longer exist and those tests fail!  I have precisely zero explanation; every time I made them live in the current directory, like just `DNA.png`, it worked, every time I put them someplace else it didn't.

What's particularly odd about this is that the other test which imports `SAGE_TMP` used to pass, and then started failing.  For no discernible reason.  So I'm wondering if I just destroyed something else on my computer (how, I don't know - I've just been working on this patch).

So 'needs review' still.  I really am stumped, as this should be completely done now, but isn't.

On the plus side, it looks like people like the functionality!

For me, one `os.path.exists` test fails: line 164 in jmoldata.py. When I run it by hand, the file is not created. I edited jmoldata.py, removing `stdout=jout` in the `subprocess.call` line, and I see this when I try to run it by hand:

```
sage: JData.export_image(targetfile =testfile,datafile = script, image_type="PNG")
Error occurred during initialization of VM
Incompatible minimum and maximum heap sizes specified
```
Does that help to track down the problem?

Your problem is in line 163.  I ran into this when I was writing the test code.  You have too many layers of escaping on the endofline.  This is why I used the form:

```
sage: script = 'set defaultdirectory "'+archive_name+'"\n script SCRIPT\n' 
```
rather than the

```
sage: script = 'set defaultdirectory "%s"\\n script SCRIPT\\n'%archive_name
```
you used. Alternatively, your code works if you change it to:

```
sage: script = 'set defaultdirectory "%s"\n script SCRIPT\n'%archive_name
```

Thanks for reporting this.  I cannot reproduce this error once I fix the double backslash issue in the tests.  However, it suggests I should to be more careful about how I specify the memory allocation for the JVM.  I will set a maximum, rather than a minimum.

Incidentally, John's patch looks good, especially since sometimes `DOT_SAGE` is indeed set differently.

Jonathan, what would you say still needs review?    The user interface piece certainly seems to be in good shape, based on strogdon, ppurka, and my testing.

I guess once this is ready we'd need an updated pull request; kini has graciously offered to do this, I think.

Duh.  You wouldn't believe how many variants of `r` in the actual set default directory script I tried; that the issue was the entire docstring somehow didn't occur to me. Thank you very much.

There is still

```
Image file , .png, .gif or .jpg (default .png) 
```
but removing the space or the comma or anything now *really* seems too trivial to deal with.

Sorry, kini, I didn't realize that the only remaining updates were on the sage library end.

Well, I don't know how much is really left to review here.  gutow, let us know what you think might not have been looked at carefully enough.

I like the Sage library patch.  We've certainly tested all of it a fair amount as well.

I don't have access to a computer without JVM, I guess, so maybe someone should make sure the error message really appears in the notebook and is friendly?

The tests now behave properly again.

Line [2416](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/64/files#L2R2416) could use an `os.path.join`, I guess, but that's probably not crucial.

I can't possibly review all the changes in jmol_lib.js but it certainly mostly conforms to the changes that are advertised, and I believe strogdon and I have tested a fair number of those capabilities.  Is someone willing to read through the changes in that file line by line to look for errors?

I honestly don't know that we're going to find a lot more without the kind of testing one gets from active deployment.  So far it seems like it's performing admirably.  Other comments?

I just updated my Java on Mac and other than having to close the browser window when Safari asked me to enable the Java plugin or something, no problems.

Following instructions on #11080 and then here leads to success on a Sage that didn't have it before.  I accidentally already had jmoldata.py in there so I had to do a little stuff to cover that up, but that didn't make a difference.  Certainly John making the all-in-one patch helped a lot.  Important - the other dependencies are already in #11080!

I'm putting this to sage-pending until we know which sagenb version this will go in.  Hopefully one included in Sage 5.2, but perhaps not - up to Keshav and Jeroen.

 1) Install the flask notebook by following the instructions in #11080. I recommend installing the optional OpenSSL package.  I have not been getting consistent behavior using the system install on all my different machines (probably a path issue).

There is an open ticket about keywords to plot3d not being passed to show in general, and is unrelated to this afaik.

I'm aware of this, but have not looked into it yet.  There is a ticket.  It isn't just "mesh", there are number of things that don't get passed.

I'll poke around a little but this version of Java began phase out in 2006 and was deprecated in 2008.  Most of Jmol does work under that version, but I'm not sure headless operations can be made to work.  Is this going to be a holdup?

I won't have significant bandwidth until Thursday, so the spkg with the typo fix in SPKG.txt will not be put up until then.

I have access to this very, very old redhat machine for which:

```
[strogdon@bwulf sage-5.2.beta0]$ java -version
java version "1.4.2"

```
and when I run the testsuite the only failing test is

```
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/jmoldata.py"
The java class could not be loaded. java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: (org/openscience/jmol/app/JmolData) bad major version at offset=6

So perhaps the Gtk-WARNING is unrelated to java version.

Edited the description to not finalize queues because it's a pain to remove commits from a Sage install if you decide you want to test some other ticket after this one.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
So I think you've answered my question.  The failures occurred on arando (no java, failure expected) and rosmary (Java 1.4.2), so I need to test for java >=1.5.  Testing for this will require changes to the Jmol spkg.  Could we make that another ticket?  I don't think it will take me very long, but I don't want to hold things up or have to start the review process for this ticket again.

sage: from twisted.python.procutils import which

I think that the first line of testjava.sh should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `#!/bin/bash`. 

If we want to do it in Python instead, then rather than messing around with `twisted.python.procutils.which` (we shouldn't use twisted for this), we could do:

```python
import re, subprocess

try:
    version = subprocess.check_output(['java', '-version'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
    return re.search("version.*[1]\.[567]", version)
except (subprocess.CalledProcessError, OSError):
    return False

I tried to do the checking all in python originally.  It was not working reliably.  I still think it should be possible.  However, I believe that effort (even if minor) should be a new ticket, as we are at the point where we may hold up inclusion of what already works in favor of improvements which do not change the actual functionality.

I agree. We should only test for versions that we know will work. I also think we should keep the shell script for now; if we think re-doing it in Python is really important, we can do that later.

What needs to be reviewed to get this in? This ticket is holding up a big group of important tickets and I really want to get it merged.

John Palmieri told me that the testjava.sh shell script is one of the holdups, and it's not working properly for me on a machine with no Java installed.

The doctest uses `subprocess.call`, which returns the return code of the executed program. But `testjava.sh` isn't exiting with useful return codes. Should the script look like this?

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

```
#!/bin/bash

#found java now check 1.5<=version<=1.7

Although scripts default to retuning the output value of the last command run, we could put in explicit exit # lines if we want.

The `#!/usr/bin/env bash` syntax is [recommended for portability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)#Portability).

As for the bash script, are you looking at the output of the bash script or only at the return status. In the former case, you probably want to echo back only the $OUT. In this case, the script can be shortened significantly

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

There's a doctest in sage/interfaces/jmoldata.py (line 90) that looks like this:

```
result = subprocess.call([testjavapath],stdout=jout)
```
[The documentation for subprocess.call](http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call) says it returns the returncode attribute, but the current script AFAICT always returns 0. I think we should be using `check_output` if we want the output.  We can do either thing, but it seems like right now the script and the doctest are not consistent.

That's certainly an option, but perhaps the verbose-but-obvious script would be easier to maintain, in case someone who's not much of a bash expert needs to change it. :)

OK guys.  Either:

1) approve what is available now and works, even if it is not exactly the way you would like to see it done, and start a new ticket to get things done all inside python.

2) insist that things must be done all inside python.  If that is the case, I cannot tell you how long it will take to get things working.  Assuming things work as they are supposed to it will take at least until Monday or Tuesday for me to have enough time to properly test everything before putting up patches.  If I re-encounter the kinds of problems I had with the subprocess routines before it might take even longer.

Then my version will *always* have a return code of 0. This is why I asked the question. So we have the following choices:

1. For python based solution: the python method in [comment:173](#comment%3A173) looks good.

2. For bash based solution: the simple bash version in the case you use `subprocess.call` is below. This will have the proper **return code** of 0 or 1, depending on whether java is present and is version `1.[5-7]` or otherwise.

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
type -atp java  && java -version 2>&1 | grep version.*[1]\.[567]
exit $?
```

3. A slightly more verbose bash version (again assuming you are using `subprocess.call`)

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
type -atp java || exit 1  # exit if java is not found
java -version 2>&1 | grep version.*[1]\.[567]
exit $?
```

4. Even more verbose bash script (assuming usage of `subprocess.call`) - the one in [comment:166](#comment%3A166)

The bash script currently shipped in the spkg does not return the correct exit codes.

Yes it does.  It does not send them to the standard output, but it does return the correct values to the $? variable that `subprocess.call` gets the result value from.  Otherwise we would never get the error message on machines that don't have java or the correct version and we do.

```
 >./testjava.sh
>echo $?
0
```

On a machine with a different java or no java you will see

```
>./testjava.sh
>echo $?
1
```
 
If you don't have a machine without java you can check it by changing the grep statement to

```
grep version.*[1]\.[2]
```

Then run the script again.  You will find an exit code of 1.

I verified this on Ubuntu and MacOS.

Well, the behavior I am getting on Linux is different (and what I expected). Let me first ensure that we are talking about the same script - `jmol-12.3.27.p1/patches/testjava.sh` (removing redundant lines):

```
#!/bin/bash
type -atp java
OUT=$?
if [ $OUT -eq 0 ]; then
  java -version 2>&1|grep version.*[1]\.[567]
fi
```

The problem is that if the `type` statement exits with a nonzero status, then `OUT` will be nonzero. The `if` statement will not execute and hence it will never reach the grep statement so as to give a nonzero return status. This can be checked by changing the line `type -atp java` with `type -atp not_present_command`. I get the following behavior

```
...z/jmol-12.3.27.p1/patches» bash -x ./testjava.sh
+ type -atp not_present_command
+ OUT=1
+ '[' 1 -eq 0 ']'
...z/jmol-12.3.27.p1/patches» echo $?
0

# With the original script and java present
...z/jmol-12.3.27.p1/patches» bash -x ./testjava.sh
+ type -atp java
/usr/bin/java
+ OUT=0
+ '[' 0 -eq 0 ']'
+ java -version
+ grep 'version.*[1].[567]'
java version "1.6.0_33"
...z/jmol-12.3.27.p1/patches» echo $?
0
```

So I've fixed:
1. make java dependent doctests optional
2. testjava.sh now properly checks for java and its version
