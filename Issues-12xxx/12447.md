Keywords: COPYING.txt license

The file `COPYING.txt` in the top-level directory looks out-of-date to me: it is missing entries for a number of our spkgs (e.g. blas, boehm-gc, and boost-cropped, just for the first few in alphabetical order), and it has entries for some things we haven't distributed in years (like clisp and gnuplotpy). For the spkgs which still belong on the list, I also don't know how accurate the information is.

I'm attaching a small patch for the developer's guide about this, but the file COPYING.txt needs a lot of work.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12447

```

So COPYING.txt should reflect this as well. Currently it says that everything in Sage is GPLv2+-compatible, which is wrong.

Here is an incomplete patch for COPYING.txt. I left a lot of "???" in the file, because I was too lazy to look at the spkg to figure out the licensing, or I looked and couldn't find it easily. I also didn't check all of the entries which are actually there; I got up to `gcc`, in the list at the beginning.

I am tempted to make this a blocker, since this file is very important from a legal point of view, isn't it?

Just arrived on this ticket by chance. Yes, it looks like something which should be fixed.

No, it's correct but misleading. If licences A and B are *compatible*, it means that it is possible to combine those software packages under *some licence*.

To put it mathematically: let `A` be a licence. Let `L(A)` be the set of possible licences under which code from licence `A` can be released (for example, if `A` is `GPLv2+`, then `L(A)` contains `GPLv2` and `GPLv3`). The statement "`A` and `B` are compatible" means that the intersection of `L(A)` and `L(B)` is not empty.

Sage as distribution is released under `GPLv3`, which is `GPLv2+`-compatible.
