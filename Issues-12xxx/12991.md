When we build the Sage documentation, we create lots of files which look like the following (`SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/algebras/free_algebra_quotient_element.rst`):

```
.. _sage.algebras.free_algebra_quotient_element:

Free algebra quotient elements
==============================

.. This file has been autogenerated.


.. automodule:: sage.algebras.free_algebra_quotient_element
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
```
When we run `make ptestlong`, these files get doctested. I don't think there is a good reason for this: we should skip these files when doctesting. There are two ways of doing this: patch the doctesting scripts to skip files containing `\n.. This file has been autogenerated.\n`, or write `.. nodoctest` as the first line of each of these files. The attached patch does the second of these (a patch to do the first is given in a comment below).
