Most objects have a parent. That is the set in which they belong:

```
sage: 1.parent()
Integer Ring
sage: Permutation([3,2,1]).parent()
Standard permutations
sage: (1.3).parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```
This is coded at very low level (namely `sage.structure.element`), and hence very fast. From the parent, you should be able to build new element of the same set.
