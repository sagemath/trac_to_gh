The default implementation of `__nonzero__` in element in far from optimal. Thanks #12510 we now can detect where `__nonzero__` is not properly implemented. To experiment I tried with `CDF` here are the timing:

With the default implementation:

```
p = CDF(pi)
sage: %timeit bool(p)
625 loops, best of 3: 731 ns per loop
sage: %timeit p.is_zero()
625 loops, best of 3: 965 ns per loop
```
with the following trivial specific implementation:

```
def __nonzero__(self):
    return bool(self._complex.dat[0]) or bool(self._complex.dat[1])
```
here is the new timing

```
sage: %timeit bool(p)
625 loops, best of 3: 342 ns per loop
sage: %timeit p.is_zero()
625 loops, best of 3: 869 ns per loop
```

This is a so common question that it would be worth removing the default implementation and implement all the specific methods. 

Depends on #12510
