```
sage: from sage.rings.factorint import factor_aurifeuillian as fa
sage: fa(2^6006 + 1)
[...]
```

This should produce a splitting, but instead it just returns a singleton.  The problem is that there's rounding error because of the fixed precision of 300 in aurifeuillian.

This patch also updates this factorization function to allow for a greater variety of bases.

Depends on #12116
