The docstring for `partitions_restricted` says that the function is deprecated and one should instead use `RestrictedPartitions`.  However, this also turns out to be deprecated.  It would be good to fix this.

And here is a more serious problem: the way that is now recommended for obtaining the list of restricted partitions is `Partitions(n, parts_in=S)`.  However, `Partitions` cannot have both `parts_in` and `length` specified, so not all the functionality of the old `partitions_restricted` remains available.

**Update:** Following this
[discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-combinat-devel/utAsQzZQKLo) on sage-combinat, it has been agreed that the functionality of RestrictedPartitions should be fully implemented in Partitions
by allowing the combination of different keyword argument. The problem with the current implementation is already highlighted in the documentation for Partitions():

```
Right now, the "parts_in", "starting", and "ending" keyword
arguments are mutually exclusive, both of each other and of other
keyword arguments. If you specify, say, "parts_in", all other
keyword arguments will be ignored; "starting" and "ending" work the
same way.
```
The code should allow keywords to Partitions() to be used in any way that makes sense. In particular, it is not currently possible to combine the arguments `parts_in` and `max_length`, for example. For this reason RestrictedPartition() has not been deprecated yet. Note, however, that `RestrictedPartitions` is essentially a wrapper to gap function call, which makes it quite slow. In contrast, the use of `parts_in` is quite quick.

Here is another related example which I think is incorrect:

```
sage: Partitions(4,min_slope=-2).list()
[[4], [3, 1], [2, 2], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
```
In sage (and in mathematics) 

```
sage: Partition([4]) == Partition([4,0])
True
```
so the partition `[4]` does not satisfy the constraint min_slope=-2.

In modular representation theory, a partition is said to be **e-restricted** if the difference of its successive parts is always strictly less than `e`, for an integer `e>1`. The partitions index the irreducible representations of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of the symmetric group at a primitive `e`th root of unity, or the symmetric group in characteristic `e` when `e` is prime. 

If `min_slope` worked the way that I expected it to then `Partitions(n, min_slope=1-e)` would construct the `e`-restricted partitions of n.

I don't understand the manual entry for `ending` which says

```
If "ending=p" is passed, then the combinatorial class of partitions
at most p in lexicographic order is returned.
```
but in any case the set that I want when `e=3` can currently be obtained using

```
sage: [mu for mu in Partitions(4, min_slope=-2) if mu[-1]<3]
[[3, 1], [2, 2], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]

Checking that the last part is strictly less than `e` is enough in general.

It is saying the last entries in the partition are `p` or using lex ordering reading right-to-left. In an bug-free world:

```
sage: Partitions(4, ending=[2,2]).list()
[[2,2]]
sage: Partitions(4, ending=[1,1]).list()
[[2,1,1], [1,1,1,1]]
```

With regards to the lex ordering, I personally think of it as reverse lex ordering (reading right-to-left), but Stanley in ECII calls reading left-to-right rev lex (thus right-to-left would be lex ordering).

For example, what I think of as lex ordering (reading left-to-right):

```
[4,1,1] > [3,2,1]
```
and rev lex (reading right to left):

```
[3,2,1] > [4,1,1]
```
which is opposite from Stanley.

Could someone with more experience state what the general convention is in partitions, or it this something we just need to state in the documentation (such as using 0-indexing)?
