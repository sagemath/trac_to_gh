```
The Cartesian product of directed graphs does not work. For example

```
sage: P=DiGraph([[0,1]])          
sage: Q=P.cartesian_product(P)
sage: len(Q.edges())         
0
```

The result is a disconnected union of 4 points.
This should be a commutative square, with 4 edges.

It was original examples. I removed them. They are not so useful.

Already done with is_isomorphic tests.

> * Maybe it would be good to have a test with loops ?

I added a test with loops: small De Bruijn product an arc. The resulting digraph contains 2 copies of the debruijn and arcs from vertices in one copy to corresponding vertex in other copy.

Should be better now.

Since the tests are displayed both in the documentation and in the `g.cartesian_product?` page, I don't see the need for a specific example section that will have similar stuff than the tests section.

> * I would like the following sentence raise TypeError ('Both arguments must be of the same class.')  to be more precise : 'The graphs should be both directed or both undirected.' 

Done in new version.

Done in patch #12791.

<a id='comment:10'>Comment 10:</a>
*According to Nicolas Thiery :*

Once the graph G is created, the whole end of this method would be
best rewritten as something like:

        G.add_vertices( (u,v) for u in self.vertex_iterator() for v in        other.vertex_iterator() )
        G.add_edges( ((u,v), (u1,v)) for (u,u1) in self .edge_iterator() for v in other.vertex_iterator() )
        G.add_edges( ((u,v), (u,v1)) for (v,v1) in other.edge_iterator() for u in self .vertex_iterator() )


I do not know if this is better, in any way, than what you wrote. Maybe faster ? 

If you do not want to spend more time on this ticket, I can give a positive review for the current patch.

Unfortunately your proposal is slower than the implementation of this patch.

With this patch:

```
sage: g = graphs.GridGraph([10,10]); g
Grid Graph for []: Graph on 100 vertices
sage: h = graphs.CubeGraph(8); h
8-Cube: Graph on 256 vertices
sage: %timeit gg = g.cartesian_product(h)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.31 s per loop
sage: %timeit gg = h.cartesian_product(g)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.31 s per loop
```

With your proposal on the same graphs:

```
sage: %timeit gg = g.cartesian_product(h)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.9 s per loop
sage: %timeit gg = h.cartesian_product(g)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.9 s per loop
```

So I propose to stay with current implementation.

Interesting that calling repeatedly add_edge is faster than add_edges!

I am fine with the current implementation, though maybe using edge_iterator would be faster, since the former does a sort (which I don't like but that's another story). I let you see if you want to do that.

The point is that using add_edges, we first create a new list of edges, and then iterate this list to add edges to the new graph. So somehow we do the job twice. My tests suggest that current implementation is a bit faster.

> I am fine with the current implementation, though maybe using edge_iterator would be faster, since the former does a sort (which I don't like but that's another story). I let you see if you want to do that.

I have changed the patch to use the edge_iterator. It is now slightly faster (few ms less on large graphs).

Actually the code did not create a list: just an iterator over those edges. But it might well be that using an iterator induces some overhead.

A good reason :-)

Thanks! Positive review.
