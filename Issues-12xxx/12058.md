The Mercurial spkg (#10594) created a file `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/mercurial/hgrc` enabling the "pager" extension.  This is very bad for scripts using Mercurial and should be disabled.

There are 6 occurences of `hg diff` in the `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/*` scripts, so I disagree.

Wrong, this was introduced in #10594.  It is the Mercurial spkg which writes `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/mercurial/hgrc`.  On #11121 I have made a comment that I did not want the pager extension to be enabled by default.

True, but I think that is an orthogonal issue.  Even if we do use `HGPLAIN` in scripts, I think we still should not enable the pager extension by default.

Do you propose to also revert #11142, which explicitly uses the pager extension?

Maybe you are right, but I do think that `hg diff` can be useful in scripts sometimes, and `hg log` also.

No, I think using the pager within Sage is fine, analogously to how "`is_prime?`" runs a pager.  In Sage, there is no simple way to explicitly run a pager (in the shell, it's easy to type "`hg diff |less`")

> Just to be clear, I think it was a bad idea, from an overall software design perspective, to entangle Mercurial with Sage, create wrappers for it in the Sage library, etc. in the first place. Maybe it was even a mistake to bundle Mercurial at all.

I don't think it's a bad idea to bundle Mercurial.  I actually like how the Sage scripts like `sage-sdist` use Mercurial.

> But one of the main goals behind the way Sage is set up is to lower the barrier of entry and make things easier for beginner developers, and I think part of that goal involves making `sage -hg` as user-friendly as possible.

Okay, agreed.

> But in that case most of #11121 doesn't make any sense anyway and most of `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/mercurial/hgrc` should be deleted (except the first two lines). What do you think? I am fine with that, if that's what people generally agree upon. In that case I would request that you start rejecting patches that are not in git format, though, as that was the original (and important) purpose of #11121. Luckily the patches on #11121 (i.e. not the commit in the spkg) mostly solve that problem.

Well, I think the "git" default is good to have, also the encoding being utf-8 (through `HGENCODING` set in `sage-env`).  I never argued about that, only about the pager.

If you call mercurial from within sage ('hg-sage' and friends) to diff then we pass `--config pager.pager=...` in `sage/misc/hg.py`. So whether or not the pager is enabled by default in the `hgrc` is just a matter of taste.

My vote would be:
* Use `HGPLAIN` in scripts if necessary.
* Keep the pager extension to intentionally break scripts that forget to set `HGPLAIN`.

Sounds great to me. Keep in mind that the pager extension will not break scripts that forget to set `$HGPLAIN` unless `$PAGER` is also set while the script is run, or `pager.pager` is set to something in some `hgrc` somewhere.
