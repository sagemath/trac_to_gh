Since some Sage tickets will require patches to sagenb, there should be a section in the Sage developers manual about how to contribute to the flask-sagenb project.  We really want every Sage developer to be able to contribute to sagenb.  It's okay if this requires some work (like installing `git`), but this should be documented well.

This is a preliminary patch, based on the gitwash project for generating documentation for github projects: https://github.com/matthew-brett/gitwash

Any general improvements to this documentation should be contributed back to the gitwash project.  Also, we should probably add the paragraph or two in the Development section in the sagenb README.rst about converting between hg and git repositories: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/blob/master/README.rst

Ideally, sagenb would be documented totally separately in its source tree, and that documentation would somehow be available to the users.

I'm trying to reproduce this, but everything works for me. I deleted the output for the developer's guide and ran make-doc-jsmath, and there were no complaints.

Is the error reproducible on eno?  That's on skynet?  I might be able to log in and try to reproduce it there.

It looks like most of the doc has moved, e.g. [the user manual](http://schacon.github.com/git/user-manual.html) and the [tutorial](http://schacon.github.com/git/gittutorial.html).  Since everything looks the same, just with the `http://shacon.github.com/git/` prefix, presumably that's all that has to be changed.  In fact, it looks like some kind of `sed` on the patch replacing `http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs` with `http://schacon.github.com/git` would suffice.

So for positive review one needs
* to fix the links (which wouldn't even need a separate export, it could just be done on the patch file)
* to check the MANIFEST.in patch solves the other problem, which I won't touch with a ten-foot pole.

Those actual words appear on github when you fork a repository, by the way.

Once the whole Sage tree switches to git (#13015), this autogenerated stuff will be even less adequate. At least now it seems that most sagenb contributors are fairly experienced at contributing to open source projects. That is not true of sage library contributors.

You mean the symlink `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb`? Of course not :)

Right, but who can do that?  I don't know who has admin rights to that other than William, who isn't really involved in this upgrade that much.

Answering my own question - presumably to open an issue on github and post code there?

Totally unprofessional.

Keshav, do you think you can take a stab at making a new patch with these changes?  Or ppurka if he is participating in the notebook days remotely.  I figure that this would be pretty compelling for a good use of time at a **notebook** days :) but let me know if not; probably over the next couple weeks I could do a very bad job at fixing a few of them.

Maybe you can bug someone about the nb.sagemath.org stuff this week too.  That would be really great.

Okay, he has graciously updated the page a lot.  If we change

```
.. _`Sage Notebook`: http://sagemath.org
```
to 

```
.. _`Sage Notebook`: http://nb.sagemath.org
```
in `this_project.inc` that will solve many of our problems.

> This is clearly not an ideal setup overall, but as long as we have a very clear first page saying that everything is generic, and giving all relevant links, it's better than not having documentation at all.  I don't know who would have time, interest, and expertise to do something more, though that would clearly be better.

I'm just going to change the things that need to be done myself.  We need to get this stuff in.  Patch hopefully coming up.
