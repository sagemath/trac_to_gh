Since some Sage tickets will require patches to sagenb, there should be a section in the Sage developers manual about how to contribute to the flask-sagenb project.  We really want every Sage developer to be able to contribute to sagenb.  It's okay if this requires some work (like installing `git`), but this should be documented well.

<a id='comment:3'></a>This is a preliminary patch, based on the gitwash project for generating documentation for github projects: https://github.com/matthew-brett/gitwash

Any general improvements to this documentation should be contributed back to the gitwash project.  Also, we should probably add the paragraph or two in the Development section in the sagenb README.rst about converting between hg and git repositories: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/blob/master/README.rst

Ideally, sagenb would be documented totally separately in its source tree, and that documentation would somehow be available to the users.

Yes, that is the reason why we are not doing that right now---something needs to be figured out to make that doc easily accessible.  This ticket just adds the docs to the sage developer's guide for now.

It's reproducible on **every** machine on the Buildbot.  But I just think of something: are you adding files which are not in `devel/sage/MANIFEST.in`?

It looks like most of the doc has moved, e.g. [the user manual](http://schacon.github.com/git/user-manual.html) and the [tutorial](http://schacon.github.com/git/gittutorial.html).  Since everything looks the same, just with the `http://shacon.github.com/git/` prefix, presumably that's all that has to be changed.

So for positive review one needs
* to fix the links (which wouldn't even need a separate export, it could just be done on the patch file)
* to check the MANIFEST.in patch solves the other problem, which I won't touch with a ten-foot pole.

The git documentation url hasn't changed in several months, so I updated the patch with the fixed documentation. The [attachment:sagenb-developer-doc-patch-diff.patch diff file] shows the changes to the *patch*.

Unfortunately, I don't have permission to overwrite the earlier patch. So, I uploaded a differently named one.

Those actual words appear on github when you fork a repository, by the way.

Once the whole Sage tree switches to git (#13015), this autogenerated stuff will be even less adequate. At least now it seems that most sagenb contributors are fairly experienced at contributing to open source projects. That is not true of sage library contributors.

Right, but who can do that?  I don't know who has admin rights to that other than William, who isn't really involved in this upgrade that much.

Answering my own question - presumably to open an issue on github and post code there?

Totally unprofessional.

Keshav, do you think you can take a stab at making a new patch with these changes?  Or ppurka if he is participating in the notebook days remotely.  I figure that this would be pretty compelling for a good use of time at a **notebook** days :) but let me know if not; probably over the next couple weeks I could do a very bad job at fixing a few of them.

Maybe you can bug someone about the nb.sagemath.org stuff this week too.  That would be really great.

Update: sounds like we can just ask Harald to do something.  I've done that.

We definitely *do* need some ideas on what the right place to send people is for developing.  The current page [here](http://nb.sagemath.org/dev.html) is not right at all, but I don't know whether pointing people to this documentation is best or not.  However, I don't see much on the github site that is accessible, and we don't want to point them to #11080 once the new notebook is in!

Okay, he has graciously updated the page a lot.  If we change

```
.. _`Sage Notebook`: http://sagemath.org
```
to 

```
.. _`Sage Notebook`: http://nb.sagemath.org
```
in `this_project.inc` that will solve many of our problems.
