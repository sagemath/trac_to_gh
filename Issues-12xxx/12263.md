Because of either a readline or a Python bug, sometimes control characters are output by Python.  For example, on my Gentoo Linux system:

```
jdemeyer@arcanis:~$ sage --python -c 'import readline' |cat -t
^[[?1034hjdemeyer@arcanis:~$
```

This breaks doctests at #12249 for `sage-run`.  The easiest solution is to unset the `TERM` environment variable when running `sage-run` or `sage-eval`.  This will effectively disable readline.

*"My Gentoo Linux system"* isn't very precise.

Note that (also Sage's) readline uses *some* termcap library, i.e. some "arbitrary" equivalent installed / found on a user's system, which apparently leads to improper output of control sequences (intended to be handled by the terminal) in some (mis-)configurations; cf. also [this Python bug report](http://mail.python.org/pipermail//new-bugs-announce/2011-October/011990.html).

Unsetting `TERM` unfortunately doesn't *"effectively disable readline"*, but may trigger other bugs, like the one reported [comment:ticket:11970:25 here].  Using `TERM=unknown` (or `none`) or something like that instead would perhaps avoid both.

Out of curiosity, do you really get an unset TERM in cron jobs and non-interactive ssh sessions? On all of the systems I've tried, it's always 'dumb'.

For context, this is readline outputting the "meta mode on"/"smm" sequence to enable 8 bit mode. This is signalled by the "km" termcap flag, viewable using 'infocmp', where you can also directly see the "smm" sequence.

Are you sure there is an **environment variable** "TERM" in the cases you mention?  It seems to me that bash sets a non-exported variable TERM=dumb if there is no environment variable TERM.  You can see this with "declare -p TERM".  In a normal shell, I get for example

```
$ declare -p TERM
declare -x TERM="xterm"
```
(the -x means exported)

With a non-interactive ssh session:

```
$ ssh sage.math.washington.edu "declare -p TERM"
declare -- TERM="dumb"
```
(no -x, so not exported, i.e. not an environment variable)
