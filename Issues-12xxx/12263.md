Because of either a readline or a Python bug, sometimes control characters are output by Python.  For example, on my Gentoo Linux system:

```
jdemeyer@arcanis:~$ sage --python -c 'import readline' |cat -t
^[[?1034hjdemeyer@arcanis:~$
```

This breaks doctests at #12249 for `sage-run`.  The easiest solution is to unset the `TERM` environment variable when running `sage-run` or `sage-eval`.  This will effectively disable readline.

*"My Gentoo Linux system"* isn't very precise.

Note that (also Sage's) readline uses *some* termcap library, i.e. some "arbitrary" equivalent installed / found on a user's system, which apparently leads to improper output of control sequences (intended to be handled by the terminal) in some (mis-)configurations; cf. also [this Python bug report](http://mail.python.org/pipermail//new-bugs-announce/2011-October/011990.html).

Unsetting `TERM` unfortunately doesn't *"effectively disable readline"*, but may trigger other bugs, like the one reported [comment:ticket:11970:25 here].  Using `TERM=unknown` (or `none`) or something like that instead would perhaps avoid both.

Out of curiosity, do you really get an unset TERM in cron jobs and non-interactive ssh sessions? On all of the systems I've tried, it's always 'dumb'.

For context, this is readline outputting the "meta mode on"/"smm" sequence to enable 8 bit mode. This is signalled by the "km" termcap flag, viewable using 'infocmp', where you can also directly see the "smm" sequence.

On all of the systems I've tried, it's always 'dumb'.\n\nAre you sure there is an **environment variable** \"TERM\" in the cases you mention?  It seems to me that bash sets a non-exported variable TERM=dumb if there is no environment variable TERM.  You can see this with \"declare -p TERM\".  In a normal shell, I get for example\n\n```\n$ declare -p TERM\ndeclare -x TERM=\"xterm\"\n```\n(the -x means exported)\n\nWith a non-interactive ssh session:\n\n```\n$ ssh sage.math.washington.edu \"declare -p TERM\"\ndeclare -- TERM=\"dumb\"\n```\n(no -x, so not exported, i.e. not an environment variable)",

Replying to [@wjp](#comment%3A8):
> Out of curiosity, do you really get an unset TERM in cron jobs and non-interactive ssh sessions? On all of the systems I've tried, it's always 'dumb'.

Are you sure there is an **environment variable** "TERM" in the cases you mention?  It seems to me that bash sets a non-exported variable TERM=dumb if there is no environment variable TERM.  You can see this with "declare -p TERM".  In a normal shell, I get for example

```
$ declare -p TERM
declare -x TERM="xterm"
```
(the -x means exported)

With a non-interactive ssh session:

```
$ ssh sage.math.washington.edu "declare -p TERM"
declare -- TERM="dumb"
```
(no -x, so not exported, i.e. not an environment variable)
