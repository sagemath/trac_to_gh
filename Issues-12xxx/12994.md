The attached patch implements the serialization of setuptools target through the use of helper stamp targets, as discussed recently on the sage-devel mailing-list

The current situation is that some packages have wrong dependencies to force a serialization.

The patch corrects the dependencies, and forces serialization through stamp targets. Notice that on the mailing-list, the sample code created the stamps in . (ie: spkg/), while the current patch puts them in build/ (ie: spkg/build/), since that seemed more logical.

Your patch makes the mistaken assumption that the directory `build/` exists.  In any case, `$(INST)` might be a better directory for this.

Seems like your proposal actually makes the `deps` file more complicated, so I'm not sure I like it...

Why not simply do

```
$(INST)/$(ZODB): $(INST)/$(TWISTED)
```
instead of

```
build/setuptools-serial-1-stamp: $(INST)/$(TWISTED)
        touch $@
$(INST)/$(ZODB): build/setuptools-serial-1-stamp
```

My patch removes that sentence, so I don't understand what you expect :-/

That directory is created in base/prereq-1.0-install (it's even the first thing it does!), so what can happen?

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A2):
> In any case, $(INST) might be a better directory for this.

I pondered for a while between spkg/build/ and spkg/installed/ indeed, because they're the obvious two possible choices, but finally I opted :
* against spkg/installed/, considering that was where sage documents what features are installed, and you can't consider a stamp file as a feature ;
* for spkg/build/, considering that directory was the one used as scratch space during compilations -- and the stamp files seem to fit that description.

> Seems like your proposal actually makes the deps file more complicated, so I'm not sure I like it... 

The current deps works around a problem by cheating on the dependencies : it takes the correct dependencies, and makes them incorrect just so something else doesn't break. My patch is about letting correct things stay correct, and providing the fix for the something which is bad.

A comparison might help : if you bang your head against the wall, it hurts. The current solution is to soften the wall, and my patch is to stop banging.

Actually, prereq-1.0-install creates `SAGE_BUILD_DIR` if this variable is set, `spkg/build` if not. So I guess you should do the same check here: if `SAGE_BUILD_DIR` is set, use it; otherwise use `build/`?

Your patch doesn't solve the problem of lying dependencies. Those packages don't depend on each other, so the deps file must not say otherwise.

I prefer the second patch, because it's simpler while it does essentially the same thing.

Just wondering: why did you reorder the dependencies in that way?

The Sage library depends on `jinja2` to build, so maybe it's best to build `jinja2` first.

Just based off of the dependencies of the packages -- I placed the ones with fewer dependencies earlier in the serial build. I'm not really attached to the ordering I put, I just figured there might be a little less waiting.

I'm looking into fixing this issue in setuptools/distribute directly (I already got my hands dirty in the code fixing another issue), so hopefully this becomes irrelevant.

The path PYTHON -> DOCUTILS -> JINJA2 is faster than
PYHTON -> ZODB -> SQLALCHEMY -> PYGMENTS -> JINJA2.

The build time for ZODB and SQLALCHEMY doesn't matter because nothing depends on it.

Of course it's a detail, but since you were reordering anyway...

The second patch basically does nothing at all : it serializes things precisely like I complain shouldn't be done, by adding wrong but correct-looking edges in the dependency graph.

This is a typical application of the quote : “For every problem there is a solution which is simple, clean and wrong.”

If that problem goes away by getting the original issue down, that's perfect : my goal isn't to make my patch go in -- it's to get things right :  there must not be a "$(INST)/$(FOO): $(INST)/$(BAR)" rule in deps between actual packages which doesn't correspond to an actual dependency.
