See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/953/log-base-10).  Essentially, the poster requests (and it seems reasonable) to add a couple more examples of this.  E.g.,

```
If you could make this change it would be great: "EXAMPLES:
sage: log(e^2)" :
To something like: 
EXAMPLES: 
To change the base of the logarithm, add a second parameter. 
sage: log(1000,10) 
3
Small change but helpful!
```
This is implicit in the examples, but since the first line is just

```
Return the logarithm of x to the given base.
```
and not everyone will understand

```

File:           /Users/.../sage-4.7.2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/functions/log.py
Definition:     log(x, base=None)
Docstring:
       Return the logarithm of x to the given base.
```
Sounds like a good beginner ticket.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">Comment 6</div>

A few things I would like to see:
- Instead of `log()` I would prefer to see linking via <code>:meth:\`log()\`</code>
- The line `Use with the RDF function...`, I would change it to

  ```
  You can use the :class:`RDF<sage.rings.real_double.RealDoubleField_class>`,
  :class:`~sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealField` or ``n`` to get a numerical real approximation::
  ```
  since `RDF` is the real double field and it is constructing an element of that class.
- Remove the line about the `n` function
- Add your real name as the author on the trac ticket

You can check to make sure the documentation looks correct too by calling `sage -docbuild reference html` and looking in the `doc/output/html/` folder in your web browser.

Thanks,

Travis
