Since #12329, sympy might be installed after the Sage library.  The sympy `setup.py` imports lots of stuff, including `sage` itself.  This is obviously not good, since not all of Sage has been built.  Possible consequences include segmentation faults or `sage-cleaner` being started.

The solution is to start `setup.py` with python's `-S` option to start Python with a minimal `sys.path`.

Instead of a comment that sagelocal is defined, why not check it and exit with an error if it is not defined?

That's precisely what's happening in lines 3--7 of `spkg-install`.
