```
This is to support showing a 3d object with spin.

Observed:

```
sage: P = icosahedron(color='green', opacity=.5, mesh=3)
sage: P.show(viewer='jmol', spin=True)  # shows with spin
Launched jmol viewer for Graphics3d Object
sage: P.show(viewer='threejs', spin=True)  # shows, no spin
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object
```

Expected: when calling `show` with `spin=True`,
the object will spin, or a warning will be displayed
indicating that spin is not supported by this viewer.

It would also be nice to support specifying
the axis around which the object spins.

- [Math Stack Exchange question 3471520: sagemath 3d plot tumble (enhanced spin)](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3471520)

Initial note that that `spin=True` only worked with
`viewer=jmol` recorded at the Sage booth at the
2012 AMS-MAA Joint Math Meetings.

Attachment: **[trac_12275_plot3d_warn.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12275/trac_12275_plot3d_warn.patch.gz)**

I added warnings for unused keyword arguments in Graphics3d.show (warnings seemed more appropriate, it would be easy to replace with an error though). In doing so doctest found some bugs elsewhere in sage, which I also fixed.

plot/circle.py:
The doctest attempted to graph a 3d circle like it was a 3d circle. This caused errors as the 2d and 3d plotting parameters are different. A simple variable rename fixed the issue.

geometry/lattice_polytype.py:
LatticePolytypeClass.show incorrectly set axis=False. Instead, it should be axes=False. I fixed this as well.

This needs rebasing.

I'm just not sure what the point of `verify` is.  If an option is invalid, it's invalid.

Can you try to explain exactly why changing the name of `c` to `c3d` made a difference?  I can only assume it's something in your code, but this is totally baffling to me.
