Solve the following problem:

```
sage: s = WordMorphism('1->121,2->131,3->4,4->1')
sage: s == s.reversal()
True
sage: s != s.reversal()
True
```

which is due to:

```
sage: s.__ne__?
Object `s.__ne__` not found.
```

Not much more than this should be added:

```
def __ne__(self, other):
    return not self.__eq__(other)
```

The patch applies correctly on my system and fixes the reported problem: positive review.

I couldn't figure out where the PatchBot fails (yellow icon as of now).
