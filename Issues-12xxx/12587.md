Being mutable and hashable is definetly a bug. See [1].

I don't understand what you mean with repr is the only immutable part, because it may change when the object changes.

You're correct. I forgot that repr outputs the facets.

However I'm not in favor of making SimplicialComplex an immutable object outright since it contains mutators and there are inductive constructions which would require you to build copies. For example, suppose you had an algorithm which built a simplicial complex facet by facet, at each step you would need to clone the SimplicialComplex object in the mutator. Thus extra memory handling and multiple transient objects.

Perhaps we should do something closer to ClonableArray and have an attribute _is_mutable which we set to True when `__hash__()` is called and in any mutators, we do something of the following:

```
if _is_mutable:
    raise TypeError, "This simplicial complex is no longer mutable"
```
Thus making it immutable as soon as it becomes hashed?

Also we'd have

```
__hash__(self):
    _is_mutable = True
    return hash(self.facets())
```

Your thoughts?

I don't like this idea because it violoates the principle of least suprise. For example the question if an object can be modified depends upon the question if it has been added into a set or not. 
Better add an explicit method that sets this attribute.

Good point. Then how about this?

```
def set_immutable(self):
    self._is_mutable = False

def __hash__(self):
    if not _is_mutable:

I have no opinion on what the best error types and messages are for this, but it is probably good if they are consistent. Since this is completely analogous to matrices, you should probably follow that example or change it to conform to yours (if you have good arguments to change it):

```
sage: M=matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: M.__hash__()
TypeError: mutable matrices are unhashable
sage: M[0,0]=5
sage: M.set_immutable()
sage: M.__hash__()
sage: M[0,0]=5
ValueError: matrix is immutable; please change a copy instead (i.e., use copy(M) to change a copy of M).
```
On the other hand:

```
sage: t=(1,2,3)
sage: t[0]=4
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```
but then again a `ValueError` indicates something that something is wrong with the value, not with the type (`tuple` is never mutable, but `matrix` can be).

Sage isn't consistent (yet?) in this regard:

```
sage: L=Sequence([1,2,3])
sage: hash(L)
ValueError: mutable sequences are unhashable
sage: L.append(4)
sage: L.set_immutable()
sage: hash(L)
...
sage: L.append(4)
ValueError: object is immutable; please change a copy instead.
```
On the one hand, it's convenient if "hash(...)" always gives the same kind of
error on an unhashable object (easier to catch). This is what `Matrix` does.

One the other, if a class instance can change from being unhashable to being
hashable it's obviously not a property of the class, but of this individual
object (its "value"). This is what `Sequence` does.

Don't go deleting methods! That's just a hack. Cython classes can't even do it.
If you want to go that way, you should make it a separate category
`FrozenSimplicialComplex`, ala `set` and `frozenset` in python itself, but the
approach you currently propose is more in line with other sage classes.

To be consistant, I changed it into a mutator. Let me know if there are any objections.

I've changed everything to raise a ValueError. I'm wondering if we should create a new exception class for mutable objects such as MutableError. Probabily needs a discussion and for sure another ticket.

That's a good point about the cython class. I'm going to keep with the current methodology.

A priori, no. You're right, I could not find any code either (I looked through both the homology and combinat directories) which used `add_face()` other than for the doc-tests.

We were/are working on a patch on implementing "subword complexes" (which are simplicial complexes) as defined by Knutson and Miller in [1].

<a id='comment:20'>Comment 20:</a>
Since you propose to make the hash only dependent on the facets:

```
sage: S = SimplicialComplex([1,2,3],[[1,2]])
sage: S
Simplicial complex with vertex set (1, 2, 3) and facets {(1, 2)}
```
(`[1,2,3]` is actually not the vertex set, but the *ground set*, while the vertex set is `[1,2]`.) The proposed implementation only takes the facets into account for hashing, thus we get the same hash for

```
sage: S = SimplicialComplex([1,2],[[1,2]])
sage: S
Simplicial complex with vertex set (1, 2) and facets {(1, 2)}
```

Is this the desired behaviour - or should the ground set be used as well for hashing?

(I don't have a strong opinion on this question, but I thought I bring it up anyway. If you don't want to take care of the vertex set vs. ground set issue in this ticket here, I will open another and ask for other peoples opinion there.)

There are a few possibilities:

1. This is a bug, in that `(3,)` should also be listed as a facet.
2. We handle this more like a matroid (I believe this is what you're suggesting) and add methods like `ground_set()`.

Well, it's certainly the documented behavior (I mean the documented behavior of simplicial complexes). Note that you can also do

```
S = SimplicialComplex([[1,2]])
```
to get a complex with a single facet. So the vertex list is already an optional argument, in some sense.

I think that the hash should only depend on the facets; the unused vertices shouldn't have any effect. That makes the most mathematical sense to me.

I agree.

But I still think that mathematically, a vertex is a 0-dimensional face, and thus must be contained in some facet, see [1] or basically any book on simplicial complexes.

I think it would be absolutely fine to change the *documentation* of `SimplicialComplex` to encourage the use of

```
sage: SimplicialComplex( list of facets )

Hi Travis,

I started to review the patch. Everything looks quite well, but you seem to have missed handling the parameters properly, see below:

```
sage: S = SimplicialComplex(maximal_faces=[[1,4], [2,4]])
...
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
```

and with this

```
sage: S = SimplicialComplex(vertex_set=[1,2,4],maximal_faces=[[1,4], [2,4]])    
sage: S
Simplicial complex with vertex set (1, 2, 4) and facets {(2, 4), (1, 4)}
```
The deprecation could maybe as well quickly be mentioned in the init of SimplicialComplex, since `vertex_set` is still there as an optional argument.

I also had this problem only the first time I built the documentation.

Now, the reference is missing in the documentation of Simplex.product, which I don't think is the solution either. When I was doing the review, I spent some time to figure out how to solve this issue but didn't manage to do so.

Do you happen to know how to either reference a citation in a different file, or to have the same citation in different files without getting a warning?

Best, Christian

I would guess that if you delete the documentation output, or if you somehow force Sage to rebuild the documentation of delta_complex.py, you'll see the warning again.

> Now, the reference is missing in the documentation of Simplex.product, which I don't think is the solution either. When I was doing the review, I spent some time to figure out how to solve this issue but didn't manage to do so.

I still see the reference, and if I click on the citation, I get taken to the reference in the other file. Also, most people reading the docstring will know what "Hatcher" means – it's not an obscure reference – so won't even need to look it up.

> Do you happen to know how to either reference a citation in a different file

It works for me. Try rebuilding all of the documentation (`rm -rf SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/` and then `sage --docbuild reference html`).

Saying this: might it be even worth adding the reference of the freely available pdf version of the book?

This indeed solved the issue on my machine as well, thanks!

Here's what happened (in writing this patch):
- I wrote the reference into `simplicial_complex.py`,
- compiled doc and got the warning,
- remove the reference and rebuilt the doc from that (i.e. just that file),
- it did not link, so put the reference back in and no warning showed up,
- rebuilt the entire documentation without any #12587 patches applied
- added the review patches, then all references/linking worked.

Rebuilding the entire documentation is the only way to get it to work since references are global and global changes are (currently) only removed/edited when the entire documentation is rebuilt. (This is unbelievably annoying to me when working between patches that add/modify .rst files.) Or something like that...
