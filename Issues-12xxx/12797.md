When using the Ford-Fulkerson method for edge_cut of an undirected weighted graph, the value of the minimum cut is correct, but sometimes the returned edge cut does not have that value.  The LP method for edge_cut does seem to always return the correct answer.

Below is a simplified example due to Doug McNeil.

```
sage: G = Graph([(0, 3, 1), (0, 4, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (2, 4, 1)])
sage: G.edge_cut(0,1,value_only=False,use_edge_labels=True)
[1, [(0, 3, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1)]]
sage: G.edge_cut(0,1,value_only=False,use_edge_labels=True,method='LP')
(1.0, [(1, 2)])
```

This bug can quite easily be fixed by replacing in the code the part:

```
g = self.copy()
for u,v,l in flow_graph.edge_iterator():
    if (not use_edge_labels or
        (weight(g.edge_label(u,v)) == weight(l))):
        g.delete_edge(u,v)
```

by:


```
g = self.copy()
for u,v,l in flow_graph.edge_iterator():
    g.add_edge(v, u)                         # <-- Added line
    if (not use_edge_labels or
        (weight(g.edge_label(u,v)) == weight(l))):
        g.delete_edge(u,v)
```

This is because the usual algorithms search for the vertices reachable by s in the residual graph. However, the original graph is not a residual graph, and thus the constructed graph "g" not as well, as it does not have to have all back-edges. Therefore, the partition of vertices is calculated incorrectly, and therefor the edges exhibiting the cut as well.

OKayyyyyyyyyyyy, looks like converting the digraph was sufficient `:-)`

By the way it also fixes a "theoretical bug" : I am not sure that this code was meant to handle the situation where there is a cycle in the residual graph (I don't know if it ever happens). With this, no problem.

Thanks for the report ! Now this patch just needs a review before being merged into Sage.

To test what exactly? The LP method does not use the code that is being changed here, and there are already some doctests with the LP method in this function?...

> Furthermore, the conversion to digraph should be done only if self is undirected, right?

The description of this patch compares the result returned by FF with the one of LP.
Adding one line will show that everything is in order.
