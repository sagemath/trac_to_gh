In the two files named in the title, the `.. topic::` directive is improperly used (namely as `..topic:` without the blank space and with only one colon), and moreover it should actually be `.. rubric::` instead.

Moreover, some lists are indented too much, and in some case an empty line is missing, such as

```
    Further things to do:
     - Use UniqueRepresentation to get rid of all the manual cache handling for the bases
     - Devise a mechanism so that pickling bases of symmetric functions pickles
       the coercions which have a cache.
```
versus

```
    Further things to do:

    - Use UniqueRepresentation to get rid of all the manual cache handling for the bases
    - Devise a mechanism so that pickling bases of symmetric functions pickles
      the coercions which have a cache.
```

In some places a double colon `::` was missing.

I also suggest to use the `.. todo::` markup more often.

And last but not least, I believe that sage/combinat/sf/sf.py should be put into the reference manual.
