I discovered this while working on #12541.  Documentation says the `check` will "coerce entries of gens into base field."  This does not appear to be happening, and should.  (Edit: this is an integral span of rational vectors, a construction that is intended, so improving the documentation might be in order.)

I'll look at it today/tomorrow if nobody beats me.

A side remark (for probably the next ticket?): while working on #12541 I had to fix several pieces of code that looked almost the same. In fact, I have removed exactly the same *wrong* lines from six places or so in different specializations of free modules. Perhaps these `span` and `submodule` methods can be somehow consolidated, e.g. have `span` only in the base class which calls `_span` of subclasses for actual work after all the typechecking and conversion. Or, if it is really necessary to have them everywhere, maybe there can be only 1 or 2 good long docstrings, as the one provided by Rob here, and others should just link to it?

Little picks:
* "INPUTS" should be without "S" according to guidelines.
* There also should be "OUTPUT" and perhaps it can precisely state here where the resulting submodule lives.

Otherwise looks good to me!
