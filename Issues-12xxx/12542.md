```
The following fails, but shouldn't:

```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: f = pi*x^10*y+3*x
sage: f.polynomial(SR)
```

Also, you should be able to do the following

```
sage: var('a,x,y')
sage: f = a*x^10*y+3*x
sage: B = f.polynomial(ring=SR['x,y'])
sage: B.coefficients()
[a, 3]
```

expression.pyx:

Can you add documentation for the new `ring` parameter (and maybe the existing `base_ring`, too)? What's the difference between `ring` and `base_ring`?

constants.py:

Same thing, we should document the parameter. It looks like it's just some ring, but not necessarily the global `SR`? In that case, we should use a different name to avoid confusion.

Can we include a doctest for your second example in the description?
