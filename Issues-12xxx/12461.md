We should prepare moving to Python3.

Execute

```
2to3 -f has_key -f except -f idioms -f ne -f raise
```
for each *.py in sage/algebras.

See http://docs.python.org/library/2to3.html#fixers for meaning of the parameters.

I don't like the change at line 148 of `free_algebra_quotient`:

```
 	148	        return isinstance(self, type(right)) and \ 
149	149	               self.ngens() == right.ngens() and \ 
150	150	               self.rank() == right.rank() and \ 
151	151	               self.module() == right.module() and \ 
```

If `type(right)` was some very generic base class like SageObject, then the first statement would be True, but the remaining ones would be completely meaningless, so you'd get weird errors being raised. It should probably be ` isinstance(other, FreeAlgebraQuotient)` or something like that.

That is my only disagreement with this patch, so if you can do a tiny fix for that I'll happily give it a positive review.
