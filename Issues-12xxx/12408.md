The following piece of code, inserted in the matrix code, triggers a segfault in Sage 4.8, whereas it used to work in 4.7.2:

```
    def _travel_column( self, dict d, int k):
        r"""
        Triggers a seg fault in Sage 4.8 but not 4.7.2

            sage: M = matrix(ZZ,3,[0,1,0,-1,0,-1,0,1,0]); M
            [ 0  1  0]
            [-1  0 -1]
            [ 0  1  0]
            sage: M._travel_column({0:1},0)
            ** BOOM, Segfault **

        """
        cdef int i
        for i from 0 <= i < self.ncols():
            d[i] = 1
            print any(self[i,j] != 1 for j in d)
```

To reproduce: apply the attached patch on vanilla Sage 4.8, and run
the example above. Platform: at least Ubuntu 11.10 on a Macbook pro.

I suspect this issue to be related to the upgraded iterators in the
new version of Cython included in Sage.

Note: the code is meaningless by itself; it's the smallest reduction I
could make of a real piece of code that triggered the seg fault in the
first place (#10347). For example there is no segfault if `any` is
replaced by a list comprehension.  Also, without the for loop, I get
an exception ``NameError: free variable 'self' referenced before
assignment in enclosing scope''.

Cython experts, please!

Please someone update the component of this ticket once we know more
precisely what the issue is.
