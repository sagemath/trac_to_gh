In algebras/all.py we find the following function:

```
def is_R_algebra(Q, R):
    # TODO: do something nontrivial when morphisms are defined.
    return True
```

A search of the source shows that this function is not used anywhere else in sage, and good thing too, cause it's obviously wrong.  The attached patch deletes this function.

Apply trac12747-newline.patch

(for the patchbot). This function is totally laughable, and the patch looks fine except for one breathtakingly trivial niggle: in Sage we generally like code files to end with a newline character, so I restored the newline you had shaved off the end of algebras/all.py. I guess that single newline doesn't merit a re-review, so I'm setting this to positive review.
