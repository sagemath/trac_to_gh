Parent.__getitem__ should be moved to FiniteEnumeratedSets (#12955). Alas, this is not yet possible since too many finite enumerated sets in Sage are not in the FiniteEnumeratedSets category (see #12957). In the meantime, this patch provides a workaround by asking Parent.__getitem__ to first try to call `__getitem__` on its super classes.
