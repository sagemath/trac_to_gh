```
Currently there are two functions for testing whether an integer is a perfect power:

```
sage: 8.is_power()
True
sage: 8.is_perfect_power()
True
```

* This patch deprecates `is_power`.
* It implements a new function, `perfect_power`, wrapping PARI's `ispower` function, expressing an integer in the form a<sup>b</sup> with `b` maximal.
* It adds cross references between `is_perfect_power`, `is_power_of`, `is_prime_power` and `perfect_power`.

This revealed three bugs in PARI's `ispower()` function:
1. Two issues reported and fixed at [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1259](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1259)

Here's the response from the Pari developers:

```
The 2 problems turned out to be independant. They are now fixed in the
'testing' branch, in the following 2 commits:

commit f53eb2a7c79922ac51423e75044722628893159e
Author: Karim Belabas <Karim.Belabas@math.u-bordeaux1.fr>
Date:   Sun Dec 4 17:43:19 2011 +0100

   46- ispower(1 / n) return a wrong result [#1259]

commit 74aef498d380979211b99d64f4f4c92b8bac853f
Author: Karim Belabas <Karim.Belabas@math.u-bordeaux1.fr>
Date:   Sun Dec 4 17:28:14 2011 +0100

   45- ispower(x < 0) could return an even value ! [#1259]
```

That was quick.  :-)

The upstream fix is in Sage now (#12363).  Could you remove the workaround code from the patch?

<a id='comment:10'>Comment 10:</a>
Can we have a new option for the "Report Upstream" menu, "upstream claim to have fixed it but they apparently haven't"? PARI apparently believes that ` 2^3 = -8 `:

```
                                      GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version 2.5.1 (development git-5c5e253)
                                     amd64 running linux (x86-64/GMP-5.0.1 kernel) 64-bit version
                                       compiled: Mar  5 2012, gcc-4.4.3 (Ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5) 
                                            (readline v6.2 enabled, extended help enabled)

                                                Copyright (C) 2000-2011 The PARI Group

PARI/GP is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.

Type ? for help, \q to quit.
Type ?12 for how to get moral (and possibly technical) support.

parisize = 8000000, primelimit = 500509
? ispower(-8, , &n)
%1 = 3
? n
%2 = 2
```

So I suggest we merge this patch as it is, and send another bug report to PARI -- roed, can you do the honours?

I think Cython is smart enough to figure out what's going on here since Integer has an `__int__` method.  You can see in the generated C code for `exp, b = b.perfect_power()` (leaving out lots of error checking and reference counting):

```
__pyx_t_1 = PyObject_GetAttr(__pyx_v_b, __pyx_n_s__perfect_power);
__pyx_t_7 = PyObject_Call(__pyx_t_1, ((PyObject *)__pyx_empty_tuple), NULL);
PyObject* sequence = __pyx_t_7;
Py_ssize_t size = Py_SIZE(sequence);
__pyx_t_1 = PyTuple_GET_ITEM(sequence, 0);
__pyx_t_11 = __Pyx_PyInt_AsInt(__pyx_t_1);
__pyx_v_exp = __pyx_t_11;
```

> * Do we need to deprecate `base_exponent`?  It would be easy enough, basically same code as deprecating `is_power` except reverse the order of the output.

It's probably a good idea.  I'll do it shortly.

Everything checks out. Patch applies, tests pass. However:

```
def perfect_power(self): 
    r""" 	         
    Returns ``(a, b)``, where this integer is `b^a` and `a` is maximal.
    ...
```
So

```
sage: a = 11^14
sage: a.perfect_power()
(14, 11)
```
I know the code just wraps PARI which returns the integers in this order, but this seems an unnatural way to order the returned pair.

I've uploaded a modified version of the patch so that we get

```
sage: a = 11^14
sage: a.perfect_power()
(11, 14)
```
which feels a lot more natural.

The new patch also fixes a possible formatting error in the documentation of `self.is_perfect_power()`:

```
Returns ``True`` if self is a perfect power, ie if there exist integers
a and b, `b > 1` with `\texttt{self} = a^b`.
```
becomes

```
Returns ``True`` if ``self`` is a perfect power, ie if there exist integers
`a` and `b`, `b > 1` with ``self`` `= a^b`.
```

We missed another line. In `self.factor_aurifeuillian()` in factorint.pyx, we have

```
...
b = n + x
exp, b = b.perfect_power()
if exp > 1:
...
```
This must now become

```
...
b = n + x
b, exp = b.perfect_power()
if exp > 1:
...
```
otherwise this method breaks with the new ordering of values returned by `perfect_power()`. I've uploaded a new patch that fixes this.

Hopefully that should be it.
