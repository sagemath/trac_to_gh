`attach?` presently says:

```
     Type ``attached_files()`` for a list of all currently
     attached files. You can remove files from this list to stop them
     from being watched.
```
but that's wrong. One should use `detach`.

I think the `detach(...)` string should be replaced by `detach(filename)` so that it is more explicit what the argument of `detach` should be. For instance, detach does not take in lists which I think it should, but that is the context of some other ticket.

Actually it can be written as

```
:meth:`detach()` method
```

As for the other "problems" with detach, I have now opened #12634.
