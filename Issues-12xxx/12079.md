The attached patch fixes two memory leaks triggered by repeatedly calling mpmath.zeta(s) for complex s, as reported on sage-nt. Example:

```
import mpmath

for i in range(200):
    x = mpmath.zetazero(2000)
    print get_memory_usage()
```

there is more to that, see comments below (the 1st patch isn't curing all of them)

<a id='comment:4'></a>with the patch applied, a slight modification shows another leak:

```
for k in range(100):
    reset(); 
    import mpmath, gc;# 
    gc.collect()
    from mpmath import *
    mp.dps=1000 
    r=randint(50,200)
    ii=mpmath.zetazero(r)
    print r, get_memory_usage()
    ii=mpmath.zetazero(r)
    print r, get_memory_usage()
    ii=mpmath.zetazero(r)
```

here is part of output:

It does not show if one repeatedly computes the same root of zeta, perhaps meaning that this is a memoization problem...
