Duplicate of #11208

If I do (in Sage 4.7.2 or 4.8.alpha6)

```
plot_slope_field(1, (1,2), (3,4))
```
(or anything else that I have tried), then in front of the plot, which looks as expected, I get

```
Warning: divide by zero encountered in divide
Warning: invalid value encountered in multiply
Warning: invalid value encountered in multiply
Warning: divide by zero encountered in divide
Warning: invalid value encountered in multiply
Warning: invalid value encountered in multiply
```

My investigation so far shows: this function is a little wrapper for `plot_vector_field` which sets new defaults for three options. If `headlength` is set to 0, there are warnings.

A possible workaround is to set it to something small: 0.001 seems to work on the screen. However, since with `headaxislength=0` and `headlength=0.2` I definitely see "a hair on the end", it does not seem to be satisfactory from a perfectionist point of view (and producing vector formats that may be scaled or printed with high resolution).

Besides, current settings do produce the accurate plot, it just shows warnings that should not be there, and I have no idea how to fix it.

It seems like I remember that this was fixed in the new matplotlib 1.1.0 release (an spkg is up on trac somewhere).

Yes, the same issue both in 4.7.2 and 4.8.alpha6 with #11915 applied. Are these warnings coming from matplotlib? Also, what would be an appropriate doctest for this bug?
