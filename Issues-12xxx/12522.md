```
The top-level Sage script doesn't check the value of `SAGE_ROOT` if it was set from the outside.  Example:

```
$ SAGE_ROOT=does_not_exist ./sage
./sage: line 118: cd: does_not_exist: No such file or directory
./sage: line 122: /spkg/bin/sage: No such file or directory
```

After:

```
$ SAGE_ROOT=does_not_exist ./sage
./sage: line 118: cd: does_not_exist: No such file or directory
./sage: cannot determine SAGE_ROOT directory
```

The new top-level script can now also be used together with sage-4.x:

```
$ SAGE_ROOT=/usr/local/src/sage-4.8.alpha6 /usr/local/src/sage-5.0.beta1/sage
