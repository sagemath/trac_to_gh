Doctests should succeed even if the tests in a given file are run in a different order, as long as the doctests in each block get run consecutively.  But there are various points in the Sage library where doctests depend on the order they're run in, often masking bugs.  It would be great if someone would systematically try to make doctests for all the files in Sage pass in this mode.  

A good start would be to add a way to rerun doctests in a given order after a doctest fails.

Depends on #12415

Would it be possible to make the doctester reset state between individual docstrings? That seems like the "correct" way to do it, but Python is such a stateful language that I'm not sure how possible that even is.
