The patch (to the root repo) removes start.log and spkg/parallel_make.cfg when you run "make distclean".  It no longer removes the ipython directory.

I'm upgrading this to "blocker": running 'make distclean' shouldn't break your Sage distribution.  It does now because it deletes the ipython directory.  (The patch is also easy to review, I think.)

What exactly is the `ipython` directory needed for?  I just deleted the `ipython` directory from a sage-4.8.alpha2 installation and everything still seems to work fine.

Well, if you don't have a DOT_SAGE directory, the contents from SAGE_ROOT/ipython/ are copied to DOT_SAGE/ipython when DOT_SAGE is created.

If you've just run `make distclean`, how will $DOT_SAGE get created?

Oh, sorry. I thought the ipython directory would be recreated after a build, and I had to `make distclean` and then sit through a full rebuild to see that's not the case.

I have reviewed:

1. Confirm that spkg/parallel_make.cfg gets created/used in the following:

   * spkg/install
   * spkg/standard/deps

2. Confirm that start.log should be removed.

3. `make distclean`. Remove my ~/.sage directory. Build and try to start sage. Crashes per the ticket.


So, looks good.
