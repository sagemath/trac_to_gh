The patch (to the root repo) removes start.log and spkg/parallel_make.cfg when you run "make distclean".  It no longer removes the ipython directory.

What exactly is the `ipython` directory needed for?  I just deleted the `ipython` directory from a sage-4.8.alpha2 installation and everything still seems to work fine.

I don't think I understand your question.  The point of the patch here is that if you download a Sage source distribution and run `make distclean`, it breaks the distribution: the Sage root repository is no longer clean, and more importantly, if you have no `$DOT_SAGE` directory, then when you build and run Sage, it will fail when it tries to create `DOT_SAGE/ipython/`.

Oh, sorry. I thought the ipython directory would be recreated after a build, and I had to `make distclean` and then sit through a full rebuild to see that's not the case.

I have reviewed:

1. Confirm that spkg/parallel_make.cfg gets created/used in the following:

   * spkg/install
   * spkg/standard/deps

2. Confirm that start.log should be removed.

3. `make distclean`. Remove my ~/.sage directory. Build and try to start sage. Crashes per the ticket.


So, looks good.
