GCC 4.7.0 is broken on ia64 (Itanium), which also affects the GMP-ECM spkg (cf. #12751).

---

Adding `-march=native` to `CFLAGS` may lead to assembler errors, e.g. on MacOS X with newer GCCs on newer CPUs (e.g. such supporting AVX, which Apple's assembler currently doesn't).

Newer versions of MPIR don't define `__GMP_CFLAGS` (in `gmp.h`) to a *string literal*, but instead to a *preprocessor macro* (`__MPIR_CFLAGS`), which in turn is defined to the string we want.

**New spkg:** [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/ecm-6.3.p7.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/ecm-6.3.p7.spkg)

**md5sum:** `a5e9a4b47d30c4aba2c77ada47579e1a  ecm-6.3.p7.spkg`


### ecm-6.3.p7 (Leif Leonhardy, April 19th 2012)
* #12830: Add `-m[no-]power*` to the processor-specific options recognized;
  these are used to enable/disable specific instruction set extensions of the
  POWER and PowerPC (PPC) CPUs. 

### ecm-6.3.p6 (Leif Leonhardy, April 16th 2012)
* #12830: Add a work-around for GCC 4.7.x on ia64 (Itanium), since GMP-ECM
  currently won't build with that and anything but `-O0` on that platform.
* Use `\{1,\}` instead of `\+` in `sed` patterns, which is more portable.
* Also support newer system-wide MPIR installations for printing their
  settings.
* Use `patch` to apply patches.  Since the pre-patched `configure` in
  `patches/` was created with a newer version of autotools (or, rather, the
  original `configure` was created with an outdated version), the patch would
  have been almost as large as the patched `configure` file itself.  Hence
  I `autoreconf`ed the source tree with a patched `configure.in` (and almost
  the latest versions of autotools), then created a patch to `configure`
  from the resulting file(s).  Note that therefore `src/` isn't really vanilla
  any more, although just the auto-generated files differ (which are still
  made from vanilla upstream sources, including `configure.in`).
  Add a "Patches" subsection and update "Special Update/Build Instructions".
  Remove files in `patches/` from `.hgignore` (and also remove pre-patched
  files from that directory); the patch to `configure` and the diff of
  `configure.in` are [now] under revision control, which IMHO makes sense.
* Beautify (and simplify) the output with respect to options passed to
  `configure`; print the settings of a few more environment variables that
  GMP-ECM uses (in case they're set); add some messages, also mention
  `--enable-assert` etc. if `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`.
* Remove unused test for GCC.

### ecm-6.3.p5 (Leif Leonhardy, April 11th 2012)
* #12830: Don't add `-march=native` if the assembler doesn't understand the
  instructions the compiler emits with that.  (E.g. the Apple/XCode assembler
  on Darwin doesn't yet support AVX.)
* Fix extraction of `__GMP_CC` and `__GMP_CFLAGS` (from `gmp.h`) for newer
  versions of MPIR, which define these to preprocessor macros rather than
  strings.
* Redirect warnings and error messages to `stderr`; add some messages.
* Correct `SPKG.txt` w.r.t. applied patches.

Concerning `march=native`: what do you think about using `testcflags.sh` for this?  Let's add

```
unsigned long fancy_insns() { return (unsigned long) d; }
```
to the program that `testcflags.sh` uses to check flags.

Then we could do something like

```
if testcflags.sh -march=native >/dev/null; then
    CFLAGS="-march=native $CFLAGS"
elif testcflags.sh "-march=native -mno-avx" >/dev/null; then
    echo >&2 "Warning bla bla"
    CFLAGS="-march=native -mno-avx $CFLAGS"

Well, using `gmp.h` is the documented, supposed way to do this, and compatible to GMP.

Extracting the flags isn't complicated (nor a kludge); complain to the MPIR developers that they break GMP compatibility even with `--enable-gmpcompat` (as I already did).  The extra code working around this is six lines IIRC, and not really complicated.



 
If you want MPIR and GMP to store the flags elsewhere, suggest them to create a `pkg-config` file (although "standard" `.pc` files don't have a variable for the compiler used).

We could of course create our own in MPIR's (and GMP's) `spkg-install`, but that doesn't make much sense to me, since then again our other spkgs using the `.pc` file would depend on Sage's versions (and a recent version of Sage itself).

It's for informational purposes; it's not bad to compare (potentially) MPIR's flags to those of a system-wide GMP (or MPIR) installation.


> 2. Remove `unset RM` which isn't needed anymore.

It doesn't hurt, and doesn't break anything.

On the contrary, removing it may break the installation of the spkg on older versions of Sage.

Probably.  Although `testcflags.sh` is currently broken... ;-)

I'm not sure if we should do such a complicated test whenever some arbitrary compiler flag is to be tested.  We'd never know whether the compiler, the assembler or the linker caused an error.

Using it again requires newer versions of Sage for little reason, which I don't like in general.


`testcflags.sh` might have an option to not use `CFLAGS` btw.; otherwise one would have to `(unset CFLAGS; testcflags.sh ...)` or specifically construct `CFLAGS` for the desired purpose.

Why does it matter whether the compiler, assembler or linker caused the problem?  What matters is that it doesn't work.

> Using it again requires newer versions of Sage for little reason, which I don't like in general.

That I noticed :-)

Using `testcflags.sh` looks like the cleaner and simpler solution to me.

> `testcflags.sh` might have an option to not use `CFLAGS` btw.; otherwise one would have to `(unset CFLAGS; testcflags.sh ...)` or specifically construct `CFLAGS` for the desired purpose.

I think 

```
CFLAGS= testcflags.sh -flag
```
is simple enough.

Why reinvent the wheel?

(And reading `gmp.h` isn't complicated at all, presumably because doing so is intended...)

I don't see the point.  First of all, that would be incompatible to any other MPIR or GMP installation / package, and we'd certainly have to change all packages using such a file whenever we change "Sage's format" (or handling) of MPIR's flags / settings.

You are already reinventing the wheel by manually `sed`ding the flags out of the header file, as opposed to using autoconf.  So if we reinvent the wheel, let's reinvent it as simple as possible.

+### ecm-6.3.p6 (Leif Leonhardy, April 16th 2012)
+* #12830: Add a work-around for GCC 4.7.x on ia64 (Itanium), since GMP-ECM
+  currently won't build with that and anything but `-O0` on that platform.
+* Use `\{1,\}` instead of `\+` in `sed` patterns, which is more portable.
+* Also support newer system-wide MPIR installations for printing their
+  settings.
+* Use `patch` to apply patches.  Since the pre-patched `configure` in
+  `patches/` was created with a newer version of autotools (or, rather, the
+  original `configure` was created with an outdated version), the patch would
+  have been almost as large as the patched `configure` file itself.  Hence
+  I `autoreconf`ed the source tree with a patched `configure.in` (and almost
+  the latest versions of autotools), then created a patch to `configure`
+  from the resulting file(s).  Note that therefore `src/` isn't really vanilla
+  any more, although just the auto-generated files differ (which are still
+  made from vanilla upstream sources, including `configure.in`).
+  Add a "Patches" subsection and update "Special Update/Build Instructions".
+  Remove files in `patches/` from `.hgignore` (and also remove pre-patched
+  files from that directory); the patch to `configure` and the diff of
+  `configure.in` are [now] under revision control, which IMHO makes sense.
+* Beautify (and simplify) the output with respect to options passed to
+  `configure`; print the settings of a few more environment variables that
+  GMP-ECM uses (in case they're set); add some messages, also mention
+  `--enable-assert` etc. if `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`.
+* Remove unused test for GCC.

In your `case` statement:

```
-march=*|-mcpu=*|-mtune*)
```
add `-mpower*` which MPIR also uses.

Of course, I still think the `spkg-install` is overly complicated and re-invents too many wheels.  But since you don't want to give in, I guess I'll have to, otherwise this will never get merged.

And we do use `egrep` in a couple of other spkgs (and probably scripts, too) since quite a while by the way.

In general, the safest way would be to use some `$EGREP`, determined by Sage's `configure`, but that's a different story...

This seems to be a known feature of `gcc -march=native` sometimes emitting SSE4 asm that is not supported by the installed binutils. See also http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32062

I don't think that `gcc` ever checks what the assembler supports.  It just emits instructions and assumes that the assembler knows about them.
