Okay, this is okay.  Hopefully it won't cause too much trouble.  I almost feel like it's a good opportunity to actually doctest all these many potential raised errors like

```
sage: k,n = var('k,n')
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_sum(k * binomial(n, k), k, k, n)
ValueError: summation limits must not depend on the summation variable
```
but that would be beyond this ticket.  Feel free to do it!
