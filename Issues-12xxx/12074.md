Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A2):
> Is there any chance this could be made into a function that we can do calculus with, like computing derivatives, integrals, solving equations...  (I'm afraid the answer will be no though because we need maxima).


This is already a symbolic function, so it plays well with symbolics generally (as opposed to piecewise functions for instance):

```
sage: v = nth_root(x,3)
sage: v*sin(x) + x^2
x^2 + real_nth_root(x, 3)*sin(x)
```

I updated the patch to add custom exponentiation and derivative methods as well:

```
sage: v^2
real_nth_root(x, 3/2)
sage: v*v
real_nth_root(x, 3/2)
sage: v.diff(x)
1/3*real_nth_root(x, -3/2)
```

This all needs a lot of work of course.

For integration and solving equations we call out to maxima. One way to get sensible results from these calls would be to convert this function to a regular `(base)^(exp)` representation when passing it to maxima. I don't think there is any way to read it back from the maxima result though.

There is some interest in this again, due to an upcoming book's 2nd edition.

Sympy's solution may be more elegant in some ways, because it uses `Abs(x)**(1/3)*sign(x)` for `real_root(x,3)`, apparently.   If that solution (in Sage, of course, with translations to Sympy) has better support overall in Sage we could just do that instead (for odd roots).

Here's the full Sympy code. They have better handling of complicated piecewise things, I guess.

```
    from sympy.functions.elementary.complexes import Abs, im, sign
    from sympy.functions.elementary.piecewise import Piecewise
    if n is not None:
        return Piecewise(
            (root(arg, n, evaluate=evaluate), Or(Eq(n, S.One), Eq(n, S.NegativeOne))),
            (Mul(sign(arg), root(Abs(arg), n, evaluate=evaluate), evaluate=evaluate),
            And(Eq(im(arg), S.Zero), Eq(Mod(n, 2), S.One))),
            (root(arg, n, evaluate=evaluate), True))
    rv = sympify(arg)
    n1pow = Transform(lambda x: -(-x.base)**x.exp,
                      lambda x:
                      x.is_Pow and
                      x.base.is_negative and
                      x.exp.is_Rational and
                      x.exp.p == 1 and x.exp.q % 2)
    return rv.xreplace(n1pow)
```

Kwankyu (관규?), thanks so much for getting that ball rolling, and the doctests/doc looks good so far.

Here are some questions/comments (for anyone, not necessarily for klee):
* See [this list of plot methods for this](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/plot/plot.py#L1502) in the plot doc.  We should add this, perhaps as the first-order approximation.
* The file [faq-usage.rst](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/doc/en/faq/faq-usage.rst) also should be amended since it mentions the same issue.
* Maybe even there should be a plot example in this file, and then a link to this function from the plot doc?
* Does this one work with derivatives/integrals?  Maybe in the meantime we don't need the custom method.
* Apparently Mathematica now has something like this, called [Surd](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Surd.html) which, while perhaps technically a correct name, is not exactly inspiring to anyone who has taken math since 1950 ... Perhaps this is because Maple [also has the same name](https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=surd) though not capitalized.  I like the !Sage/Sympy name *much* better, but anyway these can be added to the conversions.  (I don't think Maxima has an equivalent for now.)

The current behavior of integer/float exponentiation is due to python, I guess?

```
$ python
Python 3.7.7 (default, May  8 2020, 10:21:17) 
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> (-1)**(1/3)
(0.5000000000000001+0.8660254037844386j)
```

Otherwise the question can be asked: why not make that return real numbers when the argument is real? Which leads me to this question: would it make sense to call this function `nth_root`, and to have it return the real/complex answer depending on whether or not the argument is real/complex?

(I also like having the codomain of a function be explicit, so I'm not really advocating for this, just wondering out loud.)

Now it works for real ball fields: 

```
sage: a = RBF(-2)
sage: real_nth_root(a, 3)
[-1.259921049894873 +/- 3.92e-16]
```
and for real interval fields:

```
sage: a = RIF(-2)
sage: real_nth_root(a, 3)
-1.259921049894873?
```

>  - I think we need a derivative implementation. I'd say just the formal rule `d/dx real_nth_root(x,n) = 1/n*sgn(x)*real_nth_root(x,n)^(1/n-1)`. Naturally, we don't have to support differentiation with respect to the second variable.


I guess you meant `d/dx real_nth_root(x,n) = 1/n*real_nth_root(x,n)^(1-n)`. Done.

>  - I think `real_nth_root(x,n)^m` should not simplify to `real_nth_root(x^m,n)`. For instance, for `real_nth_root(-1,2)^2` this goes wrong.


`real_nth_root(-1,2)` now raises `ValueError`. The simplification is valid for other cases.

> After all, the point of this function (note how Sympy and the Ms handle this) is for something we know doesn't really behave well with respect to branch cuts etc., intentionally.  So no one should necessarily be using it for production symbolics, but rather really mostly just for classroom usage in situations (which are *legion*) where we have to explicitly exclude complex stuff.  Luckily for the logarithm this is a little easier to hide from the student, except for in an antiderivative of 1/x, but here it's not as "nice".


School math just works:

```

sage: g = f.diff()
sage: f.plot()

sage: g.plot()

* Do we want a latex method?  E.g. `latex_name=r"\mathrm{abs}"` used elsewhere in this file.  This is obviously not ideal:

```
sage: latex(F)
{\rm real}_{{\rm nth}_{{\rm root}}}\left(x, 5\right)
```
  But I'm not sure whether just using the usual root syntax is "correct" either since we have a different function now.  Using `abs(x)^(1/3)*sgn(x)` doesn't work for even `n`, else I'd recommend that for latex.
* Integration, perhaps surprisingly, works, as you mention [above](#comment%3A24):

```
sage: f = real_nth_root(x,3)
sage: f.diff()
1/3*real_nth_root(x^(-2), 3)
sage: f.integrate(x)
integrate(abs(x)^(1/3)*sgn(x), x)
sage: _.diff()
abs(x)^(1/3)*sgn(x)
```
  Apparently integration now tries Maxima, Giac, and then Sympy, so that explains it.  We should probably document this behavior.
* Upon further consideration, maybe the derivative can be a little better.  Because aren't we sort of assuming this is real input?  Maybe we aren't.  Here is Sympy.

```
>>> from sympy import root, real_root, Rational
>>> from sympy.abc import x, n
>>> real_root(x,5)
Piecewise((Abs(x)**(1/5)*sign(x), Eq(im(x), 0)), (x**(1/5), True))
>>> diff(real_root(x,5),x)
Piecewise((Abs(x)**(1/5)*Derivative(sign(x), x) + (re(x)*Derivative(re(x), x) + im(x)*Derivative(im(x), x))*sign(x)**2/(5*x*Abs(x)**(4/5)), Eq(im(x), 0)), (1/(5*x**(4/5)), True))
>>> x = Symbol('x', real=True)
>>> diff(real_root(x,5),x)
2*Abs(x)**(1/5)*DiracDelta(x) + sign(x)**2/(5*Abs(x)**(4/5))
```
  and here is Sage

```
sage: G = abs(x)^(1/5)*sgn(x)
sage: G
abs(x)^(1/5)*sgn(x)
sage: G.diff(x)
2*abs(x)^(1/5)*dirac_delta(x) + 1/10*(x + conjugate(x))*sgn(x)/abs(x)^(9/5)
sage: G.diff(x).simplify()
2*abs(x)^(1/5)*dirac_delta(x) + 1/5*x*sgn(x)/abs(x)^(9/5)
```
  at least

```
sage: assume(x,'real')
sage: F.diff(x)
1/5*real_nth_root(x^(-4), 5)
```
  should mimic this, if not perhaps always.   Any thoughts on this?
* To elaborate, Sympy's function somehow allows complex input, but do we want to?

```
sage: real_nth_root(3.*I,5)
1.18476052767182 + 0.384952030759866*I # should this happen?
```
  That's of course related to Nils question regarding negative input too.

```
sage: H = real_nth_root(x,2)
sage: (H.subs(x=-1))^2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
ValueError: no real nth root of negative real number with even n
sage: ((H)^2).subs(x=-1)
1
```
  I'm not sure the latter should be allowed or not.

I see `real_nth_root` as representing the real function x<sup>1/n</sup> with variable x taking real numbers (possibly negative for odd n). The latex print is for humans. So why not just print x<sup>1/n</sup>?

I don't get your concern. I think there is nothing wrong with

```
sage: f = real_nth_root(x,3)
sage: f.diff()
1/3*real_nth_root(x^(-2), 3)
```

No. `real_nth_root` takes real input and outputs real. For the symbolic function `1/x`, we assume `x` takes nonzero value. Likewise, we assume real value x for `real_nth_root(x, 3)`.

Thanks for all these fixes - we are converging :-)  Couple more questions/comments:

* I don't think you needed to make this one not tested; it should have passed fine.  Only the subsequent one would have thrown an error.

```diff

-    Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
+    sage: plot(real_nth_root(x, 3), (x, -1, 1))  # not tested
```

* latex:

  It's a little tricky, because the humans it is intended for might not realize it's not quite the same.  mjo or Nils, any thoughts?  I can go with it for now.

* calculus:

Thanks.  However, that brings up the related issue that the online documentation is only going to show the `_init_` method doc (and apparently not the tests?).  

  If you are up for it, I'd recommend making a more "narrative" structure which includes examples of calculus, plotting, etc., more like [real_part](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/functions/other.py?id=00380b09135e8171593108059f17490a23f554ad#n1208) does.  If you'd prefer me to do that, I can - might just take a little longer as I recall how to add to a public branch :-)

  If `n` is odd, though, `2*abs(x)^(1/5)*dirac_delta(x) + 1/5*x*sgn(x)/abs(x)^(9/5)` is somehow "better", and available.  Just thinking out loud; could be for a followup ticket.

  Wait, so are you saying that we should disallow that function with `x=-1` to be evaluated?  Because `1/x` blows up if we inject `x=0` - though then again Sage simplifies `1/x*x =1` which isn't technically correct.  Anyway, I think this is Nils' point.

We run into that same problem whenever we have a subclass method that does something different from its superclass method. I was only trying to clear up my previous suggestion. If the authors/reviewers don't think this is a good idea, feel free to ignore it.

I dunno. But until someone finds the existing methods lacking, adding them proactively just increases the chances that we'll have gotten it wrong when the need does arise.

Yes. What should `real_nth_root(-1, 2)` evaluate to?

Why is it not correct? It is correct but you should not evaluate 1/x at x=0.

I meant `((real_nth_root(x, 2))^2).subs(x=-1)`.  Are you saying this should be allowed or not allowed?

Depends on whether such expressions are meant to include domains - but anyway that is not directly relevant.

Again, see [comment:21](#comment%3A21).  It is good that `real_nth_root(-1, 2)` does not evaluate, but the question is whether the *symbolic* simplification should do this when `((real_nth_root(x, 2))^2)` doesn't really make sense for `x=-1`.  Here is another example.

```
sage: ((real_nth_root(x, 2))^2)
real_nth_root(x^2, 2)
sage: f(x) = _
sage: f
x |--> real_nth_root(x^2, 2)
sage: f(-1)
1
```
I think if in `_power_` we had something like

```
if exp % 2 == 1:
    return self(base**power_param, exp)
else:
 ....
```
that might solve it (suitable tests included).  What do you think?   Unfortunately the most naive things I tried for the `else` clause led to nasty errors; I wasted about 20 minutes on abort errors, so I have a feeling that what I did leads to Pynac problems.

Allowed. This is exactly the same problem with

```
sage: (1/x)*x
1
sage: _.subs(x=0)
1
```

which we don't bother to fix in any way. If you argue the cases are different because the difference of the domains of definition is of measure zero, then how about this:

```
sage: f = 1/floor(abs(x))*floor(abs(x))
sage: f.subs(x=1/2)
1
```

Perhaps it is important that these things do not cause real problems because the domain of definition never gets smaller from the initial domain of definition that one starts with.
