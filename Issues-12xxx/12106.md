Just a thought, but this would be a major step towards consolidating sage development into a small number of repositories, like how sage-on-gentoo has a single repository for all the ebuilds that do spkg installation, for example.

Looks good to me. 

Any further discussion about packaging should probably move to sage-devel or to a trac ticket once there is a concrete implementation. This ticket is mostly useful for testing, so lets leave it at that.

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
Don't have a gzip with --rsyncable on Gentoo :( 

A typo in sage-rsyncdist:

```
spkg/standard/atlas-3.8.4.spkg, there is a directory
spkg/standrd/atlas/ (note the directory has no version number).
```
it should be "spkg/standard" as well on the second line.
Still same file on line 44

```
if ! gzip --rsyncable </dev/null >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
```
Shouldn't there be some bracket somewhere?

I know, it's annoying this isn't in upstream gzip.

Thanks.

> Shouldn't there be some bracket somewhere?

No, brackets are for test operators, not for running executables, see
`help test`
in bash.
