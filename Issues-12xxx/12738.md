I took sage-5.0.beta9, replaced the ppl package by the one from #12672, added the cloog-ppl package from #12666, replaced the glpk package by the one from #12703, added a new libelf spkg, added the mpc and gcc spkgs from #12369 and modified the gcc spkg such that the gcc is built with support of loop optimization (graphite) and lto.

Then, I tried to build Sage with rather high optimization:

```
king@mpc622:/mnt/local/king/SAGE/testinggcc/lto/sage-5.0.beta9/spkg$ echo $CFLAGS
-O3 -march=native -floop-interchange -floop-strip-mine -floop-block -fno-strict-aliasing -flto
king@mpc622:/mnt/local/king/SAGE/testinggcc/lto/sage-5.0.beta9/spkg$ echo $CXXFLAGS
-O3 -march=native -floop-interchange -floop-strip-mine -floop-block -fno-strict-aliasing -flto
king@mpc622:/mnt/local/king/SAGE/testinggcc/lto/sage-5.0.beta9/spkg$ echo $LDFLAGS
-flto
```

Moreover, I attempted to build parallely (four threads).

However, Singular failed to build. Note that dropping -flto would enable to build Singular. Hence, the problem really seems to be -flto, whereas `make -j4` and `-march=native` and `-floop*` seems to be fine.

It seems to me that LDFLAGS is not correctly passed. Namely, in the [install log](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/SAGE/install_logs/singular-3-1-3-3.p6.log), I read

```
g++ -O3 -march=native -floop-interchange -floop-strip-mine -floop-block -fno-strict-aliasing -flto -O2 -g -fPIC -pipe  -fno-implicit-templates -I. -I.. -I/mnt/local/king/SAGE/testinggcc/lto/sage-5.0.bet

```
but

```
ld -shared -o p_Procs_FieldQ.sog p_Procs_Lib_FieldQ.dl_og
...
ld -shared -o p_Procs_FieldQ.so p_Procs_Lib_FieldQ.dl_o
```

Moreover, I see that libfac/Makefile.dist defines LDFLAGS empty

```
  LDFLAGS=
```
and defines

```
  LD = g++ $(ALLFLAGS)
```
where LDFLAGS does not appear in the definition of ALLFLAGS.

Then it would probably be fair to say that it is a problem with how I modified the GCC spkg, so that it supports graphite and lto in the first place. The diff with respect to the spkg from #12369 is

```diff
diff --git a/spkg-install b/spkg-install
--- a/spkg-install
+++ b/spkg-install
@@ -82,6 +82,8 @@
 ../src/configure \
     --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" \

     --with-system-zlib \
     --disable-multilib \
```

And of course I also added a libelf spkg (not published yet, but it is just upstream sources) and a cloog-ppl spkg (#12666).

Just for the record: Singular does build with the gcc from the modified spkg, as soon as one drops -flto, while -floop* is fine.

Nope, it was not.  But I can currently get around that bug by omitting `-fuse-linker-plugin` from `LDFLAGS`.

That only worked for me because I had built GCC 4.6.3 with older binutils, in particular GNU `ld` 2.20.*.

(If a plugin-capable linker is present during the build of GCC, you later don't have to specify `-fuse-linker-plugin` at all.)

Because dropping `-flto` shouldn't have any effect except that LTO simply won't happen.

Of course there are some other effects, e.g. regarding the size of the object files (and of course compile time), depending on *where* you drop it, if not everywhere.

`-flto` *during compilation* just prepares the generated object files for LTO (i.e., adds the extra information needed later); `-flto` during the link phase then triggers LTO.  If some object files or libraries lack the special sections needed, they're just excluded from LTO, as there's no information available on them.  This is very similar to compiling with `-g`, and later using the debugger.

I was not talking about "dropping -flto" but about modifying the Singular sources such that LDFLAGS is not overridden.
