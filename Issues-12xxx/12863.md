With a rather special polynomial of degree 32 with two roots of multiplicity 4, `roots()` dies with a PariError:

```
sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(ComplexField(2700), 1)
sage: p = (special polynomial)
sage: p.roots()
... correct output ...
sage: p.roots(ring=CDF)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PariError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
