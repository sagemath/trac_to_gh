With many datastructure for elements, comparison to zero could be faster than
comparison of two elements. The pythonic way to do that is to use indirectly
`e.__nonzero__()` for example in `if not e: ...`. However, to be able
to use consistently this idiom, we have to make sure that the return value of
`e == e.parent().zero()` agrees with `bool(e)`. The purpose of this
patch is to add this tests to the standard test suite and to fixe the Sage
library according to this policy.

On the way, I discovered that for a some morphism of modules, pickling can be
broken if the zero morphism is asked. I also fixes this issue.

See also discussion on #12508. Finally, I left to #12526 the question of removing `__nonzero__` from element and writing tuned implantation for all data structures.

Helloooooooo !!

Well, as far as I understand this code I think that it is good to go, except for this thing I just told you about : the new content of `QuotientRingElement.__nonzero__` creates this problem

```
sage: a = e.lift()
sage: any([e])
True
sage: b = e.lift()
# Now b and a are not necessarily equal anymore
```

If you think that this is not a problem after all, then you can set this ticket to `positive_review`.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnn !!

Nathann

The returned result was wrong so I switched back to raising not implemented. I created #13999 to have the problem fixed. Please review,
