With the attached patch, if you set `SAGE_CHECK=yes` and `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES='!python,!cvxopt'` and then build Sage, it will run self-tests for all packages except python and cvxopt.  By default, `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES=!python`.

This sort of behavior can be useful with the current situation, in which python always fails self-tests (as far as I know), and a package like cvxopt fails them on OS X Lion.  So when I'm testing Sage with Lion, I could use `'!python,!cvxopt'` and easily run self-tests on all of the other packages. This should be viewed as merely a convenience — I hope that people straighten out Python's test suite in general and cvxopt on Lion — but it might be a useful option.

Example:

would **always** check mpir and mpfr, regardless of `SAGE_CHECK` but would **never** check python, regardless of `SAGE_CHECK`.

The default should be

```
SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES="!python"
```

Yes, this is more or less what I had in mind.  Two small comments:

The lines

```
SAGE_CHECK=no
export SAGE_CHECK
```
can be simplified to

```
export SAGE_CHECK=no
```

I don't know about the portability of expr, I would use `grep` instead.  Also you don't want to match "gdmodule" when "gd" is in `$SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES`.  Proposal:

```
# Allow spaces, commas or colons as separator (the documentation suggests commas)
if echo ",$SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES," | grep "[ ,:]\!$PKG_BASE[ ,:]" >/dev/null; then
    export SAGE_CHECK=no
elif echo ",$SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES," | grep "[ ,:]$PKG_BASE[ ,:]" >/dev/null; then
    export SAGE_CHECK=yes
fi
