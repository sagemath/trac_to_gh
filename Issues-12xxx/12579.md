The default should be

```

Yes, this is more or less what I had in mind.  Two small comments:

The lines

```
SAGE_CHECK=no
export SAGE_CHECK
```
can be simplified to

```
export SAGE_CHECK=no
```

I don't know about the portability of expr, I would use `grep` instead.  Also you don't want to match "gdmodule" when "gd" is in `$SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES`.  Proposal:

```
# Allow spaces, commas or colons as separator (the documentation suggests commas)
if echo ",$SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES," | grep "[ ,:]\!$PKG_BASE[ ,:]" >/dev/null; then
    export SAGE_CHECK=no
elif echo ",$SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES," | grep "[ ,:]$PKG_BASE[ ,:]" >/dev/null; then
    export SAGE_CHECK=yes
