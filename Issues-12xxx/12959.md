Implement default methods for (With)Realizations that use the realization provided by the method a_realization for computations:

- `AlgebrasWithBasis.ParentMethods.product` is modified to use
  product_by_coercion if `product_on_basis` is not available
- `Magmas.Realizations` added and
  `Magmas.Realizations.ParentMethods.product_by_coercion` uses
  `self.a_realization()`
- `CommutativeAdditiveMonoids.WithRealizations` added and
  `CommutativeAdditiveMonoids.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.zero`
  returns `self.a_realization().zero()`
- `Monoids.WithRealizations` added and `Monoids.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.one`
  returns `self.a_realization().one()`
- `Sets.WithRealizations.ParentMethods.inject_shorthands` : injects any
  shorthands names for realizations provided in the `_shorthands` attribute
- added `_shorthand` attribute to the example in
  `sage.categories.example.with_realizations`

And update `examples/with_realizations.py` accordingly.

There was a question mark at the end of the FIXME; so this was to be discussed! Oh well, since it's merged in, I guess we can just consider the discussion as closed.
