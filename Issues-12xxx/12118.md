The build of `libgpg_error` can fail due to a race condition.  This has been seen on Mac OS X and Linux.

The attached log file (from a sage-4.8.alpha3 build) shows that the spkg `libgpg_error-1.6.p3` blows up because it tries to make a directory that already exists.  The problem seems to be a broken `install-sh` script.

I changed this to "needs work" since it, well, needs work.  Not quite sure why it worked in the past, but it doesn't do the job now.

Also, a response from upstream: "The current version is 1.1.0.  Please test again with that one."  I don't understand the numbering scheme, but I'll fool around with "the current version".  Anyone know why this would be A Bad Idea?

<div id="comment:21" align="right">Comment 21</div>

Grumble...I took the p5 .spkg, enabled 'x' mode for install-sh, re-tarred, copied it into a fresh 4.8-a4 tree.  The build still blows up, and install-sh is no longer executable.  Is this something that has to be done in "spkg-install"?

Note: I've verified that the tarball in spkg/standard has an executable "install-sh", but the one in spkg/build does not.

First, be sure to double-check that you really have the newly updated spkg.

Could you please go into the `build` directory and do

```
ls -l . src patches

Ah...light dawns...new knowledge awaits in the new day.

So: 'patches/install-sh' was *not* executable.  Making it so caused the build to continue chugging past the libgpg-error spkg.  It continues to chug.

Thanks for the pointers, Jeroen.
