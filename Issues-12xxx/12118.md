The build of `libgpg_error` can fail due to a race condition.  This has been seen on Mac OS X and Linux.

The attached log file (from a sage-4.8.alpha3 build) shows that the spkg `libgpg_error-1.6.p3` blows up because it tries to make a directory that already exists.  The problem seems to be a broken `install-sh` script.

Second, after checking on the upstream website, I saw that my email had not yet appeared.  I bit the bullet and joined up and resent my email today.  The email made it to the archives; we'll see what happens.
