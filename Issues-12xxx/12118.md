The build of `libgpg_error` can fail due to a race condition.  This has been seen on Mac OS X and Linux.

The attached log file (from a sage-4.8.alpha3 build) shows that the spkg `libgpg_error-1.6.p3` blows up because it tries to make a directory that already exists.  The problem seems to be a broken `install-sh` script.

First, be sure to double-check that you really have the newly updated spkg.

Could you please go into the `build` directory and do

```
ls -l . src patches
```

Next, what happens if you untar the tarball by hand and then do

```
ls -l . src patches
```

Ah...light dawns...new knowledge awaits in the new day.

So: 'patches/install-sh' was *not* executable.  Making it so caused the build to continue chugging past the libgpg-error spkg.  It continues to chug.

Thanks for the pointers, Jeroen.
