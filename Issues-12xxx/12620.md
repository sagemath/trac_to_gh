- the default color is "red", but it should be the same as for all other plots (i.e., that blueish).   

- The docstring also has this line:

```
        -  ``color`` - a word that describes a color
```
Yes, you can use a string to describe a color, but there are many other ways.  change this to be the same as for other commands.

There are all kinds of other problems in shapes2.py and shapes.pyx along these lines.  For instance, the `Box` command claims its default is black, but it is indeed blue, while pretty much every command in shapes2 has the same line as this docstring.  

I suggest that the following very minimalist patch be done here, and that another ticket be opened for fixing all that doc.  What do others think?

I looked into adding a doctest that checks the color of the bezier spline against e.g. plot(sin(x)). You have to do enough gymnastics that I don't think it's worth it for this obviously-correct change.

If we wanted to do that, I think it would make sense to create a separate unit test checking that all plotting commands use the same default color, so that we don't have 297592 tests to make sure things are blue.

Anyway, we should open another ticket to fix those docstrings.
