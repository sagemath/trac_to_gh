- the default color is "red", but it should be the same as for all other plots (i.e., that blueish).   

- The docstring also has this line:

```
        -  ``color`` - a word that describes a color
```
Yes, you can use a string to describe a color, but there are many other ways.  change this to be the same as for other commands.
