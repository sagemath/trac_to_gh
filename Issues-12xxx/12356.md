In sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/cm.py there is a list of imaginary quadratic orders with class number 2, introduced in #11220, but it is incomplete!  Firstly, discriminant -72 is missing since the paper referred to omitted it in error; secondly, all 9 such orders whose maximal order has class number 1 were omitted by mistake.

The original patch (by JEC) adds the missing cases and adjusts the doctests (all for Q(sqrt(5)) whose output is now different as more cases are included.  The later patches (by WAS) which are independent, do much much more, handling all class numbers up to 100.

Apply [attachment:trac_12356-cm-rebase-sage5.0.patch] and [attachment:trac_12356-cm-review.patch]

<a id='comment:5'></a>John Cremona found a mistake in my algorithm, which I've addressed via a new patch.

I've written a new version based on some of Cremona's comments and with a big comment explaining what I'm doing.    Basically I just compute a pessimistic bound on the quotient (as you suggest) by applying a "big theorem" (probably from Hardy & Wright) bounding phi from below, and noting that phi_D(f) >= phi(f).   The new code seems to work fine (and even found a class number 8 counterexample to the code I posted) and is pretty fast, but of course has plenty of room for optimization and improvement by your student, who could also run it to make tables, etc. 

Of course, I very much hope John will extremely critically review this!

I didn't mention it, but the *reason* I wrote this code was not to scoop your student or something -- it was so I could better referee your patch!

In this case I had been typing into this box, then clicked to upload a patch, after which the text had gone.  So here's what the reviewer patch does:\n\n1. trivial fixes to docstrings to keep Sphinx happy and tidy up\n\n2. small change to code.  There is a factor in the formula which is usually 1 but can be 2 or 3 and the factor is in the denominator so cannot be ignored without risking losing solutions.

<a id='comment:9'></a>After all these years I still manage to lose large chunks of texts right after typing them.  In this case I had been typing into this box, then clicked to upload a patch, after which the text had gone.  So here's what the reviewer patch does:

1. trivial fixes to docstrings to keep Sphinx happy and tidy up

2. small change to code.  There is a factor in the formula which is usually 1 but can be 2 or 3 and the factor is in the denominator so cannot be ignored without risking losing solutions.  I have inserted it, though I did not come up with any case in which this would actually cause an error.

I also have several suggestions for making the new code more efficient, but it is fine for small h and the new code replaces *wrong* code for h=2 which did not work at all for h>2, so the efficiency question can be dealt with on a separate ticket.

I give a positive review apart from the issue in #2 above, so if William agrees with my change we can together give an overall positive review; or ask a 3rd party.
