There are some files in Sage where doctesting that file can take more than a minute.  It would be nice to be able to take advantage of multiple cores when making changes to such a file.

In order to allow parallel doctesting to succeed, #12721 is needed.  But adding the option to the doctest module doesn't depend on #12721 being resolved.

Depends on #9461

Component: **doctest framework**

The advantage is if you're making changes to one file that takes 60 seconds to doctest, it's nice to have the turnaround time faster.

I agree that it's not a big benefit, and I don't really mind closing it as wontfix given the additional complexity in the doctesting framework.  But there is a benefit for users (especially new ones) who are just editing one file.
