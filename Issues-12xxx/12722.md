There are some files in Sage where doctesting that file can take more than a minute.  It would be nice to be able to take advantage of multiple cores when making changes to such a file.

In order to allow parallel doctesting to succeed, #12721 is needed.  But adding the option to the doctest module doesn't depend on #12721 being resolved.

Depends on #9461

I don't really see the advantage of being able to do this. This will just add another layer of complexity to the doctesting framework for a small advantage. And I think even #12721 will already be difficult to fix.

The advantage is if you're making changes to one file that takes 60 seconds to doctest, it's nice to have the turnaround time faster.

I agree that it's not a big benefit, and I don't really mind closing it as wontfix given the additional complexity in the doctesting framework.  But there is a benefit for users (especially new ones) who are just editing one file.

Sure.  I think it's doable but I don't care enough to do it.  :-)
