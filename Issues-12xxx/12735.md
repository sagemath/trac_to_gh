mhansen -- you are right -- this has nothing to do with Magma, a priori.   I'll change the title of the ticket.    It's a bug in the doctest framework, but I don't yet know how to trigger it.  I just looked through the relevant code in sage-doctest, and it's a mix of code I wrote and then later Robert Bradshaw extended with a "tolerance" ability.
