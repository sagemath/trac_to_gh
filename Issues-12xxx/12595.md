```
Sage seems to return the complex conjugate of `d` or something of the sort. Perhaps `d` is simply wrongly permuted (but real eigenvalues seem to be correct).

`p.inverse() * d * p` should be at least approximately equal to `m`.

sage: M = [[1,-1],[1, 1]]
sage: rings = SR, ZZ, QQ, RDF, CDF
sage: for ring in rings:

I think this is no longer a problem 

```
sage: m = Matrix(CDF, 8, [[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -3, -1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -3], [-1, 3, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, 3, 1, 1, -1, -1], [1, 1, -3, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -3, 1], [3, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, -1, 1, 1]])
sage: d, p = m.eigenmatrix_left()
sage: norm(p.inverse() * d * p - m)
8.505150621424852e-15
```


The answer for the norm is now close enough to `0` so probably the underlying issue has been resolved.

Just added 

The doctest tests if it is within 10^(-12) 

That precision has been chosen arbitrarily. 

I hope this suffices.

Comments:

- the commit message has "elgenmatrix" for "eigenmatrix"
- several lines have trailing white space, please remove it
- remove the blank line at the end of the docstring,
  between the test and the closing `"""`
- the line "The following ... resolved" should end with `::`
  to actually get tested
- please use `1e-12` instead of `10^-12` here
- the example input could be wrapped as follows

```diff
            sage: m = Matrix(CDF, 8, [[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -3, -1, -1],
            ....:                     [1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -3],
            ....:                     [-1, 3, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1],
            ....:                     [-1, -1, -1, 3, 1, 1, -1, -1],
            ....:                     [1, 1, -3, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1],
            ....:                     [1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -3, 1],
            ....:                     [3, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1],
            ....:                     [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, -1, 1, 1]])
```

- Finally, I think splitting the last input line as follows
  would make the test even clearer:

```
            sage: mm = p.inverse() * d * p  # equals `m` up to numerical noise
            sage: (mm - m).norm() < 1e-12
```

Can you take all these comments into account and send a new commit?
You can force-push to replace the previous commit.
