```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(j=GF(7)(0))
sage: phi = EllipticCurveIsogeny(E, [E(0), E((0,1)), E((0,-1))])
sage: phi.parent()

sage: phi.parent().domain()

I have used elliptic curve isogenies a huge amount and this has never bothered me, presumably because it never occurred to me to ask for the parent of an isogeny.  If anyone wants to change this without breaking anything they are welcome, but I don't care very much.

The only problem is that this breaks testing for equality of isogenies, due to #11474.  Suppose `E -> E1` is an isogeny and `E2` is an elliptic curve that is equal but not *identical* to `E1`.  Then `Hom(E, E1)` and `Hom(E, E2)` will also be equal but not identical; since the coercion model assumes uniqueness of parents, it will never regard corresponding elements of `Hom(E, E1)` and `Hom(E, E2)` as equal.

For some reason the Hom sets between the groups of points, on the other hand, *are* identical, which explains why equality testing currently is not broken.

Wow. It's so cool to be finally able to compose isogenies!

There's various doctests failing in `ell_curve_isogeny.py`. Most of them are because of #11474, so they should be ok once that one's fixed. However there's one weird failure, not sure if it depends on #11474 too:

Replying to [sbesnier](#comment%3A10):
> I've also make some modifications in order to make the composition working (essentially, remove the overload of `_composition_').

This looks good to me overall.  The main thing I am wondering about is if it wouldn't make sense to keep the current version of `_composition_` (raise a `NotImplementedError`) until we have real composition of isogenies.  What I mean is that with your change, we just get a "formal" composition of two isogenies.  Although this may be good enough for some applications, what we really want is to compute the actual polynomials defining the composed isogeny.  From that perspective I wouldn't say that removing the method "makes composition work".

The question is whether it is worth having a "formal" composition in the (hopefully short!) time interval until we have "flesh-and-blood" composition of isogenies.  In other words, wouldn't it be reasonable to just make the following doctest change instead of removing the `_composition_()` method?

I'd rather say the opposite. There are applications where formal composition is the desired result.

Formal composition is essentially free, while "flesh-and-blood" composition may be expensive (exponential in the length of the chain). There are cryptosystems that exploit this fact, Sage should make it easy to implement them in a few lines of code.

I'm more in favour of using formal composition by default, and having a method (`.normalize()`, maybe?) to compute the "flesh-and-blood" version. Subsidiary question : what should equality do in this case?

There are two similarly named branches on trac: `u/sbesnier/ticket/12880` and `u/sbesnier/ticket12880`. Maybe you wanted the second one (change the 'branch' field in this case).

A few small stylistic comments about docstrings:
- To refer to Trac tickets, use the syntax `:trac:`12880`` (in the HTML documentation, this is expanded to "Trac ticket 12880" and becomes a link).
- Usually `TESTS:` or `TESTS::` is kept on a line by itself and, if relevant, there is a separate line of explanation referring to the specific issue, i.e. one of the following:

```
TESTS::

    sage: 2 + 2
    4

----

TESTS:

Check that `2 + 2 = 4` (see :trac:`12880`)::

    sage: 2 + 2
    4
```
- In English, unlike in French, there is no space before the punctuation marks : ; ? !
