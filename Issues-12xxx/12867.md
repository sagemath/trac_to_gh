Well, what about raising an exception saying that there is no uniform distribution on this set ?...

Honestly, computing random words through `__random_element_from_unrank` really is a joke....

<a id='comment:8'></a>I fixed this, as well as the broken doctests reported by the patchbot in `sage/categories/modules_with_basis.py` and `sage/algebras/shuffle_algebra.py`.

The first one has been fixed with Darij's help : turns out that Sage's example of a free algebra was not a free algebra (see [1]).

The second one has been fixed by building manually an element of a Shuffle Algebra instead of relying on `an_element()`, which always returns 0.

Patch updated (and rebased)

<a id='comment:16'></a>Hi there,

Suggestions, tasks and questions:

0) Might be rebased for 6.2.rc0

1) Add doctest for your errors

2) The following code

```
self((self.alphabet()[randint(0,n-1)] for x in range(self._length)))
```
does not handle all cases. For example

```
sage: W = Words(GF(5), length=4)
sage: W.random_element()
KABOOM
```
The problem is that you really do not know what is the `__getitem__` there. A possibility is

```
self((self.alphabet().random_element() for _ in range(self._length)))
```

3) What is the purpose of the commit 241a151def174f9cfa93340fd3dd2a9be1d4aa81 that modifies stuff in shuffle_algebra.py, algebras_with_basis.py, lyndon_word.py, etc?

Officially, it is to fix a bug because the current status is incorrect. I asked around and it turns out that these things are only defined on finite words.

Done, but there was no conflict with 6.2.rc0....

Well, this is in the branch

```
+            sage: W = Words(5)
+            sage: W.random_element() # random
```

What else do you expect to find ?

Well, a list has no `.random_element()` method. Would that work ?

Otherwise we could call `list(self.alphabet())`. Or make sure self.alphabet() is a list. What do you think ?

> 3) What is the purpose of the commit 241a151def174f9cfa93340fd3dd2a9be1d4aa81 that modifies stuff in shuffle_algebra.py, algebras_with_basis.py, lyndon_word.py, etc?


HMmmmmm... Officially, it is to fix a bug because the current status is incorrect. I asked around and it turns out that these things are only defined on finite words. I don't even know what they are, but doctests were broken otherwise. So well. Everybody's happy this way `:-P`
