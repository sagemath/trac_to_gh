In #12055 (replaced by #7071) Volker made several copies of PALP for working with different dimensions. This patch exposes this functionality in Sage.

No attempt is made so far to pick the appropriate dimension automatically, since it is not entirely trivial and can have unpleasant consequences (some of the PALP other limits change automatically with dimension). However users can call `lattice_polytope.set_palp_dimension` function to make a global choice for their session.

For the record, I'm writing

* Support for accessing the PALP database files through cws.x though an iterator with customizable polytope class as output
I do have it working but I need to clean up the patches. The current state is as always on my bitbucket repo:
