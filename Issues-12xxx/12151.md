<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

This can be fixed by changing

```
for P, _ in K.ideal(a.denominator()).factor():
```
on line 564 of ell_number_field.py to

```
for P in [P for P,e in K.ideal(a).factor() if e<0]:
```
or alternatively (I think)

```
for P, _ in a.denominator_ideal().factor():
```
I checked that the first alternative works.

NB I also think that the line

```
pi = K.uniformizer(P,'positive')
```
should be 

```
pi = K.uniformizer(P,'negative')
```
since we will divide by a power of pi and want to make sure that the model stays integral at other primes.  This does not matter in the example given where the class number is 1 so each pi will be an actual generator of the prime ideal.
