This ticket uses coercion to find suitable parents for the arguments to `Matrix.solve_right` in order to solve these problems:

```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, 2, [1, 2 ,3, 4])
sage: b = vector(RDF, [pi, e]); b
(3.14159265359, 2.71828182846)
sage: A.solve_right(b)   # should return (-3.564903478720541, 3.353248066155167)
(-27594871646705519/7740706532848242, 17304339474632025/5160471021898828)
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: b = vector(R, [1, x]); b
(1, x)
sage: A.solve_right(b)   # should return (t - 2, -1/2*t + 3/2)
[ugly traceback]
TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```

This is implemented by moving the coercion code from `Matrix_double_dense.solve_right`, that was implemented in #17405, to the super class. As a result, `Matrix_double_dense.solve_right` is redundant and therefore removed.

The super method `Matrix.solve_right` is refactored a lot:

- the `check` parameter is ignored for inexact rings (see also #13932)
- the implementation is changed so that the rank of the matrix is not computed in `solve_right`, but only in `_solve_right_nonsingular_square`; this way, inexact rings overwriting the latter method can avoid computing the rank (which would not work over inexact rings)

Additionally, this ticket adds support for calling `solve_right`/`solve_left` with non-square matrices over `RDF`/`CDF`. In such cases, `solve_right` returns the least-squares solution of the equation system, similar to the !Matlab/Octave backslash operator (which our documentation already claims is implemented). This is implemented using [scipy.linalg.lstsq](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.lstsq.html).

```
sage: A = matrix(RDF, 3, 2, [1, 3, 4, 2, 0, -3])
sage: b = vector(RDF, [5, 6, 1])
sage: x = A.solve_right(b)
sage: (A * x - b).norm()
3.2692119900020438
sage: x == A \ b
True
```

The failing test involved a `solve_right` operation between a matrix over `AA` and a vector over `QuadraticField(2)`. The latter does not coerce into `AA`, so this is solved by explicitly converting the entries of the vector to `AA`.

This looks like a nice improvement, thanks.

Pet peeve: these docstrings don't say what we're solving for:

> Compute a solution to the equation `A X = B`

The next line introduces `A`, but we can make it a tiny bit better IMO by saying something like

> Compute one solution `X` to the equation `A X = B`

or

> Try to find a solution `X` to the system `A X = B`

Those additionally imply that only one solution is returned, whereas "solve..." to me suggests that maybe an entire subspace (or a matrix whose columns form a basis for a subspace) is returned. For example, solving `0 X = 0` returns `(0,0,0)`, which is not worth full credit =)

I'm rebuilding sage for another ticket right now but I'll take a closer look at this soon.

At a high level, this looks like the right approach to me. The double_dense matrices are the only ones that override the solve_left and solve_right methods, so moving the coercion up and refactoring is what I would have done too. As a result, I only found some minor issues.

Fixes that I think will be uncontroversial:

1. When writing norms in the docstrings, a backslash is needed before the pipe:

  ```
  -        solution of the equation, such that the 2-norm `|A x - b|`
  +        solution of the equation, such that the 2-norm `\|A x - b\|`
   ```

2. The new error message "ValueError: number of rows of self must equal degree of B" uses the wrong variable name (capital `B` versus `b`), and doesn't make sense when `b` is a matrix (and has no degree).

3. Instead of indirect doctests like

  ```
  sage: x = A.solve_right(b)  # indirect doctest
   ```
   you can use direct ones like

  ```
  sage: x = A._solve_right_nonsingular_square(b)
   ```
   That avoids the potential problem where some superclass behavior changes, and the indirect doctest no longer checks what we think it checks.

4. The recursive call to e.g. solve_right in

  ```
  return A.solve_right(B, check=check)
   ```
   is elegant, but is probably inefficient because Python doesn't make much effort to optimize recursive calls (see e.g. http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/final-words-on-tail-calls.html). In this case, I think you can set `A = self` at the top of the function, and just let that case fall through. The rest of the function would have to be updated to use `A` instead of `self`, though.

Other suggestions:

1. I think it's easier for non-native speakers if you write out "that is" or "in other words" instead of "i.e."
2. In the example "Over inexact rings, the output of this function may not be an exact solution...",  we could compare the answer to the closed-form solution of least squares, to convince the reader that it really gives a least-squares solution:

  ```
  sage: A.solve_right(b)
  (1.4782608695652177, 0.35177865612648235)
  sage: ~(A.T*A)*A.T*b # closed form
  (1.478260869565217, 0.351778656126482)
   ```
3. I think a tolerance of `1e-14` is probably pushing our luck -- Sage is built on a lot of unusual hardware. NumPy itself uses something a bit more clever, but for example, its default absolute tolerance is 1e-8. Ultimately, this probably doesn't matter, since we can always make the tolerance bigger if the tests fail on someone's machine.
4. The code that checks to see if we need to change rings...

  ```
  if L is not P:
    B = B.change_ring(P)
  if K is not P:
    A = self.change_ring(P)
   ```
   may be redundant, since the first thing `change_ring` does is check to see if it can do nothing. However, avoiding the method call entirely may improve performance a tiny bit.
5. The docstrings for the dense matrices use lowercase `x` and `b`, unlike the generic classes.

Miscellaneous:

1. The "\ZZ" doesn't look right to me in the HTML documentation, but this is a wider problem and not just in your changes. It renders as a bright red, literal "\ZZ" for me, which looks especially weird when `\ZZ/n\ZZ` renders just like that.

Only for immutable matrices, `change_ring` with identical rings is a no-op – otherwise, a copy is returned.

The argument for `Matrix_double_dense.solve_right` is called `b` rather than `B`. Changing it would not strictly be backward compatible, so I avoided renaming it, despite the inconsistency with the super method.

I am not sure what could be causing this problem. On my end, it renders correctly as a bold Z.

Sure, but without the TCO it keeps another stack frame around for the entire method call. This isn't a big deal in 2020, but since solving O(10000) linear systems is common even in "small" homework exercises, we might as well take the free lunch. It should even simplify the code, now that I have remembered that `self` isn't magic in python and is just a normal local variable. And another tiny improvement would make this slightly more beneficial:

First, how about we move the check on the dimensions of `B` to the top? There's no point in finding a common parent ring if the method is going to raise an error anyway. That is,

```
b_is_vec = is_Vector(B)
if b_is_vec:
    if self.nrows() != B.degree():
        raise ValueError("...")
else:
    if self.nrows() != B.nrows():
        raise ValueError("...")

(rest of method)
```

Then, my idea was to replace

```
A = self.change_ring(P)
return A.solve_right(B, check=check)
```

by

```
self = self.change_ring(P)
```

Afterwards, the method proceeds normally, but with a matrix `self` that has a compatible ring. That's what the recursive call would ultimately have done anyway.

That will skip the extra method call, skip the checks on the dimensions of `B` (if you move them to the top), and skip a redundant check for the compatibility of base rings. Since it deletes a line and gives us a tiny performance benefit, we might as well take it, right?

This is not equivalent, as it conflicts with subclasses overwriting `solve_right`. I have added a doctest where this makes a difference:

```
sage: A = matrix(ZZ, [[1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 2], [3, 2, 5]])
sage: b = vector(RDF, [1, 1, 1])
```
Now the following should be equal, but this would fail with the changes you suggested:

```
sage: A.solve_right(b) == A.change_ring(RDF).solve_right(b)
...
True
```
Here, `A` is of type `Matrix_integer_dense`, but `A.change_ring(RDF)` is of type `Matrix_double_dense`. The latter class overwrites `solve_right`, so we must call `Matrix_double_dense.solve_right` of the subclass after changing rings, instead of continuing execute the code from the super class.

The coercion code can be thought of as a normalization procedure of the arguments before executing the main part of the method. It could be refactored into a decorator for matrix/vector operations, very similar to [coerce_binop](https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/-/blob/9.1.beta6/src/sage/structure/element.pyx#L4297-4307). Note that the `coerce_binop` decorator also uses method resolution to call the correct method implementation after coercing the arguments, rather than invoking the given method directly.

```
            a, b = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(self, other)
            if a is self:
                return method(a, b, *args, **kwargs)
            else:
                return getattr(a, method.__name__)(b, *args, **kwargs)
```

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:20'></a>\nAll other concerns aside, we should now move the `self.rank()` computation up before the coercion.

In your branch, both sides produce the same wrong answer =)\n\nUnless we can make it produce the correct answer starting from RDF, I don't think we should add a doctest that ensures wrong answers in both cases! What's happening is that the matrix\n\n```\nA = matrix(ZZ, [[1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 2], [3, 2, 5]])\n```\n\nis singular (by inspection), so it should wind up using the generic solve method that uses least squares. However, in your branch, the subclass method calls the superclass method with `check=False`, so when we get to the line\n\n```\nif not self.is_square() or ((check or K.is_exact())\n                            and self.rank() != self.nrows()):\n```\n\nthe \"if\" fails, and we try to solve the system as if `A` was nonsingular, and it isn't. So, you get a junk answer, whereas with least squares, you get a decent one. With my suggestion, the subclass method is skipped entirely, causing `check=True`  by default. This is wrong in that we shouldn't bypass subclass methods if they exist, but I'm not 100% sure that it's wrong in this case when the sole purpose of the subclass method is to set `check=False`. The more I think about this, the more nonsensical it seems to me to have a `check` parameter in the first place when least squares can be used as in the MATLAB backslash operator.\n\nI'm not expecting you to fix a decade old broken API... I'm just trying to be thorough and don't want to make things worse. What's the reasoning behind setting `check=False` in the subclass method, and behind adding the `check` variable to this condition?\n\n```\nif not self.is_square() or ((check or K.is_exact())\n                            and self.rank() != self.nrows()):\n```\n\nA priori, it's weird to have a `check` parameter change the answer, and setting it to false in the subclass method means that the generic solve will never get used for square RDF matrices, even if they're singular(ish). I'm only guessing at the implementation details in scipy, but it looks like the least squares approach is better for matrices that are almost singular. Particularly if we compute the rank before coercing, I think we should trust the fact that (rank < rows) and use least squares in that case.",

All other concerns aside, we should now move the `self.rank()` computation up before the coercion. Rank computations in Sage aren't numerically stable, and while that's a bug, it's been around for 10+ years. For example:

```
age: A = matrix(ZZ, [ [3,5], [30,50] ])
sage: A.rank()
1
sage: C = A.change_ring(RDF)
sage: C.rank()
2
sage: A == C
True
```

So, we should use the most exact ring possible to compute the rank of `self` in

```
if not self.is_square() or ((check or K.is_exact())
                            and self.rank() != self.nrows()):
```

Otherwise, we risk choosing the wrong branch.

I also think we should change...

```
if K not in _Fields:
    K = K.fraction_field()
    self = self.change_ring(K)
```

to

```
if K not in _Fields:
    K = K.fraction_field()
    self = self.change_ring(K)
    B = B.change_ring(K)
```

for consistency, so that we always call either `_solve_right_general` or `_solve_right_nonsingular_square` with arguments that have the same base ring.

Finally, I get where you're going with this...

```
sage: A.solve_right(b) == A.change_ring(RDF).solve_right(b)
True
```

but the reason it fails with my suggested changes is because one side produces the correct answer with my suggested changes. In your branch, both sides produce the same wrong answer =)

Unless we can make it produce the correct answer starting from RDF, I don't think we should add a doctest that ensures wrong answers in both cases! What's happening is that the matrix

```
A = matrix(ZZ, [[1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 2], [3, 2, 5]])
```

is singular (by inspection), so it should wind up using the generic solve method that uses least squares. However, in your branch, the subclass method calls the superclass method with `check=False`, so when we get to the line

```
if not self.is_square() or ((check or K.is_exact())
                            and self.rank() != self.nrows()):
```

the "if" fails, and we try to solve the system as if `A` was nonsingular, and it isn't. So, you get a junk answer, whereas with least squares, you get a decent one. With my suggestion, the subclass method is skipped entirely, causing `check=True`  by default. This is wrong in that we shouldn't bypass subclass methods if they exist, but I'm not 100% sure that it's wrong in this case when the sole purpose of the subclass method is to set `check=False`. The more I think about this, the more nonsensical it seems to me to have a `check` parameter in the first place when least squares can be used as in the MATLAB backslash operator.

I'm not expecting you to fix a decade old broken API... I'm just trying to be thorough and don't want to make things worse. What's the reasoning behind setting `check=False` in the subclass method, and behind adding the `check` variable to this condition?

```
if not self.is_square() or ((check or K.is_exact())
                            and self.rank() != self.nrows()):
```

A priori, it's weird to have a `check` parameter change the answer, and setting it to false in the subclass method means that the generic solve will never get used for square RDF matrices, even if they're singular(ish). I'm only guessing at the implementation details in scipy, but it looks like the least squares approach is better for matrices that are almost singular. Particularly if we compute the rank before coercing, I think we should trust the fact that (rank < rows) and use least squares in that case.

Scratch that, I see that the generic matrix code disagreed with its documentation all along. The MATLAB backslash operator doesn't check the rank, it only looks at the dimensions and does a QR solve regardless of the rank for a non-square matrix. It insists that square systems actually be solvable. So I would expect an error from `A = matrix(ZZ, [[1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 2], [3, 2, 5]])`, if we really implemented the backslash properly. But we don't, because the `check` parameter directly contradicts it. This is a nightmare!

Ok, I finally have my head wrapped around this.

The behavior promised by the `solve_right()` method is just fundamentally incompatible with inexact rings, and also with the promise that it makes to implement the MATLAB backslash operator. The existing code uses the "general" solver for rank-deficient matrices, which isn't how the MATLAB backslash works. That behavior is documented and doctested throughout sage, so it's difficult to change.

In hindsight, the reason for setting `check=False` and adding the `(check or K.is_exact())` condition is clear: it let's you implement the backslash operator correctly for RDF and CDF matrices by hacking the superclass method to choose the "wrong" branch. Normally I would say this is a horrendous design, but you can only work with what you're given.

I made a post to the -devel list asking about the behavior of `solve_right`, but I don't expect to get an easy answer (if this was fun/easy to fix, it wouldn't look like this). It's apparent that to truly make everything consistent, we will have to change either the superclass documentation or its implementation. And changing the implementation (for ALL matrices) at this point is more than either of us have bargained for.

So, here's the best solution that I was able to come up with. Instead of changing the superclass implementation, we change the documentation to admit that (a) we don't really implement the backslash the way MATLAB does, specifically with respect to rank-deficient matrices; and (b) the `check` parameter will not be used over inexact rings. Item (a) is a given in the superclass, and I think (b) is justified because all solutions are approximate over inexact rings. Propagating item (a) into the matrix_double_dense subclass is a "breaking" change, but one that seems only to improve the answers we get.

Here's the summary:

1. At the beginning of Matrix.solve_right, we set `check=False` whenever the ring is inexact.
2. Since `check` is now False for RDF/CDF matrices, there's no reason for the subclass methods to force `check=False`, and therefore no reason for the subclass methods at all! We can drop them and move the documentation/examples into the superclass, to eliminate all of the weirdness that results from having two different sets of documentation on classes that silently convert into one another.
3. The coercion and everything else proceeds basically as you had it, except without calling `solve_right` again, because now there is no subclass method to call.
4. Instead of hacking the "if" statement to use the square-nonsingular solve for all square RDF/CDF matrices, we leave the logic alone and let sage choose to use least squares in that case. This breaks some doctests, but in reality it improves many of the answers. Some LinAlgErrors become near-solutions, and some ill-conditioned systems produce much better solutions this way.

This doesn't attempt to implement the backslash exactly, but it does solve systems in a consistent(ish) manner regardless of whether or not the ring is exact. It also passes all of the doctests that don't refer specifically to the behavior that was changed on purpose.

I've pushed a branch so you can see my proof-of-concept:

https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/d59671100187b42c112f9a89c058dc6cbd1e4543

Please, take a look and see what you think. If you think it's a better approach, we can clean it up. If not... I tried. I'll give this a positive review if you prefer the original approach.

A couple of other thoughts:

I still think it would be cleaner to call `solve_right` again after coercion, even if no subclass overwrites it, as I do not think there is much practical relevance for saving a stack frame. The main reason for calling `solve_right` again is that this is closer to how coercion is usually used in Sage (which is also relevant for the next point), but I will not insist on this if indeed we remove the subclass method.

Indeed, this would be better for the rank computation, but it is different from how the coercion system usually works in Sage, so could lead to unexpected results. To the best of my knowledge, usually, the coercion system first searches for a common parent of two operands and only then invokes the appropriate binary operation on them. This is why the doctest

```
A.solve_right(b) == A.change_ring(RDF).solve_right(b)
```
is justified, as it merely asserts that the answer is the same in either case. Because of that, I think it would be better to avoid using information obtained from the old parent, even if this is counter-intuitive. If we move the rank computation to `_solve_right_nonsingular_square`, this does not matter anyway.

I agree. Ideally, it should be part of the coercion code (except in the non-integral-domain case), so changing rings happens only once.

Indeed, this is not optimal. The superclass documentation should state that coercion is used on the arguments, and what the subclass method does (if it exists) should be consistent with what the superclass documentation says.

I am not sure how `solve_right` is implemented for `CBF`, but it is another case we may need to consider. This is interesting because, despite being inexact, for some systems over `CBF` it may be possible to decide with certainty whether or not a solution exists.

The other failure is the peculiar doctest in `src/sage/quivers/morphism.py`. It is caused by lifting a nontrivial element along the zero-morphism of a vector space over `RR`. A preimage does not exist, which cannot reliably tested over `RR`, so in this case I think the doctest is wrong in using `RR` rather than an exact ring like `QQ` as everywhere else in that file. Since `lift` is implemented using `solve_right`, this means that, if `solve_right` produces a poor approximation over an inexact ring, the result of `lift` will be just as bad.

I will try to see if I can make changes as outlined above if you agree.

Indeed, and I think the CBF doctest is wrong as well.

I have updated the branch accordingly. The rank computation is now done in `_solve_right_nonsingular_square` only, and the backslash operator now works as in Matlab and Octave, so that a least-squares solution is only computed in the non-square case. For exact rings, these changes should not make a difference.

Additionally, I have added a doctest for the problem in #13932, which is solved by this branch since the `check` parameter is now ignored over inexact rings.

Let's get this over with =)

The only other thing I see is in the new test,

```
Over inexact rings, the ``check`` parameter is ignored as the result is
only an approximate solution (:trac:`13932`)::

sage: RF = RealField(52)
sage: B = matrix(RF, 2, 2, 1)
sage: A = matrix(RF, [[0.24, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]])
sage: (A * A.solve_right(B) - B).norm() < 1e-14
True
```

to ensure that `check=True` is ignored, we also want that small norm to not actually be zero. If you feel like adding that, just go ahead and set it back to positive review without the round-trip.

Thanks for sticking with this. I've been complaining about issues like this since I was an undergrad, but I never had the guts to tackle it myself.
