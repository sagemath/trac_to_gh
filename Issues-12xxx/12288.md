This is a followup to #12058.  When you run `hg_sage.log()` in Sage, it runs the command `hg` which has been installed in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.  It does not run `sage --hg`.  Therefore, because of the changes in #12058, the variable `HGPLAIN` is set to "yes", so the pager is turned off.  We should instead either run `sage --hg` or unset `HGPLAIN` when running commands using `hg_sage`.
