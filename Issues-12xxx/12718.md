File "src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx", line 3279, in sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular.subs
Failed example:
    try:
      f.subs(x = x^n)
      print "no overflow"
    except OverflowError:
      print "overflow"
Expected:
    no overflow 
Got:
    x^1000000
    no overflow
```
but really there is a bunch more. Did you run the tests?

Okay, figured out what went wrong:

* the doctest failure Volker posted was missed because I ran my last tests on 32-bit not on 64-bit, but it only shows on 64-bit
* the other doctest failures were introduced in my last - seemingly innocent - fix

I've addressed these and ran doctests on one 64-bit and one 32-bit system. They passed.
