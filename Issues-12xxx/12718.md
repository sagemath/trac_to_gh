Okay, figured out what went wrong:

* the doctest failure Volker posted was missed because I ran my last tests on 32-bit not on 64-bit, but it only shows on 64-bit
* the other doctest failures were introduced in my last - seemingly innocent - fix

I've addressed these and ran doctests on one 64-bit and one 32-bit system. They passed.
