Since #9739, it has not been possible to doctest non-library files (if, as is likely, they contain definitions which get tested).  This is because in `sage-doctest` the same name is used for:

1. the python file which is created in `SAGE_TESTDIR` (a copy of, or a preparsed version of, the file being tested), and
2. the file which loads the previous file and contains the extracted doctests.

As a result, the first file is overwritten by the second, and then loads itself. Thus definitions from the original file are not available to the doctests.

> I think this is a duplicate of #12069  .


Indeed, it is; it should be closed.  

Sorry for missing #12069, which does a more thorough job.  Perhaps it should be added to #11337.
