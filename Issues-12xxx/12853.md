Consider the file

```
E = EllipticCurve([-879984,319138704])
P1 = E.point((540,1188))
P2 = E.point((576,1836))
P3 = E.point((468,3132))
P4 = E.point((612,3132))
P5 = E.point((432,4428))
t = cputime()
pts = E.integral_points([P1,P2,P3,P4,P5])
print "Time:", cputime(t)
```

With sage-4.8, this takes about 35 seconds.  With sage-5.0.beta10, the
same test takes about 50 seconds.

This is caused by #11599.

Well, if the slow-down cannot be fixed, I have not much choice...  I don't want to release sage-5.0 with such a massive speed regression.

With this patch on Sage-5.0.beta12 the example from the description drops on my machine from 37 to 12 seconds, which seems to be a severe speed-up compared to pre-#11599 state.

Given that this is achieved by a one-liner taking repeated computations out of the loop, perhaps nobody was really bothered by the speed of this code and as long as it works it is fine...
