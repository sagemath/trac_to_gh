For simplicial toric varieties, the rational cohomology ring and the ratironal Chow group are isomorphic. So if all normalizations are correct, then one should be able to do intersection computations in the cohomology ring. This patch fixes the `volume_class()` and the constructor of cohomology cycles from cones to make everything work.

It turns out that index_in_saturation does not work for trivial zero-size matrices, this is also fixed.

That's a really great expansion of the documentation!

I think I caught some typos:
* In `toric_variety` line 213 should be "many quantities of interest" without "s" on the end.
* On line 1977 "It gets tricky none of the maximal cones is smooth." does not sound right, some words or punctuation sighs are missing.

Hi. I looked at this and I agree that it looks good.

One thing:

On line 215 of toric_variety.py it says "For toric varieties with at most orbifold singularities, the rational cohomology ring `H(X,\QQ)` and the rational Chow ring `H(X,\QQ)` are isomorphic."

It's a bit confusing that they are both denoted by H(X,\QQ). Maybe A(X,\QQ) could be used for the Chow ring. Or `H^*(X,\QQ)` for cohomology and `H_*(X,\QQ)` for the Chow ring (if intersection homology and the Chow ring were already identified somehow).
