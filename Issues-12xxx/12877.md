This patch fixes the following classes to use categories:

- padics
- RealLazyField, ComplexLazyField
- AlgebraicScheme's and subclasses

#11935 depends on this one

Apparently yes :-)

```
sage: sage: k = GF(11)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(k,[1,1])
sage: Q = E(6,5)
sage: phi = E.isogeny(Q)
sage: phi.parent()
Set of Morphisms from Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 over Finite Field of size 11 to Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 7*x + 8 over Finite Field of size 11 in Category of hom sets in Category of Schemes
sage: phi.parent().homset_category()
Category of hom sets in Category of Schemes
```

(which by the way should really be Category of Schemes; see #12880)

As you point out in a comment, due to the custom `__getattr__` method, subclasses of `LazyField` can not be extension classes (because `Parent.__getattr__` is only needed when the class of the parent can not be turned into a subclass of the category's parent_class).

I am sure that you did try something like `getattr(super(self,LazyField),name)`. Did that not work? Why?

By consequence, you (have to) turn `cdef class ComplexLazyField_class(LazyField)` into `class ComplexLazyField_class(LazyField)`. Did you investigate potential speed penalties?

In the initialisation of `LocalGeneric`, which inherits from `CommutativeRing`, you still call `Parent.__init__` (with category support added), but not `CommutativeRing.__init__`, which would automatically grant category support. Why?

I tested (it should be `super(LazyField,self)`), and indeed it does not work. But still, one could add the stuff from the custom `Parent.__getattr__` into the custom `LazyField.__getattr__`:

```
sage: cython("""         
....: from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent
....: from sage.structure.parent import getattr_from_other_class
....: cdef class MyParent(Parent):
....:     def __getattr__(self, name):
....:         print "here is the custom getattr with", name
....:         return getattr_from_other_class(self, self.category().parent_class, name)
....: """)
sage: P = MyParent(category=CommutativeAdditiveSemigroups())
here is the custom getattr with _element_constructor_
here is the custom getattr with Element
here is the custom getattr with element_class
sage: P.addition_table
here is the custom getattr with addition_table
here is the custom getattr with __custom_name
here is the custom getattr with _repr_
<bound method CommutativeAdditiveSemigroups.parent_class.addition_table of <type '_mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_12258_tmp_4_spyx_0.MyParent'>>
```
There is also some more stuff in `Parent.__getattr__`, that was written for cached methods.

The question is whether the code duplication would be worth the effort.

I accept your argument about `RLF` not being of extension type. Since the doctests pass and the patch looks fine, I give it a positive review.

However, I'd like to understand how Parent differs from other classes with a custom `__getattr__`.

> I accept your argument about `RLF` not being of extension type. Since the doctests pass and the patch looks fine, I give it a positive review.

Thanks for the quick review!

> However, I'd like to understand how Parent differs from other classes with a custom `__getattr__`.

I guess it's a question of extension types versus non extension types.

No, it isn't.

```
sage: cython("""                  
....: cdef class MyParent(object):               
....:     def __getattr__(self, str name):
....:         raise AttributeError,name
....: """)
sage: MyParent.__getattr__
<method '__getattr__' of '_mnt_local_king__sage_temp_mpc622_20365_tmp_0_spyx_0.MyParent' objects>
```

At least that is what I find with sage-5.1.notebook. I do get an error in an old version of Sage that still uses the old Cython spkg.
