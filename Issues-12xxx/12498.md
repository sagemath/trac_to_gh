1. The output of `GeneralDiscreteDistribution().get_random_element()` is not a Sage number per se and hence has no `parent` attribute.

2. The import of sage.rings.real_double seems unnecessary in the file `devel/sage/sage/gsl/probability_distribution.pyx` since all the calls to RDF are made explicitly as `sage.rings.real_double.RDF` in the entire file.

Attaching a patch to fix both the above issues. The patch passes all doctests in `devel/sage/sage/gsl`.

Haven't tried to break this, but I don't see how having it being an Integer as opposed to int would lead to anything *breaking*.  Does `gsl_ran_discrete` always return ints?

The patch *does* need a better commit message.

Yes. I believe `gsl_ran_discrete` always return ints. I ran into a problem with this because in one of my programs I was expecting that since I am always calling Sage commands, I will always get objects which are Sage objects and not python objects. At one point I was testing for the `parent()` of the number and it failed because `get_random_element()` was returning ints.

Additionally, I think it should be Integer also for consistency. For example the other probability distributions return RDF instead of floats.

It didn't have a commit message! Apparently, I forgot to put one. Updated the patch now.
