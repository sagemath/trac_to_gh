zmod.patch replaces references to zmod_poly with nmod_poly and (hopefully) fixes places where the interface of a function changed. Completely untested at this point, of course.

Some remarks:

I deleted the zmod_poly_pow function implemented in Sage, since FLINT now provides such a function.

There is no longer a _nmod_poly_set_coeff_ui, which was used in one place (creating a polynomial from a list). I replaced it with nmod_poly_set_coeff_ui rather than manipulating coefficients directly, which is a bit slower, but shouldn't matter that much.

nmod_poly_resultant needs to be added in FLINT 2. If we don't get it done, the code calling it could just be commented out to fall back to the default Sage code that already handles the non-prime case.

I didn't change any filenames or Sage types (so the corresponding Sage files/functions/types are all still called zmod_poly).

The new pxd file uses the GMP mp_limb_t (etc) types rather than unsigned long (etc). Some search and replace might be needed, or importing the types from gmp.h.

Added another patch for fmpz_poly functions.

fmpz_poly.pxi still needs rewriting, and I didn't touch the cases in polynomial_rational_flint.pyx (since that file needs fmpq_poly fixes as well).

Was the directory lost after the recent sage.math problems ?
I can't locate a spancratz directory on /scratch...
I'll have a look at the google groups in case I can find more info there.

This new spkg and patch should apply to a clean install of sage-5.0, and almost completely allows building Sage against flint-2.3:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/fredrik/flint-2.3.spkg

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/fredrik/flint-2.3-sage-5.0.diff

There is one small remaining issue building Sage: at one point, the definition of ulong in zn_poly.h apparently clashes with the one in flint. A quick workaround for development purposes is to add #ifndef ulong ... #endif in sage/local/include/zn_poly.h. I don't know the best proper fix. But with the workaround,

sage -f flint-2.3.spkg

sage -b

should work.

When starting Sage, there is a link time error (finding fmpz_set_ZZ), so it seems that the NTL interface is not being built or included correctly. Presumably, fixing that, Sage will start up successfully, though most likely there will be some bugs to hunt down...

I've had a very quick look and the spkg needs major simplification.
Most of the logic which was present is now in the flint configure script.
I'll try to provide an updated version.

I see that there was some restriction in the previous spkg-install reported by Michael Abshoff on an "US IIIi" with GCCC 4.3.2 which is not reflected in the configure script.
Some reason for this ?

To answer my own question, by default -funroll-loops is not included by default, which covers the solaris case.

The NTL problem is just that interfaces/NTL-interface.lo is not included into libflint anymore.
The configure and Makefile.in files should be modified.

There was some partial magic added here (*_EXTRAS):
https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/commit/64b5b59977cf1b29bc01faf4d4ff20e121ab7198
but removed here:
https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/commit/0103ccbef63781436ad51e060a7adcb0e6b23865
if I'm not wrong.

Violently changing the Makefile.in to include NTL-interface.lo solves the problem, although this should certainly be included upstream rather than here.

Another complication might be that the headers used to be installed into $SAGE_LOCAL/include/FLINT which is quite meaningful because there are a lot of them.

It would be nice to use the install target, but it would put everything into $S_L/include/.

Somebody has a thought about that?
Modify flint Makefile? Install the headers into $S_L/include/ and modify Sage source (mainly the module thing at the top of Sage and flint*.px* files)? Continue to copy the files by hand?

Running make ptest raises a limited number of problem.
The first one I saw is quite bad: I get time out caused by some segfaults...

Apparently, something is now deallocated twice (I get a double linked blah from glibc, more precisely "*** glibc detected *** python: corrupted double-linked list: 0x00... ***").
(This is not caused by the _fmps_cleanup() call, it also happens without it)

This is not sytemcan be reproduced by testing ell_tate_curve.py for example.

About other easy errors:
* failures in polynomial_zmod_flint are just a change in the behavior of _mul_trunc_opposite which calls nmod_poly_mulhigh
* failures in combinat/sf/jack are just changes in ordering and normalization
* a failure in rings.fraction_field_FpT is just a change in a choice of a sqrt, the other error is more mysterious, in fact it is just because of a different normalization (the minus goes into the denominator rather the numerator)... the problem is that equality testing is consequently wrong, or the result of sqrt should be normalized with the corresponding Sage function (note for later, the nmod_poly_cmp defined there should be removed and nmod_poly_equal used instead)
* the failure in function_field_element is a chang in the choice of a sqrt

There is a segfault in function_field_ideal in a call to _nmod_poly_xgcd_euclidean

The error in flint.pyx is mentioned in the previous post.

The error in jacobian_morphism might be related to the FFT problem, otherwise, I have no idea.
Quite strangely Q*239 where Q is a point on a jacobian of hyperelliptic curve should return Q because Q is of order 238...
Evaluating Q*237+Q*2 is ok equal to Q, but Q*2+Q*237 is wrong equal to -Q !!
This is not true for 3, but true for 4, so I guess there is a problem when a point is doubled.

And the following files (at least) randomly produced memory managment errors (although all test passed):
* book_stein_modform
* ell_tate_curve (less often, potentially different problem)
* ell_padic_field
* overconvergent/genus0

Quite strangely, something got broken on my 5.0 install and I was not able to reinstall zn_poly while trying to provide a patched spkg (by the way I just found out #12433).

The problem seems to be that while building profiler.c, the inclusion of profiler.h is skipped so lots of things are undefined (even stderr!).
I don't get why yet...

Anyway I just started rebuilding stuff on top of a 5.1.beta0 install, first the updated zn_poly spkg from #12433) and then my wip flint-2.3 package and no more tweaking of zn_poly.h is needed to build flint-2.3, which is good news.
I'm also able to rebuild zn_poly afterward, so maybe I just did something wrong on the previous install.

Fredrik's patch needs some rebasing to apply on top of 5.1.beta0.
I'll rebase it and also upload the few further changes and an updated spkg I made for testing purposes.

<a id='comment:39'></a>
I'm not sure how everything gets freed when Sage exits but I think I got the culprit (or one of them).

When quit_all() in sage.all is called
- in the beginning free_flint_stack() is called which calls _fmpz_cleanup(),
- but then there must be other calls to fmpz_poly_clear() for example in ..quaternion_algebra_element._clear_globals(),
whence potential double free().

Also the `__dealloc__` methods of the classes based on fmp?_poly call fmp?_clear_poly.
I don't know when Python objects are deallocated but if this happens after the call to _fmpz_cleanup(), that might be problematic.

As far as PARI is concerned, the `__dealloc__` function of gen objects first checks that the pointer to the PARI object is not 0, maybe the same should be done for Sage objects based on flint objects.
However, calls to fmpz_poly_clear as in quaternion_algebra_element will be more tedious to deal with.

After a first experiment, putting the call to free_flint_stack() a little later, just after twisted is closed solves memory corruption when doctesting ell_padic_field.
This is quite mysterious to me...

Here is some progress hopefully:
the easiiest way I found to reproduce the memory corruption error is through doctesting sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_padic_field.py

Within this file the problem seems to come (meaning that if I remove it I cannont repoduce the bug in a reasonable time) from the line

```
uN = (1 + h(x0)/y0**(2*p)).sqrt()
```
and more precisely from the evaluation

```
h(x0)
```
AND because it is done within a locally defined function whereas h is defined in the outer function.

I'm not sure all the memory corruption problems come from such a case, but at least sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py where I've seen one time such a bug and sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_tate_curve.py where I've seen it several times use similarly locally defined functions.

Compiling flint in reentrant mode seems to "solve" the ell_padic_field error.
I just launched "make ptest" and will report about that when it finishes.

The first Invalid read of size 8 is likely not a bug. On various platforms, mpn_copyi relies on page boundaries being aligned to a multiple of 16 bytes so that it can safely read an extra 8 bytes, IIRC. (This pops up all over the place when valgrinding flint unit tests, and it's convenient to add it to the valgrind suppression file.)

The second one has to be what it looks like: some polynomial lives until after _fmpz_cleanup has been called.

So the question is how we can guarantee that all Python objects referencing flint objects get deallocated before _fmpz_cleanup is called. 

If this is impossible, I guess we could compile flint in reentrant mode for Sage (but this would slow things down, unfortunately). 

One possibility is that we change _fmpz_cleanup to free all mpz limb data but leave the mpz array. This might still be a bit fragile, but if it works, it should solve the problem of polluting valgrind logs since there will only be one large block of unfreed memory.

We must also have this problem with flint_compute_primes.

Does Sage free the MPFR caches on exit, and if so where?

Perhaps this should be brought to sage-devel.

I tried to modify the `__dealloc__` methods of all classes involving flint polynomials and in the different files directly using them by first checking that the pointer is not 0 before calling the clear function, but it did not solve the problem.
So either I forgot some of them or my test was stupid (I just copied the idea from the PARI's GEN class, I didn't actually think).

Slowing down the library would not be that great.
As i mentioned earlier, jsut moving the call to _flint_cleanup within quit_sage solves the problem, even though this is surely not the "right" solution.
I'm not convinced compiling flint in reentrant mode would be although I have no real knowledge of reentrancy.

Deallocation is done by quit_sage() defined in $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/all.py

Different libraries are concerned, e.g. PARI, but MPFR is not.
Potentially, and if this was possible, this was just forgotten.

If it doesn't work, that means some part of Sage is hanging on to some Python objects, and that code should arguably be fixed so that they can be freed first (perhaps with an explicit call).

I'm quite ok with this decision, although, as I pointed before, I have no idea of when Python/Sage objects actually get deallocated, so this might be a flaky solution.

Now I'm getting a little lost:
I have trouble to understand how the error (in the different forms it takes, I assumed it was actually an underlying "double free") can be caused by a call to fmpz_poly_clean after _fmpz_cleanup was called.
Indeed, all fmpz_poly_clean does is to deallocate the space needed to store pointers to the coefficients and write in the fmpz_unused_arr that the coeff itself can be reused.
This array was already deallocated by _fmpz_cleanup, so we end up writing somewhere we should not really, but whatever should I say: it is quite unlikely that this will actually break something.

Sorry if that sounds stupid or is deeply wrong, but I prefer to be sure everything is clear in my mind.

Ok, but then some fmpz won't be freed and that's all.
This won't lead to any segfault, memory error or horrible breaks.

In case someone actually used Sage in library mode, and played at launching and closing it several times, that would lead to memory leaks (surely among a lot of other ones), but nothing more.

And I do not see any problematic calls to fmpz_clear within Sage.
The few ones (its definition within fmpz.pxi, 4 calls in polynomial_integer_dense_flint.pyx and one call in quaternion_algebra_element.pyx) are typically made on local variables which are allocated and freed within functions.

Although there are several calls to fmpz_poly_clear in the quatalg stuff which does not seem to cause similar problem.

As a solution, let's just put the call to _fmpz_cleanup at the end of the quit_sage function and let the buildbot decide if it's really acceptable.

I'll go on with the other problems now.

The following still fail with what only appears to be simple normalization problems: polynomial_zmod_flint.pyx, combinat/sf/jack.py

Only one failure remains that appears to be a genuine bug: graphs/matchpoly.pyx

I've just tested graphs/matchpoly.pyx with the latest flint's commit (see what is on my github account), together with all patches to the Sage library posted here (and some minor additional stuff including moving flint_free_stack just before cleaning symmetrica), and cannot repoduce errors in that file.

Expected:

The new value definitely seems to be wrong: complete_poly(n) has coefficients with about n digits for n = 100, 200, ..., 900, but then complete_poly(1000) evaluates to have coefficients with 6000 digits. 

This is on a 32-bit system, by the way.

By the way, it seems to me that the FFT bug is still present on my system although I've merged the latest commits.

I've updated the spkg available at http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/flint-2.3.jp.spkg with new git commits.
Moreover it contains better cleaned up spkg-install and spkg-check scripts, together with an updated SPKG.txt (for the moment nothing is committed).

I'm not sure about some stuff for that spkg :
- There is some stuff related to Cygwin, I've tried to let it act as before, but have no idea why this was needed, nor if it's still needed.
- There is some stuff related to 64 bits build when SAGE64 is set, not sure about the status of this (in fact I don't really know on what systems this is needed for any spkg, not usual Linux install for sure). With FLINT current configure system, behaving as before overwrites the default CFLAGS FLINT would have chosen (ok, the only relevant part is -O2 -g which is also set together with -m64 when SAGE64 is set, but I'm not really happy with such a solution, could FLINT use some kind of ABI variable?).
- We could or should treat the SAGE_DEBUG flag correctly. As far as CFLAGS are concerned, we can set them ourselves but there is no way to prevent FLINT from using the FLINT_TUNE magic.
- I've put Fredrik and I as maintainers for the moment, any more reasonable proposition is welcomed.

I've uploaded a new spkg (same address) based on Fredrik's latest git commit (c644b926cd6f...) plus an additional modification to Makefile.in so that the NTL interface is correctly build (not committed, let's wait for Bill to properly fix it, if that's actually needed).

With this latest spkg, Sage 5.1.beta3 builds correctly and passes "make ptestlong" on my amd64 Ubuntu 12.04.

Within the 32 bits virtual machine, Sage 5.1.beta2 passes "./sage -t sage/graphs/matchpoly.pyx" (although the mul_SS bug is still present, now another algorithm is used I presume).

So I guess we just have to wait for a proper release of FLINT, potentially modify the way it is configure by spkg-install, and properly review every patch to the Sage library and changes to the spkg.

There is some work to be done to rebase on #10617.
I'm working on this.

As far as the spkg is concerned, I think there is only the Cygwin question to deal with.
It seems to me that FLINT can not be build as a shared library on Cygwin (at least Bill disabled this possibility).
I'm not sure this is required by Sage, but would guess so.
So potentially we should disable the Cygwin hacks altogether and only build a static library (which would link to the static NTL library).

I've completely failed to croospost on both flint-devel and sage-devel yesterday, and have just posted on sage-devel to get some info about the shared/static and cygwin stuff.

I'm also installing Cygwin right now to get a hint of what happens there.

Once I've gathered more info, I'll update the Cygwin part of spkg-install and I guess the spkg will be ready for review.

On the other hand, I guess that all the patches to the Sage library deserve proper review now.
If you feel ok with mine, please post about it here.
I'll have a(nother) look at what Mike, Sebastian and you did to be sure we've not let anything go through.

What might be nice to check is that all functions defined in the pxi files still correspond to actual functions (for example the compose stuff now has an _fmpz trailing), because Im not sure that defining something in these files that does not actually exist in the library would lead to a build failure (if it does, then there's no problem cos everything builds fine here :))

I once had such a problem.
IIRC a hackish but working fix is to "cdef extern blahblah" directly the structure in the file where you want to use it, so that you avoid to include all of the corresponding file with cimport and the corresponding dependencies and conflicts hell, in particular here where C and C++ get mixed because of NTL.

Attachment [07-headers-sage-5.2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12173/07-headers-sage-5.2.patch) by jpflori created at 2012-07-30 17:49:33

I've rebased patches on top of 5.2.
I guess this is quite of useless because all patches related to #715 should get remerged soon and we'll need to rebase on top of that which is basically the same as the latest 5.1 betas.
Anyway...

Apart from that I've posted a patch to get faster conversion between integer and mod polys, this is quite dirty, but seems to work ok.
I did not have the time to rerun the test suite yet.

The trick about ntl was to tell cython to use g++ rather than gcc.

Two other remarks:
* there is some file still named zmod_poly, I guess that's from FLINT 1.x and zn_poly, we might rename it to nmod_poly,
* the integer_dense class does not use the template thing used by other polynomial class, I guess it should be treated in another ticket, but will be potentially a big amount of work. this is also true for other classes there.
* the fmpz_mod_poly module could be wrapped, once again a fairly big amount of work.

I think there is two differences here which complicate the situation:
* we don't have an equivalent of PARIUniqueInstance to which every Sage objects using (in)directly fmpz's could point to
* I fear some classes keep C pointers to fmpz's without any Python level wrapping (such as gen in the PARI case) and free them when they are deleted.

So without implementing such a unique FLINT instance and pointing to it in every stuff using part of FLINT, it will be hard to ensure that every Sage object is deleted before calling the FLINT cleanup function.

I think the spkg here is (almost?) completely usable.

Simon's remark is sensible, but currently there should be no segfaults occurring at all.
It would surely lead to a better integration of Sage/Python and FLINT memory management, but this would need a huge amount of work, modifying all the pieces of code in Sage which directly use FLINT at the C/Cython level.
This could be a "follow-up" ticket (although the problem also exists with the previous versions of FLINT).

The main blocker now is to wait for the final FLINT 2.3 release.

(I've update the spkg link to point to a working address)

I don't think this is mandatory to upgrade FLINT? Of course it would be nice to update MPIR as well.

I'll try to upload an updated spkg containing the 2.3 final later today, so this should quite trivially get positive review.

Attachment [flint-2.3-root-5.5.rc0.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12173/flint-2.3-root-5.5.rc0.patch) by jpflori created at 2012-11-23 16:53:31

Here comes an updated spkg including FLINT 2.3 final at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/flint-2.3.spkg
and two combined and rebased patch to apply to Sage 5.5.rc0.

The only real additions were make to jack.patch because a lot of new doctests were included in sage/combinat/sf/jack.py and had to be fixed as well.

The other rebasing stuff was quite trivial.

I've not included the renaming done by the previous 16-... patch to stick with FLINT terminology as it was surely a bad idea and broke some unpickling tests in Sage.
Anyway, it can be done later.

Remark that as Sage only includes MPIR 2.4.x and not MPIR 2.5.x, the FLINT spkg builds correctly and its and Sage test suite pass, so we could first include this, then work on upgrading MPIR directly to 2.6.x, skipping the problematic 2.5.x versions.

The new spkg built fine for me (64-bit ubuntu), the patches both applied fine to sage-5.5, and all tests pass.  Hence:

The spkg should be rebased to the flint-1.5.2.p2 package currently in Sage.

Also, the deprecated `_sig_on` and `_sig_off` should be replaced by `sig_on()` and `sig_off()`.

The new spkg builds fine for me (64-bit ubuntu) with SAGE_CHECK=yes.  I am running a full test after applying both patches and doing sage -br.

All tests pass.  I'm not sure that I will test it again after Jeroen's suggested edits!

Allow me to suggest a few small changes to `spkg-install`:

1. Change

```
CFLAGS="-O0 -g"; export CFLAGS
```
to

```
export CFLAGS="-O0 -g $CFLAGS"
```

2. Rename `$EXTRA_CONF` to `$FLINT_CONFIGURE` for analogy with other packages, **don't** quote it in the `./configure` invocation and change

```
EXTRA_CONF="--disable-static"
```
to

```
FLINT_CONFIGURE="--disable-static $FLINT_CONFIGURE"
```

3. Quote `$SAGE_LOCAL`:

```
rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libflint* 
rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL"/include/flint 
```

4. Why doesn't `spkg-check` have a newline at the end of the file?

To allow

```
FLINT_CONFIGURE="--enable-foo --disable-bar"
```
You want this to be two separate words, similar to how `$CC` and `$CFLAGS` should not be quoted.

This breaks all over the place on OS X, see [http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/UW%20bsd%20%28OSX%2010.6%20x86_64%29/builds/192/steps/shell_7/logs/stdio](http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/UW%20bsd%20%28OSX%2010.6%20x86_64%29/builds/192/steps/shell_7/logs/stdio)

This also shows that some `cdef` functions should have `except` clauses, in particular

```
cdef void _set_fmpz_poly(self, fmpz_poly_t)
```
Otherwise, what's the point of `sig_on()`?

Does FLINT pass its testsuite there?

This is problematic:

```
     Extension('sage.rings.fraction_field_FpT',
               sources = ['sage/rings/fraction_field_FpT.pyx'],
               language = 'c++',
               libraries = ["csage", "flint", "gmp", "gmpxx", "ntl", "zn_poly"],
               extra_compile_args=["-std=c99", "-D_XPG6"],
               include_dirs = [SAGE_INC + 'flint/'],
               depends = flint_depends),
```
A file cannot be both C++ and C99.

This causes a build failure on OpenSolaris (buildbot machine `hawk`).

Anyway, it leaves you the pleasure to launch tests on bsd.
Cannot do much about that as I don't have access to such systems and I won't have time to stare at the code thinking about what goes wrong in factor() or whatever.

That's not really true.  I sometimes test tickets (like this one) which don't have positive review.

However: if a reviewer thinks a ticket is good, except perhaps that it hasn't been tested on some systems, then that reviewer should put the ticket to positive_review to get it tested.  But that's not the situation here, no reviewer has looked sufficiently well at the patch to approve it.

In fact the changes used to be split among different patches, but at some point I've gather them back together thinking it would be easier to maintain them that way.

You can see the previous bunch of patch in the diff at http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12173#comment:138
Except for additional changes in jack.pyx and the removal of a bad change I made, the changes did not really evolve IIRC, maybe some rebasing only.

Hum, that's not just OS X that OS X on PPC. By the look of the log I am wondering if flint was built properly. I don't know if the buildbot run with spkg-check but I would be curious to see the result on that machine. And the build log too.

Karl-dieter has (or had) such a machine.

I started with a freshly built 5.6, installed the spkg and patches and then did sage -b.

> The way flint is upgraded probably don't remove everything of flint 1.5/ It merely overwrite the common files and leave the other in place. If there is a versionned libflint-1.5.dylib it probably is still there.


I ran "find $SAGE_ROOT -name *flint* -print," and the only versioned files I found were

```
./spkg/installed/flint-1.5.2.p2
./spkg/installed/flint-2.3
./spkg/logs/flint-1.5.2.p2.log
./spkg/logs/flint-2.3.log
./spkg/optional/flint-2.3.spkg
./spkg/standard/flint-1.5.2.p2.spkg
```

The .a, .o, .so and .dylib files were all unversioned:

```
./devel/sage-main/build/temp.macosx-10.6-x86_64-2.7/sage/libs/flint/flint.o
./local/lib/libflint.a
./local/lib/libflint.dylib
```

> Could you try to find if there are still bits of flint 1.5 on your install and remove them David?


Are there any of the above that actually matter removing?

It was an idea that I had but it turns out flint is indeed unversioned and the spkg tries to clean previous install before putting the new libs. So that's a dead end. No need to remove anything. I am trying with a build including flint 2.3 from scratch.

Flint has some inline assembly for x86, x86_64, arm and itanium, but nothing for ppc. You could try editing longlong.h to fall back to the generic code and see if that changes anything on x86_64.

The only way to get to the bottom of this is probably to take one of the failing tests and isolate the point in the code where results start to differ from a passing system...

I could put my hand on a Mac OS X 10.7 where the problems occur.

At least one of the really worrying things is as follow:
* converting an integer coefficients poly to a rational coeffs one kill all coeffs after any coeff whose size is larger than 64.stg bits.
* but they are not really killed as the poly is still aware of it degree and you can still test equality of the original int poly with the new rat poly and get True.
That's the problem behind all the factor() calls giving stupid results (and maybe other failing doctests).

There seems to be a problem in the call to fmpq_poly_set_fmpz_poly in polynomial_rational_flint.pyx at line 257.

It's quite funny, if I call fmpz_poly_print before entering fmpq_poly_set_fmpz_poly then its ok, but inside I get 0s instead of the right MPZ values (for things not stored directly).
And when outside again, its ok.

And if I first create an fmpq_poly with small coeffs and then multipliy it and convert it to int coeffs and convert it back to rat coeffs its ok...

Thanks a bunch for looking at this, jp.

It sounds really bizarre. Just from looking at the code, I see no reason that it should fail.

What happens if you manually print the actual values of the fmpzs (as longs) in both the input fmpz_poly and the output fmpq_poly, and what does the output show?

Does reentrant mode help?

Inside fmpq_set_fmpz_poly, printing each (in fact Ive tried to bedug only the case a*x where a is either 1 or huge so "each" is "the two") fmpz independently using fmpz_print(op->coeffs+i) or through fmpz_print_poly gives the same result: I get 0 for what are actually mpz_t rather than (tweaked) longs (IIRC I don't have access to the Mac right now) which at least is consistent.
What disturbing is that calling COEFF_IS_MPZ gives the correct answer inside the function call (i.e. 1 for the x coefficient when a is huge, although 0 is printed, and 0 for the constant coefficient which is 0).

I've checked the value of x._ _poly/ op is the same outside and inside the function call, and the address op->coeffs inside the function call looks fine.

I'll try that tomorrow.

FYI I tried using the fallback routines in longlong.h and that did not solve the problem.

Using a reentrant version did not solve the problem...
Replying to [fredrik.johansson](#comment%3A190):
> I was wondering what would show if you print them with printf("%ld", poly[i])

I modified FLINT as follow:
* in fmpz_poly.h:

```
static __inline__
int fmpz_poly_print(const fmpz_poly_t poly)
{
  int i = 0;
	for (; i < fmpz_poly_length(poly); i++)
	{
	    printf("exp: %d ", i);
	    printf("MPZ: %d ", (COEFF_IS_MPZ(*(poly->coeffs+i)))?1:0);
	    printf("addr: %lX ", (unsigned long) poly->coeffs+i);
	    printf("val: %ld ", *(poly->coeffs+i));
	    printf("val: %lX ", *(poly->coeffs+i));
	    printf("fmpz: ");
            fmpz_print(poly->coeffs+i);
	    printf(" !! ");
	}
	printf("\n");
    return fmpz_poly_fprint(stdout, poly);
}
```
* in fmpq_poly/set_fmpz_poly.c:

```
void fmpq_poly_set_fmpz_poly(fmpq_poly_t rop, const fmpz_poly_t op)
{
    if (fmpz_poly_is_zero(op))
    {
        fmpq_poly_zero(rop);
    }
    else
    {
        int i = 0;
        fmpz_poly_print(op);
        printf("\n");
        fmpq_poly_fit_length(rop, fmpz_poly_length(op));
        fmpz_poly_print(op);
        printf("\n");
        _fmpq_poly_set_length(rop, fmpz_poly_length(op));
	printf("length = %ld\n", fmpz_poly_length(op));
	printf("id = %lX\n", (unsigned long)op);
	fmpz_poly_print(op);
	printf("\n");
	for (; i < fmpz_poly_length(op); i++)
	{
	    printf("exp: %d ", i);
	    printf("MPZ: %d ", (COEFF_IS_MPZ(*(op->coeffs+i)))?1:0);
	    printf("addr: %lX ", (unsigned long) op->coeffs+i);
	    printf("val: %ld ", *(op->coeffs+i));
	    printf("val: %lX ", *(op->coeffs+i));
	    printf("fmpz: ");
            fmpz_print(op->coeffs+i);
	    printf(" !! ");
	}
	printf("\n");
        _fmpz_vec_set(rop->coeffs, op->coeffs, rop->length);
        fmpz_one(rop->den);
    }
}
```

In Sage:
* in polynomial_integer_dense_flint.pyx:

```
    def jprint(self):
        fmpz_poly_print(self.__poly)
```
* in polynomial_rational_flint.pyx

```
        elif PY_TYPE_CHECK(x, Polynomial_integer_dense_flint):
            print hex(<long>((<Polynomial_integer_dense_flint>x).__poly))
            printf("%X\n",(<Polynomial_integer_dense_flint>x).__poly)
            print x
            x.jprint()
            print ""
            (<Polynomial_integer_dense_flint>x).jprint()
            print ""
            fmpq_poly_set_fmpz_poly(self.__poly, (<Polynomial_integer_dense_flint>x).__poly)
```

If I'm reading this right, it prints the fmpz_poly four times before even entering fmpq_poly, and it's wrong the third time, that is, when calling (<Polynomial_integer_dense_flint>x).jprint()?

But the fmpz coefficients are the same, so it is (seemingly) the entries in flint's global mpz array that are being zeroed when they shouldn't.

It smells a lot like one of the bugs we've had in the past with the non-reentrant mode, i.e., somewhere, some code loads an mpz pointer, and hangs on to it while the mpz array gets resized. It could potentially be triggered by a compiler bug which, say, makes it overlook constness somewhere.

Nope, the first wrong printing is the the first one inside fmpq_set_fmpz_poly.
The first "print x" command at the Sage level corresponds to "x^8 + 2*x^7 + 3*x^6 + 92233...".

> But the fmpz coefficients are the same, so it is (seemingly) the entries in flint's global mpz array that are being zeroed when they shouldn't.

I'm not sure they really get zeroed.
Ok it sounds fishy, but I'm able to print again f correctly after having done f.change_ring(QQ)...

I'll give the same piece of code a shot on Linux to see if anything looks different but I doubt it, then I'll try to watch the addresses with gdb.

Maybe some casting problems?

On Linux, I get the same value the three times.

It seems there have been some problems when updating FLINT, with a flint directory created, but a FLINT one somehow still there.

I did not test reentrant mode correctly because there were multiple spaces before --reentrant and it was not parsed by FLINT configure.

I does not seem the global array gets resized.
Ive put some printf lines in the if(fmpz_allocated) part of _fmpz_new_mpz and ot does not get triggered.

But somehow the fmpz_arr value changes...

This is stranger than ever :-)

If you can figure out where the two arrays are coming from, it might just be the solution of the problem.

If nothing else works, perhaps we could just update flint to include the patch https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/flint2/commit/03487ed18f40f08cea7f5a71dcfd43cb6fd70115 but with the `__thread` prefixes removed. (If my own benchmarking was correct, this will even make flint faster, too.)

Think I got it.
Something does not like the dylib64 extension so some parts of Sage where linked with the static libflint.a, but some others with libflint.dylib64.

Ive copied libflint.dylib64 to liblint.dylib, touched everything in sage/libs/flint and sage/rings/polynomial and rebuilt Sage and could not reproduce the error.

All of this is because of me...

So keeping dylib64 extension from FLINT 1 series was not a good idea.

I'd say it "just" needs review now that the crap I introduced for OS X is fixed.
John Cremona was already happy with the patches if that's relevant.
See some comment above.

As far as rebasing is concerned, I did it not so long ago, but it might need another one unfortunately...

I don't think they really changed except for the fact they were merged together without the last of the list which was not such a good idea, or at least deserve more thoughts.

After comment 123 they were basically just rebased over and over, and at some point additional fixes were added by Jeroen, see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12173?replyto=213#comment:153.

The spkg itself needs rebasing for sure, on top of #14241 and potentially #14268.
I could surely do that next week.
Don't know about the patches to the Sage library.

I think the changes from #14268 make sense.
Using one typedef rather than macros (and bunch of #undef in FLINT 2.3 all over the code to mitigate conflicts with system headers in FLINT itself) is a good thing.
I'll report it upstream and that will hopefully change in a future minor release (also including the OS X fix).

So even though the patch for FLINT 2.3 is completely different from the one from #14268, the idea is from there and I think it's a good think maybe not to depend on the ticket itself, but at least to inherit from the spkg there.
Therefore if we get this ticket positively reviewed before #14268 we could just remove the dependency on #14268 and the 1.5.2.p4 spkg from there.
I don't think making #14268 on this ticket would be fair.

I'll fix that.

You can just propose whatever changes you want to include here, I'm in close contact with upstream, especially for the build system, so I'll take care of coordination.
I agree there is some fishy things going on with FLINT_TUNE and CFLAGS and surely other things.

And don't say "let's switch to autotools" unless you wanna be in charge of the build system maintenance as Bill Hart will definitely not want to maintain it.

Be also aware there won't be any FLINT release before at least the dev meeting in may.
So I think we should just make minor modifications and get this in quickly.
It's been bitrotting for so long...
I'll up another spkg based on #14241  not touching the ulong stuff.

:-)  Yes.  I just meant I don't know if there are any changes in progress w.r.t. this.

It doesn't seem we'd need any *Sage-specific* changes, so IMHO we should take fixes from upstream, or push (generic) changes there.

 
> Be also aware there won't be any FLINT release before at least the dev meeting in may.


Yes.  But FLINT 2.3.1 should (already) include any fixes we (and others) need, see above.

Not that I am aware of, so unless Bill posts here and rants we all should assume so.

Of course, its just I'm getting tired by this ticket and don't want to wait for the 2.3.1 release which at best will happen in mid-may and then all the stuff here will have to be rebased again...
And that's optimistic because I guess most people at the FLINT meeting will expect to work with FLINT 2.3 and this spkg and will implement new features in FLINT/Sage, rather than working on the FLINT build system and trying to push a new release.

So I feel our best shot is to get http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/flint-2.3.p0.spkg.14241 in as it just modifies flint-2.3 minimally to make it work on OS X.
Let's keep the C99, strange env variables fun for a later FLINT release/Sage spkg if its not definitely needed to let Sage work on supported systems.

As for `ulong`: I think the correct solution is

```
typedef unsigned long ulong;
```
instead of `#define`. This `typedef` is compatible with the common C libraries. Of course, the workaround currently in `zn_poly` would need to be removed too.

Well, the disadvantage of `typedef`s (vs. `#define`s) is always that there's no way to test (with the preprocessor) whether a type is already (`type`)def'd (other than checking such in `configure` and defining `HAVE_TYPEDEF_FOO` etc.).

As mentioned elsewhere, in the present cases it would IMHO be cleaner to use `mp_limb_t` anyway (which of course isn't that much shorter or easier to type than `unsigned long`).

Oh, and of course FLINT 2.3's test suite passed in both cases as well; I just noticed there's no message regarding that (and when running the test suite in parallel, the output isn't synced, i.e., you may get `foo...bar...` and a couple of `PASS`s where it's not obvious what they refer to, which isn't really a problem until a test fails).

About the typedef thing, I propose we wait until the FLINT meeting in early may which I should attend.
I'll discuss it there with Bill Hart.

But if you think its really an issue and want #14268 merged first (or at the same time, I mean going from define to typedef in FLINT whether its 1.x or 2.x), feel free to discuss it on flint-devel group.
You can then use the spkg a few comments above I based on the one from #14268.

And it's know that the output of tests are out of sync when run in parallel, but before they were not even run in parallel, so I think the situation is better now, although not optimal.

I think we should postpone that to a follow-up ticket, i.e., get FLINT 2.3 in as is first.




> And it's know that the output of tests are out of sync when run in parallel, but before they were not even run in parallel, so I think the situation is better now, although not optimal.


:-)  Yes, but adding (back?) a message to `spkg-check` in case all tests passed wouldn't be bad, nor hard...

I agree. The main argument in favour of `typedef` is that some other libraries (including `glibc`, which should be a strong precedent and `zn_poly`) also use `typedef`. And it's not a problem to have the same `typedef` twice.

```C
typedef unsigned long ulong;

typedef unsigned long ulong;
```
gives an error (redefinition of ulong) at least with earlier versions of GCC.  `clang` is more verbose:

```

As I pointed above before, all the content of the patchbomb is from:
* http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12173#comment:123
except that:
* the last patch from there is omitted in the merged patchbomb;
* the patch bomb was rebased several times;
* one or two newly introduced doctests had to be changed;
* your fixes from http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12173?replyto=213#comment:153 were included.

But if you feel we must really have the latest version resplitted to do a proper review, I'll give it a try when rebasing once more against #14393.

You don't need to resplit everything as before. The problem is that a large part of this patch is simply renaming stuff. This should be done automatically (e.g. with a `sed` command).

That's the minimal thing that I require: a script which does the automatic parts of the patch, so I can review that script instead of its output (which is much more).

Remainder: the current spkg does not take #14268 into account, anyway it is not merged yet, so could rather be rebased on top of this ticket.
For an spkg based on #14268, look at the links at comment 229: http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12173#comment:229.

Nor do I.
Latest info I remember is from:
* https://groups.google.com/d/msg/flint-devel/lmRdEPV6el8/TjHd0NzSOWsJ
* https://groups.google.com/d/msg/flint-devel/lmRdEPV6el8/JNbZ4eTy_n0J
but it seems Julien is aware of that.

Anyway, this should be dealt with at #11792.

* fix the punctured original patch by hand, and especially, completely reorder the nmod_poly.pxd part so that it can be read by a human;

Indeed, some pieces went missing or were inadvertently added.
* sage/ext/gen_interpreters.py, spurious case change not fixed in the "fixes" patch, so this hunk is needed;
* sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures_pxd.pxi, I missed this one, we should modify "s|sage\.libs\.flint\.long_extras|sage.libs.flint.ulong_extras|g" in the script by omitting the "sage.libs" part
* sage/libs/flint/fmpq_poly.pxd, ignore this hunk, it just adds a spurious newline
* sage/libs/flint/fmpz_poly.pxi, the first hunk is needed, not sure where it went; the second hunk is more or less moving lines, in fact we could even order the lines better; the third hunk was plain wrong and now defines twice "fmpz_poly_scalar_fdiv_ui", so the solution is to remove that line completely.
* sage/libs/flint/ntl_interface.pxd, should be applied; ZZ_limbs does not exists anymore, and in fact the previous declaration of fmpz_to_mpz here was misplaced... even though fmpz_get_ZZ is unused, its place is here so the all in one patch is right.
* sage/modular/modform/eis_series.py, discard this hunk, we forgot to rename a zmod to nmod before (within a comment).

An additional change would make sense:
* sage/libs/flint/fmpz_poly.pxi: replace "fmpz_t fmpz_poly_get_coeff_ptr" by "fmpz* fmpz_poly_get_coeff_ptr", and maybe remove the commented out line (fmpz_poly_scalar_mul), cleanup spaces

Nevermind, that won't fix the problem.
We should rather add "s|flint/long_extras\.h|flint/ulong_extras\.h|g".
I'm taking care of that and other fixes now.

Should be fixed now, I'm getting lost on what versions of everything I actually use now.

Apart from the suggestion you had not inlcuded yet,
I only modified the "fixes" patch including new cosmetic changes to "fmpz_poly.pxi".
The v6 is based on the v5 you posted (and that I hopefully got the right version of and did not mess with some versions I crafted earlier).

I also remove a blank line at the top of sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures_pxd.pxi and break a long line in fmpq_poly.pxd.
That should be all.

I did not split long lines in nmod_poly.pxd, there are too many of them and that would not be so useful and the patch would be even less readable, so unless someone really want that we conform strictly to our coding guidelines in that file, I won't do it.

The following is quite strange:

```
Configuring FLINT.
Configuring...x86_64-Linux
Testing __builtin_popcountl...yes
Testing native popcount..../configure : ligne 315 :  8361 Instruction non permise build/test-popcnt > /dev/null 2>&1
no
Building FLINT shared library.
```

The configure script *dies*, but the result is still zero, so spkg-install still starts to compile!

Notice that the death of the configure script is present in upstream's 2.3 and today's git checkout, so it's not sage-specific.

I have tried to get more information about it : on x86_64, compiling with -mpopcnt works, but running the resulting test file raises an illegal instruction... which kills the configure script without error (!).

I still haven't reported upstream because I saw the problem while testing the spkg in this report. You'll have to actually look at your spkg/logs/flint-2.3.p0.log to see the problem, because the package compiles perfectly.

Are you sure about this? I'm pretty sure it's not the `configure` script which dies, but a subprogram started by `configure` to test popcount. The `test-popcnt` program dies a horrible death and `configure` correctly concludes (note the "no") there is no popcount support.

Confirmed with `GNU bash, version 4.2.37(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)`

But really, the bug is just that

```
./configure : ligne 315 :  8361 Illegal instruction build/test-popcnt > /dev/null 2>&1
```
is displayed.

Imagine the output simply says

```
Configuring FLINT.
Configuring...x86_64-Linux

Testing native popcount... no
Building FLINT shared library.
```

I think the auto normalizaiton thing has nothing to do with FLINT, it something with the Sage code used.

The fact that the output of the doctests slightly changed, is because FLINT now deals with fractions a little differently and is better at normalizing the output (less minus signs), but that's not the same normalization as the one quoted in the comment I think.

Here are some comments after reading [attachment:trac_12173-fixes-v6.patch.](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12173/trac_12173-fixes-v6.patch.)

`nmod_poly_pow(..., 2)` should be used below instead of `nmod_poly_mul()`.

Is this necessary? If the input is normalized, the denominator will have 1 as a leading coefficient anyway. If we really want to normalize, the `normalize()` method in the same file should be used.

Indeed, this looks wrong.
This also shows this function does not seem to be well tested.

I think the best place for such a function would be in FLINT itself.
The problem is that if we plan on integrating this ticket without calling this to be implemented function (I'd prefer to go this way, let's not wait for another couple of monthes/years to merge this ticket), we should make sure to not forget to call it from Sage when it actually gets implemented in (a stable release of) FLINT, so we should surely open a follow-up ticket.

Any chance to get the FLINt build log? (and to know what file it produced? libflint.dylib i presume.)
And some "otool -L" output on integer.so?
(By the way is it expected that the cython produced file end in .so and not in .dylib on Mac OS?)

The function used to be three lines of calls to FLINT C functions, so it should be trivial to add to FLINT 2 (although refactoring the nmod_poly_sqrt function so that it uses the _check function in a proper way could need (a little) more thoughts).
Therefore, what I'd prefer to do is to push something on github and let Bill pull it to FLINT's trunk.
And we should then use this backported patch in our spkg.
So when this gets into a stable version of FLINT, we'll only have to update the spkg and delete the patch.
Same feeling for the underscore set_ui method.
>I'd really like to get this ticket resolved by the end of the week.

Ok, here comes a new patch to apply taking Burcin's review into account.

The spkg at the previous address has been updated to include the fix for PowerPC G5.
It's being discussed upstream and should get in at some point.

I'm starting a "make ptestlong" right now on top of 5.10.beta1 (already tested some files directly related to FLINT).

In fact I'd prefer that FLINT gets its flags from gmp/mpfr if CFLAGS is empty and does not do anything if not.
