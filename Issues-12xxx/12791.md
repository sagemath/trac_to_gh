<a id='comment:8'></a>Yes, the code was... to be fully rewritten. It was the same for patch #12770 in which the example I gave was impossible to run with original code. 

With your review patch the doc is well displayed. So the patch is also good to go for me.

However, I don't understand the dependency with patch #12770 since I can install this patch independently of patch #12770.

I let you conclude on this patch.
