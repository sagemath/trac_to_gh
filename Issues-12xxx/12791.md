My GOD ! This code really needed to be rewritten `:-D`

Ok, the patch is good to go, but I just add a few modifications so that the math in the documentation appear as maths in the HTML file.

Yes, the code was... to be fully rewritten. It was the same for patch #12770 in which the example I gave was impossible to run with original code. 

With your review patch the doc is well displayed. So the patch is also good to go for me.

However, I don't understand the dependency with patch #12770 since I can install this patch independently of patch #12770.

I let you conclude on this patch.

Oh well, you mentionned it in the ticket and I thought it was better to apply this patch after the other one (can the other one be applied after this one, though ?) 

Anyway it does not change much, as both of them are now... reviewed `:-)`
