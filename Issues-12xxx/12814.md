To fix upgrading from versions of Sage which still have the `spkg/base` repository and which have prereq-0.9, we should add `prereq-0.9-install` to `.hgignore` in the root repository, just like we already do for `prereq-0.7-install` and `prereq-0.8-install`.

This is needed since #12112 upgraded prereq to prereq-1.0, so the root repo doesn't contain `spkg/base/prereq-0.9-install` anymore.

**Apply** [attachment: 12814_prereq_hgignore.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12814/12814_prereq_hgignore.patch.gz) to the SAGE_ROOT repository.
