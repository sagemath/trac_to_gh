On OS X Lion, if you set `SAGE_CHECK=yes` and build cvxopt, some tests fail and then it hangs before completing the tests.  See [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/cvxopt-1.1.3.log](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/cvxopt-1.1.3.log) for the install log.

CVXOPT devs claimed that Apple shipped a broken BLAS. But it turned out that they cannot provide valid examples showing this; they did not adhere to a de facto BLAS standard, and they agreed to fix the corresponding CVXOPT bug quickly.

This spkg also fixes an issue building with GCC on Solaris 10.  There already was a fix for this in the spkg, but it was only enabled for GCC versions < 4.5 (without any mention of why).  Enable this fix for all GCC versions.

I just asked  upstream [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cvxopt/cTZo0LYDo0c/PekNsa2yP-IJ).
Is there a way to get access to 10.7 for me?

[here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cvxopt/cTZo0LYDo0c/T2gs1V7gyygJ) it is written that it's probably a bug in Apple's blas/lapack. A workaround is to use Atlas. I have no way to check this at the moment, but it looks very reasonable to me.

It would be great if you tested this with the newest Xcode...

Actually, if I recall right, this (native lapack/blas) is an artefact of the PPC support. We can perfectly well use Atlas

Should we also provide Atlas on 10.6 ?

Does this imply we have to build ATLAS+LAPACK on *every* system (we used to build LAPACK on every system)?  Not saying this is a bad thing, just asking...

Putting `lapack` in patches is just weird, you should probably distribute it extracted (either inside `src` or in a `lapack` top-level directory in the spkg).

hmm, all? 
Are we dropping OSX PPC support? IMHO Atlas doesn't run on OSX PPC. Also, I don't think we build Atlas on ARM.
(And Linux ARM support sort of works, it's matter of just a little bit more work)

I think we have some more work to do until we can ship the new atlas on any system, you are a bit premature in discussing how to support old systems.

The only way to be sure that you don't have statically linked to another blas is to build Sage from source with the new atlas spkg. This doesn't add much overhead over building atlas.

Also, the atlas shared libraries are now named `lib{t,s}atlas.{so,dylib}` for threaded/singlethreaded and unix/osx respectively. We need to change `modules_list.py` and `sage/misc/cython.py` to actually use the new libraries. How about one of you with an actual OSX machine makes these config changes.

Also, on Linux I'm getting

```
/home/vbraun/opt/sage-atlas/sage-5.0.beta7/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/linalg/lapack_lite.so: undefined symbol: dpotrf_

when installing scipy. I'll try to track this down.

Which lapack version are you using in the package. We had quite a few problem of that kind in Gentoo and Sebastien Fabbro (the package maintainer of atlas) did go from
lapack-3.4.0_p20120215 back to lapack-3.4.0 to solve the problem.

 CVXOPT devs claimed that Apple shipped a broken BLAS. But it turned out that they cannot provide valid examples showing this; they did not adhere to a de facto BLAS standard, and they agreed to fix the corresponding CVXOPT bug quickly.
