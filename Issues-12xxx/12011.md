On OS X Lion, if you set `SAGE_CHECK=yes` and build cvxopt, some tests fail and then it hangs before completing the tests.  See [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/cvxopt-1.1.3.log](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/cvxopt-1.1.3.log) for the install log.

CVXOPT devs claimed that Apple shipped a broken BLAS. But it turned out that they cannot provide valid examples showing this; they did not adhere to a de facto BLAS standard, and they agreed to fix the corresponding CVXOPT bug quickly.

This spkg also fixes an issue building with GCC on Solaris 10.  There already was a fix for this in the spkg, but it was only enabled for GCC versions < 4.5 (without any mention of why).  Enable this fix for all GCC versions.

I just asked  upstream [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cvxopt/cTZo0LYDo0c/PekNsa2yP-IJ).
Is there a way to get access to 10.7 for me?

[here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cvxopt/cTZo0LYDo0c/T2gs1V7gyygJ) it is written that it's probably a bug in Apple's blas/lapack. A workaround is to use Atlas. I have no way to check this at the moment, but it looks very reasonable to me.

It would be great if you tested this with the newest Xcode...

Well, no. We need to build ATLAS spkg (or get some other non-Apple lapack/blas somehow) and use it.
Actually, if I recall right, this (native lapack/blas) is an artefact of the PPC support. We can perfectly well use Atlas
on x86, right?

Does this imply we have to build ATLAS+LAPACK on *every* system (we used to build LAPACK on every system)?  Not saying this is a bad thing, just asking...

Putting `lapack` in patches is just weird, you should probably distribute it extracted (either inside `src` or in a `lapack` top-level directory in the spkg).

hmm, all? 
Are we dropping OSX PPC support? IMHO Atlas doesn't run on OSX PPC. Also, I don't think we build Atlas on ARM.
(And Linux ARM support sort of works, it's matter of just a little bit more work)

Which lapack version are you using in the package. We had quite a few problem of that kind in Gentoo and Sebastien Fabbro (the package maintainer of atlas) did go from
lapack-3.4.0_p20120215 back to lapack-3.4.0 to solve the problem.

<a id='comment:58'></a>I'm posting a new spkg, but not a perfect one. The flaw is that it is version 1.1.4 rather than 1.1.5. I looked at 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, and (using `diff -r ...`) I found two changes in the code: the file `src/C/dense.c` was modified, and I imported that change into the 1.1.4 spkg. With this change, it builds and self-tests pass on OS X Lion, and also on sage.math and OpenSolaris. So that's the version I'm posting here.

The other change was to `setup.py`, and I don't understand enough of the changes in our patch to modify it. That is, `setup.py` in version 1.1.4 was almost identical to the version in 1.1.3, so it was easy to rebase our patch, but I couldn't figure out how to rebase to 1.1.5. C'est la vie.
