It seems that substitution inside coefficients of a polynomial forgets to change the dominant term :

```
sage: rng=PolynomialRing(QQ,'q')
sage: q=rng.gen()
sage: x=PolynomialRing(rng,'x').gen()
sage: po=q+(1+q)*x+(1+q+q**2)*x**2+(2+q)*x**3
sage: po(q=1)
(q + 2)*x^3 + 3*x^2 + 2*x + 1
```

Same behaviour in 4.8 and 5.0rc0

Fixed by #3979.
