His modified version is much, much clearer as a definition.  It's closer to what you find if you look in more general commutative algebra books.   What was there before -- writing as N/D -- is more algorithmic, and requires one to be in the special situation of Dedekind domain where unique factorization of ideals holds.

I guess you mean "elements of R", otherwise the denominator of 2 would be (1/2).
