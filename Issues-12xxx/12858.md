In util.c there is a function free_data, which frees TACKS[0].  TACKS[0] is meant to be allocated in disk.c, but there are circumstances when TACKS[0] is not allocated.

The following patch seems to fix it.  Notice that it makes use of the fact that free(NULL) should do nothing in the C programming language.

Needs an spkg.  I'm sorry that I do not know enough about allocations to review this.   

Is there any way to doctest this, just out of curiosity?

I don't think this error only effects BSD.  Rather I think it is an error that only happens very rarely, and I got unlucky.

Also, I seem to have missed the message posted 10 months ago.  What do you mean by "doctest"?

Sorry about that.

"doctest" means that whenever we have a regression that we fix, we add a test to the suite of tests to check that it stays fixed.  Is there a command that failed or leaked, or did Sage simply fail to compile this spkg?

OK, I did find this error with a doctest.  I don't remember which doctest it was, but it was quite a few of them.

But I think it depends on the computer you are using, OS, probably amount of RAM, other processes, etc.  In my case it failed an existing doctest on one computer, and passed on other computers.

But also, anyone who understands how malloc and free work should see instantly that the existing code has errors.

See `man 3 free` on any unix computer, e.g. on ubuntu:

```
       The free() function frees the memory space pointed  to  by  ptr,  which
       must  have  been  returned  by a previous call to malloc(), calloc() or
       realloc().  Otherwise, or if free(ptr) has already been called  before,
       undefined behavior occurs.  If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.

If you wouldn't mind terribly just undoing this patch and seeing which one it was, then we could add a nearly trivial patch adding a comment to that doctest saying `also tests that :trac:`12858` is fixed` or something like that.

Since I don't really know C, I don't :)  But presumably many other Sage developers do...

The problem here is that sympow is not even legal C. We had that conversation a while ago with David Kirkby that sympow was probably by far the worst piece of code in sage and it couldn't even be entered in "the obfuscated C contest" since some bits are not even legal C.

this "fix" replaces a wrong attempt to free memory held (a bit wrongly, as some pointers that by right should be NULL are not always, as found on this ticket) in an array of pointers by no freeing at all.

This is of course fine if there are only created once during a run of the code, and this appears to be the case.
