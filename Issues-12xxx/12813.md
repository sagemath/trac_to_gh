implicit_plot3d allows for a region to be specified. No such option exists for implicit_plot. The attached patch provides this option in contour_plot (and therefore in implicit_plot). This is achieved using a feature of matplotlib: masked entries in an array are not plotted.

I added a doctest, but I am not totally sure if sage is actually building it, since my installation seems to be acting up.

I also was wrong about the required form of the region function, but I think the new
documentation should clear that up.
