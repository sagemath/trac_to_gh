I added a doctest, but I am not totally sure if sage is actually building it, since my installation seems to be acting up.

I also was wrong about the required form of the region function, but I think the new

Nice!  I rebased the patch to sage 5.0beta12, and removed the trac number from the commit message (it's added in automatically when the patch is merged).  Passes tests, the code looks good, and adds nice functionality!  Thanks!
