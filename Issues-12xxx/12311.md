#11073 changes the location of `testcc.sh` and `testcxx.sh` to `spkg/bin`.  The following spkgs refer explicitly to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/testcc.sh`:
* singular (fixed by #12562)
* cliquer (also change the path to `sage-env` in a comment in `Makefile.patch`)
* rubiks
* sympow (fixed by #11920)

The following spkgs have `testcc.sh` included in the spkg:
* libm4ri
* libm4rie (fixed by #12501)

`testcxx.sh` is never used.

Changing these spkgs should allow us to stop copying `testcc.sh` and `testcxx.sh` from `spkg/bin` to `local/bin` in #12631.
