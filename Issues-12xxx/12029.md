I think the following is too slow:

```
sage: from sage.structure.list_clone import IncreasingIntArrays
sage: I = IncreasingIntArrays()(range(1000))
sage: timeit("L = list(I)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 41.8 µs per loop
```

My patch adds a method `.list()` (I hope this is the fastest way of converting a C-int array into a Python list - Cython experts are welcome to find something better), and it adds an `__iter__()` method that relies on the `.list()` method.

Note that I tried to have an `__iter__` method that does not call `list()` but works on the C-array (this is now possible with the new Cython version), but it turned out to be not faster.

Here are the timings with my patch

```
sage: from sage.structure.list_clone import IncreasingIntArrays
sage: I = IncreasingIntArrays()(range(1000))
sage: timeit("L = I.list()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 19.4 µs per loop
sage: timeit("L = list(I)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 32.9 µs per loop
```

Hi Simon,

A few remarks:

- The `.list()` method is not a Python convention, it is a Sage-Combinat (and maybe Sage) convention. Isn't it ?

- Since the new Cython allows it. Did you try to define an iterator (using yield) without relying on the list ? It could be faster.

- Also I'm not sure using append to build the list is a good idea (due to possible reallocation). Si you know the list length from the beginning, why not allocation the list and filling it with a loop ? I'm not sure if it is doable optimally in Cython without using the C-API function `PyList_New` and the macro `PyList_SETITEM`.

Yes. But there are different places in Sage where `.list()` is used, and I think if there is a faster way to return a list than via an iterator then it should at least be offered.

> - Since the new Cython allows it. Did you try to define an iterator (using yield) without relying on the list ? It could be faster.

As I stated in the ticket description: I did try, and it was not faster. To be concrete: Here is the code that I tested.

```python
    def __iter__(self):
        """
        Iterate over the items of self.
        ...
        """
        cdef int i
        for i from 0<=i<self._len:
            yield self._list[i]
```
And here is the benchmark:

```
sage: from sage.structure.list_clone import IncreasingIntArrays
sage: I = IncreasingIntArrays()(range(1000))
sage: timeit("L = list(I)", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 34.3 µs per loop
```
 
> - Also I'm not sure using append to build the list is a good idea (due to possible reallocation).

Appending to a list - if the list is cdefined - is a very quick operation in Cython.

> Si you know the list length from the beginning, why not allocation the list and filling it with a loop ?

Can one allocate a Python list without filling it?

From the C-API you can do it. Of course you must fill it (at least with None(s)) before returning it to python. See
http://docs.python.org/c-api/list.html and in particular the note after `PyList_New`. I don't know if it is doable directly in Cython without calling the C-API.

Hi Simon !

Sorry for replying to myself but I should have said from the very beginning
that I'm not a Cython expert ! I'm currently trying the `PyList_New`
version.

Hi Simon,

If correct with respect to memory management, I uploaded a patch which when
applied over yours gains some more speed:

This is before my patch:

```
sage: from sage.structure.list_clone import IncreasingIntArrays
sage: I = IncreasingIntArrays()(range(1000))
sage: timeit("L = I.list()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 18.1 µs per loop
```

This is after my patch:

```
sage: from sage.structure.list_clone import IncreasingIntArrays
sage: I = IncreasingIntArrays()(range(1000))
sage: timeit("L = I.list()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 14 µs per loop
```

So this is more 20 percents faster... After having a Cython expert check the
reference counting stuff, this is probably worth including.

What do you think ?

Cheers,

Florent

I just got confirmation (on cython-users) that INCREF is correct where I put it.

I was putting the INCREF in precisely the same location as you did. Only difference to the code that I tried (getting segfaults): You did `PyInt_FromLong` before that. And I don't see why that conversion prevents the segfault.

Just before I go to bed, Mark Florisson noticed on cython-users that

    return [self._list[i] for i in range(self._len)]

Should be as fast as the former append version.

Attachment: **[list_speedup.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12029/list_speedup.patch.gz)**

Hi Simon,

Looking at the C code I figured out that replacing

```
cdef list L = PyList_New(self._len)
```
by

```
cdef list L = <list> PyList_New(self._len)
```
allows to gain a few more speed:

```
sage: %timeit I.list()
625 loops, best of 3: 13 µs per loop
```
So one less microsecond. Can you fold my patch and review it. I'm Ok with your changes.

Cheers,

Florent
