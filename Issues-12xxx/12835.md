Sage still ships fpLLL 3.0.12 (we upgraded to 3.0.12 in May 2009!) but fpLLL 4.0.4 is out, which includes an implementation of BKZ.

Use spkg at:
* http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/spkg/libfplll-4.0.4.spkg

Apply to Sage library:

I just checked it won't be painless :
sage/libs/fplll/fplll.cpp:243:24: fatal error: fplll/fast.h: No such file or directory

From what I see in upstream's sources:
* wrapper.h still exists, but isn't installed ;
* fast.h, fast_earlyred.h, heuristic.h, heuristic_early_red.h and proved.h don't exist anymore, but there's a fplllv31.h which provides a compatibility layer to version 3.1 (which is more recent than what sage has... so perhaps even that isn't enough!)

There are two points to be made here :
* I had a better look, and saw wrapper.h's previous features seem to be in fplllv31.h ; but I can't find the "proved" class anywhere. In fact, choosing which method will be used is now done through an enum instead of different classes as far as I see. So indeed a pure rewrite would be the saner route.
* Apparently, changing the sage-5.1.beta5.spkg and using "sage -f" on it isn't enough : generally sage extracts the spkg in spkg/build/ but really builds sources it copied some previous time in devel/sage/ -- I haven't gotten the logic of it down.

All in all, that makes working on this pretty painful : I'll pass!

I made sagemath 5.4.beta1 experimental rpm packages for fedora rawhide, patching both fplll and sagemath.

The only issue I noticed so far was:

```

Replying to [Snark](#comment%3A10):
> I would like to see this go through : should I contact upstream myself?

Yup you should.
I was in contact with Damien StelhÃ© around Christmas for #13354 and he included the fix I wanted in a to be released version.
But when testing it I discovered other problems and got no reply so far.
I must admit I did not ping him since the 30th of January...

So if you could also ask him for the last changes which were needed for Cygwin :)

It's so in the upstream tarball (not released yet, but its also the same in the 4.0.3 released one and the 3.1.3 one, though is correct in the really old 3.0.12).
If you are really worried about this, I (or you) can report it upstream.
