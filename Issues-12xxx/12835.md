I just checked it won't be painless :
sage/libs/fplll/fplll.cpp:243:24: fatal error: fplll/fast.h: No such file or directory

From what I see in upstream's sources:
* wrapper.h still exists, but isn't installed ;
* fast.h, fast_earlyred.h, heuristic.h, heuristic_early_red.h and proved.h don't exist anymore, but there's a fplllv31.h which provides a compatibility layer to version 3.1 (which is more recent than what sage has... so perhaps even that isn't enough!)

There are two points to be made here :
* I had a better look, and saw wrapper.h's previous features seem to be in fplllv31.h ; but I can't find the "proved" class anywhere. In fact, choosing which method will be used is now done through an enum instead of different classes as far as I see. So indeed a pure rewrite would be the saner route.
* Apparently, changing the sage-5.1.beta5.spkg and using "sage -f" on it isn't enough : generally sage extracts the spkg in spkg/build/ but really builds sources it copied some previous time in devel/sage/ -- I haven't gotten the logic of it down.

All in all, that makes working on this pretty painful : I'll pass!

I made sagemath 5.4.beta1 experimental rpm packages for fedora rawhide, patching both fplll and sagemath.

The only issue I noticed so far was:

```
$ rpm -q sagemath libfplll
sagemath-5.4.beta1-1.fc19.x86_64
libfplll-4.0.1-2.fc19.x86_64

Replying to [Snark](#comment%3A10):
> I would like to see this go through : should I contact upstream myself?

Yup you should.
I was in contact with Damien Stelhé around Christmas for #13354 and he included the fix I wanted in a to be released version.
But when testing it I discovered other problems and got no reply so far.
I must admit I did not ping him since the 30th of January...

So if you could also ask him for the last changes which were needed for Cygwin :)
