singular does not fully respect the global CXX flag, we should fix this (for instance for #12426).

I've posted an spkg fixes this (and #12442) at
[http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/singular-3-1-3-3.p5.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/singular-3-1-3-3.p5.spkg). (This is a review spkg in case there are more issues with clang down the road.)

Duplicate of #12680.

Ooops, didn't see this ticket (as it was not listed on #2999 / #3000).

Since #12680 has meanwhile been merged into Sage 5.0.beta9, we should close this.  Sorry.
