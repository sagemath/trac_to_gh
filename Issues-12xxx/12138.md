John, could you please test both the old and new zlib spkgs using

```
MAKEFLAGS="j8" ./sage -f zlib...
```

(or some other value of j)

On Linux, I do not manage to reproduce the issue.

Managed to reproduce anyway with the old zlib on sage.math, not with the new one here.  So looks good, but needs formal review.
