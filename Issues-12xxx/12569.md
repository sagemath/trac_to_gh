Hello,

could you please add documentation to the first function ? one indirect doctest would be fine, for example,

```
EXAMPLES:: 	 
    sage: Permutation([2, 1, 4, 5, 3]).right_permutohedron_interval(Permutation([2, 5, 4, 1, 3])) # indirect doctest
    [[2, 1, 4, 5, 3], [2, 1, 5, 4, 3], [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], [2, 4, 5, 1, 3], [2, 5, 1, 4, 3], [2, 5, 4, 1, 3]] 
```

then the bot will be happy.
Cheers,

F

But Sphinx, the documentation generator, will be disturbed if you don't put a
blank line after `EXAMPLE::`. So the correct markup is:

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: Permutation([2, 1, 4, 5, 3]).right_permutohedron_interval(Permutation([2, 5, 4, 1, 3])) # indirect doctest
    [[2, 1, 4, 5, 3], [2, 1, 5, 4, 3], [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], [2, 4, 5, 1, 3], [2, 5, 1, 4, 3], [2, 5, 4, 1, 3]]

Same remark as in #12571 : could you add those new methods to the index ? Besides, wouldn't it be possible to also call "inverse" in the second `add_edge(...)` line ?

Oh, yeah... Ad wouldn't it make sense to update `inversions` to index its results from 1 to n instead of 0 to n-1, assuming nobody agrees that permutations should themselves go from 0 to n-1 ?

Here is a new patch.

I have changed the behavior of inversions, also improving very slightly its speed. Let us see if this causes problems elsewhere.

I do not think one can use .inverse in the second add_edge line

I have added both methods to the index

I have taken the opportunity to make a very light clean up (using pyflakes to remove a few unused import and unused variables)

No, it is a computation of 'not inversions' in fact.

It seems that the change of the behaviour inversions triggers a few doc tests in the rest of sage.. Some in graphs stuff, see the bot report.

Helloooooooooooooooo !!!

I again spent a couple of minutes trying to check if there was anything wrong with the graph whose linear extensions you return, but modulo the fact that I am biologically unable to check if it is not "left" instead of "right" and which is the largest among 12 and 21, everything seems good `:-D`

Good to go !
