All classes that currently inherit from `CombinatorialClass` should instead inherit from Parent and register themselves in one of the categories (`*EnumeratedSets`, `*FiniteEnumeratedSets`, or `*InfiniteEnumeratedSets`). For examples, see e.g. `FiniteEnumeratedSets().example()`.


* Expected benefits:
  * Uniform interface
  * Support for TestSuite
  * Support for conversions, coercions, and morphisms, in particular for bijections (as morphisms in the category of Sets with bijection, with properly defined domain and co-domain rather than python functions).
* Steps:
  1. Let `CombinatorialClass` inherits from `Parent` (mostly done #8910)
  2. For each `CombinatorialClass` C:
    * Have C inherit directly from `Parent`
    * Ensure that `C.__init__` sets up the proper category (Finite|Infinite)...
    * Add `TestSuite(C).run()` to the doctests and make all the tests pass
    * Have a properly setup attribute `C.Element` and use `C.element_class` (as defined by the categories) when constructing elements
    * Ensure proper unique representation behavior by having C inherit both from `UniqueRepresentation` and `Parent`
  3. Deprecate and remove `CombinatorialClass`
  4. Turn all the factory functions into factory classes by mean of `ClasscallMetaClass`; see `PerfectMatching` and `Trees` for an advanced example.

<a id='comment:11'></a>That's actually slightly worse than I thought, but it is good progress. I suspect most of them should be easy changes. From a quick look:

```
src/sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realizations.py
```
is easy to fix as per the comment there (which really moves the issue to the `EnumeratedSets` category).

However

```
src/sage/combinat/symmetric_group_representations.py
```
is harder as the `CombinatorialClass` is behaving something between a category and a parent. At least its elements are morphisms from the SGA to a matrix space, but not with the same codomain. Also, I think of a representation as a vector space with an action together. Well, representation theory in Sage is sorely lacking currently and is something I've only been able to work on in a limited capacity so far.
