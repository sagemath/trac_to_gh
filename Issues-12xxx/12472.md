Currently using an asm redc breaks building ECM when compiling with clang; we should disable this when clang is used until it is fixed.

I've posted an spkg at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/ecm-6.3.p4.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/ecm-6.3.p4.spkg).

We should IMHO disable this *conditionally*, depending on the compiler used.

Don't know whether you've already rebased your spkg on that of #12501.

Btw., upgrading to GMP-ECM 6.4.2 "is recommended" :-) (by Paul Zimmermann).

Is this issue still valid? In any case, it needs to be rebased to ECM 6.4.4 (#14151).

It seems GMP-ECM 6.4.4('s `configure`) no longer supports `--disable-asm-redc`, but only `--enable-asm-redc=no` (for whatever reason, haven't investigated why).

FWIW, I immediately get "Illegal instruction" in `make check` regardless of the setting; this is with an older svn version of `clang` though (clang version 3.1 (trunk 155201)).

Yep, my svn version appears to be broken somehow.

Still, `--disable-asm-redc` doesn't work.

Works for me with clang 3.2, too, even with `--enable-asm-redc` (the default) on Linux x86_64; `make check` as well as all (long) doctests in `sage/libs/libecm.py` passed.
