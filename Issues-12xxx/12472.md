Don't know whether you've already rebased your spkg on that of #12501.

Btw., upgrading to GMP-ECM 6.4.2 "is recommended" :-) (by Paul Zimmermann).

Works for me with clang 3.2, too, even with `--enable-asm-redc` (the default) on Linux x86_64; `make check` as well as all (long) doctests in `sage/libs/libecm.py` passed.
