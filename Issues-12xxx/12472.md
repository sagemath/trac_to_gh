We should IMHO disable this *conditionally*, depending on the compiler used.

Don't know whether you've already rebased your spkg on that of #12501.

Btw., upgrading to GMP-ECM 6.4.2 "is recommended" :-) (by Paul Zimmermann).

Now needs to be rebased on the GMP-ECM 6.3.p7 spkg from #12830.

I also have a -- still preliminary -- p8 related to #11705, i.e., fixing the asm redc code for dynamic linking on Linux PPC64 (which now probably also needs its own ticket...)

Is this issue still valid? In any case, it needs to be rebased to ECM 6.4.4 (#14151).

Also: has upstream been contacted?

It seems GMP-ECM 6.4.4('s `configure`) no longer supports `--disable-asm-redc`, but only `--enable-asm-redc=no` (for whatever reason, haven't investigated why).

FWIW, I immediately get "Illegal instruction" in `make check` regardless of the setting; this is with an older svn version of `clang` though (clang version 3.1 (trunk 155201)).

Yep, my svn version appears to be broken somehow.

Still, `--disable-asm-redc` doesn't work.

Works for me with clang 3.2, too, even with `--enable-asm-redc` (the default) on Linux x86_64; `make check` as well as all (long) doctests in `sage/libs/libecm.py` passed.
