The test

```
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "--ipython"], "\n3**33\n")
        sage: out.find("5559060566555523") >= 0
        True
```
fails if people have installed a newer version (0.12?) of ipython which leaves incompatible files in `~/ipython/`. We might consider setting `IPYTHONDIR` to `$DOT_SAGE/ipython/` in `sage-env`, but the simplest fix seems to be to do this right before running the test.

Test this by running `sage --ipython` to create config files in `~/ipython/`. Then edit `~/ipython/ipy_user_conf.py` to (for example) make it invalid Python, so it prints an error when you start `sage --ipython`. Then doctest the file `cmdline.py` before and after applying the patch.

The doctest shouldn't leave any extra files lying around: on startup, Sage should create `DOT_SAGE/ipython/` (if it doesn't exist already) and populate it with various files. From the main `sage` script (`SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage`):

```
    IPYTHONDIR="$DOT_SAGE/ipython" && export IPYTHONDIR
    IPYTHONRC="ipythonrc" && export IPYTHONRC
    if [ ! -d "$IPYTHONDIR" ]; then
        mkdir -p "$DOT_SAGE"
        cp -r "$SAGE_ROOT/ipython" "$DOT_SAGE/"
    fi
```
Running the doctest shouldn't create anything new, just use the already-present config files.
