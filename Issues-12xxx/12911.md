The test

```
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "--ipython"], "\n3**33\n")
        sage: out.find("5559060566555523") >= 0
        True
```
fails if people have installed a newer version (0.12?) of ipython which leaves incompatible files in `~/ipython/`. We might consider setting `IPYTHONDIR` to `$DOT_SAGE/ipython/` in `sage-env`, but the simplest fix seems to be to do this right before running the test.

Test this by running `sage --ipython` to create config files in `~/ipython/`. Then edit `~/ipython/ipy_user_conf.py` to (for example) make it invalid Python, so it prints an error when you start `sage --ipython`. Then doctest the file `cmdline.py` before and after applying the patch.

Oh, wait; rereading your description makes it seem like the problem is if they have a system 0.12, but Sage's 0.10, that causes a problem.

So installing #12719 won't solve the problem by itself, since modifying the global config file to be invalid python still would cause problems.  However, perhaps the IPython config directory should be set to a temporary directory that can be deleted after the doctest is run?

The doctest shouldn't leave any extra files lying around: on startup, Sage should create `DOT_SAGE/ipython/` (if it doesn't exist already) and populate it with various files. From the main `sage` script (`SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage`):

```

    IPYTHONRC="ipythonrc" && export IPYTHONRC

        mkdir -p "$DOT_SAGE"
        cp -r "$SAGE_ROOT/ipython" "$DOT_SAGE/"
    fi
```
Running the doctest shouldn't create anything new, just use the already-present config files.
