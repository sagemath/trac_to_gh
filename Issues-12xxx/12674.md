the method *length* of permutations returns the Coxeter length and not the length of the permutation as a word (which is the most natural notion of length for some part of the community). This is not a problem but this is not precised in the documentation and in the example given, the two notions of length match!

I will write a small patch to change the example and add another method *size*
