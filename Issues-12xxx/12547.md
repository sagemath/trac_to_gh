Currently single variable inequalities in `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` are more or less "ignored." So if one enters something like

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: b = p.new_variable()
sage: p.add_constraint( -1 <= b[0] )
sage: p.add_constraint( b[0] <= 2 )
sage: p.show()
Maximization:
 
Constraints:
  x_0 <= 2.0
Variables:
  x_0 is a continuous variable (min=0.0, max=+oo)
```
As evident from the above code, the min and the max of the variable have not been changed and so the lower bound on `b[0]` will be simply ignored by the optimization.

The method `add_constraint` should automatically set the min and the max if it detects that there is only one variable in the constraint.

Depends on #12546

Hellooooooooooo !!

This problem has already been reported in #12091. Besides, there is *no reason on earth why Sage should change lower bounds because of constraints*. This would be *VERY* bad. I mean, which kind of behaviour is that ? If you add two constraints, one loser than the first, the solver should only remember the losest one ? Or only when it is "one variable" and "its lower bound" ?

The thing about constraints is that they are generated from a specific problem. If for some unknown reason the constraints generated are of the form "b[i] >= -2" the LP would now let b[i] have negative values, and that's just NOT what was intended.

Plus it's not really like this is some specificity of Sage. ALL (no exceptions) LP solvers work this way.

Agree with Nathann, close as wontfix.

Sage should not magically change a constraint like `x[0] >= 2` to change the minimum of `x[0]`. Constraints and minima/maxima of variables are independent things and should stay independent. Moreover, the proposal here is incompatible with `p.remove_constraint()`.

From reading the ticket description, that wasn't the main issue of this ticket, that was just once sentence at the end. To clarify this, I removed that sentence and re-closed this ticket as "wontfix" instead.
