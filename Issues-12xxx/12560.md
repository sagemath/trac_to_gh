<a id='comment:2'></a>Two points, one trivial and one not:

(1) Shouldn't it be "Artin-Hasse exponential" and not "Artin Hasse Exponential"?

(2) There really aren't any tests which demonstrate that what the function returns is actually the A-H exp, as opposed to some other similar-looking element in the ring.  Probably there should be something in TESTS: which verifies some known properties.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Mostly good; here are some issues to fix.

* When `prec=0`, the precision should be taken from the precision of the element rather than the precision cap of the parent (the process of finding the right precision may be more involved than just copying the precision of the element; I haven't thought about what the right precision should be in terms of the derivative of the artin-hasse exponential).
* When `prec=1`, the resulting p-adic element should have absolute precision 1, not the precision equal to the precision cap of the parent (probably `self.parent(c)` should be `self.parent()(c,1)`).
* It would be good to have the reference to Thm 2.5 of Conrad's notes in the docstring.
* It would be nice to have a test along the lines of

```
sage: x = 3*Zp(3,30).random_element()
sage: x.artin_hass_exp() == (sum(x^(p^i)/p^i for i in range(5)).exp()
True
```

Thanks for reviving the ticket though!

<a id='comment:22'></a>I think that precision is fine.

Small other remarks:
- Shouldn't we cpdef the function `artin_hasse_exp`?
- Why do we need an external function `floorlogp`? Shouldn't we integrate it directy in `artin_hasse_exp` (and actually not call it at each iteration of the main loop)? 
- I would use `None` instead of `0` for the default of `prec`
- It is enough to evaluate the Artin-Hasse series up to `prec/self.valuation()`
- Shouldn't we cache the coefficients of the Artin-Hasse series and/or only compute them modulo `pi^prec`?

By the way, I think I can imagine faster algorithms for computing the Artin-Hasse exponential but it will be for another ticket.

<a id='comment:24'></a>Comments only on the Cython aspects:

Don't include `stdsage.pxi` (#22896) or `cysignals/signals.pxi` (see, e.g., #23121).

You should use (#17668):

```diff
-        cdef Rational c = PY_NEW(Rational)
+        cdef Rational c = Rational.__new__(Rational)
```

With how Cython works, it is no worse to compactify:

```
cdef long floorlogp(long x, long b):
    """
    A fast way to find the floor of the log base ``b`` of ``x``.
    """
    cdef long t = b
    cdef long n = 0
    while t <= x:
        t *= b
        n += 1
    return n
```
However, isn't this just `x // b` since `x` and `b` are both non-negative?

```diff
-        cdef sage.rings.integer.Integer p_as_Integer
+        cdef Integer p_as_Integer
```

```diff
-        if self.valuation() < 1:
+        if self.valuation_c() < 1:
```

It would be great to use `self.lift_c()` instead of `self.lift()`, as `self.lift()` in all cases just redirects to `self.lift_c()`. However, the code is not properly set up to do this. :(

Since this is a `cdef` class, you can just use `self._parent` (which is a much faster call and cleaner Cython code).

Actually, as far as I can see, you don't need anything past

```
p_as_Integer = self.parent().prime()
```
when `prec == 1` (other than maybe `mpq_set_si(a[0], 1, 1)`). So I would move that code block/special case before that. Actually, if I am reading the code correctly, you could do it as a special case before

```
a = <mpq_t *> sig_malloc(prec * sizeof(mpq_t))
```

<a id='comment:30'></a>I've just written another implementation that solves the equation (with unknown `y`)

```
log(y) = x + x^p/p + x^(p^2)/p^2 + x^(p^3)/p^3 + ...
```
using a Newton scheme.

It works over any p-adic ring/field (that's why I make this ticket dependent from #23218). 
Moreover, it is expected to be fast as soon as there exists a fast implementation of the logarithm for this ring/field. For example:

```
sage: R = Zp(3,1000)
sage: x = 3 * R.random_element()
sage: %time y1 = x.artin_hasse_exp()
CPU times: user 9.14 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 9.14 s
Wall time: 9.16 s
sage: %time y2 = x.artin_hasse_exp_Newton()
CPU times: user 8 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 12 ms
Wall time: 9.81 ms
sage: y1 == y2
True
```
However, with precision 20, `artin_hasse_exp` is faster because it is written in Cython.

<a id='comment:32'></a>I've added a "direct" implementation that just evaluates

```
exp(x + x^p/p + x^(p^2)/p^2 + ...)
```
An heuristic is used for choosing the fastest algorithm (hopefully), depending on the input and the methods available for this input.

I've also improved the computation of the Artin-Hasse series: the computation is now done modulo some power of `p` (and not in `QQ` as before) and the result is cached.

On my laptop, timings are now:

```
sage: R = Zp(3,1000)
sage: elt = 3 * R.random_element()
sage: %timeit elt.artin_hasse_exp()  # use the "direct" algorithm
100 loops, best of 3: 2.22 ms per loop
sage: %timeit elt.artin_hasse_exp(algorithm='direct')
100 loops, best of 3: 2.14 ms per loop
sage: %timeit elt.artin_hasse_exp(algorithm='newton')
100 loops, best of 3: 4.84 ms per loop
sage: %timeit elt.artin_hasse_exp(algorithm='series')
100 loops, best of 3: 17.4 ms per loop
```

And for an extension:

```
sage: S.<pi> = R.extension(x^2 + 3)
sage: elt = pi * S.random_element()
sage: %timeit elt.artin_hasse_exp()  # use the "series" algorithm
10 loops, best of 3: 121 ms per loop
sage: %timeit elt.artin_hasse_exp(algorithm='direct')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: One factor of the Artin-Hasse exponential does not converge
sage: %timeit elt.artin_hasse_exp(algorithm='newton')
1 loop, best of 3: 333 ms per loop
sage: %timeit elt.artin_hasse_exp(algorithm='series')
10 loops, best of 3: 121 ms per loop
```
