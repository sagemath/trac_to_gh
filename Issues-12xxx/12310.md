}
```
The script `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-notebook` explicitly specifies port 8000 for no good reason.  It should not specify a port, which means the default will be used (8080 in the new flask notebook, 8000 before).

Keywords: **notebook port server bind http 8000 8080**

Erm, I'm probably missing something obvious, but I don't see this on github, google code, or the sage-notebook mailing list. Where did you report it?
