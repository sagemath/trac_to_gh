<div id="comment:0"></div>

The script `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-notebook` explicitly specifies port 8000 for no good reason.  It should not specify a port, which means the default will be used (8080 in the new flask notebook, 8000 before).

Component: **scripts**

Keywords: **notebook port server bind http 8000 8080**
