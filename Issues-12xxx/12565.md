I don't like this error:

I would expect something like:

```

Another bug.  If you use Sage for a level outside the Cremona range and you're using a system-wide Sage install, this is the error you get, which is pretty scary looking:

```

For the other bug, that looks like it might not be specific to the cremona database.

I have rebased the patch so that it now works after the rebased #12341.

This was not quite trivial as a little extra coding was needed so that "Old Cremona labels" could be parsed properly using the regexp method.

I tested sage/databses/cremona.py and all in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves.

<a id='comment:24'></a>To confirm: I checked that the rebased patch applies to 5.4.rc1+trac_12341.patch (after that was rebased), and that all tests in schemes/elliptic_curves pass (1) without database_ell_cremona installed, (2) with it installed, without "-optional database_cremona_ellcurve", (3) with it installed and with "-optional database_cremona_ellcurve".

The only failed test is the one in heegner.py which fails when the optional database is installed for reasons spelled out elsewhere and to be fixed in #13547.
