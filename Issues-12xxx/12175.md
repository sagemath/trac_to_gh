In #3893 SL2Z.random_element() was fixed to pass through `*args` and `**kwds` arguments. There are still 2 cases in the method that don't do that.

I have no idea how to provide a doctest for this patch.

The patchbot show a doctest failure:

```
File "/opt/patchbot-5.7.beta0/devel/sage-12175/sage/modular/arithgroup/congroup_sl2z.py", line 193:
    sage: SL2Z.random_element(5, distribution='1/n')
Expected:

That test probably needs to be marked as "`#random`".

I do not agree. This is a random function, and we should not expect it to return a fixed result.

```
sage: SL2Z.random_element(5, distribution='1/n')
[-1 -1]
[ 0 -1]
sage: SL2Z.random_element(5, distribution='1/n')
[1 1]
[0 1]
sage: SL2Z.random_element(5, distribution='1/n')

The result is random, and the test must be tagged accordingly.
