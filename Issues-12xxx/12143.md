Please close as duplicate of #252

```
sage: t = QQ['t'].gen() 
sage: K.<a> = QQ.extension(t^6 - 1/4*t^3 - 1/64)
sage: s = K['s'].gen() 
sage: g = s^4 + 2*a^2*s^2 + a^4 + a
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(g)
```

fails with PariError: inconsistent data (12)

The failure occurs in:
rings.number_field.number_field_rel.pari_relative_polynomial().polisirreducible() 

If, instead, one tries:

```
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(g, check=False)
```
it fails with PariError: (5)

This time it fails in:
pari_absolute_base_polynomial().rnfequation(self.pari_relative_polynomial(), 1)

I think the following works:

```
sage: PQ.<t> = QQ[]
sage: f = t^6 - 1/4*t^3 - 1/64
sage: f = PQ(pari(f).polredabs())
sage: K.<a> = QQ.extension(f)
sage: s = K['s'].gen()
sage: g = s^4 + 2*a^2*s^2 + a^4 + a
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(g)
sage: L
Number Field in b with defining polynomial s^4 + 2*a^2*s^2 + a^4 + a over its base field
sage: K
Number Field in a with defining polynomial t^6 - 2*t^3 - 1
```

I think this technique could be used to sort out #252.  But there are many details to be got right.
