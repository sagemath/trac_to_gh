I have been waiting for this for a long time. I would have done it myself but I don't have the know-how. I'll check you have done everything. I actually thought some of these bits were dead code.

I would be OK with that. I confess I didn't manually check all the files. I think it is because they include the following file:polynomial_template.pxi which does have "slice".

The title of the ticket is replace getslice in several files, not "all files" so I am inclined to give this a positive review in that any work on this is good. But more work will be needed in this area.
