If it's okay I will do this later in another ticket. So it should be easier to review.

BTW. these files don't contain any `__*slice__` function

I would be OK with that. I confess I didn't manually check all the files. I think it is because they include the following file:polynomial_template.pxi which does have "slice".

The title of the ticket is replace getslice in several files, not "all files" so I am inclined to give this a positive review in that any work on this is good. But more work will be needed in this area.
