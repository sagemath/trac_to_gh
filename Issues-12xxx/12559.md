If I try to run latex and then dvips on these files I get 

```
$ dvips A_tour_of_sage_Zh
This is dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software (www.radicaleye.com)

```
If I try pdflatex I get

```
!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file simsun.ttc): cannot open TrueType font file for reading
 ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
```

Is it a problem with my TeX installation (TeXLive 2011 on MacOSX) ?
Or something non-standard in this file?
I tried googling for these errors, but most of the results are in Chinese, and I can't see what 
is the problem...

I use CTeX distrbution (www.ctex.org) to finish this work,in the compiling process,

several Chinese fonts were needed. so,if you use TeXLive to commpile the .tex file,as 

lack of CTeX macro,it won't success.
  
  In fact,I'm trying to find a perfect way to convert this .tex file to rst,but yet 

successed. Now,I'm working on it!

   Thinks very much for you help anyway!

I use CTeX distrbution (www.ctex.org) to finish this work,in the compiling process, 

several Chinese fonts were needed. so,if you use TeXLive to commpile the .tex file,as 

lack of CTeX macro,it won't success. 

In fact,I'm trying to find a perfect way to convert this .tex file to rst,but yet 

successed. Now,I'm working on it! 

Thinks very much for you help anyway!

Just in Sage shell in `sage/doc/output/latex/zh_CN/a_tour_of_sage` I get 

```
$ make    
env </dev/null pool_size=4000000 save_size=50000 extra_mem_top=2000000 xelatex  'SageTutorial_zh_CN.tex'

(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)

```

This seems to indicate that xelatex cannot find the right format file.
Indeed, it works on "normal" files. Also note that
and in the normal shell I get

```

There are few more or less trivial issues with the text:
 1) references to Sage are quite outdated

 2) the part corresponding to the "Tour fo Sage" has strange formatting (extra sub-headers)

 3) it should be proofread by a native speaker just in case

Fixing 1) ought to be done by (with help of) a native speaker, as it's not really clear what's going on there. I'll ask someone to have a look, but he unfortunately doesn't work with Sage. Should I ask for a rough English translation of the 1st part, so that links/refs can be adjusted?

I've also emailed the original author asking if (s)he can help.

I don't think its a good idea to translate English->Chinese->English and then edit that as an English speaker ;-)

The installation instructions should be rewritten to not reference a particular version number (as in http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/). And separated into a different page, at least. Ideally we'd have a separate translation of the installation instructions, but that is a bigger task.

Also, I don't think its really necessary to spend time on typesetting nitpicks in the pdf version. The html output is the one we should be worrying about.

A couple comments.  
* First, do we even care about `zh` versus `zh_CN` and friends?   In which case we may want to change some of our other doc - but I'm not interested in breaking links for this sake.  But thought I'd ask.
* I agree we should break this out into a (small) separate installation document with updated references.  (Google translate is a lot more powerful than it used to be.)   Hopefully not too hard to do.
* I'm not quite as worried about it diverging from the "original" tour because
  * the tour is really not THAT useful
  * our translations always diverge from the "up-to-date"
  * we can think about it as no translation is one-to-one, like the LOTR movies versus the books...
 
  but if it's important to keep them the same, that will probably mean this stagnates and is only available on the website of the guy.  Honestly, this tour is better than the "real" one though I understand why that one is the way it is (mimicking some old Wolfram document, right?).
* I agree that the subheadings are (mostly) superfluous, and will probably remove them.
* I note that the plot thing in the "tour" is actually completely mysterious in the standard doc.  See #17444.

I have a native speaker who has agreed (in principle) to proofread this (and #9577) as well.

Incidentally, in the installation bit, I think it's not so horrible if we have old version names in the thing, as long as it's clear those are *samples*.  However, the reference to Cygwin needs to go, since it's not exactly easy even though it's now more or less supported.

Also, I think the bottom bit about versions of the document and the second paragraph at the top about the author's own reasons for doing it, while both okay, are not really useful.  I'm not sure how to interpret the CC-BY-SA, since there is no actual attribution in the document of the author!
