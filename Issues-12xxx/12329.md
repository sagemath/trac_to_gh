However, only components which are needed at build-time should be listed here.

**Apply** [attachment:12329_prune_deps.patch] to the sage root repository.

With this patch, building just the Sage library using

```
cd spkg
./install installed/sage-4.8   # put the correct version here
```
works fine, also using a parallel build.

Just for information: using "make -j", this is the critical path to build the Sage library (every packge in this list depends on the one just above it):

```
(base)
patch
iconv
libgpg_error
libgcrypt
opencdk
gnutls
python
fortran
lapack
atlas
linbox
sage
```

I'm fairly certain the sage library does not need $(INST)/$(ELLIPTIC_CURVES) either (all that package does is install a couple of databases to SAGE_DATA).

You are right, I confused with `ECLIB` (which certainly is needed).  New patch, needs review.

Coming from sage-on-gentoo, I am not sure at all that GRAPHS needs to be there. We very much build sage without needing mercurial but we do things a bit differently so that one needs caution. I don't think mpmath is needed to build either if it is we have a bug in sage-on-gentoo.

While gdmodule is not needed gd actually is and so is png.

```
for example from module_list.py. Of course these two are needed for polybori so you are probably covered. readline is also there but other dependencies may include it. I cannot check right now.
