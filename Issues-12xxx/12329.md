According to `spkg/standard/deps`, the sage library depends on:

```
However, only components which are needed at build-time should be listed here.

**Apply** [attachment:12329_prune_deps.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12329/12329_prune_deps.patch) to the sage root repository.

With this patch, building just the Sage library using

```
cd spkg
./install installed/sage-4.8   # put the correct version here
```
works fine, also using a parallel build.

Just for information: using "make -j", this is the critical path to build the Sage library (every packge in this list depends on the one just above it):

```
(base)
patch
iconv
libgpg_error
libgcrypt
opencdk
gnutls
python
fortran
lapack
atlas
linbox
sage
```
