I was playing around with the using the new prange functionality in cython and happened across this when I tried to interrupt the execution:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
An error occured during signal handling.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

/home/sage/5.0.beta8/spkg/bin/sage: line 308:  8428 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

I've attached a patch for the sage library that demonstrates the bug.

Proposal: close as wontfix.

The problem is that Cython uses OpenMP. Even I could fix the signal handling code, it's not at all clear how to make OpenMP deal with this. The following makes me think that a fix is impossible:
* [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3914264/openmp-is-there-a-way-for-a-thread-to-terminate-all-other-parallel-threads](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3914264/openmp-is-there-a-way-for-a-thread-to-terminate-all-other-parallel-threads)
* [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8482651/how-do-i-conditionally-terminate-a-parallel-region-in-openmp](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8482651/how-do-i-conditionally-terminate-a-parallel-region-in-openmp)

OpenMP simply isn't designed for this. With pthreads, it might be possible as it has clear specifications about how threads interact with signals.

Attachment: **[dumb_code.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12690/dumb_code.patch.gz)**

Using `sig_check()` inside the loop does work:

```
from cython.parallel import prange

include 'ext/interrupt.pxi'

def dumb_function():
    cdef int i,x

    while True:
        for i in prange(1<<30,nogil=True):
            with gil:
                sig_check()
            x += i

    return x
```

From Cython's point of view, `sig_check()` simply raises an exception when an interrupt occurred, which is explicitly allowed by [http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/parallelism.html#breaking-out-of-loops](http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/parallelism.html#breaking-out-of-loops)
The worst-case overhead is one loop iteration per thread, which is optimal given the limitations of OpenMP.

We should probably declare `sig_check()` as nogil though, see #15352.
