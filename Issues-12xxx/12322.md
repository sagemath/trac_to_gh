As pointed out by J.H. Davenport in this sage-support thread,

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/f9d2209041775c3e

the following (invalid) log simplification is made:

```
sage: t = var('t')                        
sage: assume(t, 'complex')               
sage: assumptions()                      
[t is complex]
sage: f = (1/2)*log(2*t) + (1/2)*log(1/t)
sage: f.full_simplify()                  
1/2*log(2)
```

When, for example, t=-1,

```
sage: f(t = -1)
I*pi + 1/2*log(2)
```

The assumption that `t` is complex is not necessary here, but simplify should *definitely* not ignore the imaginary part when dealing with complex functions.

Depends on #12737

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A2):

The simplification should always be equivalent to the original expression, though, or it isn't a simplification, it's a truncation (or something else). It doesn't make much sense to have a `simplify()` that doesn't return something equivalent to its argument: if I don't have to give you the right answer, I can simplify anything to zero!

I did check simplify_log() back when this was reported, and that wasn't the culprit. I dug a little deeper and found that it's `simplify_exp()` or `simplify_radical()` that does it. They both use the same maxima function. From the docs:

```
ALGORITHM:

       This uses the Maxima "radcan()" command. From the Maxima
       documentation: "All functionally equivalent forms are mapped into a
       unique form. For a somewhat larger class of expressions, produces a
       regular form. Two equivalent expressions in this class do not
       necessarily have the same appearance, but their difference can be
       simplified by radcan to zero. For some expressions radcan is quite
       time consuming. This is the cost of exploring certain relationships
       among the components of the expression for simplifications based on
       factoring and partial fraction expansions of exponents."
```

That, at least, doesn't make any mention of invalid simplifications.

Basically, we have a difference of opinion between some users and Maxima as to what a simplification is.  Is it a simplification of *symbolic expressions* which may be multivalued, or a simplification of functions?

Good luck finding a resolution; I have no good ideas on these issues right now, having wrestled with the other tickets in vain.  I think it would be unfortunate to remove `radcan` from full simplification.

I'd remove the call to `assume()` from the test, since I think there is a consensus that symbolic variables are complex by default. What do you think?

The symbolic domain situation is pretty muddy. We want variables to be complex by default, and we set the Maxima "domain" to complex for each new symbolic variable. But, that isn't always enough to affect simplifications. Some parts of Maxima use the "domain", others use assumptions, some use neither, and I'll bet one or two use both.

The complex assumption in the test case wasn't strictly necessary to make it fail, but it highlights the fact that this is a bug only when `t` is complex, and makes it clear that we have done all we can to indicate to sage that `t` is complex.

Sure; I am only a bit concerned that having the assumption in the test gives the impression that the variable is real by default. But it's no big deal.
