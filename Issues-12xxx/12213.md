I don't know what was done to plotting in sage-4.8.alpha5, but it is seriously messed up.    Basically, something is broken so that figsize doesn't work at all.  Often I have to set an aspect ratio of 1000 just to see anything, etc.  Here's a simple example, in which both outputs looks fine in sage-4.7.2, but in sage-4.8.alpha5, it is a total disaster:

```
g = Graphics(); g += line([(0, 120.93), (1, 120.92)])
g.show()
g.show(figsize=[8,4])
```
To see this on a remote install, just use "save('a.png')" in place of show.

Even though the first show is broken, perhaps due to something being set by default, the `g.show(figsize=[8,4])` is supposed to produce an "8 inch by 4 inch figure", but instead it makes something that is 0 inches tall.  What's going on?  What broke stuff?

Okay, the problem is that `Graphics()` continues to have default

```
return self._extra_kwds.get('aspect_ratio',1.0) 
```
but since we now actually *do* what we advertised before (namely, even in the old code we had that a non-'automatic' aspect ratio was to be trumped by a numerical value) this has cropped up.  

Old:

```
if self.__aspect_ratio=='automatic': 
     g.__aspect_ratio=other.__aspect_ratio 
elif other.__aspect_ratio=='automatic': 
     g.__aspect_ratio=self.__aspect_ratio 
else: 
     g.__aspect_ratio = max(self.__aspect_ratio, other.__aspect_ratio) 
```
so not really anything has changed, we just actually *do* it now, and this exposed that.  Even before we had

```
self.__aspect_ratio = 1.0 
```
for empty graphics objects.  And we do want to keep it at that for everything except things like `point`, `line`, `plot`.   Maybe can `Graphics()` just have an empty aspect ratio to handle this situation, and update the if/elif/else clause accordingly?

With this patch, both my example and novoselt's look fine.

Why?  I can't find any documentation anywhere that says this.   It also seems very weird to me.  If I do:

```
sage: G = ...
sage: G.show(figsize=[8,4])
```
I obviously want a figure that is 8 x 4.  If I merely wanted to expand one dimension keeing the aspect ratio, I would do

```
sage: G = ...
sage: G.show(figsize=8)
```
That said, I think this is an issue for another ticket.

I would argue that I want to have a graphics object of dimensions 8 x 4, i.e. the canvas should be of this dimension. But inside it I would expect to have the plot with the set aspect ratio, if it was actually set.

It seems to me that this is the same as requesting 8 x 8 figure. My point was that show with figsize should not behave very different from show, i.e. it should not override the aspect ratio.

What you describe is (1)  not what I expect, (2) not what is documented (if anything), and (3) not what actually happens in Sage now (or any previous version). 
I don't understand what use it would be to have that behavior either.

No it isn't.  If you want an 8x8 figure you would do `figsize=[8,8]`.

I disagree.  If one explicitly specifies a figsize, then I think it is should override aspect_ratio, because a figsize with two inputs implies an aspect ratio.

I can't find anywhere in plot.py that circles are advertised as having aspect_ratio 1. 

In the 3d plotting code, spheres get aspect [1:1:1] by default, and I think everything else gets something automatic.  So once a plot contains a sphere, it inherits ratio 1, unless something with a different ratio gets added.  For consistency, we could do the same with circles, i.e., they get aspect 1, but everything else gets automatic.  

I'm not sure about parametric and contour plots. 

The only thing I really want is for `Graphics()` to have aspect ratio "automatic" by default.

My comment about circles was after looking at William's patch: it shows that circles stop being round. I also didn't see comments on round circles in 4.7.2 documentation, but I remember reading some documentation patches where it was explained that they are round by default. Unfortunately, I don't recall where it was.

My use case for figsize not changing aspect ratio (unrelated to the final canvas size):
- I have a plot where I set aspect ratio to something I want
- now I want to insert this picture into a paper/presentation, e.g. using SageTeX
- I give dimensions of the picture place through figsize and get the size which I want with the aspect ratio which I want

Scaling the plot using TeX options is not a good idea: even in vector formats it will mess up e.g. font sizes (and that's one of the things I really like about SageTeX: plot labels can coordinate in size with the surrounding text).

Computing precise dimensions of the plot and figuring out what should be the figsize to fit where I want with the aspect ratio that I want is not cool.

Giving a single parameter to figsize to change only width is nice, but sometimes I want to make a particular height, not width. So keeping the ratio and expanding the plot until it hits one of the bounds is convenient...

I'm definitely not against having the functionality you want.  I just don't think it makes sense given what figsize is.  For example, we could make it so one could do

```
   figsize=[None, 8]

The idea was to avoid large expanses of whitespace in an image when the aspect ratio and the figure size didn't quite match up.  The default (fig_tight=True) is to give nicely cropped pictures, with the figsize as a *guide* to how big the picture should be.  When fig_tight is true, think of the figsize as being the size of the canvas, then we draw the picture on it, then we crop the canvas to what we drew to get a nice image without excessive borders.  The problem with it being False by default is that we end up with most figures having excessive whitespace in the borders (because they have a default figsize that probably does not match their aspect ratio).\n\nIt seems reasonable that if figsize is explicitly set for both dimensions, the fig_tight cropping shouldn't happen by default.

You're right that the fig_tight option exposes extra matplotlib functionality that we didn't have before.  The idea was to avoid large expanses of whitespace in an image when the aspect ratio and the figure size didn't quite match up.  The default (fig_tight=True) is to give nicely cropped pictures, with the figsize as a *guide* to how big the picture should be.  When fig_tight is true, think of the figsize as being the size of the canvas, then we draw the picture on it, then we crop the canvas to what we drew to get a nice image without excessive borders.  The problem with it being False by default is that we end up with most figures having excessive whitespace in the borders (because they have a default figsize that probably does not match their aspect ratio).

It seems reasonable that if figsize is explicitly set for both dimensions, the fig_tight cropping shouldn't happen by default.  I think if figsize is not specified (i.e., is the default, I think 6 in by 4 in), we should definitely have fig_tight = True by default.  So: is that policy too confusing?

Applies cleanly to 4.8.alpha4, passes tests in plot/*.py[x], and is a very reasonable default, I think.  Positive review.

It hasn't.  We should have at least two or three of the examples above in the documentation under `TESTS` so that future people can easily check for regression.

I am also worried about whether anyone bothered to check all the many pages of plot doc in the live documentation, just to see that the various plots which are supposed to have aspect ratio 1 really do.   Also, did anyone check the examples Dan Drake posted?
