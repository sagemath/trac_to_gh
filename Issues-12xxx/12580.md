From the documentation of `sage.misc.randstate`:

```
Note that wrappers of all the random number generation methods from
Python's :mod:`random` module are available at the Sage command
line, and these wrappers are properly affected by :meth:`set_random_seed`. ::
```

Indeed,

```
sage: set_random_seed(0); randint(0,20)
2
sage: set_random_seed(0); randint(0,20)
2
sage: set_random_seed(0); randint(0,20)
2
sage: type(randint(0,20))
<type 'int'>
```

So, Witty's design was to wrap python's random functionality to get it to respect set_random_seed rather than reach into python and change the seed there. Perhaps he had thread-safety in mind or something like that?

With that design, the behaviour noted in this ticket is not a bug but a feature that arises from circumventing the advertised API.

This ticket can still be considered as a request: can we reconsider the design decisions made in `randomstate`, of course.
