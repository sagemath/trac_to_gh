Robert,

Looks good, and very welcome.  I should have noticed, and fixed, this omission during my big push last year.  Looks ready for a positive review, but I have two questions.

1.  Could this make the  `.n()` method (immediate prior in source) obsolete?

2.  This does not seem to show up explicitly anywhere in the documentation.  Doing `v.N?` on an integer vector `v` seems to just give the generic documentation for a numerical approximation to a single scalar.  For matrices, the approach is different.  A bit more code, and not overriding the scalar method:  Plus: explicit documentation.  Minus: duplication of code, including a really bad approximation of `log 10` as discussed recently on sage-devel.

A suggestion - add a doctest in this patch for the generic method exhibiting application to vectors.  If that's agreeable, I'll make a ticket to have matrices follow the model of this ticket (and maybe even do it).  

Rob

Thus the method was invisible to those specialized classes and only "generic" vectors could use this.  So I took William's version of the function and moved it up to a higher level.

  * Removed a pile of `n()` methods, but preserved many of their doctests in the new method.

  * Could not resist poking at the documentation of `misc.functional.numerical_approx`, so there was a drive-by upgrade there.

  * Improved the passing of `prec` and `digits` in one or two places.

  * Reworked the sparse case slightly and added a doctest to make sure it was not being clobbered.

  * Passes all tests.

  * Seemingly other places to look for removal, almost all outside my expertise.  Maybe I should put these on a new ticket for safekeeping?  The one for graphs is OK and does not need any inspection.
