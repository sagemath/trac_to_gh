<a id='comment:3'></a>Robert,

Looks good, and very welcome.  I should have noticed, and fixed, this omission during my big push last year.  Looks ready for a positive review, but I have two questions.

1.  Could this make the  `.n()` method (immediate prior in source) obsolete?

2.  This does not seem to show up explicitly anywhere in the documentation.  Doing `v.N?` on an integer vector `v` seems to just give the generic documentation for a numerical approximation to a single scalar.  For matrices, the approach is different.  A bit more code, and not overriding the scalar method:  Plus: explicit documentation.  Minus: duplication of code, including a really bad approximation of `log 10` as discussed recently on sage-devel.

A suggestion - add a doctest in this patch for the generic method exhibiting application to vectors.  If that's agreeable, I'll make a ticket to have matrices follow the model of this ticket (and maybe even do it).  

Rob
