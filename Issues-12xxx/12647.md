This deals with adding support for a file

```
$DOT_SAGE/sagerc
```
which will be sourced after `sage-env`, so it can be used to override the environment variables used in Sage.

**Apply**:
1. [attachment: 12647_sagerc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12647/12647_sagerc.patch.gz) to `SAGE_ROOT`.
2. [attachment: 12647_sagerc_doc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12647/12647_sagerc_doc.patch.gz), [attachment: trac_12647-review.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12647/trac_12647-review.patch.gz) to the Sage library.

In a line like

```sh
if [ "$SAGE_RC_FILE" = "" ]; then
```
is there any advantage to replacing the test with `[ -z "$SAGE_RC_FILE" ]`? (I guess you did it the way you did for consistency with other parts of the script?)

See the review patch for two minor changes to the documentation.

Otherwise, positive review.

As far as I know, these two tests are identical.  But I changed it to use `-z`.

Review patch is obviously fine.

How about adding a commented template rc file, with examples for `CC`, `CFLAGS`, `MAKE` (e.g. conditionally, depending on the hostname), `SAGE_BROWSER`, `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` etc.?

Maybe on a follow-up ticket?

```sh
        echo >&2 "Error sourcing $SAGE_RC_FILE"
```

AFAIK `.` is more portable than `source`; does Bash 2.04 support the latter?

Sun's "default" `sed` (not the one in `/usr/xpg*/bin/`) doesn't either IIRC.

Probably even the XPG one doesn't; I don't recall.  It at least used to be a GNU extension.

I see.  I was pretty sure we'd source `sage-env` (at least) in the `build` rule (of course on the same line we call `spkg/install`) of the top-level Makefile (`$SAGE_ROOT/Makefile`).

We could of course implement `./sage --make ...` :-)

It would have helped only if `CFLAGS` were (e.g.) set to `""` as well (if they had been empty or unset before), which on the other hand would currently break building the Sage library, which needs `-fno-strict-aliasing`, which [also] comes from Python's `CFLAGS`, but only if `CFLAGS` are **not** set to `""`, i.e., not set / exported at all.

Of course.  But we [still] have things like

```sh
if [ "$LDFLAGS" = "" ]; then
    LDFLAGS=""          && export LDFLAGS
fi


if [ "$CXXFLAGS" = "" ]; then
    export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
fi
```
in `sage-env`, which will **always** cause `LDFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` to be exported, no matter whether they've previously been unset, or exported empty.  So currently (re)exporting these in e.g. `spkg-install` scripts is indeed redundant.

I think we should either do that there for all such variables, or none of them.  Especially setting `CXXFLAGS` to `$CFLAGS` even if a user did `export CXXFLAGS=""` may have somewhat surprising effects, or is (I think) at least unexpected behaviour.
