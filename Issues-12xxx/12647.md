This deals with adding support for a file

```
$DOT_SAGE/sagerc
```
which will be sourced after `sage-env`, so it can be used to override the environment variables used in Sage.

**Apply**:
1. [attachment:12647_sagerc.patch] to `SAGE_ROOT`.
2. [attachment:12647_sagerc_doc.patch], [attachment:trac_12647-review.patch] to the Sage library.

In a line like

```sh
if [ "$SAGE_RC_FILE" = "" ]; then
```
is there any advantage to replacing the test with `[ -z "$SAGE_RC_FILE" ]`? (I guess you did it the way you did for consistency with other parts of the script?)

See the review patch for two minor changes to the documentation.

Otherwise, positive review.

As far as I know, these two tests are identical.  But I changed it to use `-z`.

Review patch is obviously fine.

How about adding a commented template rc file, with examples for `CC`, `CFLAGS`, `MAKE` (e.g. conditionally, depending on the hostname), `SAGE_BROWSER`, `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` etc.?

Maybe on a follow-up ticket?

Minor flaw:

```sh
        echo >&2 "Error sourcing $DOT_SAGE/sagerc"
```
should read

```sh
        echo >&2 "Error sourcing $SAGE_RC_FILE"

AFAIK `.` is more portable than `source`; does Bash 2.04 support the latter?

Sun's "default" `sed` (not the one in `/usr/xpg*/bin/`) doesn't either IIRC.

Probably even the XPG one doesn't; I don't recall.  It at least used to be a GNU extension.

Oh, I thought this discussion was unrelated to the ticket anyway... 8)

But now I see it is on topic...
In this case, `s/WIN.*/WIN/` would work as well by the way, and there shouldn't be two invocations of `uname`.  (And using the shell-builtin pattern matching, `case ... in ...`, would be faster and safer / more portable anyway.)

We could of course implement `./sage --make ...` :-)

(But perhaps the easiest way is to make `make` an alias to a script that behaves differently in case the current directory is the root of a Sage installation, and just calls `make` otherwise.)

... or probably not (it's late).

Actually any `spkg-install` modifying `CFLAGS` should export them (at least if they've been empty / unset) ...

It would have helped only if `CFLAGS` were (e.g.) set to `""` as well (if they had been empty or unset before), which on the other hand would currently break building the Sage library, which needs `-fno-strict-aliasing`, which [also] comes from Python's `CFLAGS`, but only if `CFLAGS` are **not** set to `""`, i.e., not set / exported at all.

Of course.  But we [still] have things like

```sh
if [ "$LDFLAGS" = "" ]; then
    LDFLAGS=""          && export LDFLAGS
fi


if [ "$CXXFLAGS" = "" ]; then
    export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
fi
```
in `sage-env`, which will **always** cause `LDFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` to be exported, no matter whether they've previously been unset, or exported empty.  So currently (re)exporting these in e.g. `spkg-install` scripts is indeed redundant.

I think we should either do that there for all such variables, or none of them.  Especially setting `CXXFLAGS` to `$CFLAGS` even if a user did `export CXXFLAGS=""` may have somewhat surprising effects, or is (I think) at least unexpected behaviour.
