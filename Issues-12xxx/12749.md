<a id='comment:3'></a>In the list of things coercing into a free algebra, you have

```
        398	        - Polynomial rings in the same variables over a base with a coercion 
 	399	          map into self.base_ring() 
```
This is false: a polynomial ring (in which the variables commute) does not, and should not, coerce into a free algebra (in which they don't). Did you mean "**free algebras** in the same variables..."?

```
sage: F = FreeAlgebra(ZZ, 3, 'x,y,z')
sage: G = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 3, 'x,y,z')
sage: F.has_coerce_map_from(G)
False
