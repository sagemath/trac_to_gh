```
Allow for:

```
    sage: g = DiGraph({0:(1,2,3), 2:(4)}); g
    Digraph on 5 vertices
```

Currently this is either not accepted, or gives an nonsensical output:

```
    sage: DiGraph({0:set([1,2,3]), 2:set([4])}).edges()
    [(0, 1, {0: {}}), (0, 2, {0: {}}), (0, 3, {0: {}}), (2, 4, {0: {}})]

```

For the record: I had a look at the "apply failed" on 5.0.beta8, and it's simply due to a network error during the download of the patch (I guess that was when trac was down the other day). The patch does apply smoothly (also on 5.0.beta10).
