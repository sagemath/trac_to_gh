The flintqs spkg currently does not respect the global CXX flag, we should fix this (for instance for #12426).

I've posted an spkg at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/flintqs-20070817.p7.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/flintqs-20070817.p7.spkg).

I don't understand why we still have this separate spkg; as mentioned on previous tickets, a more recent version of FLINT QS is included in FLINT 1.x (and hence also in our FLINT spkg), which we just don't build and/or install there, for whatever reason... :-/

Again, `$CXX` should be quoted.

Indeed. Or quote the whole argument `"CPP=$CXX"`.
