This ticket implements an interface to read databases of reflexive polytopes:
* Add databases in PALP format to the `polytopes_db.spkg`. 
* A class `PALPreader` that can read the palp output and yield it in various Sage representations.
* Finally, this ticket contains a specialized PPL lattice polytope that is fast enough to construct to go through the 500 million 4-d reflexive polytopes and compute integral points.

The updated polytopes spkg is here:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/spkg/polytopes_db-20120220.spkg

I had a look and have some remarks to do:
* now spkg-install checks for SAGE_DATA before using SAGE_DATA (the one in sage 5.0 checks SAGE_ROOT before using SAGE_DATA...), which is good!
* the sources aren't in a directory src/ but in reflexive_polytopes/ -- isn't it against the conventions?
* both build.sh scripts lack a shebang ;
* is it normal that the installation is dumping everything in SAGE_DATA/reflexive_polytopes/ ? Shouldn't the spkg (1) depend on palp (2) in the build phase, use it to create the database (3) in the install phase, only install the resulting database?

I've added the shebang to the build.sh scripts, even though we are entering deep into bikeshedding territory here as these are not executed but only show how the database can be built.

I've also renamed the directory to `src/`, thats just something I inherited from the previous version.

All databases in Sage just copy their content. Usually they require non-trivial computer resources to build, so you specifically don't want to recompute them when you are installing Sage. In this case its actually computationally easy, but just wait until we add the 4-d case ;-)

Copying the contents is ok -- what bothers me is that you copy the scripts too.

You says that "these are not executed but only show how the database can be built" -- does that mean you don't guarantee they effectively work?

It's mainly because of #13109.  The current plan is to merge #13109 in sage-5.2 but all follow-ups (including #11310) in sage-5.3.  It's certainly not meant to be a long-term sage-pending.

Hi Volker, do you actually have the package for 4d polytopes which is mentioned in the patch documentation?

(By the way, maybe `polytopes_reflexive_4d_db` would be a better name for it?)

IMHO, if it is hosted elsewhere, we might rather want to host an interface only.
Anyhow that comment in the source about `install_package('polytopes_db_4d')` is misleading, and should be rectified.
