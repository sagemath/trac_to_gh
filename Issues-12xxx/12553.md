This ticket implements an interface to read databases of reflexive polytopes:
* Add databases in PALP format to the `polytopes_db.spkg`. 
* A class `PALPreader` that can read the palp output and yield it in various Sage representations.
* Finally, this ticket contains a specialized PPL lattice polytope that is fast enough to construct to go through the 500 million 4-d reflexive polytopes and compute integral points.

The updated polytopes spkg is here:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/spkg/polytopes_db-20120220.spkg

<a id='comment:5'></a>I had a look and have some remarks to do:
* now spkg-install checks for SAGE_DATA before using SAGE_DATA (the one in sage 5.0 checks SAGE_ROOT before using SAGE_DATA...), which is good!
* the sources aren't in a directory src/ but in reflexive_polytopes/ -- isn't it against the conventions?
* both build.sh scripts lack a shebang ;
* is it normal that the installation is dumping everything in SAGE_DATA/reflexive_polytopes/ ? Shouldn't the spkg (1) depend on palp (2) in the build phase, use it to create the database (3) in the install phase, only install the resulting database?

<a id='comment:20'></a>Sorry forgot to reply.. I haven't packaged the 4d database... 10 GB spkg? ;-) But the updated spkg contains the 2d and 3d analogues in PALP's binary database format.
