Florent [1] added a nice --warn-links argument for -docbuild which screams immediately when a Sphinx link does not work properly (Sphinx does not find where the link is pointing to), and the option is not enabled by default because, of course, there are *MANY* such links in our documentation `:-)`

This patch fixes those links in the Graph database (those that *could* be fixed, actually), like #12767 already does for sage/rings/number_field.

Five of these are "link not found" warnings that presumably weren't easily fixable, but one of them is a genuine formatting error which would have come up even without --warn-links, and we can't have that -- sorry!

```
Couldn't one just change the syntax to say 

```
``sage.graphs.graph_latex.GraphLatex.__graphlatex_options``
```
instead of the following?

```
:data:`sage.graphs.graph_latex.GraphLatex.__graphlatex_options`
```
Something similar might be able to be said about

```
:meth:`sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph._latex_`
```
but then again maybe this is not worth the trouble.  I still wish we had the "superreference" target for the docbuild, which included all underscore methods.

Also, we are trying to discourage double-underscore attributes.  Such as `__graphlatex_options`.   Could this be made single-underscore (perhaps in another ticket, if appropriate)?

More comments:
* The doc looks wrong in the (short) tree.pyx - you'll see what I mean.
* The AUTHORS in matchpoly is indented too much.
* graph_plot.html can have trac #10124 written as <code>:trac:\`#10124\`</code>, I think.

All that said, it seems like it's pretty good overall.

Oh, yeah. Columns.
