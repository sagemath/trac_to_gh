We already have a doctest for the duplication mechanism. But, sure, I can add a doctest for this.

Which floating point comparisons do you have in mind ?

Ah, too bad. I had been hoping you had some insight on floating point that would convert me. :-)

But, yes, failing to detect some redundant constraints isn't as catastrophic as failing to remove even one constraint that must be removed. Maybe one day we can figure some way to make the check for redundancy more efficient by sorting the list somehow, but it works pretty well for me right now in practice.

It would be nicer if the backends did that for us, but they don't. :-(

Alright: I'll submit a revision of this patch at some point, with the added doctest.

> I can not check right now as sage 5.0-rc0 is being compiled, but I hope there is not much work to do. I would also like to see a proud 100% on these files. If you feel like adding some documentation while working on this patch please do, but leave some of the work, it would not be fair otherwise `:-)`

I'll try to take care of it. It's on my schedule for tomorrow, then. :-)

I updated the patch, adding a few doctests, including the one Nathann requested. Sage will still complain that doctest coverage isn't complete, but that's due to an old bug that still hasn't been resolve (see #1795).

Please review!
