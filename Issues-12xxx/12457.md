The problem is that a custom built GCC (#12369) links different standard libraries than Apple's GCC.  In particular, it seems that "-lgcc_s" and "-lgcc_eh" are never linked in by Apple.  We should change our linker flags to do the same.

This seems to affect only the Sage library.  The problem is not limited to OS X 10.7, it happens also on 10.6.
