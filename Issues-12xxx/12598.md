This is not so simple. How would you ensure that the child processes are also cleaned up when you kill the Sage process?

Well if the child processes are not killed, it defeats the main purpose of this ticket. The eventual use of this ticket is to be able to identify a Sage process and kill it remotely/automatically (as in from a command line) instead of having to go through a manual process.

If we only rename the Sage process, which shouldn't be too hard to do, then the user will be under a false impression when it is terminated but there are other child processes running amok.

Well, that stackoverflow answer is Linux-specific, so I guess it's useless for Sage.

I have doubts that changing the name would be useful, if it doesn't work with `killall`.

Correct. According to [killall.c](http://sourceforge.net/p/psmisc/code/ci/master/tree/src/killall.c), it seems killall looks for the program name in `/proc/<PID>/stat`, and the name there apparently doesn't need to be the same as in `/proc/<PID>/cmdline`.

This actually causes nasty behaviour for `killall -e` (exist match, not just on first 15 characters), because that does go looking for confirmation in `/proc/<PID>/cmdline`, so if the first 15 characters there don't match then `killall -e` will never work.

Note that `sh mylittlescript` does succeed in getting `mylittlescript` into `stat` so there is a way for executables to let the name in `stat` be different from the executable name. In those cases, `sh` is part of `cmdline`, so `killall -e` is smart enough to go looking in later parts of `cmdline` as well.

For linux there is [http://pythonhosted.org/python-prctl/](http://pythonhosted.org/python-prctl/) which provides both a `set_name` and a `set_proctitle`.

I have tried:

```
$ sage -sh easy_install setproctitle
```
after which I can do:

```
sage: import setproctitle
sage: setproctitle.setproctitle("mysage")
```
which changes both `/proc/PID/stat` and `/proc/PID/cmdline` (it truncates the name to 15 characters for what `stat` gets set to), i.e., both `killall` and `killall -e` work.

This test was on linux, but [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setproctitle/](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setproctitle/) claims it works on

```
    GNU/Linux
    BSD
    MacOS X
    Windows
```
so on SunOS we should probably make it a NoOp

The easiest way to change the name of an executable on a proper OS (and filesystem) is to simply create a hard link and call/execute the synonym instead.  (Soft links work at least partially.)

IMHO the main purpose of doing so would be to allow users to better **see** Sage instances in `top`, `ps` etc.

Yes, this is a problem as there are occasionally "ghost" Sage processes (whether from sagenb or elsewhere) and it's annoying to track them down.

Do you know the `--forest` or `f` option of `ps`? That usually clears up a lot.

No, I usually use `top`, sometimes `ps -aux`.

In principle this ticket *could* be solved with an FAQ entry, though it would be nice for the process to say Sage.
