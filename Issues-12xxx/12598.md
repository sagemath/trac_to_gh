Well if the child processes are not killed, it defeats the main purpose of this ticket. The eventual use of this ticket is to be able to identify a Sage process and kill it remotely/automatically (as in from a command line) instead of having to go through a manual process.

If we only rename the Sage process, which shouldn't be too hard to do, then the user will be under a false impression when it is terminated but there are other child processes running amok.

Well, that stackoverflow answer is Linux-specific, so I guess it's useless for Sage.

I have doubts that changing the name would be useful, if it doesn't work with `killall`.

According to [killall.c](http://sourceforge.net/p/psmisc/code/ci/master/tree/src/killall.c), it seems killall looks for the program name in `/proc/<PID>/stat`, and the name there apparently doesn't need to be the same as in `/proc/<PID>/cmdline`.\n\nThis actually causes nasty behaviour for `killall -e` (exist match, not just on first 15 characters), because that does go looking for confirmation in `/proc/<PID>/cmdline`, so if the first 15 characters there don't match then `killall -e` will never work.\n\nNote that `sh mylittlescript` does succeed in getting `mylittlescript` into `stat` so there is a way for executables to let the name in `stat` be different from the executable name.

Correct. According to [killall.c](http://sourceforge.net/p/psmisc/code/ci/master/tree/src/killall.c), it seems killall looks for the program name in `/proc/<PID>/stat`, and the name there apparently doesn't need to be the same as in `/proc/<PID>/cmdline`.

This actually causes nasty behaviour for `killall -e` (exist match, not just on first 15 characters), because that does go looking for confirmation in `/proc/<PID>/cmdline`, so if the first 15 characters there don't match then `killall -e` will never work.

Note that `sh mylittlescript` does succeed in getting `mylittlescript` into `stat` so there is a way for executables to let the name in `stat` be different from the executable name. In those cases, `sh` is part of `cmdline`, so `killall -e` is smart enough to go looking in later parts of `cmdline` as well.

I have tried:

```
$ sage -sh easy_install setproctitle
```
after which I can do:

```
sage: import setproctitle
sage: setproctitle.setproctitle("mysage")
```
which changes both `/proc/PID/stat` and `/proc/PID/cmdline` (it truncates the name to 15 characters for what `stat` gets set to), i.e., both `killall` and `killall -e` work.

This test was on linux, but [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setproctitle/](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setproctitle/) claims it works on

```
    GNU/Linux
    BSD
    MacOS X
    Windows
```
so on SunOS we should probably make it a NoOp

The easiest way to change the name of an executable on a proper OS (and filesystem) is to simply create a hard link and call/execute the synonym instead.  (Soft links work at least partially.)

IMHO the main purpose of doing so would be to allow users to better **see** Sage instances in `top`, `ps` etc.

Yes, this is a problem as there are occasionally "ghost" Sage processes (whether from sagenb or elsewhere) and it's annoying to track them down.

Do you know the `--forest` or `f` option of `ps`? That usually clears up a lot.

No, I usually use `top`, sometimes `ps -aux`.

In principle this ticket *could* be solved with an FAQ entry, though it would be nice for the process to say Sage.
