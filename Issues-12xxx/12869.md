> Regarding the ticket itself - it work fine for me. I don't quite understand the details of the code, but from comments it is clear what it is supposed to do, tests pass. So positive review.

Here are some details:

In the file `sphinx/environment.py`, the class `BuildEnvironment` is
responsible for handling the environment. It has a method called update which
decide which files should be rebuild. Here is the relevant code:

```python
class BuildEnvironment:
    [...]
    def update(self, config, srcdir, doctreedir, app=None):
        """(Re-)read all files new or changed since last update.

        Returns a summary, the total count of documents to reread and an
        iterator that yields docnames as it processes them.  Store all
        environment docnames in the canonical format (ie using SEP as a
        separator in place of os.path.sep).
        """
        config_changed = False
        if self.config is None:
            msg = '[new config] '
            config_changed = True
        else:
            # check if a config value was changed that affects how
            # doctrees are read
            for key, descr in config.values.iteritems():
                if descr[1] != 'env':
                    continue
                if self.config[key] != config[key]:
                    msg = '[config changed] '
                    config_changed = True
                    break
            [...]
```
So I change `config.values['nitpick'][1]` from `'env'` to `'sage'`
to make sure that config changed is not set.
