    "body": "I aim to write some classes to implement free groups, finitely presented groups and braid groups. Mostly it would consist in wrapping gap functions, so maybe it would need to be rewritten in the future if libgap is finished. \n\nI don't have any previous experience in implementing new classes or using the category framework, but so far i have started with a little proof of concept. I would really apreciate any feedback or help.\n\nThis is an example of some things that you can do so far:\n\nBasic arithmetic in Free and Finitely presented groups:\n\n```\nsage: G.<a,b,c,d,e> = FreeGroup()\nsage: a*b*c*d/a/a/e\na*b*c*d*a^-2*e^-1\nsage: H = G / [a*b*a*b,a^2,b^2,c^2,d^2,e^2,a*b*c*d*e*a*b,c*d*e*c*d*e,d*e*d*e]\nsage: H.gens()\n(a, b, c, d, e)\nsage: H([1,2,3]) / H([3,2,1])\na*b*c*a^-1*b^-1*c^-1\n```\n\nFox derivatives of free group elements, and Alexander matrices of finitely presented groups (the result is given on the group algebra):\n\n```\nsage: G<a,b,c> = FreeGroup()    \nsage: a*b*c/a/a/c  \na*b*c*a^-2*c^-1\nsage: H = G.quotient([a*b*a*b,a^2,b^2,c^2,a*b*c*a*b*c])                              \nsage: H.gens()\n(a, b, c)\nsage: H([1,2,3])/H([3,2,1])\na*b*c*a^-1*b^-1*c^-1\nsage: (a*b*a/b/a).fox_derivative(a)\nB[1] + B[a*b] - B[a*b*a*b^-1*a^-1]\nsage: H.alexander_matrix()\n[                           B[1] + B[x0]                                       0                                       0]\n[                                      0                            B[1] + B[x1]                                       0]\n[                                      0                                       0                  B[1] + B[x2] + B[x2^2]]\n[                        B[1] + B[x0*x1]                     B[x0] + B[x0*x1*x0]                                       0]\n[                        B[1] + B[x0*x2]                                       0                     B[x0] + B[x0*x2*x0]]\n[                                      0        B[1] + B[x1*x2] + B[x1*x2*x1*x2] B[x1] + B[x1*x2*x1] + B[x1*x2*x1*x2*x1]]\n```\n\nSome properties of finitely presented groups. \n\n```\nsage: G = FreeGroup(3)          \nsage: G.inject_variables()\nDefining x0, x1, x2\nsage: H = G / [x0*x1*x2*x0*x1*x2,x1*x2*x0*x1*x2,x2^2]\nsage: H.simplification_isomorphism()\nGeneric morphism:\n  From: Finitely presented group < x0, x1, x2 | x0*x1*x2*x0*x1*x2, x1*x2*x0*x1*x2, x2^2 >\n  To:   Finitely presented group < x1, x2 | x2^2, x1*x2*x1*x2 >\nsage: H.abelian_invariants()\n(2, 2)\nsage: H.simplification_isomorphism()(x0)\n1\nsage: H.simplification_isomorphism()(x1)\nx1\nsage: H.simplification_isomorphism()(x2)\nx2\nsage: H.abelian_invariants()\n(2, 2)\n```\n\nCaution: some methods are no granted to finish, specially if the group is infinite. In that case, the system memory would be exhausted, and the underlying gap session killed, leaving orphaned objects. It would be nice to have a security system that would interrupt the computation before arriving to that, giving just an error message. It's on the to-do list.\n\n\n```\nsage: G = FreeGroup(3)\nsage: G.inject_variables()\nDefining x0, x1, x2\nsage: H = G.quotient([x0^2,x1^2,x2^3,(x0*x1)^2,(x0*x2)^2,(x1*x2)^3])\nsage: H.abelian_invariants()\n(2,)\nsage: H.simplification_isomorphism()\nGeneric morphism:\n  From: Finitely presented group < x0, x1, x2 | x0^2, x1^2, x2^3, x0*x1*x0*x1, x0*x2*x0*x2, x1*x2*x1*x2*x1*x2 >\n  To:   Finitely presented group < x0, x1, x2 | x0^2, x1^2, x2^3, x0*x1*x0*x1, x0*x2*x0*x2, x1*x2*x1*x2*x1*x2 >\nsage: H.cardinality()\n24\nsage: H.as_permutation_group()\nPermutation Group with generators [(1,2)(3,6)(4,8)(5,7)(9,14)(10,13)(11,16)(12,15)(17,22)(18,21)(19,24)(20,23), (1,3)(2,6)(4,11)(5,12)(7,15)(8,16)(9,17)(10,18)(13,21)(14,22)(19,20)(23,24), (1,4,5)(2,7,8)(3,9,10)(6,13,14)(11,18,19)(12,20,17)(15,22,23)(16,24,21)]\n```\n\nFor Braid groups, the way to work is similar.\n\n```\nsage: B=BraidGroup(4)\nsage: B\nBraid group on 4 strands\nsage: B([1,2,3,-1,2,-1])\ns0*s1*s2*s0^-1*s1*s0^-1\nsage: b=B([1,2,3,-1,2,-1])\nsage: b.left_normal_form()\n[s0^-1*s1^-1*s2^-1*s0^-1*s1^-1*s0^-2*s1^-1*s2^-1*s0^-1*s1^-1*s0^-1, s0*s1*s2*s1*s0, s0*s2*s1*s0, s0*s1*s0*s2*s1]\nsage: b.permutation()\n[4, 3, 2, 1]\nsage: b.burau_matrix()\n[                -t + 1               -t^2 + t             -t^3 + t^2                    t^3]\n[             -1 + t^-1          -t + 2 -

Since libgap seems to be stable and ready, i plan to focus on this version.\n\nTo install it, just make sure you have applied #6391, #13211, and then apply \n* [attachment:trac_12339_fpgroups_vb.patch], \n* [attachment:trac_12339_braids.patch]\n* [attachment:trac_12339_braid_groups_4.patch]\n* [attachment:trac_12339_braid_groups_review.patch]\n* [attachment:trac_12339_pickling.patch]\n\n**Assignee:** joyner\n\n**CC:**  combinatorics sydahmad @videlec @jhpalmieri tjolivet @rbeezer @dimpase\n\n**Keywords:** free groups, finitely presented groups, braids\n\n**Reviewer:** Volker Braun\n\n**Author:** Miguel Marco, Volker Braun\n\n**Merged:** sage-5.7.beta3\n\n**Dependencies:** #6391, #13687, #13588\n\n**Resolution:** fixed\n\nIssue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12339\n\n",

I aim to write some classes to implement free groups, finitely presented groups and braid groups. Mostly it would consist in wrapping gap functions, so maybe it would need to be rewritten in the future if libgap is finished. 

I don't have any previous experience in implementing new classes or using the category framework, but so far i have started with a little proof of concept. I would really apreciate any feedback or help.

This is an example of some things that you can do so far:

Basic arithmetic in Free and Finitely presented groups:

```
sage: G.<a,b,c,d,e> = FreeGroup()
sage: a*b*c*d/a/a/e
a*b*c*d*a^-2*e^-1
sage: H = G / [a*b*a*b,a^2,b^2,c^2,d^2,e^2,a*b*c*d*e*a*b,c*d*e*c*d*e,d*e*d*e]
sage: H.gens()
(a, b, c, d, e)
sage: H([1,2,3]) / H([3,2,1])
a*b*c*a^-1*b^-1*c^-1
```

Fox derivatives of free group elements, and Alexander matrices of finitely presented groups (the result is given on the group algebra):

```
sage: G<a,b,c> = FreeGroup()    
sage: a*b*c/a/a/c  
a*b*c*a^-2*c^-1
sage: H = G.quotient([a*b*a*b,a^2,b^2,c^2,a*b*c*a*b*c])                              
sage: H.gens()
(a, b, c)
sage: H([1,2,3])/H([3,2,1])
a*b*c*a^-1*b^-1*c^-1
sage: (a*b*a/b/a).fox_derivative(a)
B[1] + B[a*b] - B[a*b*a*b^-1*a^-1]
sage: H.alexander_matrix()
[                           B[1] + B[x0]                                       0                                       0]
[                                      0                            B[1] + B[x1]                                       0]
[                                      0                                       0                  B[1] + B[x2] + B[x2^2]]
[                        B[1] + B[x0*x1]                     B[x0] + B[x0*x1*x0]                                       0]

[                                      0        B[1] + B[x1*x2] + B[x1*x2*x1*x2] B[x1] + B[x1*x2*x1] + B[x1*x2*x1*x2*x1]]
```

Some properties of finitely presented groups. 

```
sage: G = FreeGroup(3)          
sage: G.inject_variables()
Defining x0, x1, x2
sage: H = G / [x0*x1*x2*x0*x1*x2,x1*x2*x0*x1*x2,x2^2]
sage: H.simplification_isomorphism()
Generic morphism:
  From: Finitely presented group < x0, x1, x2 | x0*x1*x2*x0*x1*x2, x1*x2*x0*x1*x2, x2^2 >
  To:   Finitely presented group < x1, x2 | x2^2, x1*x2*x1*x2 >
sage: H.abelian_invariants()
(2, 2)
sage: H.simplification_isomorphism()(x0)
1
sage: H.simplification_isomorphism()(x1)
x1
sage: H.simplification_isomorphism()(x2)
x2
sage: H.abelian_invariants()
(2, 2)
```

Caution: some methods are no granted to finish, specially if the group is infinite. In that case, the system memory would be exhausted, and the underlying gap session killed, leaving orphaned objects. It would be nice to have a security system that would interrupt the computation before arriving to that, giving just an error message. It's on the to-do list.


```
sage: G = FreeGroup(3)
sage: G.inject_variables()
Defining x0, x1, x2
sage: H = G.quotient([x0^2,x1^2,x2^3,(x0*x1)^2,(x0*x2)^2,(x1*x2)^3])
sage: H.abelian_invariants()
(2,)
sage: H.simplification_isomorphism()
Generic morphism:
  From: Finitely presented group < x0, x1, x2 | x0^2, x1^2, x2^3, x0*x1*x0*x1, x0*x2*x0*x2, x1*x2*x1*x2*x1*x2 >
  To:   Finitely presented group < x0, x1, x2 | x0^2, x1^2, x2^3, x0*x1*x0*x1, x0*x2*x0*x2, x1*x2*x1*x2*x1*x2 >

sage: H.as_permutation_group()

```

For Braid groups, the way to work is similar.

```

```

Also b.plot() and b.plot3d() would plot the braid.


There is a new version to be used with the libgap interface (much faster than the old pexpect one). Since libgap seems to be stable and ready, i plan to focus on this version.

To install it, just make sure you have applied #6391, #13211, and then apply

Hello,

It will be nice to have that in Sage. First of all, before putting a patch in "needs review" you have to verify few things that are in the Developer Guide of Sage. In particular, you should correct:

0.a) There are many trailing whitespaces that you should remove (you can use sed in a console).

0.b) There are 8 doctests that fail  (you may use "sage -t my_file.py").

0.c) You should pay attention to the documentation: comment your examples and explain how do they work (both from mathematical and user point of vue). This is very important the reviewer and the future Sage user.

Then there are other possible ways of improvement.

1) I can not multiply braids

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(4)
isage: B.inject_variables()
Defining sigma0, sigma1, sigma2, sigma3
sage: b=sigma0*sigma1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'Braid' and 'Braid'
```

2) I think that the free group should go in a dedicated file (you can not consider it simply as a particular case of a finitely presented group). There are many notions, algorithms and techniques which apply only to it: the notion of rank for subgroups, the notion of free factor, the automorphism dynamics (reducibility, decomposition into Nielsen transformations, action on CV space, train-track representations, ...). I have the same feeling for braid groups.

3) I don't know if a systematic call to GAP is needed for the free group especially in terms of efficiency

```
sage: F = FreeGroup('a,b')
sage: a,b = F.generators()
sage: a*b 
a*b
sage: timeit("a*b")
5 loops, best of 3: 512 ms per loop
```
I have a naive implementation of it which is based on sage.combinat.words.* and works more than 1000 times faster! But don't be to careful with that, it is dedicated to another patch.

... and many more to come. In other words, the patch is not ready at all but it is an important piece that Sage needs.

Vincent

 I don't have any previous experience in implementing new classes or using the category framework, but so far i have started with a little proof of concept. I would really apreciate any feedback or help.

+This is an example of some things that you can do so far:
+
+Basic arithmetic in Free and Finitely presented groups:
+
+```
+sage: G=FreeGroup('a,b,c,d,e')
+sage: G.inject_variables()
+Defining a, b, c, d, e
+sage: a*b*c*d/a/a/e
+a*b*c*d*a^-2*e^-1
+sage: H=G.quotient([a*b*a*b,a^2,b^2,c^2,d^2,e^2,a*b*c*d*e*a*b,c*d*e*c*d*e,d*e*d*e])
+sage: H.gens()
+(a, b, c, d, e)
+sage: H([1,2,3])/H([3,2,1])
+a*b*c*a^-1*b^-1*c^-1
+```
+
+Fox derivatives of free group elements, and Alexander matrices of finitely presented groups (the result is not given on the group algebra, but in a Laurent polynomial ring):
+
+```
+sage: (a*b*a/b/a).fox_derivative(a)
+t0*t1 - t0 + 1
+sage: H.alexander_matrix()
+[            t0*t1 + 1          t0^2*t1 + t0                     0                     0                     0]

+Some properties of finitely presented groups. 
+
+```
+sage: G=FreeGroup(3)          
+sage: G.inject_variables()
+Defining x0, x1, x2
+sage: H=G.quotient([x0*x1*x2*x0*x1*x2,x1*x2*x0*x1*x2,x2^2])
+sage: H.simplification_isomorphism()
+Generic morphism:
+  From: Finitely Presented Group on generators ('x0', 'x1', 'x2')

+```
+
+Caution: some methods are no granted to finish, specially if the group is infinite. In that case, the system memory would be exhausted, and the underlying gap session killed, leaving orphaned objects. It would be nice to have a security system that would interrupt the computation before arriving to that, giving just an error message. It's on the to-do list.

It looks like this resolves #876.

- `FreeGroup(n)` should work if n is zero!

First of all, thanks for writing in this code, this is something that we totally need to get into Sage!

I have been playing around with some finitely presented groups and found a few oddities

```
sage: G = FreeGroup("x,y")
sage: G.inject_variables()
Defining x, y
sage: H = G.quotient([x^5, y^4, y*x*y^3*x^3])
sage: xx = H(x)
sage: xx^5
x^5
```
I expected that to show 1 or `Identity`. GAP also behaves strangely on this front. 
At least equality seems to behave properly:

```
sage: xx^5 == H(1)
True
```
However, it gets completely broken when going to the group ring, which is bad:

```
sage: R = GroupAlgebra(H)
sage: R(xx)^5
x^5
sage: R(xx)^5 == R(1)
False
sage: R(xx^5) == R(1)
False
```
Finally there are some constructions that I'd expect to work but don't, for instance `H` is an almost dihedral group of order 20, which can be computed in GAP but not in Sage:

```
sage: H.order()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
...
```
I haven't really read the code, but if you are wrapping the GAP code this can be sorted out by calling the `gap.Order()`method on the underlying gap object. Which, incidentally, also doesn't work:

```
sage: gap(H)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...

sage: H._gap_()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError
...
```
This last part should be very easy to fix and would probably ease wrapping up other GAP functions.

Gap doesn't try to reduce elements of finitely presented groups to normal form because, in general, it is an undecideable problem. The package kbmag has some algorithms to look for confluent rewriting systems and automatic structures, which would allow a normal form reduction in some cases. I have thought about including this in my code, but since it deppends on an external package (which is not even in the optional gap_packes spkg) i would prefear to tackle that in an external spkg that would include also kbmag.

I don't know why comparison doesn't work in the group algebra. I should take a look at the group algebra code to see what is going on.

To compute the order of a group, use the .size method. You will either get an answer or exhaust the system memory, kill the internal gap session, and get a mess. You can even get an expression as symmetric group.

In your example:

``` 
sage: G = FreeGroup("x,y") 
sage: G.inject_variables() 
Defining x, y 
sage: H = G.quotient([x^5, y^4, y*x*y^3*x^3]) 
sage: H.size()

sage: H.permutation_group()
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2,6,9,3)(4,12,10,7,13)(5,15,8,11,16)(14,18,20,19,17), (1,4,14,5)(2,7,17,8)(3,10,18,11)(6,12,19,16)(9,13,20,15)]
```

Finally, the method .gap() gives you the gap representation of the objects (that is, an object of the class sage.interfaces.gap.GapElement). So if you want to call some gap function foo on one of this objects, you just need to call something like H.gap().foo() .

Maybe i should write a comprehensive documentation. That's another item on the to-do list.

I am aware of the problem of finding a normal form for elements. My (badly made) point is that it should be clearly documented as this is the kind of thing that would get a student easily confused. The group algebra comparison is a real problem, though.

Something that might be useful here would be to allow the user give some reduction rules. In my example, it is very clear that all the group elements can be written as `x<sup>ay</sup>b` for suitable `a` and `b`; in an ideal world, I could tell Sage to simplify my elements by repeatedly using the three rules
1. "Reduce powers of `x` modulo 5"
2. "Reduce powers of `y` modulo 4"
3. "Replace each `y<sup>ax</sup>b` by `x<sup>(2a+2b)y</sup>b`"
until none of them can be further applied. Mathematica excels at this type of operation (reduction by pattern matching). Perhaps the combinat guys have just the right tool for doing this, but anyway this is certainly a matter for a follow-up ticket once we have the basic functionality running.

The `.gap()` method didn't work for me with your patch, but maybe I didn't use it properly, I will try again when I get home.

I would also suggest having a method which returns the codomain of `G.simplification_isomorphism()`; if I have generators and relations, I would like to see if there is a nice accessible simplification.

```
    sage: G = FreeGroup('g')
    sage: E = G.quotient((G.gen(0),))

```
doesn't work, complaining that `ValueError: variable name must be nonempty`.

The .gap method seems to work okay, although I haven't tested it very thoroughly. From looking at other files in sage/groups/, it looks like you should instead implement both `G._gap_()` (to return the GAP object corresponding to G) and `G._gap_init_()` (to return the string representation of the corresponding GAP object). But I'm not sure about this: maybe you only need one of these methods. Anyway, if you do it right, then `gap(G)` will return the GAP version of G.

Overall, your code should be consistent with the other groups available in Sage, both in terms of public methods (for example, using `cardinality` instead of `size`) and private ones (`_gap_`, `_gap_init_`, etc.)

Solved the problem with free groups of rank 0.

Added cardinality and order as aliases for size.

Added FinitelyPresentedGroup.simplify_presentation that returns the codomain of simplification_isomorphisms.

It is all implemented in a new patch that should be aplyed over the previous one.

Can you please make simple speed benchmarks in different systems? I have observed a big speed difference from my gentoo box to a mandriva system (where sage runs in a ubuntu chroot). I suspect it has to do with the sage-gap communication (maybe something with the way shm or pts work?)


Here are my benchmarks:

In my gentoo box (intel core i7, 6GB RAM)

```
sage: time F=FreeGroup(4)
Time: CPU 0.00 s, Wall: 0.00 s
sage: time F.inject_variables()
Defining x0, x1, x2, x3
Time: CPU 0.03 s, Wall: 0.04 s
sage: time x=F([1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4])
Time: CPU 0.01 s, Wall: 0.01 s
sage: time x^2
x0*x1*x2*x3*x0*x1*x2*x3*x0*x1*x2*x3*x0*x1*x2*x3
Time: CPU 0.07 s, Wall: 0.08 s
```

In the mandriva-chroot-ubuntu (two AMD-opteron 6100, 16 cores in total, 128 GB RAM):

```
sage: time F=FreeGroup(4)
Time: CPU 0.03 s, Wall: 0.50 s
sage: time F.inject_variables()
Defining x0, x1, x2, x3
Time: CPU 0.04 s, Wall: 2.32 s
sage: time x=F([1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4])
Time: CPU 0.02 s, Wall: 0.86 s
sage: time x^2
x0*x1*x2*x3*x0*x1*x2*x3*x0*x1*x2*x3*x0*x1*x2*x3
Time: CPU 0.10 s, Wall: 5.34 s
```

It really makes no sense such a slowdown. Any ideas?

There was a definite problem with Sage-GAP communication in Ubuntu.  It was Ubuntu's fault if I recall correctly.  Do you have a recent Ubuntu?  I first noticed this about a year ago, and it seems to be better (fixed?) now (with 12.04).  

Here's one indicator (I didn't look very hard for the root explanation):

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/vLGiLlGXH-U/X4qsKwTK57kJ

Try doctesting the sandpile.py module, it takes forever in the presence of this problem.

The ubuntu chroot is 12.04. Also, i have similar slowdowns in previous versions of sage under mandriva (i couldn't compile the last versions because of the bug in the time command).

Testing sandpile takes forever indeed.

In the link you gave Dima says that the kernel is to blame.

Can you test it in different systems?

Looks great! Some libgap notes:
* libgap makes sure to lazy import itself, since gap startup takes some time. Hence `sage/libs/all.py` defines

    ```
    from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
    lazy_import('sage.libs.gap.libgap', 'libgap')
  ```
  You should either follow the same pattern and lazily import your own code from `sage/groups/all.py`. This will help Sage in the long run to avoid long startup times. Also, its better to import libgap as `from sage.libs.all import libgap`, then you get the lazy importer.

There are a couple of code style and documentation issues:
* Always put an empty line before function/method declarations (that is, before "def ...")
* Space after comma: `def `__init__`(self, ll=[], parent=None)` instead of `def `__init__`(self,ll=[],parent=None)`
* Use

    ```
    EXAMPLES::
       
        sage: 1+1
  ```
  instead of the multi-line 

    ```
    EXAMPLES: 

    :: 

        sage: 1+1	
  ```
* Its encouraged to generate intermediate variables instead of very long lines:

    ```
    self._gap_repr_=parent.gap().One().FamilyObj().ElementOfFpGroup(libgap.eval(str(l)).AbstractWordTietzeWord(parent.gap().FreeGroupOfFpGroup().GeneratorsOfGroup())) 
  ```
  would be more legible as

    ```
    gap = parent.gap()
    gens = gap.FreeGroupOfFpGroup().GeneratorsOfGroup()
    element = gap.One().FamilyObj().ElementOfFpGroup(libgap.eval(str(l))
    self._gap_rep = element.AbstractTietzeWord(gens)
  ```
* Module-level documentation for the new files, and add them to the reference manual index  (that is, to `doc/en/reference/groups.rst`) so the documentation is actually built.
* Input parameters need to be documented consistently. That is, consistently use `INPUT:` and `OUTPUT:` sections in the docstrings. You know what the methods are for, but we don't ;-)

This is a really nice contribution!

`ParentWithGens` is deprecated, see the beginning of `sage/structure/parent_gens.pyx`. You should use `Parents.__init__(self, gens=..., category=Groups())` or so. I know thats not as well-documented as it should be. You do already import `Groups` but don't use it. Did you have any problems with the new parents?

For comparison you should override `_cmp_` in elements, otherwise you circumvent the coercion system. 

Another minor issue, don't use catch-all `except:`. You almost certainly don't want to catch `KeyboardInterrupt`, for example. Use `except StandardError:` to catch all *errors*.

Since there isn't any example yet for how to use libGAP, I though it would be nice to use the finitely generated groups to demonstrate what it can be used for. Do you have any other patches that you have already based on this ticket? Otherwise I'd like to make some changes to use libgap better.

Ok, i will try to wee if swtiching from parentwithgens to parents is not too painful.
 I remember i tried different ways of inheritingt, and finally decided this one, but i don't remember exactly why.

What do you mean exactly by overrode `_cmp_`? isn't that what i do already?

I have no ither patches that deppend on this, but i was just planning to start with something to give support to the kbmag gap package, which would allow to deal with reduced forms of the elements of finitely presented groups (when Knuth-Bendix or the search for automatic structure succeeds).

I get something like this:

sage: F.inject_variables()
Defining a, b, c
sage: a._cmp_(a*b/b)
0
sage: cmp(a,a*b/b)
0
sage: a.__cmp__(a*b/b)

```

but 

```
sage: a==a*b/b

Ok, thanks for the work. It is all fixed now.

Although this tocket is starting to depend on so many others (gap update, libgap, parent...) that i just fear it will never get merged ;)

I have some new features and improvements in mind, but i think it is better to get this stabilized and merged first, and then start working in improving it.

I've factored out repeated code for implementing Sage parents/elements on top of LibGAP groups/elements into `libgap_wrapper.pyx`.
* Don't import everything into the global namespace. Lots of doctests
  were failing because lazy importing '*' is not what you want. Generally speaking, never  import `*`.
* `Group.__init__` already calls `Parent.__init__`, don't call it twice
* Support the `G.<a,b> = FreeGroup()` syntax
* use `_assign_names()` to store generator names, no point in storing
  them again in `_gens_str_`.
* The first line of the docstring should be imperative: "Return x"
  instead of "Returns x"
* I've shortened some method names, e.g. `g.TietzeList()` -> `g.Tietze`
* I don't think we need `G.size()` in addition to `G.cardinality()` and
  `G.order()`. 
* Method names shouldn't sound like they mutate the object,
  e.g. `G.simplified()` instead of `G.simplify()`
* To convert different group presentations I'd prefer
  `G.as_permutation_group()` instead of `G.permutation_group()`. In
  particular since GAP knows so many ways to write a group, so it'll
  be less confusing in the long run.

I worked my way through everything but the braid group stuff. That is, I think anything but `braid.py` is good to go. The braid groups still need some work as the base classes changed a bit. The following still needs to be done:

* Support `B.<s,t,u> = BraidGroup()` syntax
* remove `__cmp__` to use GAP's internal comparison methods
* remove unused imports
* move imports that are used only once (e.g. plotting) into the method that uses them. This helps to avoid circular imports in the long run.

I won't have time to work on this for at least a week, if you are interested please give it a try!

I've recently updated the libgap patch #13687, make sure that you have the newest version.

If you just apply trac_12339_fpgroups.3.patch then everything should be fine. At least all doctests pass for me. The braid patchs needs to be updated, though.

Also note that I've removed `FinitelyPresentedGroup` from the global namespace. Since you need to constrcut a `FreeGroup` first there is no point in having an extra symbol; just create finitely presented groups as quotients.

Good, the patch from #13588 fixes things. Thanks. 

I'm running into another problem, which I found by working on #13254. I'm not sure what the issue is: two different presentations for the same group? Anyway, I'm getting a segfault, at least on OS X 10.8:

it seems to be more subtle, as the group presentations are different.
GAP has [several](http://www.gap-system.org/Gap3/Manual3/C023S008.htm) different classes of objects for finitely presented groups, with some of them having presentation explicit.

GAP can check for finite group isomorphism.

The concept of free group in Sage ought to be better defined, i.e. currently it seems to be a group with an attached presentation. It would be good to have this explicitly explained in documentation.

I think the issue is that line 93 of braid.py should be changed from

```
from sage.groups.finitely_presented import FinitelyPresentedGroupElement
```
to

```
from sage.groups.finitely_presented import FinitelyPresentedGroup, FinitelyPresentedGroupElement

The final patch adds:

* Indentation & spacing fixed

* Renamed `BraidGroup_class.MappingClassGroup()` -> `BraidGroup_class.mapping_class_group()`. Use CamelCase for classes, lower-case underscore names for methods.

* Let the coercion system discover mapping group actions on suitable free groups, so the following works without further ado:

  ```
  sage: B.<b0,b1,b2> = BraidGroup() 
  sage: F.<f0,f1,f2,f3> = FreeGroup() 
  sage: f1 * b1 
  f1*f2*f1^-1
  ```

As far as I'm concerned this ticket is good (enough) to go.

Comparison should be fixed, of course. By default, `==` should just compare the presentation of the group and not up to isomorphism. Checking up to isomorphism should be done with an `is_isomorphic()` method so its not used in caching.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:75'></a>\nI have some comments regarding this patch. I myself can not give much technical input, but I have a colleague here who has been trying to use this and has come across some inconsistencies.\n\n1. Is there a reason why a `FreeGroupElement` does not have the `__call__` method? A `FreeMonoidElement` does have the `__call__` method. This is needed to make the following work\n\n```python\nsage: G.<a,b> = FreeGroup()\nsage: a.subs(a=1,b=2) # We would expect the answer to be 1\na\n```\n2. Related to the implementation of the `__call__` method is the following problem. Suppose in order to make `subs()` work, we implement the `__call__` method. The current code has to call `a.Tietze()` to get the index of the free generator `a` and its exponent. For a more complicated expression the output is as follows, and we would have to go along and parse the output tuple to find out the exponent by counting. Is there any method (maybe in GAP) which outputs just a list of tuples `[(generator1, exponent1), (generator2, exponent2),...]`.

I have some comments regarding this patch. I myself can not give much technical input, but I have a colleague here who has been trying to use this and has come across some inconsistencies.

1. Is there a reason why a `FreeGroupElement` does not have the `__call__` method? A `FreeMonoidElement` does have the `__call__` method. This is needed to make the following work

```python
sage: G.<a,b> = FreeGroup()
sage: a.subs(a=1,b=2) # We would expect the answer to be 1
a
```
2. Related to the implementation of the `__call__` method is the following problem. Suppose in order to make `subs()` work, we implement the `__call__` method. The current code has to call `a.Tietze()` to get the index of the free generator `a` and its exponent. For a more complicated expression the output is as follows, and we would have to go along and parse the output tuple to find out the exponent by counting. Is there any method (maybe in GAP) which outputs just a list of tuples `[(generator1, exponent1), (generator2, exponent2),...]`. This is again how `FreeMonoid` is implemented.

```
sage: (a^2 * b^-3).Tietze()
(1, 1, -2, -2, -2)
sage: (a^2 * b^-3).some_function() # some function which gives (generator, exponent) tuples
[(a, 2), (b, -3)]
```
3. There is also this inconsistency in the output of the following two functions. In language, they say the same thing, but they are not mathematically equal (according to the current implementation):

```python
sage: G.<a,b> = FreeGroup()
sage: test = (a).fox_derivative(a)
sage: f = test.parent()
sage: g = GroupAlgebra(G, ZZ)
sage: print f
Group algebra of Free Group on generators {a, b, c, d, e} over Integer Ring
sage: print g
Group algebra of group "Free Group on generators {a, b, c, d, e}" over base ring Integer Ring
sage: print f == g
False
```

Can you open a new ticket for feature requests? I'm happy to help but not on this ticket.

3) is a consequence of the combinat guys having their own group algebra implementation:

```
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModule_with_category'>
sage: type(g)
<class 'sage.algebras.group_algebra_new.GroupAlgebra_with_category'>
