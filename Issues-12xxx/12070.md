```
When using piecewise functions across modules, you can find yourself unable to avoid the DeprecationWarning resulting from positional arguments, e.g. f(0).

A small example:

some_library.py

```
from sage.all import *

def make_f():
    x = SR.symbol('x', domain='real')
    f = piecewise([[(-1,1), x**2]])
    return f
```

some_script.py

```
from some_library import *

my_f = make_f()
my_f(0)
```

There is no obvious (or un-obvious, as far as I know) way to avoid the warning here.

The output, for reference:

```
$ sage some_script.py 
some_script.py:4: DeprecationWarning: Substitution using function-call syntax and unnamed arguments is deprecated and will be removed from a future release of Sage; you can use named arguments instead, like EXPR(x=..., y=...)
  my_f(0)
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>This produces the same output in the Sage console (directly after starting it) so I doubt it has anything to do with modules or `.py` / `.sage` files in particular.

Indeed something is screwed up here, though.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Well, in a sage prompt there's an easy workaround: write f(x) = piecewise(...) instead of just f = ...

That doesn't work outside of a prompt, though, and the preprocessor breaks some imports if you try to rename the *.py files to *.sage.

It's essential to be explicit about the variable name. See:

```
var('foo,bar')
f = piecewise([[(-1,1), (foo+bar).function(foo)]])
```
Close as invalid or resolve by updating documentation?

Ok, but the existing doctests and examples (mis)use that same format (I never knew I could/should change an expression into a function). The ones that don't, rely on the preparsing of `f(x) = ...` that isn't helpful to people using `piecewise()` in python code. What do we do with `f(x) = 1`, change it to `f = SR(1).function(x)`?

I think `f = SR(1).function(x)` is stupid, but having examples that only work when preparsed isn't great either. How about we just fix this for symbolic expressions of one variable?

```
if is_Expression(f):
    if len(f.variables()) == 1:
        f = f.function(f.variables()[0]) # We know what you meant bro.
    else:
        raise Whatever()
```

If there's a good reason not to do that, then the examples illustrating e.g. `(x**2).function(x)` should at least be prominent.
