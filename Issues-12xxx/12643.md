The irreducibility of generalized permutation does not work

```
sage: p = iet.GeneralizedPermutation('1 2 2 3 3','1 4 4')
sage: p.is_irreducible()
True
```
But it should returns False.

The patch corrects this behavior. The implementation is a bit modified and many doctests are added.

**Assignee:** @videlec

**Merged:** sage-5.3.beta0

This looks good, as far as I can tell, because I am not able to check the algorithms..

And the bot is happy. Two minor comments :

* One should say "There exists a decomposition" (instead of "exist")

* The reference to "Boissy-Lanneau" is not complete (journal, etc)

Hello,

Thank you Frederic for your relecture. Do you think I need to add a proof for the algorithm within the documentation?

I made the modification (and remove one r for corrrects in the description of the ticket).

Well, I was just saying that I do not understand the underlying mathematics, so that I cannot check if the given examples are indeed irreducible or not. I do not think that it is necessary to add a proof.

Is there an easy place where I can try to understand the meaning of

iet.GeneralizedPermutation('a a b','b c c') ?

or 

GP('1 2 3 4 5 1','5 6 6 4 3 2')

Maybe I can just give a positive review without understanding, but I would prefer if I can be just slightly more serious.

You have to think as the standard two lines notation for permutations. For example, the permutation 

```
p(1) = 2, p(2) = 1, p(3) = 3
```
would be denoted

```
1 2 3
2 1 3
```
Then iet.Permutation('1 2 3', '2 1 3') is just a version of the permutation above. But we are interested in the so called interval exchange transformations (see Figure 1 p. 8 of [BL]) and it is better to have two order of labels instead of a permutation. The object iet.Permutation is two lines of symbols where each symbol appears once in the first line and once in the second.

Generalized Permutations encode the combinatorics of more complicated maps called linear involution (see Figure 6 p 16 of [BL]). The object iet.GeneralizedPermutation is two lines of symbols where each symbol appear twice.
