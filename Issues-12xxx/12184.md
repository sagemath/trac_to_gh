In William Stein's Bordeaux lectures he gave an example of an elliptic curve *not in the tables* (of conductor 154907).  But as of version 4.8 that curve is in the tables in the optional larger database, and so that example causes a doctest failure in sage/doc/en/bordeaux/elliptic_curves.rst.

The patch changes the example to one whose conductor is larger.

To test:  apply the patch and test sage/doc/en/bordeaux/elliptic_curves.rst both before and after installing the optional package at #11587  (i.e. http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/cremona-database/database_cremona_ellcurve-20111029.spkg).
