The following code leads to the typeset error:

`Can't find closing delimiter for \verb`

```
x = AA['x'].0
view(factor(x^4 + x^3 + 2 * x^2 + x + 2))
```
The latex output is (from notebook interface)

```

I believe it should be the desired behavior. Numbers by themselves are not sandwiched between a `\verb| |` construct. So, I don't understand why numbers ending with ? should be displayed as verbatim. With this patch, the only case where ? might be displayed non-verbatim is when one of the following occurs by themselves: `?`, `-?` or `+?`. All three of these are grammatically incorrect and I can't imagine a situation where they can arise by themselves.

I will do that. Sorry for not noticing it.

It took a while, but I have finally tracked it down to a line in `sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx`, inside the `_latex_()` function of the class `Polynomial`:

```
        s = s.replace("|","")
```
I don't know why this replacement has to be performed, but this is the reason why the `|` from `\verb` is being stripped off. Example print statements are in the following output (I will attach the patch containing the print statements shortly, so that you can reproduce this):

```
