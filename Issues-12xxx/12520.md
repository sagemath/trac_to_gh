Goal: have the non english documentation, and in particular the thematic tutorial translations, available as static/live doc in the notebook


For example, one would want the French tutorial in `sage/doc/fr/tutorial/` to be accessible through an URL like:

```
http://localhost:8000/doc/live-fr/tutorial/
```

A quick hack is to replace 'en' by 'fr' in the definition of `sagenb.notebook.twist.DOC`, but then you only get the French doc :-)
