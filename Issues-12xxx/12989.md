This patch adds the two Ellingham-Horton graphs to Sage's constructors.

Ugly things. I am not eager to add other "topological graphs" again `:-P`

And one last review patch! (For now :) )

Other than formatting, I fixed the rST wikipedia links, standardized the graph names, and eliminated the needless variable `x` which you were using during development I guess.

If you agree with the review patch, we can set this ticket to positive review.

This takes several minutes to doctest, which is too much.

More generally: you cannot keep adding stuff to `graph_generators.py` forever. At some point, it will be needed to split up this file (perhaps into a new directory `sage/graphs/generators`).
