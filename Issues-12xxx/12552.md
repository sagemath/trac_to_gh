```
The degree of a polynomial over `RDF` is of type `int` and not a sage Integer.

```
sage: R.<x> = RDF[]
sage: type(x.degree())
<type 'int'>
sage: x.degree().divides(6)
Error
```

This is not consistent with polynomials over other rings:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: type(x.degree())
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: x.degree().divides(6)
True
```

The attached patch fixes this.

Depends on #14482

IIRC, this was a design decision for speed (though it could be revisited). We should at least be consistent between all the polynomial types.

As an aside, note that Integer(x) is preferable to ZZ(x).
