This was reported on sage-support:

  http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/t/fa439b8dd28daaa8

As of 4.8.alpha6,

```
sage: g = function('g', var('t'))
sage: f = 3*g + g**2 + t
sage: f.coeffs(g)
...
ValueError: The name "g(t)" is not a valid Python identifier.
```

This didn't throw a ValueError in 4.7,

```
sage: f.coeffs(g)
[[g(t)^2 + t + 3*g(t), 0]]
```

but the result was still not the expected one. The correct answer would be,

```
sage: f.coeffs(g)
[[t, 0],[3, 1], [1, 2]]
```
