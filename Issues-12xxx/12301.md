In the docstrings, the format:

.. SEEALSO::

    Material goes here indented some from the see also above.


produces a fancy little box in the html pages similar to the note or warning boxes. However, this is not specified in the Conventions for Coding document.  It would be great if the Conventions for Coding document could be appended so people will know that they can use this.
