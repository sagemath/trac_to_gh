It is not possible to *watch* a file which has spaces in its absolute path. This is an example:

```
sage: f1 = 'a.sage'; open(f1,'w').write("print 'h'")             
sage: attach a.sage   
h
sage: attach
attach          attached_files

I propose we deprecate the support for multiple filenames separated by spaces. The documentation of the function says nothing about multiple files, and since filenames can have spaces, it's impossible or very difficult to properly support a space-separated list of strings that can themselves have spaces!

If we want multiple files, I say the user should give a list.

Thanks for calling my code "totally crazy".  I think you are mischaracterizing what the code does.   The point of the eval is not to "distinguish between strings with and without spaces".  The eval allows for the filename to be determined by valid Python expressions, the motivating case being

```
   load DATA+"file.sage"
```
which is commonly used in the notebook.    It was never meant to be used with paths that have spaces.

It's possible I'm mischaracterizing...but my understanding of Python function call semantics is that by the time you enter this function, "`filename`" has already been evaluated. Otherwise, I'm not sure how this could work in the interpreter:

```
sage: def f(s):
....:     print 'the last character is {0}'.format(s[-1])
....:  
sage: s = 'def'                                                                                                             
sage: f('abc' + s)
the last character is f
```
The function `f` does not see "`'abc' + s`"; it sees the result of evaluating `'abc' + s`. The function doesn't need `eval()`, and so I didn't think that `load` or `attach` would either.

Would you prefer that we restore the positive review here and merge this, then, after #12719 is merged, deprecate the keyword versions of `load` and `attach` and make them functions that accept either: (1) a string, which must be the name of one file, or (2) a list/tuple/etc of strings?

Your confused about what's going on.  If you put

```
    print "filename = '%s'"%filename
```
at the top of the load function, then do `sage -br` and type

```
sage: load "f" + "oo.py"
```
you'll see

```
filename = '"f" + "oo.py"'
```
which illustrates that the input is not eval'd.  That's why the docstring starts with 

```
    Executes a file in the scope given by ``globals``.  The
    ``filename`` itself is also evaluated in the scope.
```
This is documented behavior.
