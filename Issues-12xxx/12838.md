The patch fixes the issue that the one element root poset in type A1 was not returned correctly.

```
sage: Phi = RootSystem(['A',1]).root_poset(); Phi
Finite poset containing 1 elements
sage: Phi.cover_relations()
[]
```

I also added the facade option for root posets.

In sage/combinat/root_system/root_system.py,

it should be written

Not quite smoothly:

```
applying trac_12838-root_poset_A1-cs.patch
patching file sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realizations.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 507 with fuzz 2 (offset -34 lines).
```

Anyway, I rebased it.
