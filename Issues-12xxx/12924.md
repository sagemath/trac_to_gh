The SchubertPolynomialRing expects a permutation as an index. When a list is given which is not a permutation, the object is created anyway. The problem comes when one tries to expand the polynomial, if the index is not a valid permutation, it makes symmetrica crash which makes Sage crash !

```
sage: S = SchubertPolynomialRing(ZZ)                                  
sage: pol = S([2,1,3])
sage: pol.expand()
x0
sage: pol = S([2,1,1])
sage: pol.expand()
function: mult_apply_integer(2) 
python: function: mult_apply_integer(2) 
: Operation not permitted
```
So the idea would be to check when the polynomial is created that the input is correct and raise an exception at this point if it's not.

New behaviour is now :

```
sage: X = SchubertPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: X._element_constructor_([1,2,1])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: The input [1, 2, 1] is not a valid permutation
sage: X._element_constructor_(Permutation([1,2,1]))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: The input [1, 2, 1] is not a valid permutation

```
Tests have been added into the documentation.

The patch is attached to the ticket and also available into Sage-Combinat
