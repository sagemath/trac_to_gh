I was wondering why the feedback vertex set method in [DiGraph](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/browser/sage/graphs/digraph.py#L1578) returns Set(![0]) instead of the empty set at dag the test. Is there any reason?

Otherwise I'd like to change this.

I do not get the "at dag the test" part, but anyway I should never have made this method return a "set" object when all the others return lists of vertices. What is the behaviour you do not like ?

This patch still needs work ! The doctests do not pass, which is natural as the patch changes the output :

Besides, the documentation should also be updated, as it would otherwise keep claiming that the method returns a set when it is actually a list.

It's true that it's a bit complicated at first to think of everything, but unless we do it immediately we would have to create more patches afterwards to fix these problems... The next version should be good, though ! `;-)`
