Hello everybody !!!

Michael Walter reported a bug that could happen with the current CBC package. This spkg used to contain several files to enable the use of the CPLEX solver in old versions of Sage, stuff which had remained there so that the package would stay compatible with those old versions of Sage.
It has been a while, though.
It has been a while, and besides, this stuff actually created problems when somebody installed cplex before cbc : the cbc spkg tried to compile the CPLEX stuff even on new versions of Sage, and Sage actually did not like that `:-)`

The new spkg is available there, and the problem mentionned above is actually solved by removing some files and several lines in the former spkg-install.

While I was at it, I updated the source from 2.3 to 2.7.5, which is worth doing already.

Here it is : 
http://www.steinertriples.fr/ncohen/cbc-2.7.5.spkg

(there is also a small patch removing a few characters from module_list.py)

There is, indeed, no `librt` in the directory specified. Is that supposed to be linked?

I must have spent 2 or 3 hours finding out that this solved a bug on my own machine. Without this librt flag, any call to the library immediately fails -_-

`8-O 8-O`

For once, I figured out on my own what to remove it from (please tell me it's the file, `module_list.py`). It compiled fine, and I was able to run one of my favorite LPs:

```
sage: lp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='Coin')
sage: lp.add_constraint(lp[0]-lp[1],min=1)
sage: lp.add_constraint(2*lp[0]-3*lp[1],min=1)
sage: lp.add_constraint(lp[0],min=1)
sage: lp.add_constraint(lp[1],min=1)
sage: lp.solve()
0.0
sage: lp.get_values([lp[0],lp[1]])
[2.0, 1.0]

It's a regular, happy camper. I haven't tested it much, but so far it seems to be doing just fine.

Out of curiosity, *are* those `ctypedef`s supposed to go in a certain order? Cython documentation doesn't seem clear on this.

Some very bad news.

It's true that copying a program many times doesn't generate the same memory corruption that it did before. Unfortunately, that seems to be because it isn't copying anything. Worse, we get an "Unhandled SIGSEV" if we copy & try to add constraints.

I'll try to look at it...

Hello !

Yep, the number of threads is the number of paralell process that coin uses to solve problem. It is really nice to have it use all the processors available, but there *IS* to be some way to set it through this new class. The other problem is the verbosity level.

<div id="comment:15" align="right">comment:15</div>

I think I've found threads.

In class `OsiClpSolverInterface`, there's a method,

```
  ClpSimplex * getModelPtr();
```
It turns out that `ClpSimplex` inherits from `ClpModel`, wherein we find

```
  void setNumberThreads(int value)
```
I am not sure it actually does anything with the threads, since the method is commented with

```
  /// Number of threads (not very operational)
```
but perhaps its descendant `ClpSimplex` does something with it.

To activate this, I am adding the following lines to `OsiSolverInterface.pxd`:

```
cdef extern from "../../local/include/coin/ClpModel.hpp":
     cdef cppclass ClpModel:
        void setNumberThreads(int value)
        int numberThreads()

cdef extern from "../../local/include/coin/ClpSimplex.hpp":
    cdef cppclass ClpSimplex(ClpModel):
        pass

cdef extern from "../../local/include/coin/OsiClpSolverInterface.hpp":
     cdef cppclass OsiClpSolverInterface(OsiSolverInterface):
     ...
         ClpSimplex * getModelPtr()
     ...
```
and in `__cinit__()` for `OsiClpSolverInterface.pyx` now sets it up as:

```
        #self.si = new CoinModel(NULL)
        cdef OsiClpSolverInterface * si_model = self.si
        cdef ClpSimplex * model = si_model.getModelPtr()

        import multiprocessing
        model.setNumberThreads(multiprocessing.cpu_count())
```
As far as I can tell, this seems to work: it compiles & links, and Coin seems to be working properly; that is, I'm not encountering any errors. I don't know how to test it, though; any advice?

Also, does this look sensible? If so, I'll upload a new patch containing all the changes I've made so far.

Well, no, defining a method to set the number of thread in a class representing LINEAR programs (and not integer ones) is not very sensible. But that's hardly your fault `O_o`

Well, the best way to check that it works is to solve a hard integer problem. I advise you to give this a try :

```
sage: graphs.Grid2dGraph(10,10).minor(graphs.CompleteGraph(5))
```
But do not expect it to return an answer `:-P`

If the flag works it should appear in "htop", or any software you use to know the cpu load.

By the way, if I want to test parallelism, how do I tell graphs to use the Coin solver? I am not sure that, when I tested it earlier, it was using Coin.

Hello ! 

When you talk about "the model", do you mean that you have to copy all the constraints and variables again if you ever want to 1) solve a LP 2) add a constraint 3) solve it again ?

> When you talk about "the model", do you mean that you have to copy all the constraints and variables again if you ever want to 1) solve a LP 2) add a constraint 3) solve it again ?

Here's a rough sketch of what works.
1. let *si* = **new** *OsiClpSolverInterface*()
2. **while not** *done*:
   a. add constraints, variables, whatnot to *si*
   b. let *model* = **new** CbcModel(*si*)
   c. *model.branchAndCut*()
   d. extract solutions from *model.si*, evaluate *done*

Step 2b clones *si*, so I think the answer to your question is, *yes*. I find this deeply unsatisfying myself, but if I try to move that step outside the loop and modify Cbc's model after solving, Sage gives a `SIGSEV`.

The only alternative I know of right now is to use `OsiClpSolverInterface` alone, but (a) the developers have told me repeatedly that its `branchAndBound`() is **orders of magnitude** slower than `CbcModel`, and (b) this is the method that ignores the `setLogLevel` method.

As I say, I've inquired at their list:

    http://list.coin-or.org/pipermail/cbc/2012-January/000751.html

but as of this moment, I don't yet have an answer.

Actually, all this discussion reminds me of something. `CbcModel` has an `assignSolver()` method whose parameter has type `OsiSolverInterface * &`. Notice the pointer; the argument for the constructor I'm using has type `OsiSolverInterface &`, which as I understand it necessarily creates a copy of the parameter. ` One reason I'm not using it now is that, when I was trying to, I was also having issues with Cython's quirks. I'll see if I can use that; looking at the code, it doesn't seem to clone the solver.

Good news and bad news.

1. `setModelOwnsSolver()` allows me to retain the solver interface after `CbcModel` finishes with it. I can get solutions, even add new constraints.
2. Unfortunately, if I do add a constraint after solving once, `CbcModel` doesn't seem capable of solving the new system. Even if I add a constraint that maintains feasibility, I get the message,

   `MIPSolverException: 'CBC : The problem or its dual has been proven infeasible!'`
3. There are **no** examples of using either `setModelOwnsSolver()` or `assignSolver()`.

I'm guessing the designers never imagined that someone might want to add constraints to the system. I could be wrong, and hope I am. If they reply to my latest email, we'll know for sure.

As things stand now, we have two options: use either `OsiClpSolverInterface` only with its verbosity and slow `branchAndBound()`, or `OsiClpSolverInterface` and `CbcModel` with a fast `branchAndBound()` but possibly slow solving with new constraints.

Right now, I'm favorable to `CbcModel`, since that's what the Coin developers are pushing. Also, it takes care of the verbosity issue. Unfortunately, setting the number of threads in the model doesn't seem to help with multiprocessing, at least if the example you gave me is an indicator (assuming it's using `Coin`, which I think it is, but I'm not 100% sure).

I have a working patch. Names of the problem, rows, and columns are implemented in the Cython object as Python strings (the `str` type). If C++'s `std::string` is somehow accessible from Sage, I can implement them in the C++ object instead (i.e., the solver), but I'll need info on how to do that. I've left an inquiry at sage-devel.

One doctest doesn't pass: in `mip.pyx`, the test of the `write_lp()` method in line 685 raises a `NotImplementedError`. Since this was *never* implemented with Coin, I don't consider it a deal breaker. I think I can fix it if you want; the `OsiSolverInterface` provides a `writeMps()` method that

  Write[s] the problem in MPS format to the specified file.

So, I can implement that, too, if people insist, but I don't want to, and I'm not sure if the `writeMps()` method does what the `write_lp()` method is supposed to do. So, I won't do anything for now. `:-P`

Otherwise, **all doctests pass.** Please review.

How is the spkg built? When I build the Cbc libraries on either Linux or Mac, I don't have to specify this; I just configure and make. Are we not able to do that w/sage?

I would have been glad to ignore that myself, but that was before I had to deal with this CBC spkg.

Here's the problem : during the "./configure" step CBC detects (on linux) that the rt library is available and detects (on mac) that it is not in which case it uses a different code. The libraries are built. Then we build the coin_backend.pyx file in Sage, which calls the Coin library, hence this file has to be linked with the coin library. If (under linux) we do not also link coin_backend.pyx with rt then we get an exception saying that a function is missing in the lib. So we have to add a "rt" flag to module_list.py so that Sage links it. Yeah, but then it does not compile on Mac anymore because the library does not exist.
Ideally, we would like to force the ./configure script to ignore the rt library on linux but I have no idea how to do that. 
Would you know how to get away with all that ? `:-P`

What exactly should I check? I traced through the code, and found that one of the `box`es contains the following result:

```
{0: {0: 1.0, 1: 0.0, 2: 0.0}, 1: {0: 0.0, 1: 0.0, 2: 1.0}, 2: {0: 0.0, 1: 0.0, 2: 1.0}, 3: {0: 0.0, 1: 0.99999999999999989, 2: 0.0}, 4: {0: 1.0, 1: 0.0, 2: 0.0}}

I was under the impression that Cbc was called as the default solver when it's installed, so wouldn't that be the one to patch? or am I wrong?

Nathann, I asked sage to put print `Coin` or `GLPK`, depending on which was initialized, and the the output is `Coin`. So the `coin_backend` is being initialized.

I think the `GLPK` output is from a different test in the same file (line 481, for `linear_program()`).

So the problem seems to be the Coin patch in this case. I'll look for how to fix it, but if you have suggestions, let me know.

Well, I usually fix this twice : by relacing the ``==1`` in the return value by of the method building the LP by a ``>.5``, and by adding a "if the variabe is binary, round it before returning it" in the functon returning the values of variables in the solver backends.

I see that `binpacking()` sets the variable to binary, but I don't see any rounding in any of the backends. I do see that in the `coin_backend` we have (line 252)

```
        elif vtype == 0:
            self.si.setColLower(variable, 0)
            self.si.setInteger(variable)
            self.si.setColUpper(variable, 1)
```
which sets the binary variable.

If I infer correctly, it's `optimize.py` that should be patched, so that `binpacking` checks the rounded result, and not a clear `1`?

Helloooooooo !!

Well, actually I only did it for Gurobi and CPLEX `:-)`

It looks like it should also be done for GLPK (which until now seemed to round it by itself, as no doctest broke), and most probably for Coin `^^;`

Can you tell me which one?

Since Cbc becomes the default solver when you install coin, I recently noticed that after copying and trying to change the objective function, Sage would crash, hard. In fact, I was thinking of that this morning before I came down to the computer.

I am not sure what is going on. I know it **used** to work some time ago, since as you know I had been very interested in making Cbc work at one point. I'm planning to look at it again, though since GLPK is now working I was busy working on my research instead.

> Oh, and also : why do you want to cache all the values of the variables in a dictionnary attached to the CoinBackend object ?

If I want to add a constraint after solving once, the Cbc model crashes, hard. I don't remember if it crashes when I add to the model, or when I try to solve. The solution I had found, and which worked at *one* point, was to delete the model, but since OsiClp stores the solution in the model (no joke) you lose the solutions. My solution was to store the values of the variables; I don't remember how, but a dictionary doesn't sound too wrong...

Do you think I should store them in C floats? Do you have a better suggestion?

> It would be nice to see this patch merged in Sage 5.0. Anyway thanks for all the work you did on this ticket `:-)`

I know. I'll try to work on it, but I have no guarantees that I'll have a patch soon.

Because if the first \"solve\" operation said that some variable had a value of 1.7, this variable has an upper bound and a lower bound of 1.7 after the first call to solve. That's awful.\n\n> My solution was to store the values of the variables; I don't remember how, but a dictionary doesn't sound too wrong...\n> \n> Do you think I should store them in C floats? Do you have a better suggestion?\n\nWell, then that is a problem  when the user wants to 1) solve a LP 2) add a constraint 3) read the value given to the variables by the *former* call to solve. Actually I mostly wondered about whether we should cache them ourselves at all. In the user backends (that's not necessarily relevant of course, given Coin's \"own constraints\") the solutions are just \"stored by the LP\", as it is done by Coin. As it is more expensive to store them in a dictionary that through Coin's internal storage system, I would rather stand for an exception raised in the situation where the user goes through the 3 steps I listed before. \"If Coin has no variable in memory for some reason, raise an exception saying so\".

Helloooooo !!!

> Can you tell me which one?

Oh sorry, it is in the one-line patch I just attached to this ticket.

> Since Cbc becomes the default solver when you install coin, I recently noticed that after copying and trying to change the objective function, Sage would crash, hard. In fact, I was thinking of that this morning before I came down to the computer.

Hmmm... Did you update Sage to some 5.0 beta in between ? Odd thing `O_o`

> I am not sure what is going on. I know it **used** to work some time ago, since as you know I had been very interested in making Cbc work at one point. I'm planning to look at it again, though since GLPK is now working I was busy working on my research instead.

Well, I'm applying for a permanent position myself and it is taking most of my life `^^;`

> Just this week I've arrived at a point on the problem I was studying that I think I can look at this again, so I will try to fix it.

Same thing here. I may have one week and perhaps a bit more to do my job *mathematics*. And some time for Sage too `:-)`

> > Oh, and also : why do you want to cache all the values of the variables in a dictionnary attached to the CoinBackend object ?
> 
> 
> If I want to add a constraint after solving once, the Cbc model crashes, hard. I don't remember if it crashes when I add to the model, or when I try to solve. 

If I remember correctly it is when you try to solve it.

> The solution I had found, and which worked at *one* point, was to delete the model, but since OsiClp stores the solution in the model (no joke) you lose the solutions. 

Yeah I know, that's the reason why you can not add constraint, then solve, then add constraints, then solve again. Because if the first "solve" operation said that some variable had a value of 1.7, this variable has an upper bound and a lower bound of 1.7 after the first call to solve. That's awful.

> My solution was to store the values of the variables; I don't remember how, but a dictionary doesn't sound too wrong...
> 
> Do you think I should store them in C floats? Do you have a better suggestion?

Well, then that is a problem  when the user wants to 1) solve a LP 2) add a constraint 3) read the value given to the variables by the *former* call to solve. Actually I mostly wondered about whether we should cache them ourselves at all. In the user backends (that's not necessarily relevant of course, given Coin's "own constraints") the solutions are just "stored by the LP", as it is done by Coin. As it is more expensive to store them in a dictionary that through Coin's internal storage system, I would rather stand for an exception raised in the situation where the user goes through the 3 steps I listed before. "If Coin has no variable in memory for some reason, raise an exception saying so". And in this situation the user is free to build his own dictionary before adding constraints so as to remember them while adding new constraints.

All in all, if we are decided to cache it a dictionary is probably the best -quick and easy- solution. But this really is not something Sage should do, that's the solver's job...

> I know. I'll try to work on it, but I have no guarantees that I'll have a patch soon.

I will be thinking about this patch too, but it really is tricky. I mean..... Considering the solver's behaviour, I have to admit that I hate to have to do dirty work above to patch their mistakes `:-/`

But there is one thing I do not understand : with or without this patch constraint generation does not work with Cbc, so what was the point of caching these informations in the first place ? It is still useless to try to solve a LP, then change some parameters, then solve it again ! So why ? `O_o;`

The `OsiClpInterface` doesn't store solutions generated by the model, so if the solutions aren't cached, they're lost as soon as `model` is deleted.

Hellooooooo !!!

> * `range(number)` to `xrange(number)` in `coin_backend.pyx`?

Hmmmm... You think it is faster ? I thought that the "for i in range(n)" were directly translated to C loops when used in a Python file.

Actually, you can do "sage -cython -a file.pyx" to see that. It creates a html file from the pyx file, and you can see by double-clicking on a line how it is translated in C `:-)` 

* adding me as an author? I forgot to do that in the patches I originally submitted (& some work is mine)

Oh sorry ! You mean in the HG patches ? Actually the "all tests pass" contains only your name as the author (I folded many patches and the first one was probably yours) `:-)`

In Python, `range(number)` creates a list of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, while `xrange(number)` is supposed to be more efficient if you don't need the list.

But, you're right about Cython. I looked at the annotated html, and Cython is smart enough not to build the list. So it isn't a problem after all. I had just never checked that before, and assumed that Cython built the list just as Python did.

Not my name in the patch, but my name in the source code. The source code for `coin_backend.pyx` doesn't list me as an author. It's only:

```
"""
COIN Backend

AUTHORS:

- Nathann Cohen (2010-10): initial implementation
"""
```

I'm giving it a positive review anyway (it passes the doctests, even on a mac), but please consider it.

> Not my name in the patch, but my name in the source code. The source code for `coin_backend.pyx` doesn't list me as an author.

Oops sorryyyyyyyyyyyy !! I just uploaded a patch that adds your name at the top of the file, and if you do not like what I wrote there please change it whenever you want, in this ticket or later on `:-)`

And thank you very much for your work on this ticket !!! I would have lost hope ten times if I had had to do it alone `:-D`

Well, it has all the characteristics of a "major" modifications

1) I gave up ten times since the ticket was opened
2) I have no idea what the code looked like before
