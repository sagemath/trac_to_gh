The following could not be fixed in #715:

```
sage: K = GF(1<<55,'t')
sage: for i in range(50):
....:     a = K.random_element()
....:     E = EllipticCurve(j=a)
....:     b = K.has_coerce_map_from(E)
....:     
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
0
```
The problem is that any parent has a dictionary that stores any coerce map (and a different dictionary for conversion maps) ending at this parent. The keys are given by the domains of the maps. So, in the example above, the field `K` has an attribute that is a dictionary whose keys are the different elliptic curves.

In coercion, it is usually best to compare parents not by equality but by identity. Therefore, I suggest to implement a container called `MonoDict` that works similar to the new weak `TripleDict` (see #715), but takes a single item as a key.

First tests show that one can actually gain a lot of speed: `MonoDict` can access its items much faster than a usual dictionary.

Memory leaks are quite tricky!!

The post here is mainly a memo for myself, documenting what went wrong in the last couple of days.

I tried to directly modify my code from #715. The approach was: `TripleDict` or `MonoDict` should store the data in lists, with some list items being the address of the keys; and in a separate dictionary, a `weakref.KeyedRef` with a callback function is preserved.

And what happened when I replaced `Parent._coerce_from_hash` by a `MonoDict`? A memory leak was *created* by using weak references! Namely,

* There is a strong reference to `weakref.KeyedRef`.
* The `weakref.KeyedRef` has a strong reference to the callback function
* The callback function is an instance of something that I'll call `MonoDictEraser` (similar to  the `TripleDictEraser` from #715)
* The Eraser has a strong reference to the `MonoDict`
* The `MonoDict` has a strong reference to the coerce map.
* The coerce map has a strong reference to domain and codomain
* Hence, domain and codomain can't be collected.

I think the best place to break the reference chain is from the Eraser to the `MonoDict`. Perhaps one could do the same thing at #715, rather than having a weak reference to the underlying set of an action?

Nope! There, the situation was different, since there is strong reference to `TripleDict` anyway (namely in the coercion model), so that a weak reference from the eraser won't suffice.

With the attached patch (to be applied after #715), a new kind of weak dictionary is introduced, and used to cache coercions and conversions. All tests pass for me.

Concerning raw speed: Without the patch, we have

```
sage: RDF.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
Native morphism:
  From: Integer Ring
  To:   Real Double Field
sage: timeit("RDF.coerce_map_from(ZZ)",number=10^5)
100000 loops, best of 3: 518 ns per loop
```
With the patch, it is 466 ns, hence, one gains 10% in an operation that is very frequent.

The total speed seems to be fine as well, `make ptest` has not been slower than before.

Concerning memory leaks:

```
sage: import gc
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: K = GF(1<<55,'t')
sage: for i in range(50):
...     a = K.random_element()
...     E = EllipticCurve(j=a)
...     b = K.has_coerce_map_from(E)
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: len([x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,type(E))])
1
```
That is a new doctest and tests against a memory leak that has not been fixed by #715.

I have extended my patch by another coercion-related application of `MonoDict`.

I found that `sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid` is often resulting in a memory leak. For example, by #715, polynomial rings are only weakly cached. But if the groupoid of a polynomial ring is created, then a *strong* reference on the polynomial ring is created, preventing it from being garbage collected. But a groupoid is created as soon as there is an action of that polynomial ring on another ring. Hence, a memory leak.

The new patch version is overriding the `__classcall__` method of `sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid` (that would normally be inherited from `UniqueRepresentation`) by a method that uses a `MonoDict` for caching. In addition, there is now only a weak reference to the underlying set of a groupoid. By consequence, if there is no other strong reference then `Groupoid(P)` can be garbage collected, but a strong reference to P prevents `Groupoid(P)` from being garbage collected.

Still needs review.

Could you add the second problem fixed into the ticket description ?

Maybe this should be splitted into two tickets to be more readable, or at least two patches.

The title is a little vague as well :)

Sorry for the delay for this and #715 and #11521 but this is now on my top priority (for Sage).

The current behavior with the error raising (if it gets a description of how not to get garbage collected in addition to telling that it got garbage collected) seems viable enough to me (unless that many people do actually use Groupoids and Actions directly).

    "body": "<a id='comment:9'></a>\nPerhaps you are right, and we could re-organise stuff. Namely, for now (that's to say: for #715 and for #12313) we could keep strong references from an action to the underlying set, and from a groupoid to the underlying set. The unfortunate consequence would be that not all memory leaks would be fixed. But one could create a new ticket where the idea of having weak references to the underlying set is tested.\n\nAnd here is yet another idea, at least for the groupoid case. Let S be any object and G its groupoid. Ideally, S should keep G alive and G should keep S alive. Hence, it would be fine to have a strong reference from S to G and from G to S -- Python's garbage collection can deal with circular references.\n\nHowever, there should be no strong references to S or G, unless the user explicitly provides it. In particular, when creating `Groupoid(S)`, there should no external cache be used. \n\nPotential solution: The cache for the `Groupoid.__classcall__` should be in S! Perhaps like this:\n\n```\nclass Groupoid(Category):\n    @staticmethod\n    def __classcall__(cls, S):\n        try:\n            return getattr(S, '_cached_'+cls.__name__)\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass\n        instance = type.__call__(cls, S)\n        assert(isinstance(instance,cls))\n        if instance.__class__.__reduce__ == UniqueRepresentation.__reduce__:\n            instance._reduction = (cls, args, options)\n        try:\n            setattr(S, '_cached_'+cls.__name__, instance)\n            return\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass\n        try:\n            # Parents have a __cached_methods attribute, by #11115\n            S.__cached_methods['_cached_'+cls.__name__] = instance\n            return\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass\n        raise TypeError, \"%s instance must either allow attribute assignment or be instances of %s\"(cls, Parent)\n```\n\nNote that the problem can hardly be solved in the same way for actions. They need to be stored externally, namely in the coercion model.",

Namely, for now (that's to say: for #715 and for #12313) we could keep strong references from an action to the underlying set, and from a groupoid to the underlying set. The unfortunate consequence would be that not all memory leaks would be fixed. But one could create a new ticket where the idea of having weak references to the underlying set is tested.

And here is yet another idea, at least for the groupoid case. Let S be any object and G its groupoid. Ideally, S should keep G alive and G should keep S alive. Hence, it would be fine to have a strong reference from S to G and from G to S -- Python's garbage collection can deal with circular references.

However, there should be no strong references to S or G, unless the user explicitly provides it. In particular, when creating `Groupoid(S)`, there should no external cache be used. 

Potential solution: The cache for the `Groupoid.__classcall__` should be in S! Perhaps like this:

```
class Groupoid(Category):
    @staticmethod
    def __classcall__(cls, S):
        try:
            return getattr(S, '_cached_'+cls.__name__)
        except AttributeError:
            pass
        instance = type.__call__(cls, S)
        assert(isinstance(instance,cls))
        if instance.__class__.__reduce__ == UniqueRepresentation.__reduce__:
            instance._reduction = (cls, args, options)
        try:
            setattr(S, '_cached_'+cls.__name__, instance)
            return
        except AttributeError:
            pass
        try:
            # Parents have a __cached_methods attribute, by #11115
            S.__cached_methods['_cached_'+cls.__name__] = instance
            return
        except AttributeError:
            pass
        raise TypeError, "%s instance must either allow attribute assignment or be instances of %s"(cls, Parent)
```

Note that the problem can hardly be solved in the same way for actions. They need to be stored externally, namely in the coercion model.

I think it is best to follow your suggestion and split stuff.

Soon (perhaps tomorrow) I'll return to the old patch, i.e. without touching the groupoid stuff. In a to-be-created ticket, I'll try the idea for caching groupoids that avoids memory leaks but uses *strong* references, as explained in my previous post.

However, I think the weak references to the underlying set of actions is an integral part of #715 - without it, the memory leak would not be fixed at all; so, I'd not split #715.

Python's name mangling sucks.

Name mangling occurs when an attribute is requested whose name starts with double underscores and does not end with an underscore. Thus, it happens when `S.__cached_method` is requested in the code above.

However, for a reason that I don't understand, Python does not use the name of the class of S for mangling, but the name of cls -- for example, if `S==ZZ` then Python is looking for `S._Groupoid__cached_methods`, not `S._<name of class of S>__cached_methods`. In addition, since `__cached_methods` is a cpdef attribute, it should not be subject to name mangling at all.

I'll see if doing things in Cython helps.

I am not totally sure whether the following problem is caused by this patch or by #715 or #11521. Anyway, with all three patches applied, I obtain:

```
sage: K.<z> = GF(4)
sage: P.<x> = K[]
sage: del P
sage: del x
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
Exception AttributeError: 'PolynomialRing_field_with_category' object has no attribute '_modulus' in  ignored
148
```

As you can observe, some attribute error is ignored, but worse: Cython is unable to tell *where* it is ignored.

The [cython-users](http://groups.google.com/group/cython-users) helped me to track the problem down, using gdb.

The attribute error occurs in the following cdef method defined in sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_zz_pex.pyx:

```
cdef cparent get_cparent(parent) except? NULL:
    if parent is None:
        return NULL
    cdef ntl_ZZ_pEContext_class c
    c = parent._modulus
    return &(c.x)
```

By the way it is defined, the error is propagated. However, get_cparent is in fact called in a deallocation method, namely in sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_template.pxi:

```
    def __dealloc__(self):
        """
        EXAMPLE::

            sage: P.<x> = GF(2)[]
            sage: del x
        """
        celement_destruct(&self.x, get_cparent((<Polynomial_template>self)._parent))
```

That is interesting for two reasons: (1) Cython can not tell the location of the error, which I think is a bug in Cython. (2) The attribute _modulus of `self._parent` is destroyed before self is destroyed.

I find the latter rather strange. As long as self is alive, `self._parent` can not be deallocated, but when `self._parent` can not be deallocated, why is `self._parent._modulus` deleted??

**Attachment:** [trac12313_polynomial_template_dealloc.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12313/trac12313_polynomial_template_dealloc.patch.gz)

I have attached a second patch, that catches the attribute error that may occur during deallocation.

Here is why I think the problem arose in the first place. The error occurs in a `__dealloc__` method of a polynomial. The `__dealloc__` method is, as much as I know, called *after* deletion of the python attributes. In particular, since `self._parent` can be garbage collected with my patches (without #715, #11521 and #12313, it would stay in memory forever), `self._parent._modulus` is deleted before calling the polynomial's `__dealloc__`. Hence, the error.

I guess, the cleanest solution would be to keep a direct pointer to `self._parent._modulus` as an attribute of `self`. But that would create additional memory consumption. And since, by the example below, no memory leak is created with my second patch, I think the solution of simply catching the attribute error is good enough.

With the second patch, the above example works without a warning. Moreover, it seems to come without a speed penalty:

```
sage: K.<z> = GF(4)
sage: def test(K):
....:    for n in xrange(10000):
....:        P.<x> = K[]
....:        del P
....:        del x
sage: %timeit test(K)
5 loops, best of 3: 376 ms per loop
```
with the second patch, but 427 without the second patch.

I also tested whether the second patch introduces a hidden memory leak (after all, when the attribute error occurs for P, the deallocation of x is interrupted): In the above example, `test(K)` does not seem to leak.

```
sage: test(K)
sage: get_memory_usage()
825.640625
sage: test(K)
sage: get_memory_usage()
825.640625
```

Needs review, then!

 In coercion, it is usually best to compare parents not by equality but by identity. Therefore, I suggest to implement a container called `MonoDict` that works similar to the new weak `TripleDict` (see #715), but takes a single item as a key.
 
 First tests show that one can actually gain a lot of speed: `MonoDict` can access its items much faster than a usual dictionary.

... I thought it would be called in each round of the loop.

So, you agree with the statement from my previous post that keeping a reference from the element to the modulus would be the cleanest solution.

Shall I modify sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_template.pxi accordingly?

But there would be a memory penalty (one additional pointer per polynomial) and also a time penalty (the pointer needs to be assigned).

Sure. The main problem for debugging was that Cython was not able to provide the location of the error: Note that it just says "Attribute error in  ignored".

Here comes a first draft of the patch.

It adds a cdef'ed cparent attribute and makes sure it is set to the right value everywhere it should.

Or at least everywhere needed to pass "make ptest" on my computer (once the ticket is rebased on top of 11599).

Some point to clarify :

1. PY_NEW could be replaced by .!__new!__  (possible from Cython >= 0.12)
2. I put (<Polynomial_template>self)._cparent when access to _cparent is needed somehow inspired by how (<Polynomial_template>self)._parent was accessed, but I feel that just self._cparent without casting is enough, isn't it ? If it is the code would be more readable (and scripting the change is trivial.)

And by the way :

In fact there is (at least) a problem left.

After applying the "cparent" patch a 1 becomes a 2 in some output of L.stats() in coerce_dict.pyx.

We have to investigate if this is expected or if I screwed up something.

Strange I've popped and pushed and rebuilt Sage, and now the coerce_dict doctest is not failing anymore...
I'm running a new "make ptest" to be sure something else did not go wrong.

Unfortunately yes.
Anyway, I'm also adding some doc and removing some spaces from the coerce_dict file, but if you wanna have a look at the cparent stuff, please do, at least, just to let me know how you feel about it.
This is not supposed to change that much (unless i remove all the Polynomial_template casts).

By the way, why did you remove the `__len__` and _get_buckets method from the TripleDict class but left them in the MonoDict one ?
I feel `__len__` is not needed (and I am currently rebuilding Sage without it) and as _get_buckets is for debugging...

Anyway, I'll have to go now, so I'm not sure I'll be able to finish it tonight.

Here comes a "reviewer" patch, quickly produced, so potentially full of mistakes.
And it adds Simon's original test for polynomial stuff.

There might still be a problem with L.stats() in coerce_dict.pyx.

I was wrong about the error itself. On my machine (amd64, last (quite old) ubuntu LTS, sage-5.0.beta7, several tickets applied...), I indeed get one error in coerce_dict.pyx when running "make ptest", but not when running only "./sage -t -force_lib -long devel/sage/sage/structure/coerce_dict.pyx" and could reproduce this behavior several times.

The failing doctest is

```
    sage: list(sorted(L.iteritems()))
Expected:
    [(-15, 3), ('a', 1), ('ab', 2)]
Got:
    [('a', 1), ('ab', 2), (-15, 3)]

```
I'm currently building sage-5.0.beta10 on the same computer and a different one to check that it's not only something I messed up with.

I get the same kind of discrepancy on another computer (intel quadcore 2, amd64, debian experimental) on top of sage-5.0.beta10 + #715 + #11521 + this ticket.

In fact, on this other installation, I got the same failing doctest about list items ordering when running "make ptest" (checked three times); and then the "stats()" failure while running "./sage -t .../coerce_dict.pyx" only the first of ten times (and not the other failure so same behavior as on the other computer) and no other error.

So I guess the stats() error can really be ignored, the other one is stranger.
Can someone else confirm this ?

I think the problem is independent from these tickets.

I added these two lines in a clean sage 4.7.2 tree:

and run a `make ptest`. It failed with error:

I think some doctest hidden in some file tested before `coerce_dict.pyx` may be redefining `sorted`. If this bug is confirmed in newer releases, we should make a separate ticket.

This is indeed really strange and I agree that it should be dealt with somewhere else.
I'll post a slightly modified "reviewer" patch taking care of this issue by replacing the (useless) call to list in front by set.

To summarize our investigation of yesterday, we confirmed the bug when running "make ptest" on :
- one computer running either beta10
- two other computers running beta11
- one other computer running beta10 and beta11
All of them are quite or very recent Intel amd64 cpus running more or less recent Debian or Ubuntu OSes.
On all these computers the test passed when running "sage -t devel/sage/sage/structure/coerce_dict.pyx".
I also checked on some of them that running "sage -tp 0 devel/sage/sage" does NOT raise the error, so the culprit is to be found in some magic of the "ptest" target.

Finally I could also NOT reproduce the bug on a last corei7 (Lenovo X220) computer running beta11 (but there I had some doctest failure in fast_digraph.pyx or something like that, not sure of the name).

This is really strange.

I can ensure you that we did ran the tests on at least 4 different computers yesterday on sage-5.0.beta11 + #715 + #11521 + here and got no such failures...
I also observed the same correct behavior on top of beta10 before.
I've also been playing this morning with "make test" and everything was fine on top of sage-5.0.beta11.

Did you tried this on top of a fresh install of sage-5.0.beta10 ?

I have attached a combined patch, that is obtained by folding all patches that have previously to be applied. In particular, it contains the fix "use size_t instead of Py_ssize_t".

For me (64 bit), all tests pass (thus, positive review from me for the parts of code written by Jean-Pierre), but we should wait for Jean-Pierre's results on 32 bit.

For the patchbot:

Apply trac_12313-mono_dict-combined.patch

Mmm, I think the tests I described in #715, in fact included also this ticket.

That is sage-5.0.beta13 + #715 + #11521 + #12313 

The 4 failing doctests did not look obviously related to these ticket.

They might be a consequence of Sage running within a virtual machine (which is quite slow for me).

OK. But I wonder: Is it reliably reproducible on the same machine? Namely, as I said, I have never seen the "2" on my own machine.

What shall we do about that error? After all, it is about how the data are distributed in the hash table, and the hash is clearly machine dependent (since the hash depends on the address of the object). 

Hence, the output of "stat()" is machine dependent. Perhaps we could mark the output "random"?

I also got that one within my virtual machine, but did not worry too much because I cannot even think how this could be related to coercion and caching.
In fact, I think it also happened without #12313 applied, but only #715 and #11521.
I'll check without any of them right now (I should have done this before, but VirtualBox is horribly slow for some reason and it's a pain to rebuild Sage and retest it).

This is a failure that you get if don't build the Sage documentation.  Did you run `make` and let it finish?

I'm now running "make" again to see if anything changes afterward.

Whatsoever, this definitely looks unrelated.

FYI, make failed while building the doc because of lack of memory.
I allocated 1Go to the virtual machine, isn't it enough?
Looking at the memory consumption in top, it goes up to 65% (for the python process alone, not counting other processes) at 98% of the "reading source" stage and fails (on the last test it was at sage/notebook/twist).
Quite strangely, there was still some memory available, about 70 Mo at least, not counting some memory cached, but the system might have refused to allocate some more to the python process.

I think that's the only reason for the above failure on my side, and the other ones I reported here (or in #715) on 32 bits.

I have 512M on my machine, so if the memory is an issue, that would explain it. What seems odd to me is that, as I recall, sage didn't report errors when it finished building. How do I determine whether this is an issue? A naive search of `install.log` doesn't hit anything.

I get some rare doctest failures while testing a very preliminary version of sage-5.1.beta1.  The annoying thing is that the failures aren't reproducible.  The problems seem to be related to coercion.  I'm only guessing this ticket is to blame, it could also be #12877 or some other ticket listed in [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-5.1.beta1/tickets.html](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/release/sage-5.1.beta1/tickets.html)

All the observed failures have been within the `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves` directory.

Often one just gets a segmentation fault:

```
sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py
Segmentation fault

	 [101.7 s]
```

But there are also failures of the form:

```
sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_tate_curve.py

Hi Jean-Pierre and Jeroen!

I am about to go to some conference and will probably not have much time to trace the problem down until Sunday.

Anyway, it would help me if you could state precisely in what setting you find the problem and in what setting you don't. By "precisely", I mean a list of patches, since I can't imagine what you mean by "coercion patches".

Ok, I'll try to be more clear and avoid to replace random zeros by ones in the version number I write.

So far I could reproduce the problem in ell_tate_curve above (after about 10 runs, so quite often) on:
* 5.0.beta13 + #715 + #11521 + #12313 (+ #11943 + #12357 + #12877 but without these three last ones as well).
And could not after 100 runs of ell_tate_curve on:
* 5.1.beta0 vanilla
I'm currently testing 5.1.beta0 + #12313 (after about 40 tries, no errors, which is quite disturbing).

Looking at where the error produced by ell_tate_curve seems to indicate that the problems occurs while multiplying elements of the 5-adic ring and field.

I'm trying to build a simple loop reproducing the error based on that but failed so far.

Another problem is that the bug seems to occur very rarely...

I've not seen it yet on top of 5.1.beta0 + #12313 although I have the feeling it should occur (or I'm wrong :) ).

Even on top of 5.0.beta13 + #715 + #11521 + #12313 it does not happen so frequently when looping over the tests of ell_tate_curve.

I'll run some (I mean a LOT) test without #12313 now, just to be sure this is indeed the culprit.

Mmmm, this seems really tricky.

I've built 5.0.rc0 and applied #715, #11521, #12313, #11943 and #12357 and tried to reproduce the ell_tate_curve error but failed after a few hundreds of tries.

So I decided to pop #12357 and #11943 and tada ! I got the error back in quite quickly.

Of course, this could only be some random lottery...
Or the changes introduced by #11943 could make the error even rarer.

Indeed, I finally produced the error with #11943 applied back after additional tries.

After a few hundreds of tries, I'm still unable to reproduce the error on 5.1.beta0 + #12313 and 5.1.beta0 + #12313 + #12877... but that might happen after more tests.

Some more data...
I've run successfuly ell_tate_curve (i.e. without error) 10000 on 5.0.rc0 plus #715, #11521, #12313, #11943 and #12357 over the night.

I've just retested it without #11943 and #12357 and got the failure after 19 and the 13 tries.

On 5.1.beta0 plus #12313 I got not failure after about 14200 runs of ell_tate_curve.
I'm relaunching it with #12877 applied to see if I get more (un)lucky.

Anyway, I'll use 5.0.rc0 plus #715, #11521, #12313 as a base to try to investigate that.

The problem occurs while multiplying an element of a ring and its field of fractions.
I did not think it through at all, but my natural guess would be that this is done by (canonical?) coercion of the ring element into the field of fractions and then the action takes place there.

That would correspond to the "canonical_coercion" and PyObject_CallObject(...) calls within the bin_op call made by the coercion model, hence no actions involved, but I'm still confused by all of this ;)

I hate these sporadic errors! They are *so* difficult to debug! But if I recall correctly, Nicolas Thiéry posted an example in sage-combinat-devel exposing problems with the weak caching stuff. I hope I will at some point find the time to analyse his example. Right now, I can't.

Any chance that [this error](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/12486#comment:20) is also caused by #12313?

**sage/structure/coerce_dict.pyx**:

line 96:

Perhaps you can explain the mechanism here. If I understand correctly, `_refcache`
is a global dictionary, keyed with the "key" part of `KeyedRef`s and as values
lists of `KeyedRef`s with that key. The deletion consists of looking up the key
in the registered `MonoDict` and removing the entry if it's there (it could
already have disappeared if the entry was explicitly deleted from the
`MonoDict`, because `MonoDict.__delitem__` doesn't bother updating `_refcache`)

It then proceeds to remove the now defunct `KeyedRef` instance from `_refcache`.
But doesn't that mean that even if we have `len(L)==0` as a result from that,
the entry `k : L` remains in `_refcache`? That means we get a whole pile-up of
integers and empty lists in memory as a result (something I have indeed
observed). These objects aren't so big, so this leaks much slower of course,
but it's still a leak. I suspect you copied this from `TripleDict` which will
have the same problem.

line 103:

```
        for i from 0 <= i < PyList_GET_SIZE(bucket) by 4:
            if <size_t><object>PyList_GET_ITEM(bucket,i)==k:
                del bucket[i:i+2] 
```
It reads to me that that should be `... by 2` corresponding tro the loops in
`MonoDict.__setitem__` and `MonoDict.__getitem__`

line 497: (in `Monodict._getitem__`)

How bad is the race condition here? I guess we're trusting that
`bucket` doesn't change and that `bucket` has been purged of any dead references
(i.e., that all `MonoDictEraser` callbacks have happened). Does keeping the GIL
guarantee this?

Does the line

```
                return <object>PyList_GET_ITEM(bucket, i+1) 
```
increase a refcount on the object we retrieve? Does the `<object>` typecast do
that? Or does the `return` do that? (now that the object has been retrieved it
should be protected from deletion)

line 536:

Am I reading correctly that if k cannot be keyreffed then k is going to get a
strong ref in _refcache and will be eternalized? Is that what we want? If so,
write this in a comment! Especially because currently even explicit deletion
would leave the reference in `_refcache` intact, so you'd be leaking in cases
where a normal dictionary would not.

I did explain it on #715, and I changed the patch similar to #715, according to your comments (_refcache is now local, etc).

Right! Thanks for spotting that.

That is a good question. 

I tried to stress test it:

```python
L = MonoDict(31)
class A: pass
while 1:
    keys = [A() for _ in range(100)]
    for i,k in enumerate(keys):
        L[k] = i
    a = keys[99]
    keys = None
    print L[a]
```

I suppose that one could expect that garbage collection would sometimes occur while getting L[a]. Hence, one would expect a segfault to occur at some point. But it works fine (it constantly prints "99").

> Does the line
> 
> ```

> ```
> increase a refcount on the object we retrieve? Does the `<object>` typecast do
> that? Or does the `return` do that?

As much as I know, the `<object>` cast does that. Note that without the cast, the code wouldn't even compile, because "return" can not return the result of `PyList_GET_ITEM` (which is just a reference to an object).

Here is some test that (I think) demonstrates that the reference count is right:

```
sage: cython("""
....: include "../ext/python_list.pxi"
....: def test(list L):
....:     return <object>PyList_GET_ITEM(L,4)
....: """)
sage: import gc
sage: class A(object): pass
....: 
sage: L = [A() for _ in range(100)]
sage: id(L[4])
80680784
sage: a = test(L)
sage: del L
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: [id(x) for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,A)]
[80680784]
sage: id(a)
80680784
sage: del a
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: [id(x) for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x,A)]
[]
```

> line 536:
> 
> Am I reading correctly that if k cannot be keyreffed then k is going to get a

See the comments at #715: That used to be a problem, but is now solved.

Some comments:

* This patch fixes a typo introduced at #715. I suppose that #715, #11521, #12215 and #12313 will be merged in one go anyway, so, that should be fine.
* There was a doctest in sage/categories/modules_with_basis.py that explicitly relied on an "eternal cache". Namely, some module was defined in one doctest and named "X". In *another* doctest, the same module was taken, and it was still called "X", because it has not been garbage collected. With my patch, garbage collection works, and thus the custom name chosen in the first doctest is not present in the second doctest.

Some confusion on my part made me post possibly relevant note on the wrong ticket: [#11521 comment 152](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/11521#comment:152)

Perhaps we should not be caching conversions at all, because they can too easily cause memory leaks, for instance:

```python
for p in prime_range(1,1000):
    k=GF(p)
    a=k(1)
    b=ZZ(a)
```
(the conversion maps get cached on `ZZ`, where the strong references to the domains will keep the finite fields alive)

I'd think conversions are allowed to be expensive.

I think the point of this ticket is exactly to solve the small example you posted (which is nothing but what the ticket description suggests if I'm not getting too tired):
* maps are cached in ZZ in a MonoDict which key is a weakref to k
* k dies, and the MonoDict is smart enough to let garbage collection occurs.

The other way around (maps from ZZ to k, then k dies) should be trivial as well.

Is that right?

> I think the point of this ticket is exactly to solve the small example you posted (which is nothing but what the ticket description suggests if I'm not getting too tired):

Yes, but the map stores a refcounted ref to k so the presence of the map on ZZ prevents k from being collected.

We still get the benefit on this patch that the *absence* of a map (which is the case with `GF(p)` to `ZZ`) gets cached by `None` so in that case only the weakref to k exists on `ZZ` and `k` can be collected.

> * k dies, and the MonoDict is smart enough to let garbage collection occurs.

Only if the stored value doesn't strongly reference `k`.

> The other way around (maps from ZZ to k, then k dies) should be trivial as well.

Not "should be trivial as well" but "is already trivial thanks to cyclic garbage removal". The map is cached on `k` and not on `ZZ`. The map references `k`, but if all other references to `k` disappear we just have a cyclic reference, which python's GC should be able to figure out. 

So: YES, this ticket is an improvement over what we had before (and once all issues are worked out should be merged) but it doesn't offer a complete solution to leaking due to caching yet:

```python
for p in prime_range(1,1000):
    _=SR.coerce_map_from(GF(p))
```
will still leak like a disgruntled intelligence chief.

Conversion is a bit worse because conversion maps exist more often, but is also slightly better because the system won't ask for them by itself and won't investigate the transitive closure of the conversion graph. Therefore, I'm not sure conversion should be given the same caching treatment as coercion. The proposed patch is propagating such a caching treatment (but didn't introduce it).

Both these work fine for me on a pristine 5.3b2 with the patches for this ticket applied:

```
	sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage-12313/sage/rings/padics/padic_base_leaves.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage-12313/sage/rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_element.py # Killed/crashed
```
See also #13370, where Simon can reproduce the padic_base_leaves failure.

I tried the following code to try and recreate the circumstances Simon finds there, but no problem occurs (it does usually succeed fairly quickly in finding R with the same id as the K before)

```
import gc
while True:
  k=Qp(7)
  L=[c^2 for c in range(2^randint(1,15))] #to stir up memory use
  print id(k)
  K=Qp(7,40)
  iK = id(K)
  assert k.has_coerce_map_from(K) is False
  del K
  gc.collect()
  R=Zp(7,40)
  iR = id(R)
  if iR == iK:
      break
  del k,R
  gc.collect()
  
assert k.has_coerce_map_from(R)
```

Here is another evidence that <object> does what we need:

```
sage: cython("""
....: def test(size_t k):
....:     K = <object><void *>k
....:     print K
....:     del K
....: """)
sage: class A(object): pass
....: 
sage: a = A()
sage: test(id(a))
<__main__.A object at 0x44a17d0>
sage: a
<__main__.A object at 0x44a17d0>
sage: del a
sage: import gc
sage: _ = gc.collect()
sage: quit
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.16s, Wall time 0m39.96s).
```
If the reference count of the A-instance would not be increase by the <object> cast in the test function, I guess a segfault would result, wouldn't it?

Wouldn't it be easier to directly look at the Cython code for the <object> refcount?

As far as testing is concerned, I'll setup up Sage installs during the week and report here and on the other tickets.
Hopefully, this should be done by the beginning of next week.

Seems so.

Unfortunately, parents P do have very bad hash values. Namely, the default for hash(P) is hash(repr(P)). This value is not cached, and repr(P) may be slow. Even worse, repr(P) may change, because there is a P.rename() method. There is some ticket for fixing that apparent problem.

Anyway, at this point it would make sense to compare usual `WeakKeyDictionary` and `MonoDict` timing-wise. That should be done using unique parents (there, the hash and also the comparison *is* fast).

For the Sage library, you can find the C[++] generated files in devel/sage...
For files generated on the file, you have to look in .sage/temp/... or something like this, involving the PID of the process.

Anyway, I had a look at the parent.c file produced from parent.p?? on a vanilla from coercion 5.3.beta2 and on the lines corresponding to a `return <object> PY_TYPE(x)`
there indeed seems to be a _ _Pyx_INCREF called on the address of the returned value.

That way `MonoDict` and `TripleDict` should still be a bit faster than normal `dicts` (because key comparison is trivial).

I think that would not work, for two reasons:

1. You seem to assume that all keys of `MonoDict` allow weak references. Is that granted? I am not sure. Perhaps this is a non-issue.
2. In a very early stage of my work, I *did* put the weak references into the buckets. However, my impression was that that would create a massive slow-down, as I explain now.

With the current patch, the buckets are of the form `[h1,v1,h2,v2,h3,v3,...]`, where h1,h2,h3 are the memory addresses of the keys, and v1,v2,v3 are the values. Now assume that we would put the (weak) references r1,r2,r3 to the keys into the bucket: `[r1,v1,r2,v2,r3,v3,...]`.

The weak references should have a callback function removing entries from the dictionary. Hence, they are not just `weakref.ref`, but `weakref.KeyedRef`.

Let K be some weak-reffable key and f be some callback function. While `weakref.ref(K) is weakref.ref(K)`, we unfortunately have `weakref.KeyedRef(K,f,id(K)) is not weakref.KeyedRef(K,f,id(K))`.

We want to compare K by identity. Hence, either do `if r1() is K` or `if r1.key == <size_t><void *>K and r1() is not None`. Both tests are slow (r1.key is a Python attribute lookup). Even worse: They are slow, regardless whether K is in the dictionary or not.

Here are some timings. They are quite conclusive: `MonoDict` is very fast, even in the "validate weak references before giving an answer" version!

First, something that is quite realistic. We have many polynomial rings over different finite base fields - something that often occurs in elliptic curve computations. Then, we create a `WeakKeyDictionary` and a `MonoDict` keyed with these polynomial rings, and then test containment with a ring that is in the dictionary and one that isn't:

```
sage: L = []
sage: for p in prime_range(10000):
....:     L.append(GF(p)['x','y'])
....: 
sage: import weakref
sage: from sage.structure.coerce_dict import MonoDict
sage: M = MonoDict(53)
sage: for i,K in enumerate(L):
....:     M[K] = i
....: 
sage: W = weakref.WeakKeyDictionary()
sage: for i,K in enumerate(L):
....:     W[K] = i
....: 
sage: K = GF(97)['x','y']
sage: K2 = GF(next_prime(p))['x','y']
sage: K in W
True
sage: K in M
True
sage: K2 in W
False
sage: K2 in M
False
sage: %timeit K in W
625 loops, best of 3: 55.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit K in M
625 loops, best of 3: 533 ns per loop
sage: %timeit K2 in W
625 loops, best of 3: 2.41 µs per loop
sage: %timeit K2 in M
625 loops, best of 3: 1.56 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = W[K]
625 loops, best of 3: 54.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit a = M[K]
625 loops, best of 3: 1.08 µs per loop
```
Hence, in this realistic example, `MonoDict` is a lot faster than `WeakKeyDictionary` -- even though I am talking about the recent version of `MonoDict` where the weak references are validated.

The polynomial rings have a decently fast hash, but comparison is slow:

```
sage: %timeit hash(K)
625 loops, best of 3: 649 ns per loop
sage: %timeit hash(K2)
625 loops, best of 3: 678 ns per loop
sage: %timeit K == K
625 loops, best of 3: 53.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit K == K2
625 loops, best of 3: 65.7 µs per loop
```

So, let us see what happens if we do "the same" with `UniqueRepresentation`:

```
sage: class A(UniqueRepresentation):
....:     def __init__(self,p):
....:         self.p = p
....:         
sage: L = []
sage: for p in prime_range(10000):
....:     L.append(A(p))
....:     
sage: K = A(97)
sage: K2 = A(next_prime(p))
sage: import weakref
sage: W = weakref.WeakKeyDictionary()
sage: from sage.structure.coerce_dict import MonoDict
sage: M = MonoDict(53)
sage: for i,K in enumerate(L):

Hence, comparison is now a lot faster, and this is noticeable in `WeakKeyDictionary`.

However: `MonoDict` still outperforms `WeakKeyDictionary`. I am slightly surprised - I didn't expect this would happen, after introducing the validation of weak references. Note that testing `K in M` is even faster than a single comparison `K==K`!

That's not what I meant.  You make the buckets larger, so that their layout becomes:

```
[h1,r1,v1,h2,r2,v2,h3,r3,v3,...]
```
where for, say, the key-value pair `k1: v1` we have 

```
h1=id(k1)
r1=weakref.KeyedRef(k1,f,h1)
```
This way you can do your whole lookup without doing an extra search in the now non-existent `_refcache`.

```
for i from 0 <= i < PyList_GET_SIZE(bucket) by 3: 
    tmp = <object>PyList_GET_ITEM(bucket, i) 
    if <size_t>tmp == h:
        r = <object>PyList_GET_ITEM(bucket, i+1)
        if isinstance(r, KeyedRef) and r() is None:
            # the object got collected but we didn't receive a callback (yet?)
            # either remove it now:
            del r #we dont WANT the callback anymore!
            del bucket[i:i+3]
            self._size -= 1
            # or skip that step and hope we'll get our callback later. In any case:
 	        raise KeyError, k
        else:
            # We've just checked that r's ref (the actual key) was still alive
            # so the fact that id(k) equals tmp means that
            # k is r() [or k is r if not weakreffable, but that would have been true anyway]
 	        return <object>PyList_GET_ITEM(bucket, i+2)
raise KeyError, k 
```        

Deletion and setting are easily similarly modified.

This should be a bit faster because you avoid an extra `self._refcache[h]` lookup and all the management that comes with maintaining an
independent hashtable that has exactly the same keys!

It is also more memory efficient because you're now storing h only once instead of twice.

For `TripleDict` you can do it in exactly the same way, just a little more work.

Since you already have code, it should be relatively easy to test the performance.

I wouldn't say that it is obviously faster. Let's simply test it, I'd say!

Not that much. Actually, I wonder whether one could have a `TupleDict`, that is created with an additional parameter that prescribes the length L of the key items. Then, the data in each bucket would be stored by L references (weak, if possible), L memory locations, and one value. The look-up would be uniform.

I think one should create a proof of concept, to test the performance. If the performance is as good as with the current `MonoDict` and `TripleDict`, then we have to think how to organise work. Perhaps #715 and #12313 will be superseded by a new ticket, introducing `TupleDict`?

OK! example implementation done. A couple of things I found:

- Some of your doctests for `MonoDict` test `TripleDict`!

- your iterators can recurse quite deeply if there are lots of empty buckets in
 a row. That can easily happen.

- Casting to `<object>` in Cython indeed gives you a kind of `<PyObject *>`
 where Cython takes care of intelligent casting and refcounting for you. That
 comes at some cost. Especially for `tmp` I think we can largely do away with
 that for a little gain in speed. This might apply more widely.
 
- It's a shame we can't store our `h` values immediately in the list but that
 we have to store them in an integer, which means we're storing a pointer to
 that integer in the list. If our buckets would be arrays of longs we could save
 one level of indirection for the storage of the `h` values, at the expense of
 having to do manual ref counting on the other parts, as opposed to letting
 Cython take care of it. A point to keep in mind if
 we need that last nanosecond ... (it's tempting to simply cast the value of h
 to a `PyObject*` and store that directly in the bucket but that would wreak
 havoc with the cyclic garbage collector. We could mangle the value (add one?
 all pointer values are divisible by 4 nowadays) but I think that would lead us
 to stepping outside Python's defined C-API. [if they ever get more lispy,
 they'll start using those bottom bits for type info or so]

- What happens if we find a dead entry in setitem? How can we be sure the
 pending callback for that doesn't happen on our new value? I think explicitly
 deleting the weakref should do the trick, but then we should ensure that nobody
 else gets a chance to keep those weakrefs alive! I've gone with that for now.
 An alternative is to let the callback check that the weakref stored in the

If you do these tests repeatedly there is quite some noise, but these represent
what generally seems to happen. Oddly enough, retrieving an item is often a
little faster than getting `True` back on `K in N`! Must be something subtle or
overhead. Deciding that `K in M` is the only thing where the old `MonoDict` is
slightly faster. That is not the case we're interested in optimizing, though;
Lookup is! And `MonoDictNoRefCache` is the clear winner there (as it is for
deciding that a key is NOT in there. Also a good operation to have).
Furthermore, note that `MonoDictNoRefCache` is a little more thorough in its
membership test by also checking that the weakref is still alive.

That's why `MonoDict` won for membership. It was using a properly calibrated `dict` versus a linear search in `MonoDictNoRefCache`. I think our design is clear now.

Concerning `TupleDict`: Sure we can implement it but if our only use cases are `MonoDict` and `TripleDict` anyway, we're better off with the unrolled loops.

Somewhere in the next few days I'll prepare a patch for #715 to move `TripleDict` to this design and then put a patch on #12313 for `MonoDict`, if that's OK with people. In the mean time, comments on design welcome.

I wrote some general code for what I now call `IdKeyDict`: A weak key dictionary (that also accepts items that aren't weak-reffable) with keys of prescribed length, keys being compared by identity. There, the tmp is not used.

I don't understand that comment.

My new code takes care of that. The methods are a lot more modularised. There is one method that simply finds the correct bucket (according to the hash) and another method that finds the position of an item on that bucket. The second method will automatically delete a dead item from the bucket. And of course, that method is both used in `__setitem__`, `__getitem__` and `__contains__`.

What would be the problem if the weakrefs survive? OK, at some point the callback will start working, but would that be a problem? I mean, if the callback tries to remove an item that has already been deleted, then the callback would simply do nothing

Good point! By your comment, I have now threshold=0.7 as default in my experimental code.

Yes, that would explain it.

Last night I already wrote experimental code (calling the thing "`IdKeyDict`", because the keys are compared by identity). I am now doing some tests - perhaps we are lucky and it is fast...

`MonoDict` and `TripleDict` are the only use cases *yet*. Until not so long time ago, `TripleDict` has been the only use case. One could imagine that an `IdKeyDict` being useful for a weak_cached_function, as in #12215: If you have a function with a fixed list of arguments (hence, no *args and !**keys), and if you are happy to compare the arguments by identity, `IdKeyDict` may be exactly the thing you want.

Plus, one avoids code duplication. And aren't modern compilers intelligent enough to do some loop unrolling automatically?

Anyway, since I already wrote code, I'll first test the performance, rather than immediately dropping the idea of unifying `MonoDict` and `TripleDict`.

Not if there's now a new entry stored under that id. The trick is, `id(object)` is guaranteed to uniquely identify `object` for its lifetime but, as you've seen, not beyond it.

By the way, as long as we ensure that absolutely no-one else keeps a reference to our weakrefs, then deleting them should make them disappear immediately, making it impossible to pass them as a parameter to a callback ... I hope that python uses that to purge its callback queue after a cyclic garbage collection.

See #13387 for a modification of `MonoDict` and `TripleDict` to not use a refcache. It's also a little more careful in handling dangling weakrefs (I think).

Hashtables should not have a particularly small number of buckets! About 1.5 times the number of elements! (the birthday paradox still means quite some collisions). And we since we don't ever resize down, the load could drop quite low! (although not particularly in our main applications).

If you have a preprocessor, macro, or templating system then the `N` in `N-Dict` can indeed be resolved at compile-time and then the compiler can unroll. But I don't think Cython has parametric code generation (yet?)

sage: %timeit I[K,K,True]
625 loops, best of 3: 1.24 µs per loop
sage: %timeit T[K,K,True]
625 loops, best of 3: 2.19 µs per loop
sage: %timeit W[K]
625 loops, best of 3: 55.6 µs per loop
```

Hence, the *general* `IdKeyDict`, that implements any fixed key length, already beats `TripleDict`. But not all is good: When I tried to compare with `MonoDict`, I got a segfault in `__setitem__`

Back to the drawing board, then...

OK, patch is updated.

Here are timings for key length 1:

```

....:

sage: K2 = GF(next_prime(p))['x','y']
sage: for i,K in enumerate(L):

```
and concerning garbage collection

```
sage: del L

```

Hence, the timings of the general implementation (general key length) are competitive. What do you think about it? Of course, one would need to add doctests.

OK, perhaps a little cryptic indeed. What I meant was that for a monodict the bucket entries are really of the form

```
( key_id, ref, value )
```
which one could store as

```
(<size_t>, <PyObject*>, <PyObject*>)
```
but we're storing it as (Lists accept nothing else)

```
(<PyObject*>, <PyObject*>, <PyObject*>)
```
which means that the first entry gets stored by a pointer to a system-word-sized allocated entry (a PyInt to be precise) instead of stored directly in the field that would be big enough anyway. That's wasting memory locality and hence CPU cache space on the bit we use the most. (weakref and the values obviously have to be pointers).

If someone is really interested in tracking down where the speed regression is coming from, they could sprinkle parents with an "elixir of life". I think it would be enough to patch `UniqueRepresentation` with a global list to which any newly created structure gets appended. That should bless all parents with eternal life and hence make all our weak caching permanent once again.

Code that significantly benefits from this elixir should be marked for restructuring. It should keep better track of what parents it reuses. It's unrealistic to expect that the system is clairvoyant in this matter.

As far as I'm concerned it not significant at all in comparaison with the memleaks it prevents.

Without the patches, I'd have to restart Sage every couple of hours because of lack of memory.

With the patches, I'll just have to wait a couple of extra minutes more.

Why don't you move `IdKeyDict` there? If you can get it to perform sufficiently well, we could drop it in. Having the code a little more structured would be a benefit from a maintenance point of view.

I see these alternative approaches:

1. We essentially keep the code from #715 and the main patch from here, for now. However, we need to do some fixes, because of the segfaults and stuff. But apart from that fix, #13387 should focus on performance and perhaps generality `IdKeyDict`. #12313 will be a dependency for #13387.

To decide which way to go, we should probably ask: How much additional work is needed to fix the current segfault problems with #715 and #12313? If it isn't much, then the first way may be better. Otherwise, we may choose the second way.

As much as I see, what needs to be fixed (or just needs to be reviewed, because it already is in the patches): After testing equality of memory addresses, test whether the weak reference is still valid. If it isn't then delete the weak reference, in order to avoid its callback being active.

So, 1. or 2., or a third way?

I've seen complete doctest successes for #715 + #11521 + #12313, but the last thing I saw, some bots were persistent about error that they didn't report for other patches, which makes me think they may be real issues that are hard to trigger. The problems I currently see:

#715,#11521:

- `TripleDict` set method is not dangling callback safe

- `TripleDict` `__delitem__` method doesn't raise an error when deleting a dead entry (don't think that's much of an issue and arguable whether it should do that anyway. In fact, with `TripleDictEraser` using it, it can't)

- `TripleDictIter` isn't safe wrt to dangling weakrefs. That one's a real segfault waiting to happen, because it instantiates object references by pointer cast!

- `TripleDictEraser` hold a strong reference to the TripleDict. I suspect that should be weak, although that adds to deletion costs...

- You're importing `ConstantFunction` but you don't use it.

If you have a reliable way of generating the segfaults, it might be worth trying with #13387. The iterator there should be safe. There might be other issues, though.

I have a preference to getting  #715 + #11521 in mergeable state, because I think that enhances our chances of actually making progress (in terms of getting stuff merged). Making #13387 one huge patch bomb is probably hard to review. This code really needs to be read for review.

#12215: Bot is reporting a SIGABRT somewhere, which is probably an "assert" failing in C code. Smells like memory corruption, so it would be really useful to get a report on. Code in the patches is really simple, so I'm suspecting a nasty interaction with #715,#11521 that now gets triggered because now things are actually getting collected.

#12313: Bot reports a SIGSEGV somewhere, Same story as above.

#13370: Bot reports a SIGSEGV

Most likely explanation is that our MonoDict and TripleDict implementations corrupt memory in rare cases and that the other tickets trigger that by changing other things so that they get exercised more.

Can we get access to the bot or equivalent configuration to recreate the circumstances? Or can we get someone involved who can (one is called volker-desktop ...).

Hence, if you have a working iterator at #13387 then we should use that. Note that [attachment:idkey_dict](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12313/idkey_dict) has a different iterator, thanks to Cython now supporting "yield". Do you think that iterator is safe?

I'll meet Volker in St Andrews next week, if I'm not mistaken.

In the next few days, my resources for working will be a bit limited, but I'll try to get my patches from #715 and here in a better state, according to your remarks.

I concur. Even more, I think fixing a memory leak is much more important than efficiency, thus it
is not fair to compare both timings.

> Why? References to `TripleDictEraser` come from the `TripleDict` it points to, and from the weak references that are stored in said `TripleDict`. Would this be more than having a reference cycle that only involves `KeyedRef`, `TripleDict` and `TripleDictEraser`? None of them has a `__del__` method, isn't it?

Hm ... For MonoDictEraser you used a weakref. That's mainly what led me to believe it's better. I don't know what's more costly. Weakrefs make individual deletions more expensive because of the callbacks. Cyclic garbage buildup adds cost in that the GC is triggered more frequently. It depends a bit on the connectivity of the graph if it's worthwhile introducing enough weakrefs to break cycles.
The following check suggests that weakrefs can sometimes be cheaper:

```
sage: class refstore(object):
....:         def __init__(self,ref):
....:             self.ref=ref
....:     
sage: class cyclic(object):
....:         def __init__(self):
....:             self.me=refstore(self)
....: 
sage: N=0
sage: def callback(c):
....:         global N
....:     N+=1
....: 
sage: import weakref
sage: 
sage: class weakcyc(object):
....:       def __init__(self):
....:         self.me=refstore(weakref.ref(self,callback))
....: 
sage: #import gc
sage: #gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_STATS)
sage: %time for i in range(80000): c = cyclic()
CPU times: user 0.33 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.35 s
Wall time: 0.36 s
sage: %time for i in range(80000): c = weakcyc()
CPU times: user 0.20 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.20 s
Wall time: 0.21 s
sage: %time for i in range(80000): c = cyclic()
CPU times: user 0.39 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.39 s
Wall time: 0.40 s
sage: %time for i in range(80000): c = weakcyc()
CPU times: user 0.20 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.20 s
Wall time: 0.21 s
sage: %time for i in range(80000): c = cyclic()
CPU times: user 0.33 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.33 s

CPU times: user 0.20 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.20 s

```
(it's fun to turn on gc stats and see that the weakrefs trigger no GC!)

Yes, while working at rebasing my patch, I just noticed.

Not sure. Since I already have updated my patch at #715 without weak reference (for `TripleDict`), I keep it like this *there*. But now I am rebasing my patch from here, and I think I will change it into a weak reference *here* (in both cases).

Yesyes, there are no garbage keys with my new patch at #715.

I had to update the patch again. It is now almost fine.

Only remaining problem (on my machine, that is):

```
sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/combinat/integer_vectors_mod_permgroup.py
```
results in about 20 open processes that never finish. Timeout.

Running the test --verbose, one finds that all tests pass. But then, it is

```
271 tests in 40 items.
271 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.
A workspace appears to have been corrupted... automatically rebuilding (this is harmless).
```
Harmless - but timeout.

Since the problem appears *after* running the tests, it seems to come from the doctest framework. Any idea what happens?

I let the `Gap._start` method print a stack when there is a problem that leads to the "this is harmless" message.

After finishing the tests, there is a `RuntimeError` "Unable to start gap", and the stack is

So, apparently one has to look at the `__cmp__` method in permgroup.py and make sure that it works when gap can not start.

The odd thing is: `sage.interfaces.expect.Expect._start` has the arguments "alt_message" and "block_during_init". While the latter is used, the first argument does not occur in the method!

This is in the removal callback of a `WeakValueDictionary`. So, what I *think* is
happening is that an object that is dependent on Gap for its equality test is
used in a cache somewhere.

Probably during shutting down, the value gets deleted and the dictionary gets
its callback to remove the value. However, this is during shutdown! Things are
in funny states. Probably, the deletion from the dictionary doesn't really
matter anyway, because that's probably next in line to be destroyed.

However, the callback doesn't know that!

This is a nasty complication of these weakreffed dictionaries: the callback code
can run under funny conditions and an equality test can involve a lot in some
sage objects.

If we could tell our `WeakValueDictionaries` something about their codomain
their callback could check if that still exists. If not then none of the entries
matter, so you don't have to bother to locate the appropriate key. Just delete
them all.

**EDIT**: I guess a solution here could be to store a strong ref to the gap interface on the object that needs gap comparison. That way, gap will surely still exist (and useable?) whenever such an object is alive. The possibilities of callbacks on objects mean you have to be more explicit about what they need to function! Nasty ...

Unfortunately, these aren't *our* `WeakValueDictionaries`, but Python's. So, we can not.

> **EDIT**: I guess a solution here could be to store a strong ref to the gap interface on the object that needs gap comparison.

Sounds like a good idea.

Another one or two ideas:

1. We find out where that weak dictionary lives, and delete the whole dictionary *explicitly* when Sage shuts down.
2. We find out where that weak dictionary lives, and if we are lucky then we can replace it by a `MonoDict` or `TripleDict`.

It turns out that the problematic dictionary is `UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__.cache`, which is a weak dictionary by #12215, and which can not be turned into a `MonoDict` or `TripleDict`.

Is it an option to delete it explicitly when Sage starts to shut down?

There is a function `quit_sage` in sage.all. The first thing it does is to quit all sage interfaces.

If one prepends it with a garbage collection, then the problem vanishes. It would not help to move quitting the interfaces to the very end of quit_sage().

So, question: Is an explicit garbage collection an option?

Really, it's a bit silly that `WeakValueDictionary` does a lookup by key on its removal callback. 

An alternative, better, but more laborious solution is to improve `WeakValueDictionary`. What we need is a dictionary with an extra method:

```
    def delete_by_hash_and_value_id(self,hash,id):
        find bucket based on hash
        find entry by walking the bucket to find the given *value* id.
        delete that entry
```
Then your `WeakValueDictionary` can inherit from it and do:

```
    def __setitem__(self,key,value):
        r=KeyedRef(value,(h,id(value)),
            lambda ref: self.delete_by_hash_and_value_id(ref.key[0],ref.key[1])
        super(self).__setitem__(key,r)
```
The most attractive approach would be to subclass dict, but getting access to its internal storage to do this modified search would be painful.

Funny that you name pbori.pyx! Meanwhile the doctests are finished, and I got the error exactly there! And it is reproducible. Namely:

```
sage -t --verbose -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx"
2342 tests in 280 items.
2342 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.
*** glibc detected *** python: double free or corruption (!prev): 0x0000000007367de0 ***
```
and then htop shows me processes like

```
python /mnt/local/king/.sage/tmp/pbori_22813.py
python /mnt/local/king/.sage/tmp/mpc622-24779/pbori_9077.py
```
that are running at 0% CPU. Timeout, and again the error occurs when shutting down Sage.

But that's good, because it is reproducible! And if pbori.pyx uses a weak dictionary (I hope it wasn't I who introduced it...), it absolutely makes sense to see an error there.

I ran a hypersearch, and don't see anywhere else that it appears, either. Have you tried deleting that line?

It looks like that garbage collection is a great idea! The error is now completely reproducible:

```
	sage -t --verbose -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx" # Killed/crashed
```
I've instrumented the remove function on the `WeakValueDictionary` a little bit:

```diff
        def remove(wr, selfref=ref(self)):
            self = selfref()
            if self is not None:
+                if type(wr.key) is tuple:
+                    T=[]
+                    for t in wr.key:
+                        try:
+                            T.append(str(t))
+                        except:
+                            T.append("TYPE: %s"%type(t))
+                    print('removal on key %s'%T)
                del self.data[wr.key]
        self._remove = remove
        UserDict.UserDict.__init__(self, *args, **kw)
```
to find (now doctests are failing due to the extra output):

```
...

removal on key ['Rational Field', "('z', 'y')", '2', 'False', 'Degree reverse lexicographic term order']

Thank you for looking into the problem. I found that the problem seems to be related with the doctest framework, too.

Namely, put the following into a file "test.py":

```
"""
            sage: B.<a,b,c,d,e,f> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
            sage: I = ideal(a*b + a + b*e + c*e + 1, a + b + c*d + c + 1, a*c + c + d*f + d + 1, a*c + c*f + c + d*f + 1, c*f + c + d + e + 1, a + b*c + b*d + e*f + 1)
            sage: I.groebner_basis()
            [1]
"""
```
Then, run sage -t on it. You will find the "glibc detected"

You may also try to run the same example interactively in Sage, and quit. Everything is fine (or at least, it was for me).

Right! Could be a `BooleanPolynomialRing`, though.

Indeed, sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_ring_constructor contains

```
import weakref
_cache = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()

```

So, there is only a Homset (for which there is a weak cache, by #11521) being collected during the tests, and perhaps it hasn't been the weak dictionary of polynomial rings, after all.

How can one find out what kind of thing got freed twice? I am afraid gdb does not seem to work on doc tests, and I can not reproduce the problem interactively.

Would it help to explicitly delete (or explicitly clear) the "bad" weak dictionaries?

If it does, one could proceed as follows:

* Introduce a function that returns (usual) weak key dictionaries, and stores a (weak?) reference to all the weak key dictionaries it creates.
* In quit_sage, explicitly delete (or clear) all the weak key dictionaries in store.

Your suggestion to create a new a safe weak key dictionary sounds like much work to me...

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:9'></a>\nYes that might work as a workaround for now. The store indeed needs to be weak. It could itself be a `WeakValueDictionary`, keyed on the id of the `WeakValueDictionaries` it stores. You'd like to put them in a `WeakSet`, but they're not hashable.\n\nIf we're unlucky you'll get into an infinite loop, though. It's not impossible that sage, upon equality testing, decides to construct some new parents to coerce things into in order to compare them. These parents would then get created and entered into caches that we might just have cleared! If the process involves creating a new category, a dynamic class might even end up producing a new `UniqueRepresentation` and enter a new cache into our \"to clear\" dictionary. Dictionaries behave very badly when they are modified while being iterated over.\n\nSo: Worth a try for now. Let's do that to get this ticket out the door.\n\n---\n**Future Work**\n\nI foresee crazy bugs in the future. A `WeakValueDict` with safe removal is probably ultimately unavoidable. And is the work really so bad?\n\nWe could just go with roughly the design for `IdKeyDict`, but then using Python's hash function and simpler entries.

Yes that might work as a workaround for now. The store indeed needs to be weak. It could itself be a `WeakValueDictionary`, keyed on the id of the `WeakValueDictionaries` it stores. You'd like to put them in a `WeakSet`, but they're not hashable.

If we're unlucky you'll get into an infinite loop, though. It's not impossible that sage, upon equality testing, decides to construct some new parents to coerce things into in order to compare them. These parents would then get created and entered into caches that we might just have cleared! If the process involves creating a new category, a dynamic class might even end up producing a new `UniqueRepresentation` and enter a new cache into our "to clear" dictionary. Dictionaries behave very badly when they are modified while being iterated over.

So: Worth a try for now. Let's do that to get this ticket out the door.

---
**Future Work**

I foresee crazy bugs in the future. A `WeakValueDict` with safe removal is probably ultimately unavoidable. And is the work really so bad?

We could just go with roughly the design for `IdKeyDict`, but then using Python's hash function and simpler entries. Normal lookup and delete would be via hash and then equality on the keys. Special deletion would be by hash and id of the value. Once we have a working prototype we can put it out there for the Python community. With any luck someone adopts it and improves, tunes and optimizes it. I don't think our applications are so super time critical. It's all for creation of parents, which is expensive anyway.

Our applications only need a rudimentary `Dictionary` interface, but adding the other methods would not be a huge job.

See #13394

Now that's funny. I tried to keep the store of any `KeyedReference`. But it turns out that there is always *exactly one* dead `KeyedReference` that raises an attribute error when trying to get the key. Namely, I inserted the following at the beginning of sage.all.quit_sage:

```python
    import gc, weakref
    KeepRefKeys = []
    for r in gc.get_objects():
        if isinstance(r, weakref.KeyedRef):
            try:
                KeepRefKeys.append(r.key)
            except AttributeError:
                print "Warning, no key for",r
    del r
    print "all keys are in store"
    gc.collect()
    print "collection done"
```

Then, quitting a normal Sage session, I get

```
sage: quit

and executing the "bad" three-line doctest, I get

I got a similar problem in #12173.
FLINT wants to free the memory it uses upon quitting, but Sage/Python tries to do the same upon deletion of Sage objects.
The solution we adopted was to let the FLINT memory (not all of it  fortunately) in place, although that would to memory leaks if one would load and quit Sage several times from one Python interpreter.
We never figured out how in which order things were deallocated when Python was shutdown.

And GDB just hanged the same on the double free errors.

On your example, quite strangely, I get a nice segfault and backtrace as Nils.

Anyway, it could be possible that the situation is as in FLINT: some Sage method tries to directly deallocate something after we called the Polybori cleanup method which already freed taht piece of memory and it crashes.

> Anyway, it could be possible that the situation is as in FLINT: some Sage method tries to directly deallocate something after we called the Polybori cleanup method which already freed taht piece of memory and it crashes.

That sounds like the solution should be as in the [segfault fix](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12215/trac12215_segfault_fixes.patch.gz) for pari at #12215.

Generally, underlying C-data should be freed by using a method `__dealloc__` (not `__del__`, please!). You need to be careful, because during `__dealloc__` you can *not* assume that the Python attributes of an instance are still working.

Hence, it is (in my opinion) very wrong that we had

```
    import sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense
    sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense.free_m4ri()

    import sage.libs.flint.flint
    sage.libs.flint.flint.free_flint_stack()

    pari._unsafe_deallocate_pari_stack()
```
in sage.all.quit_sage (I only removed the pari._unsafe_deallocate... in #12215).

Why does it not work for me? Does one need to do anything special to make it work with Sage?

> and, indeed, the backtrace shows this is indeed `gcmodule` leading to `Delete<polybori::groebner::ReductionStrategy>` leading to an error raise in `libc`.

OK, then we have to see at what point the reduction strategies are supposed to be deallocated.

I can not work on it right now. But thank you for the pointer!

Here is some hyptothesis about what goes wrong:
* the deallocator for ReductionStrategy gets called before the GroebnerStrategy one.
* then GroebnerStrategy deallocator calls the C++ destructor of self._strat which in turn calls the one for ReductionStrategy.
* bang.

> I'm not yet convinced the explanation is as what I posted above, but here is a patch which seems logical to me, and prevents the polybori segfaults.

I agree with your assessment as well. As far as I can see:

`GroebnerStrategy.__init__`:
- Creates a new `ReductionStrategy` wrapper and stores it in `self.reduction_strategy`
- Asks polybori to delete the `self.reduction_strategy._strat` attribute on it
- Then fills that slot with `&self._strat.generators`
So `GroebnerStrategy.reduction_strategy._strat` is now definitely a borrowed reference from `ReductionStrategy`. However, `GroebnerStrategy` has a reference to the latter, so it's borrowing from something it keeps alive.

`GroebnerStrategy.__dealloc__`:
- zeros out `self.reduction_strategy._strat = NULL`
- calls `del self._strat`, which I assume amounts to asking polybori to delete it as well.

This strategy works if `GroebnerStrategy.__dealloc__` would get called before `ReductionStrategy.__dealloc`, but as we know python attributes might already no longer exist at `__dealloc__` time, so we're not guaranteed a call order.

So I think the code here should be

```
    if self.reduction_strategy != NULL and self.reduction_strategy._strat != NULL:
        self.reduction_strategy._strat = NULL
        if self._count.released():
            del self._strat
```

but this is assuming that attributes get zeroed out on deallocation (Can we even assume that `self.reductio_strategy` is still alive at this point?)

Then you could do in `ReductionStrategy.__dealloc__`:

```
        if self._strat:
            PBRedStrategy_delete(self._strat)
            self._strat = NULL
```
    
However, that's assuming that we can establish whether `GroebnerStrategy.reduction_strategy` is still valid upon deallocation. Since `GroebnerStrategy` has borrowed the reference without `ReductionStrategy` really knowing, I think `GroebnerStrategy` should just not delete `_strat`. In due time, `ReductionStrategy.__dealloc__` gets called and will clean up the ref. It's hers!

No, the reduction strategy borrows from the Gröbner strategy.

But who else should?

No. `reduction_strategy._strat` does not borrow a reference to `_strat` (hence, `ReductionStrategy.__dealloc__` does *not* dealloc `GroebnerStrategy._strat`), but it borrows a reference to `_strat.generators`.

That's why I think Jean-Pierre's solution is logical: Explicitly tell `ReductionStrategy` whether its `_strat` is borrowed from a `GroebnerStrategy`'s `_strat.generators`.

YES! All tests pass for me too. I think the saying is "Mission Accomplished".

Concerning speed effects:

5.3b2 + (#715, #11521, #12215, #12313):

```
Total time for all tests: 1001.4 seconds
Total time for all tests: 1002.6 seconds
```

plain 5.3b2:

```
Total time for all tests: 928.5 seconds
Total time for all tests: 932.6 seconds
```

so people might want to profile their code every now and again to see if they are losing much time on construction/destruction of parents.

I'll try to finalize the positive reviews on all these tickets and then hopefully these can be the first ones in on 5.4.

Again, the problem is that `GroebnerStrategy._strat` is not the thing that is lend to `ReductionStrategy._strat`. The reference that is lend is `GroebnerStrategy._strat.generators`. But since `GroebnerStrategy._strat` is more than that, `GroebnerStrategy.__dealloc__` *must* take care of it. "Take care of that" means: Call a C++ destructor on `GroebnerStrategy._strat`.

Well, they are different things.

That is almost 8% regression. That isn't good. Can you find out what tests contribute most to the regression?

Hence, while Sage starts, many things are created without keeping a reference to them, so that they will be garbage collection before the user has even the chance to see them. I think it would be good (also for Sage startup time) to avoid that to happen. But I reckon this should be on a new ticket.

Speed regression mitigation is definitely going onto another ticket; #13400 I'd say. The consensus here is clearly that reasonable memory use trumps a (relatively small) speed penalty. I'm not so sure that the doctests are such a good measure fore "performance" anyway.

I'm not surprised we're not doing so well in that park, but we already have some small improvements on future tickets (although I bet the main penalty is coming from NOT having things cached anymore sometimes).

Anyway, the code here (and on the dependencies of this ticket!) has been discussed and vetted to death already. Bot's complaining about a bit of whitespace, which should be trivial to fix. In anticipation of that getting removed:

**POSITIVE REVIEW!!!**

Congratulations, to all who participated and especially Simon for an incredible diligence and calm in pushing through this at times seemingly hopeless process.

There are a lot of people in the review field of this ticket. If any of them dissent with the status, they can take action.

Thanks for pointing out this issue. But it is not related to the spkg. In the spkg you have a composed C++ class with public attributes, that is managed with C++ constructors and destructors.
But cython seems not to be able to wrap the c++ attributes (unlike `PolyBoRi`'s original interface based on boost/python). The only solution I can think of is the a flag, which was exactly what this ticket came up with. Alternatively a reference count. (I think boost/python uses one or the other internally, too.)

Is #13447 really needed as a dependency?
From what I remember, #715 had to permanently keep libsingular rings alive because of the bsd.math bug.
And #13447 intends to replace this workaround by a proper fix.
I've not followed the discussion at #13447, but it seems to me that #12313 is needed by #13447 to get proper garbage collection, but it does not seem obvious that #12313 depends on #13447.
Is there some rebase needed?
Did I miss some other step?

I'll give Jeroen a chance to motivate the change in dependencies, but I think it shouldn't be there. The positive review (and all the patches to be applied) predate the existence of #13447, so they can't possibly depend on it.

Any issues that might require #13447 should be resolved with the strong caching workaround introduced in #715.

If the patches here were to require #13447 to function properly then it should be marked as "only merge together with"; not as a merge dependency (which would suggest the wrong merge order). Do we want to add "post merge dependencies" to trac?

    "body": "<a id='comment:6'></a>\nUnfortunately, doctests don't all succeed for me. I've built 5.6rc0 from scratch and applied #12215 and #12313. I get a SIGFPE in\n\n```\n ./sage -t -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py\n```\ngdb:\n\n```\nProgram received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.\n__pyx_pf_4sage_9structure_11coerce_dict_16TripleDictEraser_2__call__ (__pyx_v_r=<optimized out>,\n    __pyx_v_self=<optimized out>) at sage/structure/coerce_dict.c:1107\n1107      __pyx_t_10 = PyList_GET_ITEM(__pyx_t_1, (__pyx_v_h % PyList_GET_SIZE(__pyx_t_4)));\n(gdb) l\n1102     */\n1103      __pyx_t_1 = __pyx_v_self->D->buckets;\n1104      __Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_1);\n1105      __pyx_t_4 = __pyx_v_self->D->buckets;\n1106      __Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_4);\n1107      __pyx_t_10 = PyList_GET_ITEM(__pyx_t_1, (__pyx_v_h % PyList_GET_SIZE(__pyx_t_4)));\n(gdb) p PyString_AsString(PyObject_Repr(__pyx_t_4))\n$4 = 0xd5090e4 \"None\"\n```\nSo at this point `self.D.buckets==None`. Doing list-type transactions using non-error checking macros is probably not a good idea. This code corresponds to `structure/coerce_dict.pyx:121`. Apparently, a callback is happening while the dictionary itself is already being torn down!\n\nA traceback indeed shows that this is all happening as part of a garbage collection of a TripleDict (I think that's what frame 15 indicates),ironically, triggered by the allocation of a new TripleDict.\nI'm including rather a lot of the backtrace, because frame 100 is already in the sage library: Apparently, some operations easily trigger 100 level deep stacks!\n\n```\n(gdb) bt\n#0  __pyx_pf_4sage_9structure_11coerce_dict_16TripleDictEraser_2__call__ (__pyx_v_r=<optimized out>, \n

these situations would be collected and discarded, but apparently we have a scenario here that's not detected by the python GC. If my diagnosis is correct, we should not assume that attributes on `self.D` are still valid in `TripleDictEraser`, which surprises me a bit. It's easily checked of course: If `self.D.buckets` is `None`, we don't have to do anything. Relevant code:\n\n```\nstatic int __pyx_tp_clear_4sage_9structure_11coerce_dict_TripleDict(PyObject *o) {\n  struct __pyx_obj_4sage_9structure_11coerce_dict_TripleDict *p = (struct __pyx_obj_4sage_9structure_11coerce_dict_TripleDict *)o;\n  PyObject* tmp;\n  tmp = ((PyObject*)p->buckets);\n  p->buckets = Py_None; Py_INCREF(Py_None);\n  Py_XDECREF(tmp);\n  tmp = ((PyObject*)p->_refcache);\n  p->_refcache = ((PyObject*)Py_None); Py_INCREF(Py_None);\n  Py_XDECREF(tmp);\n  tmp = ((PyObject*)p->eraser);\n  p->eraser = ((struct __pyx_obj_4sage_9structure_11coerce_dict_TripleDictEraser *)Py_None); Py_INCREF(Py_None);\n  Py_XDECREF(tmp);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nso indeed, `D.buckets` is set to `None` before `D.buckets` is deleted. I'm surprised that this deletion (of something that is garbage, so the eraser, which has an indirect strong link to it, must be garbage as well) apparently can still trigger a callback. It wouldn't surprise me if we could engineer this into something that would be considered a bug in Python. Anyway, to be safe, check that self.D.buckets is still alive before we do something with it! (either that or my sage/python build is seriously screwed and I'm seeing something that shouldn't happen).",

Unfortunately, doctests don't all succeed for me. I've built 5.6rc0 from scratch and applied #12215 and #12313. I get a SIGFPE in

```
 ./sage -t -force_lib devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py

gdb:

```

So at this point `self.D.buckets==None`. Doing list-type transactions using non-error checking macros is probably not a good idea. This code corresponds to `structure/coerce_dict.pyx:121`. Apparently, a callback is happening while the dictionary itself is already being torn down!

A traceback indeed shows that this is all happening as part of a garbage collection of a TripleDict (I think that's what frame 15 indicates),ironically, triggered by the allocation of a new TripleDict.
I'm including rather a lot of the backtrace, because frame 100 is already in the sage library: Apparently, some operations easily trigger 100 level deep stacks!

Anyway, I had originally thought that callbacks in these situations would be collected and discarded, but apparently we have a scenario here that's not detected by the python GC. If my diagnosis is correct, we should not assume that attributes on `self.D` are still valid in `TripleDictEraser`, which surprises me a bit. It's easily checked of course: If `self.D.buckets` is `None`, we don't have to do anything. Relevant code:

```
static int __pyx_tp_clear_4sage_9structure_11coerce_dict_TripleDict(PyObject *o) {
  struct __pyx_obj_4sage_9structure_11coerce_dict_TripleDict *p = (struct __pyx_obj_4sage_9structure_11coerce_dict_TripleDict *)o;
  PyObject* tmp;
  tmp = ((PyObject*)p->buckets);
  p->buckets = Py_None; Py_INCREF(Py_None);
  Py_XDECREF(tmp);
  tmp = ((PyObject*)p->_refcache);
  p->_refcache = ((PyObject*)Py_None); Py_INCREF(Py_None);
  Py_XDECREF(tmp);
  tmp = ((PyObject*)p->eraser);
  p->eraser = ((struct __pyx_obj_4sage_9structure_11coerce_dict_TripleDictEraser *)Py_None); Py_INCREF(Py_None);
  Py_XDECREF(tmp);
  return 0;
}
```
so indeed, `D.buckets` is set to `None` before `D.buckets` is deleted. I'm surprised that this deletion (of something that is garbage, so the eraser, which has an indirect strong link to it, must be garbage as well) apparently can still trigger a callback. It wouldn't surprise me if we could engineer this into something that would be considered a bug in Python. Anyway, to be safe, check that self.D.buckets is still alive before we do something with it! (either that or my sage/python build is seriously screwed and I'm seeing something that shouldn't happen).

I think we just have to live with this: cycle breaking can be arbitrarily complicated, so we cannot expect Python to fully protect against it. Any routine involved in deallocation has to be prepared to find attributes already cleared.

Exercise: prove or disprove: determining whether a callback triggered by a GC needs to be executed is NP-hard.

Unfortunately, the combination #13378 + #12215 + #12313 gives a serious slowdown for

```
from sage.combinat.sf.k_dual import DualkSchurFunctions
Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t'].fraction_field())
dks4 = DualkSchurFunctions(Sym.kBoundedQuotient(4))
time TestSuite(dks4).run()
```
from 8 seconds before the patches to 90 seconds with the patches.

Just #13378 alone is fine.

Did you also test #13378 plus #12215? That's to say, is #12313 to blame, or could it be #12215?

Here is the outcome of

```
sage: from sage.combinat.sf.k_dual import DualkSchurFunctions

sage: dks4 = DualkSchurFunctions(Sym.kBoundedQuotient(4))
sage: %prun TestSuite(dks4).run()

I'm afraid I have to leave now. But the fact that repr is called so often makes me guess that there is indeed caching involved - namely with a hash function that relies on the string representation. But if that was correct, neither `MonoDict` nor `TripleDict` are to blame: They compare by identity and thus don't rely on the hash of the keys.

Sure.

> However, aren't `testsuites` made from automatic tests? In that case wouldn't it be a very atypical mess of tiny little self-contained constructions to test, e.g., commutativity, property of identity etc? We shouldn't be optimizing code for those.

Yes - and the fact that these tiny little constructions take so much time means that they are totally useless and have to be improved.

No, I don't think this would be a solution. The dramatic increase in running time probably points to a general problem.

Had a quick look. To simplify and speed up the tests a little bit, you can concentrate on one of the tests that's slow:

```
sage: cmd='dks4._test_associativity()'
sage: import cProfile,pstats
sage: s=pstats.Stats(cProfile.Profile().runctx(cmd,globals(),{}))
sage: S=s.sort_stats('cumulative')
sage: S.print_stats()
...
sage: S.print_callers()
...
```
the latter one essentially gives you the call graph, weighted by time contributed.

In fact it shows you pretty quickly that ShurFunctions were apparently VERY heavily relying on parents being cached:

```
X=dks4[0]+ 2*dks4[1] + 3*dks4[2]
(X*X)*X #wait quite a long time
```
This mainly uses `dks4.product` and you can follow the code from there to see this has not been written with runtime optimization in mind. Probably if you make some things cached the way there, you'll regain the original performance.

My first impression is that this code indeed will make a concrete realization of some structure, perform the operation, and throw away the concrete realization. Elements on the way basically ARE homs, hence all the homsets. I'm sure someone will be grateful if you clean up this design, but I'm not so sure it should be part of this ticket or a requirement for its merger. Good luck!

And on the other hand, many other parts of the Sage library are affected by keeping garbage in memory indefinitely.

I think the normal behaviour of a CAS should be that a structure S is considered garbage and can be collected, unless the user has constructed some object O and keeps a reference to it, and O keeps a chain of references to S. Sadly, that was not the case for Sage, but this ticket is part of an attempt to make Sage behave "normally" in that department.

Hence, if the same structure is needed repeatedly during a computation, then the programmer should keep a reference to it locally, rather than relying on an external cache. And if different methods of an object O will use the same structure S, then it makes sense to store S as an attribute of O, in order to prevent S from being garbage collected as long as O is alive (but not longer than that).

I think what Nils wanted to say is: If other parts of the Sage library do not obey the general rules formulated in the preceding paragraph, but rely on an infinite external cache, then they need to be fixed. But the need to fix them should not prevent us from changing the infinite external cache to a finite external cache, because that is of benefit for all parts in the Sage library that follow the general rules.

Jeroen, I guess you have access to doc test timings for various versions of Sage. Would it be possible for you to find out which tests become slower with #12313? That might give us an idea how bad of a regression we would have.

Maybe we hsould open a "metaticket" to track this regression and point there to tickets that will actually fix each of these regressions?

It's jsut that the ticket here is getting quite long and we risk to lose track of the regressions (if more are to come).

To my understanding, the memory leak fixes are fine up to and including #12215. One could argue that the ticket from here is also fixing a general memory leak, and fixing a general leak counts more than a few speed regressions in specialised code. But one could argue that we should be happy to have the fixes up to #12215 in the next Sage release, and should not spoil it with several speed regressions - hence, #12313 should not be merged until we found a way to lift the regression.

I don't know what Jeroen prefers.

If he intends to merge #12313 soon, then it would make sense to change #13991 into a task (=metaticket), the original purpose of #13991 probably being solved by #13605.

If he intends to not merge #12313 before all regressions are solved, then I see no benefit in crating a separate metaticket. Instead, one should put #12313 as "needs work" and create new tickets for the separate aspects of regression, making them dependencies for #12313.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A295):

The profile calls look exactly the same. More time is spent in `sage.rings.arith.kronecker_symbol`, though and oddly enough the time seems to go into conversion from `ZZ` to `QQ`:

```
x=-20
def test():
       for n in xrange(10**7):
         _=QQ(x)
 
sage: time test()
```
goes from `Time: CPU 2.97 s, Wall: 2.98 s` to `Time: CPU 8.53 s, Wall: 8.57 s`. Python level profiling doesn't tell us anything for this.

I suspect that the whole ` QQ(x).numerator() * QQ(x).denominator()` thing in `kroneckersymbol` is actually unnecessary for the purposes where it's used (it doesn't do anything of the sort for `y`), but that's rather irrelevant: This seems to be a case where discovery of a rather obvious conversion seems to have become quite a bit more expensive!

**EDIT:**

It could just be this:

```
sage: M=sage.structure.coerce_dict.MonoDict(23)
sage: M[ZZ]=1
sage: %timeit _=M[ZZ]
625 loops, best of 3: 331 ns per loop
sage: D={ZZ:1}
sage: %timeit _=D[ZZ]
625 loops, best of 3: 110 ns per loop
```
which is fair enough: `MonoDict` is a weak key dictionary, so looking up an entry has an extra level of indirection. We're bound to lose some time there. I don't think we can count that as a regression, though: We weren't doing enough work before.

Compared to the (python) `weakref.WeakKeyDictionary` we do pretty well:

```
sage: W=weakref.WeakKeyDictionary()
sage: W[ZZ]=1
sage: %timeit _=W[ZZ]
625 loops, best of 3: 1.36 µs per loop
```

It would be good if someone else can confirm that this explains the regression. I don't think it's a deadly one: If someone wants to do a conversion in an inner loop, they probably know the type of object they're working with, so they could just extract the morphism and apply it directly. That avoids *any* lookup. I'd deem this one a necessary regression that doesn't need to be addressed, or at least can be addressed partially later, as with #13387 (which presently mainly indexes comments on this megaticket)

Together with #13387, one gets

```
sage: M=sage.structure.coerce_dict.MonoDict(23)
sage: R = ZZ['x','y','z']
sage: M[R]=1
sage: D={R:1}
sage: timeit("_=M[R]", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 204 ns per loop
sage: timeit("_=D[R]", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 361 ns per loop
sage: D[ZZ]=2
sage: M[ZZ]=2
sage: timeit("_=M[R]", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 204 ns per loop
sage: timeit("_=D[R]", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 359 ns per loop
sage: timeit("_=M[ZZ]", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 206 ns per loop
sage: timeit("_=D[ZZ]", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 98.4 ns per loop
```
Hence, it becomes faster, but a Python dictionary is still faster if "easy" targets such as ZZ are involved.

Indeed, ZZ is very quick at basic operations:

```
sage: timeit("hash(ZZ)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 103 ns per loop
sage: timeit("id(ZZ)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 102 ns per loop
sage: timeit("hash(R)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 329 ns per loop
```
Hence, the hash of ZZ (used in dict) is as fast as id (used in `MonoDict`). No surprise that it is *that* fast.

Those timing lines don't relate to `ZZ`. Since your other timings are in line with what I found doing exactly the same example above, you'd probably also see that lookup of `ZZ` in D is about 3 times as fast as it is in `M`.

It's interesting to see that many rings in sage are so much slower (unique parents should always be able to use `id` for equality and for their hash, right?)

Anyway, going from a strong dict to a weak key dict is *supposed* to be a little slower, so this is not an issue. We'll just have to live with it.

A more serious issue is the limited use of `MonoDict` in this case. Essentially, this `MonoDict` only has an effect for the cases where we cache that there is NO coercion: In the other cases, we have an entry

```
M[Domain] = coercion map from Domain to This Parent
```
i.e., the value in the weak key dict will hold a strong reference to the key. A self-quotation from [sage-flame](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-flame/msg/51ee8af7cc2cac11?hl=en) seems appropriate.

I think this is an fundamental problem and just one people will have to hold in mind: Coercing TO something will make the object you coerce FROM stay in memory for as long as the target is there. It's just a little disappointing that all this effort for a weak key dict is only going to make a difference for the entries that store `None` as a value. Oh well. That does happen a lot. AND we are getting speed increases in many cases!

I am not so sure, because I think this was one of the memleaks I explicitly addressed somewhere. But since my Sage install currently is *without* #12313, I need to recompile now -- which takes an eternity. I hope I'll be able to show you an example.

Anyway.

Here is a timing that shows that this patch has a bad effect *both* on looking up the coercion map *and* applying the coercion:

Without #12313

```
sage: timeit("phi=QQ.coerce_map_from(ZZ)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 503 ns per loop
sage: phi=QQ.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
sage: x = -20
sage: timeit("phi(x)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 563 ns per loop
```

With #12313:

```
sage: timeit("phi=QQ.coerce_map_from(ZZ)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 738 ns per loop
sage: phi=QQ.coerce_map_from(ZZ)
sage: x = -20
sage: timeit("phi(x)", number=10^6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 616 ns per loop
```

The crash is:
* not happening on vanilla 5.7.beta1
* happening on vanilla 5.7.beta2

So it might be the case that #12215 is not the culprit but it looks like it is involved from the backtraces produced.
Maybe its the combination of tickets in beta2 which triggers the errors.
Remember just how problematic it was to reproduce the problem caused by #715 et al.

You didn't report the timings for `ZZ` lookup with #12313  *without* #13387. Probably just a pasting mistake. Doesn't matter, we have the general picture.

> I am not so sure, because I think this was one of the memleaks I explicitly addressed somewhere.

You did something for actions somewhere, where you ensured the maps were on underlying sets, for this reason. But the plain case of one ring coercing into another (e.g., virtually any ring into `SR`) does nail
the ring into memory. Some examples (with #12313):

Having no coerce map indeed works fine now:

```
sage: import gc
sage: T=type(GF(2))
sage: 
sage: for p in prime_range(2,300):
....:     k=GF(p)
....:     _=ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(k)
....: 
sage: del k
sage: gc.collect()
1412
sage: len(list(o for o in gc.get_objects() if type(o) is T))
1
```
and having coerce maps in the opposite direction doesn't hurt either:

```
sage: for p in prime_range(2,300):
....:     k=GF(p)
....:     _=k.has_coerce_map_from(ZZ)
....: 
sage: del k
sage: 
sage: gc.collect()
7852
sage: len(list(o for o in gc.get_objects() if type(o) is T))
1
```
But having for instance a convert map (these are cached in the same way as coercions) things do get nailed into memory:

```
sage: for p in prime_range(2,300):
....:     k=GF(p)
....:     _=ZZ.convert_map_from(k) #this nails k in memory
....: 
sage: del k
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: len(list(o for o in gc.get_objects() if type(o) is T))
62
```
And this is why coercing into `SR` (*anything* goes there) is so detrimental:

```
sage: import gc
sage: sage: T=type(GF(2))
sage: len(list(o for o in gc.get_objects() if type(o) is T))
1
sage: for p in prime_range(2,300):
....:     k=GF(p)
....:     _=SR.has_coerce_map_from(k)
....: 
sage: del k, _
sage: gc.collect()
271
sage: len(list(o for o in gc.get_objects() if type(o) is T))
62
```
Back to worrying things. Just to double check that element creation is not a problem:

```
sage: import gc
sage: sage: T=type(GF(2))
sage: len(list(o for o in gc.get_objects() if type(o) is T))
1
sage: for p in prime_range(2,300):
....:     k=GF(p)
....:     _=k(1)
....: 
sage: del k, _
sage: gc.collect()
2656
sage: len(list(o for o in gc.get_objects() if type(o) is T))
1
```
so one would hope that the following would be OK, but it's not. I guess binops get cached somewhere as well?

```
sage: for p in prime_range(2,300):
....:     k=GF(p)
....:     _=k(1)+ZZ(1)
....: 
sage: del k, _
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: len(list(o for o in gc.get_objects() if type(o) is T))
62
```
(I've checked that `ZZ(1)+k(1)` gives the same result). That is a worrying leak, I think. Adding `ZZ(1)` to a ring element is something people are quite likely to think is reasonable. But that seems to nail the ring into memory again! I think this means there is room for a follow-up ticket. I think a nice lead is the result from:

```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: maps, actions = cm.get_cache()
```
this seems to hold plenty of references to finite fields after the last example, both in keys and in values (I suppose the coercion model keeps a lot of these things in `TripleDict`, so the key references shouldn't matter but the references in values do, because those would contribute to refcounts.

I'm afraid the binary operation discovery of the coercion framework *is* a memory leak, so the proper solution is probably to give people good tools to avoid depending on it.

#14058 is making good progress on resolving that issue and depends on this ticket to have effect.

The speed regression reported in [comment:276] has been diagnosed and fixed on #13991. This conflicts with work on the much broader scoped #13605, but that ticket doesn't seem to be going in any time soon, so we should probably just push #13991 in before it. I think one can even consider merging #12313 without it.

The speed regression reported on [comment:295] is minor and probably essential to some degree, because a lookup in a weakly keyed dict is fundamentally more expensive than in a normal dict. #13387 mitigates the effects to some extent, but again merging #12313 without it is acceptable in my opinion.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:8'></a>\nI am not able to reproduce this error, however \"coerce_dict.pyx\", line 1079 is\n\n```\n# Test whether the old references are still active\nr1,r2,r3 = <tuple>(self._refcache[h1,h2,h3])\n```\nthe line \"homset.py\", line 266:\n\n```\n    _cache[key] = KeyedRef(H, _cache.eraser, (id(X),id(Y),id(category)))\n```\nwas introduced in #11521, the [trac_11521_callback.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11521/trac_11521_callback.patch.gz), to be precise.\n\nI'm a little worried about this implementation, because it's relying on implementation details of a tripledict that aren't really part of the API (in particular, here it's relying on the `TripleDict.eraser` attribute and its call convention).

I am not able to reproduce this error, however "coerce_dict.pyx", line 1079 is

```
# Test whether the old references are still active
r1,r2,r3 = <tuple>(self._refcache[h1,h2,h3])
```
the line "homset.py", line 266:

```
    _cache[key] = KeyedRef(H, _cache.eraser, (id(X),id(Y),id(category)))
```
was introduced in #11521, the [trac_11521_callback.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11521/trac_11521_callback.patch.gz), to be precise.

I'm a little worried about this implementation, because it's relying on implementation details of a tripledict that aren't really part of the API (in particular, here it's relying on the `TripleDict.eraser` attribute and its call convention). I think this should be refactored to a method

```
_cache.set_weakvalued(key, H)
```
so that the tripledict can figure out how to put a properly formatted callback on the value.

A quick "solution" might be to merge #13387 as well, since that gets rid of `self._refcache`. However, I'm a little puzzled how this error can occur:

- By the time we arrive at line 1079 we have succeeded in finding the key triple `(h1,h2,h3)`.
- The KeyError indicates that `_refcache` doesn't contain the key anymore.
- But key removal from `_refcache` and from `bucket` are inextricably linked! This means that a key removal was triggered somewhere between finding the element in the bucket and looking up in `_refcache`. But that should mean that `bucket` got modified too! That's really worrisome, because at this point we're ready to scribble in `bucket` at a location we've counted before.

Indeed, if we are allocating memory anywhere in the loop that walks through the bucket we could be triggering a garbage collection, which could indeed include callbacks that modify this very bucket. I don't think any of the lines here could do that, though, except for
`(self._refcache[h1,h2,h3])` itself, if that needs to construct a tuple or something like that.

So my guess is: The entry that's keyed `(17671424, 82669344, 20657216)` is indeed liable to get a callback from a garbage collection and thus be removed, but that hasn't happened yet. However, in preparing the call
`self._refcache[h1,h2,h3]` the system needs to make a python tuple (h1,h2,h3) to pass to `__getitem__` and that triggers the very GC that deletes the entry from `bucket` and `_refcache`; hence the key error.

In other words, we need to make absolutely sure that in this lookup loop, no memory allocations whatsoever are done, because any of those could trigger a GC that can corrupt our view of what the bucket should look like.

Looking at the lookup loop at #13387 for this, I think no memory allocations are made there, so if my diagnosis is correct, then merging that ticket would in fact be a proper fix.

I still think we shouldn't be making `KeyedRef` instances using the `eraser` of a `TripleDict` outside the `TripleDict` itself, though.

Looking at the code cython generates I think my diagnosis is a possibility:

```
 *                         # Test whether the old references are still active
 *                         r1,r2,r3 = <tuple>(self._refcache[h1,h2,h3])             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 *                         if (isinstance(r1,KeyedRef) and r1() is None) or \
 *                            (isinstance(r2,KeyedRef) and r2() is None) or \
 */
...
          __pyx_t_9 = PyTuple_New(3); if (unlikely(!__pyx_t_9))
          __Pyx_GOTREF(__pyx_t_9);
          PyTuple_SET_ITEM(__pyx_t_9, 0, __pyx_t_1);
          __Pyx_GIVEREF(__pyx_t_1);
          PyTuple_SET_ITEM(__pyx_t_9, 1, __pyx_t_5);
          __Pyx_GIVEREF(__pyx_t_5);
          PyTuple_SET_ITEM(__pyx_t_9, 2, __pyx_t_8);
          __Pyx_GIVEREF(__pyx_t_8);
...
          __pyx_t_8 = __Pyx_PyDict_GetItem(((PyObject *)__pyx_v_self->__pyx_base._refcache), ((PyObject *)__pyx_t_9)); if (!__pyx_t_8) {__pyx_filename = __pyx_f[0]; __pyx_lineno = 1079; __pyx_clineno = __LINE__; goto __pyx_L1_error;}
...
```
As you see the lookup code does start with a `PyTuple_New` that could trigger a GC leading to removal of the key that gets looked up in the last line (where the `KeyError` would originate).

**TL;DR:** merge #13387

**Conjectures on how the bug in [comment:317] can occur**

I had a bit of trouble coming up with a scenario where a key triple could get deleted during its setting. The reason is that when someone is setting a key, presumably they are holding (strong) references to the key components, so those can't possibly be slated for deletion.

However, the very statement introduces by #11521 changes that: 
- A value in a TripleDict may be stored via a weak reference (this was already the case)
- It installs a callback on the weakref that removes the keytriple:weakref pair from the dictionary (this IS new).

However, since actual deallocation of this weakreffed value may be delayed, it is very well possible that by the time the callback gets executed, the value stored under the key triple is no longer the original value. Thus, deletion is unwarranted! Therefore, the callback on this weakreffed value should check that the key component is as expected AND that the stored value is still as expected (a dead weakref would do, but checking that it's the exact weakref that we expect there would be even better). Otherwise, we may be erasing entries that don't have to do with the just deallocated object!

My guess is that #14084 might have something to do with that. Are there ever situations where the homset cached for two objects gets changed (category refinement comes to mind as one case where this might happen ...).? That could well lead to the scenario sketched above.

In short: [trac_11521_callback.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket11521/trac_11521_callback.patch.gz) doesn't seem entirely safe to me, because the callback installed on the value only checks the key for deletion. It doesn't check that the value hasn't changed in the mean time.

We still need #13387 anyway, because ANY GC event in the lookup loop can have disastrous consequences which, like any memory corruption, could go unnoticed for a long time and then lead to undefined behaviour later on. The `PyTuple_New` in the currently generated code means we cannot rule this out.

I thought it *was* absolutely necessary, and since it wasn't merged yet, I thought it was OK to do it here.

> I've uploaded your patch there (and changed the commit message to reflect the appropriate ticket number). I hope that's OK with you.

I can't remove the attachment, but I can remove it from the list of to-be-applied-patches.

> and move the ticket back to "Positive".

OK.
