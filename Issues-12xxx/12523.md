Any cell that launches Jmol generates an error of the following type

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (NOT 
FOUND) -- http://sagenb.org/home/pub/4316/JmolApplet 
```

This error does not seem to break Jmol.  It appears there is some stray code that is making an improper call for an applet.  The call should be for `JmolApplet0.jar` and should be to the directory where Jmol is stored.

The proper call is being made because Jmol works.

Find the stray code and remove it. Likely locations jmol_lib.js(has been check), jmol.js(supplied with jmol) and plot3d/base.py.
