Right now the matrix modn sparse class uses ints to store entries.    The basic reason is the code

```
cdef struct c_vector_modint:
    int *entries
```
in sage/modules/vector_modn_sparse_h.pxi.  This should probably instead use the unsigned C99 type uint_fast64_t.

I strongly support using ints with a specified size when they will be used for arithmetic. I am not familar with the Win64 support problem so I can not tell for this aspect, but otherwise, this seems like a very good move.

I do need to get the Cygwin patchbot working again.  I was running one for a time but it went down, and I never got it running again.  Samuel also had one running for a time but he's out of town and I don't know what happened to it.  Maybe I'll work on that today.

Nevertheless I don't see any special reason to test this on Windows.  int_fast_64_t is part of the C99 standard and will resolve to the appropriate type on the target platform.
