Right now the matrix modn sparse class uses ints to store entries.    The basic reason is the code

```
cdef struct c_vector_modint:
    int *entries
```
in sage/modules/vector_modn_sparse_h.pxi.  This should probably instead use the unsigned C99 type uint_fast64_t.

As discussed in #14627, this should really be signed `int_fast64_t`. Then it fits into a PyInt on all sensible (i.e. excluding Win64) platforms.

I see, you were worrying about this comment.  But it's not an issue.  I think the concern here was that on native Windows compilers `sizeof(long) == 4` (and the Python 2 `PyIntObject` uses a `long` to store its value).  But [on Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/programming.html#gcc-64) `sizeof(long) == 8` so this is not a problem, as we don't support Sage on native Windows anyways.

Plus it's only an issue for Python 2.  In the Python 3 `PyLongObject` which is used for all `int`s, it uses (by default, on any modern 64-bit system) exact bit size types.
