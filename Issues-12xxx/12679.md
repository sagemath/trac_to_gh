Right now the matrix modn sparse class uses ints to store entries.    The basic reason is the code

```
cdef struct c_vector_modint:
    int *entries
```
in sage/modules/vector_modn_sparse_h.pxi.  This should probably instead use the unsigned C99 type uint_fast64_t.

I do need to get the Cygwin patchbot working again.  I was running one for a time but it went down, and I never got it running again.  Samuel also had one running for a time but he's out of town and I don't know what happened to it.  Maybe I'll work on that today.

Nevertheless I don't see any special reason to test this on Windows.  int_fast_64_t is part of the C99 standard and will resolve to the appropriate type on the target platform.

I see, you were worrying about this comment.  But it's not an issue.  I think the concern here was that on native Windows compilers `sizeof(long) == 4` (and the Python 2 `PyIntObject` uses a `long` to store its value).

Plus it's only an issue for Python 2.  In the Python 3 `PyLongObject` which is used for all `int`s, it uses (by default, on any modern 64-bit system) exact bit size types.
