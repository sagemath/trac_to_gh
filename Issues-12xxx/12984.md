ecl 12.2.1 has unicode support enabled by default, what creates two string types, t_base_string and t_string. The problem is that sage does not properly handle those, as described in https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3526370&group_id=30035&atid=398053

I made a simple patch for sagemath in my work in progress package for fedora using system packages, but now was also hit by a gc upgrade that no longer exports symbols used by ecl, as describe in https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3526174&group_id=30035&atid=398053

Duplicate of #12985.

Weird, I had only clicked on preview, but actual report is #12985 where I added a proposed patch and removed the second paragraph about yet another problem.
