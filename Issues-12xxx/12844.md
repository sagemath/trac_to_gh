Continued from #12620, there are still issues with the documentation of shapes.pyx and shapes2.py. Some examples:

* Many functions take a `color` argument with the description,

  {{{
  -  ``color`` - a word that describes a color`
  }}}

 which is inaccurate.

* The `A square black box:` example in `Box` is not black.

* Some doctests are misformatted, e.g.

  {{{
  EXAMPLES:
       sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.shapes import Box
  }}}

* `Torus` is missing a docstring:

  {{{
  cdef class Torus(ParametricSurface):
  # e.g  show(sum([Torus(1,.03,20,20, color=[1, float(t/30), 0]).rotate((1,1,1),t) for t in range(30)], Sphere(.3)))
  }}}
