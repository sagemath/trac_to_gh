Well, here's an SPKG: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/keshav/files/lie-2.2.2.p4.spkg

Questions: should the files really be put in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/LiE`? They are not exactly libraries. But they are not exactly "architecture-independent" (since they contain binaries), so the FHS says they shouldn't go in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/LiE` either.

That seems like maybe the most reasonable option, but then I need to figure out which files are unnecessary for the final binary.
