<a id='comment:3'></a>The following should be using xreadlines, to save memory:

```
for line in file('src/allcurves.00000-09999').readlines():
```


This optional test in cremona.py is bad, since it will always fail when the optional package is installed. 

```
        sage: c = CremonaDatabase()
        sage: isinstance(c, sage.databases.cremona.MiniCremonaDatabase)
        True
        sage: isinstance(c, sage.databases.cremona.LargeCremonaDatabase)  # optional - database_cremona_ellcurve
        True
```
Also, the name of the optional component is totally wrong -- it should be elliptic_curves, which is the name of the spkg:

```
sage-4.8/spkg/standard/elliptic_curves-0.3.spkg
```

Anyway, trac #11587 unfortunately introduced many issues.  Let's fix them asap for 5.0!

I think the culprit is line 1088:

```
sage: c = CremonaDatabase('cremona') # optional
```
The issue is because I didn't check for `read_only=False` before opening a non-existent database. Shouldn't be too hard to fix.

> I have not checked all the logic in the revised code.


I don't think I have explained the issue that this ticket fixes very clearly (which was exposed when running one of the optional doctests without having the optional spkg installed). There are 2 main issues that caused this:

* When calling `CremonaDatabase('name')` the file `SAGE_ROOT/data/cremona/name.db` was being touched, something that is bad in general if the file wasn't there to start with.

* When calling `CremonaDatabase()`, to determine if the full database is installed, it would check for the existence of `SAGE_ROOT/data/cremona/cremona.db` rather than use one of the functions in `sage.misc` for this purpose.

With these combined, running the optional doctests would break the cremona database: it would run `CremonaDatabase('cremona')`, which would touch `SAGE_ROOT/data/cremona/cremona.db` and thus later calls of `CremonaDatabase()` would break since it would think the full cremona database was installed and try to use the touched file.

> I was puzzled by the remark about testing with flag --optional since I thought that only made sense with some sensible string after the word "optional", e.g. "magma".


Unless you want to test all optional packages (which could be useful for a giant system install -- unfortunately there are a few optional packages that don't want to build properly at the moment).

> But it seems that there are doctest lines which are tagged "# optional" with no mention of which optional package is relevant.


I consider this a bug and something that should be required for any optional tags.

With sage-5.4.beta1 with no optional spkgs installed, all tests pass if -optional is not given, while if -optional is given then there are two failures in elliptic_curve/, both due to {{{database_cremona_ellcurve}} not being installed.  After installing that one optional spkg, all these pass.  That is as it should be.

Very sorry, that was entirely my fault as your rebased patch had the same name as the previous one;  I had the old patch on my machine and just edited the patch file without downloading the new version.
