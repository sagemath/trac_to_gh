I am on Ubuntu 11.10, and noticed that a fresh install of Sage 4.8 fails a bunch of tests because the full cremona database is an empty file by default.

The following should be using xreadlines, to save memory:

```
for line in file('src/allcurves.00000-09999').readlines():
```


This optional test in cremona.py is bad, since it will always fail when the optional package is installed. 

```
        sage: c = CremonaDatabase()
        sage: isinstance(c, sage.databases.cremona.MiniCremonaDatabase)
        True
        sage: isinstance(c, sage.databases.cremona.LargeCremonaDatabase)  # optional - database_cremona_ellcurve
        True
```
Also, the name of the optional component is totally wrong -- it should be elliptic_curves, which is the name of the spkg:

```
sage-4.8/spkg/standard/elliptic_curves-0.3.spkg
```

Anyway, trac #11587 unfortunately introduced many issues.  Let's fix them asap for 5.0!

This will create an empty cremona database as a side effect, even though it should not.

I think the culprit is line 1088:

```
sage: c = CremonaDatabase('cremona') # optional
```
The issue is because I didn't check for `read_only=False` before opening a non-existent database. Shouldn't be too hard to fix.

Patch applies fine and all elliptic_curves tests pass both before and after installing the optional database (which with 5.0.bets5 I installed with a plain "sage -i database_cremona_ellcurve").

I have not checked all the logic in the revised code.  I was puzzled by the remark about testing with flag --optional since I thought that only made sense with some sensible string after the word "optional", e.g. "magma".  But it seems that there are doctest lines which are tagged "# optional" with no mention of which optional package is relevant.  Possibly for this reason, I had weird failures with

```
sage -t --optional devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py # 3 doctests failed
```
which may have nothing to do with this ticket.

I hesitate to set this to Positive Review since I really don't understand what it going on, but at least I have done something and reported what has happened.

> I have not checked all the logic in the revised code.

I don't think I have explained the issue that this ticket fixes very clearly (which was exposed when running one of the optional doctests without having the optional spkg installed). There are 2 main issues that caused this:

* When calling `CremonaDatabase('name')` the file `SAGE_ROOT/data/cremona/name.db` was being touched, something that is bad in general if the file wasn't there to start with.

* When calling `CremonaDatabase()`, to determine if the full database is installed, it would check for the existence of `SAGE_ROOT/data/cremona/cremona.db` rather than use one of the functions in `sage.misc` for this purpose.

With these combined, running the optional doctests would break the cremona database: it would run `CremonaDatabase('cremona')`, which would touch `SAGE_ROOT/data/cremona/cremona.db` and thus later calls of `CremonaDatabase()` would break since it would think the full cremona database was installed and try to use the touched file.

> I was puzzled by the remark about testing with flag --optional since I thought that only made sense with some sensible string after the word "optional", e.g. "magma".

Unless you want to test all optional packages (which could be useful for a giant system install -- unfortunately there are a few optional packages that don't want to build properly at the moment).

> But it seems that there are doctest lines which are tagged "# optional" with no mention of which optional package is relevant.

I consider this a bug and something that should be required for any optional tags.

The second patch (which includes the changes in the previous one) addresses the cases where there is a tag #optional in the code but no indication of which optional pakage is required, for the elliptic_curves directory only.

With sage-5.4.beta1 with no optional spkgs installed, all tests pass if -optional is not given, while if -optional is given then there are two failures in elliptic_curve/, both due to {{{database_cremona_ellcurve}} not being installed.  After installing that one optional spkg, all these pass.  That is as it should be.

Since I added to the patch it needs a second referee.
