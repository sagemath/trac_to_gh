Calling solve_left on a sparse integer matrix results in an instant segfault:

```
sage: A = identity_matrix(ZZ, 2, sparse=True)
sage: B = identity_matrix(ZZ, 2, sparse=True)
sage: A.solve_left(B)
/storage/masiao/sage-5.0.beta8/spkg/bin/sage: line 308:  7843 Segmentation fault      sage-ipython "$@" -i

We can push the bug a bit farther back:


```

sage: A = identity_matrix(ZZ, 2, sparse=True)
sage: B = identity_matrix(ZZ, 2, sparse=True)
sage: A.augment(B)
[1 0 1 0]
[0 1 0 1]
sage: A.change_ring(QQ).augment(B.change_ring(QQ))
[1 0 1 0]
[0 1 0 1]
sage: A.change_ring(QQ).augment(B)
[  1   0 1/0   0]
[  0   1   0 1/0]
```

1/0 doesn't look right..

Ah, okay.  I think I see what's going on.  In matrix_sparse.pyx's augment:

```

        cdef Matrix_sparse other = right.sparse_matrix()

    [...]

        if not (self._base_ring is right.base_ring()):
            right = right.change_ring(self._base_ring)
```

attemps to change the right base ring to agree, but during the insertion process, it still uses the old unchanged one:

```
        for i, j in right.nonzero_positions(copy=False):
            Z.set_unsafe(i, j + self._ncols, other.get_unsafe(i,j))
```

If we instead use

```

            other = other.change_ring(self._base_ring)
```

then everything seems to work:

```

sage: z = A.change_ring(QQ).augment(B)
[skipping debugging output]
sage: z
[1 0 1 0]
[0 1 0 1]
```

and 

```

sage: A.solve_left(B)
[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: parent(_)
Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 sparse matrices over Rational Field

```

So I think the fix is a one-liner.  Any takers?
