```
    def __cmp__(self, other):
        """
        EXAMPLES::

            sage: B4     = CartanType(['B', 4])

I just made a micro change to check that exchanging F4dual and B4dual inverses the sign.
If you are happy with it, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Thanks for fixing my tests!
