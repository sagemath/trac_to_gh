But whether `cmp()` outputs 1 or -1 is essentially arbitrary.  This must be fixed immediately.

Attachment: **[12793_type_dual_cmp.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12793/12793_type_dual_cmp.patch.gz)**

I just made a micro change to check that exchanging F4dual and B4dual inverses the sign.
If you are happy with it, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Thanks for fixing my tests!
