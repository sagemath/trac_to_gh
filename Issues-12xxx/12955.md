Title says it all. The point is that with the current implementation prevents categories to override those methods with something more interesting. Alas, the attached patch is not yet ready for consumption since there still remains finite (enumerated) sets in Sage that are not in FiniteSets of FiniteEnumeratedSets (see #12913 and #12957)

In the mean time, #12956 provides a workaround for `__getitem__`.
