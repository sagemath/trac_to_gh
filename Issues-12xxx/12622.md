See http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1191/memory-blowup-2 for the initial report.  Basically, Sage's interface to cliquer has a number of memory leaks:

1. in cliquer.pyx, graph_new is called several times without a corresponding graph_free.

2. The lists that are returned from the cliquer functions are not deallocated.

3. Inside the cliquer spkg, the cl.c file allocates lots of option structs through calls to `sage_init_clique_opt()`, but never deallocates them.

I'm not so sure about using sage_free to free memory allocated by cliquer's malloc.  Could that cause problems?

Anyways, the attached patch and the above changes make a *huge* difference in memory usage when calculating cliques over a large range of graphs.

Apparently this patch is ready to be reviewed, but has still a needs_work status. I tried it and it is working correctly (install, tests, docbuild,...).

However, I don't know how to evaluate the memory improvements. Could you provide an example ?
