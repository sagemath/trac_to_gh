**Problem**

There are many places in sage's spkg sources where inclusions are made with a filename which looks like ../../../../../whatever (no exageration: up to *five* levels!).

**Solution**
Those should be removed, and the right path added to the include line.


The first patch was obtained by running the attached script and the second one by hand-editing the remaining occurrences.

There are two problems with "../../../../.." :
1. it doesn't give any serious information, so why is it here?
2. the code is supposed to provide features ; it shouldn't worry about building.

It's better to have the build system provide ten "-I" flags than having a thousand places in the code where those ten paths are engraved, for maintainability reasons.

My plan was the following :
1. freshly unpack a sage-5.10.beta4 tarball ;
2. make build
3. apply the patches
4. ./sage -ba-force
5. make doc-html

now step 5 is to start from this sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec(sage.sets.disjoint_set.OP_represent).

I now determined how sage_getsource(sage.sets.disjoint_set.OP_represent) gets interpreted in sageinspect.py:
1. try to use the _sage_src_ method and raise an AttributeError, line 1552 (gets pass-ed)
2. try to use sage_getsourcelines, line 1556 and get None
3. after a test of the previous value, return None, line 1558

The problems turns into: why does sage_getsourcelines(sage.sets.disjoint_set.OP_represent) return None? Let's follow the trail again:
1. try to use the _sage_src_lines_ method and raise an AttributeError line 1783 (gets pass-ed)
2. is it a class instance, line 1791? No.
3. get a nice-looking doctring line 1802, except that the filename reads 'res_pyx.pxi'
4. try to use _extract_embedded_position on it... get to line 200... where the filename gets obtained by os.path.join(SAGE_SRC, res.group('FILENAME'))
5. from there, the rest is history: we have a wrong filename in a wrong path, so it's no surprise things get messy. 


So now I see two problems there: first, the only file with a name looking like this is sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures_pyx.pxi, and second, the way the full path is obtained from the filename looks too naive.

How can I debug the first problem?

"sage.sets.disjoint_set.OP_represent" is defined in sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures_pyx.pxi, and indeed at line 125 as I see in the docstring.
The line number is correct ; only the filename looks like it has been eaten.

The filename is already wrong in the Cythonized `disjoint_set.c`:

```
static char __pyx_doc_4sage_4sets_12disjoint_set_OP_represent[] = "File: pyx.pxi (starting at line 125)\n\n    Demonstration and testing.\n    \n    TESTS::\n\n        [...]        Done.\n\n    ";
```
So there is nothing in this ticket that is responsible for it.
