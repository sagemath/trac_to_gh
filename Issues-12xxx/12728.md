```
**Problem**

There are many places in sage's spkg sources where inclusions are made with a filename which looks like ../../../../../whatever (no exageration: up to *five* levels!).

**Solution**
Those should be removed, and the right path added to the include line.


The first patch was obtained by running the attached script and the second one by hand-editing the remaining occurrences.

There are two problems with "../../../../.." :
1. it doesn't give any serious information, so why is it here?
2. the code is supposed to provide features ; it shouldn't worry about building.

It's better to have the build system provide ten "-I" flags than having a thousand places in the code where those ten paths are engraved, for maintainability reasons.

Size of the patch is just a technical problem. It just makes it harder to find a problem if there is any but no more so than with just applying your script.

No, that's not needed.  But you should really explain **in the ticket description** which patches should be applied/which scripts should be run.

So you expect the release manager to read **all the comments** in **every** ticket just to know which patches should be applied?  That's not going to happen.

And even from reading the comments, it's not that clear that the shell script replaces the usual patch.

@vbraun: thanks ; it still doesn't look like a missing file, but at least it's a place I can start digging.

My plan was the following :
1. freshly unpack a sage-5.10.beta4 tarball ;
2. make build
3. apply the patches
4. ./sage -ba-force
5. make doc-html

now step 5 is to start from this sage.misc.sageinspect.sage_getargspec(sage.sets.disjoint_set.OP_represent).

I now determined how sage_getsource(sage.sets.disjoint_set.OP_represent) gets interpreted in sageinspect.py:
1. try to use the `_sage_src_` method and raise an AttributeError, line 1552 (gets pass-ed)
2. try to use sage_getsourcelines, line 1556 and get None
3. after a test of the previous value, return None, line 1558

The problems turns into: why does sage_getsourcelines(sage.sets.disjoint_set.OP_represent) return None? Let's follow the trail again:
1. try to use the `_sage_src_lines_` method and raise an AttributeError line 1783 (gets pass-ed)
2. is it a class instance, line 1791? No.
3. get a nice-looking doctring line 1802, except that the filename reads 'res_pyx.pxi'
4. try to use _extract_embedded_position on it... get to line 200... where the filename gets obtained by os.path.join(SAGE_SRC, res.group('FILENAME'))
5. from there, the rest is history: we have a wrong filename in a wrong path, so it's no surprise things get messy. 


So now I see two problems there: first, the only file with a name looking like this is sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures_pyx.pxi, and second, the way the full path is obtained from the filename looks too naive.

How can I debug the first problem?

"sage.sets.disjoint_set.OP_represent" is defined in sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures_pyx.pxi, and indeed at line 125 as I see in the docstring.
The line number is correct ; only the filename looks like it has been eaten.
