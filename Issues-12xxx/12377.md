This was reported by William in #11591. It still occurs with maxima-5.26:

```
sage: y=(x^2)*exp(x)/(1+exp(x))^2
sage: integrate(y,(x,-1000,1000))
...
;;;
;;; Stack overflow.
;;; Jumping to the outermost toplevel prompt

This bug also occurs in Maxima (on at least SBCL and ECL):

```
(%i1) y: (x^2)*exp(x)/(1+exp(x))^2$
(%i2) integrate(y,x,-1000,1000);
Maxima encountered a Lisp error:

 Control stack exhausted (no more space for function call frames).
```
so this looks like a straightforward bug in maxima.

For some reason this works now.

```
sage: integrate(y,(x,-1000,1000))
-2*((1000*log(e^1000 + 1) - polylog(2, -e^(-1000)) - 1000000)*e^1000 + 1000*log(e^1000 + 1) - polylog(2, -e^(-1000)) - 500000)/(e^1000 + 1) - 2*(1000*(e^1000 + 1)*log(e^1000 + 1) + (e^1000 + 1)*polylog(2, -e^1000) - 500000*e^1000)/(e^1000 + 1)
```
The Maxima overflows also seem to work now.
