isinstance may fail on a lazy imported class, which can cause hard to track history-dependent failures (just been hit: #12483)::

```
sage: lazy_import('sage.rings.rational_field', 'RationalField')
sage: isinstance(QQ, RationalField)
False
sage: isinstance(QQ, RationalField)
True
```

We fix this using the mechanism from [PEP 3119](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/).
