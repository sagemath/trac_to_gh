This used to work in older Sage versions.  And Schmidt lacks an h in the error message.

ps. Johan: you might find the following code snippet usefull:

```python
#this broke because of #10791
#G, _ = M.gram_schmidt()
#this is a workaround:
from sage.modules.misc import gram_schmidt
G, _ = gram_schmidt(list(M))
v = []

Thanks, Marten, for including me.

1.  I wouldn't trust the old code on `RealField(100)` (or much else for that matter).
2.  The QR decomposition for RDF/CDF matrices would be my alternate suggestion.  That's *only* 53-bit so that could be a downside if you need more precision.
3.  Or as Marten has suggested, all the old code is still available and unharmed if you want to take the extra step to import it.

Rob
