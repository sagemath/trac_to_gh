The way the code is structure makes it impossible to actually extract the information I need from cm_j_invariants_and_orders (I can't use it at all, except copy paste).    This suggest refactoring cm_j_invariants_and_orders.   Right now in the code it make that list , then uses it to get the CM j's, then throws away the list.
