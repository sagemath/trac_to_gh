From [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1395/how-can-i-view-the-poles-of-a-function-more-strong):

---

See the [source code](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/c239be1054e0/sage/plot/plot.py#l3377) (this is version 4.8).  

```
    pole_options = {}
    pole_options['linestyle'] = '--'
    pole_options['thickness'] = 1
    pole_options['rgbcolor'] = '#ccc'
```

Unfortunately, I think that the only way to **change** these options right now is to change it in your actual plot file!  You can go into your Sage installation's `devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py` file and search for these lines, and then just change them, start Sage with the command line option `sage -br` and hopefully a thicker line would be available.

Well, these should be configurable!  So this ticket is about making these accessible to all viewers.
