Looks like a simple type error somewhere.  Fails for integers, works for rationals:

```

sage: M
[ 2  2  2]
[ 0  0  0]
[-2 -2 -2]
sage: parent(M)
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Integer Ring
sage: M.jordan_form(transformation=True)
(
[0 1|0]            
[0 0|0]  [ 2  1  1]
[---+-]  [ 0  0  0]
[0 0|0], [-2  0 -1]
)
```

but

```
sage: (M/1).jordan_form(transformation=True)
(
[0 1|0]            
[0 0|0]  [ 2  1  0]
[---+-]  [ 0  0  1]
[0 0|0], [-2  0 -1]
)
sage: parent(M/1)
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Rational Field
sage: (M/1).jordan_form(transformation=True)
(
[0 1|0]            
[0 0|0]  [ 2  1  0]
[---+-]  [ 0  0  1]
[0 0|0], [-2  0 -1]
)
sage: J, P = (M/1).jordan_form(transformation=True)
sage: J == P**(-1)*M*P
True
```

Will see if I can track it down.

I can see what's going on, but I'm not sure what the best way to deal with it is.  For my part I'd probably simply push everything to the fraction field during the base_ring changes of jordan_form() in matrix2.pyx and work with vector spaces over the field instead of free modules over the ring, but not everyone might like that.


Comparing the differences between the code paths for ZZ and QQ, the first divergence seems to come in _jordan_form_vector_in_difference.  Both cases get V= [(1, 0, -1), (0, 1, -1)] and W = [(2, 0, -2), (1, 0, 0)], but in the integer case the resulting W_space is

```
W_space: Free module of degree 3 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 0 0]
[0 0 2]
```

i.e. a FreeModule_submodule_pid_with_category (not a FreeModule_submodule_field_with_category, as it would be in QQ) at which point Sage decides (reasonably enough) that (1, 0, -1) isn't in W_space. For comparison, the QQ case gives

```
W_space: Vector space of degree 3 and dimension 2 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
[1 0 0]
[0 0 1]
```

and it returns (0, 1, -1) instead.  

Good news is that whatever we decide to do should be straightforward.

Working over QQ (or, in general, over the fraction field) seems fine to me.  Basically, though, I am not knowledgeable enough to have an opinion.

I cannot see how this routine should be guaranteed to succeed over a ring that is not a field.  And eventually we need to factor the characteristic polynomial over the ring anyway.

So I see no harm into moving to the fraction field now and if there **is** a way to do this over a ring, another patch can attempt that.
