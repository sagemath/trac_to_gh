With the default compiler in XCode 4, OS X Lion, the symmetrica spkg apparently builds successfully and passes self-tests, but the file `devel/sage/sage/libs/symmetrica/schur.pxi` fails doctests: it hangs and times out.

The spkg here checks for /usr/bin/gcc-4.2.  If present, it uses it; otherwise, it turns off optimization when compiling.
