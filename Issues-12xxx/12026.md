```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, 8, lambda i, j: 1/(i + j + 1))
sage: f = A.charpoly()
sage: f.degree()
8
sage: f.is_squarefree()   # so f must have 8 roots over the algebraic closure.
True
sage: len(f.roots(QQbar))      # VERY BAD
7
```
At least the roots that are found are really roots:

```
sage: [f(a[0])==0 for a in f.roots(QQbar)]
[True, True, True, True, True, True, True]
```

I prefer to put two colons for several reasons:  (1) consistency, (2) if somebody adds a new example above mine with just an example (and no text) it will just work, and (3) it works just fine as I did it -- see http://wstein.org/home/wstein/tmp/a.png

Jeroen has a good point - this is technically incorrect ReST:

```
fs@zhenghe /tmp $ cat test.rst
Check out this literal block::

Ha, gotcha
fs@zhenghe /tmp $ python -c "from docutils.core import publish_string ; print publish_string(open('test.rst').read())"
<string>:3: (WARNING/2) Literal block expected; none found.
<document source="<string>">

    <system_message level="2" line="3" source="<string>" type="WARNING">
        <paragraph>
            Literal block expected; none found.
    <paragraph>
        Ha, gotcha

fs@zhenghe /tmp $ 
```

This brings (3) into question. I don't see what you mean by (1). (2) is certainly true but that's not a good reason to use incorrect syntax, IMO. I'll attach a reviewer patch.
