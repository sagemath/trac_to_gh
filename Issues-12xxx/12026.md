sage: A = matrix(QQ, 8, lambda i, j: 1/(i + j + 1))
sage: f = A.charpoly()
sage: f.degree()
8
sage: f.is_squarefree()   # so f must have 8 roots over the algebraic closure.
True
sage: len(f.roots(QQbar))      # VERY BAD
7
```
At least the roots that are found are really roots:

```
sage: [f(a[0])==0 for a in f.roots(QQbar)]
[True, True, True, True, True, True, True]
```

I prefer to put two colons for several reasons:  (1) consistency, (2) if somebody adds a new example above mine with just an example (and no text) it will just work, and (3) it works just fine as I did it -- see http://wstein.org/home/wstein/tmp/a.png
