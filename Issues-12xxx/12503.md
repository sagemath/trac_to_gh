# Issue 12503: Convenient history fetch commands

Using Sage, you are missing a feature of the Magma command line interface. In Magma, if you enter a line found in history using up arrow key and then press down arrow key, then the next line in history is fetched. This feature allows you to fetch as many successive lines in history as you like. However, Sage does not have a similar feature. The  IPython command prompt uses the readline library (via pyreadline), which evidently does not support this feature. Magma has its own custom “readline-like” library, which does support this feature. (Since so many people have requested this feature, if anybody can figure out how to implement it, then such an implementation would certainly be welcome!)

This ticket addresses the above implementation.

Yes. I created this because I found no way to trigger the patchbot for the patch in #10289. I hope the patchbot works for this duplicate ticket.

I will add a comment on #10289 right now.

    "body": "<a id='comment:15'></a>\nI tried using this a few times before but could never bind it to Control-o so I gave up.  I have an `inputrc` file and several other customizations that I thought might be interfering, but could never figure it out.  Today I finally took the time and so I'm putting it here in case others have the same problem.  Below is what happens as best I understand it.  I'm on OS X 10.6.\n\nBefore readline gets a character sequence it's interpreted by the terminal emulator and can be used to do things like turn flow control on and off.  These are generally bound to Control-s and Control-q and is, I think, fairly well known (at least I knew it).  However, there are other actions as well which can be determined by running `stty -a` and reading the `cchars` section.  In my case control-o was bound to discard.

I tried using this a few times before but could never bind it to Control-o so I gave up.  I have an `inputrc` file and several other customizations that I thought might be interfering, but could never figure it out.  Today I finally took the time and so I'm putting it here in case others have the same problem.  Below is what happens as best I understand it.  I'm on OS X 10.6.

Before readline gets a character sequence it's interpreted by the terminal emulator and can be used to do things like turn flow control on and off.  These are generally bound to Control-s and Control-q and is, I think, fairly well known (at least I knew it).  However, there are other actions as well which can be determined by running `stty -a` and reading the `cchars` section.  In my case control-o was bound to discard.  These extra bindings can be turned of by running 

```
# Enable Ctrl-o
stty -iexten
# Enable Ctrl-s and Ctrl-q
stty -ixon
```
or by unbinding them individually like

```
stty discard undef
...
```

Did you add the relevant lines into the "ipythonrc" as indicated in the documentation? You don't modify `inputrc` file in your home folder.

```
To bind these commands with keys, insert the relevant lines into the ``$DOT_SAGE/ipython/ipythonrc``
file. Note that ``$DOT_SAGE`` is ``$HOME/.sage`` by default. For example,

::

    readline_parse_and_bind "\C-o": operate-and-get-next
    readline_parse_and_bind "\e[A": history-search-backward-and-save
    readline_parse_and_bind "\e[B": history-search-forward-and-save

binds the three commands with the control-o key, the up arrow key, and the down arrow key,
respectively.           
```

This patch does not chanage anything before you put some relevant lines to the "ipythonrc" file in your dot_sage folder.
