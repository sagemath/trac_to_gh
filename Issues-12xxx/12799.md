Actually only the `pbori` module needs to get rebuilt; while touching `$SAGE_LOCAL/include/polybori.h` doesn't help, touching `$SAGE_LOCAL/include/polybori/*` does (afterwards running `./sage -b`).

The better alternative is to fix the dependency list in `module_list.py`

As mentioned on #12655, I'd rather make the extension module depend on just `$SAGE_INC/polybori.h` and/or its libraries, `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/{polybori,polybori_groebner}.so`, and `touch` the former from `spkg-install` at least in case you don't add the libraries.

AFAIK Cython is smart enough to notice when (at least *directly*) included headers are newer, but this doesn't help if their timestamps are preserved during PolyBoRi's installation.

Adding *all of* PolyBoRi's headers *explicitly* seems a bit overkill to me.

[Also note that we have both `$SAGE_INC/polybori.h` and `$SAGE_INC/polybori/polybori.h`, which are not the same files.]

The timestamp of `include/polybori/config.h` also varies, this would also help here.

The first header is just for convenience.
