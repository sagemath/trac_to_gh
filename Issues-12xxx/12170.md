Following my the discussion on sage-devel this adds genus() function to the `FunctionField` class, to compute the genus of the function field using singular.

It is not as fast as magma but it is at least a first step.

if we have:

kx.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
kxY.<Y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)

kxY._singular_ should be k(x)[Y] (which is what this code generates) however, singular only computes the genus of an ideal of k[x][Y] ring. So, I have to generate a tmpR = k[x][Y] each time I need to compute the genus. Maybe it's worth it to add __singular_deg2_ private object to store this ring as well. 

Also, it makes sense to store the genus in __genus. But I'm not sure how should I check it's validity. Can the defining polynomial of the function field change after its creation. If not then we can set __genus = -1 and if it's non-negative then it's valid.

Well if we are going to cache the genus computation then this won't be needed.

You should look at the documentation of cached_method on how to do this. It would be indeed some function ideal for caching since it's answer takes a while to compute while it takes only a small integer to store it. 

Note that you can change the defining polynomial (because you have to go trough a lot of trouble to make python objects immutable). But you are safe to assume that the defining polynomial doesn't change. In fact the current code already assumes that as shown below.

```
sage: K.<x>=FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<y>=K[]
sage: L=K.extension(y^3+y*x+x)
sage: L
Function field in y defined by y^3 + x*y + x
sage: L.__init__(y^3+x,'y')
sage: L
Function field in y defined by y^3 + x
sage: K.extension(y^3+y*x+x)
Function field in y defined by y^3 + x
```

I'm surprised myself but singular does not complain about fractions:

```
sage: singular.ideal('y^5 - (x^3 + 2*x*y + 1/x)')
-x^3-2*x*y+y^5
sage: singular.eval('1/x')
0
```

The 1/x was just thrown out because in singular it evaluates to 0. Anyway I think you're maybe doing too many direct calls to singular. Why not go to the polynomial ring QQ[x,y] create the ideal there get its singular object and determine the genus in singular? Or maybe I misunderstand what the genus function in singular does.

Also, is_RationalFunctionField() should imho be a member method is_rational() of FunctionField that is overwritten in RationalFunctionField and FunctionField_polymod.

This is why the function is called "is_RationalFunctionField()". This is because it does not check if (mathematically) the function field is rational, but it checks, if it is (programatically) of RationalFunctionField type. I need that because (AFAIUnderstood the manual) when I ask Singular to create a ring of k(t)[y] form, singular expects that k be a prime field (you only get to give the characteristic). so I can not accept k(x)[y]/(y^2 - x) for my purpose:

```
sage: singular.eval('ring r = (7^2,a,b),(x,y,z),dp;')

    575
    576         if get_verbose() > 0:

RuntimeError: Singular error:

   ? cannot make ring
   ? error occurred in or before STDIN line 41: `ring r = (7^2,a,b),(x,y,z),dp;`
   ? expected ring-expression. type 'help ring;'

```


So, I'm OK with making it a method of FunctionField class but I think we should keep the name. We can have an additional method of "is_rational()" if you like (which will involve computing the genus).

What I needed was the type check, but because I wanted to follow is_FunctionField line by line and that there's no category of RationalFunctionFields I thought that this is the closest approximation.

```
  	973	    if (x in FunctionFields()): 
  	974	        return x == x.base_field() 
  	975	    else: 
```
Saying that, I do not think that I can come up with such an example because I do not know how the members of FunctionFields category which are not of FunctionField type looks like, I even do not know if they have base_field() method or not (David Roe told me last week that categorical parenthood does not implies OOP parenthood), and if not, the code will generate an error. So, I think we should get rid of these three lines instead.

There's a method `_make_monic_integral()` that seems to do just that.
