**New:**
- 2012-07-05: added basis projection plotting
- Now there are two distinct methods ``rauzy_fractal_plot`` and ``rauzy_fractal_points``.
- Translated copies of the fractal and its pieces can be plotted, allowing all kinds of tiling plots.
- Error message in the case where the eigenvalue is of degree one.
- New patch for version 5.0.1 (but doesn't apply with the bot for some reason).
- A few other things.

From the docstring:

Returns a plot of the Rauzy fractal associated with a substitution.
The substitution does not have to be irreducible.
The definition used can be found found for example in [1].
The usual definition of a Rauzy fractal requires that
its dominant eigenvalue is a Pisot number. The present method
doesn't require this, allowing to plot some interesting pictures
in the non-Pisot case (see the examples below).

Plots with less than 100,000 points take a few seconds,
and several millions of points can be plotted in reasonable time.

Maybe because of trailing whitespaces ?

The log says :

Helloooooooo !!!

The tests do not pass, and the reason why you do not see it is that to actually test your patch you need both -optional and -long flags.

Actually, only a -long flag should be needed here (by removing the keyword 'optional' from the commented lines), shouldn'it ?

Hello,

Nice, all tests pass. The documentation is clear and the examples very interesting.

1) For the construction of colors, there is a built in functions "rainbow" in sage.plot.colors (you can call it with 'rgbtuple' option).

2) You should never use an error catch (try ... except ...) which catches all errors. The way you did, it would be impossible to send a stop signal to the process using C-c. You have to write something like

try:
  blabla
except TypeError,ValueError:
  pass

where the tuple of errors you use is the one which may be raised by the code in blabla. Errors may be produced from other part of the code and you should not intercept them!

2') The loop you use for finding a fixed point (actually a periodic point) is very dirty!! You should be able to compute the smallest k for which sigma**k(0) starts with 0...  For example you can build the substitution tau which sends alpha to the first letter (or last if reversal) of sigma(alpha). And then, you can search for a cycle of tau which gives you periodic points. The best way would be to add a method in WordMorphism which does it for you... (perhaps an other ticket).

Next to come. If you like I can implement 2') in another ticket ?

Yes, I'm aware of the rainbow function, but colormaps offers many color schemes and it works fine, so I used it.

Yes, indeed this is not very clean and I should have done otherwise... Yes you can implement 2') if you want! (Maybe we could add an option in the .fixed_point that forces to return a fixed point of the substitution (or a power), because it's annoying to have to trick with substitution which don't have a "true" fixed point.)

I see. Your way is definitely better.

> > 2) and 2')


It is now #12512. Could you replace your loop with either

```
u = iter(self.periodic_point(letter))
```
where letter is a parameter, or

```
u = iter(self.periodic_points()[0][0])
```

3) Why did you choose 1000 for the precision of the complex field ? It seems a little bit big for your purpose. Won't you make it a parameter (with a reasonable default value) ?

4) Why do you assume that the root is cubic ? On one hand, if they are ordered as |l_1| > |l_2| > 1 > |l_3| then you will get a strange Rauzy fractal, won't you ? On the other hand, I have examples for which the absolute values of eigenvalues are ordered as |l_1| > |l_2| > 1 > |l_3| > |l_4|. Then you can obtain a Rauzy fractal after a projection parallel to v_1 and v_2 on the plane generated by v_3 and v_4 (where v_i is an eigenvector associated to l_i). In other words, I'm a little bit confused with your restrictions.

Otherwise, everything is very nice. You should now write a tutorial with both methods for drawing Rauzy fractals with nice pictures and put it in the documentation ;-)

Testing the file `morphism.py` now takes way more time than before.

I am ready to give positive review provided the three following things are satisfied :

- doctest timing do not take too much longer than before
- documentation issue are fixed (done in my first review patch)
- method `rauzy_fractal_points` is split into two (done in my second review patch)

... and of course if Timo and others agree with my patches.

Indeed,

1. Testing the file `morphism.py` now takes way more time than before. I think `sage -t sage_library_file.py` should run in 10s and `sage -t -long -optional sage_library_file.py` in no more than 40 seconds (these are my standards, I don't know if there exist any in the Sage Developper Guide). Instead of drawing 10000 points, you can draw 100 points for the doctests. If you want to keep those doctests interesting for the user, you may add `#not tested takes > 3 seconds`. Or, you can add a remark at the beginning of the examples saying the value `n=100` below is low for doctests purposes, larger values of n can be given by the user. 

BEFORE:

```
 $ sage-5.2.rc0 -t morphism.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/words/morphism.py"  
	 [4.4 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.4 seconds
 $ sage-5.2.rc0 -t -long -optional morphism.py 
sage -t -long -optional "devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/words/morphism.py"
	 [6.6 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 6.6 seconds
```

AFTER:

```
 $ sage-5.2.rc0 -t morphism.py 
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/words/morphism.py"  
	 [30.4 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 30.4 seconds

$ sage-5.2.rc0 -t -long -optional morphism.py 
sage -t -long -optional "devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/words/morphism.py"
	 [255.9 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 256.0 seconds
```

2. I uploaded two patches which applies on top of Timo's one. The first fixes some documentation issues. 

3. The second patch splits the method `rauzy_fractal_points` into two. As I already explained verbaly to Timo, I dislike the idea of having output types (dict vs 2-tuple of dict) depending on the input. Instead I propose to split the method into two and doing it made me realize that the second output only depends on two of the inputs. So, now the user can obtain this output without generating points and by providing only the necessary two inputs.

Hi,

Thanks for the corrections which I find useful and clarifying.

I strongly improved the testing time and pointed (another time) the details of the construction to a reference in the doc.
