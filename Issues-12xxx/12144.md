Assignee: amhou

I was reading the Continuous Hidden Markov Model code and trying to understand how probabilities are defined in a certain context, and got confused.   So I added some comments to de-confuse me.  Hence this patch.  

There is small change in the code itself, where I had checked for "0" instead of checking for smaller than min_sd in one line.   This makes the code (1) work much better with actual real world examples, and (2) is consistent with the old ghmm C library from sage-3.x that this code was supposed to replace. 

See all #12146 for feature enhancements.

Thanks for the doc clarifications, and the math changes make sense, though I'm certainly not a HMM expert, so I don't know how to judge the idea that the changes are more useful.  However, it does apply and passes tests, so if this "review" is enough, set this to positive review.
