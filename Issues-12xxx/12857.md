The file `sage/plot/plot.py` is getting huge.  One consequence is that doctesting this file (without `--long`) takes double the time of any other file.  **blocker** because it regularly causes doctest timeouts.

The following will be moved to a new file `graphics.py`:
1. class `Graphics`
2. class `GraphicsArray`
3. def `show_default`
4. def `is_Graphics`

A few doctests consistently taking at least 2 seconds on `sage.math` have been marked `# long time`.

Before this patch on `sage.math`:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py"
         [133.6 s]
```

After this patch on `sage.math`:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/graphics.py"
         [51.5 s]
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py"
         [67.9 s]
```

The patch was created by first *copying* `plot.py` to `graphics.py` and then
removing the duplicate code in either `plot.py` or `graphics.py`.

The patch applies cleanly to 5.0.beta12 and all tests pass on `sage/plot/*.py`. I also looked through the live documentation in the 2d/3d graphics sections and everything looks good to me. I didn't look for broken links, though.

Shouldn't it be necessary to issue a deprecation warning for at least a few Sage releases before we change the location of something?  If I understand correctly, this patch will break all uses of `sage.plot.plot.Graphics`.  To me, this seems like a bad idea for 5.0.  Doing `search_src('plot.Graphics')` brings up a few more places `Graphics` and `GraphicsArray` are used in this way, but not addressed by this patch.  For example, `graphs/graph_generators.py` and `shemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py`.

I'm switching this to "needs info", and someone can overrule me if there is good reason to skip the deprecation process for this ticket.

Yes ! There is an option "--warn-links" to docbuild recently added by #9128.

I didn't yet check the documentation but I've a small reviewer patch which silent `sage -coverage`.

The new uploaded patch should adress you comments.

I agree with @jhpalmieri. I've looked over the patch again and the reviewer patch. This gets a positive review from me. I'm running a patchbot to check the doctests again. It's pending.

It is not a "contrived problem".  It is a real issue happening in practice.

If somebody comes up with a different solution to these timeouts, that's fine for me.  I just think that the timeouts should be fixed in sage-5.0 and splitting `plot.py` seemed a reasonable solution.

Okay, I'm just glad there was some good discussion on this, and with several more eyes this seems reasonable.  I'm not suggesting at all that there is anything wrong with the patch, just that we have been hit in the past by unintended moving of things.
