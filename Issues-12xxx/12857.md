The file `sage/plot/plot.py` is getting huge.  One consequence is that doctesting this file (without `--long`) takes double the time of any other file.  **blocker** because it regularly causes doctest timeouts.

The following will be moved to a new file `graphics.py`:
1. class `Graphics`
2. class `GraphicsArray`
3. def `show_default`
4. def `is_Graphics`

A few doctests consistently taking at least 2 seconds on `sage.math` have been marked `# long time`.

Before this patch on `sage.math`:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py"
         [133.6 s]
```

After this patch on `sage.math`:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/graphics.py"
         [51.5 s]
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py"
         [67.9 s]
```

The patch was created by first *copying* `plot.py` to `graphics.py` and then
removing the duplicate code in either `plot.py` or `graphics.py`.

The UNABLE TO IMPORT MODULE seems like a Sphinx bug, or a bug in how Sage calls Sphinx.

I did a diff of the old and new documentation and, as far as I could see, all links still work.  Needs review.

Shouldn't it be necessary to issue a deprecation warning for at least a few Sage releases before we change the location of something?  If I understand correctly, this patch will break all uses of `sage.plot.plot.Graphics`.  To me, this seems like a bad idea for 5.0.  Doing `search_src('plot.Graphics')` brings up a few more places `Graphics` and `GraphicsArray` are used in this way, but not addressed by this patch.  For example, `graphs/graph_generators.py` and `shemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py`.

I'm switching this to "needs info", and someone can overrule me if there is good reason to skip the deprecation process for this ticket.

Yes ! There is an option "--warn-links" to docbuild recently added by #9128.

I didn't yet check the documentation but I've a small reviewer patch which silent `sage -coverage`.

It is not a "contrived problem".  It is a real issue happening in practice.

If somebody comes up with a different solution to these timeouts, that's fine for me.  I just think that the timeouts should be fixed in sage-5.0 and splitting `plot.py` seemed a reasonable solution.
