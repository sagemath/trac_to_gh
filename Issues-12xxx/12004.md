The following Sage program quickly explodes memory usage:

```
P = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="Coin")
P.add_constraint(P[0]+P[1]==1)
while True:
  P = copy(P)
  w = solve(P)
```

Depends on #12220

Ohhhhhh !! Now I remember why there is this solver="GLPK" where it shouldn't be, inside of the code ! It's because three lines later the ``_backend`` variable is overwritten anyway :

```
p._backend = (<GenericBackend> self._backend).copy()
```

So the solver used by the copy of the MILP will indeed be the same as the current solver, and all is well under the sun. Now, for some reason the bug could come from the fact that even though the p._backend is overwritten, the former object is not freed. Would a del p._backend just before the assigning a new value to p._backend solve the problem ? `:-)`

I had tried something like this, but Cython complains:

```
sage/numerical/mip.pyx:281:13: Cannot delete C attribute of extension type
```
Is there a command that lets me delete the backend? I can see that there is a command that is commented out, `void del_OsiCbcSolverInterface...`, but I haven't yet figured out whether I should uncomment or use that.

FWIW, I'm fairly convinced that initializing with the GLPK backend is not the problem. I tried the following modifications:

* change `__init__` in MixedIntegerLinearProgram so that `solver==None` actually gives *no* backend, not the GLPK backend;
* in `__copy__`, initialize with `solver==None`.

I know it is a bad, bad idea to change the behavior of an initializer this way, but I thought it would give unequivocal evidence. I've changed my version back.

Indeed, **even in this case**, copying a Coin solver consumes enormous memory. It seems easier to break out of the loop, though. In fact, within 15 loops it consumes 1.6GB RAM. That's not a typo: only 15!!! `8-0`

So the problem really does lie elsewhere.

Did you add a "print 'Hey'" in the `__dealloc__` method of the COIN backend, just to see whether the backends are really removed each time you overwrite the value of P ?

No, but I tried it now, and the backends really are removed: I get a "hey" with every `copy`.

In addition, the explosion in memory occurs regardless of whether we add constraints or not. You could simply run `P = copy(P)` several times, and memory usage jumps up.

I was afraid of that.

I tried it (`import gc; gc.get_referents(P)`). It isn't really helpful.

I also tried the following: instead of calling the copy constructor, I called the clone method. I'm referring to this function in `OsiCbcSolverInterface.hpp`:

```
virtual OsiSolverInterface * clone(bool copyData = true) const;
```
That required modifying the `.pxd` file, of course. I got it to compile & run, but the memory problems persist. Still chugging away at this...

I figured out how to implement the copy constructor: in the .pxd file, declare under `cdef cppclass c_OsiCbcSolverInterface "OsiCbcSolverInterface"`

```
  c_OsiCbcSolverInterface(c_OsiCbcSolverInterface &si)
```
In the .pyx file, I then call

```
        p.si = new c_OsiCbcSolverInterface(<c_OsiCbcSolverInterface>self.si)
```
It runs, but we still get exponential growth of memory.

I'm running out of ideas here. Do you have a copy of the Coin source, and can you see if there is exponential growth if we do the same thing there?

Hello again !

Did you try copying several times the line p.si = new [...] ? This way, each time you do a copy() in Sage the COIN interface actually does several of them, if the memory explodes faster you will be sure it comes from their code !

On my computer I am having some trouble installing CBC right now `^^;`

Here's what I tried. In `coin_backend.copy` I changed line 990,

```
p.si = new c_OsiCbcSolverInterface(<OsiSolverInterface *> self.si)
```
to

```
for each in xrange(20): p.si = new c_OsiCbcSolverInterface(<OsiSolverInterface *> self.si)
```
That gave me no problems.

Then I changed it to two lines:

```
p.si = new c_OsiCbcSolverInterface(<OsiSolverInterface *> self.si)
for each in xrange(20): p.si = new c_OsiCbcSolverInterface(<OsiSolverInterface *> p.si)
```
and quickly regretted it!

So, it looks as if that's the problem.

I have successfully replicated the problem in C++ directly, using the following short program:

```
#include "include/coin/OsiCbcSolverInterface.hpp"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  OsiCbcSolverInterface * si = new OsiCbcSolverInterface(NULL);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 13; i++) {
    printf("%d ", i);
    si = new OsiCbcSolverInterface(si);
  }
  printf("\n");
  
  while (true) {}
  
  delete si;
}
```
An enormous amount of memory is consumed thereby. Since it's possible that this has already been resolved upstream, I will test with the latest version of Coin (2.7.5) in a moment.

Upstream replies pretty quickly, once you get the right mailing list. `:-)`

  > I may be wrong but in my experience OsiCbcSolverInterface has several problems and should not be used. If your problem is a linear program, you should use OsiClpSolverInterface instead. Once you load the problem in an object of class OsiClpSolverInterface, you can use the clone() method to obtain copies.

I can verify that modifying the test program above in this way means we can clone without an exponential memory leak:

```
#include "include/coin/OsiClpSolverInterface.hpp"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  OsiClpSolverInterface * si = new OsiClpSolverInterface();
  OsiClpSolverInterface * newsi;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 13; i++) {
    printf("%d ", i);
    newsi = dynamic_cast <OsiClpSolverInterface *>((*si).clone());
    delete si;
    si = newsi;
  }
  printf("\n");
  
  while (true) {}
  
}
```
(FWIW putting `newsi = ...; delete si; si = newsi;` didn't affect the previous version of the code, either.)

So, now I have a question. Is there a reason we're using the `OsiCbcSolverInterface` instead of the `OsiClpSolverInterface`? or is it okay to switch interfaces?

John reported the bug upstream, they acknowledge it is a bug and do not intend to fix it `:-D`

The reason is that the C++ class that is currently use to deal with Coin is "a mistake" according to the developpers. Anyway the package will eventually be upgraded by #12220, and the rewriting that it will require should solve this bug along.
