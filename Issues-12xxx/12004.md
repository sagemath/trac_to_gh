The following Sage program quickly explodes memory usage:

```
P = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="Coin")
P.add_constraint(P[0]+P[1]==1)
while True:
  P = copy(P)
  w = solve(P)
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>Ohhhhhh !! Now I remember why there is this solver="GLPK" where it shouldn't be, inside of the code ! It's because three lines later the ``_backend`` variable is overwritten anyway :

```
p._backend = (<GenericBackend> self._backend).copy()
```

So the solver used by the copy of the MILP will indeed be the same as the current solver, and all is well under the sun. Now, for some reason the bug could come from the fact that even though the p._backend is overwritten, the former object is not freed. Would a del p._backend just before the assigning a new value to p._backend solve the problem ? `:-)`

I had tried something like this, but Cython complains:

```
sage/numerical/mip.pyx:281:13: Cannot delete C attribute of extension type
```
Is there a command that lets me delete the backend? I can see that there is a command that is commented out, `void del_OsiCbcSolverInterface...`, but I haven't yet figured out whether I should uncomment or use that.

So the problem really does lie elsewhere.

No, but I tried it now, and the backends really are removed: I get a "hey" with every `copy`.

In addition, the explosion in memory occurs regardless of whether we add constraints or not. You could simply run `P = copy(P)` several times, and memory usage jumps up.

I was afraid of that.

I tried it (`import gc; gc.get_referents(P)`). It isn't really helpful.

I also tried the following: instead of calling the copy constructor, I called the clone method. I'm referring to this function in `OsiCbcSolverInterface.hpp`:

```
virtual OsiSolverInterface * clone(bool copyData = true) const;
```
That required modifying the `.pxd` file, of course. I got it to compile & run, but the memory problems persist. Still chugging away at this...

Then I changed it to two lines:

and quickly regretted it!

So, it looks as if that's the problem.

<a id='comment:17'></a>Hmmm.... So the issue is to "report upstream" ?

Once you load the problem in an object of class OsiClpSolverInterface, you can use the clone() method to obtain copies.

I can verify that modifying the test program above in this way means we can clone without an exponential memory leak:

```
#include "include/coin/OsiClpSolverInterface.hpp"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  OsiClpSolverInterface * si = new OsiClpSolverInterface();
  OsiClpSolverInterface * newsi;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 13; i++) {
    printf("%d ", i);
    newsi = dynamic_cast <OsiClpSolverInterface *>((*si).clone());
    delete si;
    si = newsi;
  }
  printf("\n");
  
  while (true) {}
  
}
```
(FWIW putting `newsi = ...; delete si; si = newsi;` didn't affect the previous version of the code, either.)

So, now I have a question. Is there a reason we're using the `OsiCbcSolverInterface` instead of the `OsiClpSolverInterface`? or is it okay to switch interfaces?

The reason is that the C++ class that is currently use to deal with Coin is "a mistake" according to the developpers. Anyway the package will eventually be upgraded by #12220, and the rewriting that it will require should solve this bug along.
