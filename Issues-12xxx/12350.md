With sage-4.7.2, I get

```
sage: m = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->ba')
sage: w = m.fixed_point('a')
sage: pref = w[:50]
sage: pref.palindromes()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: generator already executing
```

I found the problem and realized that it does work on a clean sage-4.7.2:

```
sage: m = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->ba')
sage: w = m.fixed_point('a')
sage: pref = w[:50]
sage: pref.palindromes()
sage: s = pref.palindromes()
sage: type(s)
<type 'set'>
sage: len(s)
39
```

Works for me as well on `5.5.rc0`:

```
sage: m = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->ba')
sage: w = m.fixed_point('a')
sage: pref = w[:50]
sage: pref.palindromes()
set([word: bbaabbabaabbaababbaabb, ...
