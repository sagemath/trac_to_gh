Implementation of the poset of alternating sign matrices

This is best done by implementing a bijection to monotone triangles (or contre tableaux). This was already done in MuPAD

http://mupad-combinat.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mupad-combinat/trunk/MuPAD-Combinat/lib/COMBINAT/alternatingSignMatrices.mu?view=log

One way of the bijection is already implemented::

```
  sage: import sage.combinat.alternating_sign_matrix as asm
        sage: asm.from_contre_tableau([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1]])
        [0 0 1]
        [0 1 0]
        [1 0 0]
        sage: asm.from_contre_tableau([[1, 2, 3], [2, 3], [3]])
        [1 0 0]
        [0 1 0]
        [0 0 1]
```

It remains to implement the reverse bijection, and the ASM lattice from the ContreTableaux lattice.

I have implemented the reverse bijection under the name "to_contre_tableau"

I have also implemented the lattice, but only for alternating sign matrices, because contre-tableau are not hashable.

```

- Since to_monotone_triangle and from_montone_triangle are inverses of each other you could add some tests as follows:

```
    sage: T = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1]]
    sage: asm.to_monotone_triangle(asm.from_monotone_triangle(T)) == T
    True
```

- Please add Examples to class AlternatingSignMatrices(Parent) below line 87. In fact I would suggest to add EXAMPLES to all of your classes so that the user knows how to use them!

- Please use a line break on line 111 of your patch so that it is easier to read.

- Line 180 of your patch it says "Return a couple to use in argument of ``Poset``. " Do you mean tuple instead of couple? Please add an EXAMPLES:: here so it is clear what the method does. A similar sentence appears in line 363.

- As Frederic also mentioned, in line 282 you might want to use Lattice instead of Poset.

- After line 324, please add an empty line.

- After line 374 the TESTS are missing!

- I would suggest to reuse all the doctests in the code that you are deleting since you want your new code to give the same answers as before. For example, I do not see the more systematic test such as

```
     sage: [ AlternatingSignMatrices(n).cardinality() for n in range(0, 11)]
     [1, 1, 2, 7, 42, 429, 7436, 218348, 10850216, 911835460, 129534272700] 
```

But please reuse all of it in the appropriate places.

- I think if you are removing code or renaming methods, you first need to "deprecate them" for one release cycle.

So much for now. Impressive work for a first patch!

Anne

Thanks for pointing those things out, Anne.

The failure you get with 'sage -t' is due to something weird about doctesting (cf #10458, you can't use multi-line tests due to some formattings by the IPython interactive shell). But removing this, I get a ton of others doctest failure : i'm working on it.

I notably get some failure about the tests which passed for the implementation with CombinatorialClass because of the inherited methods like first(), last() or random_element(). By dropping out the inheritance in favor of Parent, we loose those kind of methods. However, the implementations of those are naive and do not bring any improvement in comparison with a user's straightforward implementation.
For example, this is last() :

```
for i in self: 
    pass
return i
```

So I'm wondering about the usefulness of the reimplementation of those methods. Maybe can we skip them ?
In fact, this is the only removing/renaming code (that we have to 'deprecate' so, but maybe as the CombinatorialClass level directly). For the rest, I kept by default all the old implementation and allowed mine by keyword option. For example :

```
A = AlternatingSignMatrices(4) #inner implementation uses contre-tableaux as before
A = AlternatingSignMatrices(4, use_monotone_triangles=True) #inner implementation uses monotone triangles as it should
```

Remark that some methods assert the use of monotone triangles (like lattice()).


I noticed also that EXAMPLES and TESTS are checked by 'sage -t' : is there a real difference between them ?

Pierre

Hi Pierre,

Could you point me to the line in your code? I think if you use

```
    ...
```
instead of 

```
    ...:
```
it should work.

I noticed that sometimes you do not repeat a definition (for example of A) from one doctest to the next. Is this the problem when you remove the offending doctest?

Most likely skipping them is ok. Perhaps confirm this with Nicolas.

Don't we want to get rid of the name contre-tableaux at some point? I was thinking of deprecating that name, so that at some point there would only be monotone_triangles.

> I noticed also that EXAMPLES and TESTS are checked by 'sage -t' : is there a real difference between them ?


Yes, both are tested. For myself, I usually use EXAMPLES if these are tests that are also useful for the user to read to understand how the code is used. TESTS is for internal tests like in `__init__` or something like this or corner cases that need to be checked, but not necessarily read.

Best wishes,

Anne

Yes, that is the trick explained in #10458. But this is definitely something to fix : we want to be able to copy/paste our tests from the sage shell.

Well, yes. I was just thinking about compatibility with older code. But I can switch to monotone triangles only (or at least default) and go through a deprecation cycle.

Hi!

I just posted a slightly revised patch with some extra doctests and some clean-up in the documentation.

Please deprecate the old contre_tableaux methods and classes. Other than that, the patch seems to be finished.
