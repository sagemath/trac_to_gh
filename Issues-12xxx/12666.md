As much as I understand, for building GCC with "graphite" one needs `CLooG-PPL` (the Chunky Loop Generator) being installed. Note that `CLooG` plus PPL seems not to be enough

Hence, I suggest to have an optional spkg. At least on openSuse, the straight forward way to make an spkg (no patches, and an spkg-install and spkg-check that just to `./configure --prefix...`, `make`, `make install` and  `make check`) seems to work.

This is related with #12369, and depends on #12672.

It turns out that the gcc package from #12369 can not use this cloog package.

I am not sure whether this is because of wrong sources (there seems to be a difference between cloog and cloog-ppl) or a missing configuration option.

Anyway. With a cloog-ppl package using the options `--with-gmp --with-ppl`, the gcc package seems to pick up `CLooG PPL`. I'm afraid I can not post the updated packages, as sage.math seems to be down.

I guess it is since `CLooG` looks for GMP in the standard location, "standard" being determined by the `--prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL"` option that I do provide.

Anyway. What is really missing is at least the option `--with-ppl`, or even a cloog-ppl package with that option.

Since sage.math seems to be down, I can't post either of the two spkgs...

[Leif](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/4e90520289b7b5ba/a84a9363d4ff6495) cited from the GCC prerequisites page:

```
CLooG-PPL version( 0.15 or CLooG 0.16
    Necessary to build GCC with the Graphite loop optimizations. There
are two versions available. CLooG-PPL 0.15 as well as CLooG 0.16. The
former is the default right now. It can be downloaded from
ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/ as cloog-ppl-0.15.tar.gz.

    CLooG 0.16 support is still in testing stage, but will be the
default in future GCC releases. It is also available at
ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/ as cloog-0.16.1.tar.gz. To
use it add the additional configure option --enable-cloog-backend=isl.
Even if CLooG 0.16 does not use PPL, PPL is still required for
Graphite.
```

Actually, I found that `cloog-0.16.1` does not work, i.e., gcc does not build. Hence, I made a cloog_ppl-0.15.11 spkg, that I suggest to make an optional spkg.

More than two and a half years later...

I think we can close this, as while GCC 4.9 still uses CLooG and ISL, GCC 5.x and 6.x have dropped CLooG and now only use ISL (if at all, i.e., with `--enable-lto`).

cloog/isl and previously ppl were for the graphite plugin which does loop optimization, not "link time optimization" unless you know something I don't. In any case I am for closing it too.

Yes, but that was (at least years ago) also, if not only, done *at link time*.  But LTO has massively changed (and improved) over the last years, they say.

Not sure whether CLooG was initially used during *compilation* as well.
