singular_ring_delete(ring*) called with NULL pointer.

Exception KeyError: (The ring pointer 0x0,) in 'sage.libs.singular.ring.singular_ring_delete' ignored

```
The cause is that if `GroebnerStrategy.__cinit__()` raises an exception, its `__dealloc__` method is still called.  Therefore `__dealloc__()` should only delete things that were actually constructed before the exception occurred.

Ticket #14902 is a duplicate of this one.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I'm not sure if this is actually supposed to work in Sage right now. Multivariate polynomial rings over `CC` use a generic implementation. The error message should just say "First parameter's ring must be multivariate polynomial ring via libsingular." This is not entirely clear, but at least it is a less scary message than "singular_ring_delete(ring*) called with NULL pointer."

Here is a shorter segment to reproduce the problem:

```
sage: P.<X,Y,Z> = CC[]
sage: I = P*X
sage: GroebnerStrategy(I)
  File "/home/burcin/sage/sage-4.7.2/local/bin/sage-ipython", line 52, in <module>

    exec code_obj in self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns
  File "<ipython console>", line 1, in <module>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/burcin/sage/sage-4.7.2/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: First parameter's ring must be multivariate polynomial ring via libsingular.
```

This is the message I get after adding an "except +" after the declaration of `singular_ring_delete()`.

It seems that `GroebnerStrategy.__cinit__()` (why `__cinit__` and not `__init__`?) already has a doctest for this case. I don't see why the error message is not caught by the doctesting framework. Are these cython errors printed to `stderr` now?

In any case, `GroebnerStrategy.__cinit__()` raises an error on line 99 of `sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy.pyx`. I thought the `__dealloc__()` method is not called if there is an error during `__init__()`. Any ideas what is going wrong here?

I suggest to open a new ticket to use libsingular from multivariate polynomial rings over CC and RR. This ticket can be about eliminating the scary `singular_ring_delete` error message.

<a id='comment:5'></a>A quick test reveals that:

```
P.<X,Y,Z> = CC[]

(Who ever thought that "Jacobian" was a good name for the singular subscheme? I think most algebraic geometers expect something else when they ask for the Jacobian of a curve).

and a little look indeed shows that this code tries to use "singular"'s reduce (the ideal gets reconstructed several times), and I think it does so successfully (does singular now allow rings with float coefficients?), so it looks indeed like a mismatch in ring deletions. It may be a good test case, because the ring really gets constructed internally, via a `_singular_` method.

With the patch, the example in the ticket description gives the right answer (`is_smooth() -> True`) and no error.

Here the correct `TypeError` message is displayed.

> It seems that `GroebnerStrategy.__cinit__()` (why `__cinit__` and not `__init__`?)


It would be cleaner to separate the initialisation of Python and C attributes into `__init__` and `__cinit__`.  I tried changing `__cinit__` to `__init__` and it did not make any difference.

> already has a doctest for this case. I don't see why the error message is not caught by the doctesting framework. Are these cython errors printed to `stderr` now?


This is indeed surprising.

> In any case, `GroebnerStrategy.__cinit__()` raises an error on line 99 of `sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy.pyx`. I thought the `__dealloc__()` method is not called if there is an error during `__init__()`. Any ideas what is going wrong here?


Apparently `__dealloc__` *is* called; I didn't check the Cython documentation.
