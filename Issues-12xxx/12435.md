The lcalc spkg currently does not respect the global CXX flag, we should fix this (for instance for #12426).

I've posted an spkg fixes this (and #12436, #12437) at  [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/lcalc-1.23.p10.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/lcalc-1.23.p10.spkg). (This is a review spkg in case there are more issues with clang down the road.)

Duplicate of #12681.

Component: **build**

Ooops, didn't see this ticket (as it was not listed on #2999 / #3000).

Since #12681 has meanwhile been merged into Sage 5.0.beta9, we should close this.  Sorry.


Unfortunately your changes from #12436 and #12437 will then have to be "rebased" on my spkg.
