There are a number of tickets open due to the use of `simplify_radical()` in `simplify_full()`.

Removing it would fix at least,

* [Ask Sage 767](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/767/simplification-errors-in-simple-expressions)
* #11934 - Symbolic simplification error
* #12322 - invalid simplification of complex logarithm
* [Ask Sage 1983](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1983/strange-way-to-simplify-square-roots)
And maybe more.  Here are some related tickets.
* #11912 is related, though about `simplify_radical` specifically.
* #11668 - `abs(a+b)^2 == (a+b)^2` is now fixed by #12780
* #14305 and #14630 are tangentially related

It's completely heuristic: the four I chose nobody seems to have a problem with. `simplify_radical`, on the other hand, wreaks havoc on trivial functions and has been the cause of numerous bug reports and mailing list discussions.

In `simplify`, after #12650, I say that a safe simplification is one "for which we are reasonably sure that the input will be considered equivalent to the output." That's probably the best we can do for now, and I'm *reasonably sure* that most people would consider `x^2/x` equivalent to `x`.

As it stands, I think `full_simplify` *sounds* safe so people will assume that anyway. This fix, while not perfect, at least improves things.

I'm reasonably sure that no mathematician would consider them equivalent unless you add "almost everywhere".  Simplification *simplifies*, hence makes it not actually the same (at least potentially).  This shouldn't be controversial.

Well, everything *sounds* safe unless you put in the word "unsafe".

I'm pretty confused as to the relation of this to #12650.  See [my comments there](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/12650#comment:6).

I'm sympathetic to doing something about `radcan`, but simplification is simplification, not identity.

Doesn't it make more sense to either document fully what can go wrong with `simplify_full`, or to add a flag `simplify_radicals` or something?  I think that changing behavior in this case is probably the best compromise, but probably `unsafe` is sending the wrong message.  There isn't anything unsafe about `radcan`, it's just a different point of view than ours - symbolic expressions versus functions.  Spend some time on the Maxima list :)

Before our discussion on another one of these tickets, I had assumed it was not controversial that simplification had to return an equivalent expression. So it is at least a little controversial.

All expressions in sage are callable like functions, so if you have both radicals and a variable in an expression, `simplify_radical()` is unsafe. I.e. you're probably gonna get the wrong answer. I think marking it as unsafe is more likely to catch someone's attention than asking him to read the documentation. I almost certainly used `full_simplify()` for years without doing so, since I thought I knew what it was doing and had used similar functions in e.g. Mathematica. I think the problem is that it's called "simplification," not that it exists.

Either way, `f.full_simplify(simplify_radicals=True)` is not much better than `f.full_simplify().simplify_radical()`... the keyword argument is the easy way out, but I feel like it should control more than one method call if we do it. And if we remove the unsafe simplifications from `full_simplify()`, that seems to make `simplify()` redundant, too. That's the dual situation to what we'd have after #12650, but at least we could add more stuff to `full_simplify()` in the future to change that.

This should be a more straight-forward proposal. I just removed `simplify_radical()` from `simplify_full()` and fixed a few doctests (details in the commit message).

One of the doctest fixes is duplicated in #12780; the doctest is wrong (missing assumptions) but we're masking that fact at the moment.

I just put up a new patch that should apply cleanly. There are some failing tests in doc/de/thematische_anleitungen/sage_gymnasium.rst, but I don't know what the surrounding context is and so I'm not sure how best to fix them. Will need some attention from the Germans.

In that same thread: Robert D. of Maxima reports

```
>   sage: u, v = var('u, v', domain='real') 
>   sage: sqrt(-1/(u^2+v^2-1)).simplify_radical()  # This will hang 

This is a bug in Maxima: 

(%i2) radcan (sqrt (-1 / (u^2 + v^2 - 1))), domain=complex; 

It waits apparently forever here -- but it is actually looping over 
*ALPHA (not sure why) which is a large prime number (8388593). 

(%i3) :lisp (setq *alpha 17) 
17 
(%i3) radcan(sqrt(-1/(u^2+v^2-1))), domain=complex; 
(%o3) 1/sqrt(-v^2-u^2+1) 

I've reported this as bug # 2605. 
```
E.g. [Maxima 2605](http://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2605/).  We may want to open a ticket for this or something, maybe along with #11912.

I'll take a look at the failures in the new German tutorial at some point today, it's probably not a big deal.

I'm at the moment unsure how to fix this. I guess the first example that fails could just be removed since it can be numerically evaluated. But I think the second example should remain in the tutorial and should be fixed. At the moment I don't have the time to look into it. I won't be around till mid August. 

@kcrisman Ich habe es vor allem als Vereinfachung bezeichnet, da es die notwendige Umformung ist, welche man für das Lösen von Exponentialgleichungen benötigt. Aus diesem Grund halte ich es auch für wichtig, dass man erwähnt, wie man eine solche Umformung machen kann. 

Man könnte es aber natürlich umbennen. Ich würde es als "Zerlegung durch Benutzen der Logarithmengesetze" oder ähnlich nennen. 

Natürlich wäre es schon, wenn man simplify_radical nicht separat aufführen muss, um die Sache einfach zu halten. Wenn es aber aus simplify_full fliegt, müsste man es wohl erwähnen.

Tja...

Michael, I'll try to keep this on the front burner for finding a good fix - navigium has a good phrase we can use, and I don't really see any other way to fix this, since it does happen to be very convenient that we can use radcan in some cases to do log expansion.

I think that's a great way to solve my document. Now the readers even get something extra because they are taught how to apply log rules both ways. Thanks @kcrisman for solving it.

<div id="comment:32" align="right">Comment 32</div>

Updates:

Removed
* #3520 - inconsistency in simplify_radical
from description, as that was not about `simplify_full` to start with.

I posted updates on the ask.sagemath questions just now.

#11934 needs review.

#12322 needs to be reworded since we didn't use the "unsafe" parameter in `simplify_full`.
