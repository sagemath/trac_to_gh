I would change "comandaments" and "comandes" to "ordres", which is what Termcat proposes.

Also, I think that in Python one writes

```
if 3 == 5-2:
    ...
```

instead of

```
if(3 == 5-2):
    ...
```

Both constructions do the same, it's just a matter of style. Similarly, spacing is supposed to increase legibility, so one uses:

```
x = 3
```

instead of

```
x=3
```

It seems OK to me. 

I just noticed a few typos:

- "mentres que" --> "mentre que"
- "l'inversa" --> "la inversa"
- "Així mateix,:" --> "Així mateix:"
- "col.leccions" --> "col·leccions"
- "multiplicative_order(x)" --> "multiplicative_order(n)", and similarly for additive_order

Applied the patch and the html build's with no warnings on Mountain Lion with a freshly built 5.8. The pdf build with a few hyperref errors. 

The biggest problem that I see is that there sage code blocks that aren't getting recognized by sphinx sprinkled throughout the output. For example, 

```
La i-èssima entrada d’una seqüència (o d’un conjunt) C és C[i]. Però compte perquè Sage enumera les posicions des de 0!:

::
    sage: S[1] = 1000 sage: S [121, 1000, 25, 9, 9, 25, 49, 121] sage: S[3] 9 
```

It's been awhile since I worked with sphinx but I believe that the problem is not leaving a space after :: in the rst source.

Actually, I found a few very minor things you may have missed.

* This will be machine-dependent, as it involves dictionaries.

```
sage -t src/doc/ca/tutorial/index.rst
**********************************************************************
File "src/doc/ca/tutorial/index.rst", line 494, in doc.ca.tutorial.index
Failed example:
    solutions = solve([sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) == 5, x + y == 10], x, y,solution_dict = True); solutions
Expected:
    [{x: -5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5, y: 5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5}, {x: 5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5, y: -5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5}]
Got:
    [{y: 5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5, x: -5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5},
     {y: -5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5, x: 5/2*I*sqrt(5) + 5}]
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
```
  Since the solutions are then printed out nicely, I think the easiest fix is just to confirm the solutions are, in fact, dicts.
* There were two extra `skip`s that escaped because of a misplaced double colon.
* pdf doc didn't build due to something perhaps intentional, but which is a character that html recognizes but pdf/latex didn't.  Based on [this Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct#Catalan), I am going to use a period, since `\textperiodcentered` wouldn't look to great in html :-)
* Finally, since in several other localizations (Spanish, Russian, French) the `tutorial` files are the translations of the original tutorial, I think we should rename this - maybe `introduction` or something.  I'm going to do that as well.

Then all that will need review ... sorry.
