Hi, 

The multicommodity flow (mcf) problem has other variants that are important as well - e.g. the maximum concurrent flow problem (which generalizes the maximum multicommodity flow problem) see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-commodity_flow_problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-commodity_flow_problem). Currently, the only mcf problem variant implemented is the demand satisfaction mcf problem. Is it possible to implement the others as well? for the maximum concurrent flow, which is the one I care about, it just means changing an equality to an inequality in the LP.

Thanks,

Yair Zick
