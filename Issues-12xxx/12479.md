This ticket aims to do a simply clean-up of `sage-spkg` and nothing more.  The goal is to provide a solid base for future enhancements to `sage-spkg`, not fix all issues regarding `sage-spkg`.

Mostly, this patch reorganizes things.  Some diagnostics are added, for example a warning when `spkg-install` or `spkg-check` isn't executable.  Also, the line

```
TEST SUITE: not available
```
being printed to `spkg/installed/$PKG_NAME` when `SAGE_CHECK=yes` but there is no `spkg-check` file.

Follow-ups:
1. #12579: allow selective `SAGE_CHECK`
2. #12602: rework downloading/extracting of .spkg files
3. #12606: Fix sage --info <package>
4. #12613: Add '-c' option so `sage -i -c <pkg>` installs the package and runs its test suite.

Depends on #4949
Depends on #10192

What is the file `SAGE.txt` referred to in this script? Should it be `SPKG.txt` instead? For example:

```
        echo >&2 "No file SAGE.txt in $PKG_NAME"
```

By the way, #12579 also modifies sage-spkg; you might take a look at that ticket if you have time.

What do you think of replacing `./spkg-check` with `time ./spkg-check`?

My previous comment about creating directories unnecessarily also applies when running `sage -i` with no arguments.

For "Authors", perhaps you could add something like:

```
 - William Stein and others (Sage 4.8 and earlier)
```
after your name.

The header might also include documentation about the options -f, -s, -info.  Actually, I don't think -info is used anywhere, nor is it accessible from the main sage script; should it be deleted altogether (here or on another ticket)?  If we want to keep it, then consider lines 209-213:

```
    echo ""
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "No file SPKG.txt in $PKG_NAME"
        exit 1
    fi
```
Won't the test `if [ $? -ne 0]; then` reflect the exit status of the `echo` command?  I think that the `echo` line should be deleted and the test moved inside the previous if block, so it's connected to the tar command.  Or something like that.

The reason I put your name also is because it appears several times in `hg log` of the 4.8 `sage-spkg`.

The patch to `spkg/bin/sage` needs work: the combination of

```sh
if [ "$1" = '-i' ]; then
   shift
   install "$@"   # used to be    install " " "$@"
fi
```
and (in the install function)

```sh
    if [ $# -le 1 ]; then
        exec sage-spkg
    fi
```
means that `sage -i pkg` just lists the currently installed packages. Maybe this test should say `if [ $# -eq 0 ]`?  Maybe if after processing the flags, there are no arguments left, then you should run `exec sage-spkg`?  For example:

There are probably better ways of doing this.

Otherwise, I think this is looking good.

This is a possible suggestion for another ticket: have a command-line flag for spkg-install which sets `SAGE_CHECK` to be "yes".  That might be more convenient than setting `SAGE_CHECK=yes`, running `sage -i ...`, then unsetting `SAGE_CHECK`.

This shouldn't have anything to do with positive review here, but aren't there a few spkgs that run tests automatically with or without `SAGE_CHECK`, and don't have spkg-check files?  I see them sometimes while waiting for Sage to build... For instance, R does this, I believe, and maybe one of the elliptic curve packages.

It must be the `spkg-install` file doing that.  With `patch` (the first spkg I tried), there are no errors:
