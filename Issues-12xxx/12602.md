```
The current code in `sage-spkg` to determine which package to install and whether to download it is buggy and too complicated.  Also get rid of calls to the `newest_version` script, get rid of the "download again" part (why was it needed?).

Changes in behaviour:
1. When specifying a download URL, it will always download the file, even if a corresponding spkg exists locally.  This allows for easier development of spkgs, because people often post updated spkgs with the same version number.
2. "sage -f package" without a version number will use the most recent (by modification time) local spkg in spkg/standard or spkg/optional.  Only if no such package exists, it will try to download it.  This makes it consistent with "sage -f package-x.y.z" with a version number.
3. Allow gzip compression (in addition to bzip2 and no compression) of spkgs.

**Apply** [attachment: 12602_spkg_download.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12602/12602_spkg_download.patch.gz) to the SAGE_ROOT repository.

I still think the default should be to give priority to local packages.

We could support the following (-u for "upgrade"):

```
./sage -i -u mpfr
```
which would check the latest online version of mpfr, download it if needed.  What do you think?

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment:11):
> On line 268, why `cd /`?

No real reason.  I just wanted to make sure that `PKG_SRC` is an absolute path.  So doing "cd /" would give a failure if `PKG_SRC` had a relative path.

I changed the relevant code to the safer

```
# Do a final check that PKG_SRC is a file with an absolute path
cd /
if [ ! -f "$PKG_SRC" ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error: spkg file '$PKG_SRC' not found."
    echo >&2 "This shouldn't happen, it is a bug in the sage-spkg script."
    exit 1
fi

# Go back to SAGE_ROOT where we have less chance of completely messing
# up the system if we do something wrong.
cd "$SAGE_ROOT" || exit
```
