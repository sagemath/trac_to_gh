```
sage: # Define the generators for the group of symmetries of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
sage: r = Permutation("(1,7,9,3)(2,4,8,6)")
sage: f = Permutation("(1,3)(4,6)(7,9)")
sage: # Generate the group of symmetries for the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
sage: PermutationGroup([r,f])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
```

Should see

```
Permutation Group with generators [(1,3)(4,6)(7,9), (1,7,9,3)(2,4,8,6)]
```
This is the result when run on a server running 'Sage Version 4.6, Release Date: 2010-10-30'.
