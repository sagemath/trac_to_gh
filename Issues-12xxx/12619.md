The EU "Molto" project has created a prototype of getting natural language to interface with Sage - see the [starting webpage](http://www.molto-project.eu/wiki/d62-prototype-comanding-cas).  This can be used as 
* [an interface](http://www.molto-project.eu/wiki/living-deliverables/d62-prototype-comanding-cas/gfsage-natural-language-interface-sage)
* [an evaluation percent directive within Sage](http://www.molto-project.eu/wiki/using-natural-language-inside-sage).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.8, Release Date: 2012-01-20                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |

sage: 2+2

sage: %english

  --> Switching to Gf <-- 

No autocompletion available
''
english: compute the sum of 2 and 2.
4
english: 

  --> Exiting back to Sage <-- 

sage: 
```

This is accomplished by some pretty minor changes in setup.py and adding a couple interface files in various places.   We would *not* make this a standard package, ever, because the [dependencies](http://www.molto-project.eu/wiki/living-deliverables/d62-prototype-comanding-cas/gfsage-natural-language-interface-sage) include Haskell  and the grammatical framework [GF](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/).

So why not?

Nice.  Can I suggest a tremendously helpful improvement?  Can you print out the Sage code that is executed?  That would help people learn the syntax and let them double-check the natural language parsing.

Well, their goal is somewhat different from ours.  But maybe that could be an *option* in the main program, which we would enable by default in a Sage optional spkg.
