I'm currently editing a file in the Sage library, and emacs created a hidden file `.#plot.py` that, until I save `plot.py`, is a broken symlink. When I do `search_def`, I get:

```
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/scratch/sage-4.7.2/devel/sage/sage/plot/.#plot.py'
```
I think `search_src` and friends should just ignore hidden files, since no genuine source file in the Sage library is hidden!

I'm not sure...create a hidden file with an unlikely string in it, do `search_src` for that string? Check it returns nothing? 

OTOH, I feel pretty confident about the code "`not f.startswith('.')`". So it seems reasonable to leave this one as it is.

Thanks for the review!
