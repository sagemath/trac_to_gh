The error is exactly the same as the one reported for MPIR at #12765 ("impossible reload").

The spkg below also fixes some other issues, and applies all official upstream patches published so far.

**New spkg:** [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/mpfr-3.1.0.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/mpfr-3.1.0.p1.spkg)

### mpfr-3.1.0.p1 (Leif Leonhardy, April 13th 2012)
* #12837: Work around GCC 4.7.0 bug on ia64 (Itanium), unfortunately by almost
  completely disabling optimization on that platform.  (MPFR is also a pre-
  requisite for building the GCC spkg; after that has been built, MPFR will
  get rebuilt with normal optimization.)
* Use `patch` to apply patches.
* Apply all recent "official" upstream patches; the resulting MPFR version
  then is 3.1.0-p8.
* Properly quote the parameter to the `configure` option `--libdir`.
* Export `CFLAGS`! Previously MPFR would not even have used "its own" flags
  (extracted from `config.status` after configuring it with `CC` and `CFLAGS`
  unset) if `CFLAGS`, set in its `spkg-install`, weren't already exported.
  (Also export `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS`, to which `$CFLAG64` is now also added
  if `SAGE64` is `yes`.)
* Add `$CFLAG64` to *required* `CFLAGS` if `SAGE64=yes`.
* Clean up the spkg; redirect all warnings and error messages to stderr; add
  some messages.

Oh, and there are still two "open" issues:

```sh
    if [ "$SAGE64" = yes ]; then
        if [ -z "$CFLAG64" ]; then
            CFLAG64=-m64
        fi
        echo "Building a 64-bit version of MPFR (using '$CFLAG64')."
        # XXX Shouldn't this be put into the *required* CFLAGS?
        default_cflags="$default_cflags $CFLAG64"
        CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $CFLAG64"
        LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS $CFLAG64"
        # As MPFR doesn't have C++ files, we don't have to modify CXXFLAGS.
    fi
```
(I think I'll just change that.)




```sh
    # XXX What is the following supposed to achieve???
    # (GMP/MPIR is a prerequisite for MPFR, and we always build MPIR with
    # '--enable-gmpcompat', since MPFR and other packages won't build without
    # that anyway.) 
    if [ ! -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/gmp.h" ]; then
        SAGE_CONF_OPTS="$SAGE_CONF_OPTS --disable-static --enable-shared"
    fi

    if [ "$UNAME" = CYGWIN ]; then
        SAGE_CONF_OPTS="$SAGE_CONF_OPTS --disable-static --enable-shared"
    fi
```
(I feel a bit uncomfortable just removing the first `if`-block, since I have absolutely no idea why or how it did get there.  The second `if` seems related; I didn't plan to remove that.)

Ok, now committed the changes, new spkg is at the same, usual place.

It uses `required_cflags` for `$CFLAG64`; the rest is still in.
