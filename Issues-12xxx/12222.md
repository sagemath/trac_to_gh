This ticket is about changing the default aspect ratio for these objects to 1.0:

* circle
* arc
* disk
* ellipse
* polygon

The idea is that when someone draws these, they want angles and circles to look correct in the plot.  Changing the default aspect ratio for a circle also corrects the very first example in plot.py (which was broken by #12213)

Let me repeat a suggestion from #12213: have a distinction between "user set aspect ratio 1" and "automatically set aspect ratio 1". In the first case we definitely must do what the user wants. In the second case it is reasonable to skew circles, if otherwise the plot will be totally horrible: something like having one dimension 5 times bigger than another.

If this is implemented, I would argue that the default always should be 1, except for cases when there is a good reason otherwise.

We think that if someone draws a circle, it is expected to be round, but for lines nobody cares.

However, if I draw two lines with slopes 2 and -1/2, I expect to see that they are perpendicular, and if they are not - it is the same as a skew circle.

It also seems to me that plot addition does not have to be associative, especially for 2D plots: to me left + right means "draw right on top of left" and it seemed to me that's what it does.

With this convention, it actually may make sense to inherit the aspect ratio from the left (which is likely to be more complicated, especially in "+=" operations). I unintentionally expected it when I had a complicated plot and wanted to add a couple lines to it. When the first plot is obtained from some function and it also has say, label options adjusted in a certain way, it gets especially annoying that adding a single line or a point discards all the customized look, unless I repeat all adjustments (which were hidden in the function).

In general, this is great.  So almost ready for prime time.  

Okay, here's something that still doesn't look good and is in the documentation already.

In plot.py:

```
f(x) = (x-3)*(x-5)*(x-7)+40
P = line([(2,0),(2,f(2))], color='black')
P += line([(8,0),(8,f(8))], color='black')
P += polygon([(2,0),(2,f(2))] + [(x, f(x)) for x in [2,2.1,..,8]] + [(8,0),(2,0)],  rgbcolor=(0.8,0.8,0.8))
P += text("$\\int_{a}^b f(x) dx$", (5, 20), fontsize=16, color='black')
P += plot(f, (1, 8.5), thickness=3)
P    # show the result
```
The polygon one needs to have something done with it, because it's overriding the 'automatic' and looks quite bad.

Hopefully this is the only one.  Putting to 'needs work', but don't whip up a patch immediately until I've checked the rest.

I have to say, reading through the plot doc page with pictures is quite pleasant visually.

I wasn't suggesting setting default for polygon to 'automatic', but to use it in this particular example.  I think it's a little unusual - usually one would use the `fill` keyword, not the polygon, for this case!

A few more things:
* I don't know why, but I'm still getting aspect ratio automatic pictures in arcs even though the aspect ratio test in the documentation is passing.
* I have a feeling that complex plots should have 'automatic' as well, now, if that's possible to do easily (it may not be, and if it's not new then forget about it).  Try, for instance, `complex_plot(sqrt(x), (-5, 5), (-.1, .1))`.
* Contour plots and vector fields seem to have 'automatic' now (try `contour_plot(f, (-1, 1), (-200, 200), contours=(0.1, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4), cmap='hsv')`) but density plots clearly are 1.0.   I'm not sure which is better, but they should be the same, I think.  I seem to recall them being 1.0 before, but of course all the examples are ones where 1.0 and automatic will look the same.
