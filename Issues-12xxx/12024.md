After deleting the server directory (#11409) we need to add doctests to about 588 more functions to get coverage to 90%, which is a major goal for sage-5.0, which we've been working on getting to for over a year now. I did an audit and came up with about 350 functions in 18 files for which adding coverage will not be too hard.

Just edit the ticket description and add your name after the * that you will get coverage to 100% on that file.  You an also create a ticket with your tests (put #number) in.  Then it will be easy to referee all these doctest patches.  Try to make different tickets if/when you find bugs, and restrict your ticket to just doctests so it is easy to referee.    You can also add another file to the list.

Deleting sage/server (the old old notebook that can go away in 5.0, 
IIRC) gives us this: 
Overall weighted coverage score:  88.1% 
Total number of functions:  27936 
We need  516 more function to get to 90% coverage. 
We need 1913 more function to get to 95% coverage. 
We need 3031 more function to get to 99% coverage. 
```
I've also moved the milestone and made this a blocker for 5.0, since it has been one of the goals for several years.  TBDFL or release manager can change this if that's not appropriate.

<a id='comment:63'></a>Going for 90% is a nice goal, but I don't think it should block the sage-5.0 release.

In sage-5.0.beta13:

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  88.3%
Total number of functions:  29374
We need  494 more function to get to 90% coverage.
We need 1963 more function to get to 95% coverage.
We need 3138 more function to get to 99% coverage.
```

Agreed. We are close, and we will get there, but not for sage-5.0.
