After deleting the server directory (#11409) we need to add doctests to about 588 more functions to get coverage to 90%, which is a major goal for sage-5.0, which we've been working on getting to for over a year now. I did an audit and came up with about 350 functions in 18 files for which adding coverage will not be too hard.

Just edit the ticket description and add your name after the * that you will get coverage to 100% on that file.  You an also create a ticket with your tests (put #number) in.  Then it will be easy to referee all these doctest patches.  Try to make different tickets if/when you find bugs, and restrict your ticket to just doctests so it is easy to referee.    You can also add another file to the list.

+After deleting the server directory we need to add doctests to about
+588 more functions to get coverage to 90%, which is a major goal for
+sage-5.0, which we've been working on getting to for over a year now.
+I did an audit and came up with about 350 functions in 18 files for
+which adding coverage will not be too hard. 
+
+Just edit the ticket description and add your name after the * that
+you will get coverage to 100% on that file.  You an also create a

+if/when you find bugs, and restrict your ticket to just doctests so it
+is easy to referee.    You can also add another file to the list.

It will be a lot of work to properly doctest this file, but much of it is straightforward (e.g., examples for the mpnumber) class.

Deleting sage/server (the old old notebook that can go away in 5.0, 
IIRC) gives us this: 
Overall weighted coverage score:  88.1% 
Total number of functions:  27936 
We need  516 more function to get to 90% coverage. 
We need 1913 more function to get to 95% coverage. 
We need 3031 more function to get to 99% coverage. 
```
I've also moved the milestone and made this a blocker for 5.0, since it has been one of the goals for several years.  TBDFL or release manager can change this if that's not appropriate.

+After deleting the server directory (#11409) we need to add doctests to about 588 more functions to get coverage to 90%, which is a major goal for sage-5.0, which we've been working on getting to for over a year now. I did an audit and came up with about 350 functions in 18 files for which adding coverage will not be too hard.
 
+Just edit the ticket description and add your name after the * that you will get coverage to 100% on that file.  You an also create a ticket with your tests (put #number) in.  Then it will be easy to referee all these doctest patches.  Try to make different tickets if/when you find bugs, and restrict your ticket to just doctests so it is easy to referee.

+After deleting the server directory (#11409) we need to add doctests to about 588 more functions to get coverage to 90%, which is a major goal for sage-5.0, which we've been working on getting to for over a year now. I did an audit and came up with about 350 functions in 18 files for which adding coverage will not be too hard.
 
+Just edit the ticket description and add your name after the * that you will get coverage to 100% on that file.  You an also create a ticket with your tests (put #number) in.  Then it will be easy to referee all these doctest patches.  Try to make different tickets if/when you find bugs, and restrict your ticket to just doctests so it is easy to referee.

+After deleting the server directory (#11409) we need to add doctests to about 588 more functions to get coverage to 90%, which is a major goal for sage-5.0, which we've been working on getting to for over a year now.

+After deleting the server directory (#11409) we need to add doctests to about 588 more functions to get coverage to 90%, which is a major goal for sage-5.0, which we've been working on getting to for over a year now. I did an audit and came up with about 350 functions in 18 files for which adding coverage will not be too hard.
 
+Just edit the ticket description and add your name after the * that you will get coverage to 100% on that file.  You an also create a ticket with your tests (put #number) in.  Then it will be easy to referee all these doctest patches.  Try to make different tickets if/when you find bugs, and restrict your ticket to just doctests so it is easy to referee.    You can also add another file to the list.
