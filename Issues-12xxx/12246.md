Helloooooooo !!!

I think I had the same problem a looong time ago, and I probably chosed the nasty way out. What happens when you cite the paper while not defining them in the same function ? Are the links broken, or fo they redirect toward the other function's references ?
The release manager is wise but his wrath is terrifying. In particular, he does not like warnings, so we should avoid that `:-D`

If the references are broken when you cite in one method the references defined in another one, I'd say that duplicating them and changing the name (add a number at the end, or a letter) is not thaaaaaat bad anyway `:-)`

Oh, and two other things :
* The "commit message" of the patch you send must begin with "trac #12246 -- explanation of what the ticket does"
* When there are several patches to be applied, or when there are dependencies, it should be explicitely said in the ticket's description.

The reason behind 1) is that there is a script using this information to create the list of contributions (and contributors) for each release, and most importantly that the release manager prefers it this way `:-D`

The reason behind 2) is that there is a program we call the "sagebot" (cf. the circle you can see on this page, just near the ticket's title) that uses this information to automatically apply the tickets and check the tests pass.

Last thing --> The ticket's "type" is "enhancement".

Short of this, all tests pass !
