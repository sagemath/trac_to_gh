This patch adds 4 new graph constructors, that is DoubleStarSnar, FosterGraph, GrayGraph and HarriesGraph.

I am really having fun trying to build good drawings, but these graphs really get complicated sometimes !!! `:-)`

By the way, [PEP 8 recommends](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations) putting no spaces around "=" when defining default arguments in function definitions:

```python
def f(x, y, z=42):
```

not

```python
def f(x, y, z = 42):
```
