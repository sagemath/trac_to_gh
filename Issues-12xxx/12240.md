Multivariate powerseries over SR seem to work, but coercion does not. For example, the coercion from ZZ to QQ works fine:

```
sage: T.<a,b> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ,2)
sage: f = 1 + a + b + a*b + T.O(5)
sage: 1/2 * f
1/2 + 1/2*a + 1/2*b + 1/2*a*b + O(a, b)^5
```
but the same thing fails with SR:

```
sage: exp(2) * f
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Symbolic Ring' and 'Multivariate Power Series Ring in a, b over Integer Ring'
```
Also, manually changing the base ring brings out the background polynomial variable:

```
sage: f.change_ring(SR)
(Tbg*a*b + a + b)*Tbg + 1 + O(a, b)^5
```
