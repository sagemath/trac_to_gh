sage: R = Integers(6)
sage: binomial(R(5), R(2))
10
sage: binomial(R(5), R(2)).parent()
Integer Ring
```

But `binomial(R(5), R(2))` is nonsense, both as an element of ZZ and as an element of R:

```
sage: binomial(5, 2)
10
sage: binomial(11, 2)
55
sage: binomial(5, 8)
0
```

On input `binomial(x, y)`, what Sage should do instead is the following:
* If the parent of y is Zmod(n) rather than ZZ, a `TypeError` should be raised.
* (This seems to be fixed by #17852) If factorial(y) is zero or a zero-divisor in the parent of x, a `ZeroDivisionError` should be raised. This is automatic if one computes binomial(x, y) simply as
  {{{
  x.parent()(prod([x-k for k in range(y)]) / factorial(y))
  }}}

I definitely agree, the changes I was proposing were to simply try and return a more sensible type.

Since I am new to sage, I was trying to keep as much of the existing algorithm intact, so that it wouldn't have any unexpected behaviour. For example, currently it seems that sage uses Peri to calculate the usual binomial coefficient. So I wasn't sure if the implementation for modulo n would belong here.

That sounds sensible, this is a bugfix patch and the inefficiency is not introduced by your patch. So if you don't want to, you don't have to improve the speed. However, since you're editing anyway, you might as well. It's up to you. The other issues
 
* documentation that does not build correctly
* a conflicting patch has already been merged

do need to be resolved though.

For the first issue, after building Sage, use `sage -docbuild reference html` to rebuild the documentation and see if all the changed documentation looks good (in this case, replacing : by :: will probably be enough).

As for the second issue, you should not write two independent patches editing the same part of a file. They can't be applied after each other, because the second-to-be-applied can't find the piece of code that it should change. You should write your patch for #12179 on top of a copy of Sage that has #11417 applied.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Finally got around to reinstalling sage after a hard-drive failure. Hoping to get back on track with contributing to sage. Sorry for the incredibly slow response.

Hopefully this should tie up this loose end.

While I do agree that there is room for improving the speed of calculating binomial coefficients mod N, I don't feel like it's worth bloating the binomial function with multiple extra lines of code for something which doesn't seem to be used much.

Perhaps it could be added as a feature at a later stage when the need is there.

However, I feel that this patch adequately addresses the original issue: that elements are treated as integers and returned as such, with no attempt to return them to their original class. This could potentially help with other cases.

Thanks for the advice with regards to the other issues.

    "body": "<a id='comment:13'></a>Oops, I never got around to looking at the mathematics while reviewing your rest-formatting before. The problem is that binomial(x, y) is in general not defined for x and y integers modulo n. I'll update the ticket description appropriately.\n\nAllowing y to be anything other than an integer makes no sense to me. What would the definition be? In any case, the output has to be in the ring containing x, and will definitely depend on the exact integer y, and not just on y modulo any n. For example:\n\n```\nsage: binomial(5,-2) # bionomial(5, Zmod(2)(0)) = ???\n0\nsage: binomial(5,0)\n1\nsage: binomial(5,2)\n10\nsage: binomial(5,4) \n5\nsage: binomial(5,6)\n0\n```\nSummary: if y is an element of Zmod(n), then surely a `ValueError` must be raised.\n\nThe situation when x is an element of Zmod(n) is more complicated, but cannot be always automatically allowed:\n\n```\nsage: binomial(1, 3) % 3 # binomial(Zmod(3)(1), 3) = ???\n0\nsage: binomial(4, 3) % 3\n1\nsage: binomial(7, 3) % 3\n2\n```\nSo the correct answer to `binomial(Zmod(3)(1), 3)` is \"any integer modulo 3\". Just returning Zmod(3)(0) is wrong. It would be ok to raise an error, I'd say `ZeroDivisionError`, because of the following completely general formula:\n\n```\nsage: binomial(x, 3)\n1/6*x^3 - 1/2*x^2 + 1/3*x\n```\n\nThere are of course some cases that we can still allow. Suppose the input is `binomial(Zmod(n)(x), y)`.\n\n* If n is coprime to factorial(y), then all divisions are allowed, so the output should again be a well-defined element of Zmod(n). This is what happens with the code `x.parent()(prod([x-k for k in range(y)]) / factorial(y))` from the ticket description.\n* In general, we could allow the output be an element of Zmod(n / gcd(factorial(y), n)) instead of Zmod(n). This would mean no `ZeroDivisionError`s are raised, but Zmod(1)(0) is returned instead. This makes sense in the theory and practice of p-adic power series and formal groups, but may not be what the user expects, so I left this out of the new ticket description.",

<a id='comment:13'></a>Oops, I never got around to looking at the mathematics while reviewing your rest-formatting before. The problem is that binomial(x, y) is in general not defined for x and y integers modulo n. I'll update the ticket description appropriately.

Allowing y to be anything other than an integer makes no sense to me. What would the definition be? In any case, the output has to be in the ring containing x, and will definitely depend on the exact integer y, and not just on y modulo any n. For example:

```
sage: binomial(5,-2) # bionomial(5, Zmod(2)(0)) = ???
0
sage: binomial(5,0)
1
sage: binomial(5,2)
10
sage: binomial(5,4) 
5
sage: binomial(5,6)
0
```
Summary: if y is an element of Zmod(n), then surely a `ValueError` must be raised.

The situation when x is an element of Zmod(n) is more complicated, but cannot be always automatically allowed:

```
sage: binomial(1, 3) % 3 # binomial(Zmod(3)(1), 3) = ???
0
sage: binomial(4, 3) % 3
1
sage: binomial(7, 3) % 3
2
```
So the correct answer to `binomial(Zmod(3)(1), 3)` is "any integer modulo 3". Just returning Zmod(3)(0) is wrong. It would be ok to raise an error, I'd say `ZeroDivisionError`, because of the following completely general formula:

```
sage: binomial(x, 3)
1/6*x^3 - 1/2*x^2 + 1/3*x
```

There are of course some cases that we can still allow. Suppose the input is `binomial(Zmod(n)(x), y)`.

* If n is coprime to factorial(y), then all divisions are allowed, so the output should again be a well-defined element of Zmod(n). This is what happens with the code `x.parent()(prod([x-k for k in range(y)]) / factorial(y))` from the ticket description.
* In general, we could allow the output be an element of Zmod(n / gcd(factorial(y), n)) instead of Zmod(n). This would mean no `ZeroDivisionError`s are raised, but Zmod(1)(0) is returned instead. This makes sense in the theory and practice of p-adic power series and formal groups, but may not be what the user expects, so I left this out of the new ticket description.

This should be `TypeError`, because `binomial(x,y)` makes no sense when y is an element of `R`. It only makes sense when y is an integer. For example, binomial(5, 2) = 10, but binomial(5, 2+21) = 0.

So of the two points in the ticket description, the work in #17852 fixes the second one, but the first one is still open.

<a id='comment:26'></a>Hi,

Ticket #17852 is in pass to be positively reviewed. Let me summarize what will change when calling `rings.arith.binomial(x,y)`:
- `y` must be an integer (actually, I only asked that `ZZ(y)` does work and the first lines of code do `y = ZZ(y)`)
- the output type is always the type of `x`
- if `factorial(y)` is not invertible a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised (I checked the behavior on many finite rings that I was able to think of)
