The LCalc interface uses PARI/GP through strings.  This is problematic for the Eisenstein series L-function where Sage passes the value of

```
str(float(pi)**0.5)
```
to PARI/GP.  There are two problems with this:
1. Using `float` has at most 53 bits precision, regardless of what precision is used in PARI/GP.
2. Using strings causes an additional loss of precision.
Letting PARI/GP compute the value of `sqrt(Pi)` solves both these problems.

It should have nothing to do with Python, it is simply a problem that I *discovered* because of the Python upgrade.
