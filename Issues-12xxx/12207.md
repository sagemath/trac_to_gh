We should get a usage message but don't:

```
wstein@ubuntu:s$ ./sage -cython
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/wstein/sage/sage-4.8.alpha5/local/bin/sage-cython", line 7, in <module>
    pyx_file = os.path.abspath(args[-1])
IndexError: list index out of range
```

This is because of a bug in "local/bin/sage-cython".

One amusing things is that for "sage --cython" to correctly work, it *should* return an error:

```
$ sage --cython
... usage message ...
$ echo $?
1
```
Before my patch "sage --cython" also returned an error code of 1 (for a different reason).   Maybe something like this would be useful:

```
sage: 'http://cython.org' in os.popen3('sage -cython')[2].read()
True
```

If you agree, we can add a patch with that in it.
