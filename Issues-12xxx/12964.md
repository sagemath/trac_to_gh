From [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8691546/multiply-matrix-of-matrices-by-a-scalar-in-sage): Define `a` to be a matrix whose entries are matrices, and multiply `a` by a scalar:

```
a = matrix([[matrix([[ 1,  2], [ 3,  4]]),
             matrix([[ 5,  6], [ 7,  8]])],
            [matrix([[ 9, 10], [11, 12]]),
             matrix([[13, 14], [15, 16]])]])
3 * a
```
This results in the following error message:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*':
           'Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring' and
           'Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Integer Ring'
```
which is clearly nonsense. Multiplying `a` by, for example, `3 * identity_matrix(2)` works, by the way.

This happens because matrices don't really use `_mul_`.  The end result is less efficient than it could be (since you're doing matrix multiplications for each entry); however, I think this would be for another ticket.

To close the loop on this, `a.__mul__(b)` is called by Python when a * b is encountered. `a._mul_(b)` is called by the coercion model when `parent(a) is parent(b)` to actually do the arithmetic. Full details at http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/coercion.html
