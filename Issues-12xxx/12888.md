This patch changes the default parameters of graphs.RandomGNP.

As reported in [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/540235c6cc032e75](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/540235c6cc032e75) and discussed in #12362, patch #12362 significantly slows down the graphs.RandomGNP generator. This is due to a change of default value of parameter ``fast`` from ``True`` to ``False``.

This patch put back this parameter to ``True`` and changes the default method to ``Sage`` which is faster in most cases.

The default method is now set to ``Sage`` since it seems faster than the ``networkx`` method, except for very sparse graphs where networkx with ``fast=True`` is faster. Bellow are some experiments from very dense to very spare graphs.

1) When ``method="networkx"`` and ``fast=False`` (so before this patch and after patch #12362)

```
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .8, method = "networkx", fast = False)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 22.5 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .1, method = "networkx", fast = False)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 6.38 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .01, method = "networkx", fast = False)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 4.21 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .001, method = "networkx", fast = False)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 4.07 s per loop
```

2) When ``method="networkx"`` and ``fast=True``

```
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .8, method = "networkx", fast = True)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 19.6 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .1, method = "networkx", fast = True)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 2.44 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .01, method = "networkx", fast = True)') 
5 loops, best of 3: 237 ms per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .001, method = "networkx", fast = True)') 
25 loops, best of 3: 27.9 ms per loop
```

3) When ``method="Sage"`` (with this patch)

```
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .8, method = "Sage")') 
5 loops, best of 3: 11.3 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .1, method = "Sage")') 
5 loops, best of 3: 1.38 s per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .01, method = "Sage")') 
5 loops, best of 3: 166 ms per loop
sage: timeit('graphs.RandomGNP(2000, .001, method = "Sage")') 
5 loops, best of 3: 49 ms per loop
```
