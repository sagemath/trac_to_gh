Now that we have support for gzipped Sage packages (#12602), we can easily make `bzip2` a standard package instead of a base package.  This will further the goal of decreasing the number of base packages (ideally to zero), see also #12631.

**apply** [attachment: 12102_bzip2_standard.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12102/12102_bzip2_standard.patch.gz) to `SAGE_ROOT`.

**delete** the untracked file `spkg/base/bzip2-1.0.5.tar.gz`.

I see that the old package compiles with commands like this:

I thought it was "standard practice" to compile all Sage packages using `-g` (regardless of `SAGE_DEBUG`).  With GCC, files only get larger when compiled with debug information, but the code is exactly the same.  So programs should run equally fast with or without debugging information (except for the I/O effects of having larger files).

By the way, the file `spkg/base/README.txt` should be modified to reflect this change. Is the directory `spkg/base` going to disappear altogether soon? If so, we don't have to worry about this.

Going to do this in #12631.

> Is the directory `spkg/base` going to disappear altogether soon?

Probably not.  Eventually, I would like prereq to become a top-level `./configure` for Sage, but I haven't thought nearly enough about this to see how that would work.
