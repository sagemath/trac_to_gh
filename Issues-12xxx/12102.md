Now that we have support for gzipped Sage packages (#12602), we can easily make `bzip2` a standard package instead of a base package.  This will further the goal of decreasing the number of base packages (ideally to zero), see also #12631.

**apply** [attachment:12102_bzip2_standard.patch] to `SAGE_ROOT`.

**delete** the untracked file `spkg/base/bzip2-1.0.5.tar.gz`.

I thought it was "standard practice" to compile all Sage packages using `-g` (regardless of `SAGE_DEBUG`).  With GCC, files only get larger when compiled with debug information, but the code is exactly the same.

By the way, the file `spkg/base/README.txt` should be modified to reflect this change. Is the directory `spkg/base` going to disappear altogether soon? If so, we don't have to worry about this.

Going to do this in #12631.

Probably not.  Eventually, I would like prereq to become a top-level `./configure` for Sage, but I haven't thought nearly enough about this to see how that would work.
