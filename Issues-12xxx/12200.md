Mestre's algorithm for constructing hyperelliptic curves has been implemented see ticket [#6341](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6341) but it does not work over finite field of characteristic 2

```
    .. TODO::
    
        Mestre's algorithm also only works over finite field of charateristic different from two, another algorithm will be needed for field of characteristic two.
        sage: HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants([GF(2)(1),GF(2)(1),GF(2)(0),GF(2)(1)]) # todo: not implemented
