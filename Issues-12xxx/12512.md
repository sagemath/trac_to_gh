There is a typo "dictionnary" at line 99, and a rogue non-ASCII character at line 130. At line 131, ` f.domain` should be in double backticks and "try" --> "tries".

Hi,

The patch applies well, the doc builds fine, the tests pass and the previous comments have been taken into account.

This is a very nice and useful patch, thank you.

You could add an example of a morphism without fixed points but with periodic points, for example:

```
sage: f = WordMorphism('a->b,b->c,c->ab') 
sage: f.fixed_points()                    
[]
sage: f.periodic_points()                 
[[word: abbcbccabbccabcababbcbccabcababbccababbc..., word: bccabcababbccababbcabbcbccabcababbcabbcb..., word: cababbcabbcbccababbcbccabbccabcababbcabb...]]
```

Hi Timo!

Actually there is yet such an example in the documentation of periodic_points a->bab, b->aa.
