I propose to modify the function padicprec() so that it computes itself the underlying prime number. Currently, one have:

```
sage: K = Qp(11,5)
sage: x = K(5)
sage: x
5 + O(11^5)
sage: y = pari(x)
sage: y.padicprec(11)
5
sage: y.padicprec(17)
  ***   not the same prime in padicprec.
  ***   Error in the PARI system. End of program.
```

I'm happy with this, but due to the amount I added, somebody else (anybody!) should sign off on it.
