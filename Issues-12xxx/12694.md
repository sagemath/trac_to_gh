```
The following SPKGs do not have a `src/` directory:

```
sage_scripts
extcode
libm4ri
sage_root
elliptic_curves
graphs
sage
polytopes_db
```
The sage spkgs are obviously supposed to be irregular (I guess) but the other four - `libm4ri`, `elliptic_curves`, `graphs`, and `polytopes_db` should follow the guidelines given in the developers' guide and have a `src/` directory.

Plus, I did a major refactoring of the SQLDatabase object in Sage last summer, and had to put some special cases in for the Graph's database (that could be fixed with this). In any case, I think this belongs in a separate ticket. For now, mark me as the maintainer of the graphs spkg.",

I would suggest this, it should reduce the size of the spkg, which is always a good thing, and it shouldn't take long to build. Plus, I did a major refactoring of the SQLDatabase object in Sage last summer, and had to put some special cases in for the Graph's database (that could be fixed with this). In any case, I think this belongs in a separate ticket. For now, mark me as the maintainer of the graphs spkg.
