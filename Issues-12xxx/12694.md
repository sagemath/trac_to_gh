```
The following SPKGs do not have a `src/` directory:

```
sage_scripts
extcode
libm4ri
sage_root
elliptic_curves
graphs
sage
polytopes_db
```
The sage spkgs are obviously supposed to be irregular (I guess) but the other four - `libm4ri`, `elliptic_curves`, `graphs`, and `polytopes_db` should follow the guidelines given in the developers' guide and have a `src/` directory.
