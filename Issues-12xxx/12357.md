Currently, the groupoid of an object P can not be garbage collected, even when deleting P.

Even worse: The persistence of `Groupoid(P)` also prevents P from being garbage collected.

The attached patch aims at solving it: An external reference to either P or `Groupoid(P)` is enough to keep both alive. But without an external reference, both P and `Groupoid(P)` become collectable.

Example from the docs:

```
            sage: P = GF(151)['x','y']
            sage: n = id(Groupoid(P))
            sage: import gc
            sage: _ = gc.collect()
            sage: n == id(Groupoid(P))   # indirect doctest
            True

        Thus, the groupoid is cached. But when deleting ``P``, its
        groupoid can be garbage collected as well::

            sage: del P
            sage: _ = gc.collect()
            sage: P = GF(151)['x','y']
            sage: n == id(Groupoid(P))
            False

        TESTS:

        We test against some corner cases::

            sage: Groupoid(None)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            TypeError: Groupoid of None is not defined
            sage: Groupoid(1)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            TypeError: 1 must either allow attribute assignment or be instances of <type 'sage.structure.parent.Parent'>
            sage: class A: pass
            sage: a = A()
            sage: Groupoid(a)
            Groupoid with underlying set <__main__.A instance at ...>
            sage: Groupoid(a) is Groupoid(a)
            True
```

Concerning timings:

Without the patch, the groupoid of P is stored in a dictionary, indexed by P. Hence, access to the cache is slow if `hash(P)` is slow.

Some data points:

```
sage: P = GF(151)['x','y']
sage: %timeit G = Groupoid(P)  # slow hash
625 loops, best of 3: 20.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit G = Groupoid(ZZ) # fast hash
625 loops, best of 3: 1.75 µs per loop
sage: class Bar(Parent): pass
....: 
sage: P = Bar()
sage: %timeit G = Groupoid(P)  # slow hash
625 loops, best of 3: 15.3 µs per loop
```

But with the patch, it is stored as an attribute of P. Hence, it is slow if attribute access is slow. The point is that even slow attribute access is faster than slow hash, and slow attribute access is only little slower than fast hash:

```
sage: P = GF(151)['x','y']
sage: %timeit G = Groupoid(P)  # slow attribute access
625 loops, best of 3: 3.11 µs per loop
sage: %timeit G = Groupoid(ZZ) # slow attribute access
625 loops, best of 3: 3.1 µs per loop
sage: class Bar(Parent): pass
....: 
sage: P = Bar()
sage: %timeit G = Groupoid(P)  # fast attribute access
625 loops, best of 3: 1.59 µs per loop
```

Hence, I believe that the patch is not only fixing a memory leak, but has the potential to generate a speed-up.

This is the simplest patch of the cache problems suite, and it does not depend on !#715, so I begin with this one.

I'm a little bit confused by all those tests for None in your patch.

Isn't the first one sufficient?

More specifically, the second test "if S is not None" isn't superfluous ?

And if it is not None, can G be None ? (I guess there is some cython voodoo involved here)

To answer my own question, I guess it is none if S is not a Parent (as in your example with 1).

Once you answer me back, I'll post a reviewer patch with some additional minor corrections.

Ok, I've posted a reviewer patch removing the second test and adding some comments on the code.

Everything is fine for me (as long as further modification in #715 and #12313 do not affect the ticket here).

So I'll put is as positive review now.

Moving this to sage-pending for now since it depends on two non-positively reviewed tickets.

There is a conflict with #11943.

- The ticket here is pending anyway
- #11943 has only one dependency, that is already merged
- #11943 is more fundamental than the patch here.

Therefore, I suggest to rebase my patch with respect to #11943.

The correct behavior here depends on the application of the three previous tickets, am I right ?
So I think its ok to have the three of them as dependencies (as there is no conflict to apply all of them).

Apart from my above remark, everything is fine on my install of beta13 plus #715, #11521, #12313, #11943 and this ticket.

The modified test is ok too.

From my point of view #715 (with #11521) and #12313 are needed to make the ticket here work, but the converse is not true.
And from a practical point of view, #11943 plus the ticket here can be applied before or after #715 and #12313 without conflicts.

So the dependencies look fine to me as they are now, I'm just adding #11521 because it now goes with #715.
I may also have missed something.

Rebasing everything to make all of that going the other way around seems to me to be a waste of time.

Unfortunalely, this regularly (not always but quite often) gives Segmentation Faults in `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/gal_reps.py` *after* the file has been tested:

```
$ ./sage -t --verbose "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/gal_reps.py"
[...]
4 items had no tests:
    __main__
    __main__.change_warning_output
    __main__.check_with_tolerance
    __main__.warning_function
25 items passed all tests:
  26 tests in __main__.example_0
[...]
  10 tests in __main__.example_9
263 tests in 29 items.
263 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.
Segmentation fault
         [21.5 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t --verbose "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/gal_reps.py"
Total time for all tests: 21.6 seconds
```

This is with sage-5.1.beta4 + #12357 (beta4 is not yet released, but essentially finished).

Jeroen, does the segmentation fault persists, now that #715 seems fine due to Cython upgrade?

Anyway, I am now running make ptest with MALLOCK_CHECK_=3 on sage-5.6.rc0 debug version (#13864) plus #12215, #12313 and #12357.

```
sage: class MyParent(UniqueRepresentation, Parent):
....:     pass
....: 
sage: P = MyParent()
sage: import gc
sage: m = id(P)
sage: n = id(Groupoid(P)) 
sage: m in map(id, gc.get_objects()) 
True
sage: n in map(id, gc.get_objects()) 
True
sage: del P
sage: _ = gc.collect() 
sage: m in map(id, gc.get_objects()) 
False
sage: n in map(id, gc.get_objects()) 
False
```

What do you think?

By the way, the timeout is no problem: I had closed my laptop during the tests. Hence, the tests were interrupted, but the time was running.
