Almost any square symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix A over a field can be decomposed into a lower triangular matrix L and a diagonal matrix D such that  A = L*D*L-transpose, suitably adjusted in the Hermitian case.

1) This is of interest for its own sake (eg for solving systems).

2) If the field has square roots and the diagonal matrix has positive entries, then the Cholesky decomposition is easy.  This would fix #11274.

3) This will give a good way to tell if a matrix is positive definite.

Draft 1 patch is mostly for safe-keeping.  It "works" but needs an option for failure mode - zero diagonals versus negative diagonals.  Underscore method will then be used to address the three items above - (1) on this ticket, (2) on the bug ticket, and (3) somewhere.

For the documentation:

* lines 10040-10042: Probably need one more space for perfect alignment.
* line 10292: I don't understand the reference to RDF/CDF - how can they be used if they are not exact?

Implementation-wise, I don't understand why error-handling is delegated to calling functions - checking for square matrices seems natural before the actual computation, detecting absence of the fraction field seems to be repeated and I don't understand at all what is accomplished by

```
except ValueError as e: 
    raise ValueError(e)
```
can't it just be deleted without any effect on the behaviour? It seems to me that the only real work for non-underscore method is to convert `d` to a vector (which probably addressed my first comment on the documentation). It seems to me that either this can be the only thing left in this function with error-checking going to the underscore method or even the conversion can go there and we end up with a single function.

Replying to [novoselt](#comment%3A5):
Andrey,

Thanks for the comments.   The underscore method will also power an "is_positive_definite" method and a new (fixed) "cholesky_decompsition" method.  I was trying to isolate common functionality in the underscore method.  I was also trying to have errors be actually reported out of the calling functions.

In particular, indefinite factorization will fail if there is a zero computed for the diagonal.  But this is also an indicator of a non-positive-definite matrix, so I want to catch that error and convert it to a False return.  I'm still uncertain about how Cholesky will be employing this routine.
