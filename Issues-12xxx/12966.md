Almost any square symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix A over a field can be decomposed into a lower triangular matrix L and a diagonal matrix D such that  A = L*D*L-transpose, suitably adjusted in the Hermitian case.

1) This is of interest for its own sake (eg for solving systems).

2) If the field has square roots and the diagonal matrix has positive entries, then the Cholesky decomposition is easy.  This would fix #11274.

3) This will give a good way to tell if a matrix is positive definite.

Implementation-wise, I don't understand why error-handling is delegated to calling functions - checking for square matrices seems natural before the actual computation, detecting absence of the fraction field seems to be repeated and I don't understand at all what is accomplished by

```
except ValueError as e:

Replying to [@novoselt](#comment:5):
Andrey,

Thanks for the comments.   The underscore method will also power an "is_positive_definite" method and a new (fixed) "cholesky_decompsition" method.  I was trying to isolate common functionality in the underscore method.  I was also trying to have errors be actually reported out of the calling functions.

In particular, indefinite factorization will fail if there is a zero computed for the diagonal.  But this is also an indicator of a non-positive-definite matrix, so I want to catch that error and convert it to a False return.  I'm still uncertain about how Cholesky will be employing this routine.

Attachment: **[trac_12966-indefinite-factorization-v2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12966/trac_12966-indefinite-factorization-v2.patch.gz)**

Reworked with a cleaner separation.  Error-checking and tests are in the underscore method, making the regular call much shorter an I think the two following routines will work better also.

By the way Rob - `"{0} and {1}".format(a ,b)` is the same as `"{} and {}".format(a, b)`, so you don't have to keep track of numbers.
