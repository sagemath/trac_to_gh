This is an issue for building on non-gnu compilers. While not perfect, a solution for this is to use std::vector.

We now need a new spkg (based on that of #12681) incorporating this patch.

Wonder whether we should submit it upstream; I personally would (currently) only apply the patch if `$CC` is *not* GCC.

By now, ... if **`$CXX`** is not GCC's C++ compiler.

(We shouldn't literally check `$CXX` for `g++`, but instead do something like `if ! $CXX --version | grep g++ >/dev/null; then # apply patch`.

I haven't really pushed this ticket (which I think is important) since it is significant enough change to report upstream, which I have yet to get around to.

I also think that the makefile patch you've made should be submitted to upstream.

Ok, so I've now created 7 new patches to fix all remaining clang/non-GNU/C++11 issues with Lcalc (except for some deprecation warnings):

```
Makefile_2-dont_compile_C_with_CXXFLAGS.patch
lcalc-1.23-fix_VLA_1.patch
lcalc-1.23-fix_VLA_2.patch
lcalc-1.23-fix_control_reaches_end_of_non-void_fn.patch
lcalc-1.23-fix_typeof.patch
lcalc-1.23-missing_return_type.patch
lcalc-1.23_default_parameters_2.patch
```

But I'd prefer to put them on a single ticket, i.e., to either open a new one, or repurpose one of the two existing ones.  (But before doing so, I'll anyway polish them a bit, and probably merge some of them into another or into one of the existing ones.)

I did take a slightly different approach to variable-length arrays; instead of using `std::vector<>`, I'm using `foo_t *_foo = new foo_t[dim1*dim2*dim3]`, along with a macro `foo(i,j,k)` which maps the indices to a single one, and of course added `delete [] _foo` where necessary.

So far tested with GCC 4.4, 4.8 and 4.9, clang 3.4.1, and a couple of `-std=...` variations.

We should probably fix the remaining issues (*including VLAs*) on #12437, and close this ticket as a duplicate.

Or fix VLAs here, and let #12437 depend on this ticket.
