This is an issue for building on non-gnu compilers. While not perfect, a solution for this is to use std::vector.

I've posted an spkg with this solution (fixes #12435, #12437) at  [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/lcalc-1.23.p10.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/lcalc-1.23.p10.spkg).

By now, ... if **`$CXX`** is not GCC's C++ compiler.

(We shouldn't literally check `$CXX` for `g++`, but instead do something like `if ! $CXX --version | grep g++ >/dev/null; then # apply patch`.  Apparently the output depends of the filename of the executable btw., which shouldn't hurt since applying the patch is ok for `g++` as well; looking for "GCC" in contrast could give false positives, since some other compilers might report with what they've been built, too.)

I haven't really pushed this ticket (which I think is important) since it is significant enough change to report upstream, which I have yet to get around to.

I also think that the makefile patch you've made should be submitted to upstream.

I did take a slightly different approach to variable-length arrays; instead of using `std::vector<>`, I'm using `foo_t *_foo = new foo_t[dim1*dim2*dim3]`, along with a macro `foo(i,j,k)` which maps the indices to a single one, and of course added `delete [] _foo` where necessary.

So far tested with GCC 4.4, 4.8 and 4.9, clang 3.4.1, and a couple of `-std=...` variations.
