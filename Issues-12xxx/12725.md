```
The install scripts for PARI and Python automatically link with `-lncurses` if `/usr/lib/libncurses.so` **exists**, even though the mere existence of that file doesn't guarantee that it actually can be linked.  This can happen in particular when "cross-compiling" a 32-bit Sage on a 64-bit operating system.

The build of the readline interface of PARI and Python might therefore fail for no good reason.  A solution is to symlink Sage's `libtermcap.a` to `libncurses.a` if needed, such that `-lncurses` will always succeed.

Reported upstream to Python: [http://bugs.python.org/issue15182](http://bugs.python.org/issue15182)

For PARI, this seems to be fixed in PARI-2.6.0 (but I haven't checked well).

The usual way to address the problem is to install the corresponding
development package (for ncurses).  Overwriting the shared library
will break various programs that are linked against the existing
library.

I'm only talking about the *static* library archive (`libncurses.a`).  This cannot break existing programs.

But that would break builds of other applications which used the static library.
Also, applications using the bundled termcap library would behave differently
from those which use the ncurses library (unless Sage happened to update its
termcap source file - last I recalled it was more than ten years out of date).

The new spkg is more clever: it only makes the symbolic link for `libncurses.a` if linking against `-lncurses` doesn't work.

Needs review.

Generically ok (given the explanation that it would only be used in a build-tree, not updating the system area).

However, 1.3.1.p3 is dated, and its termcap.src file is a nuisance due to the large number of differences versus ncurses.  I've noticed that Redhat's equivalent package for termcap uses the termcap.src file which I generate from ncurses.  See http://invisible-island.net/datafiles/current/termcap.src.gz for comparison.
