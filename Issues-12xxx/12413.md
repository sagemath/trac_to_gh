The following crashes Sage 4.8 on OS X 10.6.8 with a mysterious message:

```
sage: Y = (GF(3)^1)/(GF(3)^1)
sage: Y((1,))
lda must be >= MAX(N,1): lda=0 N=0Parameter 7 to routine cblas_sgemv was incorrect
Mac OS BLAS parameter error in cblas_sgemv, parameter #0, (unavailable), is 0
d-69-91-159-193:devel Starx$
```

I have not yet been able to find the error, the problem may be with a call to LinBox, as discussed here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/30bfc9922b26f3d7 but I am not yet sure.

I can reproduce it with sage-5.0.beta1 on Fedora 16. The problem is in vector-matrix multiplication:

```
sage: vector(GF(3),[1]) * matrix(GF(3),[[]]) 
lda must be >= MAX(N,1): lda=0 N=0Parameter 7 to routine cblas_sgemv was incorrect
```
Note that the matrix is of the wrong size, but the coercion model will try it out to see if any error is raised.

We should definitely raise an error when multiplying matrix/vector of incompatible size, and not just return a zero matrix. Maybe after you got some sleep? :-)

Hi, 

but `A = matrix(GF(3),[[]])` is a 1 x 0 matrix and `v = vector(GF(3),[1])` a vector of length 1. Hence, we do linear combination of the row of the matrix, which happens to have 0 columns. That seems correct to me?

Good catch. I updated the patch. It now returns:

```
sage: v = vector(GF(3),[]) * matrix(GF(3),0,1,[]); v
(0)
```

Is this what we want? I get confused with these zero row/column matrices.

I agree that the dimensions in the previous comment are correct.

Here is yet another crasher:

```
sage: matrix(GF(3),0,0,[]) * vector(GF(3),[])
lda must be >= MAX(N,1): lda=0 N=4194304Parameter 7 to routine cblas_sgemv was incorrect
```

I suggest we add the following to the doctests:

```
sage: v0 = vector(GF(3),[])
sage: v1 = vector(GF(3),[1])
sage: m00 = matrix(GF(3),0,0,[])
sage: m01 = matrix(GF(3),0,1,[])
sage: m10 = matrix(GF(3),1,0,[])
sage: m11 = matrix(GF(3),1,1,[1])
sage: good = [ (v0,m00), (v0,m01), (v1,m10), (v1,m11), (m00,v0), (m10,v0), (m01,v1), (m11,v1) ]
sage: for v,m in good:
...       print v, 'x', m, '=', v*m              
...
sage: bad  = [ (v1,m00), (v1,m01), (v0,m10), (v0,m11), (m00,v1), (m10,v1), (m01,v0), (m11,v0) ]
sage: for v,m in bad:
...       try:
...           v*m
...           print 'Uncaught dimension mismatch!'
