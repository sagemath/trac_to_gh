The following crashes Sage 4.8 on OS X 10.6.8 with a mysterious message:

```
sage: Y = (GF(3)^1)/(GF(3)^1)
sage: Y((1,))
lda must be >= MAX(N,1): lda=0 N=0Parameter 7 to routine cblas_sgemv was incorrect
Mac OS BLAS parameter error in cblas_sgemv, parameter #0, (unavailable), is 0
d-69-91-159-193:devel Starx$
```

I have not yet been able to find the error, the problem may be with a call to LinBox, as discussed here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/30bfc9922b26f3d7 but I am not yet sure.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

I can reproduce it with sage-5.0.beta1 on Fedora 16. The problem is in vector-matrix multiplication:

```
sage: vector(GF(3),[1]) * matrix(GF(3),[[]]) 
lda must be >= MAX(N,1): lda=0 N=0Parameter 7 to routine cblas_sgemv was incorrect
```
Note that the matrix is of the wrong size, but the coercion model will try it out to see if any error is raised.

Hi, 

but `A = matrix(GF(3),[[]])` is a 1 x 0 matrix and `v = vector(GF(3),[1])` a vector of length 1. Hence, we do linear combination of the row of the matrix, which happens to have 0 columns. That seems correct to me?

I agree that the dimensions in the previous comment are correct.

Here is yet another crasher:

```
sage: matrix(GF(3),0,0,[]) * vector(GF(3),[])
lda must be >= MAX(N,1): lda=0 N=4194304Parameter 7 to routine cblas_sgemv was incorrect
```

I suggest we add the following to the doctests:

```
sage: v0 = vector(GF(3),[])
sage: v1 = vector(GF(3),[1])
sage: m00 = matrix(GF(3),0,0,[])
sage: m01 = matrix(GF(3),0,1,[])

Thanks for kicking my butt to do this properly. I've updated the patch accordingly.

However, I noticed that

```
sage: A = matrix(GF(3),1,0,[]) * matrix(GF(3),1,0,[])
sage: A.nrows()
1
sage: A.ncols()
0
```

which seems wrong. If you agree, I'll raise the issue on [sage-devel].
