The following crashes Sage 4.8 on OS X 10.6.8 with a mysterious message:

```
sage: Y = (GF(3)^1)/(GF(3)^1)
sage: Y((1,))
lda must be >= MAX(N,1): lda=0 N=0Parameter 7 to routine cblas_sgemv was incorrect
Mac OS BLAS parameter error in cblas_sgemv, parameter #0, (unavailable), is 0
d-69-91-159-193:devel Starx$
```

I have not yet been able to find the error, the problem may be with a call to LinBox, as discussed here: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/30bfc9922b26f3d7 but I am not yet sure.

I can reproduce it with sage-5.0.beta1 on Fedora 16. The problem is in vector-matrix multiplication:

```
sage: vector(GF(3),[1]) * matrix(GF(3),[[]]) 
lda must be >= MAX(N,1): lda=0 N=0Parameter 7 to routine cblas_sgemv was incorrect
```
Note that the matrix is of the wrong size, but the coercion model will try it out to see if any error is raised.

Hi, 

but `A = matrix(GF(3),[[]])` is a 1 x 0 matrix and `v = vector(GF(3),[1])` a vector of length 1. Hence, we do linear combination of the row of the matrix, which happens to have 0 columns. That seems correct to me?

Good catch. I updated the patch. It now returns:

Is this what we want? I get confused with these zero row/column matrices.

I agree that the dimensions in the previous comment are correct.

Here is yet another crasher:

```
sage: matrix(GF(3),0,0,[]) * vector(GF(3),[])
lda must be >= MAX(N,1): lda=0 N=4194304Parameter 7 to routine cblas_sgemv was incorrect
```

I suggest we add the following to the doctests:

```
sage: v0 = vector(GF(3),[])
sage: v1 = vector(GF(3),[1])
sage: m00 = matrix(GF(3),0,0,[])
sage: m01 = matrix(GF(3),0,1,[])
sage: m10 = matrix(GF(3),1,0,[])
sage: m11 = matrix(GF(3),1,1,[1])
sage: good = [ (v0,m00), (v0,m01), (v1,m10), (v1,m11), (m00,v0), (m10,v0), (m01,v1), (m11,v1) ]
sage: for v,m in good:
...       print v, 'x', m, '=', v*m              
...

Thanks for kicking my butt to do this properly. I've updated the patch accordingly.

However, I noticed that

```
sage: A = matrix(GF(3),1,0,[]) * matrix(GF(3),1,0,[])
sage: A.nrows()
1
sage: A.ncols()
0
```

which seems wrong. If you agree, I'll raise the issue on [sage-devel].

The shapes don't match in `matrix(GF(3),1,0,[]) * matrix(GF(3),1,0,[])`, so it is a bug that no error is raised.
