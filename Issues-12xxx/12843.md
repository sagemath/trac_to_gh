I started to review the two spkg's. `zeromq-2.2.0.p0.spkg` installs successfully. I unpacked and re-packaged using `sage-pkg` without problems. I did see some tmp files lying around:

* SPKG.txt~
* spkg-install~

and `pyzmq-2.1.11.p0.spkg` has:

* SPKG.txt~

After install `import zmq` works and I experimented with some simple examples from the ZMQ guide. 

---

If anyone wants to do some simple testing, you can grab the client and server scripts in: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/bjones/sage-devel/zmq/, open two terminals and run:

1st terminal:

```
sage -python hwserver.py
```

2nd terminal:

```
sage -python hwclient.py
```

Sorry, looks like we missed in zeromq:

* .hgignore~

The pyzmq spkg looks good.

What's the procedure, after a positive review? A sage-devel vote on inclusion of the packages as standard?

First it should optional for some time, usually.  So a vote to make it optional would usually be next.

I updated the zeromq spkg to remove the .hgignore~

I'll change this ticket to say "make optional package" and we can take it to sage-devel from there. We don't need to vote on that, only to make it standard.
