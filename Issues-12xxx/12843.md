The single cell server already requires zeromq+pyzmq, and the ordinary notebook server probably will soon. Since they are also useful to work with any kind of distributed memory machines, we should just make them default spkgs. They are also pretty small, about 2MB altogether.

These spkgs are based on version that William created in January 2011, but updated to the newest upstream version and include a SPKG.txt:

I started to review the two spkg's. `zeromq-2.2.0.p0.spkg` installs successfully. I unpacked and re-packaged using `sage-pkg` without problems. I did see some tmp files lying around:

* SPKG.txt~
* spkg-install~

and `pyzmq-2.1.11.p0.spkg` has:

* SPKG.txt~

After install `import zmq` works and I experimented with some simple examples from the ZMQ guide. 

---

If anyone wants to do some simple testing, you can grab the client and server scripts in: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/bjones/sage-devel/zmq/, open two terminals and run:

1st terminal:

```
sage -python hwserver.py
```

2nd terminal:

```
sage -python hwclient.py
```

Sorry, looks like we missed in zeromq:

The pyzmq spkg looks good.

What's the procedure, after a positive review? A sage-devel vote on inclusion of the packages as standard?

I'll change this ticket to say "make optional package" and we can take it to sage-devel from there. We don't need to vote on that, only to make it standard.
