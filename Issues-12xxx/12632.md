```
sage: G1 = DirichletGroup(4)
sage: G2 = DirichletGroup(1)
sage: G2[0] == G1[0].primitive_character()
[...]
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```

(The answer should be `True`.)

What happens, I think, is that `G1[0].primitive_character().parent().base_ring()` is not the same as `G2.base_ring()` and something somewhere tries to do some coercion, and fails:

```
sage: G1[0].primitive_character().parent().base_ring()
Cyclotomic Field of order 2 and degree 1
sage: G2.base_ring()
Cyclotomic Field of order 1 and degree 1
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>Attachment [trac_12632-cyclo_coerce_bug.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket12632/trac_12632-cyclo_coerce_bug.patch) by @loefflerd created at 2012-03-06 09:06:27

This was indeed a coercion issue -- the basic error is this:

```
sage: K1 = CyclotomicField(1)
sage: K2 = CyclotomicField(2)
sage: K1.has_coerce_map_from(K2) # boom!
```
I've uploaded a patch which deals summarily with this special case by adding a couple of lines to the cyclotomic field coercion code, and adds a doctest to prove it.
