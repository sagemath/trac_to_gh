Needed for upgrade to Python 2.7.2 (#9958).  There is a problem with the math block in

```
    def annihilator(self,d, dim = False):
        """
        Return (if it exists) an annihilator of the boolean function of
        degree at most `d`, that is a Boolean polynomial `g` such that

        .. math::

            f(x)g(x) = 0 \forall x.

```
This results in

```
docstring of sage.crypto.boolean_function:4: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```

Note that the warning does not at all refer to the function "annihilator".  I had to do a binary search in the .pyx file to find where the problem lies.

Have you tried the raw mode? That fixed a similar problem mentioned in #9608.

Yeah, that is weird... [this](http://docs.python.org/release/2.7.2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals) is where it shows up, but `\f` has been one of these for quite a while... because I always have to do `\\frac` when using labels in plots :)
