K.<t>=GF(13)

is_PrimeField(K) 

causes:

ImportError: No module named finite_field.constructor 


There is already a function is_PrimeFiniteField.

Also, the module should be: sage.rings.finite_rings.constructor

I'll fix this.

From your patch:

```
	    INPUT: 
	        - R - a ring or field 
	 
	    OUTPUT: 
	        - TRUE - if R is QQ or a finite field GF(p) for p prime. 
	        - FALSE - otherwise 
```

This isn't correct ReST formatting (building this will give a warning about "unexpected indent"). Moreover Python's booleans are ` True / False `, not ` TRUE / FALSE ` (it's rude to shout :-) So it would be better as

```
    INPUT:
 
    - R - a ring or field 
 
    OUTPUT: 

    - True - if R is `\QQ` or a finite field `GF(p)` for p prime. 
    - False - otherwise 
```
Note the blank line after the list headings, no extra indentation (not needed for bulleted lists), and the backticks for LaTeX formulae (<code>\`\QQ\`</code> is a predefined macro).

Sorry to torture you so much over one tiny (and deprecated!) function...

No problem. I figured the first thing I tried to fix in Sage should be something simple so I can learn the devel process and the trac system, etc.

For example, when I uploaded the new patch this time I neglected to check the overwrite box and now I can't delete the old patch.

trac_12753_is_PrimeField.2.patch  - is the correct patch, ignore the first one.
