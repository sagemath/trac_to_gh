The `__add__()` method of plots doesn't make any attempt to preserve legend options. This will show the default legend:

```
sage: p1 = plot(x, x, 0, 1, legend_label='foo')             
sage: p1.set_legend_options(back_color='white', shadow=True)
sage: p2 = p1 + p1                                          
sage: p2._Graphics__legend_opts                             
{}
```

We do preserve some other information, so it should be easy to add this.

This is a nice improvement, but the patch does not apply for me on Sage-5.0.rc0. Either it has to be rebased, or there are some dependencies.
