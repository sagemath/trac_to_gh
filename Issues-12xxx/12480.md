On OS X 10.7 (compiled with gcc-4.6.2, #12369):

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pyx # Killed/crashed
```

This is because executing the following code (from the file `devel/sage/sage/rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pyx`):

```
R = Zp(5,5)
S.<x> = R[]
f = x^5 + 75*x^3 - 15*x^2 +125*x - 5
W.<w> = R.ext(f)
pol = ntl.ZZ_pX([5^40,5^42,3*5^41], 5^44)
W(pol, relprec = 0)
```
crashes Sage:

This is a huge can of worms.  The relevant code is in `sage/rings/padics/pow_computer_ext.pyx`:

```
    cdef ntl_ZZ_pContext_class get_context(self, long n):
        """
        Returns the context for p^n.

        Note that this function will raise an Index error if n > self.cache_limit.
        Also, it will return None on input 0
        [...]
        """
        if n < 0:
            n = -n
        try:
            return self.c[n]
        except IndexError:
            return PowComputer_ZZ_pX.get_context(self, n)

```
**On input 0, we have a `Py_None` typecast to a `ntl_ZZ_pContext_class`** and we pretend like that's okay.  How does this make sense?  The fact that it crashes on OS X 10.7 is expected, the surprising thing is that this doesn't crash on other systems.

The `None` in the `self.c[]` array comes from line 1671 in `pow_computer_ext.pyx`:

```
            self.c.append(None)
            for i from 1 <= i <= cache_limit:
                self.c.append(PowComputer_ZZ_pX.get_context(self,i))
```

I don't see why this is an argument for `RuntimeError` instead of `ValueError`.

How would you like `SystemError` instead?  Of all standard Python exceptions, it seems to be the closest equivalent to what you want: [http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.SystemError](http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.SystemError)

Sorry: I wasn't getting trac notifications on this ticket for some reason.

The changes look good, except the removal of the three checks for n < 0 in `pow_mpz_t_tmp` and `pow_ZZ_tmp` where a ValueError is raised.  While I understand that Cython will ignore those errors, I think the right option is to open another ticket and modify what is done, rather than just removing the checks.  With these changes it's easier for these functions to segfault on incorrect input.
