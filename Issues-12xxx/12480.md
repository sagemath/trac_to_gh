On OS X 10.7 (compiled with gcc-4.6.2, #12369):

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pyx # Killed/crashed
```

This is because executing the following code (from the file `devel/sage/sage/rings/padics/padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pyx`):

```
R = Zp(5,5)
S.<x> = R[]
f = x^5 + 75*x^3 - 15*x^2 +125*x - 5
W.<w> = R.ext(f)
pol = ntl.ZZ_pX([5^40,5^42,3*5^41], 5^44)
W(pol, relprec = 0)
```

This is a huge can of worms.  The relevant code is in `sage/rings/padics/pow_computer_ext.pyx`:

```
    cdef ntl_ZZ_pContext_class get_context(self, long n):
        """
        Returns the context for p^n.

        Note that this function will raise an Index error if n > self.cache_limit.
        Also, it will return None on input 0
        [...]
        """
        if n < 0:
            n = -n
        try:
            return self.c[n]
        except IndexError:
            return PowComputer_ZZ_pX.get_context(self, n)

```
**On input 0, we have a `Py_None` typecast to a `ntl_ZZ_pContext_class`** and we pretend like that's okay.  How does this make sense?  The fact that it crashes on OS X 10.7 is expected, the surprising thing is that this doesn't crash on other systems.

The `None` in the `self.c[]` array comes from line 1671 in `pow_computer_ext.pyx`:

```
            self.c.append(None)
            for i from 1 <= i <= cache_limit:
                self.c.append(PowComputer_ZZ_pX.get_context(self,i))
```

I don't see why this is an argument for `RuntimeError` instead of `ValueError`.

How would you like `SystemError` instead?  Of all standard Python exceptions, it seems to be the closest equivalent to what you want: [http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.SystemError](http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.SystemError)
