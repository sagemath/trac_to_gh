Since `gcc-4.6.2` has `mpc` as dependency and since `mpc` could be useful for the rest of Sage, it would be good to include mpc as standard package.  There already is an optional `mpc` package.  I also upgraded `mpc` to the latest svn version (the latest stable version has various bugs in `./configure` causing for example failures on Solaris).

---

I added one patch to remove the compiler flag `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` (which causes build failures on some systems due to an outdated `glibc`).  Reported and fixed upstream: [https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=14070](https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=14070)

I've tested just the patch from #12223, the [12515_mpc_standard](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/12515/12515_mpc_standard.patch) patch and the install of [mpc-0.9.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/mpc-0.9.spkg) on top of sage-5.0.beta4. I have one failure:

```
sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/rings/complex_mpc.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "/storage/sage/sage-5.0.beta4/devel/sage-main/sage/rings/complex_mpc.pyx", line 559:
    sage: MPComplexField(10).random_element()
Expected:
    0.12 + 0.23*I
Got:
    0.75 + 0.12*I
**********************************************************************
```
The relevant portions of the test from complex_mpc.pyx are:

```
sage: from sage.rings.complex_mpc import MPComplexField
sage: MPComplexField(100).random_element(-5, 10)
sage: MPComplexField(10).random_element()
```
which, from the sage prompt give results that are all over the place, although there is only the indicated failure when the test is repeatedly run individually. I'm not sure how one really knows what the "expected" result really is? Now this was on x86.

About the CFLAGS, CC stuff you could add some logic as in the mpir package.

This would let the user break its system if he really wants to.

You could also add the "SAGE... undefined on top of spkg-check.

If at some point we allow to run the testsuite without rebuilding the package, it would avoid another trivial new spkg update.

Not sure why you removed the error message in spg-check.

Ok, MPC will already complain about failing, but it will also do so while building, configuring and so on, won't it?

I cannot test the spkg on exotic architectures, i.e. mainly Solaris, so that I don't put it as positive review.

Otherwise the package looks fine for me now, so  Jeroen, if you tested it on such architectures, you can go ahead and do it.

I tried to apply 12515_mpc_sage_root.patch to the root directory, but it failed.

I started with sage-5.0.beta7 and have

Wende Patch auf Datei spkg/install an

12602_spkg_download.patch
10492_deps_to_Makefile.patch
12515_mpc_sage_root.patch
```
Indeed, the spkg/install file looks totally different to what is expected in the patch:

```
...
MAXIMA=`$newest maxima`
export MAXIMA

MERCURIAL=`$newest mercurial`
export MERCURIAL

MPFI=`$newest mpfi`
export MPFI

MOIN=`$newest moin`
export MOIN

MPFR=`$newest mpfr`
export MPFR

MPMATH=`$newest mpmath`
export MPMATH

NETWORKX=`$newest networkx`
export NETWORKX

NUMPY=`$newest numpy`
export NUMPY
...
```

Is there a dependency that is not stated here?
