Since `gcc-4.6.2` has `mpc` as dependency and since `mpc` could be useful for the rest of Sage, it would be good to include mpc as standard package.  There already is an optional `mpc` package.  I also upgraded `mpc` to the latest svn version (the latest stable version has various bugs in `./configure` causing for example failures on Solaris).

I added one patch to remove the compiler flag `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` (which causes build failures on some systems due to an outdated `glibc`).

I've tested just the patch from #12223, the [12515_mpc_standard](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12515/12515_mpc_standard.patch.gz) patch and the install of [mpc-0.9.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/mpc-0.9.spkg) on top of sage-5.0.beta4. I have one failure:

```
sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/rings/complex_mpc.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "/storage/sage/sage-5.0.beta4/devel/sage-main/sage/rings/complex_mpc.pyx", line 559:

    0.12 + 0.23*I
Got:
    0.75 + 0.12*I
**********************************************************************
```
The relevant portions of the test from complex_mpc.pyx are:

```
sage: from sage.rings.complex_mpc import MPComplexField
sage: MPComplexField(100).random_element(-5, 10)
sage: MPComplexField(10).random_element()
```
which, from the sage prompt give results that are all over the place, although there is only the indicated failure when the test is repeatedly run individually. I'm not sure how one really knows what the "expected" result really is? Now this was on x86.

I just completed a build from scratch of 5.0.beta4 with mpc-0.9 just prior to the spkg upgrade. Argh ... So I patched the sage and sage_scripts spkgs before the build. SAGE_ROOT was then patched before the make. Everything from #10492 and #12223 and this ticket was included. Everything built (including mpc) and the tests passed. The new spkg (mpc-1.0.0dev1123) was installed with sage -f and all the tests under sage/rings passed - I only did these again. A positive review here, although I don't see that that's the next action?

About the CFLAGS, CC stuff you could add some logic as in the mpir package.

This would let the user break its system if he really wants to.

You could also add the "SAGE... undefined on top of spkg-check.

If at some point we allow to run the testsuite without rebuilding the package, it would avoid another trivial new spkg update.

Not sure why you removed the error message in spg-check.

Ok, MPC will already complain about failing, but it will also do so while building, configuring and so on, won't it?

I cannot test the spkg on exotic architectures, i.e. mainly Solaris, so that I don't put it as positive review.

Otherwise the package looks fine for me now, so  Jeroen, if you tested it on such architectures, you can go ahead and do it.

Jean-Pierre, it is never a requirement to test spkgs on "exotic architectures" in order to give positive review to a ticket (unless the ticket is specifically about fixing something on such an architecture).  If there are problems with building a spkg, those will be discovered when the build is tested on the buildbots.

Sorry for the delay. I had other stuff applied on top of mpc (twisted, jmol, flask) and it wasn't convenient to remove things. I didn't think it was the patches, but perhaps the mpc spkg.

I tried to apply 12515_mpc_sage_root.patch to the root directory, but it failed.

I started with sage-5.0.beta7 and have

```
simon@linux-sqwp:~/SAGE/sage-5.0.beta7> hg qpush
Wende 12515_mpc_sage_root.patch an
Wende Patch auf Datei spkg/install an
FEHLSCHLAG von Teilstück #1 in Zeile 179
1 von 1 Teilstücken sind FEHLGESCHLAGEN -- speichere Ausschuss in Datei spkg/install.rej
Patch schlug fehl und Fortsetzung unmöglich (versuche -v)
Patch schlug fehl, Fehlerabschnitte noch im Arbeitsverzeichnis
Fehler beim Anwenden. Bitte beheben und 12515_mpc_sage_root.patch aktualisieren
simon@linux-sqwp:~/SAGE/sage-5.0.beta7> hg qapplied 
12602_spkg_download.patch
10492_deps_to_Makefile.patch
12515_mpc_sage_root.patch
```
Indeed, the spkg/install file looks totally different to what is expected in the patch:

```
...
MAXIMA=`$newest maxima`
export MAXIMA

MERCURIAL=`$newest mercurial`
export MERCURIAL

MPFI=`$newest mpfi`
export MPFI

MOIN=`$newest moin`
export MOIN

MPFR=`$newest mpfr`
export MPFR

MPMATH=`$newest mpmath`
export MPMATH

NETWORKX=`$newest networkx`
export NETWORKX

NUMPY=`$newest numpy`
export NUMPY
...
```

Is there a dependency that is not stated here?
