In a class on computer algebra, students were surprised by the behavior of the N() function. Here are some minimal examples that should illustrate the issues we ran into:

```
sage: x=N(pi,digits=3); x
3.14  
sage: y=N(3.14,digits=3); y
3.14  
sage: x==y
False
```

```
sage: N(pi,digits=1)
3.2
```

```
sage: N(pi-3,prec=2)
0.00
```

Imo, none of these is a bug, but I believe that the documentation should be improved.

Yes, I'll create another patch.

However, could you change the wording from "numerical instability"? This suggests there is something wrong. I like how Julian Rüth explained it: "This approximates both pi and 3 with two bits of precision and then computes their difference".

I think "numerical instability" refers to propagation of errors in numerical algorithms, which is not what is occurring here. According to the sage-devel thread it is the intended behaviour, although perhaps unintuitive.
