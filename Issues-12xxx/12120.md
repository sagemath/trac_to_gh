In a class on computer algebra, students were surprised by the behavior of the N() function. Here are some minimal examples that should illustrate the issues we ran into:

```
sage: x=N(pi,digits=3); x
3.14  
sage: y=N(3.14,digits=3); y
3.14  
sage: x==y
False
```

```
sage: N(pi,digits=1)
3.2
```

```
sage: N(pi-3,prec=2)
0.00
```

Imo, none of these is a bug, but I believe that the documentation should be improved.

Hi, looks nice!  This will be quite valuable.  Note that `Trac #11647` should probably use the new style of <code>:trac:\`11647\`</code>.

I like the following reviewer patch; to me, it clarifies one or two things.  If you think I've misstated them, let me know.  If it's fine with you, then click positive review!

Also, I think that #11647 probably should count as a dup of this.  My guess is that there is no way to ensure at least one correct digit without occasionally bringing along a second for the ride.

Eviatar, feel free to open that sanity check ticket as well.
