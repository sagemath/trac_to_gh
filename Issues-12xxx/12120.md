In a class on computer algebra, students were surprised by the behavior of the N() function. Here are some minimal examples that should illustrate the issues we ran into:

```
sage: x=N(pi,digits=3); x
3.14  
sage: y=N(3.14,digits=3); y
3.14  
sage: x==y
False
```

```
sage: N(pi,digits=1)
3.2
```

```
sage: N(pi-3,prec=2)
0.00
```

Imo, none of these is a bug, but I believe that the documentation should be improved.
