It appears it is stuck in /local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.pyc at

   4904             for j in range(i):
-> 4905                 if p > random():

This is the same behavior as 

```
random_DAG(5, 0)
```

It appears p=1/2 from the definition of random_DAG is evaluated to 0 (so there are no possible connections), hence p = 0.5 should fix it.

Can you please check what happens, with your patch applied, to the command

sage: random_DAG(5,p=0)

I suspect that the problem is not only the fact that 1/2=0, but also that the program fails when p=0.

Indeed, the algorithm is an infinite loop when p=0.

What behaviour should be expected for p=0 ?

Maybe one should add an assumption : 

assert p>0 and p<1, "The probability p=%s should satisfy 0<p<1." %p

<div id="comment:15" align="right">comment:15</div>

Hello,

The patch needs further improvements.

1) The test on p should be improved since I can give p=2 without error. For instance,

```
if p < 0 or p > 1:
   raise ValueError('The parameter p must be in [0..1].')
```

2) A test is needed for parameter weight_max:

```
sage: random_DAG(5, .5, -1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
...
ValueError: empty range for randrange() (1,0, -1)
```
and

```
sage: random_DAG(5, .5, .5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
...
ValueError: non-integer stop for randrange()
```

3) It should be clearly indicated in the documentation that the function returns a dictionary storing the edges of the DAG.

4) The resulting number of vertices is not n but n+1:

```
sage: d = DiGraph(random_DAG(5, .5))
sage: d
Digraph on 6 vertices
```

5) I don't understand why this digraph generator is not part of ```sage.graphs.digraph_generators.py```. The function could have an optional parameter to return a dictionary instead of a digraph if relevant.

- The instruction `weight_max=ZZ(weight_max)` is before the test on weights. Is this what you expect?

That's right, you should change the test to

```
assert 0 < p and p <= 1, "The parameter p must satisfy 0 < p <= 1."
```
You don't have the change the rest of the code since the `random()` function returns a value strictly less than 1.

Concerning the documentation. For (almost?) all modules, you can find the functions in the reference manual of sage (http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/). Then, when testing a patch, we use the command

However, the sandpile model is not included in the reference manual.
I have open a new ticket to address this issue (#13342).


So, you have to:
- change the test on p

It should be something like
