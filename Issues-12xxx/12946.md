When using the optional 'outer' argument, Compositions gives a bug if 'outer' is itself a composition (as opposed to a list). Also needs to be fixed for 'inner'.

For instance:

sage: c = Compositions(3, outer = Composition([3,2]))

sage: for x in c:
....:     print x
....:

The documentation on what outer and inner do is not particularly clear to me, so so I think that it would not hurt to explain this better, but I'll leave that decision up to you. 

More importantly, the patch doesn't work when inner is a composition, so I am marking the patch as `needs work`:

```

sage: Compositions(4, inner=Composition([3,1,2])).list()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'Composition_class' object is not callable


```

Of course, the fix is trivial: as you did with outer you need to replace line 984 with:

```
inner = list(kwargs['inner'])
```

Cheers,
Andrew

Hi Mike,

To save time I just uploaded a reviewer patch which fixes the inner problem above and adds a test for it. If you are happy with this, and if the tests all pass, then I'm happy to give it a positive review.
