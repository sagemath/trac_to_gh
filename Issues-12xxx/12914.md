Add support for representation theory of finite semigroups. Quite some
stuff is available in the sage-combinat queue.

* #18230: basic hierarchy of categories for representations of monoids, lie algebras, ...
* #18001: implement categories for H, L, R, J-trivial monoids
* #16659: decomposition of finite dimensional associative algebras
* Required discussions about the current features:
  * How to specify an indexing of the J-classes
  * Should representation theory questions be asked to the semigroup or its algebra?
   * S.character_ring(QQ, ZZ) or S.algebra(QQ).character_ring(ZZ) ?
   * S.simple_modules(QQ) or S.algebra(QQ).simple_modules()?
  * Character rings (code by Nicolas in the Sage-Combinat queue)
  * Should this be called Character ring?
  * How to specify the two base rings (for the representations / for the character ring)?
  * Should left and right characters live in the same space (with realizations)?
    e.g.:
    * Should there be coercions or conversions between the basis of left-class modules and right-class modules?
    * Should the basis of simple modules on the left and on the right be identified?
  * How to handle subspaces (like for projective modules when the Cartan matrix is not invertible)
  * If we discover that a semigroup is J-trivial, how to propagate this information to its algebra, character ring, ...?
  * how to handle bimodules: do we want to see as two (facade?)
   modules, one on the left, and one on the right


* Features that remain to be implemented:
  * is_r_trivial + _test_r_trivial and friends
  * Group of a regular J-class
  * Character table for any monoid
  * Cartan matrix for any monoid
  * Group of a non regular J-class
  * Cartan matrix by J-classes
  * Radical filtration of a module
  * Recursive construction of a triangular basis of the radical

Related features:

- Toy implementation of Specht modules as quotient of the space
  spanned by tabloids by the span of XXX.

  Code by Franco available. Dependencies: 11111=None!

- LRegularBand code by Franco

- Interface to the Monoids GAP package

- Representation theory of monoids
