Hi, unfortunately, that error message doesn't say much more than that there were errors. 

* The log should contain more detailed information, can you post this?
* Also, by previous package you mean version 20111004?

Do I just use the spkg above or do I need to apply the patch as well?

I have tried with libm4rie-20111004.p2.spkg and libm4rie-20111004.p3.spkg and got the same error. The log doesn't have any details at all. The error occurs during the make  check-TESTS portion of the build. It just lists off a pile of tests and ends each section with things like  FAIL: test_trsm. The odd part is that there are no fail messages anywhere else.

The home directories are not yet present on sage.math.washinton.edu but once they are I will upload the log file.

Upstream does that: https://bitbucket.org/malb/m4ri-scripts/src/tip/release.py#cl-35 but I added a touch configure afterwards. I also touched configure in the SPKG linked above.

I didn't install the package with SAGE_CHECK=yes, but I guess I should... Anyway, the Sage test suite (make ptestlong) works.

I tried to verify your claim that it became faster for exponents between 4 and 8. I tested 6. First, in vanilla sage-5.0.rc0:

```
sage: K.<z> = GF(2^6)
sage: %time A = random_matrix(K,10000,10000)
CPU times: user 1.63 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 1.70 s
Wall time: 1.70 s
sage: %time B = random_matrix(K,10000,10000)
CPU times: user 1.53 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 1.58 s
Wall time: 1.58 s
sage: %time (A*B).rank()
CPU times: user 85.03 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 85.15 s
Wall time: 85.40 s
10000
```
With the new spkgs in sage-5.0.beta13:

```
sage: K.<z> = GF(2^6)
sage: %time A = random_matrix(K,10000,10000)
CPU times: user 1.77 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 1.84 s
Wall time: 1.85 s
sage: %time B = random_matrix(K,10000,10000)
CPU times: user 1.76 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 1.79 s
Wall time: 1.80 s
sage: %time (A*B).rank()
CPU times: user 37.38 s, sys: 0.23 s, total: 37.61 s
Wall time: 37.74 s
10000
```

Now, that *is* faster for the "real" computation, but roughly 10% slower for random matrix creation. Is that a random result within the margin of error?

Only more sophisticated linkers understand `-rpath`, its better to use `-R`. Though you shouldn't have to manually set rpaths in `libm4rie-20120613/src/bench/Makefile.am` at all, the whole autotools/libtools machinery should do that for you.

This is with only M4RI/M4RIE applied, not the LinBox update, right?

The elements in `Matrix_modn_double` should fit into a `mod_int` since they are < 2<sup>23</sup>. Hence, we simply used the same pickling format as the old `Matrix_modn_dense`.

From http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_math.html about the double bit format:

In the SPARC architecture, the higher address 32-bit word contains the least significant 32 bits of the fraction, while in the x86 architecture the lower address 32-bit word contains the least significant 32 bits of the fraction.

What lines of code are you talking about?  The problem might be alignment, i.e. doubles should be aligned on a multiple of 8 bytes.

gdb isn't installed on mark. the only debugger is mdb and I have no idea how to use it.
But the bus error is at the i=j=0 assignment (using print) in _pickle.

I thought 
mod_int = long int and celement = double (in matrix_modn_dense_double)

The cast to mod_int is working correctly, though.

FWIW: I made a similar experience on Solaris with my MeatAxe wrapper (and, if I remember correctly, the same problem has shown up a while ago when trying to use Singular options in !libSingular). Namely, MeatAxe uses a function mulmat (or matmul? Doesn't matter...), but apparently a function of the same name is defined in some other spkg as well. And apparently the Solaris linker was confusing the two mulmats, even though they belong to totally different packages! In particular, MeatAxe does not link against the other package.

The simple solution was to rename MeatAxe's mulmat into _mulmat.
So, renaming mod_int into something else would be worth a try.
