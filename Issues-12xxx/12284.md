#10333 implements an interface to Anders Buch's Littlewood-Richardson Calculator ``lrcalc`` as an optional spkg.

This ticket is about making this a standard spkg, as voted on:
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/2e7114375f6f88a5

All that needs to be done is to remove the #optional in
/sage/libs/lrcalc/lrcalc.pyx, and make the spkg posted on #10333
standard.


Depends on #10333
