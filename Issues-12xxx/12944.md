This patch breaks the doctests of the function! So we need to edit those doctests. But...

You said on #10497:
> Though if I remember correctly the french lines have been removed recently in an unrelated patch by David Coudert `:-D`


Well, this patch is at least not merged in 5.0.rc1, since the French lines in the docstring are still there - if I am to edit the doctests, I should know where that patch is, so I don't conflict with it. But because the patch is unrelated, I can't search for it - do you remember which patch it is? (Here is an example of why one should keep unrelated changes out of patches! :P)
