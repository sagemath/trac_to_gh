For Finite fields when an element also exists in a subfield it should support coercion. This is not always possible for binary ntl fields and its prime subfield GF(2).

```
sage: Fbig.<a> = GF(2^18)
one = a^(2^18-1)
GF(2)(one)
<BOOM>
TypeError: unable to coerce <type
'sage.rings.finite_rings.element_ntl_gf2e.FiniteField_ntl_gf2eElement'> to an integer
```

It seems to work for other finite field characteristics.

Your patch looks good. A few comments:

Technically, `_integer_()` is a `_conversion_` not a `_coercion_` (the same docstring is also in the corresponding method of the givaro element). I believe it is cheaper to call `is_one()` and `is_zero()` than to do a comparison with 0 and 1:

```
sage: timeit('a == 0')
625 loops, best of 3: 6.23 µs per loop
sage: timeit('a.is_zero()')
625 loops, best of 3: 437 ns per loop
sage: timeit('a == 1')
625 loops, best of 3: 6.21 µs per loop
sage: timeit('a.is_zero()')
625 loops, best of 3: 525 ns per loop
```

Also, I added double colons to get the formatting in the reference manual right.

Anyway, if you are ok with my changes. Feel free to set it to positive_review.

Btw., your patch doesn't seem to have a good commit message (12147_binary_ntl_field_coercion). So I replace it with a single patch.
