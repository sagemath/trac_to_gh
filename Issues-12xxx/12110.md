```
The singular package in 4.8.alpha doesn't compile because it lacks a simple switch in a compilation line.

The reason is that 3-1-3-3 still uses an organisation where you either have a known platform and hence get nice switches, or you're not -- and you get crap.

In fact, sage's spkg already adds forcefully a few "-fPIC" here and there that make things better.

The attached patch adds a "-shared" switch to LIBSINGULAR_FLAGS -- but it does so before that variable is overwritten by the good flags if the platform is known. That means it unbreaks my platform but doesn't break the others.

I have an upstream ticket about singular on ARM here : http://www.singular.uni-kl.de:8002/trac/ticket/299

release manager: the working spkg (just a copy of Snark's, at a more convenient place) can be found here: [spkg@boxen](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/singular-3-1-3-3.p3.spkg)

Replying to [ticket:12110 Snark]:

You have patched Singular.Makefile.in.debug.patch, but don't you also need to patch the non-debug Makefile?

Then, this needs to be rebased for 4.8, as the patch to spkg-install does not apply any more.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
I didn't need to patch the non-debug Makefile, so I don't see the point of patching it : upstream has so much better in store for the future that there's little incentive to make more than what is necessary.

I'll provide a newer patch when I'll have seen the failure in 4.8alpha5.

as I mentioned, your patch needs to be rebased, anyway, as Singular spkg has been updated in the meantime.
It might have become platform-specific, too.

Hmmmm... it tries to use omalloc_ndebug, which doesn't have the right symbols:

```
jpuydt@hecke:~/sage-4.8.alpha5/local/lib$ nm libomalloc.a |grep omSetCustomOfTrackAddr
000006f8 T omSetCustomOfTrackAddr
jpuydt@hecke:~/sage-4.8.alpha5/local/lib$ nm libomalloc_ndebug.a |grep omSetCustomOfTrackAddr

```
and:

```
jpuydt@hecke:~/sage-4.8.alpha5/local/lib$ nm libomalloc.a |grep _omDebugAlloc
00000000 t __omDebugAlloc
000003cc T _omDebugAlloc

jpuydt@hecke:~/sage-4.8.alpha5/local/lib$ 
```
Sigh. Here is how omDebug.c (where those are defined) is compiled for libomalloc.a:

```
gcc -O2 -g -fPIC -I. -I.. -I. -I/home/jpuydt/sage-4.8.alpha5/local -I.. -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -c omDebug.c

and here is how it is compiled for libomalloc_ndebug.a:

```

```
and of course, almost all of omDebug.c is in a #ifndef OM_NDEBUG. That explains the break, but doesn't explain why it would compile on other platforms and not here!

Thanks! With this patch, and the new flint spkg on #10328 provided by William, the build completes. As the system does not have readline-dev installed, the Ubuntu 11.10-specific bug does not materialize. I'm running "make ptest" now.

So the next step would be to make proper spkgs for Singular and for Flint...
