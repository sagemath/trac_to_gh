```
This works:

```
var('r,theta,z,rho,phi')
cylindrical=[r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta), z]
plot3d(3,(theta,0,pi/2),(z,0,pi/2),transformation=cylindrical)
```

but this doesn't (but should work)

```
cylindrical(r,theta,z)=[r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta), z]
plot3d(3,(theta,0,pi/2),(z,0,pi/2),transformation=cylindrical)
```

The problem is we pay too much attention to the type passed into the transformation argument.  We should also allow symbolic vectors, as well as lists and tuples.
