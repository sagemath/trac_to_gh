Implementation of a set (using the category framework) from a function that returns an iterator as in

```
sage: from sage.sets.set_from_iterator import EnumeratedSetFromIterator
sage: E = EnumeratedSetFromIterator(graphs)
{Graph on 0 vertices, Graph on 1 vertex, Graph on 2 vertices, Graph on 2 vertices, Graph on 3 vertices, Graph on 3 vertices, ...}
```
Note that in order to be able to pickle, we do not build directly a set from an iterator.

A previous implementation in sage-combinat was CombinatorialClassFromIterator (in sage.combinat.combinat) which is now deprecated.

The patch depends on #12653 which allows to initialize a graph from a dictionnary of iterables.

Hi,

I'm in trouble with two points:

1) What to do with the equality test when the set are both infinite ? (see in the patch the warning printing on stderr)

2) What is the good way to implement the decorator for a method ? The implementation for functions work quite well but in sage.misc.cachefunc the implementation for methods rather than functions seem more tricky.

Hey Vincent,

I also get the patchbot errors when running the patch in the combinat queue on 5.5.rc0. Also from a quick look-through the patch, there are a few things which I believe needs to be addressed:
- Documentation and tests for the deprecated functions in `combinat/combinat.py`
- An example in `iter_with_cache()`, I also don't quite understand the documentation.
- You'll need to add `iter_with_cache` and `set_from_iterator` to the documentation by adding/editing a `.rst` file (probably `misc.rst`).
- I prefer to see the reserved words in code blocks: <code>\`\`None\`\`</code>, <code>\`\`self\`\`</code>, <code>\`\`True\`\`</code>, and <code>\`\`False\`\`</code>
- Same for input parameters and private functions, even in private functions.
- I prefer to have as much linking as possible: ex. <code>:class:\`EnumeratedSetFromIterator\`</code>
- Instead of

  ```python
  if x is True:
  ...
  if x is False:
  ...
  ```
  it is better to do

  ```python
  if x:
  ...
  if not x:
  ...
  ```
  in case `x` is not a boolean (ex. `x = 1`).

Thanks,

Travis

Hi Travis,

These functions were *only* in the sage-combinat queues and not inside Sage. So the deprecation is just intended for people from combinat who were using it (and I think that none of them uses it).

> - An example in `iter_with_cache()`, I also don't quite understand the documentation.

I will open (few days) a new ticket for a better implementation of iter_with_cache. There is a similar construction in lazy power series and I would like to merge both. The idea is to have a Python data structure that behave like a list but with possibly infinitely many entries.

> - I prefer to see the reserved words in code blocks: <code>\`\`None\`\`</code>, <code>\`\`self\`\`</code>, <code>\`\`True\`\`</code>, and <code>\`\`False\`\`</code>

Is there a difference for documentation ? I thought that code blocks open a new paragraph.

Thanks for careful reading, I will adress all remarks in a new patch.

Best,
Vincent

Hey Vincent,

Since these functions are not in sage, its probably best to remove these functions from this patch and then put a second patch in the combinat queue deprecating these functions.

I should have called it (inline) code format, and it just changes the format in the output html.

Thanks,

Travis

Hi,

The error in patchbot comes from the lazy import of graphs (which does not support pickling). I modify a little bit the implementation to use the generic framework of lazy list (in #13778). In particular, there is no more iter_with_cache.

Best,

The following does not work

```
sage: from sage.sets.set_from_iterator import set_from_method
sage: class A:
...     a = 10
...     @set_from_method
...     def f(self):
...         return xsrange(self.a)
sage: a = A()
sage: a.f()             # works perfectly
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
sage: A.f(a)            # does not work at all
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: f() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)
```

It causes many problems with element classes which are Cython classes.

I am on this. Sorry.

Do you mean put the whole class DummyExampleForPicklingTest into the doctest ? If it is the case, I can not because pickling classes defined in an interactive console is not (easily) possible.

Ah okay, then a quick doctest for the `f()` method and something like:

```
.. WARNING::

    This class is used for pickling tests only. Do not use.
```
docstring for the class. Thanks.

Could you please explain the motivation behind the doctests

```
        TESTS::

            sage: from sage.sets.set_from_iterator import set_from_method
            sage: from sage.structure.misc import getattr_from_other_class
            sage: class A:
            ...      stop = 10000
            ...      @set_from_method
            ...      def f(self,start):
            ...          return xsrange(start,self.stop)
            sage: a = A()
            sage: getattr_from_other_class(a, A, 'f')(4)
            {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...}

            sage: class B:
            ...      stop = 10000
            ...      @set_from_method(category=FiniteEnumeratedSets())
            ...      def f(self,start):
            ...          return xsrange(start,self.stop)
            sage: b = B()
            sage: getattr_from_other_class(b, B, 'f')(2)
            {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...}
```

However, the documentation of `getattr_from_other_class` says:

```
    If self is an instance of cls, raises an ``AttributeError``, to
    avoid a double lookup. This function is intended to be called from
    __getattr__, and so should not be called if name is an attribute
    of self.
```

But this is precisely what that doctest is doing! Due to a bug in `getattr_from_other_class` (see #17801), the `AttributeError` is not always raised when it should. The obvious fix for that bug gives doctest failures in the above doctests.
