Implementation of a set (using the category framework) from a function that returns an iterator as in

```
sage: from sage.sets.set_from_iterator import EnumeratedSetFromIterator
sage: E = EnumeratedSetFromIterator(graphs)
{Graph on 0 vertices, Graph on 1 vertex, Graph on 2 vertices, Graph on 2 vertices, Graph on 3 vertices, Graph on 3 vertices, ...}
```
Note that in order to be able to pickle, we do not build directly a set from an iterator.

A previous implementation in sage-combinat was CombinatorialClassFromIterator (in sage.combinat.combinat) which is now deprecated.

The patch depends on #12653 which allows to initialize a graph from a dictionnary of iterables.

<a id='comment:1'></a>Hi,

I'm in trouble with two points:

1) What to do with the equality test when the set are both infinite ? (see in the patch the warning printing on stderr)

2) What is the good way to implement the decorator for a method ? The implementation for functions work quite well but in sage.misc.cachefunc the implementation for methods rather than functions seem more tricky.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hey Vincent,

I also get the patchbot errors when running the patch in the combinat queue on 5.5.rc0. Also from a quick look-through the patch, there are a few things which I believe needs to be addressed:
- Documentation and tests for the deprecated functions in `combinat/combinat.py`
- An example in `iter_with_cache()`, I also don't quite understand the documentation.
- You'll need to add `iter_with_cache` and `set_from_iterator` to the documentation by adding/editing a `.rst` file (probably `misc.rst`).
- I prefer to see the reserved words in code blocks: ```None```, ```self```, ```True```, and ```False```
- Same for input parameters and private functions, even in private functions.
- I prefer to have as much linking as possible: ex. `:class:`EnumeratedSetFromIterator``
- Instead of
  {{{#!python
  if x is True:
  ...
  if x is False:
  ...
  }}}
  it is better to do
  {{{#!python
  if x:
  ...
  if not x:
  ...
  }}}
  in case `x` is not a boolean (ex. `x = 1`).

Thanks,

Travis

These functions were *only* in the sage-combinat queues and not inside Sage. So the deprecation is just intended for people from combinat who were using it (and I think that none of them uses it).

I will open (few days) a new ticket for a better implementation of iter_with_cache. There is a similar construction in lazy power series and I would like to merge both. The idea is to have a Python data structure that behave like a list but with possibly infinitely many entries.

> - I prefer to see the reserved words in code blocks: ```None```, ```self```, ```True```, and ```False```


Is there a difference for documentation ? I thought that code blocks open a new paragraph.

Thanks for careful reading, I will adress all remarks in a new patch.

Best,
Vincent

Since these functions are not in sage, its probably best to remove these functions from this patch and then put a second patch in the combinat queue deprecating these functions.

I should have called it (inline) code format, and it just changes the format in the output html.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Hi,

The error in patchbot comes from the lazy import of graphs (which does not support pickling). I modify a little bit the implementation to use the generic framework of lazy list (in #13778). In particular, there is no more iter_with_cache.

Best,
Vincent

Do you mean put the whole class DummyExampleForPicklingTest into the doctest ? If it is the case, I can not because pickling classes defined in an interactive console is not (easily) possible.

        TESTS::

            sage: from sage.sets.set_from_iterator import set_from_method
            sage: from sage.structure.misc import getattr_from_other_class
            sage: class A:

```

No idea. I guess it would be safe to replace them with `sage: A.f(a,4)` and `sage: B.f(b,2)`.
