Right now, if you have a dashed arrow, the arrowhead is also drawn with a dashed linestyle, which really looks bad.  Compare before and after for `arrow((0,0), (1,1), linestyle='dashed')`.

This code works around a design issue in matplotlib. Currently, the specified linestyle is used to draw both the path and the arrowhead.  If linestyle is 'dashed', this looks really odd.  This code is from Jae-Joon Lee in response to a post to the matplotlib mailing list.

Doctest is not a problem; we just add a dashed arrow to the docs somewhere as a test.  People should be checking the visual output in the "live" notebook in any case upon big changes in graphics handling.

I don't have enough familiarity with mpl to review this quickly, I'm sorry.  I'm a little puzzled why it needs to be so big, but I guess it's hard to access just the arrowhead?

Kind of lame, but hoping to make up for it with clever points:

```
sage: dashed = arrow((0,0), (1,1), linestyle='dashed')
sage: dashed.show(filename='dashed.eps')
```

The EPS format calls `[6 6] 0 setdash` to enable the dashes, and `[] 0 setdash` to disable them. Before the patch, we enable the dashes, stroke two objects, and then disable them:

```
gantu ~ $ cat dashed.eps | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -P -q 'setdash.*stroke.*stroke.*setdash'
gantu ~ $ echo $?
0
```

After the patch, we enable the dashes, stroke one object, and then disable the dashes:

```
gantu ~ $ cat dashed-patched.eps | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -P -q 'setdash.*stroke.*stroke.*setdash'
gantu ~ $ echo $?
1
```
