We have

```
sage: u = sqrt(43203735824841025516773866131535024) #add one digit
sage: floor(u)
207855083711803944
sage: round(u) # ?? smaller than floor(u)! No warning message...
207855083711803936
sage: r = round(u)
sage: ceil(u)
207855083711803945
```
Numbers with one digit less work

```
sage: t=sqrt(4320373582484102551677386613153502)
sage: floor(t)
65729548777426599
sage: round(t) #everything as expected, floor ≤ round ≤ ceil
65729548777426600
sage: ceil(t)
65729548777426600
```
The docstring/source code of the symbolic round mentions that behavior

```
Definition:     u.round(self)
Source:
    def round(self):
        """
        Round this expression to the nearest integer.

        This method evaluates an expression in ``RR`` first and rounds
        the result. This may lead to misleading results.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: t = sqrt(Integer('1'*1000)).round(); t
            3333333333333333056287287783757109595393...

         This is off by a huge margin::

            sage: (Integer('1'*1000) - t^2).ndigits()
            984
        """
        #FIXME: can we do better?
```

It might be best to do something along the lines of:

```
def round(self):
    return floor(self+1/2)
```

but there's the possibility that that addition causes problems with inexact arithmetic.

Just before we put this to bed, I noticed a quirk involving negative numbers.  We typically truncate toward zero, like Python:

```

Python 2.7.2 (v2.7.2:8527427914a2, Jun 11 2011, 15:22:34) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from fractions import Fraction
>>> int(-1)
-1
>>> int(-0.99)
0
>>> int(Fraction(-99, 100))
0
```

But our int-ing is a little more sensitive:

```

sage: int(-1)
-1
sage: int(-0.99)
0
sage: int(SR(-99/100))
0
sage: -0.99 == -99/100
True
sage: int(-99/100) # ??
-1

```
