```
In the current Sphinx HTML doc, the extenstion function and methods have no arguments setup.

See for example the documentation of

```
reference/sage/symbolic/expression.html#sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.N
``` 
which was [ok (see there)](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/symbolic/expression.html#sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.N) in Sage 4.8. The problem was introduced in sage-5.0.beta8.

We should add a regression test on that kinds of problem.

Thanks ! I tried to figureout a way to call directly Sphinx but this is much easier. I'll try to work on this this afternoon. Do you have somewhere the various beta compiled so that I can rsync them on boxen to help bissecting ? So far the few guesses I made to find the culprit were wrong.

Hi!

The doctest introduced by this patch, at line 22 of sage/misc/sagedoc.py, is causing the sagepad.org patchbot to fail on some (trivial, unrelated) patches.  The problem seems to be that the doctest is trying to check the documentation when the documentation isn't built.  

I don't know if this is really a problem with this patch, or with the patchbot, but I thought I would try reporting it here.  If I should try elsewhere, please let me know!

You can see this failure at #12943, which is a completely trivial patch.  (It's also making the sagepad.org patchbot fail on #10527.  If you look at that ticket, though, don't look at the log for Volker's patchbot, which is having a different problem.)

cheers,

Hugh

A complete set of documentation is an integral part of a Sage build, so doctests are supposed to fail if the documentation hasn't been built. This is not because of this ticket, I don't think.

Thanks.  The issue seems to be with the particular patchbot -- I have posted to sage-devel about it.
