the following, distilled from a real example:

```

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm,sagetex}
\begin{document}
\begin{sagesilent}
d=4
\end{sagesilent}
\begin{multline}
\sage{(d)}=\\ \sage{d}
\end{multline}
\end{document}
```
produces the following sagetex.sout file:

```
% This file was *autogenerated* from s.sagetex.sage with
 % sagetex.py version 2011/05/27 v2.3.1
\newlabel{@sageinline0}{{%
4}{}{}{}{}}
\newlabel{@sageinline1}{{%
4}{}{}{}{}}
\newlabel{@sageinline0}{{%
4}{}{}{}{}}
\newlabel{@sageinline1}{{%
4}{}{}{}{}}
%34f836090e6dc538159452d641440313% md5sum of corresponding .sage file (minus "goboom" and pause/unpause lines)
```
which clearly has spurrious parts, resulting in

```
...
LaTeX Warning: Label `@sageinline0' multiply defined.
LaTeX Warning: Label `@sageinline1' multiply defined.
...
```
when running LaTeX for the 2nd, etc times.

This is fixed by the new SageTeX spkg: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/drake/code/sage/st/sagetex-2.3.3.p1.spkg.

That's just version numbers; when you clone the repo, you get all the changesets on bitbucket, which includes that one. I just haven't updated the version numbers, which I suppose I should have.

4.8.alpha6 includes that changeset, so I'll look to see if something else is going on.

I can confirm that the bitbucket clone generates (via latex sagetex.ins) the same sagetex.sty as the one in Sage 4.8.alpha4.

No, this isn't an issue of propagation. This is a new bug. And it's very interesting. Here's part of the `.sage` file that gets generated:

```
try:
 _st_.inline(0, latex((d)))
except:
 _st_.goboom(9)
try:
 _st_.inline(1, latex(d))
except:
 _st_.goboom(9)
try:
 _st_.inline(0, latex((d)))
except:
 _st_.goboom(9)
try:
 _st_.inline(1, latex(d))
except:
 _st_.goboom(9)
```

It does just `d`, and then `(d)`. Intriguing.

What I do know is the those environments in the AMS classes evaluate their arguments in very strange ways, so this may be hard to pin down without knowing that code very well (which I certainly don't).

Aha!

I can equal Rob Beezer's one-character patch. In fact, just a single bit needs to be changed: an `=` must be `<` (ASCII 0x3D to 0x3C; the least-significant bit gets flipped).

The problem is in my check to see if we've seen this label before; I didn't imagine that someone would (legitimately) use the same label twice in a single line. So `inline()` needs to check if the label it's asked to write is *less than or equal to*, instead of just equal to, the maximum label we've already written.

OK, it looks good (and works with my "real" latex file). One thing about the new package: it would be good if the date and version in .sty file reflect the reality better than presently --- as you mention yourself in a comment above.

While working on this, I uncovered a more serious bug: I was using a single variable (`max_counter_seen`) but had two different label names -- `sageinline` and `sagecmdline`. So after doing, say, 5 "inlines", `max_counter_seen` would be 5, and then if you did a sagecmdline, it would see a counter of 1 and not do anything!

So, we need to keep track of the label name as well as the maximum counter we've seen.

I also improved the version mismatch checking so that it works with arbitrarily old versions of `sagetex.sty`, so in particular people with Debian's TeXLive 2009 packages will be warned of version mismatches. This fixes #8035.

Sage itself has install_scripts().
Maybe the script you propose should be a part of it?
