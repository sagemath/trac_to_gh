If the environment variable `TERMCAP` is set and `TERM` is not set, then calling `tgetent()` from the termcap library produces a Segmentation Fault because it calls `strcmp()` with a NULL argument.  Sage hits this problem because of readline, see #11970.

To reproduce this issue: let `tgetent_test.c` be the file

```
#include <termcap.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    char* buf = malloc(100000);
    tgetent(buf, "dumb");
    printf("Successful!\n");
}
```

Now compile and link this with Sage's `libtermcap.a` (don't use `-ltermcap`, instead explicitly specify the path to the `libtermcap.a` file):

```
$ gcc tgetent_test.c local/lib/libtermcap.a -o tgetent_test
```

Run this with `TERMCAP` set but `TERM` unset:

```
$ unset TERM
$ export TERMCAP="x"
$ ./tgetent_test
Segmentation fault
```

Not reported upstream because there is no known contact person nor bug report page.

I'm not sure how you triggered this error in sage (and therefore if the actual behaviour is really relevant), but are you sure this is the right behaviour when TERM is unset? I'd probably expect an unset TERM to behave the same as an empty TERM. Your suggested change prevents the TERMCAP value from being used at all in this case, I believe.

There is more info at #11970.  It's a combination of the new readline spkg at #11970 and the patch at #12263, and it also depends on the gcc version.

> but are you sure this is the right behaviour when TERM is unset? I'd probably expect an unset TERM to behave the same as an empty TERM.

In practice, this will be the case.  The `tgetent()` code checks whether the argument `char *term` equals the environment variable "TERM".  Normally, `term` will not be the empty string.  But you are certainly right that

```
term_name = getenv("TERM");
if (!term_name)
    term_name = "";
```
would also work.

Well, William's change(s) are more or less superfluous anyway, so I'd drop them.  (I looked at the spkg a while ago, but the little changes weren't worth a ticket or new spkg.

* Instead of changing the target `all`, we should use `$MAKE libtermcap.a`, then the info files won't get built, and hence not installed (also **without** commenting out the `for` loop).

* Commenting out `oldinstalldir=...` isn't necessary, but also wrong; it should either be set to the empty string, or (if we assume nobody builds Sage as root) left as is, since the lines of the receipt that try to install into `/usr/include` are preceded by dashs anyway, i.e. `make` doesn't fail because of lacking file permissions.

In the latter case we wouldn't have to patch the Makefile at all.

(Slightly OT: Should we in general issue a warning -- or abort the build -- if someone builds Sage as root?)




Another minor thing: In `spkg-install`, `-m64` should be **ap**pended, since it should take precedence over whatever a user specified in `CFLAGS`.

Thanks, I fixed this comment.

Luckily, there is no need to review the Makefile.  This is an old patch which was directly applied to the src/ directory, instead of being applied by `spkg-install`.  I restored the upstream sources and made an explicit patch.  So the file `patches/Makefile.patch` doesn't need to be reviewed for this ticket.

Two further remarks:

* `TERMCAP` is incidentally set by `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install` (like a couple of other "abused" environment variables).

* readline isn't supposed to use *Sage's* termcap; the p4 at #11970 avoids its use under all circumstances (perhaps unless one manually adds `-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/` to `LDFLAGS` or the like).

I'd rename `Makefile.patch` to `Makefile.in.patch` to avoid confusion.

Since #11970, readline does link in Sage's termcap (at least with some compilers/linkers), so I don't think that #12098 was a mistake.

If this is true, then I would support this.  I don't know whether your assumption ("replacements on every supported system") is true though.

This might very well be true. I see this in the README of termcap:

```
However, use of termcap is discouraged.  Termcap is
being phased out in favor of the terminfo-based ncurses library, which
contains an emulation of the termcap library routines in addition to
an excellent curses implementation.  ncurses is available from the
usual GNU archive sites.

terminfo seems to be around since 1981. That's a long enough time for all systems to have caught up by now. Other websites:

Look into (e.g.) `pari-*/src/config/get_readline`.

PARI usually looks for readline, and then ncurses, then eventually gives libtermcap a try (for `tgetent()`; but apparently only in conjunction with readline).

FWIW, you can amend the latest commit in a Mercurial repository by doing the following: `hg qimport -r tip`, make some edits, `hg qrefresh -De` (to update the commit date/time and message), `hg qfinish tip`.

:-) As always, one should know what one's doing...

I was thinking of (and originally planned to write) smth like

```sh
while true; do
    hg commit -m "foo"
    hg rollback
    # edit
    # reupload spkg
done
```
