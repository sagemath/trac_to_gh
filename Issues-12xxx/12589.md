The following was posted on [the public bug reports from the notebook interface](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA) by Clemens Heuberger on 1/4/2011 and on [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/2949e7c3d0e84ef/852fabf0229526ed). In the latter other code examples were posted.

`f.series(q,2)` for the `f` defined below yields `Order(q^2)` which is incorrect, as `f.subs(q=0)` equals `1` (which is correct).

```

Mathematically you are dealing with so-called "lacunar" or "super-sparse" series. Changing  from 32bit to 64bit does not resolve it in principle if it were possible with existing Sage functionality, try this:

```
sage: R.<a>=QQ[[]]
sage: 2^33
8589934592
sage: a^8589934592-1

versus

sage: R.<x>=PolynomialRing(QQ,sparse=True)
sage: 2^65
36893488147419103232
sage: x^36893488147419103232-1
x^36893488147419103232 - 1

versus

sage: R.<x>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ,sparse=True)
sage: x^36893488147419103232-1
-1 + x^36893488147419103232
sage: x^36893488147419103232-1+O(x^5555555555555555555555)
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long

sage: R.<q>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ,sparse=True)
sage: f=(q^13362120470/((q - 1)) +1)/(q^7635497409/((q - 1)) + 1)
MemoryError
```
so apparently Sage's sparse power series ring can represent monomials with bigint degree but not a bigint series order term. Representing or computing a full series lastly can involve memory problems for whatever reason.

However, if you request `f.series(q,2)` you do not want a full series so maybe lazy series could be your solution.

Presently, we are silently getting wrong results, though. A good step forward would be if we'd get an "overflow error" rather than a series expansion that seems to have 0-terms in order 0, 1.

Actually, Pynac master now supports taking any non-symbolic real degree. I'm not sure atm how this can be used to make progress with this ticket.

However 2. can only be resolved with a dedicated sparse polynomial package. Actually if 1. #23925 is done; and 2. Pynac normalizes rational functions before developing series; then this ticket can be considered done because we will get a SIGABRT exception because of memory error from Singular+FLINT. This would avoid setting a hard limit on exponents, shifting the responsibility to the polynomial package.

<a id='comment:21'></a>There is need for a hard limit.

FLINT allows only long exponents in functions accessing their `fmpz_t` polynomials, so there is a size restriction when using FLINT, i.e. in Pynac series and polynomial manipulation via Singular (which uses FLINT as default).

**Note** that expansion of polynomials only uses Singular above a certain size, so e.g. expansion of small products with less than 400 terms overall works fine:

```
sage: ((1+x^(2^100))*(1-x^(2^100))).expand()
-x^2535301200456458802993406410752 + 1
sage: 2^101
2535301200456458802993406410752
```
