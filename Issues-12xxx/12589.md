```

Order(q^2)

sage: f=(q^1336212047/((q - 1)) +1)/(q^763549741/((q - 1)) + 1)
sage: f.series(q,2)
1 + Order(q^2)

```
EDIT: Note that log_2(7635497409) = 32.8...

Mathematically you are dealing with so-called "lacunar" or "super-sparse" series. Changing  from 32bit to 64bit does not resolve it in principle if it were possible with existing Sage functionality, try this:

```
sage: R.<a>=QQ[[]]
sage: 2^33
8589934592
sage: a^8589934592-1

versus

sage: R.<x>=PolynomialRing(QQ,sparse=True)
sage: 2^65
36893488147419103232
sage: x^36893488147419103232-1
x^36893488147419103232 - 1

versus

sage: R.<x>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ,sparse=True)
sage: x^36893488147419103232-1
-1 + x^36893488147419103232
sage: x^36893488147419103232-1+O(x^5555555555555555555555)
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long

sage: R.<q>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ,sparse=True)
sage: f=(q^13362120470/((q - 1)) +1)/(q^7635497409/((q - 1)) + 1)
MemoryError
```
so apparently Sage's sparse power series ring can represent monomials with bigint degree but not a bigint series order term. Representing or computing a full series lastly can involve memory problems for whatever reason.

However, if you request `f.series(q,2)` you do not want a full series so maybe lazy series could be your solution.

Maybe it is possible to check the expression for bigint exponents and, if so, call a special algorithm like lazy series. There are likely to be special cases of series expansion algorithms in the future, anyway, e.g. a call to fast univariate expansion via flint.

Presently, we are silently getting wrong results, though. A good step forward would be if we'd get an "overflow error" rather than a series expansion that seems to have 0-terms in order 0, 1.

Actually, Pynac master now supports taking any non-symbolic real degree. I'm not sure atm how this can be used to make progress with this ticket.

There is need for a hard limit.

FLINT allows only long exponents in functions accessing their `fmpz_t` polynomials, so there is a size restriction when using FLINT, i.e. in Pynac series and polynomial manipulation via Singular (which uses FLINT as default).

**Note** that expansion of polynomials only uses Singular above a certain size, so e.g. expansion of small products with less than 400 terms overall works fine:

```
sage: ((1+x^(2^100))*(1-x^(2^100))).expand()
-x^2535301200456458802993406410752 + 1
sage: 2^101
2535301200456458802993406410752
```

With pynac-0.7.12 we have now:

```
sage: f.series(q,2)
Exception (FLINT memory_manager). Unable to allocate memory.
...
RuntimeError: Aborted

sage: (1/(x^3689348814741910323-1)).series(x)
...
RuntimeError: exponent too big
```
Note that `f.series(q,2)` crashes inside the step where rational functions are normalized. This step is however not necessary in principle, and a smarter series functionality is needed to resolve this ticket. At least there is an error message now.
