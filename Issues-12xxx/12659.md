Hey Mike, could you explain briefly why you delete (not move) all this code?  Just curious. 

```

748	 	        pyx_inst_file = '%s/%s'%(SITE_PACKAGES, f) 
749	 	        retval = os.system('cp %s %s 2>/dev/null'%(f, pyx_inst_file)) 
750	 	        # we could do this more elegantly -- load the files, use 
751	 	        # os.path.exists to check that they exist, etc. ... but the 
752	 	        # *vast* majority of the time, the copy just works. so this is 
753	 	        # just specializing for the most common use case. 
754	 	        if retval: 
755	 	            dirname, filename = os.path.split(pyx_inst_file) 
756	 	            try:

Mike -- that makes sense.  However, why do we have this code still:

```
	422	        if not self.inplace: 
 	423	            relative_ext_dir = os.path.split(relative_ext_filename)[0] 
 	424	            prefixes = ['', self.build_lib, self.build_temp] 
 	425	            for prefix in prefixes: 
 	426	                path = os.path.join(prefix, relative_ext_dir) 
 	427	                try: 
 	428	                    os.makedirs(path) 
 	429	                except OSError, e: 
 	430	                    assert e.errno==errno.EEXIST, 'Cannot create %s.' % path 
```
Wouldn't the above only be run if we are not building in place?   It seems to me that it would be best to either keep the code discussed in the comment above, or should replace all the code above by

```
	422	        if not self.inplace: 
        423                ERROR MESSAGE
```

I'm in favor of the latter, unless I'm misunderstanding things.

Indeed, it is.  I have no explanation for the fact that only the import of this particular module fails.  It was recently added in #11754, but how should that be relevant?

I certainly don't think this is a dumb question, in fact it is a very good question.  I don't know the answer though.

I took a fresh Sage tarball, applied the patch here to the sage spkg, and then built Sage.  Then I ran `./sage --sdist ...`. I got this error:

This doesn't stop the build, but do we need to worry about it? If not, we should suppress it.

Also, as mentioned above, I took an existing Sage installation, applied the patch to devel/sage, and ran `sage --sdist ...`. I got the same error message.  Also, in the existing Sage installation, while `devel/sage/sage/version.py` was correct, `devel/sage/build/sage/version.py` was not. `local/lib/python/site-packages/sage` linked to `build/sage/`, and this is what led to the incorrect sage-banner that I mentioned earlier. Should the installation instructions include forcibly relinking `local/lib/.../sage` to the correct thing, if applying to an existing Sage installation?

I was wrong -- one doctest fails (due to a warning being shown) without the patch at #13363 added.

Just for esthetics: could you fix the spacing in [attachment:trac_12659-script.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12659/trac_12659-script.patch)?

The patches look okay to me, and it seems to work, but it would be nice if someone who knew the build process (in particular, setup.py for the Sage library) better took a look at this.

<a id='comment:41'></a>
As I mentionned on sage-devel, I recently noticed some preliminary
work in src/setup.py toward compiling the Sage library in place,
instead of putting the produced .so and copies of the .py files in
src/build.

Compiling in place means saving 15s of `sage -b` each time I just
modify Python code, and I do that all the time; so we are speaking of
dozen of minutes per day. So I have been dreaming of it for
years. Besides, it would also remove one of the regular source of
confusions for our new contributors.

So I explored this further, and with very minimal further changes ,
this apparently seems to work smoothly: I haven't yet run all tests,
but Sage starts, the documentation compiles, etc.

See branch u/nthiery/compile_library_inplace:

https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commits/u/nthiery/compile_library_inplace

I can't wait until I can use this for real Sage development. But for
this, I basically need to get this feature into Sage. It would be
adventurous to enable this feature by default for all users at this
point. On the other hand, we should allow the adventurous of us to use
this extensively to chase out the bugs.

What would be the right approach to make this feature configurable
when one compiles Sage for the first time? Using just an environment
variable set by the user is not good, since a given user might have
Sage installations configured differently. Some piece of information
must be stored somewhere at configuration time.

I am happy to use a different ticket for this if this is deemed
preferable.

Cheers,
                         Nicolas

How about making links to .py files in SAGELOCAL rather than copying them into SAGELOCAL ?

Why was copying chosen in the 1st place, I wonder...

well, what does prevent us to add an extra step of replacing copies with links?
(This might not work well on native Windows, but we don't need to support this...)

This would combine the advantage of not having multiple copies of py files lying around (and not needing to `sage -b` every time you modify a .py file in Sage library), and
retaining .pyc and .so-free source directory.

We will definitely consider this in ODK. Actually the main reason we
did not put an explicit task about this is that I was (and still am)
hoping it would be finished before that. Writing the grant distracted
me away of working on it ...
