```

```
	422	        if not self.inplace:

```

I'm in favor of the latter, unless I'm misunderstanding things.

This doesn't stop the build, but do we need to worry about it? If not, we should suppress it.

Also, as mentioned above, I took an existing Sage installation, applied the patch to devel/sage, and ran `sage --sdist ...`. I got the same error message.  Also, in the existing Sage installation, while `devel/sage/sage/version.py` was correct, `devel/sage/build/sage/version.py` was not. `local/lib/python/site-packages/sage` linked to `build/sage/`, and this is what led to the incorrect sage-banner that I mentioned earlier. Should the installation instructions include forcibly relinking `local/lib/.../sage` to the correct thing, if applying to an existing Sage installation?

<a id='comment:41'></a>As I mentionned on sage-devel, I recently noticed some preliminary
work in src/setup.py toward compiling the Sage library in place,
instead of putting the produced .so and copies of the .py files in
src/build.

Compiling in place means saving 15s of `sage -b` each time I just
modify Python code, and I do that all the time; so we are speaking of
dozen of minutes per day. So I have been dreaming of it for
years. Besides, it would also remove one of the regular source of
confusions for our new contributors.

So I explored this further, and with very minimal further changes ,
this apparently seems to work smoothly: I haven't yet run all tests,
but Sage starts, the documentation compiles, etc.

See branch u/nthiery/compile_library_inplace:

http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=u/nthiery/compile_library_inplace

I can't wait until I can use this for real Sage development. But for
this, I basically need to get this feature into Sage. It would be
adventurous to enable this feature by default for all users at this
point. On the other hand, we should allow the adventurous of us to use
this extensively to chase out the bugs.

What would be the right approach to make this feature configurable
when one compiles Sage for the first time? Using just an environment
variable set by the user is not good, since a given user might have
Sage installations configured differently. Some piece of information
must be stored somewhere at configuration time.

I am happy to use a different ticket for this if this is deemed
preferable.

Cheers,
                         Nicolas

How about making links to .py files in SAGELOCAL rather than copying them into SAGELOCAL ?

Why was copying chosen in the 1st place, I wonder...

well, what does prevent us to add an extra step of replacing copies with links?
(This might not work well on native Windows, but we don't need to support this...)

This would combine the advantage of not having multiple copies of py files lying around (and not needing to `sage -b` every time you modify a .py file in Sage library), and
retaining .pyc and .so-free source directory.

We will definitely consider this in ODK. Actually the main reason we
did not put an explicit task about this is that I was (and still am)
hoping it would be finished before that. Writing the grant distracted
me away of working on it ...
