I needed to massively optimize f.change_ring(QQ) for f in ZZ['x'] so that #11375 would not suck.

For me,

``` 
BEFORE:
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]; v = [1..10^6]; f = R(v); 
sage: time g = f.change_ring(QQ)
Time: CPU 4.39 s, Wall: 4.39 s
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]; v = [1..10^3]; f = R(v); 
sage: timeit('g = f.change_ring(QQ)')
125 loops, best of 3: 1.79 ms per loop

AFTER:
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]; v = [1..10^6]; f = R(v);
sage: time g = f.change_ring(QQ)
Time: CPU 0.05 s, Wall: 0.05 s
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]; v = [1..10^3]; f = R(v); 
sage: timeit('g = f.change_ring(QQ)')
625 loops, best of 3: 107 µs per loop
```

So we get nearly a 100-fold speedup.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

I can confirm that the patch does exactly right thing, and I have successfully run the test code in the polynomial section.

Also, I wanted to add that the function "fmpq_poly_set_fmpz_poly" is present in flint-2.3 so that this won't have to be rewritten when we finally update the version of the flint in Sage.

Best wishes

Sebastian
