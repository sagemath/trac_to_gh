Investing further,
bruhat_interval explicitly destructs the C++ list which is defined
earlier in this method and passed to Coxeter3's `interval` function.  Is
it really needed? If we comment it out, there is no more segfault.  So
the destruction must somehow corrupt Coxeter3's internal state (though
it's strange that the segfault occurs upon constructing a new group)

Some evidence why it might not be needed:

- It's a list, not a reference to a list; so c++ should destruct it at
  the end of the function, right?

- Assignment/copy operators seem to be appropriately defined in
  Coxeter3 for CoxWord element to be put in a list and be destructed
  properly.

- The pointcare_polynomial does very similar things but does not call
  this destructor at the end (so at least one of the two is wrong).

- There does not seem to be a memory leak when one comments out the
  destructor, at least not after the third call:

  ```
    sage: sage: from sage.libs.coxeter.coxeter import CoxGroup as CoxGroup
    sage: W = CoxGroup(['A',7])
    sage: w0 = WeylGroup(['A',7]).long_element().reduced_word()
    sage: sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage(t=None)
    sage: 911.23046875
    sage: len(W.bruhat_interval([], W(w0)))
    40320
    sage: sage: sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage(t=None)
    5972.0
    sage: len(W.bruhat_interval([], W(w0)))
    40320
    sage: sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage(t=None)
    5973.50390625
    sage: len(W.bruhat_interval([], W(w0)))
    40320
    sage: sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage(t=None)
    5973.50390625
    sage: len(W.bruhat_interval([], W(w0)))
    40320
    sage: sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage(t=None)
    5973.50390625
  ```

  This is confirmed by looking at the processus memory usage.

Altogether, I guess I vote for commenting out the questionable
destructor call, and consider the issue as resolved for now. We will
see later if any issue arises once we put Coxeter 3 to heavy use.

Mike, what do you think?

Cheers,
                       Nicolas

I am working on it right now, and doing a couple other cleanup's (like working around Coxeter 3 segfaulting for the trivial Coxeter group :-)).

On Mac OS Lion (10.7.5) the Coxeter3 spkg fails with the following. It works on Anne's 10.6.8 Mac.

Note that g++ can't make sense of the -soname option. The question
is why and is this needed.

If we remove the -soname option then it is broke on Anne's machine.

The updated patch fixes the WeylGroup versus CoxeterGroup issue that Nicolas mentioned. It also fixed a segfault caused by computing KL polynomial for elements that are not comparable in Bruhat order

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A', 3], implementation='coxeter3')
sage: W.kazhdan_lusztig_polynomial([1],[3,2])
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.
```

The implementation of the parabolic KL polynomials is changed so that it works with infinite Coxeter groups.

* check youre actually in a Sage environment at the beginning of spkg-install
* the way you patch is really strange, isn't it possible to use proper patches?
* use $MAKE in spkg-install
* check for errors in spkg-install

There are .o objects in the src dir, I guess that's why it fails on Cygwin and OS X, these are object files for Linux.

Last remarks for the moment:
* could you redirect error message to stderr  (>&2)
* could you add a similar treatment for Cygwin ("$UNAME" = "CYGWIN") as for Darwin?
  You could then name the library cyg${module}.dll, put it in */bin (and potentially ask gcc to create an additional import library lib${module}.dll.a put in */lib, you can trigger its generation with -Wl,--out-implib=lib${module}.dll.a -Wl,--export-all-symbols, not sure the export all symbol thing is really necessary, i.e. if its default or not)
* an exe extension for the executable would be nice as well on Cygwin!
