The attached sage script (`inhomogeneous_bug_test.py`) creates a linear system that

* crashes Sage if the variables are continuous, and
* hangs Sage if the variables are integer.

Nathann determined that this was a bug with GLPK, the underlying solver. I have attached a C++ program (`glpk_bug.cpp`) that reproduces the bug directly via the GLPK library, and passed it on to the developers.

I can't resist the temptation to say that the developers don't consider this a bug, but a feature; see

  [This thread on the bug-glpk mailing list archive](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-glpk/2012-01/threads.html)

and

  [GLPK/Known Issues](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLPK/Known_issues#Unbounded_integer_variables)

where they call this behavior *essentially innate.* The workaround is to set upper bounds.

Sage's documentation should provide this information to the user, and suggest the workaround. We should also try trapping the exception, and notifying the user.

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment%3A5):

> It seems weird that the loglevel has to be stored in *BOTH* iocp and smcp `O_o` Isn't just one of them necessary ?

`glp_simplex` doesn't take `iocp` parameters.

> Isn't there a "GLPK way" to copy the content of a scmp object ? It would be nice to let GLPK do the job, or we would have to create a new variable each time we expose a new parameter

Even if true, and it probably is, that would still be overkill, given our current setup. The `smcp` and `iocp` structures are created in `__cinit__` regardless of whether we're copying or creating. If the `copy` function were then to invoke GLPK's copy constructor (or whatever) then we would be creating the same thing twice, merely to avoid setting two parameters directly?

Right right, so you need to update its log level too ! Sorry about that.

> Even if true, and it probably is, that would still be overkill

Granted, granted. So I only have two remarks on your patch :
* First, I guess that ``self.scmp`` behaves like ``self.iocp`` and should also be deallocated in ``__dealloc__``
* Could you add a doctest that shows the signal returned by your code when a bad lp is solved without the preprocessing flag, and how it is solved afterwards ? The shortest bad example I was able to produce from you .py file is this one :

```
lp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="GLPK")
lp.add_constraint( lp[1] +lp[2] -2.0 *lp[3] , max =-1.0)
lp.add_constraint( lp[0] -4.0/3 *lp[1] +1.0/3 *lp[2] , max =-1.0/3) # <-- succeeds up to here w/last line                                                                                                                                                                        
lp.add_constraint( lp[0] +0.5 *lp[1] -0.5 *lp[2] +0.25 *lp[3] , max =-0.25) # <--- fails here w/last line

I also believe the documentation you added about the ``preprocessing`` flag is worth being in a .. WARNING:: environment. This way it'll appear in red in the HTML documentation, and should attract the attention of somebody having some troubles with GLPK. That's up to you `:-)`

Sorry if I am being a little slow, there are several nasty patches needing attention at the same time (not to mention the awful CBC one) and "free time" is a long-forgotten dream these days `O_o`

I'm looking at the manual to see if I can find a way around this.

The first run may (it depends on the releases) take some times, but you can rebuild it in a few seconds afterwards when you update the files.

It will tell you where the html files are located on your computer. And I guess it will also update the one used by the notebook though I really never use it `^^;`
