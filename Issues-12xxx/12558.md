I found some more numerical noise in this doctest in the hidden markov model stuff:

would be über-cool though...

Cicero is running Fedora 16, for the record.

The i7 has more SSE ops, if the compiler used those instead of FPU then that would easily explain the slightly different precision. GCC on tesla is 4.6.1.
