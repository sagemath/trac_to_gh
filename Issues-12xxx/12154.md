A later patch at #12006 does everything this patch does, and more. Now that ticket is closed, so **this one can be closed** too.

In 4.7.2, I get

```
        sage -t -only-optional=magma devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_generic.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t -only-optional=magma devel/sage/sage/schemes/plane_conics/con_field.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t -only-optional=magma devel/sage/sage/interfaces/magma.py # 11 doctests failed
        sage -t -only-optional=magma devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx # 1 doctests failed
```

Most of these are because 1 in QQ is now converted to Magma as "1/1" instead of "1". The other one is a simple Sage error introduced in #11580 (x is redefined as a variable in a multivariate polynomial ring and then used again as if this never happened).

I'm writing a patch.

Apparently some breaking of magma doctests went unnoticed in both #6329 and #11580.
