```
sage: w = Word(iter("a"))
sage: w.find("a")
... hanging ...
```

Original report (the bug appears in the last two lines):

```
Salut,

Un participant à un TP sage (à l'EJCIM 2012) a décelé un bug :

sage: s = WordMorphism("a->a")
sage: w = Word("a")
sage: w2 = s(w)
sage: w.find("a")
0
sage: w2.find(Word("a"))
0

Pour l'instant tout va bien. Les deux problèmes sont :

sage: w2.find("a",end=1)
-1
sage: w2.find("a")
--> ça boucle

À la prochaine,
Timo

```

Hi,

I also thought about using the python string methods to fix this, but the  `Word` class allows arbitrary alphabets so we cannot use the string method directly.

The problem arises for example with `u = Word([-1,-2,-3])`, where `str(u)` returns the string `'-1,-2,-3'`:

```
sage: u = Word([-1,-2,-3])
sage: v = Word([-2])
sage: u.find(v)
1
sage: str(u).find(str(v))
3
```

```
sage: u = Word([-1,-2,-3])
sage: v = Word([-2]) 
sage: vv = Word("-2")
sage: v
word: -2
sage: vv
word: -2
sage: u.find(v)

sage: u.find(vv)

```

Is this the behaviour we expect or should `u.find(vv)` return 1, too?

Notice

```
sage: v == vv
False
sage: type(v)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
sage: type(vv)

I like the way the fix is done. But by coercing the sub into the parent, we may obtain a Value Error. Should we catch the Value Error and return -1 in this case?

```
sage: w = Words('ab')('babaabaaab')
sage: w.find('abc')      # find is overwritten in WordDatatype_str
-1
sage: 
sage: w = Words('ab')(tuple('babaabaaab'))
sage: w.find('abc')
Traceback (most recent call last):

ValueError: c not in alphabet!
