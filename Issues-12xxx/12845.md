We currently have,

```
sage: a, b, c = var("a, b, c")
sage: v = vector([a, b, c])
sage: bool(norm(v).simplify_full() == sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2))
True
```

which is true enough if a,b,c are real. The current doctest "works" because somewhere along the line, `simplify_full()` assumes that they're real. So in effect, this doctest is confirming incorrect behavior.

The proper fix is to explicitly assume that a,b,c are real.

Yes, there are at least two, #12737 and #12780. I separated this patch out because I wound up fixing the same doctest twice.

The first bug, "fixed" by #12737 is that `simplify_radical()` ignores the domain anyway and goes nuts. "Simplify" there is really a misnomer, so the fix that I settled on was to remove it from `simplify_full()`:

```
sage: bool(norm(v).simplify_radical() == sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2))
True
```

The second more sneaky bug, #12780, is that `simplify_log()` sets the Maxima domain to `real` before it performs its simplifications. Thus,

```
sage: bool(norm(v).simplify_log() == sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2))    
True
```

I think the fix there is straightforward: don't do that. This was the only doctest affected by not setting the domain to `real` during `simplify_log()`.

Do you have to `forget()` anything for doctests to work properly?  I think it's good form to do so at the end of any assumptions tests...
