Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
NotImplementedError: _triangulate() only accepts graphs with more than 2
vertices as input.
```

It is interesting that _triangulate raises NotImplementedError. The usual definition of a triangulation says something like "maximal planar graph", so it seems like PathGraph(2) is already triangulated, but if you ask [Mathematica](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangulatedGraph.html) or [OEIS](http://oeis.org/A000109), they don't accept this: according to this source there aren't any triangulated graphs on two vertices, so _triangulate should scream "This can't be done" and is_planar should avoid use _triangulate in this scenario, because there is no doubt that PathGraph(2) is planar.

The error is only present when set_pos=True. Also, notice that

```
sage: graphs.PathGraph(1).is_planar(set_pos=True)
True
```

Helloooooooo !!

A good patch, with a several things to fix: 

* There must always be a double semicolumn "::" before any Sage code in the doctests, so that it appears as code in the documentation.
* The first doctest you add in planarity.pyx is written on one *very long* linem and is not that easy to read `^^;`. We have ways to write doctests on several lines when we need it, though ! You have many such examples in files like graph.py (hint: look for the string "sage: for" to see how it is done !). Sadly, this also means that the "long" flags have to be copied on each line.
* There is no need to test connectedness at this moment :

      ```
      if len(g) == 2 and g.is_connected():
  ```
  There are two graphs on 2 vertices, and if the graph is not connected it has been detected just previously by g.size() == 0.
* The .vertices() method does a lot of unnecessary stuff (for instance is *sorts* the vertices before returning them), so it hurts a bit when I see 

      ```
      { g.vertices()[0]: [g.vertices()[1]], g.vertices()[1]: [g.vertices()[0]] }
  ```

I added a reviewer's patch to this ticket that does precisely that, so if you can agree with its changes you can set this ticket to positively reviewed ! `:-)`

Thank you for your patch !

Thanks for these remarks. I'll look into the other patches I sent and correct similar errors. :-)

If we suppose that the function planarity.is_planar is only accessed by generic_graph.is_planar, then there shouldn't be any loops at this moment, because the generic_graph function makes a graph simple first.

+1 for the idea, and +1 for your relationship with Sage's source code. The lad knows a lot of stuff I do not know myself, but its education is still lacking on many points.

Arggggggg.... Patch updated `:-/`

The missing variable was declared with a "# long time" flag, so the doctest was running with the -long flag and we missed it `O_o`

I set the whole thing to "long" in the end.

Lukasz can you give it another look ?
