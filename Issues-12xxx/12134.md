sage: graphs.PathGraph(2).is_planar(set_pos=True)
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
NotImplementedError: _triangulate() only accepts graphs with more than 2
vertices as input.
```

It is interesting that _triangulate raises NotImplementedError. The usual definition of a triangulation says something like "maximal planar graph", so it seems like PathGraph(2) is already triangulated, but if you ask [Mathematica](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangulatedGraph.html) or [OEIS](http://oeis.org/A000109), they don't accept this: according to this source there aren't any triangulated graphs on two vertices, so _triangulate should scream "This can't be done" and is_planar should avoid use _triangulate in this scenario, because there is no doubt that PathGraph(2) is planar.

The error is only present when set_pos=True. Also, notice that

```
sage: graphs.PathGraph(1).is_planar(set_pos=True)
True
```

Helloooooooo !!

A good patch, with a several things to fix: 

* There must always be a double semicolumn "::" before any Sage code in the doctests, so that it appears as code in the documentation.
* The first doctest you add in planarity.pyx is written on one *very long* linem and is not that easy to read `^^;`. We have ways to write doctests on several lines when we need it, though ! You have many such examples in files like graph.py (hint: look for the string "sage: for" to see how it is done !). Sadly, this also means that the "long" flags have to be copied on each line.
* There is no need to test connectedness at this moment :

      ```
      if len(g) == 2 and g.is_connected():
  ```
  There are two graphs on 2 vertices, and if the graph is not connected it has been detected just previously by g.size() == 0.
* The .vertices() method does a lot of unnecessary stuff (for instance is *sorts* the vertices before returning them), so it hurts a bit when I see 

      ```
      { g.vertices()[0]: [g.vertices()[1]], g.vertices()[1]: [g.vertices()[0]] }
  ```

I added a reviewer's patch to this ticket that does precisely that, so if you can agree with its changes you can set this ticket to positively reviewed ! `:-)`

Thank you for your patch !

Nathann

Thanks for these remarks. I'll look into the other patches I sent and correct similar errors. :-)

If we suppose that the function planarity.is_planar is only accessed by generic_graph.is_planar, then there shouldn't be any loops at this moment, because the generic_graph function makes a graph simple first. I'm not sure if that's true, but I must admit I didn't wrote the code with this in mind -- I just didn't notice that disconected case was handled by previous change. :-)

I plan to work with this more. For example, it seems to me that teaching _triangulate how to handle disconnected cases shouldn't be very hard, as allowing embedding of multigraphs. I guess this can be usefull for #6236.

> I plan to work with this more. For example, it seems to me that teaching _triangulate how to handle disconnected cases shouldn't be very hard, as allowing embedding of multigraphs. I guess this can be usefull for #6236.


+1 for the idea, and +1 for your relationship with Sage's source code. The lad knows a lot of stuff I do not know myself, but its education is still lacking on many points.

By the way, you should add your name to the "Authors" field of the ticket, lest the guy above (the release manager) .set the ticket back to "needs_work"

Arggggggg.... Patch updated `:-/`

The missing variable was declared with a "# long time" flag, so the doctest was running with the -long flag and we missed it `O_o`

I set the whole thing to "long" in the end.

Lukasz can you give it another look ?
