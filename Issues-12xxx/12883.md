What's the title supposed to tell us (if you get build errors with that version)?

For GCC 4.7.x / C++11 issues see #12762; for (problems with) updating LinBox see #11718.  (I think I've read about complications when trying to upgrade to 1.2.2 elsewhere as well.)  See #12865 for yet another issue, which is still present in 1.2.2.

Sorry for lack of a better description. I am trying to address and submit reports to involved upstream parties about some patches and version issues of some components, while checking how far I can go building sagemath in Fedora, and using Fedora packages.

For example, the first error:

```
error: 'linbox_modn_dense_echelonize' was not declared in this scope
```
in `/usr/include/linbox/linbox-sage.h` I see only

```
EXTERN unsigned long int linbox_modn_dense_echelonize_double (double modulus, double*matrix, size_t nrows, size_t ncols);

EXTERN unsigned long int linbox_modn_dense_echelonize_float (float modulus, float * matrix,size_t nrows, size_t ncols);
```

Same happens for `linbox_modn_dense_delete_array` that now have prototypes for `linbox_modn_dense_delete_array_double` and `linbox_modn_dense_delete_array_float`.

Also `linbox_integer_dense_matrix_matrix_multiply` changed prototype from

```
/* ans must be a pre-allocated and pre-initialized array of GMP ints. */
EXTERN int linbox_integer_dense_matrix_matrix_multiply(mpz_t** ans, mpz_t **A, mpz_t **B,
			      size_t A_nr, size_t A_nc, size_t B_nr, size_t B_nc);
```

in the sagemath linbox-1.1.6 spkg, to

```
/* ans must be a pre-allocated and pre-initialized array of GMP ints. */
int linbox_integer_dense_matrix_matrix_multiply (mpz_t** ans, mpz_t **A, mpz_t **B, size_t m, size_t n, size_t k);
```

in linbox-1.2.2.

I am trying to have upstream aware of these issues, and if not possible to get components working, I can try to get an extra linbox 1.1.6 package in Fedora.

But it is not yet enough because the sage matrix interface was changed from "jagged pointers" to a single sequential vector.

I believe I could make a patch for `sage/libs/linbox/linbox.{pxd,pyx}` but I do not feel confident about other places where sage interfaces to linbox matrices.

The attached patches allow continuing experimenting with a new sagemath rpm.
The patches are only tested to know they make sagemath and linbox agree on api/abi, but no testing done.
There were missing prototypes/templates in linbox-sage.h as well as wrong ones.
I am not fully confident that some place may do wrong dereferencing of matrix fields due to upstream change from a vector of rows where every row is an allocated pointer to a single memory chunk.
Another part I am not confident is that I did the correct logic in the change from
A_nr, A_nc, B_nr, B_nc to test in sage code `if A_nr != B_nc: ...`, and convert the values of `m, n, k` as
`A_nr, A_nc, B_nr`.

This is not a proposal of a final patch, but a extra call for more feedback. As this was also the first time I actually did look at linbox code, so, just patched the interfaces to make both sides agree.

Is it reasonably to define mod_int to C long?

If not, safest approach should be to use uint32_t I believe, otherwise, should require coding 64 bit templates in linbox 1.2.2.

The new attached fflas-ffpack-64bit.patch is required to generate proper 64 bit code, and the updated linbox-sagemath.patch should be very close to the final format, but note that in 64 bit arch, linbox 1.2.2 with the attached patches needs also to have -D!__LINBOX_HAVE_INT64=1 in CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

I should update the sage-4.8-linbox.patch at some point, as the initial patch I attached was only enough to get to another build failure in Fedora. But the next update should be for sage-5.0.

-  Reported build problems with linbox 1.2.2 to upstream a few minutes ago.
+The version of LinBox used in Sage is **4 years** old, we should update.
 
-  Reason is that I am experimenting with packaging sagemath in Fedora. As you should know, I have it packaged since late sagemath 3.x up to 4.8 in Mandriva, so I am attempting to repeat it in Fedora.
-
-  Fedora has linaro 1.2.2 (built with --enable-sage) packaged, and givaro-3.5.0 btw :-)
-
-  I reported the same build log at[http://groups.google.com/group/linbox-use/browse_thread/thread/713663b790d0dfe9](http://groups.google.com/group/linbox-use/browse_thread/thread/713663b790d0dfe9) but pasting it here also to hopefully give an idea of the build failure.

I've reuploaded the package without that mysterious file (which is not in spkg repo as I've checked) at
http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/sage/linbox-1.3.2.spkg

No other changes to the spkg.
So someone should put this back to positive review (after checking I did not break everything).

I've wasted my coffee break in preserving the mercurial history of the bikeshedding that went into linbox-1.1.6p(N+1) despite the fact that it is all being ripped out. Hopefully future generations of archaeologists will appreciate the effort.

I've also mentioned in the SPKG.txt that spgk-check is disabled in case anybody can't figure it out from the filename.

Now that spkg-install sets `--with-default` we don't need `--with-foo` for every foo.

Now errors go to stderr again.
