The attached script does some statistical analysis and plotting for a series of timings done with `timeit`. It should help to understand how the performance of an algorithm does work out and also how the underlying framework and hardware behaves under load. It shows a time-series, a histogram and CDF plot. It does reject outlyers based on quantile-margins and starts with a dedicated warmup phase. Additional features are possible. Plotting is done via matplotlib, this should be changed to Sage-specific routines.
