This ticket is about updating the developer guide for #10492.

The developer guide suggests (http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html#the-file-spkg-txt)

```
      If your package depends on another package, say boehmgc, then you should check that this other package has been installed. Your spkg-install script should check that it exists, with code like the following:

      BOEHM_GC=`cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/; ./newest_version boehm_gc`
      if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Failed to find boehm_gc.  Please install the boehm_gc spkg"
          exit 1
      fi
```
This is totally wrong.  It only checks that a spkg *exists*, not that it has been installed.  See #12608 for removing this wrong checking from PPL.

The patches below also include various fixes to "Producing New Sage Packages".

Apply [and [attachment:12609_review.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12609/9a93b1c620eda97975492113871bab46.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12609/d1956f32c3d76304ea884d27e5d9bb8a.patch)) to the main Sage library.

Depends on #10492

I guess you're missing a negation there (you're failing if the package is found).

Don't use `grep -q`, it's not portable.  Instead use `grep >/dev/null`.  Finally, your regular expression is probably too complicated, I think

```
grep '^fricas-.*' >/dev/null
```
should suffice.  Your counterexample `fricasaldor-1.0.9` doesn't match it!

To be very safe, use `ls -1` instead of a plain `ls`.
