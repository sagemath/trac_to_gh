This ticket is about updating the developer guide for #10492.

The developer guide suggests (http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html#the-file-spkg-txt)

```
      If your package depends on another package, say boehmgc, then you should check that this other package has been installed. Your spkg-install script should check that it exists, with code like the following:

      BOEHM_GC=`cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/; ./newest_version boehm_gc`
      if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Failed to find boehm_gc.  Please install the boehm_gc spkg"
          exit 1
      fi
```
This is totally wrong.  It only checks that a spkg *exists*, not that it has been installed.  See #12608 for removing this wrong checking from PPL.

The patches below also include various fixes to "Producing New Sage Packages".

Apply [attachment:trac_12609-doc-developer.patch] and [attachment:12609_review.patch] to the main Sage library.
