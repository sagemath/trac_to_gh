The plot for `EllipticCurve('448c6')` looks like a vertical line.  The reason is that `plot` contains

```
    d = 4*x**3 + (a1**2 + 4*a2)*x**2 + (2*a3*a1 + 4*a4)*x + (a3**2 + 4*a6)
    r = d.roots(multiplicities=False)
    r.sort()
    if xmax is None:
        xmax = r[-1] + 2
    xmax = max(xmax, r[-1]+2)
    if xmin is None:
        xmin = r[0]  - 2
    xmin = min(xmin, r[0]-2)
```

When `d` has only one real root, this approach doesn't work that well.  One suggestion would be to also require that the plot contains the flex points, which can be found from the 3-division polynomial.
