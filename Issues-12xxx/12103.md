Sage has (or will soon have) fairly good implementations of dense matrices over `GF(2)`, over `GF(2^e)` (#9562) and over `GF(p)` (p prime, #4260). However, it uses generic code for dense matrices over `GF(p^n)`, p odd, n>1, `p^n<255`. 

The original suggestion was to use a major modification of `MeatAxe Release 2.2.4` instead of the basic implementation. The timings below are with that old version (it is identical with 2.2.3 except for the GPL licence, and 2.2.3 was before 1998).

I now suggest to try and do the same with the latest MeatAxe release 2.4.24, which is from 2011. There also is an experimental 2.5.0 from 2003, but I think we shouldn't rely on that.

**__Sources__**

The upstream sources http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~MTX/meataxe-2.4.24.tar.gz needed to be repackaged, in order to unpack into a single folder. Use [attachment: meataxe-2.4.24.tar.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12103/meataxe-2.4.24.tar.gz.gz)

**__What is done__**

There is no spkg-check. However, if SAGE_CHECK=yes or of one does `sage -i -c meataxe`, then a test suite is executed as part of building the package.

It is my experience that the tests pass most of the time. I can not explain why sometimes they don't.

**__What is missing__**

Currently, the spkg installs libmtx.a and installs some binaries. However, I also intend to add a Cython wrapper so that one can use MeatAxe matrices in Sage.


Here is the original ticket description:

This is awfully slow:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5^3,'y'),2000)
sage: %time A = MS.random_element()
CPU times: user 6.36 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 6.39 s
Wall time: 6.41 s
sage: type(A)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>
sage: B = MS.random_element()
sage: %time A*B    # using 6.3% of my computer's memory
CPU times: user 744.20 s, sys: 1.18 s, total: 745.38 s
Wall time: 747.69 s
2000 x 2000 dense matrix over Finite Field in y of size 5^3
sage: %time ~A     # using 10.4% of my computer's memory
CPU times: user 1096.74 s, sys: 1.30 s, total: 1098.05 s
Wall time: 1101.24 s
2000 x 2000 dense matrix over Finite Field in y of size 5^3
sage: %time A.echelon_form() # using 10.4% of my computer's memory
CPU times: user 378.62 s, sys: 0.33 s, total: 378.95 s
Wall time: 380.06 s
2000 x 2000 dense matrix over Finite Field in y of size 5^3
```

With the optional spkg and the patch, one gets a clear improvement.

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5^3,'y'),2000)
sage: %time A = MS.random_element()
CPU times: user 0.32 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.32 s

sage: type(A)

sage: B = MS.random_element()
# The following uses Strassen-Winograd multiplication
sage: %time A*B      # using 3.5% of my computer's memory
CPU times: user 7.68 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 7.69 s
Wall time: 7.72 s
2000 x 2000 dense matrix over Finite Field in y of size 5^3
# The following is school book multiplication;

# Strassen is not implemented for inversion and echelon form.
sage: %time ~A    # using 3.8% of my computer's memory
CPU times: user 23.55 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 23.55 s
Wall time: 23.62 s
2000 x 2000 dense matrix over Finite Field in y of size 5^3
sage: %time A.echelon_form() #using 3.9% of my computer's memory
CPU times: user 11.73 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 11.74 s
Wall time: 11.78 s

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Here is more on `libmeataxe-1.0.spkg`.

I started with Release 2.2.4 of the Aachen `C MeatAxe`. This is partially because I first came in touch with `MeatAxe` by old code of David Green, who was using the 2.2.3 release. `MeatAxe 2.2.4` was released under GPL2+, which should be fine. There are more recent releases. However, according to Michael Ringe, while the interface changed substantially, the linear algebra is more or less the same.

The spkg contains the unmodified sources in the folder `src/`, which is not under version control. The file `patches/libmeataxe.patch` provides my modification. Of course, if one installs the package, the patch will automatically be applied.
 
Here is a summary of my changes:

* Normally, `MeatAxe` provides some executables that operate on matrices stored in files. I strip it down, such that the executables are not built and only a C library remains (this is [libmeataxe-1.0.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/SimonKing/LibMeatAxe/libmeataxe-1.0.spkg)). I wrap the C library using Cython (this is [attachment: trac12103_meataxe.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12103/trac12103_meataxe.patch.gz))
* `MeatAxe` uses school book multiplication. I added Strassen-Winograd multiplication, using a schedule that minimizes memory consumption. See `src/src/window.c`.
* The environment variable `MTXLIB` was supposed to tell `MeatAxe` where to find multiplication tables. However, this never worked for me. I fix it, so that now multiplication tables in `$SAGE_ROOT/local` are used, that are created when the package is installed.
* A simpler version of the package has been part of our group cohomology spkg. Bad experiences on Solaris made me change three names: I changed
   * `T_STRING` into `T_STRINGS`,
   * matextract into _matextract,
   * matid into `MTXmatid`.
 Please don't ask me why the Solaris linker was mistaking these symbols with symbols in completely different Sage packages, but as a matter of fact it did.

The aim of this ticket is to make the modified `MeatAxe` an optional back end for dense matrices over `GF(p^n)`, p>2 prime, n>1, `p^n<255`. Currently, one needs to install an spkg *and* a patch to the Sage library.

I would prefer to have it all in one, such that `sage -i libmeataxe-1.0.spkg` would automatically patch the Sage library. Question to Sage experts: Is that possible?

Anyway, I think it can be reviewed...

I have updated both patches, because I wanted to add one method: `matrix_from_rows`. One could rely on the generic implementation, but in some application I need this to be fast:

```
            sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5^3,'y'),3,2)
            sage: A = MS(range(6))
            sage: A

            [2 3]
            [4 0]
            sage: A.matrix_from_rows([2,1])
            [4 0]
            [2 3]
            sage: A.matrix_from_rows([1,1])

I get

```

patching file sage/modules/quotient_module.py
Hunk #12 succeeded at 297 with fuzz 1 (offset 10 lines).

now at: trac12103_meataxe_rel11900.patch

```
So, I can not confirm that the first to-be-applied patch is really problematic (ok, fuzz 1 might be fixed at some point, but I don't get actual errors).

How can I test in module_list.py whether or not `MeatAxe` is installed? I suppose the patch to the sage library should not be applied by the installation script of the spkg.

<div id="comment:17" align="right">comment:17</div>

The first step will probably be the creation of a new-style package for MeatAxe 2.4.24 (which I take as an exercise for learning new-style packaging).

The README file says:

```
================================================================================
INSTALLATION (for Unix systems)
================================================================================

1) Copy Makefile.conf.dist to Makefile.conf. Edit Makefile.conf
   and fill in the necessary parameters.

2) To compile all programs an run the test suite, enter

        make check

   You will probably need gmake (GNU make) to build the MeatAxe.

3) If there were no errors, run

        make install

   to install the executables in their final location (as selected
   in the makefile).
```

I wonder if we should follow that procedure. After all, `Makefile.conf.dist` just defines a couple of variables that determine the compiler, the flags, the location of the binaries, the location of the library and the implementation (for fields of order up to 255 or for larger fields).

What do people think?
1. a) Should we patch Makefile, by removing the line `include Makefile.conf`, and define all the variables MTXLIB, MTXBIN etc. from Makefile.conf as environment variables?
or
1. b) Should we keep Makefile, create an empty Makefile.conf, and do the rest with environment variables?
or
2. Should spkg-install first create a fully grown Makefile.conf?

I am slightly puzzled.

There is a variable ZZZ used in Makefile. But when I do

```
ZZZ=0
$MAKE
```
then apparently Makefile doesn't know about ZZZ. What do I need to do to define ZZZ so that Makefile knows about it?

Thanks, "export" did the trick.

However, I am afraid that some of the reasons for massively patching MeatAxe 2.2.4 are still present in version 2.4.24:
- The environment variables MTXLIB and MTXBIN are ignored during build. I.e., the library is put into ./tmp/, the binaries are put into ./bin/

  Suggested solution: Let spkg-install move the created binaries and libmtx.a to the desired location

- `make clean` doesn't work, as it also goes into the directory test/ and calls `make clean` there---but there is no test/Makefile.

   Not relevant here, as the build directory is deleted anyway.

- `make check` rebuilds everything in ./tmp/ and ./bin/ before testing. Hence, the test suite actually does NOT test what is in $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib and $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin.

Question on `make check`: Would it be OK to let spkg-install ALWAYS do `make check`? Or should that be solely the job of spkg-check (with the drawback that then spkg-check would rebuild meataxe)?

+**__What is done__**
+
+There is no spkg-check. However, if SAGE_CHECK=yes or of one does `sage -i -c meataxe`, then a test suite is executed as part of building the package.
+
+It is my experience that the tests pass most of the time. I can not explain why sometimes they don't.
+
+**__What is missing__**
+
+Currently, the spkg installs libmtx.a and installs some binaries. However, I also intend to add a Cython wrapper so that one can use MeatAxe matrices in Sage.

Question on how to continue:

My aim is to provide a Cython wrapper, so, I need to copy meataxe.h to some include location.

But how to deal with the Cython wrapper? Apparently it would be in the Sage library, but apparently it will not compile if meataxe is not installed.

So, should the package install the cython code into the Sage library? Or is it possible to have code permanently in the Sage library that is only compiled if a certain package is installed, and otherwise is left untouched?

I am afraid I stand corrected. Meanwhile I have a Cython wrapper on my laptop, and when I create a matrix over GF(2), then a file p002.zzz (defining multiplication table) is created in the current directory.

That's a very nasty property of MeatAxe. What shall we do about it? 

Shall we leave it like that?

Shall I try to port my patch from 2.2.4 to 2.4.24 and ensure that all multiplication tables should be created in SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/meataxe/?

From the MeatAxe sources:

```
/**
 ** MeatAxe Library Directory.
 ** This variable contains the name of the MeatAxe library directory.
 ** Arithmetic table files are searched in this directory. The value of 
 ** MtxLibDir can be set on the command line with the "-L" option. Otherwise, 
 ** the value of the environment variable MTXLIB is used. If neither "-L" nor 
 ** MTXLIB are defined, the default directory, which was selected when

 **/
```
So, apparently the multiplication tables are supposed to be in MTXLIB. But that has NEVER worked for me.

Or rather, it could be that MTXLIB has to be an environment variable at running time. Would it be acceptable that a module `sage.matrix.meataxe` sets an environment variable for MeatAxe? I'll test if that works.

Recent changes:

- Since we want to wrap the code, it is needed to make the meataxe header available.
- I found that packages are supposed to give a file called "type". I declare there that the package is supposed to be optional.
- Since we move libmtx.a from a temporary location to somewhere in SAGE_LOCAL, it is needed to use "-fPIC".
- The multiplication tables shouldn't pollute the user's current directory. I propose to store them in SAGE_SHARE/meataxe/.
- MeatAxe has IO-functions that accept an argument saying that the file is a library file---but in the IO-functions, it is always first looked into the current directory, and the library location is only considered if the current directory didn't work.
- In at least one function, the IO-argument for "library files" is used wrongly. So, after fixing the IO-function, the wrong argument needed to be fixed, too.

In meataxe/patches is a patch that fixes these two upstream bugs.

Current status:

- The package builds fine.
- When running the testsuite, I sometimes see a wrong checksum, but when I repeat the testsuite, everything is fine. I guess upstream's checksum function is fragile. Not sure if I'm going to fix that.
- With the Cython wrapper on my laptop, I can create MeatAxe matrices in a Sage session, and the current directory is not polluted by multiplication tables.

TODO:

- Finish the Cython wrapper.

The format hasn't changed since version 2.2.3, and the current version already is 4 years old. So, I don't think there will be changes any time soon.

Aaahm, if we use SAGE_SHARE.

Anyway, if things really go bad in future meataxe versions, it should be possible to patch it so that invalid old multiplication tables are automatically removed when accidentally opening them.

In the recent commit, patches `StrassenWinogradImplementation.patch` and `StrassenWinogradUsage.patch` are provided.

There, I implement the Winograd-Strassen multiplication algorithm in MeatAxe. I optimized the cutoff parameter using a Cython wrapper that I didn't post yet (needs doctests and needs to wrap echelonisation).

I tested on matrices of different sizes and different fields. First of all, the school book multiplication in MeatAxe is vastly faster than the current matrix multiplication in Sage for all non-prime finite fields of odd characteristic (of course with field order < 256).

Moreover, it turns out that the Winograd-Strassen implementation is not only asymptotically fast, but even on small examples (200x200) is as fast as MeatAxe's school book multiplication. So, I think it makes sense to use it not only in my Cython wrapper but also in the MeatAxe functions/executables, which is done in `StrassenWinogradUsage.patch`.

The fact that MeatAxe's test suite still works is an indicative that my Winograd-Strassen implementation ok.

Of course it will be even clearer in the Cython wrapper that will be subject of the next commit. Then, I'll show timings.

Done. I kept two commits of largely different purpose. The first makes MeatAxe build and install its tables into `DOT_SAGE`. The second commit implements and uses Winograd-Strassen multiplication in MeatAxe.

The self-tests (by `sage -f -c meataxe`) should pass. I don't know why they are a little flaky. Perhaps a race condition? Anyway, I think that's an upstream problem. Most of the time, the self-tests just pass fine.

The third commit will be cython wrapper for MeatAxe with which I can demonstrate that things work correct and very fast. And then I have to deal with doctests.

Long time ago, I have submitted a Winograd-Strassen patch for version 2.2.4 to upstream. But too much has changed since version 2.2.4, the old patches are useless.

But for sure it makes sense to submit the new three patches to upstream. Even the first one is useful. I wonder why upstream keeps telling that multiplication tables are stored in `MTX_LIB` when in the last 10 years they have always been installed in the current directory.

<div id="comment:67" align="right">comment:67</div>

The last commit really isn't finished yet (most tests and much documentation is missing). But for now it is enough to demonstrate the progress compared with the current Sage beta.

Please make sure that you use [attachment: meataxe-2.4.24.tar.gz,](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12103/dd4467ec9a61dac224ee4826776b23a1.gz) not the source tarball from the upstream download page.

In the latest development version, we have

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5^3,'y'),2000)
sage: %time A = MS.random_element()
CPU times: user 6.71 s, sys: 20 ms, total: 6.73 s
Wall time: 6.79 s
sage: type(A)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>
sage: B = MS.random_element()
sage: %time A*B
CPU times: user 23min 49s, sys: 490 ms, total: 23min 50s
Wall time: 23min 55s # using 7.5% of my computer's memory
2000 x 2000 dense matrix over Finite Field in y of size 5^3 (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: %time ~A
CPU times: user 23min 42s, sys: 842 ms, total: 23min 43s
Wall time: 23min 47s # using 11.3% of my computer's memory
2000 x 2000 dense matrix over Finite Field in y of size 5^3 (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
```

23 minutes for a single multiplication or inversion of a not so big matrix over a small field!!

You see why I see the need of a different backend?

Here is the same example when the optional meataxe package (and its wrapper) is used:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(5^3,'y'),2000)
sage: %time A = MS.random_element()
CPU times: user 320 ms, sys: 5 ms, total: 325 ms
Wall time: 351 ms
sage: type(A)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_modpn_dense.Matrix_modpn_dense'>
sage: B = MS.random_element()
sage: %time A*B  # using 4.8% of my computer's memory
CPU times: user 14.4 s, sys: 1 ms, total: 14.4 s
Wall time: 14.4 s
2000 x 2000 dense matrix over Finite Field in y of size 5^3 (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: %time ~A   # using 5.9% of my computer's memory
CPU times: user 32.7 s, sys: 69 ms, total: 32.8 s
Wall time: 33.2 s
2000 x 2000 dense matrix over Finite Field in y of size 5^3 (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: %time _*A == A*_ == 1
CPU times: user 28.7 s, sys: 60 ms, total: 28.8 s
Wall time: 29 s
True
```
The last example indicates that the (Strassen) multiplication is vastly faster than what we have now in Sage.

Admittedly, the patched MeatAxe is still a lot slower than linbox for prime fields or M4RIE for characteristic 2. That's why I only suggest to use it for non-prime fields of odd characteristic.

By the way, MeatAxe is supposed to have a different kernel for fields of size > 255. But strangely, the respective source file is not in the upstream source tarball.

The patches FOR THE OLD VERSION 2.2.4 that I send to upstream a couple of years ago are useless FOR THE CURRENT VERSION 2.4.24. All function and struct names in MeatAxe have changed between version 2.2.4 and 2.4.24.

That file actually exists: `src/sage/libs/m4rie.pxd`

It's cimported by `matrix_mod2e_dense.pxd`, which is what you should do for meataxe also: separate the Sage matrix stuff from the meataxe library stuff.

Do you suggest to rename Martin Albrecht's `matrix_mod2e_dense.pyx` to `matrix_gf2e_dense.pyx`? By the way, IIRC that's where I got the heading from.

I think we should be consistent with the existing naming scheme. We currently have `matrix_modn_dense`, `matrix_mod2_dense`, `matrix_mod2e_dense`, and the obvious continuation of that scheme is `matrix_modpn_dense`.

OK, if you are so determined, then I better change my module and class name, which is done in the previous (forced) commit.

I think I will now let it rest for a few hours, and then I'll tell how I found the default cutoff for Winograd-Strassen multiplication.

Got it! There is a pointer that is moved through the matrix by which we are multiplying. In case of order two, if an addition of a row happens then the pointer is moved to the next item after the current row of the matrix.

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:95\" align=\"right\">comment:95</div>\n\nI force-pushed the new version.\n\nChanges: The bug is fixed, and FILE and PATCHES are removed.\n\nNow for timings and the quest for a good (default) cutoff.\n\nWhen using Winograd-Strassen, one needs to define a matrix size such that divide-and-conquer is applied if and only if all resulting blocks have at least that size.\n\nMeataxe packs matrix coefficients densely. I.e, if you have a field of size 3, then it will pack 5 matrix coefficients into one byte (`2^5<256`).\n\nEach meataxe matrix is stored in a block of memory, row by row. Internally, meataxe uses \"long\" operations in some functions. That's why each row uses a byte size that is a multiple of sizeof(long), using up to sizeof(long)-1 trailing zero bytes (\"padding bytes\").\n\nWinograd-Strassen operates on matrix windows. It is rather obvious that the window shouldn't end in the middle of a byte, i.e., the number of columns of a window should be a multiple of the \"number of coefficients per byte\".\n\nIn my old patches for version 2.2.4, in fact I used \"byte\" as unit. But in the new patches for version 2.4.24, I adopt meataxe's convention that row length should be divisible by sizeof(long). So, in my Winograd-Strassen implementation, the number of columns of matrix windows is a multiple of \"sizeof(long)*(number of coefficients)\".\n\nConsequently, the cutoff parameter in meataxe is given in the unit \"sizeof(long)\" (in my current cython wrapper the unit is byte, but that's likely to change).\n\nWith the following function used in a Sage session, I have determined the optimal cutoff parameter for different field sizes and different matrix dimensions. Also I have tested for what matrix dimensions the school book algorithm is faster than the Winograd-Strassen algorithm, and I checked that both algorithms yield the same result.\n\n```python\nfrom sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense import Matrix_gfpn_dense\ndef find_cutoff(q, D):\n    print \"GF({})\".format(q)\n    for n in [100,500,1000,2000]:\n        print \"  n = {}:\".format(n),\n        MS = MatrixSpace(GF(q,'x'), n)\n        MS._MatrixSpace__matrix_class = Matrix_gfpn_dense\n        M = MS.random_element()\n        t = cputime()\n        N = M._multiply_classical(M)\n        D[q,n] = set()\n        D[q,n].add((cputime(t),0))\n        for c in range(1,9):\n            print c*8,\n            sys.stdout.flush()\n            t = cputime()\n            N1 = M._multiply_strassen(M, c*8)\n            D[q,n].add((cputime(t), c))\n            assert N1==N\n        print\n        print \"->\",sorted(list((D[q,n])))[:5]\n```\nThe result was\n\n```\nsage: D = {}\nsage: for q in

My guess is that \"4\" is \"sizeof(long)/2\", so that the default cutoff parameter now is \"sizeof(long)/2\". But I could be mistaken. Perhaps on a 32-bit machine, cutoff 4 is better than cutoff \"2==sizeof(long)/2\", and on a 128-bit machine, cutoff 4 is better than cutoff \"8=sizeof(long)/2\"? Or perhaps it all depends on L1/L2 cache size?\n\n**__Request to the reviewer__**\n\n- Do you have access to machines of different architecture (32-bit, 128-bit, different cache sizes)? Could you try to use the function above to find the optimal cutoff parameters?\n- Meataxe uses an environment variable ASM_MMX in the file kernel-0.c. It means that in some functions it uses assembler code in characteristic two. By copying I use it as well, in `FfAddMapRowWindow` mentioned above. In some comment, it says that \"this assumes Intel with 4 bytes per long, but MMX implies Intel anyway.\"\n\n  My questions:\n\n    - Is ASM_MMX some kind of standard variable?\n    - Can you test the package on a machine where ASM_MMX is used?\n\n  Note that I do have Intel, but my longs are 8 bytes, not 4.",

I force-pushed the new version.

Changes: The bug is fixed, and FILE and PATCHES are removed.

Now for timings and the quest for a good (default) cutoff.

When using Winograd-Strassen, one needs to define a matrix size such that divide-and-conquer is applied if and only if all resulting blocks have at least that size.

Meataxe packs matrix coefficients densely. I.e, if you have a field of size 3, then it will pack 5 matrix coefficients into one byte (`2^5<256`).

Each meataxe matrix is stored in a block of memory, row by row. Internally, meataxe uses "long" operations in some functions. That's why each row uses a byte size that is a multiple of sizeof(long), using up to sizeof(long)-1 trailing zero bytes ("padding bytes").

Winograd-Strassen operates on matrix windows. It is rather obvious that the window shouldn't end in the middle of a byte, i.e., the number of columns of a window should be a multiple of the "number of coefficients per byte".

In my old patches for version 2.2.4, in fact I used "byte" as unit. But in the new patches for version 2.4.24, I adopt meataxe's convention that row length should be divisible by sizeof(long). So, in my Winograd-Strassen implementation, the number of columns of matrix windows is a multiple of "sizeof(long)*(number of coefficients)".

Consequently, the cutoff parameter in meataxe is given in the unit "sizeof(long)" (in my current cython wrapper the unit is byte, but that's likely to change).

With the following function used in a Sage session, I have determined the optimal cutoff parameter for different field sizes and different matrix dimensions. Also I have tested for what matrix dimensions the school book algorithm is faster than the Winograd-Strassen algorithm, and I checked that both algorithms yield the same result.

```python
from sage.matrix.matrix_gfpn_dense import Matrix_gfpn_dense
def find_cutoff(q, D):
    print "GF({})".format(q)
    for n in [100,500,1000,2000]:
        print "  n = {}:".format(n),
        MS = MatrixSpace(GF(q,'x'), n)
        MS._MatrixSpace__matrix_class = Matrix_gfpn_dense
        M = MS.random_element()
        t = cputime()
        N = M._multiply_classical(M)
        D[q,n] = set()
        D[q,n].add((cputime(t),0))
        for c in range(1,9):
            print c*8,
            sys.stdout.flush()
            t = cputime()
            N1 = M._multiply_strassen(M, c*8)
            D[q,n].add((cputime(t), c))
            assert N1==N
        print
        print "->",sorted(list((D[q,n])))[:5]
```
The result was

```
sage: D = {}
sage: for q in [2,3,8,9,25,27,32,49,81,125,243]: find_cutoff(q, D)

**__Evaluation of these timings__**

- My Winograd-Strassen implementation gives the same result as meataxe's school book implementation. **--> Hooray**
- There is not a single case (not even for small matrices) where meataxe's school book implementation is significantly faster than Winograd-Strassen **--> Winograd-Strassen should be the default algorithm in matrix_gfpn_dense**
- It seems that a cutoff between 4 and 7 in the unit "sizeof(long)" are about the same, and are generally better than other cutoffs.

The last statement is backed up by another study, where I consider 3601x3601-matrices over different fields, varying the cutoff parameter. I got these timings for multiplication:

Now, the real question is: What is the meaning of "4"? My guess is that "4" is "sizeof(long)/2", so that the default cutoff parameter now is "sizeof(long)/2". But I could be mistaken. Perhaps on a 32-bit machine, cutoff 4 is better than cutoff "2==sizeof(long)/2", and on a 128-bit machine, cutoff 4 is better than cutoff "8=sizeof(long)/2"? Or perhaps it all depends on L1/L2 cache size?

**__Request to the reviewer__**

- Do you have access to machines of different architecture (32-bit, 128-bit, different cache sizes)? Could you try to use the function above to find the optimal cutoff parameters?
- Meataxe uses an environment variable ASM_MMX in the file kernel-0.c. It means that in some functions it uses assembler code in characteristic two. By copying I use it as well, in `FfAddMapRowWindow` mentioned above. In some comment, it says that "this assumes Intel with 4 bytes per long, but MMX implies Intel anyway."

  My questions:

    - Is ASM_MMX some kind of standard variable?
    - Can you test the package on a machine where ASM_MMX is used?

  Note that I do have Intel, but my longs are 8 bytes, not 4.

I tried some tweaks, but it didn't result in a clear improvement. So, I'll now focus on wrapping echelon computation and then on the doctests.

In Gaussian elimination, one adds a scalar multiple of one row to another row. In fact, one knows that pivot of the row to add, i.e., in fact one only needs to add a *part* of the row (namely the part after the pivot). However, MeatAxe did always add the complete rows, including the leading zeroes.

That's obviously a waste of time, and thus I added another patch to MeatAxe in my recent commit.

With the patch:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(GF(25,'x'),5000).random_element(density=0.001)
sage: %time N = M.echelon_form()
CPU times: user 1min 9s, sys: 156 ms, total: 1min 9s
Wall time: 1min 9s
```
Without the patch, it is 1min 31s. I guess that's something.

I am unsure if I will implement echelon computation à la Strassen. If I do, it is essential to be able to add *parts* of a row, because one operates on matrix windows and not on matrices.

Pardon? is $SAGE_LOCAL/include not a standard Sage folder? Or do you mean that I need to do `mkdir -p "$SAGE_LOCAL/include"` because the local/include folder is only created during installation of Sage, making sage a dependency?

Didn't help (edit: ... against the three occurrences of `make -j2 configure`. It did help against `sage -b`).

Sorry for force-pushing again...

In the modified version of the previous commit, I do the "mkdir -p" thingy for all folders that I use ($SAGE_LOCAL/include and $SAGE_LOCAL/bin).

Also, I remove all but one compiler warnings for meataxe. The only remaining warning can not be removed. I need that the function `MatrxiToWindow` has a const argument, because it is used in a multiplication function which has const arguments. However, in `MatrixToWindow`, I assign the const argument to a pointer target type.

I think it is fine to ignore the warning. The matrix definitely is not altered inside of `MatrixToWindow` (but may of course be altered by a function that *later* modifies the window).

<div id="comment:115" align="right">comment:115</div>

I think there is a very severe problem: Error handling.

I thought that meataxe would set an error and then return an error value, for example in matinv.c in the function zmatinv:

```C
	if (f1 == FF_ZERO) 
	{
	    MTX_ERROR1("%E",MTX_ERR_DIV0);
	    return -1;
	}
```
which should propage to the function MatInverse:

```C
    if (zmatinv(tmp,dest->Data) != 0) 
    {
	MatFree(dest);
	return NULL;
    }
    return dest;
```

And in my wrapper, I also test for the error return value:

```python
        sig_on()
        OUT.Data = MatInverse(self.Data)
        sig_off()
        if OUT.Data != NULL:
            return OUT
        raise ArithmeticError("This matrix is not invertible")
```

However, it doesn't work. I get an immediate crash of Sage without any traceback:

```
sage: M = MatrixSpace(GF(27,'x'),5).random_element(density=0.4)
sage: M.rank()
4
sage: ~M
matinv.c(50):Division by zero
```

Hence, I need to study how meataxe manages to crash everything, even though it pretends to handle errors.

I think it is the default error handler doing the following:

```C
static void DefaultHandler(const MtxErrorRecord_t *e)
{
    static int count = 0;
    if (LogFile == NULL)
	LogFile = stderr;

    if (e->FileInfo != NULL)
	fprintf(LogFile,"%s(%d):",e->FileInfo->BaseName,e->LineNo);
    fprintf(LogFile,"%s\n",e->Text);
    if (--count <= 0)
	exit(255);
}
```

Apparently Sage's sig_on()/sig_off() cannot deal with the line `exit(255);`, right?

So, should I patch the default error handler, making it signal something that sig_on()/off() can deal with? What would that be?

Or perhaps I know something better: I think the usual MeatAxe binaries could very well keep using the current error handler. However, in my wrapper, I could instead define a new error handler and set it with `MtxSetErrorHandler`.

I am not sure if the error handler should do sig_error().

There are some places in meataxe where a function A calls a function B, and if B returns an error value then A deallocates temporary data before returning an error value as well.

Wouldn't we prevent meataxe from these clean-up operations (causing a memory leak on error) if we would raise sig_error()?

Replying to [@simon-king-jena](#comment%3A122):
> In sage.libs.gap.util, the error handler sets an exception and signals sig_error(). An alternative approach would be an error handler that just sets an exception. If the meataxe functions are wrapped with an error value (such as `cdef Matrix_t *MatInverse(Matrix_t M) except NULL`) then this error would be raised, wouldn't it?

At least in theory, that would work. You do need to be sure that the result is `NULL` **if and only if** the error handler was called. I agree that it would be cleaner if you can make it work because that would completely bypass the `sig_on()` system.

I was mistaken in one point: `MtxErrorRecord_t` does not contain the error code. It only contains a message that was created from the error record. The error messages are taken from a "static struct" that is part of the file message.c

Since the list of these error messages is finite and is in one-to-one correspondence to the error codes, I will translate each mesage back into the error code and use the appropriate error (`ZeroDivisionError`, `MemoryError`, `ArithmeticError` etc).

If you think that it isn't worth it, I could instead create a new error type `MtxError`, that is raised whenever an error occurs in meataxe. But I will go for the "long" solution, if you don't stop me...

I have fixed the computation of row-reduced echelon form.

- With the current branch, meataxe in Sage is substantially improved compared with upstream (fixes for multiplication table IO, some speed-ups for echelon computation, Strassen-Winograd, error handling).
- Matrix arithmetic over small non-prime fields of odd order will be vastly faster with meataxe than with the previously used matrix implementation in Sage.
- Doctest coverage of the Cython wrapper is 100%.
- `make test` should now pass (I need to re-run "make test" after fixing the errors, though).

Hence: Needs review!

Motivated by the attempt to rebase my cohomology package on the new meataxe version, I try to be a bit more careful concerning errors in meataxe.

I made a thorough list of all functions in meataxe that use MTX_ERROR (or some variation thereof). I found that not all of them have error values set. Some of them have a documentation defining an error value, but the function in some cases does not return them. And if a function returning an error value is called by a second function, then the error value is not always dealt with.

It would be a very messy work to fix error handling thoroughly. I thus try to go a middle way:
- I will ignore MeatAxe's stand-alone programs, because they are *supposed* to immediately exit on error. In particular, I will also ignore functions checking command line arguments.
- I will try to only deal with functions that are relevant for matrix arithmetic, because that's the only part of meataxe that I am wrapping here.

Hence, if someone in future wants to wrap the more interesting parts of MeatAxe (all the representation theory stuff), then he or she has to deal with it.

To summarise, it seems to me that everything concerning

- stand-alone programs
- test suite
- "bit strings"
- polynomials and their factorisation (I currently do not wrap characteristic polynomials!)
- "greased" matrices (but see below!)
- integer matrices (I am only interested in finite fields)
- representations
- lattices
- matrix sets
- sets
- permutations
- operating system stuff. I am not going to fix setting a timeout in meataxe, because we can set a timeout in Sage, with `alarm(...)`, provided that we wrap meataxe calls in sig_on()/sig_off().
- word generators

is not relevant at that point. I'll focus on what remains.

__Greased matrices__

Something that I have ignored but perhaps should consider in future: "Greased matrices". From the documentation, it seems that greased matrices use more memory, but have faster row operations achieved by precomputing linear combinations of blocks of rows. So, if meataxe becomes an optional package with `Matrix_gfpn_dense` wrapping meataxe matrices, then a further development would be a wrapper for greased matrices.

Upstream's answer:

```
I am currently working on a 2.4 release that will solve some known 
problems and hopefully not break anthing else (it's been a long
time since I last touched the code...). The next TAR release will
contain a properly named root directory as you suggested. 

I am not sure, however, when the release will be ready.

Any answer from upstream?

Do you have an idea who could review those patches, because I seems to me that it should only be reviewed by somebody who knows meataxe.

One detail I spotted in the code: replace `except:` by `except BaseException:` (I assume that people write `except:` by mistake, so it's better to be explicit that you really want to catch everything).

This might be difficult. But the following should be possible even without deeper knowledge of meataxe:
- Does the package keeps the promise that multiplication tables (name pXYZ.zzz, where XYZ is the order of the field) will not pollute the current directory?
- Are there memory leaks? Combine various random matrices by stacking, slicing, multiplication, copying etc, delete everything, repeat in a loop, and see if any memory is lost.
- Manually create the same large random matrices once in meataxe and once in the current sage backends. That includes the case of fields of characteristic 2 and prime fields, where meataxe will not be used by default. Then do arithmetic, including echolonization, and compare (using `M.list()`) if the results coincide in all implementations. There are examples of that type in the docs.

A fair comment, but those standard backends are not heavily patched with patches which are not accepted by upstream.

Upstream code does not need a review, but these patches *do* need a review.

I think you are still mis-using some of the error handling.

For example, you have

```
int MatEchelonize(Matrix_t *mat) except -1
```
but you still write

```
        if MatEchelonize(self.Data) == -1:
            raise ArithmeticError("Error echelonizing this matrix")
```
The latter should just be

```
MatEchelonize(self.Data)

<div id="comment:165" align="right">comment:165</div>

The problem was: The default implementation of unpickling relies on `set_unsafe(i,j,val)`. In my implementation, `set_unsafe` relies on a converter from finite field elements to the internal representation---and the converter is not created during the unpickling.

Hence, I created a custom `__reduce__` relying on some unpickling function.

There, I used the occasion to return to what I did in the old group cohomology spkg: Pickling is *not* by conversion of the matrix to a list of entries, but it dumps the densely packed internal representation. Advantage: It is a lot faster!

For the group cohomology spkg, it was checked that the internal representation does not depend on details such as big versus little endian machines: A pickle created on a big-endian machine can correctly be unpickled with a little-endian machine.

Another advantage of the new approach will be apparent in #18514: Since the new pickling/unpickling  scheme for meataxe matrices is a lot closer to the scheme used in the old group cohomology spkg, the *new* group cohomology package should relatively easily be able to read data from existing cohomology data bases.
