On Gentoo Linux x86_64 and on sage.math running sage-4.8.alpha6 + #11073 (but *without* #12263):

Use a "screen" terminal.

When $DOT_SAGE (and therefore, $HOME) contains a specific number of characters in relation to the number of columns on the pseudo-terminal ($COLUMNS), failures happen.  I believe this is due to temporary filenames word-wrapping in the pseudo-terminal (pty).  The pty seems to inherit properties of the actual terminal, that's why there are failures with screen but not with xterm.

For example, on a 138-column terminal:

```
( export HOME=/mnt/usb1/scratch/jdemeyer/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; mkdir -p $HOME; ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/schemes )
[...]
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py"

**How to reproduce this more artificially**:
apply [attachment: 12221_debug.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12221/12221_debug.patch.gz).  This will send all gp pexpect commands less than 200 characters directly to gp, without using a temporary file.  The problem is the filename length of the temporary files used in the read() command.  This depends on `$DOT_SAGE`, on the hostname, on process IDs.

Download [attachment: test12221.sage](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12221/test12221.sage.gz) and run (from within a "screen" session).  This will execute a read() command with increasing filename lengths:

```
$ ./sage test12221.sage
```
I see

```
TERM = screen
18 char filename: ok
19 char filename: ok
20 char filename: ok
[...]
68 char filename: ok
69 char filename: ok
70 char filename: fail
[...]

I can reproduce the failing test12221.sage at home in a screen session, but it goes away with TERM=dumb.

On sage.math the test doesn't fail for me, but I do get a lot of escape sequences (1b 4d, followed by a lot of 1b 5b 43, followed by a 1b 5b 4b) when the length hits 70.

Well,
I'm not too fond of mixing up the change of "eval_using_file_cutoff" value from 50 to 1024 (in "12221_pexpect_unset_TERM.patch") on the one hand, and the safer handling of the "TERM" envorinment variable on the other hand --- these seem orthogonal action items to me, being worth independent tickets.

However, none of these changes makes the situation worse than before, and the cleaning up of the pexpect spkg alone is worth to have this getting in the main tree as soon as possible.


Cheers,
Georg
