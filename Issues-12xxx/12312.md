<div id="comment:0"></div>

From the spkg-install of ATLAS:

```
# we need to disable parallel builds
os.environ['MAKE'] += ' -j1'
```
but later in the same file:

```
rc = os.system('make shared cshared')
```

The latter command doesn't see the "-j1", therefore might be built in parallel since #12016.  The solution is to replace "make" by "$MAKE".

I'm making this a sage-4.8 blocker, since this causes the Solaris linker to hang.
