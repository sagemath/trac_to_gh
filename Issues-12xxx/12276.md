<div id="comment:0"></div>

On machines where the system `gd` is build with jpeg support, `dvipng` will fail with missing symbols:

```
WARNING: display latex u'10^8': dvipng exited with error:
  [stderr]
  dvipng: symbol lookup error: dvipng: undefined symbol:
          gdImageCreateFromJpegPtr 
```

because sage's `gd` is built without jpeg support.

This breaks pretty much all of the reference documentation.

Some potential solutions:

* Remove the `--without-jpeg` flag from the `gd` spkg
* Package `dvipng` with sage, and build it against sage's `gd`
* Don't hide the system `gd` if it's present while building the docs

The docs now default to using MathJax, which fixes that problem, but we're traded it for a worse one: I can no longer plot anything.

With a fresh sage-5.10.rc2:

```
sage: plot(sin,x,-1,1)                                          
dvipng: symbol lookup error: dvipng: undefined symbol: gdImageCreateFromJpegPtr
...
RuntimeError: dvipng was not able to process the following file:
/home/mjo/.sage//matplotlib-1.2.1/tex.cache/c97c52e62b093248234a0445c488a218.dvi
Here is the full report generated by dvipng:


```

The error only occurs within sage; if I run dvipng manually (not within `sage -sh`), it works fine. If I run it within `sage -sh`, it crashes with the missing symbols error.

The problem is the same as the original report. You can't expect my dvipng to be built against a gd with the same flags as the one shipped by sage.

This only occurs when you use latex for the text in the plot. I do that in my init.sage, so to reproduce,

sage --nodotsage

```
sage: from matplotlib import rcParams
sage: rcParams['text.usetex'] = True
sage: plot(sin,x,-1,1)
<boom>
```

See #13543 for why you might want to use a real latex implementation.

* Install the optional (currently outdated I guess) jpeg spkg.

* Make sure `dvipng` isn't called with Sage's environment set up (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`; use `sage-native-execute` or whatever).

* Local fix:  Set `RUN_PATH` in the `dvipng` executable... ;-)

E.g. create a wrapper script `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/dvipng` that calls `sage-native-execute dvipng "$@"`.

Interestingly enough, the wrapper script eats up 100% CPU and never terminates.

That's because `sage-native-execute` does not yet restore the original `PATH`.
