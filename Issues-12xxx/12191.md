sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: (4*x).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: (4*x).is_squarefree()
True
sage: (QQ(4)*x).is_squarefree()
True
sage: 4.is_squarefree()
False
sage: P(4).is_squarefree()
True
```

The first and last should of course be False, as `2^2` is a divisor.

All doctests work with version 4.7.2. Also tests of the following form also work:

```
sage: R.<x>=GF(3)['x']
sage: (x^2+1).is_squarefree()
True
sage: (x^2+x+1).is_squarefree()
False
sage: R.<x>=ZZ[]
sage: R(x^2).is_squarefree()
False
sage: R(4*x).is_squarefree()
False
sage: R(2*x).is_squarefree()
True
sage: R(x^2+2*x+1).is_squarefree()
False
```
The bug appears to be fixed
