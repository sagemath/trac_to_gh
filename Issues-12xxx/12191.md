Keywords: sd35 squarefree integer polynomial

```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: (4*x).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: (4*x).is_squarefree()
True
sage: (QQ(4)*x).is_squarefree()
True
sage: 4.is_squarefree()
False
sage: P(4).is_squarefree()
True
```

The first and last should of course be False, as `2^2` is a divisor.

this does not work for polynomials over orders. Is it supposed to?

```
sage: R1.<a1>=NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: R2=R1.maximal_order()
sage: P.<x>=R2[x]
sage: P(x).is_squarefree()
<lots of rubbish>
