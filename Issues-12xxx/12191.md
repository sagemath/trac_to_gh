sage: (QQ(4)*x).is_squarefree()

The first and last should of course be False, as `2^2` is a divisor.

The problem was that is_squarefree doesn't look at the content of the polynomial. It should be fixed with 12191.patch.

All doctests work with version 4.7.2. Also tests of the following form also work:

```
sage: R.<x>=GF(3)['x']
sage: (x^2+1).is_squarefree()
True
sage: (x^2+x+1).is_squarefree()
False
sage: R.<x>=ZZ[]
sage: R(x^2).is_squarefree()
False
sage: R(4*x).is_squarefree()
False
sage: R(2*x).is_squarefree()
True
sage: R(x^2+2*x+1).is_squarefree()
False
```
The bug appears to be fixed

this does not work for polynomials over orders. Is it supposed to?

```
sage: R1.<a1>=NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: R2=R1.maximal_order()
sage: P.<x>=R2[x]
sage: P(x).is_squarefree()
<lots of rubbish>

This has to do with the fact that the content of a polynomial is not always well defined. Furthermore, the is_squarefree function is not defined for say Dedekind domains.
