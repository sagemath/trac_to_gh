This is due to stricter (C++11) name look-up rules in GCC 4.7.x.

I've created an spkg with a trivial fix, just adding `-fpermissive` to `CXXFLAGS` if we're using `g++` 4.7.x:

**New spkg:** [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/linbox-1.1.6.p10.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/linbox-1.1.6.p10.spkg)

### linbox-1.1.6.p10 (Jeroen Demeyer, 25 May 2012)
* #12762 review: Remove the touching of linbox.pyx, since
  Cython knows the dependency of linbox.pyx on linbox-sage.h
* Only add the -fpermissive workaround on GCC-4.7.x, not other
  compilers.

### linbox-1.1.6.p9 (Leif Leonhardy, April 7th 2012)
* #12762: Temporarily add `-fpermissive` to `CXXFLAGS` if we're compiling
  with `g++` 4.7.x, since the LinBox sources currently don't conform to
  C++11, so GCC 4.7.x would otherwise reject them.
* Exit if the build failed.
* Use `CFLAG64` if it is set (and `SAGE64=yes`).
* Clean up `spkg-install`, add some messages.
* Add an `spkg-check` file, which currently runs `make check`. (There's also
  a `fullcheck` target.)
* Change patch to disable the commentator, as default parameters were missing
  with `-DDISABLE_COMMENTATOR`, such that the test suite wouldn't build.
  Also, one must not unconditionally use `extern` for the global (dummy)
  commentator since this is C++, and doing so also breaks the test suite.
* Fix (i.e. patch) the sources such that the test suite (`make check`) builds,
  also with GCC 4.7.0.
* Add the "Special Update/Build Instructions" section.

+### linbox-1.1.6.p8 (Leif Leonhardy, April 7th 2012)
+* #12762: Temporarily add `-fpermissive` to `CXXFLAGS` if we're compiling
+  with `g++` 4.7.x, since the LinBox sources currently don't conform to
+  C++11, so GCC 4.7.x would otherwise reject them.
+* Exit if the build failed.
+* Use `CFLAG64` if it is set (and `SAGE64=yes`).
+* Clean up `spkg-install`, add some messages.
+* Add an `spkg-check` file, which currently runs `make check`. (There's also
+  a `fullcheck` target.)
+* Change patch to disable the commentator, as default parameters were missing
+  with `-DDISABLE_COMMENTATOR`, such that the test suite wouldn't build.
+  Also, one must not unconditionally use `extern` for the global (dummy)
+  commentator since this is C++, and doing so also breaks the test suite.
+* Fix (i.e. patch) the sources such that the test suite (`make check`) builds,
+  also with GCC 4.7.0.
+* Add the "Special Update/Build Instructions" section.
+
+
+---
+
+See #12751 for the GCC-4.7.0 metaticket.

Ok, changed and added a couple of things in addition, among these an `spkg-check` file, and changes to upstream code and the "disable commentator" patch to make the test suite build (see changelog entry in the ticket's description and the attached diff for details).
