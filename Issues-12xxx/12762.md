This is due to stricter (C++11) name look-up rules in GCC 4.7.x.

I've created an spkg with a trivial fix, just adding `-fpermissive` to `CXXFLAGS` if we're using `g++` 4.7.x:

**New spkg:** [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/linbox-1.1.6.p10.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/linbox-1.1.6.p10.spkg)

### linbox-1.1.6.p10 (Jeroen Demeyer, 25 May 2012)
* #12762 review: Remove the touching of linbox.pyx, since
  Cython knows the dependency of linbox.pyx on linbox-sage.h
* Only add the -fpermissive workaround on GCC-4.7.x, not other
  compilers.

### linbox-1.1.6.p9 (Leif Leonhardy, April 7th 2012)
* #12762: Temporarily add `-fpermissive` to `CXXFLAGS` if we're compiling
  with `g++` 4.7.x, since the LinBox sources currently don't conform to
  C++11, so GCC 4.7.x would otherwise reject them.
* Exit if the build failed.
* Use `CFLAG64` if it is set (and `SAGE64=yes`).
* Clean up `spkg-install`, add some messages.
* Add an `spkg-check` file, which currently runs `make check`. (There's also
  a `fullcheck` target.)
* Change patch to disable the commentator, as default parameters were missing
  with `-DDISABLE_COMMENTATOR`, such that the test suite wouldn't build.
  Also, one must not unconditionally use `extern` for the global (dummy)
  commentator since this is C++, and doing so also breaks the test suite.
* Fix (i.e. patch) the sources such that the test suite (`make check`) builds,
  also with GCC 4.7.0.
* Add the "Special Update/Build Instructions" section.

Ok, changed and added a couple of things in addition, among these an `spkg-check` file, and changes to upstream code and the "disable commentator" patch to make the test suite build (see changelog entry in the ticket's description and the attached diff for details).

New spkg, same place, changes now committed, ready to test & review... :P

P.S.:

There's a not that recent "stable" LinBox version 1.1.7, as well as IIRC more recent "instable" 1.2.x development versions.  (Unfortunately there's [no changelog entry for the 1.1.7 version](http://linalg.org/NEWS-1.1.html), at least not online.)

Haven't yet tried any of these, but upgrading -- if worthwhile -- should IMHO be done on another ticket; making the spkg build with GCC 4.7.x, adding an `spkg-check` file and making the test suite build seems more important (or urgent) to me.

I tried this spkg this morning and it failed ; the compile lines lack the -fpermissive, even though I see the code in spkg-install which is supposed to add it...

Notice that it was with a fairly extensively modified sage-5.0.rc1, so maybe the failure isn't that conclusive, but I still thought it was worth reporting.

I noticed two things :
1. the only directory where the current patch doesn't work is interfaces/sage/ : the rest builds ok!
2. if there is nothing in patches/, then spkg-install errors out.

I settled to fix the matter, but must admit my failure : even if I manage to get the -fpermissive through (adding directly to interfaces/sage/Makefile.am... not clean at all), the build still fails with this error :
