This is due to stricter (C++11) name look-up rules in GCC 4.7.x.

I've created an spkg with a trivial fix, just adding `-fpermissive` to `CXXFLAGS` if we're using `g++` 4.7.x:

**New spkg:** [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/linbox-1.1.6.p10.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/linbox-1.1.6.p10.spkg)

### linbox-1.1.6.p10 (Jeroen Demeyer, 25 May 2012)
* #12762 review: Remove the touching of linbox.pyx, since
  Cython knows the dependency of linbox.pyx on linbox-sage.h
* Only add the -fpermissive workaround on GCC-4.7.x, not other
  compilers.

### linbox-1.1.6.p9 (Leif Leonhardy, April 7th 2012)
* #12762: Temporarily add `-fpermissive` to `CXXFLAGS` if we're compiling
  with `g++` 4.7.x, since the LinBox sources currently don't conform to
  C++11, so GCC 4.7.x would otherwise reject them.
* Exit if the build failed.
* Use `CFLAG64` if it is set (and `SAGE64=yes`).
* Clean up `spkg-install`, add some messages.
* Add an `spkg-check` file, which currently runs `make check`. (There's also
  a `fullcheck` target.)
* Change patch to disable the commentator, as default parameters were missing
  with `-DDISABLE_COMMENTATOR`, such that the test suite wouldn't build.
  Also, one must not unconditionally use `extern` for the global (dummy)
  commentator since this is C++, and doing so also breaks the test suite.
* Fix (i.e. patch) the sources such that the test suite (`make check`) builds,
  also with GCC 4.7.0.
* Add the "Special Update/Build Instructions" section.

P.S.:

There's a not that recent "stable" LinBox version 1.1.7, as well as IIRC more recent "instable" 1.2.x development versions.  (Unfortunately there's [no changelog entry for the 1.1.7 version](http://linalg.org/NEWS-1.1.html), at least not online.)

Haven't yet tried any of these, but upgrading -- if worthwhile -- should IMHO be done on another ticket; making the spkg build with GCC 4.7.x, adding an `spkg-check` file and making the test suite build seems more important (or urgent) to me.

I tried this spkg this morning and it failed ; the compile lines lack the -fpermissive, even though I see the code in spkg-install which is supposed to add it...

Notice that it was with a fairly extensively modified sage-5.0.rc1, so maybe the failure isn't that conclusive, but I still thought it was worth reporting.

I noticed two things :
1. the only directory where the current patch doesn't work is interfaces/sage/ : the rest builds ok!
2. if there is nothing in patches/, then spkg-install errors out.

I settled to fix the matter, but must admit my failure : even if I manage to get the -fpermissive through (adding directly to interfaces/sage/Makefile.am... not clean at all), the build still fails with this error :
linbox-sage.C:463:13: error: ‘NTL_ZZ’ was not declared in this scope
