At our dear leader's request I am adding a test file for the Qhull optional package.  

This will be quite minimal, since what I'd really like is to add a Qhull backend for the Polyhedron class, which would come with its own tests.  

If anyone is interested in adding more elaborate tests it wouldn't be very hard since the documentation at [the Qhull site](http://www.qhull.org/) is pretty good.

+1. There is no interface being tested or so.
