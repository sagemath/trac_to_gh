When upgrading the networkx package to 1.6, there arise a lot of doctest errors, see discussion on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/60e2704e68cad4f4).
This ticket should contain everything that is necessary to do so.

To get the doctests passing, the following modifications have been made:
1. Fixed the calls in `graph.py` to conform to the new API for `betweennness_centrality`. Also exposed the new options.
2. Failing doctest in `digraph.py` was shocasing a bug that isn't there anymore. Fixed and documented it, and exposed the previously offending implementation to sage
3. Two failures in `graph_generators.py` were due to changes in randomized methods, so just changed the tests to conform to the new output, the rest were due to a bad-parameter case that was used to raise an exception but now degenerates gracefully. Fixed the corresponding doctests to account for that.
4. Failures in `graph_generic.py` were due to a change in the output of clustering coefficients for weighted graphs. Added an optional parameter to use the new output, implemented the old behaviour as it was in NetworkX 1.2, and set the old behaviour to default with a deprecation warning.

I made a package networkx-1.6, which is available [here](http://www.math.tugraz.at/~krenn/whatever/networkx-1.6.spkg). 

There are a lot of doctests failing in sage.graphs.

<a id='comment:5'></a>
The failing tests in graph.py are due to an API change in the betweenness_centrality function.
They get fixed by replacing

```
    return networkx.betweenness_centrality(self.networkx_graph(copy=False), normalized)
```
in line 3252 of SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph.py by

```
    return networkx.betweenness_centrality(self.networkx_graph(copy=False), normalized = normalized)
```
I will take a look at the rest of the failing tests tomorrow and write a patch.

Thanks for the prompt response, Keshav! The reviewer patch looks good to me, so I guess we can consider this reviewed!

Now it is time for all the graph people to start doing cool stuff with all the great functionalities of NetworkX we have been missing out! :-D

There were a few other build errors, and incorrect linking syntax.  I'll fix these.

Also, is 

```
equivalent to ``weight = weight``
```
supposed to be

```
equivalent to ``weight = 'weight'``
```
since weight takes a boolean or a string?

I must have messed up my patch queue at some stage. I am building a clean version of sage right now, will made a new patch on top of it if you don't beat me to it.
