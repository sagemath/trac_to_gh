The reason sage -coverage was complaining is because of the comment placed *before* the docstring. I.e. it's not clever enough to parse

```python
def some_function(args):
    # comment
    """ docstring """
    function_body
```
I'm about to upload a tiny reviewer patch which moves the comment in `_lmul_` to after the docstring, and thus gets coverage up to 100%.

Looks pretty good.  Considering that the changes you made after colons were all in underscored functions, so they didn't appear in the reference manual anyway, Hugh did good work too :)

Question:

```

def unpickle(cls, parent, mutability, cache, data, version):
    r"""
    Unpickle a matrix. This is only used internally by Sage. Users
    should never call this function directly.
    
    EXAMPLES: We illustrating saving and loading several different
    types of matrices.
    
    OVER `\ZZ`::
    
        sage: A = matrix(ZZ,2,range(4))
        sage: loads(dumps(A)) # indirect doctest
        [0 1]
        [2 3]
    
    Sparse OVER `\QQ`:
    
    Dense over `\QQ[x,y]`:
    
    Dense over finite field.
    """
```
?  Since this was there before, I guess it's not necessarily going to make this 'needs work', but I am a little mystified by what the story behind this is.  Should we open a ticket for this?
