We should get rid of MoinMoin as a standard spkg. It is not used by anything in Sage AFAIK. (There has been some discussion about this on sage-devel.) In particular, there was [a vote](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/XO5sG3nr6sU/discussion) in which (as of March 28) no one objected to removing MoinMoin. There wasn't great consensus about what to do with the package afterwards, but making it "experimental" has support and seems like the right choice: then it is still available but no one has to commit to be the maintainer.

To apply:

- Remove the file `spkg/standard/moin-1.9.1.p2.spkg`.
- Apply [attachment:trac_12713-root.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12713/trac_12713-root.patch) to the root repository.
- Apply [and [attachment:12713-sage-review.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12713/b5958f8d7086167fe8a2d6ec729a04f2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12713/7404d6c59f9d064d3e5fe9d31462c5c8.patch)) to the Sage repository.
- Apply [attachment:trac_12713-scripts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12713/trac_12713-scripts.patch) to the scripts repository.
- Apply [attachment:trac_12713-sagenb.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12713/trac_12713-sagenb.patch) to the sagenb repository.

For what it's worth, I removed the moin spkg and modified `spkg/install` and `spkg/standard/deps` in the obvious ways. Sage built and all tests passed.

Should we really remove all traces of MoinMoin (or any kind of wiki) from Sage?

If we keep it as an optional (or experimental) spkg, we could treat it as such, just like the others.  I.e., just add checks whether it is present / installed, and give messages according to the result.
