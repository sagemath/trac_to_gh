As discussed on the sage-devel mailing-list, that code uses "char" to read&write pickles on all platforms.

Unfortunately on ARM, "char" means "unsigned char", while on most other platforms, it means "signed char".

The solution is to make that code use "signed char" explicitly ; that way we unbreak the ARM pickles.
