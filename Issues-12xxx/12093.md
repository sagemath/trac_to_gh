Currently there is one failing test in `"devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_rings/homset.py"`.

```
sage: H = Hom(GF(32, 'a'), GF(1024, 'b'))
sage: type(H[2:4])    # w/o patch
<class 'sage.structure.sequence.Sequence_generic'>
sage: type(H[2:4])    # w/ patch
<type 'list'>
```
Suggestions to solve this problem are welcome.
