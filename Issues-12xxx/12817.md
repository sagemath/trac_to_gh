This could potentially be useful, but the docs only mention the following inputs:

* Variable name(s)
* latex_name
* print_latex_func

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')          
sage: f = function('f', nargs=1)
sage: f(x,y)

The documentation of any of those can use improvement, but I'm not sure you want to explain all options in all of their docstrings. Perhaps a good cross reference can save some work.
