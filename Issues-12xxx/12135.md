Sage handles multiple loops on one vertex inconsistently.

```
sage:g=Graph({0:[0,0]}, loops=True, multiedges=True, implementation="c_graph")
sage:g.edges()
[(0, 0, None), (0, 0, None)]
sage:g.delete_edge(0,0)
sage:g.edges()
[]
```

Compare with

```
sage:g=Graph({0:[0,0]}, loops=True, multiedges=True, implementation="networkx")
sage:g.edges()
[(0, 0, None), (0, 0, None)]
sage:g.delete_edge(0,0)
sage:g.edges()
[(0, 0, None)]
```

and

```
sage:g=Graph({0:[1,1]}, loops=True, multiedges=True, implementation="c_graph")
sage:g.edges()
[(0, 1, None), (0, 1, None)]
sage:g.delete_edge(0,1)
sage:g.edges()

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

A loop is stored as a single arc, but del_edge removes both ends:

```
self._cg.del_arc_label(u_int, v_int, l_int)
self._cg.del_arc_label(v_int, u_int, l_int)
```

So...

```
sage: g=Graph({0:[0]*11}); len(g.edges())
11
sage: g.delete_edge(0,0); len(g.edges())
9
sage: g.delete_edge(0,0); len(g.edges())
7
sage: g.delete_edge(0,0); len(g.edges())
5
```

Here is a one-line patch to add the "::" at the end of the line before the tests. If if it ok with you, the patch can be set to "positive_review". `:-)`
