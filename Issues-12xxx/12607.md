The fact that zero-dimensional cohomology groups are reported above and below the non-trivial range is already somewhat annoying, so I propose to fix this by changing the `homology` method to chop off these irrelevant zeroes. This would then have the additional benefit of the representation no longer depending on whether or not ChomP is installed. So the output for the homology of the 2-sphere should be

{0: Z, 1: 0, 2: Z}

I'm not sure what you mean by irrelevant zeroes: if we chop off zeroes, then should the reduced homology of the 2-sphere just be `{2: Z}`? That is overly brief, I think. The answer

```
{0: 0, 1: 0, 2: Z, 3: 0}
```
for the homology of the fan includes dimensions 0-3 because those are the dimensions in which the chain complex is nonzero.  I think it makes sense to include those groups, whether zero or not.

I think that the CHomP interface should be fixed so that we don't have this issue: it can detect the upper and lower dimensions of the complex, and then pad with zeroes as necessary.  It might also make sense to add a flag for the homology method to only return nontrivial groups.

We need to fix the failures in `delta_complex.py`. It would be nice to fix the ones in `tests.py`, but that could be done on another ticket. (This is on OS X, for what that's worth.)
