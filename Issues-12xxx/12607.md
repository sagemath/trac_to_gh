I'm not sure what you mean by irrelevant zeroes: if we chop off zeroes, then should the reduced homology of the 2-sphere just be `{2: Z}`? That is overly brief, I think. The answer

```
{0: 0, 1: 0, 2: Z, 3: 0}
```
for the homology of the fan includes dimensions 0-3 because those are the dimensions in which the chain complex is nonzero.  I think it makes sense to include those groups, whether zero or not.

I think that the CHomP interface should be fixed so that we don't have this issue: it can detect the upper and lower dimensions of the complex, and then pad with zeroes as necessary.  It might also make sense to add a flag for the homology method to only return nontrivial groups.
