Implementation of finite algebras over fields.  A finite algebra *A* is simply given by means of a basis and for each basis element *e* a matrix that describes (right) multiplication of *A* by *e*.

The basic set-up is for algebras that are not necessarily unitary, commutative, or associative.  Only algebras that satisfy all these conditions are fully supported.

I've uploaded a combined patch.  A few remarks about documentation:

* Please be more precise:  Is your inverse a left or right inverse?  Same question about zero divisors, etc.
* In the first line of a docstring, put the verb in the imperative (not extremely important, but more direct and grammatically better than "Returns blabla" without a subject).
* Put a blank line between the double colon and the doctests (used for html generation of documentation).

Thanks for your suggestions.  I should probably have let you look at it *before* asking for a review. :-)

I thought about including some of these things, but decided that having a usable framework was the first priority.  But you are certainly right that these improvements should be made.  They shouldn't take a lot of work.

Thanks for looking at this.  To me, changing "finite" to "finite-dimensional" is OK; in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry it is very common to say "finite *A*-algebra" for an algebra that is finitely generated as an *A*-module, but in a general setting like Sage, it is possibly ambiguous.  Since the base ring is (at least currently) always a field, "finite-dimensional" is an acceptable way of clarifying this.

I haven't had the time to review your changes in detail, but here are a few things I noticed:
- you changed "EXAMPLE::" to "EXAMPLES::" in many places where there is only one example; do you have a reason for this?
- I think it should be "finite-dimensional algebra", not "finite dimensional algebra", since "finite-dimensional" is used as a single adjective.
- Are you sure that the inverse of an element should be cached?  This looks like it could waste a lot of memory.  My impression is that in general only properties of parents should be cached.  If any inverse should be cached at all, why not just that of the underlying matrix?

As I understand it, `EXAMPLES::` (and `TESTS::`) is the standard idiom, not the singular version even if there is only one such example. Although I seem to have missed some that I should also change to be consistent, unless you feel that I should change them back (I don't hold a strong opinion on this).

Will change.

> - Are you sure that the inverse of an element should be cached?  This looks like it could waste a lot of memory.  My impression is that in general only properties of parents should be cached.  If any inverse should be cached at all, why not just that of the underlying matrix?


It depends. Things that are very memory/computationally intensive to compute but not to store are candidates for a cache, especially when it's likely to be a bottleneck.

Also it's not using much more memory by caching the element as opposed to the matrix (nor does it generate a memory leak). So let's say `x^-1 = y`, then `x` has `y` stored in its cache. So once you delete `x`, you also delete the cache containing `y`. Perhaps what we should do is have a ``@`lazy_attribute` called `_inverse` which will point to `y`, and then if we construct `x^-1`, we can set `y._inverse = x`.

The other option if you're worried about memory usage is to make it a ``@`weak_cached_function`, which allows it to be garbage collected if there is no strong reference to `x^-1` and memory is needed elsewhere.
