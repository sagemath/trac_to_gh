```
The script prereq-0.9-install starts with the line

```
#!/bin/sh
```
As a result, when installing prereq on a Solaris machine, I see this:

```
Starting prerequisite check.
Machine: SunOS mark2 5.10 Generic_127111-01 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Blade-2500
base/prereq-0.9-install: !: not found
checking for a BSD-compatible install... ./install-sh -c
```
I think this is because of the line

```
if ! [ -f "$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/base/$TARGET.tar" ]; then
```
in prereq-0.9-install. Using bash to run this script instead of sh fixes the problem. So I propose using bash for this script.

This will be fixed in #12112.

Depends on #4949
