Google told me that some people suggested to "include cstdio to obtain std::FILE". So, I tried to add

```
#include <cstdio.h>
```
to gmp.h. However, after I attempted to build it, that line was gone!!

Can someone explain how I can avoid that my editing the file is reverted? Perhaps I need to do my change in the "patches" directory?

Yeah, I made some progress!!

I found that I needed to edit `src/gmp-h.in`, and I needed to `#include <cstdio>`, but only `#if defined (__cplusplus)`.

Then, building the package went beyond the point where it failed previously. However, it turns out that the gmp package requires yacc. I am insalling it now.

TODO (for the moment):

- Turn my changes to `src/gmp-h.in` into a patch, to be put into the `patches` directory.
- spkg-install should check for the presence of yacc.

While I was at it, I tried to upgrade to gmp 5.0.4. Unfortunately, it complains that it can not find bdivmod.c in the path -- the old spkg contains that file in src/mpn/generic, but the original gmp 5.0.4 sources do no contain bdivmod.c in src/mpn/generic. Too bad.

Anyway. Since the current spkg is broken (at least on openSuse), I still think we should upgrade. But people need to test on different platforms.

FWIW, I did build Sage against GMP (5.0.1 or 5.0.2) a couple of times in 2010 (when we made the "first big PARI upgrade") and never ran into any problems, except for the Lcalc spkg, which was the only one explicitly using `-lmpir` instead of `-lgmp`, an issue which AFAIK meanwhile is fixed.

Although I looked at the (btw. completely outdated) optional GMP spkg (on other occasions as well), I didn't use any of it, in particular didn't apply any additional patches to the more recent GMP versions.

---

We'll probably only run into trouble with using GMP instead of MPIR the day we upgrade FLINT, as newer (2.x, but IIRC only the most recent) versions of FLINT use some *MPIR* internals GMP doesn't provide, or at least isn't compatible with.

But for the moment it should be ok to use GMP instead, although (for CLooG) this shouldn't be necessary.

(In contrast, as Dima recently mentioned on sage-devel and mpir-devel, GAP uses some GMP internals MPIR currently doesn't provide.  The [older?] version of GAP we use apparently works with MPIR... :-) )

No problem, I found the solution more than easily on the web.

Any other suggestion from sage-on-gentoo?
E.g., do you have devised any simple way to switch from gmp to mpir and back again easily?
Or are you really stuck with gmp and cannot use mpir? (that would be strange.)

We are really stuck with gmp unless we make great effort. It is complicated because most of the package of the tree will depend on gmp and few will use mpir directly, at some point I tried to port a lot of ebuild to mpir directly but it was a bit unsustainable. The easiest way is to use the gmp compatibility layer from mpir. Then we have to convince the toolchain people that we should have the possibility of switching between gmp and mpir to build gcc.

if all package in sage could be configured with either real gmp or real mpir out of the box we may be able to do some easy switching between the two but it is not the case.
lmona.de could go its own way and use mpir exclusively if they wanted too (by calling it gmp mainly).
