<a id='comment:1'></a>Google told me that some people suggested to "include cstdio to obtain std::FILE". So, I tried to add

```
#include <cstdio.h>
```
to gmp.h. However, after I attempted to build it, that line was gone!!

Can someone explain how I can avoid that my editing the file is reverted? Perhaps I need to do my change in the "patches" directory?

<a id='comment:2'></a>Yeah, I made some progress!!

I found that I needed to edit `src/gmp-h.in`, and I needed to `#include <cstdio>`, but only `#if defined (__cplusplus)`.

Then, building the package went beyond the point where it failed previously. However, it turns out that the gmp package requires yacc. I am insalling it now.

TODO (for the moment):

- Turn my changes to `src/gmp-h.in` into a patch, to be put into the `patches` directory.
- spkg-install should check for the presence of yacc.

No, it doesn't. I get an infinite loop during configuration, it seems. `/bin/sh ./config.status --recheck` is repeated over and over again.

Anyway. Since the current spkg is broken (at least on openSuse), I still think we should upgrade. But people need to test on different platforms.

We'll probably only run into trouble with using GMP instead of MPIR the day we upgrade FLINT, as newer (2.x, but IIRC only the most recent) versions of FLINT use some *MPIR* internals GMP doesn't provide, or at least isn't compatible with.

But for the moment it should be ok to use GMP instead, although (for CLooG) this shouldn't be necessary.

(In contrast, as Dima recently mentioned on sage-devel and mpir-devel, GAP uses some GMP internals MPIR currently doesn't provide.  The [older?] version of GAP we use apparently works with MPIR... :-) )

When I first tried to build the optional gcc from #12369 with graphite (hence, together with the optional cloog-ppl package from #12666), I thought that cloog-ppl needs GMP (not MPIR). This is why I opened this ticket in the first place.

No problem, I found the solution more than easily on the web.

Any other suggestion from sage-on-gentoo?
E.g., do you have devised any simple way to switch from gmp to mpir and back again easily?
Or are you really stuck with gmp and cannot use mpir? (that would be strange.)

It is complicated because most of the package of the tree will depend on gmp and few will use mpir directly, at some point I tried to port a lot of ebuild to mpir directly but it was a bit unsustainable. The easiest way is to use the gmp compatibility layer from mpir. Then we have to convince the toolchain people that we should have the possibility of switching between gmp and mpir to build gcc. Then we need to replace all dependencies to gmp in the tree by some virtual package which can be either gmp or mpir passing as gmp. That's a ton of work, require convincing people and so on.\n\nif all package in sage could be configured with either real gmp or real mpir out of the box we may be able to do some easy switching between the two but it is not the case.\nlmona.de could go its own way and use mpir exclusively if they wanted too (by calling it gmp mainly).",

<a id='comment:34'></a>We are really stuck with gmp unless we make great effort. It is complicated because most of the package of the tree will depend on gmp and few will use mpir directly, at some point I tried to port a lot of ebuild to mpir directly but it was a bit unsustainable. The easiest way is to use the gmp compatibility layer from mpir. Then we have to convince the toolchain people that we should have the possibility of switching between gmp and mpir to build gcc. Then we need to replace all dependencies to gmp in the tree by some virtual package which can be either gmp or mpir passing as gmp. That's a ton of work, require convincing people and so on.

if all package in sage could be configured with either real gmp or real mpir out of the box we may be able to do some easy switching between the two but it is not the case.
lmona.de could go its own way and use mpir exclusively if they wanted too (by calling it gmp mainly).
