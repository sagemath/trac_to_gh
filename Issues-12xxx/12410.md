The two sums

```
sage: var('x');
sage: sum(1/x*(-1)^x, x, 1, oo)
-log(2)
sage: sum(1/x*(-1)^x, x, 0, oo)
-log(2)                              
```
return the same, but shouldn't. The latter sum is divergent because of the summand `1/0`.

It works correctly, when not using the `(-1)^x`, e.g.:

```
sage: sum(1/x^2, x, 1, oo)
1/6*pi^2
sage: sum(1/x^2, x, 0, oo) 
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: Sum is divergent.
```
(Calculating `sum(1/x<sup>2*(-1)</sup>x, x, 0, oo)` gives the wrong result, too.)

Keywords: **alternating sum divergent result**
