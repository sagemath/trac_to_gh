How is a Ginac function called to do numerical evaluation? I thought this would work as a custom `_eval_` method for `beta`:

```python
    def _eval_(self, y, z):
        if not isinstance(y, Expression) and not isinstance(z, Expression) and \
                (is_inexact(y) or is_inexact(z)):
            coercion_model = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
            y, z = coercion_model.canonical_coercion(y, z)
            return GinacFunction.__call__(self, y, z)
        return None
```

But `GinacFunction.__call__` ends up calling the custom `_eval_` and I get an infinite recursion. I'm having trouble using the debugger to determine how, for example, `beta(4.0, 5.0)` is calculated. Is this because Pynac is mostly in Cython?

Pynac 0.2.4 from #12950 contains a fix for this. There is a patch with a doctest attached to that ticket. We should close this when that is merged.

Pynac is mostly C++. You should use GDB to trace the code.

The short answer to your question is: I haven't thought of this use case, so there isn't an easy way to call the evaluation method defined in Pynac from your `_eval_()`. The custom methods can only overwrite the ones defined in C++, they don't follow any inheritance principles from OOP.

This could be done by calling `beta_eval()` defined in `ginac/inifcns_gamma.cpp` directly from Cython, but that would be really messy. :)
