<a id='comment:4'></a>Helloooooooooo David !!!

Here is a small patch to apply on top of yours.. Here is what it does :

* One or two typoes
* Simplifies the definition of the LP variables... Could you give it a look, just to check I got nothing wrong ? `:-)`
* Replaces some lists operation by set operations. Well, it looked like all you wanted to do was more a set thing than a list thing.
* Replaces some integer = True by binary = True. The solvers (well, except Coin as usual) have specific types for binary variables, so if we know that they are binary we may as well say it.
* I also moved several lines of code outside of the try/catch, as list operations usually do not throw MIPSolverExceptions

I also have several questions :
* Could you say in the doc which variables are relaxed when integrality=False, and if it has any specific meaning ? Or is it just a lower bound that you use because it is faster ?
* Is the integrality variable really intended to be False **by default** ? `O_o;;;`
* About constraints 5, 6, and 7 : why aren't they all set by "sum of all y[v][t] for all v is equal to t" ? Or rather to t+1 ? I do not get why you do not say so immediately to the solver `O_o`
* To me ``u[v][t] >= x[v][t]-y[v][t]`` is rather ``x[v][t] == u[v][t] + y[v][t]``, which is the same constraint but in a way I find easier to read.. That's one of the remarks I added to the definition of the variables, though `:-)`

Well, I think that's all I had to say !

Both are optimal. However, in some cases the integral version is faster than the relaxed one. I don't know why.

>     * Is the integrality variable really intended to be False **by default** ? `O_o;;;`


Yes, because it is in general faster.

You are right. Changed.

>     * To me ``u[v][t] >= x[v][t]-y[v][t]`` is rather ``x[v][t] == u[v][t] + y[v][t]``, which is the same constraint but in a way I find easier to read.. That's one of the remarks I added to the definition of the variables, though `:-)`


This is certainly easier to read for you, but this is not the standard way to write linear programs. In general, it is better to provide inequalities rather than equalities to solvers for a better description of the polytopes. So I prefer to let this inequality as it is.

I have merge the patchs (MILP, review + additional modifications) into a combined patch. I have changed the top table in accordance with those of patch #12816. 

Hope it is better now.
