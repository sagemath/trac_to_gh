Enhance WordMorphism with the analysis of growing/non-growing letters (the letter a is growing of |sigma**n(a)| tends to infinity)

Motivation comes from substitutive languages, see #12227.

Hi Stepan,

I'm afraid that the accented characters in your HG username seem to cause problems: they're getting garbaged somewhere (judging by the output of the patchbot). The patchbot also doesn't like code lines with trailing whitespace on them. So I've done a new version of your patch, which is functionally identical to the old one; hope that's OK.

Hello,

Very useful patch!

Ameliorations

---

1) The function is letter_growing can be made in a nicer way by replacing

```
rcs = self.rational_contractive_space()

alphabet = self.domain().alphabet()
parikh_vector = [0 for i in xrange(len(alphabet))]
parikh_vector[alphabet.list().index(letter)] = 1

return not vector(parikh_vector) in rcs
```
by

```
rcs = self.rational_contractive_space()
V = rcs.ambient_vector_space()

i = self.domain().alphabet().unrank(letter)

return not V.basis()[i] in rcs
```

2) In rational_contractive_space you can access coefficient of degree 0 of a polynom P with P[0].

Some points of terminology and usability

---

1) Why do you prefer 'letter_growing' instead of 'growing_letter' ? (which is the name it has in CANT)

2) It should be useful to have as well a 'bounded_letter' method. If not we have to use 'not s.is_growing_letter(letter)'. It's up to you, I'm not sure about what is better.

3) What you called the "contractive subspace" is actually called "central stable space" in dynamics. The stable space (or contractive space) is reserved for the subspace where eigenvalues are strictly less than 1 in absolute value. But then, the name 'rational_central_stable_space' won't be very fancy but on the other hand it is not intended to be used by the front-end user.

Algorithmic
* if the substitution is primitive all letters are growing (and the test cost much less). I think that a first step in both is_growing and growing_letters would be the test of primitivity.

Docstring
* in growing_letters(): you may change "Returns a list" by "Returns the list"

After that, the patch seems ready to positive review.
