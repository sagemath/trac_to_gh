I just tried one of my *favorite* command line options in Sage-4.8:

```
$ sage -grep optional |grep gap # and all kinds of other awesome command line stuff 
```
and was very surprised and disappointed that (a) `sage -grep` is just gone, and (b) there is no other equivalent command line functionality. 

Searching reveals that #12190 removed `sage -grep` from sage.  You can't just remove functionality without any comment.  At a minimum it would have to be deprecated for a year, and should also be discussed on sage-devel.  

I'm able to accomplish what I want via

```
./sage -c "search_src('optional', 'gap')"
```
However, this requires starting up Sage, which is much slower than the old `sage -grep`.   I admit that "-grep" wasn't the best command line option name -- search_src would have been better. 

The optimal fix for this ticket would be to refactor the code in sage/misc/sagedoc.py (if possible) so it can be imported without importing all Sage, then use it to implement a command line "-search_src", and add back "-grep" with a 1-year deprecation. 

Failing that, just revert #12190 for 1 year.

The patch restore `sage -grep`, and `sage -grepdoc`, but uses a new simpler, one-line grep.  This has the following advantages:

* It is significantly faster;
* The files are searched in lexicographical order, rather than putting all the ".py" files before the ".pyx" files, etc.

In addition a new header is provided, which doesn't include the irrelevant "Type notebook() ...", and which shows the branch (if it isn't main).

> Unfortunately, `grep --recursive ...` does not work on Solaris or OpenSolaris.

The code in the new [attachment: trac_12333_restore_grep_scripts.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12333/trac_12333_restore_grep_scripts.patch.gz) should work much more generally.  It seems to be no slower than the previous approach.

> As far as the banner occurs, maybe it shouldn't be there at all? Set `SAGE_BANNER=no`, as in `sage -c ...`, to omit it. Finally, this should be rebased to some beta release of Sage 5.0: the script sage-sage is no longer there; instead, patch `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage`.

The attachment [attachment: trac_12333_restore_grep_root.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12333/trac_12333_restore_grep_root.patch.gz) patches `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/bin/sage`, removes the banner, and allows `-search_src` as a synonym for `-grep`, and `-search_doc` for `-grepdoc`.

One other modification to earlier behaviour: the `grep` option `-i` is no longer hard-wired, but it can be restored, as can other options.  For example:

```
$ sage -search_src -il clarke
sage/rings/morphism.pyx
sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py
sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx
sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py
sage/rings/number_field/unit_group.py
sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element_generic.py
