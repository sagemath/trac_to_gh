Good idea.  A few minor things. 
* Trivial typo of definition
  * Needs to escape the underscore in the `elliptic_pi` since otherwise there are horrible `LaTeX` warnings.
  * I'm not sure how we should deal with the `\phi` as a variable, since of course variables don't start with slashes, but in the formula it would need one.  Maybe just `phi`?   I'm not sure what's ideal.
