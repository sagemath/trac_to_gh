This is part 1 (of n, n >= 1) of an attempt to make simplification safer.

Right now, `simplify()` doesn't attempt anything drastic: it sends the expression to Maxima and back. So if you want a non-trivial simplification, you have to use something else.

That something else is `full_simplify()`, unless you want to write your own simplification function. But `full_simplify()` has a problem: the evil radcan.

1. #3520 - inconsistency in simplify_radical
2. #12322 - invalid simplification of complex logarithm
3. [AskSage 767](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/767/simplification-errors-in-simple-expressions) - simplification errors in simple expressions

And a simple example that logix was nice enough to dig out of my code on IRC:

```
sage: f = sqrt((x+1)^2)
sage: f.full_simplify()
x + 1
sage: f(x = -5)
4
sage: f.full_simplify()(x = -5)
-4
```

The goal is to make simplification safer, through some combination of,

* Making `simplify()` more useful.
* Making it obvious that `full_simplify()` can do some, uh, *unintuitive* things.

Unless there are objections, I see no reason not to make `simplify()` perform all "safe" simplifications; that is, simplifications for which `simplify(expr) == expr` with some certainty.

I'm happy with the overall plan, but the upgrade to Maxima 5.26 (#10682, merged in 5.0.beta8) produces a conflict.  With your patch, we have the following doctests from sage.calculus.wester.

```
sage: # (YES) Assuming Re(x)>0, Re(y)>0, deduce x^(1/n)*y^(1/n)-(x*y)^(1/n)=0.
sage: # Maxima 5.26 has different behaviours depending on the current
sage: # domain.
sage: # To stick with the behaviour of previous versions, the domain is set
sage: # to 'real' in the following.
sage: # See Trac #10682 for further details.
sage: n = var('n')
sage: f = x^(1/n)*y^(1/n)-(x*y)^(1/n)
sage: assume(real(x) > 0, real(y) > 0)
sage: f.simplify()
0
sage: maxima = sage.calculus.calculus.maxima
sage: maxima.set('domain', 'real') # set domain to real
sage: f.simplify()
0
sage: maxima.set('domain', 'complex') # set domain back to its default value
sage: forget()
```

Before your patch, the first f.simplify() didn't do much:

```
sage: f = x^(1/n)*y^(1/n)-(x*y)^(1/n)
sage: assume(real(x) > 0, real(y) > 0)
sage: f.simplify()
x^(1/n)*y^(1/n) - (x*y)^(1/n)
```

This turned out to be an easy fix: `simplify_log` was setting the simplification domain to 'real' before doing its thing. Leaving it 'complex' doesn't hurt anything else, but fixes the Wester test.

It is likely that users will want to set the simplification domain to 'real' in some cases, but doing it sneakily like that is a bad way to go about it. Once I'm done with this and `full_simplify`, I'll probably go back and add a `domain` parameter to all of the simplification functions to allow the user a choice.

I don't think this is the right fix.
* Breaks behavior for no reason
* Breaks with our recent trajectory of *adding* access to Maxima stuff and granularity
* Makes users have to do much more than needed for the super-basic simplifications that Maxima did
Now, maybe we should do more in `simplify`.  But it seems sort of redundant to *remove* `radcan` from `simplify_full` and then *add* everything else here anyway.

I think that it might make sense to look over the Maxima documentation and *code* very carefully and determine if something like the factorial simplification truly is the same in all cases, like it would be with `expand`.  Otherwise it seems unwise to make this change.

I'm especially mystified as to what the difference between `simplify` and `simplify_full` should be under this regime.

I agree it's not perfect, but,\n\n* Most of the simplifications we do are pretty basic anyway. I think it makes sense to have `simplify()` actually attempt *something*. If we ever discover that the simplifications in `simplify()` are misbehaving, they can just be removed.\n* `full_simplify()` used to make two calls to `simplify_rational()` In #12737 I've got it making two calls to `simplify()` so it isn't *completely* redundant even with unsafe=False.\n* New simplifications can be added to `full_simplify()`, for example #11785. And maybe we could allow to take a complexity function as an argument ala Mathematica.\n\nI am open to other ideas, though. I personally would be satisfied with `full_simplify()` if it were safe to call and I didn't have to define my own `safe_simplify()`.",

I brought this up in my initial message to sage-devel, but didn't get any comments. I agree it's not perfect, but,

* Most of the simplifications we do are pretty basic anyway. I think it makes sense to have `simplify()` actually attempt *something*. If we ever discover that the simplifications in `simplify()` are misbehaving, they can just be removed.
* `full_simplify()` used to make two calls to `simplify_rational()` In #12737 I've got it making two calls to `simplify()` so it isn't *completely* redundant even with unsafe=False.
* New simplifications can be added to `full_simplify()`, for example #11785. And maybe we could allow to take a complexity function as an argument ala Mathematica.

I am open to other ideas, though. I personally would be satisfied with `full_simplify()` if it were safe to call and I didn't have to define my own `safe_simplify()`.
