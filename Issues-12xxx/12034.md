Martin, does that mean you give positive review to William's patch?  It looks fine at a glance...  Anyway, putting "needs info" for this.

Other than not obeying the recommendation from the developer guide about `.. note`

```
However, you are encouraged to use the upper-case version
```
which is not a problem at all, the reviewer patch looks fine, including the very minor code changes.  Just one or two very minor formatting things.

I've attached a reviewer-reviewer patch which fixes these and adds this to the reference manual.
