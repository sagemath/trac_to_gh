`is_method` / `_test_from_is_method`: method wrappers to factor out code between `is_bar` and `_test_bar` methods

From the documentation:

The typical usecase for those wrappers is as follow: Consider a
category `Foo` with a subcategory `Bar`.  `Foo` wants to
provide a method `Foo.ParentMethods.is_bar` such that, for `F`
in `Foo()`, `F.is_bar()` returns whether `F` satisfies all
the properties of `Bar()`. The method `is_bar` is allowed to
assume that `F` indeed satisfies all the properties specified by
`Foo()`. It may decide to upgrade the category of `F` to
`Bar()`.

`Bar` itself wants to provide a method
`Bar.ParentMethod._test_bar` which is supposed to do some
reasonable sanity checks on `F` to determine whether it
satisfies all the properties of `Bar`. If yes, `F._test_bla()`
should return None; otherwise it should raise some (hopefully
meaningful) assertion.  Note that `Bar()` will typically
override `is_bar` by a trivial method that always returns
`True`.

The purpose of two decorators `is_method` and
`_test_method_from_is` is to factor out the logic between the two
related methods `F.is_bla()` and `F._test_bla()`. They take as
input a Python function `is_bla(self, proof=False, **options)`.
This function should proceed as usual for a `_test method` (see
:class:`TestSuite`). If `proof` is `True`, then the answer
should be provably correct. At the end, `is_bla` should return
`None`, or a category that will be used to refine the category
of `F`.

+related methods `F.is_bla()` and `F._test_bla()`. They take as
+input a Python function `is_bla(self, proof=False, **options)`.
+This function should proceed as usual for a `_test method` (see
+:class:`TestSuite`). If `proof` is `True`, then the answer
+should be provably correct. At the end, `is_bla` should return
+`None`, or a category that will be used to refine the category
+of `F`.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">Comment 6</div>

Needs to rebase on 5-11.beta3 (reject on unittest.py).

The patch may definitely be useful. There are two things that I dislike.

1) When you add the decorator the code does not correspond anymore to a is_X method (it does not return a boolean but raise an error or return a refined category). In other words, it is unreadable. Moreover, when you want to access the documentation (reusing your example)

```
sage: F = FiniteUnion([GF(2), GF(3)])
sage: F.is_finite?
```
you get something that you do not want to see here.

2) the speed

```
sage: %timeit F.is_finite()
10000 loops, best of 3: 27.2 us per loop
```
just to compare

```
sage: class P:
....:     def is_finite(self):
....:         return True
sage: p = P()
sage: %timeit p.is_finite()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 218 ns per loop
```
which is how `is_finite` should be implemented for a finite set.
