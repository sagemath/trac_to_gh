On cicero:

```
sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "/home/buildbot/build/sage/cicero-1/cicero_binary/build/sage-4.8.rc0/devel/sage-main/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx", line 872:
    sage: m.baum_welch(v)
Expected:
    (-162.85437039799817, 49)
Got:
    (-162.8543703979982, 49)

```

I don't know what caused this, but the fix is so easy that I don't want to bother tracking it down.
