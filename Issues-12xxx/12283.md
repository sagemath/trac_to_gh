On cicero:

**********************************************************************
File "/home/buildbot/build/sage/cicero-1/cicero_binary/build/sage-4.8.rc0/devel/sage-main/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx", line 872:

Got:

I don't know what caused this, but the fix is so easy that I don't want to bother tracking it down.
