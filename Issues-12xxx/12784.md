Is there anything to review here?  I read the sage-devel thing, and I don't see why this wouldn't take care of the issue.  But I don't want to get in trouble with those worried about (re)build times...

Although I should point out

I think due to the formatting of the patch file for some reason.

```

should the `SAGERUNTIME` be in the same line as the `@@`?

Oh, I see, my patch also depends on #12369 (which removes fortran as a dependency of cvxopt, since it removes the fortran package altogether).  Here's a new patch.
