The current loading page of the Mac App is hideous and not as informative as it could be.  Also the link to `localhost:8000` will soon become `localhost:8080` with the new flask notebook (see #11080).  Both of these should be fixed without remorse.

Yes it should ignore the whitespace.  As to sizes of h1, etc. I just modified some css from sagemath.org so that I would get the colors right and they had changed the sizes.

That's not addressed here, nor elsewhere.  When I finally got 5.0.beta1 to build and tested it, it wasn't a problem.  I'm going to comment on it over there as well now that you reminded me.

Ok, then.  It looks great!  The tips are amusing, though hopefully people won't have to go through all of them, and they don't seem to appear *completely* randomly.

As to building, my understanding is that `SAGE_APP_DMG=no` still builds Sage as a tgz, just not a dmg.  Anyway.
