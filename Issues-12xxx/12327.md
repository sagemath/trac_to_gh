The current loading page of the Mac App is hideous and not as informative as it could be.  Also the link to `localhost:8000` will soon become `localhost:8080` with the new flask notebook (see #11080).  Both of these should be fixed without remorse.

Yes it should ignore the whitespace.  As to sizes of h1, etc. I just modified some css from sagemath.org so that I would get the colors right and they had changed the sizes.

That's not addressed here, nor elsewhere.  When I finally got 5.0.beta1 to build and tested it, it wasn't a problem.  I'm going to comment on it over there as well now that you reminded me.

Now that I think about it people might run older versions of Sage and then it would be port 8000 anyway.  It would be easy to put 2 links.  I'm not sure it's worth it though since they should never have to click the link, and the server be running on a different port anyway since 8000 or 8080 might have been taken by something else (e.g. `hg serve`).

Ok, then.  It looks great!  The tips are amusing, though hopefully people won't have to go through all of them, and they don't seem to appear *completely* randomly.

As to building, my understanding is that `SAGE_APP_DMG=no` still builds Sage as a tgz, just not a dmg.  Anyway.
