Apparently 3 years ago, when I made an update patch for matplotlib, I put in some default shortening of arrows.  Matplotlib already shortens its arrows to account for line width, so with my shortening and matplotlib's shortening, arrows were always way shorter than they were intended.  This patch removes Sage's default shortening of arrows.
