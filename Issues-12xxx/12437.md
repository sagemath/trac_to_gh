Lcalc still uses some non-standard "features" of `g++`.

C++ compilers that are pickier than `g++` will not allow this.

GCC 5.x again got stricter and now also needs the second "default parameter" patch (or once again `-fpermissive`) mentioned below.

Current branch fix usage of internal headers and some declarations. More to be done as I haven't even scratched the issues mentioned in this ticket - unless they have been fixed by another merged ticket.

We now need a new spkg (based on that of #12681) incorporating this patch.

We also should report this upstream.

Patch so far looks good (not sure whether I've seen all of it -- maybe trac truncated it); seems like most functions (also) had the default values in their *declarations*.

Hmmm, haven't tested Andrew's patch [yet], but tried by myself.

For GCC 4.9, apparently the following tiny patch is sufficient to build Lcalc and the Sage library extension module (which currently lacks a `depends` btw.<sup>*</sup>):

Yes.  My primary goal was to make Lcalc work with GCC; I'll take a closer look at other changes later.

Adding `void` to the `friend` declaration of `reset()` is certainly correct (although slightly unrelated to what the *name of the patch* suggests, on the broader topic of *this* ticket, namely making Lcalc's code build with `clang`).

In the other hunks, you just removed default parameters from *definitions*, but did not move them to corresponding *declarations* (probably because there aren't any, which is something I'll have to check).  But from at least one comment, it looks like those parts were "dead" code anyway.

Ok, so I've now created 7 new patches to fix all remaining clang/non-GNU/C++11 issues with Lcalc (except for some deprecation warnings):

```
Makefile_2-dont_compile_C_with_CXXFLAGS.patch
lcalc-1.23-fix_VLA_1.patch
lcalc-1.23-fix_VLA_2.patch
lcalc-1.23-fix_control_reaches_end_of_non-void_fn.patch
lcalc-1.23-fix_typeof.patch
lcalc-1.23-missing_return_type.patch
lcalc-1.23_default_parameters_2.patch
```

But I'd prefer to put them on a single ticket, i.e., to either open a new one, or repurpose one of the two existing ones.  (But before doing so, I'll anyway polish them a bit, and probably merge some of them into another or into one of the existing ones.)

I did take a slightly different approach to variable-length arrays; instead of using `std::vector<>`, I'm using `foo_t *_foo = new foo_t[dim1*dim2*dim3]`, along with a macro `foo(i,j,k)` which maps the indices to a single one, and of course added `delete [] _foo` where necessary.

So far tested with GCC 4.4, 4.8 and 4.9, clang 3.4.1, and a couple of `-std=...` variations.

Well, upstream... ;-)

The patches are pretty small, and I'll merge them into fewer I think, hopefully next weekend.

Pretty a while ago, *someone<sup>TM</sup>* wanted to create an autotools project for Michael, but that apparently never happened, so we keep heavily patching the existing Makefile.

AFAIK, some previous patches (e.g. dealing with newer PARI versions) went upstream, i.e., Michael should at least be aware of them; I'll certainly send him the new / updated ones later.  Not sure whether he's interested in changes removing GNU extensions.  (Variable-length arrays can still be used depending on macros / the compiler though.)

Sure, trivial for `g++` at least.

We of course could also add `-fpermissive` in Lcalc's `spkg-install`, but I rather meant

```sh
env CXXFLAGS="-fpermissive" ./sage -f lcalc
env CFLAGS="-fpermissive" ./sage -b
```
to temporarily work around the errors when building Sage (with GCC 5.x).

I had two other issues (with gf2x and ncurses) which hopefully vanish tomorrow [i.e., later today down under] when the final 5.1 (or 5.0.1?) gets released.

I was surprised building the first RC went smooth (on a pretty "clean" machine though); this time no cloog/PPL/ISL version hazards or the like... (`make clean` still bails out though IIRC.)

I can understand why `std::vector` would be a natural choice because you don't have to worry about memory management (specifically the deallocation). It just there is some slight overhead from using it rather than direct system calls with the array, but that is more likely a micro-optimization. Perhaps some of the others aren't raising warnings because their length can be determined at compile time?

One little change to a patch:

```diff
         std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<Complex> > > exp_sum_log_Gamma(N+1); // symmetric functions
         std::vector<std::vector<Complex> > gamma(N+1); // gamma(s+m[j]) for j = 1 to N
         for (j=1;j<=N;j++){
             exp_sum_log_Gamma[j].resize(MYDIGITS+1);
+            for (n=0;n<=MYDIGITS;n++) exp_sum_log_Gamma[j][n].resize(MYDIGITS+1);
             gamma[j].resize(MYDIGITS+1);
         }
-        for (j=1;j<=N;j++) for (n=0;n<=MYDIGITS;n++) exp_sum_log_Gamma[j][n].resize(MYDIGITS+1);
```
as I think it is (slightly) more readable considering we are already working with the 3d array.
