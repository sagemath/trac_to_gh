Not too important because underscore methods aren't included in the reference manual by default, but line 3863

```
We can make commands not display their plots by default. 
```
should probably end with a double colon: `by default. ::`.  Same with line 3888.

Line 3899 (the last line reproduced here) is wrong:

```
     def nrows(self): 
         """ 
         String representation of the graphics array.
```

While fixing these, I also added a blank line after line 3114:

```
    ``exclude`` and ``detect_poles`` can be used together::
        sage: f(x) = (floor(x)+0.5) / (1-(x-0.5)^2)
```
