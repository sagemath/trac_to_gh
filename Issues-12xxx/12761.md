This breaks the build of its test suite as well as of the Sage library **with** (e.g.) **GCC 4.7.x**.

I already have an spkg fixing this, i.e., the offending headers.

See #12751 for the GCC-4.7.0 metaticket.

Closely related: #12444 (which I unfortunately wasn't aware of until now) for the `clang` port

**New spkg:** [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/givaro-3.2.13.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/givaro-3.2.13.p0.spkg)

### givaro-3.2.13.p0 (Jeroen Demeyer, 25 May 2012)
* #12761: Restore upstream sources to vanilla 3.2.13 (the previous
  src/ directory was some never-released CVS version between
  givaro-3.2.13.rc1 and givaro-3.2.13, but bootstrapped with a
  different automake).
* Remove gmp++.h.patch which is upstreamed (the old diff was wrong).
* Use `patch` to apply all patches.
* Fix patch for givtablelimits.h such that it can be applied on all
  systems, not only Cygwin.
* Merged all GCC-4.7.0 patches into one: cplusplus_scoping.patch
* Don't touch .pyx files, instead fix module_list.py (also on #12761).

### givaro-3.2.13.rc1.p4 (Leif Leonhardy, March 27th 2012)
* #12761: Fix headers not conforming to C++11 to make Sage (especially the
  Sage library) build with GCC 4.7.0 (and without `-fpermissive`).
  Same for Givaro's test suite, which uses / instantiates much more!
  (These headers get installed into `$SAGE_LOCAL/include/givaro/`.)
  New patches:
  - patches/src.kernel.integer.givintnumtheo.inl.patch
  - patches/src.kernel.integer.givintrsa.inl.patch
  - patches/src.library.poly1.givpoly1factor.inl.patch
  - patches/src.library.poly1.givpoly1padic.h.patch
  - patches/src.library.poly1.givpoly1proot.inl.patch
* Remove the obsolete Debian `dist/` directory.
* Remove obsolete GCC 4.3 patch.
* Rename diffs of prepatched files that are (still) copied over to `*.diff`
  (rather than `*.patch`) such that they don't get "automatically" applied
  by the `patch -p1` loop, which I added.
* Fix permissions of `SPKG.txt` and `spkg-install`, and two upstream files.
* Add "Special Update/Build Instructions" section.
* Clean up `spkg-check` and `spkg-install`.
* Also set up environment variables in `spkg-check`, as `make check` involves
  compilation.  (Although `configure` should have put them into the generated
  Makefiles.)
* Use `$MAKE` in `spkg-check` as well.
* Exit in case the build failed!
* Only `touch` extension modules (`*.pyx`) if they (already) exist.

I haven't added this, nor have I checked that it works, i.e., builds, without that (although I'm pretty sure it would) -- that's why I wrote *"shouldn't be necessary"*, not *"isn't needed"*.

One side effect of adding it is that the test suite is built with the headers installed into Sage, which isn't all bad, but I can try to remove it later, although quite unrelated to the purpose of this ticket.

W.r.t. `touch`ing: It doesn't hurt.  Moreover, the installed headers might have timestamps earlier than those of the Python extension modules, such that Cython probably won't notice that they're "new".

I cc'ed the spkg maintainers, which include Clément Pernet, according to `SPKG.txt` also the upstream contact.

Note that (as already mentioned elsewhere) the version currently in Sage is a *release candidate*, dated 2008 IIRC.

Fine.

> except your new header patches; they seem simple enough (almost all of it is just casting things to other types, right?) but I don't know enough C++ to be confident about that.


Nope, I haven't added casts, but (roughly speaking) qualified the names of (mostly, I think) member functions used in *template* class member functions, i.e.,

```c++
template <class Foo>
void Bar<Foo>::bar() // member function bar() of class Bar, which is parameterized by a class Foo
{
    Bar<Foo>::baz(); // call with qualified [function] name; 
                     // baz() here is [also] a member function of [template] class Bar
}
```
instead of

```c++
...
{
    baz(); // call with unqualified [function] name
}
```
I could have used

```c++
...
{
    this->baz();
}
```
instead in most (if not all) cases as well; cf. Andrew Ohana's changes at #12444 (which I unfortunately found only after I made my own changes).
