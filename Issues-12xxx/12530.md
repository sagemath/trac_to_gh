The attached patch improves the sage-combinat script to support guards for developpers versions. It also makes sure to switch to the sage-combinat directory before doing any call to mercurial.

Note: starting from sage 5.0.beta4, the guards used in the sage-combinat queue assume that this updated sage-combinat script is used.

Good catch; I forgot to copy paste the latest version of the regexp in the code. Fixed in the new patch. Thanks!

The problem is in the queue: the following guard is invalid

I think we should throw an error in this case. What do you think ?

Oops, the guard should not have matched the regexp in the first place; I had forgotten the "$" at the end of it for an exact match. The updated patch still complains as you suggest, since this is likely to be a typicall typo.

I used the occasion to run pyflakes and clean up the imports.

It's actually the queue that is wrong :-) The release of 5.0 comes after that of 5.0.beta4, so it's normal to apply a patch marked 5.0 on sage 5.0.beta4. I'll go check the queue now.
