The attached patch improves the sage-combinat script to support guards for developpers versions. It also makes sure to switch to the sage-combinat directory before doing any call to mercurial.

Note: starting from sage 5.0.beta4, the guards used in the sage-combinat queue assume that this updated sage-combinat script is used.

To be applied in <SAGE_ROOT>/local/bin:

It's actually the queue that is wrong :-) The release of 5.0 comes after that of 5.0.beta4, so it's normal to apply a patch marked 5.0 on sage 5.0.beta4. I'll go check the queue now.

I pondered about this too. My rationale was the following: imagine a beginner installs the queue and runs into this issue; if the queue is really screwed up, their will be an error later one anyway. Otherwise, he could be lucky and have the queue apply reasonnably and be able to get to work; so why blocking him.

That being said, it is indeed buried in the middle of a bunch of info, though quite visible for someone scrolling up.

So I don't know. Maybe that would be a use case for throwing an error by default, and a warning under -f. What do you think?
