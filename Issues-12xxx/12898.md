The file `$SAGE_ROOT/README.txt` still says you need a fortran compiler, except on OSX, with no
mention of the gcc package, or how one might use or disable it.

> "includes" is a verb :-)

Main verb, yes.

Questions/comments:
* Some things I kind of get are true from previous tickets (3 GB, changing to `--optional` from `-optional` and so forth) but I don't actually *know* they are true; I guess I should just trust the author?  ;-)
* So Sage compiles with Sun compilers on Solaris now because we build and use GCC?  I don't remember reading that but haven't been paying close attention to the thread, seems plausible.
* I understand that the `v` flag for untarring is optional, but if you remove that flag, then you should probably tell the user how long they should expect to wait for Sage to untar.  It takes a **long** time (I've done this with a student on a couple occasions and we weren't sure if the connection had timed out!), and I would expect that some of the spkgs inside Sage likewise take at least more than a couple minutes to untar - ?

But in general this looks good and applies properly etc.  Positive review?  I can't take responsibility for every one of the little changes, like the comment about Ubuntu 12.04, obviously, so I hesitate... but seems like it's ready and certainly helpful.

Exactly.  It's even tested on the buildbot (on i386 OpenSolaris at least).

Fair enough, I added back that flag.

Either that or a clarification without `-v` is fine, I just wasn't sure if there was some other reason to get rid of that flag (e.g., the verbosity for some with a lot of image files is VERY verbose).   I assume the `-xj` and `-jx` switch is because the mandatory flag is supposed to come first?  I know little of such things but that seems plausible.

Is is true that *"Each spkg in $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/ is a bzip'd tarball"*, as stated? I doubt the bzip2 package is. I think that is an uncompressed tarball. I'm not sure if there are any others either.

The use of x (to extract), c (to create), t (to view), u (to update) or r (to replace) are not options. You **must** have one of them. Since they are not options, you don't need the minus sign. The **j** is an option, but GNU tar does not require the minus sign. So one might as well save a bit of wear on the keyboard, and not put the minus sign. 

I thought GNU tar was supposed to be a requirement to build Sage. In which case, one might as well drop the **j** too, since GNU tar will work out for itself that the file is compressed or not. If it's compressed, it will silently uncompress it.

`bzip2` is gzip-compressed, the other packages are all bzip2-compressed.
