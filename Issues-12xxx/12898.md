The file `$SAGE_ROOT/README.txt` still says you need a fortran compiler, except on OSX, with no
mention of the gcc package, or how one might use or disable it.

> "includes" is a verb :-)

Main verb, yes.

Questions/comments:
* Some things I kind of get are true from previous tickets (3 GB, changing to `--optional` from `-optional` and so forth) but I don't actually *know* they are true; I guess I should just trust the author?  ;-)
* So Sage compiles with Sun compilers on Solaris now because we build and use GCC?  I don't remember reading that but haven't been paying close attention to the thread, seems plausible.
* I understand that the `v` flag for untarring is optional, but if you remove that flag, then you should probably tell the user how long they should expect to wait for Sage to untar.  It takes a **long** time (I've done this with a student on a couple occasions and we weren't sure if the connection had timed out!), and I would expect that some of the spkgs inside Sage likewise take at least more than a couple minutes to untar - ?

But in general this looks good and applies properly etc.  Positive review?  I can't take responsibility for every one of the little changes, like the comment about Ubuntu 12.04, obviously, so I hesitate... but seems like it's ready and certainly helpful.

Fair enough, I added back that flag.

Either that or a clarification without `-v` is fine, I just wasn't sure if there was some other reason to get rid of that flag (e.g., the verbosity for some with a lot of image files is VERY verbose).

Is is true that *"Each spkg in $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/ is a bzip'd tarball"*, as stated? I doubt the bzip2 package is. I think that is an uncompressed tarball. I'm not sure if there are any others either. 

Also, I don't know why anyone puts **-xfj** or similar, when **xfj** will do. Tar is not defined by POSIX, so it's impossible to give an authoritative answer, but every tar program I have ever used, does not need the minus sign.

Replying to [drkirkby](#comment%3A10):
> Is is true that *"Each spkg in $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/ is a bzip'd tarball"*, as stated? I doubt the bzip2 package is. I think that is an uncompressed tarball. I'm not sure if there are any others either.

`bzip2` is gzip-compressed, the other packages are all bzip2-compressed.
