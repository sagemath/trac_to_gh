```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[x]
sage: (x-1).is_cyclotomic()
True
sage: (x^2+1).is_cyclotomic()
True
sage: (x^3-x+1).is_cyclotomic()
False
```

Hi Stepan,

I had a quick look at you patch. I have two comment:
- There is a proper syntax for reference and algorithm please see: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#docstring-markup-with-rest-and-sphinx. I don't have the time to fix it myself.
- More important, I think your code should go in a file which is not dependent on a particular implementation of polynomial. I think sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx is a good place. You'll find there methods such as (`squarefree_decomposition, is_square`).

Thanks for this nice work !

Hi Florent,

thank you for the feedback! I made some improvements.


> - There is a proper syntax for reference and algorithm

I tried to make some changes according to the documentation.

> - More important, I think your code should go in a file which is not dependent on a particular implementation of polynomial.

I moved the code to sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx for the moment.

This will do some strange things if the base ring is a finite field. For instance it will say that the mod p reduction of the nth cyclotomic polynomial is cyclotomic for some values of p, and non-cyclotomic for others (because it will depend whether the reduction mod p is irreducible or not). 

Moreover, if the base ring is a characteristic 0 ring bigger than ZZ, you will get some strange behaviour in case 3 because you call "f1.factor()" and the factorization over ` self.base_ring() ` won't generally be the same as over ZZ; indeed you might even get errors at this point if the base ring is one where Sage doesn't know how to factor polynomials.

I suggest you change the type-check

```python
try:
    self.change_ring(ZZ)
except TypeError:
    return False
```
to something a bit more cautious like

```python
if self.base_ring().characteristic() != 0:
    return False
if self.base_ring() != ZZ:
    try:
        f = self.change_ring(ZZ)
        return f.is_cyclotomic()
    except TypeError,ValueError:
        return False
```
(or raise a ValueError, if you prefer). Then you can continue with your algorithm in the confidence that the base ring is ZZ.

A few changes made in the review patch:

* the reference is no longer given by a number like [1], but by [BD89]

* added a link to the cited article as follows 
<code>:doi:\`10.1007/3-540-51084-2_22\`</code>

* when the characteristic is not zero, raise an error

```
raise NotImplementedError("not implemented in non-zero characteristic")
```

* the odd and even construction are now done in two lines

```
po_odd = sum(coefs[i]*(gen**((i-1)/2)) for i in xrange(1,len(coefs),2))
po_even = sum(coefs[i]*(gen**(i/2)) for i in xrange(0,len(coefs),2))

Hey Frederic,

Bot has essentially given a green light and the review patch looks good to me except for one minor thing on line 5969, I would prefer it to be:

```
Return ``True`` if ``self`` is a cyclotomic polynomial.
```
Sorry to nitpick.
