<a id='comment:15'></a>The code looks good, it also takes care of come hardcoded variable names. Jeroen, do you think that taking as a new name

K.variable_name()*2

is better than, taking, for instance K.variable_name()+'0' ?

In the first case, the length of the name is doubled. I think that those methods cannot be called so many times so this growth can de an issue, but a warning always pop in my head with this kind of code.

What do you think?
