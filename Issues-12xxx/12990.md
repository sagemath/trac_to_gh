```
between 4.7.x and 5.x series, the following error was introduced:

```
K = NumberField([x^2-2, x^2-3], 'a,b')
M = K.absolute_field('c')
M_to_K, K_to_M = M.structure()
M.register_coercion(K_to_M)
K.register_coercion(M_to_K)
M.coerce_map_from(QQ)
...
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'connecting' referenced before assignment
```

This error was fixed in #12919. We propose to add a new test to that fix.

Yes, whis is a clear duplicate of #12919, however, I would like to keep also the doctest of this patch, 12919 doctest is a an ad-hoc class for testing the bug. In this patch is a "real-life" situation where the bug is triggered.

Should I clear the patch to keep only the doctest and possibli be merged?
