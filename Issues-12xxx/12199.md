Mestre's algorithm for constructing hyperelliptic curves has been implemented see ticket #6341 but it only works for generic curve.

```
    .. TODO::
    
        Mestre's algorithm only works for generic curves of genus two, so an other algorithm is needed for those curves with extra automorphism
        
        sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
        sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(x^6+1)
        sage: HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants(C.igusa_clebsch_invariants()) # todo: not implemented
    
```

The missing case can be taken from the article of [Cardona and Quer](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0207015)

Depends on #6341
