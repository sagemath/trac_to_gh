Fredrik Stromberg pointed out the following bug in Sage's level 1 modular symbols functionality:

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(1,12,sign=1).cuspidal_subspace().new_subspace()
sage: A = M.decomposition()[0]
sage: A.compact_system_of_eigenvalues(prime_range(20))

I've attached a patch that fixes the bug by correctly dealing with the special case of level 1.     

I also made some changes to get rid of the obsolete `for i from a <= i < b` notation for for loops in Cython and to make some of the docstrings look better.
