This is necessary so we can dump the ZODB spkg from Sage.

---
**Installation Instructions**
* Install the [new spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/conway_polynomials-0.4.spkg).
* Apply [trac12205.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12205/trac12205.patch.gz) to the sage library
* Apply [attachment: 12205_root.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12205/12205_root.patch.gz) to the sage root repository

I did some work on this on the airplane, and better post a link before I forget about it or loose it:  http://wstein.org/patches/conway_polynomials-0.3.spkg

Basically, the database is tiny so it can easily and very efficiently just be stored as a standard sobj.   Using ZODB is silly.

William, do you have a work-in-progress patch for the sage library? I would like to finish this task.

Edit: Other than a description in the SPKG.txt, [this spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/spkgs/conway_polynomials-0.4.spkg) should final.

In the end I am hitting a brick wall here. Possibly due to my lack of python skills and my will to only have minimal changes in conway.py. The issue is that the created sobj is a double dictionary and that the call to the ConwayPolynomials() class follow the same pattern as a double dictionary. You have calls of the kind:
ConwayPolynomials()[3][21]

Implementing the class as a dictionary allows sage to start 

```
import os

from sage.structure.sage_object import load
from sage.misc.misc import SAGE_DATA

_CONWAYDATA = os.path.join(SAGE_DATA,'conway_polynomials')

class ConwayPolynomials(dict):
    def __init__(self,*arg,**kw):
        """
        Initialize the database.
        """
        super(ConwayPolynomials, self).__init__(*arg, **kw)

    def _init(self):
        if not os.path.exists(_CONWAYDATA):
            raise RuntimeError, "In order to initialize the database, the directory must exist."%_CONWAYDATA
        os.chdir(_CONWAYDATA)
        self = load(os.path.join(_CONWAYDATA, 'conway_polynomials'))
```
but unfortunately but I get key errors:

```
sage: sage.databases.conway.ConwayPolynomials()[3][21]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)

KeyError: 3
sage: sage.databases.conway.ConwayPolynomials().keys()

```
 I was hoping that inheriting the dict class the access problem would be solved but I am obviously doing something wrong here. Loading the sobj directly from sage is totally usable, it is just when trying to put it in a class.

Interesting point but here it will call update() from the dict class which I don't think is what you meant. I still get the same results after doing your suggested replacement.

As much as I understand, the "format" (in the sense of the "interface to retrieve data") does not change. That's exactly the point: If you wanted to inherit from dict, then you'd also have to have a `__setitem__` method - but we don't want to set data in an interactive session. All what we want is that during initialisation, data are obtained from a file, and then the user can retrieve these data (which is granted by the `__getitem__` method).

> ... since the code in sage is littered with calls to ConwayPolynomials()[p][n]

Would that be changed by the patch? Looking at the lines

```
    def __getitem__(self, key): 
        try: 
            return self._store[key] 
        except KeyError, err: 
            try: 
                if isinstance(key, (tuple, list)): 
                    if len(key) == 2: 
                        return self._store[key[0]][key[1]] 
            except KeyError: 
                pass 
            raise err 
```
it seems to me that `ConwayPolynomials()[p][n]` is still a possible syntax (that's `return self._store[key]`), but *in addition to the old syntax* we now also allow the syntax `ConwayPolynomials()[p, n]` (that's `return self._store[key[0]][key[1]]`).

> and changing the storage would imply changing an enormous amount of code.

By "storage", I understand the format of the data stored in the .sobj file containing the data base. I don't think that would be a problem, as long as there is a function that is able to read old data and transforms it into the new format.

> I trust that your python foo is way ahead of mine. I would never have produced that getitem and didn't find any examples to do that with google.

That's in [dive into python](http://www.diveintopython.net/object_oriented_framework/special_class_methods.html) or other Python introductions, or in the [Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names).

I updated the database to use tuples (updated the spkg), rather than lists, as they are not mutable. I don't believe there are other breakages, but I haven't run the full doctest suit (just a few files I found through greping).

Yes, that sounds like a plan.

This is very bizzare I had no doctests failures with the previous version of the patch (on top of 5.5) but with this new one I get 

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/algebras/free_algebra.py"
The doctested process was killed by signal 11
         [1.4 s]
```
But if I add "-verbose" the test pass. There are no obvious relation with this ticket (and #10353 on which I am working at the same time) apart from the fact that it appeared out of the blue after application.

That is very likely caused by an upstream bug in Cython that became immanent with #715.

Can you try with the new Cython spkg from #13896? I.e., install that spkg and do sage -ba.

Basically, `$(INST)/$(SAGE)` is purely the Sage library (i.e. the stuff in `devel/sage`).  But actually starting Sage or running Sage code requires more, because things are imported from other packages, for example the notebook.  That stuff is in `$(SAGERUNTIME)`.

It used to be the case that `$(INST)/$(SAGE)` was what is essentially `$(SAGERUNTIME)` now.  But that's silly because it adds extra unneeded build-time dependencies for `$(INST)/$(SAGE)`, which needs a long time to build.

No, it's not.  On first sight, it doesn't seem to use anything besides basic polynomial arithmetic.  But if basic polynomial arithmetic were broken, we would see a lot more doctests failing.

I'm not at all saying that this ticket has anything to do with it, I merge a bunch of tickets and when there's a failure I have to guess which ticket caused it.

Don't worry, it wasn't directed at anyone in particular!  Presumably it's something left over from debugging.  Shall I assume this is to be considered non-optimal and a ticket should be opened?

So... should I open a ticket?  It does seem bizarre, and apparently easily fixed?  But if it was necessary, I don't want to.
