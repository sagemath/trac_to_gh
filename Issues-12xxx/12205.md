This is necessary so we can dump the ZODB spkg from Sage.

I did some work on this on the airplane, and better post a link before I forget about it or loose it:  http://wstein.org/patches/conway_polynomials-0.3.spkg

Basically, the database is tiny so it can easily and very efficiently just be stored as a standard sobj.   Using ZODB is silly.

In the end I am hitting a brick wall here. Possibly due to my lack of python skills and my will to only have minimal changes in conway.py. The issue is that the created sobj is a double dictionary and that the call to the ConwayPolynomials() class follow the same pattern as a double dictionary. You have calls of the kind:
ConwayPolynomials()[3][21]

Implementing the class as a dictionary allows sage to start 

```
import os

from sage.structure.sage_object import load
from sage.misc.misc import SAGE_DATA

_CONWAYDATA = os.path.join(SAGE_DATA,'conway_polynomials')

class ConwayPolynomials(dict):
    def __init__(self,*arg,**kw):
        """
        Initialize the database.
        """
        super(ConwayPolynomials, self).__init__(*arg, **kw)

    def _init(self):
        if not os.path.exists(_CONWAYDATA):
            raise RuntimeError, "In order to initialize the database, the directory must exist."%_CONWAYDATA
        os.chdir(_CONWAYDATA)
        self = load(os.path.join(_CONWAYDATA, 'conway_polynomials'))
```
but unfortunately but I get key errors:

```
sage: sage.databases.conway.ConwayPolynomials()[3][21]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/fbissey/Work/Overlays/BlueFern/sci-mathematics/sage/<ipython console> in <module>()

KeyError: 3
sage: sage.databases.conway.ConwayPolynomials().keys()

```
 I was hoping that inheriting the dict class the access problem would be solved but I am obviously doing something wrong here. Loading the sobj directly from sage is totally usable, it is just when trying to put it in a class.

This only changes the meaning of the `self` variable in the local scope. To modify the `self` object, use `self.update(load(…))` instead.

I don't think `_init` is a magic python method that automatically gets called. It may well be part of a protocol involved in sage.databases.db.Database. However, when you want to implement this as inheriting from `dict`, you'll have to call `_init` yourself in `__init__`, or better: just make `_init` part of it.

To make the dictionary read-only, you may want to override the dictionary modification methods too. Plus you probably want to amend pickling (interesting question: How should this pickle? Should it write its content to a file or should it pickle to "initialize ConwayPolynomials() for unpickling"?

As much as I understand, the "format" (in the sense of the "interface to retrieve data") does not change. That's exactly the point: If you wanted to inherit from dict, then you'd also have to have a `__setitem__` method - but we don't want to set data in an interactive session. All what we want is that during initialisation, data are obtained from a file, and then the user can retrieve these data (which is granted by the `__getitem__` method).

> ... since the code in sage is littered with calls to ConwayPolynomials()[p][n]

Would that be changed by the patch? Looking at the lines

```
    def __getitem__(self, key): 
        try: 
            return self._store[key] 
        except KeyError, err: 
            try: 
                if isinstance(key, (tuple, list)): 
                    if len(key) == 2: 
                        return self._store[key[0]][key[1]] 
            except KeyError: 
                pass 
            raise err 
```
it seems to me that `ConwayPolynomials()[p][n]` is still a possible syntax (that's `return self._store[key]`), but *in addition to the old syntax* we now also allow the syntax `ConwayPolynomials()[p, n]` (that's `return self._store[key[0]][key[1]]`).

> and changing the storage would imply changing an enormous amount of code.

By "storage", I understand the format of the data stored in the .sobj file containing the data base. I don't think that would be a problem, as long as there is a function that is able to read old data and transforms it into the new format.

> I trust that your python foo is way ahead of mine. I would never have produced that getitem and didn't find any examples to do that with google.

That's in [dive into python](http://www.diveintopython.net/object_oriented_framework/special_class_methods.html) or other Python introductions, or in the [Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names).

Sorry about that, I noticed it wouldn't install on 5.6-beta1, so I updated it (and changed to tuples at the same time).

```

That is very likely caused by an upstream bug in Cython that became immanent with #715.

Can you try with the new Cython spkg from #13896? I.e., install that spkg and do sage -ba.

**Attachment:** [12205_root.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12205/12205_root.patch.gz)

This needs to depend on `$(SAGERUNTIME)`, not only the Sage library because we actually run Sage code.  See new patch.

Moreover, this causes build problems for `sagenb`:

```

Basically, `$(INST)/$(SAGE)` is purely the Sage library (i.e. the stuff in `devel/sage`).  But actually starting Sage or running Sage code requires more, because things are imported from other packages, for example the notebook.  That stuff is in `$(SAGERUNTIME)`.

> Is it a new doctest?

No, it's not.  On first sight, it doesn't seem to use anything besides basic polynomial arithmetic.  But if basic polynomial arithmetic were broken, we would see a lot more doctests failing.

I'm not at all saying that this ticket has anything to do with it, I merge a bunch of tickets and when there's a failure I have to guess which ticket caused it.

Don't worry, it wasn't directed at anyone in particular!  Presumably it's something left over from debugging.  Shall I assume this is to be considered non-optimal and a ticket should be opened?

So... should I open a ticket?  It does seem bizarre, and apparently easily fixed?  But if it was necessary, I don't want to.
