Basically, the database is tiny so it can easily and very efficiently just be stored as a standard sobj.   Using ZODB is silly.

<a id='comment:11'></a>In the end I am hitting a brick wall here. Possibly due to my lack of python skills and my will to only have minimal changes in conway.py. The issue is that the created sobj is a double dictionary and that the call to the ConwayPolynomials() class follow the same pattern as a double dictionary. You have calls of the kind:
ConwayPolynomials()[3][21]

Implementing the class as a dictionary allows sage to start 

```
import os

from sage.structure.sage_object import load
from sage.misc.misc import SAGE_DATA

_CONWAYDATA = os.path.join(SAGE_DATA,'conway_polynomials')

class ConwayPolynomials(dict):
    def __init__(self,*arg,**kw):
        """
        Initialize the database.
        """
        super(ConwayPolynomials, self).__init__(*arg, **kw)

    def _init(self):
        if not os.path.exists(_CONWAYDATA):
            raise RuntimeError, "In order to initialize the database, the directory must exist."%_CONWAYDATA
        os.chdir(_CONWAYDATA)
        self = load(os.path.join(_CONWAYDATA, 'conway_polynomials'))
```
but unfortunately but I get key errors:

```

 I was hoping that inheriting the dict class the access problem would be solved but I am obviously doing something wrong here. Loading the sobj directly from sage is totally usable, it is just when trying to put it in a class.

<a id='comment:19'></a>I think we have to stick with the dictionary format since the code in sage is littered with calls to ConwayPolynomials()[p][n] and changing the storage would imply changing an enormous amount of code. I trust that your python foo is way ahead of mine. I would never have produced that getitem and didn't find any examples to do that with google. Your patch is longer than my current one but probably better behaved in the long run. It is very educative to me too.

As much as I understand, the "format" (in the sense of the "interface to retrieve data") does not change. That's exactly the point: If you wanted to inherit from dict, then you'd also have to have a `__setitem__` method - but we don't want to set data in an interactive session. All what we want is that during initialisation, data are obtained from a file, and then the user can retrieve these data (which is granted by the `__getitem__` method).

> ... since the code in sage is littered with calls to ConwayPolynomials()[p][n]


Would that be changed by the patch? Looking at the lines

```
    def __getitem__(self, key): 
        try: 
            return self._store[key] 
        except KeyError, err: 
            try: 
                if isinstance(key, (tuple, list)): 
                    if len(key) == 2: 
                        return self._store[key[0]][key[1]] 
            except KeyError: 
                pass 
            raise err 
```
it seems to me that `ConwayPolynomials()[p][n]` is still a possible syntax (that's `return self._store[key]`), but *in addition to the old syntax* we now also allow the syntax `ConwayPolynomials()[p, n]` (that's `return self._store[key[0]][key[1]]`).

> and changing the storage would imply changing an enormous amount of code.


By "storage", I understand the format of the data stored in the .sobj file containing the data base. I don't think that would be a problem, as long as there is a function that is able to read old data and transforms it into the new format.

> I trust that your python foo is way ahead of mine. I would never have produced that getitem and didn't find any examples to do that with google.


That's in [dive into python](http://www.diveintopython.net/object_oriented_framework/special_class_methods.html) or other Python introductions, or in the [Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names).

<a id='comment:34'></a>This is very bizzare I had no doctests failures with the previous version of the patch (on top of 5.5) but with this new one I get 

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage-main/sage/algebras/free_algebra.py"
The doctested process was killed by signal 11
         [1.4 s]
```
But if I add "-verbose" the test pass. There are no obvious relation with this ticket (and #10353 on which I am working at the same time) apart from the fact that it appeared out of the blue after application.

That is very likely caused by an upstream bug in Cython that became immanent with #715.

Can you try with the new Cython spkg from #13896? I.e., install that spkg and do sage -ba.

This needs to depend on `$(SAGERUNTIME)`, not only the Sage library because we actually run Sage code.  See new patch.

Moreover, this causes build problems for `sagenb`:

```
