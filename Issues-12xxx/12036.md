I assume the error about the testsuite would be part of this other ticket.

Also, the cdef methods are not tested (which I think is supposed to be okay), and neither is the `__dealloc__` method, which apparently is ok since it didn't show up on `sage -coverage`.


---

Questions: 
* Should this be in the reference manual?
* Should some of the examples in this patch (I really like the `__setitem__` examples) be in the main thing, so that `spline?` is more useful?

If so, these might as well be taken care of now.

Otherwise looks good.

Adding a `TestSuite(s).run()` run would be nice, but it will fail, since there is no support for pickling in this code.  Adding this to reference manual would be nice too, but that's other work.   

Regarding `__setitem__`, though it is perhaps interesting that this is supported, I doubt most people would even think to want to change the points that they are interpolating through after they create the spline. 

Basically, I want modifications to code that I doctest to be minimal -- I'm adding tests to get the coverage score to 90% for sage-5.0.  I don't want to introduce bugs.   Say what you will about this patch, it can't introduce bugs because it only changes docstrings.  I would like it refereed on those merits.  Keep in mind that I'm not introducing a *new* class into Sage for the first time.   If that were the case, then having TestSuite, pickling support, etc., would be absolutely required.   

Opening and resolving a new ticket to do everything you suggest will be easier now that this file has 100% coverage, since at least when adding some new code, you'll have some tests to run to reduce the chances the new code doesn't break things.

I wasn't too worried about `TestSuite`, just making sure (note I said "this *other* ticket", not meaning the current one).  I'll take your point on the `__setitem__` example as well, I don't use splines myself too much.

The reference manual issue is now #12045.
