I assume the error about the testsuite would be part of this other ticket.

Also, the cdef methods are not tested (which I think is supposed to be okay), and neither is the `__dealloc__` method, which apparently is ok since it didn't show up on `sage -coverage`.


---

Questions: 
* Should this be in the reference manual?
* Should some of the examples in this patch (I really like the `__setitem__` examples) be in the main thing, so that `spline?` is more useful?

If so, these might as well be taken care of now.

Otherwise looks good.

I wasn't too worried about `TestSuite`, just making sure (note I said "this *other* ticket", not meaning the current one).  I'll take your point on the `__setitem__` example as well, I don't use splines myself too much.

The reference manual issue is now #12045.
