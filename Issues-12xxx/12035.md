If I do

```
list_plot([1+I, 2+I, 4-I])
```
it's totally obvious what I want. We should make `list_plot` accept lists of complex numbers.

Patch up, please review. I improved the docstring for `list_plot`. I would like feedback on my method for detecting complex numbers. Right now, I do:

```
from sage.rings.complex_field import ComplexField 
CC = ComplexField() 
from sage.rings.complex_number import is_ComplexNumber 
if any(abs(CC(z).imag()) > 0 or is_ComplexNumber(z) for z in data): 
    data = [(z.real(), z.imag()) for z in data]
```
But I have a couple concerns:

* do we need to worry about numerical noise? Will testing for `abs(imaginary part) > 0` suffice?

* are `ComplexField()` and `is_ComplexNumber` the right functions to use here? 

Also, we *do* need to figure this out in `list_plot`, and not in `xydata_from_point_list`, because `list_plot` needs to decide whether to turn the data into tuples of real and imaginary parts, or do `zip(range(len(data)), data)`.

Okay, running `CC` on everything is a terrifically bad idea: here's the current (4.7.2) behavior:

```
sage: foo = [random() for _ in range(1000)]      
sage: %timeit p = list_plot(foo)                 
625 loops, best of 3: 596 µs per loop
sage: %timeit p = list_plot([CC(z) for z in foo])
125 loops, best of 3: 7.2 ms per loop
```
So, an order of magnitude slowdown. As suggested by William at https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/UiKTG3FkRwY/discussion, the new patch (up shortly) just catches a TypeError, which preserves the current speed for real input and neatly avoids the problem with `[int(1), CC(2+I),...]`; complex input anywhere will throw the TypeError, which we catch.
