This summer I wrote a package for psage (see http://code.google.com/p/purplesage/source/browse/psage/lseries/eulerprod.py) that allows one to compute with L-series attached to general Euler products, and implemented many cases, included everything supported in Sage, and a lot more.  This also did things that worked instead of the buggier #11631.   This code is similar to the L-series package in Magma, I guess (http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/text/1503). 

It would be useful to have a stable version of this code in Sage, at least the parts that don't depend on 64-bit only stuff in psage (like smalljac).   The point of this ticket is to to do that.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

The patch trac_12015-part1_updated.patch has some issues:
  
1. It patches a file called `sage/lfunctions/eulerprod_with_tripleprod.py` that is not even in my patch.   I'm guessing you took some old file from Sage days I had provided and started working on it.  However, that has little to do with the code in the patch I posted to this ticket. 

2. Why was this change made?

```
        118	 	sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-1) 
 	119	        sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2+1) 
```

3. The code needs to be indented here, but isn't (in your patch):

```
        174	        EXAMPLES:: 
 	175	 
 	176	        sage: from sage.lfunctions.eulerprod import LSeries 
 	177	        sage: from sage.lfunctions.eulerprod import LSeriesDerivative 
 	178	        sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2+1) 
 	179	        sage: L=LSeries(K); L 
```

4. Here in your patch the code is indented (good), but there is only one colon (instead of two) after EXAMPLES:

```
 	508	        EXAMPLES: 
 	509	 
 	510	            sage: from sage.lfunctions.eulerprod import LSeriesAbstract 
 	511	            sage: L1 = LSeriesAbstract(conductor=1, hodge_numbers=[0], weight=1, epsilon=1, poles=[1], residues=[-1], base_field=QQ) 
```

I think one major problem here still is the mix of things defined in eulerprod.py vs. dockchitser.py many functions like residues, epsilon should probably be for any dockchitser L-function if they are calling pari, with a wrapper in the LSeriesAbstract class?
