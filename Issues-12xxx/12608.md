Remove the following block from the PPL spkg:

```
# Dependencies check
MPIR_VERSION=`cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/; ./standard/newest_version mpir`
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Failed to find mpir.  Please install the mpir spkg"
    exit 1
fi
```

Although suggested by the developer manual, it doesn't do what is intented (it only checks that the mpir spkg exists, not that it has been installed).  It's also not needed, since it's a standard package depending on a standard package.

While I was changing the package anyway: use `patch` for patching and clean up `spkg-install`.

**spkg**: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/ppl-0.11.2.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/ppl-0.11.2.p1.spkg)

See #12609 for fixing the manual.
