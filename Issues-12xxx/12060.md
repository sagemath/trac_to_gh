It would be useful if the slider object in an `@`interact could display it's value in different formats. Right now, if the slider value is a float and `display_value=True`  the value is displayed to the maximum precision 

One proposal is to enhance the `display_value` parameter to the slider object so that it will accept arguments like `"%3.2f"` which would change how the slider value is displayed. 

It would also be useful if slider was able to guess an appropriate format based on the step size (if possible). See
