```
This adds syntax highlighting for the notebook debugger of ticket #7509.

Depends on patch [attachment: trac_7509.5.patch:ticket:7509..gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12451/ccf3a4424a077121bcb5f8d110c0c7bc.gz)

For reasons of speed only a small part of the source code around the current position is loaded and highlighted. We detect when the
code fragment starts in the middle of a docstring to ensure correct
highlighting in this case.
