This adds syntax highlighting for the notebook debugger of ticket #7509.

Depends on patch [attachment:trac_7509.5.patch:ticket:7509.](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12451/c86dfb5234ffb9c97dede7c4ca837f00)

For reasons of speed only a small part of the source code around the current position is loaded and highlighted. We detect when the
code fragment starts in the middle of a docstring to ensure correct
highlighting in this case.
