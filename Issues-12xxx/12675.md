```
sage: B= AbelianGroup([3,4,5])
sage: B.is_cyclic()
False
```

I'm making this a blocker since the fix will be very small, and the code as is outputs mathematically completely wrong answers.

If you really insist, them I'm happy to just delete the entire todo from the docstring.  It is weird having that there in the first place.
