```
sage: B= AbelianGroup([3,4,5])
sage: B.is_cyclic()
False
```

I'm making this a blocker since the fix will be very small, and the code as is outputs mathematically completely wrong answers.

NO.  It would be easier to implement the algorithm in the todo then delete the todo than to make it look nice.

If you really insist, them I'm happy to just delete the entire todo from the docstring.  It is weird having that there in the first place.

That seems reasonable, and it's the right fix, anyway.  Refreshed patch coming up.

You were **so** right about the general state of this, btw.
