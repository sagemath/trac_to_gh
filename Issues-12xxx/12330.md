The gp pexpect interface uses "eval_using_file_cutoff=50", which is extremely short.  This almost certainly causes inefficiencies because files will need to be used a lot.  Most likely, this was set to 50 to mask bug #12221.  Now that #12221 is fixed, this can be put back to a more reasonable value like 1024.

Depends on #12221
