On sage-devel, there are occasional complaints about the failure to upgrade because of uncommitted files in the root repository.  We should address these.  The culprit is in the script sage-update, and in particular the lines

```python
    if root_repo_intact:
        P = subprocess.Popen('hg status', shell=True,
                             stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        output = P.communicate()[0]
        if len(output) > 0: # uncommitted changes
            print ("There are uncommitted changes in the "
                   + "Sage root repository. Aborting.")
            sys.exit(2)
```
