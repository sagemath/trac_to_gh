In #12585 it was noticed that matrix0.pyx has

```
def unpickle(cls, parent, mutability, cache, data, version):
    r"""
    Unpickle a matrix. This is only used internally by Sage. Users
    should never call this function directly.
    
    EXAMPLES: We illustrating saving and loading several different
    types of matrices.
    
    OVER `\ZZ`::
    
        sage: A = matrix(ZZ,2,range(4))
        sage: loads(dumps(A)) # indirect doctest

which is ... incomplete?  Or if these are elsewhere in the doc, we can just remove those.
