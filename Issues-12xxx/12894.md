The optimization of ClasscallMetaclass in #12808 prevents dynamically changing the `__classcall__` method of a class. This followup adds an appropriate setter to enable this feature.

I was just hesitant whether we wanted to aim (in the long run) for one setter for each special method (set_classcall, set_classget, ...), or a single setter for all of them (and in that case what name we want for this setter).

Other than that, yes, needs review!

Hi Nicolas,

Thanks for this one. I've a request: You should describe the input of
`_set_classcall__` saying that the function must accept the class itself
at first argument. I'll try to post a review patch.

I'm also w little worried about the interface: Alternatively we could either

- make the attribute `classcall` public (maybe by renaming it with
  underscores (I mistyped underscare at first ;-)).

- or use a property to have a real setter allowing to a nicer syntax. I'm
  pretty sure Cython allows ot too.

Oops, I let that ticket die, whereas I need it soon in Sage for the
functorial constructions. Thanks for the reminder!

If the property approach can be made to work, it sounds like the one
that encapsulates best the details of the caching of the resolution of
classcall. So I vote for it. Does it look feasible?

We just need to check that we have a sufficiently recent Cython in Sage and
that this doesn't induce some unacceptable overhead.

I just looked at this, and it seems we can't make this approach work:
Indeed, even if we define `__classcall__` as a property in
ClasscallMetaclass, any class C which will implement its own
`__classcall__` will overwrite the property. But then,
C.__classcall__ = ... won't work ...

So at this point I'd go with just the _set_classcall approach, unless you see a way out.
