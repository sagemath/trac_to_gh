Sage fails to build using GCC 4.7.0 on various systems, for different reasons.

* GFan: #12760
* Givaro: #12761
* LinBox: #12762
* PolyBoRi: #12750, #12655
* MPIR on ia64 (Itanium): #12765 (GCC bug) -- #11616 also provides an MPIR 2.**4.0**.p3 spkg working around this.
* MPFR on ia64 (Itanium): #12837 (same GCC bug) -- Note that MPFR is also a prerequisite for building the GCC spkg.
* GMP-ECM on ia64 (Itanium): Fixed by #12830 (same GCC bug)
* zn_poly on ia64 (Itanium): Fixed by #12433 (same GCC bug)
* FLINT, NTL and PARI (as well as the Sage library) all fail to build on ia64 due to the same bug,
* R fails to build on ia64 during byte-compiling; seems to be a different issue, but same work-around works.  It also fails with `-O3` during byte-compiling on Solaris SPARC and Linux x86_64; on the former `-O2` works, on the latter somewhat surprisingly `-O3 -flto`.  (Cf. comments below.)
* Two files (`compat` and `linear`) of PARI's test suite fail due to segfaults when compiling with `-O3`/`-O2`/`-O1`, at least on Linux x86 and x86_64.
* zlib on Solaris: #12800
* eclib on Solaris (See comments below; this is a Solaris header issue, fixed by a new spkg at #10993.)
* FLINTQS on Solaris: #12855 (Also a subtle Solaris header issue.)
* Support GCC version "4.7": #13118.

**gcc-4.7.1 spkg** for testing purposes: #13150.

---

The ia64 bug is fixed in GCC 4.7.1, so we should apply the work-around only on GCC 4.7**.0** and only for packages which are prerequisites of GCC (since we don't plan to support Sage on ia64 with GCC 4.7.0, there is no point in work-arounds for *some* packages):

### mpir-2.4.0.p6 (Jeroen Demeyer, 28 May 2012)
* Trac #12751: Apply the ia64 workaround for gcc-4.7.0 *only* on
  gcc-4.7.0 and not on other gcc-4.7.x versions.

### mpfr-3.1.0.p2 (Jeroen Demeyer, 28 May 2012)
* Trac #12751: Apply the ia64 workaround for gcc-4.7.0 *only* on
  gcc-4.7.0 and not on other gcc-4.7.x versions.
* Remove pointless check for gmp.h.
* Rename MPFR_EXTRA_OPTS to MPFR_CONFIGURE for consistency with MPIR.

### zn_poly-0.9.p9 (Jeroen Demeyer, 28 May 2012)
* Trac #12751: remove the gcc-4.7.0 workaround for ia64 since this bug
  has been fixed in gcc-4.7.1 and we will not support building Sage
  with gcc-4.7.0 on Itanium.
* Don't override user-set CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

### ecm-6.3.p8 (Jeroen Demeyer, 28 May 2012)
* Trac #12751: remove the gcc-4.7.0 workaround for ia64 since this bug
  has been fixed in gcc-4.7.1 and we will not support building Sage
  with gcc-4.7.0 on Itanium.
* Remove unused variable SAGE_CONF_OPTS.
* Rename ECM_EXTRA_OPTS to ECM_CONFIGURE for consistency with MPIR.
* Don't override user-set CFLAGS.

Also PARI 2.5.1's test suite fails due to segfaults in two test files, `compat` and `linear` (statically linked `gp` as well as the dynamically linked one).

SciPy's test suite fails to build due to an internal compiler error.

R now fails to build for me (when byte-compiling), interestingly only with *less* fancy GCC optimizations enabled.  (It did build with LTO and Graphite loop optimization enabled).

This is all on Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS x86_64.

> SciPy's test suite fails to build due to an internal compiler error.


Turns out that this isn't reproducible.  Actually, in the first attempt (although with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`) *the build* failed, before the test suite got built or run.

I've then successfully rebuilt SciPy without `SAGE_CHECK=yes`, and now also again with it.

Nevertheless, SciPy's `spkg-check` (for whatever reason a Python script) is suboptimal, and `spkg-install` **overwrites** `LDFLAGS`.  (It also unsets `CFLAGS` etc., but distutils take these from Python, so that's not as bad as it sounds, provided one doesn't want to rebuild [Python and] SciPy with different flags.)

FWIW, I get the same test errors in the build with GCC 4.7.0 with LTO and Graphite loop optimization enabled.  Note that `ptestlong` passed for that build (with a couple of spkgs replaced, cf. sage-release thread for Sage 5.0.beta10).

This is *really* weird: R *does* build if I just in addition enable LTO... 8)

(My second Sage 5.0.beta10 build with GCC 4.7.0, without LTO and Graphite loop optimization, just used `-march=native -O3 -g -fno-strict-aliasing`.)

It fails in the same way; yet I have no idea why this only fails on Solaris, as AFAIK

```C
std::ldiv_t std::div(long int, long int)
```

is pretty C++98.  Maybe on Solaris just some `using namespace std;` gets pulled in, which isn't present on other systems.

Apparently Solaris' `/usr/include/stdlib.h` is the culprit:

Minimal example:

```c
// div.cc

#include <cstdlib>

int div(long a, long b)
{
  return 0;
}
```
This fails with GCC 4.7.0 on Solaris, while it doesn't on (e.g.) Linux.

See #12855 for a similar issue with the FLINTQS spkg, showing up as an ambiguous call of `log()` due to definitions from `math.h` (which puts all overloaded functions also into the *global* namespace).

On 32-bit Solaris SPARC (skynet machine mark2), R segfaults during byte-compiling package "base" when compiled with `-O3`; using `-O2` instead apparently works.

(The setup -- when just sourcing `/usr/local/skynet_bash_profile` -- on the Solaris machines is currently quite broken anyway.  In addition, R 2.14.0 messes up `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` such that the dynamic linker picks up an incompatible [and totally outdated] version of `libgcc_s.so.1`, so `R` cannot be run, which of course breaks the build as well.  A work-around is to create a symbolic link to the proper version in e.g. `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/`.)

There should be in the MPIR and MPFR packages, because those are prerequisites for the Sage GCC spkg.

Depends...  The compiler wrapper (afaik) doesn't know what code or spkg it currently builds, and usually only few parts are affected (probably with different work-arounds).  E.g. disabling optimization for the whole build is poor and may not even work.

It's probably more tedious to put [specific] work-arounds into a couple of spkgs, but IMHO also preserves some kind of modularity.

As a brute alternative, we could just blacklist (almost) all somehow non-functional compiler/OS combinations (most probably ignoring compiler options) *in Sage's prerequisite check*, but that's not very user- (nor developer-) friendly, and isn't "modular" either.




`$DYING_ARCH` does certainly have different values on different machines, or even depends on `$USER`... ;-)

We can hardly officially support platforms we have no access to.

Is skynet intentionally down?  Incidentally just tried to login...




  
> Either we deprecate ancient compiler workarounds or the spkg-installs will fill up with crud that nobody remembers why it is there or what Itanium was.


Well, that's a matter of documentation (and wikipedia ;-) ).

We used to clean up "obsolete" work-arounds regularly, have our weird prerequisites check (besides checks in some spkgs' `configure` scripts), and we meanwhile have a GCC spkg anyway (although we still have to make sure bootstrapping works, as Jeroen mentioned).

IMHO the bigger problem is some distros (or OSs) shipping immature compilers by default (some not even providing fixes later).  Always supporting the most recent GCC version on all skynet platforms may now be a requirement of the past; don't know.
