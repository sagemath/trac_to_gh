Caching does not work for the `~` operator.

```
sage: class A(object):
...    @cached_method
...    def __invert__(self):
...        return 1
sage: a = A() 
sage: ~a is ~a
False
```

Also the value of `a.__invert__` changes when calling `~a`.

This happens because special methods are called through the type and not the actual instance for new-style classes: http://docs.python.org/release/2.7.2/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=data%20model#special-method-lookup-for-new-style-classes

As of 5.0.beta4 no operators in sage use `@cached_method`.

Depends on #15038

Since no operators in Sage use `@`cached_method (yet), one shouldn't mark this ticket as "defect" but as "enhancement", I believe.

Since I don't think I am "upstream", I think the "report upstream" field should be "Doesn't apply".

I think I found the problem. Since the special method of the class is called, the `__get__` method of `CachedMethod` is relevant. Its purpose is to return a "cached method caller" that is bound to the instance.

This `__get__` method currently supposes that it is *only* called if the attribute is not overridden on the instance's `__dict__`. Namely, if the `CachedMethodCaller` is in the instance's `__dict__`, then Python's attribute lookup will not care about the `CachedMethod` if the instance's class.

Hence, `__get__` currently does

```python
        # This is for Parents or Elements that do not allow attribute assignment:
        try:
            name = self._cachedfunc.__name__
        except AttributeError:
            name = self.__name__
        try:
            return (<dict>inst.__cached_methods).__getitem__(name)
        except (AttributeError,TypeError,KeyError),msg:
            pass
```
and would then create a *new* `CachedMethodCaller`. However, in the example from the ticket description, there already is a `CachedMethodCaller` in the instance's `__dict__`, but it is ignored by the `__get__` method of the `CachedMethod`.

So, a potential solution is to additionally check `inst.__dict__.__getitem__(name)`.

What I don't like about this solution is that it would involve an additional dictionary lookup, which would slow-down every call to a cached method, fortunately only in the case that the instance does not support attribute assignment. And in addition, the call to the special method will *always* involve running this `__get__` method and doing a dictionary lookup.

Alternatively, one could create a special kind of cached method, specifically for special methods of new style classes whose instances allow for attribute assignment.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

In principle, it would be possible to change `CachedMethod.__get__` to deal both with usual and special methods. However, the price to pay would be either a slow-down when using cached methods on instances that don't allow attribute assignment, or cached special methods would be slow.

Therefore, I created a new class `CachedSpecialMethod` that overloads the `__get__` method. Now, cached_method is a function (not an alias of `CachedMethod`) that chooses amongst `CachedMethod` and `CachedSpecialMethod` based on the name of the wrapped method.

I also tried to tweak the case of (usual) cached methods in the case of forbidden attribute assignment.

**__Timings and examples__**

__With the patch:__

```
sage: class CCache(object):
....:     @cached_method
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         print "computing hash"
....:         return int(5)
....:     @cached_method
....:     def f(self):
....:         print "computing cached method with no args"
....:         return 4
....:     @cached_method
....:     def g(self, x):
....:         print "computing cached method with args"
....:         return x*2
....:     
sage: class CNoncache(object):
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         return int(5)
....:     def f(self):
....:         return 4
....:     def g(self, x):
....:         return x*2
....:     
sage: c = CCache()
sage: hash(c)
computing hash
5
sage: hash(c)
5
sage: c.f()
computing cached method with no args
4
sage: c.f()
4
sage: c.g(4)
computing cached method with args
8
sage: c.g(4)
8
sage: c.g(int(4))
8
sage: %timeit hash(c)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 241 ns per loop
sage: %timeit c.f()
10000000 loops, best of 3: 139 ns per loop
sage: %timeit c.g(4)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 694 ns per loop
sage: n = CNoncache()
sage: %timeit hash(n)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 827 ns per loop
sage: %timeit n.f()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 389 ns per loop
sage: %timeit n.g(4)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 669 ns per loop
```
Note that the cached hash is *faster* than an uncached hash that returns a constant number!!

Without attribute assignment (special methods can't be wrapped in Cython, so I can't wrap `__hash__`):

```
sage: cython("""
....: from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent
....: from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method
....: cdef class MyParent(Parent):
....:     @cached_method
....:     def f(self):
....:         return 4
....:     @cached_method
....:     def g(self,x):
....:         return x*2
....: """)
sage: m = MyParent()
sage: m.f() is m.f()
True
sage: m.g(4) is m.g(4)
True
sage: %timeit m.f()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 237 ns per loop
sage: %timeit m.g(4)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 831 ns per loop
```

__Without the patch__

The classes and instances are defined as above. As we know, caching the hash did not work, but of course it did work on usual methods:

```
sage: hash(c)
computing hash
5
sage: hash(c)
computing hash
5
sage: c.f() is c.f()
computing cached method with no args
True
sage: c.g(int(4)) is c.g(4)
computing cached method with args
True
```
The timing with the possibility to assign attributes did not change (as expected):

```
sage: %timeit c.f()
10000000 loops, best of 3: 137 ns per loop
sage: %timeit c.g(4)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 702 ns per loop
```
The timings without attribute assignment did improve with my patch as well:

```
sage: %timeit m.f()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 334 ns per loop
sage: %timeit m.g(4)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 958 ns per loop
```

**__Conclusion__**

I believe that my patch solves the problem and would be glad about a review :)

I didn't run the full test suite yet.

It could be that there is an interference with #15038, which I thus add as a dependency (it already has positive review).

*If* that's a problem. I simply don't know yet whether it is noticeable in startup-time. If it does not create a slow-down, I think it is more convenient to have a single decorator that works for both kind of methods.

> Plus, not all `__*__` are special method, are they? Since the list of special methods is short and discrete, I think you should match on the whole name. Perhaps the list is available in the python library somewhere.

Right. However, if we are talking about a cached non-special double underscore method for an instance that allows to assign attributes, then the distinction between `CachedMethod` and `CachedSpecialMethod` is irrelevant! Namely, if attribute assignment works, then the `__get__` method will be called precisely once. There are only three reasons why the `__get__` method could be called repeatedly:
- Attribute assignment does not work, hence, stuff will be stored in (and retrieved from) `inst.__cached_methods`.
- We have a special method, so that Python won't look into `inst.__dict__`.
- The user does `del inst.method_name`.

So, I think it is a non-issue. But of course, we could do a look-up in a finite list of special methods. I just fear that this would create an even bigger slow-down (*if* there is any slow-down noticeable).

Sure. That's why I wrote "(special methods can't be wrapped in Cython, so I can't wrap `__hash__`)" in [comment:9](#comment:9).

In any case, cdef classes do not play totally nicely with cached methods anyway. They quite often don't allow attribute assignment, and that's why I introduced `inst.__cached_methods` in the first place, a couple of years ago. Without it, cached methods on cdef classes would not only be even slower, but they wouldn't be cached at all!

I didn't change argument fixer here. There was some change in #15038, namely: Postpone creation of the argument fixer. I think it was #8611 and #11115 when I last worked on speeding up the argument fixer.

That's clearly for a different ticket.

Again, that's a different ticket.

Anyway, the patchbot also reports a failure. I could not reproduce it at home. So, I hope it is random noise.

No that should be fine. Strings like that would be fully interned, so looking
them up in a set or as dictionary keys will actually be significantly faster
than doing string manipulations. (remember that these are attribute names.
Python is very much invested in making attribute lookup lightning fast)

Example:

```
special_methods=set(['__get__','__set__','__hash__'])

def is_special1(method):
  return method in special_methods
def is_special2(method):
  return method.startswith('__') and method.endswith('__')
```
Lookup is quite a bit faster than doing string manipulations:

```
sage: timeit("is_special1('__hash__')",number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 124 ns per loop
sage: timeit("is_special2('__hash__')",number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 380 ns per loop
```

In an attempt to be a little systematic in extracting a complete list of methods that get stored in slots on a type object (those are the methods that need special attention, right?), I used

```
grep 'SLOT(".*"' Objects/typeobject.c
```
to extract the relevant lines from the definition of `slotdefs` in the python source. When processed, I obtain the list:

```
['__abs__', '__add__', '__and__', '__call__', '__cmp__', '__coerce__', '__contains__', '__del__', '__delattr__', '__delete__', '__delitem__', '__delslice__', '__div__', '__eq__', '__float__', '__floordiv__', '__ge__', '__get__', '__getattr__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__getslice__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__hex__', '__iadd__', '__iand__', '__idiv__', '__ifloordiv__', '__ilshift__', '__imod__', '__imul__', '__index__', '__init__', '__int__', '__invert__', '__ior__', '__ipow__', '__irshift__', '__isub__', '__iter__', '__itruediv__', '__ixor__', '__le__', '__len__', '__long__', '__lshift__', '__lt__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__neg__', '__new__', '__nonzero__', '__oct__', '__or__', '__pos__', '__pow__', '__radd__', '__rand__', '__rdiv__', '__repr__', '__rfloordiv__', '__rlshift__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__ror__', '__rpow__', '__rrshift__', '__rshift__', '__rsub__', '__rtruediv__', '__rxor__', '__set__', '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__setslice__', '__str__', '__sub__', '__truediv__', '__xor__', 'next']
```
Hopefully this list is complete. Is there another source of such methods? I noticed that there is a non-underscored method in there as well: `next` (this got fixed in Python 3). Admittedly, one should probably never cache that, but it's not the job of the decorator to enforce that.

Unfortunately, this list is not complete. For instance:

```
class T(object):
  @cached_method
  def __complex__(self):
    print "called"
    return 1
t=T()
```
does not cache on `complex(t)`. The key seems to by calls to `_PyObject_LookupSpecial`, which does the lookup on the type rather than on the instance. The only uses of this routine yield:

```
"__length_hint__", "__format__", "__missing__", "__instancecheck__", "__subclasscheck__", "__complex__", "__reversed__", "__unicode__", "__dir__", "__sizeof__"
```
so hopefully adding those *does* give us a complete list.

I have created a git branch for this ticket, containing the original patch, removing some trailing whitespace that the patch has introduced, and then changing the detection of special method names to using a frozenset of all names that Nils has mentioned here (note that Nils presented two lists, and I combined both).

Tests pass for me. Needs review, then.
