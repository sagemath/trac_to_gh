I'm not sure we can use ".dimensions()" for this, at least by itself.  Our terminology is already a little weird.. in the parent MatrixSpace, we have:

```
sage: m = Matrix(QQ, 3, 5)
sage: m
[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
sage: parent(m)
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 5 dense matrices over Rational Field
sage: ms = parent(m)
sage: ms.dim 
ms.dimension  ms.dims       
sage: ms.dims()
(3, 5)
sage: ms.dimension()
15
```

Those aren't the names I'd have chosen, but given that they're there, we shouldn't have .dims() work for the MatrixSpace and .dimensions() work for an element in the space.

.dimensions() is a better name, IMHO, so maybe we should make both .dimensions() and .dimension() work for the MatrixSpace and for a Matrix, and let .dims() be an alias for .dimensions() for backward compatibility purposes.  Above my pay grade, though.

I personally can not remember using or hearing the word "dimensions" to refer to the number of rows and columns of a matrix.  However, I just did a google search, and this is *definitely* very standard terminology all over the place.   So I think it is very sensible to add this.

It would be good to have dims = dimensions as an alias for consistency.  Don't just change it since that will break code.

ms.dimension() is literally the dimension of the matrix space itself.  This has nothing to do with "dimensions()", except that it is the product of them.

I totally agree with your conclusion.  But I'm not convinced that changes to MatrixSpace should be part of this ticket.  It could be in another ticket.

2. The description in the patch should probably be "Trac #12604: Added a method to a matrix which gives the dimensions."

3. The author should be "Ben Lundell" instead of math480 student. 

I've attached a patch fixing all these issues.

This is a use of the word "nothing" with which I am not familiar. :-)
