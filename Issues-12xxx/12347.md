when I compile Sage 4.8 from source in say `/tmp/sage-4.8`, then
I do `make install DESTDIR=/usr/local/sage-4.8`, and I run the binary `/usr/local/sage-4.8/bin/sage` I get:

```
[zimmerma@coing ~]$ /usr/local/sage-4.8/bin/sage
************************************************************************
You must compile Sage first using 'make' in the Sage root directory.
(If you have already compiled Sage, you must set the SAGE_ROOT variable
in the file '/usr/local/sage-4.8/bin/sage').
************************************************************************
```
This way of compiling and installing Sage worked before, up to Sage 4.7.2.

A fix is to add the line

```
SAGE_ROOT="/usr/local/sage-4.8/sage
```
in the script `/usr/local/sage-4.8/bin/sage`. This was done
automatically by `make install` up to 4.7.2, and was broken in Sage 4.8.

Hard coding of SAGE_ROOT is removed from `make install` now. We simply do a symbolic link.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

The sage directory is relocatable and so simply moving the directory from `/tmp/sage-4.8` to `/usr/local/sage-4.8` will enable you to run sage again. After moving the folder you should also run sage just once ( `/usr/local/sage-4.8/sage` ) so that it resolves all the paths.

As for make install being broken, it seems to happen because there is no `SAGE_ROOT="....."` in the file anymore and so that hard coding doesn't get done any more. A simple fix should be this patch to the Makefile in your `/tmp/sage-4.8/Makefile`:

Ok. Here is a fix for the hard coding of the path. The simplest fix is to not do any hard coding at all!

Please apply [attachment: trac_12347.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12347/trac_12347.patch.gz) to `SAGE_ROOT` (the directory where the `Makefile` is present). If the review is positive then we should also remove `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-hardcode_sage_root` from the tree since it is no longer needed.

I also ran into some problems with `cp`, in particular with this line in the `Makefile`:

```
cp -rpv * $(DESTDIR)/sage/
```
On the system that I tried this, cp actually errored out with error status 2. The last few lines of the make output are as follows:

```
$ make DESTDIR="/tmp/sage-install" install

.... tons of copying stuff ....

`spkg/logs/matplotlib-1.0.1.p0.log' -> `/tmp/sage-install/sage/spkg/logs/matplotlib-1.0.1.p0.log'
`spkg/logs/sqlite-3.7.5.p0.log' -> `/tmp/sage-install/sage/spkg/logs/sqlite-3.7.5.p0.log'
`start.log' -> `/tmp/sage-install/sage/start.log'
`tmp' -> `/tmp/sage-install/sage/tmp'
make: *** [install] Error 1
```
I can not fathom why it errors out. As a workaround, I changed the `cp` command to include `-u` and the cp finishes fine after invoking the make command once again:

```
$ make DESTDIR="/tmp/sage-install" install
echo "Experimental use only!"
Experimental use only!
if [ "/tmp/sage-install" = "" ]; then \
		echo "Set DESTDIR"; \
		exit 1; \
	fi
mkdir -p /tmp/sage-install
mkdir -p /tmp/sage-install/sage
mkdir -p /tmp/sage-install/bin/
cp -rpuv * /tmp/sage-install/sage/

You shouldn't use the options `-u`, `-v`, or `-R` for cp.  Re `-r`, the man page for cp on OS X says

```
     Historic versions of the cp utility had a -r option.  This implementation supports that
     option; however, its use is strongly discouraged, as it does not correctly copy special
     files, symbolic links, or fifo's.
```
The OS X version of cp doesn't recognize the `-u` option at all.  The Solaris version of cp doesn't support `-u` or `-v`.

Make sure to only use Posix-standard options; I think [this web page](http://pwet.fr/man/linux/commandes/posix/cp) is accurate.

Along the same lines, on Solaris (and perhaps other platforms), `ln -f` doesn't behave the way it does on linux; see the comment on line 71 of the file SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-build.

Replying to [@ppurka](#comment%3A9):
> @jhpalmieri: I added -u to make sure that the second time `make install` is run, cp does not go around copying the files all over again. 

Solaris is a supported platform for Sage on which the `-u` option is not recognized, so it doesn't matter too much why you added it: it's not going to work.

> The options `-r`, `-v` were all present from before. 

But while you're fixing other things, you might as well fix this.  Just use `-R` or `-pR` instead.

> `ln -f` was needed in case the user ran `make install` yet again, otherwise ln would give error. If the first invocation of make install doesn't fail, then there is no need to use -f with ln.

Same comment as before: it's not going to work this way, so you should do it a different way.  (For example, first run 'rm -f ...' on the link, then do 'ln -s ...'.)

> If `cp` is unreliable then what is the alternative (it is actually quite reliable on linux with the `-a` option, that is, it copies symlinks properly)? Alternatively, can we assume that `rsync` is available on all platforms and use rsync instead?

I think that 'cp -pR' is reliable on all platforms.  Note also that the 'make install' option says "Experimental use only!", so I don't think it's been well-maintained or supported, or even used much, which is why, for example, the `-v` option for cp wasn't removed earlier.  But if you're working on this, you should do it right, so that it works on all supported platforms.  Using POSIX-standard commands should be completely reliable; every platform's version of 'cp' should support the POSIX-standard options for cp.

Updated the patches.

Now I see why cp failed:

```
...stallations/sage-4.8> make DESTDIR="/tmp/sage-xxxx" install |& tee -i -a ~/tmp/log-new.txt
echo "Experimental use only!"
Experimental use only!
if [ "/tmp/sage-xxxx" = "" ]; then \
		echo "Set DESTDIR"; \
		exit 1; \
	fi
mkdir -p /tmp/sage-xxxx
mkdir -p /tmp/sage-xxxx/sage
mkdir -p /tmp/sage-xxxx/bin/
cp -Rp * /tmp/sage-xxxx/sage/
cp: reading `local/lib/libpari.a': Input/output error
make: *** [install] Error 1
```
Rebuilding pari makes this bug go away

```
~/Installations/sage-4.8> ./sage -f spkg/standard/pari-2.5.0.p3.spkg >& ~/tmp/pari.txt
~/Installations/sage-4.8> cp local/lib/libpari.a /tmp

Just one more thing: it would be better to first delete `$(DESTDIR)/sage/` for two reasons:
1. if there already was a previous version, there might be some kind of conflict (although I cannot immediately think of a concrete problem that could occur).
2. some program in the old version might still be running (considering `sage-cleaner`, this is less unlikely than you might think at first).

"`[ -e`" isn't portable.  "`[ -f`" is portable.

Why do you talk about symlinks in your comment?  I don't see that in your code.

I would simply remove the whole `elif` block.  `mkdir -p "$(DESTDIR)"/sage` should fail anyway if `"$(DESTDIR)"/sage` is a non-directory.
