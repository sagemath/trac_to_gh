See [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/zVmqCIv82zI/discussion).

The docstring of `DiGraph().all_simple_paths` starts with this paragraph:

```
       Returns a list of all the simple paths of self starting with one of
       the given vertices. A path is simple if no vertex occurs twice in
       it except possibly the starting and ending one. The paths are
       enumerated in increasing length order.
```

In short, the `DiGraph().all_simple_paths` function deems paths of the form `[a, b, c, b]` to be simple. This is not true according to the generally accepted definition of a simple path. I suspect the intent of the author was to allow paths of the form `[b, c, b]` (i.e. paths which are actually cycles), which seems reasonable.

Another possibility would be to use the definition found on Wikipedia, namely that a simple path must not have *any* repeated vertices, and that a "simple cycle" is a path whose first vertex is its last vertex but has no other vertex repetitions. In this case the function should exclude both paths of the form `[a, b, c, b]` and paths of the form `[b, c, b]`. But I don't see that this is very useful. The function allows you to specify sets of starting and ending points for the paths you want returned, and if you specify non-disjoint sets, you are likely asking for cycles to be included.

Incidentally, a definition that matches what is given in the first paragraph above is this: a "simple path" in a directed graph is a sequence of arcs such that the head of each arc is the tail of the next arc in the sequence, and no two arcs share the same head or the same tail.

Here's a patch which implements the first suggestion in the ticket description. The original ticket seems to be #8273 so I'm CCing the author and reviewer of that ticket.

Doing a `make ptestlong` on this patch now, though the file in question passes and `search_src()` tells me this function is not used by any other code, so I don't expect any doctest problems.

Hellooooo !!!

Hmmm... I was a bit worried at your path.count(path[-1]) `^^;`

What do you think of the alternative version I attach ? In this one I check whether the path is a cycle *before* adding it to the queue. This way a "neighbor in path" is sufficient.

I also do not understand why you removed the "if trivial" from before the loop to put it inside. It would be a waste to "test" trivial at each loop, and also to test len(path) > 1 when we know it will always be true after some step, wouldn't it ?

Tell me what you think `:-)`

Hi, Keshav and Nathann,

Thank you, Keshav, for finding that bug, I'm sorry we missed it the first time.

Since Nathann has already started the review, I'll let him finish it (I don't even have the last Sage version installed on my computer).

By the way, the title "Questionable semantics of DiGraph().all_simple_paths" could be replaced by "Wrong semantics of DiGraph().all_simple_paths" :-)

Can you explain? I think the same expression was used in the old code.

> What do you think of the alternative version I attach ? In this one I check whether the path is a cycle *before* adding it to the queue. This way a "neighbor in path" is sufficient.


Nice! It's definitely better. I don't know why I avoided touching that last loop. Of course that is the better place to do this logic.
