The following is obviously wrong:

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, Subsets([1,2,3]))
sage: x = F.an_element()
sage: x+0 == x
False
sage: x+F.zero() == x
False
```
The reason is

```
sage: (x+F.zero()).terms()  # random
[2*B[{1}], 3*B[{2}], B[{}]]
sage: x.terms()             # random
[2*B[{1}], B[{}], 3*B[{2}]]
```

Fixing equality testing also revealed a bug in sage.combinat.sf.dual: the conversion back from the dual basis did not strip cancelled terms from the dictionary. This conversion now uses dict_linear_combination which fixes the bug, factors out code and should be faster.

I uploaded the patch on behalf of Nicolas and put a positive review since I'm Ok with it (the test suite is currently running). 

Nicolas: I just put the correct trac ticket number and added one more test compared to your patch. I don't think this needs a new review.

Thanks for catching that. I am working on it. First thing, I am extracting the call to _test_associativity to only set # long on it, and not on the full testsuite (otherwise I would have caught the error myself). The other thing is that the new equality test highlighted a preexisting bug: x*f.one() contains zero coefficients in its dictionary.
