Don't you think it would be really good if there were at least one test of the form "# optional - chomp" in the Sage library?
In sage-4.8,

```
sage: search_src('chomp')
```
outputs 67 lines of code that somehow mention chomp, but there are no doctests at all.

There are about 30 such tests now.  Try:

```
search_src('chomp', 'optional', ignore_case=True)
```
I propose closing this as invalid.

Yup, I found a bunch. From e.g. sage/homology/tests.py,

```
"""
Tests for chain complexes, simplicial complexes, etc.

These test whether CHomP gives the same answers as Sage's built-in
homology calculator.

TESTS::

    sage: from sage.homology.tests import test_random_chain_complex
    sage: test_random_chain_complex(trials=20)  # optional - CHomP
    sage: test_random_chain_complex(level=2, trials=20)  # optional - CHomP
    sage: test_random_chain_complex(level=3, trials=20)  # long time # optional - CHomP

    sage: from sage.homology.tests import test_random_simplicial_complex
    sage: test_random_simplicial_complex(level=1, trials=20)  # optional - CHomP
    sage: test_random_simplicial_complex(level=2, trials=20)  # optional - CHomP
    sage: test_random_simplicial_complex(level=5/2, trials=10)  # long time # optional - CHomP
"""

IMHO, it really sucks that search_src is case sensitive by default.  I had no idea.  That's why I didn't find the tests.
