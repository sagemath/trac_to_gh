The problem was in ECL and is fixed upstream (thanks Juan Jose Garcia-Ripoll).

A package containing the patch is available here :
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jpuydt/ecl-11.1.2.cvs20111120.p2.spkg

This package is mostly known to fix the problem on ARM ; I'm running 'make ptestlong' on ARM, and will report the results.

I'll also check X86_64 as soon as I'll have re-compiled 5.0 on sage.math, but if someone can beat me to it, the better!

The package passes the integration.pyx tests on ARM... but without the patch!

So here is http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jpuydt/ticket_12586_fix_doctest-v2.patch ; with this patch and my ecl package, everything is ok on X86_64 (all tests pass) and on ARM (all tests pass except the ones about the gamma function, which aren't supposed to pass anyway).

Marking as needs_review, as perhaps it would be nice to check on other architectures.
