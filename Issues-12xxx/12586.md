The problem was in ECL and is fixed upstream (thanks Juan Jose Garcia-Ripoll).

A package containing the patch is available here :
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jpuydt/ecl-11.1.2.cvs20111120.p2.spkg

This package is mostly known to fix the problem on ARM ; I'm running 'make ptestlong' on ARM, and will report the results.

I'll also check X86_64 as soon as I'll have re-compiled 5.0 on sage.math, but if someone can beat me to it, the better!
