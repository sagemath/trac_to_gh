In Magma, one can do the following:

```
> Q := RationalField();
> P<x,y,z> := ProjectiveSpace(Q,2);
> L := LinearSystem(P,2);
> L;
Linear system on Projective Space of dimension 2
Variables : x, y, z
with 6 sections: x^2 x*y x*z y^2 y*z z^2
> p := P ! [3,2,1];
> L1 := LinearSystem(L,p);
> L1;
Linear system on Projective Space of dimension 2
Variables : x, y, z
with 5 sections:
x^2 - 9*z^2
x*y - 6*z^2
x*z - 3*z^2
y^2 - 4*z^2
y*z - 2*z^2
```
Sage does not have this functionality. This patch will be a first step towards adding a class LinearSystem to Sage.

The goal is to add a method _linear_system_as_kernel to projective spaces that returns a matrix whose kernel can be identified with the degree d hypersurfaces with multiplicity at least m at pt.

(I actually need this method in the context of equimultiple liftings of plane curves over finite fields for which I will open a separate ticket.)

In the documentation part of the patch it says that the output is a matrix of size

The syntax

`raise Error, 'error message'`

has been deprecated in Python. http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.8/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions

We should use

`raise Error('error message')`

instead.

Hi!

I have a question: It says in the documentation part that the output is with respect to reverse lexicographic ordering of monomials. But it seems to me that, for example in the case of degree 2 in projective 2-space the monomials are ordered as:

`[x<sup>2,xy,xz,y</sup>2,yz,z^2]`

which seems to be just the lexicographic ordering rather than reverse lexicographic ordering.

If you agree I can incorporate this change into the review patch.
