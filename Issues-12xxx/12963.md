As noted on sage-support, the sage-5.0 **binary** `sage-5.0-linux-32bit-fedora_release_16_verne_-i686-Linux.tar.gz` requires the boost library `libboost_unit_test_framework` at runtime, since the binary was built on a machine with that library available.  PolyBoRi checks for `-lboost_unit_test_framework` and links against it if available.

This is because of the PolyBoRi upgrade to version 0.8.1.  The older PolyBoRi in sage-4.8 did not do this.

There are two solutions:
1. Fix PolyBoRi not to link against `-lboost_unit_test_framework` when SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes.
2. Add the boost library to Sage (currently, only the boost headers are installed).

The following **spkg** implements the first solution: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/polybori-0.8.1.p2.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/polybori-0.8.1.p2.spkg)

I'd be in favor of adding the missing bits of boost. Its a great library and we should make more use of it if anything.
