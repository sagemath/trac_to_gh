Custom numeric evaluation functions defined in the `_evalf_()` method of symbolic functions accept only the parent of the result as an argument. We should expand this to allow passing an `algorithm` parameter as well.

Merge together with dependencies (i.e. there are circular dependencies).

The `evalf_dict` branch of Pynac [available here](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac-wip/), with the attached patches applied to the Sage library, allows this:

```
sage: cot(1/2).n(algorithm='foo')
11.0000000000000
sage: cot(1/2).n()
1.83048772171245
```

The docstrings for `_convert()` etc. methods of symbolic expressions need to be updated to reflect these changes.

I'm trying to rebase the patch [This is the Trac macro *attachment:trac_12289-evalf_dictionary.patch* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#attachment:trac_12289-evalf_dictionary.patch-macro) to sage-5.0, but I'm running into a problem with the type of `py_funcs.py_float`. In the patch py_float has type `object (*)(object, object)` but in sage-5.0, it has type `object (*)(object, PyObject *)` I guess because of a pynac change in the meantime. 

To be more specific, with this type def for `py_float`:

```
cdef public object py_float(object n, object kwds) except +:
```

I rebuild sage and get:

```

Error compiling Cython file:

I've been working on this ticket today at sd40.5. I've got burcin's changes working in sage-5.0 with a caveat. Here's how to get the example in[comment:1](#comment%3A1) working in sage-5.0:

1. install the `__patched__` pynac-0.2.4.p1 spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/bjones/pynac-0.2.4.p1.spkg. this spkg is the pynac-0.2.4 spkg from #12950 which has been patched to include the changes from burcin's `pynac-wip` branch of pynac mentioned above.

2. apply all patches at #12950, here is a shell script to help that (run from `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`): http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/bjones/trac_12950_apply.sh

3. apply the patches to `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`
