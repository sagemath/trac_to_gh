Custom numeric evaluation functions defined in the `_evalf_()` method of symbolic functions accept only the parent of the result as an argument. We should expand this to allow passing an `algorithm` parameter as well.

Merge together with dependencies (i.e. there are circular dependencies).

<a id='comment:1'></a>The `evalf_dict` branch of Pynac [available here](https://bitbucket.org/burcin/pynac-wip/), with the attached patches applied to the Sage library, allows this:

```
sage: cot(1/2).n(algorithm='foo')
11.0000000000000
sage: cot(1/2).n()
1.83048772171245
```

The docstrings for `_convert()` etc. methods of symbolic expressions need to be updated to reflect these changes.

In the patch py_float has type `object (*)(object, object)` but in sage-5.0, it has type `object (*)(object, PyObject *)` I guess because of a pynac change in the meantime. 

To be more specific, with this type def for `py_float`:

```
cdef public object py_float(object n, object kwds) except +:

<a id='comment:10'></a>>  1. install the __patched__ pynac-0.2.4.p1 spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/bjones/pynac-0.2.4.p1.spkg. this spkg is the pynac-0.2.4 spkg from #12950 which has been patched to include the changes from burcin's `pynac-wip` branch of pynac mentioned above.
  
Is this stuff in the current Pynac 0.2.6?
>  2. apply all patches at #12950, here is a shell script to help that (run from `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage`): http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/bjones/trac_12950_apply.sh
  
Can now be skipped, presumably.
