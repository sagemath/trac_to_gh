The code `plot([x,x^2],-.2,2)` is a nice shortcut for plotting both x and x!^ 2 on the same graph. However, if you want to choose different colors or linestyles for each function, then it seems you have to execute, e.g.,

```
p1=plot(x,-.2,1.2,color='blue',linestyle='dotted'); 
p2=plot(x^2,-.2,1.2,color='red',linestyle='dashed');Â 
p1+p2
```
Here is how Maple and Mathematica handle this issue, respectively:

It seems that the keyword 'fill' allows for a dictionary input, so perhaps the relevant code there could serve as a template?

```
[> plot([x, x^2], x= -.2..1.2, color=["blue", "red"],linestyle=[dot, longdash]);

In[1]:= Plot[{x, x^2}, {x, -.2, 1.2}, PlotStyle -> {{Blue, Dotted}, {Red, Dashed}}]
```

*Remarks:* 
1. distinct choices for the curves should be made automatically for the user. Running, e.g., 

```
In[1]:= Plot[{x, x^2}, {x, -.2, 1.2}]
```
in Mathematica produces two curves that are not both solid-blue.

2. the functionality for `fillcolor`, `color`, and `fill` should be the same insofar as possible.

On matters of code, the doctests now pass but documentation building is still a problem, with at least two plots failing. Aaron, please try building the documentation to see where the errors are.

One feature that I do not like in this branch is that `linestyle` defaults to automatic. I find solid lines much easier to read and would prefer that `linestyle` default to solid. That is in line with Mathematica behavior.

Also, if both `rgbcolor` and `color` are specified, this branch silently overrides the former with the latter. In the current version of `plot.py`, specifying both of these options leads to a `RuntimeError` coming from the current line 780:

```
@rename_keyword(color='rgbcolor')
```

I was in the future planning to remove that line and add code to raise a `ValueError` as Travis had me do in #9654. I think this branch should raise the `ValueError` rather than silently override an option, and then this decorator can be removed.

After reading all comments but not studying the code:
- I most definitely agree that `linestyle` should be a solid line for all unless changed by a user;
- I don't think we should be too concerned with making "proper choice" for default different colors: the current situation is that they all are the same and users who care about multiple functions probably have multiple plot commands with custom colors. Hence we will not affect/break old code as long as the default for a single plot is the same/similar.

Usually in this case one of two things is done (I don't think this is an "official" policy, though):
* Ask on sage-devel if anyone cares
* Majority rule on the ticket
Sometimes it does matter enough, but even then usually on sage-devel only a few people will pipe up unless it's something that affects a fairly broad range of people.

In this case, I don't care strongly enough to block this now that several people have 'officially' weighed in (including on #8164).  You may still want to look there regarding different *options* for auto-coloring - matplotlib had a [huge and long debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU) over their new default colormap for best visualization of data.  But in any case once it's decided here, you should close #8164 as a dup.

I have no idea about what happened to the branch...strange...

My 2 cents: I think having the default linestyle being a solid color is what we should do. I haven't really looked into the code, but just having the option of providing multiple colors is a huge +1 for including this (and is a natural thing for people to try when doing multiple plots).

Hmm..

Okay, I confirm the `RuntimeError` when both `color` and `rgbcolor` are specified. But I'm not sure I understand what you are proposing. 
* Do you want a `ValueError` if the keyword `color` is used at all? (or if you prefer, `rgbcolor` is used?)
* Or do you want a `ValueError` if *both* are specified? I don't know why anybody would do this, but I also don't have an objection to adding such a check.

Is there any reason to have both keywords floating around? Perhaps the simplest solution is for me to replace all instances of `rgbcolor` with `color` within `plot.py`?  (When I first read this code, I assumed the `@rename_keyword` call was a generous short-cut provided to the end-user by the code-writer. I certainly don't want to write `rgbcolor=` if I don't have to.)

The `@rename_keyword` decorator in this file first appeared in #4201. On the same ticket this decorator and `@options` were added to `misc/decorators.py`. The description for the latter is about the convenience of the end user, so I think we can assume the same for the former.

The functions in a plot get passed to `line.py` as subplots, and the `_allowed_options` for lines include `rgbcolor` but not `color`. We can't just rename keywords here that are expected to have a certain name elsewhere, unless you want to track down every plot file that will get output from `plot.py` and change all of them.

What Travis had me do in #9654 was raise the `ValueError` only if both keywords were used at the same time. This lets the end user input either keyword as desired but avoids conflicting information that might confuse.

On #9654 color values were passed to another keyword, so I did the check to make sure only one was present and set the new keyword value. For this ticket `rgbcolor` is expected in other places, so after checking that only one is present you could use presumably use  the function `rename_keyword(color='rgbcolor')` when `color` is present to copy over values, but then always use the keyword `rgbcolor` when passing values elsewhere.

This reply is bit long-winded, but I'd like to have a record of some of the details of how plotting works in Sage. Let me also know if I've not yet been clear enough.

Aaron, a couple minor things:

1) When the plot/subplot is created in what is currently L1994, please use the keyword `rgbcolor`  rather than `color` for consistency with other plot files.

2) Most files I've seen in Sage don't have spaces around the equals sign when assigning keyword arguments. Please remove the extra white space for consistency with other files. 

Thanks!

ran into a problem naively implementing this. Simply replacing `color` with `rgbcolor` on L2139 (in current ticket) breaks Sage's plot() function. **I'm not sure I can track down the problem,** but I'll give it a try tomorrow.
>

A remark on the documentation fix mentioned above.
This is what I want to mimic with sphinx_plot:

```
        sage: p1 = plot([sin(x), cos(2*x)*sin(x)], -pi, pi, fill={1: [0]}, fillcolor='blue', fillalpha=.25, color='blue')
        sage: p2 = plot([sin(x), cos(2*x)*sin(x)], -pi, pi, fill={0: 1, 1:[0]}, color=['blue'])
        sage: p3 = plot([sin(x), cos(2*x)*sin(x)], -pi, pi, fill=[0, [0]], fillcolor=['#f60'], fillalpha=1, color={1: 'blue'})
        sage: p4 = plot([sin(x), cos(2*x)*sin(x)], (x,-pi, pi), fill=[0, x/pi], fillcolor='grey', color=['red', 'blue'])
        sage: graphics_array([[p1, p2], [p3, p4]]).show(frame=True, axes=False) # long time
```
I'm not quite sure how to get frame and axes options passed to sphinx_plot:

Any ideas?

ah yes... it occurred to me that this was a natural extension of what was asked for in [comment:16]. My apologies for not mentioning it.

I don't know that I agree. I was trying to think of all the reasons I'd just include one label... "trig functions" or "cos(nx)" or some such. I don't think I'd want to see that written multiple times. Certainly, seeing "f" or "x<sup>2</sup>" written multiple times would be silly. But, it is nearly as easy to write ["trig functions", "", ""] as it is to write "trig functions", so I'm happy to modify the code accordingly.
