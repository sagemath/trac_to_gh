This is now fixed and needs a doctest:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
sage: integrate(1/(sqrt(x)*((1+sqrt(x))^2)),x,1,9) 
integrate(1/((sqrt(x) + 1)^2*sqrt(x)), x, 1, 9) 
sage: integrate(1/(sqrt(x)*((1+sqrt(x))^2)),x) 
-2/(sqrt(x) + 1) 
sage:
