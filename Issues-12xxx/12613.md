unset SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES
```
wouldn't work since it would make SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES equal to !python.  So better set

```
SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES=x
```
or something.

Also, it conflicts with #12602.

Good point. Fixed.

Well, I didn't list #12602 as a prerequisite ;)   I'm attaching two versions of the patch, one which depends on #12602, and one which doesn't.  (I don't know if I'll be able to review #12602 any time soon, by the way.)
