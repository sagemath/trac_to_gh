```
We have

```
sage: AffineSpace(2, ZZ)(ZZ)
Set of rational points of Affine Space of dimension 2 over Integer Ring
```

but

```
sage: Spec(ZZ)(ZZ)
Point on Spectrum of Integer Ring defined by the Principal ideal (1) of Integer Ring
```

We should probably fix the Spec one to have the documented behavior (return the Set of ZZ-rational points).  Note of course that the current interpretation is completely wrong, since (1) is not a prime ideal of ZZ.  This is due to the prime ideal check being disabled by default (this is documented in a comment in the code).
