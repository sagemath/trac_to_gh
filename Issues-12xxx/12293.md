At first I thought this might have been unintended.  But 

```

        if format is None and isinstance(data, (int, Integer)):
            format = 'int'
        if format is None and data is None:
            format = 'int'
            data = 0
```
so apparently it is intentional.

There *is*

```

       One can very easily create a graph in Sage by typing:
    
          sage: g = Graph()
    
       By typing the name of the graph, one can get some basic information
       about it:
    
          sage: g
          Graph on 0 vertices
```
but that is not really documentation.  Good find.
