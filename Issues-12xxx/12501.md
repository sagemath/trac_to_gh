Some Sage packages want to run `autoconf`/`autoheader`/`automake` during installation.  This may fail, since `auto$foo` is not a prerequisite of Sage.  Usually, the build still works but in some cases, this may cause the build to fail (this happens for example with `ecm-6.3.p3` on the Skynet machine "iras").  This can usually be fixed by fixing timestamps and/or not patching `configure.in`, only `configure` itself.

Packages which need to be fixed:
* cddlib: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/cddlib-094f.p11.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/cddlib-094f.p11.spkg)
* ecm: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/ecm-6.3.p4.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/ecm-6.3.p4.spkg)

* libm4rie: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/libm4rie-20111004.p2.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/libm4rie-20111004.p2.spkg)
* maxima: upstream issue which can't easily be fixed, so we leave this alone
* mpfi: fixed by #12171
* pynac: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pynac-0.2.3.p1.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/spkg/pynac-0.2.3.p1.spkg)

For **reviewing**: please have a look below at the various diffs for the spkg's.  In some cases, it looks like nothing actually changed.  This is because I only changed a timestamp in the `src` directory.

Once this ticket is merged, the release management script should be changed to check for these issues (and whitelist maxima).
