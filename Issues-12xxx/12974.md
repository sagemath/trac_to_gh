```
The first patch makes all the `.__attribute` into `._attribute` so that the `Graphics` class can be inherited in the future. This is desirable since all the important functions are present in this class. One will not lose anything in terms of existing functionality.

The second patch does refactoring of one big bunch of code which is present twice in `Graphics().matplotlib()`.

The third and fourth patches are more of a 'cleanup' nature.

---
Since then the patches have been cleaned up themselves in various ways, see discussion.

**Apply** [attachment:12974_flat.patch] and [attachment:trac_12974-colorfix.patch].

1. I added the new file, where I don't reorder the arguments. Also, I ran the following sed expression (in zsh) to cleanup trailing whitespaces from `sage/plot`

```
....rc0/devel/sage/sage/plot» for i in **/*.py; do
 sed -i -e 's/[[:space:]]\+$//' "$i";
done
```

2. I removed the backslash and replaced it with simple brackets
3. I had also doctested the new matplotlib function, but it seems that went into the log plot code. Sorry for the mixup. The updated patch (the second patch) contains the doctest now.
4. From the doctests in #4529, I found that there were other functions outside of `sage/plot` that were using attributes of `Graphics` as `_Graphics__object`, etc. All these are fixed now (in the first patch).

Please don't do this, it can only lead to merge conflicts.  Removing whitespace from parts of the code which you edit is fine (even encouraged), but don't just remove all whitespace shotgun-style.

This needs to be rebased anyway, I'm going to add a new patch.
