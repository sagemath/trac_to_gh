```
The first patch makes all the `.__attribute` into `._attribute` so that the `Graphics` class can be inherited in the future. This is desirable since all the important functions are present in this class. One will not lose anything in terms of existing functionality.

The second patch does refactoring of one big bunch of code which is present twice in `Graphics().matplotlib()`.

The third and fourth patches are more of a 'cleanup' nature.

---
Since then the patches have been cleaned up themselves in various ways, see discussion.

In general this looks pretty good, good work on underscores and the refactor looks ok.  The Sage Days 40.5 crowd says "yes!" to making double underscores single underscores.

* Minor but should be done: get rid of backslashes ending lines.  Suggestion is to just enclose things in parentheses for splitting lines.
* You need to doctest your new matplotlib tick formatter.
* I'm not sure why you alphabetized some of the keywords in various places.  It might make more sense to keep ones together that are related - e.g., `vgridlinesstyle` and `hgridlinesstyle` should be next to each other.  I don't think this was an optimal change.

1. I added the new file, where I don't reorder the arguments. Also, I ran the following sed expression (in zsh) to cleanup trailing whitespaces from `sage/plot`

```
....rc0/devel/sage/sage/plot» for i in **/*.py; do
 sed -i -e 's/[[:space:]]\+$//' "$i";
done
```

2. I removed the backslash and replaced it with simple brackets
3. I had also doctested the new matplotlib function, but it seems that went into the log plot code. Sorry for the mixup. The updated patch (the second patch) contains the doctest now.
4. From the doctests in #4529, I found that there were other functions outside of `sage/plot` that were using attributes of `Graphics` as `_Graphics__object`, etc. All these are fixed now (in the first patch).

Please don't do this, it can only lead to merge conflicts.  Removing whitespace from parts of the code which you edit is fine (even encouraged), but don't just remove all whitespace shotgun-style.

I tried it on beta5 but it failed a couple of doctests. I will try again in a few days. I am traveling in a couple of hours so I can't install and test on beta6.

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx # 4 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/plot3d/texture.py # 2 doctests faile
        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/plot/colors.py # 12 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Timings have been updated.
Total time for all tests: 232.5 seconds
