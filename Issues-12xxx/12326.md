From [this ask.sagemath.org answer](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/703/combine-sage-plot-with-matplotlib?answer=1734#1734), an interesting sort of example (maybe could be spruced a little) which could be useful in the documentation for plotting.

```
#make some graphs
x=var('x')
g=plot(sin(x))
g_ins=plot(cos(x))
# plot main figure
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
figure = Figure()
main_plot = figure.add_axes((0.2,0.2,0.7,0.7))
g.matplotlib('a.svg', figure=figure, sub=main_plot)
# plot an inset
inset = figure.add_axes((0.6,0.2,0.3,0.3))
g_ins.matplotlib('a.svg', figure=figure, sub=inset)
# display graph (note that only single sage Graphics object has to be saved )
g_ins.save('a.svg', figure=figure, sub=inset)
UPD: if figures are drawn strangely, add
aspect_ratio='automatic'
to matplotlib() parameters. By default it is 1.0, which may be undesired.
Also, you may want to draw the figure itself, not by Graphics().save() function. Replace the last line with the following:
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg
figure.set_canvas(FigureCanvasAgg(figure)) 
figure.savefig('a.svg')
```

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

apparently this shows how to plot using matplotlib a graph made with Sage plot command.
I'm looking for the other way round: plot with Sage a matplotlib graphics (for example made by
the pylab.imshow command).
