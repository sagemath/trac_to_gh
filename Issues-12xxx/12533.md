There is currently no arbitrary precision LP solver backend available. It is sorely missed in some coding theory -related LP computations, see  #12418.

One option is to hook up [PPL](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/libs/ppl.html), another might be to hook up GLPK for this purpose. Both have the corresponding functionality, it's just not exposed (?) in P(C)ython for GLPK, and not hooked up as an LP backend in case of PPL.

To try this patch, **apply** [attachment: trac_12533_arbitrary_precision_LP_solver_backend_for_5.3_vb.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12533/trac_12533_arbitrary_precision_LP_solver_backend_for_5.3_vb.patch.gz)

The PPL Cython wrapper should be fully functional for LP solving, its just providing a different interface than the `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`. I always wanted to have this more integrated but I don't have to solve plain LP's often (at least not in that language).

A new `MixedIntegerLinearProgram `with `PPL `as solver can be gotten by setting the `solver `parameter in `MixedIntegerLinearProgramming`'s constructor to `"PPL"`, e.g. `MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver = "PPL")`

The additional feature of this backend is, it supports arbitrary precision calculations. We can get the exact optimal value by setting the `exact `parameter in `solve `method to `True`, i.e. `p.solve(exact = True)`.

Wow !!! Amazing patch !! `O_o`

Should this ticket be in "needs_review" state now ?

I have not looked deeply into your patch (well, your comment was posted 10 minutes ago `:-P`) and besides my 'Wow-Impressive Work" comment I had a question to ask : is PPL an optional package ? Some parts of your code behave as if it were 

```
 	865	    elif solver == "PPL": 
 	866	        try: 
 	867	            from sage.numerical.backends.ppl_backend import PPLBackend 
 	868	            default_solver = solver 
 	869	        except ImportError: 
 	870	            raise ValueError("PPL is not available. Please refer to the documentation to install it.") 
```
But the line you added in module_list.py makes me think it is standard. Also, that line :

```
for s in ["CPLEX", "GUROBI", "Coin", "GLPK", "PPL"]: 
```
has no meaning : Sage tries to find the first solver available on the machine, and GLPK is always available. Many of your methods need to be doctested and/or documented. The comments `# optional - Nonexistent_LP_solver` should also be replaced either by `#optional - PPL` if PPL is optional, and plainly removed otherwise.

Wow. Impressive work `:-)`
I hope I will be able to expose the GLPK function too at some point so that we would have some way to compare the results... But Wow... `:-)`

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment%3A4):

>  	865	    elif solver == "PPL": 

indeed, PPL is a standard package now (I guess this check for its availability stems from some early code, when
it wasn't standard). So this check should be removed.

Then, it needs an example where one can see the benefit of the arbitrary precision (already an example with 2 variables
should do). The example I got from the author (Hi, Risan!). I modified the last line, as it was following an old design:

```
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver = "PPL")
x = p.new_variable()
n = 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
p.set_objective(10 * n * x[1] + 50 * n * x[2])
p.add_constraint(10 * n * x[1] + 2 * n * x[2], max = 40 * n)
p.add_constraint(15 * n * x[1] + 30 * n * x[2], max = 40 * n)
print p.solve()
print p.solve(exact=True)
```
is probably good enough. 

Lastly, the parameter `as_vector` should be set to `False` by default, not to `True`, to be consistent with the 
other LP interfaces.

Hi Mr. Nathann and Prof. Dima,

Thank you!

I have finished the documentation. In addition, I have removed the redundant codes and setting the as_vector to False by default (and also fixing some bugs). In the attachment is the latest version of it.

Now, the status was changed to Need Review.

Thank you

I add a brief look at the code, and I found some functions always returning True or always False in `ppl_backend.pyx`. I suppose it is because current version is still in devel phase (indeed it's a lot of work).

Also, you could mention somewhere that PPL does not provide access to dual variables (my understanding from the documentation).

Nice work.

yeah, OK, indeed, I forgot...

By the way, IMHO the following doctest (in ppl.pyx) won't fly:

```
 	535	            sage: MIP_Problem(0) 
 	536	            <sage.libs.ppl.MIP_Problem object at 0x7fae10fab5b8> 
```
looks very dodgy.

Hello,

I can install the patch on sage-5.0.beta8 and all long tests are OK (all involved files).
The documentation is build correctly and displayed properly.

However, I did some test based on the example of the `optimizing_point` function and got a segfault... 

```
sage: from sage.libs.ppl import Variable, Constraint_System, MIP_Problem 
sage: x = Variable(0) 
sage: y = Variable(1) 
sage: m = MIP_Problem() 
sage: m.add_space_dimensions_and_embed(2) 
sage: m.add_constraint(x >= 0) 
sage: m.add_constraint(y >= 0) 
sage: m.add_constraint(3 * x + 5 * y <= 10) 
sage: m.set_objective_function(x + y) 
sage: m.optimizing_point() 
[10/3, 0] 
sage: z = Variable(2)
sage: m.add_constraint(z >= -3)
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::invalid_argument'
  what():  PPL::MIP_Problem::add_constraint(c):
c.space_dimension() == 3 exceeds this->space_dimension == 2.
...
/path-to-sage/sage-5.0.beta8/spkg/bin/sage: line 308: 29045 Aborted                 (core dumped) sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

Some tests should be added somewhere.

This will be a great patch!

Hi, thanks for your feedback!

It is actually not a bug. The statement "m.add_space_dimensions_and_embed(2)" increases the space dimension of the MIP_Problem from 0 (default) to 2. However, z is a variable in the third dimension (the number 2 in "z = Variable(2)" means the dimension of this variable is 2, which means it is in the third dimension since the numbering starts from zero). Since the dimension of the variable exceeds the space dimension of the MIP_Problem, it gives error.

An extra line should be added to make it works:
sage: z = Variable(2)
sage: m.add_space_dimensions_and_embed(1)
sage: m.add_constraint(z >= -3)

> This will be a great patch!

Thank you!

It's not only giving an error, it crashed my sage session.

Wouldn't it be possible to add some test to prevent such behavior? I think it would be much smarter than a crash.

I see. Yes, it is indeed troublesome. Now I realize that I also have not given enough exception handling in many other parts. I will fix them.

Its a bit tricky because the `PPL_Generator` C++ class has a private ctor and declaring Cython exceptions while returning a const reference has a bug. I'm pretty sure we need to copy the returned `PPL_Generator` in `optimize_point` and other functions.

Also, can we make `optimize_point` return a PPL point and not a list of gmp rationals? We needlessly deviate from the PPL api here.

Attachment: **[trac_12533_catch_ppl_exception.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12533/trac_12533_catch_ppl_exception.patch.gz)**

I've added a patch that catches the C++ exceptions and shows how to work around Cython/C++ issues in `optimizing_point()`.

Things that need to be done:
* `MIP_Problem` should derive from `_mutable_or_immutable` just like the polyhedron class. All mutating methods need to check that the `MIP_Problem` is mutable.
* Doctests should be added for all caught C++ exceptions (see PPL documentation for which methods can raise exceptions)

We only have `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`, but no `LinearProgram`, right?
While the latter might be a meaningful addition, it is certainly beyond the scope of this ticket, I think...

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment%3A24):

> Helloooooooo Risan !!!

Hi Mr. Nathann
> I just went over your patch, and some comments follow. Thank you very much for the work you put into that ! `:-)`

Thank you for your review.
> **ppl.pyx**
> * MIP_Problem : PPL can only solve continuous Linear Programs, can't it ? In this case why "MIP_*", unless it means something different from "Mixed Integer Program" ?

It was named MIP_Problem simply because it is derived from MIP_Problem class in PPL. Since this functionality belongs to PPL, I left the name unchanged.
> * MIP_Problem.optimization_mode() prints something but does not return anything

Fixed. Now it returns a string.
> * MIP_Problem returns dictionaries : in MixedIntegerLinearProgram  we raise an exception for unbounded/infeasible problems, and return the objective's value otherwise. Just mentionning it in case you may like it, of course that's totally up to you ! I still think it would be easier to return, for instance, a string (unbounded/infeasible) when the problem has no solution, and the result otherwise.

Fixed. Now it raises an error (ValueError) when the problem has no solution. I think it is more consistent to the PPL MIP_Problem now.
> * optimal_value does not only return the objective value, it also solves the problem ! I think the docstring should be updated --> if the users calls this function several times, are the computations made over and over ?

Fixed. It does not solve the problem now.
> * optimization_mode and set_optimization_mode : we often do both in a unique function, i.e. a method with optional arguments such that optimization_mode() returns the mode and optimization_mode(-1) defines it as a minimization problem. I just noticed that it was not the case at all for MixedIntegerLinearProgram  methods, but I think we ought to change that :-)

This is made to be consistent with the implementation in PPL. In PPL, they used optimization_mode() and set_optimization_mode() instead of one function only :)
> * is_satisfiable : does it also solve the problem ? I mean, if users type "if p.is_satisfiable(): a = p.optimal_value()" does it solve it twice ? The docstrings should say something about that.

The is_satisfiable in my wrapper wraps exactly the is_satisfiable of PPL. After looking at the PPL implementation of this function, I guess it does not solve the problem.
> * what is the difference between optimal_value and evaluate_objective_function ? In particular the code seems to be pretty similar, so one function should probably call the other if two are necessary

Evaluate objective function return the evaluation of objective function on a given point (the parameter of the function). The optimal_value return the evaluation of objective function on the optimal solution.
> * OK : by looking at the docstring I have no idea what it does or what the invariants are, but of course it may also be that I am not part of the intended audience for this class

I think it was used for debugging (I'm not really sure too).
> **sage/libs/ppl_ files**
> * Are these files part of the ppl spkg ? If so they should not be modified by a patch, and the spkg itself should be updated.. That's really a lot of work for nothing, but that's how things are done here until we change it `:-/`

The files pp_shim.cc and ppl_shim.hh are created by vbraun (cmiiw), I actually don't have any idea about them.
> **mip.pyx**
> * Why would you have to add anything to get_values and solve ? The flags you add would create problems instantly if the backend solver is not PPL !! I think nothing needs to be changed in that file --> if the backend is ppl then the values returned will be exact, otherwise they will just be the usual ones. But I do not see why these functions should be changed `O_o`

Thanks, I have changed this part. No additional flags needed anymore.
> **ppl_backend.pyx**
> * All functions should be documented/tested, even 'cutsom ones' like  print_data . Actually  sage -coverage <filename>  should never have to complain `:-)`

oops, print_data is debugging function. I forgot to delete it. Now I have deleted it.
> * same thing with init_mip

It is documented now.
> * add_variable[s] say that the variable are positive by default. Are they indeed ?

Yes. They are. The lower_bound is set to 0.0 by default.
> * "set_variable_type" -- I think the best is for this method's code to be something like "raise Exception('This backend does not handle integer variables ! Read the doc !')"

Fixed.
> * why do you keep "exact" in the names of your get_values functions ? It would be easier to name then get_values, as anyway all the values given by the ppl interface are exact ?!

Fixed.
> **Others**
> * Is ppl.pyx part of the documentation ? At least ppl_backend is not, so you should add it to doc/en/reference/numerical.rst
> * Some "advertisement" should be added to the doc. In many places the solvers are listed (ok, perhaps we should only list them at *one* place), so that users can find out that *exact* answer are returned when the solver is ppl

ok. I'm still working on them and I will update it later.
> * Variables : are they automatically strictly positive ? This is the default in the MIP class (because it is the default of the API we interface), and if PPL acts any differently this would mean that results would be different according to whether PPL or GLPK is used as a backend !

This is from GenericBackend (and PPL Backend inherits from it) class:
"cpdef int add_variable(self, lower_bound=0.0, ..."
I think the variables are non-negative by default.
> * The patch *does not apply* on 5.0-rc1, so I can not even check whether tests pass !
> Thank you again `:-)`
> Nathann

Thanks a lot again, Mr. Nathann :)

Hello Mister Risan !!

> It was named MIP_Problem simply because it is derived from MIP_Problem class in PPL. Since this functionality belongs to PPL, I left the name unchanged.

Oh. Then do you mean that PPL can solve integer programs too ? `O_o`
If its name is MIP_problem, I guess it can... Well, why don't we expose it then ???

> > * is_satisfiable : does it also solve the problem ? I mean, if users type "if p.is_satisfiable(): a = p.optimal_value()" does it solve it twice ? The docstrings should say something about that.

Hmmmm.. I would be surprised if it were easier to check that the problem is satisfiable than to actually solve it. `O_o`.
But then again, I am often surprised.

> Evaluate objective function return the evaluation of objective function on a given point (the parameter of the function). The optimal_value return the evaluation of objective function on the optimal solution.

Right. I do not know what I could do with evaluate_objective_function, but if you think that it is useful...

Well, then... What about removing it from the patch ?...

> > **sage/libs/ppl_ files**

> The files pp_shim.cc and ppl_shim.hh are created by vbraun (cmiiw), I actually don't have any idea about them.

Ok, they seem to be included in Sage's source code, so it is actually ok to modify them

> > * Why would you have to add anything to get_values and solve ? The flags you add would create problems instantly if the backend solver is not PPL !!

> Thanks, I have changed this part. No additional flags needed anymore.

Well. I saw that you now have two functions doing exactly the same thing following each other in the file : get_variable_value and get_exact_variable_value. As they seem to do the same thing (tell me if I am wrong) it should only appear once. If you want to have both available, one can be made to be a shortcut toward the other by typing in the code 
get_exact_variable_value = get_variable_value
But why would you want to have both available ?
In particular, why do you still modify the file mip.pyx ? As the function get_variable_value exists, there is no need to test whether the ppl solver is being used, or to have an ``exact`` variable, or to add things like that to the code :

```
import sys 
from sage.all import * 
```

> > **ppl_backend.pyx**

about documentation : I just remembered that you should also add a mention of ppl in the file doc/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.rst near the other solvers.

> > * "set_variable_type" -- I think the best is for this method's code to be something like "raise Exception('This backend does not handle integer variables ! Read the doc !')"

Well... But it the solver actually supports integer variables...

Well... This is not done in your new patch.

Hmm, after checking this again, I think it is not just for debugging purpose. For example: The MIP_Problem constructor will accept any kind of constraints (including strict inequalities which violate the invariants). However, there is no checking for this in the constructor, that is why the OK() can be used to check this.

I have changed the get_variable_value to raise notimplementederror. The reason I made new functions (get_exact_*) is because in generic_backend, the return type of get_variable_value and get_objective_value are fixed to be double. Since PPLBackend inherits these methods from GenericBackend, the implementations of them inside PPLBackend should return doubles too... except if I modify the GenericBackend class (change cdef double get_... to cdef get_...). What do you think?

Generally speaking, looks good! There are a few nitpicks:

In #12553, I modified the PPL classes to derive from `SageObject`. This'll make it play nicer with the rest of Sage. Correspondingly you should override `_repr_`, not `__repr__`. Also needs to dump the actual information of the `MIP_problem` or its useless in other doctests. Speaking of which, the method needs a doctest. Also, in English you'd say "A MIP" not "An MIP", but really the output should be more specific.

All expensive operations (that need to solve a LP, say) must be wrapped in `sig_on/sig_off` blocks. Be careful with exceptions thrown, use try/finally if necessary. Otherwise you'll get into expensive but untinterruptable computations...

Can we have a few less empty lines? No need for an empty line before and after the """ closing the docstring.

The INPUT: section should be formatted like

```
  - ``number`` (integer) -- description.
```
You often have only a single "-" between type and description.

Coverage should be 100%:

Finally, the ticket description should say which patch to apply for the sanity of the release manager.

Also, `ptrrsn_1` should put his name on the trac author list (http://trac.sagemath.org) and populate the Author: field on the ticket.

Hi,

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A47):

Could you explain what is the difference between them? I could not find any information about _repr_.

> Also needs to dump the actual information of the `MIP_problem` or its useless in other doctests. Speaking of which, the method needs a doctest. Also, in English you'd say "A MIP" not "An MIP", but really the output should be more specific.

Ok, I have changed it. However, it is still not very specific because I could not get the constraint system information from the actual PPL object. There is constraints_begin() and constraints_end() methods in the actual PPL's MIP_Problem. However, I am not sure how to use them (they are const_iterators).

Ok, I have fixed this.

Ok, I have changed the GenericBackend and also GLPK Backend a bit to accomodate this. Now, we have only get_variable_value and get_objective_value.

I think Volker's #12553 depends on a slew of tickets that won't make it into 5.1. I'd like this to be kept for a later ticket than for now.

That's terrific!

I understand that you also took care of 12533-fix_min_max.

Everything in Sage should derive from `SageObject`. See http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_python.html#print-representation for more about the use of `_repr_`. The `SageObject` defines the double underscore methods (`__repr__`, a Python special method) and will try to dispatch them to the single-underscore  
version (`_repr_`, a Sage convention).

well, #12553 depends on so many patches that I got lost applying all of them manually. There should be a better way of dealing with this, say, putting the whole thing on github or bitbucket. 
It also depends upon a lot of patches that look too far from my areas of competence to have any say upon.
In particular, #12553 depends upon 

```
#11310 - Monkey-patch catchall `except:`
```
which is ear-marked `sage-pending`. By asking this ticket to depend upon #12553, you are effectively relegating it to `sage-pending`, aren't you?

The coefficients are currently only converted to the base ring if the coercion system is required. For example:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = p.new_variable()
sage: x[1] - x[0]    # no coercion addition and negation only
x_0 -1 x_1
sage: 2 * x[1]       # ZZ(2) is coerced into the coefficient ring
2.0 x_0
```
It would be more consistent if coefficients were always converted into the base ring, but that would definitely require cooperation from the backends.

But here RDF is the wrong ring to convert to. With your latest patch I get:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver='ppl')
sage: x = p.new_variable()
sage: 2 * x[1]
2.0 x_0

```
which breaks the ppl backend, as 2.0 is RDF. How one is supposed to enter the system without the (wrong) conversion?

It would help a lot if you at least outline the functionality you need in backends to make this work properly in some detail.

To get the whole chain of patches right, apply #13646, then the current ticket (#12533), then #13650.
Eventually, #12091 (when it's ready).

This is all for Sage 5.4.rc2.
