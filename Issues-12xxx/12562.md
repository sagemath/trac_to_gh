The **Sun assembler** chokes when large files are sent to it via a pipe.  Singular by default builds with the -pipe option causing trouble.

In the spkg below, I also add a fix for #12311.

Jeroen, in case Dave doesn't have time, do you have suggestions about how to test this?  On the skynet machine mark, I can try setting the path so that it uses

```

<a id='comment:7'></a>Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A6):

No, the assembler/linker executables are hardcoded when GCC is compiled.  You can see this by:

```
jdemeyer@mark:~$ gcc -print-prog-name=as
/usr/local/binutils-2.20.1/sparc-SunOS-ultrasparc3-gcc-4.4.3/bin/as
```
This means that gcc will always use that assembler, which is the GNU assembler:

```
jdemeyer@mark:~$ /usr/local/binutils-2.20.1/sparc-SunOS-ultrasparc3-gcc-4.4.3/bin/as --version
GNU assembler (GNU Binutils) 2.20.1.20100303
Copyright 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This program is free software; you may redistribute it under the terms of
the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.
This program has absolutely no warranty.
This assembler was configured for a target of `sparc-sun-solaris2.10'.
```

I encountered the problem on this ticket while testing #12369.  The default `as` in the PATH is

```
jdemeyer@mark:~$ which as
/usr/ccs/bin/as
jdemeyer@mark:~$ as -V
as: Sun Compiler Common 10 Patch 05/06/2005
```

So, when compiling GCC, that assembler will be used by default.  This can be overridden using the `AS` environment variable (similarly `LD` for the linker).
