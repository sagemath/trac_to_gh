The **Sun assembler** chokes when large files are sent to it via a pipe.  Singular by default builds with the -pipe option causing trouble.

In the spkg below, I also add a fix for #12311.

The change here makes sense, although I don't remember seeing a problem with singular on Solaris before. This builds on one OpenSolaris machine, and I'm currently building it on a (slow) Solaris machine. It also works on OS X (as tested in #12369).

No, the assembler/linker executables are hardcoded when GCC is compiled.  You can see this by:

```
jdemeyer@mark:~$ gcc -print-prog-name=as
/usr/local/binutils-2.20.1/sparc-SunOS-ultrasparc3-gcc-4.4.3/bin/as
```
This means that gcc will always use that assembler, which is the GNU assembler:

```
jdemeyer@mark:~$ /usr/local/binutils-2.20.1/sparc-SunOS-ultrasparc3-gcc-4.4.3/bin/as --version
GNU assembler (GNU Binutils) 2.20.1.20100303
Copyright 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This program is free software; you may redistribute it under the terms of
the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.
This program has absolutely no warranty.
This assembler was configured for a target of `sparc-sun-solaris2.10'.
```

I encountered the problem on this ticket while testing #12369.  The default `as` in the PATH is

```
jdemeyer@mark:~$ which as
/usr/ccs/bin/as
jdemeyer@mark:~$ as -V
as: Sun Compiler Common 10 Patch 05/06/2005
```

So, when compiling GCC, that assembler will be used by default.  This can be overridden using the `AS` environment variable (similarly `LD` for the linker).

On hawk (OpenSolaris on x86), after installing beta7 from #12369 with `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=yes`, and while running `sage -sh`:

```
$ gcc -print-prog-name=as
/usr/ccs/bin/as
```
Then singular-3-1-3-3.p4 fails to build, while singular-3-1-3-3.p5 succeeds. 

I'm also trying on mark, and things there are a little strange: on one hand, the Sage built took only two hours, which is much faster than usual -- an earlier build took 12 hours. Either they upgraded the machine, or the standard gcc build on mark is badly configured, or something else is strange. Tests seem to be going fine (with the Singular spkg from this ticket). On the other hand, if I just try to run Sage, I see this:

```
$ ./sage

The issues with mark seem to have cleared themselves up somehow. My findings:

- With hawk, the spkg here builds while the old one doesn't.

- With mark and mark2 (Solaris on sparc), both seem to build.

So I think this can get a positive review.
