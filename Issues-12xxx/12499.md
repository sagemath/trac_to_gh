The implementation of the density method for a sparse matrix is insane.  It loops through every single index possible and asks if each entry is zero or nonzero:

```
sage: A=matrix(5000,5000,{(1,2): 1})
sage: A.density()
1/25000000
```

An implementation that instead relied on `A.nonzero_positions()` would be orders of magnitude faster.

Thanks for the idea. An implementation is in [attachment:trac_12499-faster-sparse-matrix-density.patch]. It passes all doctests in `devel/sage/sage/matrix`.

> An implementation that instead relied on `A.nonzero_positions()` would be orders of magnitude faster.


The *orders of magnitude* turns out to be `10^7` (or 1 billion % in market-speak ;)) for the above example:

```
sage: A=matrix(5000,5000,{(1,2): 1})
sage: timeit('A.density()')
5 loops, best of 3: 11.3 s per loop
sage: timeit('QQ(len(A.nonzero_positions()))/QQ(A.nrows()*A.ncols())')
625 loops, best of 3: 15.6 µs per loop
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>I think we can improve this further, especially for denser matrices, by adding copy=False:

```

sage: A = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 5000,sparse=True).random_element(density=0.02)
sage: A
5000 x 5000 sparse matrix over Integer Ring (type 'print A.str()' to see all of the entries)
sage: %timeit QQ(len(A.nonzero_positions()))/(QQ(A.nrows()*A.ncols()))        
25 loops, best of 3: 16.5 ms per loop
sage: %timeit QQ(len(A.nonzero_positions(copy=False)))/QQ(A.nrows()*A.ncols())
625 loops, best of 3: 14.3 µs per loop
sage: %timeit QQ(len(A.nonzero_positions(copy=False)))/(A.nrows()*A.ncols())  
625 loops, best of 3: 13.3 µs per loop
```

Removing the second QQ is a micro-optimization but buys you a little..

Thanks a lot! I am not so familiar with the matrix code. The patch has been updated.
