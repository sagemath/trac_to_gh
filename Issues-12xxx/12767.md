Touching all files in sage/rings/number_field and running ` sage -docbuild --warn-links reference html` reveals a bunch of errors:

```

```

The patch below fixes these. It also sorts out a genuine bug I spotted in the process (the `maximal_order` method of relative number fields doesn't have an option to return a p-maximal order).

  is it possible that the first one is not supposed to have the `[v]`?

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hi,

The new code looks fine, though the new v option should be documented in the docstring:

```

        INPUT:
       
        -  ``v`` - (default: None) None, a prime, or a list of
           primes.

           - if v is None, return the maximal order.

           - if v is a prime, return an order that is p-maximal.

           - if v is a list, return an order that is maximal at each
             prime in the list v.
```

So if somebody adds the above to the docstring, then we should give this a positive review.
