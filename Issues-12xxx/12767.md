Touching all files in sage/rings/number_field and running ` sage -docbuild --warn-links reference html` reveals a bunch of errors:

```
<autodoc>:1: WARNING: py:class reference target not found: sage.categories.map.Map

```

The patch below fixes these. It also sorts out a genuine bug I spotted in the process (the `maximal_order` method of relative number fields doesn't have an option to return a p-maximal order).

Comments:
* I can't give the new code itself positive review, although it seems correct (mostly I have questions about the change to `absolute_degree`.  Maybe that could be moved to a different ticket if one doesn't find a reviewer?
* I can, however, suggest a trivial fix - the second-to-last line below had `new_codomain`, not `new_domain` (I'd add a patch, but see the previous comment):

```
    def extend_domain(self, new_domain):
        r"""
        INPUT:
 
        - ``self`` -- a member of Hom(Y, Z)
        - ``new_domain`` -- an object X such that there is a canonical coercion
          `\phi` in Hom(X, Y)
```
  Also, maybe we want to just turn that double-underscore attribute into a single-underscore attribute?  Here at SD 40.5 that is being suggested strongly for any occurrences of such things.
* In the nearly identical two occurrences of 

```
self.__maximal_order[v] = RelativeOrder(self, abs_order, is_maximal=True, check=False)
```
  is it possible that the first one is not supposed to have the `[v]`?

Hi,

The new code looks fine, though the new v option should be documented in the docstring:

```

        INPUT:
       
        -  ``v`` - (default: None) None, a prime, or a list of
           primes.

           - if v is None, return the maximal order.

           - if v is a prime, return an order that is p-maximal.

           - if v is a list, return an order that is maximal at each
             prime in the list v.
```

So if somebody adds the above to the docstring, then we should give this a positive review.
