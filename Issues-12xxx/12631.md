The script `spkg/base/dir-0.1-install` does so little that it can easily be merged inside `spkg/install`.

Also, remove the file `spkg/base/README.txt` which talks about bzip2 (which is now an ordinary spkg, see #12102).

The problem is that I can't be entirely sure which parts of Sage require "$SAGE_ROOT/tmp".  I think it is safer to just create it from the beginning.
