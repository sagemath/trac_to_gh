Currently when a symbolic function (e.g. gamma(), exp(), sin()) gets a python float, it passes it off to ginac, and let's ginac evaluate it. This can be very slow, e.g.:

```
sage: timeit('exp(6.0r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 476 µs per loop
```
This also leads to possibly undesirable inconsistencies across different platforms: for example, ginac ends up calling the local libc tgammal to evaluate the gamma function, and even when this tgammal is evaluated by the same version of eglibc on two different platforms the answer varies depending on whether 80 bit doubles are available.

To fix this, we make Sage check its types which correspond most closely to python type for the function that should be called, and use the functions for those types if available.

Now we have

```
sage: timeit('exp(6.0r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.02 µs per loop
```
For the specific case of the gamma function, the is also a change here to make RDF use python's math.gamma(). It is more accurate than gsl. It is perhaps not as accurate as eglibc's gamma(), but it should give reliable results on different platforms.

I think this will fix 3 of the 4 failing numerical accuracy doctests on ARM, though the test for binomial(.5r, 5) had to be weakened slightly.  (see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/3c8c61ea113ea60c ) binomial() is currently not computed in a very good way, though, so it is reasonable to weaken this test temporarily. (see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12448 )

Finally, I'll remark that these improvements could probably be much better. The above timings should be compared to

```
sage: timeit('math.exp(6.0r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 112 ns per loop
```

Thanks for the patch. I agree that considering float and complex types separately in the fast evaluation path makes sense for speed. However, this causes inconsistencies with the results you get when a value is substituted into the expression.

We still need to modify the `py_tgamma()` function in `sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx` to fix this:

```
sage: gamma(x).subs(x=6.r)          
120.0
```

AFAICT (without applying the patch and testing), attachment:12449.patch removes the `try/except` block around `return getattr(args[0], self._name)()`, disabling the call to `BuiltinFunction.__call__` later on in the function body.

This would be a good occasion to merge my patch from attachment:trac_1173-move_call.patch:ticket:1173. I'll try to rebase your patch on top of that.

For the gamma function, at least, python has its own implementation. Of course, that function itself might call some underlying libc functions, so maybe it won't be entirely consistent, now that I think about it.

In the bit of testing that I did, math.gamma was less accurate than tgammal on my computer, but much more accurate than gsl's gamma function.

It turns out that Python implements the gamma function itself:

http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/58bd6a58365d/Modules/mathmodule.c#l226

I uploaded a new patch that changes `py_tgamma()` in `sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx` to use Python's gamma implementation.

I give a positive review to attachment:12449.patch. If someone can review my patch we can switch this to positive review.

BTW, this will fix #9162. We should close that as a duplicate.

I've attached a patch rebased to 5.0-beta5. I had no problem applying the patches, so I just made sure all tests still pass.

Maybe I should just go ahead and put it back to positive review, but I'll give Burcin a day or so to take a look at it.

Three remarks:
1. that test is also one that is failing on ARM ; and there's a trac ticket about binomial's implementation being pretty wrong (#12448).
2. should that test use "#tol abs" instead of doing the computation itself?
3. shouldn't it be even a "#tol rel" ?

Obviously the following comment doesn't apply then:

```
# It is more accurate than gsl's gamma function and 
# should provide consistant results across platforms.
