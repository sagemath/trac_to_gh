with Sage 4.8 I get:

```
sage: U.<x,y> = GF(2)[]  
sage: factor(x^6 + y^5 + x^5 + y^4,proof=False)
/usr/local/sage-4.8-linux-64bit-ubuntu_10.04.3_lts-x86_64-Linux/local/lib/libcsage.so(print_backtrace+0x31)[0x2b670685e3a3]
...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.
