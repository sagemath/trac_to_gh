```
sage: search_src('polymake')
```
reveals many tests marked `# optional: needs polymake`.
These will *NOT* get run by doing

```
sage -t -only_optional=polymake geometry/polytope.py
```

They should be formatted as

```
#optional - polymake
```

By the way, this test works fine without polymake is installed, because it doesn't do anything, so improve that by adding another test right after this that actually exercise the optional package.

```
sage: P = polymake.convex_hull([[1,0,0,0], [1,0,0,1], [1,0,1,0], [1,0,1,1],  [1,1,0,0], [1,1,0,1], [1,1,1,0], [1,1,1,1]])
```
