```
sage: search_src('polymake')
```
reveals many tests marked `# optional: needs polymake`.
These will *NOT* get run by doing

```
sage -t -only_optional=polymake geometry/polytope.py
```

They should be formatted as

```
#optional - polymake
```

By the way, this test works fine without polymake is installed, because it doesn't do anything, so improve that by adding another test right after this that actually exercise the optional package.

```
sage: P = polymake.convex_hull([[1,0,0,0], [1,0,0,1], [1,0,1,0], [1,0,1,1],  [1,1,0,0], [1,1,0,1], [1,1,1,0], [1,1,1,1]])
```

By the way, this code is from my commit 271, i.e., ancient history, before there was an infrastructure for how optional package tests worked.  But it would be good to update this.

I could add doctests to a bunch of functions here, but I can't get the the polymake spkg to build on pretty much any platform, see #5488. But in the meantime, the attached patch corrects the optional doctests.
