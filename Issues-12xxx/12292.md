```
When the characteristic polynomial of a given matrix is computed for
two different variables, the computation is done once again:

```
sage: A=random_matrix(ZZ,100)
sage: time p1=A.charpoly('x')
Time: CPU 0.25 s, Wall: 0.28 s
sage: time p2=A.charpoly('x')
Time: CPU 0.00 s, Wall: 0.00 s
sage: time p3=A.charpoly('y')
Time: CPU 0.25 s, Wall: 0.29 s
sage: p1.subs(x=y) - p3
0
```
We see that the computation of p2 is immediate since it was cached
for the variable x, but that of p3 is not, since the code searches for a cached charpoly with the variable y! It would suffice to search a cached charpoly for any variable, and substitute that variable.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Here's a patch that fixes the issue.

The timing doctests are of dubious value, and I'm not against removing them entirely since they aren't deterministic. They may help with review, though -- each one exercises the correct charpoly method.

Once we're sure the code is correct, they can go, or get fixed (I don't have any good ideas).

Also there is a tiny typo in the patch: `indepenedent` should be `independent` (five times). Also I'm not sure about the comment:

```

Shouldn't it be #6442 instead?

That comment about the cached charpoly is a modification of what I said in the patch for #6442. It no longer made sense, since I got rid of the dictionary.

<a id='comment:6'></a>A few comments from Review Days:

1.  For a matrix A, you can examine A._cache directly.  Instead of doing timings, might it be better to check the cached value before and after the second request (the one with a new variable specified)?  A return value with the new variable and a cached value with the original variable would strike me as sufficient evidence, and superior to using timings in a doctest.
2.  In poking around with this it appears that the algorithm name is part of the cache key in some instances, while there are places (eg determinant computations) that just check for the "charpoly" cache key.
3.  Applies on 5.0-beta8, FWIW.

```
sage: A = random_matrix(QQ, 3)
sage: A.charpoly()

sage: A._cache

<a id='comment:7'></a>I agree with item 1 from comment [comment:6], but in Sage 4.8:

```

sage: A._cache

sage: A.charpoly('t')
t^3 + t^2 + 5/4*t + 1/2
sage: A._cache
{'clear_denom': ([-1  2  0]
[-2  0  0]

```
thus calling `A._cache['charpoly_linbox']` might not be enough.
