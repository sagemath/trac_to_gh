Reviewed, seems good. Added a check for having no y term in the expression. Was previously an uncaught `DivideByZero`, while code now gives a more informative error.
Was my first review, would appreciate to know whether I'm actually being any help!

All the variables defined in the function are local. They do not get mixed with the global variables with the same name. You can even call the function with xx and yy as parameters, and they will  not be mixed with the local xx and yy.

```
sage: var('x,y')
(x, y)
sage: implicit_derivative(y,x,y*x/cos(x+y))
-(x*y*sin(x + y)/cos(x + y)^2 + y/cos(x + y))/(x*y*sin(x + y)/cos(x + y)^2 + x/cos(x + y))
sage: var('xx,yy')
(xx, yy)
sage: implicit_derivative(yy,xx,yy*xx/cos(xx+yy))
-(xx*yy*sin(xx + yy)/cos(xx + yy)^2 + yy/cos(xx + yy))/(xx*yy*sin(xx + yy)/cos(xx + yy)^2 + xx/cos(xx + yy))
```

About writing this as a method for symbolic expressions... that was my first idea; but i prefeared this aproach, due to the fact that you are actually not  diferentiating the symbolic expression, but a function defined implicitely by the symbolic expression. So it seemed more natural to me this kind of syntax.

Calling `var` or `SR.symbol('somename')` even locally does add to the `pynac_symbol_registry`, yet calling `SR.symbol()` with no argument will create a temporary variable that will not be added to this registry. Possibly adding to the registry may cause problems if it is being referenced directly for some reason. Maybe worth just using `x = SR.symbol()` etc?

I can't think of a way to make this work without the said side effect.

Messing with the symbol registry this way is really not a good idea. That is just supposed to be internal data.

What if there is an exception in that code and the registry is not restored?

What exactly is the problem with using temporary variables? Looking briefly at the patch, it looks like we also need temporary functions.

I don't know why, this problem is not present if we put the strings in the definitions of the variables.

It looks like the substitution doesn't work at some point.

Looking at the code...

The calls `y.diff(x,i+1)(x=x)` and `f.diff(x,i,yy,j)(x=x,yy=y)` rely on the name of the variable. You should use a dictionary argument to `.subs()`.

BTW, the `subs_expr()` method will go away at some point. Why not just use `.subs()` everywhere?

Before this gets switched to positive review, we should check how it behaves if there already is a symbolic function defined with a custom method for evaluation named `y` or `f`.

Why is this not a method of symbolic expressions? Isn't it inconsistent to have the functional notation supported but not a class method?

I will try to work on it.\n\nAs i said, the reason why it is not a method is that it is not clear to me what class should it be in. \n\nIs this a method of the expression F? Well, not exactly, since F is not the function that we are trying to differentiate, but the symbollic expression that deffines it implicitly.\n\nOf X? This is just the variable with which we differentiate on.\n\nOf Y? Riguorilously that should be the function that we are differentiating.

Thanks for the comments. I will try to work on it.

As i said, the reason why it is not a method is that it is not clear to me what class should it be in. 

Is this a method of the expression F? Well, not exactly, since F is not the function that we are trying to differentiate, but the symbollic expression that deffines it implicitly.

Of X? This is just the variable with which we differentiate on.

Of Y? Riguorilously that should be the function that we are differentiating. But doesn't sound natural at all to add a method like this for symbollic variables.

Or maybe we could define a new class ImplicitelyDefinedSymbolicFunction for this case, bat that sounds way overkill.

I think Burcin wants this method part of the symbolic expression or function class. If it's not tied to a specific expression then make it a `@classmethod` (equivalent to a static method in C), and then create the globally accessible name for it.
