   2557         if base_ring is None or base_ring == self.base_ring():

Such a command is likely to be a mistake, but the error message is irrelevant and is triggered by using a function name `Sequence` in `isinstance`. The attached patch removes this test as sequences are instances of lists and are correctly recognized anyway.

* all tests pass with this alternative patch.

If you agree with my reasons, I'd rather use this solution.

It appears that the span() **function** in free_module.pyx  mostly tries to find an appropriate parent for the generators, and then hands everything off to the .span() **method** of the parent.

So here, the integer zero is construed to be the first generator, and the class of integers has no span method.

What do you think of checking if the first generator is a list, or if it is a free module element (`is_FreeModuleElement`), before proceeding with a supposed parent?  This would allow an informative error message, such as - "generators must be lists of ring elements, or free module elements"

I like the looks of the new version.  I did discover one problem.

```
sage: V = span(ZZ, [[1,2,3/4]])
sage: V
Free module of degree 3 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[  1   2 3/4]
```

I think this can be fixed by passing `R` into the final `span` method in the return (rather than `base_ring`.)  This should have been caught by the span method, which seems to be the real fault here, I've isolated that at #12688.

I might write a few more doctests for the span() function as part of final testing for this.
