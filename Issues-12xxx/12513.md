Before

```
sage: var('x,y')
(x, y)
sage: f = (sum(x^k for k in [-10..10]) * sum(y^k for k in [-10..10])).expand()
sage: ff = fast_callable(f, CDF, (x,y))
sage: %timeit ff(1+2j, 3+4j)
125 loops, best of 3: 4.53 ms per loop
sage: len(ff.python_calls())
756
sage: ff.python_calls()[:10]
[(^10), (^10), (^10), (^9), (^9), (^10), (^10), (^8), (^9), (^9)]
```

which is still better than 

```
sage: %timeit f(x=1+2j, y=3+4j)
25 loops, best of 3: 12 ms per loop
```

but nowhere close to 

```
sage: var('x,y')
(x, y)
sage: f = (sum(x^k for k in [-10..10]) * sum(y^k for k in [-10..10])).expand()
sage: ff = fast_callable(f, CDF, (x,y))
sage: %timeit ff(1+2j, 3+4j)
625 loops, best of 3: 127 Âµs per loop
sage: len(ff.python_calls())
0
sage: 4.53 / .127
