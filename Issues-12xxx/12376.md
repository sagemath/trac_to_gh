Hmmm.... I am sorry but these things are really dangerous... `:-/`

What would happen if one of the functions BipartiteGraph inherits has to compute the complement of the graph at some point ? The result would not be the one intended.... `:-/`

Travis, can you comment this?

But this will not help if there will be another subclass of generic graphs. Anyways, this corrects this particular problem for now.
