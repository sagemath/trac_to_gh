Hmmm.... I am sorry but these things are really dangerous... `:-/`

What would happen if one of the functions BipartiteGraph inherits has to compute the complement of the graph at some point ? The result would not be the one intended.... `:-/`

Travis, can you comment this?

If I make a special case for `BipartiteGraph`, it will break if there will be another subclass of `Graph`. So I should just check for `isinstance(g, sage.graphs.digraph.DiGraph)` and `isinstance(g, sage.graphs.graph.Graph)` and then make a copy like `Graph(self)`. However the docstring for that says "Please use this method only if you need to copy but change the underlying implementation or weightedness.  Otherwise simply do `copy(g)` - -".

So what is the right thing to do?

The problem is that doing stuff to the backend doesn't reflect the front-end class (normally if you added an edge that breaks the bipartite-ness, then it errors out). I would implement a `BipartiteGraph.complement` that either checks the output is bipartite and errors out if not or generically constructs the corresponding `Graph`.",

Hmm...I'm really not sure. The problem is that doing stuff to the backend doesn't reflect the front-end class (normally if you added an edge that breaks the bipartite-ness, then it errors out). I would implement a `BipartiteGraph.complement` that either checks the output is bipartite and errors out if not or generically constructs the corresponding `Graph`.

Like this?

But this will not help if there will be another subclass of generic graphs. Anyways, this corrects this particular problem for now.
