The problem is that doing stuff to the backend doesn't reflect the front-end class (normally if you added an edge that breaks the bipartite-ness, then it errors out). I would implement a `BipartiteGraph.complement` that either checks the output is bipartite and errors out if not or generically constructs the corresponding `Graph`.",

Hmm...I'm really not sure. The problem is that doing stuff to the backend doesn't reflect the front-end class (normally if you added an edge that breaks the bipartite-ness, then it errors out). I would implement a `BipartiteGraph.complement` that either checks the output is bipartite and errors out if not or generically constructs the corresponding `Graph`.

Like this?

But this will not help if there will be another subclass of generic graphs. Anyways, this corrects this particular problem for now.
