The documentation says that UniqueRepresentation uses weak refs, but this was switched over to the `@`cached_method decorator. The latter does currently use strong references, so unused unique parents stay in memory forever:

```
import sage.structure.unique_representation
len(sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__.cache)

for i in range(2,1000):
    ring = ZZ.quotient(ZZ(i))
    vectorspace = ring^2

import gc
gc.collect()
len(sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__.cache)
```
Related tickets:
* #11521 (needs review, introducing weak references for caching homsets), and
* #715 (needs review, using weak references for caching coerce maps). 
* #5970 (the polynomial rings cache use strong references, which may now be a duplicate, as I introduce the weak cache in #715)

Further notes:
* not everything in Python can be weakref'ed, for example ``None`` cannot.
* some results that are expensive to compute should not just be cached by a weak reference. Perhaps there is place for a permanent cache, or maybe some minimal age before garbage collecting it.

See my comment at #5970: It seems that having a weak version of cached_function (which is used to decorate `UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__` is the missing bit (in addition to #11521 and #715 and a two-line change in the polynomial ring constructor) for fixing the issues at #5970.

I think this should be done on top of #11115, which rewrites cached methods and already has a positive review.

There is yet another location where it makes sense to use `@`weak_cached_function: For the cache of dynamic classes!

Namely, dynamic classes are frequently used in the category framework, they have a strong cache, and the parent/element classes keep a pointer to the category they belong to. So, that's preventing categories from being garbage collected.

I think that my patches from here, #715, and #11935 (which reduces the number of dynamic classes created) might actually be enough to fix the problem. When I run

```
sage: for p in primes(2,1000000):
....:     R = GF(p)['x','y','z']
....:     print get_memory_usage()
```
then one initially still sees an increased memory usage. But after a while it seems to stabilise.

I did `sage -t --verbose "devel/sage-main/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py"`, and it did *not* reveal a segfault while running the tests. The test process itself crashed:

```
830 tests in 54 items.
830 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.
The doctested process was killed by signal 11
         [23.8 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:

Strange.

I think I found the problem.

Some doctest of the form

```
sage: K.residue_field()
<expected answer>
```
segfaults. But when the result is assigned to a variable, like this

```
sage: RF = K.residue_field(); RF
<expected answer>
```
then everything works.

Is it perhaps the case that garbage collection of the residue field (that was enabled by my patch) happens between the creation and the computation of the string representation of the object?

But that is strange. There are variables `_` and `__`, which are supposed to provide strong references to the last two results - hence, there should be no garbage collection.

`sage.structure.factory.UniqueFactory` did use weak references before. But it did so - I think - improperly, namely without using `weakref.WeakValueDictionary`. The new patch version changes that.

It isn't ready for review, yet, because of the segfaults.

Some old code is *not* using the cache: There was some coerce map created in sage/rings/residue_field.pyx, whose parent was not created by `Hom(domain,codomain)`, but directly by `RingHomset(domain,codomain)`. 

Changing it fixed at least one segfault. I wish all segfaults would go away so easily...

Fortunately, I now have a short example that triggers a memory access error when leaving Sage:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('15a1')
sage: K.<t>=NumberField(x^2+2*x+10)
sage: EK=E.base_extend(K)
sage: EK.torsion_subgroup()
Torsion Subgroup isomorphic to Z/4 + Z/4 associated to the Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + y = x^3 + x^2 + (-10)*x + (-10) over Number Field in t with defining polynomial x^2 + 2*x + 10
sage: quit
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m1.98s, Wall time 0m52.03s).
local/bin/sage-sage: Zeile 303: 30045 Speicherzugriffsfehler  sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

However, I wonder how I can trigger the error without leaving Sage, and how I can trace what is going on.

With sage-5.0.prealpha0 plus #11780 plus #715 plus #11521 plus #12290, all tests pass. But if one adds the two patches from here, one gets

It seems that a good deal of the errors comes from a method `sage.combinat.sf.sf.SymmetricFunctions.register_isomorphism`: It registers a coercion, but this is only possible when no coercion has been established for that object before.

What should one do: Catch the error and 'not'' registering the coercion? Or wipe the registered coercions, by calling `sage.structure.parent.Parent.unset_coercions_used`?

Here is a very short example triggering the error:

```
sage: P = JackPolynomialsP(QQ,1)
sage: P([2,1])^2
```

Hopefully this is short enough for debugging - I find it quite mysterious, so far.

I inserted some print statement into the `register_isomorphism` method of symmetric functions. I found that with *or* without the patch, the isomorphisms are registered both during initialisation of the `JackPolynomialsP` *and* before raising an element to a power for the first time:

```

This gives rise to some questions:

* Why are the symmetric functions registering the isomorphisms *twice*, even without my patch?
* Why is there no error without my patch? There should be, since double-registration of a coercion is illegal!

I guess, the best solution would be to address the first question: Registering the same thing twice is a waste or resources anyway.

<a id='comment:49'>Comment 49:</a>
Now I understand the problem:

`SymmetricFunctions` is a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`. By my patch, `UniqueRepresentation` is using weak references. Apparently `SymmetricFunctions` therefore can be garbage collected, but - and now comes the strange point - the coercion system still recalls that a coercion to them has already been registered.

Anyway, with my patch, `SymmetricFunctions(ZZ)` and SymmetricFunctions(QQ)` are created repeatedly, and that's bad.

Cc to Volker, because I expect he has enough knowledge to give me some advice on how I could trace down the following segfault.

With #12313 and the patch from here, `sage -t -verbose -force_lib "devel/sage/doc/en/bordeaux_2008/half_integral.rst"` segfaults. By inspection of the core file, I found that the segfault occurs during deallocation of a functor.

For debugging, I added a `__dealloc__` method to `sage.categories.functor.Functor` that writes the type and the address of self and of the two cdef attributes `__domain` and `__codomain` to some file. The same is done during initialisation of the functor.

And the last lines of the resulting file (before the segfault) are:

```
Dealloc Functor <type 'sage.structure.coerce_actions.LeftModuleAction'> at 71023056
  Domain <class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'> at 75636560
  Codom. <class 'sage.categories.commutative_rings.CommutativeRings'> at 15429144
Dealloc Functor <type 'sage.structure.coerce_actions.LeftModuleAction'> at 71023056
  Domain <type 'NoneType'> at 140661532564960
  Codom. <type 'NoneType'> at 140661532564960
```

In other words, the functor is deallocated twice, which is a legitimate reason to segfault.

How can I find out why Sage tries to deallocate it twice?

And I do believe it is the same instance. Namely, if what you say was right, then we should see a call to "init" between the two deallocations (I made both init and dealloc write to the same log file). But the two deallocations followed directly: No initialisation and no other deallocation in between.

I have updated the second patch, which was about fixing segfaults anyway.

As I already stated: I find it weird that the problem is solved by *incrementing* the reference count of the domain and codomain of an action when the action is deallocated. But it works, i.e., the doctests that used to segfault with #12313 and the old version of the patches run fine with the new patch version.

I need an expert opinion, though, and the full test suite is also to be run.

Concerning memleaks, here is the example from the ticket description.

With #12313 and the patches from here:

```
sage: import sage.structure.unique_representation
sage: len(sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__.cache)
135
sage: 
sage: for i in range(2,1000):
....:         ring = ZZ.quotient(ZZ(i))
....:     vectorspace = ring^2
....: 
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
16641
sage: len(sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__.cache)
227
```

With #12313 only:

```
sage: import sage.structure.unique_representation
sage: len(sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__.cache)
151
sage: 
sage: for i in range(2,1000):
....:         ring = ZZ.quotient(ZZ(i))
....:     vectorspace = ring^2
....: 
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
3805
sage: len(sage.structure.unique_representation.UniqueRepresentation.__classcall__.cache)
5142
```

So, it is a clear progress, and IIRC the patches comprise tests against at least one memory leak that is fixed. Needs review!

With sage-5.0.prealpha0 plus #11780, #11290, #715, #11521, #12313 and the patches from here, make ptest results in

```
        sage -t  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/combinat/sf/sf.py # 1 doctests failed

So, it needs work (because all tests pass when the patches from here are not applied), but it should hopefully be easy to fix.

I tried the following in `cdef class Action`:

```python
    def __cinit__(self):
        print 'Action __cinit__ ' + str(id(self))

    def __dealloc__(self):
        print 'Action __dealloc__ ' + str(id(self))
```
then I do get occasionally reused id (=memory address in CPython), for example

```
    Action __cinit__ 105376976
    Action __dealloc__ 105376976
    Action __cinit__ 105376976
    Action __dealloc__ 105376976
```
But I don't see any double finalizers without the object being constructed in-between. I also don't get any segfault in `bordeaux_2008/half_integral.rst`.

Sure. As I stated in some post above, the segfault only results when applying both #12313 (hence, its dependency #715 as well) *and* the (old) patches from here.

If you only have the (old or new) patches from here or only have #715+#12313 then there is no segfault.

It seems that its just memory corruption that manifests itself by freeing the object twice. But the error is presumably elsewhere. Also the gdb stack trace is completely corrupted.

within `coercion_model.bin_op()` (frame 17) there are calls to Python methods (`PyObject_Call`), and in there the garbage collector is free to run. I suspect that this is what is happening somewhere...

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A65):

What exactly do you mean? Do you have the *old* patches from here applied (i.e., without the new `__dealloc__` method), or does the segfault even occur with the *new* patches?

Is it normal that both you and me see segfaults, and it seems to be analogous problems (namely double deallocation), but we see it in different examples and with different patches (namely, even with the *old* patches from here, all tests pass for me)?

So, you can confirm that it is the same object.

> But the error is presumably elsewhere. Also the gdb stack trace is completely corrupted.

That sounds like one should write a complete log of all python code executed - according to your suggestion that the error somewhere occurs during a Python method.

Here is some more info on the segfault.

Setting: I have sage-5.0.prealpha0 plus #11780, #11290, #715, #11521, #12313 and the patches from here, removing the `__dealloc__` method introduced by the last patch.

The segfault is triggered by doing

```
sage: half_integral_weight_modform_basis(DirichletGroup(16,QQ).1, 3, 10)
[]
sage: half_integral_weight_modform_basis(DirichletGroup(16,QQ).1, 5, 10)

I was tracing all python commands for the first variant of the segfault. The last few lines of the log are as follows:

```
sage.categories.pushout:__call__:2125         if self.p == other.p:
sage.categories.pushout:__call__:2126             from sage.all import Infinity
sage.categories.pushout:__call__:2127             if self.prec == other.prec:

sage.categories.pushout:__call__:3102     except CoercionException:
sage.categories.pushout:__call__:3104     except (TypeError, ValueError, AttributeError, NotImplementedError), ex:
sage.categories.pushout:__call__:3108         raise CoercionException(ex)
weakref:__call__:49             self = selfref()
weakref:__call__:50             if self is not None:
weakref:__call__:51                 del self.data[wr.key]
sage.rings.power_series_ring:__call__:556         s = "Power Series Ring in %s over %s"%(self.variable_name(), self.base_ring())
sage.rings.power_series_ring:__call__:557         if self.is_sparse():
sage.rings.power_series_ring:__call__:562         return self.__is_sparse
sage.rings.power_series_ring:__call__:559         return s
```
So, indeed it seems that the problem has something to do with weak references. There is an item of a weak value dictionary deleted right before segfaulting.

To do: Find out what item of what dictionary is deleted, why it is deleted, and how deletion can be prevented.

<a id='comment:69'>Comment 69:</a>
I was also tracing the deletion of items of weak value dictionaries: I was writing the key to a log file whenever an item was deleted.

Already when starting sage, we see that the same key (and presumably the same value as well) is deleted repeatedly:

```
...
((<class 'sage.categories.category.JoinCategory'>, (Category of semirings, Category of infinite enumerated sets)), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Integer Ring), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Rational Field), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Rational Field), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Rational Field), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Complex Lazy Field), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Rational Field), ())
```

When issuing the first line of the crashing example and repeating it, we see something like

```
...
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Complex Lazy Field), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Complex Lazy Field), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Cyclotomic Field of order 4 and degree 2), ())
((<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace'>, Rational Field, 0, 0, False), ())
((<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace'>, Rational Field, 10, 0, False), ())
((5, 0, 'prealpha0'), (Rational Field, 0, False, None))
((<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace'>, Rational Field, 0, 0, False), ())
((<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace'>, Rational Field, 10, 0, False), ())
```

And at crashing, one has

```
((<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace'>, Ring of integers modulo 46337, 4, 10, False), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.vector_spaces.VectorSpaces'>, Ring of integers modulo 46337), ())
((<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace'>, Integer Ring, 4, 10, False), ())
((<class 'sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace'>, Rational Field, 4, 10, False), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Power Series Ring in q over Rational Field), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Power Series Ring in q over Rational Field), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Power Series Ring in q over Rational Field), ())
((<class 'sage.categories.groupoid.Groupoid'>, Power Series Ring in q over Integer Ring), ())
```

Conclusion:

The occurring keys indicate that the deletions occur in `UniqueRepresentation`. While using weak references for `UniqueRepresentation` fixes memory leaks, it seems that far too often stuff is removed that would actually still be needed. Certainly it is bad for speed, and it seems that it is also responsible for the segmentation faults.

I am not sure how that problem should best be addressed.

I think I have not properly stated that with the latest patches applied to sage-5.0.prealpha0, the segfault is gone. However, at least when I also have a couple of other tickets (#11780, #12290, #715. #11521, #12313, #12357, #12351, #7797), I get one coercion error in sage.combinat.sf.sf.

To be precise, I do not get that error when I only have all the other patches. So, it really seems to be caused by the patches from here. Trying to track it down...

I tested whether the problem comes from the combination of this ticket with #12357. But it turns out that the following test

```
        sage: K = GF(1<<55,'t')
        sage: for i in range(50):
        ...     a = K.random_element()
        ...     E = EllipticCurve(j=a)
        ...     P = E.random_point()
        ...     Q = 2*P
        sage: import gc
        sage: n = gc.collect()
        sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_finite_field import EllipticCurve_finite_field
        sage: LE = [x for x in gc.get_objects() if isinstance(x, EllipticCurve_finite_field)]
        sage: len(LE)    # indirect doctest
        1
```
still fails. The test has been introduced in #12313. And of course it is not acceptable that #12313 makes a memory leak disappear, but #12215 makes it show up again.

<a id='comment:83'>Comment 83:</a>
With the updated version of the first patch (applied on top of #715, #11521, #12313, #11943 and #11935), the tests in sage/structure/coerce_dict and sage/categories/homset pass.

There remains the problem with symmetric functions, but this is due to the second patch...

What exactly is the problem?

It is

```
            sage: S = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ)
            sage: S.inject_shorthands()
            doctest:...: RuntimeWarning: redefining global value `e`
            doctest:...: RuntimeWarning: redefining global value `m`
            sage: s[1] + e[2] * p[1,1] + 2*h[3] + m[2,1]
            s[1] - 2*s[1, 1, 1] + s[1, 1, 1, 1] + s[2, 1] + 2*s[2, 1, 1] + s[2, 2] + 2*s[3] + s[3, 1]
```
The last line fails with an error when doctesting, but works fine when doing the same in an interactive session.

Hi Simon,

I've read the patches to see if there is anything weird or questionable. It looks good for the most part. Just some things you might be able to comment on:

**main patch:**

sage/categories/category.py

You make some changes to _join, which has the note

    It is used for getting a temporary speed-up at trac ticket #11900.
    But it is supposed to be replaced by a better solution at trac
    ticket #11943.

and #11943 was merged in 5.1! Is this function still used?

Otherwise: Looks good!

**sefault_fixes:**

sage/combinat/sf/sf.py

There is still a change to that file, namely, you add
"from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_function"

which is an odd thing to do in one patch by itself. Perhaps it's a change you failed to revert?

INCREF:

scary stuff ... I don't like black magic in code, but you seem to know what
you're doing...


**Conclusion:**

I'd be close to giving a positive review. I haven't run test suits (yet), but you've done a lot of that and the bot should be doing that anyway. The changes themselves look fairly straightforward.

Thank you for spotting it. The plan was to replace it, but apparently it wasn't done. So, I removed the note.

I have removed the import. I also removed the *strongly* cached classcall from sage/combinat/sf/sfa.py: it turns out that a strong cache for symmetric function algebras is not needed any more, after the recent overhaul.

> INCREF:
> 
> scary stuff ...

I know. I am now testing whether it it still needed.

Anyway, it should now be ready for review. I think, to be on the safe side, we should use #11521 as a dependency, which meanwhile has a positive review (thank you!).

Great! The scary INCREF apparently is not needed!! All tests in sage/schemes and sage/sf pass. The following two examples previously resulted in a segfault, but now they don't:

```
sage: half_integral_weight_modform_basis(DirichletGroup(16,QQ).1, 3, 10)
[]
sage: half_integral_weight_modform_basis(DirichletGroup(16,QQ).1, 5, 10)
[q - 2*q^3 - 2*q^5 + 4*q^7 - q^9 + O(q^10)]
sage: quit

```
sage: half_integral_weight_modform_basis(DirichletGroup(16,QQ).1, 5, 10)

Good! indeed, with the new dependency things apply cleanly.

```
sage/structure/coerce.pyx
```
Agreed. Things get placed in buckets based on address. I'd expect that to depend on not just the machine but even on the run!

```
sage/combinat/integer_vectors_mod_permgroup.py
```
That one times out for me too. With `--verbose` I get that all 271 tests pass but then it hangs on

```
A workspace appears to have been corrupted... automatically rebuilding (this is harmless).
```
which explains a timeout. That might just been my setup, but since one of the bots experienced a similar problem, perhaps this needs attention.

I've seen some startup time failures on `sage.math`, but the machine is rather loaded. I don't think any of the #5457, #12215 patches are individually responsible for slowdowns.

So at this point, it's just technical bits -- nothing intrinsic about the code proposed here.

Oops, I had one run now where my connection wasn't closed! I got a " TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED!" this time.

And in fact, the "connection closed" thing seems to happen quite a bit, so I don't think I have confirmation that there's really a bug. It may be that sage.math is just flaky.

OK, the "connection lost" problem was resolved by `rm -rf ~/.sage`. I don't know what was screwed up, but something there was making *any* sage session very prone to terminating the whole connection.

It seems that line 971 in `mpolynomialsystem.py` is indeed a problematic doctest. It seems to hang. When I run the doctest in `gdb` I can interrupt and get a traceback (first bit):

```

so it seems `TripleDict` is implicated. I've tried it a couple of times and the tracebacks are not completely identical all the time, but the `collect (generation=2)` always seems to be there. So either the system gets stuck in a loop in which it is spending a large percentage of the time in `collect` or somehow `collect` itself gets caught in an infinite loop. I guess instrumenting TripleDict to see what it's chewing on is most likely to resolve this one (anything below seems python library).

Of course this is another heisenbug: If I take the doctesting python file that gets produced, `~/.sage/tmp/mpolynomialsystem_*.py` and run that through python via

```
 $ ./sage -sh
 $ python ~/.sage/tmp/mpolynomialsystem_*.py
```
the doctest succeeds, which is weird, because that is exactly what `sage-doctest` is supposed to run too.

This had a positive review, however I think one can not realistically expect it will soon go in: It depends on other tickets, that have a tendency to uncover nasty problems.

Hence, I suggest to cut it into smaller pieces - one of them being the Pari deallocation, that is now the new dependency #13741. The second patch thus needs to be rebased.

That behaviour is entirely consistent with a double free (and hence a circular freelist) that we solved in #13896. So, back to positive review from me!

We only introduced a codependence on #12313 because of comment [comment:133]. In view of comment [comment:141] I suspect the source of the problem noted in comment [comment:131] was actually solved, rather than hidden by merging tickets together.

Hence, I propose that this ticket is considered without dependencies and be considered for merging in sage-5.7 anyway.

Yes. Note also [comment:52](#comment%3A52): It used to be the case that both #12215 and #12313 were fine *separately*, but problems occurred when they were used *together*.

Now it very much seems that the Cython upgrade was enough to fix the crashes. We should of course verify that no problems occur when #12215 is merged without #12313, but I think there is no reason to merge #12215 and #12313 together.

Attachment: **[sage_crash_WgD9iG.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12215/sage_crash_WgD9iG.log)**

Thanks to Volker's enhanced backtraces, running the test in verbose mode and without gdb yields [this backtrace](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12215/sage_crash_WgD9iG.log), and the crash occurs here (line 6467 of heegner.py)

```
        sage: E = EllipticCurve('681b')
        sage: I = E.heegner_index(-8); I
```

Unfortunately, running this in an interactive session works just fine.

    "body": "<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>\nGot it, I think.\n\nThe crash happens in the last line of the following snippet\n\n```\n  __pyx_t_1 = __pyx_v_self->D->buckets;\n  __Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_1);\n  __pyx_t_4 = __pyx_v_self->D->buckets;\n  __Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_4);\n  __pyx_t_10 = PyList_GET_ITEM(__pyx_t_1, (__pyx_v_h % PyList_GET_SIZE(__pyx_t_4)));\n```\nand according to the crash log, we have\n\n```\n        __pyx_t_1 = 0x7f3db87dcb00 <_Py_NoneStruct>\n```\n\nHence, again, we have the problem that some attributes have already become invalid. I think this was fixed by [the second patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12313/trac_12313-safe_callback.patch.gz) from #12313.\n\nSuggestion: In order to keep things modular, the part of the second #12313 patch that applies to `TripleDict` shall be moved here, so that #12215 remains independent of #12313. And then, the second patch of #12313 should be replaced by something that only takes care of the new `MonoDict`.\n\nRationale: #12313 has a problem with a time regression, while #12215 should (hopefully) be fine after installing the fix.",

Got it, I think.

The crash happens in the last line of the following snippet

```
  __pyx_t_1 = __pyx_v_self->D->buckets;
  __Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_1);
  __pyx_t_4 = __pyx_v_self->D->buckets;
  __Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_4);
  __pyx_t_10 = PyList_GET_ITEM(__pyx_t_1, (__pyx_v_h % PyList_GET_SIZE(__pyx_t_4)));
```
and according to the crash log, we have

```
        __pyx_t_1 = 0x7f3db87dcb00 <_Py_NoneStruct>
```

Hence, again, we have the problem that some attributes have already become invalid. I think this was fixed by [the second patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket12313/trac_12313-safe_callback.patch.gz) from #12313.

Suggestion: In order to keep things modular, the part of the second #12313 patch that applies to `TripleDict` shall be moved here, so that #12215 remains independent of #12313. And then, the second patch of #12313 should be replaced by something that only takes care of the new `MonoDict`.

Rationale: #12313 has a problem with a time regression, while #12215 should (hopefully) be fine after installing the fix.
