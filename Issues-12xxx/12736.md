<div id="comment:0"></div>

Several requests for solver options to use as parameters for GLPK prompt us to allow the user to set quite a few parameters.

In addition, the name for the solver parameter in ticket #12309 (`preprocessing`) isn't very accurate (we didn't think it through carefully enough at the time) so that option will change, too.

I propose to change/enable the following solver options. See the GLPK documentation for details on each option, and note that most have two names: one to correspond to GLPK, one for legibility.

* glpk's solver
  * default is `glp_intopt`, as at present
  * `simplex_first`: setting this to `True` makes the solver invoke `glp_simplex` before `glp_intopt`
    * useful to avoid problems in glpk
    * **replaces** current `preprocessing` parameter
  * `simplex_only`: setting this to `True makes the solver invoke `glp_simplex` **instead** of `glp_intopt`

* glpk's `intopt` solver
  * `msg_level` or `verbosity`
  * `br_tech` or `branching`
  * `bt_tech` or `backtracking`
  * `pp_tech` or `preprocessing`
  * `fp_heur` or `feasibility_pump`
  * `gmi_cuts` or `gomory_cuts`
  * `mir_cuts` or `mixed_int_rounding_cuts`
  * `cov_cuts` or `mixed_cover_cuts`
  * `clq_cuts` or `clique_cuts`
  * `tol_int` or `absolute_tolerance`
  * `tol_obj` or `relative_tolerance`
  * `mip_gap` or `mip_gap_tolerance`
  * `tm_lim` or `time_limit`
  * `out_freq` or `output_frequency`
  * `presolve` or `mip_presolver`
  * `binarize`

* glpk's `simplex` solver
  * `msg_level` or `verbosity`
  * `meth` or `primal_v_dual`
  * `pricing`
  * `r_test` or `ratio_test`
  * `tol_bnd` or `tolerance_primal`
  * `tol_dj` or `tolerance_dual`
  * `tol_piv` or `tolerance_pivot`
  * `obj_ll` or `obj_lower_limit`
  * `obj_ul` or `obj_upper_limit`
  * `it_lim` or `iteration_limit`
  * `tm_lim` or `time_limit`
  * `out_frq` or `output_frequency`
  * `out_dly` or `output_delay`
  * `presolve`

Feel free to suggest better names, or that we stick with only the GLPK names, etc.

Raniere,

I don't like the idea of using strings for the solver parameter name. This is primarily for efficiency reasons; you have to remember that in my projects, I create a lot of small LPs, & don't want to deal with the string comparisons when an integer comparison will do much better.

I will upload another patch in a little bit (I finally figured out how to do it) and you can tell me what you think of this approach.

Argh. Expressed myself badly: I meant,

Although, given that the name is passed as a string, that may be a dumb objection.

John,
using strings for name and value was my first and only ideia of how to do GLPKBackend.solver_parameter work with MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solver_parameter with not import GLPKBackend module.
For some parameter that only two values are avaliable it's possible to use True and False as values.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

The declaration of the `solve()` method of the `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` class is

```
    def solve(self, solver=None, log=0, objective_only=False):
```
Within the function we have

```
        self._backend.set_verbosity(log)
```
Makes sense, you say, right? Well, no, for three reasons:

1. It renders moot the `msg_lev` solver paramter.
2. It's a bit weird to initialize `log`  to 0, since the solvers are already initialized to shut up in `__cinit__` .
3. Someone might want to see whether the solver is making any progress, by setting the verbosity through the solver parameter, rather than through `solve()` .

IMHO, the user ought to have that option; otherwise, there's no point to allowing a `msg_level` option at all. This is easily fixed, too: change the default value of `log` to `None`, and then the code to,

```
        if log != None:
          self._backend.set_verbosity(log)
```
This should retain compatibility with the previous setup.

What do you guys think?

While working on this tonight, I realized that mip.pyx expects the `timelimit` parameter for both CPLEX and GLPK to be in seconds. To get around this, I added a new parameter, `timelimit_intopt` and `timelimit_simplex`; these accept milliseconds.

I also added a couple of new doctests, one to test this difference.

I would like to doctest output when we set `msg_level` to something other than `...off`, but apparently the doctest facility doesn't recognize output produced by linked C code, only output produced by Python or Cython. If anyone has an idea on how to make that work, let me know.

Otherwise, I guess this is ready. (I've tested it with some of my own code, too.)

NEEDS REVIEW.

If your focus is a handful of large linear programs, the penalty of Python strings v. machine integers might not matter. If your focus is a few thousand small linear programs, it could be an issue -- especially if you start mucking around w/options quite a bit.

Admittedly, in my own work I don't seem to need the options after all, and I've managed to revise, revise, revise my approach until I'm now creating only a few tens of programs, instead of a few thousand. So it's not that big an issue for me as it used to be. But it could become an issue again in the future.

I hadn't heard of them. Okay, the update is merely to the documentation. What's a good way of viewing it? Should it work even in text mode?

No, it should change nothing to the text mode, but the html doc should be much better !!

To compile it :

sage -b <your_branch> && sage -docbuild reference html

Helloooooooo John !!

I see no new method in your patch, but it is a bit hard to see what you *changed* inside of this large patch. By the way, if you modify your patch while mine already applies on top of it, there's a chance that it will break afterwards `^^;`

I do not use this timelimit option myself, but it would surely be nice to be able to know whether the value of the variables when GLPK stops has any meaning.... Would it be possible to return a MIPSolverException or something similar when the computations stopped because of time ? It could probably detected along with the other ones (unbounded/impossible/no integer solution/...).
