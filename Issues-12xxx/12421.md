<div id="comment:0"></div>

If on startup of Sage we set the LESS environment variable as follows (only setting it if it isn't already set), then the prompt at the end of docstring will be "(END - press q to quit) " instead of the cryptic "(END)":

```
   export LESS="-P?n?f%f .?m(file %i of %m) ..?e(END - press q to quit) ?x- Next\: %x..%t"
```

> ... (only setting it if it isn't already set), ...

That may be too simple. For example, my LESS variable *is* set:

```
> echo $LESS
-M -I -R
```
However, that setting does not define the prompt (options starting with `-P`, if I understand correctly).

So, if the LESS variable is set, then one should still test which of the different `-P` options (`-Ps`, `-Pm`, `-PM`, etc) is defined, and only change the others.

SimonKing -- I think that if the user has already set LESS, then they are by definition not a "total newbie", so we simply leave LESS alone.   

I was talking about this issue in my Sage class yesterday, and realized (by accident) that "h" gives the help for LESS, and it is extremely useful help.  The first line explains that "q" quits, and the rest of the help gives lots of other useful information.  So instead of changing the prompt to "(END - press q to quit)", we should instead change it to "(END - press h for help)".   Despite decade(s) of using less, *I* didn't even know it had an "h" for help until yesterday.

I think only defining LESS if it isn't set makes the most sense. We should also add information about this in the tutorial. I also wonder the Sage banner should be changed or expanded: it currently says

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 5.0.beta1, Release Date: 2012-01-22                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
`license()` is obviously important, but it's not something that people will need to run very much, and it's not much help for newbies. We could eliminate its mention in the banner, or we could say

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 5.0.beta1, Release Date: 2012-01-22                   |
| Type 'notebook()' for the GUI and 'license()' for licensing.       |
| Type 'tutorial()' for a tutorial and 'help()' for more help.       |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
The message printed by `help()` could also say something about what to do after you type something like `matrix_plot?`.

In class yesterday some students strongly suggested that having a big mention of a useful help command would be well worth doing.   The first thing help() mentions is the tutorial command, so we would not need to explicitly mention tutorial. 

While we're on the topic, another student complaint is that the notebook server doesn't tell the user to type control-c to exit it, which is very confusing and dangerous. 

By the way, the tutorial() command has no doctest:

```
    def tutorial(self):
        """
        The Sage tutorial.  To get started with Sage, start here.
        """
        self._open("tutorial")
```
I think it could be tested by at least making sure that this isn't going to happen (which is what I got on my laptop, since I was building sage-5.0 on 10.7 and the html docs I guess didn't build, since I had to restart things):

```
...
OSError: The document 'tutorial' does not exist.  Please build it.
```
