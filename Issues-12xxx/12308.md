I re-tested this (I was able to find the correct spkg the first time, BTW).  It applied fine to 4.8.rc0 and all relevant tests pass.

```
sage: CDB=CremonaDatabase()              
sage: CDB.number_of_curves()         
1406789
sage: CDB.number_of_isogeny_classes()
965348
sage: CDB.conductor_range()
(1, 220000)
```

Whenever 4.8 is released this spkg needs to be put where the other oprional spgs are.
I really really do not see why this has to wait until 5.0 since it has no effect at all on the Sage library....
