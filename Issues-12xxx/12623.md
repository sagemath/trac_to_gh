I found that the PIL spkg has patches to deal with lib vs lib64 ; unfortunately, debian-based distributions have (or will soon have) another way to handle having various types of libraries on the same system.

I'm going to propose a patch which will add support for multiarch, based on the patch which is already used in debian for the python-imaging version 1.17. It is a very clean patch, as it only triggers on debian-based systems which have already made the switch.
