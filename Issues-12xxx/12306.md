Helloooooo !!

This extensively documented module implements a very basic data structure for graphs that is helpful for *EFFICIENT* implementations. It was actually used by Sage already in sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs, but it is better to have a proper documentation for such things.

And of course, this does not solve the current lack of a Python-level static graph class, that would handle loops/multiedges and labels... It will come, though `:-)`

<a id='comment:4'></a>I can now install the patch with sage-5.0.beta2. 

No compilation error. Generation of the documentation is OK.

However, can you improve in section `What does it take as input?` the `n^2sizeof(...)` and the nsizeof(...). For instance you can add a \cdot between `n` and `sizeof(...)`.

For functions returning a dictionnary of dictionnary, you should add an extra warning recalling that such structures are huge. I'm not sure most of us can use this for graphs with 10.000 nodes.

Best,
