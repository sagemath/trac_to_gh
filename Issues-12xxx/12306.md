Helloooooo !!

This extensively documented module implements a very basic data structure for graphs that is helpful for *EFFICIENT* implementations. It was actually used by Sage already in sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs, but it is better to have a proper documentation for such things.

And of course, this does not solve the current lack of a Python-level static graph class, that would handle loops/multiedges and labels... It will come, though `:-)`

I can now install the patch with sage-5.0.beta2. 

No compilation error. Generation of the documentation is OK.

However, can you improve in section `What does it take as input?` the `n^2sizeof(...)` and the nsizeof(...). For instance you can add a \cdot between `n` and `sizeof(...)`.

For functions returning a dictionnary of dictionnary, you should add an extra warning recalling that such structures are huge. I'm not sure most of us can use this for graphs with 10.000 nodes.

Best, 

D.
