Dear JStarx,

I strongly suspect you applied the patch and ran "sage -t" without running "sage -b" first, which gives exactly these two errors. (They come from the two non-docstring changes in the patch: I renamed ` late_import ` to ` _late_import ` so it wouldn't appear in the reference manual, and added one line to ` AlgebraicGenerator.pari_polynomial ` so it gave a more informative error message when called on the rational field.)

Can you run "sage -b" and then do the test again?
