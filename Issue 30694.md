So there could be a very subtle change of behavior of `successors` as before it did not allow duplicate successors to appear. While I think this is okay, I am not 100% sure. Franco, do you think you could weigh in here?

I agree. But note that the successors set is remembering the name of the acting operation. Probably there is no duplicate operation ?

I am not sure that one can hope to hear back soon from Franco.

Sorry for the delay.

I agree that an iterator is best here. Note that the successor function returns the data specifying an edge of the graph; i.e., the successor (vertex) together with the operator producing it (edge label). The only way to get duplicates is if the same operator is specified twice in the input.

Thank you Franco.

PS - It was great to talk to you the other day, albeit somewhat briefly.
