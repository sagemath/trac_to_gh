Keywords: FusionRing

The R-matrix method of a `FusionRing` computes `R^{ab}_c`. If a=b it is somewhat delicate to compute. Previously a method of Leduc and Ram was used, and computation of F-matrices by #30423 seemed to show that there was an error. The difficulty is probably not in the result of Leduc and Ram (actually due to Reshetikhin) but in the implementation. This ticket replaces the algorithm with one of Bonderson, Delaney, Galindo, Rowell, Tran and Wang. Preliminary testing by computing F-matrices seems to show that this method gives correct results. (Thanks to Eric Rowell for suggesting this approach.)

Testing with the F-matrix computations for Type "A2" level 2 shows that this is a good fix: after this change to the R-matrix code, we have consistent hexagon and pentagon relations and are able to compute the F-matrix. This is done not with out of the box F-matrix factory in #30423 but with an improved version of that code.

I just broke the one big line up into smaller parts to be more PEP8 compliant factored out the `self.basis()` calls. If my changes are good, then you can set a positive review.
