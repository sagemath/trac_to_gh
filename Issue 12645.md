# Issue 12645: The 'nargs' argument to function() is undocumented

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This could potentially be useful, but the docs only mention the following inputs:

 * Variable name(s)
 * latex_name
 * print_latex_func


```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')          
sage: f = function('f', nargs=1)
sage: f(x,y)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

Note that `sage.calculus.var.var` and `sage.calculus.var.function` are just convenience wrappers of `SR.var` and `sage.symbolic.function_factory.function_factory` respectively. Both are augmented to inject the name they define into the global namespace and are therefore only suited for interactive use at sage's toplevel. In any more elaborate program or in library code, you should use the original functions.

The documentation of any of those can use improvement, but I'm not sure you want to explain all options in all of their docstrings. Perhaps a good cross reference can save some work.
