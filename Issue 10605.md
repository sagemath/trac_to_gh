# Issue 10605: Compute local components of modular forms

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10658

Original creator: davidloeffler

This ticket is to introduce a new feature for computing with modular forms in Sage: the explicit computation of the local component of the automorphic representation attached to a newform.

This is based on the algorithms developed by Jared Weinstein and myself. Magma also has this, but this code is an independent implementation and covers some cases the Magma code doesn't (e.g. the Magma code can't distinguish between a newform and its quadratic twist in certain cases).

Here's a "first cut". Lots of cases aren't implemented and it needs a bit more general polishing, but it works!

Depends on #10443, #10451

(Patchbot's confused: it's trying to apply #8716 twice, because it's in the dependencies of this patch and of #10451.)

The review patch contains some doctest that I made fail on purpose; They are (minor) TODOs that, if completed, I would say are sufficient for giving the patch a positive review.

I needed to move the definition of smooth characters (elements) to the top of the file, but the code itself is mainly untouched.

Hi Martin,

I've made the changes you suggested. I've also fixed one or two other silly errors (e.g. the code stub for ramified supercuspidals always assumed p was 3 in its return strings) and added TestSuite doctests. Thanks again for reviewing this!

The new version of the review patch only differs by the commit message, which was missing before.

Rather than immortalizing the details of the review process in Sage's revision history, here's a single qfolded patch combining the three above.
