This shouldn't return an empty list:


```python
sage: B.<a,b,c,d> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: l = [a + b + d, a + b + c]
sage: F = mq.MPolynomialSystem(l)
sage: F.eliminate_linear_variables()
Polynomial System with 0 Polynomials in 0 Variables
```


Also, it'd be nice to get the list of polynomials used for elimination as well.

I think we should cut this patch into 2 or (preferably) to 3 pieces:

1) Add return_reductors enhancement

2) Add Warning message for slimgb

3) fix for "Polynomial System with 0 Polynomials in 0 Variables"

Maybe 2+3 could be made into one patch, though I wouldn't prefer it.

I  assume you meant 1+3 and I chose this option. (thanks for spotting that I included 2 by accident). If you're happy with my change, you should change the status to "positive review".

Now it is performing what says in its description. I would still separate the fix from the enhancement, I think, or maybe I am getting something wrong here. In any case, the patch seems OK
