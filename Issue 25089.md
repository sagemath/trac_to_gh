Keywords: combinatorial hopf algebras, sage-combinat, WQSym

This ticket implements the projection of combinatorial Hopf algebras FQSym -> QSym, a more efficient transition from the M to the F basis on FQSym (using the Möbius function of the weak order on the symmetric groups), and certain involutions of the combinatorial Hopf algebras WQSym and FQSym:

On WQSym:

- The one that, in the M-basis, reverses the ordered set partition, or equivalently complements the packed word (i.e., replaces letters 1,2,...,k by k,k-1,...,1). This is an automorphism of the algebra structure and an anti-automorphism of the coalgebra structure.

- The one that, in the M-basis, complements the (elements of the blocks of the) ordered set partition, or equivalently reverts the packed word. This is an anti-automorphism of the algebra structure (which is obvious if you look at WQSym as a subring of formal power series in non-commutative variables: then it's just a restriction of the anti-automorphism that fixes each letter) and an automorphism of the coalgebra structure.

- The composition of the above two. This is best called the star involution or the Schützenberger anti-automorphism, and is an anti-automorphism of the whole Hopf algebra. Note that this involution restricts to the `star_involution` method of NSym. (The previous two involutions don't restrict to any linear endomorphisms of NSym at all, so we have no caselaw telling us how to call them.)

On FQSym:

The star involution above restricts to FQSym. Also, there are two new involutions on FQSym, one of which corresponds to reversal, and the other to complement; which one depends on the basis. These are NOT restrictions of the analogous involutions of WQSym!

A later ticket, #25541, will implement similar involutions on FSym.

WQSym part has been implemented, at least on the M basis. I have formulas for all other basis except for C, but I haven't overridden the method so far, to avoid duplicating documentation. (I'm not actually sure if the overrides will significantly speed up the computation, except for the star involution -- since the other two involutions don't involve cancellations when you go through the M basis.)

I've implemented an explicit M-to-F transition matrix for FQSym as well, as was suggested in one of the TODOs. This speeds up computations for all but the simplest cases (warning: these times are on Cygwin):

Before:

```
sage: FQSym = algebras.FQSym(ZZ); FQSym.inject_shorthands()
Defining F as shorthand for Free Quasi-symmetric functions over Integer Ring in the F basis
Defining G as shorthand for Free Quasi-symmetric functions over Integer Ring in the G basis
Defining M as shorthand for Free Quasi-symmetric functions over Integer Ring in the Monomial basis
sage: %timeit F(M[3,2,1])
10000 loops, best of 3: 88.2 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[1,2,3])
1000 loops, best of 3: 489 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[2,1,3])
1000 loops, best of 3: 214 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[1])
The slowest run took 4.19 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 81 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[1,2,3,4])
100 loops, best of 3: 2.9 ms per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[4,2,1,3])
1000 loops, best of 3: 220 µs per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[6,2,5,1,3,4])
100 loops, best of 3: 2.06 ms per loop
sage: %timeit F(M[8,3,2,1,4,5,6,7])
1 loop, best of 3: 1.66 s per loop
```

After:

```
sage: FQSym = algebras.FQSym(ZZ); FQSym.inject_shorthands()
Defining F as shorthand for Free Quasi-symmetric functions over Integer Ring in the F basis
Defining G as shorthand for Free Quasi-symmetric functions over Integer Ring in the G basis

Thinking more about the doc, I don't like the fact that the definitions are in one category file that is basically overwritten in the special cases. So the documentation is not well localized. Although one of the annoying things is it would require a fair bit of duplication. So I am inclined to let it be.

Thus, if my changes are good, then positive review.
