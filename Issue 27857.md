```
Keywords: function fields

Current function field code only works in prime characteristic.

First step is to support function fields over QQ and NumberField's.

Next step is to support function fields over QQbar.

Current status of this ticket:

1. It mostly works!

2. There's a new algorithm (see attached pdf and tex files) to compute decomposition of prime ideals in extension fields.  The older algorithm, which only works in characteristic p, is still used in characteristic p.

3. One way of testing the new decomposition algorithm is to comment out the old algorithm.  This produces a bunch of failures in the test cases, but they all look like different ways of writing the same ideals, not actual failures.

4. It needs test cases.  Lots of them.  We have almost no tests for characteristic zero.  Many of the characteristic p test cases could be adapted to characteristic zero.

5. Once Trac #25390 is integrated, it should work over the algebraic field.

Missing doctests on `_singular_normal` and `FunctionFieldIdeal_global.__init__` (which should be a `TestSuite(foo).run()`).

In `FunctionFieldIdeal_global.gens_two()`, it should be `ALGORITHM:` and no indentation there, and without dollar signs.

In `FunctionFieldHigherDerivation_charzero._derive`, I don't see the point of the internal `derive` function. Also, I believe it is considered better practice to do `def derivative(f): return f.derivative()` since you are naming the function.

In `FunctionFieldMaximalOrder_global.decomposition`, the `.. TODO::` block needs to be indented. I would also do

It is a nice work.  I made lots of small changes to tidy up the overall function field code. Most of them are just for better style  and for better naming. I made also some refactoring to add more functionality to function fields of char zero.

I give positive review on the base code. Please review on my part of modifications.  Then this is good to go.

I observe a serious speed regression on computing maximal orders of global function fields:

Previously,

```
sage: k.<a>=GF(3^3)
....: K.<x>=FunctionField(k); _.<s>=K[]
....: L.<y>=K.extension(s^9 + x^72*s^3 + x^96*s + 2*x^104 + 2*x^96) 
....: 
sage: time L.maximal_order()
CPU times: user 3.41 s, sys: 33.8 ms, total: 3.44 s
Wall time: 3.45 s
Maximal order of Function field in y defined by y^9 + x^72*y^3 + x^96*y + 2*x^104 + 2*x^96
```
Now with the patch,

```
sage: k.<a>=GF(3^3)
....: K.<x>=FunctionField(k); _.<s>=K[]
....: L.<y>=K.extension(s^9 + x^72*s^3 + x^96*s + 2*x^104 + 2*x^96) 
....: 
sage: time L.maximal_order()
CPU times: user 35.1 s, sys: 168 ms, total: 35.3 s
Wall time: 35.2 s
Maximal order of Function field in y defined by y^9 + x^72*y^3 + x^96*y + 2*x^104 + 2*x^96
```

This is actually expected because now  Singular's generic normalization algorithm is used while previously a custom implementation (in `ext/singular/function_field/core.lib`)of Leonard-Pellikaan-Singh-Swanson algorithm  specialized for finite field was used.

I think we should recover the previous algorithm for global function fields.

By the way, I get this timing on Mac pro

```
sage: k.<a>=GF(3^3)

```
5.08s is the timing I got more than two years ago on a slower  labtop. I wonder what have happened with sage meanwhile. Sigh..
