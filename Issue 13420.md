# Issue 13420: KeyError raised by GraphLatex.dot2tex_picture when edge_labels=True

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2012-10-19 09:03:36

Keywords: dot2tex

The following is ok :


```
sage: G = DiGraph()
sage: G.add_edge(3333, 88, 'my_label')
sage: opts = G.latex_options()
sage: opts.set_options(format='dot2tex')
sage: view(G)
```


but with `edges_labels=True` a KeyError is raised :


```

I managed to fix the bug with the following hack :


```diff
diff --git a/src/dot2tex/dot2tex.py b/src/dot2tex/dot2tex.py
--- a/src/dot2tex/dot2tex.py
+++ b/src/dot2tex/dot2tex.py
`@``@` -1153,6 +1153,20 `@``@` To see what happened, run dot2tex with t
         for name,item in usededges.items():
 
             edge = item
+            break
             hp,dp,wt = pp.texdims[name]
             xmargin, ymargin = self.get_margins(edge)
             labelcode = '<<<table border="0" cellborder="0" cellpadding="0">'\
```


but I still don't know what was this loop for... because the output is OK (with edge labels).

Hi SÃ©bastien,

I had not noticed this ticket. A quick and dirty workaround has been in the Sage-Combinat queue for some time. I did some further cleanup, but it's still nothing but a workaround. Shall we get it into Sage? If you think the patch could use more work, do you mind taking it over?

Cheers,
                                        Nicolas

While I was at it, I folded in a couple tests I had put in a later patch in the Sage-Combinat queue.


---

Comment by nthiery created at 2013-03-11 19:37:41

The change verb -> text in sage.misc.latex was breaking quite a few doctests. I made it a separate ticket: #14256. This one should not depend on it.

On the other hand, I added three tiny things that were in a later patch in the queue:
- shape=plain text whenever there are labels on the vertices (latex or not)
- trim "." from keys (I guess I must have had a problem with them at some point)
- a doctest fix.

Hi!

Yes, the graphviz spkg is broken (and as far as I can remember has always been). But most linux distro have a graphviz package, so that's not too bad. The doc already says to install graphviz out of Sage.

We should probably remove this broken spkg from "experimental" ...

who the hell put that in the doc without removing the package ?...

Indeed. The only thing to do is update the doc to remove any mention of this graphviz package, and ask Jeroen in a ticket to remove it from experimental.

And it will be quickly reviewed, I swear.

I was already careful *not* to mention the spkg in the doc (but if you see how to improve the graphviz installation instructions, please go ahead in a separate ticket; I'll review it).

As for removing the spkg, this is now: #14398.

Is written explicitly anywhere that there is no spkg and that the users should install it by themselves ?

It's written that the soft can be downloaded from the graphviz website. This seems explicit enough to me, but if you want to improve that, go ahead (but I would not speak of spkg at all).

Cool.

> See the method layout_graphviz in generic_graph.

Do we both agree that this is nowhere sufficient ?

Here is what happens when some code that requires graphviz (and which does not use layout_graphviz) is executed wihout graphviz installed 


```
sage: sage: import dot2tex                                                    # optional - dot2tex graphviz ## line 10 ##
sage: sage: output = dot2tex.dot2tex(graph, format="positions", prog="neato") # optional - dot2tex graphviz ## line 11 ##
ERROR    Could not locate Graphviz binaries
ERROR    Failed to create xdotdata. Is Graphviz installed?
ERROR    Failed to parse the input data. Is it a valid dot file?
Try to input xdot data directly. Example:
    dot -Txdot file.dot | dot2tex > file.tex

If this does not work, check that you have an updated version of PyParsing and
Graphviz. Users have reported problems with old versions. You can also run
dot2tex in debug mode using the --debug option:
    dot2tex --debug file.dot
A file dot2tex.log will be written to the current directory with detailed
information useful for debugging.
An exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback.

SystemExit: 1

To exit: use 'exit', 'quit', or Ctrl-D
```


The error message should redirect the user toward a way to install graphviz I guess. And I have never met "`SystemExit`"
By the way, do we really need pyparsing ? I thought this did not belong to Sage, and I needed it a couple of days ago.

I reset this ticket to `needs_work` because the doctests from two messages above still do not pass, even with graphviz installed.

This is a bug in dot2tex. It's fixed in the dev branch since two years. I was waiting the official release to make a new spkg, but it seems to be taking some time ...

Oh well, I uploaded my dev spkg and updated the instructions in #7004. And updated a bit the docstring in the patch as well.

Note: I had to wipe by hand the dot2tex directory before reinstalling dot2tex for things to work:

```
rm -rf /opt/sage-5.9.beta2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dot2tex
```

I agree this is ugly, but that's a problem with dot2tex, not with Sage
(feel free to report!). Any Sage code using dot2tex should call
assert_have_doc2tex.

> By the way, do we really need pyparsing ? I thought this did not

No clue.

Comment by slabbe created at 2013-04-02 16:49:16

Nicolas, could you add the following doctest to your patch to make sure the issue do not come up again in the future?


```
We make sure :trac:`13624` is fixed::

    sage: G = DiGraph()
    sage: G.add_edge(3333, 88, 'my_label')
    sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex')
    sage: G.set_latex_options(edge_labels=True)
    sage: G.latex_options().dot2tex_picture()  # optional - dot2tex graphviz
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    first_line?
    ...
    last_line?
    \end{tikzpicture}
```


I don't really know where to put the information about where and how to download graphviz and dot2tex. In fact, there are many entry points for the user:

 - `G.set_latex_options`
 - `G.latex_options`
 - `G.latex_options().dot2tex_picture`
 - `G.latex_options().set_option`    <- it might be strange, but a lot of doc is in here
 - `G.latex_options().set_options`
 - `G.latex_options().latex`

It is hard to know where the user will first have the idea that installing graphviz + dot2tex could be nice. Personnaly, I found once that information here :

 - `G.layout_graphviz?`

Here is what it says :


```
This requires "graphviz" and the "dot2tex" spkg. Here are some    
installation tips:                                                
                                                                  
   * Install graphviz >= 2.14 so that the programs dot, neato, ...
     are in your path. The graphviz suite can be download from    
     http://graphviz.org.                                         
                                                                  
   * Download dot2tex-2.8.?.spkg from                             
     http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/7004 and install it
     with "sage -i dot2tex-2.8.?.spkg"                            
```


This does not speak about any graphviz spkg. In fact, I did not know there was one. When I saw that doc in the past, I was then able to install graphviz properly.

The information about the dot2tex spgk is obsolete. I suggest to replace it by :


```
   * Get the name of the most recent version of dot2tex from
     the sage command ``optional_packages()``. Then,
     install it with ``sage -i dot2tex-2.8.?.spkg``. 
```

Sorry, I will propose a patch soon which apply on yours that will implement what I suggested. I can't do it now as the version of Sage I have now (sage-5.7.beta4) is too old: I get a conflict with the patch.

I think it is better not to update the old ticket #7004. Here is the link to the new spkg:


```
sage -f http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/dot2tex-2.8.7-dev.spkg

I just added a patch which fixes the broken doctests seen by the patchbot. I also added a doctest that make sure the issue of this ticket is solved. I also fixed an # optional - dot2tex, graphviz which was not up to date.

Finally I realize that some optional test are broken. Like this one that we can see in the doc of `layout_graphviz`. This may be considered in another ticket.


```
sage: g = digraphs.ButterflyGraph(2)
sage: g.plot(layout = "graphviz", prog = "neato") # optional - dot2tex, graphviz
Traceback (most recent call last): 
...

Thanks SÃ©bastien! I looked at your reviewer patch, and it looks good to me. Let's see what the patchbot says. Back to needs review for the first patch.

+1 since the tests were already failing before this ticket. This is
now #14408 which is about updating the dot2tex spkg.

For the record, current installation instructions for dot2tex are outdated (I tried the example from the description and it failed at first).

With the current patch at #14382, the example from the description does not give errors.

Adding a doctest to make sure the initial issue is fixed

Attachment

I just updated my patch which adds a doctest. Even if #14382 finally fix the problem, I think it could be merged anyway.

I removed the part that was fixing dot2tex optional doctests errors. I will move this part in another patch that I am going to post on #14408 where similar issues were discussed.

Feel free to give it a try and set to positive review - it is not big ;-)

Currently in `6.2.rc0`, the example given in the description works (probably from #14382):

```
sage: G = DiGraph()
sage: G.add_edge(333, 88, "my_label")
sage: G.set_latex_options(format="dot2tex", edge_labels=True)
sage: latex(G)

\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex,line join=bevel,]
%%
\node (node_1) at (11.000000bp,79.000000bp) [draw,draw=none] {$333$};
  \node (node_0) at (11.000000bp,7.000000bp) [draw,draw=none] {$88$};
  \draw [black,->] (node_1) ..controls (11.000000bp,61.481000bp) and (11.000000bp,39.548000bp)  .. (node_0);
  \definecolor{strokecol}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0};
  \pgfsetstrokecolor{strokecol}
  \draw (38.000000bp,43.000000bp) node {$\text{\texttt{my{\char`\_}label}}$};
%
\end{tikzpicture}
```

So how much of this ticket should we keep or should we just close as a "works-for-me"?

As I suggested in a previous comment, I think we could merge the patch `trac_13624-review-sl.patch` which simply adds a doctest.

I just converted my old hg patch to a git branch. It should be easy to review as it only adds a doctest since the problem was fixed by #14382.
