# Issue 33696: Remove quickref and tutorial from sage.combinat.all

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33933

Original creator: klee

Original creation time: 2022-05-29 10:58:30

There is no reason for quickref and tutorial to be in the global namespace. All we need is to be able to do sage.combinat? sage.combinat.tutorial? and sage.combinat.quickref?

Marking as critical because it restores the top-level `tutorial()` command, as noted somewhere
