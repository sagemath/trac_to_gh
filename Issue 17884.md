Various places in Sage need access to `PyTypeObject` members. There is currently no consistent way how this is done. I propose to just add the declarations to the Cython includes.

You are using

why is that? It is not supported in our Cython 0.22?

Why `void Py_VISIT(PyObject *o)` is not compatible with Cython? I do not quite understand what is this `__pyx_v_visit`. Is it because of Cython renaming arguments? If it is so, I do not find it very safe. Though, your version of `MonoDict_traverse` looks nicer.

Could you explain to me the reason of declaring

```
    int PyList_SetItem(object list, Py_ssize_t index, PyObject * item) except -1
```

and not use the `PyList_SetItem` from `cpython.lists` declared as `(object,Py_ssize_t,object)`? It would also be cool to add a comment if it is important to keep as such.

In `sage/structure/coerce_dict.pyx`, couldn't you get rid of

```
cdef extern from "Python.h":
    PyObject* PyWeakref_GetObject(object r)
```

It is in `cpython.weakref`.

Do you know why `Py_None` is not available from Cython?

Could we also remove or comment the `cpdef inline Py_ssize_t signed_id(x)`?

See its use in `extract_*` functions. It's handling `PyObject*` there and a cast to `object` would generate an INCREF (which is really not what you want to do in code that's just deleting things). This ticket doesn't affect that code.

So it is now! I don't think it was before.

> Do you know why `Py_None` is not available from Cython?

It is as "None", but then it's an `object`, and we need to compare it as a `PyObject *`. Cython's support for `PyObject *` (i.e., borrowed references) is poor -- basically intentionally so at the moment because a good interface (other than just the C interface) hasn't been formulated yet.

> Could we also remove or comment the `cpdef inline Py_ssize_t signed_id(x)`?

No objections to that.

How about generalizing the macro to accept `visit` and `arg` arguments?

Both questions have the same answer: using `PyObject*` instead of `object` is the right thing in this specific use case. Cython isn't wrong, it's just that we are doing very low-level stuff for which the standard Cython declarations don't work.

Yes, and that is the same signature as with which it is defined in `coerce_dict.pyx`. Apparently we're only dereferencing weakrefs we are actually owning (i.e., `object`s). Its return type is also correctly typed, since it returns a *borrowed* reference, so the normal use of storing the returned value into an `<object>` leads exactly to the INCREF required to ensure the object doesn't get deallocated.

I am pretty sure that if this is now available in cpython.weakref, we can cimport it from there rather than explicitly "cdef extern" it from "Python.h". Of course, there will be absolutely no difference to the eventual code generated either.

> this ticket was opened before 6.7

So what?  Besides that `vbraun_spam` appears to be on holidays since a while, certainly 6.6 got released before this ticket got closed.  (And it's based on 6.7.beta2.)

If someone sees a closed milestone on a (closed) ticket, the first guess is that it'd been merged into that release.

I'm certainly not the only one not wanting having to read the ticket history and/or to look up the parent(s) of the commit to find out whether that's true or not.

Especially "ordinary" Sage users simply won't do that, e.g. if they want to find out whether a bug has already been fixed, and if so, in which [stable] release.

Why?  (Pointer?)

If so, then at least the milestone should get corrected by the authors/reviewers or the RM before it gets closed.

But it's annoying to have open (new/needs review/whatever) tickets for already closed milestones; usual queries will no longer work (as expected).

The only thing one needs is a "spam" trac account... ;-)
