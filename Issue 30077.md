# Issue 30077: p-adic nth-root fails for some extensions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30314

Original creator: alexjbest

Original creation time: 2020-08-07 18:17:41

CC:  edgarcosta @rbommel

Keywords: padics,root

The following fails

```
sage: K = Qp(29)
sage: x = polygen(K)
sage: L.<a> = K.extension(x^2 -29)
sage: L(4).nth_root(2)
```

due to the fact that `_primitive_qth_root_of_unity(v)` returns Nones when `v` is 0.
