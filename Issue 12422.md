Here's a test failure with beta5 which I don't think I have seen
before.  Build from scratch on 32-bit ubuntu, gcc 4.4.3.  Only
numerical fuzz but still...

"devel/sage/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx"
sage -t --long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/stats/hmm/chmm.pyx"

Applied the the previously offending build of 5.0.beta5, this works fine.
