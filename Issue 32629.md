Looks good to me. Doctests pass. Patchbot is green. The coverage is not 100% because of few docstring missing in staticmethods `__classcall__` but these are doctested in the doc of the the class just above. So, LGTM. I tested the functionnality. In particular, I get:


```
sage: from sage.features.interfaces import all_features
sage: [(f,f.is_present()) for f in all_features()]
[(Feature('magma'), FeatureTestResult('magma', False)),
 (Feature('matlab'), FeatureTestResult('matlab', False)),
 (Feature('mathematica'), FeatureTestResult('mathematica', False)),
 (Feature('maple'), FeatureTestResult('maple', False)),
 (Feature('macaulay2'), FeatureTestResult('macaulay2', False)),
 (Feature('octave'), FeatureTestResult('octave', True)),
 (Feature('scilab'), FeatureTestResult('scilab', False))]
```

which is sometimes True and sometimes False. Therefore, the routine works.
