Keywords: list_plot3d

1. `list_plot3d` plots extra points at the horizontal x-y plane. This seems to stem from the default value of 0.0 that is assigned in the code. See [this post](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/RAdolRdjSTk/discussion).

2. This function also does not take in `color` or `rgbcolor` as keywords. Rest of the plot commands including `plot`, `list_plot`, `plot3d` do take in these keywords.

I like this idea, but have a couple questions.

Actually, `color` and the other keywords will never override `texture`. `color` will be used only when `texture` is not present, and `color` is present. As it is setup, if `texture` is provided, then the others should be ignored. Actually, maybe we should do this explicitly and remove the other keywords if they are present. Something like

```
if texture == 'automatic':
    if 'color' in kwds:
        texture = kwds.pop('color')
        if 'rgbcolor' in kwds:
            del kwds['rgbcolor']
     ...
texture = rgbcolor(texture)
if 'color' in kwds:
    del kwds['color']
...
```

Does that sound reasonable?

> * Do you have any idea what the original default `0.0` was supposed to have done in the past (say, for an empty plot)?  I'm not suggesting you know, and I did read your very sensible post, but I'm just curious for any ideas you may have.

I have no idea why this was done. Was it some bug in matplotlib earlier? Was it just an oversight? For an empty plot, I suppose you would not want there to be plot points at 0.0!

Sorry for the inaccuracy, of course that is what I meant.

Yes, as long as we document it.  We do similar things lots of other places.

Hmm, looking at your plots from the post, I think I know.  The idea was probably to have the `list_plot` cause a list to be plotted and then have the plot be zero elsewhere.  Then there is the weird interpolation thing going on.  Anyway, this makes things interpretable, though I'm not sure the original was really that useful, due to the output.  I wonder who has used this in the past...

Okay, I think this idea is okay.  William says to defer to what Mathematica appears to do, since this is where the function was inspired, many years ago.

```
There will be holes in the surface corresponding to array elements that do not represent explicit height values.
```

And see [here](http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/ListPlot3D.html), the second example - clearly not continued beyond the three points given.

But I can't get it to work.

sage: list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)], color='black')

None of these really seemed to look like what I wanted, or even sometimes to have anything plot.  Am I using this incorrectly?

I'm going to upload a patch clarifying what it actually does, which is not intuitive at all.\n\nAs for the issue you are seeing, I think it's very interesting.  Notice that the box that comes up *does* have the right dimensions to incorporate all three points, even when you don't specify `num_points`!\n\nHere is what is going on - I've printed out the `vals`.  All those `nan` guys will lead to not much of a plot.\n\n```\nsage: sage: list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],interpolation_type='linear')\n[[ -1.00000000e+00              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]\n [             nan   6.66133815e-16              nan              nan               nan              nan]\n [             nan              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]\n [             nan              nan              nan   2.00000000e+00               nan              nan]\n [             nan              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]\n [             nan              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]]\n```\n\nSo you pick your poison here.  Either you get something that does have the right points, but then also has everything else be extended by zero, or you don't do that, but the algorithm fails in certain cases.

It turns out that the documentation for what this function actually does is *insanely* bad.  I'm going to upload a patch clarifying what it actually does, which is not intuitive at all.

As for the issue you are seeing, I think it's very interesting.  Notice that the box that comes up *does* have the right dimensions to incorporate all three points, even when you don't specify `num_points`!

Here is what is going on - I've printed out the `vals`.  All those `nan` guys will lead to not much of a plot.

```
sage: sage: list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],interpolation_type='linear')
[[ -1.00000000e+00              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]
 [             nan   6.66133815e-16              nan              nan               nan              nan]
 [             nan              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]
 [             nan              nan              nan   2.00000000e+00               nan              nan]
 [             nan              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]
 [             nan              nan              nan              nan               nan              nan]]
```

So you pick your poison here.  Either you get something that does have the right points, but then also has everything else be extended by zero, or you don't do that, but the algorithm fails in certain cases.  This will happen whenever the "box" in question is a lot bigger than the projection of the actual points to the xy-plane.

```
sage: sage: list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)]) # bad
sage: sage: list_plot3d([(0,5,1), (5,5,4), (-1,-5,-1)]) # good
```


I'm good with your work.  If you like my changes, sign off as a reviewer and we'll get this in.

3. Third, with `f.default_value = float('inf')`, and otherwise the patches in this ticket are still applied, i.e., the extra examples are still present.

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Finally, with all the patches unapplied. This is vanilla sage-5.2.alpha0 and hence the examples introduced by the patches in this ticket are not present.

```

popping trac_12798-fix_extraneous_points_and_kwds_in_list_plot3d.patch

	 [6.3 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 6.3 seconds
```

Note that correct plots are generated only by 1. and 3. At least on this machine, both 1. and 3. are faster than the code already present in vanilla sage-5.2.alpha0. It is only the example with `num_points=400` that introduces the slowdown.

So, I am attaching an updated patch which reduces the `num_points`. Here is the time taken for this new one. Notice that the time taken is *lower* than the vanilla sage-5.2.alpha0, even though the number of examples doctested has increased.

It is confusing alright. I am getting speedups on intel but you are getting slowdowns on sparc. Sorry for bothering you so much. Can you do the following test since you have access to the sparc:
1. Change line 467 and 488 of [attachment:12798_change.patch] with the following version and check if it is still slow.

That is a good question.  You can check it out in the code, there is some stuff in graphics.py or plot.py with `DOCTEST_MODE`.  Computing the plot objects is very fast, you are right.  And plot3d of course is even different from that.

I guess the method `sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface.ParametricSurface.triangulate()` should be fixed not to add any faces of which the coordinates are not all finite numbers.  However, I'm having a hard time understanding that method.

Because now we are sending a list of faces to be plotted full of `NaN`s:

```
sage: G = list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (2,3,4), (-1,-1,-1)],num_points=100)

`@`jdemeyer: can you test the [attachment:trac_12798-dont_pass_nan_to_ParametricSurface.patch new patch] I have put up. I prevent `nan`s from being passed on to the `ParametricSurface` class. Since I based it on 5.1beta5 (don't have 5.2alpha0 at home right now), you may apply the previous two patches (either ours, or yours) and then apply this new patch.

Why I opted for this - modifying `ParametricSurface` has a high probability of introducing more bugs than fixing the one already present. If we modify it, then one option is to put checks for nan or inf in line 588 (as of the 5.1beta5) of `parametric_surface.pyx`

```
                    res.x, res.y, res.z = self.f(uu, vv)
```

But doing so implies that we also need to modify `urange, vrange, n` and `m` in that file, and I believe that this requires a major editing of the code.

It seemed better/safer to actually modify `list_plot3d` instead of `ParametricSurface`.

There should be no `nan`s in that list.

This is because we trim the x and y values. Without the third patch, the earlier patches in this ticket actually gives a correct plot (even for such a low value of `num_points=5`).\n\nAs for the presence of `nan`s. This is all correct and there is no contradiction or error here. If you look at what is going on, there is a matrix being created called `vals` which contains all possible z values corresponding to `x in xvals` and `y in yvals` which should appear in our 3D plot. In the simple example above, `xvals = [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]` and `yvals` is the same. So **all** possible points `(x,y)` with `x` and `y` taking values from `xvals` and `yvals`, respectively, is the cartesian product `xvals x yvals` and it will will include points like `(0.75, 0.75)` or `(0.75, 1)`, etc, which should have no corresponding finite value in `vals`. All these values in the matrix are set to `nan`. Prior to this ticket, they were being set to 0.\n\nSo, every time the ranges of `x` and `y` do not form a square, there will be `nan`s in the matrix `vals`, and this can not be avoided if you want an accurate plot. So, it is pointless to try and remove `nan`s.\n\nSo now, the question is, why does `ParametricSurface` take so much time only during the doctests and only on Solaris arch. I don't know the answer, and the code in that class (and in `IndexFace`, etc) is too complex for me and not very well documented.\n\nAt this point, what I suggest is to merge the changes regarding the colors, and leave the `list_plot3d` alone.

I had a fresh look at this ticket. The last patch that I posted which trims the `xvals` and `yvals` on the basis of whether there are `nan`s or not, is actually incorrect. This can be tested on a simple 3D plot:

```
list_plot3d([(0,0,1), (1,0,0), (0,1,0)], num_points=5)
```

The output is a square instead of a triangle and the square persists even for `num_points=100`. This is because we trim the x and y values. Without the third patch, the earlier patches in this ticket actually gives a correct plot (even for such a low value of `num_points=5`).

As for the presence of `nan`s. This is all correct and there is no contradiction or error here. If you look at what is going on, there is a matrix being created called `vals` which contains all possible z values corresponding to `x in xvals` and `y in yvals` which should appear in our 3D plot. In the simple example above, `xvals = [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]` and `yvals` is the same. So **all** possible points `(x,y)` with `x` and `y` taking values from `xvals` and `yvals`, respectively, is the cartesian product `xvals x yvals` and it will will include points like `(0.75, 0.75)` or `(0.75, 1)`, etc, which should have no corresponding finite value in `vals`. All these values in the matrix are set to `nan`. Prior to this ticket, they were being set to 0.

So, every time the ranges of `x` and `y` do not form a square, there will be `nan`s in the matrix `vals`, and this can not be avoided if you want an accurate plot. So, it is pointless to try and remove `nan`s.

So now, the question is, why does `ParametricSurface` take so much time only during the doctests and only on Solaris arch. I don't know the answer, and the code in that class (and in `IndexFace`, etc) is too complex for me and not very well documented.

At this point, what I suggest is to merge the changes regarding the colors, and leave the `list_plot3d` alone. If it sounds reasonable, then I will open a new ticket regarding the colors and leave this ticket for the future, when the Solaris arch goes out of fashion!

Nan is the standard to denote missing floating point values and should be used. It is IEEE standard and perfectly portable across all architectures where you can reasonably expect to get an accurate answer for floating point operations.
