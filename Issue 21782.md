Why don't you change `_cmp_` to `_richcmp_` here?

Because here (like in #22013), `_cmp_` is called indirectly by `_richcmp`.

Could we please get try to move on here, and in the similar #22013, so that we can then try to attack the question of `_cmp_` and `_richcmp` inside Parent ?

Hmm, maybe the NotImplemented in #21971 was an error. Anyway, here it is not allowed by the type of the `_cmp_`function, so arbitrary -1 is the only option.

I would like this one to go in also, even if it is only a partial progress.

Recall that my current aim is to cythonize every pyx file in python3, and for that one has to remove all cmp() in pyx files.

This will work for now. Since these are parents, they probably should just use `__richcmp__` directly, but that can be an issue for another day.
