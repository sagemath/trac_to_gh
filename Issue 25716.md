Could someone please take a look at this? Matplotlib is not working on my installation of Sage, so I don't know whether the failed doctests are due to a compiling error on my end or if it's a problem with my code.

The issue is that without any additional parameters, graphics_array() expects all lists in the meta-list to be the same size. 

I believe you can get around this by keeping track of the largest orbit size, and then passing the argument `ncols=max_orbit_size` to graphics_array, and it will pad any shorter orbits with empty plots. I don't think you also need to pass an explicit nrows, but who knows.

Better solution might be to modify graphics_array so that by default, if it has lists of different sizes, it will find the largest one and set that to be ncols().

Code looks good to me, also built the html doc and it looks good (though I realized other doc doesn't properly link to order_ideal_toggle and order_ideal_toggles since they live in different files...but that's a separate ticket).

I'm wondering whether this need to be its own function, or if it might be better to have an optional ``plot=False'' parameter for the rowmotion_orbits() and toggling_orbits() function.

A second thing to consider would be making a more robust and general `orbits()` type method where you input a set and a bijective action, and it will generate the orbits, and additionally have an optional plot parameter which would create the graphics array. But that might be a future ticket.

> I'm wondering whether this need to be its own function, or if it might be better to have an optional `plot=False` parameter for the `rowmotion_orbits()` and `toggling_orbits()` function.

I think it is better (in this case) that they are separate functions as it is better separation-of-concerns.

> A second thing to consider would be making a more robust and general `orbits()` type method where you input a set and a bijective action, and it will generate the orbits, and additionally have an optional plot parameter which would create the graphics array. But that might be a future ticket.

I think this would be a very good followup ticket (something that is going to be very useful for the general audience). That also can have a `plot` version that abstracts the code in these methods.
