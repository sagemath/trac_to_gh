Keywords: order ideal, rowmotion, sagedays@icerm

Add a method for displaying the Hasse diagram of a poset with the elements of a specific order ideal highlighted, as well as the same feature for orbits of rowmotion and other toggling orbits.

Could someone please take a look at this? Matplotlib is not working on my installation of Sage, so I don't know whether the failed doctests are due to a compiling error on my end or if it's a problem with my code.

I'll look at it.

I get two type errors, it says that GraphicsArray() needs a list of lists of Graphics objects.

The issue is that without any additional parameters, graphics_array() expects all lists in the meta-list to be the same size. 

I believe you can get around this by keeping track of the largest orbit size, and then passing the argument `ncols=max_orbit_size` to graphics_array, and it will pad any shorter orbits with empty plots. I don't think you also need to pass an explicit nrows, but who knows.

Better solution might be to modify graphics_array so that by default, if it has lists of different sizes, it will find the largest one and set that to be ncols().

Thanks for the comments, Kevin. I made the fix and fixed the doctests as well. Also, my sage is working now, so I can see the graphics objects and all tests now pass for me.

Code looks good to me, also built the html doc and it looks good (though I realized other doc doesn't properly link to order_ideal_toggle and order_ideal_toggles since they live in different files...but that's a separate ticket).

I'm wondering whether this need to be its own function, or if it might be better to have an optional ``plot=False'' parameter for the rowmotion_orbits() and toggling_orbits() function.

A second thing to consider would be making a more robust and general `orbits()` type method where you input a set and a bijective action, and it will generate the orbits, and additionally have an optional plot parameter which would create the graphics array. But that might be a future ticket.

Replying to [comment:8 kdilks]:
> I'm wondering whether this need to be its own function, or if it might be better to have an optional `plot=False` parameter for the `rowmotion_orbits()` and `toggling_orbits()` function.

I think it is better (in this case) that they are separate functions as it is better separation-of-concerns.

I think this would be a very good followup ticket (something that is going to be very useful for the general audience). That also can have a `plot` version that abstracts the code in these methods.
