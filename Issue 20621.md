# Issue 20621: Option to combine symbolic fractions recursively

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2016-06-21 07:50:24

Maxima combines fractions only on the top level, not recursively:

```
sage: 1/x + 1/x^2 + (x+1)/x
(x + 1)/x + 1/x + 1/x^2
sage: (1/x + 1/x^2 + (x+1)/x).combine()
(x + 2)/x + 1/x^2
sage: (1/x + (1/x+1/x^2+(x+1)/x)/x^2 + (x+1)/x).combine()
(x + 2)/x + ((x + 1)/x + 1/x + 1/x^2)/x^2
```

This is implemented in Pynac master. Corresponding Sage Python and doctests are in the pynac/sage github branch.

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
