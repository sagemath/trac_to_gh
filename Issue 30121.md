On Debian 10 "buster": `make testlong`: All tests passed!

Anything to test in particular?

Changing keywords from "" to "upgrade, matplotlib, certifi".

Visual inspection of graphics, for example in the built manual, would help - because this is something that our testsuite cannot do

I did a little spot-checking, both the reference manual and some plots by hand, and everything looks good.
