* would be much better not to check for the explicit value of hash, that is no longer deterministic and depend on 32 vs 64 bits

I would suggest to take another element in the same group and check it has another hash.

Same thing for the second part of the doctest, check that the sorted lists are not the same, or maybe simply just that the same word gives different hashes in different groups.

* please add one missing empty line after the first line of the doc

Sorry I didn't get a chance to comment on this before the positive review (I was asleep), but I would make the hash faster and more safe against overflow errors by

```
return hash((self._parent,) + tuple(self._reduced_word))
```

or

```
return hash(self._parent) | hash(tuple(self._reduced_word))
```

If you have the parent as part of the hash, there is no need to include the map to the index set for the reduced word.
