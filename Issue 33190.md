Many patchbots can not pass the `9.6.beta3` release because of some new doctest introduced in #33388, see https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/0/

The failing doctest is:


```
File "src/sage/graphs/graph.py", line 8586, in sage.graphs.graph.Graph.effective_resistance
Failed example:
    H.effective_resistance(1, 5, base_ring=RDF)
Expected:
    1.20000...
Got:
    1.1999999999999997
```

It shouldn't, RDF numbers are coded on 64 bits and have 53bits of precision on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
