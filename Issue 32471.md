# Issue 32471: sage.tensor.modules: remove dependency on sage.manifolds

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32708

Keywords: tensor display

In view of Sage modularization, this ticket removes the only import from `sage.manifolds` in the module `sage.tensor.modules`. 
This was an import of `Chart` in `FreeModuleTensor._preparse_display`. This is avoided by reimplementing `_preparse_display` in `TensorFieldParal`.
