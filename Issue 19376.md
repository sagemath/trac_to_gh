This is promising to be really useful!

A few first impressions (Sage is compiling doc, so I can't really edit):

Can you document the `left_repr` keyword in the `regular_representation` method in `semigroups.py`?

In the `_acted_upon_` of `TrivialRepresentation`, I would use a `sum` method instead of the `sum` function (I hope it would involve less indirection/ducktyping).

Does the `RegularRepresentation` allow both multiplying by elements of the semigroup and multiplying by elements of the semigroup algebra? (And if so, please doctest both.)

I have recently wrotten some really sloppy code to build a finite semigroup out of a multiplication table (I hoped to use it on #19892, but then I found that semigroups lack the support for that, so I ended up avoiding it). I'm wondering -- would this be useful for this patch? At the very least it could give us a way to doctest the methods.

Yes, and I added some doctests about this. I also caught a few bugs with these doctests.

There is code in `algebras/finite_dimensional_algebras` which essentially does that. We probably could separate that code into the semigroup part and the algebra part (and combine it with your code).

Hmm, I really need to get my pile of semigroup code into Sage. But this should not stop you from making progress in the mean time. In case you'd have the occasion to spend a couple days in Paris, I'd be happy to do a coding sprint with you on this topic.

For building a variety of semigroups, you can use `sage.monoids.automatic_semigroup.AutomaticSemigroup`.

For info: I am currently working on an improved GAP-Sage interface allowing to easily wrap all kind of GAP parents, including semigroups:

OK, weird. Why do you call it `left` one time and `left_repr` another? Also, it is still undocumented one time in `semigroups.py` (there are two `regular_representation` methods in that file; sorry for missing that).

Ah, you're perfectly right.

I guess you're right -- groups are probably enough for doctesting.

I am aware of `algebras/finite_dimensional_algebras` being essentially the linear version of what I wanted to do. (This is what I ended up using in #19892, since I really cared about the face semigroup algebra, not the face semigroup.) Still I wanted the non-linear version, since having a semigroup algebra without its semigroup looks really weird.

Nicolas, is this something you have in your code?

`@`darij Now both methods use `left` and are documented.

What I am suggesting is refactor the multiplication code for the fin-dim algebras into a finite semigroup (well, really finite magma because the product does not have to be associative). Then we would make a fin-dim algebra to be the algebra of a finite semigroup (magma).

`@`nthiery I will should have some time before (and I think after but need to double-check) Days 74, and I would be happy to do some coding sprints with you.

PS - How were the Sage-GAP days?

I've reviewed the ticket up to `TrivialRepresentation`. However, exposing `self._module` the way I've done it is incompatible with your implementation of `TrivialRepresentation`, and this is a design question I feel is in need of discussion. What do you think is the right way?

1. Unexpose `self._module`, since any method that uses linear algebra on `self._module` can just as well use it on `self`.

2. Set `self._module = self` for a `TrivialRepresentation`.

3. Implement `TrivialRepresentation` using the general `Representation` constructor.

I don't see anything wrong with either of these options, but I am not the one to judge. A caveat with 1 is that coders need to be dissuaded from using `self._module` in their code (and this is a tricky thing to do, because not everyone will have a `TrivialRepresentation` in their doctests). Option 2 might incur endless loops or unwanted memory persistence, but I don't know. Option 3 feels like overkill, but it's the most straightforward thing.

Speaking of endless loops, do you have an idea why this gives one?

```
sage: G = groups.permutation.Dihedral(4)
sage: R = G.regular_representation(left=False)
sage: x = R.an_element()
sage: x*x
```


Oh, and one more thing. I think `TrivialRepresentation` might need a `left` option. Even if the action itself doesn't care, future code might (e.g., taking the direct sum of two representations might start off by checking whether both have the same left-right-ness, and tada you've got a pointless error when you try to add a right representation to the trivial one).

I did not expose it because the representation behaves like a module (you better not say something about ducktyping here) and it is there only for internal use. You're getting to one of the reasons why `TrivialRepresentation` is not a subclass of `Representation`. If you really feel that it should be exposed, then I would have `module()` return `self` so there is a consistent API.

Even if the action itself doesn't care, future code might (e.g., taking the direct sum of two representations might start off by checking whether both have the same left-right-ness, and tada you've got a pointless error when you try to add a right representation to the trivial one).\n\nIf future code cares, then the future code can deal with creating the error/extra complexity. However, we can consider it as simultaneously a right and left representation, so I don't think this would be an issue.\n\nActually, given these recent changes, it reminded me why I had `left_repr`.

Thank you for doing the review. (I guess I should review your face semigroup ticket...)

I would go with 1. I did not expose it because the representation behaves like a module (you better not say something about ducktyping here) and it is there only for internal use. You're getting to one of the reasons why `TrivialRepresentation` is not a subclass of `Representation`. If you really feel that it should be exposed, then I would have `module()` return `self` so there is a consistent API. (Unfortunately I don't think we have the infrastructure in place to setup the necessary coercions.)

No, and from the code, there does not seem to be a reason why this should happen. (This should result in an error though.) I will investigate this.

> Oh, and one more thing. I think `TrivialRepresentation` might need a `left` option. Even if the action itself doesn't care, future code might (e.g., taking the direct sum of two representations might start off by checking whether both have the same left-right-ness, and tada you've got a pointless error when you try to add a right representation to the trivial one).

If future code cares, then the future code can deal with creating the error/extra complexity. However, we can consider it as simultaneously a right and left representation, so I don't think this would be an issue.

Actually, given these recent changes, it reminded me why I had `left_repr`. I actually think `left_repr` is more descriptive, and so we should change all of the `left` to `left_repr`. Your thoughts?

I think that's already (almost) done, but thank you :)

Wait, what? `TrivialRepresentation` does not inherit from `Representation`? This I really don't like. Particularly if you don't expose `self._module`, there should be no reason to keep the trivial one out of it.

I have thought about these things again and here are my suggestions:

S1. It is fine for `Representation` to treat `self._module` as an implementation detail that might not get inherited, but please document this in the `init` sourcecode (just a # comment saying that `self._module` might not exist).

S2. Please document in the docstring that the trivial representation is both left and right.

S3. At some point we will need a way to tell if a given representation is left or right. I think this should be a property (not underscored) which is a boolean or `None` (for two-sided). Do you agree?

S4. In the `_acted_upon_` of `TrivialRepresentation`, does `_from_dict(d)` do the right thing when `d == 0` ?

Agreed -- just wanting it to be explicit.

I'm fine with `left_repr` or with anything, as long as it is the same keyword everywhere.

Will do.

If anything, this should be a method, not an (hidden) attribute. However, I do agree we need something. Althought AFAIK this is the first time we have a left but not necessarily a right module.

This will never happen as `monomial_coefficients` returns a `dict`. However, I do see a potential when acting on the zero element. I will check/doctest this.

(I'm waiting for `7.1.beta1` to come out before I make any changes. You know as soon as I bump my Sage to beta0, beta1 will be released...)

Just a tiny comment: please use side="left" rather than left=True, for consistency with what's done elsewhere (Coxeter groups, cayley graphs, ...).
