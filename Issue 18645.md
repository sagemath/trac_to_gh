What does "retrying" refer to?

Does it pass if you just rerun the test suite (as opposed to rebuilding and retuning in advance)?

OK so with clang I can now reproduce the issue at will on linux (contrary to my last post). After exploring building and testing manually I finally discovered the tuning section of `spkg-install`

```

    "full")
        echo "Complete tuning of gf2x."
        $MAKE tune-lowlevel && $MAKE tune-toom && $MAKE tune-fft
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error: Failed to tune gf2x."
            exit 1
        fi
        ;;
    "no")
        echo "Skipping tuning of gf2x."
        echo "You can set SAGE_TUNE_GF2X to yes or full to turn it on."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Fast tuning of gf2x."
        echo "You can set SAGE_TUNE_GF2X to full to run a complete tuning."
        $MAKE tune-lowlevel && $MAKE tune-toom TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error: Failed to tune gf2x."
            exit 1
        fi
        ;;
esac
```

When `SAGE_TUNE_GF2X` is set to `no` the test suite pass. When set to full, the clang build breaks when doing `$MAKE tune-fft` which will be a separate issue. So I toyed with what is applied in the "fast tuning". With
* `$MAKE tune-lowlevel` testsuite pass
* `$MAKE tune-lowlevel && $MAKE tune-toom TOOM_TUNING_LIMIT=100` testsuite breaks as above
* `$MAKE tune-lowlevel && $MAKE tune-toom` breaks as above
So it looks like in some circumstance the `tune-toom` tuning leads to a subtle breakage.

maybe we should make a new release, since we have fixed several bugs in 1.1.
When `tune-toom` fails, please can you send me (privately) the result of `tune-lowlevel`?

I can reproduce all that tomorrow and send it to you privately I guess. On my system I can generate the failure with clang (but the failure is not specific to clang since this was spotted before anyone was toying with it) but things work with gcc so I could even give you a good set of toom tuning and a bad one.

my guess is that with clang the basic routines chosen by `tune-lowlevel` are different from those chosen by gcc, and `tune-toom` hits a bug in one of those routines, which was fixed in the development version.

Hum...doing `sage -f gf2x` rebuilt without issue (with [limited?] tuning after the first build without any tuning). So I can no longer reproduce the build failure I was getting. At least Paul seems to have found a fix.

I am trying to create the patch:

And as you see from the log, it is getting applied (and I inspect the source after the package building ends in error, I see it applied).
But I absolutely do not understand why this does not work, as I get exactly the same error:

```

```


Please advise - it looks as if some weirdness is going on I don't get.

Replying to [comment:38 zimmerma]:

`./sage -i gf2x` does an installation from scratch, no?! See the top part of the log...

it was `lt-tunetoom` linked against a previous version of `libgf2x.so` in `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/`. 

This is something I would call a bug in `gf2x`, as you cannot guarantee that `libgf2x.so` unique on the system---you really have to make sure you tune what you're installing, not something else...

Anyhow, all good now.
