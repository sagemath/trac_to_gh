As per #16023 comment 8. kcrisman writes:

The Bessel functions weren't removed that long ago, and note that there is a LOT more to be removed - namely, the whole underscore versions of them, see https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/functions/bessel.py?id=9db8c5c598ec9de953a33b14e531bee3c092c199#n1102 - basically to the end of the document.

This was originally deprecated in #4102, I believe; if we give it a year, which seems the least one could do here, looks like sometime late summer 2014 should be a good time to do this.

Was merged into #16737, so it's a duplicate now.

That said, I don't have a problem with these commits, they look ready to go if everything passes tests, which I'll check once that's resolved.

Sorry, let me clarify; the first commit is in that ticket, but the (very useful) other two ones are not.   I guess some rebase or something would be needed but otherwise as long as it applies and passes tests this could have positive review!

No sorry, I'm quite sure all of this is in #16737.

Ah, #16737... sorry, I was looking at #16023 where it was originally proposed to remove these guys.  My apologies, 

I have to say it is annoying to have two different things all in that one ticket though.  Since you merged this branch into that one, I am going to prefer to review these changes here and those changes there.  It's not that huge of a patch, but it's still better to separate such development into little chunks, at least for my (slow) workflow.

And now you upgraded #16737 to 6.4.beta0 which I haven't built yet ;-) so it will take a little longer for that one.
