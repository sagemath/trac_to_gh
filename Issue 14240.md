First draft of this patch.  Still needs to be better documented and streamlined.  For instance, currently, creating primitive period 1 quivers by going through matrices instead of directly through digraph.  But, the examples appear to work.  Although sign convention should be double-checked.

Should other types such as quivers associated to other Brane Tilings, like dP3, F0, etc. also be hard-coded?

An update to this patch will come in the next few days, but should be working for now.

This patch has now been updated and works directly with digraphs as opposed to matrices.

It also automatically re-interprets the primitive period 1 quivers as the associated affine A quivers.

A future ticket or patch will possible include general period 1 quivers or other quivers from Brane Tilings.


Should be ready for review now.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

It was not necessary to replace the duplicate/unused patch by an empty patch. You can give instructions for the bot in comments, as follows:

apply trac_14444-Period-Quivers.patch

then the bot will only apply this patch.

One remark: 

For links to arxiv, you should use the arxiv role, like for example `:arxiv:`0904.0200``

Examples need to be slightly updated so that Period 1 Primitives recongized as Affine A when QuiverMutationType(['P1',n,k]) is called.  

Also, would be good for interface to input classes for other period 1 quivers in this patch rather than a future patch.

Gregg, would you agree to try to get that into sage, keeping further changes for another ticket ?

Frederic, I am still interested in getting this into sage.  I have a SAGE research assistant this semester who should have time to do this if I don't have a chance to get to this first.  What did you mean exactly by "further changes"?  Are you recommending I open a new ticket regarding implementing these quivers?

Well, there is already something about Gale-Robinson here.

And I have also made (somewhat abusing the ticket's goal) a lot of disturbing typographical/cleanup changes in the rest of the code. It would be better to get rid of that by quick inclusion in sage, so that one can start again and have cleaner tickets. 
Anyway, there is a risk of conflict with the other ticket about cluster for triangulated surfaces.

I think if we want to fast track this into sage, it should be updated (if needed) to make sure that a single primitive period 1 quiver is not a new quiver mutation class but is recgonized as an affine type A quiver (or multiple copies of one).  Potentially only the doctests need to be updated.

If I had more time, I would develop new quiver mutation classes for more complicated period 1 quives by adding/subtracting primitive period 1 quivers appropriately.  The Gale-Robinson case is essentially the case of this with two such period 1 primitives (plus the necessary fudge factor).  Or by allowing the user to input a palindromic integer vector and build the rest of the period 1 quiver from the first row of the exchange matrix.

As far as you know, do these two patches still work in the current sage?  If so, we can change this from needs work to needs review.

I could open up a separate ticket for the period 1 functionalities.
