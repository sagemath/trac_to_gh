how about

```diff

+++ b/build/pkgs/ipykernel/dependencies
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-$(PYTHON) | ipython jupyter_client $(PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN) scandir

 ----------
 All lines of this file are ignored except the first.

Perhaps a separate issue but html docs for `9.5.beta1` will not build without `debugpy`.

```
cd /local/sage-git/sage && ./sage --docbuild --no-pdf-links reference/repl inventory --no-prune-empty-dirs
Warning: Could not import sage.repl.ipython_kernel.kernel No module named 'debugpy'
[repl     ] building [inventory]: targets for 36 source files that are out of date

[repl     ] WARNING: autodoc: failed to import module 'kernel' from module 'sage.repl.ipython_kernel'; the following exception was raised:
[repl     ] No module named 'debugpy'
[repl     ] The inventory files are in local/share/doc/sage/inventory/en/reference/repl.
Error building the documentation.
```

and

```

The updated dependencies for `ipykernel` do allow the docs to build.
