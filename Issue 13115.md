Keywords: GCC spkg CPP FC F77 F95 Fortran compiler preprocessor sage-env

Currently only `CC` and `CXX` get modified (in `spkg/bin/sage-env`) if Sage's GCC spkg is installed (more precisely, if `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/{gcc,g++}` are present).

We should also set / override `CPP` and (at least) also various commonly-used Fortran compiler variables to make sure the versions from *Sage's* GCC installation get used, since the user may have specified these, and the build might break (due to mixing different compiler versions).  (As an example, building ECL currently fails if `$CPP` finds `ffi.h` although it is not really installed system-wide, but rather only in e.g. `/usr/lib/<ARCH>/<$CPP's version>/include/`; see [comment:ticket:13150:5] ff.)

> exporting `CPP` when it's not necessarily defined doesn't look like a good idea.

Hmmm.  If it's not already defined, exporting it has no effect.  It may be (defined and) empty, but in that case it originates from the "global" environment, i.e., has been set to `""` (and already exported) by the user, which is certainly wrong.   

Any reason it doesn't get a default value if it's not already set in `sage-env` (like `CC`, but also `AR`, `RANLIB` etc.)?

I could either add the latter, or maybe only export `CPP` if we set it there (`if [ -x ... ]`).


The whole thing looks a bit inconsistent, but spkgs may rely on the other variables being defined, so I'd prefer to also let `CPP` always have a value.
