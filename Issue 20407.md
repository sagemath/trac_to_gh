# Issue 20407: Disable fragile sagedev tests

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20644

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2016-05-21 10:23:50

Various sage.dev tests are fragile and depend on details of the git version and/or configuration. A number of buildbots are now failing with

```
sage -t --long src/sage/dev/git_interface.py  # 8 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/dev/patch.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/dev/sagedev.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
