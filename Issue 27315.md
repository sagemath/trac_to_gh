The internal description of an element of QQbar can be quite complicated. To get some insights a method for showing this structure is provided.

I don't think that starting to spoil all Sage classes with `_structure_str_oneline_` is a good idea. If you intend to start anything like that, there must be a debate on sage-devel.

On the other hand, many people already expressed their wishes to have integers printed as `ZZ:3` and rationals as `QQ:3` (or possibly `QQ:3/1`). This is somehow duplicating this possible feature.

Though I am very much in favor of having a consistent access to the tree structure for `SR` and `QQbar`.

Tickets still needing working or clarification should be moved to the next release milestone at the soonest (please feel free to revert if you think the ticket is close to being resolved).

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.

Sorry, that was a wring number in `git trac push`!
