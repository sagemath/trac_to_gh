I don't think that starting to spoil all Sage classes with `_structure_str_oneline_` is a good idea. If you intend to start anything like that, there must be a debate on sage-devel.

On the other hand, many people already expressed their wishes to have integers printed as `ZZ:3` and rationals as `QQ:3` (or possibly `QQ:3/1`). This is somehow duplicating this possible feature.
