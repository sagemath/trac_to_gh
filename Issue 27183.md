What the changes in `sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/period_lattice.py` have to do with the cypari upgrade? If this is fixing a bug, it would better be documented.

The handing of precision in `omega()` changed: now the precision is taken from the `ellinit()` call instead of being passed by the `omega()` method. This was needed to fix https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/issues/73

Hmm, running `make ptestlong`, I get possibly unrelated doctests failures in

```
sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/test.py
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/
```

Could someone else please double-check ?

Could you post the actual failures please instead of only the files with failures?

There is a lot of them, and they seem not to be related. I get the same with the previous cypari2. So let me put back to positive review.

Could you please have a look at #27391, Jeroen ?
