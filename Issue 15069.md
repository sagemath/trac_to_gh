CC:  robertwb dkrenn rws

The method partial_fraction_decomposition() does not work correctly. 

Compare this 

```
sage: p = 2*x; q = x^2 + 6*x +9; r = p/q 
sage: r.partial_fraction() 
Out[2]: 2/(x + 3) - 6/(x + 3)^2 
```


with

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: p = 2*x; q = x^2 + 6*x +9; r = p/q
sage: r.partial_fraction_decomposition()
Out[5]: (0, [2*x/(x^2 + 6*x + 9)])
```

Can you please elaborate on what output is expected? The output is correct in ZZ, and I don't see it different in QQ.

Hum... I don't understand, shouldn't the output of r.partial_fraction() and r.partial_fraction_decomposition() be "equivalent"?
They are not in the example that I gave. For the rational function 2x/(x<sup>2</sup> +6*x +9), the method partial_fraction() gives the correct answer while partial_fraction_decomposition() does not.

It looks like `partial_fraction_decomposition` does not even attempt to return numerators of degree smaller than that of the irreducible polynomial in the denominator. The reason for that (I guess) is that `partial_fraction_decomposition` is defined for all elements of parents belonging to `QuotientFields()`, "the category of quotient fields over an integral domain".

But while trying to fix the issue I realized that I am a bit confused:
* Is partial fraction decomposition really defined over the field of fractions of any integral domain R? (I agree that it is when R is a PID, but what about other cases?)
* In any case, isn't its *computation* going to require a Euclidean domain?
* But in the Euclidean case, the stronger partial fraction decomposition pong asks for is always defined, isn't it?
* What is the correct way to define methods that apply to all elements of the field of fractions of a *Euclidean* domain? Conversely, should there be a category of quotient fields over an integral (as opposed to Euclidean) domain in Sage at all?...

Positive review to your changes. (They do not answer my metaphysical questions, but they do fix the bug.) I prepared a small reviewer patch, though: can you have a quick look? Thanks.
