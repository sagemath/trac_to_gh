# Issue 13113: add mpmath library to sage.misc.citations module

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13285

Original creator: benjaminfjones

Original creation time: 2012-07-23 18:16:10

Assignee: burcin

Keywords: mpmath citation

The mpmath library which is used now in many cases for the numerical evaluation of special functions in Sage, is not listed in the `sage.misc.citations` module. This should be fixed.

Hmm, good idea.  How would I test this?  Do `get_systems` on evaluating something that does it with mpmath?  Should we doctest this, even?

Yes, I should add a doctest. With the patch applied, I tested:


```
sage: from sage.misc.citation import get_systems
sage: get_systems('lambert_w(1).n()')
['mpmath', 'ginac', 'GMP']
```
