sage-4.3.5 ebuild references expect-2.0, but this version is no longer available for download (upstream gives only newer versions). Searching with google and filesearch.ru gives no results

maybe a newer version will work, too?

Watch out - new versions are much, much slower....

You didn't search hard enough:[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pexpect/files/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pexpect/files/),
And actually, besides being slower, pexpect breaks graphics in the notebook.
