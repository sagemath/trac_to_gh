# Issue 29952: Add Sphere and Hyperbolic Space Permanently

The most common examples in (differential) geometry are the Euclidean space, the sphere and the hyperbolic space, namely the manifolds with constant sectional curvature 0, 1 and -1. I suggest, we add the sphere and hyperbolic space in a similar manner as it has already been done for `EuclideanSpace`.

This is also a good opportunity to expand the tutorials a little bit. Furthermore, most of our docstring examples are based on the 2-sphere. Hence we can perhaps shorten or simplify some parts of the documentation.

This sounds like a very good idea!

Note that in order not to clutter the global namespace, one can let access to the sphere and the hyperbolic space via the [manifold catalog](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/catalog.html). The current version of the catalog is very primitive and the function `Sphere()` in it should call the constructor the sphere class, as soon as the latter is ready.

Ah, that is very nice. Actually, I was not aware that something like that exists. This should be populated somewhere more obvious. Probably in a tutorial?

So, the only thing that should be added now is the hyperbolic space, right?

By the way, I noticed that the result coming from `sage.manifolds.catalog.Sphere` is not even correct:


```
sage: S.<th, ph> = manifolds.Sphere()
sage: S
2-dimensional Riemannian submanifold S embedded in the Euclidean
 space E^3
sage: S.atlas()
[Chart (S, (th, ph))]
```


This is not a correct atlas.

Indeed, when it is more developed.

No, there remains to introduce a proper sphere class, on the model of `EuclideanSpace`, with methods like `stereographic_coordinates`.

Indeed. As I say in comment:1, the catalog is in a primitive stage.

Now I see what you mean. I first thought that "primitive" was just referring to the amount of examples.

That's good: there's still work to do. :)

Changing type from enhancement to task.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

There is also some old code in sage.geometry.riemannian_manifolds that seems to provide some examples

Indeed! These examples should be integrated into the catalog and then `sage.geometry.riemannian_manifolds` should be deprecated, since all the functionalities it contains are available in `sage.manifolds.differentiable.pseudo_riemannian_submanifold`.
