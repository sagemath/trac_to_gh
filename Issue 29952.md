The most common examples in (differential) geometry are the Euclidean space, the sphere and the hyperbolic space, namely the manifolds with constant sectional curvature 0, 1 and -1. I suggest, we add the sphere and hyperbolic space in a similar manner as it has already been done for `EuclideanSpace`.

This is also a good opportunity to expand the tutorials a little bit. Furthermore, most of our docstring examples are based on the 2-sphere. Hence we can perhaps shorten or simplify some parts of the documentation.

This sounds like a very good idea!

Note that in order not to clutter the global namespace, one can let access to the sphere and the hyperbolic space via the [manifold catalog](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/catalog.html). The current version of the catalog is very primitive and the function `Sphere()` in it should call the constructor the sphere class, as soon as the latter is ready.

Ah, that is very nice. Actually, I was not aware that something like that exists. This should be populated somewhere more obvious. Probably in a tutorial?

So, the only thing that should be added now is the hyperbolic space, right?

By the way, I noticed that the result coming from `sage.manifolds.catalog.Sphere` is not even correct:


```
sage: S.<th, ph> = manifolds.Sphere()
sage: S
2-dimensional Riemannian submanifold S embedded in the Euclidean
 space E^3
sage: S.atlas()
[Chart (S, (th, ph))]
```


This is not a correct atlas.

Indeed, when it is more developed.

Indeed. As I say in comment:1, the catalog is in a primitive stage.

Now I see what you mean. I first thought that "primitive" was just referring to the amount of examples.

That's good: there's still work to do. :)

Indeed! These examples should be integrated into the catalog and then `sage.geometry.riemannian_manifolds` should be deprecated, since all the functionalities it contains are available in `sage.manifolds.differentiable.pseudo_riemannian_submanifold`.
