New in 0.5.4:
* fix expansion of `abs(power)` (#19797)
* fix a wrong function option with `zeta/zeta2` (#19799)
* fix wrong formula for `tan(...).imag()` (#19791)
* fix `mpq_pythonhash` (#19310)
* change hash type to `int64_t` (#19310)
* expand `exp(m/n*pi*I)` with trig functions if they can be expanded (#19738)
* start changing libtool version with each release
* performance: in `exp_eval` check for `Pi` and `I` before trying to divide
* performance: much less canonicalizations of GMP rationals
* performance: cache pseries coeff accesses in `pseries::mul_series`
* performance: `GinacFunction`s for `cot/acot`
* C++11: add `override` where possible

These I did mindlessly to preserve the result:

```
Failed example:

This one cannot be fixed otherwise:

How do you let the original succeed? Attempts with tolerance didn't work:

I think it has to do with hashes. Something like `beta(a, b)` gets reordered such that `hash(a) < hash(b)`.

I just looked into this a bit more and the re-ordering of `beta(a,b)` indeed depends on the hashes of `a` and `b`. Unfortunately, the hashes of expressions are random. So, in the case of

```
beta(1/2*x, 3)
```

we know that `hash(3) = 3` but the value of `hash(1/2*x)` is just random.
