Keywords: q-analogs, Q systems

Because conjecturally (I think this is still an open problem) specializing `q` to roots of unity gives solutions to restricted Q-systems when looking at KR crystals.

Hi Travis,

To fix the B2 calculation (and to be, as you say, more robust), changing the code like the below example sounds like a good idea.

```
sage: B = CrystalOfTableaux(['B',2], shape=[2,1])
sage: R.<q> = QQ[]
sage: ret = R.zero()
sage: for b in B:
....:    ret += q**len(b.to_highest_weight()[1])
....:
sage: ret
q^10 + 2*q^9 + 3*q^8 + 4*q^7 + 5*q^6 + 5*q^5 + 5*q^4 + 4*q^3 + 3*q^2 + 2*q + 1
```

Also, would it be a good idea to have this ticked based on #15882?

Now it works for general HW crystals by returning a (lazy) FPS.

There are some documentation errors:
- *weight space \mu* should be either *\mu-weight space* or *weight space of weight \mu*
- There is a B(\Lambda) where there should be a B(\lambda)
- Last sentence before input: *Mor more...* should be *For more...*
