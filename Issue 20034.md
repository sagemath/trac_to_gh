Changing the presentation of fraction field elements breaks several algorithms. This issue was found while trying to normalize the presentation of these elements in #20246 (see [305c28e6](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=305c28e6f5bbc9f5f5e02e6b2fcde14a56500a98&id=6550ba0b3ebdcfafca1299235f59bec8d0abc1b8)). Stopgap warnings should be added for all of them.

Sorry, an incorrect coercion was to blame for most of the errors.
