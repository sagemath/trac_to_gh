That's a nice feature!
One thing that could be improved is to add an error message if there is no such map. For example,

```
sage:findmap(domain="Posets", codomain="Binary Words").an_element()
```

returns a `StopIteration` error, but I would prefer seeing some message saying that FindStat does not know any such map.
Otherwise, this looks good to me.
