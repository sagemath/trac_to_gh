# Issue 12552: Allow different normalizations for Eisenstein series q-expansion

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12724

Original creator: davidloeffler

Original creation time: 2012-03-22 09:27:12

Assignee: craigcitro

This came up as part of my review of #12046, but it's of independent interest.

The level 1 Eisenstein series can be normalized in three natural ways: so the linear term is 1; so the constant term is 1; or so the coefficients are integers with no common factor. Renormalizing is no problem if you're working over QQ but over finite characteristic base rings it is a total pain (try computing E_p-1_ mod p<sup>2</sup>).

The patch below modifies ` eisenstein_series_qexp ` so the following works:

```
sage: eisenstein_series_qexp(6, 5, normalization="constant") 
1 - 504*q - 16632*q^2 - 122976*q^3 - 532728*q^4 + O(q^5)
sage: eisenstein_series_qexp(6, 10, K=Zmod(49), normalization="constant")        
1 + 35*q + 28*q^2 + 14*q^3 + 42*q^5 + 21*q^6 + 35*q^7 + 35*q^8 + 7*q^9 + O(q^10)
```

Adding dependency on #11375 so the patchbot knows how to apply it to Sage 4.8.

David,

This is great.  I have run into this exact thing before and worked around it; it will be good to have it properly in Sage.

I have one minor request: would you mind including a Hasse invariant example, e.g.:


```
sage: eisenstein_series_qexp(12, 50, K=GF(13), normalization="constant")
1 + O(q^50)
```


For some reason it feels like it belongs here.

I agree, that's a good idea.

Apply trac_12724.patch, trac_12724-add_example.patch 

(for patchbot).

Some of these don't work on OS X 10.4 PPC (and I'm guessing all other 32-bit systems):

This isn't so much a bug in the code, as a preexisting bug in polynomials over `GF(2)` which my code has just revealed:

```
sage: R.<x> = Zmod(2)[]
sage: R([2^80]) # boom!
```

Curiously there is no problem with moduli other than 2.

Comment by davidloeffler created at 2012-04-08 17:44:18

Here's a tiny patch to the ` __init__ ` method of mod 2 polynomials which should fix the problem.

Apply trac_12724.patch, trac_12724-add_example.patch, trac_12724-add_example.patch

(for patchbot).

mod 2 bit looks alright, but perhaps we should avoid the %2 if x.parent() is GF(2) already?

Replying to [comment:15 malb]:
> mod 2 bit looks alright, but perhaps we should avoid the %2 if x.parent() is GF(2) already?

True, there's no need to reduce mod 2 in this case. I've rearranged things to avoid this.

Apply trac_12724.patch, trac_12724-add_example.patch, trac_12724-poly_bug.patch
