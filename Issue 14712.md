# Issue 14712: Infinite redirects for mercurial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14949

Original creator: gagern

Original creation time: 2013-07-22 06:40:53

Trying to run `./pull` on an old clone of the source code, I get an error


```
abort: HTTP Error 301: The HTTP server returned a redirect error
that would lead to an infinite loop.
The last 30x error message was:
Moved Permanently
```


The first request was for http://www.sagemath.org/hg/sage-main?cmd=capabilities, all subsequent ones for http://www.sagemath.org/hg/?cmd=capabilities, so the latter is the thing which loops. I guess that I'll be able to work around this by creating a new checkout, but this misconfiguration is a bit annoying and against the specs nevertheless.

Since hg was replaced by git, I guess this ticket now obsolete.
