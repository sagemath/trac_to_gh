Replying to [ticket:23051 vdelecroix]:
> - remove the public access to the `_cache` attribute

Why? Surely `X._cache` is more readable and easier to grasp than `X._get_cache()`.

I also don't like this `return 0`. If the return type `int` is only meant for checking exceptions, I usually don't write a `return`. Cython knows to `return 0` in that case.

I think these can raise exceptions too, so better declare them as `cdef int ... except -1`:

```
cdef void cache(self, key, x)
cdef void clear_cache(self)
```
