# Issue 11240: bug in the creation of partitions starting from a core and a tuple of quotients

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11412

Original creator: pdehaye

Original creation time: 2011-05-31 12:57:40

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  mhansen hivert

Keywords: partition core quotient

the Partition(core=????,quotient=???) construction is broken in some very specific cases, even after applying #11165. For instance, after patching with #11165:


```
sage: Partition(core=[2,1],quotient=([],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]))
[4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
sage: Partition(core=[3,2,1],quotient=([],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]))
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (3247, 0))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/duser1/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/combinat/partition.pyc in Partition(mu, **keyword)
    262         return from_exp(keyword['exp'])
    263     elif 'core' in keyword and 'quotient' in keyword and len(keyword)==2:
--> 264         return from_core_and_quotient(keyword['core'], keyword['quotient'])
    265     elif 'core' in keyword and 'canonical_quotient' in keyword and len(keyword)==2:
    266         raise NotImplementedError

/Users/duser1/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/combinat/partition.pyc in from_core_and_quotient(core, quotient)
    314     new_w = []
    315     for i in range(length):
--> 316         new_w += [ w[i][j] + length*quotient[i][j] for j in range(len(quotient[i]))]
    317         new_w += [ w[i][j] for j in range(len(quotient[i]), len(w[i])) ]
    318     new_w.sort()

IndexError: list index out of range
```

works in the first case, fails in the second. the code is also badly documented. patch coming shortly.

Hi Paul-Olivier,

Thanks for debugging this one. Your modifications looks good to me. I just uploaded a review patch which improve the typesetting of your added tests. If you would be kind enough to review my patch you can put a positive review on my behalf.

Cheers,

Florent
