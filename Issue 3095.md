# Issue 3095: Notebook, Documentation of DATA has a small error

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: lars.fischer

Original creation time: 2008-05-03 14:39:01

Assignee: boothby

When I click on Help in the Notebook, the help text for "*DATA* variable" reads:

The variable *DATA* contains the directory with data files that you upload into the worksheet. For example, to open a file in that directory, do "open(*_DIR*_+'filename')".

The example should use DATA.

This applies to 
sage0_version()
SAGE Version 3.0, Release Date: 2008-04-23

With best regards,

Lars Fischer

This is easy enough to fix, so let's get this still into 3.0.1. I am on it.

Cheers,

Michael
