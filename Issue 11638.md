```
sage: K.<a> = GF(2^11)
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x^5+x^3+1)
sage: H = HyperellipticCurve(x^5+x^3+1,1)
sage: H.divisor_group?
...
       EXAMPLES:
          sage: x,y,z = PolynomialRing(QQ, 3, names='x,y,z').gens() sage:
          C  = Curve(y^2*z - x^3 - 17*x*z^2 + y*z^2) sage: Cp =
          Curve(y^2*z - x^3 - 17*x*z^2 + y*z^2) sage: C.divisor_group() is
          Cp.divisor_group() True
```

If only you had cc'ed me... (I made my own "feature freeze" for the alpha3 by not looking at report 11 after I fetched all positively reviewed tickets, apparently right before these trivial documentation fixes got positive review; only watched the opening of new tickets.)

But I think I'll still get these two (#11801 and this one) into Sage 4.7.2.alpha3.

In case you're fixing further trivial / documentation issues during the next 36 hours (say), please cc me on such tickets.
