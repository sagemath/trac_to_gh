```
sage -t --long sets/totally_ordered_finite_set.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long sets/finite_enumerated_set.py  # 3 doctests failed
```


Nothing serious, but there is something weird `O_O;;`


```
File "sets/finite_enumerated_set.py", line 345, in sage.sets.finite_enumerated_set.FiniteEnumeratedSet.__call__
Failed example:
    psi('a')
Expected:
    2
Got:
    1
```

Oh, I  did not try to pass test in all of src/. My office's computer is off for some reason `^^;`

Do you get why this `2` changed to a `1` ? `O_o`

Replying to [comment:10 ncohen]:

It was meant to be a one in the first place: it's the length of 'a'; I had fumbled my copy-paste.

Btw: all long tests pass.

Oh sorry, I had not noticed that you had added this doctest with '2' as an answer yourself. I was wondering how your commit could have changed a former "2" into a "1" `:-D`

Good to go as far as I can tell. Seems to do what it should, and if it passes tests... Thanks ! Now #16269 can be reviewed, which means that #16277 can be reviewed which means that #16279 can be reviwed, but also #16235 and so #16241.

Damn designs `:-PPPPPPPPP`
