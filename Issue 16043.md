It was meant to be a one in the first place: it's the length of 'a'; I had fumbled my copy-paste.

Oh sorry, I had not noticed that you had added this doctest with '2' as an answer yourself. I was wondering how your commit could have changed a former "2" into a "1" `:-D`

Good to go as far as I can tell. Seems to do what it should, and if it passes tests... Thanks ! Now #16269 can be reviewed, which means that #16277 can be reviewed which means that #16279 can be reviwed, but also #16235 and so #16241.
