```
sage: wl = RootSystem(['A',3]).weight_lattice()
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',3], prefix="s")
sage: wl.weyl_group() == W
False
```

but

```
sage: wl.weyl_group().__cmp__(W)
0
```

Should `wl.weyl_group()` and `W` be equal or not?

In case they should be equal, I can provide a patch.

This issue is with `__cmp__` and the assumption that there is a total ordering on Weyl groups. I think the `__cmp__` was needed for old Sage (python?) things, and the usual line of `==` is not the same as being isomorphic. IMO the examples above should not be equal. So I believe we should change the behavior of `__cmp__` to fallback to comparison of the strings, or better yet, remove it altogether.
