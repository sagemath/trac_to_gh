Should `wl.weyl_group()` and `W` be equal or not?

In case they should be equal, I can provide a patch.

This issue is with `__cmp__` and the assumption that there is a total ordering on Weyl groups. I think the `__cmp__` was needed for old Sage (python?) things, and the usual line of `==` is not the same as being isomorphic. IMO the examples above should not be equal.
