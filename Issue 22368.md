These error messages are not really informative of what the problem really is:


```

sage: K = NumberField(x^2-2,'s')
sage: s = K.0
sage: L = NumberField(x^3-2,'t')
sage: t = L.0
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,s],[t,0]])
Traceback (most recent call last):

AttributeError: 'Objects_with_category' object has no attribute 'is_exact'

similar problem with `floats`:

I added a way to catch the float and set the base ring to `RDF`. Now, I'm wondering how we could handle the algebraic numbers in an efficient way. Indeed, it seems that they are automatically converted while they might not need it.

What if the user is clever and knows that the `H`-representation that is given really describes a lattice polytope and would like to specify its parent to be Polyhedron_ZZ.

I have #22754 in mind as an example.

I'll try to put some time on this, but I will look at the trac only sporadically in the next 2 weeks.

True! The constructor should not overwrite `base_ring` if it was set by the user. I will add a commit.

hi, 

i've adjusted the doctests in MIP and added the `int` construction test to JP's branch.

i had trouble with Python's `Fraction` though:


```
sage: from fractions import Fraction
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[Fraction(int(8), int(6))]])

any ideas?
