# Issue 33175: Remove sage-update-src

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33412

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2022-02-23 20:46:29

Let's remove the script `src/bin/sage-update-src`. It is not documented, and it doesn't actually work with the current layout of files â€” it tries to run `local/bin/sage-env` rather than `venv/bin/sage-env` or something more robust.

Thanks! (I'm currently running tests so I will change the status if something fails, but since the script looks broken as it is, I don't see how removing it can hurt.)
