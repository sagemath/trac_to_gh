# Issue 12206: Graph chromatic_number (Document and Default)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: JoalHeagney

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: graph, MILP, chromatic_number

The following page in the documentation
[http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/graphs/graph.html)
refers to the need to install GLPK, and that chromatic_number uses the less efficient DLX algorithm by default, as opposed to the MILP algorithm.

It's my understanding that sage now includes GLPK by default.

I'd recommend that the current version (4.8) documentation be changed to remove the sentence:
_"This method requires you to install an optional Sage package like GLPK or COIN-ORâ€™s CBC."_

Additionally, we should check for other references to installing "optional" GLPK in the documentation

Here is the patch ! `:-)`

I updated the documentation and I do not think there are other instances where GLPK is still mentionned as optional. This being said, I removed the comment about GLPK being faster than the other algorithms. On small examples it just is not true, though the MILP method may be faster when other solvers are installed.
