Looking through the code of ``matrix_integer_dense.pyx`` I found *``algorithn``* instead of *``algorithm``* in line 2689, which is wrong.

Nice catch!

It's a simple fix, but we should add a doctest to make sure this doesn't come up again. It would be better to add tests for all different options for `algorithm`, but can you at least add a doctest for this case?

Thanks! The new patch looks good to me. I didn't run doctests on the whole library, but I don't expect any problems. Let's see what the patchbot says.

Apply attachment:trac_12049_algorithn_algorithm.2.patch.
