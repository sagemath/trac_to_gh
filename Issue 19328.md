If you split the last line to lengths at most around 80 characters, then you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Elephant in the room: why is `master != develop`? I think the problem is not the documentation, the problem is the strange convention that Sage's `master` isn't actually what most projects call `master`.

Well.. I have seen that question raised already, but where ?

Now, *today*, I have a potential new user that is perplexed.

What do other projects do for their latest beta branch versus stable release? I thought `master` was suppose to be used for stable versions. Granted, our beta versions are usually fairly stable, but even once in awhile, we do break things badly with beta versions...

Actually, a somewhat radical thought, what if we do make `master` somehow be the more granular bumps and not call them betas but, e.g., `6.10.4`, and then we have a latest merged branch that Volker includes? This way we could stop with those "wait until next beta to deal with conflicts/problems" messages for closed tickets that Volker has already included but not released.

Not at all. `master` normally means the development version.

A semi-standard way of doing things in github is to keep development happening
in `master` and to use tags for releases. I guess this discussion is more suited
for sage-devel though. 

As for the content of the ticket, I will be glad to accommodate Travis request as
soon as my sage install finishes a run of tests.

Sorry for the stupid mistake in the commit message: test was meant to be text

The master/develop terminology is from git flow: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Good to know that there is at least one other person using the same model as Sage :-)
