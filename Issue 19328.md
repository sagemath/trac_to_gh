Elephant in the room: why is `master != develop`? I think the problem is not the documentation, the problem is the strange convention that Sage's `master` isn't actually what most projects call `master`.

What do other projects do for their latest beta branch versus stable release? I thought `master` was suppose to be used for stable versions. Granted, our beta versions are usually fairly stable, but even once in awhile, we do break things badly with beta versions...

Actually, a somewhat radical thought, what if we do make `master` somehow be the more granular bumps and not call them betas but, e.g., `6.10.4`, and then we have a latest merged branch that Volker includes? This way we could stop with those "wait until next beta to deal with conflicts/problems" messages for closed tickets that Volker has already included but not released.

A semi-standard way of doing things in github is to keep development happening
in `master` and to use tags for releases. I guess this discussion is more suited
for sage-devel though. 

As for the content of the ticket, I will be glad to accommodate Travis request as
soon as my sage install finishes a run of tests.
