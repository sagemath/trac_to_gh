This branch already mostly works. The only remaining issue:

```
sage: 2 == pari(2)
False
```


This will be fixed in #21163.

Looks good to me. Thanks. I'll rebase my work off this ticket, that's going to help a lot!

Do you need reviewers for the dependencies? I feel I'm not the most competent for those, but I can give a shot.

I hope that Nicolas Thi√©ry will deal with #20686. But #20767 is the big one, I'm writing to sage-devel about it.

Just stumbled upon this line while cleaning the PARI interface: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/ring.pyx?id=824f7ead9d7668e322e8a02670c60d39467b2610#n199

Might have to be addressed by this ticket?

About dependencies: #21126 is a pretty trivial Cython patch. I don't think that upstream could have anything against it, but they sometimes take time to look at pull requests...
