Though the check is elegantly written in two lines, I think it has two
unnecessary downsides:

- It allocates a new matrix in the apply_map, instead of calculating
  the degrees on inspection.

- It doesn't fail fast: for instance, if the first two rows have the
  same leading position, we don't need to continue.

Both issues can be repaired by changing the outer list comprehension
into a loop, where one maintains an auxiliary set of already seen
leading positions.

Probably is_weak_popov will usually not be a performance bottleneck, but nonetheless.

Cheers,
jsrn

Btw. Sage usually has line wraps on doc strings, right? The line under OUTPUT is very long. Also, the last sentence there is missing a full stop.

Last pet peeve: can you change one or two of the doc tests to be
non-square matrices?

Come to think of it, if the matrix has more rows than cols, the function can immediately return False.

Some simple measures for the change from list comprehension (probably more "pythonic") to double loops:

list comprehension:

sage: PF = PolynomialRing(GF(2!^32,'a'),'x')

sage: A = random_matrix(PF,400,400,degree=10)
sage: %timeit A.is_weak_popov()
1 loops, best of 3: 7.57 s per loop

sage: B = random_matrix(PF,10,10,degree=800)
sage: %timeit B.is_weak_popov()
1000 loops, best of 3: 554 µs per loop

----
loops

sage: A = random_matrix(PF,400,400,degree=10)
sage: %timeit A.is_weak_popov()
1000 loops, best of 3: 251 µs per loop
sage: A.is_weak_popov()
False

sage: for x in range(A.nrows()):
....:     A[x,x] = A[x,x].shift(11)
....:     
sage: A.is_weak_popov()
True
sage: %timeit A.is_weak_popov()
10 loops, best of 3: 69.1 ms per loop

sage: B = random_matrix(PF,10,10,degree=800)

100000 loops, best of 3: 8.73 µs per loop

Cool, looks good. And the timings are quite persuasive.

One thing: I don't see what you need the "p = self.ncols()-1" line for. p will always be reassigned if any element is non-zero. And if not, p will never be read.
