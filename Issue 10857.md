The code from scipy_sandbox has been included one way or another in scipy and matplotlib (see #6946 for delaunay from matplotlib).

What was the point behind scipy_sandbox?

It was added in #1430 and provided "experimental" features of scipy. Currently arpack and delaunay. It was discontinued upstream quite a while ago as the features in question are not experimental anymore :)

I am adding Paulo (Paulo Cesar Pereira de Andrade aka pcpa) as author because I just made his patch into a nice mercurial patch and he deserves some credit.

It would be cool to have this along with numpy-1.5.1 (#10792) and scipy-0.9 (#10887).

Un-tar'ed a fresh 4.7.alpha1.  Applied the one patch to SAGE_ROOT.  Built Sage.  Then applied the two Sage library patches and ran long tests.  Got two failures, the second being a consequence of the first, while the first looks genuine.


```
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/numerical/test.py"
**********************************************************************
File "/sage/sandbox/devel/sage/sage/numerical/test.py", line 27:
    sage: e,v=arpack.eigs(A,k=6,which='SM')
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/sage/sandbox/local/bin/ncadoctest.py", line 1231, in run_one_test
        self.run_one_example(test, example, filename, compileflags)
      File "/sage/sandbox/local/bin/sagedoctest.py", line 38, in run_one_example
        OrigDocTestRunner.run_one_example(self, test, example, filename, compileflags)
      File "/sage/sandbox/local/bin/ncadoctest.py", line 1172, in run_one_example

        e,v=arpack.eigs(A,k=Integer(6),which='SM')###line 27:
    sage: e,v=arpack.eigs(A,k=6,which='SM')
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'eigs'
**********************************************************************
```


Then installed the new `SciPy` spkg at #10887.  Reran the test above and it passed.  Running full tests right now, which I would expect to pass.

So I think that (a) this ticket depends on #10887, and (b) with that dependency this ticket functions just fine and merits a positive review.

Francois - does that look right?

They all passed (once I remembered to add the matrix_double_dense fix!).

From the scipy release notes I was expecting the patch to work for both scipy-0.8 and 0.9. After checking the function has a different name in the two versions. So the current version has to depend on #10887. I am changing the description to reflect this.
