Patch added. I'm assigning this ticket to jason, ncohen, and rlm because they are in charge of the blanket ticket #9136 .

Nice addition ! Passes all tests and does its work, except for one small detail : we try to keep the lines below 80 characters in Sage's code. I uploaded a reviewer's patch, and if you agree with it this ticket can be set to "positive review"

Of course, that is fine with me. I'll keep the 80-character width limit in mind next time.

If you like, I can merge your patch into mine and reupload it. Shall I?

Oh. I did it myself just to avoid you the trouble of doing this. Anyway you're the only Author of this patch, it's just to make the review quicker `:-)`

So it's up to you : just don't forget to set the ticket to "positive review" so that the release manager will eventually merge the two tickets !

Hey, sorry for the delay, I was traveling (on my way, indirectly, to Sage Days 29 !). I'm setting this ticket to "positive review" as you asked, but if you change your mind feel free to change it back :)

Since the hyperlink to the MathWorld and Wikipedia articles are not meant to be refered to from a different place, you should make links with _two_ trailing underscores.  See [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#embedded-uris](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#embedded-uris)

Hi Jeroen, thanks for your advice as usual! After looking through the link you provided, and also the file I am modifying ( sage/graphs/graph_generators.py ), it seems that all the other links to Wikipedia or MathWorld are using single underscores. The only difference seemed to be that in my links, the text of the link (i.e. the name given to the reference) was attached to the context of the sentence it was in, rather than being a standalone phrase. I attempted to fix that, instead of doubling the underscores. Is that acceptable?

I guess this is acceptable, yes.  I still have to build the documentation and see what it gives, but I guess it's okay.
