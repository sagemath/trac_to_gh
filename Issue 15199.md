# Issue 15199: Cksum uses tabs instead of spaces, breaking sage-spkg's regex

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15436

If neither shasum nor md5sum/md5 is available, then we fall back to
cksum for package checksums. This only during adventures in retro
computing, i.e., Solaris. This patch fixes the regex to work even with
the broken Solaris sed.

So, not even \s is supported. In that case, LGTM.
