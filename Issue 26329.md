# Issue 26329: clean static_dense_graph.pyx

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2018-10-27 10:55:37

CC:  tscrim chapoton

Keywords: py3, graph

Done in this ticket:
- extend the definition of parameter `translation` of `dense_graph_init` to allow passing a mapping from vertices to integers or from integers to vertices. We thus save several calls to `.vertices()`.
- PEP8 cleaning

This new functionality should be used in `independent_sets.pyx` and `vertex_separation.pyx`, but after the merging of #26446 and #26520.
