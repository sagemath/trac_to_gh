CC:  @dimpase tmonteil @ferihr

Added Delsarte bounds for binary constant weight codes (similarly to preexisting work on Hamming codes), as well as Q-Polynomial Association schemes (where we can now calculate the bounds given the Q-matrix).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32683

Let us also do renaming of functions: remove `delsarte_bound_` prefix: currently in the docs it's 
`sage.coding.delsarte_bounds.delsarte_bound_additive_hamming_space` etc.

It made sense previously, without `.delsarte_bounds.` namespace thing, but not any more.

Perhaps it's more a documentation bug. Indeed,
at the Sage prompt one does, say,  `codes.bounds.krawtchouk(24,2,5,4)`, but docs say
`sage.coding.delsarte_bounds.krawtchouk`. The call
`sage.coding.delsarte_bounds.krawtchouk(24,2,5,4)` works just as well.

Why is that so, it's kind of weird...
