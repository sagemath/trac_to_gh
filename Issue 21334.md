CC:  @williamstein @vbraun @jdemeyer @dimpase @tobihan @kiwifb @infinity0 @orlitzky

Keywords: sd111

Use the installed location for `COPYING.txt` from `sage.misc.copying`.

Use `src/doc/bootstrap` to install a copy in `src/doc` somewhere as preparation for installation.

Perhaps autogenerate `COPYING.txt` from portions in `build/pkgs/`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21571

Is it feasible to do this one on top of #21604 and #21600, or is more cleaning needed first?

Instead of copying, perhaps we can move it to `src/`
and replace it by a very short notice in `COPYING.txt`, pointing the user to `src/COPYING.txt` for more detail.

Technical aspect first: currently sage has a function called license that essentially read `COPYING.txt` located in SAGE_ROOT. And it is doctested. 

As you can imagine, it thrills me. 

The second issue is that the current file which is a meta distribution COPYING.txt is supposed to aggregate the license of all the packages shipped. As a set file, unless it lists all possible licenses ever, it is obsolete by design. It ought to be generated.

Legal point, yes copyright can be stupid. But license compatibility really kicks in when you distribute binaries. So long as you distribute only source code and you build it yourself, you don't have to worry about it. Of course who does build by themselves these days :)

The technical problem can be solved by deleting `sage.misc.copying` =P

The legal issues can be solved by... somebody else.
