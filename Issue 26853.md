# Issue 26853: Convert Python class into an extension type

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27090

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2019-01-22 13:07:42

Currently, `cpdef` methods in Cython are faster for extension classes than for Python classes.

This ticket defines a new function (usable as class decorator) which turns a Python class into an extension class.

Moving tickets from the Sage 8.8 milestone that have been actively worked on in the last six months to the next release milestone (optimistically).

I am curious whether I can be a user of this ``@`extension_class` decorator.

If I have a python class based on cython classes in sage library that I want to speed things up for its objects,  then could I add the decorator to the class for my purpose? If so, what would be possible disadvantages in doing it that you warn me on?

A sage developer without much knowledge about cython, like me, might be tempted to put the decorator to any class, without fully understanding its implications. More documentation for him or her may be added.
