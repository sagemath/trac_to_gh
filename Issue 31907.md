Keywords: expression, size, tree

The complexity of a symbolic expression
can be measured by the size of its expression tree.

We add a `tree_size` method to symbolic expressions
to count the nodes of the expression tree.

In Maple and Mathematica this is called "leaf count",
although it counts tree nodes, rather than only leaves.

Other measures of complexity of a symbolic expression:

- length of the expression's string representation
- number of (first-level) operands (see #29738)
