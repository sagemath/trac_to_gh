Currently we parse rst files in the documentation in exactly the same way as we parse python files: search for triple quoted strings and then search for sage: within them.  This is the wrong approach within an rst file, since doctests can occur within normal text.  Instead, we should use `docutils` to parse the rst files and look for verbatim or doctest blocks, and then search within those.
