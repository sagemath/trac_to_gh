Keywords: modular arithmetic, centered lift

This ticket is a split of #8558 for easier review and merging.

Add a lift_centered method to ntl_mod_p elements and a generic function.

If p  is an integer mod n, returns r congruent to p mod n such that -n/2 < r <= n/2

It also deprecates the use of centerlift for lift_centered. The discussion is in #8558

Are you thinking for instance?


```
K.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
I = Ideal(x*y,x*z,y*z)
R = K.quotient_ring(I)
f = R((x+y+z)**2)
lift_centered(f)
x^2 + y^2 + z^2
```


So what you propose is that lift_centered should be always a class method and never explicitely computed using the global function, don't you?
