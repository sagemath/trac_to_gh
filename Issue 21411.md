# Issue 21411: Doctest continuation marker / matrix

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21648

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-10-05 09:58:52

Every grepping of source code is easier if there is just one way to do something. Also some user might wonder if there is a difference between `...` and `....:`. Hence I suggest mass change from old-style doctest continuation lines.

This part does that in matrix folder.

Done by


```
find src/sage/matrix/ -name '*.py' -or -name '*.pyx' | xargs perl -e 's|^( *)\.\.\.  |\1....:|g;' -p -i.bak
```
