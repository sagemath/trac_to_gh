Keywords: singular, linker, sd34

Due to fussier linkers, Singular will not build on the current version of Ubuntu Oneiric (11.10). This was reported at https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/aL8b9phz3Xc/discussion : the fix is to flip the order of `-ldl` and `-lkernel` in the linking step.

This may already be fixed upstream; if so, this ticket should be closed. If not, SD34 would be the perfect time to fix it.
