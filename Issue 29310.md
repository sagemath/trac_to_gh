This is strange because (a) I can't figure out what it has to do with matplotlib, and (b) tests only fail when run with `--long`, but the indicated tests are not marked `# long time`. The closest place there is a `# long time` tag is over 200 lines earlier.

I think we have a case where stuff may not be in matplotlib itself but some use of matplotlib may prime the memory for an error in another component to happen. In this case it is more a matter of highlighting a bug in that other component.

The strange bit that could be related to matplotlib is the use of freetype on the calls leading to the error. Is the stuff supposed to display something? If not why is it involved.

My sage session survived, but seems to be pretty hosed.  Now I get the crash even if I try `E.rational_points(bound=1)`. An error log ("error_Couldnt_close_file.txt​") is attached.

I did notice that the `# long time` tests on lines 2628, 2766, 2849, and 2855 involve `G.show`, which I suppose may involve matplotlib, so perhaps they have something to do with it.

Let me make two unhelpful comments:
- many of the doctests marked as `# long time` in this file don't actually take a long time. Maybe they used to, but perhaps algorithms have changed, and now they don't.
- the plot produced in `G = C.graph()` and `G.show()` is very simple: 4 vertices and 4 edges arranged in a square. So it's not clear why `matplotlib` is triggering the problem here. It certainly seems to be, but I don't understand it. Maybe the problem is fundamentally somewhere else, and we're just seeing it now.
