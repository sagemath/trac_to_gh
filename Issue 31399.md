Currently, the documentation for orthogonal polynomials is not very user-friendly (see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/functions/sage/functions/orthogonal_polys.html).

Some functions miss examples, some examples are not even related to the specific function. The end-user syntax is not clearly communicated either.

Moreover, most references are pointing at Wikipedia which should be changed imho. This is not reliable in the sense that an article can use different conventions tomorrow whereas books use fixed conventions.

I suggest to clean this up.
