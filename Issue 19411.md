```

This is not a dependency problem, otherwise it would be `ImportError` and not an `IOError`:

```
IOError: zipimport: can not open file /Users/buildslave-sage/slave/sage_git/build/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools-18.1-py2.7.egg
```

This looks more like a broken installation of setuptools.

Note that `simplegeneric` has

```
try:
    from setuptools import setup
except ImportError:
    from distutils.core import setup
```


Maybe it was a race condition, that `setuptools` was somehow partially installed?

Do you have the `install.log` file?

Replying to [comment:3 jdemeyer]:
> Do you have the `install.log` file?

http://build.sagedev.org/release/builders/%20%20fast%20Volker%20MiniMac%20%28OSX%2010.10%20x86_64%29%20incremental/builds/588/steps/compile/logs/stdio

I doubt that setuptools is installing itself atomically, so the egg (=zip archive) can easily be invalid while it is being written.
