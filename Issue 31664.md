Chart is missing `__classcall__` to normalize init arguments.

Perhaps all string parsing in `_init_coordinates` should already be done in `__classcall__`.

This would be nice! In the early stages of the manifold project, I did not manage to do it simply, i.e. without changing Sage's preparser, since

```
sage: D = Manifold(2, 'D')                                                                          
sage: X.<x,y> = D.chart(restrictions=x^2 + y^2 < 1)                                                 
```
would generate `NameError: name 'y' is not defined`. Of course, one could replace `x^2 + y^2 < 1` by the string `"x^2 + y^2 < 1"`, but this is not very user-friendly. Do you already have some solution in mind?

This is the approach that I have been trying out in this branch. 
But it does not work in examples like this one:

```
            sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
            sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
            sage: U = M.open_subset('U', coord_def={X: [x>1, y<pi]})
```
because `X` in `coord_def` is unhashable, leading to an error.

So perhaps an API change is needed, after all...

In the current branch, `Chart` inherits from `WithEqualityById` but redefines `__eq__` (in a rather complicated and possibly CPU time consuming way). Doesn't this defeat the purpose? In particular in view of comment:3.

In the code of `__hash__`, isn't

```
if not self.is_immutable():
    raise TypeError('Charts are unhashable until set_immutable() has been called')
```
an unnecessary limitation? 
More generally, why do you want to make `Chart` mutable? It is logically immutable: a chart is entirely defined by its domain and its coordinates (i.e. a tuple of symbolic variables).

```
sage: H = Manifold(2, 'H')  # half-disk
sage: X.<x,y> = H.chart(r"x y:(0,+oo)", restrictions="x^2 + y^2 < 1")
```
or equivalently

```
sage: X.<x,y> = H.chart(restrictions="[x^2 + y^2 < 1, y>0]")
```
Then we could get rid of the method `add_restriction` and consider that the chart is a fully immutable object (of course, technically speaking, the sheafy attributes can be muted).

When discussing a possible redesign of chart initialization, I think a relevant issue is the current use of the symbolic assumptions facility for the coordinates.

Are two charts with a different tuple of variables allowed to share some variables? If yes, does the shared variable have to have the same global assumptions and periodicity?

Also I note that creating a `RealChart` puts global assumptions on the variables of the chart. So creating a subchart will affect simplification of expressions that relate to computation on the original chart. This should probably be revised.

No (see below).

Yes, absolutely. This is something I have in mind for a long time but did not find the time to work on it. The assumptions should not be global but chart-wise. The way Sage's symbolic calculus is implemented, I guess this means that they should be switched on (via `assume`) before each calculus at the chart function level and switched off once the calculus is done (via `forget`). 

A connected question is how to pass these chart-based assumptions to SymPy, in case the latter has been chosen as the default symbolic backend on the manifold (via `M.set_calculus_method('sympy')`) or on a given chart `X` (via `X.calculus_method().set('sympy')`). For the time being, calculus with SymPy is possible but the assumptions are not taken into account on the SymPy side...

OK. Then I think there is little point in trying to provide better syntax for creating the variables than asking the user to do `var('x, y, z')` before creating a chart with coordinate restrictions.

Then the restrictions can just be passed as symbolic inequalities to the constructor. (I don't think going the string route would be an improvement.)

We could deprecate `add_restrictions` then.

There is already a context manager `assuming` for that. We could create it at initialization and invoke it using `with` whenever computations are done with this chart.

The tricky bit is when two charts are involved with overlapping variables. Then some renaming may have to be done first. A possible route is through #32089.

The issue here is that on real manifolds (by far the most used ones), the symbolic variables are created with the extra parameter `domain='real'` (cf. `RealChart._init_coordinates`), so the user must actually do `var('x y z', domain='real')`, which is not very intuitive. For some reason, it is not equivalent to `assume(x, 'real')`, which is performed in `RealChart._init_coordinates` as well. Both proved to be necessary for some simplifications.

I don't see why: two computations on two distinct charts can set different assumptions on the same variable. There is no ambiguity as long as assumptions are tied to charts.

A follow-up question on this:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
....: U = M.open_subset('U')
....: V = M.open_subset('V')
sage: XU = U.chart(names=("x", "y"))
sage: XV = V.chart(names=("x", "y"))
sage: M.atlas()
[Chart (U, (x, y)), Chart (V, (x, y))]
sage: M.top_charts()
[Chart (U, (x, y))]
```
Clearly something went wrong here. 
Should there have been a declaration of something on `M` regarding the intention to declare charts with the coordinate pair `(x,y)` on subsets?

There should not by any issue with coordinate changes: a coordinate change `X1 --> X2` involves only a set of chart functions based on `X1` (stored as a `MultiCoordFunction` in the attribute `CoordChange._transf`). So only assumptions relative to `X1` will be invoked in calculus involving the coordinate change `X1 --> X2` (such as the Jacobian matrix). An exception is the
computation of the inverse in `CoordChange.inverse`. There only assumptions on `X2` should matter. However, if `X1` and `X2` share the same variables, the inverse is trivial. To summarize, I don't think there is a case where both sets of assumptions are required simultaneously in coordinate changes.
