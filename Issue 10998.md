# Issue 10998: update SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/.hgignore

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11141

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2011-04-06 20:17:28

The new PolyBoRi spkg (#10797) and the new cython spkg (#10493) add the files `PolyGUI` and `cygdb` to SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/.  The attached patch adds those files to the .hgignore file.

I'm marking this as a blocker because we should distribute a clean repo when we release Sage, but it should be pretty easy to review...

Works fine. Before the patch:


```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.7.alpha3/local/bin$ hg status
? PolyGUI
? cygdb
```


but the patch corrects it.
