Because sometimes one might want to go back:

```
sage: T = TropicalSemiring(QQ)
sage: QQ(T(2))
2
```

We should figure out how the polynomial rings do it and we'll probably mimic that. Actually, we might want to do something more general like having this work:

```
sage: m = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).m()
sage: m(5)
5*m[]
sage: QQ(_)
5
```

Is it necessary to have it as a conversion? I'd be happy with a wrapper method for `_val`...
