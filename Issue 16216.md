I have provided a cythoned version of quiver paths (i.e., elements of path semigroups), based on the bounded integer sequences of #15820. All tests pass, so, needs review.

I didn't do timings yet. And hopefully it is ok that I slightly changed the syntax to create a path:

```
   old                       new
Q((1,1))                  Q([(1,1)])
Q([(1,2,'a'), (2,3,'b')]  Q(['a','b'])  # old syntax still works
Q((1,2,'a'))              Q([(1,2,'a')]) or Q('a')
```

In the outspoken expectation that nobody except myself has used the branch from this ticket, I took the liberty to rebase it on top of the latest fix at #15820. So, this is a forced push.

I suppose it still needs review.

Yes, but only for typesetting math stuff. I would just insert the character directly in unicode, and add the usual header to the file:

It's not completely unreasonable: in a field, the gcd of two elements can be arguably always set to 1. This is not what Sage does, but that's presumably Singular's choice.

```
    sage: gcd(4/1, 4/1)
    4
```


I don't know if it helps, but if you do the same calculation over ZZ, you get the desired result.

It helps to get a nicer normalisation. However, the main problem is that my formula is plain wrong.

After resolving the merge conflict, some test of bounded integer sequences fails. Note that it works fine if one just merges `develop` into #15820. So, the problem has apparently been created here, and thus it should be fixed here.

I use mpn_cmp and I use several `biseq_*` functions. So, I need to cimport stuff. You are right about the gmp.types and ntl/decl. 

Also I should probably use sig_on (around the raw bitset operations), so, better leave ext/interrupt in.

But I'll soon provide a commit that reduces the imports.

No, think of `.pxd` file like C `.h` files: it is needed for *other* modules to cimport this module: if another module does `from sage.quivers.paths cimport *`, then Cython will use the `paths.pxd` to do this cimport.

That's also the reason why the `.pxd` files should be minimal: every module which cimports `sage.quivers.paths` will need to look at all the stuff you put in the `paths.pxd` file.

Currently, I encode paths as a sequence of integers, where each integer uniquely determines an arrow in the quiver: The integers are bounded from above by the number of oriented arrows of the quiver.

There would be an alternative, sparser encoding as a sequence of integers, if one additionally provides the starting point: Each integer uniquely determines an outgoing arrow at one given vertex. 

Example: Assume that the underlying graph is just a cycle formed by 8 edges, and we have one arrow in each direction for each edge. Let x be the starting vertex of arrow 1, and the consecutive arrows in an oriented circle are numbered 1,...,8, and in the opposite circle are numbered 9,...16. Then, to encode the cycle starting at x, we currently present it as `<1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8>` in one and `<9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16>` in the other orientation.

But with the alternative encoding, we observe that there is exactly two outgoing arrows at each vertex. One directed circle starting at x could just be encoded as `(x, <1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1>)` and the opposite direction as `(x, <2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2>)`.

In other words, the bounded integer sequence in the current implementation has bound 17, but in the alternative implementation only has bound 3. It require less memory and thus some arithmetic operations might be faster. Detection of a sub-path will be slower, since it involves more work than testing a sub-sequence of a bounded integer sequence.

I am not sure what will be better for my application (computing Gr√∂bner bases does involve detection of sub-paths!).

My strategical question: Can I wait with the decision of what implementation to choose? Should it better be settled right away?

Actually, some operations (such as concatenation!) would stay exactly the same as they are now, and also note that currently I store start and end point of a path as cdef attributes of the path anyway. So, it may even be possible to have a parameter to choose the implementation at run time.

What do you think of it?

The point is that the speed of most operations depends on the bound of the integers. And the bound of the integers depends on the encoding.

> But if you really care, you need to benchmark...

In the latest commit, I allow to choose between two implementations. The choice happens when creating a path semigroup. Of course, having two implementations *in a single element class* is not optimal. I did it in this way in order to be able to do some benchmarks. Later, we should either pick a single implementation once and for all, or we should provide two distinct element classes for the two implementations.

Next, I'll try to come up with meaningful benchmarks.

In my applications, I will likely use paths as dictionary keys, I will multiply them, I will (for two-sided modules) test subpath containment or (for right modules) detect initial segments, and I will extract sub-paths.

The following benchmark may thus be representative for what is needed for two-sided modules:

```
sage: def test1(p1,p2):
....:     D = {}
....:     for i in range(1,100):
....:         D[p2^i*p1*p2^i] = i
....:     q = p2^10*p1*p2^50
....:     for x in D.keys():
....:         assert x.has_subpath(q) or D[x] < 50
....:     q = p2*p1*p2^120
....:     for x in D.keys():
....:         assert q.has_initial_segment(x[(D[x]-1)*len(p2):])
....:         
```

Let's apply this to the dense encoding:

```
sage: S = DiGraph({0:{1:['a'], 2:['b']}, 1:{0:['c'], 1:['d']}, 2:{0:['e'],2:['f']}}).path_semigroup()
sage: S.inject_variables()
Defining e_0, e_1, e_2, a, b, c, d, e, f
sage: p1 = a*d*c*b*f*e
sage: p2 = b*e*a*c
sage: %timeit test1(p1,p2)
1 loops, best of 3: 420 ms per loop
```

And for the non-dense encoding:

```
sage: S = DiGraph({0:{1:['a'], 2:['b']}, 1:{0:['c'], 1:['d']}, 2:{0:['e'],2:['f']}}).path_semigroup(False)
sage: S.inject_variables()
Defining e_0, e_1, e_2, a, b, c, d, e, f
sage: p1 = a*d*c*b*f*e
sage: p2 = b*e*a*c
sage: %timeit test1(p1,p2)
100 loops, best of 3: 4.26 ms per loop
```


The following benchmark hopefully addresses the tasks that are important in the case of right modules:

```
sage: def test2(p1,p2):
....:     D = {}
....:     for i in range(1,100):
....:         D[p2^i*p1*p2^i] = i
....:     q = p2^10*p1*p2^50
....:     for x in D.keys():
....:         assert D[x]<10 or (x[(D[x]-10)*len(p2):].has_initial_segment(q) or D[x]<50)
....:         
```

In the dense encoding:

```
sage: S = DiGraph({0:{1:['a'], 2:['b']}, 1:{0:['c'], 1:['d']}, 2:{0:['e'],2:['f']}}).path_semigroup()
sage: S.inject_variables()
Defining e_0, e_1, e_2, a, b, c, d, e, f
sage: p1 = a*d*c*b*f*e
sage: p2 = b*e*a*c
sage: %timeit test2(p1,p2)
1 loops, best of 3: 306 ms per loop
```

Versus the non-dense:

```
sage: S = DiGraph({0:{1:['a'], 2:['b']}, 1:{0:['c'], 1:['d']}, 2:{0:['e'],2:['f']}}).path_semigroup(False)
sage: S.inject_variables()
Defining e_0, e_1, e_2, a, b, c, d, e, f
sage: p1 = a*d*c*b*f*e
sage: p2 = b*e*a*c
sage: %timeit test2(p1,p2)
100 loops, best of 3: 3.99 ms per loop
```


The last benchmark shows that I should certainly avoid computing overlap (gcd) in the dense encoding:

```
sage: def test3(p1,p2):
....:     D = {}
....:     for i in range(1,100):
....:         D[p2^i*p1*p2^i] = i
....:     q = p2^10*p1*p2^50
....:     for x in D.keys():
....:         assert D[x]<10 or (x[(D[x]-10)*len(p2):].has_initial_segment(q) or D[x]<50)
....:     q = p2*p1*p2^120
....:     for x in D.keys():
....:         assert all(q.gcd(x))
....:         
```

The dense encoding:

```
sage: S = DiGraph({0:{1:['a'], 2:['b']}, 1:{0:['c'], 1:['d']}, 2:{0:['e'],2:['f']}}).path_semigroup()
sage: S.inject_variables()
Defining e_0, e_1, e_2, a, b, c, d, e, f
sage: p1 = a*d*c*b*f*e
sage: p2 = b*e*a*c
sage: %timeit test3(p1,p2)
1 loops, best of 3: 1.44 s per loop
```

The non-dense encoding:

```
sage: S = DiGraph({0:{1:['a'], 2:['b']}, 1:{0:['c'], 1:['d']}, 2:{0:['e'],2:['f']}}).path_semigroup(False)
sage: S.inject_variables()
Defining e_0, e_1, e_2, a, b, c, d, e, f
sage: p1 = a*d*c*b*f*e
sage: p2 = b*e*a*c
sage: %timeit test3(p1,p2)
100 loops, best of 3: 9.31 ms per loop
```


Looks like the non-dense encoding beats the dense encoding in all tests. However, in the following test, the dense encoding is slightly faster:

```
sage: def test4(p1,p2):                                                          
....:     D = {}
....:     for i in range(1,100):
....:         D[p2^i*p1*p2^i] = i
....:     q = p2^10 
....:     for x in D.keys():
....:         assert x.has_initial_segment(q) or D[x]<10
....:         
```

Dense:

```
sage: S = DiGraph({0:{1:['a'], 2:['b']}, 1:{0:['c'], 1:['d']}, 2:{0:['e'],2:['f']}}).path_semigroup()
sage: S.inject_variables()
Defining e_0, e_1, e_2, a, b, c, d, e, f
sage: p1 = a*d*c*b*f*e
sage: p2 = b*e*a*c
sage: %timeit test4(p1,p2)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.47 ms per loop
```

Non-dense:

```
sage: S = DiGraph({0:{1:['a'], 2:['b']}, 1:{0:['c'], 1:['d']}, 2:{0:['e'],2:['f']}}).path_semigroup(False)
sage: S.inject_variables()
Defining e_0, e_1, e_2, a, b, c, d, e, f
sage: p1 = a*d*c*b*f*e
sage: p2 = b*e*a*c
sage: %timeit test4(p1,p2)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.57 ms per loop
```


__Conclusion__

It seems to me that the dense encoding may be an interesting idea, but for most (if not all) applications is not better than the simpler non-dense encoding.

__Question__

Shall I simply remove the dense implementation? Or should I turn it into a separate element class, so that a potential user may benefit from alternative implementations?

Did I not correct that error?

Too bad, it could be that I corrected it in #17435, since I had the impression I had introduced it there. Well, with mercurial we could now simply move the patch from there to here...

The explanation of above error is of course that I made the tests on a 32bit machine, but you have 64bit. Meanwhile, I have switched to 64bit too, and at that point I corrected the error (but on the wrong ticket, I am afraid).

That's for hash. Again, there is no dedicated hash function for `biseq_t`.

Pickling is defined for `BoundedIntegerSequence`, not for `biseq_t`.

Or are you saying I *should* implement those functions on the level of `biseq_t`?

Since I tend to get things wrong in git, I need more details.

Do I understand correctly that you suggest to take all the commits from here, squash them into one commit, and force-push here. Thus:

```
git checkout -b new_branch_for_here branch_17564
git merge --squash branch_from_here
git commit
git trac push --forced --ticket=16453
```

(or however a forced push is done).

I am not sure that that's what I want. If I understood correctly what Nathann said, he as a reviewer prefers to have a sequence of commits each addressing a single feature, and ideally there should be no merge commits and no commits that simply revert the effect of previous mistaken commits. If Nathann reads it: Would this be what you'd like to get?

So, perhaps

```
git checkout branch_from_here
git rebase -i branch_17564
```

followed by a forced push would be better, since then I can interactively choose which commits from here to squash and which to preserve.

Anyway, I'd agree to force-push, even though #17435 is based on this ticket. Probably I am the only one who is actively using these branches.

Hi Vincent,

> These paths have more applications than quivers (e.g. [train-tracks for free group automorphisms](https://github.com/coulbois/sage-train-track)). Could you move it from `src.sage.quivers` to `sage.graphs`?

`sage.graphs` is quite large already, that's why I created the new module `sage.quivers`, for everything that implements representation theoretic aspects of directed multigraphs.

I could imagine to use cythoned path algebra elements (see #17435) to provide a better implementation of free associative algebras, but a potential application is no reason to move the code, IMHO.

Do you really need oriented paths for train tracks? Or do you rather need sequences of integers to implement train tracks? If the integers are subject to a global bound, then see `sage.data_structures.bounded_integer_sequences`.

> And also remove the name 'quivers' from there.. why not `GraphPaths`?

Most people understand "graph" as a non-directed graph. But we are talking here about objects for which orientation is absolutely essential. The original Python code for quivers and their representation had to make a difference between two different notions of paths in a graph, one being a sequence of vertices, the other being a sequence of edges. `QuiverPaths` is about paths as sequences of *directed* edges.

When developing the current Python code for quiver representations, there was some discussion about terminology. "Quiver" is a well-established mathematical notion, so, good to use. It is the same as multi-digraph, but is a shorter word. It seems that the decision was to use "`DiGraph`" in Sage to denote the mere directed graph, whereas one uses "`Quiver`" when one considers the directed graph as an algebraic object.

While it may be acceptable to replace the word "Quiver" by "`DiGraph`", it can certainly not be replaced by the word "Graph". Hence, changing `QuiverPath` into `GraphPath` would be misleading. I am against that change.

> Actually, for train track automorphisms one needs the groupoid of paths (that is authorize to take edges in reversed direction). As far as I understand, it is different from yours. Do you have an idea for a compatible terminology?

Well, the current terminology for the algebraic object formed by the oriented paths in a multi-digraph subject to concatenation is "path semigroup", and thus the terminology for your groupoid of invertible paths would naturally be "path groupoid", isn't it?

Yes, I really mean oriented paths. And also (di)graph maps, that is function that maps edges to paths. These are not at all quiver morphisms as they are defined in wikipedia.

The original Python code for quivers and their representation had to make a difference between two different notions of paths in a graph, one being a sequence of vertices, the other being a sequence of edges. `QuiverPaths` is about paths as sequences of *directed* edges.

Then `DiGraphPaths`? If you say `Quiver` in a talk on Geometric Group Theory to talk about train-track, I bet that the public would be quite surprised.

I see. But Quiver for me already denotes representation theory (you should agree with me since you said "`sage.quiver` for everything that implements representation theoretic aspects of directed multigraphs" and Wikipedia as well).

All right, I understand. But `DiGraphPath`? My concern is that if Thierry did not mentioned to me your previous ticket about sequences of bounded integers I would never have found it.

It is. But I do not want to have it in `src.sage.quivers` and it would be logical to have it close to implementation of the path semigroup (and they will surely share some of their features).

I would be happy to finish the review of this ticket, but I want it to be a starting point for the path groupoid as well.

I don't know why "git trac push" didn't work. Anyway, "git push" did work, and I am updating the "commit" field manually.

I added a doctest for the lazy attribute `_nb_arrows` of path semigroups. I don't think one should not add a doctest for `QuiverPaths.__cmp__`: As usual for Cythonised element classes, one has to copy the `__cmp__` from `sage.structure.element`, because of technical reasons. The actual comparison is done in `_cmp_c_impl`, which *is* doctested.

But perhaps it makes sense to remove the phrase

```
        As usual in Sage, the ``__cmp__`` method of a Python sub-class of
        :class:`sage.structure.element.Element` can assume that both arguments
        belong to the same parent.
```

from the documentation of `_cmp_c_impl`, since after all it is not a Python sub-class any longer. Will do this next.

Hello,

0. I still would be very happy to have a class `GraphPaths` that would avoid quiver terminology. Though, I can factor out what I need for train-tracks later on.

1. Why `deg` instead of `degree`? And why not making aliases

```
degree = __len__
length = __len__
```

 That would avoid duplication of the documentation.

2. For the slices, it is much faster to use `PySlice_GetIndicesEx` (see e.g. `sage.combinat.words.word_char`)

3. Please add a definition for `gcd`

4. In `sage.combinat.words` we used `has_prefix` instead of `has_initial_segment`. It would be cool to keep a uniform terminology if it is not too bad from the quiver terminology point of view.

5. `PY_NEW(X)` -> `X.__new__`

6. Are you sure you need to initialize the `_path.length` to `0` in `__cinit__`?

7. Why would you need the function `NewQuiverPath` that essentially duplicates the `_new_`. Note that most parents implement `_new_X`. Moreover, because you can use `type.__new__` I would rather remove your method `_new_`.

Hi!

Replying to [comment:111 vdelecroix]:
> 0. I still would be very happy to have a class `GraphPaths` that would avoid quiver terminology. Though, I can factor out what I need for train-tracks later on.

I would somehow prefer to keep it there. After all, it was created with applications on quivers in mind.

> 1. Why `deg` instead of `degree`?

I think I was used to "deg" from a different CAS. Since it is `degree()` for polynomials, and since generally we seem to avoid abbreviations in method names, I agree this should be changed.

> And why not making aliases
> {{{
> degree = __len__
> length = __len__
> }}}
>  That would avoid duplication of the documentation.

Good idea!

> 2. For the slices, it is much faster to use `PySlice_GetIndicesEx` (see e.g. `sage.combinat.words.word_char`)

Thanks for the hint!

> 4. In `sage.combinat.words` we used `has_prefix` instead of `has_initial_segment`. It would be cool to keep a uniform terminology if it is not too bad from the quiver terminology point of view.

There is no particular reason for choosing "has_initial_segment". So, a uniform terminology seems possible here.

> 5. `PY_NEW(X)` -> `X.__new__`

OK, I heard that meanwhile the speed is the same.

> 6. Are you sure you need to initialize the `_path.length` to `0` in `__cinit__`?

I am sure that I did it for a reason (i.e., something crashed when not setting the length to zero in `__cinit__`), but I don't recall. Let's try if it works...

> 7. Why would you need the function `NewQuiverPath` that essentially duplicates the `_new_`. Note that most parents implement `_new_X`. Moreover, because you can use `type.__new__` I would rather remove your method `_new_`.

OK, that somehow makes sense. I don't think I can provide `_new_X` on the parent, since I need to take care of cdef stuff (the parent isn't in a cython file), but replacing `QuiverPath._new_` by `NewQuiverPath` should be possible.

And of course I should take care of merging...

Oops, I just notice I forgot this...

Done.

`QuiverPath.__new__` should do the job.

Here is a comparison. The old code:

```
sage: D = DiGraph({0:{0:['x','y','z']}}).path_semigroup()
sage: L = sum([list(D.iter_paths_by_length_and_startpoint(i,0)) for i in range(5)], [])
sage: %timeit [p.reverse() for p in L]
10 loops, best of 3: 44.3 ms per loop
```

The new code:

```
sage: %timeit [p.reverse() for p in L]
10 loops, best of 3: 44 ms per loop
```


Hmmm. It didn't really improve. Perhaps you have a better idea to make it faster?

Me too. I just run cython on a `cmp(a,b)` and just found out the crazy piece of code I get! I will see whether I can provide a fix on the Cython side.

For the sake of this ticket, you might factor:

```
cdef inline int c_int_cmp(int a, int b):
   return (a > b) - (a < b)
```

and then

```
cdef int c
c = c_int_cmp(other._path.length, cself._path.length)
if c: return c
c = c_int_cmp(cself._start, other._start)
if c: return c
c = c_int_cmp(cself._end, other._end)
if c: return c
...
```

  that way when Cython is up to date with `cmp` you can just replace `c_int_cmp -> cmp`.

Indeed. Adding ``@`cached_method` to `PathSemigroup.reverse` I got a great speedup. With

```
sage: G = DiGraph(loops=True)
sage: G.add_edge(1,1,'a')
sage: G.add_edge(1,2,'b')
sage: G.add_edge(2,1,'c')
sage: P = G.path_semigroup()
sage: e1,e2,a,b,c=P.gens()
sage: p = a*b*c*b*c*a*a
```


then without cache

```
sage: timeit("p.reverse()", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 179 ¬µs per loop
```

and with cache

```
sage: timeit("p.reverse()", number=1000)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1 ¬µs per loop
```


Is it worth it? Actually it would be nicer for `P.reverse().reverse() is P` to be true. Possible hack

```
@cached_method
def reverse(self):
    p = self._quiver.reverse().path_semigroup()
    p.reverse.set_cache(self)
    return p
```

What is P here? If P is a path semigroup, I agree that `P.reverse().reverse()` should be identical with P. But if P is a path, I would disagree.

Is that really needed? I thought that `UniqueRepresentation` did the job. So, using a `cached_method` would not be needed to ensure uniqueness, but would speed-up things.

I'll test.

Indeed. With the current code, we already have 

```
sage: D = DiGraph({0:{1:['x','y','z']}, 1:{0:['a','b','c']}}).path_semigroup()
sage: D.reverse().reverse() is D
True
```

Timing:

```
sage: %timeit D.reverse().reverse()
1000 loops, best of 3: 806 ¬µs per loop
```


But with a cached method, we get

```
sage: D = DiGraph({0:{1:['x','y','z']}, 1:{0:['a','b','c']}}).path_semigroup()
sage: D.reverse().reverse() is D
True
sage: %timeit D.reverse().reverse()
The slowest run took 16.68 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 243 ns per loop
```


I'd be against having `p.reverse().reverse() is p` for a *path* p.

Hi Simon,

12. Trailing whitespaces in the last line of the docstring of `has_prefix`. And also one in `_cmp_`.

23. In `__getitem__` you are building the whole list of edges of the unerlying graph but uses only at most two! I also guess that in the particular case that you are building a path starting from the same vertex there is no need to build this list.

34. Still in `__getitem__`, what about supporting `-1` for the slices, i.e. `path[::-1]` would return the reverse? You can put that on the wish list, but this is how words behave

```
sage: w = Word("abbaaca")
sage: w[::-1]
word: acaabba
sage: w[4:1:-1]
word: aab
```

  and by the way `reverse` is called `reversal` there

```
sage: w.reversal()
word: acaabba
```


15. Still with terminology, there are two different notions of *subword* and *factors*:
   - the *factors* of `aba` are ``, `a`, `b`, `ab`, `ba` and `aba`,
   - `aa` is a *subword* of `aba` but not a *factor*.

   But I guess that `subpath` is clear enough.

26. Could you make `_cmp_`, `_repr_`, `__getitem__`, `__mod__`, `__iter__`, `_mul_` appear in the documentation (using the sphinx directive `automethod`)? `__len__` is ok since it has aliases.

37. Could you avoid mentioning `self` in the method descriptions? You can replace by `this path`.

48. The convention for `__nonzero__` is different from words where the empty word is considered zero. What do you think?

59. There is no need to duplicate the `INPUT/OUTPUT` in the class docstring and the `__init__`. Accessing the help on the class with `?` you are getting both. And I found strange to have an `OUTPUT` section here.

20. (independent of this ticket) The category is set to semigroup but would rather be semigroupoid... this is a partial operation! In particular the `TestSuite` failed on any non-trivial graphs because it tries to multiply `None` with paths. Though I like the convention of returning `None` if multiplication is not defined.

Hi Vincent,

I just found that I need to revert my previous changes in the `reverse()` (soon to become `reversal()`) method: I can not simply revert the underlying bounded integer sequence, since in the reversed quiver the edge numbering won't match.

The big question is whether it is possible to create a reverse quiver so that the numbering DOES match...

What I write below refers to a commit that I can't publish, because of the problem with "reverse()". But perhaps you can already comment...

Replying to [comment:130 vdelecroix]:

Done.

I know the INDEX of two edges in the list of all edges of the underlying graph, and I need to find out the start resp. end point of the two edges. Please tell me how to get the two edges (and ask for there start/end points) without having to pick them from the list of all edges.

> I also guess that in the particular case that you are building a path starting from the same vertex there is no need to build this list.

I think the only case in which there is no need to find out the start/end points of two edges (given by indices) in the graph is the case of `p[:]` (which returns `p`). I made this a special case, but other than that I don't see how to avoid the list of all edges (unless there is a cached TUPLE of edges of the graph, so that there is no need to re-create a list each time the list of edges is requested).

Hmmm, perhaps it makes sense to store the tuple of edges in the path semigroup! What do you think?

OK, good idea.

Who says that? I would never say that `aa` is a subword of `aba`.

It is not very common to include magic Python methods (or their SageMath equivalents) into the docs. For good or bad.

I tried to. In one case, where `self` appears in an equation, I left it in.

I guess you may be right. But I hope it won't create a problem in path algebras. If it does, then I should take care of it there, though.

> 19. There is no need to duplicate the `INPUT/OUTPUT` in the class docstring and the `__init__`. Accessing the help on the class with `?` you are getting both. And I found strange to have an `OUTPUT` section here.

Indeed, but I think we have no semigroupoid yet.

I don't like that convention, but I think it is a well-established convention in the category/coercion world.

The problem with "reverse" is that graphs sort the edges first by start- and endpoint and then by label. However, for my code, it makes more sense to just sort by labels (which are supposed to be unique). So, I could address both issues by storing a sorted list of edges and edge labels in the path semigroup.

I see... one way is to keep in the `PathSemigroup`:
- the list of edges
- a dictionary `edge -> index`
In order to ensure canonicity, you can just sort the list with respect to the labels. The problem is that in the constructor you check uniqueness but not sortability and that might be an issue! Do you mind if the labels are asked to have a total order? As a first approximation you can check that they all have the same type being one of: `int`, `float`, `Integer`, `Rational`, `str`, ... (and possibly add a keyword `assume_total_order`).

This is basically what you did propose but you need to check that the set of labels is indeed sortable!

Sage does

```
sage: Word("aa").is_subword_of(Word("aba"))
True
```

And in Lothaire book "combinatorics on words"

```
A word v in A^* is said to be a subword of x in A^* if 

    v = a_1 a_2 ... a_n

and there exists y_0, y_1, ..., y_n in A^* such that

   x = y_0 a_1 y_1 a_2 ... a_n y_n

Therefore v is a subword of is it is a sub-sequence of x.
```

I do not know. If you look at the category of groups for instance, there is an implementation of `__nonzero__` in elements as `return False`. So I was more asking what do you think instead of asking you to change anything.

Unbelievable. Both from algebraic and linguistic point of view I would say that Sage's answer is wrong.

Nice notion, but nothing that I would call a subword or sub-sequence.

Sorry, I have to correct myself.

I do call it a sub-sequence (in calculus, one has statements such as "x is a cumulation point of a sequence if and only if there is a sub-sequence converging to x"), but I would not call it a sub-word. Python seems to agree:

```
sage: 'aa' in 'abac'
False
sage: 'ba' in 'abac'
True
```


And in the case of paths, it is *not* true that a sub-sequence of arrows gives rise to a path (in a path, the end/starting points of consecutive arrows must match). So, for sub-paths, it simply makes no sense to adopt the notion of a sub-word that Sage unfortunately uses.

Here I do not like so much Python convention because you might not want consider 'contains' as an equivalent of 'factor'. For words, we did adopt the convetion that 'contains' means that the letter is contained in. Just like for lists, tuples

```
sage: [0, 1] in [0, 1, 2]

sage: p = Q([(1, 2, 'a'), (2, 3, 'b'), (3, 1, 'd'), (1, 2, 'a'), (2, 3, 'b'), (3, 4, 'c')])

Removing the last two commits, getitem is much slower:

sage: p = Q([(1, 2, 'a'), (2, 3, 'b'), (3, 1, 'd'), (1, 2, 'a'), (2, 3, 'b'), (3, 4, 'c')])

The slowest run took 4.42 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached

```


I suppose the reason for the improvement is, again, avoiding to recreate the list of edges of the quiver.

I removed that line and added a test for `__cmp__` (sorry, I forgot to add "indirect doctest").

Hello Simon,

21. I propose a commit to simplify the `check` in element construction. It removes the argument from the `QuiverPath` and move all the code to check inside ` PathSemigroup`. In doing so I removed the ability to initialize a path from

```
[(1,1), (1,2,'a'), (2,2)]
```

  Tell me what you think.

22. Are you intensively using the iteration over paths? If so, note that it can be much much faster.

I think that's rather reasonable.

In my applications, I would never represent a path in that way. So, it's fine for me.

No.

How? I don't use iteration so much, but other people might do.

- no recursion, this is a simple depth first search in the tree of all paths
- initialize all paths of length 1 as `QuiverPath`s, put them in a dictionary `s -> path of length 1 with label s` or `i -> list of edges starting from i` (I would use the second form). Then use concatenation to build larger paths from smaller ones.
- maintain the list of prefix used

Do you want it to be done in this ticket?

I am! And the patchbot confirms that tests pass.

Just to cross-verify: The patchbot complains that the branch introduces a non-ascii character (in "Poincar√©"). Since I use the encoding utf-8 in the file, the documentation should build fine. So, do you agree that the non-ascii character is not a problem?
