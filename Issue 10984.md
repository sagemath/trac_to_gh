From [this ask.sagemath](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/479/plot-sqrtsinx) question:

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: plot(sqrt(sin(x)),(0,10))
verbose 0 (4069: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 74 points.
verbose 0 (4069: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message: ''
```

The picture is attached.  
| Sage Version 4.6.2, Release Date: 2011-02-25                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
Ideally, we would want plot to just not connect those pieces.  With just sqrt(x) over -1 to 1, it's not a problem, but this really does look bad.

This should be resolved as duplicate of #13246. This ticket is older, but the other one has discussion and a patch.

(It seems I cannot do this by myself.)

Agreed.

(It's true you can't do this by yourself, but you _can_ change the status and then the release manager can close it.)

And now just add your real name to the list of reviewers (I couldn't find it easily on Trac).

Thank you.

(Ah, as a newbie I had not noticed that this special milestone is used instead of having 'resolved' and 'closed' as separate steps.)
