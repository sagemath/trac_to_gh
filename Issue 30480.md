it's comes up often, and indeed can only be found on the wiki.

we should also fix Zenodo integration, currently it errors out on releases for some reason.

I switched SSL on on the Zenodo configs for [SageMath](SageMath), and it seems to have liked it, so far. Let's see if a new record for 9.1 will appear.

Do you suggest to make a biblatex entry, too? Good idea!

I always use biblatex with bibtex (as a backend), so if you know how the "native" biblatex entry should look like, please post it here.

zenodo is fixed, but see #30737 to get it to produce a meaningful output (currently the list of authors it generates makes little sense)

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

With biblatex+biber, the following works for me (both with alphabetic and numeric styles).

```
@manual{sagemath,
  label        = {Sag},
  author       = {{The Sage Developers}},
  title        = {{S}ageMath, the {S}age {M}athematics {S}oftware {S}ystem},
  url          = {https://www.sagemath.org},
  version      = {9.4},
  year         = {2021},
}
```

Is "{S}age {M}athematics {S}oftware {S}ystem}" really the proper name of Sage? never heard that

According to the wiki https://wiki.sagemath.org/Publications_using_SageMath, this is what's recommended.

The markup of the links in the new DOI section is not correct, as you can see in the formatted HTML documentation: https://145bb157f207200e8e80aaca37ec084063c4211a--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/faq/faq-general.html#i-want-to-cite-sage-in-a-publication-how-do-i-do-it

I thought "Software System" is too much. But looking at this

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Software_System_Award

the term seems appropriate.

Sphinx is throwing a warning for me if we have an external link code and don't use it, and in building the html documentation we treat warnings as errors.

Here, ``DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6259615 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6259615>`_ ` causes a warning. 

Rewriting this as `:doi:`DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6259615 <10.5281/zenodo.6259615>`` gets rid of the warning. This occurs once again later. In total, I suggest something like


```diff

You can simply use `:doi:`10.5281/zenodo.6259615``
