Sphinx is throwing a warning for me if we have an external link code and don't use it, and in building the html documentation we treat warnings as errors.

Here, ``DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6259615 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6259615>`_ ` causes a warning. 

Rewriting this as `:doi:`DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6259615 <10.5281/zenodo.6259615>`` gets rid of the warning. This occurs once again later. In total, I suggest something like
