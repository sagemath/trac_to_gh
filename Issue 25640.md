# Issue 25640: dehomogenize for projecgive morphism failure in number field order

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25877

Original creator: bhutz

Original creation time: 2018-07-18 17:42:54

When the 'denominator' is a constant dehomogenization fails


```
K.<w>=QuadraticField(3)
O=K.ring_of_integers()
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(O,1)
H=End(P)
f=H([x^2 - O(w)*y^2,y^2])
f.dehomogenize(1)
```

Fixed.

Interestingly it caused a doc test failure in projective_ds.py. Extending the precision, it looks like the new value is actually the correct one so I updated the test.
