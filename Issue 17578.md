What use is `sage.misc.misc.verbose("WARNING:...` in `plot.py` when no possible verbosity level will turn off the output?

```
sage: verbose(level=-1)
verbose -1 (<module>) 
5.786
sage: plot(sqrt(x),(x,-1,3))
verbose 0 (2691: plot.py, generate_plot_points) WARNING: When plotting, failed to evaluate function at 51 points.
verbose 0 (2691: plot.py, generate_plot_points) Last error message: 'math domain error'
