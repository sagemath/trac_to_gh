I have added an "Apply" list for this ticket.

My patch fixes one typo in the documentation (a missing ]).

I have added some non-trivial tests.

Jeroen:

1.  abs() for a matrix computes the determinant.  Not useful for testing.

2.  Is there a class of polynomials with numerical coefficients?  Does it have abs() defined on it?

I am working on this as a high-priority ticket for Bug Days 32.

This ticket is pretty amazing.

Rob, this doctest you added seems very wrong:

```

   A relative tolerance on a root of a polynomial.
    
   ::
   
       sage: p = (y - 10^16)*(y-10^(-13))*(y-2); p
       y^3 + (-1e+16)*y^2 + (2e+16)*y - 2000.0
       sage: p.roots()
       sage: p.roots(multiplicities=False)[2]     # relative tol 1e-10
       10^16
```


In particular, 

* it seems that y isn't defined
* the output of `p.roots()` is missing
* I get an output of `1e16` instead of `10^16`.

This doesn't work. Re Leif's comment, I think the regexp should something like `' ((\.[0-9]+|[0-9]+(\.[0-9]*)?)e[+-]?[0-9]+)'`, which adds another group to the match, so we need to make this change:

    3.14159

Here is another example::

    sage: [10^n for n in [0.0 .. 4]]            # rel tol 2e-4
    [0.9999, 10.001, 100.01, 999.9, 10001]

And another::

    sage: RDF(pi)                               # abs tol 1e-4
    3.14159

And that's the end.
"""
```

Save this as "new.py" and run "sage -t new.py" to see some bad behavior.

But that doesn't match `1ee7` :(

You can of course match funny things first, i.e. use more general patterns, but you then have to check the matched expression further before passing it to `float()`.

The whole idea isn't that bad, but carries the danger that people simply increase the tolerance (too much) just to make doctests pass *somehow*, without caring where the variations originate from.

Added complexity? One boolean variable, initialized to false and set to `True` in only a few places?

This not only reduces the file size and run (import!) time but also avoids more potential name clashes.

Since the whole ticket had a positive review earlier, I think if you're happy with my changes, you can switch it back to that status.

Finally, the issue with doctests in `conventions.rst` is, I think, that the various triple quotes `"""` confuse the parsing routine (the function `pythonify_rst` in particular).  This belongs on another ticket.  That file contains enough incomplete code stubs that I wonder if it shouldn't be doctested at all...

Yes, only

sage: foo   # tol 1ee7
anything
```

should always pass. ;-)

Haven't tested your patch (nor looked at it), but the output you gave looks much better.

I won't object, though I in general don't like the idea of adding code (regardless how small the overhead or impact might be) unconditionally, i.e., if there's no need to do so.

We have similar situations all around, where everybody adds "just a little", IMHO.

Currently, it raises an error indicating that the *doctest* itself is bad.

Yes, it's a tradeoff between adding "just a little" python parsing overhead to the testing infrastructure or "just a little" human parsing overhead to the testing infrastructure. I'd rather put the burden on machines than developers in this case. 

The reviewer patches look good, certainly an improvement, so I'm setting this back to positive review unless there's something else that needs to be taken care of.

I'd like to draw the attention of folks here to comment:7:ticket:12493.  Apparently one can't do `only-optional` tests along with `tol` tests at the same time.   My guess is that not too many people use `only-optional` and the `tol` stuff is pretty new.

In fact, I only found one occurrence in 5.0.beta3.  Can that be right?  This has been in Sage for months!

```
sage: search_src(" tol ","#")
symbolic/integration/integral.py:587:        sage: error.numerical_approx() # abs tol 10e-10
```

Anyway, even if my analysis is wrong (let's hope it's easier than that), I figure the people here can give a quick diagnosis of #12493.

Actually, comment:8:ticket:12493 is even better!  Optional and tol don't play well together.
