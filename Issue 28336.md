"There are too many changes going on at once, so that a merge in the end might be difficult. In order to avoid such difficulties and to keep an overview of things that are happening (for me and others), I use this ticket from now on as a metaticket, where all latest changes are merged together." (copied from #28519). 

Tickets:

- #28074: Fix caching of Macaulay2 polynomial rings
- #28565: improve introspection of Macaulay2 interface
- #28566: improve conversions between Macaulay2 and Sage
- #28567: allow user to specify strategy for Groebner basis computations with Macaulay2
- #28568: implement _install_hints method for the Macaulay2 interface
- #28571: pass 'macaulay2' as argument to '_macaulay2_init_()'
- #28572: conversion of quotient rings to macaulay2

I created a branch that merges all the tickets together to see if there was any merge conflict. There was one, but it was easy to resolve.

- #28565
- #28568
- #28566
- #28567
- #28571
- #28572
- #28574

and everything merges cleanly.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
