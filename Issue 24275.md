On the way to propose a patch, I realized that we have the same issue with 
`G = graphs.CycleGraph(2)`. However, when I set node positions, the edge is visible.

```
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(2)
sage: G.get_pos()
{0: (6.123233995736766e-17, 1.0), 1: (-1.8369701987210297e-16, -1.0)}
sage: G.show()
sage: G.set_pos({0:(0, 0), 1:(0, 1)})
sage: G.show()
```


An easy solution is to set these positions for cycle graphs and use cycle graphs in wheel graphs when `n < 3`.

Do you have a better suggestion ?

The problem might be that in the old implementation `graphs.WheelGraph(5).edges()`
and `graphs.WheelGraph(5).edges_iterator()` gave the same order, but in the new implementation these are different (which is not a bug AFAIK); namely, one gets

```

I'd say it's a bug in the graphic matroids code, and it is beyond the scope of this ticket. 

On a practical note, could we have a less intrusive branch here, which only touches the plotting positions, but not the underlying graph?
And we'd open another ticket to deal with graphic matroids code, so please keep this branch alive as an illustration of the bug.

The GraphicMatroid issue arises because this line will automatically assign integer labels to the edges:

`sage: M = Matroid(range(8), graphs.WheelGraph(5))`

If the order of edge_iterator changes, the labeling of the edges will change (sage.matroids.constructor.py line 797).

It's not a bug in the matroid code, but the test was constructed kind of lazily, where it didn't explicitly specify an edge labeling. I recommend changing the tests to fix this. Easiest is to create the labeled graph explicitly, like so:


```
sage: G = Graph([(0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 1), (0, 3, 2), (0, 4, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 6), (3, 4, 7)])
sage: M = Matroid(G)
sage: M1 = M.graphic_coextension(0, X=[1,2], element='a')
sage: M1.graph().edges()
[(0, 1, 0),
 (0, 4, 3),
 (0, 5, 'a'),
 (1, 2, 4),
 (1, 4, 5),
 (2, 3, 6),
 (2, 5, 1),
 (3, 4, 7),
 (3, 5, 2)]
```



Edited to add:

I got that edge list in the first line directly from the old doctest code, like this:

```
M = Matroid(range(8), graphs.WheelGraph(5))
M.graph().edges()
```

so translating the doctests shouldn't be too onerous.

I don't see how this is not a bug in matroid code.

I think what happens is that if Matroid is called with 2 arguments, i.e. labels and the graph, this is not always working correctly (i.e. you create a matroid which is subtly broken so that `graphic_coextension` breaks. Indeed, with the new WheelGraph code, the following works:

sage: G=graphs.WheelGraph(5)
sage: M = Matroid(G)
sage: M.graphic_coextension(0,X=[(0,2),(0,3)])

```

but the following does not:

```

So I think here we can simply change the test to

```
sage: M = Matroid(graphs.WheelGraph(5))
sage: M.graphic_coextension(0,X=[(0,2),(0,3)])
Graphic matroid of rank 5 on 9 elements
```

and deal with matroids in #24573.

Ah. Yes, if the ground set gets specified both through edge labels and an explicit list, the constructor does not try to match them up. That is a small bug. I disagree that it creates a broken matroid; it simply creates a matroid with an edge labeling different from the one you expect.

This is not an example of the bug you described, though. `G` has no edge labels internally, so the assignment of the labels `range(8)` to the edges should be considered random.

OK, I was totally confused by your `G` above. Now I see that indeed, it suffices to adjust X (perhaps this is what you meant to say), by looking at `M.graph().edges()`:

```
sage: G=graphs.WheelGraph(5)
sage: M = Matroid(range(8),G)
sage: M.graph().edges()
[(0, 1, 2),
 (0, 2, 4),
 (0, 3, 6),
 (0, 4, 7),
 (1, 2, 0),
 (1, 4, 1),
 (2, 3, 3),
 (3, 4, 5)]
sage: M.graphic_coextension(0,X=[4,6]) # 4,6 are labels of 02 and 03
Graphic matroid of rank 5 on 9 elements
```

So this is how to fix the doctest - just 1-line change:

```
sage: M.graphic_coextension(0,X=[4,6])
```

The only thing to fix in matroids is documentation of the function in question, which made it impossible to understand what the input should be. As you see in comment 15, it's the change of edge labelling generated by the matroid code (so edges 1 and 2 are no longer incident to vertex 0).
One fix suggested by Stefan in comment 12 is to use graph with edge labelling already generated:

```
sage: G = Graph([(0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 1), (0, 3, 2), (0, 4, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 5), (2, 3, 6), (3, 4, 7)])
sage: M = Matroid(G)
sage: M1 = M.graphic_coextension(0, X=[1,2], element='a')
```

This should be the most robust way.

Another way might be to use the updated labels, just 1-line change:

```
sage: M.graphic_coextension(0,X=[4,6])
```

which is potentially flaky, as it relies on the labelling one does not have control over.
