It would have been helpful to keep the commit in my name, I guess... but at any rate s-m only contributed the instructions for sws2rst, so I'm removing that.  Thanks for the review.

The last commit has not been merged, see the discussion at [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/tQhromqp9hQ/KDCvCnKEd1kJ).
The last commit was "only" the change of the author of the commit, so I do not open a new ticket.
