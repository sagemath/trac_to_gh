CC:  isuruf mkoeppe arojas

currently openblas's spkg-configure.pc unconditionally makes cblas.pc and lapack.pc copies of openblas.pc, which in some cases if incorrect, e.g. Arch Linux has libcblas linked to libopenblas
and containing stuff missing in libopenblas, resulting in errors.

this has been reported on sage-devel
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/pIOnFyFJMtM/_FbzM2OxCQAJ

So we should make these installations conditional.

we can do an `AC_LINK_IFELSE()` test with a subroutine `dgeqef` call,
and try to link it against libopenblas. this would be independent of Fortran compiler.

I think your issue is caused by the same .pc stale symlinks that are making the build fail with sage's openblas. fflas-ffpack's spkg-install has `LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs cblas)"`, which should return `-lcblas` on Arch, but it is returning `-lopenblas` for you.

The fact that LINBOX_BLAS is set to -lcblas on Arch makes fflas-ffpack not detect openblas (since -lcblas doesn't provide openblas_set_num_threads), so it is compiled without openblas optimizations.

To fix this, `LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs cblas)"` should be replaced with ` LINBOX_BLAS="$(pkg-config --libs blas cblas)"` in fflas-ffpack's spkg-install, which would return `-lopenblas -lcblas` on Arch and wouldn't make any difference on systems where openblas provides cblas

The above is coherent with the symlinks provided in Sage

```
(sage-sh)$ ls -l local/lib/pkgconfig/ | grep blas

But not with what I have in `/usr/lib/pkgconfig/`

Removing the symlinks and setting them according to what is in `/usr/lib` seems to fix the issue

```
$ rm /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc
$ ln -s /usr/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/
$ ln -s /usr/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc /opt/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/
```

That `make distclean` removes `src/lib/pkgconfig` entirely would make sense to me.

After all, sage-the-distribution has a mechanism to install `gfortran` itself. We shouldn't break that.

actually, I don't see the  point of this `if` at all. If we get there then it's already true, as it's inside the check for `gfortran` as a pre-req, in the scope of `SAGE_SPKG_DEPCHECK([gfortran], ...)`.
