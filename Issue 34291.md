If you wish to do Sage development, we recommend that you additionally install the following:

sudo apt-get install  autoconf automake git gpgconf libtool openssh openssh-client pkg-config

Is this not misleading now? If I'm not mistaken without e.g. autoconf or automake even the bootstrap command will fail. So these tools are a hard requirement and not a recommendation, right?

I think you missed the paragraph leading to the section with these long generated command-lines:

> My understanding is that you only need to use the bootstrap command if you are testing new packages. If you are working solely within the Sage library, you shouldn't need it.
