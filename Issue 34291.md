It looks pretty good to me, although I haven't gone through every detail, in part because there are various dependencies which either need review or maybe don't exist yet? (Does anything need to be done for #32074, which is a dependency for #34266?)


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-09-19 20:51:50

I only made #32074 a dependency so that #34266 does not get accidentally merged into Sage 9.7. I'll remove the dependency as soon as 9.7 is out.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-09-19 20:53:18

And the dependency on #34266 is just because that ticket is updating the documentation regarding GCC requirements, so it's merged here to avoid merge conflicts later.

Here are a few small edits. Should something about Apple's M1/M2 be added to the `gcc` SPKG.rst file, or is it good enough to have the information just for `gfortran`?

We can say, "do not attempt to use the `gcc` package on macOS".

How about just pasting in the paragraph from `gfortran`:

(but with `gcc` at the end instead of `gfortran`)

```
If you wish to do Sage development, we recommend that you additionally install the following:

sudo apt-get install  autoconf automake git gpgconf libtool openssh openssh-client pkg-config
```


Is this not misleading now? If I'm not mistaken without e.g. autoconf or automake even the bootstrap command will fail. So these tools are a hard requirement and not a recommendation, right?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2022-09-21 15:48:56

My understanding is that you only need to use the bootstrap command if you are testing new packages. If you are working solely within the Sage library, you shouldn't need it.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-09-21 16:06:55

That's right.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-09-21 16:08:42

But in the manual we actually do say that it is a hard requirement:

```
+Sage developers will also need the `system packages required for
+bootstrapping <../reference/spkg/_bootstrap>`_; they cannot be
+installed by Sage.
```

This sentence appears in the section explaining the prerequisites.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-09-21 16:12:37

We used to explain in a more fine-grained way when `_bootstrap` is needed, but it turned out to be not clear enough, which led to frustration. We simplified the explanation in #33851.

I think you missed the paragraph leading to the section with these long generated command-lines:

```
+The following sections provide the commands to install a large
+recommended set of packages on various systems, which will minimize
+the time it takes to build Sage. This is intended as a convenient
+shortcut, but of course you can choose to take a more fine-grained
+approach.
```

Assuming that the tests go well in #33816, we can remove the paragraph about m1/m2 from the `gfortran` SPKG.rst, but I think we should still include something for `gcc` since that seems to be broken (and also not needed).


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-09-21 17:37:59

For `gcc`, I think we can copy in https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/ReleaseTours/sage-9.7#SupportforsystemGCColderthan6.3dropped:

Please go ahead and push it to the ticket. We can make #33816 a dependency.

Thanks for the clarification. I was always under the impression that bootstrap was needed after a git clone, good to know that this is no longer the case.
