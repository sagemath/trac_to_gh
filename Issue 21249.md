According to the given line, it seems the missing binary is not `install`, but the `which` command itself. This command is also used (at least) in `gcc` and `autotools` pkgs. I am not sure if you should better require your container to contain the very standard tools.

Maybe it's safer (?) to use `command -v blah` instead of `which blah`? Is `command` built in to the shell?

Since Solaris is claimed to be [fully supported](https://wiki.sagemath.org/SupportedPlatforms#Fully_supported), we should try any fix there also (unfortunately i don ot see Solaris buildslaves anymore, but perhaps Jean-Pierre has one).

Well, rubiks is a bitrotting bundle of 3 packages, for which i am not sure upstream could be contacted (the links provided in SPKG.txt are dead). So, it will require the additional work of writing 3 fresh spkgs while i am not sure their code will evolve.

Why 3 spkgs? It would be enough to make 1 new "upstream" source package with an autotools build system and put it on [GitHub](GitHub). That's better than the current situation, with a fictional upstream source package that only exists on sage mirrors.

Right, thanks, I've fixed the description.

I wouldn't consider `which` a standard build tool. Its use in scripts is usually a bug.

`gcc` built just fine on my box, it does not seem to use `which`.

I've opened a ticket for `autotools` to fix the same issue (#21492).

#21492 does the same for `autotools`.

`gcc` `spkg-install` also uses `which`, but only on Darwin, where `which` exists. So no need for a patch.
