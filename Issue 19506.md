In this ticket, we propose a default implementation of ``__ne__`` methods for ``AbstractLinearCode``, ``Encoder`` and ``Decoder`` classes, which means one will only need to implement ``__eq__`` in the subclasses.

This new ``__ne__`` simply returns the inverse of the return value of ``__eq__``.

I removed the old implementation of `__ne__` in `grs.py`, created generic implementation for the top classes `Decoder`, `Encoder` and `AbstractLinearCode` and implemented `__eq__` for encoders in `linear_code.py`.

This is now open for review.

Better use `not self == other` as it is faster and more flexible. The only reason to not do so is if your equality might return `NotImplemented`.
