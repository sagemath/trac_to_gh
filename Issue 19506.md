# Issue 19506: Generic not_equals methods for objects in coding theory library

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19743

Original creator: dlucas

In this ticket, we propose a default implementation of ``__ne__`` methods for ``AbstractLinearCode``, ``Encoder`` and ``Decoder`` classes, which means one will only need to implement ``__eq__`` in the subclasses.

This new ``__ne__`` simply returns the inverse of the return value of ``__eq__``.

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to enhancement.

I removed the old implementation of `__ne__` in `grs.py`, created generic implementation for the top classes `Decoder`, `Encoder` and `AbstractLinearCode` and implemented `__eq__` for encoders in `linear_code.py`.

This is now open for review.

Better use `not self == other` as it is faster and more flexible. The only reason to not do so is if your equality might return `NotImplemented`.

I agree with [comment:4]: avoid `a.__eq__(b)` unless you have a good reason for it.
