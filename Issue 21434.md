Keywords: crystals, infinite crystals


```
sage: LS = crystals.infinity.LSPaths(['G',2])
sage: LS.highest_weight_vector().f_string([1,1,1,2])
(5/2*Lambda[1] - Lambda[2], -5/2*Lambda[1] + 5*Lambda[2], Lambda[1] + Lambda[2])
sage: LS.highest_weight_vector().f_string([1,1,1,2,2])
(5*Lambda[1] - 2*Lambda[2], -2*Lambda[1] + 4*Lambda[2], -Lambda[1] - Lambda[2])
sage: LS.highest_weight_vector().f_string([1,1,1,2,2]).e(2)
(5/2*Lambda[1] - Lambda[2], -5/2*Lambda[1] + 5*Lambda[2], -Lambda[1] - Lambda[2], 2*Lambda[1] + 2*Lambda[2])
```

The problem is the -\rho shift at the end is wrong, probably an overcorrection.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Simple fix: When we reach 0, don't keep subtracting `\rho`.
