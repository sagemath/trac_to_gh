Sage calls `singclap_resultant()`.

This works:


```
sage: R.<x,y,a,b,u>=PolynomialRing(QQ, 5)  
sage: (x^4*y^2+x^2*y-y).resultant(x*y-y*a-x*b+a*b+u,x)
y^6*a^4 - 4*y^5*a^4*b + 6*y^4*a^4*b^2 - 4*y^3*a^4*b^3 + y^2*a^4*b^4 - 4*y^5*a^3*u + 12*y^4*a^3*b*u - 12*y^3*a^3*b^2*u + 4*y^2*a^3*b^3*u + 6*y^4*a^2*u^2 - 12*y^3*a^2*b*u^2 + 6*y^2*a^2*b^2*u^2 + y^5*a^2 - 4*y^4*a^2*b + 6*y^3*a^2*b^2 - 4*y^2*a^2*b^3 + y*a^2*b^4 - 4*y^3*a*u^3 + 4*y^2*a*b*u^3 - 2*y^4*a*u + 6*y^3*a*b*u - 6*y^2*a*b^2*u + 2*y*a*b^3*u + y^2*u^4 - y^5 + 4*y^4*b - 6*y^3*b^2 + 4*y^2*b^3 - y*b^4 + y^3*u^2 - 2*y^2*b*u^2 + y*b^2*u^2
```

In Singular:


```
> ring r = integer,(x,y,a,b,u),dp;
> poly f = x^4*y^2+x^2*y-y;
> resultant(f,x*y-y*a-x*b+a*b+u,x);
   ? not implemented
```


vs.


```
> ring r = 0,(x,y,a,b,u),dp;
> poly f = x^4*y^2+x^2*y-y;
> resultant(f,x*y-y*a-x*b+a*b+u,x);
y6a4-4y5a4b+6y4a4b2-4y3a4b3+y2a4b4-4y5a3u+12y4a3bu-12y3a3b2u+4y2a3b3u+6y4a2u2-12y3a2bu2+6y2a2b2u2+y5a2-4y4a2b+6y3a2b2-4y2a2b3+ya2b4-4y3au3+4y2abu3-2y4au+6y3abu-6y2ab2u+2yab3u+y2u4-y5+4y4b-6y3b2+4y2b3-yb4+y3u2-2y2bu2+yb2u2
```


So shall we lift to QQ, compute the resultant and then convert back?

sounds reasonable.

Wow, I just ran into exactly this same segfault "in the wild" while doing some math.  

I'm glad you fixed this.

Replying to [comment:7 was]:
> One doctest fails on sage.math after applying the patch: [...]

it seems just a formatting issue, both outputs are equal (and I don't understand why the 'expected'
one was split among several lines).

Note that I also had this problem with:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,2)
sage: f = x+y
sage: g=y^2+x 
sage: f.resultant(g,y)
------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occured in Sage.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```

| Sage Version 4.4.2, Release Date: 2010-05-19                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
Maybe we can just fix the doctest?

I just tried the example above in my private Singular 3-1-1-3 + Sage 4.4 copy.Â 


```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(ZZ,2)
sage: f = x+y
sage: g=y^2+x 
sage: f.resultant(g,y)
y^2 - y
```

Thus, once#8059 is in, we can recheck and merge this patch?

yes this needs work, since the resultant in `y` should not contain `y`!!!

Comment by malb created at 2010-07-14 20:35:09

Argh, I didn't even check the output. Btw:


```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2)
sage: f = x+
sage: g=y^2+
sage: f.resultant(g,y
x^2 + x
```

Martin,

> status  changed from needs_work to positive_review

I guess you meant "needs review" instead of "positive review", since you are the author of the
patch? Otherwise you forgot to fill the author and reviewer fields :-)
