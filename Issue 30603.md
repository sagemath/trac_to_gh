I think this is good. It seems like the timings get no worse (or perhaps slightly), but sometimes significantly better.

Some technical comments:

`IncreasingChains` documentation is weird. I would move the `__init__` docstring to the class level.

Why this removal?

Thank you for the changes.

Ah, I didn't notice that it was not an extension class. Actually, that is something we should change very soon by moving and making `SearchForest` into the `recursively_enumerated_set.pyx`... At least that aspect should be trivial: to move and `cdef` the class.

Unfortunately I don't think you can do that. Although you can type cast it everywhere it could be useful.

Also, the `IncreasingChains.__init__` now needs a doctest; a good old `TestSuite(foo).run()` perhaps.
