CC:  dimpase

The method `designs.difference_family` doesn't handle `k in [0,1]` properly leading to exceptions.

```
sage: designs.difference_family(1,1,1)
...
ZeroDivisionError: Integer modulo by zero
```


Also negative parameters are not properly handled.

```
sage: designs.difference_family(3,-2,-1,existence=True)
Unknown
```


The code added fixes these issues:

```
sage: designs.difference_family(1,1,1)
(Ring of integers modulo 1, [[0]])
sage: designs.difference_family(3,-2,-1,existence=True)
False
```


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30102
