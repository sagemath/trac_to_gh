This ticket triggered for me a problem with git and finding history: I tried to find which ticket introduced the test in singular.polynomial, so I looked with `git blame`. That found some relevant commits, but none of them explicitly referred to a trac ticket and were otherwise terse, descriptive commit messages.

By googling for one of the commit messages I quickly arrived at the trac ticket which had a lot more history of the problem than the commits, but I'm not sure we want to rely on external tools to document our history.

Am I missing some trick that reliably leads to the trac ticket from a git commit? It is still often the case that trac ticket discussions contain a lot of detail (sometimes even relevant) that the commit messages don't (and probably shouldn't). I think it would be nice if we continue/resume providing links from git commits to trac tickets.

If you think of the git log as a DAG with time stamps at nodes its fairly obvious what you have to do. The git trac command provides an implementation: 

```
$ git blame src/sage/libs/singular/polynomial.pyx | grep Leaked

Replying to [comment:2 vbraun]:
> If you think of the git log as a DAG with time stamps at nodes its fairly obvious what you have to do. The git trac command provides an implementation:

Ah, OK. Thanks! The implementation in git-trac is really convenient. The extra bit of information is: The trac ticket number is included in the git commit messages when the branch of the ticket is merged.
