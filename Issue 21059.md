with an eye towards python3 compatibility

when iterating over a dict, one does not need to call .keys()

and when asking for the list of keys, it is better to call list(d) for compatibility with py3

Removing .keys() when possible is performed in some files, not everywhere.

patchbot is green (except for a timeout problem in Tutte polynomials which happens for every ticket on this patchbot)
