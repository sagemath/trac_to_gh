Was that Fourier stuff ever going to be used?  Or is it elsewhere?   I didn't really look at it. 

Considering that

```
sage: integral(1/x,x,0,0)
0
```

already, I guess we should do this.  Are there _any_ symbolic integrals on a point that Maxima doesn't give 0 for?

I'll review this more formally - especially the doc stuff, which seems good at a quick glance - if I get a chance, otherwise someone else feel free to do so!

Probably "no" to both questions.  That commented-out code has been there since 2007, the day that file was created.  It does not look very developed, so I think it's okay to remove it.

A one-off script I used to throw random functions at the numerical integration

You should add the ticket number to the new doctests, and maybe add yourself as author/copyright. Other than that, it looks good.

Positive review from me, then, although this is my first review so you may want a second opinion.

First time for everything, right?  I guess this patch is pretty safe, it makes only a small functional change to Sage.  If all doctests pass and the documentation builds and looks okay (which is the case), then this patch should be merged.

Thanks for the review!

`@`mjo:

Given the author and his current role, I'm sure this isn't an issue, but one thing to make sure to do with things that change the reference manual is to do 

```
sage -docbuild reference html
```

or the like, just to check that links look right and there isn't a misplaced colon or something.  

Looking forward to seeing many more reviews - and other contributions? - from you!  Thanks for helping.
