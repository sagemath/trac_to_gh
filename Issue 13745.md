Presently, proper initialization of a `Matrix` (inherited) object implies the creation of a `Mutability` object, which needs a memory allocation of its own. Since it's just a single flag, `Matrix` can just have this without linking to a separate class. Hopefully this speeds up Matrix creation sufficiently that `sage.matrix.matrix_integer_2x2` can afford to just call it.

First attempt: straightforward exercise. Things of note:
- I changed the name of the attribute to Matrix._immutability, because a `False` value on a `Mutability` object already means `mutable` (horrible user interface for that routine! At least the internal attributes are at least named appropriately. Added benefit: The compiler immediately complains about unchanged locations (because the old attribute simply doesn't exist anymore). Possible better name: `_is_immutable`.
- It almost seemed pickling would be a problem. However, in `matrix0`, it turns out that pickling isn't implemented anyway, so there are no old pickles to be concerned about.
- note that `Matrix` instances also have a `_cache` attribute; a dictionary. This is also expensive to initialize. Would it be a good idea to also allow `None` as a sentinel value there and that any routine that needs `_cache` replaces `None` there by an empty dictionary? Or is that an unacceptable cost for cache use?

In fact, that's already in place in the cache access routines! It's just the __init__ method that insists on setting `self._cache = {}`. It simply shouldn't do that! That will be much more efficient.

Unfortunately, following `integer_dense.__cinit__` example to put a call to `__init__` in the cinit method of `2x2` doubles the reported time taken by

```
from sage.matrix.matrix_integer_2x2 import Matrix_integer_2x2 as mi2x2
M2Z = MatrixSpace(ZZ,2)
null = mi2x2(M2Z,None,false,false)
timeit("null+null")
```
so that's not really reasonable. However, after reading cython's documentation, I don't think `__cinit__` should ever call `__init__`. Those are separate initialization phases. So I think that
`sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx:187`:

```
    def __cinit__(self, parent, entries, coerce, copy):
...
        matrix_dense.Matrix_dense.__init__(self, parent)
...
```
is a bug, or at least a breach of protocol. Getting to a "cinited" state should note require `__init__` on a previous one. The `__init__` methods get called separately, after `cinit` is done.

(incidentally, `Matrix_dense` doesn't have an `__init__`, so this is just `Matrix.__init__` being called)

I guess the trick here is that some code can get away with avoiding `__init__`. Then some code couldn't quite, so this line was added in as a hack. Changeset responsible:

```

date:        Mon Dec 18 16:06:31 2006 -0800
summary:     Fast copy of matrices over ZZ.
```
so this is *old*. Cython has evolved since, so perhaps the organization here needs reconsidering. If it's absolutely necessary to create usable matrices via `__new__`, shouldn't we just put the required initializations in `__cinit__`? Those are guaranteed to be called, but it's generally recommended to put off as much as possible to `__init__`.

It seems to me that `2x2` is really just following in the footsteps of the rest of the matrix classes in only loosely following protocol for initialization. It should just do whatever is fastest. Incidentally, making the change as proposed on this ticket solves the initialization problem of the mutability, since such attributes are set to 0 anyway.

Just some notes here. In order to make usable matrices from just `Matrix.__new__()`, i.e., without running `__init__` we'd need to move some things into `Matrix.__cinit__`. The main things there are:

```
        self._immutability = False
        self._cache = None
        self._parent = parent
        self._base_ring = parent.base_ring()
        self._nrows = parent.nrows()
        self._ncols = parent.ncols()
```
The first 3 instructions are fast and could be moved into `matrix.__cinit__` (which doesn't exist at the moment), except that some matrix routines call `__new__` with `parent=NULL`. They set the parent themselves manually afterwards. We could fix that. However, if they have to muck about with `_base_ring` and `_nrows,_ncols` anyway, there's not much to win.

The last 3 instructions are slow, of course, because they require full-blown method resolutions. Many matrix subclasses can be more efficient about those, so it's probably good to leave those in the avoidable `__init__` rather than the unavoidable `__cinit__`.

Note that the first two instructions are not necessary: Those are the values to which those attributes get initialized by cython already.

The following might be reasonable:
- Change `mutability` to a `bint` flag, as proposed to this ticket. It means that a mutable matrix doesn't need to touch that flag at all upon initialization!
- matrix classes can avoid the base class `matrix.__init__` as long as they set `_parent`, `_base_ring`, `_nrows`, `_ncols` themselves.

This is largely how currently things work, except for `Matrix_integer_dense`, where the `__cinit__` calls
`Matrix_dense.__init__` already. Hence, if you inherit from `Matrix_integer_dense`, you cannot get super efficient `__new__` anymore.

This is of course silly, because already setting `self._base_ring` is something this class could do very efficiently. So, probably this call to `Matrix_dense` should be removed, setting `self._base_ring` can be done in `Matrix_integer_dense.__cinit__` directly (because it's just `ZZ`), and setting `nrows` and `ncols` should probably be done explicitly (in most cases you KNOW how big the matrix is)
