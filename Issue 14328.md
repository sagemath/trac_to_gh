Hello!

Sry for comming back at you so late. I had some other stuff lately!

Anways, the code looks fine (read it, run it, and obviously run sage -t) I only have two remarks.

1. Maybe we should check if d is even and also nonzero (perhaps >= 2) since that is also a invalid parameter.

2. I would change the line  

```
 Graph([map(tuple,PV), lambda x,y:V(x)*(M*V(y)) == 0], loops = False) 
}}} to

{{{
{{{
 Graph((map(tuple,PV), lambda x,y:V(x)*(M*V(y)) == 0), loops = False) 
}}} 
}}}

which should be 2x faster.

Best,

Jernej

Helloooooooooooooo !!

Come on, I am already very thankful that you take the time to review these patches !!!

> 1. Maybe we should check if d is even and also nonzero (perhaps >= 2) since that is also a invalid parameter.

Done

> 2. I would change the line

`O_o`

Here is what I get when I change it : 

```
sage: graphs.SymplecticGraph(4,4)         
...
NetworkXError: Input is not a known data type for conversion.
```


But what do you think it should do, and why do you think that it should be 2x faster ? `O_o`

I may be shooting random nonsense of course but in general it is much better to not create lists [] but iterators (). Since in the former case a list has to first be created (1 for loop) and then iterated over (2 for loop). Example


```
sage: %timeit max((i for i in xrange(100)))
100000 loops, best of 3: 14.5 us per loop
sage: %timeit max([i for i in xrange(100)])
10000 loops, best of 3: 30 us per loop
```


and even faster in this case would be


```
sage: %timeit 99
1000000 loops, best of 3: 429 ns per loo
```

Helloooooooo !

> maybe Sage should have "polar space" graphs in general, not, only symplectic ones?

Well, yes it would be nice indeed, but I do not know how to build them. I guess that it only takes 5~6 lines, like for the symplectic ones, but I don't know which ones. Actually, I have no idea on earth what these graphs are, except what I could read (and understand, which is even less) from Brouwer's website.

http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/srg/srgtab.html

I believe I created what he calls a `VO^-` graph (`graphs.BrouwerHaemersGraph`), and the same code worked for different parameters but I was not able to make it work in characteristic two, and so I did not write this more general patch.

If you know how to make it work, I would be glad to see it in Sage too `:-P`

I mean classical polar spaces as introduced by J.Tits (or even long before him). See e.g. Sect 6.5 of http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/pps/pps6.pdf\n\nTo construct these, you need to be able to create the corresponding forms, which are well-studied by group theory, as they lead to finite classical groups. GAP has code to create these forms; it's not completely trivial in characteristic two.

Actually, I have no idea on earth what these graphs are, except what I could read (and understand, which is even less) from Brouwer's website.

no, these are different species. I mean classical polar spaces as introduced by J.Tits (or even long before him). See e.g. Sect 6.5 of http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/pps/pps6.pdf

To construct these, you need to be able to create the corresponding forms, which are well-studied by group theory, as they lead to finite classical groups. GAP has code to create these forms; it's not completely trivial in characteristic two. You can actually just call GAP!
E.g.

```
gap> Display(InvariantQuadraticForm(GO(1,6,2)).matrix);
 . 1 . . . .
 . . . . . .
 . . . 1 . .
 . . . . . .
 . . . . . 1
 . . . . . .
gap> Display(InvariantQuadraticForm(GO(-1,6,2)).matrix);
 . 1 . . . .
 . . . . . .
 . . 1 1 . .
 . . . 1 . .
 . . . . . 1
 . . . . . .
gap> Display(InvariantSesquilinearForm(GU(6,2)).matrix);
 . . . . . 1
 . . . . 1 .
 . . . 1 . .
 . . 1 . . .
 . 1 . . . .
 1 . . . . .
gap> Display(InvariantBilinearForm(Sp(6,3)).matrix);
 . . . . . 1
 . . . . 1 .
 . . . 1 . .
 . . 2 . . .
 . 2 . . . .
 2 . . . . .
gap> 
```

etc...

* store the graphs more compactly
* compute their properties faster

Isn't it obvious? All these graphs you construct lately have huge automorphism groups, often arc-transitive and/or distance-transitive.

Obviously, regularity properties - and this is very fast with such data. Then, e.g., 
e.g. maximum cliques, or an optimal colouring. It's downright hopeless to do without taking symmetries into account.
Or Lovasz theta number...
