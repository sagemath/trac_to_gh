# Issue 32582: Determinant for multi-component links

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32819

Original creator: @LLewark

Keywords: knots, links

Currently, the determinant is implemented only for knots.

However, the determinant for multi-component links is defined in the same way as for knots.

So I propose to allow multi-component links in the determinant function.

Moreover, it seems simpler to take determinant of the symmetrized Seifert matrix, instead of the evaluation of the Alexander polynomial at -1.

Looks good, but could you please add a reference for this general definition ? a book if possible, or an article.

See Peter Cromwell: "Knots and links" (https://zbmath.org/?q=an%3A1066.57007), Definition 6.6.3 on p. 144:
  The determinant of a link L, written det(L), is the absolute value of the determinant of M + M<sup>T</sup>
  where M is any Seifert matrix for L.

Ok, so please add that information in the documentation of the method.
