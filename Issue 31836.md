Unused, should remove.

I think it is already defunct because in normal Sage terminal interaction, readline is not used, so whatever this interface is offering (`with interleaved_output()`) can't work any more. 

How about we just remove it immediately, without deprecation?

It's broken, no need for deprecation.

This won't break again #14289, correct? I don't have an OSX machine to verify this.
