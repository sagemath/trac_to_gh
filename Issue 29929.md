# Issue 29929: Cartesian products of metric spaces

Currently, taking cartesian products forgets about the category of metric spaces. Example:

```
sage: UHP = HyperbolicPlane().UHP()
sage: UHP
Hyperbolic plane in the Upper Half Plane Model
sage: UHP.categories()
[Category of hyperbolic models of Hyperbolic plane,
 Category of realizations of Hyperbolic plane,
 Category of realizations of sets,
 Category of metric spaces,
 Category of topological spaces,
 Category of sets,
 Category of sets with partial maps,
 Category of objects]

sage: UHP2 = UHP.cartesian_product(UHP)
sage: UHP2.categories()
[Category of Cartesian products of sets,
 Category of sets,
 Category of sets with partial maps,
 Category of objects]
```

Patchbot reports some trivial failures:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/categories/sets_cat.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/categories/magmas.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/categories/metric_spaces.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

If you could break the long lines in `sets_cat.py` like before, then you can set a positive review on my behalf.
