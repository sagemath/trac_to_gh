<div id="comment:0"></div>

the gap version 4.4.10 is hardwired there, and few other things are wrong, e.g no SPKG.txt

A new version, with these fixes installs and runs on Sage >=4.3.3, can be found here:
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/ace-5.0.p1.spkg

license status unclear, waiting for a reply from upstream

I think the link is wrong. http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/
has no such spkg file.

Where is the distribution license? It is not clear that we are
legally allowed to distribute this code. I did not see any C code written by
Havas. Maybe he only contributed design ideas? Did you ask Ramsay 
if he licensed his C code under the GPL (or any code that allows for 
free distribution) ... ?

```
The problem (well, among others) is that it's using 

```
GAP0=`$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/newest_version gap`
```
Also, it's first copied to the location and then configured there rather than built in `spkg/build` and then moved.  I don't know if that matters.

I think that until this is fixed, especially if this can just be installed as a GAP package, it would be okay to move ace to "experimental".
