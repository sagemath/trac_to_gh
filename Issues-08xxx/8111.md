```
The following was solved along the way. We add a doctest.

The GCD of rationals is still unclear (see trac 3214), and leads to definite problems with reduce(). 

```
K.<k>= QQ[];
print(gcd(64,256))
print(gcd(K(64),K(256)))
print(gcd(64*k^2+128,64*k^3+256))
frac = (64*k^2+128)/(64*k^3+256)
frac.reduce()
print(frac)
```
gives

```
64
1
1
(64*k^2 + 128)/(64*k^3 + 256)
```
The last line in particular is false, according to me.

I think the trouble here is our generic fraction field code, not how we define the gcd of rational numbers.

For efficiency, we should represent QQ(x) as Frac(ZZ[x]), and do the necessary normalisation of the denominator (it should be monic) when the user accesses it with `.denominator()`.

It may be related, but my patch from #10771 does not touch the gcd for `QQ['x']` (perhaps it should?). So far, the two tickets are about different issues.
