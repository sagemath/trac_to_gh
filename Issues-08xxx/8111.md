The following was solved along the way. We add a doctest.

The GCD of rationals is still unclear (see trac 3214), and leads to definite problems with reduce(). 

```
K.<k>= QQ[];
print(gcd(64,256))
print(gcd(K(64),K(256)))
print(gcd(64*k^2+128,64*k^3+256))
frac = (64*k^2+128)/(64*k^3+256)
frac.reduce()
print(frac)
```
gives

```
64
1
1
(64*k^2 + 128)/(64*k^3 + 256)
```
The last line in particular is false, according to me.

I think the trouble here is our generic fraction field code, not how we define the gcd of rational numbers.

For efficiency, we should represent QQ(x) as Frac(ZZ[x]), and do the necessary normalisation of the denominator (it should be monic) when the user accesses it with `.denominator()`.

It may be related, but my patch from #10771 does not touch the gcd for `QQ['x']` (perhaps it should?). So far, the two tickets are about different issues.

PS: It seems to me that for changing gcd for univariate polynomials over the rationals, one has to dive into flint. I'll not do that, it'd be too far off topic for me. BTW, the doc string explicitly states that gcd in `QQ['x']` returns the *monic* gcd.
