First of all I have the same problem on Gentoo. Ther is also a report of someone having the same problem on Mandriva.

I manage to get it work by the following workaround:
I replaced

```
$MAKE
``` 
by

```
LIBICONV="$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libiconv.so $MAKE
```
in spkg-install. I've no idea how robust this workaround is. I posted a spkg with the fix.

I've got no idea if setting LIBICOV shoudl be set, but if it is, the way to do it should be:

```
LIBICONV="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libiconv.so"
```

and not

```
LIBICONV="$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libiconv.so
```

Jaap, 

is that a typo in the trac ticket, or was it in the package? There should be a $ sign in front if SAGE_LOCAL.

If this gets too much of a mess, we could consider creating a ticket to get the R package reverted to the older version. I've cc'ed Karl-Dieter Crisman who updated R, whilst ignoring the warning from the configure script and not testing on Solaris. 

Hopefully iconv can be sorted out, but if it can't be done properly, then reverting the R version is always an option, then iconv will not be needed. We could change iconv's spkg-install to simply exit with an exit code of 0. That would make it relatively easy to do, whilst leaving iconv in Sage to allow it to be sorted out properly prior to updating R.

I had a discussion with a libtool developer about a similar issue once before. He said it is wrong to have two copies of a library, so the problem may be more fundamental. However, it is strange gd ignores the option to look for iconv in $SAGE_LOCAL. 

One disadvantage of reverting R and not installing iconv is that iconv is needed to build gd on Cygwin, and there is effort into porting Sage to Cygwin. 

We could consider only installing iconv on Solaris and Cygwin, though I'm tempted to suggest reverting R and getting the problem solved properly at a later date, rather than a hack now.

About iconv(): according to the man pages the function is part of glibc

```
VERSIONS
       This function is available in glibc since version 2.1.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

SEE ALSO
       iconv_close(3), iconv_open(3)


```

So for most systems there is no need to have a local libiconv!
Let's say only Solaris and Cygwin.

Yes, I definitely prefer this way, too.

Jaap, 

I don't have time to test it now (really am tied up), but if you can test on OpenSolaris, then make a decision whether iconv needs installing or not. 

```
drkirkby@kestrel:~$ uname -r
5.10
```

on Solaris 10, and 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ uname -r
5.11
```

on OpenSolaris (aka Solaris 11). So just put an additional clause if needed. 

The -r option to uname is POSIX, so we can rely on that. Don't use 'uname -p' since

* The i386 processor is used on Solaris 10 too. 
* -p is not a POSIX option to uname, so can cause hassles on other systems. 

Also worth checking, in preference to this are whether the version of 'gd' in Sage is old and furthermore the 'gd' developers have fixed the bug that prevents '--with-libiconv-prefix' working properly. If so, consider updating gd. 

Had R been properly tested, none of this would have been necessary. 

When I wrote the iconv package, it clears out debris, like libraries and binaries, so there should be no need to do that again - just make sure the cleaning up is done before exiting. 

Since Jaap and I are looking to port Sage to OpenSolaris, we are not keen to introduce more problems for the future. Let's sort it out now.

Let's go for the proposed option and leave alone the gd package for the moment.

You are repeating your self :-)!

My proposal is you update the iconv spkg and I and evt. others review it.

I think we can wait some more hours.

Informally (that is, I threw together a quick spkg), this works on at least one of the linux boxes I had troubles with before, and it also works on sage.math.  I haven't tested it on Solaris, and I probably won't have time to; I don't have access to a Windows/Cygwin machine.  I would suggest that the spkg-install file actually say 

```
if [ "x$UNAME" != xSunOS ] && [ "x$UNAME" != xCYGWIN ] ; then
  echo "Not installing iconv -- on systems other than Solaris and Cygwin, use the system's iconv"
  exit 0
fi
```
Or something like that -- I'm not sure exactly what the message should say.

The ";" should be before "then"..
.

```
if [ "x$UNAME" != xSunOS ] && [ "x$UNAME" != xCYGWIN ] ; then
  echo "Not installing iconv -- on systems other than Solaris and Cygwin, use the system's iconv"

I'm trying this on gentoo and it seems to work... I'm waiting for the build to finish.
