On Linux, fortran-20100118.spkg's spkg-install ignores SAGE_FORTRAN and instead overrides it with the first "gfortran" it finds in $PATH.  In my environment this fortran compiler is (more or less) broken, so I have to it explicitly and I then want it to be used.  The simple attached fix executes the relevant code path only if SAGE_FORTRAN is not set yet.
