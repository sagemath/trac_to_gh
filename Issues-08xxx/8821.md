So far, the word "coercion" has only been used twice in the tutorial - without explanation or reference. I believe coercion is far too important to not cover it in the tutorial, and moreover some pitfalls may be confusing for mathematicians, while programmers might confuse it with implicit type conversion.

My patch adds such section.

```
sage: isinstance(matrix(ZZ, 2), RingElement)
True

is False. (I consider the first a bug.)

Second, we don't want to create the expectation that Python elements are unique, as they usually aren't: 

```
sage: a = -15r

sage: a is b
False
```

Only some really common integers are.

OK, I wanted to give a first approximation on how classes relate with mathematics. Perhaps I should emphasize that the analogy is not perfect (I already mention that different classes may also relate with different implementations of the same mathematical structure).

> ` sage: isinstance(matrix(ZZ, 2), RingElement) True sage: isinstance(matrix(ZZ, 2,3), RingElement) True ` is False. (I consider the first a bug.)


Really? The first is a square matrix, so, I think the second is wrong.

> Second, we don't want to create the expectation that Python elements are unique, as they usually aren't:


Right, that should be clarified.

Thank you!

Yes, that's what I suggested in the `sage-devel` thread. ;-)
(And Robert noted that this is implementation-specific even in plain Python.)
One should clarify that in general
  `a is b` => `a == b`
but not necessarily the opposite.

Regarding comparison:
It should be stressed that not only `a == b` returns `False` if coercion fails but also `a != b` (silently) returns `False` in that case.

Reading on...

Btw (ticket description), I'd still say Sage's coercion *is* (a kind of) implicit type conversion...

It seems we've reached ultimate confusion in the `sage-devel` thread ("exact" and "inexact" domains); I unfortunately haven't been able to reply so far...

Ok, one might clarify that an implicit conversion (coercion) in Sage can be performed even if the objects' types appear to be the same; but this is not really different to other object-oriented languages (cf. virtual functions).

No, it doesn't:

```
sage: GF(5)(1) == GF(2)(1)
False
sage: GF(5)(1) != GF(2)(1)
True
sage: R.<x,a,b> = QQ[]
sage: S.<x,c,d> = QQ[]
sage: x == R('x')
False
sage: x != R('x')
True
```

Then document the opposite (of what **I** stated) ;-)

(I thought this was said in some Sage documentation, but it seems I took this assumption from Robert's statement:

  "In Python, the convention is that == and != never raise an error, so  
  False is returned if coercion fails (the two domains are incompatible)."

---

I've actually given up thinking about Sage's "coercion model", because IMHO still different people seem to have different ideas of what it is and how it does or should work (including different interpretations of terms).

If you want to have fun, compare this description to that in [William's and Burcin's recent paper](http://wstein.org/papers/icms/icms_2010.pdf) (page 12)... ;-)

(Reading that, one would think *every* coercion in Sage is a type 
**promotion**. "only from exact to inexact" suggests the opposite, type **demotion**, and does, e.g., not include `QQ.has_coerce_map_from(ZZ)`, where I'd consider `ZZ` the [more] "inexact" domain.)

---

I'd write that Sage implements its own *type system*, which must not be confused with **Python's** (as opposed to "... type conversion and type coercion known from, e.g., the C programming language").

The explanation that there can only be a finite number of classes in Python is somewhat wrong; in fact, classes can be created dynamically (regarding finite memory, there can only be finitely many instances of a class, too).

Because of the presence of some transcendental numbers with no exact representation, RR is inherently inexact: when you work in RR, you're only working up to some level of precision.\n\nReading p. 12 of the Stein-Erocal paper, I would think that every coercion comes from an embedding, but this is not true.  Every coercion should come from a mathematically canonical map (like mapping Z to any ring, or the inclusion of Q into R).  Thinking about it mathematically makes sense to me, and I think this is the whole point.\n\nAlso, remember that a document like the Sage tutorial is aimed to a large degree at mathematicians and math students (and other \"consumers\" of mathematics), moreso than to people with a computer science focus.  So focusing on types, etc., is not appropriate.",

ZZ and QQ are equally exact: any element of them can be represented exactly on a computer.  Because of the presence of some transcendental numbers with no exact representation, RR is inherently inexact: when you work in RR, you're only working up to some level of precision.

Reading p. 12 of the Stein-Erocal paper, I would think that every coercion comes from an embedding, but this is not true.  Every coercion should come from a mathematically canonical map (like mapping Z to any ring, or the inclusion of Q into R).  Thinking about it mathematically makes sense to me, and I think this is the whole point.

Also, remember that a document like the Sage tutorial is aimed to a large degree at mathematicians and math students (and other "consumers" of mathematics), moreso than to people with a computer science focus.  So focusing on types, etc., is not appropriate.

Well, irrational numbers and limited precision are different aspects; in principle, "the" real field should contain QQ. And at least some irrational numbers (I personally don't consider them numbers ;-) , or at least not "real" in the sense of existence) *can* be represented - in general as (symbolic) constants or as limits.

If it's clear to everyone what is meant by "exact" and "inexact"...

Mapping Q into R is not the same as mapping `QQ` into `RR`; in fact, Sage supports the direction that is sound in the mathematical domains, i.e. that is valid for Q and R, though the implementation (the actual domains considered mathematically; floating-point numbers in the case of `RR`) would suggest the opposite, because every element of `RR` (except some symbolic constants) can be represented in `QQ`.

I'm not sure what that refers to; nevertheless the reader will (or should) be familiar with Python, including the concept of its types and classes, and will be confronted with the differences between Python types (including classes) and Sage's types, namely "parents".

Coercions in Sage are supposed to model the underlying mathematics.  So a coercion from QQ to RR is defined, as it should be.

That's why I used the qualifier "some" in "the presence of some transcendental numbers".  And of course every real number can be represented as a limit of rationals...

> IMHO coercions (as opposed to conversions) should be injective.


No.  The natural map from ZZ to ZZ/nZZ should be a coercion, as indeed should be the natural map from ZZ to any ring.  The same for the standard map from an object (ring, group, module, ...) to any of its quotients.  These are typically not injective, but they are also completely canonical.  Any canonical map should be a coercion.

I'm willing to believe this, but can you provide evidence?

It refers to, for example, your statement "I'd write that Sage implements its own type system ...".  I think this sort of statement puts more of a programming-type focus than a mathematical one.
