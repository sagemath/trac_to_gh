Florent Hivert has recently devised a nice way to use Sphinx to test that nested classes in Sage are picklable.  Please see [attachment:ticket:7448:trac_7448-nested_class_sphinx-fh.4.patch V4] at #7448.  From #7448's description:

   "I also took the chance to raise a warning if someone forgot to set the metaclass leading to a unpicklable class. Several bug have been found that way. I'll add a ticket for this."

This ticket is about implementing Hivert's idea.

For the record, here a the tickets about bugs caught this way:
#8388, #8475. More have been caught on sage-combinat patch queue, before entering sage.

Hi Mitesh,

As far as I understand, the goal of this ticket is twofold:
- make the check optional;
- put it in a sage plugin of sphinx to avoig patching Sphinx for that. 
So you still relies on sphinx to do this check. As I previously said, a priori, checking for nested class has nothing to do with Sphinx. 

Though I definitely don't know where to do it, if possible, it would even be better to do it in sage eg. during the import of the class... Any idea on this way ? Maybe it's not possible without patching `type` which is exactly what `NestedClassMetaclass` does, at least conceptually.  

By the way, am I allowed to review this patch (there is some code from me in it) ?

The patch really just takes advantage of Sphinx's iteration over the contents of the [documented] modules.  Sphinx has a [doctest extension](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/doctest.html), which blurs the "line" between building the documentation and checking the code.  If the patch actually works, we could take it as an immediately available but temporary solution while we consider other possibilities.   But I don't mind at all if we adopt a different approach. 

We could create a new script `SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-analyze` with options to run various checks on library source code.  Users would call the script directly or via `sage -analyze --option file ...`.

Instead of starting completely from scratch, we could adapt or extend an existing tool: [PyChecker](http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/), [PyFlakes](http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodPyflakes), [Pylint](http://www.logilab.org/project/pylint).

I think we could each review the other's contributions and maybe get an assist from a third reviewer.

I just noticed that I didn't put your name in the Author(s) field.  I apologize for that.

I'm happy to report that the temporary solution is fully working. Running a docbuild 
I got

I think this is a very good idea. Nicolas advised me to use PyFlakes. It work for what I need but I've no idea how to extend it.

No problem. My work is already acknowledged as the author of #7448. Symmetrically, You've done more than a review work on this ticket and didn't add yourself as author... So please do as you consider fair. I don't feel offended either way.
