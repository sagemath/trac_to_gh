Florent Hivert has recently devised a nice way to use Sphinx to test that nested classes in Sage are picklable.  Please see [V4](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8452/d7772a9f1ba7d8e964ddde45a79065d2.gz) at #7448.  From #7448's description:

   "I also took the chance to raise a warning if someone forgot to set the metaclass leading to a unpicklable class. Several bug have been found that way. I'll add a ticket for this."

This ticket is about implementing Hivert's idea.

For the record, here a the tickets about bugs caught this way:
#8388, #8475. More have been caught on sage-combinat patch queue, before entering sage.

Hi Mitesh,

As far as I understand, the goal of this ticket is twofold:
- make the check optional;
- put it in a sage plugin of sphinx to avoig patching Sphinx for that. 
So you still relies on sphinx to do this check. As I previously said, a priori, checking for nested class has nothing to do with Sphinx. 

Though I definitely don't know where to do it, if possible, it would even be better to do it in sage eg. during the import of the class... Any idea on this way ? Maybe it's not possible without patching `type` which is exactly what `NestedClassMetaclass` does, at least conceptually.  

By the way, am I allowed to review this patch (there is some code from me in it) ?

I'm happy to report that the temporary solution is fully working. Running a docbuild 
I got

No problem. My work is already acknowledged as the author of #7448. Symmetrically, You've done more than a review work on this ticket and didn't add yourself as author... So please do as you consider fair. I don't feel offended either way.
