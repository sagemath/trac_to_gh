```
sage: mat = matrix(ZZ, 0, 1, sparse=True)
sage: mat.nrows()
0
sage: mat.rows()
[(0)]
sage: mat = matrix(ZZ, 0, 1, sparse=False)
sage: mat.nrows()
0
sage: mat.rows()
[]
```
The `rows` method should act the same regardless of the sparsity of the matrix, and when there are no rows, it should return an empty list.

The same thing happens with matrices defined over QQ or GF(2), so I'm guessing that the problem is with `sparse_rows` and `sparse_columns` in sage/matrix/matrix1.pyx.

Hi John,

I think this is an exact duplicate of #10714, which has a fix and has been merged. (I'd missed this ticket when I "rediscovered" this problem).  On 4.6.2.rc0 I now get:

```
sage: mat = matrix(ZZ, 0, 1, sparse=True)
sage: mat.nrows()
0
sage: mat.rows()
[]
```

I think we can close this as a duplicate?

Rob

Yes, it works for me now.
