The following should raise an error since f0 has a singularity at P  (and isn't necessarily 0 at all finite Weierstrass points):

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ['x']
sage: H= HyperellipticCurve(x^3-10*x+9)
sage: K = Qp(5,10)
sage: HK = H.change_ring(K)
sage: P = HK(1,0)
sage: import sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.monsky_washnitzer as mw
sage: Mfrob,forms=mw.matrix_of_frobenius_hyperelliptic(HK)
sage: f0 = forms[0]
sage: f0(P[0],P[1])
0
sage: f0(x,K(0))
0

```
In fact, Sage seems to knows this...just not when the y-coordinate is 0 in the p-adic field. So, a coercion error?

```
sage: f0(x,0)

I just tried the test cases and (modulo the fact that monsky_washnitzer moved to hyperelliptic_curves) they no longer return the claimed errors. Probably this is due to some bug in p-adic power series getting fixed (perhaps #9457).

In light of that, I propose to resolve this ticket as "fixed".
