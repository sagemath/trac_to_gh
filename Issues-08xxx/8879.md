I don't know if it matters that much, but at the very least it's annoying.  It's not elliptic curves, of course, but that's the closest component I could find.

Also, the tests at lines 465 ff. take 12-15 seconds EACH on a pretty new computer.  Shouldn't these be marked # long time?  In general quite a few of the doctests take very long, and there are so many that it seems reasonable that some don't have to be run in a normal make check.

There is a further tab character in line 752:

```
            sage: T = HK(0,1,0)	
```
and line 757

```
            sage: HK.coleman_integral(w*x^3,T,S)

* All tabs were fixed in #8680.
  * The coleman_integral stuff was marked long time in #10712.
  * The bad indentation was fixed somewhere along the line.

I've cleaned up some trailing whitespace, so that there isn't nothing to do here.

Not much to review either.  You could have just positively reviewed this as a duplicate too, you know!  But I suppose someone has to remove trailing whitespace!
