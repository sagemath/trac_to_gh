  * The bad indentation was fixed somewhere along the line.

I've cleaned up some trailing whitespace, so that there isn't nothing to do here.

Not much to review either.  You could have just positively reviewed this as a duplicate too, you know!  But I suppose someone has to remove trailing whitespace!
