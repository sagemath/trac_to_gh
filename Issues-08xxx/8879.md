I don't know if it matters that much, but at the very least it's annoying.  It's not elliptic curves, of course, but that's the closest component I could find.

Also, the tests at lines 465 ff. take 12-15 seconds EACH on a pretty new computer.  Shouldn't these be marked # long time?  In general quite a few of the doctests take very long, and there are so many that it seems reasonable that some don't have to be run in a normal make check.

There is a further tab character in line 752:

```
            sage: T = HK(0,1,0)	
```
and line 757

```
            sage: HK.coleman_integral(w*x^3,T,S)	
```

I've cleaned up some trailing whitespace, so that there isn't nothing to do here.

Not much to review either.  You could have just positively reviewed this as a duplicate too, you know!  But I suppose someone has to remove trailing whitespace!
