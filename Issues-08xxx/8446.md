In the case of a trivial number field, such as

```
K.<a> = NumberField(polygen(QQ))
```
the Selmer group function doesn't work, since the generator `a` of the number field is 0, and when we're constructing polynomials we use the form `coeff*a**i`. However, if `i==0`, we get an `ArithmeticError` since Sage does not have conventions for `0^0`.

I found several places where this comes up, and I've fixed them where I can.
