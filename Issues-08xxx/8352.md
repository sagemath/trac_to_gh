**Note to release manager**

I've given #7552, (which is an update of the version of twisted) positive review. That ticket now incorporates these changes, so this ticket does not need incorporating now. I've added Jaap as an author on #7552. 

I've stuck this to 'needs info' as really it no longer needs reviewing. I believe it should be closed, but I'm not allowed to do that, so 'needs info' seemed the least confusing.
