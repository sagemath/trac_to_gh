I don't know the best way to handle this. I could give this positive review now (there is nothing wrong with it), but I'm not sure of the most logical way to do about this.

It can't be closed yet (and in any case you should not close it, but leave a message for the release manager to do so) until #7552 is merged. 

But looking at #7552, there does seem little reason that can't be reviewed quite easily. It would appear there were some minor issues with exactly how the changes were checked in via Mercurial, but otherwise it would appear that the ticket should be quite easy to review. I need to do something else just now, but I'll take a look at that later today. 

I think this will be resolved today.

**Note to release manager**

I've given #7552, (which is an update of the version of twisted) positive review. That ticket now incorporates these changes, so this ticket does not need incorporating now. I've added Jaap as an author on #7552. 

I've stuck this to 'needs info' as really it no longer needs reviewing. I believe it should be closed, but I'm not allowed to do that, so 'needs info' seemed the least confusing.
