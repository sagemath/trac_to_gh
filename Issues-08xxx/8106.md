There should be a warning added to this description. Such as:

Please be aware that a failure in execution of an individual test suite could terminate your build process. Use with caution. In case of your build terminated try building SAGE without running the tests.

```
   If you want to run the test suite for each individual spkg as it is
   installed, type

       export SAGE_CHECK="yes"

   before starting the Sage build. This will run each test suite and
   will raise an error if any failures occur. 
```
