I created and tested, together with the 
updated GAP to 4.4.12 --- see tickets #8150 and #8076 ---
gap_packages-4.4.12_2.spkg, that is available at 
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/gap_packages-4.4.12_2.spkg
along with  http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/database_gap-4.4.12.spkg and
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/gap-4.4.12.p2.spkg

please test these (already tested OK on x86, x86_64, ia64, and OSX PPC 10.5)
together, not forgetting to apply the patch 
track-8150 available at #8150, 
but ignoring the other (obsolete) patches there and at #8076.

CAVEAT: make sure that the file gap-4.4.12.p2.spkg (or any file called like this :)) is physically present in spkg/standard/
before upgrading gap_packages.
(And certainly, install gap-4.4.12.p2.spkg before gap_packages)

This ticket is issued in addition to #8150 and #8076

The spkg `gap_packages-4.4.12` belongs to the optional packages repository, so this ticket belongs to the component "optional packages".

**Prerequisites:** #8076, #8150

Keywords: **GAP, GAP packages**

Component: **packages: optional**

Author: **Dmitrii Pasechnik**

Reviewer: **David Joyner**

Merged: **sage-4.3.3.alpha1**

There is only one patch to apply, namely the one named trac-8150.
The other patches, named 13*..., are obsolete - I mention this somewhere
(unfortunately I can't just delete these files from trac)

Thank you. Yes, you explained it and I misread what you wrote.

I installed the patch and then gap-4.4.12 on sage-4.3.2.rc0, mac 10.6.2. This went fine.

Installing the GAP packages was a different matter:

(cd '/Users/wdj/sagefiles/sage-4.3.2.rc0/spkg/build/gap_packages-4.4.12_2' && '/Users/wdj/sagefiles/sage-4.3.2.rc0/sage' -sh)

Do you see what the problem is?

I think you should do 
sage -f foo.spkg, 
and not 
sage -i foo.spkg

it could  be that you installed gap-4.4.12.p2.spkg  using -i, and not -f,
and this led to this problem --- the package gap did not change the version...

before this, you should also do
sage -f gap-4.4.12.p2.spkg    

the problem is that the version of gap package did not change, an this must be done during the installation of gap, not
during the installation of gap_packages

I am unable reproduce this. 
Could you please  install a fresh sage-4.3.2  from source and then 
do the above?
This worked on 5 different machines (well, not on OSX 10.6 Intel, but, in particular, on OSX 10.5 PPC).

omg...

rename all files gap*4.4.10*.spkg in spkg/standard to something that is not recognised as spkg
(I normally just erase them, so perhaps this might be the root of the problem for you)

then redo all the package installs:
sage -f gap*...

it can also be that you have  scripts in, say, /usr/local/bin pointing out to wrong installation of sage

Failing all this, you can rebuild the whole sage from scratch with right spkgs corresponding to 4.4.12.

This is not the correct way to build a package!

I have tried your instructions on two different macs (both running 4.3.2 and 10.6.2) and a linux machine (running ubuntu 9.10).
Same error on all machines. There is something wrong with

(1) make clone
(2) apply trac-8150
(3) sage -f gap-4.4.12
(4) sage -f gap_packages.

The last step is where the error occurs on every machine.

As far as I know, this is the way it is *supposed* to work. 

To be as clear as I can, you are *not* supposed to ask people to delete gap-4.4.10 manually at any stage of the install. Maybe if this is not clear, it should be moved to sage-support or sage-devel?

I am marking this as needs work.

Sorry, but I asked you to do it on a *clean install*, not on a clone...

OK, I can reproduce your problem. Namely, I see this behaviour if I try to upgrade
a binary distribution of 4.3.2 (just tried it on boxen, and saw exactly the same thing as you did). But, I swear, it does work on a distribution built from source,
even if I compile gap 4.4.10 and its packages in, and then do the regular upgrade
with -f, without removing old spkgs, it all goes smoothly.

But this is not a problem of our new packages, IMHO. At worst it would mean that 4.4.12 will not be compatible with older sage releases.

Well, we were debugging a problem, OK? :-)

We need to understand how you get that 4.4.10 gets back at you
on a binary distro.

When I said "a fresh install" I really meant it, not a clone...
(cp -a <your-sageroot> <newsageroot> will do the job, but sage -clone won't !)
May I humbly request that you create a really new 4.3.2 install,
from source (a binary download would NOT work --- I do not know why, but this is not the place fix this bug or feature --- I'll ask on sage-devel), 
and try the packages there.
Thanks in advance.

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A15):
I found where the problem lies: when you upgrade gap_packages,
the file gap-4.4.12.p2.spkg must be physically present in spkg/standard

If it is there, I can do sage -f gap_packages-...spkg
just fine.
The file names are used by the script  spkg/standard/newest_version
to get the version of the installed package.

This script is called in spkg-install of gap_packages spkg.

So it would not work if you do 
spkg -f http://....gap-4.4.12.p2.spkg
instead.

This is not our bug, I think. (spkg/standard/newest_version is a standard thing...)

Thanks!

could you please meanwhile give the positive review to 
#8076 - i.e. to the ticket on the gap-4.4.12 spkg?

I suppose Leon's code is also in 4.4.10, so there should be no problem
with also compiling it on 4.4.12. I'll add this to spkg-install later today...

database_gap is just a copy you your latest 4.4.12 spkg, unless I forgot
something... As far as I recall, no updates were necessary.

In 4.4.10 Leon's code was compiled in gap spkg, not in gap_packages spkg.
So, when you created 1st versions of 4.4.12-spkg's, you (rightly) took out this compilation from gap spkg, but did not add it in  gap_packages spkg.
That's why it's missing at the moment.
I will add it to gap_packages spkg.

There was a trivial typo in spkg-install that prevented all 
of guava from being compiled.
I fixed it, and put the new version of the spkg here
[http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/gap_packages-4.4.12_2.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/gap_packages-4.4.12_2.spkg)
Please reinstall and test the relevant part.
I tested on Linux that -t -optional passes on sage/coding/ after this fix.

> Okay, modulo the sage -f bug reported in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/8236, here is what I have done.
> 
> On a mac 10.6.2 machine running sage 4.3.2, I applied trac-8150, then sage -f gap-4.4.12, then sage -f gap_packages, then sage -f database_gap, as indicated in the instructions above. All went fine and sage -testall passes. I then ran sage -testall --optional. I could see only one related failure and it might or might not be minor. Apparently when the new gap_packages skpg was built, it was not set to compile and install the guava C code written by J Leon. This caused 2 failures. When I compiled the code (the traceback tells you how), that test passed. I tested the packages with some random GAP commands and everything else seems to be installed and working fine.
> 
> If this trac ticket is to judge only gap-4.4.12, then I give it a positive review. If it is to also include gap_packages then maybe I have some reservations (database_gap seems fine though). Since gap_packages is in the title of the ticket, I am hesitant to give this a positive review yet. I don't know if Leon's code is so old that it will not compile on some machines, in which case this is not a problem for this ticket. So, I am marking this as needs info.

The binary from Leon's code did not compile for me the first time (installing via the internet). Then I downloaded the spkg and installed using sage -f and it worked. The sage -t --optional from last time passes now.

I'm a little bit curious as to why I had to install it twice, though I think this should get a positive review since it seems that the package is fine but the internet installation method is not working as I expected. (BTW, my mac asks me before opening a file downloaded from the internet - I wonder if that is an issue?)

Still, thanks very much Dima.
