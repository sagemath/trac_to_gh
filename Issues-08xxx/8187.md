More often, when we compare two words, we test their equality and not that one is less than the other. So why not implement the equatlity test!? This ticket does this for datatypes and for math objects.

1. This patch adds equality test for `WordDatatype_str`, `WordDatatype_list` and `WordDatatype_tuple`  (via `__richcmp__`) usefull when comparing two words represented by the same kind of data. It is now as fast as the python object :

```
BEFORE:

    sage: w = Word(range(10000))
    sage: z = Word(range(10000))
    sage: %timeit w == z
    125 loops, best of 3: 4.08 ms per loop

AFTER:

    sage: w = Word(range(10000))
    sage: z = Word(range(10000))
    sage: %timeit w == z
    625 loops, best of 3: 422 µs per loop

PYTHON OBJECT:

    sage: w = range(10000)
    sage: z = range(10000)
    sage: %timeit w == z
    625 loops, best of 3: 442 µs per loop
```

```
BEFORE:

    sage: w = Word(tuple(range(10000)))
    sage: z = Word(tuple(range(10000)))
    sage: %timeit w == z
    125 loops, best of 3: 3.97 ms per loop

AFTER:

    sage: w = Word(tuple(range(10000)))
    sage: z = Word(tuple(range(10000)))
    sage: %timeit w == z
    625 loops, best of 3: 419 µs per loop

PYTHON OBJECT:

    sage: w = tuple(range(10000))
    sage: z = tuple(range(10000))
    sage: %timeit w == z
    625 loops, best of 3: 420 µs per loop
```

```
BEFORE:

    sage: w = Word('a'*10000)
    sage: z = Word('a'*10000)
    sage: %timeit w == z
    125 loops, best of 3: 3.9 ms per loop

AFTER:

    sage: w = Word('a'*10000)
    sage: z = Word('a'*10000)
    sage: %timeit w == z
    625 loops, best of 3: 2.36 µs per loop

PYTHON OBJECT:

    sage: w = 'a'*10000
    sage: z = 'a'*10000
    sage: %timeit w == z
    625 loops, best of 3: 2.03 µs per loop

```

2. Add the `__eq__` and `__ne__` for `Word_class` because it is faster than using `__cmp__` (especially when parent alphabet are defined). These functions are used to test the equality of two words represented by different python objects (datatypes).

no parents :

```
BEFORE:

    sage: L = range(10000)
    sage: t = tuple(L)
    sage: w = Word(L)
    sage: z = Word(t)
    sage: type(w)
    <class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
    sage: type(z)
    <class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_tuple'>
    sage: %timeit w == z
    125 loops, best of 3: 3.69 ms per loop


AFTER:

    sage: L = range(10000)
    sage: t = tuple(L)
    sage: w = Word(L)
    sage: z = Word(t)
    sage: type(w)
    <class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
    sage: type(z)
    <class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_tuple'>
    sage: %timeit w == z
    625 loops, best of 3: 1.44 ms per loop
```

with parents (!!):

```
BEFORE:

    sage: W = Words([0,1,2])
    sage: w = W([0, 1, 1, 2]*4000)
    sage: z = W([0, 1, 1, 2]*4000)
    sage: %timeit w == z
    5 loops, best of 3: 63 ms per loop

AFTER:

    sage: W = Words([0,1,2])
    sage: w = W([0, 1, 1, 2]*4000)
    sage: z = W([0, 1, 1, 2]*4000)
    sage: %timeit w == z
    125 loops, best of 3: 2.57 ms per loop
```

I tested the patch and everything seems fine. Although it modifies several basic functions, it doesn't seem to have any side effect. I couldn't check all documentation since some part of the code is written in Cython, but the functions I did check built correctly.

I've made minor changes in the doc: just formatting some part of the code or correcting typos. If Sébastien agrees with my change, I allow him to set the path to `positive review`.
