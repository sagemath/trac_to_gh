We would like to have hdf5 support into sage. This will include the C/C++ bindings and also should have the Java bindings. 

To obtain HDF5:
http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html

Current version of spkg (install in order):
* https://github.com/downloads/aginiewicz/spkgs/hdf5-1.8.9.spkg

Hi,

So if you build

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/hdf5-1.6.9.spkg

and 

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/h5py-1.2.1.spkg

then it should work.  Example, do:

```
   sage -f  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/hdf5-1.6.9.spkg  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/h5py-1.2.1.spkg
```

I'm posting this for inclusion in the *experimental* repo.

Well, after a year I forgot about it - the files are present, but url changed. For now I don't have time to update them though (h5py is now 2.0.1 and hdf5 is 1.8.8). Anyway, working links:

http://im.pwr.wroc.pl/~giniew/h5py-1.3.0.spkg

and

http://im.pwr.wroc.pl/~giniew/hdf5-1.8.4.spkg
