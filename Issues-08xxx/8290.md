Here is a quick spkg that works if you have libhdf5 devel packages installed on your computer:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/h5py-1.2.1.spkg

Install it with

```
sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/h5py-1.2.1.spkg

I also made an hdf5 library spkg, but the hdf5 version is evidently too new for h5py:

http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/prev-releases/hdf5-1.8.0/src/hdf5-1.8.0.tar.gz

since compiling this, then h5py does not work.

Hi,

So if you build

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/hdf5-1.6.9.spkg

and 

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/h5py-1.2.1.spkg

then it should work.  Example, do:

```
   sage -f  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/hdf5-1.6.9.spkg  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/h5py-1.2.1.spkg
```

I'm posting this for inclusion in the *experimental* repo.

Here's a trivial example showing how to create a new HDF5 file and store a 100 x 20 array of floats:

>>> f = h5py.File("myfile.hdf5", 'w')
>>> f["MyDataset"] = numpy.ones((100,20))
