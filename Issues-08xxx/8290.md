http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/prev-releases/hdf5-1.8.0/src/hdf5-1.8.0.tar.gz

since compiling this, then h5py does not work.

Hi,

So if you build

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/hdf5-1.6.9.spkg

and 

    http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/h5py-1.2.1.spkg

then it should work.  Example, do:

```
   sage -f  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/hdf5-1.6.9.spkg  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/h5py-1.2.1.spkg
```

I'm posting this for inclusion in the *experimental* repo.

I made quick update of those to hdf5 1.8, also this version of h5py works with hdf5 from spkg (at least it works for me - only had to specify "--hdf=$SAGE_LOCAL" to build script).

http://lab15.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~giniew/h5py-1.3.0.spkg

http://lab15.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~giniew/hdf5-1.8.4.spkg (actually, it's 1.8.4 patch 1, latest supported by h5py at time of writing - wasn't sure if I should add the patch1 to name here).

They are based on packages posted here earlier - just updated the src to pointed h5py to local hdf5 copy.
