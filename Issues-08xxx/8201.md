The spkg-install script on Linux first checks "which gfortran" and if no instance is found it aborts. This is a problem if for example the binary is gfortran-4.3. Then sage won't build.

Even then scipy won't build, because as soon as compiler flags are passed in scipy's setup.py, the fortran compiler is not found anymore. This happens because "sage_fortran" is our binary/script but it should be a stardard name. Scipy will have to care for the -fPIC flags.

This is related to #8049 !

What happens if you set SAGE_FORTRAN to /usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.3 ? 

You might find that is all you need, as perhaps 'which' will not be called then. The whole idea of SAGE_FORTRAN is to specify the Fortran compiler. I do wonder if it might not be less hassle to just create a link so there is a program called 'gfortran'. 

Have you checked this on Solaris 10? It is the sort of thing that could screw up on there as there are lots of code changes. 

There's general information about building on Solaris at

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

Information specifically for 't2' at

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

Both the source (4.3.0.1 is the latest to build on Solaris) and a binary which will run on any SPARC can be found at http://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html

What makes you think a symbolic link is a hack? It is very standard practice on Unix systems to create symbolic links for this very purpose. There are loads of them created in Sage. (Some people call them soft links). 

Many shell scripts start 

```/bin/sh
```

But most linux distros do not have a program called /bin/sh. Rather /bin/sh is simply a link to bash, dash or some other shell. On sage.math

```
kirkby@sage:~$ ls -l /bin/sh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 2010-02-02 13:49 /bin/sh -> dash
kirkby@sage:~$ ls -l /bin/dash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 100856 2009-03-09 06:18 /bin/dash
```

When you type 'sh' on sage.math you are really running 'dash'

> Moreover, I don't have admin rights.


You don't need admin rights to create a symbolic link. Something like:

```
$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.2 $HOME/bin/gfortran
```

will do fine. Then make sure $HOME/bin is in your path before /usr/local/bin. Your will then have 'gfortran'. 

> I don't have access to Solaris; And I don't have experience with it. But if the GNU suit is installed it should work; if not it won't, but scipy has to blamed for this not fortran itself.



Do you have an account on sage.math or similar? If so, you have an account on 't2' - or if not, one is easily created. For all practical purposes you will not find it significantly different from Linux. 

> If you can test this on Soloaris I would be happy to integrate any changes you suggest. 


Unfortunately, I simply do not have time to test everyones changes on Solaris - let alone generate patches if they do not work. 

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/inclusion.html

makes it clear that for a package to be included in Sage, it must support Solaris. 

**Some Sage developers are willing to help you port to OS X, Solaris and Windows. But this is no guarantee and you or your project are expected to do the heavy lifting and also support those ports upstream if there is no Sage developer who is willing to share the burden.**

Your solution seems like a *sledgehammer to crack a walnut* if you know what I mean by that. A symbolic link has far greater chance of just working, without risking breaking things for everyone else. In stead you propose making changes that could impact anyone, without actually testing them. 

**I'm marking this as wontfix, as I believe the patch is unnecessary. You may find another reviewer see this differently, though I doubt you will find any experienced system administrator see it that way**
