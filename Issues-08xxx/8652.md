I got this bug/traceback today by making a file grader.py and a file grader.sage (their content doesn't matter).  

```
sage: import grader
sage: load grader.sage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/Users/wstein/edu/2010/480/grading/<ipython console> in <module>()

/Users/wstein/sage/build/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/preparser.pyc in load(filename, globals, attach)
   1487             return
   1488         
-> 1489     filename = filename.strip()
   1490     
   1491     if filename.lower().startswith('http://'):

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'strip'
sage: 
```

The above bug is the fault of the rewrite *I* did of load and attach, so is my fault.

Did I miss something?

If I create both files `foo.py` and `foo.sage`, then

```
sage: import foo
I am foo.py
sage: load foo.sage
I am foo.sage
```

doesn't give an error (in 4.3.5).

This still works properly on 5.1.beta0. In two years no one has reported or reproduced this bug; I propose we close it.
