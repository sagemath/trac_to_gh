Again, this is the nested class problem. I uploaded a patch which fixes that.
I also added UniqueRepresentation to _python_object_alphabet (there seems to
be only one), hence inheriting missing equality.

Should be ready for review.

sage: B = Z.alphabet()
sage: B

AFTER with the patche applied:

```
sage: W = Words()
sage: A = W.alphabet()
sage: A
Python objects
sage: Z = loads(dumps(W))
sage: B = Z.alphabet()
sage: B
Python objects
sage: A is B
True
sage: W is Z
False
sage: W == Z
True
sage: loads(dumps(A))
Python objects
sage: loads(dumps(B))

```


Hence, the problem described in this ticket is fixed by the patch. Moreover, all tests passed in the sage tree. Positive review.

Note to the release manager : this patch commutes with the one at #8429.

In the "TESTS:" section, you should saying something like:

```
TESTS:

Test that #8475 is fixed::

    <put-your-tests-here>
```
That way, you provide more context for why you are writing that test. Plus, it makes it easier to locate the relevant ticket number. I leave it up to you to modify the patch as appropriate.
