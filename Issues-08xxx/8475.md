Again, this is the nested class problem. I uploaded a patch which fixes that.
I also added UniqueRepresentation to _python_object_alphabet (there seems to
be only one), hence inheriting missing equality.

Should be ready for review.

Hence, the problem described in this ticket is fixed by the patch. Moreover, all tests passed in the sage tree. Positive review.

Note to the release manager : this patch commutes with the one at #8429.

In the "TESTS:" section, you should saying something like:

```
TESTS:
