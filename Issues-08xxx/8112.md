flint-1.5.0.p3 fails to build if SAGE64=yes and no CFLAGS and CFLAG64 are set globally due to a 32/64 bit issue.

A patch is on it's way.

<a id='comment:2'></a>It's not clear to me what is intended here. 

* There is no such thing as CXXFLAG. Did you mean CXXFLAGS? 
* The point of CFLAG64 is that it would be set to whatever flag is needed to build 64 bit executables with a C compiler, which -m64 in most, but not all cases. 
* The point of CXXFLAG64 is that it would be set to whatever flag is needed to build 64 bit executables with a C++ compiler, which -m64 in most, but not all cases. 


If Flint will build by setting the environment variables CFLAG64 and CXXFLAG64 to -m64, then I would not bother patching Flint at all. Just set those two environments variables. They will not mess up the build process in any way, and since they are variables, they could be set to something else. Setting CFLAGS is known to cause problems, but setting CFLAG64 or CXXFLAG64 will not cause any problems. 

If you do need to patch this again, then you can remove this code:

```
./test_gcc_version.sh
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
   echo "GCC version less than 3.4.0"
   echo "Flint will not be able to compile successfully"
   exit 1
fi
```

since 'prereq' will ensure that gcc is at least 4.0.1. That also means the file test_gcc_version.sh can be removed, as it is now redundant. 

Thinking about this 64-bit patching process in general, it is better to simply use CFLAG64 and CXXFLAG64 rather than -m64, and simply document the user must type

```
$ CFLAG64=-m64
$ export CFLAG64
$ CXXFLAG64=-m64
$ export CXXFLAG64
```

until such time as sage-env is updated. At which point, that will be unnecessary to do. That will avoid -m64 ever having to be hard-coded again, which is a good thing, as not all compilers accept that flag. 

I suspect this ticket can be closed as 'wontfix' as no fixes are needed, but I may be wrong.

I don't see anything alike in the patch file!?

Are you shure flint will build that way?

<a id='comment:4'></a>Maybe the description was somewhat misleading or I was unclear over the meaning of this.

What I propose is:

```
if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
   FLINT_TUNE=" -fPIC -m64 -funroll-loops"
   export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -m64"
   export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -m64"
   export CFLAG64="$CFLAG64 -m64"
   export CXXFLAG64="$CXXFLAG -m64"
fi

```

Now if CFLAGS is empty the -m64 gets in.

See the patch.

<a id='comment:5'></a>This has been a bit messed up by me, as I made some changes which assumed we could set CFLAGS globally, but we can't. 

I'd proposed using CFLAG64 to be the C compiler flag(s) needed to build a 64-bit binary, which are usually -m64, but might not be. That could be set globally, but lets assume for now it is not. 

How would something like this seem:

If [ -z "$CFLAG64" ] ; then 
  CFLAG64=-m64
fi

(see how I did this in #8191) 

http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8191/R.patch

Then simply append $CFLAG64 to FLINT_TUNE. But remove the -m64, as we don't need both. 

Since CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are not set in spkg-install, there is no point exporting them. Neither is there any point in exporting CFLAG64 or CXXFLAG64 as again they are not used by Flint. 

I think **all** that needs to be done is to set CFLAG64 to be -m64 unless it is set to something else, then ensure that for a 64-bit build, FLINT_TUNE gets $CFLAG64 included.
