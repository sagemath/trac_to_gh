This example does not work from the tutorial http://www.sagemath.org/doc/numerical_sage/f2py.html:

```
%fortran

        Subroutine Rescale(a,b,n)
        Implicit none
        Integer n,i,j
        Real*8 a(n,n), b
Cf2py intent(in,out) a
        do i = 1,n
           do j=1,n
             a(i,j)=b*a(i,j)
           end do
        end do
        end
```

The error is:

```

```

I get the same error if I delete the blank line after %fortran.

However, if I change the notebook cell to have a comment as the first line, it seems to work just fine:

```
%fortran
C
        Subroutine Rescale(a,b,n)
        Implicit none
        Integer n,i,j
        Real*8 a(n,n), b
Cf2py intent(in,out) a
        do i = 1,n
           do j=1,n
             a(i,j)=b*a(i,j)
           end do
        end do
        end
```

This is on Sage 4.3.3 (sagenb.org)
