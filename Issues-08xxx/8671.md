I'm worried by the fact that right._parent fails while parent(right) succeeds.

`_parent` is a cdef'd attribute. At the point this code is used, Cython doesn't know that `right` is an `Element`, so it generates code to look for a python attribute `_parent` which fails.

One solution would be to use a type cast by writing `(<Element>right)._parent`, but we'd have to handle python types like `int` manually before this. The function `parent()`, which in turn calls `sage.structure.parent.parent_c` is used exactly for this purpose.

Calling parent_c directly would be faster, but that is not exported in `sage/structure/parent.pxd`.

That makes sense.

Patch applies fine to 4.4.2.rc0 and tests in sage/structure and sage/rings/ pass.  So, positive review.
