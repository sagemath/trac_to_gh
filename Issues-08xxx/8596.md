Additive magmas get addition tables in #7555.  `IntegerModRings` will provide a nice class of examples, once they are added into categories - this is #8562 which is waiting on finite field rearrangments.  Docstring for `addition_table` can be modeled after the one for `multiplication_table` of magmas.
