I forgot to test my fix from #8042 on 32-bit platforms, and the fix causes doctest failures anywhere that `long` is smaller than 64 bits. I'm attaching a simple patch to fix this -- we just don't perform that test on 32-bit platforms.

With this patch applied, on 32-bit linux we have:

```
wstein@ubuntu32:/tmp/wstein/farm/sage-4.3.2.alpha0$         sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/libs/cremona/newforms.pyx"                                                                                        

sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/libs/cremona/newforms.pyx"   

         [6.3 s]
                
```

Which is good.   However, I do not think the patch you posted explains very well what is going on.  It's not good for a user reading it.  I've posted an additional patch (apply after yours), which I think does a better job testing things and illustrating the issue.
