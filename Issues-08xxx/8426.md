This should work:

```
import numpy
R.<x>=RR[]
x*numpy.float32('23.0')
```

Instead, I get:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Real Field with 53 bits of precision' and '<type 'numpy.float32'>'
```

Note that this does work:

```
sage: numpy.float32('23.0')*x
23.0000000000000*x
```

Hello,

I propose to close this as duplicates because of #18076 that fixes it. With the branch applied I got

```
sage: import numpy
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: x * numpy.float32('23.0')
23.0000000000000*x
```
and even the pushout works

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: x * numpy.float32('23.0')
23.0*x
sage: parent(_)
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Real Double Field
```

Vincent
