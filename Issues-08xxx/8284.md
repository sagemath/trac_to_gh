Please add the following doctests:

1. An example of `is_chordal` for a non-connected graph.

2. Examples of the usage of each option to `lex_BFS`.

After this is done, I'll be happy with the patch. All tests pass.

The ``max`` instruction fails with this modification, as the --possibly last-- vertex in the list may have been removed before, thus max is trying to find the maximum of an empty list ...

This new graphs.IntervalGraph and the repaired graphs.RandomInterval work as advertised. Nicely done Nathann. 

However, I think graphs.Interval should allow repeated intervals, e.g., 
g = graphs.IntervalGraph( [(0,2), (0,2), (1,5), (3,7)] )
should create a graph with four vertices (not three as the method currently does).

You might be able to get away with just creating a class that doesn't have a defined hash function, so that the default (the memory address) is used.  The problem with using a tuple is that the two hash values below are the same:

```
sage: a=(1,2)
sage: b=(1,2)
sage: hash(a)
3713081631934410656
sage: hash(b)
3713081631934410656
```

We can use a feature of user-defined classes, though:

"User-defined classes have __cmp__()  and __hash__()  methods by default; with them, all objects compare unequal (except with themselves) and x.__hash__()  returns id(x)."

This means we can get vertices which contain objects which normally would be considered equal in a dictionary to be stored as two different things in a dictionary:

```
sage: class Vertex(object):
....:     def __init__(self, value):
....:         self.__value=value
....:         
sage: a=Vertex((1,2))
sage: b=Vertex((1,2))
sage: a is b
False
sage: hash(a)
4528980944
sage: hash(b)
4528980816
sage: Graph({a: [b]})
Graph on 2 vertices
```

Does that address the problem?  It introduces a problem, in that now you can't do:

`g[Vertex((1,2))]`

to get the neighbors, since, of course, the element you are creating is not the same as any of the vertices of the graph.  Also, you have to use v.__value to get the interval (or better, make some accessors for the attribute (and if you want, try to disallow changing it).

Hmmmm.. Anyway creating a RealInterval class wouldn't be a solution as we would like RealInterval(1,2) == RealInterval(1,2) to be True, which can not hold if we want the vertices to be different in the Graph  :-/

In the end, perhaps the best idea is the one Ed mentionned in one of his emails : just labels the vertices with (id,(a.b)), and forget about unnecessary abstraction, which wouldn't add anything in this case...

But then the user creating an interval graph by giving a list of pairs (a,b) would not be able to guess the name of its vertices, as they would depend on the id given by IntervalGraph. Of course we can make it number them according to the order given by the list, but I don't like it very much either :-/

Any idea ? :-/
