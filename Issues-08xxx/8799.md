The patch provides 100% doctests to sage/libs/mwrank (both files mwrank.pyx and interface.py), as well as adding them to the reference manual.

This is 95% in the docstrings, but I did find a few fairly minor bugs (mainly in the documentation not saying what various parameters did precisely).

Patch up very soon -- just doing final testing.

The reviewer patch fix this issue and a bunch of typos. What we need now is someone to review the technical aspect of John's patch. Unfortunately, I'm not at all familiar with elliptic curves.

Many thanks for the reviewer patch, and many many apologies for all those typose & other things which I missed converting from old-style docstring format to ReST.

For info:  the removal of the trailing L on those output constants is correct:  I converted various integers in the output to Sage integers (they were python ints).

I CC'd rlm, hoping that he'll be able to look at this too.

Hmm, what's the convention for typesetting numbers, isolated or e.g. in *2-descent*?

Math mode looks very ugly (and isn't consistently used).

Also, *Python* should be uppercase, and *Sha* should be *SHA* I guess.

There are also some (non-)references e.g. to *2-descent* where I guess <code>:meth:\`two_descent\`</code> should be used.

Btw, both patches work for 4.4.1.rc0 (which is almost 4.4.1), too, and doctests pass.
I only get an error when building PDF documentation, due to some reference with an underscore(?), haven't yet closely looked at that.

No, not really. Minh introduced *some* math-typeset numbers - isolated and within words (but did not change all occurrences), and did not "change" all method references.

There's also some reference to Python's (deprecated) `long`.

The typesetting of Python (variable) names (and e.g. *true* instead of `True`) is not fully consistent, too.

(The return value descriptions use both passive and imperative form, too. ;-) )

But I don't want to grumble to much...

Better first look at the diff (before applying the patch); I've changed various things (including a typo in the actual code), but haven't reverted anything Minh changed (at least I think so), i.e. math-typeset numbers etc. still look ugly. ;-)

I've (yet) changed little in `mwrank.pyx`, because I can't find documentation generated from anything but the two pure Python functions... ;-)

My second reviewer patch [trac_8799-reviewer-part3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8799/trac_8799-reviewer-part3.patch) includes changes in addition to the original reviewer patch and leif's patch.

Also notice that I move documentation for constructor methods, i.e. `__init__`, into the docstring of a class. The main reason is that, currently the docstring of `__init__` don't show up on the reference manual once you built it. 



To rebuild the whole reference manual, you could do the following from `SAGE_ROOT`, assuming you applied the patches to the branch main:

```sh
./sage -b main
./sage -docbuild reference html
```

If you want to be thorough and want to check that the new documentation build OK, do:

```sh
rm -rf devel/sage-main/doc/output/
./sage -b main
./sage -docbuild reference html
```

Minh, you vote in favour of math-typeset numbers? (I don't like e.g. <code>\`L\`-functions</code> either...)

Shouldn't we replace

```
 - foo (bool) -- ...
 - bar (int, default 12) -- ...
```
by

```
 - foo (:class:`bool`) -- ...
 - bar (:class:`int`, default 12) -- ...
```
too?

Well, I haven't reverted your changes of e.g. `1` to <code>\`1\`</code>; the HTML output is not very nice...

> I have folded all our reviewer patches into one cumulative patch.

Yes, of course noticed that.

> I would prefer something like "boolean", "integer", "real number", etc. Something as "meaningful" as possible, without recourse to type information.

This might not sound pythonic, but I'd prefer documenting the concrete type if the function actually expects some Python type (rather than a duck).

> We now need someone to review the technical (mathematical) aspect of John's patch,

rlm?

I've positively reviewed *your* changes... :)

So unfortunately someone else (other than John and us) has to review the cumulative reviewer patch to avoid mutual peer-reviewing on the same ticket (some people seem to have no problems with this, I do).

> I did not see the typo in the code which Leif mentioned.  Is it where we test height_bound > 21.4 and not 21.48?

No. I meant:

```
-        verbose == bool(verbose)
+        verbose = bool(verbose)
```
> In that place, it is true that this could be approximately doubled on 64-bit machines (I guess that when this code was first written the person doing it did not know how to test that) but in practice using bounds > 21 will take a very very long time.

It's just that the implementation doesn't meet the documentation:

```
        - ``height_limit`` (float, default: 18) -- search up to this
          logarithmic height.

        .. note::
        
          On 32-bit machines, this *must* be < 21.48 else
          `\exp(h_{\text{lim}}) > 2^{31}` and overflows.  On 64-bit machines, it
          must be *at most* 43.668.  However, this bound is a logarithmic
          bound and increasing it by just 1 increases the running time
          by (roughly) `\exp(1.5)=4.5`, so searching up to even 20
          takes a very long time.
```
(We could add here that larger heights for 64-bit code currently aren't implemented in the Python interface.) 

```
        height_limit = float(height_limit)
        if height_limit >= 21.4:	# TODO: docstring says 21.48 (for 32-bit machines; what about 64-bit...?)
            raise ValueError, "The height limit must be < 21.4."
```
Also, if the docstring says `21.48`, the code should use the same value.

(Note that the code should check for what machine the code/`mwrank` was compiled for, not what machine Sage is currently running on...)

But that (change of the implementation, and perhaps other TODOs, like in `mwrank_EllipticCurve.__repr__()`) should be fixed on another ticket.

Definitely. :)

I just checked that the patches apply fine to 4.4.2.rc0 (they do) and did a full make ptest.

This reveals a small problem in sage/libs/mwrank.pyx:  The reviewer patch removes two L suffixes from the output of E.discriminant() and E.conductor(), on long python ints.  I think this must be 32/64-bit dependent.  The best soution (surely) is to make those functions return Sage integers in the first place.  I will add that.

In the mean time I have put this back to "need work", realising that it has missged the boat for 4.4.2 anyway...
