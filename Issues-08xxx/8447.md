Various threads - e.g

http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/29ee9e1d4efdeda2

indicate that it is problematic when very old distributions of Sage are used in distributions of Debian, Ubunta etc. 

Whilst this is "shutting the gate afte the horse has bolted", it would be useful if future versions of Sage indicated when they are very old. 

Perhaps one message should be generated if the date on the computer is more than 4 months in advance of the Sage release date, and a stronger message is isssues if it is more than 12 months old. The exact wording and periods would have to be discussed in sage-devel. 

Whatever method is used, it should be portable, and non rely on GNU-specific options to the 'date' command, or any other GNUism. 

See 

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/date.html


for POSIX options to the *date* command.

Well, at least the Sage banner shows the release date... ;-)

Perhaps something for our NagBot writer?

From the ticket's title I first guessed you meant detecting "dead" Sage 3.x (Debian/Ubuntu) packages installed on the user's system, like this one:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 3.0.5, Release Date: 2008-07-11                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
A few times there have been "bug reports" and questions (not explicitly) referring to *that* version... :)

Another issue is the "frozen" `#sage-devel` banner nobody has the power to update:

```
Logs of this channel are posted online | Sage - free open-source mathematics software |
Ask questions here and wait, or post to sage-support list | www.sagemath.org |
stable: 4.3.1 | dev: 4.3.2.alpha1
```

I'm not sure if it is desirable to continually check for recent Sage versions (e.g. at start-up); at least such a feature should be disableable.

True, but many users will probably assume its the latest version available when they go to the Debian site. If there was a warning like 

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 3.0.5, Release Date: 2008-07-11                       |

| WARNING You are using a VERY old version of Sage. We suggest you   |
| to http://www.sagemath.org/ and download the latest version.       |
| The latest version has a lot more features                         |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```


> I'm not sure if it is desirable to continually check for recent Sage versions (e.g. at start-up); at least such a feature should be disableable.

I was thinking just on date. That should be very easy to do - just a bit of Python, that issues one warning when Sage is say 3 months old, and a stronger one when its a year old. Assuming the date in Sage is right, and the persons computer has the right date, that should work. 

Checking online for version updates is a more tricky issue - some people have privacy concerns over that. If that was implemented, I think the default should be off. It's also a lot more work to do. 

My python skills are next to useless, otherwise I'd tackle this myself. (Not that having poor python skills seems to put some others off writing code for Sage!)
