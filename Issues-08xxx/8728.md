This is fixed now and needs a doctest:

From #sage-devel:

```
Boulemans left the chat room. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:58am] Boule joined the chat room.
[11:58am] Boule: (laptop shutdown due to power supply)
[11:59am] Boule: e, T, w = var("e T w"); assume(1 = e^2)>0; integrate(cos(w+T)/(1+e*cos(T))^2,T,0,2*pi) should give -2*pi e cos w/(1-e^2)^3/2 instead of 0
[11:59am] Boule: can someone help?
[12:00pm] wjp: yeah, sage seems to have some trouble with this integral. You could try http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support since the right people don't seem to be here currently
[12:00pm] Boule: ok, thanx
[12:08pm] kcrisman: By the way, I just tried this and get a hang in Maxima.  Can you type the exact commands which lead to an answer of 0?
[12:08pm] kcrisman: If I plug something (.5, .75) in for e in Maxima in Sage, I do get zero as an output.
[12:12pm] Boule: don't know maxima, but with numerical values for e and w at wolfram-alfa, it gives something different than 0
[12:13pm] wjp: *nod* maple gives non-zeros too
[12:13pm] kcrisman: Can you give the *exact* sequence of commands which yield zero in Sage itself? 
[12:14pm] Boule: e = var('e')
[12:14pm] Boule: T = var('T')
[12:14pm] Boule: w = var('w')
[12:14pm] baali1 joined the chat room.
[12:14pm] baali left the chat room. (Quit: Leaving.)
[12:15pm] Boule: assume(1-e^2>0)
[12:15pm] Boule:  integrate(cos(w+T)/(1+e*cos(T))^2,T,0,2*pi)
[12:15pm] kcrisman: Okay, that's what I thought.
[12:16pm] kcrisman: Okay, it takes a while but I do get 0.

It was fixed about two weeks ago in maxima.  There was a new release of maxima a few days ago---I'm trying to make an spkg right now.

In Maxima 5.33.0 (see #13973):

```
(%i1) assume(e^2<1);
                                     2
(%o1)                              [e  < 1]
(%i2) integrate(cos(w+T)/(1+e*cos(T))^2, T, 0, 2*%pi);
                      2
Is abs(e) - sqrt(1 - e ) - 1 positive, negative or zero?

negative;
   !          2     !
Is !sqrt(1 - e ) - 1! - abs(e) positive, negative or zero?

negative;
                                             2
                           2 %pi e sqrt(1 - e ) cos(w)
(%o2)                    - ---------------------------
                                   4      2
                                  e  - 2 e  + 1
```
This appears to be the correct answer.  Note that the answers to both questions are "negative" for all *e* with -1 < *e* < 1, so it would be nice if Maxima didn't ask those questions.

The thing noted in the message upstream when they closed their ticket

```
sage: integrate(cos(w+T)/(1+.5*cos(T))^2,T,0,2*pi)
<boom>
```
does still happen, but I think that is a different issue tracked elsewhere here (the usual keepfloat thing).

So... do we have a reasonable test case to add here to confirm this is fixed and close it?

Your assumptions are contradictory: the first assumption (`1 - e^2 > 0`) implies the negation of the other two assumptions (see also [comment:15](#comment%3A15)).

A fortiori, the other two assumptions (after negating) are actually redundant.  It is annoying that we have to add them; ideally, we would only declare this integral to be "fixed" if Maxima did not need the extra two assumptions...

That too, but more importantly I meant the fact that the assumptions that are currently made in the doctest are mutually inconsistent:

```
assume(1-c^2 > 0)
assume(abs(c) - sqrt(1-c^2) - 1 > 0)
assume(abs(sqrt(1-c^2)-1) - abs(c) > 0)
```
Namely, the first assumption is equivalent to `-1 < c < 1`, and on this domain the functions `abs(c) - sqrt(1-c^2) - 1` and `abs(sqrt(1-c^2)-1) - abs(c)` are strictly negative.

There is already some functionality for detecting inconsistent assumptions (e.g. `assume(x > 0); assume(x < 0)` raises an error), but it doesn't detect this case.
