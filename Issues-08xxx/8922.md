This patch add to Sage the method Graph.induced_subgraph_search which looks for a given graph as an induced subgraph of "self".

This is done through exhaustive search, using a very basic new graph class hand-made to efficiently stand such repetitive operations !

I tried to document the code so that it could be somewhat easy to review, but feel free to ask any question about it ! :-)

Updated ! Changes :

* it took me some time, but I tested the new graph classes StaticDenseGraph this patch introduced against the already implemented DenseGraph.... Which turned out to be more efficient.. So this new class has disappeared, and the new code is now written into the usual Sage files instead of new ones

* a -- very nasty -- memory leak -- now fixed

* add functions to test for induced as well as non-induced subgraphs, as it is the same.. Also works with DiGraphs, by the way !

And once this patch will be merged into Sage... I will have many other things to write on top of it :-)

I have been reviewing your previous patch for over two days and went the same route as you have done in your current patch. That is, I rewrote your StaticDenseGraph to use the C graph based DenseGraph class, as it is very efficient in terms of storage. The reason why I have not uploaded my reviewer patch is that I was thinking about and playing with how to make the method `adjacency_list` more efficient in terms of storage. An array of ints is wasteful for the intended purpose, when a bitset is more suited to the purpose. What has been bugging me is trying to get my bitset implementation of `adjacency_list` to compile and work.




>     * a -- very nasty -- memory leak -- now fixed


Again, I went the same route in my reviewer patch.

Again, I went the same route in my reviewer patch.




Seems like you anticipated my changes. Anyway, I'll have a careful look at your updated patch.

Hello !!

Well, first thank you for your work on this patch... I know it's a bit heavy all at once, and I hope the comments were clear enough :-)

About the ``adjacency_list`` method : I was more worried about speed than storage, but anyway DenseGraph were faster than my matrix of integers..  Don't you think working on integers as it is done inside of DenseGraph could be more efficient than it currently is ? I have never used operations such as << and >> as it is done in DenseGraph, but I thought it would be the next step if one wanted to improve the speed for a bit. I'll trust you on this one !

I also took some notes for future improvements... For example several tricks to reduce the number of attempts, or the initial graph, but I intended to wait for this patch to be merged before adding them. It will be easier to read in another one anyway :-)

Thank you again

I applied patches in the order suggested in the ticket description. Running doctests on the whole graph theory module resulted in these failures. This failure results from ncohen's updated patch, which does not update the doctests:

Changes in reviewer patch:

* Move the method `adjacency_sequence()` to the class `CGraph`, as I think that method is useful for both dense and sparse graphs.
* Clean-up coding style in accordance with PEP 008.
* In describing the algorithm used in `subgraph_search()` of the module `generic_graph_pyx.pyx`, you have the formula:

 ```
 `\binom k!{|V(G)|}{k}`
 ```
 That won't typeset in LaTeX as you expected. Do you mean this?

 ```
 `k! \binom{|V(G)|}{k}`
 ```
 I have used the latter formula in my reviewer patch. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
* Unit tests for the `cdef` functions `vectors_equal()` and `vectors_inferior()`, and the method `adjacency_sequence()`. These functions/methods are defined using `cdef` and the doctest coverage script don't pick them up in its analysis. However, I still think it's important to provide unit tests for such functions/methods.
* Amalgamate the methods `induced_subgraph_search()` and `subgraph_search()`. Their definitions are almost identical, except for the keyword `induced`. The combined method is defined to take the boolean keyword `induced` and pass it on to the relevant method.

Another pair of eyes is needed to look over my reviewer patch.

Hello !!

First, I want to thank you for the amount of time your must have spent on this :-)

>  * Move the method `adjacency_sequence()` to the class `CGraph`, as I think that method is useful for both dense and sparse graphs.


It can be, though systematically testing adjacencies (and most importantly -- non-adjacencies) in sparse graph can be a problem... Perhaps we will have to split this function in two copies, one for each class, one day or another. I have been talking with Alexandre Blondin Masse who could need such a feature for Sparse graphs :-)

You almost never are :-)

>  * Unit tests for the `cdef` functions `vectors_equal()` and `vectors_inferior()`, and the method `adjacency_sequence()`. These functions/methods are defined using `cdef` and the doctest coverage script don't pick them up in its analysis. However, I still think it's important to provide unit tests for such functions/methods.


Well, if there is anything wrong in these functions your tests will show it, though given their length I wouldn't have thought necessary to add such tests.... Are you doubting Cython itself ? :-)

>  * Amalgamate the methods `induced_subgraph_search()` and `subgraph_search()`. Their definitions are almost identical, except for the keyword `induced`. The combined method is defined to take the boolean keyword `induced` and pass it on to the relevant method.


I was thinking of someone working on induced subgraphs, and not seeing any occurence of this word among the functions.... But he will get interested in subgraph search sooner or later ;-)

I already spent some time over it, and agreed with what I saw.... Considering its length, I may do this once or twice again before setting it to "positive review". and... Thank you again :-)
