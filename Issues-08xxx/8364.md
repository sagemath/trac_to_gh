How about we specify the solver options as a solver_options dictionary, instead of just blindly passing on whatever is passed into the function on to the solver?  For example:

```
def feedback_edge_set(self,value_only=False, solver_options=dict()): 

   ...
   p.solve(**solver_options)

```

This seems a bit cleaner to me.

Hello !!!!

Well, it is indeed cleaner, but it would give longer lines... Well, the only two options I like to tune through this patch are "solver" or "log". Most of the time, you just want your function to give you more output than usual, and for the moment you can do it like this :

```
graphs.PetersenGraph.matching(log=1)
```

If you want to change the solver you use, it gives 

```
graphs.PetersenGraph.matching(solver="GLPK")
```

I agree your version would be cleaner, but it would mean that getting more output has to be said like this :

```
graphs.PetersenGraph.matching(solver_options = {"log" : 1})
```

Which begins to be quite long... Well, I'm just giving you my idea of it. It you still want me to change it to solver_options, I'll do it immediately, as it is indeed cleaner :-)

Replying to [@jasongrout](#comment%3A6):
> How about we specify the solver options as a solver_options dictionary, instead of just blindly passing on whatever is passed into the function on to the solver?

Nice idea, but regarding the scip solver this doesn't work. It has another way of specifying it's parameters:

```
s = scip.solver()
s.categoryX['keyY'].paramZ = value
```

see here [http://code.google.com/p/python-zibopt/source/browse/trunk/src/zibopt/scip.py#251](http://code.google.com/p/python-zibopt/source/browse/trunk/src/zibopt/scip.py#251)

So, if you want to specify solver parameters, you would need a mechanism where the users instantiates the solver class in an object, configures it, and then passes it on inside the solve method! i.e. `solve(instance=s)` and the code in this patch then uses that `s` instead of instantiating its own solver.

I like this patch.  Two comments:

Applying to 4.4.2.alpha0 gives:

```

```

Second: about half of the docstrings for the solver option seem to be missing words.  I like the solver option docstring that is given for feedback_vertex_set the best.

With those two changes, this should be an easy, quick review.

Changes in reviewer patch include:

* Some consistency along the lines of [PEP 008](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* Some documentation fixes.
* Sphinx fixes to get LaTeX markups processed and displayed on the reference manual.
* Cross reference classes and methods.

Some issues:

* In `graphs/generic_graph.py`, for the method `dominating_set()`, the following change was made:

 ```

          if value_only:

              return [v for v in g.vertices() if b[v]==1]
  
 ```
 And yet from thereon, "obj" isn't used at all. I have changed that to

 ```
 p.solve(solver=solver, log=verbose)
 ```
* Remove a redundant import in `graphs/graph.py` in the method `minor()`:

 ```
    from sage.sets.set import Set
	rs_dict = {}
        for h in H:
            rs_dict[h] = [v for v in self if rs[h][v]==1]

	return rs_dict
 ```
 The class `Set` is imported there, but is never used from thereon within the method.
 
In short, my reviewer patch is about making the documentation added by ncohen consistent. Anyone care for a final review?
