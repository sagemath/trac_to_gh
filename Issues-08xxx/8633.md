Try this in the notebook with the "Typeset" box checked:

```
random_matrix(ZZ, 5, 5).eigenvalues()
```
You will see a box saying "Unknown control sequence '\texttt'".  The attached patch fixes this by replacing "\texttt" with "\hbox" before processing the LaTeX string with jsMath.

This was reported on [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/b35dc4f890f48677?tvc=2).

Works for me (I had another case of \texttt - thank you for providing such a timely patch!) and for the given code.

Is it ready for review? The patch does not add any doctests, but I am not sure if it is possible to test such an issue in doctests. At least it does not break any existing ones.

I get the same problem on 4.4.2 with

```
html.table([random_matrix(ZZ, 5, 5).eigenvalues()])
```

even though the example in this ticket does work.

I think that the two calls to `latex` in sage/misc/html.py need to be changed from

```
latex(XXX)
```
to 

```
latex(XXX).replace('\\texttt','\\hbox')
```
Open another ticket, cc me, and post a patch.
