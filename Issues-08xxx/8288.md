The goal of this patch is to include breadth enumeration method for SearchForest, categorify SearchForest and make it very simple for inherit from it.

Add an example of Parent which inherit from SearchForest should be also fine.

Note to the buildbot / release manager:
apply trac_8288_search_forest_depth_and_breath_improvement-nb.patch

<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

Discussed on trac: there is an algorithmic problem:
Here is my tests example:

```
    I = SearchForest([[3]], lambda l: (l+[i] for i in range(l[-1])))
```
Do you have an easy father function for this tree ?
Yes : `lambda l -> l[:-1]`
It simply generate strictly decreasing lists starting with 3.
For me a call to

```
    list(I.element_of_depth_iterator(2, "Children"))
```
raise a `StopIteration` ...
Whereas:

```
    sage: list(I.element_of_depth_iterator(2))
    [[3, 1, 0], [3, 2, 0], [3, 2, 1]]
```

Don't use the keyword "method" to specify the algorithm to be used. Instead use "algorithm". See #6094 and #7971 for two attempts to get rid of using "method" for specifying the algorithm to be used. My reviewer patch makes this change to your implementation.



For any argument that can take more than one value, provide all the possible values. For example, if possible, list all the possible values for the argument "algorithm".



There is a slight bug in the method `search_forest_iterator()`. If `method="depth"`, then we would use depth-first search. But to get `search_forest_iterator()` to use breadth-first search, we could assign any value to the keyword `method`:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.backtrack import search_forest_iterator
sage: list(search_forest_iterator([[]], lambda l: [l+[0], l+[1]] if len(l) < 3 else [], method="breadth"))
[[], [0], [1], [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
sage: list(search_forest_iterator([[]], lambda l: [l+[0], l+[1]] if len(l) < 3 else [], method=None))
[[], [0], [1], [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
sage: list(search_forest_iterator([[]], lambda l: [l+[0], l+[1]] if len(l) < 3 else [], method="some sanity"))
[[], [0], [1], [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
```

To remedy this bug, we could explicitly test for "breadth" and "depth" and set the value `position` accordingly. For any other value assigned to `algorithm`, we raise an exception. The reviewer patch implements this fix.



There is a slight bug in the method `element_of_depth_iterator()`. From your example given for that method, we can do this:

```
sage: father = lambda t: (t[0]-1,0) if t[1] == 0 else (t[0],t[1]-1)
sage: I = SearchForest([(0,0)], lambda l: [(l[0]+1, l[1]), (l[0], 1)] if l[1] == 0 else [(l[0], l[1]+1)], father=father)
sage: list(I.element_of_depth_iterator(10, method="father"))
[(10, 0), (9, 1), (8, 2), (7, 3), (6, 4), (5, 5), (4, 6), (3, 7), (2, 8), (1, 9), (0, 10)]
```

But then, we could assign the keyword `method` with any value and get the same result as above:

```
sage: father = lambda t: (t[0]-1,0) if t[1] == 0 else (t[0],t[1]-1)
sage: I = SearchForest([(0,0)], lambda l: [(l[0]+1, l[1]), (l[0], 1)] if l[1] == 0 else [(l[0], l[1]+1)], father=father)
sage: list(I.element_of_depth_iterator(10, method="mother"))
[(10, 0), (9, 1), (8, 2), (7, 3), (6, 4), (5, 5), (4, 6), (3, 7), (2, 8), (1, 9), (0, 10)]
sage: list(I.element_of_depth_iterator(10, method="grandma"))
[(10, 0), (9, 1), (8, 2), (7, 3), (6, 4), (5, 5), (4, 6), (3, 7), (2, 8), (1, 9), (0, 10)]
sage: list(I.element_of_depth_iterator(10, method="abc"))
[(10, 0), (9, 1), (8, 2), (7, 3), (6, 4), (5, 5), (4, 6), (3, 7), (2, 8), (1, 9), (0, 10)]
```

One way to fix this is to make `full_generation` into a boolean keyword. If `full_generation=True`, the search starts from the root and generate all elements until the given depth is reached. If `full_generation=False`, the search algorithm makes use of the `father` and `next_brother` methods. My reviewer patch makes this change.




Other general remarks:

* Whenever possible, avoid going over 79 characters per line.
* When testing for `None`, don't use "!=". Instead use "is not", which is much faster than "!=". The same remark applies when testing for equality of an object with `None`.
* For the method `first_element_of_depth()`, I don't understand what is the purpose of the keyword "father_with_depth". You need to document that keyword.
* Some stylistic clean-ups in accordance with [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

I have provided a reviewer patch that implements some changes on top of nborie's patch. Someone needs to review the technical aspect of the features implemented by nborie's patch.

<div id="comment:11" align="right">Comment 11</div>

Hi Nicolas,

I'm currently using search forest and I run into some troubles... I also want
to suggest some improvements in the code:

- please define method `_repr_` (Sage way) rather than `__repr__`
  (Python's way).

- when you need to link a class in the same file you don't have to give the
  full path for exampe <code>:class:\`SearchForest\`</code> is sufficient compared to
  <code>:class:\`~sage.combinat.backtrack.SearchForest\`</code>

- please make sure and **document** that a common intended use of
  `SearchForest` is to inherit from it, calling only
  `Parent.__init__` and overload the methods 
  `roots, children, post_process` rather than passing them to the constructors. 
  Please make sure to specify their result type (iterable vs. iterator).
  By the way, should'nt those methods be private methods (eg: `_roots`
  vs. `roots`. I don't expect the user to call them in my use-case.

Thanks for all this ! I'm using it...

Florent
