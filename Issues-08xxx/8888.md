Hi Florent,

I've tried to apply this patch to a clean sage-4.4.1, and I'm getting strange behavior.  After applying your patch, the entire code for the `quotient` method in `partition.py` (after the docstring) looks like this:

```
        p = self
        #Normalize the length
        remainder = len(p) % length
        part = p[:] + [0]*(length-remainder)
```

The rest is just gone, and obviously this causes doctest failures.  Looking at the patch file, I don't understand why this should happen.  It looks fine!  But I can't approve with this behavior.  Can you rebase?  Or explain what might be going on?
