When python is configured, it is showing the following warning:

```
configure: WARNING: unrecognized options: --without-libpng
```

It would be good if when people update packages, they actually check things like the options. R recently had --without-iconv, despite that was no longer an option. 





**Merged:** sage-4.3.4.alpha1

If the issues at #7867 can be solved by some updates to python, which may be the case, then I'll fix this as part of the fixes for #7867. Otherwise, it will have to wait for someone else to do it. 

I'm dropping the priority of this, as the warning is harmless.
