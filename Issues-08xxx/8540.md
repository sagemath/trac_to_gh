```
sage: a = 3/4
sage: b = a^(-1/2)
sage: b^2
12
```

But it should be 4/3.

This serious bug is present in sage-4.0, but not in 3.4.2, so it was caused in the switch to Pynac.

Even earlier than the square:

During the push for the switch, some code was added to simplify these cases (where the base and exponent are rational, but the result is not exact) further than what ginac can do. See `sage.rings.rational.rational_power_parts` for example.

I am taking a look at this right now, but I don't have much time, so I can't promise any results.
