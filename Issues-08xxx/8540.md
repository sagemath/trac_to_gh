```
sage: a = 3/4
sage: b = a^(-1/2)
sage: b^2
12
```

But it should be 4/3.

During the push for the switch, some code was added to simplify these cases (where the base and exponent are rational, but the result is not exact) further than what ginac can do. See `sage.rings.rational.rational_power_parts` for example.

I am taking a look at this right now, but I don't have much time, so I can't promise any results.
