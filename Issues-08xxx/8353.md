When dealing with 2d word paths, it is very useful to know their height and their width.

In particular, one can compute a bounding box for a better displaying. The aim of this small ticket is to add those two functionalities.

By the way, while testing it, I noticed a strange behavior:

```
sage: Paths = WordPaths('abcABC')
sage: p = Paths('acABC')
sage: points = list(p.points())
sage: points
[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1/2, 1/2*sqrt3), (-1/2, 1/2*sqrt3), (-1, 0), (-1/2, -1/2*sqrt3)]
sage: y_coords = map(lambda (_,y):y, points)
sage: y_coords
[0, 0, 1/2*sqrt3, 1/2*sqrt3, 0, -1/2*sqrt3]
sage: max(y_coords)
-1/2*sqrt3
```

Shouldn't `1/2*sqrt3` be the highest element ? This doesn't make sense.
