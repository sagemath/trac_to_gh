There is currently no way to have an empty set which pass the category tests. Indeed the current specification says: for any set `S` there must be a method `S.an_element()` which returns an actual element `x` such that `x in S`:

```
an_element = self.an_element()
tester.assert_(an_element in self, "self.an_element() is not in self")
```
This tests should allows `S` to be empty.

To solve this issue I added a new exception called `EmptySetError` which should be raised in such cases. I fixed the tests suite of the category `Sets()` accordingly and expanded the test in some places where this could be done before.

Depends on #8519
