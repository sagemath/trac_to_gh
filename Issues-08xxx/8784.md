It is stupid that it is this easy to accidentally destabilize and segfault Sage.    Also, having a function "quit_sage()" available at the sage: prompt by default that does not quit sage, is dumb. 

```

| Sage Version 4.4, Release Date: 2010-04-24                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |

The fix is to rename quit_sage() somehow and change *all* code that calls it.

Now all of the cleanup happens automatically and `quit_sage()` is a no-op:

```
sage: quit_sage()

We have a complaint about ipython processes staying alive in a patchbot.
https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/sage-devel/20220717160807.GA13671%40metelu.net

Could it be due to this ticket, perhaps the change for `src/sage/repl/ipython_extension.py`
was an overkill?
