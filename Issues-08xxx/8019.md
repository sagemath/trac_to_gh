The following code should illustrate this, see picture below, everything gets scaled for no reason.

```
graph = circle((0,0),20)
graph.set_aspect_ratio(1)
graph2 = graphics_array([[graph]*4]*4)
graph2.show()
```

The real reason is that axes_pad<>0 will affect the same picture every time it's rendered (to be saved or displayed), and change its dimensions by 2% each time by default. I can understand the need for axes_pad, but don't think this should happen:

```
graph = circle((0,0),20)
graph.show()
print graph.get_axes_range()
graph.save('test.png')
graph.save('test.png')
graph.save('test.png')
graph.save('test.png')
graph.save('test.png')
print graph.get_axes_range()
graph.show()
```
and compare with

```
graph = circle((0,0),20)
graph.show(axes_pad=0)
print graph.get_axes_range()
graph.save('test.png',axes_pad=0)
graph.save('test.png',axes_pad=0)
graph.save('test.png',axes_pad=0)
graph.save('test.png',axes_pad=0)
graph.save('test.png',axes_pad=0)
print graph.get_axes_range()
graph.show(axes_pad=0)
```
