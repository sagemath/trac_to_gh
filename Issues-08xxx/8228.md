This is bad:

```python
sage: P.<x,y> = Zmod(10)[]; P(0)
0
sage: P.<x,y> = Zmod(2^10)[]; P(0)

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).

Since #8059 is merged with the new Singular package, this works:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = Zmod(10)[]; P(0)
0
sage: P.<x,y> = Zmod(2^10)[]; P(0)
0
