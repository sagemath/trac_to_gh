Over maximal orders O in number fields K the elementary divisors provide a complete system of invariants for in matrices GL_n(K). Here the elementary divisors are the ideals e_i = d_i / d_{i-1} where d_i are the determinantal divisors. This patch provides the possibility to compute these elementary divisors.

Keywords: **elementary divisors**

Acutally no. The statement "raise" raises the last exception one has cached and this is exactly what I want. If the SMNF can't be obtainted by means of the algorithm implemented at the moment - and this is indicated by an ArithmeticError - I check whether I can do it diffently. If not the original ArithmeticError with its trac back is the most useful error message.
Do you think diffently about this?

The best would be to check whether a ring is a PID or not. Then decide on the algorithm to use. But this isn't even implemented for ZZ, so no chance to do it.
