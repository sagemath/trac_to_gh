It would be great to have an interface to GAP3 so that one can use GAP3 packages that have not been ported to GAP4. Of particular interest are the packages (sage-devel occasionally receives questions about integrating these packages):

* CHEVIE: Finite reflection groups and their root systems, braid groups, Iwahori-Hecke algebras, and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. 
* Specht: Specht: Decomposition matrices for the Hecke algebras of type A.

For a list of other GAP3 packages, check out

  [http://www.gap-system.org/Gap3/Packages3/packages.html](http://www.gap-system.org/Gap3/Packages3/packages.html)

To use the interface implemented in this ticket, you need to have GAP3 installed on your machine.

To this end, you can use Jean Michel's GAP3 distribution
http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~jmichel/gap3/gap3-jm4.tar.gz
(instructions: http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~jmichel/gap3), which
includes a bunch of GAP3 packages (including Chevie, Specht, ...),

A simple alternative is to install the following Sage package
based on a slightly outdated version of the above.

```
    sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/gap3-jm2.spkg
```

Here are two patches. Make sure you apply the correct patch for you version of Sage.

Of course, you need to have GAP3 installed in order to use GAP3, and all doctests are marked optional.

The interface behaves very much like the GAP4 interface: tab completion works, one can access the GAP3 help documentation, etc.

Notes for the reviewer:

1. To run the GAP3 doctests:

    ```
    sage -testall -only-optional=gap3
   ```

2. I refactored the GAP4 interface code; basically, I separated the `Gap` class into two new classes `Gap_generic` and `GapElement_generic`.

3. I've tested that the patches apply cleanly and all doctests pass on the following systems:

   a. sage.math
   b. Ubuntu 9.10, amd 64

If you're a GAP3 user interested in trying the new interface, then you can follow the instructions below to patch your version of Sage. These instructions are just a summary of the procedure described at: [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#reviewing-a-patch](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#reviewing-a-patch). (Alternatively, your can just install all the sage-combinat patches using the command `"sage -combinat install"`, which includes the GAP3 interface patch.)

1. First, create a branch of your Sage library (you can later switch between the main branch and the new gap3 branch with the commands `"sage -b main"` and `"sage -b gap3"`):

   ```
sage -clone gap3
```

2. Next, start Sage and run one of the following commands, depending on the version of Sage you have installed.

* For sage-4.3.2:

```
sage: hg_sage.apply("http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/8380/gap3_interface_v4.3.2.patch")
```

* For sage-4.3.3:

```
sage: hg_sage.apply("http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/8380/gap3_interface_v4.3.3.patch")
```

3. Finally, exist Sage and run the following command.

```
sage -br
```

You should be up and running now.

I've also generated the documentation and posted it as a PDF file. You can find it in the "Attachments" section.

I tested attachment:gap3_interface_v4.3.3.patch on Sage-4.4.1 with gap3 installed using [Frank Luebeck's distribution](http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de:8001/~Frank.Luebeck/gap/GAP3/index.html). The patch applies cleanly, but there are many doctest failures. This could be due to the fact that optional packages like chevie are not included in this distribution of GAP3.

Here is my review for the patch:
* There is no doctest for the change in `sage/interfaces/expect.py`
* The method `load_package()` in `sage/interfaces/gap.py` doesn't have a doctest. I understand that this is copied as is from the old version, but if there is any package that is included by default in the GAP4 distribution (or one which we include in our package), we should add a test.
* In `sage/interfaces/gap3.py`
  * Is the bug in the pexpect interface mentioned around line 42 reported on trac? Can you mention the ticket number in that comment. Is this specific to the GAP interface?
  * does the GAP3 banner depend on the specific package installed?
  * There are some doctests that depend on chevie, (`RequirePackage('"chevie"')` and `load_package("chevie")`), these should be optional.
  * The docstring for `GAP3Record.__getattr__` ends with " :: " then an empty line. There are many places where there is an empty line at the end of the docstring, or right after.


The optional package for gap3 in[comment:9](#comment%3A9) looks good in general. Maybe the fact that it's binary only can be made more obvious, for example by adding a `bin` to the package name. 

BTW, it's not possible to install the version of GAP3 downloaded from the main web site (http://www.gap-system.org/Gap3/Download3/download.html) easily. I suggest moving the link to Frank Luebeck's distribution to the first place, and putting this option last.

Attachment [gap3_interface_patch2.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket8380/gap3_interface_patch2.patch) by @saliola created at 2010-05-12 03:12:54

I've uploaded my changes in a separate patch to ease the review. Apply the patches in this order:

* attachment:gap3_interface_v4.3.3.patch
* attachment:gap3_interface_patch2.patch


Replying to [burcin](#comment%3A11):

> Here is my review for the patch:
> * There is no doctest for the change in `sage/interfaces/expect.py`


The problem here was that a variable name could be overwritten; before the
patch:

```
sage: x = gap(3)
sage: gap.clear(x.name())
sage: gap.clear(x.name())
sage: x = gap(3); x
3
sage: y = gap(4); y
4
sage: x # this should be 3!
4
```
This is now corrected, and I added the above as a doctest.

>  * The method `load_package()` in `sage/interfaces/gap.py` doesn't have a doctest. I understand that this is copied as is from the old version, but if there is any package that is included by default in the GAP4 distribution (or one which we include in our package), we should add a test.


Neither Sage nor Gap seem to distribute any packages (see the

```
$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/gap-4.4.12/pkg}}} directory). I did, however,
add a test that at least tests that it raises an appropriate exception.

>  * In `sage/interfaces/gap3.py`
>   * Is the bug in the pexpect interface mentioned around line 42 reported on trac? Can you mention the ticket number in that comment. Is this specific to the GAP interface?

Yes, it is #8471. I added the ticket number to the comment, and
cross-referenced that ticket to this one.

It is not specific to the GAP interface. It is an issue with any
{{{Expect}}} instance. See #8471 for details.

>   * does the GAP3 banner depend on the specific package installed?

It shouldn't since the software is so old. Note that when the banners are
printed in the documentation, it is only for illustration purposes. Those
commands are not tested because each spawns a console (which would require
user input to quit).

>   * There are some doctests that depend on chevie, (`RequirePackage('"chevie"')` and `load_package("chevie")`), these should be optional.

I've marked them as {{{#optional - gap3chevie}}} instead of just
{{{#optional - gap3}}}.

>   * The docstring for `GAP3Record.__getattr__` ends with " :: " then an empty line. There are many places where there is an empty line at the end of the docstring, or right after.

Corrected.

> The optional package for gap3 in comment:9 looks good in general. Maybe the fact that it's binary only can be made more obvious, for example by adding a `bin` to the package name. 

The discussion surrounding spkgs should be moved to #8906, which proposes
a source gap3 spkg instead.

> BTW, it's not possible to install the version of GAP3 downloaded from the main web site (http://www.gap-system.org/Gap3/Download3/download.html) easily. I suggest moving the link to Frank Luebeck's distribution to the first place, and putting this option last.

Done. I listed ticket #8906 as the first option (it should be changed when
that ticket is resolved).

The bit of code in `expect.py` I changed was meant to fix what I thought was a small bug. Unfortunately, it seems this bug runs deeper than I originally thought (I still haven't completely tracked down the problem), so instead I created a new ticket to track this particular issue: #9183. (Fixing this bug is independent of the gap3 interface code.)

I have attached another patch that reverts the changes to `expect.py`.

I agree that the expect bug shouldn't hold this patch back. I'm changing this to a positive review.

It would be great if this can be merged for the next release. AFAIK, the upcoming combinat meeting will have some CHEVIE developers.
