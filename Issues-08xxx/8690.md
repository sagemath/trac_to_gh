In #329, a method for adding checksums to spkg files to verify their integrity is proposed; if we implement that method, it would be very useful to have `sage -pkg` automatically add those checksums. Making `sage -pkg`  the canonical way to produce a spkg file will be convenient for users and allow us to guarantee that the spkg conforms to our standards.

This ticket depends on #8679 and #329.
