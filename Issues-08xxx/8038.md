When a user is signing up for a notebook account, the email address field does not accept + in the address, even though such addresses are valid -- Gmail, for example, does this. If your account is foo@gmail.com, then foo+whatever@gmail.com automatically gets delivered to you.

Testing with Gmail, things like "foo++", "foo+bar+" and so on all are accepted. We need to update the regular expression in sagenb/notebook/twist.py.

Patch up, please review. I tested this in a separate script, as I don't know how to run doctests for the notebook. But it's just running a regexp test on a string, so It Should Work.

One issue is that we are still rejecting a lot of valid email addresses: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696#section-3. But we are accepting some invalid addresses, since we're not checking for maximum length, or two consective periods, or beginning with a period, or...

Personally, coming up a regexp that exactly captures the RFC's requirements is a rabbit hole I don't want to go down, but if anyone else wants to try, feel free to upload a patch!

[These](http://www.dominicsayers.com/isemail/) [sites](http://fightingforalostcause.net/misc/2006/compare-email-regex.php) have test results for several increasingly complex validators.

It seems the main remaining sources of false negatives in `is_valid_email` are

* Other special characters not in quoted strings: `!def!xyz%abc@example.com`

* IP addresses:  `first.last@[12.34.56.78]`, `first.last@[IPv6:1111:2222:3333::4444:5555:6666]`

* Quoted strings:  `first."mid\dle"."l@st name"@example.com`  (`\` can escape anything but must escape something)

* Top-level-domains (TLDs) of any length:  `+@b.c`

* Comments, possibly nested:  `a(a(b(c],d(e(f],],g],h(i],j],@example.com`

You'd think such a thing would exist. It would also be nice to have a corpus of validation tests -- you download a pair of big lists (one list of crazy but valid addresses, another of plausible but invalid addresses). But anyway.

Your regexp seems pretty good. I'm a bit confused about

```
%(unquoted)s+(\.%(unquoted)s+)*
```
though. Doesn't that simply match one or more "unquoted" characters? The first bit matches one or more, then the second bit matches zero or more -- so altogether that's one or more. Right? I'm not a regexp wizard by any means.

Also, the RFC (3696) says that the local part has a maximum of 64 characters and the domain part a max of 255 characters, so maybe we could toss in something like this:

```
if re_valid_email.match(email) is None:
    return False
lengths = map(len, email.split('@'))
if lengths[0] > 64 or lengths[1] > 255:
    return False
return True
```
Thoughts?

Oh, and thanks for telling me how to doctest notebook stuff.

I'm far from regexpert, myself.  I think the first part, `%(unquoted)s+`, matches one or more unquoted characters (e.g., `$uper`), but the rest of the line above matches zero or more blocks (e.g., `.duper+foo`), each of which begins with a period and ends with a string of at least one unquoted character.

If we later enable quoted local-parts (e.g., `"foo@bar"@barfoo.com`), we'll need to modify this test.  But for now, we simply reject them, so it's no problem.

RFC 3696's [erratum 1003](http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=3696) and [RFC 5321](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-4.5.3.1) also give a *total* upper bound of 256 characters (the `sup` may be 254).  What if we just check that `7 < len(email) < 255`?  I assume we can tolerate the [few] false positives that get through --- the confirmation message would not arrive at a truly invalid address.

Thanks for the explanation about the period ("`\.`"). I see that you are preventing two periods in a row.

Your changes look good. I applied the most recent patch and it passes doctests. Somehow I feel like a reviewer now, although I filed this ticket, so I think we need someone else to review it!

There has been discussion before about having a user also be able to specify a pattern for email addresses (or even just a domain).  Is there any way to incorporate a user-specified regexp for validation as well into this patch?  Maybe a form on the Notebook Settings page (right under the "Require e-mail for account registration") that allows me to put, for example, 

*@drake.edu

as a regexp validation that is run after this validation.  If my validation doesn't pass (i.e., someone doesn't have a drake.edu email address), I don't want the account to register.
