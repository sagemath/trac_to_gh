As reported to sage-nt:

If E is an elliptic curve over K and m is a nonzero integer, then E.multiplication_by_m(m) returns a tuple (X,Y) where X and Y are both in K(x,y) and give the "formula" for the multiplcation-by-m map on E.  Of course, mathematically, X is in K(x), but it is returned with the same parent as Y, namely K(x,y) (i.e. the fraction field of the 2-variable polynomial ring over K).

There is an optional parameter x_only which by default is False, but if True the return value is just X as above, an element of K(x,y) which happens not to involve y.

I propose to change the function so that there is no change when x_only is False (the default), but when it is True the rational function returned would be in K(x) and not in K(x,y);  in this case one would not need to construct any bivariate polynomial rings or fields at all.

Would anyone be unhappy about this?  The only issue which I can see is that if you construct phi to be the multiplcation-by-m isogeny, then phi.rational_maps() is currently of the form (X,Y) as above, so now one can check that

phi.rational_maps()[0] == E.multiplication_by_m(m,True)

while after my proposed change this would be False (I think, unless coercion would magically embed K(x) into K(x,y), which I have not checked).  

Implementation and checking would be very easy.

I have a clone of the git repository and pulled in all the commits on trac (using git pull trac master followed by make), and have a working version (./sage runs ok and shows 5.12.beta2 in the banner).  But ./sage -dev fails (unknown option).  Does that mean that I should do the "manual git" as in Git the Hard Way, using git fetch trac ...?  I can do that, of course, but thought that the scripts made it unnecessary.

Meanwhile I looked at the diff for your commit and looks reasonable, though I would of course want to check it.

My plan now is to merge this branch with the current master, which I think will make it easier to see what has now changed with this ticket.  There are some problems caused by the fact that this branch was forked off the master branch rather along time ago.

Would you like to do that or shall I try?

I cannot rebase, since that is rewriting history and not allowed (by convention) on commits that have been made public (as on this ticket) since there might be people who have taken those commits as a base for something else.  (Clearly not likeliy in this case.)  And whle I can merge the current master, as a way of seeing what changes you have made (by comparing the merged current-master + your changes to the current-master by itself), which helps me see the cumulative effect of what you did, I am not supposed to upload that merged commit back to this ticket.\n\nThis makes it rather complicated for me to something which used to be so simple, i.e. to make some small \"reviewer patch\" additional changes.  I have to first unmerge the current master, then make my edits and a new commit whose parent is the one downloaded from this ticket and push that back up to the ticket.\n\nOf course, that will not be necessary if I find your changes perfect ;)",

It turns out that I am not allowed to (see further discussion on sage-git).  I cannot rebase, since that is rewriting history and not allowed (by convention) on commits that have been made public (as on this ticket) since there might be people who have taken those commits as a base for something else.  (Clearly not likeliy in this case.)  And whle I can merge the current master, as a way of seeing what changes you have made (by comparing the merged current-master + your changes to the current-master by itself), which helps me see the cumulative effect of what you did, I am not supposed to upload that merged commit back to this ticket.

This makes it rather complicated for me to something which used to be so simple, i.e. to make some small "reviewer patch" additional changes.  I have to first unmerge the current master, then make my edits and a new commit whose parent is the one downloaded from this ticket and push that back up to the ticket.

Of course, that will not be necessary if I find your changes perfect ;)

Very sorry, but checking that this works revealed a problem.  The function `multiplication_by_m` calls  `_multiple_x_numerator(m,x)` and the latter caches its results with a cache whose key is just m and not the tuple (m,x), which means that the x in the returned value of `E.multiplication_by_m` is not necessarily the x you defined in the function.  For example:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,1])
sage: x2,y2 = E.multiplication_by_m(2)
sage: x2.parent(), y2.parent()
(Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field,
 Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field)
sage: X2 = E.multiplication_by_m(2, x_only=True)
sage: X2.parent()
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```
where the last parent is wrong, and in the other direction

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,1])
sage: X2 = E.multiplication_by_m(2, x_only=True)
sage: X2.parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: x2,y2 = E.multiplication_by_m(2)
sage: x2.parent(), y2.parent()
(Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field,
 Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field)
```
which is worse!

I will fix this by changing the caching behaviour of the subsidiary function, and see if I can push the new commit onto this ticket.

Done.  Now the output of that example is

Note that the branch name has changed (it was non-standard, my fault).

I have checked that from this branch, "git merge develop" works ok -- since this branched off the tree at around 5.13.beta4 I thought that would be helpful to know, since it means (I think) that merging this branch into develop will also work!  And for good measure I will also rebuild and test everything.

I can confirm that after merging the develop branch and rebuilding, all (long) test pass.

Now the only question is, who gives this a positive review?

I just stumbled upon this while working on #16129.

Replying to [cremona](#comment%3A20):
> **New commits:**
<table><tr><td>[1fec983](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/1fec983)</td><td><code>reviewer's patch, makes sure that the parents are correct even with caching</code></td></tr></table>


If I understand correctly, this is to make sure that the returned elements live in the correct rings. Does this really work the way it is meant to? The `x` in a univariate/bivariate ring can not be distinguished in the cache:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<x> = QQ[]
sage: R(x) == S(x)
True
sage: hash(R(x))==hash(S(x))
True
```

So what actually makes the patch work is this explicit conversion back to the right ring:

```
- mx = self._multiple_x_numerator(m.abs(), x) / self._multiple_x_denominator(m.abs(), x)
+ mx = (x.parent()(self._multiple_x_numerator(m.abs(), x))
+ / x.parent()(self._multiple_x_denominator(m.abs(), x)))
```

In other words, `_multiple_x_numerator/denominator` still return elements in the wrong ring. This is probably acceptable since they are marked as internal methods anyway:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,1])
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: E._multiple_x_numerator(2, x).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: E._multiple_x_numerator(2).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```

Should I fix this in #16129?

What causes actual trouble for me is that `x` has been added to the cache key in `division_polynomial_0`. Why is it necessary there? Is `division_polynomial_0` ever called with a different `x` but the same `cache`?

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,1])

sage: cache = {}
sage: E.division_polynomial_0(1, cache=cache).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field

```

> there are places where instead of getting the polynomial and then substituting a value for x, one can compute the polynomials already evaluated, using the same recursion.

I see. But would you really want to store these in the same `cache` dictionary?

If I understand correctly, the `cache` parameter is needed because you want to compute things for multiple values of `n`. Would it be acceptable if the method accepted a list for `n`? Or is the `cache` keyword used heavily by code outside the sage library?

Great. Thanks for your answers. I will try to implement this in a different way at #16129 then.
