As reported to sage-nt:

If E is an elliptic curve over K and m is a nonzero integer, then E.multiplication_by_m(m) returns a tuple (X,Y) where X and Y are both in K(x,y) and give the "formula" for the multiplcation-by-m map on E.  Of course, mathematically, X is in K(x), but it is returned with the same parent as Y, namely K(x,y) (i.e. the fraction field of the 2-variable polynomial ring over K).

There is an optional parameter x_only which by default is False, but if True the return value is just X as above, an element of K(x,y) which happens not to involve y.

I propose to change the function so that there is no change when x_only is False (the default), but when it is True the rational function returned would be in K(x) and not in K(x,y);  in this case one would not need to construct any bivariate polynomial rings or fields at all.

Would anyone be unhappy about this?  The only issue which I can see is that if you construct phi to be the multiplcation-by-m isogeny, then phi.rational_maps() is currently of the form (X,Y) as above, so now one can check that

phi.rational_maps()[0] == E.multiplication_by_m(m,True)

while after my proposed change this would be False (I think, unless coercion would magically embed K(x) into K(x,y), which I have not checked).  

Implementation and checking would be very easy.

It turns out that I am not allowed to (see further discussion on sage-git).  I cannot rebase, since that is rewriting history and not allowed (by convention) on commits that have been made public (as on this ticket) since there might be people who have taken those commits as a base for something else.

This makes it rather complicated for me to something which used to be so simple, i.e. to make some small "reviewer patch" additional changes.  I have to first unmerge the current master, then make my edits and a new commit whose parent is the one downloaded from this ticket and push that back up to the ticket.

Of course, that will not be necessary if I find your changes perfect ;)

<a id='comment:16'></a>Very sorry, but checking that this works revealed a problem.  The function `multiplication_by_m` calls  `_multiple_x_numerator(m,x)` and the latter caches its results with a cache whose key is just m and not the tuple (m,x), which means that the x in the returned value of `E.multiplication_by_m` is not necessarily the x you defined in the function.  For example:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,1])
sage: x2,y2 = E.multiplication_by_m(2)
sage: x2.parent(), y2.parent()
(Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field,
 Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field)
sage: X2 = E.multiplication_by_m(2, x_only=True)
sage: X2.parent()
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```
where the last parent is wrong, and in the other direction

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,1])
sage: X2 = E.multiplication_by_m(2, x_only=True)
sage: X2.parent()
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: x2,y2 = E.multiplication_by_m(2)
sage: x2.parent(), y2.parent()
(Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field,
 Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field)
```
which is worse!

I will fix this by changing the caching behaviour of the subsidiary function, and see if I can push the new commit onto this ticket.

If I understand correctly, this is to make sure that the returned elements live in the correct rings. Does this really work the way it is meant to? The `x` in a univariate/bivariate ring can not be distinguished in the cache:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<x> = QQ[]
sage: R(x) == S(x)
True
sage: hash(R(x))==hash(S(x))
True
```

So what actually makes the patch work is this explicit conversion back to the right ring:

```
- mx = self._multiple_x_numerator(m.abs(), x) / self._multiple_x_denominator(m.abs(), x)
+ mx = (x.parent()(self._multiple_x_numerator(m.abs(), x))
+ / x.parent()(self._multiple_x_denominator(m.abs(), x)))
```

In other words, `_multiple_x_numerator/denominator` still return elements in the wrong ring. This is probably acceptable since they are marked as internal methods anyway:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,1])
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: E._multiple_x_numerator(2, x).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: E._multiple_x_numerator(2).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```

Should I fix this in #16129?

What causes actual trouble for me is that `x` has been added to the cache key in `division_polynomial_0`. Why is it necessary there? Is `division_polynomial_0` ever called with a different `x` but the same `cache`?

But this does not seem to work if you pass in the same `cache` dictionary. An `x` from different polynomial rings has the same hash value, i.e., you get a result in the wrong ring.

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,1])

```

> there are places where instead of getting the polynomial and then substituting a value for x, one can compute the polynomials already evaluated, using the same recursion.

I see. But would you really want to store these in the same `cache` dictionary?

If I understand correctly, the `cache` parameter is needed because you want to compute things for multiple values of `n`. Would it be acceptable if the method accepted a list for `n`? Or is the `cache` keyword used heavily by code outside the sage library?

No, absolutely not.  The cache variable is not intended for use by users at all.  (I did not design this!).  It is for internal use so that the function for one value of n can re-use its values for smaller n and the same x.  I'm sure there are are other (and possibly better) ways to do it.

Thanks for your answers. I will try to implement this in a different way at #16129 then.",

Great. Thanks for your answers. I will try to implement this in a different way at #16129 then.
