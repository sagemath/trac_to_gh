http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/interfaces.html
says:

"Maxima is included with Sage, as is clisp (a version of the Lisp language)."

Clearly this is wrong. 

It would be worth going over the web site with a recursive grep, to see if there are any other mentions of clisp or Vmware, as I believe there are a few points where VMware is mentioned, despite the fact there is a shift to VirtualBox.

The patch [trac_8328-tutorial.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8328/trac_8328-tutorial.patch.gz) only fixes that one issue reported in the ticket description. I did a recursive grep over all `.rst` files in the following documentation, looking for occurrences of "clisp" and "VMware", and other variations in spelling:

* A Tour of Sage
* Bordeaux 2008 lecture
* Constructions Document
* Developer's Guide
* Installation Guide
* Numerical Guide
* Tutorial

And I only found the occurrences as fixed in the patch.

Anyway, that looks good to me.
