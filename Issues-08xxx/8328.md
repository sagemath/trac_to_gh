http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/interfaces.html
says:

"Maxima is included with Sage, as is clisp (a version of the Lisp language)."

Clearly this is wrong. 

It would be worth going over the web site with a recursive grep, to see if there are any other mentions of clisp or Vmware, as I believe there are a few points where VMware is mentioned, despite the fact there is a shift to VirtualBox.
