This was reported by Francois Maltey:

```
sage: map (type, [float(1.2), N(1.2), N(1.2,digits=50)])

                           [<type 'float'>,
                            <type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral'>,
                            <type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>]
```
Why does the second one return `RealLiteral` and the 3rd one
`RealNumber`?

Side question: how does one test if the type of an object 
corresponds to a real number, like for example:

```
type (345) is Integer, type([1,2,3]) is list, type (2/3) is Rational
```

The docstring for RealLiteral indicates what is going on: "RealLiterals are created in preparsing and provide a way to allow casting into higher precision rings."  So (I think) the digits=50 is casting the RealLiteral 1.2 object into a RealNumber with the desired precision.  RealLiteral just looks like a trivial subclass of RealNumber to just aid in parsing.

side question: when you say type, do you mean the computer science type (i.e., the RealNumber or RealLiteral class)?  Or are you just checking if you have a floating point number (i.e., do you want a python floating point number to also return True?)

Jason,

> The docstring for RealLiteral? indicates...

how do you get this docstring?

```
sage: RealLiteral?
Object `RealLiteral` not found.
```

Anyway, I find it quite disturbing from the user point-of-view to see this "preparsing" side-effect:

```
sage: type(n(1.2,prec=52))
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
sage: type(n(1.2,prec=53))
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral'>
sage: type(n(1.2,prec=54))
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
```

> side question: ...

I forwarded the question to Francois Maltey. I guess he wants to check for a f-p number, and 
probably a python float should also return True.

I guess the underlying question is: why does the preparser have a special type (i.e., subclass) of RealNumber that it creates, instead of just creating a RealNumber?  That question probably deserves a post to sage-devel, since it's not immediately clear from the documentation.

I find `isinstance(1.2, sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber)` not satisfying for three reasons:

(1) it is much too long, compare say `isinstance(17, Integer)`

(2) it explicitly refers to the underlying implementation and the MPFR component: this should be
    hidden from the user

(3) that underlying implementation may change in the future, which will break some code using
    `sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber`

Thus we need a shortcut like "Integer" for real numbers.

I agree. 

We used to have `is_RealNumber` but that was deprecated. I usually just do something like `x in RR`, unless I really need to know I have exactly a real number (e.g. I'm trying to reach inside and grab it's mpfr_t to initialize myself) in which case the implementation matters.

I propose to close this ticket, since it seems that `x in RR` solves the original question. I thus put it as "needs review".
