This was reported by Francois Maltey:

```
sage: map (type, [float(1.2), N(1.2), N(1.2,digits=50)])

                           [<type 'float'>,
                            <type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral'>,
                            <type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>]
```
Why does the second one return `RealLiteral` and the 3rd one
`RealNumber`?

Side question: how does one test if the type of an object 
corresponds to a real number, like for example:

```
type (345) is Integer, type([1,2,3]) is list, type (2/3) is Rational
```

Jason,

> The docstring for RealLiteral? indicates...


how do you get this docstring?

```
sage: RealLiteral?
Object `RealLiteral` not found.
```

Anyway, I find it quite disturbing from the user point-of-view to see this "preparsing" side-effect:

```
sage: type(n(1.2,prec=52))
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
sage: type(n(1.2,prec=53))
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral'>
sage: type(n(1.2,prec=54))
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
```

> side question: ...


I forwarded the question to Francois Maltey. I guess he wants to check for a f-p number, and 
probably a python float should also return True.

I was browsing the source.  Since RealLiteral is not imported to the global namespace (i.e., it appears to be only a preparser thing), you can't get the docstring just by typing RealLiteral?.  For me, it seems like I can't even get the docstring with the full namespace path.  Can you try `sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral?`

I guess the underlying question is: why does the preparser have a special type (i.e., subclass) of RealNumber that it creates, instead of just creating a RealNumber?  That question probably deserves a post to sage-devel, since it's not immediately clear from the documentation.

<a id='comment:14'></a>
I find `isinstance(1.2, sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber)` not satisfying for three reasons:

(1) it is much too long, compare say `isinstance(17, Integer)`

(2) it explicitly refers to the underlying implementation and the MPFR component: this should be
    hidden from the user

(3) that underlying implementation may change in the future, which will break some code using
    `sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber`

Thus we need a shortcut like "Integer" for real numbers.
