It would be great for those of us who have installed Sage to be able
to double click on these files and have sage open them in the
notebook.

Suporting a command on the likes of:

```
sage -notebook /path/to/worksheet.sws
```

would be a very good step in this direction.

No patches need to be applied.  There is an [upstream pull request on github](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/31), merged in #13121.

Syntax is 

```
sage -notebook upload="/path/to/worksheet.sws"
```

The changes to extcode (specifically for the Mac app) have been moved to #11026.

Depends on #13121

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.**

Reviewer: **Karl-Dieter Crisman, Ivan Andrus**

Component: **notebook**

But I can imagine people definitely wanting to upload an sws file to a Sage instance running only in their browser, i.e. from xyz.sagenb.org.  And we already allow arbitrary code in a Sage notebook instance!  So I don't know whether this would be any less secure than the current situation...

I was probably unclear.

Good point.  I have added documentation for `notebook?`.  Does it need documentation in `sage --advanced` as well?

I don't think that should matter, but I changed it to `'/'` since it makes more sense.  In an earlier version of the patch I think I appended to `startpath` and that's why it was empty.

You are right, there was a bug there.  I need it both places.  Thanks.

> * Looks like file names with spaces have to be escaped with the syntax `./sage -n /path/to/work\ sheet.sws'

Yes.  They have to be escaped for the shell so that they appear as one argument.  That's the same as any argument to `sage -n`.  However, I should point out that the syntax is `sage -n upload="/path/to work sheet.sws"`.  I guess that's why we need documentation, eh? :-)

I think what's happening here is it's starting a new notebook server with /path/to/sws.sws as it's directory or something.  I think that's why it's asking for a password.

That's probably a good idea.  I'll split the extcode off into another ticket.

Yeah, you're right - I found a random new sagenb folder there! 

One thing that happens is that your thing checks whether ANY other Sage server is running with the same folder of worksheets.  But I had a different Sage version already running through my usual !sage_notebook.sagenb, and that caused an error since it didn't have the syntax, I guess.  I don't know that that's a bug.

I think that the extra `/` is causing problems, though.  Here are two things.  The second one works.

```
Downloads/sage-4.7.alpha1/sage -n upload="/Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws"
Downloads/sage-4.7.alpha1/sage -n upload="Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws"
```
I think that one too many `/`s is messing things up.  But the first one IS the full path to the file, so this could be very confusing.  After all,

```
Downloads/sage-4.7.alpha1/sage -n upload="~/Downloads/MAT338Day1-2011.sws"
```
gives 

```
exceptions.IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/~/Downloads/MAT338Day1-2011.sws'
```
So we can't use that syntax for the local directory either.  Clearly the extra `/` isn't helping.

Hmm.  The extra `/` doesn't cause a problem on my machine, but I have noticed differences in URL handling on earlier version of OS X, so I'll go ahead a remove it.

Ivan, is it very hard to catch a certain kind of error?  I get 

```
exceptions.IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws'
```
if I try to upload it with 

```
sage -n upload="Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws"
```
If I try to upload with 

```
sage -n upload="/Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws"
```
I get 

```
The resource /upload_worksheet?url=file:///Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws cannot be found.
```
The same if I do 

```
sage: notebook(upload="...")
```
So here is what works for me.
* old patch, not including first slash.
Here is what doesn't work.
* old patch with a slash.
* new patch with or without slash.
I'm confused.  I really wanted to get this all reviewed but have no idea what is going on, of course.

I don't understand why the old patch would work but not the new one.  If it's not the same problem as above then maybe you could try `sage --notebook upload=`localhost/Users/...`  That also works for me and it may work better on older versions of OS X.
