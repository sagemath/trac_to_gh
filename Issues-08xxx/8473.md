It would be great for those of us who have installed Sage to be able
to double click on these files and have sage open them in the
notebook.

Suporting a command on the likes of:

```
sage -notebook /path/to/worksheet.sws
```

would be a very good step in this direction.

No patches need to be applied.  There is an [upstream pull request on github](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/31), merged in #13121.

Syntax is 

```
sage -notebook upload="/path/to/worksheet.sws"
```

The changes to extcode (specifically for the Mac app) have been moved to #11026.

**Assignee:** @gvol

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

**Reviewer:** Karl-Dieter Crisman, Ivan Andrus

**Dependencies:** #13121

**Resolution:** duplicate

Depends on #693

I have added support for uploading from a file:// url in order to support `sage --notebook upload=FILE.sws`.  The sagenb patch allows this, and the extcode patch adds support to the Mac application.  I had to support file urls so that the upload url could be given as a GET rather than a POST request, and hence be passed to any browser.

The Mac app has a new option to automatically start the server when a sws file is opened.  I'm not sure anyone would ever want to turn this off, so I can remove it if it's not useful.

But I can imagine people definitely wanting to upload an sws file to a Sage instance running only in their browser, i.e. from xyz.sagenb.org.  And we already allow arbitrary code in a Sage notebook instance!  So I don't know whether this would be any less secure than the current situation...

I was probably unclear.  With a file url, it would grab the file from the server rather than the local machine, so it's probably not what people want or expect at all.  e.g. if you try to upload file:///home/iandrus/sage/sws1.sws, this will only work if the machine the server is running on also has a file at /home/iandrus/sage/sws1.sws, and then only if the file is the same.

I can taste it now that you reviewed #693.    This is great stuff, good work.

Okay, needs work because this option isn't documented.  Ordinarily I wouldn't be as strict with NB stuff because so little of it is documented anyway, but I think it is key that `notebook?` tells us what happens.  

I also have a couple questions, but they just indicate my lack of knowledge. 
* I don't understand this change.  More precisely, we now have the default `startpath = ''`, but that isn't the same as `\`.  Will that matter somewhere for non-uploading situations?

```
                        browse_to(old_interface, old_port, old_secure, '/') 
                        browse_to(old_interface, old_port, old_secure, startpath)
```
* You said you added something to fix special character issues, but I don't know where that is, other than the place where you import urllib - but you only do that in the case that someone needs to log in.  Is that the only place it's needed?  This could just be my ignorance speaking.
* Looks like file names with spaces have to be escaped with the syntax `./sage -n /path/to/work\ sheet.sws'
* I also discovered what might be a bug, or maybe it's a feature... trying to upload a file via `./sage -n /path/to/sws.sws` asks for a new password for admin.  That is really annoying, esp. if this is only supposed to work on a local machine anyway!

I'd be inclined to separate the new notebook functionality from adding clickable sws files to the Sage App, for review purposes but also because this would have to be part of a new SageNB package, and it would be nice to separate those things out.  The logistics are already complicated enough for things.

Good point.  I have added documentation for `notebook?`.  Does it need documentation in `sage --advanced` as well?

I don't think that should matter, but I changed it to `'/'` since it makes more sense.  In an earlier version of the patch I think I appended to `startpath` and that's why it was empty.

>  * You said you added something to fix special character issues, but I don't know where that is, other than the place where you import urllib - but you only do that in the case that someone needs to log in.  Is that the only place it's needed?  This could just be my ignorance speaking.


You are right, there was a bug there.  I need it both places.  Thanks.

>  * Looks like file names with spaces have to be escaped with the syntax `./sage -n /path/to/work\ sheet.sws'


Yes.  They have to be escaped for the shell so that they appear as one argument.  That's the same as any argument to `sage -n`.  However, I should point out that the syntax is `sage -n upload="/path/to work sheet.sws"`.  I guess that's why we need documentation, eh? :-)

I think what's happening here is it's starting a new notebook server with /path/to/sws.sws as it's directory or something.  I think that's why it's asking for a password.

That's probably a good idea.  I'll split the extcode off into another ticket.

Yeah, you're right - I found a random new sagenb folder there! 

One thing that happens is that your thing checks whether ANY other Sage server is running with the same folder of worksheets.  But I had a different Sage version already running through my usual !sage_notebook.sagenb, and that caused an error since it didn't have the syntax, I guess.  I don't know that that's a bug.

I think that the extra `/` is causing problems, though.  Here are two things.  The second one works.

```
Downloads/sage-4.7.alpha1/sage -n upload="/Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws"
Downloads/sage-4.7.alpha1/sage -n upload="Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws"
```
I think that one too many `/`s is messing things up.  But the first one IS the full path to the file, so this could be very confusing.  After all,

```
Downloads/sage-4.7.alpha1/sage -n upload="~/Downloads/MAT338Day1-2011.sws"
```
gives 

```
exceptions.IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/~/Downloads/MAT338Day1-2011.sws'
```
So we can't use that syntax for the local directory either.  Clearly the extra `/` isn't helping.

Ivan, is it very hard to catch a certain kind of error?  I get 

```
exceptions.IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws'
```
if I try to upload it with 

```
sage -n upload="Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws"
```
If I try to upload with 

```
sage -n upload="/Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws"
```
I get 

```
The resource /upload_worksheet?url=file:///Users/.../MAT338Day1-2011.sws cannot be found.
```
The same if I do 

```
sage: notebook(upload="...")
```
So here is what works for me.
* old patch, not including first slash.
Here is what doesn't work.
* old patch with a slash.
* new patch with or without slash.
I'm confused.  I really wanted to get this all reviewed but have no idea what is going on, of course.

I don't understand why the old patch would work but not the new one.  If it's not the same problem as above then maybe you could try `sage --notebook upload=`localhost/Users/...`  That also works for me and it may work better on older versions of OS X.

How do I even check if !SAGE_BROWSER is set?  I can't use the command line of that terminal while the server is running, and a new terminal won't have it defined, presumably.

Anyway, this makes me more hopeful this is doable; however, there should not be any connection between having once downloaded the app bundle (perhaps immediately trashed, even) and this syntax working.
