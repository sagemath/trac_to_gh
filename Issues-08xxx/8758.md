Instead of having /js, /css, etc, we should serve all static data files out of /data.  For now this patch just adds /data using `child_data = static.File(DATA)`, where `static.File(path)` is defined in twisted.  It will serve files with the correct MIME type based on extension.

Eventually we should find all the /js and /css paths and change them to /data

At some point in the future we could even implement caching of all the static files easily by subclassing static.File(path), and making everything in /data cached.

Attachment [trac_8758-toplevel-static-url.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket8758/trac_8758-toplevel-static-url.patch) by acleone created at 2010-05-29 22:43:37

The latest patch changes the url to /static/.

I think we should also rename the "data" directory in the sagenb source to "static", and rename the global DATA to STATIC.

DATA is slightly confusing because uploading files to a worksheet also uses a DATA global, eg DATA+'mydatafile.txt'.
