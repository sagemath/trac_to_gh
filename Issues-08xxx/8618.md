It seems that some functions that use morphisms of words do not work for not standard alphabet. This ticket follows the bug found in the fixed_point method (#8595).

**pseudo palindrome**

```
sage: t = WordMorphism({'a1':['a2'], 'a2':['a1']})
sage: W = Words(['a1','a2'])
sage: W(['a1','a2']).is_palindrome(t)
AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last)
...
KeyError: 'a'
```
