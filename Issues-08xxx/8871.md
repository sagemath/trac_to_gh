Add to sage a function finddigits that takes as input a dilation matrix A and a method/type of digit set to find (centered canonical "centered", minimum modulus "minimum", or colinear) and outputs a digit set D (or an appropriate error message if the method chosen is colinear and no colinear digit set exists).

I have sage code in a worksheet to do this, but need to tidy it up and test it.

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
A better method for "centered" would be to find the lattice points in the interior of G (already implemented in Polyhedra?), then find the lattice points in the facets of G that I want to include, then take the union of these sets.

To Do: how to list the facets as Polyhedra, and choose the d (=dimension) of them that I want to include?
