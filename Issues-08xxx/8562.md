After this patch, IntegerModRing's inherit properly from categories:

```
    sage: Z3 = IntegerModRing(3)
    sage: Z3.category()
    Category of commutative rings
    sage: TestSuite(Z3).run(verbose = True)
    running ._test_additive_associativity() . . . pass
    running ._test_an_element() . . . pass
    running ._test_associativity() . . . pass
    running ._test_category() . . . pass
    running ._test_elements() . . . 
      Running the test suite of self.an_element()
      running ._test_category() . . . pass
      running ._test_not_implemented_methods() . . . pass
      running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
      pass
    running ._test_not_implemented_methods() . . . pass
    running ._test_one() . . . pass
    running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
    running ._test_prod() . . . pass
    running ._test_some_elements() . . . pass
    running ._test_zero() . . . pass
```

And this makes the cool features from #7555 work for Z/nZ.

Potential conflict with #8218 (which has higher priority)

This applies, builds and limited testing (prime and composite orders) indicates that it plays nicely with "addition tables" at #7555 which rely heavily on the category framework.  Didn't run tests, but witnessed no problems otherwise.

Good to see how easy it is to insert a new object into the category framework.

I'll come back when the patch is completed.

Thanks for the notice. There is no urgency for that one, so sure, if there is any conflict, #8218 should go first.

Note: I meant David Roe, but any other David is welcome too :-)

Oh: would you agree to take over that patch, and finalize it (or ping me) when it's ripe to get in?

(then I could forget about it).

Here's a rebased patch.  It looks good and all tests pass for me so I'm willing to give it a positive review, but since I made the rebased patch, can someone else (Nicolas, for example) take a look at it also?

Hi John!

Thanks much for rebasing the patch. I looked through the changes, and am happy to give my green light, up to three minor comments:

* Is the convention to use as ticket summary "trac 8562:" or "#8562:"? (I personally prefer the later).
* With the updated patch, sage -coverage complains because of the absence of #indirect doctest for create_object in sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py. Just wanted to check; if this is voluntary, because you consider that this requires better tests, that's all fine with me.
* I like the options `nodates=1` and `showfunc = 1` of hg :-)

I let you set up the positive review as you feel appropriate.

Thanks again,
                          Nicolas

I think either is fine.  I've been using "trac 8562" for a while and have not had any complaints from release managers.

>  * With the updated patch, sage -coverage complains because of the absence of #indirect doctest for create_object in sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py. Just wanted to check; if this is voluntary, because you consider that this requires better tests, that's all fine with me.


This wasn't voluntary, it was an oversight.  I'll fix it.

>  * I like the options `nodates=1` and `showfunc = 1` of hg :-)


Nice, I didn't know about those.
