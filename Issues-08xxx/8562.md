After this patch, IntegerModRing's inherit properly from categories:

```
    sage: Z3 = IntegerModRing(3)
    sage: Z3.category()
    Category of commutative rings
    sage: TestSuite(Z3).run(verbose = True)
    running ._test_additive_associativity() . . . pass
    running ._test_an_element() . . . pass
    running ._test_associativity() . . . pass
    running ._test_category() . . . pass
    running ._test_elements() . . . 
      Running the test suite of self.an_element()
      running ._test_category() . . . pass
      running ._test_not_implemented_methods() . . . pass
      running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
      pass
    running ._test_not_implemented_methods() . . . pass
    running ._test_one() . . . pass
    running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
    running ._test_prod() . . . pass
    running ._test_some_elements() . . . pass
    running ._test_zero() . . . pass
```

And this makes the cool features from #7555 work for Z/nZ.

Potential conflict with #8218 (which has higher priority)

Good to see how easy it is to insert a new object into the category framework.

I'll come back when the patch is completed.

Thanks for the notice. There is no urgency for that one, so sure, if there is any conflict, #8218 should go first.

I looked through the changes, and am happy to give my green light, up to three minor comments:\n\n* Is the convention to use as ticket summary \"trac 8562:\" or \"#8562:\"? (I personally prefer the later).\n* With the updated patch, sage -coverage complains because of the absence of #indirect doctest for create_object in sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py. Just wanted to check; if this is voluntary, because you consider that this requires better tests, that's all fine with me.\n* I like the options `nodates=1` and `showfunc = 1` of hg :-)\n\nI let you set up the positive review as you feel appropriate.\n\nThanks again,\n                          Nicolas",

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hi John!

Thanks much for rebasing the patch. I looked through the changes, and am happy to give my green light, up to three minor comments:

* Is the convention to use as ticket summary "trac 8562:" or "#8562:"? (I personally prefer the later).
* With the updated patch, sage -coverage complains because of the absence of #indirect doctest for create_object in sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py. Just wanted to check; if this is voluntary, because you consider that this requires better tests, that's all fine with me.
* I like the options `nodates=1` and `showfunc = 1` of hg :-)

I let you set up the positive review as you feel appropriate.

Thanks again,
                          Nicolas

I think either is fine.  I've been using "trac 8562" for a while and have not had any complaints from release managers.

This wasn't voluntary, it was an oversight.  I'll fix it.
