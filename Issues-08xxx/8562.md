```
After this patch, IntegerModRing's inherit properly from categories:

```
    sage: Z3 = IntegerModRing(3)
    sage: Z3.category()
    Category of commutative rings
    sage: TestSuite(Z3).run(verbose = True)
    running ._test_additive_associativity() . . . pass
    running ._test_an_element() . . . pass
    running ._test_associativity() . . . pass
    running ._test_category() . . . pass
    running ._test_elements() . . . 
      Running the test suite of self.an_element()
      running ._test_category() . . . pass
      running ._test_not_implemented_methods() . . . pass
      running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
      pass
    running ._test_not_implemented_methods() . . . pass
    running ._test_one() . . . pass
    running ._test_pickling() . . . pass
    running ._test_prod() . . . pass
    running ._test_some_elements() . . . pass
    running ._test_zero() . . . pass
```

And this makes the cool features from #7555 work for Z/nZ.

Potential conflict with #8218 (which has higher priority)

This applies, builds and limited testing (prime and composite orders) indicates that it plays nicely with "addition tables" at #7555 which rely heavily on the category framework.  Didn't run tests, but witnessed no problems otherwise.

Good to see how easy it is to insert a new object into the category framework.

I'll come back when the patch is completed.

Oh: would you agree to take over that patch, and finalize it (or ping me) when it's ripe to get in?

Here's a rebased patch.  It looks good and all tests pass for me so I'm willing to give it a positive review, but since I made the rebased patch, can someone else (Nicolas, for example) take a look at it also?

Hi John!

Thanks much for rebasing the patch. I looked through the changes, and am happy to give my green light, up to three minor comments:

* Is the convention to use as ticket summary "trac 8562:" or "#8562:"? (I personally prefer the later).
* With the updated patch, sage -coverage complains because of the absence of #indirect doctest for create_object in sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py. Just wanted to check; if this is voluntary, because you consider that this requires better tests, that's all fine with me.
* I like the options `nodates=1` and `showfunc = 1` of hg :-)

I let you set up the positive review as you feel appropriate.

Thanks again,
                          Nicolas

I think either is fine.  I've been using "trac 8562" for a while and have not had any complaints from release managers.

> * With the updated patch, sage -coverage complains because of the absence of #indirect doctest for create_object in sage/rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py. Just wanted to check; if this is voluntary, because you consider that this requires better tests, that's all fine with me.

This wasn't voluntary, it was an oversight.  I'll fix it.

> * I like the options `nodates=1` and `showfunc = 1` of hg :-)

Nice, I didn't know about those.
