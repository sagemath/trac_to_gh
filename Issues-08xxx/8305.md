The code in schemes/elliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py largely dates from a time (early 2007) before Sage documentation and doctesting standards had been codified. As a result, its coverage is terrible (26 of 107).

It may also be worth a mild refactor: since it now applies more generally to hyperelliptic curves, it probably should be under schemes/hyperelliptic_curves.

OK, so this ticket should stay on ice until someone (e.g., me) has a chance to review #7926. Besides the documentation, there is also the issue of moving the MW code from elliptic to hyperelliptic where it belongs.
