We provide an upgrade to eclib to patch-level 9, i.e. eclib-20080310.p9.spkg.  This does two things:

1. Fixes a bug (found by Edray Goins and Jamie Wiegandt) in which second descent quartics were not tested for real-solubility, and so sometimes the rank bounds (and related selmer ranks) could be too high.

2. Enhances the data available from the two_descent class so that the rank_bound and selmer_rank are separated, and both available.

The second item necessitated changes to the interface, which are here included in the patch.  In turn, some changes were needed in sage/schemes/elliptic_curve/

Note that this affects #7575.

I fear you uploaded the wrong patch.

I am not certain how to review packages and I will read up on it; but someone might be faster at it.

Sorry -- try this one.

NB After building the new spkg with "sage -f" the patch is required before Sage will work properly.  Even in a clone, you'll be stuck with the new spkg.  I am not sure how to revert back to the old eclib (if you want to).

So I would recommend tetsing this on (say) 4.3.2.alpha1 if you have it, and if all goes wrong you can build 4.3.2.rc0 which is out!
