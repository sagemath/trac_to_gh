## Hardware & associated software

* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)

 == Sage version ==
* 4.3.4.alpha1
* Patch #8509 removing the -o option to grep to allow packages to install. 

 == The problem with the optional libcocoa-0.9930 ==
This looks at least partially, perhaps completely because of a GNUism, as a non-POSIX option to 'ar' is used. Instead, only POSIX options should be used for portability.

<a id='comment:5'></a>I confirm that there are still some "ar -S" in cocoalib 0.99600.

For example in /CoCoALib-0.99600/src/AlgebraicCore/Makefile

GNU doc about `ar S`:

```
S

Do not generate an archive symbol table. This can speed up building a large library 
in several steps. The resulting archive can not be used with the linker. In order 
to build a symbol table, you must omit the S modifier on the last execution of ar, 
or you must run ranlib on the archive.
