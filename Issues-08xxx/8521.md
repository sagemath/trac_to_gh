## Hardware & associated software

* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs
* 2 GB RAM
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (first release of Solaris 10)
* gcc 4.4.3 (uses Sun linker and assembler)

 == Sage version ==
* 4.3.4.alpha1
* Patch #8509 removing the -o option to grep to allow packages to install. 

 == The problem with the optional libcocoa-0.9930 ==
This looks at least partially, perhaps completely because of a GNUism, as a non-POSIX option to 'ar' is used. Instead, only POSIX options should be used for portability.

There are known test failures that should be listed above.
They are literally 'not yet implemented' errors from the
CoCOA library.   I.e., CoCOA releases purposely don't pass
their own test suite at present.
Error libcocoa.a did not build.

I confirm that there are still some "ar -S" in cocoalib 0.99600.

For example in /CoCoALib-0.99600/src/AlgebraicCore/Makefile

GNU doc about `ar S`:

```
S

Do not generate an archive symbol table. This can speed up building a large library 
in several steps. The resulting archive can not be used with the linker. In order 
to build a symbol table, you must omit the S modifier on the last execution of ar, 
or you must run ranlib on the archive.
