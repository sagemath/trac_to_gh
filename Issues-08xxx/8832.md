```
When a scalar has to be coerced to perform the action on a combinatorial free module element, Sage refuse to perform the multiplication. As a consequence, whereas the following is perfectly correct

```
sage: sage: P.<q> = QQ['q']
sage: F = FractionField(P)
sage: V = CombinatorialFreeModule(F, Words())
sage: w = Words()('abc')
sage: sage: ((1+q)/q)*V(w)
((q+1)/q)*B[word: abc]
```
this should also works

```
sage: (1+q)*V(w)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for '*': 'Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Rational Field' and 'Free module generated by Words over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in q over Rational Field'
```
The polynomial `1+q` should be coerced into its fraction field.

After the patch

```
sage: (1+q)*V(w)
(q+1)*B[word: abc]
```
