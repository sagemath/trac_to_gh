At this point contours of a function with poles get too concentrated near the poles. I'm adding a screenshot to exemplify the following code:

```
var('x y x0 y0 q')
R=((x-x0)^2+(y-y0)^2)^(1/2)
field=q/R
q1=field(x0=1,y0=1,q=1)
q2=field(x0=-1,y0=-1,q=-1)
contour_plot(q1+q2,(x,-2,2),(y,-2,2),aspect_ratio=1,fill=False,labels=True,contours=20)
```

I have just attatched two pictures of the intended results. Both are plots of electric potentials the first one comes with a plot_vector_field of the corresponding electric field.

I also attatched a picture of the 3d version, although I mean to make a new ticket for that once this one is finished.
