This is because it chooses only the first of the (usually) two possible lifts of a random x. Computing both is not more expensive, and this avoids the (expensive) exception creation and throwing as well. 

May have a bit of fuzz with #8311.

My patch (after reviewing and testing the whole sage library) has to be applied *instead* of Robert's, though it still has his tag on it (sorry).  It does two things relative to his:
1. I changed a few doctest outputs for the random point tests.  I am worried though, since these changes were not only replacing a point by its negative!  Why?
2. testing with -long revealed a bug in sqrt() for integer-mods: when 0 then the return was 0 and not [0] which broke the new code since it uses the all=true option.  This was *only* revealed in the -long test!  Take note!!

I left this as "needs review" since it needs someone else (e.g. robertwb) to check my change, especially the one at 2. above, and also I would like to hear views on my other remark under 1.
