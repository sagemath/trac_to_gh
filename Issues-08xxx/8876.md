Currently triangular morphisms required to have domain and codomain with the
same index sets. The patch remove this limitation by having
TriangularMorphism accept a new argument `inverse_on_support`. It is
supposed to be a function `r : J |--> I` returning the leading term `i`
from the one of `j = on_basis(i)`. This is used by: `preimage` and
`section`.

I also wrote the methods `co_kernel_projection`, `co_reduced`, and
`_test_triangular`. 

Depend on #8881 and #8742, Apply patch in that order:
