```

The `_evalf_` function defined on line 179 of `sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py` calls the gsl `numerical_integral()` function and ignores the precision.

We should raise a `NotImplementedError` for high precision, or find a way to do arbitrary precision numerical integration.

I think I have the solution for this trac with mpmath:

        #Lets try mpmath instead:

        try:

            mpmath.mp.prec = precision
        except AttributeError:
            precision = mpmath.mp.prec

I will consider this, but hopefully it is not necessary, and mpmath will do the whole thing.
If I understood that right, burcin wants to change the numerical evaluation completly to mpmath, because it supports arbitrary prescision.

mpmath does, this function doesn't, but the current version in sage didn't either, so it's no prob.

Thank you for the patch Stefan. This was much needed for quite a while now.

I agree. I like how the patch looks overall. It would be good to see comparisons on
* error margins
* speed

Maybe Fredrik can comment on this as well.

Using `fast_callable()` for `mp_f` could help improve the speed.

Does anyone know of good examples to add as tests for numerical integration?

Unfortunately, ATM, the numerical evaluation framework for symbolic expressions doesn't support specifying different methods.

I guess this is based on a comment I made in the context of orthogonal polynomials and scipy vs. mpmath. Instead of a general policy, I'd like to consider each function separately. 

Overall, I'd lean toward using `mpfr` if it supports the given function. Otherwise, choosing between `pari`, `mpmath`, etc. can be difficult, since on many examples one implementation doesn't beat the other uniformly for different precision or domains.

Ok I will try this + do some tests in the near future!

I think I should find some, since I did/do a lot of work with finite element, spectral methods,
and boundary elements. I hope I can do this in the coming weeks.

I personally would highly recommend this. Consider for example highly oscillating integrals like 
`\int_0^pi f(x) sin(n*x) dx` for large `n`'s or the example from Runge:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon.
I would also suggest to take SciPy into consideration to provide indiviual data points.
On Friday, I and a colleague of mine had a simple example of a piecewise function, that only ScipPy could do properly while mpmath failed, (even MATLAB had problems) because I handled individual data points (mpath also provides different quadrature rules).
If you would like I could work on this.

That's true. I think we should provide, like mentioned above, method parameters.
But I don't think we have to fear compability problems, because if I understood the documentation of 
mpmath correctly it only evals the function on a data grid, and returns the `\sum weigth_i * data_i`.

I had now a little time to think about it, and I suggest to add even more tests. 
I initially used this tests, because the analytical solution is known so they would form a good basis. 

But yesterday I found out that if sage knows the analytical solution it just evaluate this, and I don't think this is the best way I gave it to discussion on sage devel: see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/886efb8ca8bdcff2

Why do I have this concern?
just try this:

```
integrate(sin(x^2),x,0,pi).n()
```

I will give more examples today or tomorrow.

I hadn't actually done the computation in Sage. I just wanted to note that web site here. :)

With the patch attached to this ticket:

```
sage: sigma = 1e-4
sage: ff = exp(-x**2/(2*sigma)) / sqrt(2*pi*sigma)
sage: from sage.symbolic.integration.integral import definite_integral
sage: definite_integral(ff, x, -20, 10, hold=True)
integrate(70.7106781186548*e^(-5000.00000000000*x^2)/sqrt(pi), x, -20, 10)
sage: definite_integral(ff, x, -20, 10, hold=True).n()
5.38249970415053e-939
```

Without the patch:

```
sage: definite_integral(ff, x, -20, 10, hold=True).n()
2.1074458151264474e-45
```

We get a better result if we allow maxima to evaluate the integral symbolically:

```
sage: definite_integral(ff, x, -20, 10).n()
1.00000000000000
sage: definite_integral(ff, x, -20, 10)
0.353553390593*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(pi)*erf(500*sqrt(2)) + sqrt(2)*sqrt(pi)*erf(1000*sqrt(2)))/sqrt(pi)
```

The web site I linked to in [comment:24](#comment%3A24) links to this page, where i got the example from:

http://trac.openopt.org/openopt/browser/PythonPackages/FuncDesigner/FuncDesigner/examples/integrate1.py

Here is an excerpt from that file:

```

This is indeed a great example!

This is again a grid problem and not a precision problem. If you make trapezoidal or gauss rule
on finer grids you get also better results.

```


The reason for this is simply that the function is
approximately 1 in a small region arround zero and nearly zero elsewhere. Thats also the reason why maxima works so well here: The main part is included in the analytical solution.

we are still waiting for comparison figures for errors and timings (see comment [comment:12]).
In those comparisons, I'd like to have arbitrary precision examples (say 20, 50, 100, 200, 500
and 1000 digits).

> Are there specific places where this patch is causing incorrect or worse behavior?  Burcin's example seems to be equally bad for both, and I disagree with maldun that we shouldn't return symbolic answers.  At some point you have to make a decision, and the definite integral should naturally be symbolic if at all possible.

of course `integrate(...)` will first give a symbolic result if any, then `integrate(...).n()` will evaluate numerically this symbolic value.
We should explain in the documentation of `integrate` how to avoid the symbolic evaluation
(for example adding the `hold` option). Anyway this is a different issue than this ticket.

I wrote a small function to compare errors and timings of the GSL implementation (of `numerical_integral`) and the mpmath implementation provided by the patch. Here is the testing code:

```python
def num_int_test(f, a, b):
    """ Input: `f` should be a function of a single variable, [a, b] is a domain of integration """
    LJ = 25 # left justification
    from sage.symbolic.integration.integral import definite_integral
    exact_I = definite_integral(f, f.variables()[0], a, b)
    print "Exact ".ljust(LJ)     + " = %s" % exact_I
    print "Exact .n()".ljust(LJ) + " = %s" % exact_I.n()
    print "GSL".ljust(LJ)        + " = %s" % numerical_integral(f, a, b)[0]
    print "mpmath".ljust(LJ)     + " = %s" % definite_integral(f, f.variables()[0], a, b, hold=True).n()
    
    num_I = definite_integral(f, f.variables()[0], a, b, hold=True)
    for p in [53, 64, 100, 200, 500, 1000]:
        s = "mpmath (prec=%d)" % p
        print s.ljust(LJ) + " = %s" % num_I.n(p)
        
    print "Timings at prec=53:"
    print "    GSL: ",
    timeit('numerical_integral(%s, %s, %s)' % (f, a, b))
    print "    mpmath: ", 
    timeit('definite_integral(%s, %s, %s, %s, hold=True).n()' % (f, f.variables()[0], a, b))
```

Now I took 3 examples from pg. 132 of the PDF suggested above at http://cannelle.lateralis.org/sagebook-1.0.pdf and tested them using `num_int_test`:

In the second example, GSL's answer compared to the numerically evaluated exact symbolic answer is significantly off. The mpmath answer at default precision matches the  numerically evaluated exact symbolic answer perfectly.

As for the timings, as you can see GSL is *much* faster than the patch code using mpmath. I tried using `fast_callable` in the case where the domain precision is the same as RDF and that gives a big speedup, though still not as fast as GSL:

```python
    def _evalf( ... ):
    ...
    
        try:
            precision = parent.prec()
            mpmath.mp.prec = precision
            if precision == RDF.precision():
                mp_f = fast_callable(f, vars=[x], domain=RDF)
            else:
                mp_f = lambda z: f(x = mpmath.mpmath_to_sage(z, precision))
        except AttributeError:
            mp_f = fast_callable(f, vars=[x], domain=RDF)
        
        return mpmath.call(mpmath.quad, mp_f, [a,b])
```

New timings using `fast_callable`:

```
# Testing: added fast_callable to _evalf_
# results: definite_integral( ... ) is around 5x faster when called at RDF precision

Obviously mpmath should support a relative tolerance out of the box, but there's a not-so-hackish workaround which Sage could use. The quadrature rules are implemented as classes, and can be subclassed:

```
from mpmath import *
from mpmath.calculus.quadrature import TanhSinh, GaussLegendre

class RelativeErrorMixin(object):
    def estimate_error(self, results, prec, epsilon):
        mag = abs(results[-1])
        if len(results) == 2:
            return abs(results[0]-results[1]) / mag
        try:
            if results[-1] == results[-2] == results[-3]:
                return self.ctx.zero
            D1 = self.ctx.log(abs(results[-1]-results[-2])/mag, 10)
            D2 = self.ctx.log(abs(results[-1]-results[-3])/mag, 10)
            if D2 == 0:
                D2 = self.ctx.inf
            else:
                D2 = self.ctx.one / D2
        except ValueError:
            return epsilon
        D3 = -prec
        D4 = min(0, max(D1**2 * D2, 2*D1, D3))
        return self.ctx.mpf(10) ** int(D4)

class TanhSinhRel(RelativeErrorMixin, TanhSinh):
    pass

class GaussLegendreRel(RelativeErrorMixin, GaussLegendre):
    pass
```
With this change:

```
>>> quad(lambda x: exp(-x**2)*log(x), [17,42], method=TanhSinhRel)
mpf('2.5657285005610513e-127')
>>> 
>>> quad(lambda x: exp(-x**2)*log(x), [17,42], method=GaussLegendreRel)
mpf('2.5657285005610513e-127')
```
BTW, I think the class will be instantiated every time this way, so the `__init__` method should be overwritten as well to create a singleton. Alternatively Sage could call the summation() method directly, which would remove some overhead.

The estimate_error method should be changed to something better and should be tested on many examples. The input "results" is a list of results generated at successive levels of refinement.

I've run some more comparisons which include Burcin's relative error for mpmath's quad. Here are some results  for 6 test functions. The code that runs the tests is here:  https://gist.github.com/1166436

In the output below:
- GSL means we call `numerical_integral`
- mpmath means we call `mpmath.call(mpmath.quad, mp_f, [a, b])` for an appropriate function `mp_f`
- mpmath_rel means we call `mpmath.call(mpmath.quad, mp_f, [a, b], method=GaussLegendreRel)` 

All of the times are listed in seconds.

The singleton trick definitely needs to be implemented; it can save a factor 4x or more.

Then there is the question of whether to use GaussLegendreRel or TanhSinhRel by default. Gauss-Legendre is somewhat faster for smooth integrands; Tanh-Sinh is much better for something like `sqrt(-x^2 + 1)` on `[0,1]` (note that the values with mpmath_rel above are wrong!) or almost anything on an infinite interval (this should be tested as well!). I would favor TanhSinhRel.

Anyway, I agree that it would be sensible to use GSL by default.

I understand what you are saying about the class being instantiated on every call. Can you explain what you mean by the "singleton trick"?

> Then there is the question of whether to use GaussLegendreRel or TanhSinhRel by default. Gauss-Legendre is somewhat faster for smooth integrands; Tanh-Sinh is much better for something like `sqrt(-x^2 + 1)` on `[0,1]` (note that the values with mpmath_rel above are wrong!) or almost anything on an infinite interval (this should be tested as well!).

For `mp_f = sqrt(1-x**2)`, here is what TanhSinhRel gives in comparison with GaussLengendreRel and with absolute errors, as well as the approx. of the exact answer pi/4:

```
sage: mp_f = lambda z: f(x = mpmath.mpmath_to_sage(z, 53))
sage: mpmath.call(mpmath.quad, mp_f, [a, b])
0.785398163397448
sage: mpmath.call(mpmath.quad, mp_f, [a, b], method=GaussLegendreRel)
0.785398325435763
sage: mpmath.call(mpmath.quad, mp_f, [a, b], method=TanhSinhRel)
0.785398163397448
sage: N(pi/4)
0.785398163397448
```

ps. somehow I read your second to last comment (about the relative error) and thought it was written by Burcin (hence my reference to his name in my reply). Sorry :)

To make a class singleton, add something like this (warning: untested):

```
    instance = None
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls.instance:
            cls.instance = super(ThisClass, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)

I tried making TanhSinhRel the default and including the singleton `__new__` code you gave. Here is the resulting class definition:

```python
class TanhSinhRel(TanhSinh):
    instance = None
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwds):
        if not cls.instance:
            cls.instance = super(TanhSinhRel, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kwds)

    def estimate_error(self, results, prec, epsilon):

        if len(results) == 2:
            return abs(results[0]-results[1]) / mag
        try:
            if results[-1] == results[-2] == results[-3]:
                return self.ctx.zero
            D1 = self.ctx.log(abs(results[-1]-results[-2])/mag, 10)
            D2 = self.ctx.log(abs(results[-1]-results[-3])/mag, 10)
            if D2 == 0:
                D2 = self.ctx.inf
            else:
                D2 = self.ctx.one / D2
        except ValueError:
            return epsilon
        D3 = -prec
        D4 = min(0, max(D1**2 * D2, 2*D1, D3))
        return self.ctx.mpf(10) ** int(D4)
```

I couldn't see a timing difference by adding that code to TanhSinhRel (but maybe this isn't the right place to add it?). Also, I get a deprecation warning about arguments passed to `__new__`

Here are two tests in a row, one shows the deprecation warning, the second doesn't:

```

```

and again in the same session to check if timings have improved:

```

```

The timings do improve after the first call which includes `method=TanhSinhRel`, but not dramatically. Am I missing something?

Ugh, I should clearly have tested this feature properly in mpmath. The problem is that the `__init__` method clears the caches. This definitely needs to be changed in mpmath. Anyway, a workaround is to move the initialization to the `__new__` method, like this:

```
    def __new__(cls):
        if not cls.instance:
            cls.instance = object.__new__(cls)
            cls.instance.standard_cache = {}
            cls.instance.transformed_cache = {}
            cls.instance.interval_count = {}
        return cls.instance
    def __init__(self, ctx):
        self.ctx = ctx
```
This ought to work. The speedup of doing this should be greater for GaussLegendre than for TanhSinh, since the node generation is more expensive for the former.

Some further speedup would be possible by overriding the transform_nodes and sum_next methods so that Sage numbers are used most of the time. This way most of the calls to sage_to_mpmath and mpmath_to_sage could be avoided when an interval is reused.

transform_nodes would just have to be replaced by a simple wrapper function that takes the output (a list of pairs of numbers) from the transform_nodes method of the parent class and converts it to Sage numbers.

sum_next computes the sum over `weight[i]*f(node[i])`. This is trivial and could just be changed to a simple loop to work optimally with Sage numbers. (Only the return value needs to be converted back to an mpmath number).

This should all just require a few lines of code. One just needs to be careful to get the precision right in the conversions, and to support both real and complex numbers. Unless someone else is extremely eager to implement this, I could look at this tomorrow.

I especially like this quote.  I think it is a better way forward than trying to guess what the user needs - maybe just allowing many options is better.

```
In my opinion, an interface simplifying the use of packages like QUADPACK
should not attempt to guess which method is more appropriate for a given
problem. This should be left to the user. Otherwise we are going to have an
"all-purpose" Maxima function supposed to do everything, like Mathematica's
function "NIntegrate", which, however, not only fails to do what is supposed
to do in many cases, but also encourages the "blind use" of Numerical
Analysis. There is no "perfect" numerical method, able to solve any problem
efficiently; this is true for any numerical problem, such as numerical
quadrature, solution of initial or boundary value problems etc.
Two simple examples:
(1) consider integrating a "sawtooth" function. Romberg integration, which
is generally very fast and accurate for smooth functions would have a hard
time integrating a sawtooth function, while a simple trapezoidal method
would be much faster in that particular case.
(2) Most people use "natural" cubic splines for interpolation, just because
of their name I guess, or maybe because Computer Algebra Systems use natural
cubic splines by default for interpolation. However, "natural" splines are
not natural at all, and should be used only if there is a reason to assume
second derivative is zero at the end points of the interpolation interval.
Otherwise, "not-a-knot" splines should be used instead.

I doubt there is a way to make a function which automatically selects the
best method to solve a numerical problem. Mathematica tries that and the
result is disappointing. I am very suspicious about such attempts, and I
believe none should trust them, no matter how sophisticated they are.
Everyone who needs to use numerical methods should have a basic knowledge of
what (s)he is doing, and should be able to pick the numerical method most
appropriate method for a given problem.

It does not work for two reasons:
- `gp.intnum` does not accept python keyword arguments (it would be very painful and error prone to transform that to the appropriate string input to `gp`
- formula transformation to gp is very limited:

```
sage: gp(sin(x)/x^2)
x^-1 - 1/6*x + 1/120*x^3 - 1/5040*x^5 + 1/362880*x^7 - 1/39916800*x^9 + 1/6227020800*x^11 - 1/1307674368000*x^13 + O(x^15)
```
The latter point seems the most fundamental to me. For arbitrary precision numerical integration, GP/PARI is probably our best bet, though, and it seems that the PARI C api should be quite usable, because the integrand gets passed as a black box function. From [PARI handbook](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html.stable/Sums,_products,_integrals_and_similar_functions.html), we get the signature:

```
intnum(void *E, GEN (*eval)(void*,GEN), GEN a,GEN b,GEN tab, long prec)
```
so as long as we can provide a way to evaluate our integrand (say) `f` at a value `x` with precision `prec`, we can wrap that up into a C function that takes a `GEN`, converts it to `x`, evaluates `f` there and converts the result to a `GEN` and passes it back. We could pass a pointer to that function in as `eval` and then everything should work.

Pari's high precision numerical integration is supposed to be of quite high quality.

This approach would be much easier than trying to symbolically translate any arbitrary Sage symbolic expression to GP (plus more general, because we would be able to use any python callable, provided we find a way to provide the desired precision)

> Sage 4.8 can now integrate the formula in this ticket

You are right that for this ticket, the original example doesn't test generic numerical integration. The numerical approximation of the resulting expressions in gamma functions seems suspect, though:

```
sage: h = integral(sin(x)/x^2, (x, 1, pi/2));
sage: H1=h.n(digits=20)
sage: H2=h.n(digits=100)
sage: delta=parent(H2)(H1)-H2
sage: delta
0
sage: parent(delta)
Complex Field with 336 bits of precision
sage: H2.imag_part()
5.421010862427522170037264004349708557128906250000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e-20
```
Also note that the equality tests as stated in the examples are not direct evidence that something is going wrong:

```
sage: a=RealField(10)(1)
sage: b=RealField(20)(1)+RealField(20)(2)^(-14)
sage: a,b
(1.0, 1.0001)
sage: a == b
True
```
I guess the numbers are coerced into the parent with least precision before being compared ...
