This was requested by Ursula Whitcher on sage-support.  She adds:

```
  I'm playing with a family of plane curves with rational coefficients in 
  the complex projective plane.  So rational or complex numbers would be 
  enough for me to test examples.  In a perfect world I'd be able to 
  specify a family using rational functions of arbitrary constants 
  (something like a x^2 + b/(a-1) y^2), and compute the projective dual in 
  terms of those constants.
```

A good place to start in implementing this could be http://www.emilvolcheck.com/dual.ps

The attached patch implements this for (reduced and irreducible) hypersurfaces over the rationals. I intend to generalize this.

I use Grobner bases and elimination. Resultants might be faster so I might switch to that approach.

If you plug in a variety I think the dual should be reduced. I'm not sure exactly what the scheme structure of the output is at the moment.

Something related to think about for the general case: given a subscheme X of projective space, what should the dual of X be?

I will look at the approach described in the attached paper. When the dual is a hypersurface and has smaller degree than "expected", that approach seems to be better than the one used at the moment.
