the provided patch does also some 'cosmetic' changes, replacing

Beware, with your patch applied I get:

```
sage: %timeit graphs.CubeGraph(12)
5 loops, best of 3: 2.95 s per loop
sage: time g = graphs.CubeGraph(14)
CPU times: user 72.66 s, sys: 0.42 s, total: 73.08 s
```
whereas with mine only I have:

```
sage: %timeit graphs.CubeGraph(12)
5 loops, best of 3: 653 ms per loop
sage: time g = graphs.CubeGraph(14)
CPU times: user 3.10 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 3.16 s
```

This is mainly because using the construction `Graph(d, ...)` add
some checks I avoid setting vertices and edges myself.

Thank you for pointing this out. I've reverted that part of the patch.

Can you see any way to make the overhead from checking in this case any better? Also, what do you think about a check=False option in graph construction, more generally?
