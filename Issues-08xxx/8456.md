I started with importing the first patch only. I tried to lazy-import ZZ, but it did not properly work:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
sage: lazy_import('sage.rings.all', 'ZZ')
sage: type(ZZ)
<type 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class'>
```
According to the doc tests, the result should be different.

I then imported the second patch. When starting sage, I got

```

No idea what this means. But I think it is "needs work".

Simon, could you look at this again, when it's convenient?  I can try to review this, but I'm not sure that I'm sufficiently familiar with Cython.

For me, all three patches apply cleanly to 4.5.3.alpha1 (using a Mercurial queue).

rebase 8456-lazy-import-cython.patch to sage 4.6

patches apply and doctest pass. The code looks ok, but I do not know (yet) cython nor python introspection to give a positive review.

<div id="comment:12" align="right">comment:12</div>

As a user, I would be puzzled if I found at the begining of the session:

```
sage: InfinityRing
<sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport object at 0x7f51dca0e290>
sage: InfinityRing()
Zero
sage: InfinityRing
The Infinity Ring
```

So I think that LazyImport should have a `__repr__` method that inserts the real object in the namespace.

The problem is that once you start with this kind of things you do not know where to stop...

```
sage: infinity in InfinityRing
TypeError: argument of type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport' is not iterable
```

So, what about `__repr__`, `__contains__`, `_latex_`, `__cmp__` ? Is it worth to add them to the class? Should this be in another ticket?
