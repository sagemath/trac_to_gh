I started with importing the first patch only. I tried to lazy-import ZZ, but it did not properly work:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
sage: lazy_import('sage.rings.all', 'ZZ')
sage: type(ZZ)
<type 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class'>
```
According to the doc tests, the result should be different.

I then imported the second patch. When starting sage, I got

```

No idea what this means. But I think it is "needs work".

As a user, I would be puzzled if I found at the begining of the session:

```
sage: InfinityRing
<sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport object at 0x7f51dca0e290>
sage: InfinityRing()
Zero
sage: InfinityRing
The Infinity Ring
```

So I think that LazyImport should have a __repr__ method that inserts the real object in the namespace.

The problem is that once you start with this kind of things you do not know where to stop...

```
sage: infinity in InfinityRing
TypeError: argument of type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport' is not iterable
```

So, what about __repr__, __contains__, _latex_, __cmp__ ? Is it worth to add them to the class? Should this be in another ticket?
