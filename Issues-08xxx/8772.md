Sufficiently many calls to Maxima eventually causes that interface to throw an exception, some samples of which are given below.    A minimal piece of code exhibiting this problem is

```
def prob(): 
    for i in xrange(1000000): 
        a = var('a') 
        eqn = (a - 1)/(a) 
        eqn.numerator() 
```
This error has been observed in Sage 4.3.* on OS X.5.* (8-core Xeon Mac Pro and 2-core Intel Core 2 Mac Book), and Ubuntu Linux 9.10 (quad-core Intel Core 2).  See the sage-devel thread [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/3b43147e44324c25](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/3b43147e44324c25) for some discussion.  In particular, it may be related to #5662 where the synchronization with Maxima was getting lost on  certain multi-core CPUs because of something related to switching between cores.   It takes some time, e.g. 5-15 minutes for the problem to manifest itself.  

Typical errors:

```

On the following system, with Sage 4.5.3.alpha2. 

* Sun Ultra 27
* 3.33 GHz Intel Xeon W3580 CPU. 4 cores. 8 threads. (Hyperthreaded)
* 12 GB of ECC DDR3 RAM
* 2 x 500 GB disks (both mirrored)
* 2 x 2 TB disks (both mirrored)
* ZFS 128-bit file system, which should detect and correct errors
* OpenSolaris 06/2009.

which is not a cheap PC, but a decent workstation, I see this error 4 times when 

```
make ptestlong
```

was run 100 times. So it's causing  `make ptestlong ` to fail in 4% of cases for me. Since this machine is hyperthreaded and has 4 cores, 8 threads would be run when the doctests were run. I've checked the system logs and there are now reported hardware problems.

The following tests failed one or more times

```
devel/sage-main/sage/modular/overconvergent/weightspace.py (twice)
devel/sage/sage/tests/benchmark.py (once)
devel/sage/sage/calculus/desolvers.py (once)
```

In each case, although the exact error message is different, I always see:

```
Premature termination of input
```

Sure. I will attach four files

(I've added `print i, ` to the last line of his example.)

Doctesting in parallel with 32 threads (`ptestlong`) btw. gave no errors. I'll have to inspect the log of the run with 64 threads, but IIRC there was only one "intentional" timeout due to SIGALARM set to 1 second... (128 threads exceeded my physical memory, i.e. caused massive swapping.)

I couldn't post this earlier either because of trac errors... ;-)
