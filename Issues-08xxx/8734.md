Concerning the remaining doctests in `interfaces/maxima_abstract.py` I am at a loss at what to do. For example this

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y'); f = maxima.function('x','sin(x)')
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.interfaces.maxima.MaximaElementFunction'>
sage: g=maxima.cos(x)
sage: type(g)
<class 'sage.interfaces.maxima.MaximaElement'>
sage: f+g
cos(_SAGE_VAR_x)+sin(x)
sage: (f+g)(2)
cos(_SAGE_VAR_x)+sin(2)
```
shows that while the `MaximaElementFunction f` has the variable `x` which is associated with `_SAGE_VAR_x` in Maxima (and calling the function works as expected), the `MaximaElement g` shows `_SAGE_VAR_x` which has of course no Maxima pendant (and calling the function bombs). Naively both should behave identically.

```
sage: h=SR(maxima.cos(x))
sage: h
cos(x)
sage: h(2)
cos(2)
sage: f+h
cos(_SAGE_VAR_x)+sin(x)
sage: (f+h)(2)
cos(_SAGE_VAR_x)+sin(2)
```
Moreover, if `g` gets converted to `SR` it behaves fine but when converted to `type(f)` by using it as rhs it gets `_SAGE_VAR_x` as parameter. What is the next step?

As far as I understand now, a `MaximaElementFunction` is a function defined within the Maxima process, and so `x` is the parameter name, not a registered variable. Thus the output `sin(x)` makes sense. OTOH any `_SAGE_VAR_x` that appears in a `MaximaElement` repr refers to a registered variable within Maxima that is associated with a registered Sage var named `x`. Let's interpret the above output in the light of this.
> {{{

> }}}

Correct but can the user make sense of it?
> {{{
> sage: (f+g)(2)
> cos(_SAGE_VAR_x)+sin(2)
> }}}

That is not less correct than

```
sage: (sin(x)+cos(y))(2)
cos(y) + sin(2)
```
and it just seems to be another case of `SR._call_element_()` where is stated: "Note that you make get unexpected results when calling symbolic expressions and not explicitly giving the variables."

Moreover, it was a hack that this worked at all in the `MaximaAbstractElementFunction._add_()` doctests because

```
sage: f = maxima.function('z','sin(z)')
sage: f
sin(z)
sage: f(2)
sin(2)
sage: (sin(z))(2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
NameError: name 'z' is not defined
```

Okay, here are a few questions.  I am pretty sure the answers are very straightforward, but I want to make sure it's clear - in case we might want to add a doctest, for instance.
* Commit 	be9367 (where you add a try/except clause in `_create`) - what sort of situation is that catching?  (Also, did you change all of the doctests with assumptions, or leave a few just so people see what the full form looks like?)
* Commit 	ced268 (where you generalized the missing assumptions) - what situation is that additionally catching?  Was that a case of Maxima asking questions which we didn't catch (and hence doctest) before?
* I assume you are more than happy with Jason's original patch doing the basic functionality, right?

The only part I haven't had a chance to really dig into is the differential equations changes (Commit a74ec0).  I assume there isn't an obvious more modular way to deal with those :( but I don't have time currently to go through this in detail.  My main issue (not really a concern, just my lack of being convinced yet) is just seeing that we really aren't over-replacing or under-replacing in that.

So these are pretty minor things and hopefully I'll be able to find some time for the DE part (or someone else will!) and we'll be on our way!  It certainly looks like you were VERY thorough in finding places that might cause trouble.  The difficulty is that one might miss some places it is needed because in the absence of adding `_SAGE_VAR_` things should still work, so one might not know if we missed one.  Thanks!

Sure, as long as you remember "The perfect is the enemy of the good." 
> * Commit 	be9367 (where you add a try/except clause in `_create`) - what sort of situation is that catching?
 
There are several places where maxima.eval() is called and where exceptions are thrown. This one was simply overlooked, so that change fixes an unreported bug.
>(Also, did you change all of the doctests with assumptions, or leave a few just so people see what the full form looks like?)

Yes.
> * Commit 	ced268 (where you generalized the missing assumptions) - what situation is that additionally catching?  Was that a case of Maxima asking questions which we didn't catch (and hence doctest) before?
 
No, it reduces code duplication. Recommended reading: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring
> * I assume you are more than happy with Jason's original patch doing the basic functionality, right?
 
Yes and no. A lot was missing.
> ...

I would assume this is caught by all those doctests using maxima.

The output changed recently and I forgot to fix one doctest.

That's my point - they may NOT catch a missing one, since we only remove things via search-and-replace-with-empty-string, and everything worked before.

What I mean is that if one had missed a place where we should have added `SAGE_VAR` but didn't, we might not know because the result would not need `SAGE_VAR` stripped from it, so it would perhaps still work.  But I'm not overly concerned about this ... because it would still work.

Anyway, if someone reviews the diffeq part before me (I won't have time before next week), that is all I think still needs review.  This will be great to finally have in!

In this case, yes. Else, are you requesting to rethrow the `RuntimeError` from Maxima in all cases as `RuntimeError`? I'm asking because it appears that preserving the stacktrace and throwing the more specific `ValueError` appears possible:
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/python/947257

```
In Python 3 you could chain the exceptions with: 

except Exception as e: 
raise CustomException() from e 

There is no such syntax in Python 2, but you could manually store and 
retrieve the __cause__ and __traceback__ attributes similarly to the 
way Python 3 does it. See PEP 3134 for full details. 
```
http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3134/

```
Sometimes it can be useful for an exception handler to intentionally
    re-raise an exception, either to provide extra information or to
    translate an exception to another type. ...

    "body": "<a id='comment:48'></a>\nAll the following is modulo my Python newbieness.\n\nWhat I wrote about legal tricks to preserve the traceback would work IF Sage was purely Python-2 or Python-3.

All the following is modulo my Python newbieness.

What I wrote about legal tricks to preserve the traceback would work IF Sage was purely Python-2 or Python-3. With the momentary transition to Py-3, the form `raise Error, message, traceback` of the raise command is considered a bug. OTOH there is no way to supply two arguments in parentheses. Finally, the form `raise Error from previous_error` is only possible with Py-3.

Secondly, to ask interactively for a missing assumption a message has to be given in the terminal different from the error message tied to the original `RuntimeError`. So, simply re-raising is not an option if you do not like `RuntimeError: ECL says: Maxima asks: Is _SAGE_VAR_a an integer?`.

So, in my opinion, unless someone comes up with a better solution, this ticket will have to wait until Sage is Py-3.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:61'></a>\nAfter studying this in detail, the reason why the last change makes no difference is the following: in `desolve` and `desolve_laplace` the translation to Maxima is applied several times using `maxima()` and `P()` (which is the parent of the first translation result, i.e. of a Maxima expression). `P()` is also applied to `dvar.operator()` resulting in `dvar_str` which already has `_SAGE_VAR_` and is template for sanitization. Appending `_SAGE_VAR_` to `dvar_str` and replacing it thus was useless.\n\nIn `desolve_rk4` the `cmd` is constructed from two parts: the `de0` that gets translated via `._maxima()_` and the construction via string concatenation. So, there is no difference between `desolve` and `desolve_rk4` because `desolve` gets `_SAGE_VAR_` everywhere and `desolve_rk4` too.",

After studying this in detail, the reason why the last change makes no difference is the following: in `desolve` and `desolve_laplace` the translation to Maxima is applied several times using `maxima()` and `P()` (which is the parent of the first translation result, i.e. of a Maxima expression). `P()` is also applied to `dvar.operator()` resulting in `dvar_str` which already has `_SAGE_VAR_` and is template for sanitization. Appending `_SAGE_VAR_` to `dvar_str` and replacing it thus was useless.

In `desolve_rk4` the `cmd` is constructed from two parts: the `de0` that gets translated via `._maxima()_` and the construction via string concatenation. So, there is no difference between `desolve` and `desolve_rk4` because `desolve` gets `_SAGE_VAR_` everywhere and `desolve_rk4` too.
