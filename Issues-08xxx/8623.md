<a id='comment:1'></a>This is an example of user interface for lcalc library. This interface does not assume that the center is half.  This is not finished, but I would like some feedback on the design decisions.

Below is how to use it

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve([1,-1,1,-1,-14])
sage: L=E.lfunction()
sage: L
L Function of  Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + y = x^3 - x^2 - x - 14 over Rational Field
sage: L.value(1)

sage: L(1)

sage: L.find_zeros_and_verify(4)
