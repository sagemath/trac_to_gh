The following raises an `IndexError`:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = CC[]

The call `R(1).univariate_polynomial()` seems to fail.

The patch looks fine to me, applies ok to 4.4.2.rc0 and all tests in sage/rings/polynomial pass.

Looking at the code in this file, some of it seems very over-complicated -- do people agree?  The is_univariate() function could just return self.nvariables()<2.  And the conversion to univariate function (which this patch patches) could more simply, after constructing the ring R as now, return `f([R.gen()]*f.parent().ngens())` saving 20 complicated lines.

I am copying in malb who may have an opinion.  If people agree we could open a ticket for simplifying these.  But this patch gets a positive review from me anyway.
