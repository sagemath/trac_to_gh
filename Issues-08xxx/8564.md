Hi,

please apply the attached patch. The corresponding test is in sympy in sympy/test_external/test_sage.py. It'd be cool to execute that file automatically in sage doctests, not sure currently how to do it.

I uploaded two patches, 
* attachment:trac_8564-atan2_conversion.patch is Ondrej's fix including a header with a commit message 
* attachment:trac_8564-doctests.patch adds a doctest.

I give a positive review to Ondrej's patch, if someone can review the doctest I added this will be ready to go.

The patches to be merged are (in this order):
* attachment:trac_8564-atan2_conversion.patch
* attachment:trac_8564-doctests.patch

The doctest patch depends on #8565.

This seems fine, works well and tests the appropriate thing (i.e. not arctan2(2,3), but the symbolic thing).  Positive review to both.

Question about the Sympy doctest file Ondrej mentions above - it doesn't have 

```
check_expression("atan2(y,x)", "y x")
```
or whatever would work, in test_functions or something like that.  Should it?

Thanks!

Btw, the check_expression() for atan2 is in the latest git sympy, so I need to update the Sage package for it. There were some unrelated mpmath problems with it, that I have to solve first.
