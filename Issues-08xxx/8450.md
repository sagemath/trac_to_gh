All of the following plots fail

```
x, y = SR.var('x y')
contour_plot(abs(x+i*y), (x,-1,1), (y,-1,1))
density_plot(abs(x+i*y), (x,-1,1), (y,-1,1))
plot3d(abs(x+i*y), (x,-1,1),(y,-1,1))
streamline_plot(abs(x+i*y), (x,-1,1),(y,-1,1))
```
with

```
TypeError: unable to coerce to a real number
```
The culprit is the call to `setup_for_eval_on_grid` (from `sage/plot/misc.py`) that tries to compile the symbolic expression with `fast_float`. But since the expression involves an intermediate complex number the compilation fails. This can be tested with any of the two

```
fast_float(abs(x + i*y), x, y)
fast_callable(abs(x + i*y), vars=[x,y])
```
The function compilation succeeds if we ask for a complex function instead

```
fast_callable(abs(x + i*y), vars=[x,y], domain=complex)
```

    "body": "<a id='comment:11'></a>\nThis is an \"easy fix\" but causes a cascade of other issues because removing `domain=float` turns a lot of things that used to be `Nan` into `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.\n\nI'm still running a ptestlong on this, but everything under `sage/plot` now passes. Here are some thoughts:\n\n1. Do we really want to support passing (for example) the integer zero as a function to be plotted? We have doctests that check things like `plot(ZZ(0), x, 0, 1)`. Supporting this requires special cases in the code, and IMO just perpetuates confusion about the difference between the integer 0 and the function const0.\n2.

This is an "easy fix" but causes a cascade of other issues because removing `domain=float` turns a lot of things that used to be `Nan` into `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.

I'm still running a ptestlong on this, but everything under `sage/plot` now passes. Here are some thoughts:

1. Do we really want to support passing (for example) the integer zero as a function to be plotted? We have doctests that check things like `plot(ZZ(0), x, 0, 1)`. Supporting this requires special cases in the code, and IMO just perpetuates confusion about the difference between the integer 0 and the function const0.
2. We now have "try to evaluate this as a real number, and return NaN (or skip it) if we can't" code in at least five places. Should this be made consistent, or (better yet) factored out? I've made it so that the doctests pass, but in some places we catch only e.g. `TypeError`, while in others we check for a nice long list.
3. This needs a careful review, since it can change the appearance of plots. There was some other (now fixed) bug involved as you can see from the commit list, but for example, this fix accidentally broke `list_plot`.
4. I don't really like using try/except in fast loops. Is there a better way to fix the doctest failures that the first commit caused and that the later ones fix?

The first thing `fast_float()` tries is to use `fast_callable()` with `domain=float`:

```python
try:
    return fast_callable(f, vars=vars, domain=float,
                         expect_one_var=expect_one_var)
```

We're now using `fast_callable()` directly, and omit the `domain`.

I actually hold a grudge against this bug from back when I was generating plots programmatically and the random appearance of `0.000000000001*I` would kill the whole thing after an hour, so I haven't given up.

I tried a few more things, described in the first of the recent commit messages, and discovered problems with all of them. I did however eventually find a solution that is both unobtrusive and fast: wrap fast-callable evaluation in a class that can force the result to a specific output type. With ``domain=<something complex>`` and ``output=<something real>``, we return `NaN` unless the imaginary part is trivial, in which case we return the real part. In all other situations we simply try to coerce the output to the given type.

This allows us to plot over CDF but convert the result to float (possibly NaN) only on the way out, without having to hack that conversion logic into a hundred plotting functions. It's probably as fast as any solution could be; complex (two-float) operations necessarily take longer than plain float computations, but the difference is small in my non-rigorous tests, less than 10%.

An output wrapper is not used unless it's needed, so this doesn't affect any other uses of `fast_callable()` in the tree.

test block needs double-colon:

```diff
