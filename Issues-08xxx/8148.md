In Sage 4.3.2.alpha0:

```
sage: Q = Poset({1: [], 3: [], 2: [1, 3]})
sage: Q.show()  # works fine
sage: Q.dual().show()
...
IndexError: list index out of range
```
Note that the following works, and is what I'm using in my code right now:

```
sage: Poset(Q.hasse_diagram().reverse()).show()
```
Actually, though, this fails if Q is defined instead to be

```
sage: Q = Poset({1: [], 2: [1]})
sage: Q.show()  # works fine, although the picture looks a little funny
sage: Poset(Q.hasse_diagram().reverse()).show()
...
RuntimeError: Error building image
```

See #10998 instead.

This is probably the best fix at the moment (although it would be nice if FinitePoset() could be used by itself).

For the patch, can you add the ticket number to the doctest somewhere?

I would also create a "TESTS:" section under examples, since this isn't really a useful example independent of the fact that it demonstrates this bug.

You can give the doctest a little introduction, too. For example,

```
TESTS:

We should get a valid FinitePoset back if we call dual() on a finite poset (trac #8148)::

    sage: ...
```

It's the double-colon that says "here comes a doctest."

Hi!

Sorry, I should have been more reactive to spare you this patch. In principle, this is fixed by #10998 which is almost finished, and I hope to get in soon. Could you double check this?

Cheers,
