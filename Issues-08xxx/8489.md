The attached patch for sagetex adds a new sageexample environment for sagetex:

```
\begin{sageexample}
  sage: 1+1
  2
  sage: x^3
  x^3
\end{sageexample}
```

The (ultimate) goal is to allow for straightforward copy paste of
pieces of sage doctests into one's latex document. See the attached
pdf (the sources of which are included in the patch) for details.

I have had troubles getting doctesting to work -- every time I try `sage -t my_file.sage`, it fails with a "mysterious error". Same thing if I try with the .py file.

I also changed your vertical space fix to use `\abovedisplayskip` and friends, which I just learned about from http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/math/voss/mathmode/.

There's more fixups to the documentation that should be done, but it seems to be working properly. Please pull from the bitbucket repo and test. I think I'll make a spkg for this new version and see if we can get it into the next Sage release.

I'm not sure how to fix that. I don't think it's an issue about encoding in the document; a single straight quote (ASCII character 39) should be the same in any non-crazy encoding, since all reasonable encodings that I know of agree for characters 0 to 127.

The issue, I think, is the character that gets put into the final PDF. I'm not sure how to bypass the usual TeX behavior of turning single quotes into curly final quotes.

In any case, Nicolas' original goal is cut and paste from Sage into a LaTeX document, which works now.

If this is a highly desired feature, I could work on it, but since cut and paste of things with single quotes generally doesn't work from TeX-generated PDFs anyway, I'm not sure how important this should be.

Since #8605 is closed, should this be closed also?  It looks like there is still discussion going on here...

This ticket is marked as "needs review", but is there anything still to review here?  Have the relevant pieces been merged into the sagetex spkg by now?

I think this ticket should be closed, since the sageexample environment has been implemented, and we ship a version of SageTeX with it. If there are further problems with sageexample, someone should open a new ticket.
