This patch refactors completely the framework for (covariant)
functorial constructions, improves the existing ones, and adds new ones.

Improved constructions:
- Cartesian products: generalization to non modules_with_basis,
  monoid operations, ...

New constructions:
- Subquotients, Quotients, Subobjects, IsomorphicObjects
- DualObjects, Algebras

Miscellaneous category fixes and improvements:
- is_subcategory now handles properly join categories
  (courtesy of Florent Hivert)
- For a field K, Modules(K) returns VectorSpaces(K)
- As a temporary workaround, Parent._an_element_ calls the
  _an_element_ method provided by the categories, if available
- Adds a method Category.or_subcategory
- Cleans up _repr_ by extracting a _repr_object_names method
- Cleans up _latex_ by extracting a _short_name method

Depend on #9104

One last remark, otherwise I'm ready to give positive review: there is a slight naming inconsistency:
- `CartesianProductFunctor, CartesianProducts, CartesianProductsCategory, cartesian_product`
- `TensorFunctor, TensorProducts, TensorProductsCategory, tensor`

I'm just not 100% sure that we don't want `TensorProductFunctor` and `tensor_product`...

Any arguments ? 

By the way I put Priority=critical because they are at least a dozen of patch on sage-combinat which depend on this one...

Yup, we had discussed this with David Roe during the review of the
category patches. And we had agreed that `tensor([A,B,C])` was
shorter and more practical than `tensor_product([A,B,C])`, yet
clear and unambiguous. On the other hand `cartesian([A,B,C])`
wasn't that clear. So we decided to favor here practicality over
consistency.

On the other hand, I fixed TensorFunctor to TensorProductFunctor in
the updated patch.
