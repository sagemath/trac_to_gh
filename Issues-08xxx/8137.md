Get Thomas R. Nicely's code for approximating the counts of twin primes and other primes into Sage.

The code can be found at http://www.trnicely.net/.

Sage already has a Li implementation, so all that needs to be added to Sage is code for the twin primes, prime triplets, and prime quadruplets.  However, Sage's default Li implementation uses direct numerical integration.  Maybe this should be switched out for an equivalent (and faster) series implementation.

Take note of Remark 4 in Introduction to twin primes and Brun’s constant computation, by Pascal Sebah and Xavier Gourdon at numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/constants.html (July 30, 2002)

"Remark 4 The function Li2 (n) occuring in (1) may be related to the logarithmic integral Li(n) by the trivial relation

                      Li2(n) = Li(n) +   2 / log(2) - n / log(n)."
