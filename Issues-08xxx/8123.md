It seems that the notebook is close to serving "SVG" files in a way usable for SVG capable browser, but is not quite there:
If I try

```
sage: p = plot(x^2, -2, 2)
sage: p.save('xsquared.svg')
```
in the notebook, Firefox 3.5.2 gives me a "plugin needed" message and where the picture is supposed to be, I only get a placeholder.
If I save `xsquared.svg` and point my browser directly to it, firefox displays the picture, so Firefox 3.5.2 can understand the SVG produced. HTML code that succeeds in displaying the picture:

```
<html>
<body>
<object data="xsquared.svg">
</body>
</html>
```
So, it may be that the notebook simply needs to generate different HTML for including SVG files it finds. Alternatively, it may be a matter of serving the SVG file with the appropriate MIME type.

Try adding

```
image/svg+xml   svg svgz
```
to `/etc/mime.times`, then restarting the notebook server and the browser.  This works for me in Firefox 3.5.6 on 64-bit Fedora 10 Linux.

Could be worth checking out whether this works in Jupyter first - most of the other sagenb ones are definitely sagenb specific, but could be worth seeing whether 

```
sage: p = plot(x^2, -2, 2)
sage: p.save('xsquared.svg')
```
"works" as expected in Jupyter.  (I would hope all browsers would now support this though!)
