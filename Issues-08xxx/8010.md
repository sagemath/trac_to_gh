This is using 4.3.1rc1 on 10.6, 64-bit.

The problem is that local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/numpy/distutils/fcompiler/gnu.py adds a "-shared" flag when linking, even though OS X doesn't support it.

Has this been checked on Solaris? 

There's general information about building on Solaris at

http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

Information specifically for 't2' at 

http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

Both the source (4.3.0.1 is the latest to build on Solaris) and a binary which will run on any SPARC can be found at http://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html

This platform-check and substitution is already being done elsewhere in the file (in the Sage_FCompiler class), but was not being done in Sage_FCompiler_1, so it's a pretty innocuous patch.

This breaks "on some mac systems" - f2py is broken on my 64-bit sage, but seems to be working on 32-bit mac systems without this patch.  My guess is that 32-bit macs use Sage_FCompiler rather than Sage_FCompiler_1.  Anyone who is familiar with the numpy spkg, please confirm or correct me!

I haven't reported this upstream.  The change was made to a class called Sage_FCompiler_1, which sounds like Sage-specific code.  The problem was already fixed in the very similar Sage_FCompiler.
