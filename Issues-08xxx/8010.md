This is using 4.3.1rc1 on 10.6, 64-bit.

The problem is that local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/numpy/distutils/fcompiler/gnu.py adds a "-shared" flag when linking, even though OS X doesn't support it.

Has this been checked on Solaris? 

There's general information about building on Solaris at

http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

Information specifically for 't2' at 

http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

Both the source (4.3.0.1 is the latest to build on Solaris) and a binary which will run on any SPARC can be found at http://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html

I haven't checked this on Solaris, but it shouldn't affect behaviour on any platform other than OS X.  All this patch does is substitute the options "-undefined dynamic_lookup -bundle" for "-shared" under OS X, since on OS X the compiler doesn't support "-shared".

This platform-check and substitution is already being done elsewhere in the file (in the Sage_FCompiler class), but was not being done in Sage_FCompiler_1, so it's a pretty innocuous patch.
