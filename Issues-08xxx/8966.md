sage: a=R.random_element()
sage: a.reduce([None,None])


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in Sage.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate (sorry).

This was a simple input checking problem in our interface to polybori. I would have expected Cython not to accept `None` as a `BooleanPolynomial` though.

Looks good.  Note I changed it from ValueError to TypeError, since it is really a TypeError, and that's what Cython should raise.
