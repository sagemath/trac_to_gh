sage: V.linear_combination_of_basis([1, -1/2])

Note that (2, -4) is not actually in V, but no error occurred. This problem is caused by having `check=False` somewhere in the code, rather than `check=True`.  As a consequence of this, calls to f.lift() where V is the domain of f can result in elements not contained in V. 

The attached patch fixes both of these issues.

1. Can you change this to only do check=True when the base ring is *not* a field:

```
        5408	 	                    check=False, copy=False, coerce=False) 
 	5408	                    check=True, copy=False, coerce=False) 
```
Or, better yet, always do check=False unless the components of v are not all in the base ring.   The problem is that check=True could be *massively* expensive -- you could add hours to the runtimes of real-world computations with this one little change.  

2. I'm happy with all the other code.  

I'm running tests and will report in a moment.
