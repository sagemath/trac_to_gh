Let us define the following morphism over 3 letters:

```
sage: substitution=WordMorphism('a->b,b->ac,c->a')
```
Then we get

```
sage: substitution.is_primitive()
False
```
but also

```
sage: (substitution^2).is_primitive()
True
```

---

expected behaviour:

See the description of ".is_primitive()":
Returns True if self is primitive.
A morphism ϕ is primitive if there exists an positive integer k such
that for all α∈Σ, ϕk(α) contains all the letters of Σ.

So, if a morphism is primitive, so are all its powers. And if there is
a power which is primitive, so is the morphism itself. In the example
above, both outputs should be "True".

I just posted a patch which solves the described problem. The solution uses the following algorithm:

```
ALGORITHM: 
 
   Let `m` be the incidence matrix of a endomorphism on a monoid  
   of `d` letters. The endomorphism is primitive if and only if 
   there exists `k` such that `1 \leq k \leq (d-1)^2+1` and `m^k`  
   contains no zero. 
```

Are we sure this is true? Is there a proof of that somewhere?
