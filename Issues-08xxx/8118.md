The file ell_rational_field.py is huge and should be split up further. This is especially important for the documentation, currently it is not very user-friendy to find a function in the reference.

I propose a first change.

* The modular paratrization class goes into a separate file. (maybe the modular_degree should mover there too ?)

* The functions concerning the Galois representation are moved to a separate field. I changed the functions like `is_surjective` and `is_irreducible` to deprecated. I believe for instance the latter clashes with the irreducibility of the scheme E.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

This patch is my first proposal for changes.

It will also allow me to work more on the Galois representation side. For instance I deleted the second output of non-surjective since it was not used anywhere. I will build this in later in a different way, while also improving the outputs.

Let me know if you think these changes go too far.

What was the decision on deprecation policy of sage ? Is my handling here the correct one ?

What is a <code>\`TestSuite(s).run()\` doctest.</code> ? Where do I find the information on that ?

I have first to test it myself, before I set it to "needs review".

I don't understand this. I exported the patch after adding the two new files to hg. Then I apply it to a new clone.

 The patch applies fine and the tests pass. But when I do -docbuild reference html it tells me that it can not find the new files :

```
 /usr/local/sage/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/plane_curves.rst:7: (WARNING/2) toctree references unknown document u'sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/modular_parametrization'                                 
/usr/local/sage/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/plane_curves.rst:7: (WARNING/2) toctree references unknown document u'sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/gal_reps'     
```

 I must be doing something stupidly wrong. Help !

Attachment: **[trac_8118.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8118/trac_8118.patch.gz)**

I applied the patch to 4.3.2.alpha1:  OK with some fuzz on hunk #7.

Tests in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves:  all tests (includng long) pass.

sage -docbuild reference html worked fine for me (it warned about 

```
/home/jec/sage-4.3.2.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/geometry/polytope.rst:: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
/home/jec/sage-4.3.2.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/misc/attach.rst:: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree
```
but that's not from this patch!)

I have not actually looked at the html docs for the new files yet, but will do so.  Meanwhile: positive review.
