Ticket #8470 adds a collection of thematic tutorials to the Sage standard documentation. We should be able to browse such tutorials from the Sage command line or within the Sage notebook.

**Notes:** The current ticket needs to be coordinated with #8470. 

**Apply:**

* [attachment:trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch)
 
With the above patch, you should be able to read the documentation from the command line as follows:

```
sage: faq()
sage: thematic_tutorials() 
sage: funcprogramming_tutorial() 
sage: sage.groups.tutorial()
```

From IRC:

```
16:33 < mhansen> I don't think things like group_theory_tutorial should be at 
                 the top-level.
16:34 < mvngu> mhansen: Another way is: browse_sage_doc("group_theory_tutorial")
16:34 < mvngu> The original goal was to able to do sage.groups.tutorial()
16:35 < mvngu> But I can't figure out how to put the group theory tutorial 
               within the Sage library, and to also list it within the thematic 
               tutorials page.
16:40 < palmieri> Put this in sage/groups/__init__.py:  from sage.misc.sagedoc 
                  import browse_sage_doc
16:40 < palmieri> tutorial = browse_sage_doc.group_theory_tutorial
16:40 < mvngu> OK. Let try...
16:40 < palmieri> Put those two lines in sage/groups/__init__.py
16:41 < palmieri> Or maybe "from sage.misc.sagedoc import groups_tutorial as 
                  tutorial"
16:41 < mvngu> The last syntax looks better.

The attachment [trac_8533-browse-doc-take2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take2.patch) is another implementation different from the one in [trac_8533-browse-doc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc.patch). With [trac_8533-browse-doc-take2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take2.patch), you can do these:

* `sage.groups.tutorial()`
* `sage.combinat.lie_tutorial()`
* `sage.crypto.rsa_tutorial()`

That is, the above three tutorials are no longer available from the global name space. The above is closer to the original goal of being able to do "sage.groups.tutorial()" to get the group theory tutorial, etc. However, the FAQ and the index of thematic tutorials are still available in the global name space:

To see a list of tutorials that you could browse, use "browse_sage_doc.<tab>". Nevertheless, we still have the problem of listing thematic tutorials in the index of thematic tutorials. Could the second patch be seen as a compromise?

In addition to #8442, does this also depend on #8465 and #8469?  Without those, commands like `browse_sage_doc.funcprogramming_tutorial` (available via tab completion) don't work and give a message 

```
OSError: The document 'thematic_tutorials/functional_programming' does not exist.  Please build it
with 'sage -docbuild thematic_tutorials/functional_programming html --jsmath' and try again.
```
which is misleading, since that command won't succeed.

I have no idea if there is any good way to doctest functions like 

```
    def faq(self):
        """
        The Sage FAQ. A collection of frequently asked questions, together
        with answers to those questions.
        """
        self._open("faq")
```
It would be nice to not lower our coverage by including functions like this.  Here's an idea: replace the function by

```
faq = lambda self: self._open('faq')
```
Or is that cheating? This belongs on another ticket, in any case.

Given my understanding of the dependencies, this gets a positive review.

**Attachment:** [trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch)

The new patch [attachment:trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch) does the same thing as the previous two. But here are the changes in this new patch:

* Remove dependency on #8442 and #8469.
* Use John's idea of invoking a document using `lambda`.
* Allow for browsing the following documents from the command line: FAQ and all the thematic tutorials in the standard documentation so far.
* Doctesting the `lambda` functions that are used for browsing the FAQ and the thematic tutorials.
 
John's idea of invoking a document using `lambda` is not cheating at all. I implemented that for the FAQ and the extant thematic tutorials, and have provided doctests.



With [attachment:trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch) offering a completely new implementation, it renders John's previous positive review ineffective. Sorry, but I have to move this ticket to "needs review" again.
