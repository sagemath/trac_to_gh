Ticket #8470 adds a collection of thematic tutorials to the Sage standard documentation. We should be able to browse such tutorials from the Sage command line or within the Sage notebook.

**Notes:** The current ticket needs to be coordinated with #8470. 

**Apply:**

* [attachment: trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz)
 
With the above patch, you should be able to read the documentation from the command line as follows:

```
sage: faq()
sage: thematic_tutorials() 
sage: funcprogramming_tutorial() 
sage: sage.groups.tutorial()
```

From IRC:

```
16:33 < mhansen> I don't think things like group_theory_tutorial should be at 
                 the top-level.
16:34 < mvngu> mhansen: Another way is: browse_sage_doc("group_theory_tutorial")
16:34 < mvngu> The original goal was to able to do sage.groups.tutorial()
16:35 < mvngu> But I can't figure out how to put the group theory tutorial 
               within the Sage library, and to also list it within the thematic 
               tutorials page.
16:40 < palmieri> Put this in sage/groups/__init__.py:  from sage.misc.sagedoc 
                  import browse_sage_doc
16:40 < palmieri> tutorial = browse_sage_doc.group_theory_tutorial
16:40 < mvngu> OK. Let try...
16:40 < palmieri> Put those two lines in sage/groups/__init__.py
16:41 < palmieri> Or maybe "from sage.misc.sagedoc import groups_tutorial as 
                  tutorial"
16:41 < mvngu> The last syntax looks better.

In addition to #8442, does this also depend on #8465 and #8469?  Without those, commands like `browse_sage_doc.funcprogramming_tutorial` (available via tab completion) don't work and give a message 

```
OSError: The document 'thematic_tutorials/functional_programming' does not exist.  Please build it
with 'sage -docbuild thematic_tutorials/functional_programming html --jsmath' and try again.
```
which is misleading, since that command won't succeed.

I have no idea if there is any good way to doctest functions like 

```
    def faq(self):
        """
        The Sage FAQ. A collection of frequently asked questions, together
        with answers to those questions.
        """
        self._open("faq")
```
It would be nice to not lower our coverage by including functions like this.  Here's an idea: replace the function by

```
faq = lambda self: self._open('faq')
```
Or is that cheating? This belongs on another ticket, in any case.

Given my understanding of the dependencies, this gets a positive review.

Attachment: **[trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz)**

The new patch [attachment: trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz) does the same thing as the previous two. But here are the changes in this new patch:

* Remove dependency on #8442 and #8469.
* Use John's idea of invoking a document using `lambda`.
* Allow for browsing the following documents from the command line: FAQ and all the thematic tutorials in the standard documentation so far.
* Doctesting the `lambda` functions that are used for browsing the FAQ and the thematic tutorials.
 
John's idea of invoking a document using `lambda` is not cheating at all. I implemented that for the FAQ and the extant thematic tutorials, and have provided doctests.



With [attachment: trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz) offering a completely new implementation, it renders John's previous positive review ineffective. Sorry, but I have to move this ticket to "needs review" again.

On my mac: when I run doctests on sagedoc.py, my browser opens up several different windows.  I don't think this is a good idea.     Maybe the lines

```
    sage: faq() 
    sage: thematic_tutorials() 
    sage: funcprogramming_tutorial() 
    sage: sage.groups.tutorial() 
```
should be labeled `# not tested` instead?  Also, do we need to have `funcprogramming_tutorial()` as a top-level command, or is it good enough to have `thematic_tutorials()`?  (This is a genuine question: I don't know which way is better.)
