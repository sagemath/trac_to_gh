Ticket #8470 adds a collection of thematic tutorials to the Sage standard documentation. We should be able to browse such tutorials from the Sage command line or within the Sage notebook.

**Notes:** The current ticket needs to be coordinated with #8470. 

**Apply:**

* [attachment: trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz)
 
With the above patch, you should be able to read the documentation from the command line as follows:

```
sage: faq()
sage: thematic_tutorials() 
sage: funcprogramming_tutorial() 
sage: sage.groups.tutorial()
```

16:34 < mvngu> mhansen: Another way is: browse_sage_doc("group_theory_tutorial")
16:34 < mvngu> The original goal was to able to do sage.groups.tutorial()
16:35 < mvngu> But I can't figure out how to put the group theory tutorial 
               within the Sage library, and to also list it within the thematic 
               tutorials page.
16:40 < palmieri> Put this in sage/groups/__init__.py:  from sage.misc.sagedoc 
                  import browse_sage_doc
16:40 < palmieri> tutorial = browse_sage_doc.group_theory_tutorial
16:40 < mvngu> OK. Let try...
16:40 < palmieri> Put those two lines in sage/groups/__init__.py

```

        self._open("faq")
```
It would be nice to not lower our coverage by including functions like this.  Here's an idea: replace the function by

```
faq = lambda self: self._open('faq')
```
Or is that cheating? This belongs on another ticket, in any case.

Given my understanding of the dependencies, this gets a positive review.

Attachment: **[trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz)**

The new patch [attachment: trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8533/trac_8533-browse-doc-take3.patch.gz) does the same thing as the previous two. But here are the changes in this new patch:

* Remove dependency on #8442 and #8469.
* Use John's idea of invoking a document using `lambda`.
* Allow for browsing the following documents from the command line: FAQ and all the thematic tutorials in the standard documentation so far.
* Doctesting the `lambda` functions that are used for browsing the FAQ and the thematic tutorials.
 
John's idea of invoking a document using `lambda` is not cheating at all. I implemented that for the FAQ and the extant thematic tutorials, and have provided doctests.

Sorry, but I have to move this ticket to "needs review" again.
