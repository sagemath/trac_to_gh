There is a new spkg posted on trac #8644, but it doesn't fix this.

The fix is to replace the one instance (around line 2000) of

```
power::power
```
in src/ginac/functions.cpp with

```
GiNaC::power
```
This is evidently due to *better* checking of the proper namespace/scoping rules in GCC-4.5.0.

I made the above change, and Ginac builds fine.  Moreover, I ran this code:

```
sage: 1/tan(x)
```
and

```
sage: derivative(1/tan(x)).integrate(x)
1/tan(x)
```

According to the print statements I inserted into functions.cpp, the code that called power::power before is activated and is working correctly (no weird infinite recursions or anything).

I'm hoping this can just be given a positive review by Burcin and the fix rolled into the spkg at #8644, with a link from #8644 to this ticket.

Looks good to me.  There is a new spkg at

which incorporates this fix.  I've posted this to #8644.
