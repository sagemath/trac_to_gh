This is related to #188 and #2899.

```
sage: R=RealField(150)
sage: x=R(3493274823748475345934875398475345349.9343498375)
sage: y=round(x)
sage: y, type(y)
(3.49327482375e+36, <type 'sage.rings.real_double.RealDoubleElement'>)
sage: z=x.round()
sage: z, type(z)
(3493274823748475345934875398475345350, <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>)
```
If one performs `ZZ(y)` to convert `y` to an integer, one
has a huge loss of accuracy.

I see no point of forcing coercion to RDF, which has limited precision and exponent range.

I would expect `round(x)` to return the same value as `z`,
either as Integer or RealField.

it is fine for me that `round(x)` returns a float, however I don't understand why it returns
a float of fixed precision (RDF). It should then be called `RDF_round`. It would be more
natural to return a float with the same precision as the input.

I don't think it should return a float of fixed precision, it just so happened that the input was 53 bits. 

What I want is round(x) to call x.round() and possibly x.round(ndigits=ndigits), if available. Thus

```
sage: L = [RDF(pi), RealField(100)(pi), float(pi)]
sage: [x.round() for x in L if hasattr(x, 'round')]
[3, 3]
sage: [round(x) for x in L]
[3, 3, 3]

sage: [x.round(ndigits=2) for x in L if hasattr(x, 'round')]
[3.14, 3.1400000000000000000000000000]
sage: [round(x, ndigits=2) for x in L]
[3.14, 3.1400000000000000000000000000, 3.1400000000000001]
sage: [parent(round(x, ndigits=2)) is parent(x) for x in L]
[True, True, True]
```

Sometimes it seems it'd be quicker to just code this up than keep talking about it :).
