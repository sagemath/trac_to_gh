I think you should look at #8951 too.  It seems silly to have competing ECL packages, although of course they were addressing two different things.  Maybe there could be an immediate p0, or maybe that fix could be incorporated here?  It isn't a change to ECL, but just a change to how to determine if you build 64-bit on Solaris and a conditional removal of temp files, so either way of solving it seems reasonable.

I've updated #8951 so it includes both the changes here (upadate of ECL) and the changes on that ticket (remove /tmp/ECL*).

Just note that ticket #8645 is about the same issue. The ticket there is closed because the "src" directory there is not the same as in the official ECL distribution.

However, the instructions for making an ECL spkg explicitly mention that these directories should be removed. So, either change the instructions on building an ECL spkg or remove those directories from the spkg.

The reasons why those directories should be removed are mentioned in the instructions.
