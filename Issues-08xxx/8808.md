That patch just adds a Changelog entry.  This spkg has a different changelog entry (i.e., William updated this spkg, not Nils).  So this is a nonissue.

Just note that ticket #8645 is about the same issue. The ticket there is closed because the "src" directory there is not the same as in the official ECL distribution.

However, the instructions for making an ECL spkg explicitly mention that these directories should be removed. So, either change the instructions on building an ECL spkg or remove those directories from the spkg.

The reasons why those directories should be removed are mentioned in the instructions.
