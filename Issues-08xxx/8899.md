This patch includes quasi symmetric functions as well (see #11929).

Each algebra is implemented as a Hopf algebra with realizations (the realizations being the various bases of the algebras).

- Bases implemented for NCSF, and change of bases between them:

    - Complete
    - Ribbon
    - Elementary
    - Psi (power sums)
    - Phi (power sums)

- Bases implemented for QSym, and change of bases between them:

    - Monomial
    - Fundamental

There is also a method a_realization that returns a particular realization of the algebra. Computations that are not yet implemented in basis are performed by converting to a_realization(). Current implementation:

- NCSF.a_realization() returns the Complete basis
- QSym.a_realization() returns the Monomial basis

Dependencies:

- #12959 : provides the machinery for converting to a_realization for default implementations
- #13238 : integer matrices (required for the internal product in NCSF)
- #13243 : new methods for compositions

A note on the patch coproduct_with_realizations-fs.patch: an earlier version of this patch was folded into the patch at #5457. So this patch is not needed if that ticket gets merged before this ticket. (I've included it here so that the patchbot can run all doctests.)

If this ticket gets merged before #5457, then an easy rebase of #5457 will be required.

I think you guys need to add an entry in

doc/en/reference/combinat

so that NSym and QSym are included in the documentation!

Also, I spotted an OUTPUT without the : behind it. Aren't we supposed to use

INPUT:

- ``x`` -- explanation

i.e. a double dash after the variable to be explained?

Chris, can you fix the documentation as explained by Anne:

1. Add an entry in
 
        `doc/en/reference/combinat`
 
 so that NSym and QSym are included in the documentation!
 
2. Also, I spotted an OUTPUT without the : behind it.

3. Proper syntax for INPUT blocks:
 

         ```
         INPUT:
 
         - ``x`` -- explanation
        ```
 
i.e. a double dash after the variable to be explained [and a space after the initial dash]

Two new small patches.

1. `trac_11929_8899-fix_skewby-fs.patch:` Fixes things so that the following raises an error:

```
F([2,1]).skew_by([1])
```

2. `trac_11929_8899-add_degree_to_elementmethods-fs.patch:` addes `ElementMethods.degree` and `ElementMethods.is_homogeneous` to `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis` (I extracted these from a separate patch on the sage-combinat queue).

**Outstanding question about the degree of an element:** what do we want as the default behaviour? Should it:
a. raise an error if the element is not homogeneous; or
b. return the maximum of the degrees of the homogeneous summands?

Based on the [discussion on sage-combinat-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-combinat-devel/pTjdBFeePWg/discussion), I updated [attachment:trac_11929_8899-add_degree_to_elementmethods-fs.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8899/trac_11929_8899-add_degree_to_elementmethods-fs.patch):
- add methods `maximal_degree` and `homogeneous_degree` in `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis`
- as a default in `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis`, set `degree = homogeneous_degree`
- for NCSF/QSym, `degree` is redefined to be `maximal_degree`

The patch [attachment: trac_11929_8899-modify_duality_method_names-fs.patch] modifies the duality method names to conform to #13372. Namely:

- `object.dual` returns the dual object:

```
sage: N.dual()
Quasisymmetric functions over the Rational Field
sage: S.dual()
Quasisymmetric functions over the Rational Field on the Monomial basis
sage: R.dual()
Quasisymmetric functions over the Rational Field on the Fundamental basis
```

- `dual_pairing` became `duality_pairing`

And I created one more that makes changes to the documentation, adds some doctests, etc.\n\n*So please review this last patch: [attachment:trac_11929_8899-additional_documentation-fs.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8899/trac_11929_8899-additional_documentation-fs.patch).*\n\nHere is a summary of the changes:\n\n- I noticed that some of the bases of NCSF and QSym had no documentation when one asks for the documentation using the command:\n\n  `NCSF.Ribbon?`\n\n  So I fixed that for all the bases.\n\n- In a few places, you used the letter F to refer to an arbitrary quasi-symmetric function. Since this is the prefix for the Fundamental basis, I decided to change this to another letter (I used H).\n\n- I made a some changes to your tutorial that I hope improve the exposition.",

Hello Mike,

Thank you very much for your review, and your improvements to the documentation!

I folded all the patches that you've seen, including your patch. And I created one more that makes changes to the documentation, adds some doctests, etc.

*So please review this last patch: [attachment:trac_11929_8899-additional_documentation-fs.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8899/trac_11929_8899-additional_documentation-fs.patch).*

Here is a summary of the changes:

- I noticed that some of the bases of NCSF and QSym had no documentation when one asks for the documentation using the command:

  `NCSF.Ribbon?`

  So I fixed that for all the bases.

- In a few places, you used the letter F to refer to an arbitrary quasi-symmetric function. Since this is the prefix for the Fundamental basis, I decided to change this to another letter (I used H).

- I made a some changes to your tutorial that I hope improve the exposition.

I folded the additional documentation patches (mine and Mike's) into the main patch since Mike gave mine a positive review and I positively reviewed Mike's changes.

And I posted one more patch that adds a new method `from_polynomial` to QSym.

> Does that mean #9107 should be a dependency?

I would not bother. There are already plenty of spots in Sage where the documentation does not build properly because of improper support for nested classes; this just adds another occurence. And everything will be fixed at once when #9107 will be merged, with no action to be taken on those spots.

Cheers,
               Nicolas

This patch is ready to go, so I'm setting the milestone to sage-5.3 (instead of sage-wishlist).

An *unrelated* test failed on one of the patchbots, but I think this is just a glitch. I tried kicking it, so we'll see what happens. Is it necessary that all patchbots be happy before the patch is merged?

I checked the patch, and am ok with it. Thanks Franco!

Assuming that all tests pass (the failures currently reported by the patchbot seem unrelated), you can set it back to positive review on my behalf!

I know that #13404 claims not to have been merged yet, but did you happen to merge it in sage-5.4.beta1? I think that ticket would have caused this change in the `_repr_`.

I always test a bunch of tickets together, and in this case I included indeed #13404.  So I will remove #13404 for now.

This patch abuses `assert` and `AssertionError`. `assert` should not be used for control flow. An `assert` checks something which should always be true, a failed assertion is always a bug in the program.

For example:

```
                sage: R = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(QQ).R()
                sage: R.skew([2,1], [1])
                Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
                AssertionError: x must be an element of Non-Commutative Symmetric Functions over the Rational Field
```
This is a simple user mistake, for which `assert` is not right.

I think this must be fixed.

I guess that's ok after all. See the same comment on  #5457.

This is a better example from this patch on how *not* to use assert:

```
            try:
                assert self.is_homogeneous()
                return self.parent().degree_on_basis(self.leading_support())
            except AssertionError:
                raise ValueError("Element is not homogeneous.")
```

And this is an easily made mistake, it should give a `TypeError`:

```
def from_polynomial(self, f, check=True):
    ...
    assert self.base_ring() == f.base_ring()
```
You could even do:

```
if check and self.base_ring() != f.base_ring():
    raise TypeError(...)
```
