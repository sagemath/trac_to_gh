This patch includes quasi symmetric functions as well (see #11929).

Each algebra is implemented as a Hopf algebra with realizations (the realizations being the various bases of the algebras).

- Bases implemented for NCSF, and change of bases between them:

    - Complete
    - Ribbon
    - Elementary
    - Psi (power sums)
    - Phi (power sums)

- Bases implemented for QSym, and change of bases between them:

    - Monomial
    - Fundamental

There is also a method a_realization that returns a particular realization of the algebra. Computations that are not yet implemented in basis are performed by converting to a_realization(). Current implementation:

- NCSF.a_realization() returns the Complete basis
- QSym.a_realization() returns the Monomial basis

Dependencies:

- #12959 : provides the machinery for converting to a_realization for default implementations
- #13238 : integer matrices (required for the internal product in NCSF)
- #13243 : new methods for compositions

I think you guys need to add an entry in

doc/en/reference/combinat

so that NSym and QSym are included in the documentation!

Also, I spotted an OUTPUT without the : behind it. Aren't we supposed to use

INPUT:

- ``x`` -- explanation

i.e. a double dash after the variable to be explained?

I rebased [attachment:trac_11929_8899-ncsf-qsym-fs.patch] on #12959.

Chris, can you fix the documentation as explained by Anne:

1. Add an entry in
 
        `doc/en/reference/combinat`
 
 so that NSym and QSym are included in the documentation!
 
2. Also, I spotted an OUTPUT without the : behind it.

3. Proper syntax for INPUT blocks:
 

         ```
         INPUT:
 
         - ``x`` -- explanation
        ```
 
i.e. a double dash after the variable to be explained [and a space after the initial dash]

Two new small patches.

1. `trac_11929_8899-fix_skewby-fs.patch:` Fixes things so that the following raises an error:

```
F([2,1]).skew_by([1])
```

2. `trac_11929_8899-add_degree_to_elementmethods-fs.patch:` addes `ElementMethods.degree` and `ElementMethods.is_homogeneous` to `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis` (I extracted these from a separate patch on the sage-combinat queue).

**Outstanding question about the degree of an element:** what do we want as the default behaviour? Should it:
a. raise an error if the element is not homogeneous; or
b. return the maximum of the degrees of the homogeneous summands?

Based on the [discussion on sage-combinat-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-combinat-devel/pTjdBFeePWg/discussion), I updated [attachment:trac_11929_8899-add_degree_to_elementmethods-fs.patch]:
- add methods `maximal_degree` and `homogeneous_degree` in `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis`
- as a default in `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis`, set `degree = homogeneous_degree`
- for NCSF/QSym, `degree` is redefined to be `maximal_degree`

The patch [attachment: trac_11929_8899-modify_duality_method_names-fs.patch] modifies the duality method names to conform to #13372. Namely:

- `object.dual` returns the dual object:

```
sage: N.dual()
Quasisymmetric functions over the Rational Field
sage: S.dual()
Quasisymmetric functions over the Rational Field on the Monomial basis
sage: R.dual()
Quasisymmetric functions over the Rational Field on the Fundamental basis
```

- `dual_pairing` became `duality_pairing`

Hello Mike,

Thank you very much for your review, and your improvements to the documentation!

I folded all the patches that you've seen, including your patch. And I created one more that makes changes to the documentation, adds some doctests, etc.

*So please review this last patch: [attachment:trac_11929_8899-additional_documentation-fs.patch].*

Here is a summary of the changes:

- I noticed that some of the bases of NCSF and QSym had no documentation when one asks for the documentation using the command:

  `NCSF.Ribbon?`

  So I fixed that for all the bases.

- In a few places, you used the letter F to refer to an arbitrary quasi-symmetric function. Since this is the prefix for the Fundamental basis, I decided to change this to another letter (I used H).

- I made a some changes to your tutorial that I hope improve the exposition.

I folded the additional documentation patches (mine and Mike's) into the main patch since Mike gave mine a positive review and I positively reviewed Mike's changes.

And I posted one more patch that adds a new method `from_polynomial` to QSym.

Only the patch [attachment:trac_11929_8899-from_polynomial-fs.patch] needs review.

This patch is ready to go, so I'm setting the milestone to sage-5.3 (instead of sage-wishlist).

An *unrelated* test failed on one of the patchbots, but I think this is just a glitch. I tried kicking it, so we'll see what happens. Is it necessary that all patchbots be happy before the patch is merged?

I double-checked, and the phrase "in the Schur basis" does not appear in the patches on this ticket.

I know that #13404 claims not to have been merged yet, but did you happen to merge it in sage-5.4.beta1? I think that ticket would have caused this change in the `_repr_`.

I always test a bunch of tickets together, and in this case I included indeed #13404.  So I will remove #13404 for now.

This patch abuses `assert` and `AssertionError`. `assert` should not be used for control flow. An `assert` checks something which should always be true, a failed assertion is always a bug in the program.

For example:

```
                sage: R = NonCommutativeSymmetricFunctions(QQ).R()
                sage: R.skew([2,1], [1])
                Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
                AssertionError: x must be an element of Non-Commutative Symmetric Functions over the Rational Field
```
This is a simple user mistake, for which `assert` is not right.

I think this must be fixed.

I guess that's ok after all. See the same comment on  #5457.

This is a better example from this patch on how *not* to use assert:

```
            try:
                assert self.is_homogeneous()
                return self.parent().degree_on_basis(self.leading_support())
            except AssertionError:
                raise ValueError("Element is not homogeneous.")
```

And this is an easily made mistake, it should give a `TypeError`:

```
def from_polynomial(self, f, check=True):
    ...
    assert self.base_ring() == f.base_ring()
```
You could even do:

```
if check and self.base_ring() != f.base_ring():
    raise TypeError(...)
```
