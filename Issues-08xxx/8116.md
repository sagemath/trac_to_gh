If $SAGE64 = "yes" we need CFLAGS=-m64 on Open Solaris.

So if I understand you correctly we need a properly installed Python. I have to hack a bit to get a working Python in Open Solaris.

Why not unset CFLAGS in the Cython spkg-install?

Without CFLAGS set building cython failes on Open Solaris x64!

*.pyx files? I don't get sage-4.3.1.alpha build :)!

So let's get Python build correctly on Open Solaris x64!

Yes. Worrying about Cython working before Python is set up correctly is probably going to be an exercise in futility.

For fear of breaking things. I am not an expert on distutils or building stuff, so for me the safest path is to not change stuff.

Do you get a working Cython with CFLAGS set? (If so, it might just be lucky...) What errors do you get otherwise? (I think Cython's supposed to fall back to a pure Python setup if the compile fails, but I could be remembering wrong.)

> *.pyx files? I don't get sage-4.3.1.alpha build :)!

Yet :)

I'm just pointing out that whatever issues we're running into here, we'll be running into later with the sage library. 

> So let's get Python build correctly on Open Solaris x64!

Sounds like the best course of action.

I do have a working Python! But I don't know it is setup properly :(

This is a distutils question, nothing specific to Cython. Hopefully we can get to the root of the issue, as many packages are "python setup.py install"

I rebuilt python with in the spkg-install Darwin changed to SunOS.

Python buidls ok now with the right CFLAGS set.

Rebuilding cython was ok.

So in principle problem solved!

I close the ticket as invalid.
