This patch adds the categories Magmas() and AdditiveMagmas()
(sets with a plain binary operation * or +).

It factors out some of the code previously in Semigroups / CommutativeAdditiveSemigroups.

This is used by the updated #7555 to make it more general.

Depends trivially on #7880.

**CC:**  sage-combinat @roed314

**Keywords:** categories, magma

**Author:** Nicolas M. Thi√©ry

**Reviewer:** Robert Beezer, Florent Hivert

Hi Nicolas,

I get about 10 "hunk failures" trying to apply this to a stock 4.3.4.

I noticed a "-git" in the diff commands in the patch, which I don't see in the patches I usually make.  Is it it me, or does this patch need some attention?

Rob

This passes all tests on 4.3.4.final and docs build without any problems.  It also works well when the fairly extensive #7555 is applied on top of it.  So there should be no surprises for the interested reviewer.

I can't say at the moment that I know enough about implementing categories to verify its completeness, so right now it either (a) needs a quick review from a knowledgeable category specialist, or (b) I need to get more education on categories so #7555 can go in.

Thanks for checking this.

> I can't say at the moment that I know enough about implementing categories to verify its completeness, so right now it either (a) needs a quick review from a knowledgeable category specialist, or (b) I need to get more education on categories so #7555 can go in.

From the category implementation point of view, everything looks fine upto the
following small problem which can be left for a future patch: the
`SubQuotient` code in `Semigroups()` is sufficiently general to work
in magmas (computing product by lifting/retracting). It should be moved in
`Magmas()`.

Otherwise, I'm okay to give a positive review. I'll ask Nicolas directly.
