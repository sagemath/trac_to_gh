```
This patch adds the categories Magmas() and AdditiveMagmas()
(sets with a plain binary operation * or +).

It factors out some of the code previously in Semigroups / CommutativeAdditiveSemigroups.

This is used by the updated #7555 to make it more general.

Depends trivially on #7880.

Hi Nicolas,

I get about 10 "hunk failures" trying to apply this to a stock 4.3.4.

I noticed a "-git" in the diff commands in the patch, which I don't see in the patches I usually make.  Is it it me, or does this patch need some attention?

Rob

I can't say at the moment that I know enough about implementing categories to verify its completeness, so right now it either (a) needs a quick review from a knowledgeable category specialist, or (b) I need to get more education on categories so #7555 can go in.

Thanks for checking this.

> I can't say at the moment that I know enough about implementing categories to verify its completeness, so right now it either (a) needs a quick review from a knowledgeable category specialist, or (b) I need to get more education on categories so #7555 can go in.

From the category implementation point of view, everything looks fine upto the
following small problem which can be left for a future patch: the
`SubQuotient` code in `Semigroups()` is sufficiently general to work
in magmas (computing product by lifting/retracting). It should be moved in
`Magmas()`.

Otherwise, I'm okay to give a positive review. I'll ask Nicolas directly.
