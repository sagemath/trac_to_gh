I have attached a patch that includes information from [how-to-develop.txt](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8108/how-to-develop.txt). I also added more stuff, which means I can no longer review Rob's work. What's missing is a section on patch management using Mercurial queue. That could be for a separate ticket if necessary.
