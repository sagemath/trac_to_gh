MPFR 2.4.2 has the fix posted in that thread.  I've made an spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/cygwin_port/mpfr-2.4.2.spkg

I'm building it now to test to see if it works.

> I just check and all tests pass on Cygwin with MPFR 2.4.2.


I have verified this on winxp1 on boxen.math. The Sage 4.3.4.alpha0 build failed when trying to compile the gd spkg. That didn't prevent me from manually installing your upgraded MPFR spkg. First, I set these environment variables:

```
export SAGE_PORT=yes
export SAGE_CHECK=yes
```
Then I forced an installation with

```
./sage -f /URL/to/mpfr-2.4.2.spkg
```
The build went OK and the test suite of MPFR passed. I'll now test on t2.math and some other machines.

The upgraded MPFR spkg builds on sage.math, t2.math, bsd.math, rosemary.math, and Cygwin (winxp1 on boxen.math). First, I set the environment variable

```
export SAGE_CHECK=yes
```
and forced a re-installation with

```
./sage -f /URL/or/path/to/mpfr-2.4.2.spkg
```
The build went OK and the test suite of MPFR passed without any reported failures.

**Note to release manager:** Use the package at
