From [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/4f822bba45432f7b):

```
So, what you are saying is that the iterator for graphs() does not
return independent graphs which can be changed without affecting the
others.
That does explain what I am seeing and is consistent with Pat
LeSmith's suggested workaround.

Should this property of the iterators to the generated graphs be
documented?

So, I think I will try making a copy of just the graphs I want to
change or use the list() trick.

Helloooooo !!!

This is a good patch, but I do not think the documentation is very clear. What would you think of changing the new argument's name to "return_copies" or "graph_copy" ? To be honest I took me 2 minutes to understand that this message's title did not mean "The independent graph is not returned by graphs(n)" `:-p`

Either way, with a name like "independent" it is not very clear that there may be performances issues hidden in this argument.

Here's what I would write. Of course, it's just my advice, so take or leave whatever you want :

```
- ``copy_graphs`` (boolean) -- If set to ``True`` (default) this method makes copies of the graphs before returning them. If set to ``False`` the method returns the graph it is working on. The second alternative is faster, but modifying any of the graph instances returned by the method may break the function's behaviour, as it is using these graphs to compute the next ones : only use ``copy_graph = False`` when you stick to *reading* the graphs returned.
```

Please tell me what you think `:-)`

Arg.... It's all written on one line. Stupid me. Here it is :

```
- ``copy_graphs`` (boolean) -- If set to ``True`` (default)
   this method makes copies of the graphs before returning 
   them. If set to ``False`` the method returns the graph it
   is working on. The second alternative is faster, but modifying
   any of the graph instances returned by the method may break
   the function's behaviour, as it is using these graphs to 
   compute the next ones : only use ``copy_graph = False`` when
   you stick to *reading* the graphs returned.
