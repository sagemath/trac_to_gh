From [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/4f822bba45432f7b):

```
So, what you are saying is that the iterator for graphs() does not
return independent graphs which can be changed without affecting the
others.
That does explain what I am seeing and is consistent with Pat
LeSmith's suggested workaround.

Should this property of the iterators to the generated graphs be
documented?

So, I think I will try making a copy of just the graphs I want to
change or use the list() trick.

This is an unintended consequence of the fact that when the `graphs(n)` iterator yields a graph, it does not first make a copy. The method of generating graphs is to add on to previously generated graphs in a well-chosen way, and I did not think to make a copy of the graph before having the iterator yield it.

This shouldn't just be documented, but in fact I think this should be an option to `graphs(n)`. If someone will not modify the graphs in the loop, they can get the speed advantage of not making copies, and someone else who wants to modify them can have the iterator make copies on the fly.

Helloooooo !!!

This is a good patch, but I do not think the documentation is very clear. What would you think of changing the new argument's name to "return_copies" or "graph_copy" ? To be honest I took me 2 minutes to understand that this message's title did not mean "The independent graph is not returned by graphs(n)" `:-p`

Either way, with a name like "independent" it is not very clear that there may be performances issues hidden in this argument.

Here's what I would write. Of course, it's just my advice, so take or leave whatever you want :

```
- ``copy_graphs`` (boolean) -- If set to ``True`` (default) this method makes copies of the graphs before returning them. If set to ``False`` the method returns the graph it is working on. The second alternative is faster, but modifying any of the graph instances returned by the method may break the function's behaviour, as it is using these graphs to compute the next ones : only use ``copy_graph = False`` when you stick to *reading* the graphs returned.
```

Please tell me what you think `:-)`

Arg.... It's all written on one line. Stupid me. Here it is :

```
- ``copy_graphs`` (boolean) -- If set to ``True`` (default)
   this method makes copies of the graphs before returning 
   them. If set to ``False`` the method returns the graph it
   is working on. The second alternative is faster, but modifying
   any of the graph instances returned by the method may break
   the function's behaviour, as it is using these graphs to 
   compute the next ones : only use ``copy_graph = False`` when
   you stick to *reading* the graphs returned.

If you think that "copy" is better, I don't mind. I thought that a consumer of the library doesn't care about what is the way we create the graphs (that we copy them), so the relevant property of the output is rather independence. The proposed description is also good.
