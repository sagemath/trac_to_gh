The patch works, I have checked that it passes all tests, and html and
pdf manual builds. This is my first attempt to review a ticket
however, and I stumbled upon 2 problems:

Is the documentation for these functions actually in the reference
manual? I wanted to check that the newly generated files looked good,
but could not find the place. Maybe I am just blind...

Typing sage.functions.log.Function_log? + TAB in the notebook (Linux
box with Firefox 3.6.3) the TESTS section (where some of the
documentation of the patch appear) is messed up. This also happens for
me without this patch, though.

The docstring was messed up because of the missing `r` before starting the string. [attachment:trac_8297-sfunction_extra_paranthesis.take2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8297/trac_8297-sfunction_extra_paranthesis.take2.patch) fixes this.

I don't know why the documentation for these functions don't show up in the reference manual. I suggest opening a new ticket for that.
