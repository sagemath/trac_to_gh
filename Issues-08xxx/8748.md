This patch implements LP formulations of Linear Arboricity and Acyclic edge coloring

Nathann Thank you.I got it.

This ticket is the same as #8405. The latter got spam content and the spammer closed the ticket. It would be more trouble and result in confusion to reopen the ticket. So I have moved the ticket over to this one.

Yet another graph constructor from networkx, with {} instead of None as labels. A g.edges(labels = False) did the trick :-)

Sorry abou that !
