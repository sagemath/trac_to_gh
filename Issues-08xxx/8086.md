I do have a working numpy on your machine.

There is a numpy-1.3.0.p3.spkg in trac waiting to be merged.

Here is a pre version of mine:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/ports/numpy-1.3.0.p3.spkg

Works on Open Solaris.

Hi Jaap,

I'm having a problem with this. I got a message about "could not fork". I even rebooted the machine once, thinking something was wrong, but everything else seems to work. 


Is this bit of code in the patch right? It looks wrong to me:

```
echo "#! /usr/bin/env bash" > gcc 
echo "`which gcc` -m64 " | sed 's/$/\$@/' >> fake_gcc 
```

Should the first line not write to the file 'fake_gcc' rather than 'gcc'? If so, since it gets copied to $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc, why not write it directly there? 

i.e.

```
echo "#! /usr/bin/env bash" > $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc
echo "`which gcc` -m64 " | sed 's/$/\$@/' >> $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc 
```

Also, why use 'sed'? If I understand your intentions correctly, 

```
echo "`which gcc` -m64 \$@"
```

would achieve the same, but without invoking 'sed'. 

I would also add that 'which' is not a POSIX command, whereas 'command -v' gives you the same information, but in a standards complient way. This can be important, especially on Solaris 10, as the return code of 'which' is undefined on there. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ echo "`command -v gcc` -m64 \$@" 
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4/bin/gcc -m64 $@
```

is more portable. 

However, I can't seem to get it to work. I'm not sure if I understand exactly what you are aiming to do here. Why do we need a fake gcc? 

Dave

Jaap, 

I can't get your patch to work, so have reimplemented this. I've completely removed the file fake_gcc from Numpy, and instead create the fake file dynamically with the correct path. 

I've also reported the issue to the Numpy bug database. 

http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/1525

which should have been done years ago when the problem was first realised in OS X. 

Here's a package waiting for review, which I believe does fix the problem.

## Great news

I've found a much simpler solution to this, which totally avoids using any fake gcc files. Just compile with

CC="gcc -m64"
export CC

and it works! I will attach a simpler patch in 15 minutes. I'm marking as "needs work" for now, as I need to do something else just now.
