## Build environment
* Sun Ultra 27 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_111b X86
* Sage 4.3.1 (with a few packages hacked to work on 64-bit)
* gcc 4.3.4 configured with Sun linker and GNU assembler from binutils version 2.20.
* 64-bit build. SAGE64 was set to yes, plus various other tricks to get -m64 into packages. 
## The problem
numpy is failing to build. It looks like there is a mix of 32 and 64-bit objects.

I do have a working numpy on your machine.

There is a numpy-1.3.0.p3.spkg in trac waiting to be merged.

Here is a pre version of mine:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/ports/numpy-1.3.0.p3.spkg

Works on Open Solaris.

Hi Jaap,

I'm having a problem with this. I got a message about "could not fork". I even rebooted the machine once, thinking something was wrong, but everything else seems to work. 


Is this bit of code in the patch right? It looks wrong to me:

```
echo "#! /usr/bin/env bash" > gcc 
echo "`which gcc` -m64 " | sed 's/$/\$@/' >> fake_gcc 
```

Should the first line not write to the file 'fake_gcc' rather than 'gcc'? If so, since it gets copied to $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc, why not write it directly there? 

i.e.

```
echo "#! /usr/bin/env bash" > $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc
echo "`which gcc` -m64 " | sed 's/$/\$@/' >> $SAGE_LOCAL/bin/gcc 
```

Also, why use 'sed'? If I understand your intentions correctly, 

```
echo "`which gcc` -m64 \$@"
```

would achieve the same, but without invoking 'sed'. 

I would also add that 'which' is not a POSIX command, whereas 'command -v' gives you the same information, but in a standards complient way. This can be important, especially on Solaris 10, as the return code of 'which' is undefined on there. 

```
drkirkby@hawk:~$ echo "`command -v gcc` -m64 \$@" 
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.4/bin/gcc -m64 $@
```

is more portable. 

However, I can't seem to get it to work. I'm not sure if I understand exactly what you are aiming to do here. Why do we need a fake gcc?

Jaap, 

I can't get your patch to work, so have reimplemented this. I've completely removed the file fake_gcc from Numpy, and instead create the fake file dynamically with the correct path. 

I've also reported the issue to the Numpy bug database. 

http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/1525

which should have been done years ago when the problem was first realised in OS X. 

Here's a package waiting for review, which I believe does fix the problem. 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/numpy-1.3.0.p4.spkg

## Great news

I've found a much simpler solution to this, which totally avoids using any fake gcc files. Just compile with

CC="gcc -m64"
export CC

and it works! I will attach a simpler patch in 15 minutes. I'm marking as "needs work" for now, as I need to do something else just now.
