TOPCOM is a C++ program for triangulating polyhedra. More generally, it can find a single triangulation as well as enumerate all triangulations of a "point configuration", that is, the convex hull of points in euclidean space such that all vertices of simplices of the triangulation are in the given (finite) list of points.

One problem with the upstream distribution is that it statically links many helper programs, yielding almost 200mb of binaries. Therefore, I changed the TOPCOM build system to dynamically link TOPCOM via libtools to reduce size

My libtoolized TOPCOM spkg is here:

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/TOPCOM-0.16.2.p2.spkg

None of the patches in this ticket should be applied to the Sage library! The TOPCOM binaries are (optionally) used by the patches in #9918: triangulate point configurations.

This looks great.  I looked into TOPCOM briefly but because of its size and some build issues I gave up thinking about it.  I don't have time to review this week, but I will try to take a look at it soon.

Thanks to a contribution by Josh Whitney we can now compute volumes and the secondary polytope.

Still todo: the TOPCOM spkg crashes when checking for coherency/regularity of a triangulation, investigating...

I'll try to add the 64-bit stuff and a spkg-check. The examples are huge (the upstream distribution is 22M gzipped), but we probably should keep some for the check. 

Since the intention is to eventually move the changes upstream I would prefer to move the deprecated `configure.in` to `configure.ac`. We do copy `patches/autogenerated/configure` over the configure script.

As for the bus error, I don't have a OSX machine to test on. But running points2placingtriangs in gdb and producing a stack trace would probably help.

I do not plan to review this ticket since it involves a package, but I'll allow myself some critical remarks anyway ;-)

1. Module level description is probably not what it was supposed to be ("all vertices of points" does not quite make sense).
2. It would be nice to explain what's the point of using projective coordinates even when the input is affine.
3. I think it is counter-intuitive that iterating over a point configuration deals with projective coordinates and over its points - affine ones. If the default input is affine, I think that default iterating also should be over affine version with `points(projective=True)` returning projective coordinates.
4. I personally don't like getting generators as output of methods like `points` and people less familiar with Python find it quite confusing. So I think it would be better to return a tuple (or a list, if it is not cached) and obtain a generator either using something like `point_generator()` method or by passing an optional argument like `points(generator=True)`. I understand that generators are more efficient, but when efficiency is an issue users should be willing to work a little harder to get them, while for interactive work and new users tuples and lists are more convenient.
5. I like the interface to restricting type of triangulations, but it would be nice for each restricting function to have a precise definition of the corresponding triangulation type.

P.S. My previous attempts to install and use TOPCOM didn't succeed, but with Volker's package installation was completely painless. So I hope that it will make its way into Sage in the near future!

I am wondering what the point of the function "liststring" is in the _TOPCOM_points method.  Seems like overkill to make this function given the very limited way its used.  

I still haven't fixed the build on OS X; on the TOPCOM page it says "The current version compiles successfully under Darwin gcc-4.0 and gcc-4.2 if you choose the -m32 or -m64 architecture manually for all libraries." - which maybe means that we need to add such flags somewhere.

I think this is a bug in the secondary polytope code, maybe from the optional argument reduce_dimension not being set correctly in the LatticePolytope call.

```
c = polytopes.n_cube(3)
p = PointConfiguration(c.vertices())
p.secondary_polytope()
```

...this results in:

```
RuntimeError: Error executing "poly.x -fv" for a polytope sequence!
Output:
poly.x: Vertex.c:613: Finish_Find_Equations: Assertion `_V->nv<64' failed.

A similar command with an octahedron instead of a cube works fine.

I was checking some things from the TOPCOM examples, and this seems odd:

```
sage: q = [[0,0,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1],[2,4,8,16,32,1],[3,9,27,81,243,1],[4,16,64,256,1024,1],[5,25,125,625,3125,1],[6,36,216,1296,7776,1],[7,49,343,2401,16807,1],[8,64,512,4096,32768,1],[9,81,729,6561,59049,1],[10,100,1000,10000,100000,1]]
sage: p = PointConfiguration(q)
sage: t = p.triangulations_list()
sage: len(t)

This is a 5-dimensional point configuration with 11 points.  Shouldn't it have some triangulations?

Here's a simpler example with similar problems.

```
sage: p = [[0,0,0,1],[0,3,0,1],[3,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,3,1,1],[3,0,1,1],[1,1,2,1]]
sage: pc = PointConfiguration(p)
sage: t = pc.triangulations_list()
sage: len(t)
0
```

And this blows up:

```
sage: pc.restrict_to_nonregular_triangulations()
sage: t = pc.triangulations_list()
```

Is this the same problem that is noted by the line:
\# TOPCOM bug: points2alltriangs --nonregular does not work

I've split off a self-contained triangulation module into #9918. This ticket will focus on getting the TOPCOM spkg build on all platforms. In particular, OSX seems to be broken at the moment. 

I still don't have access to an OSX machine, but will get this sorted out eventually...

Thanks for testing!

The precise version of the sage<->TOPCOM interface in #9918 should not matter. Of course you need *some* version, or there is no interface.

In case anyone else wants to give it a try: Since TOPCOM compiled correctly it should work.
