TOPCOM is a C++ program for triangulating polyhedra. More generally, it can find a single triangulation as well as enumerate all triangulations of a "point configuration", that is, the convex hull of points in euclidean space such that all vertices of simplices of the triangulation are in the given (finite) list of points.

One problem with the upstream distribution is that it statically links many helper programs, yielding almost 200mb of binaries. Therefore, I changed the TOPCOM build system to dynamically link TOPCOM via libtools to reduce size

My libtoolized TOPCOM spkg is here:

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/TOPCOM-0.16.2.p2.spkg

None of the patches in this ticket should be applied to the Sage library! The TOPCOM binaries are (optionally) used by the patches in #9918: triangulate point configurations.

I get the following coverage issues, which I would be happy to work on if you don't mind:

```
SCORE devel/sage-p1/sage/geometry//triangulation.py: 66% (14 of 21)

Missing documentation:

Missing doctests:

Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):

I didn't see any errors relating to this during compilation; not sure what is going on.

Take a look at spkg-install of the latest GSL library for an example how to do it. \n* There's no spkg-check file. It is possible to add one? I note you delete the examples, but often those can be used in tests of the package. \n* You appear to copy over configure.ac, but no configure script. Is that intentional? Whilst I agree configure.ac is the preferred usage over configure.in, I'm not sure its actually worth patching that. I think the patch will cause more confusion. If you have actually patched the file, then sure, call it configure.ac. But in that case the configure script will need to be updated too. \n* Since we don't ship GMP, I think the dependencies should list MPIR rather than GMP, or at least have a note like \"MPIR (used in Sage instead of GMP)\"",

A few comments. 
* There appears to be no code for 64-bit builds on systems which don't default to 64-bit, but want it. Take a look at spkg-install of the latest GSL library for an example how to do it. 
* There's no spkg-check file. It is possible to add one? I note you delete the examples, but often those can be used in tests of the package. 
* You appear to copy over configure.ac, but no configure script. Is that intentional? Whilst I agree configure.ac is the preferred usage over configure.in, I'm not sure its actually worth patching that. I think the patch will cause more confusion. If you have actually patched the file, then sure, call it configure.ac. But in that case the configure script will need to be updated too. 
* Since we don't ship GMP, I think the dependencies should list MPIR rather than GMP, or at least have a note like "MPIR (used in Sage instead of GMP)"

<div id="comment:15" align="right">Comment 15</div>

I do not plan to review this ticket since it involves a package, but I'll allow myself some critical remarks anyway ;-)

1. Module level description is probably not what it was supposed to be ("all vertices of points" does not quite make sense).
2. It would be nice to explain what's the point of using projective coordinates even when the input is affine.
3. I think it is counter-intuitive that iterating over a point configuration deals with projective coordinates and over its points - affine ones. If the default input is affine, I think that default iterating also should be over affine version with `points(projective=True)` returning projective coordinates.
4. I personally don't like getting generators as output of methods like `points` and people less familiar with Python find it quite confusing. So I think it would be better to return a tuple (or a list, if it is not cached) and obtain a generator either using something like `point_generator()` method or by passing an optional argument like `points(generator=True)`. I understand that generators are more efficient, but when efficiency is an issue users should be willing to work a little harder to get them, while for interactive work and new users tuples and lists are more convenient.
5. I like the interface to restricting type of triangulations, but it would be nice for each restricting function to have a precise definition of the corresponding triangulation type.

P.S. My previous attempts to install and use TOPCOM didn't succeed, but with Volker's package installation was completely painless. So I hope that it will make its way into Sage in the near future!

I think this is a bug in the secondary polytope code, maybe from the optional argument reduce_dimension not being set correctly in the LatticePolytope call.

```
c = polytopes.n_cube(3)
p = PointConfiguration(c.vertices())
p.secondary_polytope()
```

...this results in:

```
RuntimeError: Error executing "poly.x -fv" for a polytope sequence!

A similar command with an octahedron instead of a cube works fine.

I was checking some things from the TOPCOM examples, and this seems odd:

```
sage: q = [[0,0,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1],[2,4,8,16,32,1],[3,9,27,81,243,1],[4,16,64,256,1024,1],[5,25,125,625,3125,1],[6,36,216,1296,7776,1],[7,49,343,2401,16807,1],[8,64,512,4096,32768,1],[9,81,729,6561,59049,1],[10,100,1000,10000,100000,1]]
sage: p = PointConfiguration(q)
sage: t = p.triangulations_list()
sage: len(t)
0
```

This is a 5-dimensional point configuration with 11 points.  Shouldn't it have some triangulations?

Here's a simpler example with similar problems.

```
sage: p = [[0,0,0,1],[0,3,0,1],[3,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,3,1,1],[3,0,1,1],[1,1,2,1]]
sage: pc = PointConfiguration(p)
sage: t = pc.triangulations_list()
sage: len(t)

```

And this blows up:

```
sage: pc.restrict_to_nonregular_triangulations()
sage: t = pc.triangulations_list()

Is this the same problem that is noted by the line:

I've split off a self-contained triangulation module into #9918. This ticket will focus on getting the TOPCOM spkg build on all platforms. In particular, OSX seems to be broken at the moment. 

I still don't have access to an OSX machine, but will get this sorted out eventually...
