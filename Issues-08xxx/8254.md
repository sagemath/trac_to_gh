FWIW, Sage 4.3.3 (with some mods to get it to build on Solaris) takes 8 seconds to start on a Sun Blade 1000, with 2 x 900 MHz CPUs and 2 GB RAM. That machine has 15,000 rpm 2 Gbit/s fibre channel FC-AL disks. 

Considering the age of that machine, I'm not overly concerned over that one. Although this machine is quite old, the disks are quite high spec. I don't know if that gives any clues. File systems are local. 

The doc test 

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/symmetric_ideal.py" 
```

takes 459.4 seconds to run on that machine, so this is no quick machine - I had to increase SAGE_TIMEOUT just to get some doctests to pass.

Given the startup time for me, on that SPARC, and the fact I have a quicker SPARC, I'm not overly concerned by this myself. 

But those interested in fixing it might like to look at using 'iostat', 'vmstat' and 'sar' to see what the system is doing.

The patch applies to 4.6 after rebasing #8456

In my computer, from a first running (disc access is necessary), Sage passes from 12.059 seconds to 11.290 So, a save less than 10%

If I further lazy import doing a 
lazy import for every * imports and running sage.misc.lazy_import.save_cache_file() the time drops to 10.259

If I run Sage with the initialitation files in RAM (disc acces is not necessary) the time with lazy_importing all * drops from 1.123 to 0.907

So, still, with lazy imports, disc access is too high.


with Robert patch I get the following doctest failures:

<div id="comment:14" align="right">comment:14</div>

Another issue I have found with this patch. With the lazy_imports in all.py, the namespace used in the instances is not the global namespace.

(after several runnings of sage, so it uses the cached database of functions)

```
sage: sloane_sequence
<sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport object at 0x3e4d950>
sage: sloane_sequence._get_object()
<function sloane_sequence at 0x51a7230>
sage: sloane_sequence
<sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport object at 0x3e4d950>
```

It does not introduce sloane_sequence function in the global namespace but in sloane_sequence._namespace that seems to not be the global one.

Concerning the input on the global namespace in sage.all.py one can write

```
import __builtin__
G = __builtin__.__dict__
del __builtin__
```

and insert everything in the dictionary G.

But his looks like a very ugly hack.

<div id="comment:17" align="right">comment:17</div>

What I wrote above is nonsense. I am adding names to the `__builtin__` namespace. Instead it should be _ip.user_ns, the namespace of the IPython session.

If we only do lazy_imports from sage.all we will not get an usable enviroment that load fasts.

If we add lazy_imports in other all.py files we will get problems messing with namespaces.

Suppose the following:

in sage.all:[br]
from sage.rings.all import *

in sage.rings.all:[br]
from sage.rings.polynomial.all import *

If we lazy_import sage.rings.polynomial.all names in sage.rings.all then we have to choose a namespace.

If the namespace chosen is the top one. When inserting the real object, it will be inserted in the main namespace, so, in the module sage.rings.all we will always have the lazy_import object.

If the namespace chosen is sage.rings.all then we will always have the lazy_object in the main namespace...

This is too technical for me to offer a solution at module level. One idea is to add other files called lazy_all.py. these will be modules that import/lazy_import names in the IPython top namespace. They are not intended for the library code, only to have a more fine grain control on what are lazy_importing or not at the start.

Comments? It is worth to give it a try?
