## Hardware
* Sun Blade 1000
* 2 x 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs.
* 2 GB RAM
 
 == Software ==
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (the first release)
* Sage 4.3.4.alpha1 (The first Sage release to build and pass all doctests on Solaris)

## The problem

Despite the fact that Sage builds and pass all doctests (including the long ones), installing optional packages is problematic, as it would appear something is calling 'grep' with the '-o' option which is not POSIX compatible

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html

This causes the problems below:

Dave, $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin is not under hg.
You should create a  patch for the corresponding source place, i.e. 
for a script in sage_scripts-4.3.4.alpha1.spkg

That's the only way to make it into the release, AFAIK.

It is, actually; as I said before, it's the "scripts" repository discussed [in the Sage developer's guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_patches.html#using-mercurial-with-other-sage-repositories).

Running "hg_scripts" from within Sage is, as far as I know, equivalent to running "hg" or "sage -hg" from the command line while in the directory $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin.  So you don't need to produce a new patch.
