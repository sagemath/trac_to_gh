When using

```
x,y=var('x,y')
solve([sin(2*x-pi/6)==1/2],x)
```

sage returns [x == 1/6*pi]. Which is correct, but we would wish to have all roots. This can be done with:

```
solve([sin(2*x-pi/6)==y,y==1/2],[x,y])
```

which returns [[x == 1/2*pi + pi*z5, y == (1/2)], [x == 1/6*pi + pi*z7, y == (1/2)]]

But this is a very weird way to do things. Surely 

```
solve([sin(2*x-pi/6)==1/2],x)
```
should also give all roots.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

Sage interface for Maxima's solver works like this:

We try Maxima's solve function first. It we get empty answer, we try the to_poly_solve for the same equation.

If the answer is not empty, we pass the answer of solve command to Maxima's to_poly_solve.

For our equation, solve command in Maxima gives only one solution pi/6 (and probably writes something like "SOLVE is using arc-trig functions to get a solution. Some solutions will be lost." on terminal).

I hope this is an explanation. I do not have enough experiences with to_poly_solve, so my questions are: Is it good idea to skip solve and use to_poly_solve immediatelly when to_poly_sole = True? Or is it posssible to check from within Sage, that the warning about arc-trig functions has been printed? Or introduce to_poly_solve = 'force' to omit solve command?

Now you can use 

```
sage: eq._maxima_().to_poly_solve(x).sage()
[[x == 1/2*pi + pi*z16], [x == 1/6*pi + pi*z18]]
```
