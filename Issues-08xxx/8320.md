We can use Sphinx's [html_short_title setting](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/config.html#confval-html_short_title) to [try to] keep links from overflowing the header and footer.

This could be useful for devices with small-screen or large fonts (e.g., for accessibility).

For example, instead of "Sage Reference Manual v4.3.3," we can use "Reference v4.3.3," which should help for deeply nested pages.

The patch adds shorter HTML titles, which appear in Sphinx headers and footers, for selected docs: the developer's guide, Bordeaux lectures, numerical primer, and reference manual.  The others' titles overflow only with very large font sizes.  But feel free to make adjustments, e.g., for consistency.

The reviewer patch [trac_8320-reviewer.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8320/trac_8320-reviewer.patch) shortens the HTML title of these documents:

* A Tour of Sage
* Sage Installation Guide
 
I also changed the short title of the reference manual from "Reference" to "Sage Reference" as an attempt to be consistent with these short titles:

* Sage Tutorial
* Sage Constructions
* Sage Tour
 
Only my patch needs review by anyone but me.
