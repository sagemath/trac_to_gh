We can use Sphinx's [html_short_title setting](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/config.html#confval-html_short_title) to [try to] keep links from overflowing the header and footer.

This could be useful for devices with small-screen or large fonts (e.g., for accessibility).

For example, instead of "Sage Reference Manual v4.3.3," we can use "Reference v4.3.3," which should help for deeply nested pages.

The reviewer patch [trac_8320-reviewer.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8320/trac_8320-reviewer.patch) shortens the HTML title of these documents:

* A Tour of Sage
* Sage Installation Guide
 
I also changed the short title of the reference manual from "Reference" to "Sage Reference" as an attempt to be consistent with these short titles:

* Sage Tutorial
* Sage Constructions
* Sage Tour
 
Only my patch needs review by anyone but me.
