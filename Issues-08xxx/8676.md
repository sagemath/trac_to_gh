Hello !!!

I'm halfway through the review of this patch, and I have two remarks :

* It may be a mistale from my part, but even though I can see you added generic_graph to the .rst file, I do not see it in the reference manual even though I can see your updates to the c_graph documentation.

* path #8513 already adds this line, so your patch may have to be rebased on this one. I do not know whether the other modifications of #8513 could create conflicts, by the way

Reviewing your patches remains my preferred way of learning how to use Sage/Sphinx ;-)

This usually happens. What I would do is this. Take the latest Sage version, e.g. the binary version of Sage 4.3.5, and delete the `output` directory:

```
rm -rf SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/doc/output/

I have rebased my patch on top of those at #8513. So now apply patches in this order:

1. #8513
2. [trac_8676-document-cgraph.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/8676/trac_8676-document-cgraph.patch)

Yet another of Minh's patches. 

No mistake that I could notice, the patches are nicely imported, no warning of any kind during the generation of the documentation, the touched files pass all tests, and I learned new ways to use Sphynx. Positive review, and thank you again for your work ! :-)
