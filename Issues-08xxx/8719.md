```

            dtype('float64')
            sage: m = matrix(CDF, 2, range(6)); m
            [  0 1.0 2.0]
            [3.0 4.0 5.0]
            sage: numpy.array(m)                  
            array([[ 0.+0.j,  1.+0.j,  2.+0.j],

            sage: numpy.array(m).dtype            
            dtype('complex128')

            sage: import numpy
            sage: b=numpy.array(a); b
            array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],

Hi Jason,
