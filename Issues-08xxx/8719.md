This patch makes the following work:

```
            sage: import numpy
            sage: m = matrix(RDF, 2, range(6)); m
            [0.0 1.0 2.0]
            [3.0 4.0 5.0]
            sage: numpy.array(m)                  
            array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
            [ 3.,  4.,  5.]])
            sage: numpy.array(m).dtype            
            dtype('float64')
            sage: m = matrix(CDF, 2, range(6)); m
            [  0 1.0 2.0]
            [3.0 4.0 5.0]
            sage: numpy.array(m)                  
            array([[ 0.+0.j,  1.+0.j,  2.+0.j],
            [ 3.+0.j,  4.+0.j,  5.+0.j]])
            sage: numpy.array(m).dtype            
            dtype('complex128')

            sage: import numpy
            sage: b=numpy.array(a); b
            array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
                   [ 4,  5,  6,  7],

            sage: b.dtype
            dtype('int64')
            sage: b.shape

Hi Jason,
