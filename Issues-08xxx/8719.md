Hi Jason,

So you have defined a new method "`__array__`" for a Sage matrix object.  When somebody calls numpy.array(a) for a Sage matrix  a  then this `__array__` method gets called (and this is in effect just the numpy() method of a Sage matrix)?  In other words, the numpy.array() method has an expanded reportoire and now "knows" how to deal with a Sage matrix object?

If so, could you say so?  The line  `__array__=numpy` all by itself looks really mysterious with no documentation.  And the new doctests say "you could use numpy" - when Sage is really doing the heavy-lifting?  It sounds like numpy is doing the work, when this is not a standard behavior of numpy.

So I'm suggesting maybe this seemingly circular arrrangement (modify Sage matrices, so numpy can deal with them, using a Sage function to convert to a numpy array) could be better explained so nobody messes it up or gets too confused.  With the added code and the added doctests all together, I think I was able to figure this out - otherwise it would have been a head-scratcher.
