This is a meta-ticket that helps in organizing changes and additions to the Sage standard documentation. On [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/95afb345e872f9af) and [sage-combinat-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/msg/662eb0246c7bf9fc), it is proposed that we create two new documentation categories called:

* FAQ --- a collection of answers to frequently asked questions.
* Thematic Tutorials --- a collection of in-depth tutorials on specific topics.

See [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e94b8f3dc6f503af) on sage-devel for further discussion about more accessible documentation. For starters, here is a list of tickets with enhancements for those two new documentation categories:

* #8442 Lie Methods and Related Combinatorics
* #8464 FAQ
* #8465 Python Functional Programming for Mathematicians
* #8466 Sage and Coding Theory
* #8467 Linear Programming in Sage
* #8468 Group Theory and Sage: A Primer
* #8469 Number Theory and the RSA Public Key Cryptosystem
* #8886 tutorial on Python object and classes

Once all the above tickets are closed, the current ticket can be closed as fixed.



**Prerequisites:** 

1. #8480 stylistic clean-ups on web page of standard documentation
2. #8468 Group Theory and Sage
3. #8464 add FAQ to standard documentation
4. #8533 browse thematic tutorials from command line and within notebook
5. #8465 Functional Programming for Mathematicians
6. #8469 Number Theory and the RSA Public Key Cryptosystem
7. #8442 Lie Methods and Related Combinatorics

This sounds very good! Should the following appear there as well?

- the category primer (sage.categories.primer)
- the "implementing a parent" tutorial (sage.categories.tutorial); this needs further work!

For the record, in the Sage-Combinat queue, some work is being done on:

- A tutorial on iterators
- A tutorial on combinatorics
