Setting SAGE64=yes is only working on Darwin. To make it work on Open Solaris and possibly on other platforms a small edit of spkg-install is needed.

A patch is coming up.

This line makes no sence whatsovever

```
if [ `uname` = "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then 
```

You must have a typo there. uname will return SunOS, not yes.

Some stupid error I had corrected I thought.

[http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/ports/libpng-1.2.35.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/ports/libpng-1.2.35.p0.spkg)

Didn't change the patch level.

That looks fine now. I see the -m64 flag is added, and it builds as 64-bit. I even checked it on a 64-bit SPARC, and see it builds as 64-bit there too. 

```
drkirkby@swan:[~/sage-4.3.2.rc0] $ file  local/lib/libpng12.so.0.35.0
local/lib/libpng12.so.0.35.0:   ELF 64-bit MSB dynamic lib SPARCV9 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
```

so positive review. 

PS, for future reference, someone mentioned the other day it would be useful if the patch number was in the Mercurial commit message. That sounds quite logical to me. But there is nothing wrong with this.
