Setting SAGE64=yes is only working on Darwin. To make it work on Open Solaris and possibly on other platforms a small edit of spkg-install is needed.

A patch is coming up.

if [ `uname` = "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then 
```

You must have a typo there. uname will return SunOS, not yes.

Some stupid error I had corrected I thought.

[http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/ports/libpng-1.2.35.p0.spkg](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/ports/libpng-1.2.35.p0.spkg)

Didn't change the patch level.

so positive review. 

PS, for future reference, someone mentioned the other day it would be useful if the patch number was in the Mercurial commit message. That sounds quite logical to me. But there is nothing wrong with this.
