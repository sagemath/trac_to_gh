```
1. Doctest: 
       sage -t -sagenb 
2. Run the Selenium test suite:
       sage -python sagenb/testing/run_tests.py 

To use Selenium, you must visit http://seleniumhq.org/download/ and:

      * Download and extract Selenium RC ("the Selenium Remote Control")

      * Run it as follows on Linux:
             $ cd /path/to/selenium-remote-control-1.0.3/selenium-server-1.0.3
             $ java -jar selenium-server.jar
             $ cd /path/to/sagenb-0.8/src/sagenb
             $ sage  -python sagenb/testing/run_tests.py

      * Run it as follows on OS X:
             $ cd /path/to/selenium-remote-control-1.0.3/selenium-server-1.0.3
             $ cd /path/to/sagenb-0.8/src/sagenb
             $ sage
             sage: import sagenb.testing.run_tests as rt 
             sage: rt.setup_tests('localhost', False, '*firefox')
             sage: rt.run_any()
```

That the instructions for OS X are different is probably a bug.

Should someone review the latest patch?  I noticed two minor problems:

* `dwnload`
* An extra `*` in `b) * Run it as follows:`

Also, should the reviewing section first refer in some way to steps 1,2,3, and/or 6 of the development section?
