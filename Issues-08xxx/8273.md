In many graph-theoretical problems, it is important to understand the cycles structure of undirected graphs as well as directed ones. Therefore, I suggest three functions that allow one to iterate over all cycles of a directed graph (I might be interested in writing some functions for undirected graphs, but I prefer to have these ones validated before I do so).



The first and main function is called `cycles_iterator(...)` and allows one to iterate over all cycles satisfying conditions according to the following parameters:

- `simple` (a boolean). When set to True, only the starting and ending vertex may be repeated in the cycle

- `distinct` (also a boolean). When set to True, then all equivalent cycles are merged into one cycle. Equivalent cycles are cycles differing only from their starting vertex, such as `[0,1,2,0]` and `[1,2,0,1]`.

- `initial_vertices` (an iterable). Specify the only allowed starting vertices of the cycles.

- `max_length` (an integer). The maximum length of cycles. Useful especially when a graph contains a very large number of cycles and one wants to compute smaller ones.

The two other function are merely calling `cycles_iterator(...)` with some of the above parameters fixed.

       1530            if len(sccs) == 0: raise StopIteration

  This condition shouldn't ever happen, as the list of strongly
  connected components is a list of list.. In the "worst" case, the
  returned list has a singleton per item :

  [ [0], [1], .... ], and in this case len(sccs) == self.order()

Thank you for your comments ! I will indeed add some comments in the code so that everyone can understand what it does.

Hello !!!

It would be good to get (cheaply) rid of this "bug" happening when the vertices are in no non-trivial strongly connected components... Perhaps some other parameter meant to be used only internally, in this case too... But this would mean a lot of them in the end :-)

I continued to read some parts of your code, and have some other remarks :

* you write :

   ```
        sccs = self.strongly_connected_components()
        from operator import add
        vertices = reduce(add, sccs)
        edges = reduce(add, [self.subgraph(scc).edges() for scc in sccs])
        h = self.subgraph(vertices, edges)
  ```
  Well, you seem trying to get rid of "bridges" -- edges whose removal disconnect the graph. Obviously, there will be no cycle going through them. Doing so, you create a lot of copies of the graph (the subgraph() command), which could be costly... Here is another way to do it :

  First, create the list of strongly connected components

   ```
        sccs = self.strongly_connected_components()
  ```

  Then, associate to each vertex the id of its connected component :

   ```
        d = {}
        for id, component in enumerate(sccs):
            for v in component:
 	        d[v] = id
  ```

  Once it is done, create a copy of your first graph using the copy command (these commands are low-level, written in Cython). Then remove the bad edges :

   ```
          h = self.copy()
  	h.delete_edges([ e for e in g.edge_iterator() if d[e[0]] != d[e[1]] ])
  ```

  This way most of the work is done using dictionaries, and no heavy structure like graphs.

* How is this :

   ```
        vertices = reduce(add, sccs)
  ```

  different from setting

   ```
  	vertices = self.vertices() 
  ```

  I think it comes from the same fact that you will have in sccs some connected components equal to singletons.

  * You write :
  

    ```
        for vi in vertex_iterators.values():
            try:
                cycles.append(vi.next())
            except(StopIteration):
                pass
   ```

   I do not know much about iterators, but... Well, the values of vertex_iterators are iterators, so 

    ```
        for vi in vertex_iterators.values():
	     cycles.extend(list(vi))
   ```

   should work, shouldn't it ?

* This :

   ```
        while len(cycles) > 0:
  ```
   
  Can be replaced by 

   ```
        while cycles:
  ```

* In this situation :

   ```
            for i in range(len(cycles)):
                if len(cycles[i]) < len(shortest_cycle):
                    shortest_cycle = cycles[i]
                    imin = i
  ```

  You can write 

   ```
            for i, cycle_i in enumerate(cycles):
                if len(cycle_i) < len(shortest_cycle):
                    shortest_cycle = cycle_i
                    imin = i
  ```

  I have been told about this "enumerate" trick when working on Cython files... This command is optimized in Cython, so writing Python code this way will help if we are to Cythonize it later :-)

  For example :

   ```
   a = ['pie', 'cake', 'coffee']
   list(enumerate(a))
   [(0, 'pie'), (1, 'cake'), (2, 'coffee')]
  ```

  Anyway, if you are trying to get the minimum element of such a list, you could have also written :

   ```
   i_min, cycle_min = min( enumerate(cycles), key = lambda x: len(x[1]) )
  ```

I'll give a look again at your next version of the patch... Each time I get more used to what it does :-)

I agree with all of them except the following one\n\n  I do not know much about iterators, but...\n  Well, the values of vertex_iterators are iterators,\n  so\n\n```\nfor vi in vertex_iterators.values():\n    cycles.extend(list(vi))\n```\n\nFor two reasons: (1) I want to iterate cycles with increasing length and what you propose breaks this property. (2) There is no guarantee that ``list(vi)`` will ever terminate, since the number of cycles (when ``simple`` is set to False) may be infinite !\n\nI also added three functions which iterate over paths. Note that the code is almost the same, but for sake of efficienty, it seems better to me not to intersect it. The main reason is that when you want to enumerate unrooted cycles, there is a very fast way to verify that (just check that the starting vertex of the current path is the smallest in the path). Therefore, I prefered to separate the two functions.\n\nThank you for the useful comments !\n\nAlso, if you prefer me to break the patch into two smaller ones, just tell me, I'll do it. I'll upload the patch in a short while.",

<a id='comment:5'>**Comment 5:**</a>
Hello, Nathann !
I corrected my patch according to your remarks. I agree with all of them except the following one

  I do not know much about iterators, but...
  Well, the values of vertex_iterators are iterators,
  so

```
for vi in vertex_iterators.values():
    cycles.extend(list(vi))
```

For two reasons: (1) I want to iterate cycles with increasing length and what you propose breaks this property. (2) There is no guarantee that ``list(vi)`` will ever terminate, since the number of cycles (when ``simple`` is set to False) may be infinite !

I also added three functions which iterate over paths. Note that the code is almost the same, but for sake of efficienty, it seems better to me not to intersect it. The main reason is that when you want to enumerate unrooted cycles, there is a very fast way to verify that (just check that the starting vertex of the current path is the smallest in the path). Therefore, I prefered to separate the two functions.

Thank you for the useful comments !

Also, if you prefer me to break the patch into two smaller ones, just tell me, I'll do it. I'll upload the patch in a short while.

Hello, Nathann !

Don't say sorry, your comments are very welcome and are clearly pertinent !

Several comments :

* I do not understand the comment "First, we handle the trivial paths if needed" at line 1519 of digraph.py. What you do just afterwards is initialize the list of paths, which is nicely done regardless of the value of "trivial". 

Done. It was an old comment I forgot to delete.

    * I did not notice it before, but you are maintaining a list of values to which you append things, while only removing the smallest element. This is clearly a heap !! By using them (see  http://docs.python.org/library/heapq.html), you could *theoretically* reduce the complexity of your computations. Well, I think you patch is fixe as it is now, but if you need your computations to speed up a bit, this is definitely worth a try ! 

Done. I noticed it while writing the code, but I was too lazy to do it. It turned out to be very simple, so I'm glad you mentionned it.

    * Instead, when starting_vertices = None, of setting it to self.vertices(), you can also set it to just "self". When, later on, you write "for v in starting_vertices", it will use the iterator over the vertices from "self", which can be slightly better. Well, you algorithm is not meant to be used on graphs with a large number of vertices anyway, so it's not a problem in the present case.
