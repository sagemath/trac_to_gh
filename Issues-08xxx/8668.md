Fact: Annual Survey: Windows Port is always the top requested feature.

Some additional Quotes: 

About Virtualization: “A native version on MS Windows is important. Its nonexistence was no problem for me, but it delayed trying it out for a while, since this virtualization-machinery was unknown to me and seemed complex. In the end, everything worked just as described, no problem at all, but it was a mental hurdle to overcome, before even trying it.“ -- Anonymous, Sage Survey 2009

Sage running on Windows is highly anticipated: “Hopefully we can use this as an alternative to Matlab at our company in the future.” - Andrew Trapani, sage-windows mailing list, May 2010

Open-Source Nature of Sage:

“I like the idea of free software. Sage is enough for tecaching math at our univeristy (of forestry and agriculture). In such a case it is immoral to use maple or mathematica and pay for it from university budget.” -- Anonymous, Sage Survey 2009

“Thanks for building something I've always wanted...” -- Anonymous, Sage Survey 2009

Implementation of Features: “3. No units package is a killer for me.” -- Anonymous, Sage Survey 2009
