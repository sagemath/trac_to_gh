Doing

```
f = Piecewise([[(-pi, pi), x]])
print f.fourier_series_partial_sum(2, pi)
print f.fourier_series_partial_sum(3, pi)
```
we get

```
2*sin(x)
-sin(2*x) + 2*sin(x)
```
while according to the documentation we should get the second output with the first command.

Update: Same output with the new `piecewise` from #14801. Does it agree with the documentation there?

UPDATE: this is fixed in Sage 8.1 (see #23672):

```
sage: f = piecewise([[(-pi, pi), x]])
sage: f.fourier_series_partial_sum(2, pi)
-sin(2*x) + 2*sin(x)
```

Attachment [trac_8603-fourier-sum-docstring.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket8603/trac_8603-fourier-sum-docstring.patch) by @wdjoyner created at 2011-06-18 10:46:16

This fixes the documentation of fourier_series_partial_sum, replacing

```
 f(x) \sim \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^N [a_n\cos(\frac{n\pi x}{L}) +
b_n\sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})],
```
by

```
 f(x) \sim \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} [a_n\cos(\frac{n\pi x}{L})
+ b_n\sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})],

The `.series()` method of symbolic expressions cut off in a pythonic way, like David's change here. If `.taylor()` does something different we should change it.

This is a trivial change. I'd be happy to give a positive review if it passes all tests but the patch bot doesn't seem to be working for some reason.

This is fixed by #23672.

Regarding the example in the ticket description, in Sage 8.1.beta4, we have now

```
sage: f = piecewise([[(-pi, pi), x]])
sage: f.fourier_series_partial_sum(2, pi)
-sin(2*x) + 2*sin(x)
```
We even have, since the half-period is now a default argument,

```
sage: f.fourier_series_partial_sum(2)
-sin(2*x) + 2*sin(x)
```

I am not sure to understand what you mean. In the current version, as integrated in Sage 8.1.beta4, there are doctests like

```
sage: f = piecewise([((-1,0), -1), ((0,1), 1)])
sage: f.fourier_series_partial_sum(5)
4/5*sin(5*pi*x)/pi + 4/3*sin(3*pi*x)/pi + 4*sin(pi*x)/pi
```
In Sage <= 8.0, this would have returned (*)

```
4/3*sin(3*pi*x)/pi + 4*sin(pi*x)/pi
```

(*) with the half-period added as the second argument, i.e. `f.fourier_series_partial_sum(5, 1)`)
