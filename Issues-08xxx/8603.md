Doing

```
f = Piecewise([[(-pi, pi), x]])
print f.fourier_series_partial_sum(2, pi)
print f.fourier_series_partial_sum(3, pi)
```
we get

```
2*sin(x)
-sin(2*x) + 2*sin(x)
```
while according to the documentation we should get the second output with the first command.

Update: Same output with the new `piecewise` from #14801. Does it agree with the documentation there?

UPDATE: this is fixed in Sage 8.1 (see #23672):

```
sage: f = piecewise([[(-pi, pi), x]])
sage: f.fourier_series_partial_sum(2, pi)
-sin(2*x) + 2*sin(x)
```


Depends on #14801

b_n\sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})],

+ b_n\sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L})],

The `.series()` method of symbolic expressions cut off in a pythonic way, like David's change here. If `.taylor()` does something different we should change it.

This is a trivial change. I'd be happy to give a positive review if it passes all tests but the patch bot doesn't seem to be working for some reason.

<div id="comment:15" align="right">Comment 15</div>

This is fixed by #23672.

Regarding the example in the ticket description, in Sage 8.1.beta4, we have now

```
sage: f = piecewise([[(-pi, pi), x]])
sage: f.fourier_series_partial_sum(2, pi)
-sin(2*x) + 2*sin(x)
```
We even have, since the half-period is now a default argument,

```
sage: f.fourier_series_partial_sum(2)
-sin(2*x) + 2*sin(x)
```

I am not sure to understand what you mean. In the current version, as integrated in Sage 8.1.beta4, there are doctests like

```
sage: f = piecewise([((-1,0), -1), ((0,1), 1)])
sage: f.fourier_series_partial_sum(5)
4/5*sin(5*pi*x)/pi + 4/3*sin(3*pi*x)/pi + 4*sin(pi*x)/pi
```
In Sage <= 8.0, this would have returned (*)

```
4/3*sin(3*pi*x)/pi + 4*sin(pi*x)/pi
```

(*) with the half-period added as the second argument, i.e. `f.fourier_series_partial_sum(5, 1)`)

Actually, as said in [comment:15](#comment%3A15), the issue is fixed in another ticket: #23672, hence the "sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix" milestone for the current one and the "wonfix" resolution.

Hey, do non-release managers get to mark "closed"?  That would be a change in protocol.

Also, maybe the resolution should be "fixed" or "duplicate" if it is indeed fixed in another ticket?

This was announced in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/4bIUu1NECwY/we3BMdkeAAAJ with apparently the approval of the release manager.

> Also, maybe the resolution should be "fixed" or "duplicate" if it is indeed fixed in another ticket?

Ah yes, you are right (I thought this was automatically set to "wontfix"  while closing "sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix" tickets).
