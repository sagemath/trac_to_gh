The comment in SPKG.txt is inaccurate, as the patch is not specific to Open Solaris. 


A more accurate comment would be. 

Ensures the compiler flag -m64 is added when the environment variable SAGE64 was set to yes - previously this was only happening on OS X. This should aid building 64-bit on any platform, though it has only been tested on Open Solaris. 

Also, add the trac ticket number #8062 to the comment. 

It's far better to open a ticket for the bug first, before trying to fix it. Then the ticket number can be placed in the comments in SPKG.txt. 

You might want to remove Martin Albrecht as a maintainer, as his name is duplicated.

That is what I did. As you can see in the patch.

Positive review. All dynamic libraries are 64-bit. I don't know how one can determine this with static libraries, as 'ldd' does not indicate anything about them. But I assume they are probably ok

```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.3.1$ file local/lib/libgivaro*
local/lib/libgivaro.a:	current ar archive, not a dynamic executable or shared object
local/lib/libgivaro.la:	commands text
local/lib/libgivaro.so:	ELF 64-bit LSB dynamic lib AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
local/lib/libgivaro.so.0:	ELF 64-bit LSB dynamic lib AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
local/lib/libgivaro.so.0.0.2:	ELF 64-bit LSB dynamic lib AMD64 Version 1, dynamically linked, not stripped
```

It would be worth trying to find out a way of confirming the exact type of static libraries, but I think the fact the shared libraries are ok, this patch is fine.
