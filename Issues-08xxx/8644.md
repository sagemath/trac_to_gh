I released a new pynac version after applying a few upstream patches from `GiNaC`, the most important being a fix for #8565.

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.12.spkg

Since these are minor changes, I don't expect any build problems. I've tested the package on 
* an up-to-date 64-bit Gentoo system (my laptop) with 

```
gcc (Gentoo 4.3.4 p1.0, pie-10.1.5) 4.3.4
```
* 32-bit Debian GNU/Linux 5.0.4 (lenny)

```
gcc (Debian 4.3.2-1.1) 4.3.2
```
