From this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/dbe5b953a06d1f39) report:

```
The first on seems to be a trivial 32-bit vs. 64-bit
issue (probably occurs on any 32-bit machine, even without the "long"
option):

sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix1.pyx"
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/Shared/sage/test/sage-4.4.2.alpha0/devel/sage/sage/matrix/
matrix1.pyx", line 460:
    sage: b.dtype
Expected:
    dtype('int64')
Got:
    dtype('int32')
********************************************************************** 
```

This also happens on the Skynet machine cicero, a 32-bit Fedora 12 machine.
