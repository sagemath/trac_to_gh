The last patch for conjugates and power simplification included in this pynac version breaks doctests in `sage/rings/qqbar.py` and a bunch of other places.

I suppose the fix will involve looking into the `power_helper` in detail, hopefully fixing #8959 on the way. I won't have time for this at least for a week though.

If anybody is interested in working on the cygwin port, I can prepare a package which includes only the patches relevant for that in the mean time.

Despite Mike's comments on #9037, this does not resolve the issue there, as it still has:

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
    echo "64 bit MacIntel"
    CXXFLAGS="-m64 -O2 -g"; export CXXFLAGS
    LDFLAGS="-m64"; export LDFLAGS
fi
```

I'll have to create a new package based on this one and apply the fix again.

Hi Dave,

Which package are you looking at. Unfortunately, there are several packages named pynac-0.2.0.spkg floating around. My version at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.2.0.spkg

doesn't have the said fix, but Mike's version at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/pynac-0.2.0.spkg

might do. I believe the version included in the release is the latter.

I often wish there was a central repository, as having different versions and constant rebasing does get a bit annoying. 

Mike's version at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/pynac-0.2.0.spkg does have the fix, but the only version mentioned on this trac ticket was yours at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.2.0.spkg which does not have the fix. The comment from William was 

"I merged in  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.2.0.spkg"

so I can only assume your version, and not Mikes is merged. 

Actually, it appears changing

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
```
to 

```
if [ "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
```

(as in Mike's version), does not fully solve the 64-bit build issue on OpenSolaris. However, it is certainly a desirable change, so if you make any more changes to pynac, can you change that one line. 

In the mean time, I'll work on trying to resolve why that is not a complete fix for the 64-bit OpenSolaris issue, but it is certainly a necessary change.

The ticket says Burchin's package has already been merged in sage-4.4.3.alpha1 - whether it is possible to reverse that easily I don't know.
