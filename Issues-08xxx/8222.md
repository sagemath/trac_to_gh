Kevin, can you make one big patch (here is how to do that http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1224379/exporting-mercurial-patch-against-an-old-revision).

I am mostly guided by the mantra that passing UI decisions to the user is not a solution. We should man up and fix the most useful behavior that 99% of users will use (and maybe add the sliders hidden behind a "tweak" button or skip them all together).


- Correct me if wrong but Live with auto-max, spring-el. and default sliders give exactly what I expect on 99% of the graphs. I suggest we make this default (and get rid or hide everything else).


- Similarly, I see no reason for live behavior that shoots vertices out of screen. Link auto-max along with live. At the same time, when graph is paused (not live) auto-max should be off.


- Numbering for vertices should be off by default (graph theorists seldom number their vertices).


- I see only two useful vertex sizes, one for unnumbered vertices and one for numbered. The vertex size slider can be skipped (or hidder by "tweaks" button).


- Unnumbered vertices should be filled black.


- There should be a warning (use JS confirm) with circle layout, since it can potentially destroy a carefully planned layout and there is no undo.

I tried applying 8222-sagenb.patch and 8222-sage.patch to 4.3.4.  The "sage" patch applied fine, but I got several failures with the sagenb patch.

Finding no hg repo for the notebook I initiated one where I thought it belonged, at

`local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sagenb-0.7.<something>-py2.6.egg`

(I can't recall the version number on the notebook and am not on the right machine).

Do I need to install the development version of the notebook? (I've done this before, the drill with python setup.py -develop......)  Or do I need to apply more than just the two patches?

Anyway, any guidance in testing this on a stock Sage install would be welcome.

Thanks,
Rob

Hi Rob,

You are the second person complaining for the sagenb patch so I probably made the wrong patch. So I erased my sagenb folder, pasted the new code and made a new patch. Try 8222-sagenb-mega.patch. It has everything to make the graph_editor look like the one on my website. Also has fix for the loop bug you found, which the old one didn't have.

There is a hg repo for the notebook, you don't need to recreate anything. Just extract and go to /sagenb-0.7.5.3/src/sagenb . Now all your "hg patch" commands should work.

Here is a summary of everything needed to make this run:
1) apply 8222-sage.patch to Sage.
2) untar sagenb (with tar -xvf sagenb-0.7.5.3.spgk)
3) apply 8222-sagenb-mega.patch in sagenb-0.7.5.3/src/sagenb with "hg patch 8222-sagenb-mega.patch"
4) run SAGEPATH/sage -python setup.py -develop in sagenb-0.7.5.3/src/sagenb
5) run sage and enjoy!

Hi Rado and Kevin,

Been experimenting with this over the weekend - very, very nice.  I think I've learned enough about the pieces to be able to review this now.

Were you going to

(1) disable red edges?

(2) turn-off auto-maximize?

One suggestion I have right now (without having done a 100% thorough review) is to perhaps check very early on to see if the input is even a graph?  Right now totally wrong input results in a traceback on getting the position dictionary (which is not very informative to the newbie).

Let me know the status of this (ie will you be making more changes?) and I'll see about doing a careful review.  I've got some longer-term, broader comments that I'll post to sage-devel right now.

Hi Rob,

I was waiting to see what Kevin has to say (since I basically took his code and tweaked with my personal preferences, without consulting with him). However, I haven't heard back from him. You are right we should add some type checking.

I wanted to remove auto-maximize, but since it has Kevin's original work, I wanted to hear back from him. Are you in favor of removing it? If nobody else, says something, I will just make final patch with:

1) removed red-edges
2) removed buttons for maximize and auto-maximize
3) switch delete to keyboard 'd'

on the sage side:

1) add type checking
2) incorporate pang's patch (thanks for patch, that was very sloppy of me)

Then Rob can review it and have the new (in my opinion much superior version of graph editor) in Sage.

If there is a change he's not happy with it, it could get reverted before being merged (or afterward).

It struck me that it was the source of a lot of wild behavior, without being crucial to proper functioning, so yes, I'd vote for leaving it out for right now.  It could come back later in a different form.

Sounds like a good plan.

Great improvements!  The "live" layout works great, and I really like the way dragging a vertex against the edge makes it appear to bounce off the wall.  Turning off auto-maximize was a good idea, I think.

Tested with 4.3.4 and sagenb-0.7.5.1.  sagenb was updated with all patches available to date.

Passes all tests in sage/graphs, HTML docs build without warnings.

I have added a reviewer patch.  There was a misspelling on the dialog warning about the circular layout change and while I was there I made a little change to the tail end of the string.  the patch file is just to make it easy to see the change.

There are also two new comprehensive patches, wrapping everything up (including reviewer patch).  Apply `trac_8222-sagenb-graph-editor.patch` to the notebook code and apply `trac_8222-sage-graph-editor.patch` to the sage library repo.

Hi Rado,

Yes, I forgot to add that the next target is definitely the graph-control for interacts.  I'll try to get my experiment together as a patch and post it there.  Also, I have my sights on the graph/latex/tikz stuff.

And yes again - Kevin's contributions here are great!

Thanks for getting this ready to merge so quickly.

Rob

hmm, weird, it is all working on my setup. I downloaded sagenb-0.8 from #8725, applied rob's all-in-one patch, ran setup.py develop and there was nothing broken.
