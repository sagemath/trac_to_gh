When plotting a function using `plot`, the default color for the graph of the function is blue.  The default color for `implicit_plot` is black.  It would be preferable to have the same default color.

Ryan!  Welcome to Trac!  Congratulations on your patch!

I think maybe it would be better to make the implicit plot default color be blue.  I like that a plot is a different color than the axes so that it's easier to distinguish the two.

Also, when a patch is ready for review, change the state below to "needs review".

See http://sagenb.org/home/jason3/230/ for how to plot implicit plots in a different color:

```
var('x,y')
implicit_plot(x^2-y^2==1, (x,-5,5), (y,-5,5), cmap=["red"])
```

I think it might be enough to give another argument to the `@`options decorator for implicit_plot: `cmap=["blue"]`

ok...here's the new patch.

One can now set the color of implicit_plot using cmap or the "new" color option (idea curtesy of kcrisman).  Note: syntax for cmap is still the same.  Syntax for color is ` color='blue' `

`@`kcrisman: Yeah, I'm Jason's little brother.  

Have fun with all those colorful plots :)

(and it's more than nice; patches are required to have doctests if they fix a bug or add new features these days...)

After you add a doctest, then you can run:

```
sage -b
```

to rebuild, and then 

```
sage -t contour_plot.py
```

to run the tests.

This is nice - positive review.  

I fixed some minor doc issues added a really cool example I stumbled upon while testing it (picture attached), and also updated some other minor doc issues which became apparent with this - all of which are basically related to the color or are just typos.

To release manager: Apply `trac_8529-color-implicit-plot` and then `trac-8529-reviewer`.
