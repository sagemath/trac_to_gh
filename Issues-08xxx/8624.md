The integral of abs(cos(x))*sin(x) returns the result as if abs() is ignored:

```
sage: integral(abs(cos(x))*sin(x),(x,pi/2,pi))
-1/2
```
while

```

(0.49999999999999994, 5.5511151231257819e-15)

Sure, but it was *wrong* before, and correctness trumps maxima startup time.  Unless we can detect what kind of integrals need this package loaded and load it dynamically, I think the best thing is to load it up front.

I get the following errors after applying [attachment:trac-8624-abs-integration.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8624/trac-8624-abs-integration.patch) to 4.4.2:

Here's the Maple output:

It would be interesting to see how this is transformed to the expression with the incomplete gamma function above.

This just distributes the integral to the polynomial in the numerator. It's interesting to see that maxima cannot handle results with algebraic numbers.

    sage: integrate(sin(x)*cos(10*x)*log(x), x)
Expected:
    1/18*log(x)*cos(9*x) - 1/22*log(x)*cos(11*x) - 1/18*integrate(cos(9*x)/x, x) + 1/22*integrate(cos(11*x)/x, x)
Got:
    1/198*(11*cos(9*x) - 9*cos(11*x))*log(x) + 1/44*Ei(-11*I*x) - 1/36*Ei(-9*I*x) - 1/36*Ei(9*I*x) + 1/44*Ei(11*I*x)
```
Here is the result from Maple:

```
> integrate(sin(x)*cos(10*x)*log(x), x);
1/18 ln(x) cos(9 x) - 1/22 ln(x) cos(11 x) - 1/18 Ci(9 x) - 1/198 I Pi

     + 1/198 I Pi csgn(x) + 1/22 Ci(11 x)
```
This looks OK to me.

Apparently via Gamma(-1,x)=Ei(-x)+e^(-x)/x+1/2 (log(-1/x)-log(-x))+log(x) and the connection between Ei and Ci.  But it does check out!

This is actually ok, because it is supposed to return an antiderivative, not a definite integral.  It is fantastically more complicated than it has to be, but it would simplify to

```
x>0: x --> -e^(-x)
x<0: x --> e^x
```
which is indeed the correct antiderivative.

> Maple simply gives 2 for this one:


Which is clearly correct, and indeed given by the previous line in the file:

```
            sage: f.integral(definite=True)
            2
```

So if this really is all the errors (I will check this with the new Maxima package momentarily), then I would say positive review once the z... are reverted to actual numbers.  I thought of another reason for this - the user reading documentation might be confused about that if they didn't see the actual output.

Mathematica 6.0 also agrees:

In[1]:= Integrate[Abs[Cos[x]] * Sin[x], {x,Pi/2,Pi}]

Out[1]= -
        2

In[2]:= Integrate[Sqrt[Cos[x]^2 + Sin[x]^2], {x,0,2*Pi}]

Out[2]= 2 Pi
```

So I'm closing this ticket as fixed.
