I'm getting lots of failures on a patched version of 4.3.4.alpha0 for many files related to homology:

```
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/homology/delta_complex.py"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/homology/cubical_complex.py"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/homology/examples.py"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/homology/cell_complex.py"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/homology/chain_complex.py"
        sage -t  -long "devel/sage/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py"
```

The ones involving simplicial_complex.py all report 

```
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

See below for me detailed information. I think John deals with this sort of thing, but I don't even know what to classify it as, so I've stuck it on *doctest*.
