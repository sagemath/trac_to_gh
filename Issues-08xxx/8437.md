Thus I did check again with `make dist`, and there are still wrong permissions:

```

There is no patch doing this (the automatic checking, in particular), so I'm delaying this to Sage 5.0.  Also, this should probably be a meta-ticket: it should point to other tickets, each dealing with a specific spkg which has this problem.

strange way to deal with a blocker ticket... Two years ago, such tickets were considered very seriously by the release manager.

please look at comment 6 in #1240: Sage does not function at all in a multi-user environment.
I just ask that this item should be added in the "TODO" list of the release manager: just run the
command given in comment 2 above before each release (it takes less than one minute) and fix the
corresponding permissions if needed.

2. Even if they don't, it seems all files are *installed* with the correct permissions, which is really what matters, I checked this with:
