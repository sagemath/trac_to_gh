In fact my colleague did not really use `make dist`, but `mv` to install Sage.
Thus I did check again with `make dist`, and there are still wrong permissions:

A followup from Emmanuel Thome: the following command should give no output (from an extracted
tarball of Sage):

```
find . -name '*.spkg' | while read f ; do bzip2 -dc $f | tar tvf - | grep -v '^.rw.r..r..'  ; done
```
Currently (in sage-4.3.3) it gives many hundred lines:

I agree with the comment from #1240: 

> I declare this as a blocker since this issue should be fixed *once for all* (and automatically checked before doing a release).

There is no patch doing this (the automatic checking, in particular), so I'm delaying this to Sage 5.0.  Also, this should probably be a meta-ticket: it should point to other tickets, each dealing with a specific spkg which has this problem.

strange way to deal with a blocker ticket... Two years ago, such tickets were considered very seriously by the release manager.

What else can I do about it?  I'm not even sure it should be labeled a blocker, since Sage seems to function perfectly well without fixing it.

please look at comment 6 in #1240: Sage does not function at all in a multi-user environment.
I just ask that this item should be added in the "TODO" list of the release manager: just run the
command given in comment 2 above before each release (it takes less than one minute) and fix the
corresponding permissions if needed.

Closing this since
1. Many of the files in spkgs now have the correct permissions.
2. Even if they don't, it seems all files are *installed* with the correct permissions, which is really what matters, I checked this with:

```
find . -not \( \( -type f -perm 0644 \) -or \( -type f -perm 0755 \) -or \( -type d -perm 0755 \) -or -type l \) -ls
```
3. The issue of running Sage as a different user is being tracked at #5155.  If non-readable files would be a problem, then the doctests would fail.
