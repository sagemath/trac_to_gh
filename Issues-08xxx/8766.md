I looked in integer.pyx at the two methods `_iadd_` and `_imul_`, which both mutate self, e.g., allow for:

```
sage: a = 2010
sage: a._imul_(19)
sage: a
38190
```
I expected to find a bug exciting docstring about how these methods are unsafe, etc.   Instead, there is *NOTHING* -- not even a doctest or docstring at all.

I also wish there were versions of these:

```
sage: a.unsafe_add_inplace
sage: a.unsafe_mul_inplace
```
that could be used in code, and would make their unsafe nature clear to the reader without having to read any docs.

That is not a bug -- it is done on purpose.  The reason is because integers are meant to be *immutable*, since they have a hash method.   If _imul_ were used by __imul__, then people would be mutating integers left and right by accident, and vast amounts of code would consequently have subtle bugs all over the place.   

There might have been a time (maybe a few weeks in 2006) when __imul__ did indeed call _imul_ in Sage, so the name might be a historical remnant. 

Personally, I think the best thing would be:

  (1) Rename _imul_ and _iadd_ to something like _unsafe_inplace_mul_, _unsafe_inplace_add_

  (2) Document them.
