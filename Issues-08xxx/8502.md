The following behaviour does not agree with the documentation for the {{{__call__}} function on multivariable polynomials, which states that (as one would expect and hope) the result should lie in the constant field:

```
sage: K.<t> = NumberField(x^2+47)
sage: R.<X,Y,Z> = K[]
sage: f = X+Y+Z
sage: a = f(t,t,t)
sage: a.parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in X, Y, Z over Number Field in t with defining polynomial x^2 + 47
```
It is also inconsistent:

```
sage: R.<X,Y,Z> = QQ[]
sage: f = X+Y+Z
sage: a = f(2,3,4)
sage: a.parent()
Rational Field
```
This causes strange bugs -- see #8498 for an example.

Bug fixed:  I added tests for when the resulting value is either 0, or a nonzero constant, in which case an element of the base ring is returned.  Otherwise an element of the parent is returned (so you can still evaluate f(x+y,y) and similar.)

Patch up as soon as testing is finished.
