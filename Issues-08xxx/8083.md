Accented letters produced in notebook by command like this

```
%latex
ěščřžýáíéďĎ
```
produce letters composed from two objects - letter and accent - and this does not look good in some cases, especially the letter ď. The solution is to use correct fonts in LaTeX.

from the command line doesn't work at all, and I can't figure out how to fix it.  I can get it not to throw an error -- see the experimental patch.  I think that the command to write the LaTeX file (in the definition of the `view` function) should be something like

Out of curiosity: Do other font encodings ever conflict with `T1`?  Other alphabets may require a different one, e.g., for

```
%latex

```
one can use

```python
sage.misc.latex.latex.extra_preamble('\\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}')
