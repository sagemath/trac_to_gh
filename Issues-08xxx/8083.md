Accented letters produced in notebook by command like this

```
%latex
ěščřžýáíéďĎ
```
produce letters composed from two objects - letter and accent - and this does not look good in some cases, especially the letter ď. The solution is to use correct fonts in LaTeX.

Out of curiosity: Do other font encodings ever conflict with `T1`?  Other alphabets may require a different one, e.g., for

```
%latex
Теория чисел
```
one can use

```python
sage.misc.latex.latex.extra_preamble('\\usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}')
```
