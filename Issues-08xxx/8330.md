BipartiteGraph needs to hook delete_vertex() and delete_vertices().

```
sage: g = BipartiteGraph(graphs.CycleGraph(4))
sage: (g.left, g.right)
([0, 2], [1, 3])
sage: g.delete_vertex(0)
sage: g.left
[0, 2]
```
Note vertex 0 still shows up in the left partition.

It should also override add_vertex()

```
sage: g = BipartiteGraph()
sage: g.add_vertex('a')
sage: g.left
[]
sage: g.right  # where did it go?
[]
```
and add_edge().

```
sage: g = BipartiteGraph(Graph({'a':['b','c']}))
sage: g.left
['a']
sage: g.right
['b','c']
sage: g.add_edge('b', 'c')  # violates bipartition, should raise exception
```

When you say "hook", do you mean "define"?

Yes, I do mean define these methods.  The proposed method definitions just call the corresponding method in Graph, then adjust the partition lists.  So it feels to me like a driver "hook" where you call the existing function but add a little extra functionality before or after.

The patch defines the needed methods including doctests that pass.
