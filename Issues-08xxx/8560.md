Latest Magma v2.16-6 fails to load under Sage 4.3.3, with 
  the following error message: 


sage: magma_console() 
  dyld: Library not loaded: `@`executable_path/libgmp.3.dylib 
    Referenced from: /Applications/Magma/bin/magma.exe 
   Reason:  Incompatible library version: magma.exe requires version 
 9.0.0 or  later, but libgmp.3.dylib provides version 8.0.0 
 /usr/bin/magma:  line 72: 16880 Trace/BPT trap          "${ROOT}/bin/ 
 magma.exe" $* 


The reason of the failure is  that Sage defines the variable DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH when it executes  Magma. If you undefine it or define it to point to the right place,  then there is no problem

The solution is to use sage-native-execute in Magma interface.
