Do you want to rebase [trac_8203-doc.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8203/trac_8203-doc.patch.gz) on top of #8190?

Do I *want* to?  Not really.  But here's a new version of the patch.

By the way, can I add "delete `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/misc/attach.rst`" to this ticket, since this didn't get done as part of #8022?
