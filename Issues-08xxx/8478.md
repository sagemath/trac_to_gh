The section Standalone !Python/Sage Scripts at http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/programming.html#section-loadattach seems to have two problems (profuse apologies if these are actually user errors).

1. __`#!/usr/bin/env sage -python`__ doesn't work in linux since a shebang line can only handle a single argument ('sage' in this case). One workaround is to use __`#!/path/to/sage -python`__ -- I have since verified, however, that simply using __`#!/usr/bin/env sage`__ **does** work with sage 5.8.
2. The script itself seems broken.  When testing it using sage 4.3.3 (and 5.8), running __`./factor 2006`__ works as expected, but __`./factor "32*x^5-1"`__ gives:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./factor", line 11, in <module>
    print factor(sage_eval(sys.argv[1]))
  File "/opt/sage-4.3.3-linux-32bit-ubuntu_9.10-i686-Linux/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/sage_eval.py", line 199, in sage_eval
    return eval(source, sage.all.__dict__, locals)
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

To correct this, see the comment attached to this ticket which provides a new version of the 'factor' script.

A better way of handling the `#!` problem might be to use `#!/usr/bin/env sage-python`.

Here's a version which should work correctly (at least with sage 5.8):


```
#!/usr/bin/env sage

import sys
from sage.all import *

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print "Usage: %s <n>"%sys.argv[0]
    print "Outputs the prime factorization of n."
    sys.exit(1)
    
try:
    e = sage_eval(sys.argv[1])
except NameError:
    e = symbolic_expression(sys.argv[1])

print factor(e)

```
