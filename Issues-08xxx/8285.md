## Build environment
* Sage 4.3.3.alpha0, which includes R 2.10.1
* Sun Blade 1000 with two 900 MHz UltraSPARC III+ CPUs, 2 GB RAM. (This is the same sort of processor as 't2', but is a much older machine, though still quicker than t2 for building Sage!)
* Solaris 10 03/2005 (The first release of Solaris 10). 
* gcc 4.4.3 (The latest as I write). 

## The problem
Someone updated R in Sage, without testing on Solaris. The update caused several problems on Solaris - the most obvious one being R now needs iconv, which Sage does not currently include. 

However, despite a new standard package for iconv #8191, R would still not build on Solaris, but failed with:

  ```
  Undefined                       first referenced
   symbol                             in file
  uiter_setUTF8                       libR.a(util.o)
  ucol_strcollIter                    libR.a(util.o)
  ld: fatal: Symbol referencing errors. No output written to R.bin
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status 
  ```

## The Solution
Several changes were made to R's spkg-install file, to fix not only the fact R would not build at all, but also some other enhancements. The updated package can be found at 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/r-2.10.1.p0/

* Adds the undocumented option 

  ```
  --without-ICU
  ```
  as that allows R to build without the ICU library from http://site.icu-project.org/ The option was suggested to me in a private email after a post to r-help <at> r-project.org. The build now shows: 

  ```
  Making Sage/Python scripts relocatable...

  user    22m33.551s
  sys     3m1.363s
  Successfully installed r-2.10.1.p0
 ```
* Ensures SAGE64 will attempt a 64-bit build on any platform, not just OS X. (I've not actually built R 64-bit.) 
* Removed all references to the option 

  ```
  --with-iconv=no 
  ``` 
  as R **must** have iconv now - it is no longer optional. #8191 is an iconv library. 
* Better detection for X support on Solaris. (The previous test would always indicate R could not be built with X support, despite the fact it could be). R's configure script should work this out itself, but some comments in spkg-install suggest this was not working right on a OSX Intel 10.5.1. **The changes I made will only impact Solaris**. 
* Added some hopefully helpful comments in spkg-install, as I believe there are still multiple issues in that file - see  #8274


## How to test
This should have no impact on any platform other than Solaris, though of course it is useful to test on multiple platforms to be 100% sure.

To test on Solaris 10, one needs access to a SPARC box. Some notes about how to test on 't2' are given at 

http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

First one needs to add a new standard package for iconv - #8191. 

* Get the spkg from http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/new-packages/iconv/iconv-1.13.1.spkg and place it in $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard
* Copy https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8191/deps.gz to $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/deps
* Copy https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8191/install.gz to $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install (This must be made executable - it will probably lose the execute permission when downloading)

Once that is all down, typing 'make' should allow R to build, and you should get: 

   ```
   Successfully installed r-2.10.1.p0
   ```
