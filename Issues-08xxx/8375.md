The patches at #8374 and here fix the corresponding doctest failures in 4.3.0.1 on t2 and still pass in 4.3.3 on sage.math.

Just to check: Did "sage-devel" agree that this was the best approach to the problem? 

I'm not sure if Minh is already reviewing these tickets.  To the extent it counts, my review is positive, provided that you fix the [minor, admittedly] spelling / grammatical errors.

There was only one comment from Robert as to whether there was another way to get the SPARC processor to produce the same output as Intel. I mentioned there was, but it would require  very significant changes. 

The exact same correction for 'e' was made once before for the SPARC processor. It has been implemented numerous time for other processors. 

I've corrected the grammar/spelling.
