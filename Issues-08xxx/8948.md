Rob, you might be interested in this slight improvement to linear algebra latexing.

Maybe this ticket only needs a doctest to be ready for review?

Yep, code looks good.  I *always* put a thin space into my vectors, so this will be nice to have automatically.  Doctests are updated, made two necessary fixes in the symbolic-callable tests.  Running tests right now and will report back.

Attachment is totally doctests that needed fixing, plus one new one.  No change to the code.  I'm fine with a positive review on the code once somebody checks my doctest changes.
