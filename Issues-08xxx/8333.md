Some strange things going on here. I installed the patches on 4.3.4.rc0 with the preceding patches in the series applied. 

(1) It builds fine, but Sage won't start because the patched `finite_field_prime_modn.py` contains the line

```
from sage.rings.integer_mod_ring import IntegerModRing_generic
```
and that file has been removed by #8218.

(2) There is also a problem in `element_ext_pari.py` caused by the line

```
elif isinstance(value, FreeModuleElement):
```
being used without FreeModuleElement being imported first. 

(3) Next up, there's another issue in `element_ntl_gf2e` caused by trying to import `is_FiniteField` from the wrong place. 

(4) I'm getting a bunch of identical errors relating to the Singular library -- it says 

```
 File "/home/masiao/sage-4.3.4.rc0/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/interfaces/singular.py", line 672, in has_coerce_map_from_impl
        raise NotImplementedError
```

(5) Something weird is going on in sage/modular/dirichlet.py which causes an infinite recursion error when reducing an element of a number field modulo a prime; this may well be dealt with by #8334, I haven't checked. Same in three places in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py and a bunch of other elliptic curves modules, and in sage/rings/residue_field.py

(6) The patch changes a whole load of doctests in sage/libs/flint/zmod_poly_linkage for no apparent reason, and thus causes them to fail. (Are you running a newer FLINT version on your development machine?)

(7)  Various errors in the rings/finite_rings directory, e.g. this one: 

```
File "/home/masiao/sage-4.3.4.rc0/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_ext_pari.py", line 580, in _coerce_map_from_
        elif self.degree() % K.degree() == 0:
    NameError: global name 'K' is not defined
```


Most of these are trivial, but (4) is beyond my ability to fix. I'm sorry, but that's definitely a "needs work".

Ah, I see what's going on. Most of these are fixed by the patch `7585_12_1_fixes.patch` at #8334. But that is dependent on #7883, which needs some substantial work.

David, I suggest you do one of the following things:

- Fix #7883 as robertwb and I have suggested; once that has a positive review then we can go on and review this ticket and #8334 together.

- Back-port the fixes from #8334 that belong here, and then I will happily review it independently of #7883 and #8334.

I've had a look at this, but with mixed success.

Applying `8333_parent_init.patch` and `8333_finite_fields_to_new_coercion.2.patch` to 4.6.alpha1 on top of the new folded, positively-reviewed patch at #7883, I get one trivial failure (because I backported a hunk of one of these patches to get #7883 to work). This is fine and can happily be ignored. However, it's very broken with just those two patches (Sage won't even start up, because of a broken import statement).

I tried applying all the hunks of `7585_12_1_fixes.2.patch` other than the ones involving residue fields. That almost worked, but not quite: there was still an infinite recursion error occuring in `residue_field.pyx`. 

David: can you either get this working on its own, or rebase the patches at #8334 so I can review this and #8334 together?
