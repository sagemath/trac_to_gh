Here is the summary of what was decided on [sage=devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/t/5d9c32390ffe3c96):

1 - Any Parent or Element must have an equality methods such that
`self == self` and `self != None`. This is not required for general `SageObject`. I also test that `self != self` and `self == None` both returns `False`. 

2 - Element construction should be idempotent. More precisely, for any element e within parent P, the equality `P(e) == e` must hold. This should only be enforced for true parent since it cause some problems for facade parents. 

Case by case exception such as `RealIntervalField` are possible.

3 - `_test_hash`: test that the result of hash is an int or that it raises an appropriate exception

3' - element of a parent in the category `Monoid()` (respectively `CommutativeAdditiveMonoid()`) must have a `__hash__` method,
which may raise an error for mutable element but never on `.one()` (respectively `.zero()`)
