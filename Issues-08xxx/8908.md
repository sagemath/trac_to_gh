Could you please 

* fold the patches into one patch
* add #8908 to the first description line (instead of trac 8908)

It may then allow to have a green light from the bot.

I would give a positive review if you could fold the two patches into one.

The bot is currently not working, so one does not require the green light.

Well, this seems ok to me. I would rather replace

```
gen = self((domain[pos + i], domain[pos + i + 1]))
gens.append(gen) 
```

by the single line

```
gens.append(self((domain[pos + i], domain[pos + i + 1])))
```

I am a bit puzzled by the "PluginFailed" given by the bot. What is the meaning of ValueError("Mercurial queue boilerplate") ?
