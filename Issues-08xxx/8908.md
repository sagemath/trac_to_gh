Could you please 

* fold the patches into one patch
* add #8908 to the first description line (instead of trac 8908)

It may then allow to have a green light from the bot.

Well, this seems ok to me. I would rather replace

```
gen = self((domain[pos + i], domain[pos + i + 1]))
gens.append(gen) 
```

by the single line

```
gens.append(self((domain[pos + i], domain[pos + i + 1])))
```

I am a bit puzzled by the "PluginFailed" given by the bot. What is the meaning of ValueError("Mercurial queue boilerplate") ?
