Right now, we have the following behavior:

```
sage: float(CC(1.0))
1.0


sage: float(CDF(1.0))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/jason/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/complex_double.so in sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement.__float__ (sage/rings/complex_double.c:6532)()

TypeError: can't convert complex to float; use abs(z)


sage: float(complex(1.0))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/jason/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: can't convert complex to float 
```

As robertwb and was voted (on https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/5400#comment:12 and on sage-devel), we should make float conversion succeed if the imaginary part is zero.

(I don't like the use of Python conversion functions on Sage objects.)

Why (only) suggest use of `abs()`? What about `real_part()`?
Or even `imag_part()` and `arg()`, perhaps `norm()`, too?

Is `abs()` really more natural than `real_part()`?

Well, `__long__()` could equally well succeed if the *fractional* (and imaginary) part is zero... ;-)

(And note that `int(1.1)` **silently** *truncates*; i.e. the current situation is overall not very consistent, as I mentioned in the thread.)

Nevertheless, I'll test it as soon as the "normal" 4.4.3.alpha0 ptestlong finishes on my Pentium 4, just wait a few hours... ;-)
