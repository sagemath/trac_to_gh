Right now, we have the following behavior:

```
sage: float(CC(1.0))
1.0


sage: float(CDF(1.0))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/jason/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/complex_double.so in sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement.__float__ (sage/rings/complex_double.c:6532)()

TypeError: can't convert complex to float; use abs(z)


sage: float(complex(1.0))

TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: can't convert complex to float 
```

As robertwb and was voted (on http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/5400#comment:12 and on sage-devel), we should make float conversion succeed if the imaginary part is zero.

(I don't like the use of Python conversion functions on Sage objects.)

Why (only) suggest use of `abs()`? What about `real_part()`?
Or even `imag_part()` and `arg()`, perhaps `norm()`, too?

Is `abs()` really more natural than `real_part()`?

Well, `__long__()` could equally well succeed if the *fractional* (and imaginary) part is zero... ;-)

(And note that `int(1.1)` **silently** *truncates*; i.e. the current situation is overall not very consistent, as I mentioned in the thread.)

Nevertheless, I'll test it as soon as the "normal" 4.4.3.alpha0 ptestlong finishes on my Pentium 4, just wait a few hours... ;-)

we might as well make the best of it and let int be the "round closest to zero" function, in essence.  And it's documented, and it's not the natural thing one would do (Integer(1.1) behaves as you would like).
