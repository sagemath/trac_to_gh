## Build environment
* Sun Ultra 27 3.33 GHz Intel W3580 Xeon. Quad core. 8 threads. 12 GB RAM
* OpenSolaris 2009.06 snv_111b X86
* Sage 4.3.1 (with a few packages hacked to work on 64-bit)
* gcc 4.3.4 configured with Sun linker and GNU assembler from binutils version 2.20.
* 64-bit build. SAGE64 was set to yes, plus various other tricks to get -m64 into packages.

```
 == Probably reason ==
This looks like a 32/64 bit issue, as the ELFCLASS is wrong. I suspect this is building 32-bit, not 64-bit, though its not obvious as all one sees is:

```
Compiling genus2reduction.c
```
with no idea what compiler is being used.

You gave it a positive review.
