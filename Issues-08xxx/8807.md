Working on the doc tests for sage.category at #8800, I found that support for morphisms is missing in the category framework. I think this is important, and therefore I am opening this ticket.

Some thoughts on implementing support.

Let f be a morphism in a category C, and let F be a functor, F.domain()==C. Then F(f) should by default try F(f.domain()).hom(f,F(f.codomain())). This relies on the call method of F(f.domain()).Hom(F.codomain()), which in turn uses _coerce_impl. I think it is there where the support should be implemented.

Example:

In sage.rings.homset.RingHomset_generic_with_category._coerce_impl, one has

```
        ...
        if x.parent() == self:
            if isinstance(x, morphism.RingHomomorphism_im_gens):
                return morphism.RingHomomorphism_im_gens(self, x.im_gens())
            elif isinstance(x, morphism.RingHomomorphism_cover):
                return morphism.RingHomomorphism_cover(self)
        raise TypeError
```
Why not instead

```
        try:
            if isinstance(x, morphism.RingHomomorphism_im_gens):
                return morphism.RingHomomorphism_im_gens(self, x.im_gens())
            elif isinstance(x, morphism.RingHomomorphism_cover):
                return morphism.RingHomomorphism_cover(self)
        except:
            raise TypeError
```

If I do so, the following works:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = R.hom([2*x],R)
sage: C = Fields()
sage: f2 = C(R).hom(f,C(R))
sage: f2
Ring endomorphism of Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
  Defn: x |--> 2*x
sage: f2(1/x)
1/(2*x)
```

It should be straight forward to change the call method of ``C`` so that ``C(f)`` reproduces the above construction. Similarly, if ``F`` is a functor then ``F(f)`` should call ``F(f.domain()).hom(f,F(f.codomain()))``.

Cc to the original authors.

I solved the problem. Please apply both patches in order.

**__New Code__**

I cleaned the framework for functors. There is a generic call method that (in contrast to the old generic call method) has a return value. It relies on three methods _coerce_into_domain, _apply_functor and _apply_functor_to_morphism. The default methods are already enough for forgetful functor and most construction functors.

I implemented a new class for Ring Homomorphisms that are induced by a homomorphism of the base ring. This enables the application of the construction functors for matrix and polynomial rings.

**__Tests__**

All new code is tested, and I added also some doc tests for old code. This is related with #8800. However, #8800 should not be closed, because the old code is still not completely covered by tests yet.

Suggestion: The further work on #8800 will build upon this ticket.

**__Showcases__**

We start with a homomorphism of polynomial rings.

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: S.<z> = QQ[]
sage: f = R.hom([2*z,3*z],S)
```

Now we construct polynomial rings based on ``R`` and ``S``, and let ``f`` act on the coefficients:

```
sage: PR.<t> = R[]
sage: PS = S['t']
sage: Pf = PR.hom(f,PS)
sage: Pf
Ring morphism:
  From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
  To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Univariate Polynomial Ring in z over Rational Field
  Defn: Induced from base ring by
        Ring morphism:
          From: Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
          To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in z over Rational Field
          Defn: x |--> 2*z
                y |--> 3*z
sage: p = (x - 4*y + 1/13)*t^2 + (1/2*x^2 - 1/3*y^2)*t + 2*y^2 + x
sage: Pf(p)
(-10*z + 1/13)*t^2 - z^2*t + 18*z^2 + 2*z
```

The construction of induced homomorphisms is recursive, and so we have:

```
sage: MPR = MatrixSpace(PR, 2)
sage: MPS = MatrixSpace(PS, 2)
sage: M = MPR([(- x + y)*t^2 + 58*t - 3*x^2 + x*y, (- 1/7*x*y - 1/40*x)*t^2 + (5*x^2 + y^2)*t + 2*y, (- 1/3*y + 1)*t^2 + 1/3*x*y + y^2 + 5/2*y + 1/4, (x + 6*y + 1)*t^2])
sage: MPf = MPR.hom(f,MPS); MPf
Ring morphism:
  From: Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
  To:   Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Univariate Polynomial Ring in z over Rational Field
  Defn: Induced from base ring by
        Ring morphism:
          From: Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
          To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Univariate Polynomial Ring in z over Rational Field
          Defn: Induced from base ring by
                Ring morphism:
                  From: Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
                  To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in z over Rational Field
                  Defn: x |--> 2*z
                        y |--> 3*z
sage: MPf(M)
[                    z*t^2 + 58*t - 6*z^2 (-6/7*z^2 - 1/20*z)*t^2 + 29*z^2*t + 6*z]
[    (-z + 1)*t^2 + 11*z^2 + 15/2*z + 1/4                           (20*z + 1)*t^2]
```

And this can also be achieved using construction functors:

```
sage: from sage.categories.pushout import CompositConstructionFunctor
sage: F = CompositConstructionFunctor(QQ.construction()[0],ZZ['x'].construction()[0], QQ.construction()[0],ZZ['y'].construction()[0])
sage: R.<a,b> = QQ[]
sage: f = R.hom([a+b, a-b])
sage: F(f) # indirect doctest
Ring endomorphism of Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Rational Field
  Defn: Induced from base ring by
        Ring endomorphism of Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Rational Field
          Defn: Induced from base ring by
                Ring endomorphism of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Rational Field
                  Defn: Induced from base ring by
                        Ring endomorphism of Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b over Rational Field
                          Defn: a |--> a + b
                                b |--> a - b
```

With the second patch, Laurent polynomial rings work as well:

```
sage: P = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ,'t')
sage: F = P.construction()[0]
sage: X.<t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(R)
sage: p = (a+b)*t^-1 + (a^2)*t + b
sage: F(f)(p)
(a^2 + 2*a*b + b^2)*t + a - b + 2*a*t^-1
```

<a id='comment:7'></a>I produced a new patch (I hope I got the `hg -qfold` command right).

The problem was: 

* Some construction functors used to be defined on the wrong categories. E.g., the `MatrixFunctor` was defined as a functor from Rings() to Rings(), which is of course wrong if the number of rows is different from the number of columns.
* In the good old times, every functor had a custom `__call__` method. Therefore, it was not noticed that sometimes the return value did not belong to the expected category.
* My default `__call__` method does check the output - and raises an error if it is wrong.
* For some reason I forgot to run `sage -testall`

Solution:

* Be more careful with defining domain and codomain of the construction functors.
* Run `make ptestlong`. Result:
  {{{
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4078.1 seconds
   }}}

One remark concerning doctests. The genuinely new code (induced morphisms) is doctested. In my patch, I however did not add tests for sage.categories.pushout. This is done in #8800. I hope that the ticket from #8800 still applies with the new patch that I posted here.

Just a few trivial comments, after which I could give this a positive review.  The patch applies fine to 4.6.rc0 (though the related one at #8800 does not then apply cleanly) and all tests pass.  There is no time regression (long tests took 667s before and 642s after, using -tp 20).

Here are the minor issues in docstrings:

line 44: "one should implement two methods" -- do you mean three?

_apply_functor_to_morphism: first line of docstring is a copy from the previous function but should presumably be "Apply the functor to a morphism between ... something" 

In the new `__call__` function, I would like to see a test of the branch which raises a `TypeError` ""%s is ill-defined, ..."

Is the spelling of "`CompositConstructionFunctor`" intentional?  Should it not be "`CompositeConstructionFunctor`"?

That's good news! As my patch only adds functionality, without changing the method resolution order of existing classes and without replacing existing algorithms, it is no surprise that the speed remains fine.

You know, there are three types of mathematicians: Some can count, and others can't.

But isn't it pythonesque? Recall the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch from the movie "Monty Python and the Holy Grail"... :)

> _apply_functor_to_morphism: first line of docstring is a copy from the previous function but should presumably be "Apply the functor to a morphism between ... something" 


Right.

> In the new `__call__` function, I would like to see a test of the branch which raises a `TypeError` ""%s is ill-defined, ..."


OK, but I hope such example needs to be constructed on purpose. It used to happen with the matrix constructor, for example: The functor was supposed to take a ring R into the ring(!!) of m by n matrices over R. But if the matrix constructor does not produce square matrices, the result is of course not a ring. This bug existed before and is fixed in my patch (now, the functor's codomain is only expected to be the category of rings if m equals n). However, this is exactly the situation that is covered by the `TypeError`.

> Is the spelling of "`CompositConstructionFunctor`" intentional?  Should it not be "`CompositeConstructionFunctor`"?


This wasn't my idea. `CompositConstructionFunctor` existed earlier (see pushout.py).

As I mentioned on the other ticket, I will be unable to do any programming work at least until next week. But it should be one of the first things I'll do once I'm settled in Jena.

Best regards,

Simon
