This patch adds a function to block_design returning a Steiner Triple System on any number of vertices n congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 6. There is none otherwise :-)

The function is pretty short, a satisfiable decomposition being explicitely given in the reference :

Applies fine to 4.4.a1, passes sage -testall on a 10.6.2 mac (except for the r.py failure, which is unrelated), and looks good to me in terms of examples and references.

Thanks Nathann!
