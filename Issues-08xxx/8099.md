Without setting CFLAGS=-m64 globally build is 32 bit.

A patch is on its way.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
The comment in SPKG.txt is inaccurate, as the patch is not specific to Open Solaris.

 A more accurate comment would be.

* #8099 Ensures the compiler flag -m64 is added at any time SAGE64 was
 set to "yes" - previously this was only happening on OS X. This should aid
 building 64-bit on any platform, although it has only been tested on Open
 Solaris.

It's far better to open a ticket for the bug first, before trying to fix it. Then the ticket number can be placed in the comments in SPKG.txt.

It would be good to see some evidence the patch actually works. Such as byshowing the output of the 'ldd' command, that the library and/or binary is now a 64-bit one. For some packages, it is unnecessary to add -m64 and forothers, adding it does not generate 64-bit binaries. For zlib, adding -m64 stops the build of shared libraries.

This was *exactly* what I did!

I opened the ticket *because* without -m64 set pari build in 32 bit!

Sorry. The only point I would make is that the trac ticket should go on the same bullet point. I must admit I don't see why it makes a huge difference, but I was told the file is parsed, and so the format is important. I must admit, I've no idea what parses it.

But the point I am making is that there is nothing to show that the library now builds 64-bit. Probably showing the output of the 'ldd' command before and after a patch would be best.
