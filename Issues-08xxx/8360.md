Add an interface to Jean-Eric Pin's Semigroupe package

http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~jep/semigroupes.html

An experimental spkg is now on trac; here is the patch taken from the old Sage-Combinat patch server:

:attachment:trac_8360_semigroupe-interface-nt.patch

Status: advanced proof of concept, with interactions in both directions (building a semigroup in Semigroupe from Sage data). Main show stopper: one can only manipulate one semigroup at a time.

The following should hopefully get you started:

```
   sage -f https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8360/semigroupe-2.0-2.spkg.gz
   sage -combinat update
   sage -br

   sage: semigroupe?
   sage: semigroupe.tutorial?
```

Beware 'sage -f an_url' does not redownload the package if sage
already has a copy of it. So you may have to first do:

```
        rm <SAGE_ROOT>/spkg/optional/semigroupe-2.0.spkg
```


Update 2016-12-05: James Mitchel is reimplementing Semigroupe in C++, which will lift the main limitation (a single semigroup at a time):
https://james-d-mitchell.github.io/semigroupsplusplus/

This could be the occasion to revive this old code.

There seems to be a problem on a 64bit machine. After installing the spkg, the following commands will cause Sage to segfault:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(["H",4])
sage: S = semigroupe.AutomaticSemigroup(W.semigroup_generators(), W.one(), category = FiniteCoxeterGroups())
sage: S.cardinality()
------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in Sage.
...
```

The problem seems to be with compiling Semigroupe on a 64bit machine. After installing the package, the following segfaults:

```
karkwa: cd $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin
karkwa: Semigroupe
karkwa: ./Semigroupe
Segmentation fault
karkwa: ./SelfContainedTest 
Toto
a | 2  3  1 
b | 2  1  3 
c | 1  2  1 

Segmentation fault
karkwa: ./SemigroupeModuleTest 

a | 2  1 
b | 1  1 

Segmentation fault 
```
I think that the two test suites (I think they are test suites...) should be run by the `spkg-check` script.

you mean a git branch?

which patch? is it finite_semigroup-nt.patch ?

I don't see how this patch uses semigroupe.

I think I don't agree. I think the goal of the actual ticket #8360 is to make the actual semigroup into sage as it is. semigroupe was written for something no? Let's first make this available!

Then I suggest to open a ticket showing with sage command line code illustrating how the bug for creating two semigroup simultaneously is obtained. The new ticket would ask for an upstream fix.

Indeed, the interface was written for something. But in practice, even
if I spent quite some time on it, I am actually seldom using it
because that misfeature is making it relatively unusable (at least in
my use-cases).

> Then I suggest to open a ticket showing with sage command line code

That's an option. If you are convinced that:

- At some point not to far in the future the bug will be fixed upstream (upstream meaning possibly us taking the time to do the fix).

- The current code won't need serious interface change then.

Then let's go ahead. I'd love to have this code always under my fingertips. Otherwise I am a bit reluctant to put in Sage some code that we might need to remove (because unused) or change a
lot later on.

At the end of the day, this would actually be best handled by putting
the interface code in the spkg and not in the Sage library. I haven't
checked how hard/easy it would be to handle.
