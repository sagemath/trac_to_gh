Installing the jsMath image fonts in `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/jsmath/fonts`, say, should make it easier to upgrade to new SageNB versions.

Note: Both the notebook and the command-line can use jsMath (e.g., `browse_sage_doc(identity_matrix)`).

I have no problem with jsmath image fonts (with latest Sage and #8051).
Could the problem be limited to sagenb.org only?

Forgot to write: I tested it on fresh Sage install - this means there are no old directories used by previous versions. Perhaps, the install script from the latest jsmath fonts was confused by previous installs and old jsmath directories on sageng.org? Just guessing, I do not have access there.

**Attachment:** [trac_8129-jsmath_fonts.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8129/trac_8129-jsmath_fonts.patch.gz)

With the patch, the server does a simple check for jsMath fonts under `SAGE_LOCAL`:

```python
jsmath_fonts_path = os.path.join(os.environ['SAGE_LOCAL'],
                                 'lib', 'jsmath', 'fonts')
if not os.path.exists(jsmath_fonts_path):
    jsmath_fonts_path = os.path.join(javascript_path, 'jsmath', 'fonts')
```

We'll need to add the msbm10 fonts to the fonts spkg.  Instead of putting even more version-checking logic in `jsmath-image-fonts-*.spkg` `spkg-install`, should we give the new spkg a different name, e.g., `jsmath-image-fonts-new-*.spkg`?  Its `spkg-install` would just install the fonts in `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/jsmath/fonts`.

Also, should we try adding **all** of the [extra jsMath fonts](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsmath/download/extra-fonts/welcome.html) to the new spkg?
