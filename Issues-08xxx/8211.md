as reported on sage-devel [Segfault: Polynomials over RealField]
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(RealField()) 
sage: P(0)*P(0)+P(0) 
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 

it can be traced down to a bug in _mul_ that computes the degree
of the polynomial P(0)*P(0) wrongly (-2 istead of -1 !)
Patch is trivial, and attached.
