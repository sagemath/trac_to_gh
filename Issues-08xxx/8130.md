Try this:

```
sage: s = u"č"
sage: view(s)
```
It will throw a `UnicodeDecodeError`.  This much can be fixed using the "experimental" patch at #8083; however, after applying that patch,

```
sage: view(s)
```
pops open a dvi/pdf file showing the wrong unicode character.

See #8083 and #8128 for tickets focusing on latex and unicode in the notebook.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

What if we try just

```python
sage: s ='č'
sage: view(s)
sage: s.decode('utf8')
u'\u010d'
```
?  This opens a PDF file for me that shows the expected character.

`view(u'\u010d')` works for me, but I may well be misinterpreting your question.  We could use `encoded_str` in place of `str` in some places.

By the way, it seems that [XeTeX / XeLaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xelatex) is currently one of the better ways to mix Unicode and LaTeX.  Unfortunately, the example in the article doesn't work for me with TeX Live on Linux --- the font is missing.
