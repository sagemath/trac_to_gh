Sage has an Open MPI optional package, which uses version 1.1.4 of Open MPI. This was released on Jan 30, 2007, so is more than 3 years old. It fails to build on Solaris - see #8522.

The optional package is very different to most other Sage packages, which shows its age. 

* No SPKG.txt
* No Mercurial repository
* Sources sit in top-level directory, not in a 'src' subdirectory. 

I'll create a package based on the latest version of Open MPI, which is version 1.4.1, which was released 15th January 2010. 

**Update:** A new spkg can be found under http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/openmpi-1.4.3.spkg

I've created a ticket to update mpi4py - #8538, as that is very old too. I'll try to test the two packages together. 

The old version of openmpi used these configure options:

```
./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --with-f90-max-array-dim=0 --disable-mpi-f77 
--disable-mpi-f90 --with-mpi-f90-size=trivial
```

I'll look as whether these are all needed, as both openmpi and mpi4py are several years old.

Since I need mpi4py for a seminar and the current version didn't build on our multigpu machine, I had an urge to update openmpi and mpi4py.

The new package can be found under http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/downloads/detail?name=openmpi-1.4.3.spkg
and is tested on ubuntu 10.04

**Remark:** Before Install one has to remove other installations of openmpi or else get troubles.
The current spkg install holds a lot of remove statements a better solution would be great.
Also one has to update mpi4py.

Thanks for updating everything!

I think you should be using `rm -f` to delete the old versions. The current `spkg-install` will fail to install if you don't already have the old openmpi lying around.

You should always use `$MAKE` because somebody might have set `MAKE=/path/gnu-make` or so. Do you need to disable parallel make? Then set `MAKE="$MAKE -j 1"`

Does mpi4py or anything else need the fortran API? If no, why not disable it in the configure. If yes, is there any way we can make it call `sage_fortran` as the compiler?

Thanks for all the information!

I changed everything to your advices. rm worked without -f but I added it just to be sure.
Also found an unnecessary rm statement. The fortran things were already outcommented but I removed them completely, to avoid confusion.
I upload a the new spkg-install to see the difference

Nice! Functionality-wise it is all good. But would you mind filling in the `SPKG.txt` according to the template in the developer manual? See

That'll give us a place to record future changes etc. You could also add `.*~` to the `.hgignore` so that mercurial doesn't complain about emacs backup files.

OK something went wrong with the SPKG.txt when packing, perhaps I deleted it accidentally or something else went wrong. In addition I can't upload the new version on the spkg-upload site...

You can download the corrected version now under: http://computational-sage.googlecode.com/files/openmpi-1.4.3.spkg

I hope everything is now correct, and thanks for the hint with the .hgignore!

Cheers,
Stefan

I just tested in on Solaris and the export + set variable construct seems to be a bash-ism and not portable to other shells:

```
$ export MAKE="$MAKE -j 1"
MAKE= -j 1: is not an identifier
$ MAKE="$MAKE -j 1"
$ export MAKE
```

The best fix is to change the first line of spkg-install to 

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```
Almost all spkgs use that anyways.

I've made that change to the openmpi spkg and put the result here:

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/openmpi-1.4.3.spkg

Since thats a minor change I'll leave it as positive review.

For the record, compile still fails on Solaris (as with the previous version). This issue is tracked in #8522: Optional package openmpi-1.1.4 fails to install on Solaris 10 SPARC
