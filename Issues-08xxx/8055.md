Let's showcase the many cool features of Sage on the Notebook login page!

For this we can use a carousel plug-in for jQuery.  Some searches and several experiments indicate that [jCarousel](http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/) is both featureful and relatively easy-to-use.

Note: We can use the carousel in other ways, too, e.g., for slideshows.

Note: This depends on the SageNB 0.7 spkg at #8051.

The patch puts an auto-scrolling image carousel on the login page.  I've used several images from sagemath.org as an example.  [Here's a mockup.](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/8055/login_showcase.html)  But we could

* Add screenshots.
* Include links to more documentation, published worksheets, etc.
* Make it customizable.
* Get the server to generate images, etc.
* Insert any HTML that fits in the space.
