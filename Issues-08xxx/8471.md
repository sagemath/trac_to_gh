sage: 
```
Note that this is a bug in the `pexpect` Python module shipped with Sage.

```
sage: import pexpect
sage: pexpect.__version__
'2.0'
```
It appears to be fixed in the newest version of `pexpect` (version 2.3).

Should we patch `pexpect` or upgrade?

We discussed this a bit on sage-devel:
[http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8213950ab1abbeb2](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8213950ab1abbeb2)

Some highlights:

- William Stein pointed out that pexpect was rewritten after 2.0 and has had some performance issues; it is worth trying the latest version of pexpect to see if the situation has improved.

- Robert Bradshaw pointed out that we need to add a blurb to pexpect's SPKG.txt explaining this issue.

So these should be addressed appropriately by this ticket.
