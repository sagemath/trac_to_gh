The following works :

```
sage: point((2,3))

sage: point((2,3,4))

sage: point(vector((2,3)))
```

but the following doesn't :

```
sage: point(vector((2,3,4)))

The problem happens in sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2

it should be calling `return Point(v, size, **kwds)`, but instead executes `A = sum([Point(z, size, **kwds) for z in v])`  

I think there is something wrong with the if condition.

The second patch does not apply on top of the first.

Only the second patch with doctest should be applied.  Otherwise, it's all good.
