The following works :

```
sage: point((2,3))

sage: point((2,3,4))

sage: point(vector((2,3)))
```

but the following doesn't :

```
sage: point(vector((2,3,4)))

The problem happens in sage.plot.plot3d.shapes2

it should be calling `return Point(v, size, **kwds)`, but instead executes `A = sum([Point(z, size, **kwds) for z in v])`  

I think there is something wrong with the if condition.
