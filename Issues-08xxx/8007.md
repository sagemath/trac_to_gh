Looks good, just needs some fixes due to random number generation changes:

```

Cool, fixed. New patch attached. 

(Amusingly, the `number_field.py` failure was a change I made on purpose: I was putting it there for myself as a reminder to doctest everything, because I was habitually only doctesting that directory ... oops.)
