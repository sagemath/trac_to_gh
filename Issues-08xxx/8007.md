In the process of looking at #3436, I noticed that generation of random number field elements was slow. I was hoping that speeding it up would make it fast enough that we could use a "generic" algorithm for generating matrices over cyclotomic fields. I did get a **100-150X** speedup for generating random elements of number fields, but amazingly, this **still** wasn't quite fast enough to beat the more "quick and dirty" approaches for cyclotomic matrices. However, I think this code is probably still worth merging.
