We have convolution scattered in several places, including

```
sage.rings.polynomial.convolution
sage.functions.piecewise_old.PiecewisePolynomial.convolution
sage.functions.piecewise.PiecewiseFunction.EvaluationMethods.convolution
sage.gsl.dft.IndexedSequence.convolution
```
This should be extended to make it easier to use/find and to support more arbitrary inputs, both discrete and continuous.

See [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/7f90c228df9530dd](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/7f90c228df9530dd) for background.

Depends on #14801

Keywords: **convolution, convolve, discrete, continuous**

Component: **symbolics**
