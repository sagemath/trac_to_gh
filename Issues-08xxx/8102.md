```
confdir = os.path.join(SAGE_DOC, 'en', 'introspect') 
```
won't there be problems if SAGE_DOC is None?  I guess earlier in the file, you could change the last line in the following:

```
try:
    from sage.misc.misc import SAGE_DOC
except ImportError:
    SAGE_DOC = ""  # used to be None
```
Otherwise it looks good.
