The iconv package, which will soon be added to sage (#8191) has the facility to run 

```
make check
```

However, despite getting a test failure on Solaris 10 (SPARC), the makefile is still exiting with an exit code of 0, so any scripts which rely on testing iconv by relying on a failure of 'make check' to exit properly with a non-zero exit code will not work as desired. 

I'll report this to the iconv developers. 



**Assignee:** GeorgSWeber

**Upstream:** Reported upstream. Developers deny it's a bug.
