Without the patch, I get, e.g.,

```sh
mpatel@sage monoids$ sage -t .
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 0.0 seconds
mpatel@sage monoids$

With the patch, I get

```sh
mpatel@sage monoids$ sage -t .
sage -t  "./string_monoid_element.py"
