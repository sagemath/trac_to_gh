**Attachment:** [trac_8891.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8891/trac_8891.patch.gz)

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Without the patch, I get, e.g.,

```sh
mpatel@sage monoids$ sage -t .
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 0.0 seconds
mpatel@sage monoids$ 
```
With the patch, I get

```sh
mpatel@sage monoids$ sage -t .
sage -t  "./string_monoid_element.py"                       
         [2.1 s]
[...]
```
