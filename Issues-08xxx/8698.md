Thanks, Simon... ;-)

I think what's at all meant by "Notebook" has to be explained, too. A typical German reader would first think of his laptop, not a user interface (which is funny if not annoying in the translation of the user guide when talking about `ssh_keygen`...).

It would be nice if you could supply a patch on top of Minh's.

Replying to [comment:5 leif]:
> I think what's at all meant by "Notebook" has to be explained, too. 


Good idea (and perhaps it would make sense to have this in English, too).

> It would be nice if you could supply a patch on top of Minh's.


Done. 

My patch adds a section on the notebook (I hope I didn't write too much nonsense, because I hardly ever use the notebook) and the two png-plots that were missing.

Minh: Is it OK to first finish this ticket off before focusing on #8660? Or should the two tickets be united at an earlier stage?

Best regards, Simon

I just found one typo. I wrote:

Should be "Die Anzahl der Möglichkeiten ist gigantisch, wir geben hier nur die ersten 40 Ziffern an."

The Sage tour is much shorter than the installation guide. So I think the tour would be the first to get into the Sage standard documentation. Thank you for reviewing the tour.
