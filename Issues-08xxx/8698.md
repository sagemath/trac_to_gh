As the subject says. Because the patch on this ticket is short, I think this ticket takes much less work to review than #8660. So it's very likely that the current ticket would be merged first, then #8660. Someone who knows German needs to look over the attached patch.

Thanks, Simon... ;-)

I think what's at all meant by "Notebook" has to be explained, too. A typical German reader would first think of his laptop, not a user interface (which is funny if not annoying in the translation of the user guide when talking about `ssh_keygen`...).

It would be nice if you could supply a patch on top of Minh's.

Replying to [@nexttime](#comment%3A5):
> I think what's at all meant by "Notebook" has to be explained, too. 

Good idea (and perhaps it would make sense to have this in English, too).

> It would be nice if you could supply a patch on top of Minh's.

Done. 

My patch adds a section on the notebook (I hope I didn't write too much nonsense, because I hardly ever use the notebook) and the two png-plots that were missing.

Minh: Is it OK to first finish this ticket off before focusing on #8660? Or should the two tickets be united at an earlier stage?

Best regards, Simon

Helas.

I just found one typo. I wrote:
"Die Anzahl der Möglichkeiten ist gigantisch, wir geben hier nur die letzten 40 Ziffern an."

Should be "Die Anzahl der Möglichkeiten ist gigantisch, wir geben hier nur die ersten 40 Ziffern an."

But I think this should be fixed once there are more comments of another reviewer.

The Sage tour is much shorter than the installation guide. So I think the tour would be the first to get into the Sage standard documentation. Thank you for reviewing the tour.
