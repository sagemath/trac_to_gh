From the documentation:

(using this patch) we show how to implement a nested class Foo.Bar
with a binding behavior, as if it was a method of Foo: namely for
``foo`` an instance of ``Foo``, calling ``foo.Bar()`` is equivalent to
``Foo.Bar(foo)``::

```
            sage: import functools
            sage: from sage.misc.classcall_metaclass import ClasscallMetaclass
            sage: class Foo:
            ...       class Bar(object):
            ...           __metaclass__ = ClasscallMetaclass
            ...           @staticmethod
            ...           def __classget__(cls, instance, owner):
            ...               print "calling __classget__"
            ...               if instance is None:
            ...                   return cls
            ...               return functools.partial(cls, instance)
            ...           def __init__(self, instance):
            ...               self.instance = instance
            sage: foo = Foo()
            sage: bar = foo.Bar()
            calling __classget__
            sage: bar.instance == foo
            True
```

This will be used by the upcoming improvements to the functorial constructions in categories

This is a check to see if CC to sage-combinat-commits is working.
Apologies for the trouble.

Hi Nicolas,

They are a few problem with this patch:
- it seems that line 119-125 (in the file) does not belongs to there ! They are after a return. Are they a bad copy paste ?
- I think it would be more natural to add this feature to `NestedClassMetaclass` rather than to `ClasscallMetaclass`
- It took me half an hour to fully understand what's happening. In particular the doc is wrong in saying that 

```
This method implements a binding behavior for ``foo.cls`` by delegating it to ``cls.__classget__(foo)``
```
indeed ``cls.__classget__(foo, Foo)`` is called. Can you confirm this ? 

Florent

Thanks for spotting this; that could explain some trouble I was having right now :-)

Let's discuss this over the phone.

Oops right. It calls __classget__ as per the descriptor protocol (which includes a 3rd argument).

Please let me know if you already made a patch on top on this one in the queue.
