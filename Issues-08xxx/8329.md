BipartiteGraph is missing a copy() method.

```
sage: bg = BipartiteGraph(graphs.CycleGraph(4))
sage: type(bg)
<class 'sage.graphs.bipartite_graph.BipartiteGraph'>
sage: bg2 = bg.copy()
sage: type(bg2)
<class 'sage.graphs.graph.Graph'>
```

The result is not horrendous because the base Graph class has a copy() method.  But the result is unexpected: copy() a BipartiteGraph and you get a Graph?
