```
The file `word.py` is getting very huge and forces one to create new classes inside of it (see below for explanation) which will get the file `word.py` even more huge in the future...

If a file contains the following :

```
#file1.py
class A:
    #huge class
    pass
class C(A):
    #huge class
    pass
``` 

one can not create a new class between A and C in another file (because of loops of import) :

```
#file1.py
class A:
    #huge class
    pass
from file2 import B
class C(B):
    #huge class
    pass
``` 

```
#file2.py
from file1 import A
class B(A)
    #large intermediate class
    pass
```

So the solution is either to put everything in the same file or to put everything in different files. In this case, I choose the last solution because `word.py` is getting huge.

This ticket removes `Word_class`, `FiniteWord_class` and `InfiniteWord_class` from `word.py` and put them in new files called respectively `abstrac_word.py`, `finite_word.py` and `infinite_word.py`.

There seems to be three patches that have not been merged to sage-4.3.4 yet, but I don't think they are needed for #8429. Here is the list:

#8475, #8313, #8296.

I shouldn't have included #8429 as it is this current patch. I'll check for the three above patches if they are a problem.

Alexandre, I just moved the patch `trac_8429_split_word-sl.patch` before #8475 and #8296 in the sage-combinat tree. I can confirm that they commute so that this ticket doesn't "mercurialy" depend on #8296 and #8475.
